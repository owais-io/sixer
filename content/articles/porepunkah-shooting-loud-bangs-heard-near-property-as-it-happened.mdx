  We’ll wind down our live coverage of unfolding events in Porepunkah shortly.
  Suspected gunman Dezi Freeman remains on the run in a semi-rural part of
  Victoria’s north east. Freeman, the man suspected of shooting and killing two
  police officers and injuring a third at a rural Victorian property, has
  previously called police “terrorist thugs” and has a history of association
  with pseudolaw and “sovereign citizen” ideas. The Victorian police
  commissioner said police believe Freeman is thought to understand “bushcraft
  well”, presenting a challenge for those searching for him. He said the best
  experts in the country are doing “everything” they could to find Freeman. The
  slain officers were named as Detective Leading Senior Constable Neal Thompson
  and Senior Constable Vadim De Waart. At the scene in Porepunkah, at least
  three loud bangs, which sounded like shots, were heard this afternoon near the
  property where Freeman was living. A roadblock remains in place around the
  area where Freeman was living. A convoy of police vehicles has now left the
  area. Jacinta Allan honoured the slain officers and said every effort was
  being put into the manhunt for the suspect. Porepunkah residents are advised
  to stay indoors and stay vigilant while the operation continues. One local
  described the small town as an “idyllic place to live. It’s a really nice
  place to live. It’s not some conspiracy theorist town.” Another said she
  suspected Freeman “knows how to look after himself” out in the bush. From
  Facebook groups to shootouts with police, my colleague Ariel Bogle took a look
  inside the sprawling ecosystem of ‘sovereign citizens’. Other tributes have
  flowed for the officers who lost their lives, including from Victoria’s
  opposition leader, Brad Battin, and the federal member for Indi, Helen Haines.
  Finally, here’s our wrap of the events so far. We will be back with more
  updates tomorrow. Thanks, as ever, for joining us. A large number of police
  cars have just left the roadblock area where suspected gunman Dezi Freeman was
  living. The convoy included two BearCats, a set of armoured rescue vehicles.
  It appears local cars, including a tractor, have been allowed to enter the
  area. The roadblock remains in place. Victoria police have said there will be
  no extra information this evening. Premier: ‘my advice is Victoria police’s
  advice’ Circling back to Jacinta Allan’s press conference this evening,
  residents in Porepunkah have again been urged to follow the advice of the
  police. The Victorian premier said: My advice is Victoria police’s advice. I
  can appreciate being told to stay indoors, to be alert to your local
  surrounds, to provide information if you suspect anything suspicious in your
  local community. I absolutely accept that that is really challenging and can
  be distressing. She said given the “stress of the situation and the response”
  the state government would be looking at “what further support we can provide,
  because there is no doubt that there will be distress now in the community,
  and that distress will carry on”. Victoria’s opposition leader honours police
  officers ‘tragically killed in the line of duty’ Victoria’s opposition leader,
  Brad Battin, has released a statement after police identified yesterday’s
  fallen officers as detective Neal Thompson and senior constable Vadim De
  Waart: We now know the identities of the two police officers who laid down
  their lives yesterday in Porepunkah. We honour Detective Leading Senior
  Constable Neal Thompson and Senior Constable Vadim De Waart, tragically killed
  in the line of duty. Both dedicated their lives to service – Neal with decades
  of good work, and Vadim with optimism and pride. We mourn their loss and pay
  our respects to their families, friends, and colleagues. Indi MP remembers
  slain officers ‘as people … beyond the uniform’ Dr Helen Haines, the federal
  member for Indi, has paid tribute to the two police officers who lost their
  lives in Porepunkah yesterday. “We mourn for Detective Leading Senior
  Constable Neal Thompson and Senior Constable Vadim De Waart, who so tragically
  lost their lives in the line of duty at Porepunkah yesterday,” she said in a
  statement. The hearts of the families of Detective Leading Constable Thompson
  and Senior Constable De Waart will be forever broken. Their lives have been
  shattered, and they remain foremost in our thoughts as they face this tragedy
  and the unimaginable circumstances of their loss. As tributes flow for these
  officers, we also remember Neal and Vadim as people – with family, friends,
  interests and passions beyond the uniform. They deserved the chance to keep
  living those lives, and it is with deep sadness that we honour their lives and
  their service. We continue to pray for the recovery and healing of the officer
  who was injured in the line of duty, and for others at the scene whose mental
  trauma cannot be underestimated or ignored. Porepunkah thrown into the ‘the
  most awful of spotlights possible’ Jacinta Allan says Tuesday’s Porepunkah
  shooting struck at “the core” of the Victoria police and has thrown the local
  community into the “most awful of spotlights”. “What happened yesterday was a
  tragedy, a deep tragedy. It’s gone to the core of Victoria police. It’s hurt
  so many families,” the Victorian premier told reporters a short time ago. She
  said the community, too, was “feeling the weight” of the ongoing events. Let’s
  remember the community of Porepunkah. It’s a beautiful community. It’s a
  tight-knit community, and they’ve also feeling the weight of what is happening
  in their beautiful country town. It is still very, very early in terms of the
  operational response to this awful incident … there is no doubt that this is a
  community that is feeling the enormity of how their beautiful country town …
  that peaceful, wonderful country lifestyle, was not just shattered, but was
  put into the most awful of spotlights possible. Porepunkah primary school will
  open tomorrow Porepunkah primary school will be open tomorrow, Victoria’s
  deputy premier and minister for education, Ben Carroll, says. Speaking with
  reporters just now, he said the school had completed a lockdown drill “only a
  few weeks ago”. He said the way the school had responded yesterday was
  “textbook”, keeping classes operating during lockdown, ensuring students were
  escorted for toilet breaks and providing occupational health and therapy in
  classrooms. He said: I couldn’t be more proud of Porepunkah, how they
  responded yesterday, and I know how they’ll respond tomorrow when the school
  reopens. It’s very close knit, only 100 students, 12 teachers, and a lot more
  education support staff from Melbourne that are up there at the moment.
  Jacinta Allan says “a huge effort” is being put into the manhunt for suspect
  Dezi Freeman. “There is a huge effort that is going on right now in the
  north-east of Victoria,” the Victorian premier has just told reporters. “There
  is support, also from New South Wales that is being offered and is being
  worked through with Victoria Police.” She added that “every resource is being
  dedicated to finding” this suspect, and that the police would be given all
  resources necessary to find Freeman. Every effort is being put to finding this
  individual to bring justice to the families of the two police officers who
  have been killed, and we support Victoria police in putting every effort
  behind this task. Jacinta Allan pays respects to ‘Neil and Vadim’ who ‘did not
  get the opportunity to come home’ The Victorian premier has paid her respects
  to the two police officers who were shot dead in Porepunkah yesterday.
  Speaking at a press conference just now, Allan said the two police officers
  “put on their uniforms yesterday morning; like every man and woman in Victoria
  police, they wear that uniform with pride, and they go to work every single
  day with the purpose of keeping our communities safe”. She continued:
  Yesterday, Neil and Vadim did not get the opportunity to come home at the end
  of the day to take that uniform off, to reflect on the challenges of the day
  with their family and their loved ones. And it is to those family and loved
  ones that I convey my deepest sympathy, and also to that wider Victoria police
  family who are feeling this grief, feeling this hurt, so keenly, yet continue
  to put on that uniform with pride and courage and go to work to keep our
  community safe, and particularly to those officers who are involved in the
  active search that’s going on in the north-east right now. Two more mobile
  intensive care paramedic cars have just entered the roadblock with a fleet of
  other cars. These are highly specialised paramedics who can perform advanced
  medical procedures. Convoy of trucks seen leaving roadblock to where Freeman
  was living Five identical dual-cab pickup trucks have just been seen leaving
  the roadblock area where gunman Dezi Freeman was living. Loud bangs which
  sounded like shots were heard in the area earlier, and a helicopter that was
  circling over earlier can be heard again in the distance. We are waiting at
  the edge of the roadblock for more information, but police have said a press
  conference is unlikely tonight. We’ll bring you more as it comes. Brother of
  suspected gunman says his ‘prayers’ are with fallen police The brother of the
  suspected Porepunkah gunman has posted on social media that “my prayers are
  with the fallen police”. James Filby, the younger brother of the suspect Dezi
  Freeman, who was previously known as Desmond Filby, also changed his Facebook
  profile photo to a blue ribbon. “My prayers are with the fallen police and
  their grieving familes(sic),” he wrote, with a crying eyes emoji. Filby was
  contacted for comment. Residents told to stay vigilant as Porepunkah operation
  remains ongoing Police have said the operation in Porepunkah is ongoing, but
  that more information is unlikely tonight. A helicopter was circling the
  property where gunman Dezi Freeman was living before shots were heard. The
  roadblock continues, but the sound of the helicopter has stopped. Freeman is
  considered armed and dangerous, with residents told to limit their movements
  and stay vigilant. We will bring you updates as soon as we have them. Some
  council facilities reopen in Alpine region, national park closed Alpine Shire
  council facilities in Porepunkah and Bright will remain closed, but have
  reopened in some areas, the council has confirmed. Posting to social media, it
  said facilities, including libraries and visitor information centres, had
  reopened in the townships of Myrtleford and Mount Beauty. Transfer stations in
  both townships will reopen tomorrow. Facilities in Bright and Porepunkah will
  remain closed while the current situation continues. We appreciate your
  understanding and will keep you informed of any further changes. Thank you for
  your continued patience and support. Meanwhile, Mount Buffalo national park is
  closed until further notice as the search for the suspected gunman continues.
  In a statement, Parks Victoria said: Mount Buffalo National Park is closed to
  the public due to the ongoing Victoria Police incident at Porepunkah. The park
  will reopen once the incident is resolved. We ask all visitors planning to
  visit the park to follow Victoria Police advice and avoid the area. Sixteen
  Melbourne landmarks to be illuminated in blue in honour of fallen police
  officers We are still waiting to hear more from Cait Kelly on the ground in
  Porepunkah. In the meantime, it has been confirmed that a number of public
  buildings across Melbourne will be illuminated in blue and flags lowered to
  half mast to honour detective Neal Thompson and senior constable Vadim De
  Waart. They include: Royal Exhibition Building Immigration Museum Melbourne
  Museum Melbourne town hall The Arts Centre Melbourne’s spire AAMI Park Rod
  Laver Arena Kia Arena John Cain Arena Flinders Street station Shrine of
  Remembrance Old Treasury Building Parliament House MCG Federation Square The
  Margaret Court arena will also light up in blue after the end of a Camila
  Cabello concert. At the scene in Porepunkah, at least three loud bangs which
  sounded like shots have been heard near the property where Dezi Freeman was
  living. Shortly afterwards, a paramedic’s vehicle and extra police entered the
  roadblock area. More to come. A helicopter has been circling for at least an
  hour near where suspected gunman Dezi Freeman lived in Porepunkah, while the
  community remains in lockdown. Paramedics have just been seen entering the
  police blockade, but no extra information has been given. An occasional police
  car has come in and out, with authorities saying he is still on the run.
  They’re asking everyone in the area not to move around unless essential.
  Victoria Police have sent another message to people in the Porepunkah area as
  the search continues for Freeman, requesting “non-essential travel” to be
  avoided. It reads: Message from Victoria Police. Specialist police continue to
  search for Dezi Freeman (aka Desmond FILBY). There are multiple police units
  in the general area of Porepunkah and Victoria Police request you restrict
  non-essential travel. Some roadblocks and travel restrictions may be in place.
  If you see anything suspicious call 000. If you missed it, here’s what we know
  about the suspect at large: Police secretary union pays tribute to ‘unique and
  irreplaceable’ fallen police officers The secretary of Victoria’s Police
  Association, Wayne Gatt, has paid tribute to the two fallen officers after
  their identities were confirmed this afternoon. He said Detective Senior
  Constable Neal Thompson and Senior Constable Vadim De Waart were “more than
  the uniforms they wore and were defined by more than the selfless work they
  performed in guarding the innocent from the evil every day”. They were people.
  Loved by their friends, families and colleagues. Unique and irreplaceable.
  Gatt said Thompson, who was known as ‘Thommo’, would leave a void in
  Wangaratta that “can’t be filled”. Neal was one-of-a-kind, a laid-back
  adventurer who loved to share the outdoors with his mates. He was devoted to
  partner Lisa, the love of his life. He loved his job and he was proud of it.
  Neal had an almost 40-year career of service and a vivid plan for life after
  policing. Sadly, that future has been taken, but his history of service and
  his impact on the community he served will endure. He said policing wasn’t De
  Waart’s first career, “but it was one that came naturally for a man who loved
  working with and helping people”. Vadim, who grew up in Belgium, spoke three
  languages and was learning a fourth. He loved travelling and he loved life. He
  had a lust for learning and was an avid runner. He drew people in with his
  quirky, inquisitive nature and broad smile. Vadim too, will be missed for who
  he was, and remembered for the legacy he left both within and outside of
  policing. Another Porepunkah local, Jesslyn Ellis, said she believed Freeman
  had lived in the area for about 25 years. “The community really cares about
  each other. I never really knew him, but I knew of him,” she said. I just feel
  so sorry for his family. Obviously, I feel for the police and their families
  too. Ellis said she was sure Freeman “knows how to look after himself” out in
  the bush. He could be in a cave. He could be down a mine. He could show up
  anywhere. Locals describe Porepunkah as ‘wholesome’ and ‘not some conspiracy
  theorist town’ Porepunkah is in a very beautiful part of Victoria, not far
  from the Falls Creek and Mount Hotham ski resorts. The petrol station on the
  main street doubles as a ski hire shop. Everyone we have spoken to has talked
  highly of the town and the people who live there. One resident, who asked not
  to be named, said Porepunkah was home to a “wholesome” and “really lovely
  community”. “It’s just an idyllic place to live. It’s a really nice place to
  live. It’s not some conspiracy theorist town,” they said. What’s happened – in
  any place [it would be] so far out of the ordinary. So it’s quite surreal
  really. Loss of colleagues has ‘struck at heart’ of Victoria police, chief
  commissioner says Victoria’s chief police commissioner, Mike Bush, has paid
  tribute to his two colleagues. This devastating loss of Neal and Vadim has
  struck at the heart of Victoria Police, the broader policing family and the
  community of Porepunkah. In the coming days, weeks and months, we will all
  grieve this loss and deeply miss our colleagues and friends who have paid the
  ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. It is not lost on me that our members
  take a risk every time they go to work to protect the Victorian community.
  While we all live with the knowledge that the worst could happen on a shift,
  we don’t expect it to. Bush said in these “difficult times” it was “so
  important that our people stand together and support each other”. I have full
  confidence that we will all do this with dignity and respect. Victoria Police
  have named the officers who lost their lives in yesterday’s shooting as
  Detective Leading Senior Constable Neal Thompson, 59, and Senior Constable
  Vadim De Waart, 35. Thompson, who was on the verge of retirement, joined
  Victoria Police in 1987 and spent seven years in general duties at Collingwood
  police station before working as a detective at the Major Fraud Squad and the
  State Crime Squad. He took up his most recent post in the Wangaratta CIU in
  July 2007. In a statement, police said Neal was an adventurer and enjoyed all
  things outdoors. He loved getting out in nature, and his friends and
  colleagues regularly joined him on these trips. Neal had spent the past six
  years alongside his partner, Lisa, the love of his life. Since the pair met,
  Neal had found new purpose and was planning in earnest for his imminent
  retirement. Together with Lisa, Neal had built a new home and had a long list
  of tasks planned after he knocked off work for the last time. De Waart had
  only recently arrived in Wangaratta when the shooting occurred. He started his
  policing career at the Victoria Police Academy in late 2018 and worked for
  three years at St Kilda police station before joining PORT as a senior
  constable in April 2023. At the time of his passing, Vadim was on temporary
  assignment in Wangaratta. An eternal optimist and avid traveller, Vadim was
  fluent in French, Spanish, Flemish and English. He had also completed scuba
  dives all around the world and motorcycling trips more locally with his
  friends and colleagues. He was a keen gin collector and always picked up a
  local bottle on his overseas adventures for his large collection at home.
  While travelling was his passion, Vadim was extremely proud to have purchased
  his first home in Melbourne in recent years. He is survived by his parents
  Carolina and Alain, who live in his Belgium, his younger brother Sacha who
  lives in Switzerland and a number of relatives in Melbourne. ‘Where he is and
  how they’re gonna find him, that’s anyone’s guess’ Porepunkah is surrounded by
  bushland and pine plantations in the foothills of the alps, near the base of
  Mt Buffalo. Kealan Lee, who was driving through the town on his way home to
  Yarrawongah after a visit to the dentist, said it was a “pretty rugged” place.
  “I used to come up here 4WDing as a kid. There’s not much open space,” he
  said, adding: Even if they’re flying that helicopter, you’re not going to see
  much through the trees. They’ve got the CFA (Country Fire Authority) tracks,
  but they lock them off [and] you’d need a pretty serious 4WD to get up there.
  Where he is and how they’re gonna find him, that’s anyone’s guess. Sense of
  ‘edge in the air’ in Porepunkah, pub manager says Businesses in the Porepunkah
  area are remaining closed as the search continues for Freeman in Victoria’s
  high country. The venue manager of the Porepunkah Pub, Misty-Rose Wilson,
  lives on Mount Buffalo Road, which was “locked in and locked down” yesterday
  evening. She told ABC Radio Melbourne that she was among many of the pub’s
  staff who lived in the area and had been unable to leave their homes. At 6pm
  last night we received messages as residents letting us know … to lock your
  doors and stay inside. Since then we did have another message this morning
  that was a repeat of last night’s message. That’s basically all the
  communication we’ve had at this time. Something like this shocks a town like
  ours, we’re a really small, tight-knit community so there’s a sense of edge in
  the air. The Porepunkah Pub posted on social media, confirming it would follow
  advice from Victorian police to stay shut tonight. Our staff have been
  instructed not to leave their homes, and their safety, along with that of our
  guests and wider community, remains our top priority. Police stations
  servicing Porepunkah inundated with flowers, cards and messages of support
  Wodonga Police has thanked the community for the “overwhelming support”
  received as the force comes to terms with the deaths of two officers and the
  serious injury of another. The Wodonga police posted on social media: On
  behalf of everyone at Wodonga Police, we want to sincerely thank our community
  for the overwhelming support we have received following the tragic events of
  yesterday. The flowers, cards, and countless messages of kindness and sympathy
  mean more than words can express. In such a difficult time, it is deeply
  comforting to know we are surrounded by a community that stands with us. Your
  compassion and care are a reminder of the strength we have when we come
  together. The Wangaratta police similarly sent a “heartfelt thank you to
  everyone who has reached out with flowers, cards and messages of support after
  the tragic events involving our members yesterday”. This is a very difficult
  time for our police family here at Wangaratta, but knowing that our community
  is standing beside us truly means the world. Your kindness, compassion and
  care are giving us strength as we face the days ahead together. Wodonga and
  Wangaratta have the two largest police stations in the area, and both are
  about an hour’s drive from Porepunkah. Police block road leading to property
  where shooting took place Police have set up a roadblock on Mt Buffalo Road,
  not far from central Porepunkah. I’m here at the roadblock – along with most
  of the other media. It’s now raining heavily. We’re about 2 kms away from the
  start of Rayner Track, the road that leads to the property where the shooting
  took place. While Guardian Australia’s photographer, Stuart Walmsley, and I
  were able to drive right up to the entrance of the property earlier today,
  police now aren’t letting the media any further down the main road. The police
  haven’t provided any further details as to why they have blocked off the road,
  but we will update you as soon as we learn more. Victoria Police have released
  further information as they continue to search for Dezi Freeman. They say he
  was last seen running into the bush near a property on Rayner Track in
  Porepunkah at 10.30am yesterday, wearing “dark green (khaki) tracksuit pants,
  dark green rain jacket, brown Blundstone boots and reading glasses”. Police
  described him as Caucasian, 183cm tall, with a medium build and short dark
  hair. They said if anyone sees him or has any further information to contact
  Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000: We continue to urge the public in and around
  the township of Porepunkah to remain indoors until further notice. We also ask
  people not to travel into the area. Police said Freeman also goes by Desmond
  Filby. They released an image of him: The minister for police, Anthony
  Carbines, was also visibly emotional when he made his statement to the lower
  house. He says: Every fortnight at the academy, new graduates pass through and
  they take an oath to serve and protect the community that they’re members of
  ... It’s very inspiring to see them make that commitment on behalf of all
  Victorians, and while they’re hurting and their families are hurting, they’re
  still on duty and working today, tonight, tomorrow and every day. There have
  also been updates from other ministers, including local government minister,
  Nick Staikos. He says the department of government services have been in
  contact with the Alpine Shire Council, who earlier today issued a plea for
  government support. Staikos says: [The department] will continue to work
  closely with council over the coming days to identify where additional support
  is needed, whether for council itself or directly to the community. This is a
  moment of sadness and shock, but also a time when people across our state come
  together to support each other. The education minister, Ben Carroll, says he
  has personally thanked the Porepunkah primary school principal, Jill Gillies,
  for helping keep students calm during a lockdown yesterday. Carroll says:
  Porepunkah has been around for more than 150 years, it is a close knit
  community and has a very long term teaching staff of 12. In Jill’s words to me
  this morning, she said they’re a brilliant bunch of adults. As these horrific
  events unfolded yesterday, Jill and her staff worked hard to make sure the
  students under their care were secure and safe. I want to thank Jill and her
  team for their calmness and their steadfast leadership. Carroll says the
  school will be provided with ongoing wellbeing support, including trauma
  counselling for any students, staff and affected families. Thanks for sticking
  with us so far today. Caitlin Cassidy will take over the blog from here. Take
  care. Victoria premier praises emergency services working days ‘among toughest
  our state has known’ The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has used question
  time to praise emergency services after the Porepunkah shooting and a fatal
  school bus crash this morning. She described the past 48 hours as “among the
  toughest our state has known”. Allan went on: In both of these tragedies, our
  emergency responders have been … at the scene of great heartbreak. They have
  carried out their duties in dangerous, confronting and deeply difficult
  conditions. And on behalf of everyone in this place, I want to thank them –
  Victoria police, paramedics, firefighters, SES workers and volunteers – for
  the courage, professionalism and great care they have shown through the most
  trying of circumstances. She said Victorians were grateful emergency
  responders continued to work to keep communities safe in “the most difficult,
  treacherous and dangerous of circumstances”. Each of us has a responsibility
  to walk beside them, to wrap our arms around them, to provide every support
  they need, not just now, for as long as it takes. This is a time of grief. It
  must also be a time of unity, a time to stand with these families, to stand
  with these communities, and also to stand with every member of Victoria police
  and every one of our emergency services. As the search continues in and around
  Porepunkah, near Mount Buffalo in Victoria’s high country, the weather bureau
  is forecasting a series of cold fronts could dump up to a metre of snow in the
  state’s alpine areas between now and Saturday. A series of cold fronts
  crossing south eastern Australia in the final week of winter were expected to
  culminate in flurries of snow across four states, including Victoria’s alpine
  areas, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. In Victoria, the chilly winds
  could see the snow level drop to 1,000m on Thursday and down to 600m on
  Friday. Subzero temperatures were forecast for alpine areas, which could see
  up to a metre of snow, between now and Saturday. The cold fronts could
  culminate in snowfall in some unusual places. In Victoria, this included the
  western parts of the Grampians, Macedon Ranges and the Dandenong Ranges in
  Melbourne’s east. Local mechanic describes Freeman as a ‘new age Ned Kelly’
  Marty Robinson, who owns the mechanic shop in town, described Freeman as a
  “new age Ned Kelly” who was “pretty handy in the bush”. Standing on
  Porepunkah’s main street, gesturing up at the hills behind him, Robinson said
  the police “could be up there for weeks looking for” him. “He doesn’t fit in,
  and he doesn’t go along with the rules, and he’s an anti-vaxxer. That’s all
  probably true, but … he’s a family man”, he said. “I’m not saying he’s a hero
  or a legend, but he’s someone’s father.” Robinson said the day felt pretty
  normal to him and that Porepunkah remained a “sleepy little town”. “Life goes
  on. Just checked my mail; no bills, that’s good. I’m servicing a lady’s car.
  The show goes on,”he said. What do Porepunkah locals have to say about the
  ongoing manhunt? I’m in Porepunkah with photographer Stuart Walmsley, where
  we’ve been speaking with locals. It’s a rainy, grey day, and as you can
  imagine, most people would have remained indoors even if Victoria police
  hadn’t sent automated text messages to everyone warning them to stay home due
  to an “active armed offender in the general area”. Still, some people have
  left home to go to work, or ducked out to get a coffee or collect their mail,
  only to be met by journalists, photographers and camera crews, most of whom
  have driven up from Melbourne. Many locals have, understandably, been
  reluctant to speak to the media. Everyone we have spoken to who knew Dezi
  Freeman, who lived on a bush block at the end of a dirt road on the outskirts
  of town, has said he knew the land very well and that they thought it would be
  difficult to find him. Mayor of local council urges community to ‘continue to
  look after yourselves and each other’ Sarah Nicholas, the mayor of the Alpine
  Shire council, which includes Porepunkah, said the community extended its
  “deepest thanks to all frontline workers – especially Victoria police – for
  the extraordinary work they are doing to protect and support our community”.
  Nicholas told community members on social media they should take reassurance
  “in the fact that we are receiving the best of the best when it comes to
  police resourcing and expertise, with support from both state and interstate
  agencies”, adding: We know this event has had a significant emotional impact –
  particularly on our younger community members and their parents and carers,
  many of whom experienced lockdowns at schools and childcare centres yesterday.
  Please continue to look after yourselves and each other. If you or someone you
  know is struggling, reach out – help is available, and you are not alone. The
  suspected Porepunkah gunman, Dezi Freeman, did not own the property where the
  shootings took place. Guardian Australia has been unable to speak with the
  owners, a local couple. It is unclear if the couple had been living on the
  property with Freeman and his family, but they were not there at the time of
  the shootings. Attempts to contact the owners via social media and family
  members have been unsuccessful. Property records show that they sold a
  separate property in a nearby regional town earlier this year. The couple had
  operated a business selling chestnuts and appeared at local farmers’ markets.
  A man who also claimed to live at the property had parked his car over the
  driveway on Wednesday, preventing access beyond the front gate. The car had a
  note on the dashboard that read “left car here to prevent reporters to access
  private land. I live here” and included a phone number. The man declined to
  comment, but when asked if he had spoken to the owners of the property, he
  responded that “everything was under control”. Aircraft banned from flying
  above Porepunkah No aircraft will be allowed to fly around Porepunkah after
  the Australian Transport Safety Bureau granted the area “Temporary Restricted
  Airspace”. Victoria police said the no-fly zone, which includes all aircraft
  and drones, was within a 4 nautical mile (about 7.5km) radius of 6619 Great
  Alpine Road, Porepunkah (Feathertop Winery) and would be in place until at
  least 11.30pm on Friday. Police said: Given the suspect in this matter is
  heavily armed, this condition has been granted due to the risk to aircraft and
  drones, as well as potential implications associated with the suspect tracking
  police movements based off media coverage. The Australian federal police
  warned violent sovereign citizens could become an enduring part of the “threat
  landscape” in an unclassified 2022 briefing released under freedom of
  information laws. The suspected Porepunkah gunman, Dezi Freeman, has been
  described as a sovereign citizen. Like many others within the movement, he
  appeared to become radicalised during the early years of the pandemic, railing
  against lockdowns and vaccine mandates, which were seen as reinforcing his
  conspiratorial beliefs about governments. The AFP, in a briefing released
  under freedom of information laws in 2023, said it remained to be seen how the
  end of the pandemic would shift the behaviour of this group. Stephen Dametto,
  the acting assistant commissioner of counter-terrorism and special
  investigations, wrote in the presentation: What we’ve learned is while these
  groups present and behave very differently to other extremist groups, there is
  an underlying capacity to inspire violence. As COVID-based restrictions and
  mandates begin dissipating around the country, time will tell whether we see
  these movements fade into obscurity or whether they become a more enduring
  fixture of the threat landscape in Australia. Dametto also stated in the
  briefing that: SovCits see violence as a last resort or only necessary in the
  form of ‘self-defence’ against a tyrannical government. This however, does not
  mean that these groups can’t be dangerous. Some photos from Porepunkah A
  massive police operation is under way in the small town of Porepunkah, home to
  about 1,000 people. Guardian Australia has a photographer on the ground as the
  man hunt continues. Support from colleagues ‘the best medicine’ for injured
  officer, head of police association says Wayne Gatt, the head of the Victoria
  Police Association, said he spoke to the officer who was seriously injured
  yesterday. Gatt told RN Breakfast earlier the man was “clearly devastated” by
  the events, and had to deal with his own recovery while mourning the loss of
  his colleagues: I can only imagine how he’s feeling. He’s having to deal with
  that at the same time as dealing with his physical injuries, which I know he
  received some treatment for yesterday. And I just hope that his continued
  recovery is faster. I know some of his colleagues have had some messages from
  him this morning, which is great. It’s great to see because the best medicine
  is the support of your colleagues. It works for us. I don’t know, it might be
  a police thing … but it does work for us knowing that the policing community
  is supporting you. And I’m sure that will be, in no small dose, something that
  he’s drawing heavily on. Legal sources have told Guardian Australia that the
  senior officer who was killed, a 59-year-old detective, was particularly well
  regarded in the region for his kindness and fairness. “He was just a lovely
  bloke, it’s a tragedy,” one lawyer said. He was so close to retiring, he’d
  booked tickets for an overseas holiday and everything. Awful stuff. The same
  lawyer had regularly seen Dezi Freeman around the Wangaratta courts, though
  never represented him or dealt with him. Freeman often represented himself in
  court. “He was certainly a frequent flyer, that’s for sure,” the lawyer said.
  Victoria police commissioner Mike Bush addresses media amid search for
  Porepunkah shooting suspect – video Police have a “wide cordon” set up as part
  of a “very wide search area” for Dezi Freeman, Victoria police chief
  commissioner, Mike Bush, told reporters on Wednesday morning. “We are pouring
  every resource into this search for this person.” Head of Victoria police
  association says members ‘enormously sad’ after death of colleagues Wayne
  Gatt, secretary of the Victoria Police Association, said earlier this morning
  the group’s members were all “enormously sad” after yesterday’s events at
  Porepunkah. Gatt told RN Breakfast: I mean, I don’t know if there’s an easier
  way to describe it. They’re all people underneath that uniform, and they’re
  just enormously sad … Hundreds of them are having to suppress the way they’re
  feeling emotionally as they turn up to work and really get on with this
  dangerous, but so important, job of holding this offender to account. Albanese
  says government takes threat of sovereign citizen ideology seriously The prime
  minister, Anthony Albanese, said the federal government takes seriously the
  threat of ideologies like sovereign citizenship. He was asked about the
  government’s consideration of fringe movements on ABC Radio Melbourne this
  morning: Mike Burgess, the director general of Asio, has been warning about
  far-right extremism. We have seen that spread and it is difficult to defend
  against individuals. We know that that is the case, that this person, Dezi
  Freeman, who remains on the run is the latest advice that we have received,
  has [allegedly] engaged in an attack in which two police officers have lost
  their lives, a third has been seriously injured. Bush said earlier the 10
  officers who attended Freeman’s property were there to execute a warrant
  related to the Sexual Offences and Child Abuse Investigation teams, known as
  Socit. He told reporters: So the team that went there were local officers and
  members of the sexual offences and child investigation team. I’m not going to
  go into any further detail, because there are victims involved in the matter
  and it would be very unfair and unwise for me to talk about that any further.
  Injured officer will recover, but has ‘significant’ injuries Bush said he
  hopes to visit the officer injured in the shooting yesterday, saying he
  believes they are out of surgery but “significantly damaged”. He said the
  officer will recover, but more information on their condition will come later.
  Bush said police believe Freeman is thought to understand “bushcraft well”,
  presenting a challenge for those searching for him: Our understanding of him
  is he understands bushcraft well, which provides a challenge for us. But we
  keep an absolutely open mind on what options are open to him. And those
  options will inform our approach. Authorities conducting a manhunt overnight
  did so in difficult weather conditions. But Bush said the team was “absolutely
  determined and focused on finding this person.” They are oblivious to those
  conditions when they have a mission. Freeman thought to have ‘multiple
  firearms’ Bush said police believe Freeman has many weapons with him: Long
  arms, powerful firearms, multiple firearms. We haven’t recovered any of his
  firearms from the scene. Police have ‘wide cordon’ set up as part of ‘very
  wide search area’ Bush said the best experts in the country are doing
  “everything” they can to find Freeman. Authorities have not had any confirmed
  sightings of him since yesterday’s events. We have all the assets in play. We
  have not had any confirmed site sightings of him at the moment … Anything is
  possible. He knows that area, even though we have experts in the area, he will
  know that area better than us. So, that’s why we’re putting in every expert
  and supported by local knowledge as well. Bush added Victoria police had
  spoken with their counterparts in NSW, who are on standby if needed. The chief
  commissioner of Victoria police, Mike Bush, said Freeman, 56, is “heavily
  armed” and still at large. Bush said a “large team” were “absolutely focused”
  on finding the suspect: We are pouring every resource into this search for
  this person, we must find him … The hunt will continue until we find him. Bush
  said there was no hostage situation. Porepunkah shooting suspect Dezi Freeman
  called police ‘terrorist thugs’ and tried to arrest magistrate, court records
  reveal Dezi Freeman, the man suspected of shooting and killing two police
  officers and injuring a third at a rural Victorian property, has previously
  called police “terrorist thugs” and has a history of association with
  pseudolaw and “sovereign citizen” ideas. Court records show Freeman has
  previously described police as “frigging Nazis”, “Gestapo” and “terrorist
  thugs”. He also once attempted to arrest a magistrate during a bizarre court
  hearing in Wangaratta. Last year, a Victorian county court judge found Freeman
  was guilty of using a mobile phone while driving and refusing to provide a
  saliva sample to police in September 2020 on the Great Alpine Road. But he
  lodged a legal battle after the judge cancelled Freeman’s licence and
  disqualified him from obtaining a licence for a period of two years from 8
  April 2024. Read more: Federal MP for Porepunkah area says extreme ideologies
  ‘have no place in Australia’ Federal MP Helen Haines, the local member for
  Indi, which covers the Porepunkah area, said her community is “completely
  shocked and devastated” after yesterday’s events. Haines told ABC News: There
  is so much grief and disbelief and frankly horror at what has unfolded in
  Porepunkah … I think the Victorian government are doing everything they can
  and I know that the Victoria police and emergency services are throwing every
  resource at this issue to find and apprehend this offender. I can’t ask for
  more than that, and right now that is the priority. Haines said it was still
  an active event and while police would take time to understand the motivation
  behind the shooting, extreme ideologies had “no place in Australia”. The law
  of this land applies to everyone, irrespective of what ideology a person may
  or may not subscribe to. We were warned last year around the rise of various
  ideologies and the real risk it poses to civil society. But in this case,
  again we have an active event happening right now in Porepunkah with police
  and emergency services trying to apprehend this offender. And until this
  person is brought in, we won’t know exactly what has motivated this person.
  But whichever way you look at it, extreme ideologies have no place in
  Australia. Police to address media in Melbourne Victoria police are set to
  hold a media conference on the latest information out of Porepunkah in a few
  minutes, at 8.30am. We’ll carry the latest updates as they come through.
  Sussan Ley pays tribute to slain Porepunkah police officers The opposition
  leader, Sussan Ley, has paid tribute to two police officers killed at
  Porepunkah yesterday. She called the shooting “a heartbreaking tragedy that
  has touched every Australian”. “These officers gave their lives protecting
  their community, and our nation grieves deeply with their families, friends
  and colleagues. This loss is a solemn reminder of the dangers police face each
  day and the extraordinary courage it takes to serve,” Ley said in a statement.
  To every officer who wears the uniform, you carry our respect and our
  gratitude. Ley also spoke of the detective who was left injured, and other
  police responding to the incident in the rural Victorian town. In this moment
  of profound sadness, Australians stand shoulder to shoulder with Victoria
  Police. We will honour those who have fallen and never take for granted the
  courage and service that keeps our communities safe. AFP and Asio assisting
  with investigation, says home affairs minister The home affairs minister, Tony
  Burke, said this morning that both the Australian federal police and Asio are
  assisting with the investigation in Porepunkah. Andrew Hastie says society has
  seen a ‘breakdown in trust’ in governments since pandemic The shadow home
  affairs minister, Andrew Hastie, was asked on RN Breakfast about the concern
  surrounding fringe ideologies spreading through society. He said those ideas
  spark a real concern: I think since Covid, we’ve seen a breakdown in trust for
  governments, whether it be state or national governments. And so we have to
  work extra hard to win the trust of those we represent. There is no excuse
  ever for violence in this country, particularly of the sort that we saw
  yesterday, which claimed the lives of two police officers. … I think social
  cohesion is more frayed than ever. There’s more misinformation and
  disinformation out there. A lot of people went down the rabbit hole during
  Covid and they never came back up. Porepunkah primary school to remain closed
  today The local primary school in Porepunkah will not open today on the advice
  of Victoria police, Allan said earlier: The advice is that the request for the
  community to continue to remain indoors. The advice I have is the school, the
  primary school will not be open today as well. And this is all based on the
  advice of Victoria police and I urge everyone in the community to follow that
  advice. Victoria premier says ‘a lot of people feeling a deep grief today’ The
  Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, just spoke to ABC News, saying “every
  resource” was currently devoted to the manhunt, but said it has been a
  difficult few days for the community in Porepunkah. She said: While we wait
  for further details to come from Victoria police, we put our arms around the
  Victoria police family. A lot of people are feeling deep grief today and
  they’re also going to work today to keep our communities safe. So it’s been …
  it was an incredibly tragic day yesterday and it continues to be a tough one
  today … What happened yesterday was a tragedy. But also a hideous crime that
  was perpetrated on those who go to work every day to keep us safe. And that
  makes it even more awful and horrific. The suspect behind the shooting of
  three police officers, two of whom are dead, in Porepunkah, Victoria, is still
  on the run. Police said the man’s family, including his partner and his
  children, attended a local police station last night, but the man’s
  whereabouts remain unknown as a massive search continues today. The town of
  Porepunkah is about 300km north-east of Melbourne and police are combing dense
  bushland as part of their search. But residents of the town and surrounding
  areas are being urged to remain indoors until further notice. We’ll bring you
  more updates as the day moves along.

We’ll wind down our live coverage of unfolding events in Porepunkah shortly. Suspected gunman Dezi Freeman remains on the run in a semi-rural part of Victoria’s north east. Freeman, the man suspected of shooting and killing two police officers and injuring a third at a rural Victorian property, has previously called police “terrorist thugs” and has a history of association with pseudolaw and “sovereign citizen” ideas. The Victorian police commissioner said police believe Freeman is thought to understand “bushcraft well”, presenting a challenge for those searching for him. He said the best experts in the country are doing “everything” they could to find Freeman. The slain officers were named as Detective Leading Senior Constable Neal Thompson and Senior Constable Vadim De Waart. At the scene in Porepunkah, at least three loud bangs, which sounded like shots, were heard this afternoon near the property where Freeman was living. A roadblock remains in place around the area where Freeman was living. A convoy of police vehicles has now left the area. Jacinta Allan honoured the slain officers and said every effort was being put into the manhunt for the suspect. Porepunkah residents are advised to stay indoors and stay vigilant while the operation continues. One local described the small town as an “idyllic place to live. It’s a really nice place to live. It’s not some conspiracy theorist town.” Another said she suspected Freeman “knows how to look after himself” out in the bush. From Facebook groups to shootouts with police, my colleague Ariel Bogle took a look inside the sprawling ecosystem of ‘sovereign citizens’. Other tributes have flowed for the officers who lost their lives, including from Victoria’s opposition leader, Brad Battin, and the federal member for Indi, Helen Haines. Finally, here’s our wrap of the events so far. We will be back with more updates tomorrow. Thanks, as ever, for joining us. A large number of police cars have just left the roadblock area where suspected gunman Dezi Freeman was living. The convoy included two BearCats, a set of armoured rescue vehicles. It appears local cars, including a tractor, have been allowed to enter the area. The roadblock remains in place. Victoria police have said there will be no extra information this evening. Premier: ‘my advice is Victoria police’s advice’ Circling back to Jacinta Allan’s press conference this evening, residents in Porepunkah have again been urged to follow the advice of the police. The Victorian premier said: My advice is Victoria police’s advice. I can appreciate being told to stay indoors, to be alert to your local surrounds, to provide information if you suspect anything suspicious in your local community. I absolutely accept that that is really challenging and can be distressing. She said given the “stress of the situation and the response” the state government would be looking at “what further support we can provide, because there is no doubt that there will be distress now in the community, and that distress will carry on”. Victoria’s opposition leader honours police officers ‘tragically killed in the line of duty’ Victoria’s opposition leader, Brad Battin, has released a statement after police identified yesterday’s fallen officers as detective Neal Thompson and senior constable Vadim De Waart: We now know the identities of the two police officers who laid down their lives yesterday in Porepunkah. We honour Detective Leading Senior Constable Neal Thompson and Senior Constable Vadim De Waart, tragically killed in the line of duty. Both dedicated their lives to service – Neal with decades of good work, and Vadim with optimism and pride. We mourn their loss and pay our respects to their families, friends, and colleagues. Indi MP remembers slain officers ‘as people … beyond the uniform’ Dr Helen Haines, the federal member for Indi, has paid tribute to the two police officers who lost their lives in Porepunkah yesterday. “We mourn for Detective Leading Senior Constable Neal Thompson and Senior Constable Vadim De Waart, who so tragically lost their lives in the line of duty at Porepunkah yesterday,” she said in a statement. The hearts of the families of Detective Leading Constable Thompson and Senior Constable De Waart will be forever broken. Their lives have been shattered, and they remain foremost in our thoughts as they face this tragedy and the unimaginable circumstances of their loss. As tributes flow for these officers, we also remember Neal and Vadim as people – with family, friends, interests and passions beyond the uniform. They deserved the chance to keep living those lives, and it is with deep sadness that we honour their lives and their service. We continue to pray for the recovery and healing of the officer who was injured in the line of duty, and for others at the scene whose mental trauma cannot be underestimated or ignored. Porepunkah thrown into the ‘the most awful of spotlights possible’ Jacinta Allan says Tuesday’s Porepunkah shooting struck at “the core” of the Victoria police and has thrown the local community into the “most awful of spotlights”. “What happened yesterday was a tragedy, a deep tragedy. It’s gone to the core of Victoria police. It’s hurt so many families,” the Victorian premier told reporters a short time ago. She said the community, too, was “feeling the weight” of the ongoing events. Let’s remember the community of Porepunkah. It’s a beautiful community. It’s a tight-knit community, and they’ve also feeling the weight of what is happening in their beautiful country town. It is still very, very early in terms of the operational response to this awful incident … there is no doubt that this is a community that is feeling the enormity of how their beautiful country town … that peaceful, wonderful country lifestyle, was not just shattered, but was put into the most awful of spotlights possible. Porepunkah primary school will open tomorrow Porepunkah primary school will be open tomorrow, Victoria’s deputy premier and minister for education, Ben Carroll, says. Speaking with reporters just now, he said the school had completed a lockdown drill “only a few weeks ago”. He said the way the school had responded yesterday was “textbook”, keeping classes operating during lockdown, ensuring students were escorted for toilet breaks and providing occupational health and therapy in classrooms. He said: I couldn’t be more proud of Porepunkah, how they responded yesterday, and I know how they’ll respond tomorrow when the school reopens. It’s very close knit, only 100 students, 12 teachers, and a lot more education support staff from Melbourne that are up there at the moment. Jacinta Allan says “a huge effort” is being put into the manhunt for suspect Dezi Freeman. “There is a huge effort that is going on right now in the north-east of Victoria,” the Victorian premier has just told reporters. “There is support, also from New South Wales that is being offered and is being worked through with Victoria Police.” She added that “every resource is being dedicated to finding” this suspect, and that the police would be given all resources necessary to find Freeman. Every effort is being put to finding this individual to bring justice to the families of the two police officers who have been killed, and we support Victoria police in putting every effort behind this task. Jacinta Allan pays respects to ‘Neil and Vadim’ who ‘did not get the opportunity to come home’ The Victorian premier has paid her respects to the two police officers who were shot dead in Porepunkah yesterday. Speaking at a press conference just now, Allan said the two police officers “put on their uniforms yesterday morning; like every man and woman in Victoria police, they wear that uniform with pride, and they go to work every single day with the purpose of keeping our communities safe”. She continued: Yesterday, Neil and Vadim did not get the opportunity to come home at the end of the day to take that uniform off, to reflect on the challenges of the day with their family and their loved ones. And it is to those family and loved ones that I convey my deepest sympathy, and also to that wider Victoria police family who are feeling this grief, feeling this hurt, so keenly, yet continue to put on that uniform with pride and courage and go to work to keep our community safe, and particularly to those officers who are involved in the active search that’s going on in the north-east right now. Two more mobile intensive care paramedic cars have just entered the roadblock with a fleet of other cars. These are highly specialised paramedics who can perform advanced medical procedures. Convoy of trucks seen leaving roadblock to where Freeman was living Five identical dual-cab pickup trucks have just been seen leaving the roadblock area where gunman Dezi Freeman was living. Loud bangs which sounded like shots were heard in the area earlier, and a helicopter that was circling over earlier can be heard again in the distance. We are waiting at the edge of the roadblock for more information, but police have said a press conference is unlikely tonight. We’ll bring you more as it comes. Brother of suspected gunman says his ‘prayers’ are with fallen police The brother of the suspected Porepunkah gunman has posted on social media that “my prayers are with the fallen police”. James Filby, the younger brother of the suspect Dezi Freeman, who was previously known as Desmond Filby, also changed his Facebook profile photo to a blue ribbon. “My prayers are with the fallen police and their grieving familes(sic),” he wrote, with a crying eyes emoji. Filby was contacted for comment. Residents told to stay vigilant as Porepunkah operation remains ongoing Police have said the operation in Porepunkah is ongoing, but that more information is unlikely tonight. A helicopter was circling the property where gunman Dezi Freeman was living before shots were heard. The roadblock continues, but the sound of the helicopter has stopped. Freeman is considered armed and dangerous, with residents told to limit their movements and stay vigilant. We will bring you updates as soon as we have them. Some council facilities reopen in Alpine region, national park closed Alpine Shire council facilities in Porepunkah and Bright will remain closed, but have reopened in some areas, the council has confirmed. Posting to social media, it said facilities, including libraries and visitor information centres, had reopened in the townships of Myrtleford and Mount Beauty. Transfer stations in both townships will reopen tomorrow. Facilities in Bright and Porepunkah will remain closed while the current situation continues. We appreciate your understanding and will keep you informed of any further changes. Thank you for your continued patience and support. Meanwhile, Mount Buffalo national park is closed until further notice as the search for the suspected gunman continues. In a statement, Parks Victoria said: Mount Buffalo National Park is closed to the public due to the ongoing Victoria Police incident at Porepunkah. The park will reopen once the incident is resolved. We ask all visitors planning to visit the park to follow Victoria Police advice and avoid the area. Sixteen Melbourne landmarks to be illuminated in blue in honour of fallen police officers We are still waiting to hear more from Cait Kelly on the ground in Porepunkah. In the meantime, it has been confirmed that a number of public buildings across Melbourne will be illuminated in blue and flags lowered to half mast to honour detective Neal Thompson and senior constable Vadim De Waart. They include: Royal Exhibition Building Immigration Museum Melbourne Museum Melbourne town hall The Arts Centre Melbourne’s spire AAMI Park Rod Laver Arena Kia Arena John Cain Arena Flinders Street station Shrine of Remembrance Old Treasury Building Parliament House MCG Federation Square The Margaret Court arena will also light up in blue after the end of a Camila Cabello concert. At the scene in Porepunkah, at least three loud bangs which sounded like shots have been heard near the property where Dezi Freeman was living. Shortly afterwards, a paramedic’s vehicle and extra police entered the roadblock area. More to come. A helicopter has been circling for at least an hour near where suspected gunman Dezi Freeman lived in Porepunkah, while the community remains in lockdown. Paramedics have just been seen entering the police blockade, but no extra information has been given. An occasional police car has come in and out, with authorities saying he is still on the run. They’re asking everyone in the area not to move around unless essential. Victoria Police have sent another message to people in the Porepunkah area as the search continues for Freeman, requesting “non-essential travel” to be avoided. It reads: Message from Victoria Police. Specialist police continue to search for Dezi Freeman (aka Desmond FILBY). There are multiple police units in the general area of Porepunkah and Victoria Police request you restrict non-essential travel. Some roadblocks and travel restrictions may be in place. If you see anything suspicious call 000. If you missed it, here’s what we know about the suspect at large: Police secretary union pays tribute to ‘unique and irreplaceable’ fallen police officers The secretary of Victoria’s Police Association, Wayne Gatt, has paid tribute to the two fallen officers after their identities were confirmed this afternoon. He said Detective Senior Constable Neal Thompson and Senior Constable Vadim De Waart were “more than the uniforms they wore and were defined by more than the selfless work they performed in guarding the innocent from the evil every day”. They were people. Loved by their friends, families and colleagues. Unique and irreplaceable. Gatt said Thompson, who was known as ‘Thommo’, would leave a void in Wangaratta that “can’t be filled”. Neal was one-of-a-kind, a laid-back adventurer who loved to share the outdoors with his mates. He was devoted to partner Lisa, the love of his life. He loved his job and he was proud of it. Neal had an almost 40-year career of service and a vivid plan for life after policing. Sadly, that future has been taken, but his history of service and his impact on the community he served will endure. He said policing wasn’t De Waart’s first career, “but it was one that came naturally for a man who loved working with and helping people”. Vadim, who grew up in Belgium, spoke three languages and was learning a fourth. He loved travelling and he loved life. He had a lust for learning and was an avid runner. He drew people in with his quirky, inquisitive nature and broad smile. Vadim too, will be missed for who he was, and remembered for the legacy he left both within and outside of policing. Another Porepunkah local, Jesslyn Ellis, said she believed Freeman had lived in the area for about 25 years. “The community really cares about each other. I never really knew him, but I knew of him,” she said. I just feel so sorry for his family. Obviously, I feel for the police and their families too. Ellis said she was sure Freeman “knows how to look after himself” out in the bush. He could be in a cave. He could be down a mine. He could show up anywhere. Locals describe Porepunkah as ‘wholesome’ and ‘not some conspiracy theorist town’ Porepunkah is in a very beautiful part of Victoria, not far from the Falls Creek and Mount Hotham ski resorts. The petrol station on the main street doubles as a ski hire shop. Everyone we have spoken to has talked highly of the town and the people who live there. One resident, who asked not to be named, said Porepunkah was home to a “wholesome” and “really lovely community”. “It’s just an idyllic place to live. It’s a really nice place to live. It’s not some conspiracy theorist town,” they said. What’s happened – in any place [it would be] so far out of the ordinary. So it’s quite surreal really. Loss of colleagues has ‘struck at heart’ of Victoria police, chief commissioner says Victoria’s chief police commissioner, Mike Bush, has paid tribute to his two colleagues. This devastating loss of Neal and Vadim has struck at the heart of Victoria Police, the broader policing family and the community of Porepunkah. In the coming days, weeks and months, we will all grieve this loss and deeply miss our colleagues and friends who have paid the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. It is not lost on me that our members take a risk every time they go to work to protect the Victorian community. While we all live with the knowledge that the worst could happen on a shift, we don’t expect it to. Bush said in these “difficult times” it was “so important that our people stand together and support each other”. I have full confidence that we will all do this with dignity and respect. Victoria Police have named the officers who lost their lives in yesterday’s shooting as Detective Leading Senior Constable Neal Thompson, 59, and Senior Constable Vadim De Waart, 35. Thompson, who was on the verge of retirement, joined Victoria Police in 1987 and spent seven years in general duties at Collingwood police station before working as a detective at the Major Fraud Squad and the State Crime Squad. He took up his most recent post in the Wangaratta CIU in July 2007. In a statement, police said Neal was an adventurer and enjoyed all things outdoors. He loved getting out in nature, and his friends and colleagues regularly joined him on these trips. Neal had spent the past six years alongside his partner, Lisa, the love of his life. Since the pair met, Neal had found new purpose and was planning in earnest for his imminent retirement. Together with Lisa, Neal had built a new home and had a long list of tasks planned after he knocked off work for the last time. De Waart had only recently arrived in Wangaratta when the shooting occurred. He started his policing career at the Victoria Police Academy in late 2018 and worked for three years at St Kilda police station before joining PORT as a senior constable in April 2023. At the time of his passing, Vadim was on temporary assignment in Wangaratta. An eternal optimist and avid traveller, Vadim was fluent in French, Spanish, Flemish and English. He had also completed scuba dives all around the world and motorcycling trips more locally with his friends and colleagues. He was a keen gin collector and always picked up a local bottle on his overseas adventures for his large collection at home. While travelling was his passion, Vadim was extremely proud to have purchased his first home in Melbourne in recent years. He is survived by his parents Carolina and Alain, who live in his Belgium, his younger brother Sacha who lives in Switzerland and a number of relatives in Melbourne. ‘Where he is and how they’re gonna find him, that’s anyone’s guess’ Porepunkah is surrounded by bushland and pine plantations in the foothills of the alps, near the base of Mt Buffalo. Kealan Lee, who was driving through the town on his way home to Yarrawongah after a visit to the dentist, said it was a “pretty rugged” place. “I used to come up here 4WDing as a kid. There’s not much open space,” he said, adding: Even if they’re flying that helicopter, you’re not going to see much through the trees. They’ve got the CFA (Country Fire Authority) tracks, but they lock them off [and] you’d need a pretty serious 4WD to get up there. Where he is and how they’re gonna find him, that’s anyone’s guess. Sense of ‘edge in the air’ in Porepunkah, pub manager says Businesses in the Porepunkah area are remaining closed as the search continues for Freeman in Victoria’s high country. The venue manager of the Porepunkah Pub, Misty-Rose Wilson, lives on Mount Buffalo Road, which was “locked in and locked down” yesterday evening. She told ABC Radio Melbourne that she was among many of the pub’s staff who lived in the area and had been unable to leave their homes. At 6pm last night we received messages as residents letting us know … to lock your doors and stay inside. Since then we did have another message this morning that was a repeat of last night’s message. That’s basically all the communication we’ve had at this time. Something like this shocks a town like ours, we’re a really small, tight-knit community so there’s a sense of edge in the air. The Porepunkah Pub posted on social media, confirming it would follow advice from Victorian police to stay shut tonight. Our staff have been instructed not to leave their homes, and their safety, along with that of our guests and wider community, remains our top priority. Police stations servicing Porepunkah inundated with flowers, cards and messages of support Wodonga Police has thanked the community for the “overwhelming support” received as the force comes to terms with the deaths of two officers and the serious injury of another. The Wodonga police posted on social media: On behalf of everyone at Wodonga Police, we want to sincerely thank our community for the overwhelming support we have received following the tragic events of yesterday. The flowers, cards, and countless messages of kindness and sympathy mean more than words can express. In such a difficult time, it is deeply comforting to know we are surrounded by a community that stands with us. Your compassion and care are a reminder of the strength we have when we come together. The Wangaratta police similarly sent a “heartfelt thank you to everyone who has reached out with flowers, cards and messages of support after the tragic events involving our members yesterday”. This is a very difficult time for our police family here at Wangaratta, but knowing that our community is standing beside us truly means the world. Your kindness, compassion and care are giving us strength as we face the days ahead together. Wodonga and Wangaratta have the two largest police stations in the area, and both are about an hour’s drive from Porepunkah. Police block road leading to property where shooting took place Police have set up a roadblock on Mt Buffalo Road, not far from central Porepunkah. I’m here at the roadblock – along with most of the other media. It’s now raining heavily. We’re about 2 kms away from the start of Rayner Track, the road that leads to the property where the shooting took place. While Guardian Australia’s photographer, Stuart Walmsley, and I were able to drive right up to the entrance of the property earlier today, police now aren’t letting the media any further down the main road. The police haven’t provided any further details as to why they have blocked off the road, but we will update you as soon as we learn more. Victoria Police have released further information as they continue to search for Dezi Freeman. They say he was last seen running into the bush near a property on Rayner Track in Porepunkah at 10.30am yesterday, wearing “dark green (khaki) tracksuit pants, dark green rain jacket, brown Blundstone boots and reading glasses”. Police described him as Caucasian, 183cm tall, with a medium build and short dark hair. They said if anyone sees him or has any further information to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000: We continue to urge the public in and around the township of Porepunkah to remain indoors until further notice. We also ask people not to travel into the area. Police said Freeman also goes by Desmond Filby. They released an image of him: The minister for police, Anthony Carbines, was also visibly emotional when he made his statement to the lower house. He says: Every fortnight at the academy, new graduates pass through and they take an oath to serve and protect the community that they’re members of ... It’s very inspiring to see them make that commitment on behalf of all Victorians, and while they’re hurting and their families are hurting, they’re still on duty and working today, tonight, tomorrow and every day. There have also been updates from other ministers, including local government minister, Nick Staikos. He says the department of government services have been in contact with the Alpine Shire Council, who earlier today issued a plea for government support. Staikos says: [The department] will continue to work closely with council over the coming days to identify where additional support is needed, whether for council itself or directly to the community. This is a moment of sadness and shock, but also a time when people across our state come together to support each other. The education minister, Ben Carroll, says he has personally thanked the Porepunkah primary school principal, Jill Gillies, for helping keep students calm during a lockdown yesterday. Carroll says: Porepunkah has been around for more than 150 years, it is a close knit community and has a very long term teaching staff of 12. In Jill’s words to me this morning, she said they’re a brilliant bunch of adults. As these horrific events unfolded yesterday, Jill and her staff worked hard to make sure the students under their care were secure and safe. I want to thank Jill and her team for their calmness and their steadfast leadership. Carroll says the school will be provided with ongoing wellbeing support, including trauma counselling for any students, staff and affected families. Thanks for sticking with us so far today. Caitlin Cassidy will take over the blog from here. Take care. Victoria premier praises emergency services working days ‘among toughest our state has known’ The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has used question time to praise emergency services after the Porepunkah shooting and a fatal school bus crash this morning. She described the past 48 hours as “among the toughest our state has known”. Allan went on: In both of these tragedies, our emergency responders have been … at the scene of great heartbreak. They have carried out their duties in dangerous, confronting and deeply difficult conditions. And on behalf of everyone in this place, I want to thank them – Victoria police, paramedics, firefighters, SES workers and volunteers – for the courage, professionalism and great care they have shown through the most trying of circumstances. She said Victorians were grateful emergency responders continued to work to keep communities safe in “the most difficult, treacherous and dangerous of circumstances”. Each of us has a responsibility to walk beside them, to wrap our arms around them, to provide every support they need, not just now, for as long as it takes. This is a time of grief. It must also be a time of unity, a time to stand with these families, to stand with these communities, and also to stand with every member of Victoria police and every one of our emergency services. As the search continues in and around Porepunkah, near Mount Buffalo in Victoria’s high country, the weather bureau is forecasting a series of cold fronts could dump up to a metre of snow in the state’s alpine areas between now and Saturday. A series of cold fronts crossing south eastern Australia in the final week of winter were expected to culminate in flurries of snow across four states, including Victoria’s alpine areas, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. In Victoria, the chilly winds could see the snow level drop to 1,000m on Thursday and down to 600m on Friday. Subzero temperatures were forecast for alpine areas, which could see up to a metre of snow, between now and Saturday. The cold fronts could culminate in snowfall in some unusual places. In Victoria, this included the western parts of the Grampians, Macedon Ranges and the Dandenong Ranges in Melbourne’s east. Local mechanic describes Freeman as a ‘new age Ned Kelly’ Marty Robinson, who owns the mechanic shop in town, described Freeman as a “new age Ned Kelly” who was “pretty handy in the bush”. Standing on Porepunkah’s main street, gesturing up at the hills behind him, Robinson said the police “could be up there for weeks looking for” him. “He doesn’t fit in, and he doesn’t go along with the rules, and he’s an anti-vaxxer. That’s all probably true, but … he’s a family man”, he said. “I’m not saying he’s a hero or a legend, but he’s someone’s father.” Robinson said the day felt pretty normal to him and that Porepunkah remained a “sleepy little town”. “Life goes on. Just checked my mail; no bills, that’s good. I’m servicing a lady’s car. The show goes on,”he said. What do Porepunkah locals have to say about the ongoing manhunt? I’m in Porepunkah with photographer Stuart Walmsley, where we’ve been speaking with locals. It’s a rainy, grey day, and as you can imagine, most people would have remained indoors even if Victoria police hadn’t sent automated text messages to everyone warning them to stay home due to an “active armed offender in the general area”. Still, some people have left home to go to work, or ducked out to get a coffee or collect their mail, only to be met by journalists, photographers and camera crews, most of whom have driven up from Melbourne. Many locals have, understandably, been reluctant to speak to the media. Everyone we have spoken to who knew Dezi Freeman, who lived on a bush block at the end of a dirt road on the outskirts of town, has said he knew the land very well and that they thought it would be difficult to find him. Mayor of local council urges community to ‘continue to look after yourselves and each other’ Sarah Nicholas, the mayor of the Alpine Shire council, which includes Porepunkah, said the community extended its “deepest thanks to all frontline workers – especially Victoria police – for the extraordinary work they are doing to protect and support our community”. Nicholas told community members on social media they should take reassurance “in the fact that we are receiving the best of the best when it comes to police resourcing and expertise, with support from both state and interstate agencies”, adding: We know this event has had a significant emotional impact – particularly on our younger community members and their parents and carers, many of whom experienced lockdowns at schools and childcare centres yesterday. Please continue to look after yourselves and each other. If you or someone you know is struggling, reach out – help is available, and you are not alone. The suspected Porepunkah gunman, Dezi Freeman, did not own the property where the shootings took place. Guardian Australia has been unable to speak with the owners, a local couple. It is unclear if the couple had been living on the property with Freeman and his family, but they were not there at the time of the shootings. Attempts to contact the owners via social media and family members have been unsuccessful. Property records show that they sold a separate property in a nearby regional town earlier this year. The couple had operated a business selling chestnuts and appeared at local farmers’ markets. A man who also claimed to live at the property had parked his car over the driveway on Wednesday, preventing access beyond the front gate. The car had a note on the dashboard that read “left car here to prevent reporters to access private land. I live here” and included a phone number. The man declined to comment, but when asked if he had spoken to the owners of the property, he responded that “everything was under control”. Aircraft banned from flying above Porepunkah No aircraft will be allowed to fly around Porepunkah after the Australian Transport Safety Bureau granted the area “Temporary Restricted Airspace”. Victoria police said the no-fly zone, which includes all aircraft and drones, was within a 4 nautical mile (about 7.5km) radius of 6619 Great Alpine Road, Porepunkah (Feathertop Winery) and would be in place until at least 11.30pm on Friday. Police said: Given the suspect in this matter is heavily armed, this condition has been granted due to the risk to aircraft and drones, as well as potential implications associated with the suspect tracking police movements based off media coverage. The Australian federal police warned violent sovereign citizens could become an enduring part of the “threat landscape” in an unclassified 2022 briefing released under freedom of information laws. The suspected Porepunkah gunman, Dezi Freeman, has been described as a sovereign citizen. Like many others within the movement, he appeared to become radicalised during the early years of the pandemic, railing against lockdowns and vaccine mandates, which were seen as reinforcing his conspiratorial beliefs about governments. The AFP, in a briefing released under freedom of information laws in 2023, said it remained to be seen how the end of the pandemic would shift the behaviour of this group. Stephen Dametto, the acting assistant commissioner of counter-terrorism and special investigations, wrote in the presentation: What we’ve learned is while these groups present and behave very differently to other extremist groups, there is an underlying capacity to inspire violence. As COVID-based restrictions and mandates begin dissipating around the country, time will tell whether we see these movements fade into obscurity or whether they become a more enduring fixture of the threat landscape in Australia. Dametto also stated in the briefing that: SovCits see violence as a last resort or only necessary in the form of ‘self-defence’ against a tyrannical government. This however, does not mean that these groups can’t be dangerous. Some photos from Porepunkah A massive police operation is under way in the small town of Porepunkah, home to about 1,000 people. Guardian Australia has a photographer on the ground as the man hunt continues. Support from colleagues ‘the best medicine’ for injured officer, head of police association says Wayne Gatt, the head of the Victoria Police Association, said he spoke to the officer who was seriously injured yesterday. Gatt told RN Breakfast earlier the man was “clearly devastated” by the events, and had to deal with his own recovery while mourning the loss of his colleagues: I can only imagine how he’s feeling. He’s having to deal with that at the same time as dealing with his physical injuries, which I know he received some treatment for yesterday. And I just hope that his continued recovery is faster. I know some of his colleagues have had some messages from him this morning, which is great. It’s great to see because the best medicine is the support of your colleagues. It works for us. I don’t know, it might be a police thing … but it does work for us knowing that the policing community is supporting you. And I’m sure that will be, in no small dose, something that he’s drawing heavily on. Legal sources have told Guardian Australia that the senior officer who was killed, a 59-year-old detective, was particularly well regarded in the region for his kindness and fairness. “He was just a lovely bloke, it’s a tragedy,” one lawyer said. He was so close to retiring, he’d booked tickets for an overseas holiday and everything. Awful stuff. The same lawyer had regularly seen Dezi Freeman around the Wangaratta courts, though never represented him or dealt with him. Freeman often represented himself in court. “He was certainly a frequent flyer, that’s for sure,” the lawyer said. Victoria police commissioner Mike Bush addresses media amid search for Porepunkah shooting suspect – video Police have a “wide cordon” set up as part of a “very wide search area” for Dezi Freeman, Victoria police chief commissioner, Mike Bush, told reporters on Wednesday morning. “We are pouring every resource into this search for this person.” Head of Victoria police association says members ‘enormously sad’ after death of colleagues Wayne Gatt, secretary of the Victoria Police Association, said earlier this morning the group’s members were all “enormously sad” after yesterday’s events at Porepunkah. Gatt told RN Breakfast: I mean, I don’t know if there’s an easier way to describe it. They’re all people underneath that uniform, and they’re just enormously sad … Hundreds of them are having to suppress the way they’re feeling emotionally as they turn up to work and really get on with this dangerous, but so important, job of holding this offender to account. Albanese says government takes threat of sovereign citizen ideology seriously The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said the federal government takes seriously the threat of ideologies like sovereign citizenship. He was asked about the government’s consideration of fringe movements on ABC Radio Melbourne this morning: Mike Burgess, the director general of Asio, has been warning about far-right extremism. We have seen that spread and it is difficult to defend against individuals. We know that that is the case, that this person, Dezi Freeman, who remains on the run is the latest advice that we have received, has [allegedly] engaged in an attack in which two police officers have lost their lives, a third has been seriously injured. Bush said earlier the 10 officers who attended Freeman’s property were there to execute a warrant related to the Sexual Offences and Child Abuse Investigation teams, known as Socit. He told reporters: So the team that went there were local officers and members of the sexual offences and child investigation team. I’m not going to go into any further detail, because there are victims involved in the matter and it would be very unfair and unwise for me to talk about that any further. Injured officer will recover, but has ‘significant’ injuries Bush said he hopes to visit the officer injured in the shooting yesterday, saying he believes they are out of surgery but “significantly damaged”. He said the officer will recover, but more information on their condition will come later. Bush said police believe Freeman is thought to understand “bushcraft well”, presenting a challenge for those searching for him: Our understanding of him is he understands bushcraft well, which provides a challenge for us. But we keep an absolutely open mind on what options are open to him. And those options will inform our approach. Authorities conducting a manhunt overnight did so in difficult weather conditions. But Bush said the team was “absolutely determined and focused on finding this person.” They are oblivious to those conditions when they have a mission. Freeman thought to have ‘multiple firearms’ Bush said police believe Freeman has many weapons with him: Long arms, powerful firearms, multiple firearms. We haven’t recovered any of his firearms from the scene. Police have ‘wide cordon’ set up as part of ‘very wide search area’ Bush said the best experts in the country are doing “everything” they can to find Freeman. Authorities have not had any confirmed sightings of him since yesterday’s events. We have all the assets in play. We have not had any confirmed site sightings of him at the moment … Anything is possible. He knows that area, even though we have experts in the area, he will know that area better than us. So, that’s why we’re putting in every expert and supported by local knowledge as well. Bush added Victoria police had spoken with their counterparts in NSW, who are on standby if needed. The chief commissioner of Victoria police, Mike Bush, said Freeman, 56, is “heavily armed” and still at large. Bush said a “large team” were “absolutely focused” on finding the suspect: We are pouring every resource into this search for this person, we must find him … The hunt will continue until we find him. Bush said there was no hostage situation. Porepunkah shooting suspect Dezi Freeman called police ‘terrorist thugs’ and tried to arrest magistrate, court records reveal Dezi Freeman, the man suspected of shooting and killing two police officers and injuring a third at a rural Victorian property, has previously called police “terrorist thugs” and has a history of association with pseudolaw and “sovereign citizen” ideas. Court records show Freeman has previously described police as “frigging Nazis”, “Gestapo” and “terrorist thugs”. He also once attempted to arrest a magistrate during a bizarre court hearing in Wangaratta. Last year, a Victorian county court judge found Freeman was guilty of using a mobile phone while driving and refusing to provide a saliva sample to police in September 2020 on the Great Alpine Road. But he lodged a legal battle after the judge cancelled Freeman’s licence and disqualified him from obtaining a licence for a period of two years from 8 April 2024. Read more: Federal MP for Porepunkah area says extreme ideologies ‘have no place in Australia’ Federal MP Helen Haines, the local member for Indi, which covers the Porepunkah area, said her community is “completely shocked and devastated” after yesterday’s events. Haines told ABC News: There is so much grief and disbelief and frankly horror at what has unfolded in Porepunkah … I think the Victorian government are doing everything they can and I know that the Victoria police and emergency services are throwing every resource at this issue to find and apprehend this offender. I can’t ask for more than that, and right now that is the priority. Haines said it was still an active event and while police would take time to understand the motivation behind the shooting, extreme ideologies had “no place in Australia”. The law of this land applies to everyone, irrespective of what ideology a person may or may not subscribe to. We were warned last year around the rise of various ideologies and the real risk it poses to civil society. But in this case, again we have an active event happening right now in Porepunkah with police and emergency services trying to apprehend this offender. And until this person is brought in, we won’t know exactly what has motivated this person. But whichever way you look at it, extreme ideologies have no place in Australia. Police to address media in Melbourne Victoria police are set to hold a media conference on the latest information out of Porepunkah in a few minutes, at 8.30am. We’ll carry the latest updates as they come through. Sussan Ley pays tribute to slain Porepunkah police officers The opposition leader, Sussan Ley, has paid tribute to two police officers killed at Porepunkah yesterday. She called the shooting “a heartbreaking tragedy that has touched every Australian”. “These officers gave their lives protecting their community, and our nation grieves deeply with their families, friends and colleagues. This loss is a solemn reminder of the dangers police face each day and the extraordinary courage it takes to serve,” Ley said in a statement. To every officer who wears the uniform, you carry our respect and our gratitude. Ley also spoke of the detective who was left injured, and other police responding to the incident in the rural Victorian town. In this moment of profound sadness, Australians stand shoulder to shoulder with Victoria Police. We will honour those who have fallen and never take for granted the courage and service that keeps our communities safe. AFP and Asio assisting with investigation, says home affairs minister The home affairs minister, Tony Burke, said this morning that both the Australian federal police and Asio are assisting with the investigation in Porepunkah. Andrew Hastie says society has seen a ‘breakdown in trust’ in governments since pandemic The shadow home affairs minister, Andrew Hastie, was asked on RN Breakfast about the concern surrounding fringe ideologies spreading through society. He said those ideas spark a real concern: I think since Covid, we’ve seen a breakdown in trust for governments, whether it be state or national governments. And so we have to work extra hard to win the trust of those we represent. There is no excuse ever for violence in this country, particularly of the sort that we saw yesterday, which claimed the lives of two police officers. … I think social cohesion is more frayed than ever. There’s more misinformation and disinformation out there. A lot of people went down the rabbit hole during Covid and they never came back up. Porepunkah primary school to remain closed today The local primary school in Porepunkah will not open today on the advice of Victoria police, Allan said earlier: The advice is that the request for the community to continue to remain indoors. The advice I have is the school, the primary school will not be open today as well. And this is all based on the advice of Victoria police and I urge everyone in the community to follow that advice. Victoria premier says ‘a lot of people feeling a deep grief today’ The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, just spoke to ABC News, saying “every resource” was currently devoted to the manhunt, but said it has been a difficult few days for the community in Porepunkah. She said: While we wait for further details to come from Victoria police, we put our arms around the Victoria police family. A lot of people are feeling deep grief today and they’re also going to work today to keep our communities safe. So it’s been … it was an incredibly tragic day yesterday and it continues to be a tough one today … What happened yesterday was a tragedy. But also a hideous crime that was perpetrated on those who go to work every day to keep us safe. And that makes it even more awful and horrific. The suspect behind the shooting of three police officers, two of whom are dead, in Porepunkah, Victoria, is still on the run. Police said the man’s family, including his partner and his children, attended a local police station last night, but the man’s whereabouts remain unknown as a massive search continues today. The town of Porepunkah is about 300km north-east of Melbourne and police are combing dense bushland as part of their search. But residents of the town and surrounding areas are being urged to remain indoors until further notice. We’ll bring you more updates as the day moves along.
