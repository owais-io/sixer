  After Sydney’s soggiest start to August in nearly three decades, even more
  rain could be on the way, with a wetter than usual spring forecast for eastern
  New South Wales. Only 11 days into August, rainfall in the city had reached
  194mm – more than double the monthly average – marking the wettest start to
  the month since 1998, according to Weatherzone. Moist onshore winds had
  delivered a weekend washout, and so much rain the Byron writers’ festival had
  to be called off, as 90,0000 runners in Sydney’s City2Surf persevered in spite
  of the slippery conditions. Along or near much of the NSW coastline – from the
  Illawarra to Sydney, the Hunter, mid-north coast and some parts of the north
  coast – totals had already hit or exceeded the monthly average, said Jonathan
  How, a senior meteorologist at the Bureau of Meteorology. Abnormally high sea
  surface temperatures off the state’s coast had contributed to the wet
  conditions, he said, boosting the moisture content of clouds, as a persistent
  high-pressure system over New Zealand kept pushing rain and moisture on to the
  coast. The wet start to August followed a wetter than usual July, in which
  several places recorded their highest July rain on record. And eight months
  into 2025, Sydney was already tracking wetter than average, said How. That
  came off the back of three out of four years with rainfall well above average,
  including 2022 – the city’s wettest on record. Sign up: AU Breaking News email
  The NSW east coast was generally “quite a wet place”, said University of
  Melbourne associate professor Andrew King, but for many residents –
  particularly from the mid-north coast upwards – this year had been rainier
  than usual. “We have seen some really major rain events this year,” he said.
  Several places recorded their wettest May on record, when a low-pressure
  trough developed off the coast of NSW on 18 May and lingered for days. King
  said the NSW coastline was subject to various types of systems that created
  the conditions for rising air, condensation and rain – thunderstorms, fronts
  from the west, winds from the east bringing coastal showers and east coast
  lows – all of which could bring heavy rainfall to the eastern coast of NSW,
  including Sydney. In an average year, Sydney received more than a metre
  (1,044mm) of rain, roughly double the amount that falls in Melbourne (518mm),
  Adelaide (547mm) and Hobart (569mm), according to Bureau of Meteorology
  climate data for 1981-2010. Sydney was the third-wettest capital city after
  Darwin and Brisbane. But that wasn’t the whole picture, How said. August had
  been a completely different story inland. It was very wet in the east, but
  also very dry in the west, with many places receiving “next to no rainfall so
  far this month”. The Bureau’s long-range forecast for September to November
  anticipated above-average rainfall would continue for the eastern two-thirds
  of Australia, with an increased chance of unusually high rainfall (in the
  highest 20% of records between 1981 and 2018) for parts of eastern Queensland,
  NSW, south-east SA and northern Victoria. With northern Australia expected to
  get wetter, and the south-west of the country drier due to global heating, the
  projections for rainfall in NSW weren’t as clearcut, King said. At least in
  the short term – for the week ahead – Sydneysiders could at least look forward
  to one or two fine days. “The good news is that the heaviest of the rain is
  now behind us,” How said, with drier days returning and Friday likely to be
  the “pick of the week”.
