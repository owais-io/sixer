  At the Downing Street lobby briefing yesterday the PM’s spokesperson was
  reluctant to comment directly on the arrest of Graham Linehan. But he did say
  that Keir Starmer thought the police should be focusing on “antisocial
  behaviour, shoplifting, street crime, as well as reducing serious violent
  crimes like knife crime and violence against women”. The Daily Telegraph has
  interepreted that as an attack on the Met. Wes Streeting, the health
  secretary, was on the media round this morning and in some respects he adopted
  the same line. Asked about the arrest, he told Times Radio: I think the prime
  minister and the home secretary have been very clear that with the law and
  order challenges we’ve got in our country, we want to see people being kept
  safe by policing streets, not just policing tweets. But Streeting also made a
  different argument, pointing out that the police were only enforcing laws
  passed by parliament and that, if MPs felt their actions were excessive, they
  needed to change the law. He told Times Radio: One thing I would say, because
  it’s always easy for people to criticise the police, the police enforce the
  laws of the land that we as legislators provide. So if we’re not getting the
  balance right then that’s something that we all have to look at and consider …
  If the police are enforcing things that we think are a waste of time or a
  distraction from more important things, that’s on us to sort out. On the Today
  programme, about an hour later, Streeting went even further, implying that
  hate speech laws were too strict. He said they had “unintended consequences”
  and that MPs were “quite anxious” about how they were being enforced. He told
  the programme: I’m very glad that we live in a country where we come down like
  a tonne of bricks on racism and discrimination. That is the right thing to do
  … There have always been legitimate boundaries when it comes to which is about
  protecting others from harm. Sometimes those boundaries and those lines are
  blurred, and we are talking shades of grey, rather than black and white.
  That’s why this is complicated. It’s complicated for legislators, and it is
  hard for the police sometimes, because they they have to apply the law as it
  is written, not the law as sometimes it was intended. And honestly, this is
  why sometimes when we have debates in parliament, it can be quite tricky when
  campaigners are saying vote for this clause or that clause, because often
  people legislate with good intentions, but they also have to be mindful of
  unintended consequences. And I think we are all, let’s be honest, quite
  anxious about some of the cases we’ve seen in the media, or proceed through
  the courts, of what people have said online, where you think, was that really
  what parliament intended when they passed these laws? Streeting may have been
  referring to the Lucy Connolly case, which Nigel Farage is expected to discuss
  when he testifies on Capitol Hill later. It was not clear from Streeting’s
  interview whether the health secretary was reflecting concerns felt more
  widely in government, or whether he was just freelancing. Quite possibly it
  was the latter. Streeting is much more inclined than other ministers to
  actually answer questions in interviews, and say what he thinks. Keir Starmer
  and Yvette Cooper (who as home secretary, unlike Streeting, is actually
  responsible for law and order policy) have not talked about the need to revise
  hate speech laws. But Streeting also has a good feel for where the political
  debate is heading. If ministers were not thinkig about revising hate speech
  laws, they might be a bit more inclined to have that debate now. Richard
  Partington is the Guardian’s senior economics correspondent. Rachel Reeves’s
  autumn budget will take place on 26 November, the Treasury has announced, amid
  mounting speculation over tax increases. With the government under pressure on
  the economy, the chancellor has previously said measures designed to reboot
  growth would form the basis of her highly anticipated tax and spending plans.
  The late November budget date will give Reeves time to prepare the ground for
  potential tax changes, raising the prospect of a high-stakes party conference
  season as Labour heads to Liverpool at the end of September. Reeves is
  understood to have been exploring several revenue-raising measures over the
  summer months amid concern that rising borrowing costs, a sluggish growth
  outlook, higher inflation and welfare U-turns could expose a shortfall in the
  government finances worth up to £40bn. The chancellor and the prime minister
  have, however, committed to sticking to Labour’s manifesto promise not to
  raise taxes on “working people”, including through income tax, national
  insurance and VAT. Reeves has come under pressure from leftwing Labour MPs and
  campaigners to consider introducing a wealth tax. While the chancellor has
  privately ruled out such a step, she has been exploring options for raising
  more money from wealthier taxpayers, including changes to capital gains tax,
  as well as inheritance and property levies. Announcing the date of the budget,
  the Treasury said Reeves had commissioned the Office for Budget Responsibility
  to prepare forecasts for the economy and public finances. The chancellor must
  give the independent watchdog 10 weeks’ notice. There are hopes in the
  Treasury that news from Britain’s economy could improve before budget day,
  helping the chancellor to strike a more upbeat tone after a difficult first
  year in power for Labour. Reeves could benefit from updated International
  Monetary Fund forecasts at its annual meeting in Washington in mid-October.
  Good morning. It is the first PMQs since July, and with the government set to
  announce the date of the budget today (Wednesday 26 November, if HuffPost UK
  is right), you would expect Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch to get stuck into a
  debate about the economy, and taxation. But it might end up as a free speech
  day at Westminster, as a result of the conflation of two related issues.
  First, Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, is in Washington where he is giving
  evidence to the House judiciary committee on “Europe’s Threat to American
  Speech and Innovation”. The committee wants to talk about the Online Safety
  Act, which is opposed by American tech companies who fear it will lead to them
  facing excessive fines, or even jail sentences, for not complying with UK
  content regulations deemed unnecessarily strict in the US. And, second, the
  arrest yesterday of Graham Linehan, the Irish comedy writer, by five police
  officers at Heathrow over anti-trans posts on social media has reignited the
  debate about hate speech laws in the UK, and whether they are being enforced
  too rigorously by the police. Linehan was arrested on suspicion of inciting
  violence – which is nothing to do with the Online Safety Act – but the two
  issues are bound to be linked, not least by Farage. According to a report by
  Harry Cole in the Sun, in written evidence to the House judiciary committee
  ahead of today’s hearing Farage argued that Britain is now subject to an
  “illiberal and authoritarian censorship regime”. Farage said: On the question
  of civil liberties, Britain has, unfortunately, now lost her way. I will do my
  part, as a participant in UK democracy, to help our country find its way back
  to the traditional freedoms which have long bound together our two countries
  in friendship. In the meantime, Congress should draw bright lines: British
  free speech rules, applicable to Britons, are made in Britain, and American
  speech rules, applicable to Americans, are made in America. Somewhere on this
  planet of ours, innovators must remain free to build the next generation of
  platforms without being hamstrung by illiberal and authoritarian censorship
  regimes that are alien to both American and traditionally British values.
  Right now, that place is America. Those of us in the UK will do what we can to
  make Britain such a place as well. Cole says Farage has also suggested that
  the US should use “diplomacy and trade” (ie, the threat of sanctions) to
  resist UK and EU laws that threaten American tech companies. This could open
  Farage up to the charge of acting against the national interest, but it is not
  clear yet how far he will push this in the hearing. Obviously, if the House
  judiciary committtee is really worried about threats to “American speech”, you
  could argue that it would do better investigating a White House administration
  that deports students who criticise Israel, insists on checking people’s
  social media posts before it allows them into the country, uses bogus legal
  challenges to extort money from media organisations that have criticised the
  president and bans journalists from the press pool for calling the Gulf of
  Mexico the Gulf of Mexico. But the Republican-led committee does not seem too
  bothered about all that. And, if Reform UK is serious about free speech, it
  would be nice to hear Farage asked about Reform-led Nottinghamshire county
  council refusing to talk to the Nottingham Post because of its critical media
  coverage. That is not likely to be on the agenda in Washington either. But it
  may get a mention at PMQs. Here is the agenda for the day. 10.30am: Shabana
  Mahmood, the justice secretary, gives evidence to the Lords constitution
  committee on the rule of law. Noon: Keir Starmer faces Kemi Badenoch at PMQs.
  Afternoon: John Swinney, Scotland’s first minister, makes a statement to MSPs
  at Holyrood about Gaza. Afternoon: Stamer has a meeting with his Spanish
  counterpart, Pedro Sánchez, in Downing Street. 3pm: Nigel Farage, the Reform
  UK leader, gives evidence to the House of Representative’s judiciary committee
  in Washington about freedom of speech in the UK. If you want to contact me,
  please post a message below the line when comments are open (normally between
  10am and 3pm at the moment), or message me on social media. I can’t read all
  the messages BTL, but if you put “Andrew” in a message aimed at me, I am more
  likely to see it because I search for posts containing that word. If you want
  to flag something up urgently, it is best to use social media. You can reach
  me on Bluesky at @andrewsparrowgdn.bsky.social. The Guardian has given up
  posting from its official accounts on X, but individual Guardian journalists
  are there, I still have my account, and if you message me there at
  @AndrewSparrow, I will see it and respond if necessary. I find it very helpful
  when readers point out mistakes, even minor typos. No error is too small to
  correct. And I find your questions very interesting too. I can’t promise to
  reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either BTL or
  sometimes in the blog.
