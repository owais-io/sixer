  The Oregon city at the heart of a major US supreme court homelessness ruling
  has agreed to ensure camping spaces for at least 150 people as part of a
  settlement reached with a disability rights group that sued the city over its
  camping rules. Disability Rights Oregon, which sued Grants Pass in January,
  said on Friday that it had reached a settlement agreement. The advocacy group
  accused the city of discriminating against people with disabilities and
  violating a state law requiring cities’ camping regulations to be “objectively
  reasonable”. Grants Pass has received national attention for its efforts to
  ticket and prosecute unhoused people sleeping outside. The city’s legal battle
  resulted in a supreme court ruling dictating that local governments across the
  US can criminalize camping even when there is no shelter available for the
  homeless population. “This settlement represents a significant step forward in
  ensuring people with disabilities experiencing homelessness have places to
  rest, basic necessities like drinking water, and real opportunity to stabilize
  their lives,” Jake Cornett, executive director and CEO of Disability Rights
  Oregon, said in a statement. Grants Pass mayor, Clint Scherf, said in an email
  on Tuesday that the city appreciates having reached an agreement and will
  “continue to work toward effective measures to benefit all members of our
  community”. A copy of the settlement agreement showed the city signed off on
  it earlier this month. Josephine county circuit court judge Sarah McGlaughlin
  issued a preliminary injunction in March blocking the city from enforcing its
  camping rules unless it increased capacity at city-approved sites for camping
  and ensured they are physically accessible to people with disabilities. City
  ordinances prohibit sleeping or leaving personal property in a park overnight
  in most cases. Those found in violation can be fined up to $50. The city said
  Friday on Facebook that law enforcement “will begin noticing the parks, and
  occupants will have 72 hours to remove their belongings”. The city’s website
  shows three “designated resting locations” in the downtown area, near City
  Hall and the police station, where people can stay for four days before having
  to relocate. The time limit can be enforced unless disability accommodations
  are necessary, the city said on Facebook. At resting sites, individuals are
  limited to spaces that are 8ft by 8ft (2.4 metres by 2.4 metres), with buffers
  of 3ft (0.9 metres) between spaces, as outlined in city code. Under the
  settlement, Grants Pass must ensure that at least 150 camping spaces are
  available in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act for the next
  12 months. Drinking water and hand washing stations must be available on-site.
  The city must also provide $60,000 in grant funding to a non-profit for
  homeless services. Grants Pass, a small city of about 40,000 along the Rogue
  River in the mountains of southern Oregon, has struggled for years to address
  the homelessness crisis and become emblematic of the national debate over how
  to deal with it. Its parks in particular became a flashpoint, with many of
  them becoming the site of encampments blighted by drug use and litter. Last
  June, in a case brought by the city, the US supreme court ruled communities
  can ban sleeping outside and fine people for doing so, even when there are not
  enough shelter beds. After the high court ruling, Grants Pass banned camping
  on all city property except locations designated by the city council, which
  established sites for the town’s hundreds of homeless people in a bid to move
  them from the parks. Upon taking office in January, the new mayor and new
  council members moved to close the larger of the two sites, which housed
  roughly 120 tents, according to Disability Rights Oregon’s complaint, which
  said the sites were frequently crowded with poor conditions and inaccessible
  to people with disabilities because of loose gravel. After the lawsuit was
  filed, the city reopened a second, smaller site. McGlaughin’s order in March
  said the city had to increase capacity to what it had been before the larger
  site was closed. Elsewhere, the California city of San Jose is similarly
  planning to open sanctioned camping sites in addition to the “safe parking” it
  offers for people who live in vehicles such as RVs. The city of San Rafael,
  also in the San Francisco Bay Area, also has a sanctioned camping program.
  Homelessness increased 18% last year nationwide, driven mostly by a lack of
  affordable housing as well as devastating natural disasters and an increase in
  migrants in some areas.
