  Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah and Arsenal’s Mariona Caldentey have won the 2025
  awards for the Professional Footballers’ Association players’ player of the
  year. Salah becomes the first player to collect the prestigious men’s award
  three times. It would have been a shock had the Egypt forward not triumphed on
  Tuesday night at the ceremony in Manchester, given he scored 29 Premier League
  goals and created a further 18 as Liverpool won the title last season, the
  33-year-old enjoying one of his very best campaigns of an already gilded
  career. Salah said: “I look at myself now, a guy coming from Egypt and making
  it to the top level, making history today, it’s something that makes me so
  proud.” Caldentey also shone in her first season as an Arsenal player, with
  the Spain forward helping the club to end an 18-year wait for European glory
  by defeating her former team Barcelona in the Champions League final in
  Lisbon. Along the way, Caldentey scored 19 times in all competitions,
  including seven Champions League goals. She becomes the third Arsenal player
  to receive the PFA women’s award, following in the footsteps of Kim Little in
  2013 and Vivianne Miedema in 2019. Caldentey spent July this year in
  Switzerland, starring for Spain at Euro 2025. She scored the opening goal in
  the final against England in Basel before ending with a runners-up medal after
  the Lionesses prevailed on penalties. “Everyone at the club has made it so
  easy for me and they helped me from the start and it just feels like home and
  I’m happy to be here,” Caldentey said. “If you ask me my position I don’t know
  what to answer, but I just enjoy it on the pitch and I just want to help my
  teammates. They’ve made everything so easy for me so it has been an incredible
  pleasure.” Caldentey’s new Arsenal teammate Olivia Smith is the women’s young
  player of the year, with the equivalent men’s award going to Aston Villa’s
  Morgan Rogers. Smith, a 21-year-old Canada forward, became the most expensive
  signing in women’s football history when she arrived in north London from
  Liverpool for £1m last month. Smith scored seven goals in 20 appearances last
  season and collected a series of player-of-the-year awards on Merseyside.
  Rogers turned 23 last month and is already a senior England international
  after scoring 14 goals in 54 appearances in all competitions for Villa last
  season. James Trafford has become the first goalkeeper to win the Championship
  player of the year award after keeping 29 clean sheets and conceding only 16
  league goals as Burnley were promoted from the second tier. No player has
  registered more clean sheets or conceded fewer goals during a season in the
  Football League’s history and it is no surprise that Trafford’s excellence
  prompted his recent return to Manchester City. Overall, though, it was very
  much a night for strikers, with Richard Kone collecting the League One honour
  for the attacking performances for Wycombe that led to him moving to Queens
  Park Rangers. Bromley’s prolific forward Michael Cheek received the League Two
  prize, while there were special merit awards for the former England manager
  Sir Gareth Southgate and the USA head coach, Emma Hayes.
