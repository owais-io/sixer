  The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, announced on Thursday that the man facing
  a felony assault charge for allegedly throwing a sandwich at a federal law
  enforcement officer in Washington DC worked at the Department of Justice. In a
  statement posted on social media, Bondi said that the man, identified in court
  documents as 37-year-old Sean Charles Dunn, has since been fired. “If you
  touch any law enforcement officer, we will come after you. I just learned that
  this defendant worked at the Department of Justice – NO LONGER. Not only is he
  FIRED, he has been charged with a felony,” Bondi wrote. “This is an example of
  the Deep State we have been up against for seven months as we work to refocus
  DOJ. You will NOT work in this administration while disrespecting our
  government and law enforcement.” Dunn served as an international affairs
  specialist in the criminal division of the office of international affairs at
  the Department of Justice, according to CNN. On Wednesday night, the FBI
  director, Kash Patel, said that Dunn had been charged with felony assault on a
  federal officer. In court documents, authorities say that the incident
  occurred on Sunday night on 14th Street in north-west DC. They say that Dunn
  approached and confronted a group of US Customs and Border Protection officers
  who were patrolling the area. Authorities claim that Dunn pointed his finger
  in an officer’s face and yelled, “Fuck you! You fucking fascists! Why are you
  here? I don’t want you in my city,” before “winding his arm back and
  forcefully throwing sub-style sandwich” at an officer. Authorities said that
  Dunn then attempted to flee on foot but was apprehended. During processing,
  authorities say that Dunn confessed to the incident and told the officers, “I
  did it. I threw a sandwich,” according to court documents. The incident was
  captured on video, which has since gone viral. In the footage, a man can be
  seen yelling “You see these fascists? Fuck you!” and “Shame!” at a group of
  officers patrolling the area before throwing a wrapped sub-style sandwich at
  one of them. He is then chased by the officers. The US attorney for the
  District of Columbia, Jeanine Pirro, who was recently confirmed to the
  position, announced the charges against Dunn on Wednesday. “This guy thought
  it was funny – well, he doesn’t think it’s funny today, because we charged him
  with a felony,” the former Fox News host said. The incident came several days
  after Donald Trump ordered federal officers to start sweeping the streets of
  Washington DC, in what the White House said was part of an effort to crack
  down on violent crime, despite statistics showing that the city’s violent
  crime rate hit a 30-year low in 2024. On Monday, one day after the sandwich
  incident, Trump announced that he was deploying the national guard in
  Washington DC and seizing control of the city’s police force. National guard
  troops began deploying across the city on Tuesday night.
