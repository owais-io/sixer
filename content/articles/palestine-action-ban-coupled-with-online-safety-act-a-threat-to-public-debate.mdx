  debate’

  The Online Safety Act together with the proscription of Palestine Action could
  result in platforms censoring Palestinian-related content, human rights
  organisations have warned. Open Rights Group, Index on Censorship and others
  have written to Ofcom calling on it to provide clear guidance to platforms on
  distinguishing lawful expression from content deemed to be in support of
  terrorism. They say failure to act by the regulator risks misidentification –
  including through algorithms – of support for Palestine as support for
  Palestine Action, which on 5 July became the first direct action protest group
  to be banned under UK anti-terrorism laws. It also runs the risk of
  misidentifying objections to Palestine Action’s proscription as unlawful
  support for the group, the signatories claim. Sara Chitseko, a pre-crime
  programme manager at Open Rights Group, said: “Crucial public debate about
  Gaza is being threatened by vague, overly broad laws that could lead to
  content about Palestine being removed or hidden online. There’s also a real
  danger that people will start self-censoring, worried they might be breaking
  the law just by sharing or liking posts related to Palestine and non-violent
  direct action. “This is a serious attack on freedom of expression and the
  right to protest in the UK. We need to ensure that people can share content
  about Palestine online without being afraid that they will be characterised as
  supportive of terrorism.” The organisations’ concerns are exacerbated by
  Ofcom’s advice that platforms can avoid worrying about their duties under the
  Online Safety Act (OSA) if they ensure they are more censorious than the act
  requires. “This approach risks encouraging automated moderation that
  disproportionately affects political speech, particularly from marginalised
  communities, including Palestinian voices,” the letter says. Unlike in the EU,
  there is no independent mechanism for people in the UK to challenge content
  they feel has been wrongly taken down. The signatories want platforms – the
  letter has also been sent to Meta, Alphabet, X and ByteDance – to commit to an
  independent dispute mechanism, if evidence emerges of lawful speech being
  suppressed. The letter, also signed by Electronic Frontier Foundation in the
  US and organisations from eight European countries, as well as experts and
  academics, says: “We are concerned that the proscription of Palestine Action
  may result in an escalation of platforms removing content, using algorithms to
  hide Palestine solidarity posts and leave individuals and those reporting on
  events vulnerable to surveillance or even criminalisation for simply sharing
  or liking content that references non-violent direct action. “We are also
  concerned about what platforms understand by their legal duties regarding
  expressions of ‘support’ for Palestine Action.” The letter comes a week after
  the OSA’s age-gating for “adult” material came into effect, prompting fears
  about access to Palestine-related content. For example, Reddit users in the UK
  have to verify their age to access the Reddit sub r/israelexposed. Ella
  Jakubowska, the head of policy at EDRi in Brussels, said there would
  inevitably be suppression of “critical voices, journalism and social movements
  around the world. The problem is worsened by automated content moderation
  systems, well known for over-removing content from Palestinian creators, in
  support of Black Lives Matter, about LGBTQI+ issues and more. “It is very
  likely that in trying to comply with these requirements, platforms would
  unjustly remove content from people in the EU and other regions.” She said
  that would contravene laws such as the EU Digital Services Act, designed to
  strike a balance between keeping people safe online and freedom of expression.
  An Ofcom spokesperson said: “We have provided detailed guidance to platforms
  about how to identify the particular types of illegal and harmful material
  prohibited or restricted by the act, including how to determine whether
  content may have been posted by a proscribed organisation. “There is no
  requirement on companies to restrict legal content for adult users. In fact,
  they must carefully consider how they protect users’ rights to freedom of
  expression while keeping people safe.” Meta, Alphabet, X and ByteDance were
  all approached for comment.
