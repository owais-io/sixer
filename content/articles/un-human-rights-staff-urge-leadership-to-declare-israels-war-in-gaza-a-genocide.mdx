  Hundreds of employees of the United Nations’ leading human rights agency have
  backed an internal letter telling its leadership to declare Israel’s offensive
  in Gaza a genocide and to call on UN member states to suspend arms sales to
  Israel. The 1,100-word letter, signed by about a quarter of the 2,000 staff of
  the Geneva- and New York-based Office of the High Commissioner for Human
  Rights (OHCHR), says the Israeli offensive in Gaza meets the legal threshold
  of genocide and that this means “arms sales, transfers and related logistical
  or financial support to Israeli authorities” constitutes a clear breach of
  international law by all those involved. OHCHR employees told the Guardian
  they were frustrated with the failure of agency’s head, Volker Türk, to “move
  beyond condemning Israel”. “The messaging has been the same for almost two
  years. Criticising Israel is not enough. He needs to be saying exactly what
  steps member states need to take to meet their obligations to prevent genocide
  and very firmly pointing out the legal consequences for leaders, officials and
  private businesses if they don’t,” said one staff member who signed the
  letter. Another praised Türk’s criticism of Israel for grave breaches of
  international law and apparent war crimes but charged that the decision to
  avoid clearer public statements about genocide was “a political not a legal
  choice”. The letter, seen by the Guardian, says that based on the “available
  evidence and authoritative assessments by the UN-appointed experts, as well as
  legal and [international humanitarian law] professionals, the legal threshold
  [for genocide] has been met. [We] therefore urge the Office to state the legal
  characterization publicly.” The OHCHR “has a strong legal and moral
  responsibility to denounce acts of genocide” and that “failing to denounce an
  unfolding genocide undermines the credibility of the UN and the human rights
  system itself”, the letter adds. UN officials have said that only an
  international court can declare a genocide – a process that can take many
  years. Experts on the international court of justice (ICJ) said in July that a
  judgment on whether Israel was committing genocide in Gaza was unlikely before
  the end of 2027 at the earliest. Many international human rights groups have
  already said a genocide is under way in Gaza, where the Israeli offensive has
  killed more than 63,000 people, mostly civilians, injured 150,000 and
  displaced almost the entire 2.3 million population. UN-backed experts declared
  a famine in parts of the devastated territory earlier this month. Israeli
  officials reject the charge of genocide as “outrageous and false”, and say the
  country is acting in self-defence after Hamas’s surprise raid in October 2023
  that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and resulted in 251 hostages being
  taken. In January last year, the ICJ ruled that the claim of genocide was
  “plausible” and ordered Israel to “take all measures within its power” to stop
  acts of genocide, and incitement to genocide from being committed and take
  “immediate and effective measures” to allow aid into Gaza. One OHCHR employee
  said Türk was failing his mandate to prevent as well as report human rights
  abuses around the world and that his high-profile post offered an opportunity
  to make a much greater difference. “People take notice of what we say, and he
  says. He could be telling member states and officials working for them that
  they could face really serious legal consequences. At least that would make
  them think and put down a marker. No one could claim later that they didn’t
  know,” said one signatory to the letter. In his response to the letter, also
  seen by the Guardian, Türk said signatories had raised “important concerns”
  and pledged to continue to “demand accountability regarding arms transfers
  facilitating violations”. “I know we all share a feeling of moral indignation
  at the horrors we are witnessing, as well as frustration in the face of the
  international community’s inability to bring this situation to an end,” wrote
  Türk, a human rights lawyer and veteran UN official, . A spokesperson for the
  OHCHR said the agency had been working in very difficult circumstances “in the
  face of vilification and accusations of bias, complicity, antisemitism, double
  standards and more” to try to document the facts on the ground and raise the
  alarm. The spokesperson added that Türk had warned repeatedly of the “high and
  increasing risk that atrocity crimes”, which include war crimes, crimes
  against humanity and genocide, “are being committed in the occupied
  Palestinian territory”. In November, Türk called on UN member states to assess
  arms sales or transfers to Israel and any other actors in the conflict, “with
  a view to ending such support if this risks serious violations of
  international law.” “As the high commissioner has said, since 7 October 2023,
  parties to this conflict have paid little heed to international law that
  protects human rights and governs the conduct of hostilities. This has been a
  stain on the collective conscience of humanity … The international community
  needs to come together to bring this unbearable horror to an end,” the
  spokesperson said. Israel’s foreign ministry told Reuters it did not respond
  to internal UN employees’ letters “even if they are false, baseless, and
  blinded by obsessive hatred towards Israel”.
