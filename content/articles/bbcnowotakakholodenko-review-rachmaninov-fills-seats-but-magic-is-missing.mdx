  Sometimes the simple tactics work best. It turns out that if you name a Prom
  after one of the best-loved works in the classical canon, you don’t just get a
  full house for that piece, but also a near-capacity Royal Albert Hall after
  the interval for Witold Lutosławski’s Concerto for Orchestra. Vivid, gritty,
  bracing: what the programme hails as the 20th-century Polish composer’s “most
  successful large-scale work” is many things, but it certainly isn’t classical
  easy listening. And perhaps some of those drawn by the ultra-familiar will now
  have been set on a voyage of discovery. Rachmaninov’s Piano Concerto No 2
  needn’t be easy listening either, of course, even if its association with
  Brief Encounter sealed its status as the last word in impassioned pianism.
  It’s a strange work, full of delicately balanced orchestral textures and vital
  dialogues between orchestra and soloist. But not in this performance, which
  was largely driven by Ukrainian pianist Vadym Kholodenko, making his Proms
  debut. After a thrilling crescendo in his opening chords, there was rubato
  galore (dragging the BBC National Orchestra of Wales forward or holding them
  back) but minimal subtlety of expression or dynamics. All the notes were there
  – and many in the hall were clearly delighted to hear them – but with little
  magic from either Kholodenko or BBCNOW, whose playing lacked the finesse
  demanded by Rachmaninov’s score beyond the biggest of the big tunes. The
  orchestra fared better in Lutosławski’s colourful shifts of timbre and mood.
  In his final appearance as BBCNOW’s conductor laureate after a nearly 40-year
  association with the orchestra, Tadaaki Otaka commanded both massive, muscular
  interjections and passages of hushed, finicky counterpoint that stilled the
  audience, inviting attention. The orchestra continued to sound most
  comfortable in the loudest tutti passages, where brass was served in lurid
  splashes. The closest this concert got to genuine subtlety was in its opening
  piece, the Concerto for String Orchestra by Lutosławski’s Polish contemporary
  Grażyna Bacewicz. There BBCNOW’s XL string section produced a rich, generous
  sound (carefully blended, bowing as one), folk idioms occasionally breaking
  playfully through Bacewicz’s mid-century musical nattiness – all led with
  energetic precision by Otaka. • Listen again on BBC Sounds until 12 October.
  The Proms continue until 13 September.
