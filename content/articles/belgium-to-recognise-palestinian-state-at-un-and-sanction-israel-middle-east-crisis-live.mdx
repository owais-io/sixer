  The Palestinian foreign ministry has said it welcomes Belgium’s announcement
  that it will recognise Palestinian statehood. In a statement on X, the
  ministry said it considered the move “to be in line with international law and
  United Nations resolutions, and protective of the two-state solution and
  supportive of achieving peace”. The statement added: The ministry calls on the
  countries that have not yet recognized the state of Palestine to quickly take
  the initiative for this recognition, and to intensify practical efforts to
  stop the crimes of genocide, displacement, starvation, and annexation, and to
  open a real political path to resolve the conflict and end the Israeli
  occupation of the land of the State of Palestine. The Guardian’s political
  correspondent Eleni Courea has done an explainer with a section looking at
  what recognising Palestine would look in practice. Here is an extract:
  Recognition is a symbolic step but one that would infuriate the Israeli
  government, which argues that it would encourage Hamas and reward terrorism.
  It is in effect a formal, political acknowledgment of Palestinian
  self-determination – without the need to engage in thorny practicalities such
  as the location of its borders or capital city. It also allows the
  establishment of full diplomatic relations that would result in a Palestinian
  ambassador (rather than a head of mission) being stationed in London and a
  British ambassador in Palestine. Advocates say it is a way of kickstarting a
  political process towards an eventual two-state solution. Out of the 193 UN
  member states, about 140 already recognise Palestine as a state. These include
  China, India and Russia, as well as a majority of European countries such as
  Cyprus, Ireland, Norway, Spain and Sweden. We are restarting our live coverage
  of Israel’s war on Gaza. Belgium’s foreign minister, Maxime Prévot, has said
  his country will recognise a Palestinian state at the UN general assembly
  later this month, adding to international pressure on Israel after similar
  moves by Australia, Britain, Canada and France. The decision comes “in light
  of the humanitarian tragedy unfolding in Palestine, particularly in Gaza, and
  in response to the violence perpetrated by Israel in violation of
  international law,” Prévot said in a post to social media. Israel has become
  increasingly isolated on the international stage as it faces credible
  accusations of genocide, ethnic cleansing, war crimes and the collective
  punishment of the civilian population of Gaza. Israel’s assault has flattened
  large parts of Gaza, killing more than 63,000 people, mostly civilians,
  forcing nearly all of Gaza’s more than 2 million people from their homes and
  causing what the UN-backed hunger monitor, the Integrated Food Security Phase
  Classification (IPC), described last month as a “man-made famine” in and
  around Gaza City. Israel is still obstructing aid into the territory, despite
  widespread starvation. In a lengthy post on X describing the Belgium
  government’s new position, Prévot wrote: In light of the humanitarian tragedy
  unfolding in Palestine, particularly in Gaza, and in response to the violence
  perpetrated by Israel in violation of international law, given its
  international obligations, including the duty to prevent any risk of genocide,
  Belgium had to take strong decisions to increase pressure on the Israeli
  government and Hamas terrorists. This is not about sanctioning the Israeli
  people but about ensuring that their government respects international and
  humanitarian law and taking action to try to change the situation on the
  ground. The recognition of Palestine would only be formalised if Hamas
  releases all remaining Israeli hostages kidnapped in the Hamas-led 7 October
  attack on southern Israel in 2023 and the militant group “no longer has any
  role in managing Palestine,” Prévot added. Prévot said Belgium, a member of
  the European Union, would levy 12 “firm” sanctions on Israel, such as a ban on
  importing products from its settlements and a review of public procurement
  policies with Israeli companies. It will also declare Hamas leaders persona
  non grata in Belgium. The minister also said two “extremist” Israeli ministers
  and several “violent settlers” would be designated “persona non grata” in
  Belgium. While he didn’t name the ministers, they are likely to be Itamar
  Ben-Gvir, the far right security minister in Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition
  government, and Bezalel Smotrich, the far right finance minister. Over the
  summer, the UK, alongside Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Norway sanctioned
  Ben-Gvir and Smotrich over “repeated incitements of violence against
  Palestinian communities” in the occupied West Bank.
