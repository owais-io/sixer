  Playwright Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti is best known for her Susan Smith Blackburn
  prize-winning 2005 drama Behzti. Featuring scenes of rape and violence in a
  Sikh gurdwara, the ambitious state-of-the-nation work stirred huge controversy
  among religious communities when it premiered, and had its run at the
  Birmingham Rep cancelled following violent protests. Bhatti has since gone on
  to create similarly confronting work, including her recent touring play about
  prison motherhood, Scenes from Lost Mothers, as well as penning a coercive
  control storyline for The Archers. But those theatregoers expecting a
  continuation of this challenging storytelling may be disappointed by her
  latest work, Choir. Set during rehearsal sessions for a community choir who
  are preparing for a potential big break on TV, the play is more comic than
  visceral, more sitcom than Sarah Kane. The eight-person ensemble cast are
  tight-knit and lively, tackling musical numbers such as Queen’s Somebody to
  Love and the Eagles’ Hotel California with harmonic aplomb, while director
  Hannah Joss’s slick musical scene transitions add pace and rhythm to the
  script. But the characterisations are disappointingly clunky, giving us the
  likes of kooky pensioner Sheila, lonely divorcee Ken, diva-like former star
  Paul and troubled but promising upstart Freddie. Group dynamics play out
  predictably in the first half, as newcomer Freddie steals the spotlight from
  usual soloist Paul, and the stress caused by the TV crew’s imminent arrival
  leads choir founder Morgan (an energetic and engaging Laura Checkley) to make
  a compromising decision. Secrets abound and slapstick gags lead to panto
  laughs. Thankfully though, as the play’s final acts arrive, a series of
  emotional denouements elevate it. Danusia Samal as happy-go-lucky Anna
  delivers a beautifully muted monologue that reveals the sadness behind her
  plastered-on smile, while a standout scene between Keenan Munn-Francis’s shy
  Freddie and James Gillan’s acerbic Paul produces a moving rendition of Sinéad
  O’Connor’s Nothing Compares 2 U. Revelations come quickly and the show’s
  finale lands with a heartwarming flutter. It’s perhaps too little too late,
  but ultimately still a welcome foray into fresh, feelgood territory for
  Bhatti. • At Minerva theatre, Chichester, until 30 August
