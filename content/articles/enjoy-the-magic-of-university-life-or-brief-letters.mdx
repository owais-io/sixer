  Simon Jenkins seems to have forgotten the purpose of higher education (As
  thousands more teenagers scramble for university places, I have to ask – why?,
  14 August). It is not, primarily, for vocational study, nor is it something to
  rush through in two years. It is to provide a lifetime love of learning and to
  encourage different ways of thinking. The solution is not to “cut back”, as
  Jenkins suggests, but, if anything, to ensure that as many students as
  possible experience the magic of university life. Emeritus Professor Gad
  Heuman University of Warwick • Zheng Zeguang should be applauded for reminding
  us how Britain and China joined forces to defeat fascism in the second world
  war (15 August). Let us hope that Britain will continue to work with the
  Chinese people to oppose genocidal, expansionist, totalitarian regimes
  wherever they might have taken root in the world since then. Christopher
  Hughes Professor emeritus of international relations, LSE • In St Andrews, the
  problem of gulls (Report, 19 August) has become so bad that one food outlet,
  The Cheesy Toast Shack, will insure your toastie for a small extra charge and
  give you a second one if a gull flies away with the first. Margaret Squires St
  Andrews, Fife • We’ve had their fish, now the gulls want our chips. Andy Sharp
  Scarborough, North Yorkshire • Looking forward to when I can cash in my walk
  to the pub for a pint (These exercise apps reward steps with freebies – but
  which ones are worth the effort?, 16 August). Noel Cullinane Leeds • Have an
  opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today? Please email us your
  letter and it will be considered for publication in our letters section.
