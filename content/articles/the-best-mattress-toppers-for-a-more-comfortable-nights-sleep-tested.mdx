  A mattress topper is like a slice of cheese in a burger: not strictly
  necessary, but potentially transformative, especially if your bed has all the
  cosiness of stale bread. Strap a comfy topper on to a hard mattress and it
  could transform the quality of your sleep at significantly less cost than a
  new mattress. That’s the promise, anyway. In my neverending quest for a decent
  night’s kip, I slept on eight bestselling toppers – not all at once, Princess
  and the Pea style, but for a few nights, each on top of a firm mattress. I was
  surprised to find so many topper types available, from thick slabs of memory
  foam to airy cloudbanks of hollowfibre, with one even containing springs. Most
  of my test toppers went to charity straight after testing, but one improved my
  sleep so much that I hung on to it for weeks like a teenager refusing to
  acknowledge that the alarm went off hours ago. Here, I’ll reveal which topper
  turned me into a duvet-hugger and which one I kicked out of bed at 4am. *** At

  £188 (superking) at Origin *** Why you should trust me I’ve spent three
  decades reviewing products from smartphones to hay fever remedies, so I’m
  naturally sceptical of manufacturers’ claims to improve our lives by buying
  their stuff. I also have a solid background in napping, insomnia and swearing
  at alarm clocks, so I welcomed the chance to sleep on the job – which has
  become something of a speciality for me at the Filter. *** How I tested
  Testing mattress toppers is not unlike testing mattresses – it just swallows
  up less space in your house – so I followed a similar methodology to that for
  best mattresses. First, I sourced double size toppers from the manufacturers
  (or from Mattress Online, in the case of the Silentnight), then allowed them
  to fully expand. Most of my test samples contain memory foam, so they needed a
  couple of days to reach the ideal consistency. Then I sought feedback from
  people with assorted mattress preferences and sleep styles. I asked my dad
  (85), my niece (23), my sister and our husbands to join me for a
  topper-tasting session where we sat, laid down and rolled over on every test
  sample to compare them side by side. I collected everyone’s scores out of 10
  for firmness, breathability and overall comfort, then worked out averages to
  draw up an initial ranking. Next, ably assisted by my husband Alan, I ran
  tests with weights, a heat pad, a thermometer and a glass of water to measure
  sinkage, temperature regulation and motion isolation. Mattress toppers vary
  less on these factors than full-size mattresses, but we still collected
  diverse and occasionally surprising data, especially on heat retention. For
  instance, when we warmed each topper’s surface to 35C using a microwavable
  heat pad, Panda’s memory foam topper cooled down even faster than those filled
  with microfibre or wool – despite containing a notoriously heat-hugging
  material. Clearly, foam technology is advancing, and we couldn’t make
  assumptions about toppers based simply on their lists of ingredients. Then we
  went to sleep. Alan and I slept on each topper for at least two nights across
  three weeks in July and August. Night temperatures were around 15C, ideal for
  sleep but warm enough to test whether, in practice, the foam toppers retained
  too much body heat for comfort. We attached them to a firm Sealy Posturepedic
  Elevate Emin mattress, which I’m currently reviewing for the Filter, on a
  slatted Ikea bed base. I considered each topper’s environmental credentials,
  too. Mattress makers are secretive about the lifecycles of their products, but
  I discovered what I could about the materials used, their manufacture and
  their potential for recycling. No mattress toppers were harmed in the testing
  process, but I struggled to find takers for them at the local refuges and
  hardship organisations that have collected my test mattresses. So I donated
  them to a local charity that means a lot to me: Farplace, which raises money
  for animal rescue. *** The best mattress toppers you can buy in 2025 Best
  mattress topper overall: Simba Hybrid Topper From £299 (single) to £499
  (superking) at Simba My favourite topper is essentially a thin bed-in-a-box
  hybrid mattress. It arrived vacuum-shrunk and rolled in plastic, and contains
  layers of memory foam and springs to offer a balance of comfort and support.
  So far, so similar to the Simba Hybrid Pro mattress – but I found it even more
  comfortable than its full-size counterpart. Why we love it It’s rare for a
  mattress topper to contain springs, because there’s not much room for them.
  But Simba’s 6.5cm-deep topper squeezes “up to 1,900” conical titanium
  microsprings between its top layer of open-cell memory foam and base layer of
  high-density foam. My testing panel initially found it too firm, but that’s
  because they didn’t sleep on it. The foam adapted to the heat and shape of my
  body over four nights, developing just enough sink-in softness to feel
  gloriously comfortable without ever lacking support. It even relieved the rib
  pain that had meddled with my efforts to sleep on a firmer surface. Simba’s
  topper ended up going to charity like the others, but not until I’d slept on
  it for a few more weeks. This isn’t just because I loved it – I also wanted to
  check that it didn’t get soft in the middle, like my test sample of the Simba
  Hybrid Pro. It didn’t, possibly because it was attached to such a firm
  mattress, but I found it stayed most comfortable if I rotated it every week.
  Simba’s own recommendation is to rotate the topper “at least once per month”
  in the first three months. It’s a shame that … temperature regulation wasn’t
  as good as expected, both in our tests and my experience. The open-cell foam
  is designed to promote airflow, but like a lot of memory foam it struggles to
  avoid trapping heat when the nights are warm. Suitable for: anyone who loves a
  cosy but supportive sleeping surface and doesn’t want to fork out for an
  entire hybrid mattress Type: hybrid (foam and springs) Depth: 6.5cm Cover:
  unzip to wash at 40C Trial period: 200 nights Warranty: 10 years
  Sustainability credentials: Simba is B Corp certified and aiming for net zero
  by 2030. Hybrid Topper foam is CertiPur approved *** Best budget mattress
  topper: Silentnight Airmax 1000 From £44.95 (single) to £75 (superking) at
  Mattress Online From £42 (single) to £56 (superking) at Silentnight
  Silentnight’s pillowy topper is just £46 for a double size and can genuinely
  restore comfort if your bed is too firm. It wins on convenience, too: it’s
  very light, rolls up small and will survive an electric blanket or washing
  machine. Why we love it The Silentnight topper looks perturbingly like a puffa
  jacket or bouncy castle. No mattress topper can iron out the bumps in a lumpy
  bed, but this one looks like it adds them. My testing panel was suitably
  sceptical. As with the Simba, however, the Silentnight proved its worth when I
  actually slept on it. The hollowfibre filling compresses under your sleeping
  body, feeling cosy without being too soft. This is one of the most breathable
  toppers I tested. Hollowfibre has none of the heat-trapping properties memory
  foam is known for, and we both woke up feeling refreshed. Silentnight also
  claims the filling is antibacterial and anti-allergy, and while I couldn’t
  test its resistance to dust mites I can confirm it didn’t set off my hay
  fever. It’s a shame that … this topper occasionally wears its cheapness on its
  sleeve. You have to keep plumping it up, and some of the 48 puffs are fatter
  than others. Suitable for: adding a comfy, allergy-resistant layer to a hard
  mattress or sofa bed Type: hollowfibre Depth: claims 10cm but I found it
  closer to 4cm when in regular use Cover: not removable; wash the whole topper
  at 40C Trial period: no Warranty: two years Sustainability credentials:
  Silentnight is zero landfill, aims for net zero by 2040, and says it’s the
  first sleep brand to publish an Environmental Social Governance (ESG) report
  *** Best cooling mattress topper: Panda Bamboo From £99.95 (single) to £199.95
  (EU emperor) at Panda Panda’s topper tackled my night sweats better than any
  other in our rundown – not what I’d expected from a slab of memory foam. It
  offers the cosy pressure relief of foam without the cost and commitment of an
  all-foam mattress. Why we love it The Panda has a relatively simple
  construction, with a flat pad of memory foam inside a removable fabric cover,
  but it’s full of thoughtful details. I like the tiny rubberised dots on the
  base to stop it slipping when you get in and out of bed, and it’s the only
  topper I tested to have adjustable straps, so you can fit it securely to any
  depth of mattress. The Panda cooled down faster than any other topper in our
  heat-retention tests, and when I slept on it in late July, the
  “temperature-regulating hydro foam” genuinely seemed to emit a cooling
  sensation from below. The cover also contains bamboo fibre to help avoid
  overheating. This is a relatively soft topper and its high-viscosity foam
  moulds around your body, so it’s ideal for relieving joint pain. It will get
  softer over months of sleeping, but at 5cm deep it won’t dip far enough to
  leave you feeling unsupported, providing the mattress underneath it is robust.
  It’s a shame that … it will be too soft for some and there’s no bounce
  whatsoever, but at least that means you won’t feel the fidgeting of a restless
  partner. Suitable for: couples who share a bed but crave some peace from each
  other’s movements and body heat Type: memory foam Depth: 5cm Cover: unzip to
  wash at 40C Free trial: 30 days Warranty: 10 years Sustainability credentials:
  FSC-managed bamboo, circle-of-life recycling scheme *** Best firm mattress
  topper: Origin Contour From £120 (single) to £188 (superking) at Origin If the
  handsome Origin Hybrid Pro is the James Bond of mattresses, the Origin Contour
  topper is young Bond: cool, slim and harder than it looks. Its high-density
  foam softens just enough to leave you feeling neither shaken nor stirred as
  you sleep. Why we love it The Origin is the most orthopaedic-feeling of all
  the toppers I tested, and this made it my favourite for sitting up to read in
  bed. My family found it too firm for lying on, but I liked it – not least
  because it yielded slightly under the weight and warmth of my body over a few
  nights of sleeping, while remaining very supportive. The silky cover is
  described by Origin as “extra-cooling Tencel” and the upper foam layer
  contains “cooling gel-infused beads” to head off overheating. This topper lets
  the air circulate better than some, but I didn’t measure the same level of
  cooling as with the Panda or the Silentnight. It’s a shame that … some details
  don’t quite work. For instance, the fabric cover is a little loose and gets
  caught in the zip, while the straps are too tight for thicker mattresses –
  such as Origin’s own hulking 31cm-deep Hybrid Pro. Suitable for: adding gently
  cushioned support to a bed that’s seen better days, as long as it’s still firm
  Type: memory foam Depth: 5cm Cover: unzip to wash at 40C Free trial: 30 nights
  Warranty: three years Sustainability credentials: foam is CertiPUR approved;
  returned mattresses go to the British Heart Foundation *** The best of the
  rest Otty Bamboo with Charcoal From £99.99 (single) to £179.99 (superking) at
  Otty Best for: softening a firm mattress such as the Otty Original Hybrid, and
  potentially helping you fall asleep faster Otty’s sumptuous foam topper scored
  instant wins with my family testing panel, partly because it looks great – its
  deep-stitched cover is like a 60s space-race-era quilt – but mainly thanks to
  its instantly comfy plushness. “Ooh, it’s lovely. There’s a heftiness to it
  but it feels so comfortable,” said my sister Maeve. My husband Alan added:
  “It’s moulding to me but I’m not sinking in. The foam springs back fast, like
  baby skin. It’s making me want to go to sleep.” Indeed, I fell asleep
  unusually fast on this topper, which also offered brilliant motion isolation
  to help us both doze in peace. It didn’t make the final cut because … the
  topper softened under my sleeping body and I woke up at 4am feeling hot and,
  frankly, sunk. We dragged it off the bed and went back to sleep. I was also
  disappointed to find that the fabulous removable cover is dry clean only.
  Suitable for: softening a firm bed and potentially helping you fall asleep
  faster Type: memory foam Depth: 5cm Cover: unzip to dry clean Free trial: 14
  days Warranty: one year Sustainability credentials: foam is CertiPUR- and
  Europur-approved for environmental standards Dunelm Snuggledown Fresh and
  Healthy From £80 (single) to £110 (superking) at Dunelm Best for: adding a
  breathable top layer to a hybrid or foam mattress Dunelm’s topper has an
  antibacterial cover and is filled with microfibre, a denser and more down-like
  material than the hollowfibre in the Silentnight. This creates a lightweight,
  breathable and surprisingly firm surface that’s satisfying to lie on because
  it springs back instantly – and with no bounce to disturb your sleep. It
  didn’t make the final cut because … it’s more expensive than it feels Type:
  microfibre; depth: 5cm; cover: unzip to wash at 40C; free trial: return within
  28 days if unused and with original packaging; warranty: five years;
  sustainability: Dunelm’s “Good and Circular” initiative aims to reduce
  environmental impact of its products; 50% CO2 reduction target by 2030 and net
  zero by 2040 *** Ikea Nordberget From £99 (single) to £179 (superking) at Ikea
  Best for: couples who want better motion isolation on a sprung mattress The
  snug, foamy Nordberget is not a bargain like the Ikea Valevåg mattress.
  Indeed, it costs around the same as the toppers from Panda and Otty, but
  couldn’t quite match either of them in my tests. It’s still a good choice to
  add softness and pressure relief to a mattress that’s too firm. Its motion
  isolation is outstanding, so it’s a brilliant choice for couples who are fed
  up with each other’s tossing and turning. This is one of only two double-sided
  mattress toppers in my test (the other is the Woolroom below), which means you
  can flip it over for a fresh surface. It didn’t make the final cut because …
  the foam becomes quite soft, and the absence of straps means the topper moves
  around on your bed. Type: memory foam; depth: 4.5cm; cover: unzip to wash at
  up to 60C; double-sided: yes; free trial: none; warranty: one-year guarantee;
  sustainability: 2025 target of 20% recycled content in all Ikea mattress foams
  *** Woolroom Deluxe From £142.49 (single) to £329.99 (large emperor) at
  Woolroom Best for: keeping your bed at a comfortable temperature all year
  round Woolroom’s topper reminds me of old-fashioned eiderdown quilts, both in
  appearance and feel. Its British wool filling compresses beneath your body to
  create a cosy but flat sleeping surface. The cotton cover and naturally
  hypoallergenic wool filling did a fantastic job of regulating my temperature
  on warm nights, and wool acts as a great insulator in winter, too. It didn’t
  make the final cut because … it didn’t have a big enough impact on my comfort
  or sleep to warrant the price tag – and it’s dry clean only. Type: wool;
  depth: 4-5cm; cover: not removable, dry clean the whole topper; free trial: 30
  nights; warranty: two years; sustainability: Woolroom wool is fully traceable;
  cotton is 100% organic; bedding is Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified *** What
  you need to know *** What’s the difference between a mattress topper and a
  mattress protector? A mattress topper is a layer of foam or similar material,
  usually around 5-6cm thick, designed to add cushioning and comfort to a
  mattress that’s too hard. A mattress protector is more like a thick fitted
  sheet – often quilted, and sometimes waterproof – that helps to keep sweat,
  spills and dirt away from your mattress. A topper helps to protect your
  mattress from wear and tear, too, of course. Will a mattress topper fix a bad
  mattress? In most cases, no. If the mattress is “bad” because it’s too hard
  for your preference, then a mattress topper can fix it by adding a layer of
  cushioning. It will help prolong the mattress’s life, too. But if the mattress
  is saggy, torn or lumpy, the topper will simply follow the curve of its
  surface. “Where a mattress has lost its support or doesn’t provide enough
  support for your body shape, a topper won’t solve the problem,” says Hannah
  Shore, head of sleep science at Mattress Online. “Ultimately the topper will
  shape itself into those same lumps and bumps.” Can a topper make my bed feel
  firmer? All mattress toppers work best on a solid foundation. A firm topper
  such as the Origin Contour may briefly make you feel more supported if your
  mattress is too soft, but it’ll soon sink into the mattress and create an
  unstable, uneven surface. As a rule of thumb, lower layers should be firmer
  and upper layers should be softer. Don’t be tempted to use a mattress topper
  on the floor, either, says Hannah Shore. “They’re designed to be used in
  conjunction with an actual mattress. A topper on the floor won’t give you the
  support and cushioning you need to get a good night’s sleep.” What should I
  look for when buying a mattress topper? That depends why you want a topper.
  These bed-enhancers come in a surprisingly wide range of materials and
  tensions, each suited to different needs. Your bed feels too hard: look for a
  soft topper, ideally made from memory foam. Brands including Tempur and Simba
  have their own names for memory foam, but it’s all similar stuff:
  high-viscosity foam that moulds around your body to provide support as well as
  plush cushioning. It softens over weeks and months of being slept on,
  especially when the weather’s warm. You get too warm in bed: memory foam tends
  to trap heat, so hollowfibre or wool is traditionally a better choice if you
  tend to overheat at night. However, sleep brands are competing to devise
  breathable foam recipes such as Panda’s “HydroFoam”, whose open-cell design
  and “heat-sentisive micro gel” let the air circulate and draw heat away from
  your body as you sleep. This helped make the Panda Bamboo the best cooling
  topper in my test. You suffer aches and pains: orthopaedic sleeping surfaces
  can feel too firm, especially if you’re used to a softer surface. I love a
  firm mattress, but my ribs and shoulders are far happier with a thin, soft
  comfort layer on top of it, especially when I sleep on my side. The pressure
  relief of a memory foam topper is also great for soothing painful joints and
  other musculoskeletal maladies. You share your bed with a fidget: memory foam
  is brilliant for absorbing the movement of a sleeping partner, so you’re less
  disturbed by their tossing and turning. You suffer from allergies: wool is
  naturally hypoallergenic and also excels at temperature regulation, but it’s
  not vegan and is usually dry clean only. As a habitual morning sneezer, I’ve
  had excellent results with polyester hollowfibre and microfibre toppers that
  act as a barrier to allergens such as dust mites in my mattress. These toppers
  are also the easiest to wash in the machine. Can I wash a mattress topper? The
  Woolroom topper and Otty cover in my test are dry clean only, an annoying
  barrier to keeping them fresh and healthy. You can’t wash or dry clean memory
  foam, but memory foam toppers usually have removable fabric covers that you
  can wash in the machine at 40C or even 60C. With polyester hollowfibre and
  microfibre toppers, you can normally put the whole thing in the machine,
  although it’ll take a bit longer to dry – much like washing a summer duvet. A
  heated clothes airer will help when the sun doesn’t shine. What else should I
  bear in mind? Get the right size topper for your mattress: don’t try to save a
  few pounds by buying a double size topper for a king size mattress. The topper
  won’t attach securely, so it will move around while you turn in the night and
  could even slide off the bed. Mattresses vary in depth, of course, so check
  the size of straps if you can when buying your topper. Of the toppers on test,
  the adjustable straps on the Panda were the best, securing tightly to any
  depth of mattress. The Dunelm’s straps were particularly big, and the Origin’s
  were particularly small. A non-slip base like the ones on the Otty, Simba and
  Panda will help keep the topper in place. The double-sided Ikea has no straps
  or non-slip base at all, so it will need to be secured with a tight fitted
  sheet. All but the thinnest toppers will add a couple of inches of height to
  your mattress, so your sheets may struggle to fit. You can buy extra deep
  fitted sheets or even adjustable ones like the Pull Me Tight toggled fitted
  sheet (from £15 at Dunelm). Memory foam toppers add several kilos to the
  weight of your mattress too, so changing sheets becomes slightly harder work.
  Foam toppers also shouldn’t be used with electric blankets. Mattress toppers
  don’t typically come with the generous free trial periods and warranties that
  mattresses do, but some can be returned for a refund if you don’t get on with
  them. Check this before you buy. A good mattress topper will last three to
  five years if you take good care of it by using a mattress protector and
  rotating it regularly. *** Jane Hoskyn is a features journalist and WFH

Why we love it The Panda has a relatively simple construction, with a flat pad of memory foam inside a removable fabric cover, but it’s full of thoughtful details. I like the tiny rubberised dots on the base to stop it slipping when you get in and out of bed, and it’s the only topper I tested to have adjustable straps, so you can fit it securely to any depth of mattress. The Panda cooled down faster than any other topper in our heat-retention tests, and when I slept on it in late July, the “temperature-regulating hydro foam” genuinely seemed to emit a cooling sensation from below. The cover also contains bamboo fibre to help avoid overheating. This is a relatively soft topper and its high-viscosity foam moulds around your body, so it’s ideal for relieving joint pain. It will get softer over months of sleeping, but at 5cm deep it won’t dip far enough to leave you feeling unsupported, providing the mattress underneath it is robust. It’s a shame that … it will be too soft for some and there’s no bounce whatsoever, but at least that means you won’t feel the fidgeting of a restless partner. Suitable for: couples who share a bed but crave some peace from each other’s movements and body heat Type: memory foam Depth: 5cm Cover: unzip to wash at 40C Free trial: 30 days Warranty: 10 years Sustainability credentials: FSC-managed bamboo, circle-of-life recycling scheme *** Best firm mattress topper: Origin Contour From £120 (single) to £188 (superking) at Origin If the handsome Origin Hybrid Pro is the James Bond of mattresses, the Origin Contour topper is young Bond: cool, slim and harder than it looks. Its high-density foam softens just enough to leave you feeling neither shaken nor stirred as you sleep. Why we love it The Origin is the most orthopaedic-feeling of all the toppers I tested, and this made it my favourite for sitting up to read in bed. My family found it too firm for lying on, but I liked it – not least because it yielded slightly under the weight and warmth of my body over a few nights of sleeping, while remaining very supportive. The silky cover is described by Origin as “extra-cooling Tencel” and the upper foam layer contains “cooling gel-infused beads” to head off overheating. This topper lets the air circulate better than some, but I didn’t measure the same level of cooling as with the Panda or the Silentnight. It’s a shame that … some details don’t quite work. For instance, the fabric cover is a little loose and gets caught in the zip, while the straps are too tight for thicker mattresses – such as Origin’s own hulking 31cm-deep Hybrid Pro. Suitable for: adding gently cushioned support to a bed that’s seen better days, as long as it’s still firm Type: memory foam Depth: 5cm Cover: unzip to wash at 40C Free trial: 30 nights Warranty: three years Sustainability credentials: foam is CertiPUR approved; returned mattresses go to the British Heart Foundation *** The best of the rest Otty Bamboo with Charcoal From £99.99 (single) to £179.99 (superking) at Otty Best for: softening a firm mattress such as the Otty Original Hybrid, and potentially helping you fall asleep faster Otty’s sumptuous foam topper scored instant wins with my family testing panel, partly because it looks great – its deep-stitched cover is like a 60s space-race-era quilt – but mainly thanks to its instantly comfy plushness. “Ooh, it’s lovely. There’s a heftiness to it but it feels so comfortable,” said my sister Maeve. My husband Alan added: “It’s moulding to me but I’m not sinking in. The foam springs back fast, like baby skin. It’s making me want to go to sleep.” Indeed, I fell asleep unusually fast on this topper, which also offered brilliant motion isolation to help us both doze in peace. It didn’t make the final cut because … the topper softened under my sleeping body and I woke up at 4am feeling hot and, frankly, sunk. We dragged it off the bed and went back to sleep. I was also disappointed to find that the fabulous removable cover is dry clean only. Suitable for: softening a firm bed and potentially helping you fall asleep faster Type: memory foam Depth: 5cm Cover: unzip to dry clean Free trial: 14 days Warranty: one year Sustainability credentials: foam is CertiPUR- and Europur-approved for environmental standards Dunelm Snuggledown Fresh and Healthy From £80 (single) to £110 (superking) at Dunelm Best for: adding a breathable top layer to a hybrid or foam mattress Dunelm’s topper has an antibacterial cover and is filled with microfibre, a denser and more down-like material than the hollowfibre in the Silentnight. This creates a lightweight, breathable and surprisingly firm surface that’s satisfying to lie on because it springs back instantly – and with no bounce to disturb your sleep. It didn’t make the final cut because … it’s more expensive than it feels Type: microfibre; depth: 5cm; cover: unzip to wash at 40C; free trial: return within 28 days if unused and with original packaging; warranty: five years; sustainability: Dunelm’s “Good and Circular” initiative aims to reduce environmental impact of its products; 50% CO2 reduction target by 2030 and net zero by 2040 *** Ikea Nordberget From £99 (single) to £179 (superking) at Ikea Best for: couples who want better motion isolation on a sprung mattress The snug, foamy Nordberget is not a bargain like the Ikea Valevåg mattress. Indeed, it costs around the same as the toppers from Panda and Otty, but couldn’t quite match either of them in my tests. It’s still a good choice to add softness and pressure relief to a mattress that’s too firm. Its motion isolation is outstanding, so it’s a brilliant choice for couples who are fed up with each other’s tossing and turning. This is one of only two double-sided mattress toppers in my test (the other is the Woolroom below), which means you can flip it over for a fresh surface. It didn’t make the final cut because … the foam becomes quite soft, and the absence of straps means the topper moves around on your bed. Type: memory foam; depth: 4.5cm; cover: unzip to wash at up to 60C; double-sided: yes; free trial: none; warranty: one-year guarantee; sustainability: 2025 target of 20% recycled content in all Ikea mattress foams *** Woolroom Deluxe From £142.49 (single) to £329.99 (large emperor) at Woolroom Best for: keeping your bed at a comfortable temperature all year round Woolroom’s topper reminds me of old-fashioned eiderdown quilts, both in appearance and feel. Its British wool filling compresses beneath your body to create a cosy but flat sleeping surface. The cotton cover and naturally hypoallergenic wool filling did a fantastic job of regulating my temperature on warm nights, and wool acts as a great insulator in winter, too. It didn’t make the final cut because … it didn’t have a big enough impact on my comfort or sleep to warrant the price tag – and it’s dry clean only. Type: wool; depth: 4-5cm; cover: not removable, dry clean the whole topper; free trial: 30 nights; warranty: two years; sustainability: Woolroom wool is fully traceable; cotton is 100% organic; bedding is Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified *** What you need to know *** What’s the difference between a mattress topper and a mattress protector? A mattress topper is a layer of foam or similar material, usually around 5-6cm thick, designed to add cushioning and comfort to a mattress that’s too hard. A mattress protector is more like a thick fitted sheet – often quilted, and sometimes waterproof – that helps to keep sweat, spills and dirt away from your mattress. A topper helps to protect your mattress from wear and tear, too, of course. Will a mattress topper fix a bad mattress? In most cases, no. If the mattress is “bad” because it’s too hard for your preference, then a mattress topper can fix it by adding a layer of cushioning. It will help prolong the mattress’s life, too. But if the mattress is saggy, torn or lumpy, the topper will simply follow the curve of its surface. “Where a mattress has lost its support or doesn’t provide enough support for your body shape, a topper won’t solve the problem,” says Hannah Shore, head of sleep science at Mattress Online. “Ultimately the topper will shape itself into those same lumps and bumps.” Can a topper make my bed feel firmer? All mattress toppers work best on a solid foundation. A firm topper such as the Origin Contour may briefly make you feel more supported if your mattress is too soft, but it’ll soon sink into the mattress and create an unstable, uneven surface. As a rule of thumb, lower layers should be firmer and upper layers should be softer. Don’t be tempted to use a mattress topper on the floor, either, says Hannah Shore. “They’re designed to be used in conjunction with an actual mattress. A topper on the floor won’t give you the support and cushioning you need to get a good night’s sleep.” What should I look for when buying a mattress topper? That depends why you want a topper. These bed-enhancers come in a surprisingly wide range of materials and tensions, each suited to different needs. Your bed feels too hard: look for a soft topper, ideally made from memory foam. Brands including Tempur and Simba have their own names for memory foam, but it’s all similar stuff: high-viscosity foam that moulds around your body to provide support as well as plush cushioning. It softens over weeks and months of being slept on, especially when the weather’s warm. You get too warm in bed: memory foam tends to trap heat, so hollowfibre or wool is traditionally a better choice if you tend to overheat at night. However, sleep brands are competing to devise breathable foam recipes such as Panda’s “HydroFoam”, whose open-cell design and “heat-sentisive micro gel” let the air circulate and draw heat away from your body as you sleep. This helped make the Panda Bamboo the best cooling topper in my test. You suffer aches and pains: orthopaedic sleeping surfaces can feel too firm, especially if you’re used to a softer surface. I love a firm mattress, but my ribs and shoulders are far happier with a thin, soft comfort layer on top of it, especially when I sleep on my side. The pressure relief of a memory foam topper is also great for soothing painful joints and other musculoskeletal maladies. You share your bed with a fidget: memory foam is brilliant for absorbing the movement of a sleeping partner, so you’re less disturbed by their tossing and turning. You suffer from allergies: wool is naturally hypoallergenic and also excels at temperature regulation, but it’s not vegan and is usually dry clean only. As a habitual morning sneezer, I’ve had excellent results with polyester hollowfibre and microfibre toppers that act as a barrier to allergens such as dust mites in my mattress. These toppers are also the easiest to wash in the machine. Can I wash a mattress topper? The Woolroom topper and Otty cover in my test are dry clean only, an annoying barrier to keeping them fresh and healthy. You can’t wash or dry clean memory foam, but memory foam toppers usually have removable fabric covers that you can wash in the machine at 40C or even 60C. With polyester hollowfibre and microfibre toppers, you can normally put the whole thing in the machine, although it’ll take a bit longer to dry – much like washing a summer duvet. A heated clothes airer will help when the sun doesn’t shine. What else should I bear in mind? Get the right size topper for your mattress: don’t try to save a few pounds by buying a double size topper for a king size mattress. The topper won’t attach securely, so it will move around while you turn in the night and could even slide off the bed. Mattresses vary in depth, of course, so check the size of straps if you can when buying your topper. Of the toppers on test, the adjustable straps on the Panda were the best, securing tightly to any depth of mattress. The Dunelm’s straps were particularly big, and the Origin’s were particularly small. A non-slip base like the ones on the Otty, Simba and Panda will help keep the topper in place. The double-sided Ikea has no straps or non-slip base at all, so it will need to be secured with a tight fitted sheet. All but the thinnest toppers will add a couple of inches of height to your mattress, so your sheets may struggle to fit. You can buy extra deep fitted sheets or even adjustable ones like the Pull Me Tight toggled fitted sheet (from £15 at Dunelm). Memory foam toppers add several kilos to the weight of your mattress too, so changing sheets becomes slightly harder work. Foam toppers also shouldn’t be used with electric blankets. Mattress toppers don’t typically come with the generous free trial periods and warranties that mattresses do, but some can be returned for a refund if you don’t get on with them. Check this before you buy. A good mattress topper will last three to five years if you take good care of it by using a mattress protector and rotating it regularly. *** Jane Hoskyn is a features journalist and WFH pioneer with three decades of experience in rearranging bookshelves and “testing” coffee machines while deadlines loom.
