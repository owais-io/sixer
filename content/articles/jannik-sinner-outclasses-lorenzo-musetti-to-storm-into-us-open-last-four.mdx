  Jannik Sinner continued his march toward a second consecutive US Open title on
  Wednesday night, dispatching the 10th-seeded Lorenzo Musetti 6-1, 6-4, 6-2 in
  two hours flat in the first ever all-Italian men’s quarter-final at a grand
  slam tournament. The world No 1 and top seed in New York was tested only in
  flickers but proved unmovable, saving all seven break points he faced while
  converting five of his six opportunities. The result laid bare once again the
  gulf between Sinner’s metronomic consistency and the rest of the field, even
  when confronted with a compatriot armed with one of the most elegant backhands
  in the sport. Sinner burst from the gate, taking the first five games from an
  unsettled Musetti and pocketing the opening set in just 27 minutes. His depth
  and weight of shot locked his fellow Italian into defensive exchanges, and
  while Musetti produced stylish winners in spurts, they were outweighed by
  errors both unforced and otherwise. The second set was tighter. At 1-2, Sinner
  erased the only early danger with a 129mph unreturnable serve out wide before
  holding with a thunderous ace. Musetti went break point down in the fifth game
  after succumbing in an 18-shot rally only to escape with the hold to stay on
  serve. But serving at 4-4, 30-40, he double-faulted to gift the advantage to
  Sinner, who calmly served it out after the change of ends for a two-set lead.
  The lack of tension in the match led to some poor crowd behavior – the
  customary din of conversation in Arthur Ashe Stadium even more distracting
  than normal, spectators going to and from their seats outside changeovers, the
  actor John Turturro at one point taking the place of a camera operator to
  delight of nearby fans – but Sinner’s composure never wavered, his game as
  mechanical as the No 7 trains rattling by within earshot. By the start of the
  third, Musetti’s resistance was fading. He was broken in his opening service
  game and immediately under siege again. To his credit, he manufactured four
  break-point chances in the very next game and another two at 3-2, but Sinner
  repelled all of them with a mixture of poise and precision. When Musetti was
  broken again late in the set, the contest was over, Sinner sealing victory at
  love with a pair of aces. The statistics lent numerical context to the one-way
  traffic. Sinner won 42 of 46 first-serve points (91%), finished with 28
  winners to 17 unforced errors, never lost his serve and maintained an iron
  grip whenever danger loomed. Musetti struck 12 winners but sprayed 22 errors,
  undone as much by his failure to capitalize on rare openings as by Sinner’s
  relentless ball-striking. The 24-year-old has now dropped just 38 games in
  five matches, the second-fewest by a man to reach the US Open semi-finals
  since 2020. It was also his 26th consecutive win at majors played on hard
  courts, a streak that moved him above John McEnroe and now ranks alongside
  Novak Djokovic and Ivan Lendl as the third-longest in history. “Finding myself
  again in the semis of a grand slam, it’s a great achievement,” said Sinner,
  who is bidding to become the first man to defend the US Open title since Roger
  Federer claimed the last of five straight championships in 2008. “We try to
  prepare in the best possible way to be in this position. I really like playing
  best-of-five, I know my body a little bit better, so I’m very pleased to be
  here again.” For Musetti, the occasion was both a lesson and a measure of how
  far he has come. “I never played, honestly, someone who put me on this kind of
  rush in the rally,” he said afterwards. “He was always leading the rally. Of
  course, he’s better than me, and he showed.” He added: “Pretty impressed by
  Jannik’s performance today. I think he served really well, and he was pushing
  me to my limit. I’m happy I played against him to understand the things I have
  to improve.” Sinner, for his part, was quick to acknowledge the peculiar
  challenge of facing a compatriot. “Obviously, we know each other very well,”
  he said on court. “We come from the same country, we have so many Italian
  players every time in the draw. It’s nice to play here, obviously, playing
  Davis Cup together and then stuff like this, but we have to take the
  friendship away for the match and then when we shake hands it’s everything
  fine. From my point of view, it was a great performance, very solid,
  especially starting very well in the match.” Asked whether he felt he was
  playing his best tennis, Sinner demurred. “Every player who is in the semis of
  a grand slam, they are playing amazing tennis,” he said. “It’s a very special
  tournament. They always say it’s the last grand slam of the year, the last
  biggest tournament we have throughout the season. So there’s no better place
  to play a night match here in the biggest stadium we have with an amazing
  crowd. It means a lot to me.” He also reflected on the significance of an
  all-Italian occasion. “For sure at home, some Italians didn’t sleep,” he said
  with a grin. “We are very proud to be Italian. As I said, it’s a special
  country. We have amazing support, Italians are basically everywhere. So it’s
  great to be Italian and, yeah, see you in the next round.” For Sinner, the
  victory stretched his unbeaten run against Italian opponents to 16-0 and
  secured a place in a fifth consecutive major semi-final. It was also his 86th
  win at a grand slam, tying Nicola Pietrangeli for the most by an Italian man.
  He will next face Felix Auger-Aliassime, the Canadian 25th seed who rallied
  past Alex de Minaur earlier in the day. Auger-Aliassime has won two of their
  three previous meetings, though Sinner thrashed him for the loss of only two
  games in Cincinnati last month. “It’s going to be completely different,
  because conditions here are different,” Sinner said. “He’s had some big wins,
  so big confidence for him. From my point of view, I always try to look at
  myself. It’s going to be a very, very difficult match for both of us, because
  at a grand slam the energy and everything is different.” The quarter-final was
  a milestone for Italian tennis, the first time two men from the country had
  faced one another in the second week of any major. But there was never much
  doubt over which Italian would emerge. Sinner’s grip on Flushing Meadows
  remains firm, his authority undimmed, and the prospect of another deep
  September run now looks as routine as his latest victory.
