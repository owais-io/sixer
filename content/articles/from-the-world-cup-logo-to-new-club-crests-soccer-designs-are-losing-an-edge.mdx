  Lance Wyman is among America’s greatest-ever graphic designers, and his
  fingerprints are all over any number of American cities. Wyman’s style is
  instantly recognizable – simple, bold and clever. Wyman often works in
  wayfaring, and his signs and instructions to viewers often use simple,
  geometric shapes to get the job done, often incorporating a playfulness as
  well. His approach has made his work timeless. In 2011, when the government of
  the District of Columbia wanted their metro map updated, they went right back
  to Wyman, who had crafted the original design for the system about 40 years
  earlier. His most notable work, though, came early on in his career. In the
  late 60s, Wyman, along with a handful of others, was tasked with creating the
  visual identity for the upcoming Summer Olympics in Mexico City. It was a
  massive task, especially for a young designer only a half-decade removed from
  college. Determined to get the assignment right, Wyman moved to Mexico in the
  months leading up to his deadline and immersed himself in the country’s
  culture. He dived into archives, visited archaeological sites and spoke to
  locals. Slowly, he started to pick up design cues – from the yarn paintings of
  the indigenous Huichol in western Mexico, to the Aztec stone carvings that
  have always helped define the country’s visual identity. What Wyman helped
  produce is almost universally recognized as one of the greatest assemblages of
  sports design ever created. The logotype for the tournament alone – that
  hypnotic, concentric “MEXICO 68” – blended the country’s culture with the Op
  Art movement. Wyman and his team created event posters, wayfaring signage and
  more and within years their designs dotted the landscape of the entire city.
  In 1970, when the country hosted its first-ever World Cup, they went right
  back to Wyman’s logotype, and Wyman himself created a handful of other designs
  for the tournament. It feels fair to say that the visual identity of that
  tournament may well be the most instantly-recognizable design work of any
  World Cup in history. I reached Wyman a couple of years ago, at his office in
  New York City. Then 86, his work had understandably slowed. The World Cup is
  returning to Mexico in 2026, and I was eager to gather his thoughts on some of
  the early designs associated with the tournament, particularly Fifa’s official
  World Cup logo. “I did see it, yes,” Wyman said back then. “It’s not that
  effective. It’s not really identifiable when it goes small, so that’s
  certainly a problem. It certainly doesn’t say ‘soccer.’ I remember the first
  time I saw the [European] Champions League logo, I thought that was pretty
  clever. This … I’m just not so sure there’s a lot you can do with it.” The
  logo felt phoned-in back then, as it does now. It was crafted by Fifa’s
  in-house design team and accompanied by the requisite explainer graphic and
  even a presentation by Fifa itself, who espoused its valors: scalability and
  adaptability. It’s less a logo and more of a logo system, they explained,
  allowing them to adapt the image to different devices and even alter it to
  suit different host cities in the tournament’s host countries. It’s the same
  thing Wyman did expertly in 68, just worse. My view, of course, is purely
  subjective – as are most things related to art and design. But looking at the
  logo got me thinking more broadly about the direction of crests and design as
  a whole in American soccer. More recently, the crest for Denver Summit FC –
  the NWSL’s latest expansion club, which will debut in 2026 – only intensified
  what I’d already been thinking: why do these things all look the same in
  recent years? And despite that, why are some so inspiring, and some so …
  bland? In some ways, Vermont-based designer Matthew Wolff holds the keys to
  the design direction of American club soccer. His work spans the entirety of
  the men’s and women’s game, having handled some of MLS’ most well-received
  crests, elegant designs for LAFC and NYC FC among them. In the NWSL, Wolff was
  most recently tapped to craft a new logo for the club now known as Boston
  Legacy (after that club rolled out maybe the most roundly criticized name and
  brand in American soccer history. His work dots the lower leagues as well,
  where several of his crests have felt like instant classics – Union Omaha, and
  even recent USL League 2 champions Vermont Green, a club Wolff helped
  co-found. “I was at the right place at the right time,” said Wolff. “I think
  about the trajectory of American soccer in parallel to where I was in my
  education and my early career. [Everybody] has known that American soccer was
  going to explode for years and years. So I think I somewhat intentionally
  positioned myself to be ready, willing and able to create football crests in
  the United States.” Wolff’s works sometimes feels a little bit like Lyman’s:
  uncluttered, bold, simple. Like Wyman did in ‘68, Wolff operates in a space
  where his work often ends up being representative of the community that
  commissioned it and he often incorporates elements of those places into his
  final design. That’s easy enough to see in NYC FC’s crest, which looks like an
  old subway token, or the crest that Wolff designed for the NWSL’s Gotham FC,
  which prominently features the Statue of Liberty. Others feel a lot more
  esoteric, like the crest Wolff crafted for USL’s One Knox FC. That one, which
  features a color palette inspired by a handful of Knoxville’s local monuments,
  feels distinctly more generic, as does Denver’s. It’s an aesthetic summed up
  on a podcast I heard recently. In it, the host was raving about Denver’s new
  crest, saying it would feel right at home on the side of a reusable metal
  water bottle. To that person, that was a compliment. At times, though, that
  type of ubiquity can rob a design of its character. Wolff himself acknowledges
  the reality of design work as a whole. His job is done for the client, to meet
  the needs of their brief, not necessarily his own tastes or preferences. “My
  ideal vision is kind of irrelevant to these crests,” says Wolff. “I’m trying
  to answer a brief, some parameters that have been set by a club or by me and
  the club together. There’s obviously an infinite number of ways you can
  execute it, even in the tightest of briefs. If you told me ‘OK, this crest
  needs to have a heraldic lion that’s blue, and be in a circle and say Chelsea
  at the top and Football Club at the bottom and have some ornaments … there are
  still infinite ways I can design that. I don’t really think about my own
  tastes in the crests as much as ‘is this answering the brief.” Designers, in
  other words, are only part of the equation these days in terms of crafting a
  brand identity. “[The process] has been pulled away from graphic designers -
  specialists - and pulled into this nebulous room of other people who make
  design decisions by committee,” said Ben Mahler, a former creative director at
  MLS club DC United. “Marketing directors, focus groups, analytics driven shit,
  it all ends up pushing things into safer territory. It’s losing the artistic
  side and the wonkiness that comes from an individual.” Wolff, and any other
  designer in this space, is also subject to the mercy of the audience, so to
  speak. Bos Nation is far from the only club to have course corrected after an
  initial misstep – when the Chicago Fire rolled out an absolutely atrocious
  rebrand in 2019, their fans were enraged. The Fire turned to Wolff to solve
  that problem, and he did so with a much cleaner, easier-to look at design.
  “These designs are meant to represent the fans and the club,” said Wolff. “And
  if the fans, or the community see this crest and they feel it doesn’t
  represent them, then I think they’re well within their rights to let the club
  know. These fans are the ones who the clubs are asking to buy a $100 kit. And
  sure, there are examples where people make comments [about a crest] that are a
  little ridiculous. But by and large, I get it.” For his part, Wyman, who grew
  up in Kearny, New Jersey (an American soccer holy land in and of itself) told
  me he’s never been asked to do a soccer crest. A few years back he partnered
  with a non-profit to help design a soccer ball, which turned out great: the
  red, blue and white design is bedecked with stars. It feels a bit like the
  design of the old North American Soccer League’s ball, used through the ‘70s
  and early ‘80s. Outside that, Wyman’s work has largely been done for companies
  and local municipalities. Looking at his designs, it’s hard to imagine why
  some club out there wouldn’t bring him into the fold. Wolff’s work is often
  fantastic, but some variety might be nice, too. Maybe some club out there
  could take a chance on the person whose designs have been thrown on nearly
  every logo-related mood board in existence, over the years. “Every once in a
  while something will come along with sports, but for the most part, my work
  has been focused elsewhere,” Wyman said a couple of years back. “I’d love to
  take a crest on, if I had the opportunity.”
