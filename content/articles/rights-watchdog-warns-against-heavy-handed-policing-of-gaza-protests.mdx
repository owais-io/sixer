  The official human rights watchdog for England, Scotland and Wales has written
  to ministers and police expressing concern at a potentially “heavy-handed”
  approach to protests about Gaza and urging clearer guidance for officers in
  enforcing the law. In the letter to Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, and
  Mark Rowley, the head of the Metropolitan police, the Equality and Human
  Rights Commission (EHRC) said the perception that peaceful protest could
  attract disproportionate police attention “undermines confidence in our human
  rights protections”. Kishwer Falkner, the EHRC chair, wrote that it was vital
  that any policing of protests was both proportionate and based on clear legal
  tests. The letter raised concerns about “reports of police engagement with
  individuals participating in forms of protest that are not linked to any
  proscribed organisation”. It cited as an example the case of Laura Murton,
  first revealed by the Guardian. Keny police threatened her with arrest under
  the Terrorism Act for holding a Palestinian flag and having signs saying “Free
  Gaza” and “Israel is committing genocide”. Murton filmed police telling her
  that even such general statements “all come under proscribed groups, which are
  terror groups that have been dictated by the government”. During the exchange,
  one officer said the phrase “Free Gaza” was “supportive of Palestine Action”,
  that it was illegal “to express an opinion or belief that is supportive of a
  proscribed organisation”, and that she had committed that offence with her
  signs. Falkner wrote: “Whilst we acknowledge police expertise in assessing
  security risks, we want to emphasise that any interference with protest rights
  must be lawful and assessed case by case. “Heavy-handed policing or blanket
  approaches risk creating a chilling effect, deterring citizens from exercising
  their fundamental rights to freedom of expression and assembly through fear of
  possible consequences. “This concern extends beyond those directly affected by
  police engagement to the broader health of our democracy, because the
  perception that peaceful protest may attract disproportionate police attention
  undermines confidence in our human rights protections.” Falkner urged
  ministers and police to make sure all officers were given “clear and
  consistent guidance on their human rights obligations in relation to protest”,
  which should “ensure that the appropriate balance is maintained between public
  safety and the protection of essential human rights”. Murton told the Guardian
  last week that her solicitors had issued a letter of claim on her behalf to
  the chief constable of Kent police, in what was also said to be a move to
  remind other police forces of their responsibilities towards peaceful
  protests. Falkner said in a statement: “The right to peaceful protest is
  fundamental to our democracy and must be protected even when dealing with
  complex and sensitive issues. “We recognise the genuine challenges the police
  face in maintaining public safety, but we are concerned that some recent
  responses may not strike the right balance between security and fundamental
  rights. “Our role as the national human rights institution is to uphold the
  laws that safeguard everyone’s right to fairness, dignity and respect. When we
  see reports of people being questioned or prevented from peaceful protests
  that don’t support proscribed organisations, we have a duty to speak out.” The
  Liberal Democrats called on Cooper to act swiftly. Lisa Smart, the party’s
  home affairs spokesperson, said: “The lack of clarity that has been given to
  police officers has led to confusion, increasing tensions and risks creating a
  chilling effect on freedom of speech. “The home secretary needs to step in and
  give officers, often dealing with incredibly complex and sensitive situations,
  clear direction as to what is expected of them at protests. “Without that
  officers will be left exposed and those exercising their democratic rights
  worried about the consequences.” The warning comes in the context of wider
  police operations targeting protesters who, unlike Murton, appear to directly
  express support for Palestine Action, which is illegal given the group’s
  banned status. Membership of, or support for, the group is a criminal offence
  punishable by up to 14 years in prison under the Terrorism Act. The group was
  proscribed last month after incidents including one in which four people were
  arrested over damaged caused to two Voyager aircraft at RAF Brize Norton in
  Oxfordshire. In the latest of a series of mass protests against the decision,
  more than 500 people were arrested in London last Saturday, almost all for
  displaying placards or signs allegedly supportive of Palestine Action. Half of
  those arrested were aged 60 or above, according to police figures. Britain’s
  top police officer vowed to beat off attempts to overwhelm the criminal
  justice system. Some 700 have so far been arrested and 60 more charges were
  announced Friday evening. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley
  said: “I am proud of how our police and CPS teams have worked so speedily
  together to overcome misguided attempts to overwhelm the justice system. If
  necessary, we are able to investigate and quickly charge significant numbers
  of people each week if people want the potentially life-changing consequences
  of a terrorist conviction.” A spokesperson for Defend Our Juries criticised
  Rowley for saying he was “proud” saying he should instead be ashamed. Amnesty
  International UK said that while it welcomed the EHRC letter, the watchdog had
  “failed to acknowledge the hundreds of people unfairly arrested for peacefully
  exercising their right to free expression”. Sacha Deshmukh, the organisation’s
  chief executive, said: “This isn’t just about the chilling effect on freedom
  of speech for people ‘not linked to any proscribed organisation’, as the EHRC
  states, it’s also about the excessive policing of citizens’ right to protest
  against a decision made by their elected government. “Under international
  human rights law, protest speech should only be criminalised if it incites
  violence, hatred or discrimination. Holding a placard and peacefully stating
  opposition to a government decision to proscribe an organisation cannot
  realistically be treated as an example of incitement.” Downing Street has
  justified the ban on Palestine Action by saying it is “a violent organisation
  that has committed violence, significant injury, extensive criminal damage”, a
  description one of its co-founders has said is false and defamatory. The Home
  Office said the issues the EHRC had raised were an operational matter for the
  police. The Met referred the query to the Home Office. Additional reporting
