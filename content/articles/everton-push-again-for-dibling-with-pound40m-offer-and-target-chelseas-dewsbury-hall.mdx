  Everton have raised their bid for Tyler Dibling to about £40m and opened talks
  with Chelsea over signing Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall. Southampton have rejected two
  offers from Everton for the 19-year-old Dibling in recent days, of £27m and
  £35m, but Everton have returned with a third package worth iabout £40m
  including add-ons. The England Under-21 international, who is believed to be
  open to joining Everton, has two years on his contract and Southampton are
  pushing for package nearer to £50m. They think others may come to the table.
  Everton have missed out on several wide options this summer, including
  Francisco Conceição, who joined Juventus from Porto, and RB Leipzig’s recent
  signing from PSV, Johan Bakayoko. They also have interest in Lyon’s Malick
  Fofana, but the 20-year-old would prefer to join a club offering Champions
  League football. David Moyes also wants to strengthen in central midfield and
  Dewsbury-Hall is a longstanding target. The 26-year-old started two Premier
  League games last season after his £30m arrival from Leicester and was
  deployed more often in Chelsea’s Conference League campaign. Everton have
  opened talks over a permanent deal, with Chelsea seeking to recoup their
  outlay. Everton have completed four signings this summer – Carlos Alcaraz, the
  striker Thierno Barry, goalkeeper Mark Travers and the young left-back Adam
  Aznou – but 11 players have left, including nine members of last season’s
  first-team squad.
