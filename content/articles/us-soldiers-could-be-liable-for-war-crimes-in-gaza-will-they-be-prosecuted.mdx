  Human rights groups and activists who protest against continued US support for
  Israel have focused primarily on the flow of US weapons, warning that
  continuing to send weapons to a state which has been documented using them in
  probable war crimes makes the US complicit. However, this week, Human Rights
  Watch (HRW) highlighted another facet of US military support for Israel:
  military cooperation and intelligence sharing. Individual US military
  personnel who assist Israeli forces in committing war crimes could face
  criminal prosecution for their actions, the rights group said. The US has made
  no secret of its operational support for Israel throughout its 22-month war in
  Gaza. The US has provided Israel with intelligence at various points during
  its military operations, and also embedded US military forces within Israeli
  operational planning. The direct participation of US forces in Israel’s
  military activities in Gaza makes it a party to the conflict – and this would
  mean those individual US soldiers could be liable for any war crimes committed
  with their assistance, according to Omar Shakir, the Israel and Palestine
  director at HRW. “It goes beyond complicity, the US has directly participated
  in hostilities. If you played a role in it and the Israeli forces carried out
  a war crime, you could still be liable for the war crime,” he said. It is
  difficult to know the extent of direct US participation in Israeli military
  operations, as much of it is classified. But both the current and former
  administration have boasted about their operational support for Israel – at
  times in military operations which have questionable legality. In October
  2024, former US president Joe Biden said that US special operations personnel
  and members of the intelligence community helped Israel target Hamas leaders,
  including the former head of Hamas, Yahya Sinwar. More recently, the White
  House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters that the Trump
  administration was consulted by Israel before it resumed strikes on 18 March,
  killing more than 400 people. A growing list of potential war crimes has not
  slowed US support for Israel. A strike on al-Nasser hospital in southern Gaza
  which killed 20 people, including five journalists, on Monday joins a long
  series of indiscriminate attacks killing civilians in Gaza. Any US military
  personnel who provided the Israeli military with intelligence, or even
  material support in an operation that is against international humanitarian
  law, would have helped commit that war crime. The US has previously come under
  criticism in similar cases. US help in refueling Saudi-led coalition aircraft
  in its war on Yemen drew outrage for its high civilian death toll. Even though
  it was not US pilots dropping bombs on Yemenis, their support enabled the
  coalition to continue bombarding the country. In theory, US service members
  who assisted in war crimes could face criminal prosecution, potentially in the
  US, countries with universal jurisdiction such as Belgium and Germany, or the
  international criminal court (ICC). “In principle, the Rome statute envisages
  that a person can be individually responsible for a crime under the
  jurisdiction of the Rome statute if he/she ‘aids, abets or otherwise assists
  in its commission or attempted commission,’” said Janina Dill, the co-director
  of the Oxford Institute for Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict. The ICC has
  jurisdiction over crimes committed Gaza, even if the US is not a signatory to
  the Rome statute which created it, she explained. But whether US service
  members would ever actually face prosecution for alleged war crimes is
  doubtful. The current political climate in the US, and countries with
  universal jurisdiction like Germany, is largely supportive of the war in Gaza.
  The ICC is overstretched and the US has threatened the court’s members in the
  past when it contemplated opening an investigation into misconduct in
  Afghanistan. Besides individual instances of US operational support for
  Israeli military operations in Gaza, US weapons transfers and sales have been
  critical to the war in Gaza. As of April, the US has $39.2bn in active foreign
  military sales to Israel – on top of the $4.17bn in arms transfers since
  October 2023. The result is a complete package of US support to Israel’s war
  in Gaza. The US provides the weapons via sales and arms transfers, provides
  intelligence to help Israel aim the weapons, and provides political support to
  shield Israel on the international stage from growing global backlash against
  its conduct in Gaza. Rights groups have argued that all of this military
  support should stop, in light of the growing instances of alleged war crimes.
  “Not only is the US a party to the conflict but it could be liable for war
  crimes. The American public is paying for this and I don’t think they have a
  sense of what’s being done by their own country,” said Sarah Yager, Washington
  director at HRW.
