  Whether you are going away, moving house, or have just become a bit
  complacent, there are many simple things that you can do to make your home
  safer. Here, security experts advise on the best ways to avoid being burgled.
  Be more secure than your neighbour “Thieves are generally opportunists,” says
  Anthony Neary, managing director of safe.co.uk. “If they are in a street
  looking at various houses, the one that is the least secure will get targeted.
  If you’ve got lights outside your property and someone else hasn’t, they will
  go for the people who haven’t got the lights.” Get a security light The
  evening is a common time to be burgled, says Neary. “Around September/October
  time, when the dark nights come in; you’re more at risk then, as the thief is
  hidden.” Security lights are an inexpensive deterrent: “A thief wouldn’t want
  to advertise that they’re trying to get into someone’s house. If there are
  lights flashing on, they are doing that.” Ellie Morrison is the senior
  category manager for electrical, lighting and smart home at Toolstation. “One
  of our top-selling smart items is a floodlight that also records,” she says.
  “Having that at the front and back of your house, with the added benefit of
  being able to record anyone that comes on to your property, is definitely one
  of the strongest [deterrents].” Don’t leave tools lying around “Make sure that
  tools, or any equipment that would help someone to break into property, are
  not readily available,” says Neary. “It might sound obvious – people don’t
  tend to leave things lying about – but a lot of people have got garden sheds
  that are full of tools that will help someone into your house. So shed
  security becomes really important, and people just ignore it. It has probably
  got a very basic lock on it.” If you can make it more secure, that will really
  help, says Neary. “Again, it comes back to opportunists. They will look in a
  shed, not necessarily to steal things, that’s a misconception; people aren’t
  going to steal power tools and lawn mowers. It is to get tools out of there
  that can get you into someone’s property and you don’t have to carry them
  around.” Sort your locks out “Locks are probably one of the easiest things to
  replace,” says Wayne Perrey, a DIY expert and presenter. “Let’s say you’ve
  moved into a new property or you’ve lost your keys, so there is a set out
  there somewhere: it is really easy to change. “If you’re locked out, you need
  a locksmith. But if you’re able to open the door, then on the side edge of the
  door there are normally two screws. You can undo those screws and it allows
  you to remove the barrel cylinder. Take that down to your DIY store and match
  it like for like. There will be an exact same barrel available, which will
  have a brand new set of keys.” Make sure the lock is an adequate standard for
  your insurance policy, he adds: “It should be a five lever mortice lock.” Trim
  your hedges “The downside to hedges is that they are a hiding spot,” says
  Neary. “People want them for privacy, but creating little nooks and crannies
  in your garden is not a good idea, so keep your garden trimmed as best you
  can.” Perrey recommends putting in prickly plants around boundaries: “Hawthorn
  and other spiky plants will discourage people from being able to access your
  garden: they can’t just jump over the fences, because they’re going to get
  scratched.” Embrace smart security Smart security, “allows you to keep an eye
  on what’s happening at your property at pretty much any time,” says Neary.
  “You can be abroad on holiday and easily see anything that is going on.”
  “Eighty per cent of the doorbell market is now smart doorbells,” says
  Morrison. “There are a lot of cameras where you can set up motion detection
  and just keep aware. So if something happens around your property, if someone
  drove into your gate post, for example, you would then have a record, and you
  would be able to use that for any claims that you need to make. You can also
  add things like sensors on to your doors and windows that can be tied into
  either recording or alarms, to alert the intruder that they are being
  watched,” or produce “a loud noise to summon help. It would also send you a
  push notification. A lot of it is about your awareness of your property, but
  also scaring off any potential intruders.” The downside is this can mean you
  obsess over home security when you aren’t there, says Neary: “As technology
  improves, we’re more informed all of the time, and security is just another
  aspect of that. So if you’re on the beach and your phone pings, nine times out
  of 10, it will probably turn out to be nothing, it’s a cat or whatever, but
  you don’t know so it will increase anxiety. But I think that’s just modern
  life.” Think about where cameras and sensors are positioned, says Perrey. “My
  internal Ring alarm used to go off all the time,” he says, which caused him to
  panic. Eventually, “I realised it was pointing at an area where there is major
  sunlight coming through, and if a cloud went past quickly across the sun, it
  thought somebody was walking into the lounge.” Consider an alarm “Over the
  last 10 years, alarms have become a really easy DIY install,” says Neary.
  “There are no cables any more, they run from batteries which you need to
  remember to replace. You should always have a siren externally: it’s a great
  deterrent.” What about the cheaper option of a fake alarm box? “Anything you
  can do that creates a deterrent is a benefit, even if it’s not actually doing
  anything.” “I would say you get what you pay for,” disagrees Morrison. “I
  would expect that if someone is a professional burglar, they would know which
  ones are fake and which ones aren’t. I also think that old-fashioned alarm
  systems with an alarm box are not generally what people have anyway. Most of
  the time it is less obvious cameras, and it is about catching people in the
  act. Floodlights kind of do the same thing as a fake alarm box.” Make friends
  with your neighbours “If you are friendly with your neighbours or if you’ve
  got a group of people to keep an eye on the street or estate, that is
  fantastic,” says Neary. “Neighbourhood Watch still exists. It is phasing out,
  I suspect, because it’s so easy now to have smart security, but it’s still a
  good idea.” If you are away, make your home look lived in “You want your bins
  to be put out if you possibly can,” says Neary, which is also why getting on
  with your neighbours helps. “You can get TV simulators, which are very cheap.
  They are on a timer and can come on at 6pm and go off at 10pm, and it lights
  up the room in a TV style with a flickering light. You don’t want mail to
  collect if you’re away for long periods – people can see through the door and,
  if there is a mountain of post, that is a problem.” “I use smart lighting
  inside,” says Morrison, “which, if we’re on holiday, we can turn that to a
  schedule that randomises. The lights come on, so it seems like someone’s at
  home, and it’s not an old-fashioned timer that plugs into a lamp and comes on
  for an hour a day,” the regularity of which can suggest there is actually no
  one at home. Should you leave your curtains open or shut? “I would leave them
  half down, but then have lighting that comes on at various times in the day,”
  says Morrison. Closing the curtains, says Perrey, “lets people know that
  you’re away, so I wouldn’t do that.” “I am sure curtain timers exist but they
  aren’t readily available,” says Neary. “Curtains should be closed at night,”
  if you can get someone to do that for you. Don’t post about your holiday on
  social media until you get back “With holidays, a big one is not promoting it
  on social media,” says Neary. “You are literally giving someone a roadmap of
  who’s in and who’s not.” Get a dog – or even just a dog sign “Again, it’s
  another deterrent,” says Neary. “If your neighbour’s got a dog and you
  haven’t, they would generally target you rather than your neighbour. Even if
  you’ve not got dogs, signage to say you have is better than not. That is much
  easier than having a real dog.” But Perrey says there is a school of thought
  that if people have “beware of the dog” signs, it implies that they don’t have
  an alarm system, as the animals will set it off, “and dogs can easily be
  persuaded with treats. So maybe don’t put those signs out. But also be aware
  that systems like Ring are adaptable so that pets don’t trigger them.” Having
  a dog means Neary has a housesitter when he goes away which, as long as they
  are someone trusted, can be the ultimate way to keep your home secure. Use key
  safes wisely “I do think key safes are a good thing,” says Perrey, “because
  the alternative is you tend to put them underneath a mat or a plant pot. But
  if you do have one, don’t have it on display. I recommend storing it out of
  sight.” Make sure you use a police-approved version, advises Neary, “as some
  of them are fantastically secure,” and would take 10 hours and a lot of noise
  to get into. “Unfortunately, there are really cheap lock boxes that you just
  look at them the wrong way and they’ll open.” Make sure windows are secure
  Aside from always closing and locking windows, Perrey says that everyone
  should check double glazed windows to make sure they are installed securely:
  “With a UPVC window, the glass is held in with beading that runs all the way
  around, so if your window fails or the double glazing is steamed up because
  the sealant inside has gone, you can replace the glass: the beading is taken
  off and you can just change it. Most of the time, the beading is on the inside
  of the house, but some are on the outside: if you want to break in, you could
  literally just pop off the beading, take the glass out, and climb in. So check
  your double glazing, because that could be a big issue.” Don’t forget to lock
  up “Everyone at some point goes out and forgets to lock up,” says Neary. “It
  comes down to the person just not being on it.” He has spoken to ex-burglars
  about how they entered properties: “It is incredible how many people don’t
  lock doors, don’t close windows, just take no precautions whatsoever. That was
  the most common thing from the burglars. People leave things outside like
  ladders that just make it so easy. More than anything else, people are
  completely unaware of security and how important it is.” Lastly, if you think
  you are being burgled, “keep out of the way and ring the police,” says Neary.
  “Absolutely do not confront someone because you risk getting seriously hurt.”
