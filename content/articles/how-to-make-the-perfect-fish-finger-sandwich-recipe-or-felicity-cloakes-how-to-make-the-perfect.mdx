  I must be the only person in Britain not to have grown up with fish finger
  sandwiches – we always had them with mash and peas – but after discovering
  them on pub menus as an adult, it wasn’t hard to see the appeal. These crunchy
  batons of firm, creamy fish in soft white bread, often topped with a tangy
  sauce, are surely the UK equivalent of Mexican fish tacos or West African fish
  rolls – a quick, nutritious and very satisfying light meal or snack. (NB: if
  you’re skim-reading this before leaping below the line to demand to know who
  needs a recipe for a fish finger sandwich, I can assure you a lot of people
  online seem to feel there’s a demand.) Given their popularity (indeed, this
  column was a reader request), I must echo Helen Graves, who prefaces her
  recipe thus: “I am bracing myself for the comeback on this one, because
  everyone (or at least everyone in the UK) has an opinion on what makes the
  perfect fish finger sandwich.” As ever, all feedback much appreciated! The
  fish The classic and, of course, the easiest choice is to use readymade fish
  fingers, as Signe Johansen recommends in her book Solo. For some, nostalgia
  makes this the only option, and I certainly wouldn’t knock it; modern fish
  fingers tend to be much chunkier than the weedy grey sticks of my childhood,
  in which the filling always looked mysteriously ready-chewed. However, there
  are advantages to making your own, principally that you can choose your own
  fish and precision engineer the coating. Most recipes I find call for cod or
  haddock, or both if you’re Graves, but Edinburgh’s Little Chartroom chef
  Roberta Hall McCarron uses sole, and north London “sandwich genius” (I quote
  About Time magazine) Max Halley throws the door wide open, writing in Max’s
  Sandwich Book that “cod is back in vogue, but who knows? Haddock? Whiting and
  sole would be delicious”. As so often with fish, the best option is generally
  the one that looks freshest on the day, and is most sustainable. My
  preference, however, if it’s available, is for anything that comes in thick
  fillets, because I find the sole and the end of one of the haddock fillets too
  thin: it throws off the ratio of fish to crumb. Go for whatever fits the bill,
  though – I suspect hake would be an excellent choice. Graves salts the fish
  for half an hour before cooking, “to firm up the texture, so what you get is
  really satisfying flakes of well-seasoned fish, not mushiness”. Though they’re
  rinsed afterwards, I like the way this seasons the dish from the inside out,
  but I actually prefer the softer texture of fish salted just before cooking –
  it shouldn’t be mushy. If you have similar textural objections, however, this
  is a step you may like to consider. The coating I’m relieved to find that no
  one batters their fish fingers; this is not a fish supper in portable form,
  but flour, egg and breadcrumb territory. Graves, Hall McCarron and Halley all
  plump for panko, the large flaked, white, ultra-crisp Japanese variety that’s
  taken the western crumbing world by storm in recent years; only Kirsty Scobie
  and Fenella Renwick, proprietors of Ullapool’s Seafood Shack and authors of an
  award-winning book of the same name, recommend the fluffier kind made from
  fresh bread. For me, all breadcrumbed fish is delicious, but for this purpose
  I slightly prefer the crunchier texture of fried panko – if I were baking the
  fish, I suspect I might go for fresh crumbs instead, because dry breadcrumbs
  will inevitably become even dryer in the heat of the oven. (Home-dried
  breadcrumbs would, of course, be a perfectly acceptable substitute.)
  Flavour-wise, you could just stick to salt and pepper, as Halley does, or you
  could capitalise on the freedom of making your own to spice things up a bit.
  The Seafood Shack chefs suggest chopped fresh herbs such as parsley and dill,
  while Graves describes her mix of panko and cayenne pepper as “super-crisp
  with just a tiny bit of warmth”, before going on to explain: “We also added a
  titchy pinch of MSG because we like to live on the edge in this house. That’s
  totally optional, just as long as you know that being scared of MSG is
  pointless.” Hall McCarron, meanwhile, mixes her panko with blitzed oats and
  pumpkin seeds, then flavours them with garlic and onion powder and nutritional
  yeast, on the basis that, as she points out in her book The Changing Tides:
  “You can’t go wrong with a fish finger sandwich. And you certainly can’t go
  wrong when the fish is coated in breadcrumbs and yeast flakes.” All of these
  are very valid options – my testers and I particularly like the savoury notes
  that the yeast and MSG bring with them. And, though I haven’t included them in
  my recipe, I’d also urge you to give the pumpkin seeds in particular a go;
  they give the crumb an interestingly nubbly texture. The sauces Personally,
  like Scobie and Renwick, I’m a tartare girl; the combination of rich
  mayonnaise cut with acidic pickles, savoury alliums (they use shallots, I like
  chives) and salty capers is perfect with fried fish. It seems, however, that
  this is not the will of the people – Graves describes tartare as “the
  fancypants choice” (guilty as charged, Helen), explaining that the key to a
  perfect fish finger sandwich “is to use a mayonnaise-based sauce and ketchup.
  I know. You are reeling,” she continues kindly. “The reason it works is
  because the ketchup offers something I was always missing in the fish finger
  sandwich: sweetness. People tend to go OTT on the acidity, I find, adding
  lemon juice, capers, vinegar et al, but let me tell you once more –
  double-sauce is where it’s at.” Halley agrees, but he uses salad cream (a
  mayonnaise-adjacent sauce, I suppose?), describing the mix of that and ketchup
  as “SO good”. Mind you, he goes on to boast about blending a whole pork pie in
  the stuff to make a dip, so he’s definitely a salad cream superfan, whereas it
  reminds me of early 1990s school lunches, and not in a good way, I’m afraid.
  Confession time: I find ketchup too sweet and vinegary in most contexts – like
  chocolate, it’s a flavour bully, dominating everything it touches – but I’m
  well aware this is a minority opinion. My own second choice is Johansen’s
  punchy green Nordic dill salsa, which also contains parsley, anchovies,
  gherkins, capers, horseradish, lemon juice and olive oil. “Admittedly,” she
  writes, “a good old fish finger sarnie tastes incredible with just a good
  squirt of ketchup, but once in a while I like a fresh green sauce to grace
  those crispy little fish sticks. This dill salsa is a great way of using up
  any odds and ends you have in the fridge – such as sad, forgotten herbs,
  condiments and pickles. Treat the recipe as a guide and please do play around
  with the flavours to make it your own.” Lest you be in any doubt that ketchup
  is not the only choice available, Hall McCarron gilds her fish finger sandwich
  with a two-ingredient roasted garlic mayonnaise, bringing back happy holiday
  memories of mountains of fried seafood dunked in aïoli. No doubt most of you
  will probably shake your head at such notions, but don’t knock them until
  you’ve tried them. The extras Graves favours the cool crunch of iceberg
  lettuce, while Halley prefers the oily one of crumbled Scampi Fries (a
  particularly noxious, yet undeniably moreish brand of pub snack, for readers
  outside the UK). Hall McCarron makes a celeriac and butternut squash slaw
  flavoured with crushed wakame, which delivers crunch and a more subtle touch
  of the sweetness that Graves feels is missing without ketchup (it is also much
  less work than it sounds (grate both vegetables, add salt and seaweed powder).
  My favourite extra, however, is the Seafood Shack’s minty peas: frozen petits
  pois, blitzed with mint and lemon juice, which brings sweetness, freshness,
  and comforting echoes of my childhood (not that we pureed them). As this is
  not your childhood, you should feel free to replace it, or indeed eschew any
  sort of garnish as an unnecessary complication of what should be a simple
  pleasure. The cooking If you’re using bought fish fingers, baking is the way
  to go; it’s classic and low-faff. If you’re making your own fish fingers,
  however, I regretfully share the ill tidings that the baked versions are a
  poor second to the fried variety, and drier inside and out. You don’t need to
  deep-fry them, though; a few centimetres of oil in a frying pan will do the
  job, and if you’re going to the trouble of making your own fish fingers, you
  may as well cook them right, too. The sandwich bread When I see that more than
  half the recipes call for toasted bread, I begin to question everything I
  thought I knew about fish finger sarnies – surely most of the pleasure comes
  from the contrast in textures between bread and filling? For this reason, I
  will only countenance soft, fluffy white bread (a white tin loaf from my local
  bakery for me, though you may well be in the Halley Mother’s Pride camp). Or,
  Hall McCarron’s white roll would work (she mentions brioche, but I think a bap
  would be nicer). You can fight me on this in the comments; I won’t change my
  mind – though I will make an allowance for Johansen’s happy suggestion that:
  “If you’ve had a really rotten day, or spent it doing seriously strenuous
  exercise, fry the bread in butter”. That I might come round to. Perfect fish
  finger sandwiches Prep 25 min Cook 8 min Serves 4 For the tartare sauce (or
  use ketchup and/or mayonnaise) 200g mayonnaise, bought or homemade 1 tsp dijon
  mustard 1 heaped tbsp chopped capers 1 heaped tbsp chopped cornichons, or
  other vinegary gherkins 1 heaped tbsp chopped parsley, or dill ½ tbsp chopped
  chives For the fish fingers (or use eight ready made) 2 skinless fillets thick
  white fish (about 400g) – eg, cod, hake, haddock Salt and pepper 50g plain
  flour 2 eggs 125g panko breadcrumbs, or other dried breadcrumbs 20g
  nutritional yeast flakes, or ½ tsp MSG powder (optional) Neutral oil, for
  frying 8 slices good soft white bread, or 4 soft white rolls Butter, at room
  temperature For the minty pea puree 200g frozen peas 1 small bunch fresh mint,
  leaves picked ½ tbsp lemon juice 1 tsp horseradish sauce (optional) Stir all
  the ingredients for the tartare sauce in a bowl, then adjust and season to
  taste. Bring a kettle to a boil for the peas. If you’re making the fish
  fingers, cut the fish into eight roughly fish finger-shaped logs, then season
  well. Put the flour on a plate with a little salt and pepper, beat the eggs in
  a shallow bowl, and put the breadcrumbs and yeast or MSG, or any other
  seasoning you might like to add, on a third plate or shallow bowl. Roll the
  fish in turn in the flour to coat, then in the egg, shaking off any excess,
  then in the crumbs. If frying the fish fingers – which I’d advise for
  homemade, though you can bake them on a lightly oiled tray at 200C (180C
  fan)/390F/gas 6 for 20 minutes if you prefer, turning once halfway – heat a
  few centimetres of neutral oil in a frying pan until it reaches 180C. While
  the oil is heating, cook the peas in salted boiling water for three minutes,
  then drain. Briefly return the peas to the hot pan to steam dry, then use a
  stick blender or mini chopper to whizz them and the other puree ingredients to
  a chunky puree. Season this to taste. When the oil comes to temperature, fry
  the fish for two to three minutes on each side, until golden brown, then drain
  on kitchen paper. (If baking readymade fish fingers, do so according to packet
  instructions.) Butter four slices of bread or the bottom half of four rolls,
  then top each with some of the puree, followed by two fish fingers, followed
  by a dollop of sauce. Close with the remaining bread/roll lids, cut in half
  (unless using rolls) and serve immediately. Fish finger sandwiches – am I the
  only person in the UK to be late to the party (indeed, are they popular
  farther afield?), and please, do let me know, what am I doing wrong? The
