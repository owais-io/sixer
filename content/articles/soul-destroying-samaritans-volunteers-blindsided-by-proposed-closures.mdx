  At the Walsall branch of Samaritans, it has been a tough few years of
  campaigning for the funds needed to replace the now leaky portable cabin they
  have operated out of for the past 60 years. After raising almost £300,000,
  they are on the home stretch towards reaching their final goal, and being able
  to replace the building they use to help local people in the depths of crisis.
  Then came the shock announcement from Samaritans central office: that it
  proposes to close at least half of its 200 branches across the UK and Ireland
  in the next 10 years. One member of the Walsall team said: “We just don’t know
  what to do now. Do we carry on? It’s soul-destroying.” Dozens of branches
  across the country have raised alarm at the charity’s “in principle”
  decisions, which are still under consultation until the board of trustees meet
  in September, fearing it could lead to a loss of volunteers and morale. These
  include moving volunteers into larger regional hubs, which some fear will
  create a “call-centre-style” model, and piloting remote call handling.
  Volunteers at the Walsall branch said they had been blindsided by the news.
  “We had an event last week and someone else had raised £1,000 for us, and we
  didn’t know what to do. Do we take the money? Because we know now that our
  branch could be closed,” one volunteer, who asked to remain anonymous, said.
  “Every step of the way, central office have known exactly what we’re doing.
  And we’ve got this money and we’re very concerned about whether it has been
  ringfenced for the building. Because that is what it was raised for.” She said
  the portable cabin they had used for decades had slowly fallen into disrepair
  and was in dire need of replacement. “At one point we were frightened to use
  the toilet because the floor was going to give way,” she said. They originally
  set out to raise £250,000 in 2023 but were advised by Samaritans central
  office earlier this year to revise their target up to £320,000 due to rising
  building costs. They received many donations from other branches, the
  volunteer said, as well as from members of the public. Samaritans central
  office said it was in discussion with the Walsall branch on its possible
  options. A number of Samaritans listening volunteers said they were worried
  the charity was spending too much of its funding on staff salaries, at the
  expense of the branches run by unpaid volunteers. The average number of paid
  employees at the charity has increased from 277 in 2022 to 305 in 2024, and
  more than £15m of the charity’s total income of £24.6m went on wages last
  year. Of the 201 Samaritans branches, 144 are affiliated organisations that
  are separate legal entities with their own financial accounts, who organise
  their own fundraising and give a portion of the money they raise to the
  central office. Volunteers said they were told that last year these affiliate
  branches received a total income of £11.1m and spent £9.3m. The charity’s
  central office said that money was not the primary reason for proposing to
  close branches, and that ultimately it wanted to reduce fragmentation across
  its service, although volunteers had reported having to spend more time and
  effort maintaining the buildings they operated in. In a video sent to the
  charity’s 20,000 volunteers, the Samaritans CEO, Julie Bentley, said: “Much of
  the money that is currently raised from the public in the name of Samaritans
  is necessarily going into maintaining these bricks and mortar, rather than
  being used to improve our services.” Volunteers have been told the charity
  could not provide an “overall figure” for how much money is spent on
  buildings. Many said they were also worried about a potential exodus of
  volunteers who may not want to continue their shifts if forced to travel to a
  branch further away, or work from home. This year, the Folkestone, Dover and
  Hythe branch was closed after a safeguarding issue, with only six of the 55
  listening volunteers based there choosing to move to another branch. “People
  love being a listener, I cannot emphasise enough how important it is to
  people, so integral to who they are. And they are really devastated, but they
  can’t continue,” said Nicola Ellingham, a former IT support volunteer at the
  branch. “They can’t get to the other branches. They’re just too far away. And
  they feel they’ve been let down.” The former Labour strategist turned
  political commentator Alastair Campbell, who has spoken openly about his
  mental health, said he was worried by the plans as Samaritans was “very much a
  branch organisation”. “The branches give resources to the centre,” he said on
  The Rest is Politics podcast. “The thing that is really unique about the
  Samaritans, sometimes they’re called the fourth emergency service. There is
  something very special about them.” His co-host, the former Conservative
  minister Rory Stewart, said: “This sounds like they’re going down the wrong
  path. I’m sure providing advice to people works best when you have a local
  branch network that understands local conditions. I’m sure they’re
  underestimating what they’ll lose in fundraising from these voluntary
  branches. Most charities that have gone down this path … have regretted it and
  ended up killing a lot of the spirit and soul of the organisation in the
  process.” Samaritans has been approached for comment.
