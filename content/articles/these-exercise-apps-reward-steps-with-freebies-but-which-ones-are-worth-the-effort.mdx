  effort?

  Getting your steps in could do more than just lift your mood: walking is
  linked to lower rates of depression and anxiety; better cardiovascular health;
  and improved memory. The NHS says just 10 minutes of brisk walking a day is
  enough to make a difference. And alongside health benefits, your steps could
  also earn you rewards such as coffee and other small treats, thanks to a
  growing number of apps that turn your footsteps into freebies. The government
  is looking at whether financial incentives could encourage more people to
  increase the amount they walk and improve their diet. It is now reviewing the
  results of an official pilot scheme in Wolverhampton where people were given
  fitness trackers and earned rewards such as money off their supermarket shop.
  In the meantime we tested some apps that let you swap your steps for stuff.
  Paace If you are looking for immediate, tangible rewards, Paace is the most
  straightforward of the bunch. It will not tell you exactly how many steps
  equal a point, but the points you earn can be exchanged for offers such as
  money off your coffee, sandwiches, or even a packet of smoked salmon at
  independent cafes and restaurants (mostly) in London. The app has had more
  than 98,000 downloads and there are now more than 200 Paace partner vendors.
  The app sets a daily target of 8,000 steps. It took me about a week to earn
  enough points to get my first reward – an iced latte for £1 and 90 points – a
  discount on the £3.70 the cafe normally charges. For this, I walked an average
  of 14,000 steps a day over that period (I was on a city break for part of it),
  which gave me just under 100 points. To make a purchase, you add the items to
  your basket and swipe to “unlock” the reward. Be careful: you only have 15
  minutes to use the voucher after you have unlocked it, so do not make the
  mistake I almost made and open it too early. In total, I have saved £15.10 and
  spent just under 500 Paace points (that is the maximum you can store without
  upgrading and paying for Paace+ at £29.99 a year, or £4.99 a month). When
  signing up, you have to share personal information, including your name, email
  address, and phone number. It is also recommended you share location data so
  you can see what is available locally. You can turn this off in settings and
  still search for places near you in the map feature, but some features may not
  work. Jack Blackwell, the owner at Debbie Jo bakery in west London, says Paace
  has helped increase footfall and attracted new customers to his business. “I
  liked the idea of getting people moving. For me, that’s always something to
  encourage,” he says. “But it’s also great for customer acquisition. If someone
  comes in, you’re hoping that customer is finding out about your cafe and
  coming back. It’s definitely driven traffic.” The app has also brought a new
  kind of customer. “Paace definitely brings a younger audience, especially
  people in their 20s, people who are active,” Blackwell says. He adds that
  businesses can customise the rewards available “as much as we like”, which can
  help on days where it tends to be less busy. “On a weekday, if it’s quieter I
  can shift my offering on Paace, which is great for getting people in,”
  Blackwell says. Sweatcoin You must be at least 13 to sign up to this app,
  which rewards your steps with its own digital currency (Sweatcoin) that you
  can then spend on offers in its in-app marketplace. The marketplace mostly
  features promotional offers, such as free trials or “just pay postage” deals
  on anything from discounted protein bars and socks to money off yoga
  subscriptions and fitness gear, rather than straightforward rewards you can
  claim without a catch. You can also earn daily rewards (up to 21 coins if you
  build a streak) for watching adverts. Sweatcoin sets a 12,000 steps-a-day
  target, a goal I usually failed to reach. And unlike Paace, the rewards are
  not local or particularly immediate. There is also a whole separate
  crypto-element – “Sweat”, a token you can earn if you opt into its
  blockchain-based version of the app. I didn’t. After a month using the app, I
  was able to get various free trials, including: a week’s supply of magnesium
  glycinate (though I had to cover the £3.95 postage); free discounts on
  HelloFresh and Green Chef; a one-month audible free trial for 25 sweatcoins;
  and 10% off full-priced items at Nike for 130 coins. You can get more if you
  upgrade to the Premium account for £24.99 a year, or £4.99 a month, which can
  earn you extra Sweatcoins for your steps. You can also earn daily rewards (up
  to 21 coins if you build a streak) for watching advertisements. Sweatcoin does
  not require much from you. Like Paace, it runs in the background, logs your
  steps and every so often you remember it exists and check how many coins you
  have got. Whether you will ever actually use them is another matter. Users
  must input their mobile phone number for verification, and their email
  address. Sweatcoin says it may also collect data about your contacts,
  photographs and payment information. BetterPoints This app rewards active
  commuting, with points for walking, cycling, taking public transport and, in
  some cases, recycling or attending exercise classes. You can exchange points
  for vouchers to use on Amazon, Argos and New Look. You can also choose to
  donate them to charities including Air Ambulances UK and Cancer Research UK.
  However, there is a catch: BetterPoints only works properly if the local
  council or a partner organisation is running a programme in your area.
  Participating councils include: Newham and Southwark in London; Sheffield;
  York; Oxfordshire, Leicestershire, and East Dunbartonshire, Wrexham and
  Deeside. If you are in an active area, you will earn points for specific
  activities – such as tracking a walk with GPS (rather than steps), scanning a
  QR code on a council recycling bin, or checking in at a participating gym. In
  other parts of the country, you can still track your activity in the app, but
  you will not earn redeemable points. You may still be able to enter prize
  draws. You can turn on tracking so it logs your trips automatically, but it is
  not always accurate. For example, it recorded a cycle on an e-bike as a car
  journey, and you cannot edit it after the day is done – so it is worth
  checking regularly if you are trying to earn points. Unfortunately, my borough
  is not on the scheme, which means all I could do was track my walks without
  benefiting financially. When signing up, you share your name, email address,
  year of birth, location, and postcode. You have to allow location tracking,
  and must be at least 13 years old. What about your data All of the apps ask
  for – and collect – information about you. Dr Maryam Mehrnezhad, a reader in
  the information security department at Royal Holloway, University of London,
  says that the tradeoff is simple: you are paying for the app’s free rewards
  with your personal data. “These companies may use it for various things. For
  instance, your data – like where you walk and how often – is used for targeted
  ads. Or when you redeem a reward or a discount from a brand, the app gets paid
  a commission,” she says. “They can also sell large amounts of potentially
  anonymised data to other companies. This helps those companies understand big
  trends.” Mehrnezhad says users should be wary of how their health and location
  data is being used. “While apps claim to use anonymised data, it can often be
  re-identified to reveal sensitive information about your routines, like where
  you live and work. “This data is highly valuable and can be used to create
  detailed profiles for targeted advertising or other commercial purposes, and
  it also creates a risk of a data breach, which could expose your health
  information and personal locations to hackers,” she adds. Users can limit the
  data that walking apps collect by managing their phone and in-app settings.
  “One effective way is to adjust app permissions on their device, such as
  setting location services to ‘Only While Using the App’ to prevent background
  tracking,” Mehrnezhad says. However, she notes that this may affect the
  usability of the app. “You must decide if the benefits are worth these risks.
  I personally have a problem with any app that wants to know my location at all
  times,” she says. The best of the rest Other apps and companies also offer
  rewards for getting fit and staying healthy. They include: • The health
  insurer Vitality, which offers policyholders the chance to earn points when
  they get active – such as when walking every day or going to the gym. Points
  unlock weekly and monthly “Active Rewards”. For example, earn 12 activity
  points in a week and you can choose either a weekly “reward” at Caffè Nero (a
  free drink or 50% off one, depending on the plan you have), plus 25% off a
  meal at Itsu; or 50% off an Odeon or Vue cinema ticket. A workout at a
  participating gym could earn you five points, a 5km parkrun earn you eight.
  You’ll need to download the app and connect your phone or fitness tracker. •
  The retailer Decathlon lets customers earn points and turn them into vouchers
  for use online or instore. On top of 10 points for every £1 you spend at the
  retailer, you can earn 150 points a week by taking part in 150 minutes of
  sport. This involves logging your sport activity via a connected app such as
  Strava, Garmin or Kiprun. You can also earn points by sharing product reviews
  on items you have bought. For 2,000 points, you get a £3 Decathlon voucher,
  while 6,000 gets you a £10 voucher. • Biscuit is an app for dog owners that
  lets you earn points – called Biscuits – by tracking your dog walks and
  completing “wellbeing badges” (for preventative care such as flea and worm
  treatments and vaccinations) and challenges. You redeem your points for
  vouchers at brands such as Costa Coffee, Tesco, Amazon and Nando’s. The basic
  version of the app is free, but the paid-for version (from £3.99 a month)
  “unlocks 5x faster Biscuit earning”. A spokesperson says a user of the
  paid-for version can earn enough points for a coffee “in as little as 23 days”
  by tracking their walks.
