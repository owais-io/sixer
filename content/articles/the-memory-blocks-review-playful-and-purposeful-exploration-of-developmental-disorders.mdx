  The Memory Blocks review – playful and purposeful exploration of developmental
  disorders

  Artist and film-maker Andrew Kötting returns to the themes of consciousness
  and memory (both individual and collective) in this playful and ruminative
  docu-essay, in which he is again working with his daughter Eden; she is at
  once his subject and his collaborator. Eden was born in 1988 with the genetic
  disorder Joubert syndrome; she draws and paints and often appears in Kötting’s
  films. I have in the past wondered aloud if Kötting might tackle the
  challenges of being with Eden more straightforwardly. But perhaps that was
  obtuse of me; it could be that it is only this complex, layered, tonally
  elusive approach which refuses the conventional grammar of clinical concern
  does justice to the idea of seeing the world as Eden sees it. The film has
  Eden dressed in a blue gingham pinafore dress of the kind associated with
  Alice in Wonderland (and therefore, perhaps, associating her with the idea of
  a journey or pilgrimage which is often a trope in Kötting’s films). She is in
  a group alongside other adults with learning-development issues and on the
  shop floor of a factory where they are pretending that they are producing
  “memory blocks” with machine tools and 3D printers: hollowed-out metal blocks
  which are the containers or constituent elements of memory. They participate
  in the fiction that these blocks will stimulate consciousness and send them
  back in time to happy memories; 3D animated images of nuts and bolts float
  across the screen. They are a happy supportive group with a genial
  relationship with Kötting, whose voice can be heard off-camera. At one point
  he asks them where they would like to travel; one woman says Prague, Eden says
  France (a place of happy memories) and another man says Locarno in
  Switzerland, because he likes Von Kleist’s ghost story The Beggar Woman of
  Locarno. Eden is also shown walking in huge landscapes, alone with her walking
  frame, or with her friends, or with others in fancy dress and costumes. These
  unselfconscious performances or enactments might be bringing us close to an
  understanding of what Eden thinks and feels – but maybe that isn’t the point
  and perhaps Eden, or those close to her, have no great need for this kind of
  insight and the object is more a kind of quietist harmony. Either way, the
  calmly purposeful originality of Kötting’s work is valuable. • The Memory
  Blocks screened at the Edinburgh film festival.
