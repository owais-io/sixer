  From London Recommended if you like Nala Sinephro, Ambrose Akinmusire, Moritz
  von Oswald Trio Up next Debut album Plunge out 5 September The harp is having
  a resurgence in jazz. Instrumentalists such as Nala Sinephro, Alina
  Bzhezhinska, Marysia Osu and Brandee Younger have recently released records
  that reference the decades-old legacies of harp pioneers Alice Coltrane and
  Dorothy Ashby while creating new fusions of ambient electronics, soul and free
  jazz. The latest entry into this burgeoning genre is London-based trio Flur.
  Comprised of harpist Miriam Adefris, saxophonist Isaac Robertson and drummer
  Dillon Harrison, the group produce a distinctly off-kilter take on the harp
  combo, harnessing the lushness of its sound as a counterpoint to angular
  melodies and textural rhythm. Having cut their teeth as band members for the
  likes of flautist Shabaka Hutchings, producer Floating Points and vocalist
  Ganavya, the group revel in a downtempo restlessness on their debut album,
  Plunge. The songs Nightdiver and Over Under play through a meditative
  selection of sweeping harp string runs before Robertson’s atonal, long-drawn
  saxophone lines stop the compositions from settling into a predictable mood.
  Then Bolete interweaves percussive harp plucking with Harrison’s fractal
  groove and jarring scrapes of synth sounds, and Hold Fast Old Kelp riffs off a
  lo-fi electronic loop that is so sparse it feels on the verge of falling
  apart. It is this sense of anticipation and unpredictability that makes Flur
  so engaging. Their ambience is cut through with unease and their dynamism
  combined with a loping swing. In this trio’s hands, the harp is more than just
  a soft and comforting sound. With headline live shows still to come, their
  evolution of the instrument’s potential seems unbound. Ammar Kalia This week’s
  best new tracks Alabama Shakes – Another Life A decade after their last album
  – and newly a trio – Alabama Shakes return with a showstopper that builds from
  spotlit tension to rich, moody soul and a furious, cathartic peak. Laura
  Snapes Chat Pile &amp; Hayden Pedigo – Radioactive Dreams The long-teased
  collaboration between the Oklahoma City noise band and the fingerpicking
  guitarist finds the gorgeously gloomy middle ground between their respective
  sludge and wide-open spaces. LS Spoon – Guess I’m Fallin in Love Both nasal
  and throaty, aloof and pained, Spoon’s Britt Daniel still has one of the
  coolest voices in rock. As the band eye an 11th studio album, this return
  track is a hard-driving celebration of saying the L-word. Ben Beaumont-Thomas
  Sofie Royer – Auto Powered by serried ranks of new wave guitars, this is
  another triumph from the multilingual alt-popper, here choosing German for a
  song about the euphoria and erotic charge of driving fast. BBT Kettama &amp;
  Clouds – Sort It Out Speed garage plus hardcore plus trance plus Bicep-esque
  chords? The Irish producer Kettama is so enjoyably shameless in fusing the
  most fun bits of dance music together; this new track offers laser-reaching
  transcendence. BBT Oliver Sim – Obsession This is Sim’s first track not to be
  produced by his xx bandmate Jamie xx. Instead, Bullion and Jockstrap’s Taylor
  Skye helm this nervy anxiety attack about “obsession mistaken for love”. LS
  Oli XL – Conspiracy Girl (ft Valeria Litvakov) The Warp-signed producer has
  dropped the first seven-track segment of his album Lick the Lens. This is a
  beguiling highlight: an English folk song that might have been sung at harvest
  time, but digital and glitching. BBT Subscribe to the Guardian’s rolling Add
