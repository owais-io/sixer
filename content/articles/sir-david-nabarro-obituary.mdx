  Many young people start out wanting to make a difference. Sir David Nabarro,
  who has died aged 75, was unusual in recognising early on the power of
  synergy. Aged 17, he was the subject of a 1967 BBC documentary on volunteering
  when he spent a year as organiser of Youth Action, leading a group of 400
  volunteers in York, between leaving Oundle public school and going to Oxford
  University to study medicine. That experience – coordinating efforts for
  maximum impact – presaged a life in public service spent urging, cajoling and
  commanding others to work together. After stints as a medical officer in Iraq
  and Nepal, and as a health and population adviser in Kenya, he joined the
  World Health Organization, and subsequently the UN, leading the responses to
  the 2004 Indian ocean tsunami, the 2014 Ebola outbreak in west Africa and the
  2016 cholera outbreak in Haiti. But it was as the WHO’s special envoy for
  Covid-19, one of six appointed by the director general, that Nabarro became
  best known in the UK. He described the pandemic as a “health crisis unlike
  anything we have encountered in my professional experience”. He was early to
  advocate the use of masks and testing, tracing and isolating infected
  individuals, but courted controversy with his remarks on lockdowns – which he
  said were misquoted. He argued that lockdowns should be used as “circuit
  breakers”, as a reserve measure to temporarily slow the spread of the virus,
  buying time and allowing the NHS and similar institutions to reorganise,
  regroup and rebalance their resources and protect their workers. In an
  interview with BBC Radio 4 in 2020 he cautioned against a full national
  lockdown, describing it as “a very extreme restriction on economic and social
  life” that temporarily “freezes the virus in place”. He added: “You don’t want
  to use those as your primary, and I stress primary, means of containment.
  Because in the end living with the virus as a constant threat means
  maintaining the capacity to find people with the disease and isolating them.”
  The primary measure, he thought, should be a robust test, trace and isolate
  system, with lockdown “the reserve you use to take the heat out of the system
  when things are really bad”. As a lifelong champion of health equity, he was
  critical of the global response to the pandemic. He lamented the way that
  politics had begun shifting how governments responded to global health
  emergencies. In a 2021 interview with NPR, the US public radio network, he
  recalled how the global response to Ebola in 2014 had been “amazing”, but that
  by the time Covid-19 developed in 2020 things had changed. “There has been a
  funny shift,” he said. “I find world leaders are no longer apparently able to
  work together and deal with this through a global response.” Despite his
  disappointment he worked tirelessly to protect the UK and beyond from the
  pandemic, arguing forcefully for vaccine equity. “The one thing we want [at
  the WHO] is every country in the world to be able to access a fair share of
  the vaccine,” he said. He was knighted in 2023. His kindness, humility and
  decency won loyalty from staff, though his work ethic could be challenging. He
  was the “Gandalf of the UN”, said Aurélia Nguyen of the Coalition for Epidemic
  Preparedness Innovations. He was “always working behind the scenes for a
  broader purpose in ways that were not visible or needing to take credit but
  quietly bringing people to the table who otherwise would not speak to each
  other. He worked all hours relentlessly – some of his staff may say
  mercilessly – but with such conviction and passion it was impossible not to
  follow him.” Born in London, David was one of the four children of Sir John
  Nabarro, a consultant endocrinologist, and Joan (nee Cockrell). David was
  educated at Oundle school, Northamptonshire, before studying medicine at
  Worcester College, Oxford, and University College hospital, London. He joined
  WHO in 1999, working first on malaria and later, alongside the
  director-general Gro Harlem Brundtland on the creation of the global fund to
  fight Aids, tuberculosis and malaria, which has since saved millions of lives.
  In 2003 he survived the bombing of the Canal hotel in Baghdad while serving as
  WHO representative for health action in crises. He was appointed senior UN
  system coordinator for avian influenza (bird flu) in 2005, establishing him as
  a pioneer in pandemic preparedness. His most visible role on the international
  stage came in 2014 when he coordinated an unprecedented response to the Ebola
  outbreak in west Africa. Facing a situation where “the number of people
  getting sick was doubling every week”, he helped bring the epidemic under
  control by engaging the community, building trust and addressing social and
  economic factors alongside delivering medical aid. Championing the synergy
  between social and medical interventions stands as the legacy of his lifetime
  of service. In 2019 he became co-director, with me, of the Institute of Global
  Health Innovation at Imperial College London, a role to which he brought his
  vast operational experience, remarkable ability to build consensus among
  diverse stakeholders, and readiness to mentor young researchers. His office
  was always open to students and colleagues seeking guidance, and his generous
  spirit enriched the academic community. Nabarro is survived by his second
  wife, Florence Lasbennes, whom he married in 2019, and by five children – two
  sons and a daughter from a relationship with Susanna Graham-Jones, and a
  daughter and son from his marriage to Gillian Holmes, which ended in divorce –
  and seven grandchildren. • David Nunes Nabarro, global health strategist, born
  26 August 1949; died 26 July 2025
