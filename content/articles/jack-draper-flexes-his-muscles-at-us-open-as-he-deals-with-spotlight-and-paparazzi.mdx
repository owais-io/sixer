  During the typically chaotic media day before Wimbledon in June, Jannik Sinner
  and Jack Draper were working through their commitments when they briefly
  crossed paths in the broadcast media mixed zone. As they warmly greeted each
  other, Sinner looked his good friend up and down, and a smile spread across
  his face: “Always stronger,” he said, jokingly flexing both arms. Draper, who
  responded with a sheepish, embarrassed laugh, has heard such observations many
  times in recent months. At the same time that he has risen up the rankings
  over the past 15 months, transforming himself into one of the best in the
  world, he has become one of the most physically strong players on the ATP
  Tour. At 6ft 4in (193cm), Draper has always stood as an imposing figure on the
  court, but more recently he has filled out into a more muscular athlete. This
  evolution has coincided with his decision to enlist the services of the
  strength and conditioning coach Matt Little and the physio Shane Annun, both
  of whom worked for many years with Andy Murray until his retirement. Draper is
  insistent that his increased size has been a natural consequence of his
  physical maturation with age rather than a concerted attempt to gain more
  muscle. “I’m growing out instead of up now,” he said. “So I’ve definitely got
  that body type where I can get really strong quite quick. And I think when you
  train really hard with your legs, it also goes up the chain as well. I’m
  definitely getting stronger all the time.” Draper describes Little as the best
  strength and conditioning coach with whom he has worked, but he notes that he
  has been working hard on his physicality for a long time. Many afternoons at
  the National Tennis Centre in Roehampton have been dedicated to brutal
  sessions on the VersaClimber, with Draper estimating that he has completed
  nearly 50 sessions this year. There have been no-arm days “because I don’t
  want to get too big” and although his recent forearm injury allowed him to
  spend significant time in the gym during his injury layoff over the past seven
  weeks, those sessions have been tennis specific. “I don’t do bench press. I’m
  not training to be Mr Olympia,” he said. “But you do a few different exercises
  here and there, tennis specific. I think that’s the thing, when people see
  athletes and they’re like: ‘Oh, they must have been in the gym.’ Sometimes,
  we’re still young, and we’re still just developing, and if you don’t see us
  for two months, there’s going to be development happening. So always make sure
  that I’m not doing anything that’s risky or going to jeopardise the fact that
  I can play.” Draper arrived in New York without having played a match for more
  than seven weeks after being diagnosed with bone bruising in his left humerus.
  After a four-set win over Federico Agustin Gomez in the first round on Monday
  he had feared he would be pushing the expected recovery time of eight weeks.
  “The arm for me is not a question mark,” he said. “It’s more been my
  preparation for the tournament, how quickly am I going to be able to get back
  to playing top level on the hard courts, like I was at the start of the year.
  It was never going to be perfect and match by match I’m going to grow in
  confidence. “I’m never someone who has lots of expectations on myself anyway.
  I’m someone who goes match by match and usually, because of my preparation,
  because of different things, it works out. I’d never enter one of these
  tournaments if I was here just to play a couple of matches - I wouldn’t play.
  I’m here to hopefully go a long way in this draw and I believe I can still.”
  In addition to more people paying attention to his physical gains, Draper is
  also coming to terms with the increased attention and interest in his career.
  Before Wimbledon, he had his first experience with paparazzi taking photos of
  him while at a petrol station. Draper used this subject to offer an
  impassioned defence of his secondhand Volkswagen Polo, which featured
  prominently in the photos. “Didn’t know about it. I think a few people said to
  me, like: ‘Why are you driving that piece of shit?’ But I’ve never really been
  into cars,” Draper said, smiling. “I’m not really that materialistic with
  stuff. I think with most people, when they get a bit of money, they buy a car,
  you know? But for me, I don’t know. I just love my secondhand Polo, you know?
  I just love racing it around. That’s probably the wrong word, because you only
  do 20 [mph] in London, but I love my car.” During Wimbledon the British player
  Jack Pinnington Jones, who used to be ferried by Draper to the Roehampton
  centre early in the morning each day, said Draper does not treat his car very
  well. He did not deny the accusation: “Well, it’s my brother’s car as well so
  maybe I have to be a bit careful what I say,” he said, laughing. “But put it
  this way, if it does get a little knock, then I’m not going to be crying about
  it.”
