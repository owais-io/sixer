  Many fruit trees are pruned in winter when they are dormant, in anticipation
  of the burst of energy that comes with spring. Yet established stone-fruit
  trees – plums, cherries, apricots and others in the Prunus family – should be
  pruned now to prevent them contracting silver leaf disease. Transmitted by
  spores active in the autumn and winter, and which infect trees through open
  wounds, this fungal disease can cause leaves to turn silver and lead to whole
  branches dying back. Pruning in summer is also prudent given that bacterial
  canker can find its way into a susceptible tree during the colder months of
  the year. Any wounds caused by pruning now will have plenty of time to heal
  before the seasons change. The aim when pruning a plum tree is to manage its
  size, shape and health, so start your cuts following the three Ds principle.
  Any branches that are dead, damaged or diseased should be the first to go.
  Once those are cleared, look for any that cross one another, and carefully
  prune those as crossing branches can rub, causing abrasions that can let
  disease in. The next goal of pruning plum trees is to take the growth back by
  approximately a third, while creating or maintaining an open, goblet shape,
  which is ideal for air flow and vigour. You can do this by shortening
  branches, removing vertical ones (“watershoots”) and addressing congestion,
  especially at the centre of the tree. You can also remove any suckers that
  have appeared at the base. Make confident cuts using clean, sterilised
  equipment, whether that’s secateurs for small chops or loppers and pruning
  saws for more substantial cuts. Determine where to cut by finding an
  outward-facing bud that’s pointing in the direction that you want new growth
  to appear from, then make a sloped cut above it. While you’re doing this, step
  back regularly to look at the tree as a whole. It’s very easy to get fixated
  on sorting one section before realising that it’s all become lopsided. Cuts
  made now will determine the future shape of the tree, so it’s worth doing this
  job when you have time to be discerning. The point of judicious pruning isn’t
  merely to have more fruit – although that is a huge bonus – but also to ensure
  the health and vitality of trees so that they have long, fruitful lives. And
  if you inherit an old, neglected plum tree, you can use this approach to
  rehabilitate it. If it is done patiently and steadily over a few years (as
  aggressive pruning can be detrimental), it is possible to restore an abandoned
  tree to its former fruit-bearing glory.
