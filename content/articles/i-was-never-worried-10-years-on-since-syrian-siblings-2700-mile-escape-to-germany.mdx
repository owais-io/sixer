  Germany

  The trip would be tough, Somar Kreker knew, but he was not overly fearful. It
  was the summer of 2015, and in a small flat in Amman, Jordan, this young
  Syrian’s only thought was how to turn a long and arduous journey into
  something more bearable. The engineering student had fled Syria three and a
  half years earlier after refusing to enlist in the brutal regime’s army. He
  was now ready to begin a new chapter of his life, starting with a new task: to
  reunite with his younger sisters, still trapped in Damascus, and lead them to
  Germany, where their brother was living. “I was never worried or stressed
  about the trip,” says Somar, just 27 years old at the time. “I never had any
  thought about danger or failure. My only thoughts were how I could make the
  trip a happy adventure for me and my sisters. “For some reason,” he adds, “I
  was sure that I would arrive safely in Germany.’’ In 2015, nearly 1 million
  asylum seekers attempted to reach Europe – it was a year officials and aid
  workers would later describe as the peak of the migration crisis, that would
  put to the test the core values of the EU – itself born from the ashes of a
  war that displaced millions. At a press conference at refugee camp in Dresden
  on 31 August, the then German chancellor Angela Merkel said “Wir schaffen das”
  (“We can do this”) as the country opened its borders to those in need. Today,
  Somar and his sisters’ journey would be immeasurably more difficult. Ten years
  have passed since then. A decade in which migration has reshaped political
  landscapes across the continent and paved the way for the rise of far-right
  parties. The year before, in 2014, Somar’s brother, Mousab, had managed to get
  from Libya to Sicily with his pregnant wife by boat. But for him, repeating
  that journey with his sisters was not an option: it was too dangerous. A few
  months earlier, on 18 April 2015, a fishing boat designed to carry no more
  than 30 passengers, crammed with more than 1,000 asylum seekers, collided with
  a Portuguese freighter that had approached to offer help. The vessel sank in
  the dark waters off the Sicilian coast. Most of the bodies would remain
  trapped inside the hull, wedged about 400 metres deep on the seabed. More than
  800 people would lose their lives in what became the deadliest shipwreck in
  the history of the European migration crisis. There was only one alternative.
  Perhaps less deadly, but longer and more exhausting: the Balkan route, which,
  after travelling from Turkey to Greece in a rubber dinghy, cuts across at
  least four countries, through mountains and – in the colder months –
  snow-covered forests. “The plan was to meet my sisters, Salsabil, 21, and
  Lubna, 14, in Istanbul. They were arriving on a flight from Damascus. I
  reached Turkey on a flight from Amman,” says Somar. After a cross-country bus
  ride, they reached Kaş, a coastal town on Turkey’s Mediterranean shore, where
  smugglers would ferry them across to the Greek island of Kastellorizo – for
  about €1,000 each. “We established my sisters would leave before me,” says
  Somar. “That was the most dramatic moment of my journey. Thinking that they
  had to cross alone – from Turkey to Greece – on a dinghy, drove me crazy with
  anxiety.” A few days before, on 13 September, at least 34 people, including 15
  babies and children, drowned when their overcrowded boat capsized in high
  winds off the Aegean island of Farmakonisi. According to data from the UNHCR,
  the UN’s refugee agency, and International Organization for Migration (IOM),
  approximately 731 people died in the Aegean Sea attempting to reach Greece in
  rubber dinghies in 2015. Fortunately, the sea was calm that day and his
  sisters arrived safely in Kastellorizo – followed a few days later by Somar.
  Kastellorizo had experienced a influx of migrants, who now significantly
  outnumbered the residents. “It was a wonderful island, with crystal‑clear
  water,” says Alessio Mamo, a Guardian photographer who had met Somar in Turkey
  and decided to document his journey. “The contrast between the stream of
  tourists and the thousands of migrants was stark. To shake off the fear after
  the dinghy crossing, we played football. Syria versus the rest of the world.
  Instead of shirts, the opposing team wore lifejackets.” The group set off
  again taking the ferry to Athens. From there, after a couple of days, Somar,
  his sisters and Alessio joined thousands of other migrants and made their way
  to the North Macedonian border, arriving at an open‑air camp run by the UNHCR.
  “The borders were open in that period, unlike today. It was not hard to reach
  the Balkans,” says Somar. On 15 October, they took a train to Serbia – a
  country where the mood was growing increasingly tense. In the weeks leading up
  to their arrival, more than 13,000 migrants had crossed from Serbia into
  Croatia in just a few days, raising alarm among European governments. In
  Zagreb, officials feared they were facing the last line of defence against a
  purported “invasion” of asylum seekers – a narrative rapidly seized upon by
  far‑right parties across Europe. Alessio was stopped by Serbian police. His
  passport showed no record of entry into the country. He was separated from the
  group and taken to a police station where he was questioned. He was then
  allowed to resume his journey and reached Croatia by bus. On their way to
  Europe, migrants lived in makeshift camps, out in the open or in cardboard
  shelters. Those who could not afford bus or train fares walked on foot,
  trekking through dense forests and mountains along barely passable trails.
  They slept whenever and wherever they could. On 17 September, Croatia closed
  seven of its eight border crossings with Serbia in an effort to limit the
  influx of refugees. A month later, Slovenia followed suit – a clear sign that
  Europe, struggling to manage unprecedented migration flows, was closing its
  doors. A month later, Somar, his sisters and Alessio arrived in Salzburg,
  Austria. A couple of days later – after 44 days and more than 2,755 miles
  (4,434km) – they reached Germany, their journey culminating in a long,
  emotional embrace with Mousab. The family fleeing the Syrian regime was
  finally reunited, far from war and fear. Somar now lives in Bochum where he
  got married last year and he works as a project manager for a firm in the food
  industry. “We found help and support in Germany,” says Somar, “and I have
  never felt discriminated against.” That year, Merkel was harshly criticised by
  many other EU leaders for her response the crisis, which she called a
  “historic test” that could not be solved by shutting out refugees. Her
  open-door policy welcomed hundreds of thousands of refugees into Germany.
  Judith Sunderland, associate director for Human Rights Watch’s Europe and
  Central Asia division, said: “2015 was a year of tremendous contradictions
  that held the possibility – and at times what seemed the promise – of a
  generous, welcoming and fair Europe. “Ultimately, those contradictions were
  resolved with an embrace of cruel and repressive migration and asylum
  policies. “In the years since, the EU has turned progressively toward Fortress
  Europe,” Sunderland adds. In the aftermath of 2015, the Balkan route became
  much harder, with barbed-wire fences and armed pushbacks by border police. In
  the central Mediterranean, Italy’s humanitarian approach gave way. Operation
  Mare Nostrum, led by the Italian navy, and which had focused on rescuing
  migrant vessels in distress, was superseded by Operation Triton, which was
  intended to patrol the Mediterranean more than save lives. European
  prosecutors used laws designed to tackle organised crime to pursue people
  smugglers – not to stop the abuse of refugees on such routes, however, but to
  curb migration flows. When NGOs stepped in to fill the gap, launching rescue
  operations in Libyan waters, Italian authorities impounded ships and arrested
  volunteer crews. Italy began closing its ports to incoming migrant vessels
  from Libya. In 2017, the then‑interior minister Marco Minniti, of the
  centre‑left Democratic party, struck a deal with the Libyan coastguard to
  intercept and return migrants to Libya – where aid agencies have reported
  widespread torture and abuse. The migration crisis became a decisive issue in
  the European elections of June 2024, helping far‑right parties that demanded
  closed borders and mass returns to power – and many of them won. Last year,
  Italy’s far‑right prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, opened two centres in
  Albania designed to hold men who were intercepted in international waters
  while trying to cross from Africa to Europe. Greece secretly expelled
  thousands of asylum seekers, abandoning many of them on inflatable life rafts
  in the Aegean Sea, while the Hungarian government ordered the closure of its
  border with Serbia and the construction of a fence along the frontier. The
  result has been a catastrophic rise in the number of deaths. Monica Minardi,
  president of Médecins Sans Frontières Italy, said: “More than 32,000 people
  have lost their lives in the attempt to cross the Mediterranean Sea since
  2014, while migrants and asylum seekers are left with no alternative than risk
  their life to seek safety and protection. “From Spain to Croatia to Greece, we
  have seen brutal and sometimes deadly violence used to prevent people from
  entering,” Sunderland says. “For all the terrible policies and practices we
  saw in 2015 (and before), it was still a time when Merkel said: ‘We can do
  this.’ Now the German government is pushing people back at the border and
  trying to abolish family reunification.” A decade has passed since Somar’s
  journey. Today, the future for migrants – and of Europe itself – remains
  uncertain, as intolerance grows across the continent. In Germany, where Somar
  lives, the far-right and anti-migration Alternative für Deutschland (AfD)
  party came second in February’s federal elections, with more than 20% of the
  vote. Meanwhile, fortified with barbed wire and systematic pushbacks, Europe
  continues to close itself off. Additional reporting by Marta Bellingreri
