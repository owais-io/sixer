  Can we finally stop pretending that what we have been witnessing in Gaza over
  the past 22 months is a “war,” a “conflict,” or even a “humanitarian crisis”?
  Many of the world’s leading human rights and humanitarian groups – including
  Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Doctors Without Borders – agreed
  months ago that what is being livestreamed to our phones on a daily basis is
  indeed a genocide. This week, Israel’s own leading human rights group
  announced that it had reached “the unequivocal conclusion that Israel is
  taking coordinated action to intentionally destroy Palestinian society in the
  Gaza Strip”. In other words, said B’Tselem, “Israel is committing genocide
  against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip”. The debate over whether or not Gaza
  is a genocide is, effectively, over. So can we now also stop pretending that
  we are mere bystanders to this genocide? That our sin is one only of omission
  rather than commission? Because the inconvenient truth is that the US has not
  just looked the other way, as tens of thousands of Palestinians have been
  besieged and bombed, starved and slaughtered, but helped Israel pull the
  trigger. We have been complicit in this genocide, which is itself a crime
  under article III of the Genocide convention. As retired Israeli Maj Gen
  Yitzhak Brick acknowledged in November 2023: “All of our missiles, the
  ammunition, the precision-guided bombs, all the airplanes and bombs, it’s all
  from the US. The minute they turn off the tap, you can’t keep fighting. You
  have no capability … Everyone understands that we can’t fight this war without
  the United States. Period.” In fact, given Brick’s assessment, I would argue
  that what we have witnessed in Gaza from the US government is worse than
  complicity. It is active participation in an ongoing genocide. Donald Trump
  has given Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, and his far-right
  government not only the green light to “clean out” Gaza and “finish the job”,
  but also the arms, intel and funds to do so. When Netanyahu launched his
  blockade of all food and aid going into Gaza in March, he emphasized it was
  done “in full coordination with President Trump and his people”. “Over the
  past six months,” Axios reported in late July, “Trump has given Netanyahu an
  almost free hand to do whatever he wants in Gaza.” An Israeli official told
  the site: “In most calls and meetings Trump told Bibi: ‘Do what you have to do
  in Gaza.’” Trump’s Republican allies in the House and Senate are even more
  gung-ho. Forget complicity; Congress is filled with GOP cheerleaders for
  genocide, from Senators Tom “bounce the rubble in Gaza” Cotton to Lindsey
  “level the place” Graham. The newest member of the House, Randy Fine, a
  Republican representative of Florida, has called for the nuking of Gaza and
  said just days ago that Palestinians in Gaza should “starve away” until the
  Israeli hostages are all released. (A reminder that incitement to genocide is
  also a crime under Article III of the Genocide convention.) But we cannot let
  Democrats off the hook either. The first 16 months of this mass slaughter
  unfolded on a Democratic president’s watch. From the get-go, Joe Biden gave
  Netanyahu and his cabinet of génocidaires everything they needed – 2,000-lb
  bombs to drop on refugee camps filled with Palestinian children? Check. UN
  security council vetoes to prevent the passage of resolutions calling for a
  permanent ceasefire? Check. The burial of internal US government reports
  warning of war crimes and famine in Gaza? Check. It wasn’t just Biden. The
  vast majority of Democrats in Congress spent much of 2024 casting vote after
  vote to keep arming, funding and whitewashing the mass killing of Palestinian
  civilians. Even now, in the summer of 2025, seven high-profile Democratic
  senators were happy to take a smiling photo with Netanyahu, including the
  Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, who claims talk of genocide is
  antisemitic and says his job “is to keep the left pro-Israel”. Then there is
  the US media’s complicity in this genocide. It isn’t just the Radio Rwanda
  wannabes over at Fox, where the morning host Brian Kilmeade has said it was
  hard “to separate the Palestinians from Hamas” and the primetime host Jesse
  Watters has said “no one wants” Palestinian refugees and “demographically
  [Palestinians] are a threat”. There are also genocide enablers in the liberal
  media. Those who repeatedly insist Israelis have a right to defend themselves
  while never asking whether Palestinians do. Those who parrot Israeli
  government talking points while sanitizing the violence inflicted on Gaza.
  Palestinians, remember, are not killed by Israeli bombs or bullets; they just
  “die.” US newsrooms have bent over backwards to present “both sides,” even
  when one side has been deemed genocidal by some of the world’s leading
  scholars on genocide. The New York Times, per an internal memo obtained by the
  Intercept, instructed journalists covering Gaza to limit the use of the terms
  “genocide” and “ethnic cleansing” and to “avoid” using the phrase “occupied
  territory” when referring to the West Bank and Gaza. One study of media
  coverage, also published by the Intercept, found that “highly emotive terms
  for the killing of civilians like ‘slaughter’, ‘massacre’, and ‘horrific’ were
  reserved almost exclusively for Israelis who were killed by Palestinians,
  rather than the other way around”. Another study, published in the Nation,
  found that “with one exception the Sunday shows covered and debated [Gaza] for
  12 months without speaking to a single Palestinian or Palestinian American”.
  Go beyond the media. Elite US institutions are also disgracefully complicit in
  the annihilation of Gaza, from the Ivy League universities that punished
  anti-genocide protesters on campus; to the white-shoe law firms that
  disqualified anti-genocide applicants for jobs; to the big tech companies
  accused by a UN special rapporteur of profiting from the genocide. Most
  Americans, of course, don’t want to believe that our country is helping commit
  one of the 21st century’s worst atrocities. But, again, we must stop
  pretending. Our complicity and collusion are clear. As my Zeteo colleague
  Spencer Ackerman has written: “This is an American genocide as much as it is
  an Israeli one.” The US supplied and then resupplied the bombs and bullets
  used to kill tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians; the US facilitated
  the destruction of homes and hospitals; the US signed off on the starvation of
  children. These are the undeniable facts. And so to the Biden and Trump
  administrations, to Democrats and Republicans in Congress, to the US media, I
  say this: history will judge you. For the bombs you sent, the votes you cast,
  the lies you told. This will be your shameful legacy when the dust finally
  settles in Gaza, when all of the bodies have been pulled from the rubble. Not
  defending your ally or fighting terrorism, but non-stop complicity in a
  genocide; aiding and abetting the crime of crimes. Mehdi Hasan is the founder,
