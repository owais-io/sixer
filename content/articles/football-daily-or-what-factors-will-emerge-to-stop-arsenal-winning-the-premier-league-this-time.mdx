  AND NOW YOU’RE GUNNER BELIEVE US? The last time Arsenal notched up three
  consecutive second-place finishes in the top flight, they went on to win the
  league fairly comfortably the following season, beating Liverpool by seven
  points. With Mikel Arteta now in Phase 19 of the five-phase plan he embarked
  on to establish his side as champions, trophy-hungry fans of the club will be
  hoping he can emulate his predecessor, Arsène Wenger, by masterminding a
  successful title tilt after back-to-back-to-back finishes as runners-up.
  During his time at Arsenal, Arteta has left virtually no stone unturned in his
  attempts to maximise the potential of his squad, using opposing team’s
  anthems, a team of pickpockets, a longwinded metaphor involving lightbulbs, a
  training ground labrador, a bowl of lemons and an olive tree in his as yet
  unsuccessful efforts to get them over the line and on to the Premier League
  winners’ podium in May. Of course with each passing failure there’s always
  “next season” and for impatient Arsenal fans whose team has now won the square
  root of nish-all in five years, they are currently living in those heady days
  of optimism where the assorted calamities visited upon them last season have
  been boxed off and temporarily forgotten, while those of next season have yet
  to make themselves known. While it is widely accepted that Arsenal’s inability
  to win the title in 2024-25 was down to a combination of factors including
  knack, a refereeing conspiracy and the minor detail that Liverpool were much
  better than them, Arsenal’s apparently shrewd and early dealings in the
  transfer market mean that among their fans there is a feeling – much like
  there always is – that their time has finally come. In bringing in six new
  players, only one of whom prompted several thousand weirdos among the club’s
  fanbase to sign an actual petition voicing their disquiet at his arrival on
  the grounds he isn’t good enough, Arteta appears to have signed shrewdly,
  early and well. Meanwhile in terms of homegrown talent, the emergence of the
  young Max Dowman as a genuinely exciting game-changer is a cause for real
  excitement, not least because Football Daily has several T-shirts and a pair
  of jeans in our wardrobe that are older than the latest prodigy to roll off
  the Emirates assembly line. “Let’s see how it goes,” said Arteta, when asked
  if the 15-year-old would be getting minutes in the Premier League this season
  after another impressive pre-season showing in defeat against Villarreal.
  “Let’s go into Saturday, into the break as well. He needs a little break as
  well because he hasn’t had any holidays, really.” Next up for Arsenal is
  another friendly against Athletic Bilbao this weekend, before they get their
  latest effort to win the Premier League up and running with a set of six
  opening games against Manchester United (a), Leeds (h), Liverpool (a),
  Nottingham Forest (h), Manchester City (h) and Newcastle (a) that suggests the
  latest plot to foil them has been hatched by none other than the fixture
  generator. QUOTE OF THE DAY It’s a dream come true. LA - what a city. If I’m
  honest, it was not my first choice … but [LAFC co-chief suit] John
  [Thorrington] changed my mind, changed my heart, my brain” – Son Heung-min on
  the powers of persuasion that led made him decide that a move to the USA USA
  USA was what he wanted after all. After being asked if he could win the World
  Cup for the USA USA USA, he might be having doubts again. FOOTBALL DAILY
  LETTERS An owner, a scout, an agent and a player go into an (unredacted) bar
  (yesterday’s Still Want More? – full email edition). The scout says ‘Mine’s a
  pint’. The agent says ‘Mine’s a pint’. The owner says ‘I’m buying, what’s
  yours Harry?’ The player says ‘My name’s not Harry’” – Max Maxwell. Come on,
  that’s never Cristiano Ronaldo (yesterday’s Memory Lane – full email edition).

  whacked a Portugal kit on to a surplus to requirements Jacob from Twilight

  letter o’ the Day” – Steve Mintz. His interest in nominative determinism made
  me wonder what Harry Piano (yesterday’s letters) does for a living. After
  asking generative AI for an illustration of Hairy Piano at work, I’ve decided
  I would actually rather not know” – Dan Davis. Just a short, tear-stained note
  about Son Heung-min’s career in England. He went to Germany very young and
  without a word of German. England, very young, without a word of English and
  in a high pressure world in which Asian footballers, few in number, were
  largely disregarded, looked down on as being not tough enough, big enough or
  even man enough. Perhaps great stamina and running might be mentioned, the
  ‘praise’ given to Park Ji-sung who deserved much more appreciation. To play at
  world class level for half a dozen of his years at Spurs, to lead them at last
  to a European trophy, to win a Golden Boot with some wondrous goals (with no
  penalty-taking because of Kane), to win the Puskas prize with that astonishing
  run and finish at Burnley, to be Asian footballer of the year so often,
  captain of his national team and to transform the whole profile of the sport
  in his home country and perhaps beyond, that is an extraordinary achievement …
