  Here is a solid first feature debut from director Harry Sherriff, an
  atmospheric crime drama set in a gloomy, decaying seaside town, with an eerie
  depiction of grief experienced by those who exist within the margins of the
  life of a murdered girl. The film follows Leonard (Samuel Blenkin), a meek
  hotel concierge who has a boyish crush on his charming 25-year-old colleague
  Elle (Emily Carey). Dressed in a red raincoat with short dark hair and a wry
  smile, Elle’s character is very much reminiscent of Jordana Bevan in Richard
  Ayoade’s 2010 film Submarine, as is the dry sardonic humour peppered into the
  script. Leonard and Elle’s exchanges are awkward yet sweet, teetering on the
  edge of a true connection. That is, until Elle doesn’t show up to work one day
  and reports of a missing person trickle through the town. The hotel staff are
  rattled by Elle’s disappearance and when news breaks that her body has been
  found, this chilling bereavement subtly upends their lives. Misper (an
  abbreviated term used by the police to refer to a missing person) is
  stylistically compelling in its atmosphere building. There is an unsettling
  sense of staleness that runs throughout the film, characterised by the beige,
  stained walls of the old-timey, mostly vacant hotel, and Leonard’s expression,
  which is permanently set in a sunken, shell-shocked gaze. “I feel like I’m in
  a horror film,” he says, as he attempts to schedule an appointment with a
  therapist over the phone. This empty hotel is a prime site for horror and
  although Misper dabbles in the genre with some nightmarish flashes of Elle
  haunting Leonard after her death, it doesn’t go all the way. Nor does it
  follow the pathway of a crime drama, refusing to offer up the salacious
  details of Elle’s death in the true crime manner (though there a brief yet
  frightening visit by a “fan” of the dead girl). The nature of Elle’s murder
  and the profile of her killer are pushed into the periphery. What is at the
  forefront is the bafflement, melancholy and looming sense of dread that the
  hotel staff are faced with as they attempt to grapple with a return to
  normality. The bleak misery remains but drifts into the eeriness of the
  uncanny. • Misper screened at the Edinburgh film festival
