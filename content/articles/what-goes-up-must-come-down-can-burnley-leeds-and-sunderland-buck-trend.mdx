  Burnley Reasons to be cheerful There are numerous reasons behind the growing
  trend of promoted teams going straight back down with a decreasing number of
  points. One – having to adjust from dominating possession in the Championship
  to seeing much less of the ball in the Premier League – may not trouble
  Burnley quite as much as their predecessors. Scott Parker built the third
  promotion of his managerial career last season on the back of an outstanding
  defensive record along with a selfless, fierce team spirit. More pragmatic
  than Vincent Kompany, the previous manager to take Burnley up in convincing
  style, Parker is not as wedded to a style that can be found out at Premier
  League level without serious investment. Burnley will be resilient, they have
  added experience in Kyle Walker and Martin Dubravka and they know what is in
  store. In Armando Broja, the club have acquired a talented striker determined
  to make up for time lost to injury. Reasons to be fearful Burnley spent about
  £100m after winning promotion under Kompany in 2023 and still went down with a
  measly 24 points. The gap grows bigger each year, with promoted clubs at a
  disadvantage from the off owing to the Premier League’s profitability and
  sustainability rules. In James Trafford and CJ Egan-Riley, they have lost two
  key members of the defensive unit responsible for keeping 30 clean sheets last
  season and conceding 16 goals in 46 games – the best defensive record in
  English league history. Josh Brownhill, the captain and leading goalscorer
  last term, has followed Egan-Riley in rejecting a new contract and leaving on
  a free transfer. Replacing the midfielder’s leadership and goals will not be
  easy. Broja’s injury record has been a concern for several seasons and several
  other new recruits are unproven or untested at Premier League level. AH Leeds
  Reasons to be cheerful They are no longer diminutive and a little lightweight;
  indeed at first glance neutrals may wonder whether they have got the class of
  2025-26 confused with another club’s squad. In a physical sense at least,
  Leeds have morphed into a side of quite formidable stature with their eight
  summer signings averaging 6ft 2in. Leeds fans will not care too much about
  aesthetics if their team are able to muscle their way to survival; not to
  mention demonstrate much-needed improvement at set pieces. Among the arrivals
  is the 6ft 5in Brazil goalkeeper Lucas Perri, brought in from Lyon to replace
  the gifted, but erratic, Illan Meslier. Perhaps equally important, last
  season’s Championship Golden Boot winner, Joël Piroe, has impressed in
  pre-season. Maybe, just maybe, the Dutch striker will shine in the Premier
  League. Behind Piroe, a central midfield featuring Anton Stach, Sean
  Longstaff, Ethan Ampadu and Ao Tanaka competing for places looks a
  reassuringly strong department in a division where Brentford, Wolves, Crystal
  Palace and West Ham look eminently capable of sliding into trouble. Reasons to
  be fearful There were genuine mitigating factors, but Farke suffered immediate
  relegations after twice winning promotion with Norwich. Then there are the
  attacking gambles. Are Leeds really wise to place so much faith in the
  injury-prone former Everton and England centre-forward Dominic Calvert-Lewin
  and the similarly fragile former Wolfsburg and Germany striker Lukas Nmecha?
  Not that the players have a monopoly on creaky, crumbling, joints. There are
  fears plans for the much-needed reconstruction and expansion of Elland Road
  may distract resources from the first team. Moreover, Leeds could well miss
  their former chief executive Angus Kinnear after his move to Everton. Kinnear
  was a very big Farke ally. Farke could also do with Manor Solomon still being
  on his side because the Israel international’s excellent wing play on loan was
  a big reason why Leeds won promotion. Solomon looks poised to leave Tottenham
  but, with the 26-year-old attracting interest from Premier League rivals and
  La Liga, enticing him back may be a losing battle. LT Sunderland Reasons to be
  cheerful They hold Enzo Le Fée’s registration. It is surely no coincidence the
  former Roma playmaker helped create all five goals Sunderland scored as they
  overcame first Coventry then Sheffield United to win promotion via the
  playoffs. His eye for a through ball promises to serve them well. Sunderland
  are also dangerous and highly unpredictable down both wings, where Simon
  Adingra, a recent arrival from Brighton, promises to be a
  defender-destabilising opponent. Régis Le Bris is an excellent improver of
  young players and is no slave to philosophy. Expect Sunderland to alternate
  between counterattacking – arguably their strong suit – and a more considered
  passing approach. Regardless of tactics, a central midfield that has, among
  others, Habib Diarra, Granit Xhaka, Le Fée, Dan Neil and Chris Rigg competing
  for places is not to be underestimated. Last season’s star midfielder, Jobe
  Bellingham, now at Borussia Dortmund, may not be missed too much. Further
  forward, Marc Guiu, the 19-year-old Chelsea loanee striker and former
  Barcelona academy graduate, is regarded as being potentially very good. Some
  say a forward who combines imposing physicality with fine finishing really is
  the new Cole Palmer. Reasons to be fearful Chaos overload threatens tactical
  and emotional anarchy. Le Bris would not be human if he did not struggle to
  integrate 11 signings while maintaining squad harmony and constructing a
  cohesive XI. Xhaka apart, the imports are generally young, inexperienced and
  light on Premier League experience. Le Bris is also something of a novice at
  this level. He has never managed in England’s top tier and, at 49, the former
  Lorient manager is starting only his fourth season as a first-team head coach.
  When filled to 49,000 capacity, the Stadium of Light remains one of England’s
  most intimidating arenas. Unfortunately, not all players can handle the
  pressure that comes with wearing red and white stripes and performing in front
  of some of the country’s most partisan fans. Deep down, even the most
  optimistic supporters know that while Sunderland played very well at times
  last season they were rarely able to control games and had an awful habit of
  conceding late goals and squandering leads. LT
