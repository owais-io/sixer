  The online fashion seller Debenhams, formerly known as Boohoo, is considering
  the sale of its Pretty Little Thing (PLT) brand and the closure of its
  distribution centre in Burnley, which could lead to the loss of 1,251 jobs.
  The company said it was “exploring a range of long-term options”, understood
  to include closure for the Burnley site and the sale of an already closed
  warehouse in the US amid falling sales and widening losses. The potential sale
  of Pretty Little Thing comes five years after Boohoo bought out a minority
  stake for more than £260m from Umar Kamani, the son of Boohoo’s executive
  chair and co-founder Mahmud Kamani, and business partner Paul Papworth. In
  delayed annual results, Debenhams said pretax losses had widened to £264m in
  the year to 28 February, from £164m a year earlier. One-off costs, including a
  writedown on its US warehouse and restructuring costs, amounted to £199m.
  Sales fell by 10% to £2.3bn, with the group’s “youth brands” – Boohoo, PLT and
  BoohooMan – taking the biggest hit, with sales down by more than a fifth to
  £1.5bn. The main Boohoo brand has faced difficulties amid the rise of cheap
  online alternatives such as the Chinese-founded Shein and the secondhand
  specialist Vinted as well as pressure on the disposable income of its young
  shoppers. The group’s Debenhams arm, which includes an online marketplace and
  the Warehouse, Oasis and Dorothy Perkins brands, increased sales by just over
  a third to £654m but sales at the fashion brand Karen Millen slid 3%. Dan
  Finley, the chief executive, said Debenhams’ board had “recognised the need
  for change following a long period of sustained and unacceptable
  underperformance” and was cutting costs and reducing stocks. “The business has
  been through a very challenging period which is reflected in these results,”
  he added. “I want to assure shareholders that the business is taking the
  necessary actions, quickly and decisively, to address the challenges that we
  face. No stone will be left unturned.” The potential job losses at Debenhams
  come as Poundland confirmed plans to close up to 150 stores and two
  distribution centres, putting more than 2,000 jobs at risk. The cut-price
  retailer won approval from creditors and the high court on Tuesday for the
  rescue plan, which involves the closure of 68 stores this month, some of which
  have already shut their doors, and rent cuts on dozens more. In time, it wants
  to close up to 150 outlets. The company, which was sold in June for £1 to the
  US investment group Gordon Brothers, has more than 800 outlets in the UK and
  the Republic of Ireland, employing about 16,000 people. It is also stopping
  selling online, ditching its Perks loyalty app and ceasing to sell frozen
  foods. That will lead to the closure later this year of Poundland’s frozen and
  digital distribution centre at Darton, South Yorkshire, and its national
  distribution centre at Springvale in Bilston, West Midlands, in early 2026.
  Two other distribution centres, in Wigan and Harlow, will continue to operate.
  It wants landlords to cut rents to zero on up to 180 stores – putting the
  future of those outlets in doubt – while seeking rent reductions of between
  15% and 75% on dozens more stores as part of a restructuring process that it
  will put to creditors in August. Barry Williams, Poundland’s managing
  director, said: “Today’s decision is vitally important for Poundland, allowing
  us to stabilise the business, securing the future of hundreds of stores and
  thousands of jobs. “Despite the opportunity this ruling provides, I’m
  extremely mindful of its consequences for our colleagues, especially those
  leaving us as we streamline our store estate, distribution network and support
  teams.” He said the business was now focused on “getting us back on track –
  revamping ranges, lowering prices and creating the simpler and more focused
  Poundland we know our customers are eager for us to deliver”. Williams said
  Poundland was reducing its chilled food ranges to essentials such as milk and
  butter but expanding its clothing, especially for women, and bringing back
  seasonal favourites.
