  The ABC should be fined up to $350,000 for sacking the presenter Antoinette
  Lattouf because of “significant pressure” put on senior management by Ita
  Buttrose, the broadcaster’s former chair, the federal court has heard. The
  ABC, which admits it acted unlawfully, has submitted the total penalty imposed
  should be between $37,560 and $56,340. In June the court found the ABC
  contravened section 772 of the Fair Work Act by terminating Lattouf for
  reasons of political opinion and breached five clauses of the ABC’s enterprise
  agreement by removing her from air three days into a five-day contract. The
  court ordered that the ABC pay Lattouf compensation of $70,000. Sign up to get

  Justice Darryl Rangiah heard submissions from Lattouf and the ABC on what the
  scale of a separate penalty should be for the breaches of employment law. The
  court heard Buttrose sent six emails in rapid succession detailing complaints
  about Lattouf to the broadcaster’s content chief, Chris Oliver-Taylor, in the
  hours leading up to her sacking. One of Lattouf’s barristers, Philip Boncardo,
  asked the court to find the breach of the law was not a “mistake” by
  Oliver-Taylor, as has been claimed by the ABC. “We would also contend that
  your honour would take into account the involvement of Ms Buttrose as someone
  who placed significant pressure on Oliver-Taylor in the contravening,”
  Boncardo said. “How Mr Oliver-Taylor could have been mistaken about whether or
  not it was lawful to sack someone because of their opinion escapes us.” The
  ABC submitted the breach was “one-off” and not a “deliberate recalcitrance”
  and a reduced penalty was in order. Oliver-Taylor left the broadcaster in
  January after his role was substantially downgraded by the ABC chair, Kim
  Williams. The broadcaster asked the court to take into consideration the
  finding by Rangiah that Lattouf’s conduct in making the Human Rights Watch
  post was “ill advised and inconsiderate of her employer”. Lattouf was removed
  from the ABC Mornings program after she shared an Instagram post from Human
  Rights Watch that said Israel had used starvation as a “weapon of war” in
  Gaza. The ABC submitted Oliver-Taylor was acting to protect the broadcaster’s
  reputation and to maintain the ABC’s “impartiality and appearance of
  impartiality in the context of Ms Lattouf’s posts about the Israel/Gaza war”.
  The ABC says Oliver-Taylor acted in haste to “beat a story” that was about to
  be published by the Australian, and did not consult the ABC’s human resources
  department or its legal team. Lattouf’s submission is that the ABC has not
  exhibited sufficient contrition and has not taken significant corrective
  action. The ABC’s barristers, Ian Neil, SC, and Vanja Bulut, told the court
  their client has taken extensive steps to ensure that the contravening conduct
  does not recur and the senior leadership team has been trained to follow legal
  obligations. Neil said the circumstances in which Oliver-Taylor, the “single
  decision maker”, was operating were “unique and extraordinary, a perfect
  storm” and were unlikely to happen again. “All came together at one very
  specific, short period of time and produced a circumstance where the single
  decision maker was operating under what we have characterised as human
  emotions – pressure, stress, confusion, panic,” Neil said. Under
  cross-examination, the ABC’s chief people officer Deena Amorelli agreed no one
  from the ABC had contacted Lattouf to apologise personally despite
  acknowledging the “distress occasioned her” in a statement published after the
  judgment was handed down. Lattouf submitted the ABC exhibited a “callous
  indifference” to her welfare and has failed to explain who leaked news of her
  termination to The Australian. “The ABC’s contravening conduct and actions in
  the immediate aftermath of Ms Lattouf’s termination evidence a disturbing
  culture where the prejudices of lobby groups prevail over the welfare of
  employees and compliance with the ABC’s legal obligations,” the submission
  released by the court said. “The ABC’s objectively grave contravening calls
  for substantial deterrent penalties.” Rangiah has reserved his decision.
