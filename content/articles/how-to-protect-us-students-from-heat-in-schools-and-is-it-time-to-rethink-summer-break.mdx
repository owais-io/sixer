  As schools are returning to session following one of the hottest summers ever
  recorded, districts are faced with a new problem: how to handle increasingly
  extreme heatwaves, both in and outside the classroom. Unbearably hot days are
  no longer just a summer problem. In the US districts from the north-east to
  the mountain west to the deep south are shortening days, delaying openings,
  and reworking calendars as temperatures spike during August and September, the
  typical back-to-school months. A handful of potential methods for protecting
  students from extreme temperatures have been put forward, including
  modernizing HVAC systems, creating more shade on playgrounds, swapping their
  blacktop surfaces for grass and, perhaps most provocatively, reworking school
  calendars. There’s even some talk of replacing summer vacation with a spring
  or fall break, if schools can be kept cool enough, when homes for some
  students may be hotter. School schedules are already beginning to shift. New
  York City recently urged schools to move end-of-year activities indoors during
  a June 2025 heatwave. Philadelphia dismissed students early at more than 60
  campuses during late August 2024 because buildings lacked adequate cooling.
  Detroit also cut days short in the first week of the 2024–25 school year as
  heat indices climbed. In Colorado’s Poudre school district, most schools
  announced two-hour early releases for 14 and 15 August due to high
  temperatures. In June, the notoriously cold state of Alaska had their first
  statewide heat advisory. As the climate crisis is already shaping the way we
  discuss the future of education in the US, rearranging the calendar has become
  one tactic for school districts to tackle the issue. “It’s definitely one
  technique that you could take to address the extreme temperature events, and
  especially since we’re already seeing school get postponed and the days
  canceled or moved around,” said Grace Wickerson, the senior manager of the
  climate and health team at the Federation of American Scientists. “But even
  with some of the major legislation of the last administration, the climate
  risk to schools is still a major gap in our strategy around climate action,”
  said Wickerson. “And so I think this definitely needs to be a part of the
  conversation of what things we need to do differently in the age of extreme
  heat.” Last summer, 22 organizations, including the Federation of American
  Scientists, sent a letter to the US Department of Education urging them to
  take swift action to protect students from the increasingly hot weather. The
  Center for Green Schools at the US Green Building Council is another name on
  the letter. The center is a non-profit known for the Leadership in Energy and
  Environmental Design (Leed) rating system, a framework for designing
  climate-ready buildings that has so far been adopted by more than 5,000 US
  schools. Though Leed has become a popular strategy for schools to prepare
  against hotter temperatures, the policy aspect can be difficult to navigate
  due to a lack of governmental guidelines. “The main issue is we have very
  little data about school buildings across the country because they’re all
  managed locally,” said Anisa Heming, the director of the Center for Green
  Schools. “There’s no data collection on the federal level, and in most states
  actually there’s no data collection, so we have very little data on the
  buildings themselves. “And then there’s no real threshold established for when
  a school has actually done a good job on being heat-resilient,” she added. “So
  we have a bunch of strategies that schools can adopt, but we don’t have a real
  sense of if we’ve done enough because there’s no standard to follow.” Most
  American schools were built for a cooler climate that no longer exists. A
  Government Accountability Office survey from 2020 estimated that 41% of
  districts needed to update or replace HVAC systems in at least half of their
  schools, about 36,000 buildings. Despite a need and emphasis on air
  conditioning, it’s not the only thing a school would need to be
  heat-resilient. Decreasing black pavement on playgrounds and increasing shade
  through planting trees are also common requirements. Green Schoolyards
  America, a non-profit aiming to create greener schoolyards, and Ten Strands, a
  California-based non-profit working to increase environmental literacy,
  recently collaborated on a tree canopy project to measure the amount of trees
  across the state’s schools. Climate experts recommend that urban areas,
  including school districts, have at least 30% tree canopy coverage. The study
  found that California schools had only a median of 6.4% tree canopy coverage,
  with less than half of the existing amount being accessible to children during
  their school day. “The average number of days hitting 87 degrees is increasing
  every year, and we estimate it will reach 120 days a year sometime in the
  2030s,” said Andra Yeghoian, chief information officer of Ten Strands. “Some
  people look at that and they’re like: ‘87, that’s just a nice day.’ And well,
  it’s a nice day if you are in air conditioning. But if you’re in a community
  that doesn’t have air conditioning, and you’re in a building trying to learn,
  that’s not a nice day,” Yeghoian added. “And if you’re going out to the
  playground and you have no shade and it’s just a blacktop, 87 degrees is
  actually more like 100 degrees.” The health stakes of rising temperatures are
  real, with children being especially vulnerable during heatwaves. Federal heat
  guidance lists children among the demographics at highest risk during extreme
  heat, and public health agencies advise schools to limit exertion, ensure
  hydration and adjust activities as temperatures rise. Data collected by
  UndauntedK12, another non-profit advocating for more heat-resistant facilities
  and a cosigner of the letter, suggests that more than 1,000 schools were
  affected by extreme heat during the 2024-2025 school year. “We see these
  headlines all the time now. It feels like every summer and even in the fall,
  schools are closing early,” said Kristen Hengtgen, the program director at
  UndauntedK12. “After-school activities are being canceled. We can see that so
  many of our schools are underprepared for extreme heat.” The hotter
  temperatures also contribute to higher rates of school absences, particularly
  for Black, Hispanic and lower-income students. Because children from
  low-income households are more likely to be enrolled in schools with
  inadequate air conditioning, these children often opt to stay home during the
  hottest days rather than take the risk of being stuck in a sweltering
  classroom. “One of my biggest concerns is that many kids who lack AC in their
  schools also don’t have it at home,” said Hengtgen. “I’m especially thinking
  of kids who may attend schools that are in low-income communities. We wouldn’t
  want them to be spending more of the hottest days in a hot home.” But just a
  year prior, it wasn’t only local non-profits spearheading ways to combat the
  increasing heat. The National Integrated Heat Health Information System
  (NIHHIS) was a collaboration of 29 federal health agencies established during
  the Obama administration to consolidate heat expertise. In early summer 2025,
  the Trump administration purged many of these experts, leaving the NIHHS
  severely understaffed. But there has been some progress on the state level.
  New York recently became the first state to pass legislation establishing
  guidelines for extreme heat conditions in school buildings. The law, which
  takes effect on 1 September, sets 88F (31C) as the maximum temperature for
  occupied spaces in school buildings. It also requires that schools take
  action, such as relocating students, when temperatures reach 82F. “For as long
  as people could remember here in New York, we had a minimum classroom and
  school building temperature of 65 degrees,” state senator James Skoufis, who
  championed the legislation, said in a recent presentation with the Center for
  American Progress. “But until this bill passed, we did not have a maximum
  temperature.” He added: “You can’t satisfactorily, in any way, shape or form,
  actually teach if it’s above 90 degrees in a classroom, never mind learn.” But
  one glaring problem still persists; even if schools across the country are
  successfully modified to be heat-resilient, most children are not in
  classrooms during the summer months. And summer vacation, the prime time for
  children to play outside without the stress of academia, is quickly becoming
  intolerable for outdoor play. So it raises the question: is it safer to keep
  kids in adequately cooled schools during extreme heat, or let them stay home
  to mitigate risk of heat exposure? And, as blasphemous as it might be to
  suggest, could there be a future where summer vacation becomes fall or spring
  vacation as a way to keep kids in air-conditioned classrooms during summer?
  “It’s definitely a needed conversation,” said Wickerson. “I’m not quite sure
  right now that we’re ready to have school in July, just because they’re not
  built for that operationally. But if there was a concerted effort to increase
  the cooling capabilities of these buildings, they probably would be some of
  the safer places for kids to go in the summer months.” Yeghoian also agrees
  that she could picture that future, but adds that simply moving the summer
  break wouldn’t do much to change the reality of kids needing year-round
  outdoor play. “What would be most ideal is children should have a balance of
  learning inside and learning outside, playing indoors and playing outdoors,”
  said Yeghoian, emphasizing the need for greener educational institutions. “If
  people are making the assumption that kids should only play outside during the
  summer, then yes, you’d have to really readjust the school calendar,” she
  said. “But our goal for the future should be that kids will have access to
  outdoor play every single day.”
