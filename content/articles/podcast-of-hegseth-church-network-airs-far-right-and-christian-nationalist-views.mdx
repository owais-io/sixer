  The flagship podcast of the Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches (CREC),
  the Christian denomination that claims US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, as
  a member, has functioned as a platform for the promotion of Christian
  nationalist and other far-right positions. CrossPolitic, whose hosts are close
  associates of Idaho-based pastor Douglas Wilson, has in recent weeks hosted a
  theocratic Canadian pastor who has called for his country to be absorbed by
  the United States, and a self-styled “patriot professor” who has backed the
  rise of Russia and China and the decline of liberal democracies and endorsed
  the criminalization of homosexuality in Uganda. The podcast’s themes and
  guests, and the prestige of its hosts in CREC circles, raise further questions
  about the extent to which Hegseth’s views on US foreign and defense policy
  have been shaped by a religious movement that directly opposes liberal
  democracy and democratic principles including individual women’s suffrage. One
  of the podcast’s guests even voiced support for the need for a modern US
  version of Oliver Cromwell, an English authoritarian and religious zealot who
  governed England as a dictator after the country’s 17th-century civil war. The
  Guardian contacted CrossPolitic for comment, at an address associated with
  co-host Gabe Rench. He responded: “I have followed your tabloid efforts on us,
  and I would urge you to repent of your sins, come to Christ, and find a good
  church.” CrossPolitic CrossPolitic is hosted by Rench, Toby Sumpter and
  Deleaone Shannon. All three have had high-profile associations with Wilson,
  Christ church and the CREC. Sumpter, formerly pastor at Christ church, is now
  pastor at Kings Cross church, also in Moscow, Idaho. It was according to its
  website “planted in Moscow, ID by Christ church in 2022 and is a member church
  of the Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches”. He is still also listed as
  an “elder pro tem” on the Christ church website. Rench, formerly a
  high-profile member of Christ church and a pastoral trainee there, is now a
  deacon at Kings Cross church, according to the church’s website and his own
  personal website. He is also founder of Dropwave, a “free speech” podcasting
  network, and also the Fight Laugh Feast network, which offers a platform for
  membership and distribution of Crosspolitic and other CREC-linked podcasts
  including Reformation Red Pill. The Guardian reported in August the RRP has
  advocated a range of extremist positions including capital punishment for
  abortion, the reversal of no-fault divorce, and bans on pornography, gay
  marriage and adoption by LGBTQ parents. Fight Laugh Feast also runs
  conferences. This year’s Fight Laugh Feast conference is themed “School Wars:
  Rebuilding Christendom with Your Kids.” Scheduled speakers include all three
  hosts of CrossPolitic, along with Wilson and David Goodwin, who was Pete
  Hegseth’s co-author on the book Battle for the American Mind. As the Guardian
  reported in January, that book claims to reveal a “progressive plan to
  neutralize the basis of our republic” via public schools, core curriculums,
  and even rituals such as the pledge of allegiance, all of which stretches back
  at least a century. On Hegseth’s account, writing the book inspired him to
  move his family to Tennessee, and subsequently to join Pilgrim Hill Reformed
  Fellowship, a CREC church that meets in Goodlettsville. In 2024, Hegseth told
  Joshua Haymes, the host of Reformation Red Pill, that “we moved to Tennessee
  to move to a classical Christian school because of this book. Because when I
  started writing it, we didn’t have all our kids in that form of education.”
  Later in the same podcast episode, he added: “We moved to a church and a
  community and a whole view of the world that has changed the way we think,
  too.” Steve Turley On 19 August, CrossPolitic published a hour-long episode
  with the hosts in conversation with Steve Turley. Turley, who styles himself
  as the “patriot professor”, is a classical guitarist, YouTuber and a prolific
  author whose books are either self-published or issued by religious or
  rightwing publishers. He has published at least one book with Canon Press, a
  publisher formerly owned by Christ Church and now controlled by Aaron Rench
  and Nathan Wilson, as the Guardian reported in 2021. Reportedly, Turley was
  also previously a contributor to Russian Faith, a website run by Charles
  Bausman, who was described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a “an
  American extremist, pro-Kremlin propagandist, Hitlerite and January 6 riot
  participant” who apparently fled the United States in the wake of the Capitol
  attack. The SPLC described Russian Faith as promoting “a reactionary,
  pro-Kremlin worldview for an English-speaking audience”. The Guardian
  contacted Turley for comment but received no response. The occasion for the
  podcast appearance was the publication of a new book by Turley, America
  Awakened: the Collapse of Globalism and the Return to Faith, Family, and
  Freedom. In the discussion, Turley expanded on the book’s themes of the
  collapse of the liberal-democratic international order, and – from Turley’s
  point of view – the welcome reassertion of traditional values in a worldwide
  rightwing populist revival. In the book and the podcast, however, he draws on
  the work of a neo-fascist writer. The book extensively cites the French “new
  right” fascist Guillaume Faye. At one point Turley writes: “We are entering an
  archeo-futurist era, a term coined by French scholar Guillaume Faye.
  Archeo-futurism argues that the modern globalist world, with its obsessive
  faith in progress, technocracy, and mass industrialization, has triggered a
  crisis of meaning – a spiritual and cultural exhaustion.” Turley also cites
  Faye in the CrossPolitics discussion, saying: “So this is where you get this
  notion of archeo-futurism, that’s the French theorist Guillaume Faye, again,
  writing it in the early 90s. It’s a really interesting time and all this stuff
  is coming out.” The hosts did not push back on Turley’s invocations of a
  neo-fascist author. Faye was a leading ideologue of Europe’s new right, best
  known for repackaging fascist themes, and dressing racial separatism and
  anti-immigrant extremism in intellectual language that has influenced today’s
  identitarian and far-right movements. Turley this year also advanced arguments
  and concepts associated with Faye in a foreword for a book published by a
  far-right press. He wrote it for a book, Multipolarity, written by Constantin
  Von Hoffmeister and published by Budapest-based Arktos Press. That publisher
  was once described by the SPLC as an “alt-right publishing syndicate”, which
  has translated and promoted racist books and which, according to Center for
  Media and Democracy “is closely tied to Richard Spencer, Red Ice and the white
  nationalist terrorist group the American Identity Movement”. Alongside
  Turley’s foreword is another written by far-right Russian philosopher
  Alexander Dugin. In his foreword, Turley celebrates what he sees as the
  recession of the liberal-democratic international order and the rise of
  authoritarian ethnonationalism around the world. Turley writes that “we are
  seeing nothing less than the great ancient civilizations of the past rising
  from the depths below and returning in all of their splendor all over the
  world.” Turley continues: “From Trump’s America First to Viktor Orbán’s Make
  Europe Great Again, from the revival of Tianxia or the Mandate of Heaven in
  China to the rise of Eurasianism in a renewed Russian Federation, from
  Pan-Africanism to Hindu Nationalism, the world is recalibrating around a
  plurality of political and civilizational poles.” Turley has a history of
  advancing extremist positions. In 2023, Right Wing Watch reported that Turley
  had on YouTube celebrated the passage of Ugandan laws that made identifying as
  gay or trans a crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Previously,
  according to Right Wing Watch, Turley produced and “energetically” promoted a
  “pro-Mastriano propaganda film” for the Pennsylvania gubernatorial campaign of
  then candidate Doug Mastriano. The film, entitled The Return of the American
  Patriot: the Rise of Pennsylvania, faced protests at the time of its launch,
  with theaters reportedly backing out of screenings. Hannah Gais, a senior
  research analyst at the SPLC, who has written extensively on the affinities
  between far-right movements in the US and Russia, said: “Steve Turley has long
  served as a sort of bridge between the far-right fringe and Maga, particularly
  when it comes to the movement’s approach to Russia and Russian nationalism. He
  frequently presents Russia as a traditionalist bulwark.” Gais added: “Like
  Dugin and a lot of Russian nationalists, Turley presents the conflict between
  the United States and Russia as a clash of civilizations. “To varying degrees,
  this is the worldview that has underpinned much of the Maga movement’s
  pro-Russian rhetoric – and it’s one that aligns perfectly with pro-Russian
  propaganda.” Jacob Reaume On 7 August CrossPolitic hosted a debate which
  included Canadian pastor Jacob Reaume on the topic “Are Kings or Constitutions
  more Biblical?” In the debate, Rench, the co-host, was arguing for
  constitutional government, which he explained at one point as “I would like
  our constitution to say the Bible is the highest law of the land. And so that
  moral code is required and you could get punished for it. And then here’s our
  secondary constitution.” Reaume disagreed, offering an even more authoritarian
  vision. “But when you say constitutional, some people hear, well, that means
  we’ve got to have a vote. It’s got to go through Congress and all this other
  stuff,” he said. Reaume added: “But in my mind, if the word of God is supreme,
  and it’s Congress or the vote or all these others, the parliament, they’re
  holding it up, then they’re in disobedience and they’re in violation of the
  constitution.” Reaume continued: “So now you have all of these parasites who
  are in the system, who are slowing down or poisoning the cup in order to get
  their way. And they’re using this whole process in order to drag us all down
  to hell. And I think someone like a Cromwell right now, if he had the base … I
  don’t know if the base is there.” Cromwell’s reign in England implemented
  religious authoritarianism, enforcing Puritan morality while suppressing
  dissenting faiths. Later in the podcast, Reaume said: “So a Cromwellian
  figure, if he has a solid base, will use the law to teach the ungodly that
  they are ungodly so that they will fear their sin.” Reaume has achieved some
  prominence in Canada as an advocate of theocratic rule and the end of Canadian
  self-governance. Last December on his blog, Reaume described Donald Trump’s
  threat to annex Canada as a “good and patriotic idea”, writing: “Before
  labelling me a traitor, consider that I am a patriotic Canadian, loyal to
  Canada’s historic constitutional order, but I am also awake to the fact that
  that order has been largely destroyed.” He added: “Our government has stripped
  us of our ability to defend ourselves, regularly violated private property
  rights, trampled on free enterprise, violated religious liberty, denigrated
  our identity, faces serious allegations of being treasonously compromised by
  foreign governments in India and China, and our courts have offered little to
  no recourse.” On the other hand, he wrote: “South of the border, Americans
  have maintained their right to bear arms, have found recourse in the courts
  for the Covid violations against business and churches, and are much more
  encouraging of the free market.” In the post’s conclusion, he asked: “If we,
  the amorphous nation of Canada, are to be absorbed, I cannot think of a nation
  I would rather absorb us than the United States. If it is not America, who
  will it be? China? India? Given the options, becoming the 51st state is the
  best.” In March, a Canadian political scientist, Noel Anderson, speculated
  that Hegseth’s Pentagon purges represented an “erosion of institutional checks
  that can impede the use of force”, including an invasion of Canada. Reaume has
  also been involved in efforts by a fundamentalist alliance, Liberty Coalition
  Canada, to deliver “conservative social and political policies based on
  literal interpretations of the Bible” by means including running political
  candidates. Liberty Coalition reportedly grew out of efforts to resist Covid
  restrictions. Reaume’s decision to continue hosting gatherings at his churches
  during the pandemic saw him receive charges in 2021. Reaume’s church in
  Waterloo, Ontario, celebrated resistance to Covid and kicked along the Liberty
  Coalition’s momentum with a 2022 event, the Church at War conference, which
  featured Rench as a speaker. The Guardian contacted Reaume for comment. In an
  email, he wrote: “You appear to be on a witch-hunt against Mr Pete Hegseth and
  President Trump.” Reaume continued: “For that reason, I am not interested in
  pursuing this further. May you find the love of God, which is exclusively
  available to all sinners in the cross of Christ.” Julie Ingersoll, a Professor
  of Religious Studies at the University of North Florida, has written
  extensively on the theocratic Christian reconstructionist movement that has
  influenced CREC churches. She said: “They want a theocratic America built on
  biblical law which is relatively closed to immigrants and non-Christians to
  preserve what they consider to be its character and original intent of the
  founders.” Ingersoll added: “But at the same time they believe that Christians
  across the globe should all work toward this in their respective nations and
  that all the Christian nations would be affiliated in something of a global
  faith, federated, theocratic reign of the Kingdom of God.”
