  Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday that Israel intends to take military
  control of all of Gaza in defiance of warnings that such a move would lead to
  countless more Palestinian deaths, further mass displacement and endanger
  Israeli hostages still held in the territory. Before a security cabinet
  meeting to discuss Gaza’s future, the Israeli prime minister insisted that
  Israel does not want to ultimately govern the territory and would hand over
  that responsibility to friendly Arab nations. Asked in an interview with Fox
  News if Israel would “take control of all of Gaza”, Netanyahu replied: “We
  intend to, in order to assure our security, remove Hamas there, enable the
  population to be free of Gaza.” The security cabinet would need to approve
  such a decision. “We don’t want to keep it. We want to have a security
  perimeter,” Netanyahu said. “We want to hand it over to Arab forces that will
  govern it properly without threatening us and giving Gazans a good life.” In
  Gaza, where Israel’s air and ground war has killed tens of thousands of
  people, displaced most of the population, destroyed vast areas and caused a
  famine, Palestinians are braced for further misery. “There is nothing left to
  occupy,” said Maysaa al-Heila, who is living in a displacement camp. “There is
  no Gaza left.” Aya Mohammad, a 30-year-old Palestinian who, after repeated
  displacement, had returned with her family to Gaza City, said: “Where should
  we go? We have been displaced and humiliated enough. “You know what
  displacement is? Does the world know? It means your dignity is wiped out, you
  become a homeless beggar, searching for food, water and medicine.” At least 42
  Palestinians were killed in Israeli airstrikes and shootings across southern
  Gaza on Thursday, according to local hospitals. At a meeting of Israel’s
  security cabinet on Thursday evening, Netanyahu was hoping to obtain approval
  for fully controlling the strip, Israeli media reported. Two government
  sources told Reuters any resolution by the security cabinet would need to be
  approved by the full cabinet, which may not meet until Sunday. The plan would
  mean sending ground troops into the few areas of the strip that have not been
  totally destroyed, roughly 25% of the territory where many of its 2 million
  people have sought refuge. Israel is reportedly preparing a two-phase
  operation aimed at seizing control of Gaza City, with plans to evacuate about
  1 million residents – half of Gaza’s population – in what officials describe
  as a temporary measure to establish civilian infrastructure in central Gaza.
  According to Israel’s Channel 12, the proposal is being framed as a limited
  operation rather than a full invasion, apparently to placate military chiefs
  wary of long-term occupation. The chief of staff, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, has
  reportedly warned that occupying Gaza would plunge Israel into a “black hole”
  of prolonged insurgency, humanitarian responsibility and heightened risk to
  hostages. However, the operation’s goal – potentially involving up to five IDF
  divisions and lasting four to five months – suggests a far more extensive
  campaign. Israeli officials say it aims to pressure Hamas back into
  negotiations and possibly align with a broader US-led peace framework. Yet
  many remain sceptical. As one unnamed security official put it: “We are
  entering a Vietnam model, with our eyes wide open.” Hamas in a statement
  called Netanyahu’s comments “a blatant coup” against the negotiation process.
  “Netanyahu’s plans to escalate the aggression confirm beyond any doubt his
  desire to get rid of the captives and sacrifice them in pursuit of his
  personal interests and extremist ideological agenda,” the group said in a
  statement. Hamas official Osama Hamdan told Al Jazeera the group would treat
  any force formed to govern Gaza as an “occupying” force linked to Israel. Arab
  countries would “only support what Palestinians agree and decide on,” a
  Jordanian official source told Reuters, adding that security in Gaza should be
  handled through “legitimate Palestinian institutions.” Earlier this year
  Israel and the United States rejected an Egyptian proposal, backed by Arab
  leaders, that envisaged the creation of an administrative committee of
  independent, professional Palestinian technocrats entrusted with the
  governance of Gaza after the war. Netanyahu is under intense international
  pressure to reach a ceasefire agreement, but he also faces pressure from
  within his coalition to continue the war. Some far-right allies in his
  government have pushed for a full occupation of Gaza and for Israel to
  reestablish settlements there, two decades after it withdrew. The far-right
  finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, told reporters on Wednesday that he hoped
  the government would approve the military taking control of the rest of Gaza.
  The World Health Organization said on Thursday that 99 people were known to
  have died from malnutrition in the Gaza Strip so far this year, with the
  figure probably an underestimate. International outrage over the humanitarian
  situation in Gaza has ratcheted up pressure on Israel, with UN agencies
  warning of famine. The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus,
  called for scaled-up, sustained and unimpeded aid to be allowed to flow into
  Gaza, through all possible routes. People in Gaza “have limited access to
  basic services, have faced repeated displacement and are now suffering from a
  blockade of food supplies”, he told the UN correspondents’ association ACANU.
  “Malnutrition is widespread and hunger-related deaths are rising.” In July,
  nearly 12,000 children under five were identified as suffering from acute
  malnutrition – the highest monthly figure ever recorded. More than 61,000
  Palestinians have been killed by Israel’s assault on Gaza, according to local
  health officials, though that figure is regarded as a significant
  underestimate. According to a satellite survey published by the UN’s Food and
  Agriculture Organization, just 1.5% of Gaza’s farmland – less than one square
  mile – is now accessible and undamaged. Meanwhile, in Israel, the families of
  the roughly 20 remaining living hostages have called for Israelis to protest
  against the government and a decision they fear would endanger the lives of
  their loved ones. On Thursday morning, about 20 family members of those still
  held captive in Gaza boarded boats that departed from the coastal city of
  Ashkelon, near the border with Gaza, carrying yellow flags and posters bearing
  the images of the hostages, as they shouted their names. “This is the moment
  for courageous leadership,” the families said, appealing directly to
  Netanyahu, as well as the lead hostage negotiator, Ron Dermer, and the IDF
  chief. “Continued obstruction, delay, and failure to bring our loved ones home
  will be a tragedy for generations. The responsibility is yours. Do not
  sacrifice our loved ones on the altar of an endless war.” Of the 251 people
  kidnapped on 7 October 2023, by Hamas and its allies, 49 remain hostages in
  Gaza, of whom 27 have been declared dead by the army. In the West Bank,
  Israeli authorities returned the body of the Palestinian activist Awdah
  Hathaleen, who was killed by an Israeli settler last week, after his female
  Bedouin relatives began a hunger strike to protest the authority’s decision to
  hold his body in custody. The hunger strike was a rare public call from
  Bedouin women who traditionally mourn in private. Hathaleen was shot and
  killed by an Israeli settler during a confrontation caught on video.
