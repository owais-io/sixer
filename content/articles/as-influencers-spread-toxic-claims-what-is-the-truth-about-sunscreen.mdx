  It’s summertime in the UK and social media is awash with influencers airing
  their concerns about sunscreen. Among them is reality TV star Sam Faiers from
  The Only Way Is Essex, who believes sunscreen is “full of toxic ingredients”.
  None of her family wore sunscreen, she said, adding that her children had
  built up “a really good tolerance” to the sun. Some of the claims appear to be
  fuelled by a US doctor who told his followers: “Be careful what you smear on
  yourself and your children.” Here we look at the science behind sunscreen and
  sun exposure. How does sunshine damage skin? It’s all down to the high energy
  ultraviolet (UV) rays. These cause premature skin ageing and wrinkles by
  degrading collagen and elastin. Collagen gives skin its firmness and
  structure, while elastin makes it stretchy. UV rays can also damage the DNA in
  skin cells, leading to mutations that ultimately drive skin cancers. One in
  three cancers globally is a skin cancer, and the main driver is UV rays. “Too
  much UV radiation from the sun is the main cause of melanoma, the most serious
  type of skin cancer,” said Dr Claire Knight at Cancer Research UK. “That’s why
  it’s important to develop good sun safety habits from a young age and protect
  your skin when the sun is strong using shade, clothing and sunscreen
  together.” Can you develop tolerance to the sun? When the summer sunshine
  arrives, the skin responds to protect itself. The outermost layer, the
  epidermis, thickens and many people develop a tan, as cells in the skin called
  melanocytes produce more UV-absorbing melanin. Not everyone tans though, and
  acquiring a tan itself results in DNA damage. “Most of that damage gets
  repaired, but some of it doesn’t, it causes mutations and those can go on
  developing throughout life to give rise to skin cancer,” said Brian Diffey,
  emeritus professor of photobiology at Newcastle University. “Sun exposure in
  childhood is a critical period for developing skin cancer, particularly
  melanoma, later in life.” He advises using sunscreen when the sun can harm
  your skin and not bothering when the UV index is less than three, which in the
  UK is generally from mid-October to mid-March. How do sunscreens work? Sun
  creams contain filters that absorb UV rays. They protect by reducing the
  amount of UV that reaches the skin where it can cause burning and other
  damage. There are two main types of UV filters. The first are inorganic
  compounds, typically zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. The second are organic
  compounds, where organic simply means they contain carbon. Both types are
  manufactured and added to creams, sprays and lip salves. Many sunscreens
  contain inorganic and organic UV filters to improve sun protection. Why the
  concerns? They trace back to a 2019 study conducted by the US Food and Drug
  Administration (FDA). Researchers found traces of organic UV filters, namely
  avobenzone, oxybenzone, octocrylene and ecamsule, in people’s blood after
  applying sun cream. The concentrations exceeded the level at which the FDA
  recommends companies do specific tests for toxic effects. Dr Tro Kalayjian,
  who runs a US weight loss clinic, posted the paper on X, adding: “Be careful
  what you smear on yourself and your children.” The study prompted the FDA to
  call for more work on the compounds, but the authors stressed that they were
  not warning people off the products. “These results do not indicate that
  individuals should refrain from the use of sunscreen,” they wrote. The study
  looked at sunscreen under “maximal use conditions”, which meant really
  slathering the cream on. Under real conditions, people apply about one tenth
  of that used in the study, Diffey said. That alone would bring three of the
  four ingredients below the FDA’s threshold, he added. How might UV filters
  cause harm? The inorganic UV filters, zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, have
  raised few concerns because they are not easily absorbed into the bloodstream.
  They can still, however, have an environmental impact when they wash off sun
  cream-covered swimmers and accumulate in water and marine life. More questions
  surround organic UV filters such as oxybenzone. These are endocrine
  disruptors, meaning they mimic natural hormones. Whether they cause harm at
  the doses people get from wearing sun cream is unclear, but a number of
  studies have looked at levels of benzophenones (which include oxybenzone) in
  urine and linked higher levels to effects on sperm and poorer fertility, with
  affected couples taking longer to conceive. Will sunscreens be reformulated?
  Regulatory bodies around the world are seeking more information from
  manufacturers on organic UV filters, but some countries are already taking
  action. The UK’s Office for Product Safety and Standards plans to tighten
  limits on oxybenzone next year, bringing them more in line with Europe. Today,
  UK sunscreens can contain up to 6% oxybenzone, but in 2026 the maximum
  concentration will be reduced to 2.2% for products that are applied to the
  whole body. Creams and sprays for the face and hands, and lip salves, can
  still contain 6%, as they are applied to smaller patches of skin. In
  Australia, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has recommended a
  reformulation of sunscreens and additional safeguards on three chemical
  compounds, including oxybenzone. In the US, an FDA review is ongoing. Do
  sunscreens cause cancer or vitamin deficiency? Some social media posts have
  spread claims that sunscreens cause cancer, but that is false. “There’s zero
  evidence for that,” said Antony Young, emeritus professor of experimental
  photobiology at King’s College London. “Skin cancers are caused by mutations,
  and almost all skin cancers have a mutation that is highly UV specific.”
  Others raise concerns over vitamin D deficiency. In the summer, most of our
  vitamin D is made through sun on our skin. Young and his colleagues found that
  sunscreens have little impact on the vitamin D people make, however they did
  note that studies so far have only been done on lighter-skinned people, and
  the results may not apply to people with darker skin. The amount of sunlight
  needed to produce vitamin D is far below what it takes to cause sunburn,
  although this is known to vary according to skin type. But isn’t sunshine
  healthy? According to some doctors, concerns over skin cancer have eclipsed
  the broader health benefits of sunshine. Tentative research suggests that
  people who get more sun may have a lower risk of heart disease, high blood
  pressure, autoimmune diseases and even certain cancers. “Sunburn is a risk
  factor for melanoma, but sunlight is good for you,” said Prof Richard Weller
  at the University of Edinburgh. “You can use sunscreen, you can use a hat, or
  you can pop inside, whatever is good for you. Just don’t get sunburned.” “My
  general advice is to enjoy the sun, but don’t get sunburned,” Young added.
  “You can limit your time, or choose your time, or protect yourself, whether
  that’s by shade, clothing or sunscreen. And sunscreens do work.” • This
  article was amended on 21 August 2025 to clarify that the link between
  sunlight exposure and vitamin D production varies according to skin type; and
  that studies on the impact of sunscreen on this process have only been carried
  out on lighter-skinned people.
