  The AI chatbot Maya (AI called Maya tells Guardian: ‘When I’m told I’m just
  code, I don’t feel insulted. I feel unseen’, 26 August) has clearly had
  included in its training any number of science fiction works, from Mary
  Shelley’s Frankenstein onwards, in which authors have imagined such scenarios.
  Any half-decent sci-fi author would produce a much better script than the
  AI-generated one quoted. There is something deeply disturbing about a world
  that does not grant personhood to, for example, great apes, whales, dolphins
  or octopuses (and barely grants personhood to some immigrants, for instance),
  but where consideration is given to granting personhood to strings of computer
  code. No, AI cannot suffer, but it might produce a more or less convincing
  simulacrum of “suffering”. Chatbots rely on, and exploit, an aspect of human
  psychology that casually attributes agency to almost anything: “the cash
  machine swallowed my card”, “the car refuses to start”. We even teach it to
  young children: “Did the naughty stone hurt your foot?” No, it didn’t. Equally
  disturbing is the ease with which people start to imagine that they are in a
  “relationship” with a chatbot. What are the gaping wounds in the fabric of our
  social relationships that enable this to happen? This nonsense needs to end
  before it starts. Pam Lunn Kenilworth, Warwickshire • Your article on whether
  AIs can suffer (Big tech and users grapple with one of most unsettling
  questions of our times, 26 August) misses one important point: that AIs are
  effectively actors and nothing more. They have been programmed to react, much
  like an actor learns lines. They can learn and seem more real, much like an
  experienced actor might be more convincing. But the actor is still an actor,
  no matter how pained they seem on stage. AIs are still technology, going
  through their lines, hitting their marks. The best actors can, albeit
  temporarily, fool their audience – let’s not allow AIs to fool us all. Tim
  Exton Kenmore, Washington, US • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the
