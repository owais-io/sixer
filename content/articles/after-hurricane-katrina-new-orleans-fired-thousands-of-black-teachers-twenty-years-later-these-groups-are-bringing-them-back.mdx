  Dr Adrienne D Dixson was furious as she sat in the back of a Louisiana
  courtroom in 2008. It was more than two years after thousands of New Orleans
  public school teachers had been terminated in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.
  Some of those teachers had filed a lawsuit against the Orleans parish school
  board for wrongful termination and to be compensated for lost wages. The scene
  in the room was emotional, Dixson recalled, as many teachers broke down into
  tears throughout the hearing. “It was clear the love and the care and the
  dedication that the teachers had,” Dixson said. An associate professor in
  education at Ohio State University at the time, Dixson was conducting research
  on Black educators and the effects of Hurricane Katrina. “They were just so
  profoundly hurt that they had been fired,” she said. “No one knew that the
  hurricane would also be a category 5 professional disruption.” After Katrina,
  the Orleans parish school board terminated more than 4,000 teachers, most of
  whom were Black women with at least 15 years of experience, as the state-run
  Recovery School District assumed responsibility for most of New Orleans’s
  schools. Created in 2003 by the Louisiana legislature, the Recovery School
  District took over the operations of failing schools. The state and city
  education agencies eventually transferred all of the schools to charter
  management organizations that signed contracts with the state or the school
  district and received public funding. Some of the terminated teachers returned
  to the industry in the following years, but the hurricane ushered in a blow to
  the Black educator workforce, which has yet to fully recover. In the 20 years
  since Hurricane Katrina made landfall along the northern Gulf coast in August
  2005, New Orleans’s education system has gone through drastic changes as the
  schools transformed into a public charter school system. Black children, who
  make up the majority of the student population at more than 90% of the
  schools, have felt the negative impacts of the decrease in Black teachers most
  severely, say some researchers, such as a reduction in Black role models and a
  lost sense of community. Before Hurricane Katrina, 71% of public educators
  were Black. But by 2014, the number of Black teachers had dipped to 49%. In
  recent years, the Black teacher population has increased to 56%. The number of
  Black teachers has never returned to its pre-Katrina level in the decades
  following the storm. Research shows that Black students who have at least one
  teacher of the same racial identity by third grade are 13% more likely to
  graduate from high school and 19% more likely to enroll in higher education
  than their Black peers without one. And Black students perform better in math
  and reading when taught by Black teachers. A recent study from Tulane
  University’s initiative Education Research Alliance for New Orleans showed
  that Black students reported less positive educational environments than white
  students a few years in a row. But the study author and founding director of
  the university’s initiative, Douglas Harris, said that it’s difficult to
  measure the impact that the dip in Black teachers has had on Black students’
  perceptions of their education environment since no such surveys were
  conducted prior to the storm. “The race of the teachers can’t be the only
  thing,” Harris said, adding that Black teachers have increased since the early
  to mid 2000s. “So it’s probably something more about other elements of the
  background of the teachers or about the accountability system.” In recent
  years, Black-led charter systems and organizations have served as models for
  schools wanting to incorporate more Black empowerment into the education
  system. Started in 2017, the Black-governed non-profit Black Education for New
  Orleans (Be Nola) offers various professional development programs for
  teachers and a digital syllabus that uses the history of Black education as a
  guidepost to reimagine the current school system. The syllabus references the
  New Orleans writing program Students at the Center, where students were
  encouraged to read texts from the author bell hooks and to examine systemic
  injustices in the city. It also mentions laws that threaten the critical
  examination of systemic injustices, including a state act that removed teacher
  instruction on dating violence and training on cultural competence. And at the
  Black-led charter school system InspireNola founded through community support
  in 2013, 83% of the teachers are Black or brown, and the majority-Black
  student population sees a 100% graduation rate. But efforts to increase Black
  educators in the city have hit a roadblock with the Trump administration’s
  recent cancellation of $23m in federal funding for teacher-training programs
  designed to increase diversity throughout the state. Non-profit organizations
  and researchers say that the persisting 15% drop in Black educators since
  Hurricane Katrina has affected Black teachers’ and students’ sense of safety
  in the school environment. Black teachers are often unable to infuse Black
  empowerment into their lesson plans. New Orleans charter schools rely on
  standardized tests to evaluate school performance, which leaves less freedom
  for creative lesson plans. Teachers are at-will employees and can be fired at
  any time, “so people don’t feel as comfortable to be themselves when their job
  is on the line”, said Stevona Elem-Rogers, Be Nola’s chief of community
  programs and partnerships. “When a Black student isn’t able to not just see a
  reflection of themselves, but see someone who is truly brilliant and helping
  them problem-solve through life, then they waywardly go through life,”
  Elem-Rogers said. “And when we as human beings waywardly go through life, we
  may see more crimes. We may see more disassociation from our lifestyle. We may
  see more riffs in our family.” On the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina,
  New Orleans’s schools illustrate the complexities of rebuilding an education
  system following a disaster. It shows the power of community-led efforts to
  transform schools into safe environments for Black students where they feel
  empowered and excel in their studies. When Adrinda Kelly, Be Nola’s executive
  director, tells educators and non-profit leaders in other cities with large
  Black populations that 96% of teachers in the organization’s fellowship
  program stay in the industry following the program, they are astonished.
  “People from Chicago, people from DC, people from Atlanta say: ‘We need this
  in our space,’” Kelly said. “And so Katrina and Black people in New Orleans
  saying that we deserve better for our Black children has charged the path to
  create spaces where we’re able to bridge generations of brilliant Black
  minds.” ‘An intentional plan to eradicate a Black teaching force’ Even before
  the storm, the state of Louisiana took steps to exert more control over New
  Orleans’s school system. While positive facets of the pre-Katrina schools
  included the promotion of Black empowerment, another side of the education
  system ushered in its downfall. A long history of racial segregation,
  financial disinvestment in the predominantly Black schools, and school
  district instability led to underperforming schools. Sixty percent of the
  student population attended schools that the Louisiana department of education
  rated as failing prior to Hurricane Katrina. Only 6% of the student population
  performed at a mastery level on state exams. As a result, the state
  legislature created the state-run Recovery School District two years prior to
  the storm to oversee low-performing schools. Intervention from the district
  included transferring schools to charter operators, partnering with
  universities or education management organizations to help run them, or
  shutting down the schools altogether. According to state test scores, the
  intervention worked: the student population that scored at a mastery level in
  state exams increased to 30% a decade after the storm. But for much of the New
  Orleans Black population, the destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina provided
  ample opportunity for education reformers, some of whom were from out of
  state, to overhaul the school system. “Like colonial regimes of prior,” wrote
  scholar Kevin Lawrence Henry Jr in an American Educational Research Journal
  paper, “the habitability of New Orleans was made manifest in the destinies of
  new settlers, the erasure of locals, and understanding this Black space, as
  blank space for redevelopment.” After longtime educators were laid off
  following the storm, just a third of pre-Katrina teachers returned to work in
  the school system. Many of the educators who filled their spots came from the
  non-profit Teach for America, which places recent college graduates into
  under-resourced schools; sixty per cent were white and more than half received
  educations outside New Orleans. The termination of Black teachers also
  decimated the United Teachers of New Orleans, an educators union that
  consisted mostly of Black women who were veteran educators. It was the first
  teachers’ union in the deep south to win a collective bargaining agreement.
  “To summarily fire and get rid of Black teachers allowed a complete takeover.
  And I would argue a destruction, but some would probably say a remaking, of
  public education in New Orleans,” said Dixson, who is now Penn State
  University’s education policy studies department head. “The teachers had to be
  moved out in order for these things to happen, because the teachers’ union was
  very strong.” Prior to Katrina, the teachers were rooted in the community,
  said Dixson. Many of them lived in the same neighborhoods as the students,
  knew several generations of the children’s families or had attended the same
  schools as youth. The firing of teachers and education reform is “hard not to
  see as a concerted effort and an intentional plan to eradicate a Black
  teaching force”, she said. “It was a powerful political block, not only in New
  Orleans, but in the state.” Test scores are only one piece of a well-rounded
  education, she said. For Dixson, what is missing are role models who look like
  the students and can help instill strong cultural values in them. Be Nola was
  born out of a community-led response to the anger around the firing of
  teachers and that “education reform had been done to them and not with them”,
  said Elem-Rogers. The organization started with a coalition of Black New
  Orleanians who wanted to see more Black influence in the education system. Now
  the non-profit hosts a professional learning community for Black-led schools
  to learn from one another, and to receive coaching from Black institutions.
  From 2 to 5 October, the group will host its fifth annual Black Is Brilliant
  summit, where Black teachers from throughout the nation will discuss policy
  and how to help Black children thrive in the classroom. Last year, 1,000
  people registered for the event. Be Nola’s paid fellowship program, the Black
  Is Brilliant Institute, has also led to higher retention of Black teachers –
  96% of the 60 teachers who have enrolled in the program since its inception in
  2023 have remained in the industry. Every weekend for six months, Black
  teachers commune with each other with the aim of taking what they’ve learned
  about creating safe and joyful educational spaces back to their classrooms.
  They engage in wellness activities such as deep breathing and yoga, and they
  learn about the history of Black education in the city through lectures by
  historians. They also visit the Amistad Research Center, the oldest African
  American independent archive in the country, and St Mary’s Academy, one of the
  nation’s oldest Black Catholic schools. The organization is interested in the
  “broader questions that get to the heart of the education ideologies
  undergirding our space”, said Kelly, including: “What do we mean by the role
  of legacy in how we formulate school quality? What does success mean?” For
  Kelly, the Black leaders behind the charter school system InspireNola, which
  operates seven public charter schools in the city, understand the role of
  community and legacy. It’s helped the charter management organization, which
  serves more than 5,400 students from pre-kindergarten to 12th grade, become
  one of the highest-performing charter networks in the city. Jamar McKneely,
  InspireNola’s CEO and co-founder, said that Black governing has set a powerful
  example of what success looks like for the predominantly Black student body:
  McKneely is a Black man, the board is predominantly Black and brown, and they
  mostly have educators of color. He began the operation more than a decade ago
  after seeing a need for more Black leadership in a post-Katrina charter school
  landscape that was predominantly white-led. The organization helps inspire
  students by hosting Black speakers including Bernice King, a lawyer and Martin
  Luther King Jr’s daughter, and Sybrina Fulton, Trayvon Martin’s mother. They
  also host back-to-school drives and giveaways to meet the needs of the
  students and the local community. Leaders of other charter school networks in
  the city sometimes visit InspireNola schools to observe their governing and
  practices. “We see other charter networks following our lead to get more
  inclusive and more responsive to the community needs, especially around Black
  and brown students,” said McKneely. “We serve as a model for what can happen
  in a community where you embrace the community, you’re part of the community.”
