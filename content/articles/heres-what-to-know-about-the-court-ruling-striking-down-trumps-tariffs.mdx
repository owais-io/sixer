  Donald Trump suffered the biggest defeat yet to his tariff policies on Friday,
  as a federal appeals court ruled he had overstepped his presidential powers
  when he enacted punitive financial measures against almost every country in
  the world. In a 7-4 ruling, the Washington DC court said that while US law
  “bestows significant authority on the president to undertake a number of
  actions in response to a declared national emergency”, none of those actions
  allow for the imposition of tariffs or taxes. It means the ultimate ruling on
  the legality of Trump’s tariffs, which were famously based on spurious
  economic science and rocked the global economy when he announced them in
  April, will probably be made by the US supreme court. Here’s what to know.
  Which tariffs did the court knock down? The decision centers on the tariffs
  Trump introduced on 2 April, on what he called “liberation day”. The tariffs
  set a 10% baseline on virtually all of the US’s trading partners and so-called
  “reciprocal” tariffs on countries he argued have unfairly treated the US.
  Lesotho, a country of 2.3 million people in southern Africa, was hit with a
  50% tariff, while Trump also announced a tariff of 10% on a group of
  uninhabited islands populated by penguins. The ruling voided all those
  tariffs, with the judges finding the president’s measures “unbounded in scope,
  amount and duration”. They said the tariffs “assert an expansive authority
  that is beyond the express limitations” of the law his administration used to
  pass them. Tariffs typically need to be approved by Congress, but Trump
  claimed he has the right to impose tariffs on trading partners under the
  International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which in some
  circumstances grants the president authority to regulate or prohibit
  international transactions during a national emergency. The court ruled: “It
  seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its
  past practice and grant the president unlimited authority to impose tariffs.”
  Trump invoked the same law in February to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and
  China, claiming that the flow of undocumented immigrants and drugs across the
  US border amounted to a national emergency, and that the three countries
  needed to do more to stop it. Are the tariffs gone now? No. The court largely
  upheld a May decision by a federal trade court in New York that ruled Trump’s
  tariffs were illegal. But Friday’s ruling tossed out a part of that ruling
  that would have struck down the tariffs immediately. The court said the ruling
  would not take effect until 14 October. That allows the Trump administration
  time to appeal to the majority-conservative US supreme court, which will have
  the ultimate say on whether Trump has the legal right, as president, to upend
  US trade policy. What does this mean for Trump’s trade agenda? The government
  has argued that if Trump’s tariffs are struck down, it might have to refund
  some of the import taxes that it has collected, which would deliver a
  financial blow to the US treasury. Revenue from tariffs totaled $159bn by
  July, more than double what it was at the same point last year. The justice
  department warned in a legal filing this month that revoking the tariffs could
  mean “financial ruin” for the United States. The ruling could also put Trump
  on shaky ground in trying to impose tariffs going forward. The president does
  have alternative laws for imposing import tariffs, but they would limit the
  speed and severity with which he could act. In its decision in May, the trade
  court said that Trump has more limited power to impose tariffs to address
  trade deficits under another statute, the Trade Act of 1974. But that law
  restricts tariffs to 15% and to just 150 days on countries with which the
  United States runs big trade deficits. How has Trump responded He’s not happy.
  Trump spent Friday evening reposting dozens of social media posts that were
  critical of the court’s decision. In a post on his own social media site,
  Trump claimed, as he tends to do when judges rule against him, that the
  decision was made by a “highly partisan appeals court”. “If these Tariffs ever
  went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country,” Trump wrote. He
  added: “If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United
  States of America.” Trump claimed “tariffs are the best tool to help our
  workers”, despite their costs being typically borne by everyday Americans. The
  tariffs have triggered economic and political uncertainty across the world and
  stoked fears of rising inflation.
