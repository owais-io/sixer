  The greatest gift we can receive is our own story. But most of us don’t know
  what ours holds any further back than our grandparents’ generation. The good
  news? A simple AncestryDNA test can help you trace your story a long way
  further back than that. Not only can you uncover your ethnic makeup, but you
  can see how your ancestors moved from place to place, and the countries,
  cities or towns they once called home. Ancestry has more than 40 years of
  experience in family history, making it a leader in the field. And its DNA
  tests have only got better with time; for instance, they can now detect
  African ethnic groups that were previously unmapped. DNA tests are also more
  accessible than ever, with an AncestryDNA kit priced from $90. Nab one for
  yourself to begin uncovering your own story, or give your dad or partner the
  chance to discover theirs. The kits are on sale now, just in time for Father’s
  Day. The Ancestry experience After you order your kit online, it arrives in
  the post, complete with simple instructions. You send a saliva sample back in
  the prepaid package and your results are ready in about six to eight weeks.
  That’s when the real fun begins. You’ll receive a detailed breakdown of your
  ancestral regions in a percentage pie chart, and an interactive map (a great
  way to confirm a long-held hunch that you really are a descendent of the
  Vikings). You can read historical context about the places your ancestors
  lived and how and why they may have moved from one place to another, and
  connect with other Ancestry users to whom you may be related. Given that
  Ancestry has the world’s largest collection of online family history records,
  from archives in Australia, New Zealand and around the world, it is well
  positioned to connect you with your heritage. The power of DNA Our DNA
  determines who we are. And with AncestryDNA + Traits, Ancestry can take you
  under the hood of how your DNA has shaped your identity. You can find out how
  your DNA affects more than 75 personality, appearance, nutrient and sensory
  traits – including hair type, eye colour, whether you might dislike coriander,
  and whether you’re likely to be an early riser. The insights make for great
  family dinner conversation, but beyond that, you can also see how your traits
  relate to the geographic regions in your AncestryDNA results, and compare them
  with anyone else who has AncestryDNA Traits. It’s so much more than a DNA
  test. Ancestry is a way to reveal the people and places in your past, and a
  chance to keep your family story alive for future generations. The kit is
  affordable, but the results can be priceless. Give the gift of discovery this
  Father’s Day.
