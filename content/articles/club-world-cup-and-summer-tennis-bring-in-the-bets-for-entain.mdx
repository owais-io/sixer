  A flurry of bets on the football Club World Cup, England’s triumphant European
  Women’s Championship campaign and summer tennis tournaments helped the UK
  gambling company Entain to better-than-expected results, helping it brace for
  looming tax rises in its domestic market. The owner of brands including
  Ladbrokes and Coral reported an 11% rise in underlying profits to £583m in the
  first half of the year, on revenues that rose 3% to nearly £2.6bn. At BetMGM,
  Entain’s 50%-owned US joint-venture, revenues rose by more than a third. US
  sports betting continues to grow rapidly following the supreme court’s
  overturning in 2018 of a decades-old ban on the practice. But Entain also
  performed strongly in its home market, with online gambling revenues up 21% in
  the UK and Ireland. Entain said the Club World Cup, held in the US earlier
  this summer, had delivered “fantastic results” for the company, despite a
  muted response to the tournament in the UK. Entain describes Brazil as one of
  its “must win” markets, alongside the UK and US, and it has a partnership with
  the São Paulo team – and Club World Cup participant – Palmeiras. The company
  said this helped boost local interest in betting on the tournament. The Club
  World Cup final, between Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain, was the year’s most
  popular event by the number of bets taken. The French Open and Wimbledon
  tennis tournaments also delivered new records for the company, amid surging
  interest from gamblers in a sport whose design inherently creates
  opportunities to place rapid-fire wagers. Female tennis players have spoken
  out this year about the abuse they receive, often from gamblers frustrated by
  having lost bets. Entain’s chief executive, Stella David, appointed earlier
  this year after her predecessor, Gavin Isaacs, departed suddenly after five
  months, said the results showed the company was “getting stronger, fitter and
  faster”. Entain’s improved fortunes in the UK could cushion the blow if the
  Treasury goes ahead with plans to target the gambling industry with higher
  taxes, as the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, casts around for ways to plug a
  fiscal hole. Gordon Brown, a former prime minister who also served a decade as
  chancellor, called recently for gambling duties to increase by £3bn, from
  about £2.5bn at present, to pay for lifting the two-child limit on benefits.
  The Treasury is expected to increase taxes levied on the sector, albeit by a
  smaller amount than Brown has suggested. Speaking to analysts about tax, David
  said: “People should look at the maths and be very careful about where we go
  forward. There is already a large black market in the UK and driving up tax
  rates has the potential of reducing the tax take because people go to the
  black market.” Industry lobbyists have argued that increased taxes would force
  bookmakers to pass on the cost in the form of worse odds available to
  gamblers, which would drive them to illegal operators. While Entain reported
  rising underlying profit, it lost £96m before tax overall, due to the impact
  of one-off costs including amortisation of acquisitions and the cost of legal
  issues. These include alleged non-compliance with money-laundering laws in
  Australia and a deferred prosecution agreement relating to bribery charges
  involving a business it owned in Turkey.
