  Paris Jackson has criticised an upcoming biopic of her father, Michael
  Jackson, saying she had “zero per cent involvement” in the film, which she
  suggests has been “sugar-coated” in a broader swipe at Hollywood biopics that
  contain “full-blown lies”. The comments came just two days after the actor
  Colman Domingo, who plays the family patriarch Joe Jackson in the film
  Michael, praised Paris’s contribution. On Sunday, while hosting the amfAR
  benefit gala for Aids research at Venice film festival, Domingo told People
  magazine that Paris and her brother Prince were “very much in support of our
  film”. Domingo said Paris had been “nothing but lovely and warm” to him. “I’m
  excited to be here at Amfar tonight with Paris,” he said. “It feels like
  that’s a nice way for us to be together.” On Tuesday night Paris took to
  Instagram to reject Domingo’s version of events. “Don’t be telling people I
  was ‘helpful’ on the set of a movie I had zero per cent involvement in lol
  that is so weird,” the 27-year-old singer and actor wrote. “I read one of the
  first drafts of the script and gave my notes about what was dishonest / didn’t
  sit right with me, and when they didn’t address it, I moved on with my life.
  “Not my monkeys, not my circus. God bless and God speed.” She later expanded
  on her comments in follow-up Instagram stories, saying she had been explicitly
  told the production would not address her notes. “So I just butted out and
  left it alone because it’s not my project,” she said. “They’re going to make
  whatever they’re going to make. A big reason why I haven’t said anything up
  until this point is because I know a lot of you guys are gonna be happy with
  it. “A big section of the film panders to a very specific section of my dad’s
  fandom that still lives in the fantasy, and they’re gonna be happy with it.”
  Paris continued to critique the “sugar-coated” Hollywood biopic model
  generally: “The narrative is being controlled and there’s a lot of inaccuracy
  and there’s a lot of just full-blown lies. At the end of the day, that doesn’t
  really fly with me. Go enjoy it. Do whatever. Leave me out of it.” The biopic,
  which has been produced in conjunction with the Jackson estate, has been
  gestating since at least 2019. It attracted controversy when Puck magazine
  reported that the film was facing rewrites and reshoots after a third-act
  plotline about one of Michael Jackson’s accusers could not be used for legal
  reasons. A source close to the production denied the reports. “The Michael
  Jackson biopic is not in total chaos,” the source told People at the time.
  “The inflammatory headlines about the moving halting are simply not true.”
  Jaafar Jackson, Michael Jackson’s nephew, will make his feature debut as the
  pop megastar in the biopic, whose cast also includes Miles Teller, Nia Long
  and Kat Graham. Michael is set for release on 24 April 2026. The Guardian has
  contacted representatives for Domingo, as well as the biopic’s production
  company, for comment.
