  Microsoft is investigating how Israel’s military surveillance agency, Unit
  8200, is using its Azure cloud storage platform, amid concerns the company’s
  staff in Israel may have concealed key details about its work on sensitive
  military projects. Senior executives are scrambling to assess what data Unit
  8200 holds in Azure after a Guardian investigation revealed how the spy agency
  has used the cloud platform to store a vast collection of intercepted
  Palestinian mobile phone calls. The joint investigation with the
  Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and Hebrew-language outlet Local
  Call found Unit 8200 has used a customised and segregated area within Azure to
  store recordings of millions of calls made each day in Gaza and the West Bank.
  According to Unit 8200 sources interviewed as part of the investigation,
  intelligence drawn from the enormous repository of phone calls held in the
  cloud has been used to research and identify bombing targets in Gaza.
  Published on Wednesday, the report has sparked concerns among Microsoft’s
  leadership about whether some of its Israel-based employees have been fully
  transparent about their knowledge of how Unit 8200 uses Azure, sources
  familiar with the situation said. According to the sources, an internal effort
  is now under way to determine the nature of the information being housed in
  Microsoft’s datacentres and re-examine how it is being used by the Israeli
  military in its war on Gaza. In May, Microsoft said a review into its
  relationship with the military found “no evidence to date” that Azure had been
  “used to target or harm people” in Gaza. The review’s findings are understood
  to have relied in part on assurances the company received from Israel-based
  staff. However, in recent days some senior executives at the company’s US
  headquarters have raised doubts about the veracity of the information received
  from some of the employees in Israel who manage the company’s relationship
  with the military. One of the sources familiar with internal conversations
  said executives had been unable to verify some of the information provided by
  staff in Israel, and had questioned whether employees may have felt more bound
  to their country’s military rather than to their employer. Using leaked
  Microsoft documents, the Guardian has identified several employees involved in
  managing projects with Unit 8200 who have previously shared online that they
  have served in or are reservists of the elite eavesdropping unit, which is
  equivalent in its remit to the US National Security Agency. Despite concerns
  raised by executives in recent days, the company has not yet launched the kind
  of formal review it conducted earlier this year into its work with the Israeli
  military. The review was prompted by reporting by the Guardian and others
  about Israel’s reliance on Microsoft technology during its Gaza offensive. A
  Microsoft spokesperson said the company “takes these allegations seriously, as
  shown by our previous independent investigation. As we receive new
  information, we’re committed to making sure we have a chance to validate any
  new data and take any needed action.” According to the leaked files reviewed
  by the Guardian, Microsoft – including senior executives – was aware Unit 8200
  planned to move large volumes of sensitive and classified intelligence data
  into Azure as the company began working with the unit in 2021 to add advanced
  security measures within the cloud platform. However, the company has insisted
  its executives were not aware Azure was being used by Unit 8200 to store the
  content of intercepted Palestinian calls. “We have no information related to
  the data stored in the customer’s cloud environment,” a spokesperson said
  earlier this week. In a statement issued by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF)
  after publication of the investigation, a spokesperson said: “We appreciate
  Microsoft’s support to protect our cybersecurity. We confirm that Microsoft is
  not and has not been working with the IDF on the storage or processing of
  data.” Several Microsoft sources said the IDF’s statement was viewed with
  surprise by the company’s leadership since it is not a secret it provides
  cloud storage to the military under contracts with Israel’s defence ministry.
  Following the revelations about Unit 8200’s reliance on Microsoft, a
  worker-led group, No Azure for Apartheid, issued a series of demands,
  including that the company cut off and “make all ties to the Israeli military
  publicly known”. Abdo Mohamed, an organizer with No Azure for Apartheid, who
  was fired by the company last year, said Microsoft’s chief executive, Satya
  Nadella, and other executives “claim they are unaware of how their company
  colluded with the Israeli regime to profit from Palestinian suffering while
  being the very ones who committed Microsoft to this partnership in 2021”.
