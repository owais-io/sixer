  If the heaviest bumps in football land on those least braced for them, then
  Chloe Molloy’s season-ending ACL injury knocked the Swans clean off their feet
  last year. It certainly had that effect on fans. Reports of the injury came in
  at a trickle, yet they could have been thunderclaps for how they reverberated
  around the fanbase. Many were already en route to the game, Sydney’s first in
  Melbourne for the season. Others were back home, frantically refreshing social
  feeds for updates. All were stunned silent. It’s not difficult to understand
  why. When Molloy arrived in Sydney the previous year, it was to a club fresh
  off the back of a winless inaugural season – not cause for panic, not yet, but
  surely a far cry from what the club would have wanted. Every other AFLW
  expansion team had stared down the same steep learning curve, but it was still
  a problem that demanded a solution. Enter Molloy. Her debut was swift and her
  impact immediate, booting the winning goal in the Swans’ first victory one
  round into their second season. Something visibly clicked into place for the
  young team, and they proceeded on a run so transformed that they qualified for
  finals. It would be remiss to pin this extraordinary turnaround on just one
  player, of course. The entire team was noticeably more cohesive in their
  second outing, much more mature, and they had been bolstered by a handful of
  other off-season acquisitions. Yet there was no denying the Molloy effect. To
  a market that had waited so long for a women’s team of their own, having a
  star player come in as captain and instantly court success was electrifying.
  It’s little wonder that losing her was so significant. On the field, the Swans
  struggled to regain their footing, and they registered just two further wins
  in the 2024 season. But for all that Molloy brings with her presence, it may
  be her absence that is most instructive. Coming into its 10th season, the AFLW
  is a competition perhaps best characterised by change. From conference systems
  and endless rule tweaks to season timing shifts, this league’s becoming has
  seen more fluctuations than steady ground. Success has come to depend upon a
  team’s ability to not just weather change, but to find a way to thrive within
  it – to embrace these challenges as opportunities. Take North Melbourne’s
  rampant 2024 campaign, winning a premiership on the heels of a lossless
  season. A simplistic reading might attribute their win streak solely to talent
  disparity across the league, but throughout nine seasons and three expansions,
  this was still just the first undefeated full season in AFLW history.
  Emphasising a talent gap does a disservice to all that this team has weathered
  along the journey. The list churn, the injuries, the Covid interruptions – to
  say nothing of last year’s hard-fought wins against worthy opponents. The
  Kangaroos have, however, been in the league since its first expansion in 2019.
  Longevity alone does not translate to AFLW success – four inaugural teams are
  yet to win a flag. But length of tenure grants teams more time and more
  opportunity to build a culture of resilience from the ground up. It exposes
  them to a greater variety of challenges, so that they might equip themselves
  with the tools to better withstand them in future. The Kangaroos’ time in this
  tumultuous competition shaped them into the seasoned leaders and players that
  took to the field last year. That kind of experience, that culture, struggles
  to be imported into teams – it must be both learned and earned. This year, now
  that each team has at least three seasons under their belts, perhaps we will
  see more of this learning on show. Hawthorn, another late entrant, will be
  looking to build on their steady progress, and once again put themselves in
  serious contention. West Coast will seek momentum through stringing some
  consecutive wins together. And after a handful of close losses saw them just
  miss finals, Geelong will surely aim to improve their finishing. For Sydney,
  much of their 2025 campaign still hinges on just how well Molloy bounces back
  from injury. But their biggest test will come in how the team utilises what
  they’ve built throughout her absence. How they can capitalise on confidence
  gained, and how the leadership forged can improve upon the foundations already
  laid. Because the beauty of this league is in watching teams work it out for
  themselves – week by week, step by promising step. Maybe the next bump still
  bowls the Swans over. But maybe this time, better braced for it, climbing to
  their feet will be far easier.
