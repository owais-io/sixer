  I am pleased that Richard Tice enjoys the church and believes in God (Richard
  Tice hits back at C of E criticism of Reform immigration policy, 31 August)
  but I would advise him to read his Bible a little more carefully. If he did so
  he would discover that those of faith are continually reminded to “show
  hospitality to strangers” (Hebrews 13:2) and “to provide the poor wanderer
  with shelter” (Isaiah 58:7). There are at least 30 verses in the Bible that
  encourage us to look after those seeking refuge. The problem Mr Tice faces is
  that the Bible is a very political book. It being so, he cannot be surprised
  that our archbishop is commenting on his party’s plans to deport asylum
  seekers who arrive in small boats. As Christians, we are called to love each
  other and to offer help to those who are suffering. I would be happy to
  welcome Mr Tice to our church should he wish to learn more about the Christian
  faith. Rev Richard Stainer Bradfield St George, Suffolk • The archbishop of
  York is right to call Reform UK’s immigration proposals short-term and
  isolationist. But words aren’t enough – the church must offer practical
  alternatives. One possibility is staring us in the face: our half-empty
  churches and cathedrals. These buildings have vast unused space, often with
  soaring ceilings. With modular pods or mezzanine units, living quarters could
  be installed above while worship continues below. This would reduce reliance
  on hotels (saving the taxpayer millions), provide dignified accommodation and
  give historic buildings a renewed community purpose. Above all, it would
  embody the Christian principle of sanctuary in a way that is visible,
  practical and desperately needed. Sal Mansfield Pill, Somerset • Have an
  opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today? Please email us your
