webTitle: Lost Lear review – Shakespeare’s king holds court in a care home
sectionName: Stage

bodyText: >-
  A play remains a classic for as long as it continues to yield new meanings.
  Shakespeare’s King Lear, for example, remains open to interpretation. Its
  story of a retiring king bequeathing his lands to his daughters before
  descending into madness can, in the right hands, engage with many themes in
  the modern day including dementia. It was not really necessary for
  writer-director Dan Colley to construct a whole new play about it, but that is
  what the Irish theatre-maker has done in Lost Lear. Venetia Bowe plays a
  retired actor, now resident in a care home, whose memory has faded in every
  respect apart from a word-perfect recall of Shakespeare’s play. To keep her
  relaxed, the staff take on the parts of Goneril, Regan, Cordelia and the Fool
  as she loops repeatedly through her favourite scenes of parental regret. The
  idea recalls Enda Walsh’s The Walworth Farce, in which a family protect
  themselves from the outside world by endlessly performing a shaky comedy, and
  it has a similar interest in mental decline. The difficulty with plays on this
  theme is that dementia is a mental state, not a dramatic question. You can
  evoke the dislocation it creates, as well as the sense of loss and frustration
  it leaves for loved ones, but you cannot resolve it. In a classy production,
  Lost Lear evokes it well. Joined by Peter Daly, Manus Halligan, Em Ormonde and
  Clodagh O’Farrell on Andrew Clancy’s institutional set, Bowe is the youthful
  woman trapped in an elderly body that we see only as the show progresses.
  First, we know her for her exacting standards, her brusque disregard for
  anyone but herself and her facility with language. Only later do we see her as
  a fragile old woman. Nothing can change, but the play has a sentimental
  appeal. At the Traverse, Edinburgh, until 24 August All our Edinburgh festival
