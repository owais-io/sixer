  Domino’s Pizza said the takeaway market had “become tougher” as it blamed
  weaker consumer confidence in the run-up to the autumn budget and rising wage
  costs for lower-than-expected sales and a slump in profits. After a drop of
  nearly 15% in half-year profits, the company now expected full-year underlying
  profits of between £130m and £140m, about £6m below analysts’ expectations.
  Domino’s said it was gaining market share but its franchise partners were
  being more cautious about opening new outlets because of higher employment
  costs. Employers’ national insurance payments and the legal minimum wage were
  both increased in April. The company opened 11 stores in the six months to the
  end of June, fewer than expected, and is now forecasting openings in the
  mid-20s for the full year. In April it said it hoped to open “in excess of 50
  new stores”. Andrew Rennie, the chief executive of Domino’s, said: “There’s no
  getting away from the fact that the market has become tougher both for us and
  our franchisees, and that’s meant that the positive performance across the
  first four months didn’t continue into May and June. “Given weaker consumer
  confidence, increased employment costs and uncertainty ahead of the autumn
  statement, franchisees are taking a more cautious approach to store openings
  for the time being.” He said the group was looking at more automation to help
  to keep costs down. Shares in the UK-listed group slid more than 13% in
  morning trading on Tuesday as it reported flat total order numbers in the
  first six months. Underlying sales dipped 0.1% as it struggled to beat the
  strong sales last year during the men’s Euro 2024 football tournament.
  Underlying pre-tax profits fell from £51.3m to £43.7m as system sales, which
  include total sales made at franchise outlets and new outlets opened during
  the year, rose 1.3% to £778m. The poor performance at Domino’s follows similar
  difficulties at the bakery specialist Greggs, which reported a 14% fall in
  half-year profits last week amid weaker-than-hoped-for sales. It said profits
  had been hit as consumers shunned pastry bakes and hot food in favour of cold
  drinks during the hot weather. The rival pizza franchise Papa Johns has also
  closed more than 70 outlets, and Pizza Hut’s 140 restaurants were rescued from
  insolvency in January. Katie Cousins, an equity analyst at Shore Capital,
  said: “We note ongoing headwinds from low consumer confidence and slowing
  income tracker data, particularly for [those on low income], along with
  potential impacts of weight-loss injections on the sector.” Mark Crouch, a
  market analyst for eToro, added: “Despite [Domino’s] revenue growing and
  higher like-for-like sales, profits have dropped sharply, and store openings
  have slowed, a troubling combination for a growth-focused franchise model. “If
  fast affordable food is feeling the pinch, what does that say about the
  broader consumer landscape? Investors may see a resilient brand, but the
  numbers point to structural headwinds that go beyond pizza.”
