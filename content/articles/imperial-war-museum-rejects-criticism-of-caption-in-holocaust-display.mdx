  The Imperial War Museum has declined to change an information board in its
  Holocaust Galleries that two eminent historians say is incorrect. The
  information board refers to the Nuremberg race laws passed by the Nazi regime
  in Germany in 1935, which included a definition of who was Jewish. The laws
  said anyone with three or four Jewish grandparents was a Jew and anyone with
  one or two Jewish grandparents was Mischlinge, or mixed race. The IWM’s
  information board states that, under the provision of the law, “a person was
  defined as Jewish based on how many observant Jewish grandparents they had”.
  The inclusion of the word “observant” raised concerns for a retired academic
  from New York who was visiting the Holocaust Galleries in London last year.
  She wrote to the IWM saying the “wording referring to observant Jewish
  grandparents with its lack of historical accuracy must be changed”. The former
  academic, who asked not to be named, said she had been “extraordinarily
  impressed” with the material displayed at the galleries. “Then I came to the
  race laws, and I know that ‘observant’ Jewish grandparents just made no sense.
  It disregards the vast majority of the Jewish population who are not
  observant,” she told the Guardian. The Nazis were intent on eradicating all
  Jews, regardless of whether they were observant or not, she said. “This is
  such a misleading impression of the Nazi outlook that for me it’s
  reprehensible that it stays in the public domain.” Caro Howell, the IWM’s
  director general, told the former academic that “full and sincere
  consideration” had been given to the points she had raised “but we stand by
  the curatorial choices that we have made and that our expert advisers have
  reviewed”. In an email seen by the Guardian, Howell said the integrity of the
  IWM would be undermined if it made changes every time “questions of
  interpretative nuance” were raised. The retired academic sought the views of
  two highly regarded Holocaust historians. Christopher Browning, who has
  written numerous books on the Holocaust and was an expert witness in the David
  Irving libel trial in 2000, said: “The issue was not whether the grandparent
  was observant but whether his or her birth had been registered with the Jewish
  community. The grandparent could later even have converted to Christianity but
  if the grandparent had been registered as Jewish at birth, that for the Nazis
  was the deciding factor.” Timothy Snyder, who has also written extensively
  about the Nazis, said: “It did not matter whether the grandparents were
  observant … No one was saved from persecution, as the wording incorrectly
  implies, by having grandparents who were not observant.” He added: “As worded,
  the suggestion is that ‘bad Jews’, ie those with a secular (or even Reform)
  background, might have been spared from the persecutions that preceded the
  Holocaust, whereas ‘good Jews’, those with religious (or Orthodox)
  backgrounds, were the victims. This is nonsense.” Browning and Snyder have not
  contacted the IWM directly but the former academic forwarded their comments to
  the museum. In response, Howell told the former academic that she was “unable
  to engage in any further correspondence” and that pursuit of the issue “risks
  sowing division among people who really should pull together”. The IWM is
  understood to believe that other information displayed in the Holocaust
  Galleries makes it clear that the Nazis persecuted all Jews regardless of
  their religious practice. A spokesperson for the museum said: “IWM takes
  comments regarding our interpretation very seriously and we acknowledge the
  points made and the sensitivities regarding this caption. “It is inevitable
  that, in a history as complex – and sometimes contested – as the Holocaust,
  questions of interpretation and nuance will be raised by audiences from time
  to time. The [information board] was rigorously reviewed and edited by IWM’s
  curators, a number of leading international scholars and members of Jewish
  communities before being printed.”
