  A ban on housing asylum seekers at a protest-hit hotel would have a “serious
  impact” on the government’s ability to house refugees and could incite further
  demonstrations, the court of appeal has heard. The Home Office and the owners
  of the Bell hotel in Essex have launched an appeal against the temporary
  injunction granted to Epping Forest district council (EFDC) last week. They
  are seeking to challenge a high court ruling that will stop 138 asylum seekers
  from being housed there beyond 12 September. Three senior judges will make a
  ruling on Friday. The Bell hotel has been in the public eye in recent weeks
  after an asylum seeker housed there was charged with sexually assaulting a
  teenage girl last month, leading to a string of protests and
  counter-demonstrations. Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu is on trial this week and
  denies the offence. Last week, Mr Justice Eyre granted EFDC the interim
  injunction after the authority claimed that Somani Hotels had breached
  planning rules. But on Thursday, the Home Office and Somani Hotels argued the
  council had effectively conceded that the application was “only ever about
  protest”. The court heard EFDC had known for years that the hotel could have
  been in breach of planning regulations, but had not taken enforcement action
  against Somani Hotels because the situation had been “unproblematic”. Robin
  Green, representing the authority, said: “A decision not to take enforcement
  action at one point in time does not mean it cannot take a different decision
  at a later point in time if circumstances change. On the evidence,
  circumstances had undoubtedly changed.” The hotel has housed single adult male
  asylum seekers since April 2025, and from October 2022 to April 2024. It had
  also accommodated asylum seekers from May 2020 to March 2021. On behalf of the
  Home Office, Edward Brown KC said the statement amounted to an admission on
  the part of the council that the planning decision had really been about
  putting an end to the protests. He said: “Epping has effectively conceded
  before this court that this was, in truth, only ever about protest.” Brown
  said the interim injunction was “simply the wrong tool” for stopping asylum
  hotel demonstrations. Somani Hotels’ lawyer Piers Riley-Smith told Lord
  Justice Bean, sitting with Lady Justice Nicola Davies and Lord Justice Cobb on
  Thursday, there were “other and more appropriate” solutions to the council’s
  concerns. In evidence referenced during Thursday’s hearing, a senior Home
  Office official said the interim injunction would risk “encouraging other
  local authorities” to seek similar measures. The statement read: “The Home
  Office understands that local residents have concerns about the use of the
  hotel, which have been heard. However, those concerns must be viewed in the
  context of demands on the accommodation estate. “Granting the interim
  injunction sought risks setting a precedent which would have a serious impact
  on the secretary of state’s ability to house vulnerable people; both by
  encouraging other local authorities to seek such interim injunctions pending
  the outcome of substantive planning law complaints and those who seek to
  target asylum accommodation in acts of public disorder.” The Home Office’s
  director of asylum support, Becca Jones, said the loss of 152 bed spaces at
  the Bell hotel would be a major issue. “In this context, and at this time, the
  loss of 152 bed spaces is significant when considering the Home Office’s legal
  duty to house people who would otherwise be destitute,” she said. “The
  availability of the hotel is also important in enabling the secretary of state
  to meet her duty to accommodate future asylum seekers going forward, in
  circumstances where the pressure on available properties is significant and
  increasing.” Alongside the challenge to the interim injunction, the government
  is also seeking to appeal against Mr Justice Eyre’s decision not to allow it
  to intervene in the case. The council opposed the appeal bids.
