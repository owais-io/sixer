  David Lammy will tell MPs on Monday that the UK still intends to recognise a
  Palestinian state in September, with Israel having shown no sign of meeting
  the government’s demands. The foreign secretary will say in a Commons
  statement that government officials intend to carry out a formal assessment in
  the coming days of whether Israel has complied with the tests set out by the
  prime minister, Keir Starmer. But with Benjamin Netanyahu’s government
  continuing to harden its position on Gaza and the West Bank, the foreign
  secretary will confirm that Britain still plans to recognise Palestine. A UK
  official said: “We will assess all the factors relevant to recognition, but as
  things stand we’re on a pathway to recognition later in September.” Starmer
  said earlier in August that the UK would recognise Palestine before the UN
  general assembly, which starts on 9 September, unless Israel met a series of
  preconditions. The prime minister made his statement after conversations with
  the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and the French president, Emmanuel
  Macron. The latter has said France intends to recognise Palestine at the UN
  meeting. Starmer also spoke to Donald Trump before announcing his decision.
  The US president indicated the US would not object to such a move, but British
  officials are worried that his administration might retaliate by recognising
  Israeli jurisdiction over illegal settlements in the West Bank. Starmer’s
  conditions for Israel include taking “substantive steps” to end the war in
  Gaza, agreeing a ceasefire and committing not to annex parts of the West Bank.
  Far from taking steps towards satisfying any of those demands, however,
  Netanyahu has shown signs of violating them further. Reuters reported that
  Israel was considering annexation in the West Bank if France, the UK and other
  countries push ahead with recognising Palestine. Israeli officials said the
  subject was on the agenda for Netanyahu’s cabinet meeting on Sunday, but would
  not say where or when annexation could happen. The Foreign Office has just
  over a week to complete its formal assessment of Israel’s position. Senior
  government officials say the timing of the British recognition is being driven
  less by that process and more by diplomatic concerns that the government
  should be seen to be acting in concert with France. Lammy said on Sunday that
  the humanitarian situation in Gaza, where UN-backed experts recently declared
  a famine, was a “man-made catastrophe” caused by Israel’s refusal to let in
  aid deliveries. The UN panel said more than half a million people were living
  in famine conditions, which were likely to spread further in coming weeks.
  Lammy said in a statement: “The humanitarian situation in Gaza remains
  catastrophic, with famine in Gaza City and women and girls bearing the brunt
  of the suffering. “The UK is doing all we can to improve the situation but we
  remain crystal clear: for aid to have impact, Israel must ensure it is allowed
  in and delivered safely and securely to civilians in desperate need.” The
  government also announced an extra £3m on Sunday to provide midwives and
  emergency medical supplies for new mothers in Gaza, but it said the aid would
  only reach the people who needed it if Israel allowed much greater
  humanitarian access to the region. Lammy said: “This funding can only have
  maximum impact if the government of Israel allows it. “Israel must ensure
  protection of civilians including healthcare staff and health infrastructure,
  and enable the delivery of life-saving medicines, medical equipment and
  healthcare supplies into Gaza.”
