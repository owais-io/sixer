  Tim Key: Loganberry review – blissfully funny set from a standup in total
  control
sectionName: Stage

bodyText: >-
  It’s rich of Tim Key, his agent tells him, playing the underdog “when you’re
  lighting up cinemas with Carey Mulligan”. But play the underdog he does in
  Loganberry, his exquisitely tart and amusing take on that standup staple, the
  midlife crisis show. Other comics invite you to take seriously their
  existential wrestle with ageing and insignificance. Key’s is a game of
  cat-and-mouse, a twinkling ironic tease inviting us to wonder how lonely,
  furious, insecure – and indeed how old – this acclaimed comedian, actor and
  film-maker really is. The trigger for this descent into forty- (or is it
  thirty-) something angst is an invitation from his recent House of Games
  opponent, sports presenter Gabby Logan, on to her podcast about middle age.
  Key is outraged at the implication, retreating from the microphone – as he
  does throughout the show – to bellow at the rough justice he receives
  (“Where’s my MBE? Everything I do is for this fucking empire!”) from life, the
  world and his uncomprehending public. In trademark rumpled suit and greying
  hair (sorry, Tim!), he prowls the stage, circling questions of age,
  self-worth, his celebrity status and singleton life. Structure is provided by
  an account of time spent in a cafe, struggling to write another “58-minute
  concert” for his demanding fans. Greg Rusedski pops in, sending Key into
  raptures (“Full tennis WHITES!”). The red-and-white checked tablecloths prompt
  rueful reflection on our host’s hobo-like, “stick-and-bindle” life on the
  road. If midlife brings few consolations, one must be Key’s total command of
  his unique style. The scrambled signifiers of high and low status; the
  smiling, ever-so-faintly sinister relationship with his crowd; the ambient
  background music – and all those banal/beautiful haiku (“Colette gave birth to
  an adult …”) that again punctuate this set. Key has them all where he wants
  them, while ensuring we never quite do – and part of the fun is unpicking
  precisely what he’s up to while he’s making us laugh and laugh, at tales of
  freezing his sperm, measuring himself against his parents, failing to be cast
  in Ted Lasso. He may be lighting up cinemas, but here Key casts playful
  shadows over that glamorous public life, in blissfully funny fashion. • At
  Pleasance Courtyard and Pleasance Dome, Edinburgh, until 24 August. Then at
  Wilton’s Music Hall, London, 10-22 November • All our Edinburgh festival
