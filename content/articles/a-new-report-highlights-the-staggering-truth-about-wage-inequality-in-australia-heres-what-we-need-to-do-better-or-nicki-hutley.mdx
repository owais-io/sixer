  The concept of a “fair go” is quintessentially Australian. Yet it appears that
  our ideas about equality in this country may be increasingly ill-founded, with
  far-reaching implications. A new report looking at the gap between beliefs and
  reality concerning wage inequality in a number of countries found that
  Australians significantly underestimate the number of people with
  lower-than-average earnings and overestimate how many earn in the top 30%.
  Their beliefs about what is occurring tend to mirror what they think should be
  the case rather than what is. The report also showed that we grossly
  underestimate just how much the big end of town out-earns the rest of us, with
  survey respondents thinking CEOs (of publicly listed companies) typically
  earned 7.1 times an average full-time salary. In fact the figure is a
  staggering 103 times! This is not purely an Australian phenomenon and we
  should spare a thought for the British and the Americans, where chief
  executives typically earn a mind-boggling 214 and 269 times the average
  person, respectively. And it’s not just the blokes (four out of five CEOs are
  men) in the big corner offices contributing to income inequality. The sexily
  named Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey for 2025 –
  Hilda – showed economic inequality is now at the highest level since the
  survey began in 2001. Highest incomes are now growing faster than middle
  incomes, which in turn are growing faster than the lowest incomes, raising the
  barriers to improve one’s lot in life. Then, of course, there are those who
  are living below the poverty line on jobseeker and similar payments. That
  successive governments from both sides of the aisle can think that this
  situation is OK is, to me, abhorrent. The antiquated idea of the “dole
  bludger” is in no way consistent with reality. However, income is just one
  dimension of inequality. Gender is another area where this plays out in
  multiple dimensions. The Financy Women’s Index tells us that, even if we
  maintain progress in narrowing the gender pay gap, we are still almost two
  decades away from equal pay. More concerningly, perhaps, there is a
  four-decade wait to close the gap on the imbalance between men and women when
  it comes to unpaid work. Women have less representation in offices and
  boardrooms, higher rates of unemployment and underemployment, and lower super
  balances when they retire. Until we can address issues including tertiary
  subject selection, unpaid work, workplace flexibility, universal childcare and
  so on, gender inequality will persist. Australia is a lucky country for many,
  with enviable living standards. But our wealth is not shared equally and
  inequality expresses itself across so many dimensions of our economy and
  society. Last week I wrote of the disadvantages now facing Australians in
  their 30s in terms of earnings, housing affordability, budget burden and
  climate impacts. Those dimensions of disadvantage also disproportionately
  affect First Nations Australians, LGBTQI people, those with a disability,
  those from culturally and linguistically different backgrounds, as well as
  those who live in our regions. The list is sadly a long one. The Global Social
  Progress Index is another a measure of just how far behind some cohorts are.
  In 2024 Australia ranked an impressive 12 out of 170 countries overall,
  suggesting we are addressing disadvantage well (although we slipped from
  eighth place the previous year). Yet, on a number of individual measures, we
  rank poorly considering the overall wealth of our nation. For example, we rank
  90th on a diet low in fruit and vegetables, 50th for access to basic education
  and 40th for access to quality healthcare. Perhaps less surprising, we rank a
  miserable 133rd on satisfaction with housing affordability. We know this
  disadvantage appears unequally across Australia. Despite our understanding of
  the critical importance of these economic, health, education and other social
  outcomes, governments of all stripes at state and federal levels continue to
  underinvest. If you’re still reading, by now you may be feeling that Australia
  seems a pretty poor excuse for a country. That is not my point. In fact,
  Australia does incredibly well on so many fronts. The Social Progress Index
  has us ranked first on quite a number of measures, well ahead of our GDP
  per-capita ranking of 16, including on access to electricity, household air
  pollution, gender parity in secondary education attainment and basic
  sanitation services. Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide all rank in the world’s
  top 10 most livable cities. And, despite much public discourse about
  intergenerational inequality, the Productivity Commission estimates that our
  parents’ income is far less of a determinant of our own potential earnings
  than in most other countries, including in Scandinavia. The point, rather, is
  that Australia is a very wealthy country with relatively low levels of
  government debt and well-developed institutions. This makes it harder to
  tolerate the evidence of inequality and disadvantage. Last week at the
  economic roundtable there was a lot of talk about growing the economic pie. We
  now need to take the substantial resources at our disposal and use them to
  better effect, to ensure we distribute that pie in better ways and do not let
  rising inequality become the norm. • Nicki Hutley is an independent economist
