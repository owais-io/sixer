  Donald Trump has said he is firing the Federal Reserve governor, Lisa Cook,
  over allegations she committed mortgage fraud, in an extraordinary move that
  marks the latest escalation in the US president’s attack on the central bank’s
  independence. Trump wrote to Cook on Monday, telling her that he was removing
  her from her position “effective immediately”, based on the allegation from
  one of his allies that she had obtained a mortgage on a second home she
  incorrectly described as her primary residence. Cook responded several hours
  later in a statement emailed to reporters through the law office of the lawyer
  Abbe Lowell, saying of Trump that “no cause exists under the law, and he has
  no authority” to remove her from the job to which she was appointed by Joe
  Biden in 2022. She said: “I will continue to carry out my duties to help the
  American economy.“ Lowell said Trump’s “demands lacked any proper process,
  basis or legal authority”, adding: “We will take whatever actions are needed
  to prevent his attempted illegal action.” Trump posted the full text of the
  letter on social media on Monday night. In it, he said that he found
  “sufficient cause” in the allegation against her to remove her from her
  position. Cook’s exit would allow Trump to tap a replacement, helping him to
  exert more control over Fed policy. His demands for lower interest rates have
  so far fallen on closed ears. The Trump administration has pursued several of
  the president’s political enemies, including the New York attorney general,
  Letitia James, and the California senator Adam Schiff, over claims of mortgage
  fraud. Both James and Schiff denied the allegations. Cook is not a politician,
  but is among a string of senior Fed policymakers who have defied Trump’s
  persistent calls for rate cuts. She became the first Black woman to sit on the
  central bank’s board when she was appointed to a term on the Fed’s board that
  was not due to end until 2038. A respected economist, with stints at Harvard
  University and Stanford University, Cook served on the council of economic
  advisers under Barack Obama. In May, the US supreme court suggested the
  president did not have power to fire, without cause, governors of the US
  central bank – an independent agency whose members do not serve at the
  pleasure of the president. The administration’s attack on Cook’s future at the
  Fed was led by Bill Pulte, a Trump-appointed official leading the US Federal
  Housing Finance Agency, who alleged she had claimed two different properties
  were her primary residences when obtaining mortgages in 2021. “How can this
  woman be in charge of interest rates if she is allegedly lying to help her own
  interest rates?” Pulte wrote on X, formerly Twitter. He referred the case to
  the Department of Justice for investigation. Trump seized on the claims before
  Cook had responded, writing on Wednesday on Truth Social, his social network,
  that she “must resign, now!!!”. The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer,
  criticised Trump’s move against Cook. “Donald Trump is playing a dangerous
  game of Jenga with a key pillar of our economy,” he said. “This brazen power
  grab must be stopped by the courts before Trump does permanent damage to
  national, state and local economies. And if the economy comes crashing down,
  if families lose their savings and Main Street pays the price, Donald Trump
  will own every ounce of the wreckage and devastation families feel.” The Fed
  chair, Jerome Powell, signaled on Friday that the Fed was gearing up to start
  cutting interest rates as soon next month, but reiterated warnings about the
  potential risks posed by Trump’s policies, including sweeping tariffs and an
  immigration crackdown, on the economy. “This year, the economy has faced new
  challenges. Significantly higher tariffs across our trading partners are
  remaking the global system,” Powell said in a closely scrutinized speech to
  other central bankers gathered in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. “Tighter immigration
  policy has led to an abrupt slowdown in labor force growth.” Top Democratic
  lawmakers furiously denounced Trump’s attempt to fire Cook. Elizabeth Warren,
  a Massachusetts senator and ranking member on the Senate banking, housing, and
  urban affairs committee, called it “the latest example of a desperate
  president searching for a scapegoat to cover for his own failure to lower
  costs for Americans”. “It’s an authoritarian power grab that blatantly
  violates the Federal Reserve Act, and must be overturned in court,” Warren
  said. Economists and experts also decried the move, warning that the
  ramifications of her attempted firing could reach Americans’ pocketbooks.
  Rohit Chopra, the former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
  under Joe Biden, accused the White House of seeking to “transform the
  financial regulators from independent watchdogs into obedient lapdogs that do
  as they’re told”. “Wrecking institutions with unlawful behavior and pathetic
  power grabs come with costs to Americans,” said Skanda Amarnath, the executive
  director of Employ America and a former Fed economist. “The dollar continues
  to weaken as American governance continues to erode. That means higher prices
  for all commodities. Chair Powell must ensure that Lisa Cook is not removed as
  a result of these arbitrary and capricious actions from the president.”
