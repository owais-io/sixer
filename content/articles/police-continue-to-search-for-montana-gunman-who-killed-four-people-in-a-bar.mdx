  Authorities continued to search Saturday afternoon for the man accused of
  killing four people at a Montana bar. Local, state and federal law enforcement
  were looking for 45-year-old Michael Paul Brown, a US army veteran who lived
  in a small town, Anaconda, next to The Owl Bar, where on Friday morning he
  allegedly opened fire and killed a bartender and three patrons. Officials
  located Brown’s abandoned white truck according to Lee Johnson, Montana
  division of criminal investigation administrator. They concentrated their
  search in the mountains west of Anaconda, a town of less than 10,000 residents
  that was centered around a copper processing facility. “This is a small,
  tight-knit community that has been harmed by the heinous actions of one
  individual who does not represent what this community or Montanans stand for,”
  Johnson said. On Friday night, nearby residents were encouraged to stay inside
  their homes and be on high alert as law enforcement believed Brown was armed
  and dangerous, Johnson said. But on Saturday afternoon, Bill Sather, the
  Anaconda-Deer Lodge police chief, told residents it was “OK to go about your
  business in town” but to use caution and report anything suspicious to law
  enforcement. Authorities released a photo of Brown, who is 5ft 10in tall;
  weighs about 170lbs; and has blue eyes and brown hair, according to USA Today.
  The FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were
  assisting local and state police with the search, according to posts on X. As
  of Saturday afternoon, law enforcement had not released the names of the
  victims. Brown served in the US army as an armor crewman from 2001 to 2005 and
  was deployed to Iraq from early 2004 until March 2005, according to an army
  spokesperson. He was in the Montana national guard from 2006 to March 2009 and
  left military service in the rank of sergeant. “This isn’t just a drunk/high
  man going wild,” Brown’s niece, Clare Boyle, wrote in a Facebook message to
  the Associated Press. “It’s a sick man who doesn’t know who he is sometimes
  and frequently doesn’t know where or when he is either.” Montana ranked second
  worst in the country in terms of prevalence of mental illness and access to
  care, according to the non-profit Mental Health America. Two-thirds of adults
  in Montana also lived in homes with guns, the highest rate in the country,
  according to a 2016 study from RAND, a thinktank. The owner of the Firefly
  Café in Anaconda told the Associated Press that she locked up her business
  after a friend alerted her to the shooting. “We are Montana, so guns are not
  new to us,” Barbie Nelson said. “For our town to be locked down, everybody’s
  pretty rattled.” Associated Press contributed reporting
