  The Guardian view on Zack Polanski’s rise: he wants to replace Labour, not
  work with it | Editorial

  Zack Polanski’s landslide election as leader of the Green party marks a
  turning point for Britain’s fractured left. Young, rhetorically fluent and
  unafraid to cloak climate arguments in those about class, Mr Polanski is
  nothing if not ambitious. He sees his party not as a parliamentary pressure
  group but as a replacement for Labour itself. His ascent might have seemed
  fanciful last July when Labour had just won a thumping majority. Yet Labour
  languishes in the polls. Sir Keir Starmer’s personal ratings have collapsed.
  On the extreme right Reform UK now boasts 237,000 members, 870 councillors,
  and 10 councils under its control. The Greens have more MPs than ever before.
  And the uneasy leadership team of Jeremy Corbyn and Zara Sultana is preparing
  to launch a new party to Labour’s left. This is no longer political noise at
  the margins. This is about the structural failure of leadership at the centre.
  Sir Keir’s attempt to anchor Labour as a party of managerialism has created an
  ideological vacuum. He has offered no moral project, no radical agenda, no
  post-crisis settlement. In response to Nigel Farage’s rise, he has chosen not
  to confront the Reform UK leader’s rhetoric but to adopt it as his own,
  notably refusing to challenge the scapegoating of migrants. The consequence is
  that Reform has increasingly come to own the debate around immigration and
  national identity. And on the left, Mr Polanski and the Corbyn-Sultana project
  see their chance. Both seem open to cooperating. Both have the same analysis –
  what they consider to be Starmer’s vacuous centrism – but offer slightly
  different solutions. Mr Polanski speaks of a climate-anchored politics rooted
  in solidarity with workers and migrants. Mr Corbyn brings anti-imperialism and
  name recognition; Ms Sultana brings radical identity politics. These
  insurgents claim to represent the 99%. They appeal to younger, disillusioned
  voters and are building parallel movements. The paradox is that while
  Britain’s left is surging it remains splintered. Mr Polanski calls for an
  “intellectual coalition” rather than an electoral one – a reminder that one
  has to win the battle of ideas before being able to win power. The Greens took
  second place in 40 Westminster seats at the last election. Mr Corbyn is
  already drawing thousands to public meetings. Yet both risk mimicking Reform’s
  effect on the right: successful enough to weaken Labour, but not presently
  coherent enough to win power. More than one in five voters say they’d consider
  backing a new leftwing party. While Mr Polanski appeals beyond the Greens, the
  Corbyn ally James Schneider calls for a deeper break with Labourism and
  electoralism. He suggests a left project that unites the dispossessed –
  low-paid workers, precarious graduates and racialised communities – through
  grassroots organising and alternative models of government rooted in agency,
  not just representation. Sir Keir’s retreat into economic orthodoxy and
  cautious incrementalism has allowed insurgents, most obviously on the right,
  to set the terms of debate. He now faces a left rebelling not just against
  injustice but Labour’s growing irrelevance. Crucially, a new form of mass
  politics has given rise to movements – from Palestinian solidarity to climate
  activism to anti-austerity – that the Labour leadership refuse to assimilate.
  Labour’s defence of an old order that is crumbling away has only helped Mr
  Polanski. Unless Sir Keir reclaims the narrative terrain and offers
  transformative policies – and fast – British politics will not see only
  realignment but rupture. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this
