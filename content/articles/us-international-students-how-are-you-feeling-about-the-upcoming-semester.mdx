  Harvard University is in court against the Trump administration, fighting
  federal attempts to end international student enrolment at the university and
  challenging the federal freeze on research funds. In May, international
  students at Harvard were ordered to transfer schools or lose their legal
  status. While that order was swiftly blocked by a judge, it is one of a series
  of events creating uncertainty on campuses across the US. We would like to
  hear from international students who are new, or returning, on how they feel
  about the upcoming academic year. Are you approaching this semester
  differently than you have before? If you are a freshman, what, if anything,
  have you done to prepare? If you’re having trouble using the form click here.
