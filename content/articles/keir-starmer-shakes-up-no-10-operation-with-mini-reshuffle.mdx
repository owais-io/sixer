  Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury, has been moved to a new
  senior role in Downing Street as Keir Starmer attempts to get a grip on
  delivery before what is likely to be a tumultuous autumn for the government,
  the Guardian understands. The senior MP, whose new title will be chief
  secretary to the prime minster, has been put in charge of day-to-day delivery
  of the prime minister’s priorities after No 10 spent the summer struggling to
  get on the front foot on issues including the economy and migration, and lags
  behind Reform UK in the polls. He will be replaced as Rachel Reeves’s deputy
  by James Murray, who has been promoted from exchequer secretary, a more junior
  ministerial role at the Treasury. In turn, his role will be taken by Dan
  Tomlinson, the government’s “growth mission champion”, as Starmer seeks to
  reward the new 2024 intake. However, there was not expected to be a wider
  reshuffle of the junior ministerial ranks at this point despite some reports,
  senior sources said, although Starmer would need to appoint a new homelessness
  minister after Rushanara Ali stood down this summer. The cabinet is to stay
  intact. Downing Street is also expected to confirm that the former Bank of
  England deputy governor Minouche Shafik will become Starmer’s chief economic
  adviser, as the government seeks to strengthen its efforts to bolster UK
  growth and productivity. The communications operation will also be shaken up
  with Tim Allan, an adviser to Tony Blair in No 10 who went on to fund the PR
  firm Portland, coming in as executive director of government communications.
  The political role is separate from that of David Dinsmore, who has been
  tasked with improving the civil service communications operation. James Lyons,
  Downing Street’s director of communications for strategy, is stepping down.
  Steph Driver, his counterpart for day-to-day No 10 communications, who is
  close to Starmer, stays in post, answering to Allan. The Downing Street policy
  unit is also undergoing changes, after some internal conflict over who was
  running the department. Liz Lloyd, who was Tony Blair’s deputy chief of staff
  at No 10, is leaving but is expected to move to a new role in government.
  Stuart Ingham, another policy chief and Starmer’s most longstanding aide, will
  leave the unit to work in chief of staff Morgan McSweeney’s team, taking on a
  more political role, which sources said would ensure the prime minister’s
  priorities were taken into account in every decision. A new political policy
  chief is expected to be appointed shortly, but in the meantime Vidhya
  Alakeson, one of McSweeney’s deputies, will oversee day-to-day policy work.
  Sources suggested that Louise Casey, a senior government fixer, would not be
  coming into No 10 despite reports. The extent of the shake-up reflects the
  sense that Starmer’s No 10 has increasingly struggled to impose its own
  narrative, and is instead mainly being shaken by external crises, notably the
  focus over the summer on migration, and Reform UK’s planned response to it.
  Things are not likely to improve in the short term, with the return of
  parliament presenting Starmer and his team with a series of tough challenges,
  including the likely need for tax rises in this autumn’s budget and ongoing
  legal battles over asylum hotels. Downing Street sources characterised the
  changes as the next step in the government’s rewiring of Whitehall, with No 10
  evolving into a “command and control” operation. They acknowledged that
  Jones’s appointment and the new structures were about increasing government
  grip and focus. Jones’s appointment is likely to be seen as an acknowledgment
  by the prime minister that he needs to take a bolder approach to delivering on
  his promises, with the Bristol North West MP seen as a Blairite-style reformer
  who has privately urged the government to be more radical. The shake-up in the
  communications team is in part a reflection of a summer in which Nigel Farage
  has dominated the political agenda, although Lyons had never envisaged working
  in Downing Street for a long period. Appointed director of strategic
  communications last October, Lyons is an experienced former print journalist
  who became communications chief for the NHS before moving to the Chinese-owned
  social media company TikTok. Announcing his departure to government advisers
  on Monday morning, Lyons said the job was “never intended as a long haul” and
  that he had decided over the summer that he would seek to leave by the end of
  the year, with the timetable shifted because of the wider internal changes. It
  comes a month after the former Sun editor David Dinsmore was announced as the
  government’s new communications chief, a civil service role. Dinsmore’s
  appointment as permanent secretary for communications in the Cabinet Office, a
  job he begins in November, came despite concerns about his long service at the
  top of Rupert Murdoch’s News UK. The ongoing shake-up inside No 10 began last
  week with the news that Nin Pandit, Starmer’s top civil service aide, is to
  leave her role after less than 10 months. Sources at No 10 denied she had quit
  and said she would step into a new policy delivery role and the prime minister
  would now take more direct control of delivery. Pandit will be replaced by Dan
  York-Smith as Starmer’s principal private secretary.
