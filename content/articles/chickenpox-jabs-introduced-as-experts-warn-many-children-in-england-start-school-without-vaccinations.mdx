  school without vaccinations

  England needs to “wake up” to its faltering infant vaccination programme,
  experts have warned, as it was revealed that one in five children start
  primary school unprotected from serious infectious diseases. It comes as the
  government announces a new vaccination programme for chickenpox from January,
  meaning that GPs will offer eligible children a combined vaccine for measles,
  mumps, rubella and varicella – the clinical term for chickenpox – as part of
  the routine infant vaccination schedule. According to the World Health
  Organization (WHO), the target for vaccine uptake among children in order to
  achieve herd immunity is 95%. But figures for 2024-25 released by the UK
  Health Security Agency on Thursday show that no childhood vaccine has met this
  requirement. Only 83.7% of five-year-olds have received both doses of the
  measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, while uptake of the four-in-one
  preschool booster vaccine – which protects against polio, whooping cough,
  tetanus and diphtheria – stood at 81.4% among five-year-olds in England. The
  low uptake rates have prompted fears that children will be more vulnerable to
  infectious diseases as they begin primary school in September. The government
  has urged parents to make sure their children are up to date with their
  vaccines. In July a child died in Liverpool after contracting measles, the
  first such death in the UK in a decade. Only 73% of children in Liverpool have
  received the necessary two shots to protect against measles. Prof Helen
  Bedford, from the UCL Institute of Child Health, said: “The country is facing
  a serious wake-up call, because if we continue down this path we’re going to
  see many more children unwell and we’re going to see more deaths. “Measles,
  among these other diseases, is incredibly infectious and to keep the disease
  at bay we really do need much higher levels of uptake than what we’re seeing
  at the moment.” She added: “The other big problem [for vaccine uptake] is that
  there are vast inequalities in uptake. We know that uptake is also lower among
  some ethnic minority groups, notably black Caribbean and African populations.”
  The data reveals stark regional inequalities. While more than 90% of
  five-year-olds in the north-east of England received both doses of the MMR
  vaccine, only seven in 10 (69.6%) of eligible Londoners had received the same.
  Meanwhile, regional uptake of the four-in-one booster ranged from 88.9% in the
  north-east of the country to 63.8% in London. London’s mobile population is a
  significant reason for its low uptake, according to Bea Taylor, a senior
  fellow at the Nuffield Trust. “Parents and carers in the capital are more
  likely to face barriers including having to move house regularly, which can
  make it difficult to stay registered with a local GP and receive reminders
  about vaccinations,” she said. Prof Kate Pickett, an academic co-director at
  Health Equity North, said it was “clear there are still challenges to overcome
  to address regional disparities in child vaccination rates”. The UK is the
  worst of the G7 nations regarding MMR vaccination uptake, according to the
  WHO: as of 2024 only 89% of children had received their first MMR jab.
  Globally, millions of children are at risk of lethal diseases owing to vaccine
  coverage having stalled or reversed, according to the largest study of its
  kind. Dr Helen Skirrow, a clinical research fellow at Imperial College
  London’s School of Public Health, said: “Declining vaccine uptake is very
  worrying, as without reversing this trend and achieving sufficient herd
  immunity the increasing measles outbreaks we have seen over recent years could
  continue. It is a public health imperative that more children get vaccinated
  with the recommended two doses of MMR vaccine in order to be protected.”
  Stephen Kinnock, a health minister, said: “Too many children are starting
  primary school without complete protection against preventable and potentially
  serious illnesses like measles, whooping cough and mumps. “Vaccines save
  thousands of lives every year and prevent countless hospital admissions. I
  urge all parents to check their child’s vaccination record and contact their
  GP practice if any jabs are missing.”
