  The Swiss stock market has plunged, the cabinet has held crisis talks and the
  country’s president, Karin Keller-Sutter, has been accused of mishandling a
  vital phone call with the White House after Donald Trump hit the country with
  a shock 39% export tariff. Switzerland, home to some of the world’s best-known
  luxury brands, was left stunned after the US president on Friday imposed one
  of the highest tariff rates in his global trade reset. Industry associations
  said tens of thousands of jobs were at risk. Local media had reported that
  after three months of talks, negotiators believed they had secured a 10%
  tariff on exports to the US, a key market for Swiss products such as luxury
  watches, jewellery and chocolate but also machinery and pharmaceuticals. But
  after a 30-minute call with Keller-Sutter on Thursday evening variously
  described as “bad-tempered”, “disastrous” and “badly misjudged”, Trump imposed
  a levy even higher than the 31% he had announced on his so-called “liberation
  day” in April. Switzerland’s blue-chip stock market index opened 1.8% lower on
  Monday, the first day of trading since the tariff announcement on Swiss
  National Day, a public holiday. The cabinet said after an emergency meeting it
  would improve its offer to Trump. “Switzerland enters this new phase ready to
  present a more attractive offer, taking US concerns into account and seeking
  to ease the current tariff situation,” it said in a statement, without
  detailing what concrete proposals it might make. Swiss officials rejected
  reports that the 39% rate was imposed because of the call between Trump and
  Keller-Sutter, the finance minister and current president under the country’s
  rotating system. “The call was not a success,” a government source said.
  “There was not a good outcome for Switzerland. But there was not a quarrel.
  Trump made it clear from the very beginning that he had a completely different
  point of view, that 10% tariffs were not enough,” the source told Reuters.
  Swiss media were less forgiving. “Faced with Trump, Keller-Sutter was surely
  too naive,” was the headline in the tabloid Blick, while 24 Heures said what
  should have been her “masterpiece” ended up as “the heaviest defeat of her
  political career”. The rate would have a huge impact on Switzerland’s
  export-oriented economy and could spark a recession, said Hans Gersbach, an
  economist at ETH Zürich university, especially if pharmaceuticals, which are
  not covered, were included. Swiss companies, whose exports to the US account
  for about one-sixth of their total foreign sales, face one of the steepest US
  duties – only Laos, Myanmar and Syria had higher figures, at 40-41%. The EU
  and the UK negotiated 15% and 10% respectively. The business minister, Guy
  Parmelin, told RTS public radio on Monday that the government needed to “fully
  understand what happened, why the US president made this decision. Once we
  have that on the table, we can decide how to proceed.” Parmelin said Berne
  would move fast, revise its offer and “hope to achieve something” by 7 August,
  when the tariffs were due to come into effect. He and Keller-Sutter were ready
  to travel to Washington for further talks if necessary, he added. The business
  minister said Trump was focused on the US trade deficit with Switzerland,
  which was Sfr38.5bn (£35.8bn) last year. The country could offer to buy more
  US liquefied natural gas, as the EU had done, or Swiss companies could invest
  more in the US, he said. Keller-Sutter said on Friday that Berne would keep
  talking to Washington but there were only limited concessions it could offer,
  as US imports already enjoyed 99.3% free market access and multiple Swiss
  companies had invested heavily in the US. Analysts have said tariffs could
  still change at any moment because of the unpredictability of the Trump
  administration, with several suggesting their base case remained that
  Switzerland would eventually end up with a rate similar to that of the EU’s.
