  What’s the problem? My rabbit’s foot fern (Davallia fejeensis) has developed
  small, brown lumps along its stems and is leaving sticky droplets on nearby
  surfaces. Diagnosis These brown bumps are almost certainly scale insects.
  Often mistaken for part of the plant, the scales look like tiny brown discs
  attached to stems and leaf joints. They feed by sucking sap, weakening your
  plant over time. The sticky substance you see is honeydew, their waste
  product, which can attract mould or ants if left untreated. These pests are
  slow-moving but persistent, and it’s not uncommon for infestations to spread
  quietly between plants, as you’ve noticed with your collection. Prescription
  Wipe off visible scale with a damp cloth or cotton bud dipped in neem oil or
  insecticidal soap. Repeat weekly to catch any new hatchlings. For severe
  infestations, spray the entire plant with a neem-based solution, ensuring that
  both sides of the fronds and the fuzzy rhizomes are thoroughly coated.
  Prevention Place any new plants in quarantine and inspect the stems and
  undersides of the leaves for pests. Going forward, keep plants dust-free and
  avoid overcrowding, because this helps improve airflow and ward off pests. A
  monthly leaf check and occasional wipe-down with diluted neem oil can go a
  long way. Catching scale early is key; once they’re established, they’re much
  harder to eliminate. Got a plant dilemma? Email saturday@theguardian.com with
