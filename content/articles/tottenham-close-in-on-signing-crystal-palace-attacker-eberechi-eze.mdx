  Tottenham have stepped up their pursuit of Eberechi Eze by holding further
  talks regarding signing the England forward, but Crystal Palace want to line
  up a replacement before sanctioning his sale. Spurs, who confirmed a contract
  extension for their new captain, Cristian Romero, on Monday, are longstanding
  admirers of Eze, having made a move for him last summer. They are even keener
  to get him now that James Maddison is out with an anterior cruciate ligament
  rupture. Dejan Kulusevski, another of the club’s key attacking midfielders, is
  out with a knee problem. Eze is represented by the influential CAA Base
  agency, which has close links to Spurs, and he is open to the transfer. The
  27-year-old forward has also been tracked by Arsenal, the club he supported as
  a boy and played for during his formative years. Eze’s contract at Palace
  contained a £68m release clause but it expired last Friday. Spurs hope to get
  him for around £55m plus bonuses. Eze’s previous club, Queens Park Rangers,
  are entitled to 15% of any profits that Palace make on him. Palace paid around
  £19m to QPR for the player in August 2020. Romero has re-signed at Spurs until
  2029 and it represents something of a turnaround for him after he was linked
  with a move away at the start of the summer. The Argentina centre-half has
  made no secret of his ambition to one day play in Spain and he was of interest
  to Atlético Madrid. But having been given the Spurs captaincy after the
  departure of Son Heung-min to Los Angeles FC, the 27-year-old has
  re-emphasised his commitment. The right-back Djed Spence has also signed a new
  long-term contract with the club. Palace, meanwhile, have targeted Leicester’s
  Bilal El Khannouss and Christos Tzolis of Club Bruges as potential
  replacements for Eze. The club are believed to have failed with an initial
  offer of £20m for El Khannouss, whose release clause expired at the weekend,
  with Leicester thought to want around £26m for the Morocco forward. Palace
  have also made an offer of £25m for Tzolis, a Greece international who spent
  three seasons at Norwich. Oliver Glasner said he expected Eze to play for
  Palace in the Conference League playoff first leg against Fredrikstad at
  Selhurst Park on Thursday. If he did, he would still be able to play for
  another team in the league phase of European competition this season. Marc
  Guéhi is also expected to feature on Thursday as Liverpool have yet to match
  Palace’s £40m valuation of the England defender, whose contract expires at the
  end of the season. Guéhi is understood to be willing to stay at Selhurst Park
  and leave on a free transfer although the Palace chair, Steve Parish, has
  admitted that he would prefer to sell the 25-year-old this month. Palace had
  considered the Sporting defender Ousmane Diomande as a potential replacement
  for Guéhi but the 21-year-old is expected to be out for six weeks with a
  muscle injury and is unlikely to move this window. Palace have also shown an
  interest in Jakub Kiwior but the Poland defender is believed to prefer to move
  overseas having been left out of Arsenal’s squad for the game against
  Manchester United on Sunday. Porto are in talks over a season-long loan for
  Kiwior with an obligation to make the move permanent at the end of the season.
