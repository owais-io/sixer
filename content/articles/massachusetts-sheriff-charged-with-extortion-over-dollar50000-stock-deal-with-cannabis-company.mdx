  cannabis company

  A prominent Massachusetts sheriff has been arrested after federal
  investigators allege he shook down a national cannabis retailer for more than
  $50,000 worth of stock before the firm went public. The FBI said it arrested
  Steven Tompkins, the sheriff of Suffolk county – which encompasses Boston and
  the outlying counties of Chelsea and Revere – for allegedly threatening to
  revoke his office’s partnership with the company unless it agreed to the deal.
  Tompkins was also accused of demanding to be repaid after the value of his
  shares in the cannabis company sank below his initial investment, according to
  court documents. Agents took Tompkins into custody on Friday in Florida.
  “Elected officials, particularly those in law enforcement, are expected to be
  ethical, honest and law abiding – not self-serving,” US attorney Leah Foley
  said in a statement. An indictment against Tompkins, who has served as sheriff
  since 2013, charged him with two counts of extortion under color of official
  right. Each count carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison.
  Described as a “ubiquitous, glad-handing Democrat in Boston political circles”
  by the Boston Globe, Tompkins oversees the largest county correctional system
  in Massachusetts. The sheriff has previously come under the scrutiny of
  authorities. In 2023, he paid a $12,000 fine for creating a no-bid job for his
  niece several years earlier and for asking subordinates to run personal
  errands. He also paid another $2,500 fine for asking business owners to remove
  his political opponent’s campaign signs from their windows. “Every one of us
  in elected office is held to a high standard, and whenever there are law
  enforcement officials that there’s anything coming into question with the law,
  it is a very serious allegation,” said Michelle Wu, Boston’s mayor, to
  reporters on Friday. Tompkins’s indictment is likely to cast a spotlight on
  Massachusetts’ legalized marijuana industry, which has come under scrutiny
  since the state legalized the drug in 2016. Two years before Tompkins’s
  arrest, Massachusetts formed a Cannabis Control Commission after a series of
  scandals, including the dismissal of its top commissioner for bullying and
  making racially inappropriate comments. The indictment against Tompkins does
  not name the cannabis company involved in the alleged plot. But media reports
  have identified it as Ascend Mass, part of Ascend Cannabis, a multi-state
  retailer. A close friend of Tompkins, Andrea Cabral, once ran Ascend Mass.
  According to documents outlining the circumstances of his indictment, Tompkins
  allegedly told a member of the company he “wanted to get in on the stock so
  [he] could make some cannabis money”. He was initially rebuffed but continued
  to pressure an Ascend official that the company needed his cooperation to
  renew its license. The company then sold 28,000 shares for $50,000 to
  Tompkins. They rose in value to $138,403 after Ascend went public in 2021 but
  later sank below the value of his holdings. Tompkins then allegedly demanded a
  refund on his $50,000 to pay for “his campaign and personal expenses”. “We
  believe what the sheriff saw as an easy way to make a quick buck on the sly is
  clearcut corruption under federal law,” Ted Docks, FBI special agent in charge
  of the agency’s Boston division, said in a statement. “The citizens of Suffolk
  county deserve better, not a man who is accused of trading on his position to
  bankroll his own political and financial future. Public servants must be held
  to the highest of ethical standards, and those falling short will be rooted
  out.”
