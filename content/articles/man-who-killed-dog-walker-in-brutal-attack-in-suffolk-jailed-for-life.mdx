  A man who beat a woman to death in a “vicious and brutal attack” as she walked
  her dog, having previously been in prison for a similar assault on a man in
  his 80s, has been jailed for life. Anita Rose, 57, was found grievously
  wounded on 24 July 2024 in Brantham, Suffolk, with her dog tied to her leg by
  its lead to stop it running off. Her attacker was Roy Barclay, 56, who had
  been living rough to escape capture. He had been jailed for an attack in 2015
  on a man in his 80s, who was also found with his dog tied to his leg. Barclay
  had been released early from a 10-year sentence, but was wanted for recall to
  prison for breaching the terms of his licence when he attacked Rose, a mother
  of six. The court heard she suffered a “vicious and brutal attack” with
  Barclay raining down “kicks, stamps and blows on her”. His boot print matched
  those found on her body. Rose died four days later in hospital, having been
  found by passersby, suffering injuries so severe they were similar to those of
  a victim of a car crash. Barclay was sentenced to a minimum term of 25 years.
  Rose’s daughter, Jessica Cox, told of her family’s grief in a victim impact
  statement. Barclay had shown no remorse, she said, and had not told police why
  he had exploded in violence. Cox said: “He has put us through a nightmare
  which we can’t wake up from. I believe he’s cunning and I believe he’s enjoyed
  what he’s done and the trial itself. “He’s not answered why he did what he
  did. What he’s done is horrific and it’s evil. He’s given no reason why he’s
  changed our lives forever. We will never have the answers we deserve as a
  family.” Barclay lived rough for two years, breaking into a sewage works
  through a hole in the fence, which he cut, to wash. Rose was found near the
  sewage works, just after 6.25am having set out just after 5am to walk her
  springer spaniel, Bruce. Having left Rose for dead, Barclay stole items from
  her including her earphones, which he used, and other phone accessories, which
  were found on him when he was arrested. A search of Barclay’s phone found he
  had scoured the internet for news about the police manhunt and had searched
  for information about DNA detection, how long a murder trial took and prisons.
  He had also searched online for information on the detectives who were leading
  the hunt for him. Barclay shaved his head and beard as he tried to avoid
  capture and lived rough near a bridge. In 2015, Barclay attacked an
  82-year-old man in Essex so severely he needed 10 titanium plates in his head.
  He was released from jail in 2020 and was required to live at approved
  premises, but failed to do so. By May 2022, he was recalled to prison and
  started living off grid to avoid capture. Barclay stayed mostly in the
  countryside. He was captured three months after the attack on 21 October in
  Ipswich Library. The Suffolk probation service has started an internal
  inquiry. Judge Martyn Levett described Barclay as “unpredictable” and “someone
  prone to dangerous outbursts at the slightest confrontation”. He said there
  were similarities between the two attacks and added: “Due to your silence in
  police interviews and you choosing not to give evidence in your defence, we
  will perhaps never know what triggered this outburst of horrific violence.”
  DCI Matthew Connick, who led the manhunt, said: “Anita Rose was subjected to
  the most shocking and violent attack on the outskirts of her village whilst
  she was alone and vulnerable on her early morning dog walk.”
