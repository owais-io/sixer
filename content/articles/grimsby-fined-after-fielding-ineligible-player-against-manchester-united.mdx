  A delay of mere seconds in registering a new signing has proved extremely
  expensive for Grimsby but at least the League Two club looks to have escaped a
  potential expulsion from the Carabao Cup. Instead Grimsby have been fined
  £20,000 by the English Football League for fielding an ineligible player
  during their famous League Cup win against Manchester United at Blundell Park
  last Wednesday. The governing body opted to issue a pecuniary sanction rather
  than use their potential powers to either expel David Artell’s side or order
  the tie to be replayed. Clarke Oduor’s registration was submitted at 12.01pm
  last Tuesday, one minute and 59 seconds after the 12pm deadline demanded by
  this season’s EFL League Cup rules. Oduor, a Kenya defender newly acquired on
  loan from League One Bradford, was introduced as a 73rd-minute substitute in a
  tie won 12-11 on penalties by Grimsby after Manchester United recovered from
  falling 2-0 behind to force a shootout. Perhaps ironically Oduor, once of
  Leeds, was the only one of Artell’s players to miss a penalty. When he stepped
  off the bench for his debut, his team held a two-goal advantage. The EFL said
  Grimsby had self-reported this breach of regulations once they discovered a
  mistake prompted by a computer malfunction the day after their triumph against
  Ruben Amorim’s side. It responded by imposing a £20,000 fine on the club but
  left £10,000 suspended. That sum will not need to be paid unless Grimsby field
  another ineligible player in any EFL competition this season. Manchester
  United could, in theory, appeal the EFL’s decision and have until Monday to
  lodge a demand for such a review. The Old Trafford club declined to comment on
  Tuesday. In a statement, accepting their punishment, Grimsby blamed that
  computer error on the delay in hitting the deadline and stressed it had been
  an honest mistake. “We accept the fine imposed and fully recognise the
  importance of adhering to competition rules and regulations,” read the
  statement. “This mistake was not deliberate, and the club acted transparently
  by self reporting the breach as soon as it came to light.” The north-east
  Lincolnshire club – who face Sheffield Wednesday in the third round later this
  month – added that they had undertaken a “full review” of their procedures and
  introduced “strengthened measures” to ensure there can be no repeat of the
  breach of regulations.
