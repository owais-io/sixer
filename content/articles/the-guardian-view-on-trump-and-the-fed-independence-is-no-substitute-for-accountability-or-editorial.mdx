  accountability | Editorial

  Donald Trump’s attempt to sack the Federal Reserve governor, Lisa Cook, is the
  familiar authoritarian trick of bending institutions to serve the leader’s
  immediate ends. The widespread condemnation is deserved. This is not some
  daring experiment in popular control of monetary policy. Yet what should
  follow censure is reflection. For the furore over Ms Cook has revealed a
  peculiar reflex: to defend the Fed’s independence as though it were synonymous
  with democracy itself. But is independence of the Fed, or central banks
  generally, really that? Eric Levitz at Vox thinks so, or at least that it is
  close enough. He argues that Congress sets the Fed’s objectives; independence
  applies only to the means. Without independence, politicians would be free to
  game rates for votes – as Richard Nixon did in 1972, leaning on the Fed to
  juice growth before the election. On this view, independence is not
  anti-democratic but prudent delegation. The historian Adam Tooze says that
  argument misses the point. The Fed, he says, is not a neutral technocracy: its
  regional boards give business elites formal seats at the table, while labour
  and consumers are marginal or absent. Independence is not independence from
  politics; it is independence from electoral accountability. To defend this
  arrangement as democracy’s bulwark, Prof Tooze maintains, is to confuse
  professional consensus with popular legitimacy. The leftwing economist Michael
  Roberts goes further. In his blog this week he argues that central bank
  independence was never really about technocratic efficiency at all. It
  blossomed in the neoliberal era because it suited finance. He notes that the
  1980s and 90s saw a sharp rise in central bank independence while inflation
  fell. The correlation has been taken as proof of causation. Yet Mr Roberts
  argues that the decline in prices owed more to slowing global growth and the
  end of one-off supply shocks. Central banks proved no better than anyone else
  at forecasting crises: the former Fed chair Alan Greenspan admitted the 2008
  crash left him in “a state of shocked disbelief”. Turkey’s recent bout of
  hyperinflation was blamed on presidential meddling – but Mr Roberts suggests
  the real culprits were trade deficits, political instability and a collapsing
  lira. Monetary policy is too blunt an instrument, as many commentators
  concede, to deal with today’s volatile world. So where does this leave
  informed opinion? Certainly not with Mr Trump. To replace one form of
  unaccountability with a demagogic strongman is no gain. The real task is to
  ask what a democratic politics of central banking would look like. The
  academic Saule Omarova’s People’s Ledger is one radical answer: treat the Fed
  as a public utility, offering universal bank accounts and explicitly aligning
  its balance sheet with public priorities. A National Investment Authority
  could channel long-term finance towards infrastructure and decarbonisation,
  rather than leaving investment decisions to Wall Street. Efforts could be made
  to broaden board representation beyond business, require distributional impact
  assessments and tighten “for cause” clauses so that presidents cannot hound
  governors from office on flimsy pretexts. Mr Trump’s assault must be denounced
  – and Ms Cook defended. But if voters stop there, a deeper lesson will be
  missed. Central bank independence was never democracy incarnate. At best it
  was a compromise suited to an earlier era. Today’s challenge is to rebuild
  monetary authority on firmer, more democratic ground. Do you have an opinion
