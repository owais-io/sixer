  It is now a post-match tradition in this part of West Yorkshire to play the
  Kaiser Chiefs’ hit I Predict A Riot whenever Leeds United emerge victorious.
  There is a telling line in the opening verse about things not being very
  pretty and Daniel Farke’s side will do well to remember that at this level, it
  doesn’t have to be: it just has to be effective. Should Leeds buck the recent
  trend of promoted sides tumbling straight back into the Championship this
  season, these are the nights they will have to take full advantage of. Everton
  were timid at best but it looked as though they would escape Elland Road with
  a point. For the majority of the game, they were second best but Leeds could
  not conjure the killer moment when it mattered most. But eventually, they
  found a way – albeit through a slice of luck perhaps, as James Tarkowski’s
  controversial handball led to substitute striker Lukas Nmecha marking his
  debut with what proved to be the winning goal from the penalty spot in the
  84th minute. A draw on the opening night would hardly have been disastrous for
  Leeds, but it would have felt slightly flat given the dominance they enjoyed.
  But Nmecha’s goal sparked wild scenes inside Elland Road: a ground which will
  play a pivotal role in their survival hopes. It was loud all evening but when
  Nmecha slotted home, the roof came off. Who knows how decisive that strike of
  the German international’s right boot will be come May? For now, with the
  evenings still light and the temperatures warm, it was a cause for huge
  celebration. “Of course, for newly promoted sides it has to become a
  fortress,” he said of Elland Road. “I am quite humble and grateful that we are
  able to celebrate.” The decisive moment was not without controversy, though.
  Carlos Alcaraz slipped in possession inside his own half to allow Leeds to
  counter, with debutant Anton Stach’s strike deflecting on to the arm of
  Tarkowski as he leaned towards the ball. There could easily be some debate
  about whether it was handball. David Moyes, perhaps unsurprisingly, saw it
  emphatically one way. “I’m obviously going to say it’s not a penalty and I
  believe it’s not a penalty,” he said. “I’m really disappointed and unless you
  cut the boy’s hand off, I don’t know where he goes.” But in truth, the Everton
  manager could have little to complain about. His side got what they deserved,
  as there was no cutting edge or attacking intent on a night that felt quite
  underwhelming ahead of their first game at their new home on Sunday. The
  visitors struggled all evening, and could have been behind much earlier than
  when Nmecha’s winner eventually arrived. Whether Jack Grealish, only brought
  on with 19 minutes remaining, could have offered something for Everton earlier
  is unclear. But without him, the likes of Beto and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall were
  given little to work with in advanced positions. In contrast, Leeds attacked
  with the greater purpose. Jordan Pickford sprung into action as early as seven
  minutes in to deny Joël Piroe, before a number of corners from debutants Stach
  and Gabriel Gudmundsson caused mayhem, though Leeds could not find the
  clinical touch. Gudmundsson then forced a smart save. In contrast, Everton
  touched the ball in the Leeds area once in the opening half hour. Moyes
  insisted that Everton improved in the second half and while he was right, it
  was not enough to trouble Leeds. The better chances kept coming at the other
  end, even after Grealish emerged. Ao Tanaka, the game’s standout man and a
  player who will be integral to Leeds’ survival hopes, tested Pickford before
  Wilfried Gnonto shot into the side netting. But just when it looked as though
  it would fade out into a draw, Stach’s shot deflected on to Tarkowski’s arm,
  Chris Kavanagh pointed to the spot after consulting his linesman and Nmecha
  did the rest to send Elland Road into delirium. Last season, it took until
  October for one of the promoted sides to win a game. The other two didn’t win
  until November. This opening weekend, two of the three have already won, only
  the third time that has happened in the Premier League era. Nights like these
  suggest even though it is early in proceedings, the relegation scramble may
  not be the forgone conclusion it has been tipped to be. The celebrations here
  at full time emphatically underlined anyone expecting to turn up at Elland
  Road and be handed three points may well come unstuck over the next nine
  months.
