  ever’

  “I was playing for Scarborough against Whitby,” says Zoe Aldcroft as the
  England women’s rugby captain pauses before the start of the World Cup this
  week and describes one of her formative experiences in the game. “I must have
  been 12 at the time as I was the only girl playing rugby and we were up at
  Whitby. It was the coldest day ever and the wind was whipping. There was such
  a steep slope at Whitby Rugby Club and they had this massive guy playing for
  them. Whenever he broke the line they always used to shout ‘Cannonball.’”
  Aldcroft, the inspirational 28-year-old leader and lock forward, lets slip a
  gap-toothed grin as she remembers the scene. “He’d broken the line and, as the
  full-back, I was the last one between him and the try line. I knew I had to
  stop him so I dropped my shoulder and just nailed him. I think it stunned a
  lot of people.” Did that crunching tackle mark a sea change in attitudes
  towards her as a girl playing boys’ rugby? “Definitely in respect of my
  teammates, which was something I really enjoyed,” she says. “I could see they
  trusted me and knew I could be just as tough as them.” We soon move on to a
  far bloodier incident, which was even more of a test for the young rugby
  pioneer in North Yorkshire. “There was a different time, in training, where I
  collided heads with one boy. He started crying and I was holding it in,
  telling myself desperately: ‘Do not cry, do not cry …’ Then I got up as quick
  as I could and was ready to go again. I had to show I was stronger, tougher
  and could take playing with the boys.” Aldcroft was always “super-sporty” but,
  before rugby, she also did ballet. “I was not as nimble as other ballet
  dancers” she says with a little laugh before explaining that she fell into
  rugby after her brother Jonathan switched sports from football. “I was down
  there watching him on the sidelines with my parents and the coach was like:
  ‘C’mon then. Get involved.’ “I thought ‘Yes’ and never looked back. The best
  thing is that, while I was the only girl that used to play there, Scarborough
  Rugby Club now have 50 girls playing under-13s, under-15 and a senior set-up
  for women’s rugby. It’s changed so much.” There is such optimism and warmth in
  Aldcroft’s character that it is unsurprising she should regard the next six
  weeks as another definitive stage in a female sporting revolution: “This World
  Cup has the potential to change women’s rugby for ever. In England, over the
  last few years, we’ve been filling stadiums and this tournament will build
  momentum and so much excitement. If we do win the World Cup, it will change
  our lives and also all the young girls who are growing from grassroots levels
  into the professional side.” The England squad has a northern heartbeat and it
  seems fitting that their opening group match this Friday should be against USA
  in Sunderland. “The other week we tried to pick a full XV of girls from the
  north,” Aldcroft says. “We added a couple from the Midlands and just about
  made it. That’s important because Sale are the only northern club in PWR
  [Premiership Women’s Rugby].” Her husband, Luke Stratford, is the scrum coach
  for the women’s team at Sale Sharks. Aldcroft smiles ruefully when reminded
  Luke has said before that she worries about keeping her place, despite being
  World Rugby’s women player of the year in 2021 and after winning 65 caps. “I
  have this impostor syndrome sometimes, but it makes me tick in a weird way. It
  makes me feel like I have to push myself again because you see so many times
  where life just changes quickly.” Aldcroft is an intriguing mix. She carries a
  searing focus on the field, leading by example, while away from rugby she is
  relaxed and chatty. Some of her friends in the squad have described her as
  “the craziest girl” they know. “It’s probably because I’m super-dedicated and,
  playing rugby, I love the contact that maybe other people shy away from. I
  really go for it. But, off the pitch, I can be silly and fun and goofy.” Jonny
  Wilkinson is her inspiration and during his playing career those last three
  words she uses to describe herself would never have applied to the obsessive
  No 10 who helped England win the men’s World Cup in 2003. “Years later I read
  one of his books,” she says, “and that instilled in me a little bit of his
  mentality. I related to it because I’m a perfectionist and obsessed with
  winning and being the best. I met him when I was on a tour and from then I was
  so interested in his way of thinking.” Aldcroft smiles when asked if she told
  Wilkinson that she carries a knitted doll of him at the bottom of her match
  bag. “No, because I didn’t have my doll back then. But I always think a little
  like he did because I’m obsessed with my performance.” I’ve heard that, as
  soon as she is alone after a game, Aldcroft will watch a recording of the
  match. “I still do that and it’s always the whole game. My husband’s like:
  ‘Switch off.’ I say: ‘Just let me watch this and then I can chill.’ I can’t
  relax until I’ve watched it and seen what I could have done better.” Does she
  ever feel proud when watching herself? “Maybe more a feeling of relief. I’d
  say: ‘I’ve been OK, I’ve done my job.’ Maybe when I’ve finished rugby I’ll
  look back and think: ‘Oh. That was quite good.’” Her most painful match
  remains the 2022 World Cup final against New Zealand – when England started
  the game in Auckland on the back of an unbeaten run of 30 victories. Aldcroft
  felt certain they would become world champions: “I wasn’t even nervous because
  I had absolutely no doubt. In my eyes there was no way we were losing that
  final.” England were 14-0 up in 14 minutes but, soon afterwards, Lydia
  Thompson was sent off. Aldcroft was substituted after 29 minutes after a
  concussion and England ended up losing a gripping game 34-31. “It was a big
  lesson because you see how quickly a game can change and you have to fight
  against the unfairness as well. We had a chance to score a try from that last
  lineout; 99% of the time we would have caught it and gone over, but it didn’t
  happen.” Aldcroft stresses that “the culture around the team had to change
  and, since Mitch [former All Black head coach John Mitchell] came in, we’ve
  become a completely different team. We’ve worked massively on our culture, on
  our bond as a team. We were tight [in 2022] but not to the level that we are
  now. It’s something we’ve really tried to develop as, the tighter you are as a
  team, the harder you want to fight for each other on the pitch. “We’ve done a
  lot of work in telling the stories of our lives. We want to have conversations
  that go into a deeper part of our teammates’ life and know them down to their
  roots. Knowing what makes each other tick makes such a difference.” Some
  members of Aldcroft’s squad have extraordinary personal stories – none more so
  than Meg Jones who, in March, spoke to me in moving detail about the death of
  her parents within the space of four shattering months. “Meg is the strongest
  person I’ve known,” Aldcroft says. “Before her mum and dad died, she stood up
  and spoke about how her mum was an alcoholic. Lots of people in the room
  hadn’t known because she’d kept that to herself for so long. When her parents
  died, it was something she wanted to address with the group and she was
  completely open. We know when she needs a moment and we support her as best we
  can.” Jones is the vice-captain, alongside Marlie Packer, and there is also a
  wider leadership group. “We all have different attributes and different
  relationships with different people in the team. It brings us together and
  allows people to elevate themselves and be empowered.” Our conversation moves
  in different tangents and Aldcoft is amused as she remembers her husband
  wearing shorts to their wedding. They recently celebrated their first
  anniversary and she describes how, when they first met outside a nightclub in
  Gloucester, she was 20. “Luke was in fancy dress, dressed as a woman,”
  Aldcroft says drily, “in a long skirt and a top bought from the charity shop.”
  Luke knew she was an England international and, having diligently pursued her,
  they eventually began to go out and were married last summer. Aldcroft wore an
  elegant white wedding dress, but her new husband cut a different figure in a
  sky blue jacket, white shirt, silver bow-tie and navy-blue shorts. “He hates
  wearing trousers, even in minus conditions,” Aldcroft says. “So that was his
  one condition – wearing shorts on the wedding day. I had to think what would
  look good with shorts and as soon as the wedding was done the tie was off and
  the flip-flops were on. It helps that I’m super-chilled as well.” It is almost
  as distinctive that England’s World Cup captain is keen to become a podiatrist
  after her rugby career. “This summer I did my foot-health course as a starter
  and I think I want to do a degree in it. It’s a lot about joint alignment,
  your gait, and also chopping away scaly skin and sorting out in-grown
  toenails. My Dad’s feet are the worst. He’s got a big fat corn and I love
  scraping it out. Honestly, just making bad feet good? I love that.” We return
  to the serious stuff. England won their seventh successive Six Nations in
  April. But they nearly blew a 31-7 lead in the final match against France and
  scraped home 43-42. “That was the best thing that could have happened,”
  Aldcroft says. “That second half showed we’re not there yet. So this
  pre-season we’ve really dug in and gone for it. When we’ve got our foot on
  their throat we can’t ease off.” England, with Aldcroft playing flank,
  dispatched France with conviction in their final warm-up match before the
  World Cup, winning 40-6 away from home. It was their 27th consecutive win.
  They also beat New Zealand convincingly, 49-31, last October and Aldcroft
  picks out the reigning champions, along with France and Canada, as England’s
  biggest threat: “We know that, when it gets to the World Cup, New Zealand
  switch it on again. So it’s important we stay ahead of our game.” The Red
  Roses squad watched the semi-final and final together as England’s Lionesses
  won the Euros and she says: “It’s an amazing time for women’s sport and now
  it’s our turn to do our bit and grow rugby in England.” There is just time for
  one last question. Will England win the World Cup? Aldcroft’s answer is as
  swift as it is resolute: “I believe that we will.”
