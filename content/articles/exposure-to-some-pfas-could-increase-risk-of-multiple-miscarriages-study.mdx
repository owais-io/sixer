  Exposure to some toxic Pfas “forever chemicals” may increase the risk of
  having multiple miscarriages, new peer-reviewed research has found. The study,
  which tracked about 200 women in China, found those who had at least two
  miscarriages, or unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortions, showed higher
  levels of several types of Pfas in their blood. The study adds to a long list
  of reproductive harms associated with Pfas exposure. “Prior studies have
  identified that Pfas were associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, but the
  potential influence of Pfas’s exposure on [recurrent miscarriages] remained
  uncertain,” the study’s authors, with the Chinese Center for Disease Control
  and Prevention, wrote. “Our investigation identified significant associations
  between [some Pfas] and increased risks of unexplained recurrent spontaneous
  abortions.” Pfas are a class of about 16,000 chemicals typically used to make
  products that resist water, stains and heat. They are called “forever
  chemicals” because they do not naturally break down and accumulate in humans
  and the environment. The chemicals are linked to cancer, kidney disease, liver
  problems, immune disorders, and other serious health problems. Some Pfas
  compounds are linked to developmental issues like birth defects and low birth
  weight. In men, the chemicals are thought to lower sperm quality and cause DNA
  changes that can impact the offsprings’ health later in life. About 5% of
  women experience recurrent miscarriages and half of those have no explanation,
  according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Among
  the chemicals that showed the strongest association were PFHxS, which is a
  common Pfas water pollutant. Several of the compounds for which researchers
  found associations were “short chain” Pfas, meaning smaller chemicals that
  industry has said are generally safer and less toxic than older and larger
  Pfas. However, there is little independent research on many short chains, but
  what does exist points to high toxicity, and the new research adds to
  increasing concerns over their safety. The biological mechanism by which Pfas
  may cause miscarriages is unclear, the authors wrote, but they theorized that
  it had to do with the disruption of normal thyroid hormone metabolism, and
  other hormonal impacts. Pfas are strongly associated with endocrine system
  harm. The authors wrote that follow up research is needed to examine the
  question and find solutions and said a larger cohort size should be studied to
  confirm their findings. The research adds to “an incredible body of evidence
  linking exposure to Pfas to developmental harm”, said David Andrews, senior
  scientist with the Environmental Working Group non-profit that tracks Pfas
  issues, but was not involved with the study. “It’s a shocking health impact
  and it further indicates these compounds seem to wreak havoc throughout our
  body,” Andrews said. Pfas are ubiquitous in consumer goods and the environment
  so they are difficult to avoid. But women can protect themselves by using
  filtration systems that remove Pfas from water, avoiding nonstick cookware,
  avoiding stain guards, buying organic food, and looking for Pfas-free
  cosmetics or personal care goods.
