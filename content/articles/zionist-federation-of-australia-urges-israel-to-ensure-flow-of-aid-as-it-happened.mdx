  It’s time to wind down our lives news coverage for the day. Here’s what’s been
  keeping us busy: Australia signed a new joint-statement of 15 foreign
  ministers, including France and Canada, on Gaza, expressing their “unwavering
  commitment” to a two-state solution. The Labor MP Ed Husic says Australia
  joining with countries including France and the UK to recognise Palestinian
  statehood would end Hamas’s power in Gaza. The Coalition, meanwhile, said it
  had “serious concerns” about the government recognising a Palestinian state
  “outside of a proper two-state process”. A motion calling Israel’s aid
  blockade of Gaza a breach of international law and placing pressure on the
  Albanese government to ramp up pressure against Israel passed the Senate after
  Labor and the Greens teamed up. The Zionist Federation of Australia revealed
  it was “deeply troubled” by the starvation crisis gripping Gaza and urged
  Israel to ensure sufficient aid flows to Palestinian civilians “without
  delay”. The NSW premier said a pro-Palestinian protest on Sydney Harbour
  Bridge would be a “logistical and communications Everest”. Inflation dropped
  to 2.1% in the year to June, from 2.4% in the year to March, as further
  evidence of waning underlying price pressures paves the way for a Reserve Bank
  rate cut next month. Jim Chalmers called the data “stunning”. Google reacted
  to the government’s decision to include YouTube in the under-16s social media
  ban (though YouTube kids will be exempt), saying the platform was “not social
  media”. Finally, what does a tech giant do when it comes to screen time at
  home? Scott Farquhar’s children have “very defined screen time” and he makes
  sure he is aware of what they are viewing, he said. As ever, a big thank you
  for joining us. We’ll be back with more breaking news tomorrow from 7am.
  Reality TV star’s trial delayed The trial of reality TV star Matt Wright on
  charges of attempting to pervert the course of justice after a fatal outback
  helicopter crash has again been delayed. The February 2022 crash killed
  Wright’s friend and Outback Wrangler TV show co-star Chris “Willow” Wilson,
  who was hanging from a sling under the chopper on a mission to collect
  crocodile eggs, AAP reports. A jury was set to be chosen on Thursday. But in
  the supreme court in Darwin on Wednesday, acting Justice Alan Blow rescheduled
  the empanelment for 5 August. It ensures the jury will be selected after a
  long weekend, with 4 August marking the Picnic Day public holiday in the
  territory. The start of the trial has been delayed several times and pre-trial
  legal argument before Blow is set to continue this week. A motion calling
  Israel’s aid blockade of Gaza a breach of international law and placing
  pressure on the Albanese government to ramp up pressure against Israel has
  passed the Senate this evening after Labor and the Greens teamed up. Following
  a pause for some first speeches in the upper house, the motion’s speaker list
  resumed at 6pm with three more Greens senators and was agreed to on the voices
  by the remaining Labor and Greens senators in the chamber. The Coalition noted
  their disagreement but did not call for a division. The motion’s final wording
  stated: Israel’s aid blockade, which risks mass death from starvation in Gaza
  and millions of Palestinians facing catastrophic hunger, is a breach of
  international law, and that it is critical the Australian government continue
  intensifying its efforts including diplomatic and further action to pressure
  the Israeli government to open all border crossings and allow the unimpeded
  flow of humanitarian aid. Labor Friends of Palestine: PM’s comments
  belittling, misleading and disrespectful The Labor Friends of Palestine
  campaign group has criticised Anthony Albanese’s comments today downplaying
  the prospect of further sanctions on Israel over its military campaign in
  Gaza, saying his comments dismiss the sentiments of many inside the Labor
  movement. Asked at a press conference about levelling further sanctions on
  Israel, Albanese responded: “What we haven’t done is go for slogans, frankly …
  which is the sanction that you would like?” The government has already put
  targeted financial and travel sanctions on two Israeli ministers. Albanese
  shrugged off further sanction calls, saying “what we are about is meaningful
  action, not slogans”. But many inside the Labor party are calling for
  sanctions. Victorian Labor’s state conference will debate, and is expected to
  pass, a motion from rank-and-file members urging further sanctions on Israel
  and the recognition of the state of Palestine. Labor Friends of Palestine has
  circulated similar motions, supported by 80 (and climbing) local ALP branches.
  Peter Moss, co-convener of the Labor Friends of Palestine, said in a
  statement: The Prime Minister’s comments today belittling the campaign for
  sanctions as ‘slogans’ are misleading and disrespectful to thousands of Labor
  Party members. The Prime Minister and the government are well aware of the
  overwhelming support for sanctions that are clearly defined in a motion passed
  by more than 80 Labor Party units in recent weeks. Labor Party members around
  Australia voted for ‘sanctions on the Israeli individuals and entities who are
  responsible for ongoing breaches of international humanitarian law in Gaza,
  including the use of starvation as a weapon’. The Prime Minister should not
  dismiss or distort the strongly held views of Labor Party members who worked
  hard for the re-election of his government. The Zionist Federation of
  Australia has revealed it is “deeply troubled” by the starvation crisis
  gripping Gaza and has urged Israel to ensure sufficient aid flows to
  Palestinian civilians “without delay”. The federation said it is the
  “collective moral obligation” of Israel and the United Nations to address the
  humanitarian crisis in a statement on Wednesday, which was first reported by
  the Nine newspapers. The group’s president, Jeremy Leibler, said: Our humanity
  also compels us to recognise the pain and suffering of innocent Palestinian
  civilians in Gaza. We are deeply troubled by the reports of hunger in parts of
  Gaza. We call upon Israel, the United Nations and their counterparts to do
  everything within their power to ensure that sufficient humanitarian aid flows
  to Palestinian civilians without delay. That is their collective moral
  obligation. Leibler continued: We welcome that Israel is taking steps to
  facilitate the distribution of more aid, including undertaking daily pauses in
  its operations, and opening new aid corridors. We reiterate that ultimate
  responsibility for this humanitarian situation lies with Hamas – it started
  this war, refuses to release the hostages, refuses to accept a ceasefire
  agreement, deliberately steals aid to fund its war machine and sabotages its
  distribution. It is essential that Hamas returns to negotiations and accepts
  the hostage exchange and ceasefire agreement that is on the table, and
  ultimately, is removed from power in Gaza. Fate of plan to convert
  Queensland’s Olympics villages into affordable housing uncertain Queensland’s
  Olympics villages may not become affordable housing after the end of the
  games. Under the previous Labor government, a minimum of 20% of the athletes’
  villages were to be set aside as affordable housing. But parliamentary
  estimates heard on Wednesday that the new government had no specific target.
  The director general of state development, infrastructure and planning, John
  Sosso, said “the exact percentage will be a subject of negotiation” but would
  “play an appropriate role in the housing stock”. The deputy premier, Jarrod
  Bleijie, also revealed that the state government was considering selling the
  land beneath the Gabba cricket ground – which is set to be demolished – to
  fund the new 17,000-seat Brisbane live arena next door. He said: We would
  never say we would never say no to an arena if the private sector needs a deal
  to be done with the land. The one thing the state does have is the land. The
  one thing the state does have is the powers of planning and the levers to be
  pulled to unlock that infrastructure. Read more here: New South Wales light
  plane crash kills a man in his 50s A person has died after a plane crash in
  NSW’s west today. Police said emergency services were called at about 2pm to
  D-Block Road, Balranald, about 130km west of Hay, after reports of a light
  plane crash. A man, found in a critical condition, was treated by paramedics
  at the scene but could not be revived. The man, believed to be in his 50s, is
  yet to be formally identified, police said in a statement. Police said the
  crash site had been secured as a crime scene. A report will be prepared for
  the coroner and an investigation into the cause of the crash will be
  undertaken by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. Doctor turned politician
  and Israel ally says ‘no words’ to describe Gaza suffering The final speaker
  on the Greens’ motion on Gaza is Michelle Ananda-Rajah, a Labor senator who
  visited Israel during her first term as a Labor MP in the previous parliament.
  Ananda-Rajah, a doctor turned politician, spoke of her experience in Israel
  after the 7 October attacks, describing it as “another level of atrocity and
  depravity that I’ve never experienced before”. But the self-described ally of
  Israel said the situation in Gaza had “distressed” her. She continued: Right
  now, the people of Gaza are suffering. There is a humanitarian catastrophe.
  There are no words left any more in our lexicon to describe what is going on
  there. It is unconscionable that children should be starving. It should be. It
  is unconscionable that pregnant mothers cannot deliver, that there is no
  anaesthesia, painfulness, insufficient antibiotics … Israel has, I should say,
  the Netanyahu government has really not articulated to the global community
  what the political solution is to this … Because not only are [the Netanyahu
  government] bringing Israel into disrepute, and further isolated, there is an
  unconscionable stain on this country’s, I fear, history with the deaths of so
  many people disproportionately. And I say this as an ally of Israel. My Jewish
  community know who I am. They know how hard I fought for them, and I will
  continue to do so, but there must be a better solution to this conflict here.
  The motion’s speeches were suspended while fresh senators delivered their
  first speeches. It’ll resume later this evening. Lidia Thorpe: government ‘has
  the power to take real action’ on Gaza The independent senator, Lidia Thorpe,
  spoke to support the Greens’ motion on Gaza, saying the crisis “didn’t happen
  overnight” despite the “sudden concern” of the Albanese government. Each time
  this government stays silent, Israel is given the green light to carry on its
  genocide, knowing they can get away with it. Strongly worded emails and
  sharpened criticism of Israel’s actions are not enough to hold Israel
  accountable. This government has the power to take real action and put an end
  to the mass murder of Palestinians. The Palestinian population is on the brink
  of complete annihilation as its genocide enters its final iteration, we demand
  urgent action before it’s too late. Labor to move amendment to Greens’ Gaza
  motion The Labor senator Tim Ayres has spoken on the Greens’ urgency motion,
  largely repeating comments made by the prime minister and foreign affairs
  minister previously. Ayres starts out by outlining the government’s position:
  The position of the Australian government is very clear: every innocent life
  matters. We reiterate our call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire and
  the release of all of the remaining hostages. The government remains
  unequivocal in our condemnation of Hamas and its ongoing acts of terror. Gaza
  is in the grip of a humanitarian catastrophe. Israel’s denial of aid and the
  killing of civilians, including children seeking access to water and food, is
  indefensible. We call on Israel to comply immediately with its obligations
  under international law. Labor will move an amendment proposing to tweak some
  of the wording. It proposes the following statement: Israel’s aid blockade,
  which risks mass death from starvation in Gaza and millions of Palestinians
  facing catastrophic hunger, is a breach of international law. Cash ‘saddened’
  about Gaza but Coalition won’t support Greens motion Following Mehreen
  Faruqi’s speech on the motion to urge the Albanese government to do more to
  pressure the Israeli government to “open all border crossings and allow the
  unimpeded flow of humanitarian aid”, the opposition Senate leader, Michaelia
  Cash, is ready to speak. Cash says the opposition will not be supporting the
  motion but says: Nobody wants to see the suffering of people in Gaza, and we
  are saddened and shocked like everybody at the loss of life in Gaza … The
  remainder of the speech centres heavily on Palestinian militant group Hamas
  rather than the ongoing humanitarian crisis, which has left much of Gaza’s
  population in starvation. She says: The Greens never seem to want to actually
  admit that the blame for this war lies squarely at the feet of the militant
  terrorist organisation Hamas. The Coalition, on the other hand, fundamentally
  believes that the moral responsibility for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is
  squarely on the terrorist group Hamas. Chair of parliament’s pro-Israel caucus
  has concerns about Australia’s ‘willingness’ to recognise a Palestinian state
  Andrew Wallace says a pro-Israel caucus has concerns around the Albanese
  government’s “willingness” to recognise a Palestinian state. The Liberal MP
  and chair of the Australia Israel Allies Caucus told the ABC a short time ago
  that the Coalition favoured a two-state, negotiated process between Israel and
  Palestinians “and we think that any attempt to try to bring unilaterally the
  recognition of a Palestinian state forward is really just rewarding Hamas for
  the attacks that it perpetrated on Israel on 7 October 2023”. He said
  Australia did not have to follow in the UK’s footsteps: The war could be over
  today if Hamas was to lay down its weapons, surrender, return the current 50
  or so hostages that are still being held. Now to be talking about a
  Palestinian state at this point in time is still too early and it has to be
  done through a negotiated process. Just because the United Kingdom lands on a
  certain position doesn’t mean that Australia has to either. There’s no role
  for Hamas in a potential Palestinian state, Chalmers says Jim Chalmers says
  Anthony Albanese and Penny Wong are “making sure that there’s no role for
  Hamas” in a potential Palestinian state. The treasurer told the ABC a short
  time ago that he did not pay heed to Michaelia Cash’s comments that a
  Palestinian state should come only once peace had been reached in Gaza and was
  akin to a reward for Hamas. “Clearly an obstacle is … making sure that there’s
  no role for Hamas,” he said of plans around recognising a Palestinian state.
  He said the statement released by 15 countries, including Australia, was
  “really, really important” in that it denounced the terrorist act of 7
  October, demanded a ceasefire, access for humanitarian workers and the release
  of the hostages, and called on countries to work towards recognition as part
  of progress towards a two-state solution. Chalmers said: From my point of
  view, personally and as a member of the government, there is real momentum
  here. That momentum, that progress, is welcome, but it’s also conditional.
  Over in the Senate, the Greens are moving a motion for a matter of public
  urgency on Gaza. The Greens senator Nick McKim moves the motion, which reads:
  That the risk of mass death from starvation in Gaza, with millions of
  Palestinians facing catastrophic hunger, is a result of Israel’s aid blockade,
  and that it is critical the Australian government intensify its efforts –
  including diplomatic and economic measures – to pressure the Israeli
  government to open all border crossings and allow the unimpeded flow of
  humanitarian aid. First up to speak is Mehreen Faruqi. She says: It is brutal,
  it is inhumane and it is savage. We warned you all from the very beginning
  that this is where we will end up … but you flocked to defend Israel knowing
  they have long been killing, arresting, torturing and permanently injuring
  Palestinians for decades. Labor MPs, including members of this chamber,
  flocked to Israel for photo opportunities with genocidal Israeli soldiers …
  Here’s a clip of the Atlassian co-founder Scott Farquhar describing how he
  deals with screens and online dangers in the privacy of his own home. The
  father of three told the National Press Club his approach is to opt for strict
  screen time limits and to make sure he knows what his children are viewing.
  New select committee to take on climate change misinformation The Greens have
  passed an inquiry this afternoon into third-party and groups who peddle mis-
  and disinformation about climate and energy policy in Australia. The minor
  party gained the support of Labor and some crossbenchers to form a new select
  committee into how misinformation and disinformation related to climate change
  and energy is “financed, produced and disseminated”. The Select Committee on
  Information Integrity on Climate Change and Energy will also examine the links
  between Australian organisations and international thinktanks and influence
  networks that are known to spread mis- and disinformation. The final vote was
  39 ayes to 28 noes. One Nation and the United Australia party senator Ralph
  Babet joined with the Coalition to vote against the inquiry. Google scraps
  Parliament House event amid debate on under-16s social media ban Google has
  scrapped at the last minute a major showcase event in Parliament House on the
  day the Labor government decided to include YouTube in its social media ban.
  As we reported on the weekend, the “Google at Parliament House” event was to
  go ahead tonight, with popular YouTube creators and Australian band the Rubens
  among the entertainment. A large number of politicians and staffers attend the
  event each year. The event was being put together inside parliament’s Great
  Hall today – passersby could hear the musicians sound-checking. But in an
  email to attenders this afternoon, Google said the event would be postponed.
  “Out of respect for grieving families who have gathered in Parliament House
  today, we have decided to postpone the annual Google at Parliament House
  event,” the email read. It continued: We apologise for the late notice, and
  appreciate your understanding. We will be in touch with a new date as soon as
  possible. It appeared to be a reference to the families involved in the 36
  Months campaign who Anthony Albanese and the communications minister, Anika
  Wells, met today and who had been pushing for the under-16s social media ban
  after their children lost their lives following issues with social media like
  bullying. Read more here: Groom among six injured in minibus crash on way to
  wedding A groom on the way to his wedding is among six people injured in a
  Hunter Valley minibus collision this morning. New South Wales police said the
  56-year-old was with four male wedding guests when the minibus he was
  travelling in collided on Mount View Road and veered down an embankment
  shortly after 10.30. The groom was seriously injured and taken by air to John
  Hunter hospital. A member of his wedding party was also seriously injured, the
  Hunter Valley district commander, Supt Steve Laksa, told reporters. The four
  other minivan occupants were taken to the same hospital, where the male driver
  underwent mandatory blood and alcohol testing. An investigation by crash
  investigators was under way. Brisbane Olympics swimming venues to cost
  taxpayers $1.2bn A new national aquatic centre plus another swimming project
  planned for the 2032 Brisbane Olympics will cost the taxpayer $1.2bn. The
  aquatic centre – to be built in central Brisbane – will be the long-term home
  for four swimming sports and host 25,000 spectators during the Games. The
  Games Independent Infrastructure and Coordination Authority interim CEO, Nick
  Elliott, revealed the estimate at a state parliamentary estimates hearing. It
  also includes an upgrade of the Chandler pool, he said. All games venues are
  to be built within a $7.1bn cap, according to the state government. Government
  witnesses confirmed that the figure included any debt financing through
  public-private partnerships. The largest venue, a new stadium at Victoria
  Park, is budgeted to cost $3.785bn alone. A project validation report for it
  is due to be completed next year, Elliott said. Read more here: ‘No black
  skivvies’ in Wiggles HQ lobbying against YouTube under-16s ban Management for
  the Wiggles have responded to the communications minister, Anika Wells,
  claiming she was lobbied to keep YouTube out of the under-16s social media ban
  by “black skivvies” in Wiggles management, saying they don’t wear black
  skivvies. Wells mentioned in a press conference earlier today it wasn’t
  individual Wiggles, but “it was the black skivvies, it was Wiggles Inc, it was
  Wiggles management”. In a response provided to Guardian Australia, a Wiggles
  HQ spokesperson said “there are no black skivvies worn at Wiggles HQ”. The
  group was not paid by YouTube to lobby on their behalf to stay out of the ban,
  with Wiggles HQ stating it was providing an “independent perspective” to Wells
  on the ban as children’s content creators: Video platforms like YouTube, when
  used to watch trusted children’s programs, function differently to social
  media. Millions of Australian parents (including Minister Wells) and their
  children watch The Wiggles on YouTube much like they would on smart TVs, not
  as part of a social media feed. Thank you, Krishani Dhanji. I’m Daisy Dumas,
  here to keep you company for the remainder of the afternoon. Let’s get going.
  A big thanks for following along on the blog with me today, I’ll leave you
  with the lovely Daisy Dumas for the rest of the afternoon. I’ll see you here
  first thing tomorrow morning – with plenty of caffeine in hand! Hanson-Young
  says government must legislate a duty of care for big tech It’s “delulu” to
  believe big tech companies will do the right thing about the government’s
  under-16s social media ban without being legally required to, the Greens
  senator Sarah Hanson-Young says. At a press conference shortly before question
  time, the Greens’ communications spokesperson urged the federal government to
  legislate a duty of care for social media companies, noting users could still
  view content on social media sites without logging in. The idea that there’s
  going to be two classes of safety is ridiculous. The companies need to be
  legally held responsible. So the first thing is a duty of care, requiring
  these companies to uphold a duty of care to their customers, to their users.
  The second thing is to make sure they’re licensed so that that duty of care is
  enforceable. Just hoping that these big social media companies will do the
  right thing is delusional. It’s delulu to think that Google will just do the
  right thing. They need to be forced to do it. Tl;dr: here’s what we learned in
  question time today Before question time could properly start, a small group
  of protesters were shouting “sanction Israel now” up in the public gallery.
  They were promptly escorted out by security. The opposition started again on
  bulk-billing rates today, but then put several questions to Chris Bowen on
  energy prices increasing. He said the latest inflation data shows energy
  inflation has started going down – which didn’t satisfy those on the opposite
  side of the chamber, who argue that households are still paying huge bills.
  Tony Burke provided an update to the house on the work of police investigating
  the arson attack on the Adass Israel synagogue in Melbourne, which happened in
  December last year. And Dai Le asked why the government hasn’t yet scrapped or
  amended the Job-ready Graduates scheme – the government wouldn’t say. The
  disgraced New South Wales MP Gareth Ward has been remanded in custody to await
  sentencing after he was convicted last week for serious sex offences involving
  two young men. Justice Kara Shead said she was “unpersuaded” that Ward,
  because of his profile or disabilities, cannot be managed in a custodial
  setting. The MP for Kiama, aged 43, had been permitted to remain on bail after
  last week’s verdict under strict bail conditions requiring him to remain at
  either his residence on the south coast or his flat in Sydney. The prosecutor,
  Monika Knowles, applied to the NSW district court today to have Ward jailed,
  noting that due to the seriousness of the crimes that Ward has been convicted
  of there was virtually no chance he would avoid a custodial sentence when
  sentencing took place. On Friday a jury found Ward guilty of three counts of
  indecent assault and one count of sexual intercourse without consent. The
  lesser convictions carry a maximum penalty of five years and the more serious
  rape conviction a maximum penalty of 14 years. Ward’s barrister, Edward
  Anderson, had argued Ward was at particular risk due to his high profile as a
  politician. He also expressed concern about whether his visual impairment due
  to his albinism would put him at risk. Ward is close to legally blind and
  requires technological support to read and write. Shead said there were
  procedures in place to ensure that his devices could be required. Ward is due
  to be sentenced on 19 September. Labor ‘looking at’ NT funding in response to
  reintroduction of spit hoods, minister says The federal government is “looking
  at” commonwealth funding arrangements with the Northern Territory in response
  to the reintroduction of spit hoods for 10-year-old incarcerated children, the
  Indigenous affairs minister, Malarndirri McCarthy, says. In Senate question
  time, the independent senator Lidia Thorpe asked the minister whether action
  would be taken against states and territories that reintroduce measures,
  including spit hoods and restraint chairs. The use of spit hoods across the
  country ceased after Australia formally endorsed a United Nations protocol
  against torture and inhumane punishments in 2017. McCarthy conceded it was
  “very tough”, given there were “no actual penalties in that agreement” for
  those who choose not to follow it. She said she was considering a call by some
  NT land councils to restrict commonwealth funding in response to the decision
  made by the territory’s Country Liberal party government. McCarthy said: The
  difficulty here, Senator Thorpe, is that nearly 80% of the Northern Territory
  budget comes from the commonwealth, so we have to be responsible in our
  response to the Northern Territory, but we also have to be responsible to all
  citizens of the Northern Territory, who receive that, and I am looking at
  those numbers, and I am looking at those links in terms of the federal
  agreements, but not just for the Northern Territory. This also has to be about
  the federal agreements and the communications that we have with all states.
  The minister said attorneys general from around the country would discuss the
  issue next month in a meeting. Can you question a member’s competence in
  question time? During a final dixer on penalty rates, Amanda Rishworth has a
  go at her opposition counterpart Tim Wilson: We know the shadow minister loves
  grandstanding. Perhaps to distract from the truth and perhaps to distract from
  his lack of competence … The opposition asks Rishworth to withdraw the comment
  on competence. Tony Burke says that the house would “basically be ending
  debate if we could not have discussions about somebody’s competence in this
  place”. Milton Dick decides Rishworth doesn’t have to withdraw her comment.
  She ends her answer and with that QT is over for another day (the second last
  for this sitting fortnight). Nationals MP asks about fuel tax credit system
  The Nationals MP Jamie Chaffey asks the prime minister if he’ll rule out any
  changes to the fuel tax credit system. The system provides businesses with
  credits for the fuel excise that’s paid in filling up vehicles such as
  machinery, equipment and heavy vehicles. The prime minister says the diesel
  tax rebate and system have been in place for “some time”. We have not changed
  anything. He then goes to the Coalition’s opposition of the government’s
  top-up tax cuts and asks if they’ll introduce their own private bill to repeal
  them. Chaney asks why National Reconstruction Fund isn’t moving faster to
  invest Kate Chaney gets the next crossbench question, and asks about why the
  $15bn National Reconstruction Fund isn’t moving faster to invest in projects
  when the government is trying to get to net zero by 2050. Pat Conroy
  (representing the minister for industry, Tim Ayres) says that he’s “delighted”
  to inform the house that since it was established less than two years ago, the
  NRF has made nine investments worth over $430m. That’s still less than 3% of
  the fund. Conroy says: The NRF has invested $200m in rare earths, which will
  deliver the rare earth minerals essential for renewables and the energy grid
  of the future. These investments will ramp up over time but, as I said, the
  fund was established less than two years ago. This is only one part of this
  government’s commitment to seizing the opportunities from global race to net
  zero. Opposition returns to energy price debate Back to the opposition and
  we’re back on the energy price debate (not that it’s been getting particularly
  far). The new Liberal member for Monash, Mary Aldred, asks the question. She
  says the PM said on 22 July that energy prices are going down, but Australia’s
  fourth largest energy retailer has said prices are going up for Victorian
  families by 4%. Chris Bowen takes the question, and immediately disregards the
  question, instead attacking Angus Taylor, who delayed making public key
  information about energy price rises before the 2022 election. You can barely
  hear anything because the opposition is shouting, and tries to make a point of
  order on relevance. Milton Dick tells them to stop adding their own commentary
  at the beginning of their questions, which gives the minister space to offer
  their own commentary. Bowen continues, saying thousands of households are
  saving money through the government’s home battery scheme. Police are
  investigating people in Australia and offshore over Melbourne synagogue
  attack, Burke tells parliament Josh Burns, a Jewish Labor MP, asks the next
  dixer, asking the home affairs minister, Tony Burke, what actions have been
  taken in respect of the investigation into the Adass Israel synagogue attack.
  Burke says one 21-year-old man was arrested today, and that police are
  investigating not only people in Australia but criminals offshore as well.
  Burke thanks the more than 200 members of the counter-terrorism team
  investigating the arson attack. More than a week after the attack and you
  could still smell the smoke as though it was fresh. And you could still see it
  at your feet the rubble of the building which had been burnt … Not widely
  known but in the week following the attack, the prime minister had raised with
  me that the rabbi was on a temporary visa and his family which was soon to
  expire … I took on behalf of the government the most deliberate action you can
  take which was that week to make him and every member of his family permanent
  residents of Australia, to say they belong. Sussan Ley stands up after Burke
  to also thank the officers, and says she shares the government’s concerns
  about antisemitism seen in Australia. Boele asks what is Labor’s plan to phase
  out fossil fuels The independent MP for Bradfield, Nicolette Boele, who beat
  the Liberal candidate Gisele Kapterian by just a handful of votes, gets the
  next crossbench question. She says the “Climate Council has advised that
  Australia’s 2035 climate target will not be credible and this includes a
  commitment to an orderly phase-out of fossil fuel use reduction and exports”.
  So what’s the government’s plan to phase out fossil fuels? Chris Bowen says we
  “can’t wish away fossil fuels” and the best thing to do is to build more
  renewables. You simply cannot say that we can phase out fossil fuels or fossil
  fuel exports and make a difference unless you are working with countries to
  reduce their use of fossil fuels. A third question goes to Chris Bowen on the
  $275 energy bill promise – this time it comes from the deputy Nationals
  leader, Kevin Hogan. Bowen’s speaking at lightning speed, basically recapping
  everything he just said, and tries to needle the Coalition on its promises on
  energy in the lead-up to the election. The manager of opposition business,
  Alex Hawke, stands up to make a point of order, but Bowen speeds up his last
  sentence by an extra 10% and sits down before Milton Dick can allow Hawke to
  speak. Dan Tehan is up again, and asks more directly if the government still
  stands by its commitment to reduce energy bills by $275. Chris Bowen gets up
  again and says that modelling was done in 2021 (which earns a roar from the
  opposition benches who have been asking this question for the last three
  years). Energy prices have fallen, as I just said, by 6.2% in the year just
  gone and they would know that that was not inevitable, they would have been
  16.6% higher if the honourable member had his way in energy bill relief not
  being applied, that was the key difference. Tehan gets up with a point of
  order, and Milton Dick says Bowen should stick to what the government is doing
  (and not stray into criticising opposition policy). Bowen says the government
  commits to reducing energy prices by bringing more renewable energy online and
  delivering home batteries. Coalition asks if Labor still stands by 2022
  election promise to cut energy bills by $275 Back to the house, the shadow
  energy minister, Dan Tehan, asks Chris Bowen about whether the government is
  still committed to its 2022 election promise to reduce energy bills by $275,
  when prices have gone up more than $1,300 for some households over the last
  three years. Bowen’s answer is short – he says today’s CPI figures, which he
  says Tehan conveniently didn’t refer to in his question, show energy prices
  are down 6.2% in the year to June. He says it’s due to the government’s energy
  bill relief and that households could save up to $1,300 by installing a home
  battery under the government’s policy. Penny Wong has accused the Coalition of
  being “divorced from reality” after Michaelia Cash asked the Albanese
  government to rule out recognising Palestinian statehood while Hamas is in
  control of Gaza. During Senate question time today, Cash asked the foreign
  affairs minister if the government would “categorically rule out ever
  recognising a Palestinian state while Hamas is in control of Gaza” amid
  commitments from France and the UK in the last week. Wong said the Albanese
  government condemned Hamas and pointed out that conversations with other
  nations in the Middle East were focused on reform of the Palestinian Authority
  and the demilitarisation of Hamas. Countries have made clear that they want
  the security architecture in the Middle East to assure the security of Israel.
  This is where the international community is at … This is where the discussion
  is, senator, and this is where the government is engaging … if we want
  long-term peace and security in the Middle East, for both Israelis and
  Palestinians alike, then we need to deal with the issue of a Palestinian
  state. That is the best way to ensure stability and peace for both Israelis
  and Palestinians alike. So, senator, I would suggest to you it might be good
  to grapple with that reality, because that is where the discussion is. Cash
  repeated the question, to which Wong replied: People should understand in this
  place just how out of touch the Coalition is on this. They don’t even support
  a ceasefire, which the whole world, including President Trump supports … that
  says something about the extent to which your position is divorced from the
  reality of what is happening on the ground, what is happening for people In
  the Middle East and what is happening to the women and children of Gaza who
  are, no, they are not all Hamas … Le asks why Labor hasn’t reversed
  Coalition’s Job-ready Graduates scheme The first question from the crossbench
  comes from Dai Le, who asks about why the government hasn’t reversed the
  controversial Job-ready Graduates scheme, which was introduced under the
  Morrison government. She says many students in her western Sydney electorate
  studying arts degrees have been unfairly disadvantaged by the scheme. Albanese
  says the government’s legislation to cut Hecs debt by 20%, which will reduce
  both university and Tafe debts, will help students in her seat, as well as the
  extension of fee-free Tafe courses. The final report from the University
  Accord states that the scheme “failed to meet its objectives” and recommended
  urgent reform. Albanese doesn’t say anything about whether the scheme will be
  reformed, but says the government is “focused on the issues that people in her
  [Le’s] electorate and electorates like hers are most concerned about”. Sussan
  Ley is back up again and has taken umbrage with Jim Chalmers calling the
  latest inflation data “outstanding”, when the price of eggs has increased by
  34% and bread has increased by 18% over the last three years. She calls
  Chalmers “out of touch”, which the speaker, Milton Dick, is not having, and
  tells Ley to withdraw that descriptor. I don’t think Chalmers is unhappy about
  the question – as Ley says, he’s been calling the numbers outstanding, and he
  says it a few more times in his answer. When we came to office that food
  inflation was running at 5.9%. And now it is about half of that: 3.0%. If the
  member for Farrer is unhappy about food inflation, she must be absolutely
  livid at the underperformance of her own government, the government she was a
  cabinet minister in. Because when we came to office, inflation had a six in
  front of it and it was absolutely galloping. Chalmers says he “hopes” the
  opposition keeps asking about inflation because the data is “very
  encouraging”. He does still acknowledge that there’s more to do on cost of
  living. The first dixer is on the social media ban (again, no surprises here,
  the government uses dixers to promote its policies). Anthony Albanese says a
  lot of similar lines as he did in his press conference earlier. PM angers
  opposition with Medicare ‘green and gold’ jibe While the protesters were
  shouting, Sussan Ley asked her first question to the prime minister. She
  starts on bulk-billing rates, saying that the PM has said on 71 occasions that
  seeing a GP is free, but the facts state differently. She cites data from the
  Australian Institute of Health and Welfare that Australians paid more than
  $166m in out-of-pocket costs to see a GP in May. Anthony Albanese says the
  government is strengthening Medicare, to increase the bulk-billing rate. He
  then decides to have a bit of the go at the opposition, and this line gets
  them pretty incensed. This is an important part of the reform agenda where
  Labor not only created Medicare but we will always work to strengthen it. I
  know it annoys those opposite to see this little bit of green and gold. Green
  and gold the same colour our athletes proudly wear … Ley tries to stand up
  with a point of order but then Albanese continues, and says that the
  government values Medicare. In a different part of the public gallery, there
  are four people standing up with posters shouting “sanction Israel now”. Other
  members of the public in that area are being cleared out so parliament
  security can get to the protesters. They keep shouting “sanction Israel now”
  until they exit the public gallery. The opposition leader, Sussan Ley, also
  acknowledges the former Olympic athletes in the chamber today. She says the
  decision for some athletes not to compete in the 1980 Moscow Olympics came
  with a “personal cost”. We would not send athletes to Olympics in Moscow today
  and the Australian government was right to support a boycott then. That
  decision, correct as it was, takes nothing away from the Australians who did
  compete. They should not be personally attacked, they should never have been
  personally attacked. I repeat to you in the gallery today, you made Australia
  proud. Before questions begin, Albanese acknowledges the group of 1980
  Olympians sitting in the gallery. Today in our parliament we honour your
  contribution to our nation. We recognise your participation but importantly as
  well we recognise your pain. And we extend that recognition to all those who
  cannot be with us today. Forty-five years ago, the Soviet Union’s invasion of
  Afghanistan cast a dark shadow over what should have been your shining moment.
  As nations around the world grappled with the boycott, Australia’s athletes,
  some still only teenagers, were placed in an incredibly difficult position.
  Anthony Albanese has formally acknowledged 121 athletes who defied the
  government and competed under a neutral flag at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow.
  There’s a cohort of that group who have been in parliament to mark the
  occasion and some are sitting in the public gallery to watch question time
  today. Across from them is the former Olympian Dan Repacholi, a Labor MP,
  who’s also wearing his Olympics blazer in the chamber today! Do you have any
  questions for Back to Back Barries? Folks, we are on the downhill slide to
  question time (today’s moving quick!) but before we get there we ask … Do you

  Barrie Cassidy joins former Liberal advisor and pollster Tony Barry to pull

  some to answer on this week’s episode, out this Saturday. Angus Taylor says
  Gaza situation ‘tragic’ but recognising Palestinian state ‘putting the cart
  before the horse’ Angus Taylor says the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is
  “tragic” but Australia cannot recognise Palestine until Hamas is removed from
  Gaza and Israeli hostages are returned. The shadow defence minister told Sky
  News on Wednesday afternoon the choice to recognise Palestinian statehood
  right now was “putting the cart before the horse”. The UK prime minister, Keir
  Starmer, has committed to recognising Palestine by September unless Israel
  abides by a ceasefire in Gaza and commits to a two-state solution. It follows
  French president Emmanuel Macron‘s decision earlier to recognise Palestine at
  the UN general assembly in September. Australia joined 14 other countries this
  morning to describe the recognition of Palestine as “an essential step towards
  the two-state solution”. Anthony Albanese, however, declined to commit to a
  timeline for recognition of statehood, saying the government was looking at
  the “circumstances where recognition will advance the objective of the
  creation of two states”. Since Labor was elected in 2022, the foreign affairs
  minister, Penny Wong, has adjusted Australia’s language on the peace process,
  saying the “pathway out of the endless cycle of violence” in the Middle East
  can only come with recognition of “a Palestinian state alongside the State of
  Israel”. Australia had previously seen Palestinian statehood as a final step
  of a negotiated outcome between Israelis and Palestinians. Asked whether the
  starvation of Gaza was a contributing factor for the Coalition to reconsider
  its current policy on the timing of a two-state solution between Israel and
  Palestine, Taylor said: It’s clearly tragic. But as I say, you’ve got to
  remember the origins of what’s going on here, which ... was this attack by
  Hamas. We still have, of course, hostages being held. They haven’t been
  released. This is another prerequisite for getting to a peace agreement, and
  we’re not there. Australia could ‘win the quantum race’, Atlassian co-founder
  says Staying with Scott Farquhar at the Press Club, the Atlassian co-founder
  says Australia has an opportunity to dominate in quantum technology. “We won’t
  win the race for AI chips in the near future in Australia,” he said, but “we
  could win the quantum race”. He said Australia has a “huge opportunity” to win
  when it comes to building data centres, not least because of its proximity to
  South-East Asia – and only if “we can get legislation right”. He added that
  Australia also had the opportunity to succeed in software, including
  business-to-business AI applications. Atlassian co-founder says his children
  have ‘very defined screen time’ Over to the Press Club in Canberra, where Tech
  Council of Australia chair and Atlassian co-founder Scott Farquhar is now
  taking questions after his speech focused on an AI future. For any parents
  struggling with navigating screens and online safety for their children, the
  tech heavyweight says his three school-age children have “very defined screen
  time” and that he makes sure he is aware of what they are viewing. “We spend
  time with our kids together and educate them about age-appropriate things they
  need to be worried about on the internet, in the same way we educate them
  about crossing the road,” he said. He said he spends time looking at what his
  children are spending time on and then, at “every stage, when they adopt a new
  platform, we spend time chatting with them about the dangers and the
  opportunities of that platform.” The New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, has
  been asked about claims by a member of his own government that he overstepped
  his authority by ruling out a protest involving a march across the Sydney
  Harbour Bridge. (We covered the comments made by upper house Labor MP Stephen
  Lawrence here, who said it is a matter for the police, not the state.) Minns
  responded that his point, in ruling it out, was purely to do with the route
  and not the protest itself. He said that closing down the bridge for such an
  event is “a logistical and communications Everest”. He said: I do appreciate
  and I completely recognise that many Australians are very concerned, very
  concerned about the humanitarian aid crisis in Gaza, as well as human rights
  for Palestinians. I’m not dismissing that. I’m not suggesting that the motives
  of the protesters are wrong or misplaced. I completely accept that many people
  living in New South Wales would want to protest this international situation.
  My point, and it’s an important one, is that to close down the Harbour Bridge,
  which has happened maybe two or three times in a decade, is a logistical and
  communications Everest. It’s incredibly difficult to do. And I understand that
  some people say, ‘look, it’s easy to shut down the bridge.’ It’s not easy.
  When it happens for a marathon, it’s nine to 12 months in the planning. It
  doesn’t happen overnight. Chalmers says economy is ‘softer than we would like’
  Jim Chalmers says “the economy is softer than we would like”, which he blamed
  on “a period of higher interest rates”, global uncertainty linked to Trump’s
  trade war, and the ongoing pressure on households from high living costs. The
  treasurer’s comments at a press conference in Parliament House this morning
  come after fresh figures showed inflation fell to 2.1% in the year to June,
  from 2.4% in March. “We need to get the economy growing quicker (and) in a
  more sustainable way,” he said, acknowledging that there has been “some
  softening around the edges of the labour market”. We are attentive to those
  cyclical issues - weaker growth, getting on top of inflation - but we’re also
  increasingly focused on the bigger structural issues. Analysts are now locking
  in a Reserve Bank rate cut at the next board meeting on 11-12 August. Stephen
  Smith, a partner at Deloitte Access Economics, said the inflation number
  “shows Australia’s policy settings must shift from containing inflation to
  stimulating economic growth”. Smith said that interest rates at current levels
  were “hard to justify given ongoing global economic volatility and the
  continued sluggishness of our own domestic economy”. Lawyers for the
  billionaire WiseTech founder Richard White are hoping to quash a subpoena to
  produce any communications with the former partner of New South Wales MP Mark
  Latham, Nathalie Matthews. Nicholas Olson, appearing for White in a court
  hearing on Wednesday, foreshadowed the application and said he would seek a
  suppression order on the material. There was also an application to set aside
  a subpoena directed at Matthews regarding the communications. Latham’s lawyers
  have sought the material under subpoena as part of his defence against a
  Domestic Violence Order (DVO) application Matthews has made against Latham and
  after texts reportedly between Latham and Matthews allegedly referring to
  White were published by the Australian newspaper earlier this month. White is
  not accused of any wrongdoing. Latham’s defence is seeking to have the DVO
  application lodged by Matthews set aside. The matter is scheduled to return to
  court on 6 August for a further mention. Among the allegations Matthews has
  made in documents filed with the court are that Latham intimidated her and
  forced her into demeaning sexual acts. Latham has strenuously denied the
  allegations. Latham is also facing a censure motion in the NSW upper house
  over unrelated matters when the state parliament sits next week. The Coalition
  says it has “serious concerns” about the government recognising a Palestinian
  state “outside of a proper two-state process”. The government has said
  recognition does not have to come at the end of a peace process with Israel.
  Shadow foreign minister Michaelia Cash has said in a statement that
  recognition cannot happen “with Hamas still in control of Gaza”, and that
  Australia should “not reward” Hamas with a pathway to statehood. The Coalition
  has been consistently clear that there can be no recognition of a Palestinian
  state with Hamas still in control of Gaza, and Hamas can have no role in
  governing a Palestinian state. The Albanese Government should explain to
  Australians why it is canvassing recognition of a Palestinian state while
  there are still hostages in tunnels under Gaza. This is a moment for
  international leaders to be applying maximum pressure on the listed terrorist
  organisation Hamas to immediately and unconditionally release all remaining
  hostages and disarm. The opposition has abstained from voting on its senator
  Sarah Henderson’s amendment to the Hecs bill – which would cap indexation at
  3%. The Senate is currently debating the bill and voting on several amendments
  – one by Henderson, and several by the Greens, which have so far been voted
  down by the government. Henderson, who was dumped from Sussan Ley’s
  frontbench, went at it alone when announcing this week that she would push the
  government to cap the indexation rate. The four One Nation senators, Tammy
  Tyrrell, David Pocock and Ralph Babet voted with Henderson. The government and
  Greens senators voted against it, meaning it didn’t get up. Cost-of-living
  pressures continue despite drop in inflation As we wrote below, inflation has
  dropped all the way to 2.1% in the year to June, from 2.4% in March. But it’s
  not all good news. The ABS’s consumer price index climbed by 0.7% in the three
  months, as electricity prices jumped by 8.1% in the quarter, after
  taxpayer-funded energy bill subsidies rolled off in Perth and Brisbane.
  Michelle Marquardt, the ABS’s head of prices statistics, said “while
  electricity was up this quarter, it’s down 6.2% compared to 12 months ago as
  rebates remained in place for most capital cities”. The annual inflation rate
  was below the 2.2% consensus forecast among economists, thanks in large part
  to a 10% drop in petrol prices over the year, according to the ABS. There are
  still plenty of signs of cost-of-living pressures, even if the trajectory is a
  positive one. Rents were up 4.6% versus a year ago (from 5.5% in March), and
  insurance 3.9%. Breakfast costs are also higher than this time last year: egg
  prices are up 19% thanks to bird flu outbreaks, while tea and coffee costs are
  9% higher thanks to major issues in overseas coffee bean-growing regions, the
  ABS said. Jim Chalmers says the latest inflation figures are “very encouraging
  news” but won’t predict whether it’ll result in a rate cut at the next Reserve
  Bank board meeting. The treasurer is speaking to Sky News (and will be doing a
  press conference shortly), and gives himself a bit of a pat on the back for
  how much inflation has dropped since Labor was first elected in 2022. These
  are pretty stunning numbers. When you consider when we came to office,
  inflation had a six in front of it. Now it’s around a third of that very, very
  encouraging development … No doubt the Reserve Bank board will weigh that up.
  Tsunami threat warnings for Papua New Guinea, New Zealand and Fiji after
  earthquake off Russia There are tsunami threat warnings for several countries
  near Australia including Papua New Guinea, New Zealand and Fiji. There are no
  warnings for Australia. We’ll keep you updated, or you can follow the
  Guardian’s live blog on the tsunami here: Inflation dropped to 2.1% in the
  year to June, from 2.4% in the year to March, as further evidence of waning
  underlying price pressures paves the way for a Reserve Bank rate cut next
  month. The Australian Bureau of Statistics’ quarterly report also showed the
  RBA’s preferred measure of inflation, which removes more volatile price
  movements, dropped to 0.6% in the three months to June. That lowered the
  annual “core” rate from 2.9% to 2.7%. The RBA board’s decision to hold the
  cash rate at 3.85% earlier this month came as a shock to investors and
  analysts, with the majority of the monetary policy board voting to hold fire
  until they had further confirmation that inflation was tracking as anticipated
  towards the 2.5% target. Economists leading into this morning’s release said
  that a quarterly underlying inflation rate of 0.7% or less would provide that
  comfort. The prospect of a rate cut on 12 August will be welcomed by mortgaged
  homeowners struggling with ongoing cost of living pressures, but less so by
  those hoping to buy a home amid resurgent property prices. June quarter’s
  inflation figures to be released at 11.30am The countdown is on for the
  11:30am release of June quarter’s inflation figures, which should determine
  whether the Reserve Bank cuts rates next month. Michele Bullock, the RBA
  governor, has signalled that she and her board were waiting on further
  evidence that inflation is tracking sustainably towards the mid-point of the
  2-3% target range, and this morning’s consumer price report should provide
  that comfort (or not). Economists predict inflation will fall from 2.2% in the
  year to June, from 2.4% in March. Surely that alone is enough for a rate cut?
  Not so fast. The RBA targets the “headline” inflation rate, but it leans on
  underlying measures which remove more volatile price movements (often for
  things such as petrol and fruit and vegetables) to guide its policy decisions.
  The so-called “trimmed mean” rate of inflation was 2.9% in the year to March.
  Analysts reckon the underlying rate needs to come in at 0.7% in the three
  months to June – or below – to lock in a rate cut. That would lower the annual
  pace to 2.7%. Is YouTube a social media network? YouTube issued a statement
  overnight saying it should be exempt from the social media ban because it’s a
  video-sharing platform, not social media. But if you search “is YouTube a
  social media network” on Google, YouTube’s parent company, its AI overview bot
  says … yes it is. The overview states: “While [YouTube] is primarily known as
  a video-sharing platform, it also facilitates user interaction, content
  creation and community building, which are core characteristics of social
  media.” Google says its AI overview provides an “AI-generated snapshot with
  key information and links to dig deeper”, so it’s not reflecting what Google
  actually thinks. Needless to say, it’s a bit funny. Coalition accuses Labor of
  breaking promise over YouTube under-16s ban The Coalition is accusing the
  government of a “blatant broken promise” over including YouTube in the
  under-16s social media ban, after the video service was previously exempt
  under the draft rules. The shadow communications minister, Melissa McIntosh,
  alleges Labor “deliberately misled the public” over the move, in a statement.
  [This is] a blatant broken promise to the Australian people … When the
  government introduced the legislation in November, they specifically excluded
  YouTube. This was the premise on which the legislation passed the parliament.
  McIntosh noted the government had issued media releases setting out the
  YouTube carveout, and had written to Google promising the same. But after
  advice from the eSafety commissioner, the government has changed its mind. The
  Coalition back the under-16s restrictions, but McIntosh is unhappy with the
  YouTube issue. The Albanese Labor government can change a minister, but they
  cannot hide the fact they deliberately misled the public at the last election
  by promising to keep YouTube out of the social media age minimum. The prime
  minister and the Labor government reaffirmed YouTube’s exemption before the
  election … It makes you question what has really changed behind the scenes in
  the government on this issue, and whether it was an election stunt. IMF
  upgrades Australia’s economic growth outlook The International Monetary Fund
  has upgraded its outlook for the Australian and global economy thanks to a
  “modest decline in trade tensions” after Donald Trump failed to follow through
  on the worst of his tariff threats. In an overnight update to its April world
  economic outlook, the IMF forecasts Australian GDP will rise by 1.8% this
  year, and 2.2% in 2026. The estimates were 0.1 and 0.2 percentage points
  higher, respectively, than the forecasts three months ago. The IMF in
  particular noted the de-escalation of trade tensions with China in May, which
  reduced the effective tariff of imports into the US from 24% to 17% - the
  highest in 90 years. Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF’s chief economist,
  said “this resilience (in the global economy) is welcome, but it is also
  tenuous”. While the trade shock could turn out to be less severe than
  initially feared, it is still sizeable, and evidence is mounting that it is
  hurting the global economy.” Compared to the IMF’s pre-April and pre-trade war
  forecast, global growth is expected to grow 0.2 percentage points more slowly.
  Gourinchas said": At around 3%, global growth remains disappointingly below
  the pre-Covid average. Albanese ends the press conference stressing that
  Australians don’t want the conflict brought here. My priority has been to try
  and navigate what is a very difficult situation but, you know, the young
  Jewish boy or girl going to the local school should not be harassed because of
  who they are. They are not responsible for what is going on in Gaza. And Arab
  Australians or Muslims are not responsible for what Hamas did. He says the
  media also has a responsibility not to stoke tensions in the community.
  Albanese not surprised Aukus review taking US longer than 30 days Albanese
  says he’s not surprised that the US is delaying the completion of its Aukus
  review until Australia’s spring. The office of the US under secretary of
  defence for policy, Elbridge Colby, released a statement on X a short time
  ago, stating the review would be completed in the US fall, and that it would
  engage with the UK and Australia during that review. Albanese says: We
  expected a review from an incoming government just like the Keir Starmer
  government did it. We expect that those things take longer than just 30 days.
  ‘Sometimes out of a crisis comes a moment of opportunity to actually advance
  forward’ Albanese is asked whether the government will place more sanctions on
  Israel, and accuses those calling for more sanctions of just using “slogans”.
  He says the government is “about meaningful action” and lambasts protesters
  who caused his electorate office to be shut down on Friday. There’s been a lot
  of comparison between the number of sanctions on Russians, compared to
  Israelis, but Albanese says Israel is democratic, while Putin’s regime is not.
  Pushed further on his comments that Hamas should not have a role in a future
  Palestinian government, Albanese is asked what that means for senior
  bureaucrats that have been involved in the Palestinian health administration.
  Albanese says the government is “not at that point of detail”. Clearly one of
  the things that the Palestinian Authority have said is to speak about a
  demilitarised Palestinian state. What that implies is not just no military in
  the conventional sense but also obviously no paramilitary. If people are
  serious, and I’ve been serious about the rights of Palestinians and them
  having justice since, you know, well before I came to this place … One of the
  things that I’ve said … is that sometimes out of a crisis comes a moment of
  opportunity to actually advance forward, in a real way, advance forward for
  Israelis and Palestinians. Albanese asked about recognising Palestinian state
  On to other issues, Albanese is asked whether the government is now looking at
  a specific timeframe for recognising a Palestinian state. Albanese says
  there’s not a timeline, but specific circumstances to enable that to happen.
  He says he spoke to Keir Starmer overnight, and expects to speak with the
  British PM again in the coming days. We’ve signed another statement today with
  many nations. That statement, I think, has a number of things in it are
  important. Asked whether Starmer declaration on statehood has influenced
  Albanese’s thinking, the prime minister the world is “continuing to engage
  with each other” formally and informally. The world was horrified by the
  terrorist act and the atrocities committed by Hamas on 7 October. The world
  looks on what is happening in Gaza and expresses that it is unjustified and it
  is a tragedy, the ongoing loss of innocent life. ‘My government is pro
  Wiggles’: Albanese This morning Wells said Wiggles management tried to appeal
  to the government to allow YouTube to be exempt from the ban. She says they
  told her that YouTube is a video platform, not a social media platform – the
  same argument a spokesperson for YouTube made in a statement overnight. Wells
  clarifies that it was Wiggles management, not the actual Wiggles, who made the
  appeal, and Albanese adds” “We’re not here to sledge the Wiggles. My
  government is pro Wiggles.” Wells also said a bit earlier that in terms of
  age-restrictive content, it should be up to the social media companies to
  explain why kids might have access to that content. Wells on implementing
  social media band: ‘The onus here is on the platforms’ Albanese says the
  government will be holding an event at the UN General Assembly later this year
  with the 36 months and the Let Them be Kids campaigns to advocate for the
  social media ban. This legislation is the first of its kind worldwide, but
  Albanese says other nations are looking at what Australia is doing and
  considering the impact social media is having on their kids. Our own Josh
  Butler asks Wells what “reasonable steps” to reduce harm means, and when the
  public will know what verification measures the platforms will implement.
  Wells says the platforms are working on a one-on-one basis with the eSafety
  commissioner, but doesn’t clarify what “reasonable steps” should be. Each
  platform works differently. Obviously they’re all competitors. That means they
  need to work on a one on one basis with the eSafety commissioner. But I think
  reasonable steps is reasonable. We are backing parents. The platforms have a
  responsibility, a social responsibility, as the PM would say, the onus here is
  on the platforms. Come 10 December, if your kid has a Facebook account, it is
  on Facebook to deactivate that account. It’s not on the parent to police that
  on behalf of Facebook. Albanese says even if children find ways to access
  social media, the ban will still make a difference Albanese says that just
  because children may get around the ban, doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be done. We
  know this is not the only solution, and there’s more to do, but it will make a
  difference. We know as well that there are those who will say young people
  will find their way around it. That’s not a reason to stop the other laws that
  we put in place about alcohol consumption or about purchasing of tobacco. The
  latest decision to include YouTube in the ban is a result of advice from the
  eSafety commissioner. Anika Wells says the government can’t ignore evidence
  that “four out of 10 Australian kids report that their most recent harm was on
  YouTube.” She adds that the government won’t be “intimidated” by social media
  companies and says the regulations are about prioritising “parents ahead of
  platforms”. As parents, we are really trying our best when it comes to the
  internet, but it is like trying to teach your kids to swim in the open ocean
  with the rips and the sharks compared to at the local council pool, we can’t
  control the ocean, but we can police the sharks, and that’s why I will not be
  intimidated by leaving threats when this is a genuine fight for the wellbeing
  of Australian kids. Prime minister Anthony Albanese and communications
  minister Anika Wells are standing up for a press conference this morning, on
  the decision to include YouTube in the social media ban for children under 16.
  YouTube kids will still be exempt. Albanese starts by recognising three
  parents who are with him, all who have lost a child. Mia, Rob and Emma are
  three parents, but their stories are felt by countless other parents and by
  communities right across the country. We know that social media is doing
  social harm, and my government and this parliament is prepared to take action
  to protect young Australians. Tsunami alert issued for Pacific islands and
  Japan after earthquake off Russia Leaving parliament again for a moment,
  there’s a tsunami warning for the Pacific after an earthquake off the
  north-east coast of Russia. According to the US weather service, there is a
  “potential threat” warning for Russia and Japan. There is also a “watch” alert
  for Hawaii. There’s no sign yet of any danger south of the equator. You can
  stay updated at our live blog: Two Australians on board a boat intercepted by
  Israeli troops earlier this week have been deported from Israel and are on
  their way back to Australia, according to their lawyers. Tania “Tan” Safi and
  Robert Martin were detained on Monday while onboard the ship Handala, which
  was attempting to reach Gaza with aid as part of the Freedom Flotilla
  Coalition. Adalah Legal Center, a Palestinian legal rights group, said the
  pair were among a number of activists who have been deported so far, with the
  remainder of the 21 people detained expected to be deported in the coming
  days. Adalah said in a translated statement: Australian activists Robert
  Daniel Martin and Tania Safi were transferred to Jordan and are scheduled to
  depart on July 30 via a flight that includes a stop in Dubai before arriving
  in Australia. Adalah said those left in detention were continuing an
  open-ended hunger strike after their detention: According to testimonies
  collected by Adalah’s field team during today’s visit, the activists continue
  to be subjected to harsh and degrading detention conditions and are continuing
  an open-ended hunger strike for the fourth consecutive day in protest against
  their unlawful arrest and detention conditions. Dfat has been approached for
  comment. Staying with Lawrence’s comments, he said it is “rarely, if ever, the
  role of the state to prevent mass protests, and that it is the “obligation of
  the state to facilitate, support and make safer such events.” Lawrence also
  said he has given repeated warnings in parliament about since October 2023
  about “the risk of violence on our streets if attempts are made by the
  executive government to unreasonably prevent peaceful mass protests.” The
  management of this planned protest should be left entirely to NSW Police, who
  should be allowed to make an independent and principled decision according to
  law. A member of Chris Minns’ government has said he is concerned the New
  South Wales premier tainted the police’s decision on whether to facilitate a
  proposed protest that would involve marching across the Sydney Harbour Bridge,
  arguing that it was not within his authority to do so. On Tuesday afternoon,
  the deputy police commissioner, Peter McKenna, said police had rejected an
  application from organisers of a protest, citing safety risks as the reason.
  The organisers of the rally, the Palestine Action Group, have vowed to fight
  the decision in the supreme court. It came after Minns had said on ABC Sydney
  Radio that the mass protests relating to Gaza would not be allowed on the
  Harbour Bridge under “any circumstances”. The upper house Labor MP Stephen
  Lawrence, who is also a barrister, said he was “extremely concerned” by these
  comments. He wrote in a statement on social media: This detailed [NSW]
  statutory regime as I understand it gives no substantive role to the premier
  in deciding whether authorisation is given. I am concerned the premier has in
  effect made a purported decision himself to try and prevent this protest, that
  this will taint proper consideration of the matter by police and that violence
  may ensue as a consequence. I have felt the need to give these warnings
  because an environment has been created by senior political leaders, Labor and
  conservative, hostile to protests concerned with the rights of Palestinian
  people. US review of Aukus to be completed late this year, Pentagon policy
  chief says The Aukus review is expected to be completed late this year, the US
  has said in a statement on X. The statement is from the office of the under
  secretary of defence for policy, Elbridge Colby, and states that the
  department working on the review will engage with Australia and the UK. It
  doesn’t add a whole lot of new information, but does confirm that the review
  will take longer than its initial 30-day timeframe. The new statement says: As
  part of this process the department looks forward to continuing regular
  engagements on this important matter with other parts of the US government,
  the US congress, our other allies Australia and the United Kingdom, and other
  key stakeholders. The department anticipates completing the review in the
  fall. The fall, or autumn, in the US is between late September and late
  December. Australia has signed a new joint-statement of 15 foreign ministers,
  including France and Canada, on Gaza, expressing their “unwavering commitment”
  to a two-state solution. It states that the nations, ahead of the UN General
  Assembly meeting in September: Have already recognised, have expressed or
  express willingness or the positive consideration of our countries to
  recognise the State of Palestine, as an essential step towards the two state
  solution, and invite all countries that have not done so to join this call.
  The statement condemns the 7 October attack, and demands an immediate
  ceasefire, immediate and unconditional release of all hostages of Hamas and
  calls for ensuring unhindered humanitarian access. The statement also
  “welcomes the commitments made by the President of the Palestinian Authority”
  on 10 June, including where the president condemned the 7 October attacks,
  called for the liberation of hostages and disarmament of Hamas, and committed
  to “call for elections within a year to trigger generational renewal”. It was
  signed by the foreign ministers of: Andorra, Australia, Canada, Finland,
  France, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal,
  San Marino, Slovenia and Spain. Recognising Palestinian statehood would end
  Hamas’s authority in Gaza, Husic says The Labor MP Ed Husic says Australia
  joining with countries including France and the UK to recognise Palestinian
  statehood would end Hamas’s power in Gaza. One of the major stumbling blocks
  for countries considering statehood is the role of the terrorist organisation,
  which was responsible for the 7 October attacks on Israel and still holding
  hostages. But Husic, who says other members of Labor’s caucus want action from
  the Albanese government, says moving on statehood will deny Hamas authority.
  “Hamas is built largely on grievance,” Husic says. That grievance gets removed
  with the establishment of a state of Palestine, nurtured with the cooperation
  and support of the international community, progressed through the development
  of democratic institutions. And that would champion the delivery of
  humanitarian aid to nourishing … children. On backbench discussions about the
  war and next steps from the international community, Husic said he wanted
  Labor MPs to make their own statements. We have been talking. Colleagues have
  been considering this, across the backbench. There is a deep feeling within
  the caucus, about how right it is to recognise Palestine, and I would much
  rather that colleagues speak for themselves. Leaving federal politics for a
  moment, the Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, and attorney general Sonya
  Kilkenny are holding a press conference at parliament to announce privately
  owned bail services will be banned in the state. As part of the bail bill
  announced yesterday, commercial operators will no longer be able to provide
  monitoring services. It a similar move by the NSW government in May, after
  private operator BailSafe collapsed I earlier this year, without notifying
  authorities. It led to a mad scramble to locate about 20 alleged offenders on
  bail in NSW and eight in Victoria. Allan says: We saw the situation earlier
  this year where a private company, BailSafe, shut up shop. They didn’t tell
  anyone across the justice system, the courts, Victoria police, and that’s just
  absolutely unacceptable. When that happened, I was determined that we would
  stamp out the use of private companies in the provision of electronic
  monitoring here in this state. Australia can build momentum on Palestinian
  recognition: Husic Speaking in the press gallery corridor, the Labor MP Ed
  Husic says Australia should move with the UK to recognise Palestinian
  statehood. Husic says “moral momentum cannot be ignored” and has implored the
  government to “reconsider its approach” to recognising a Palestinian state. I
  would urge our government to reconsider its approach. We can still maintain
  that we have conditions that we believe need to be satisfied, the least of
  which is the build up of democratic institutions within the state of
  Palestine, the demilitarisation of Hamas, for example. But we can flag our
  preparedness to join with both France and the UK to signal our commitment to
  recognise Palestine. Now it is important that that occur. I believe it’s
  critical that we back them in and build a sense of international momentum. ‘A
  question of when, not if’ – government MPs on Palestinian recognition In
  response to the UK government declaring it could recognise Palestine as a
  state in September, unless Israel takes immediate steps towards peace,
  government ministers have said this morning that the question for Australia is
  “when, not if”. Earlier when Anika Wells spoke to ABC News Breakfast, she said
  there are still things to be worked through to get to a two-state solution. It
  is a question of when not if. There is things to work through. We need Hamas
  to release the hostages and we need to secure aid as quickly as possible.
  Everybody is working on that. Over on Sky News, Julian Hill offered similar
  remarks. The government will determine its position based on our conception of
  Australia’s national interest, working with like-minded countries around the
  world, and the PM is in dialogue. [It’s] a question of when, not if, to
  recognise the state of Palestine Anthony Albanese is a “Seinfeld prime
  minister”, says shadow foreign minister Michaelia Cash, over the governments
  response to Trump foreshadowing higher tariff rates of up to 15 to 20%. Why
  Seinfeld? It’s a show about nothing, so “stop being a show about nothing” says
  Cash. On a panel with Clare O’Neil on Sunrise earlier, Cash said Albanese had
  still failed to get a face-to-face meeting with Trump since he was elected.
  Other countries [are] meeting, they are successfully negotiating trade deals
  that benefit their countries. We now hear it could go 15%, it could go 20%. Mr
  Albanese needs to stop being the Seinfeld prime minister, stop being a show
  about nothing, step up, get a meeting with President Trump, and advocate on
  behalf of Australians. O’Neil says the comments from Cash are “really rude and
  disrespectful” and the opposition should have a team Australia view. She says
  the government is working calmly and working through the appropriate channel
  to get the “best deal”. We will manage this not with some of the kind of
  flamboyant language Michaelia used there. We will manage it in a calm and
  considered way. That is how our government restored our relationship with
  China, France all the countries that were left by the way side by the
  opposition. Wells says she ‘can’t ignore’ new eSafety evidence about YouTube
  Anika Wells says she can’t ignore new evidence from the eSafety commissioner
  that more than a third of kids have experienced harm online “at the hands of
  YouTube”. The communications minister is speaking to ABC News Breakfast and
  says YouTube will need to work with the eSafety commissioner to change its
  platform in response to the social media ban. She says YouTube needs to stop
  users being able to access age-restrictive in a logged-out state. Fresh
  evidence from the eSafety commissioner that 37% of kids had their most recent
  or most impactful online harm at the hands of YouTube. That is evidence that I
  can’t ignore and they are joining the ban. Kids who are under 18 will find a
  way to smoke. There [are] kids who are under 16 who will find a way around
  this but it is about making a positive impact. We would rather kids work out
  who they are before social media platforms assume who they are. Shadow
  education minister on Naplan results: ‘We need to look at what it is we are
  teaching’ The opposition says the latest Naplan results aren’t a “cause for
  particular celebration” but there are positive signs. Shadow education
  minister Jonno Duniam told ABC News Breakfast earlier that the gap between
  regional, remote and metro and other disadvantaged students including
  Indigenous children is “very concerning”. Duniam says it might be time for a
  relook at the curriculum. Under our federated system, where no one should be
  worse off because of where they live or any other particular attribute, some
  are falling behind, which needs addressing. We are falling behind and we have
  been for a long period of time. This is not just a now problem, this has been
  for decades. We need to look at what it is we are teaching. Clare on Naplan
  results: ‘Good news, but there’s still more work to do’ The government says
  there are encouraging signs from the latest Naplan school results. Two thirds
  of students have achieved a “strong” or “exceeding” proficiency level, but for
  the first time since 2017, numeracy results improved across years five, seven
  and nine. In a statement, education minister Jason Clare said there are still
  more improvements to be made: The improvements in literacy and numeracy are
  good news, but there’s more work to do. That’s what the new agreements we’ve
  now signed with every state and territory are all about. Paterson says
  Australia should not push to recognise Palestinian state at this time
  Opposition frontbencher James Paterson says Australia shouldn’t join the UK in
  pushing to recognise the state of Palestine this year. On RN Breakfast,
  Paterson says Australia recognising a Palestinian state before Hamas is
  dismantled would be “counterproductive”. It’s not for me to comment on the
  foreign policy of other countries, but if the Australian government was to
  make a similar move, I wouldn’t agree with it. Asked whether the images out of
  Gaza are evidence of starvation of its population, Paterson said there are
  “credible reports of that”. Premature recognition of a Palestinian state
  before Hamas has been dismantled, before the Palestinian Authority recognises
  Israel’s right to exist, before they give up their aims of using terrorism to
  abolish the Israeli state, I think would be extremely counterproductive.
  There’s certainly credible reports of that [widespread starvation]. I’m not on
  the ground and I can’t independently assess it. But I think very clearly there
  is very serious suffering happening in Gaza. He went further than his leader
  Sussan Ley yesterday who declined to say wouldn’t say there was evidence of
  starvation during a press conference yesterday. But says he’s still “cautious”
  in not wanting to “endorse claims that are made by Hamas” while observing the
  “very serious humanitarian situation”. ‘I’ve got sharp elbows’: Wells on any
  potential legal action by Google Asked about whether she’s concerned about
  potential legal action from Google, Wells says she’s got “sharp elbows”. We
  have had threats come in. But look, I’ve got sharp elbows. This is too
  important for us not to have a crack. They are world leading laws. While
  social media has a place persuasive and predatory algorithms do not. And
  that’s what we’re cracking down on. Wells says the laws will not be set and
  forget, and the social media platforms will have to work with the eSafety
  commissioner to figure out how to put the new restrictions in place. The
  communications minister, Anika Wells, says “parents, we have your backs” in
  announcing her decision to include YouTube in the social media ban. Wells told
  the Today Show the laws “aren’t infallible” but it’ll be up to the platforms
  to take reasonable steps to stop children being on them. When they find their
  way around this, because we know that kids will, god bless them, the platforms
  [need to] take reasonable steps to mitigate that from happening and to correct
  errors. These laws aren’t infallible, none are but this is about the chilling
  effect [of social media]. And there’s a study that asked kids who are 16, 17,
  18, ‘do they wish that they had not gotten on social media as early as 13?’
  And they all said, yeah, they regret it. Wells said that Google sent the
  Wiggles management team to try to “persuade” her on the decision. This was Big
  Wiggle. This was Wiggles Inc, the management around the Wiggles … The Wiggles
  are a treasured Australian institution. But like I said to them, you’re
  arguing that my four-year-old twins right to have a YouTube login is more
  important than the fact that four out of 10 of their peers will experience
  online harm on YouTube. Liberal senator says YouTube decision represents a
  ‘broken promise’ The Liberal senator Paul Scarr says the decision to reverse
  YouTube’s exemption from the social media ban could amount to a “broken
  promise”, but won’t say whether or not including it in the ban is the right
  decision. Over on Sunrise, Scarr and Greens leader Larissa Waters have been
  reacting to the news overnight. There is a lot of harmful content out there.
  But the fact of the matter is the legislation, when it was first passed by the
  parliament, specifically excluded YouTube, and now the government appears
  ready to change their position in that respect. And that’s a broken promise.
  Scarr says the party will take a “careful” look at the regulations, and it’s
  important to “get the balance right” between protecting children and freedom
  of speech and privacy. Waters says the bans aren’t going to work, and the
  social media giants should do better to make the content on their platforms
  safer. Kids are so tech savvy, they’re going to find a way around these bans.
  These bans are not going to work. So what we actually need to do is to make
  those platforms safer and safer, not just for kids but for anyone who’s
  accessing them. And I think that’s where the responsibility should be on the
  big tech companies. They’re getting off scot-free right now. Ted O’Brien says
  government has ‘questions to answer’ on YouTube decision The opposition is
  critical of the government’s backflip to include YouTube in the social media
  ban, saying Labor has “questions to answer” over the decision. Deputy
  opposition leader Ted O’Brien says his party will wait and see what rules the
  government puts forward for the ban, which are expected to be tabled to
  parliament today. On Sky News, O’Brien says the government “failed” to flag
  that it would put the ban on YouTube, after the eSafety commissioner offered
  advice to do so. They [the government] were silent on the possibility that it
  would be brought in… and so let’s wait and see what they table. The eSafety
  commissioner’s advice needs to be scrutinised. I make the point they failed to
  tell the Australian people about this before the election. Good morning,
  Krishani Dhanji here with you, thanks to Martin Farrer for getting us started.
  The government will be discussing its decision this morning to include YouTube
  in its social media ban for under 16s – though the more tightly curated
  YouTube kids will be spared. And this morning the UK has increased pressure on
  Israel, declaring it will recognise a Palestinian state later this year unless
  Israel takes urgent steps to commit to peace. We’ll be following all local
  reaction to that this morning. Stay with us, it’s going to be another busy
  day! Google has reacted to the government’s decision to include YouTube in the
  under-16s social media ban (though YouTube kids will be exempt). The search
  engine giant says it will “consider next steps”, after it threatened to sue
  the government over the weekend if it was included in the ban, before the
  decision was announced. A spokesperson for YouTube said in a statement that
  the platform is “not social media”. We share the Government’s goal of
  addressing and reducing online harms. Our position remains clear: YouTube is a
  video sharing platform with a library of free, high-quality content,
  increasingly viewed on TV screens. It’s not social media. The Government’s
  announcement today reverses a clear, public commitment to exclude YouTube from
  this ban. We will consider next steps and will continue to engage with the
  Government. Chris Bowen was also asked on 7.30 for his reaction to the
  decision by the UK prime minister to recall his cabinet from their summer
  break for an emergency meeting on the Gaza crisis. Asked if Australia, as a
  middle power, would join a joint effort to ensure more aid gets into Gaza,
  Bowen said: I think the best thing I can do, Sarah, is very warmly and
  strongly and positively point you to the prime minister’s comments. One, his
  abhorrence at what has been happening in Gaza in recent times, his
  condemnation of that action and his statements about Australia’s role in the
  pathway going forward. A sensible pathway for Australia to work towards the
  recognition of Palestine at the right time but also his abhorrence at the
  breaches of international law. There is a high degree of coordination between
  Australia and like-minded countries, or middle powers, as you correctly put
  it. There is a very high degree of coordination there and you should expect
  that to continue. Now, I’m not going to comment on the details of what Keir
  Starmer may or may not be doing because that’s a matter for the United
  Kingdom. Obviously, we would respond in due course. Chris Bowen: ‘Anybody can
  set a high target with no plan to get there’ The minister for climate change
  and energy, Chris Bowen, appeared on ABC’s 7.30 last night and was asked about
  calls by a top UN official for Australia to go “big” on its 2035 emissions
  reduction target. Simon Stiell, who is visiting several countries ahead of the
  Cop30 climate conference in Brazil in November, said in a speech in Sydney on
  Monday the 2035 target would be a defining moment for Australia. He urged the
  government to not pick a “bog-standard” number but to “go for what’s smart by
  going big”. Bowen said: We have a very rigorous process [and] world’s best
  practice for setting a climate target. We agree a good, strong target is good
  economic policy and it also has to be achievable, a target we can set out and
  achieve. Anybody can set a high target with no plan to get there. That’s not
  the approach our government has taken and not the approach we’ll take in the
  future. Just one in seven Australians back Israel’s actions in Gaza, poll
  shows Guardian Australia’s Essential poll is out this morning, and the top
  line is the public’s general scepticism over whether they will ever see the US
  deliver a nuclear submarine to the Australian navy. But as always the poll
  asked a range of questions. Other interesting results include: Only 15% of
  Australians believe Israel is justified in continuing its military action in
  Gaza. Some 41% of voters want Israel to permanently withdraw its military
  action, while 25% want a temporary ceasefire. 31% of voters say Australia
  should consider levelling our own tariffs on the US, while 45% say we should
  prioritise staying on good terms with Trump and keep negotiating for
  exemptions. You can read the full story here: More from Sarah on last night’s
  Senate motion. Liberal frontbencher, Maria Kovacic, stood to speak in support
  of the motion, saying that while it was important to protect children from
  online harm, “ensuring every adult logs into an account to browse the internet
  is taking the esafety commissioner’s power to a new level, which must be
  debated and scrutinised further”. Corinne Mulholland, a newly elected Labor
  senator, questioned why senators would be against a law that “helps to prevent
  illegal content from spreading by restricting access to and the distribution
  of harmful content”. To me, it all makes just common sense, so I’m not sure
  why it’s so controversial ... The most ludicrous thing is wasting our time in
  the Senate when we can be getting on with the real business of debating
  legislation. Read more here: The Senate voted last night to pass an urgency
  motion against new rules requiring search engines, such as Google, to
  undertake user identity checks by the end of the year. To refresh your memory,
  the previous parliament passed rules banning under-16s from many social media
  sites. As a result, a number of platforms are now required to verify a user’s
  age by the end of the year with a federal government trial of age assurance
  systems still underway. Put forward by United Australia Party senator Ralph
  Babet on Tuesday night, the urgency motion read: “The need to recognise that
  the internet search engine services online safety code, which requires age
  assurance measures for account holders of search engines, must be amended as
  it represents another layer of digital surveillance, dressed up as child
  protection and raises many privacy issues.” It was supported by the Coalition,
  the Greens, One Nation and other crossbenchers – including David Pocock, Lidia
  Thorpe and Fatima Payman – with only Labor senators opposing it. The final
  vote was 38 ayes and 25 noes. Good morning and welcome to our live politics
  blog. I’m Martin Farrer with the best of the overnight stories before Krishani
  Dhanji picks it up. There was some evening activity in the Senate last night
  as senators voted to pass an urgency motion against rules requiring search
  engines, such as Google, to undertake user identity checks by the end of the
  year. More details coming up. Chris Bowen appeared on 7.30 last night when he
  was grilled about climate policy but also about the UK government’s decision
  to hold an emergency cabinet meeting about Gaza. The energy minister played
  that question with a straight bat but the fact that the UK has announced
  overnight that it will recognise Palestine unless Isrel agrees a truce will
  increase calls today for Australia to follow suit. More coming up. Plus the
  latest Essential poll shows that barely one in seven Australians back Israel’s
  military action in Gaza. More on that soon too.

It’s time to wind down our lives news coverage for the day. Here’s what’s been keeping us busy: Australia signed a new joint-statement of 15 foreign ministers, including France and Canada, on Gaza, expressing their “unwavering commitment” to a two-state solution. The Labor MP Ed Husic says Australia joining with countries including France and the UK to recognise Palestinian statehood would end Hamas’s power in Gaza. The Coalition, meanwhile, said it had “serious concerns” about the government recognising a Palestinian state “outside of a proper two-state process”. A motion calling Israel’s aid blockade of Gaza a breach of international law and placing pressure on the Albanese government to ramp up pressure against Israel passed the Senate after Labor and the Greens teamed up. The Zionist Federation of Australia revealed it was “deeply troubled” by the starvation crisis gripping Gaza and urged Israel to ensure sufficient aid flows to Palestinian civilians “without delay”. The NSW premier said a pro-Palestinian protest on Sydney Harbour Bridge would be a “logistical and communications Everest”. Inflation dropped to 2.1% in the year to June, from 2.4% in the year to March, as further evidence of waning underlying price pressures paves the way for a Reserve Bank rate cut next month. Jim Chalmers called the data “stunning”. Google reacted to the government’s decision to include YouTube in the under-16s social media ban (though YouTube kids will be exempt), saying the platform was “not social media”. Finally, what does a tech giant do when it comes to screen time at home? Scott Farquhar’s children have “very defined screen time” and he makes sure he is aware of what they are viewing, he said. As ever, a big thank you for joining us. We’ll be back with more breaking news tomorrow from 7am. Reality TV star’s trial delayed The trial of reality TV star Matt Wright on charges of attempting to pervert the course of justice after a fatal outback helicopter crash has again been delayed. The February 2022 crash killed Wright’s friend and Outback Wrangler TV show co-star Chris “Willow” Wilson, who was hanging from a sling under the chopper on a mission to collect crocodile eggs, AAP reports. A jury was set to be chosen on Thursday. But in the supreme court in Darwin on Wednesday, acting Justice Alan Blow rescheduled the empanelment for 5 August. It ensures the jury will be selected after a long weekend, with 4 August marking the Picnic Day public holiday in the territory. The start of the trial has been delayed several times and pre-trial legal argument before Blow is set to continue this week. A motion calling Israel’s aid blockade of Gaza a breach of international law and placing pressure on the Albanese government to ramp up pressure against Israel has passed the Senate this evening after Labor and the Greens teamed up. Following a pause for some first speeches in the upper house, the motion’s speaker list resumed at 6pm with three more Greens senators and was agreed to on the voices by the remaining Labor and Greens senators in the chamber. The Coalition noted their disagreement but did not call for a division. The motion’s final wording stated: Israel’s aid blockade, which risks mass death from starvation in Gaza and millions of Palestinians facing catastrophic hunger, is a breach of international law, and that it is critical the Australian government continue intensifying its efforts including diplomatic and further action to pressure the Israeli government to open all border crossings and allow the unimpeded flow of humanitarian aid. Labor Friends of Palestine: PM’s comments belittling, misleading and disrespectful The Labor Friends of Palestine campaign group has criticised Anthony Albanese’s comments today downplaying the prospect of further sanctions on Israel over its military campaign in Gaza, saying his comments dismiss the sentiments of many inside the Labor movement. Asked at a press conference about levelling further sanctions on Israel, Albanese responded: “What we haven’t done is go for slogans, frankly … which is the sanction that you would like?” The government has already put targeted financial and travel sanctions on two Israeli ministers. Albanese shrugged off further sanction calls, saying “what we are about is meaningful action, not slogans”. But many inside the Labor party are calling for sanctions. Victorian Labor’s state conference will debate, and is expected to pass, a motion from rank-and-file members urging further sanctions on Israel and the recognition of the state of Palestine. Labor Friends of Palestine has circulated similar motions, supported by 80 (and climbing) local ALP branches. Peter Moss, co-convener of the Labor Friends of Palestine, said in a statement: The Prime Minister’s comments today belittling the campaign for sanctions as ‘slogans’ are misleading and disrespectful to thousands of Labor Party members. The Prime Minister and the government are well aware of the overwhelming support for sanctions that are clearly defined in a motion passed by more than 80 Labor Party units in recent weeks. Labor Party members around Australia voted for ‘sanctions on the Israeli individuals and entities who are responsible for ongoing breaches of international humanitarian law in Gaza, including the use of starvation as a weapon’. The Prime Minister should not dismiss or distort the strongly held views of Labor Party members who worked hard for the re-election of his government. The Zionist Federation of Australia has revealed it is “deeply troubled” by the starvation crisis gripping Gaza and has urged Israel to ensure sufficient aid flows to Palestinian civilians “without delay”. The federation said it is the “collective moral obligation” of Israel and the United Nations to address the humanitarian crisis in a statement on Wednesday, which was first reported by the Nine newspapers. The group’s president, Jeremy Leibler, said: Our humanity also compels us to recognise the pain and suffering of innocent Palestinian civilians in Gaza. We are deeply troubled by the reports of hunger in parts of Gaza. We call upon Israel, the United Nations and their counterparts to do everything within their power to ensure that sufficient humanitarian aid flows to Palestinian civilians without delay. That is their collective moral obligation. Leibler continued: We welcome that Israel is taking steps to facilitate the distribution of more aid, including undertaking daily pauses in its operations, and opening new aid corridors. We reiterate that ultimate responsibility for this humanitarian situation lies with Hamas – it started this war, refuses to release the hostages, refuses to accept a ceasefire agreement, deliberately steals aid to fund its war machine and sabotages its distribution. It is essential that Hamas returns to negotiations and accepts the hostage exchange and ceasefire agreement that is on the table, and ultimately, is removed from power in Gaza. Fate of plan to convert Queensland’s Olympics villages into affordable housing uncertain Queensland’s Olympics villages may not become affordable housing after the end of the games. Under the previous Labor government, a minimum of 20% of the athletes’ villages were to be set aside as affordable housing. But parliamentary estimates heard on Wednesday that the new government had no specific target. The director general of state development, infrastructure and planning, John Sosso, said “the exact percentage will be a subject of negotiation” but would “play an appropriate role in the housing stock”. The deputy premier, Jarrod Bleijie, also revealed that the state government was considering selling the land beneath the Gabba cricket ground – which is set to be demolished – to fund the new 17,000-seat Brisbane live arena next door. He said: We would never say we would never say no to an arena if the private sector needs a deal to be done with the land. The one thing the state does have is the land. The one thing the state does have is the powers of planning and the levers to be pulled to unlock that infrastructure.

Police said emergency services were called at about 2pm to D-Block Road, Balranald, about 130km west of Hay, after reports of a light plane crash. A man, found in a critical condition, was treated by paramedics at the scene but could not be revived. The man, believed to be in his 50s, is yet to be formally identified, police said in a statement. Police said the crash site had been secured as a crime scene. A report will be prepared for the coroner and an investigation into the cause of the crash will be undertaken by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. Doctor turned politician and Israel ally says ‘no words’ to describe Gaza suffering The final speaker on the Greens’ motion on Gaza is Michelle Ananda-Rajah, a Labor senator who visited Israel during her first term as a Labor MP in the previous parliament. Ananda-Rajah, a doctor turned politician, spoke of her experience in Israel after the 7 October attacks, describing it as “another level of atrocity and depravity that I’ve never experienced before”. But the self-described ally of Israel said the situation in Gaza had “distressed” her. She continued: Right now, the people of Gaza are suffering. There is a humanitarian catastrophe. There are no words left any more in our lexicon to describe what is going on there. It is unconscionable that children should be starving. It should be. It is unconscionable that pregnant mothers cannot deliver, that there is no anaesthesia, painfulness, insufficient antibiotics … Israel has, I should say, the Netanyahu government has really not articulated to the global community what the political solution is to this … Because not only are [the Netanyahu government] bringing Israel into disrepute, and further isolated, there is an unconscionable stain on this country’s, I fear, history with the deaths of so many people disproportionately. And I say this as an ally of Israel. My Jewish community know who I am. They know how hard I fought for them, and I will continue to do so, but there must be a better solution to this conflict here. The motion’s speeches were suspended while fresh senators delivered their first speeches. It’ll resume later this evening. Lidia Thorpe: government ‘has the power to take real action’ on Gaza The independent senator, Lidia Thorpe, spoke to support the Greens’ motion on Gaza, saying the crisis “didn’t happen overnight” despite the “sudden concern” of the Albanese government. Each time this government stays silent, Israel is given the green light to carry on its genocide, knowing they can get away with it. Strongly worded emails and sharpened criticism of Israel’s actions are not enough to hold Israel accountable. This government has the power to take real action and put an end to the mass murder of Palestinians. The Palestinian population is on the brink of complete annihilation as its genocide enters its final iteration, we demand urgent action before it’s too late. Labor to move amendment to Greens’ Gaza motion The Labor senator Tim Ayres has spoken on the Greens’ urgency motion, largely repeating comments made by the prime minister and foreign affairs minister previously. Ayres starts out by outlining the government’s position: The position of the Australian government is very clear: every innocent life matters. We reiterate our call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire and the release of all of the remaining hostages. The government remains unequivocal in our condemnation of Hamas and its ongoing acts of terror. Gaza is in the grip of a humanitarian catastrophe. Israel’s denial of aid and the killing of civilians, including children seeking access to water and food, is indefensible. We call on Israel to comply immediately with its obligations under international law. Labor will move an amendment proposing to tweak some of the wording. It proposes the following statement: Israel’s aid blockade, which risks mass death from starvation in Gaza and millions of Palestinians facing catastrophic hunger, is a breach of international law. Cash ‘saddened’ about Gaza but Coalition won’t support Greens motion Following Mehreen Faruqi’s speech on the motion to urge the Albanese government to do more to pressure the Israeli government to “open all border crossings and allow the unimpeded flow of humanitarian aid”, the opposition Senate leader, Michaelia Cash, is ready to speak. Cash says the opposition will not be supporting the motion but says: Nobody wants to see the suffering of people in Gaza, and we are saddened and shocked like everybody at the loss of life in Gaza … The remainder of the speech centres heavily on Palestinian militant group Hamas rather than the ongoing humanitarian crisis, which has left much of Gaza’s population in starvation. She says: The Greens never seem to want to actually admit that the blame for this war lies squarely at the feet of the militant terrorist organisation Hamas. The Coalition, on the other hand, fundamentally believes that the moral responsibility for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is squarely on the terrorist group Hamas. Chair of parliament’s pro-Israel caucus has concerns about Australia’s ‘willingness’ to recognise a Palestinian state Andrew Wallace says a pro-Israel caucus has concerns around the Albanese government’s “willingness” to recognise a Palestinian state. The Liberal MP and chair of the Australia Israel Allies Caucus told the ABC a short time ago that the Coalition favoured a two-state, negotiated process between Israel and Palestinians “and we think that any attempt to try to bring unilaterally the recognition of a Palestinian state forward is really just rewarding Hamas for the attacks that it perpetrated on Israel on 7 October 2023”. He said Australia did not have to follow in the UK’s footsteps: The war could be over today if Hamas was to lay down its weapons, surrender, return the current 50 or so hostages that are still being held. Now to be talking about a Palestinian state at this point in time is still too early and it has to be done through a negotiated process. Just because the United Kingdom lands on a certain position doesn’t mean that Australia has to either. There’s no role for Hamas in a potential Palestinian state, Chalmers says Jim Chalmers says Anthony Albanese and Penny Wong are “making sure that there’s no role for Hamas” in a potential Palestinian state. The treasurer told the ABC a short time ago that he did not pay heed to Michaelia Cash’s comments that a Palestinian state should come only once peace had been reached in Gaza and was akin to a reward for Hamas. “Clearly an obstacle is … making sure that there’s no role for Hamas,” he said of plans around recognising a Palestinian state. He said the statement released by 15 countries, including Australia, was “really, really important” in that it denounced the terrorist act of 7 October, demanded a ceasefire, access for humanitarian workers and the release of the hostages, and called on countries to work towards recognition as part of progress towards a two-state solution. Chalmers said: From my point of view, personally and as a member of the government, there is real momentum here. That momentum, that progress, is welcome, but it’s also conditional. Over in the Senate, the Greens are moving a motion for a matter of public urgency on Gaza. The Greens senator Nick McKim moves the motion, which reads: That the risk of mass death from starvation in Gaza, with millions of Palestinians facing catastrophic hunger, is a result of Israel’s aid blockade, and that it is critical the Australian government intensify its efforts – including diplomatic and economic measures – to pressure the Israeli government to open all border crossings and allow the unimpeded flow of humanitarian aid. First up to speak is Mehreen Faruqi. She says: It is brutal, it is inhumane and it is savage. We warned you all from the very beginning that this is where we will end up … but you flocked to defend Israel knowing they have long been killing, arresting, torturing and permanently injuring Palestinians for decades. Labor MPs, including members of this chamber, flocked to Israel for photo opportunities with genocidal Israeli soldiers … Here’s a clip of the Atlassian co-founder Scott Farquhar describing how he deals with screens and online dangers in the privacy of his own home. The father of three told the National Press Club his approach is to opt for strict screen time limits and to make sure he knows what his children are viewing. New select committee to take on climate change misinformation The Greens have passed an inquiry this afternoon into third-party and groups who peddle mis- and disinformation about climate and energy policy in Australia. The minor party gained the support of Labor and some crossbenchers to form a new select committee into how misinformation and disinformation related to climate change and energy is “financed, produced and disseminated”. The Select Committee on Information Integrity on Climate Change and Energy will also examine the links between Australian organisations and international thinktanks and influence networks that are known to spread mis- and disinformation. The final vote was 39 ayes to 28 noes. One Nation and the United Australia party senator Ralph Babet joined with the Coalition to vote against the inquiry. Google scraps Parliament House event amid debate on under-16s social media ban Google has scrapped at the last minute a major showcase event in Parliament House on the day the Labor government decided to include YouTube in its social media ban. As we reported on the weekend, the “Google at Parliament House” event was to go ahead tonight, with popular YouTube creators and Australian band the Rubens among the entertainment. A large number of politicians and staffers attend the event each year. The event was being put together inside parliament’s Great Hall today – passersby could hear the musicians sound-checking. But in an email to attenders this afternoon, Google said the event would be postponed. “Out of respect for grieving families who have gathered in Parliament House today, we have decided to postpone the annual Google at Parliament House event,” the email read. It continued: We apologise for the late notice, and appreciate your understanding. We will be in touch with a new date as soon as possible. It appeared to be a reference to the families involved in the 36 Months campaign who Anthony Albanese and the communications minister, Anika Wells, met today and who had been pushing for the under-16s social media ban after their children lost their lives following issues with social media like bullying.

New South Wales police said the 56-year-old was with four male wedding guests when the minibus he was travelling in collided on Mount View Road and veered down an embankment shortly after 10.30. The groom was seriously injured and taken by air to John Hunter hospital. A member of his wedding party was also seriously injured, the Hunter Valley district commander, Supt Steve Laksa, told reporters. The four other minivan occupants were taken to the same hospital, where the male driver underwent mandatory blood and alcohol testing. An investigation by crash investigators was under way. Brisbane Olympics swimming venues to cost taxpayers $1.2bn A new national aquatic centre plus another swimming project planned for the 2032 Brisbane Olympics will cost the taxpayer $1.2bn. The aquatic centre – to be built in central Brisbane – will be the long-term home for four swimming sports and host 25,000 spectators during the Games. The Games Independent Infrastructure and Coordination Authority interim CEO, Nick Elliott, revealed the estimate at a state parliamentary estimates hearing. It also includes an upgrade of the Chandler pool, he said. All games venues are to be built within a $7.1bn cap, according to the state government. Government witnesses confirmed that the figure included any debt financing through public-private partnerships. The largest venue, a new stadium at Victoria Park, is budgeted to cost $3.785bn alone. A project validation report for it is due to be completed next year, Elliott said.

Wells mentioned in a press conference earlier today it wasn’t individual Wiggles, but “it was the black skivvies, it was Wiggles Inc, it was Wiggles management”. In a response provided to Guardian Australia, a Wiggles HQ spokesperson said “there are no black skivvies worn at Wiggles HQ”. The group was not paid by YouTube to lobby on their behalf to stay out of the ban, with Wiggles HQ stating it was providing an “independent perspective” to Wells on the ban as children’s content creators: Video platforms like YouTube, when used to watch trusted children’s programs, function differently to social media. Millions of Australian parents (including Minister Wells) and their children watch The Wiggles on YouTube much like they would on smart TVs, not as part of a social media feed. Thank you, Krishani Dhanji. I’m Daisy Dumas, here to keep you company for the remainder of the afternoon. Let’s get going. A big thanks for following along on the blog with me today, I’ll leave you with the lovely Daisy Dumas for the rest of the afternoon. I’ll see you here first thing tomorrow morning – with plenty of caffeine in hand! Hanson-Young says government must legislate a duty of care for big tech It’s “delulu” to believe big tech companies will do the right thing about the government’s under-16s social media ban without being legally required to, the Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young says. At a press conference shortly before question time, the Greens’ communications spokesperson urged the federal government to legislate a duty of care for social media companies, noting users could still view content on social media sites without logging in. The idea that there’s going to be two classes of safety is ridiculous. The companies need to be legally held responsible. So the first thing is a duty of care, requiring these companies to uphold a duty of care to their customers, to their users. The second thing is to make sure they’re licensed so that that duty of care is enforceable. Just hoping that these big social media companies will do the right thing is delusional. It’s delulu to think that Google will just do the right thing. They need to be forced to do it. Tl;dr: here’s what we learned in question time today Before question time could properly start, a small group of protesters were shouting “sanction Israel now” up in the public gallery. They were promptly escorted out by security. The opposition started again on bulk-billing rates today, but then put several questions to Chris Bowen on energy prices increasing. He said the latest inflation data shows energy inflation has started going down – which didn’t satisfy those on the opposite side of the chamber, who argue that households are still paying huge bills. Tony Burke provided an update to the house on the work of police investigating the arson attack on the Adass Israel synagogue in Melbourne, which happened in December last year. And Dai Le asked why the government hasn’t yet scrapped or amended the Job-ready Graduates scheme – the government wouldn’t say. The disgraced New South Wales MP Gareth Ward has been remanded in custody to await sentencing after he was convicted last week for serious sex offences involving two young men. Justice Kara Shead said she was “unpersuaded” that Ward, because of his profile or disabilities, cannot be managed in a custodial setting. The MP for Kiama, aged 43, had been permitted to remain on bail after last week’s verdict under strict bail conditions requiring him to remain at either his residence on the south coast or his flat in Sydney. The prosecutor, Monika Knowles, applied to the NSW district court today to have Ward jailed, noting that due to the seriousness of the crimes that Ward has been convicted of there was virtually no chance he would avoid a custodial sentence when sentencing took place. On Friday a jury found Ward guilty of three counts of indecent assault and one count of sexual intercourse without consent. The lesser convictions carry a maximum penalty of five years and the more serious rape conviction a maximum penalty of 14 years. Ward’s barrister, Edward Anderson, had argued Ward was at particular risk due to his high profile as a politician. He also expressed concern about whether his visual impairment due to his albinism would put him at risk. Ward is close to legally blind and requires technological support to read and write. Shead said there were procedures in place to ensure that his devices could be required. Ward is due to be sentenced on 19 September. Labor ‘looking at’ NT funding in response to reintroduction of spit hoods, minister says The federal government is “looking at” commonwealth funding arrangements with the Northern Territory in response to the reintroduction of spit hoods for 10-year-old incarcerated children, the Indigenous affairs minister, Malarndirri McCarthy, says. In Senate question time, the independent senator Lidia Thorpe asked the minister whether action would be taken against states and territories that reintroduce measures, including spit hoods and restraint chairs. The use of spit hoods across the country ceased after Australia formally endorsed a United Nations protocol against torture and inhumane punishments in 2017. McCarthy conceded it was “very tough”, given there were “no actual penalties in that agreement” for those who choose not to follow it. She said she was considering a call by some NT land councils to restrict commonwealth funding in response to the decision made by the territory’s Country Liberal party government. McCarthy said: The difficulty here, Senator Thorpe, is that nearly 80% of the Northern Territory budget comes from the commonwealth, so we have to be responsible in our response to the Northern Territory, but we also have to be responsible to all citizens of the Northern Territory, who receive that, and I am looking at those numbers, and I am looking at those links in terms of the federal agreements, but not just for the Northern Territory. This also has to be about the federal agreements and the communications that we have with all states. The minister said attorneys general from around the country would discuss the issue next month in a meeting. Can you question a member’s competence in question time? During a final dixer on penalty rates, Amanda Rishworth has a go at her opposition counterpart Tim Wilson: We know the shadow minister loves grandstanding. Perhaps to distract from the truth and perhaps to distract from his lack of competence … The opposition asks Rishworth to withdraw the comment on competence. Tony Burke says that the house would “basically be ending debate if we could not have discussions about somebody’s competence in this place”. Milton Dick decides Rishworth doesn’t have to withdraw her comment. She ends her answer and with that QT is over for another day (the second last for this sitting fortnight). Nationals MP asks about fuel tax credit system The Nationals MP Jamie Chaffey asks the prime minister if he’ll rule out any changes to the fuel tax credit system. The system provides businesses with credits for the fuel excise that’s paid in filling up vehicles such as machinery, equipment and heavy vehicles. The prime minister says the diesel tax rebate and system have been in place for “some time”. We have not changed anything. He then goes to the Coalition’s opposition of the government’s top-up tax cuts and asks if they’ll introduce their own private bill to repeal them. Chaney asks why National Reconstruction Fund isn’t moving faster to invest Kate Chaney gets the next crossbench question, and asks about why the $15bn National Reconstruction Fund isn’t moving faster to invest in projects when the government is trying to get to net zero by 2050. Pat Conroy (representing the minister for industry, Tim Ayres) says that he’s “delighted” to inform the house that since it was established less than two years ago, the NRF has made nine investments worth over $430m. That’s still less than 3% of the fund. Conroy says: The NRF has invested $200m in rare earths, which will deliver the rare earth minerals essential for renewables and the energy grid of the future. These investments will ramp up over time but, as I said, the fund was established less than two years ago. This is only one part of this government’s commitment to seizing the opportunities from global race to net zero. Opposition returns to energy price debate Back to the opposition and we’re back on the energy price debate (not that it’s been getting particularly far). The new Liberal member for Monash, Mary Aldred, asks the question. She says the PM said on 22 July that energy prices are going down, but Australia’s fourth largest energy retailer has said prices are going up for Victorian families by 4%. Chris Bowen takes the question, and immediately disregards the question, instead attacking Angus Taylor, who delayed making public key information about energy price rises before the 2022 election. You can barely hear anything because the opposition is shouting, and tries to make a point of order on relevance. Milton Dick tells them to stop adding their own commentary at the beginning of their questions, which gives the minister space to offer their own commentary. Bowen continues, saying thousands of households are saving money through the government’s home battery scheme. Police are investigating people in Australia and offshore over Melbourne synagogue attack, Burke tells parliament Josh Burns, a Jewish Labor MP, asks the next dixer, asking the home affairs minister, Tony Burke, what actions have been taken in respect of the investigation into the Adass Israel synagogue attack. Burke says one 21-year-old man was arrested today, and that police are investigating not only people in Australia but criminals offshore as well. Burke thanks the more than 200 members of the counter-terrorism team investigating the arson attack. More than a week after the attack and you could still smell the smoke as though it was fresh. And you could still see it at your feet the rubble of the building which had been burnt … Not widely known but in the week following the attack, the prime minister had raised with me that the rabbi was on a temporary visa and his family which was soon to expire … I took on behalf of the government the most deliberate action you can take which was that week to make him and every member of his family permanent residents of Australia, to say they belong. Sussan Ley stands up after Burke to also thank the officers, and says she shares the government’s concerns about antisemitism seen in Australia. Boele asks what is Labor’s plan to phase out fossil fuels The independent MP for Bradfield, Nicolette Boele, who beat the Liberal candidate Gisele Kapterian by just a handful of votes, gets the next crossbench question. She says the “Climate Council has advised that Australia’s 2035 climate target will not be credible and this includes a commitment to an orderly phase-out of fossil fuel use reduction and exports”. So what’s the government’s plan to phase out fossil fuels? Chris Bowen says we “can’t wish away fossil fuels” and the best thing to do is to build more renewables. You simply cannot say that we can phase out fossil fuels or fossil fuel exports and make a difference unless you are working with countries to reduce their use of fossil fuels. A third question goes to Chris Bowen on the $275 energy bill promise – this time it comes from the deputy Nationals leader, Kevin Hogan. Bowen’s speaking at lightning speed, basically recapping everything he just said, and tries to needle the Coalition on its promises on energy in the lead-up to the election. The manager of opposition business, Alex Hawke, stands up to make a point of order, but Bowen speeds up his last sentence by an extra 10% and sits down before Milton Dick can allow Hawke to speak. Dan Tehan is up again, and asks more directly if the government still stands by its commitment to reduce energy bills by $275. Chris Bowen gets up again and says that modelling was done in 2021 (which earns a roar from the opposition benches who have been asking this question for the last three years). Energy prices have fallen, as I just said, by 6.2% in the year just gone and they would know that that was not inevitable, they would have been 16.6% higher if the honourable member had his way in energy bill relief not being applied, that was the key difference. Tehan gets up with a point of order, and Milton Dick says Bowen should stick to what the government is doing (and not stray into criticising opposition policy). Bowen says the government commits to reducing energy prices by bringing more renewable energy online and delivering home batteries. Coalition asks if Labor still stands by 2022 election promise to cut energy bills by $275 Back to the house, the shadow energy minister, Dan Tehan, asks Chris Bowen about whether the government is still committed to its 2022 election promise to reduce energy bills by $275, when prices have gone up more than $1,300 for some households over the last three years. Bowen’s answer is short – he says today’s CPI figures, which he says Tehan conveniently didn’t refer to in his question, show energy prices are down 6.2% in the year to June. He says it’s due to the government’s energy bill relief and that households could save up to $1,300 by installing a home battery under the government’s policy. Penny Wong has accused the Coalition of being “divorced from reality” after Michaelia Cash asked the Albanese government to rule out recognising Palestinian statehood while Hamas is in control of Gaza. During Senate question time today, Cash asked the foreign affairs minister if the government would “categorically rule out ever recognising a Palestinian state while Hamas is in control of Gaza” amid commitments from France and the UK in the last week. Wong said the Albanese government condemned Hamas and pointed out that conversations with other nations in the Middle East were focused on reform of the Palestinian Authority and the demilitarisation of Hamas. Countries have made clear that they want the security architecture in the Middle East to assure the security of Israel. This is where the international community is at … This is where the discussion is, senator, and this is where the government is engaging … if we want long-term peace and security in the Middle East, for both Israelis and Palestinians alike, then we need to deal with the issue of a Palestinian state. That is the best way to ensure stability and peace for both Israelis and Palestinians alike. So, senator, I would suggest to you it might be good to grapple with that reality, because that is where the discussion is. Cash repeated the question, to which Wong replied: People should understand in this place just how out of touch the Coalition is on this. They don’t even support a ceasefire, which the whole world, including President Trump supports … that says something about the extent to which your position is divorced from the reality of what is happening on the ground, what is happening for people In the Middle East and what is happening to the women and children of Gaza who are, no, they are not all Hamas … Le asks why Labor hasn’t reversed Coalition’s Job-ready Graduates scheme The first question from the crossbench comes from Dai Le, who asks about why the government hasn’t reversed the controversial Job-ready Graduates scheme, which was introduced under the Morrison government. She says many students in her western Sydney electorate studying arts degrees have been unfairly disadvantaged by the scheme. Albanese says the government’s legislation to cut Hecs debt by 20%, which will reduce both university and Tafe debts, will help students in her seat, as well as the extension of fee-free Tafe courses. The final report from the University Accord states that the scheme “failed to meet its objectives” and recommended urgent reform. Albanese doesn’t say anything about whether the scheme will be reformed, but says the government is “focused on the issues that people in her [Le’s] electorate and electorates like hers are most concerned about”. Sussan Ley is back up again and has taken umbrage with Jim Chalmers calling the latest inflation data “outstanding”, when the price of eggs has increased by 34% and bread has increased by 18% over the last three years. She calls Chalmers “out of touch”, which the speaker, Milton Dick, is not having, and tells Ley to withdraw that descriptor. I don’t think Chalmers is unhappy about the question – as Ley says, he’s been calling the numbers outstanding, and he says it a few more times in his answer. When we came to office that food inflation was running at 5.9%. And now it is about half of that: 3.0%. If the member for Farrer is unhappy about food inflation, she must be absolutely livid at the underperformance of her own government, the government she was a cabinet minister in. Because when we came to office, inflation had a six in front of it and it was absolutely galloping. Chalmers says he “hopes” the opposition keeps asking about inflation because the data is “very encouraging”. He does still acknowledge that there’s more to do on cost of living. The first dixer is on the social media ban (again, no surprises here, the government uses dixers to promote its policies). Anthony Albanese says a lot of similar lines as he did in his press conference earlier. PM angers opposition with Medicare ‘green and gold’ jibe While the protesters were shouting, Sussan Ley asked her first question to the prime minister. She starts on bulk-billing rates, saying that the PM has said on 71 occasions that seeing a GP is free, but the facts state differently. She cites data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare that Australians paid more than $166m in out-of-pocket costs to see a GP in May. Anthony Albanese says the government is strengthening Medicare, to increase the bulk-billing rate. He then decides to have a bit of the go at the opposition, and this line gets them pretty incensed. This is an important part of the reform agenda where Labor not only created Medicare but we will always work to strengthen it. I know it annoys those opposite to see this little bit of green and gold. Green and gold the same colour our athletes proudly wear … Ley tries to stand up with a point of order but then Albanese continues, and says that the government values Medicare. In a different part of the public gallery, there are four people standing up with posters shouting “sanction Israel now”. Other members of the public in that area are being cleared out so parliament security can get to the protesters. They keep shouting “sanction Israel now” until they exit the public gallery. The opposition leader, Sussan Ley, also acknowledges the former Olympic athletes in the chamber today. She says the decision for some athletes not to compete in the 1980 Moscow Olympics came with a “personal cost”. We would not send athletes to Olympics in Moscow today and the Australian government was right to support a boycott then. That decision, correct as it was, takes nothing away from the Australians who did compete. They should not be personally attacked, they should never have been personally attacked. I repeat to you in the gallery today, you made Australia proud. Before questions begin, Albanese acknowledges the group of 1980 Olympians sitting in the gallery. Today in our parliament we honour your contribution to our nation. We recognise your participation but importantly as well we recognise your pain. And we extend that recognition to all those who cannot be with us today. Forty-five years ago, the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan cast a dark shadow over what should have been your shining moment. As nations around the world grappled with the boycott, Australia’s athletes, some still only teenagers, were placed in an incredibly difficult position. Anthony Albanese has formally acknowledged 121 athletes who defied the government and competed under a neutral flag at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow. There’s a cohort of that group who have been in parliament to mark the occasion and some are sitting in the public gallery to watch question time today. Across from them is the former Olympian Dan Repacholi, a Labor MP, who’s also wearing his Olympics blazer in the chamber today! Do you have any questions for Back to Back Barries? Folks, we are on the downhill slide to question time (today’s moving quick!) but before we get there we ask … Do you have any questions about politics this week? Back to Back Barries is Guardian Australia’s political analysis podcast. Each week veteran political journalist Barrie Cassidy joins former Liberal advisor and pollster Tony Barry to pull apart the spin behind the strategies. And they want to hear from you. Send your politics questions to backtobackbarries@theguardian.com and they’ll pick some to answer on this week’s episode, out this Saturday. Angus Taylor says Gaza situation ‘tragic’ but recognising Palestinian state ‘putting the cart before the horse’ Angus Taylor says the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is “tragic” but Australia cannot recognise Palestine until Hamas is removed from Gaza and Israeli hostages are returned. The shadow defence minister told Sky News on Wednesday afternoon the choice to recognise Palestinian statehood right now was “putting the cart before the horse”. The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, has committed to recognising Palestine by September unless Israel abides by a ceasefire in Gaza and commits to a two-state solution. It follows French president Emmanuel Macron‘s decision earlier to recognise Palestine at the UN general assembly in September. Australia joined 14 other countries this morning to describe the recognition of Palestine as “an essential step towards the two-state solution”. Anthony Albanese, however, declined to commit to a timeline for recognition of statehood, saying the government was looking at the “circumstances where recognition will advance the objective of the creation of two states”. Since Labor was elected in 2022, the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has adjusted Australia’s language on the peace process, saying the “pathway out of the endless cycle of violence” in the Middle East can only come with recognition of “a Palestinian state alongside the State of Israel”. Australia had previously seen Palestinian statehood as a final step of a negotiated outcome between Israelis and Palestinians. Asked whether the starvation of Gaza was a contributing factor for the Coalition to reconsider its current policy on the timing of a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine, Taylor said: It’s clearly tragic. But as I say, you’ve got to remember the origins of what’s going on here, which ... was this attack by Hamas. We still have, of course, hostages being held. They haven’t been released. This is another prerequisite for getting to a peace agreement, and we’re not there. Australia could ‘win the quantum race’, Atlassian co-founder says Staying with Scott Farquhar at the Press Club, the Atlassian co-founder says Australia has an opportunity to dominate in quantum technology. “We won’t win the race for AI chips in the near future in Australia,” he said, but “we could win the quantum race”. He said Australia has a “huge opportunity” to win when it comes to building data centres, not least because of its proximity to South-East Asia – and only if “we can get legislation right”. He added that Australia also had the opportunity to succeed in software, including business-to-business AI applications. Atlassian co-founder says his children have ‘very defined screen time’ Over to the Press Club in Canberra, where Tech Council of Australia chair and Atlassian co-founder Scott Farquhar is now taking questions after his speech focused on an AI future. For any parents struggling with navigating screens and online safety for their children, the tech heavyweight says his three school-age children have “very defined screen time” and that he makes sure he is aware of what they are viewing. “We spend time with our kids together and educate them about age-appropriate things they need to be worried about on the internet, in the same way we educate them about crossing the road,” he said. He said he spends time looking at what his children are spending time on and then, at “every stage, when they adopt a new platform, we spend time chatting with them about the dangers and the opportunities of that platform.” The New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, has been asked about claims by a member of his own government that he overstepped his authority by ruling out a protest involving a march across the Sydney Harbour Bridge. (We covered the comments made by upper house Labor MP Stephen Lawrence here, who said it is a matter for the police, not the state.) Minns responded that his point, in ruling it out, was purely to do with the route and not the protest itself. He said that closing down the bridge for such an event is “a logistical and communications Everest”. He said: I do appreciate and I completely recognise that many Australians are very concerned, very concerned about the humanitarian aid crisis in Gaza, as well as human rights for Palestinians. I’m not dismissing that. I’m not suggesting that the motives of the protesters are wrong or misplaced. I completely accept that many people living in New South Wales would want to protest this international situation. My point, and it’s an important one, is that to close down the Harbour Bridge, which has happened maybe two or three times in a decade, is a logistical and communications Everest. It’s incredibly difficult to do. And I understand that some people say, ‘look, it’s easy to shut down the bridge.’ It’s not easy. When it happens for a marathon, it’s nine to 12 months in the planning. It doesn’t happen overnight. Chalmers says economy is ‘softer than we would like’ Jim Chalmers says “the economy is softer than we would like”, which he blamed on “a period of higher interest rates”, global uncertainty linked to Trump’s trade war, and the ongoing pressure on households from high living costs. The treasurer’s comments at a press conference in Parliament House this morning come after fresh figures showed inflation fell to 2.1% in the year to June, from 2.4% in March. “We need to get the economy growing quicker (and) in a more sustainable way,” he said, acknowledging that there has been “some softening around the edges of the labour market”. We are attentive to those cyclical issues - weaker growth, getting on top of inflation - but we’re also increasingly focused on the bigger structural issues. Analysts are now locking in a Reserve Bank rate cut at the next board meeting on 11-12 August. Stephen Smith, a partner at Deloitte Access Economics, said the inflation number “shows Australia’s policy settings must shift from containing inflation to stimulating economic growth”. Smith said that interest rates at current levels were “hard to justify given ongoing global economic volatility and the continued sluggishness of our own domestic economy”. Lawyers for the billionaire WiseTech founder Richard White are hoping to quash a subpoena to produce any communications with the former partner of New South Wales MP Mark Latham, Nathalie Matthews. Nicholas Olson, appearing for White in a court hearing on Wednesday, foreshadowed the application and said he would seek a suppression order on the material. There was also an application to set aside a subpoena directed at Matthews regarding the communications. Latham’s lawyers have sought the material under subpoena as part of his defence against a Domestic Violence Order (DVO) application Matthews has made against Latham and after texts reportedly between Latham and Matthews allegedly referring to White were published by the Australian newspaper earlier this month. White is not accused of any wrongdoing. Latham’s defence is seeking to have the DVO application lodged by Matthews set aside. The matter is scheduled to return to court on 6 August for a further mention. Among the allegations Matthews has made in documents filed with the court are that Latham intimidated her and forced her into demeaning sexual acts. Latham has strenuously denied the allegations. Latham is also facing a censure motion in the NSW upper house over unrelated matters when the state parliament sits next week. The Coalition says it has “serious concerns” about the government recognising a Palestinian state “outside of a proper two-state process”. The government has said recognition does not have to come at the end of a peace process with Israel. Shadow foreign minister Michaelia Cash has said in a statement that recognition cannot happen “with Hamas still in control of Gaza”, and that Australia should “not reward” Hamas with a pathway to statehood. The Coalition has been consistently clear that there can be no recognition of a Palestinian state with Hamas still in control of Gaza, and Hamas can have no role in governing a Palestinian state. The Albanese Government should explain to Australians why it is canvassing recognition of a Palestinian state while there are still hostages in tunnels under Gaza. This is a moment for international leaders to be applying maximum pressure on the listed terrorist organisation Hamas to immediately and unconditionally release all remaining hostages and disarm. The opposition has abstained from voting on its senator Sarah Henderson’s amendment to the Hecs bill – which would cap indexation at 3%. The Senate is currently debating the bill and voting on several amendments – one by Henderson, and several by the Greens, which have so far been voted down by the government. Henderson, who was dumped from Sussan Ley’s frontbench, went at it alone when announcing this week that she would push the government to cap the indexation rate. The four One Nation senators, Tammy Tyrrell, David Pocock and Ralph Babet voted with Henderson. The government and Greens senators voted against it, meaning it didn’t get up. Cost-of-living pressures continue despite drop in inflation As we wrote below, inflation has dropped all the way to 2.1% in the year to June, from 2.4% in March. But it’s not all good news. The ABS’s consumer price index climbed by 0.7% in the three months, as electricity prices jumped by 8.1% in the quarter, after taxpayer-funded energy bill subsidies rolled off in Perth and Brisbane. Michelle Marquardt, the ABS’s head of prices statistics, said “while electricity was up this quarter, it’s down 6.2% compared to 12 months ago as rebates remained in place for most capital cities”. The annual inflation rate was below the 2.2% consensus forecast among economists, thanks in large part to a 10% drop in petrol prices over the year, according to the ABS. There are still plenty of signs of cost-of-living pressures, even if the trajectory is a positive one. Rents were up 4.6% versus a year ago (from 5.5% in March), and insurance 3.9%. Breakfast costs are also higher than this time last year: egg prices are up 19% thanks to bird flu outbreaks, while tea and coffee costs are 9% higher thanks to major issues in overseas coffee bean-growing regions, the ABS said. Jim Chalmers says the latest inflation figures are “very encouraging news” but won’t predict whether it’ll result in a rate cut at the next Reserve Bank board meeting. The treasurer is speaking to Sky News (and will be doing a press conference shortly), and gives himself a bit of a pat on the back for how much inflation has dropped since Labor was first elected in 2022. These are pretty stunning numbers. When you consider when we came to office, inflation had a six in front of it. Now it’s around a third of that very, very encouraging development … No doubt the Reserve Bank board will weigh that up. Tsunami threat warnings for Papua New Guinea, New Zealand and Fiji after earthquake off Russia There are tsunami threat warnings for several countries near Australia including Papua New Guinea, New Zealand and Fiji. There are no warnings for Australia. We’ll keep you updated, or you can follow the Guardian’s live blog on the tsunami here: Inflation dropped to 2.1% in the year to June, from 2.4% in the year to March, as further evidence of waning underlying price pressures paves the way for a Reserve Bank rate cut next month. The Australian Bureau of Statistics’ quarterly report also showed the RBA’s preferred measure of inflation, which removes more volatile price movements, dropped to 0.6% in the three months to June. That lowered the annual “core” rate from 2.9% to 2.7%. The RBA board’s decision to hold the cash rate at 3.85% earlier this month came as a shock to investors and analysts, with the majority of the monetary policy board voting to hold fire until they had further confirmation that inflation was tracking as anticipated towards the 2.5% target. Economists leading into this morning’s release said that a quarterly underlying inflation rate of 0.7% or less would provide that comfort. The prospect of a rate cut on 12 August will be welcomed by mortgaged homeowners struggling with ongoing cost of living pressures, but less so by those hoping to buy a home amid resurgent property prices. June quarter’s inflation figures to be released at 11.30am The countdown is on for the 11:30am release of June quarter’s inflation figures, which should determine whether the Reserve Bank cuts rates next month. Michele Bullock, the RBA governor, has signalled that she and her board were waiting on further evidence that inflation is tracking sustainably towards the mid-point of the 2-3% target range, and this morning’s consumer price report should provide that comfort (or not). Economists predict inflation will fall from 2.2% in the year to June, from 2.4% in March. Surely that alone is enough for a rate cut? Not so fast. The RBA targets the “headline” inflation rate, but it leans on underlying measures which remove more volatile price movements (often for things such as petrol and fruit and vegetables) to guide its policy decisions. The so-called “trimmed mean” rate of inflation was 2.9% in the year to March. Analysts reckon the underlying rate needs to come in at 0.7% in the three months to June – or below – to lock in a rate cut. That would lower the annual pace to 2.7%. Is YouTube a social media network? YouTube issued a statement overnight saying it should be exempt from the social media ban because it’s a video-sharing platform, not social media. But if you search “is YouTube a social media network” on Google, YouTube’s parent company, its AI overview bot says … yes it is. The overview states: “While [YouTube] is primarily known as a video-sharing platform, it also facilitates user interaction, content creation and community building, which are core characteristics of social media.” Google says its AI overview provides an “AI-generated snapshot with key information and links to dig deeper”, so it’s not reflecting what Google actually thinks. Needless to say, it’s a bit funny. Coalition accuses Labor of breaking promise over YouTube under-16s ban The Coalition is accusing the government of a “blatant broken promise” over including YouTube in the under-16s social media ban, after the video service was previously exempt under the draft rules. The shadow communications minister, Melissa McIntosh, alleges Labor “deliberately misled the public” over the move, in a statement. [This is] a blatant broken promise to the Australian people … When the government introduced the legislation in November, they specifically excluded YouTube. This was the premise on which the legislation passed the parliament. McIntosh noted the government had issued media releases setting out the YouTube carveout, and had written to Google promising the same. But after advice from the eSafety commissioner, the government has changed its mind. The Coalition back the under-16s restrictions, but McIntosh is unhappy with the YouTube issue. The Albanese Labor government can change a minister, but they cannot hide the fact they deliberately misled the public at the last election by promising to keep YouTube out of the social media age minimum. The prime minister and the Labor government reaffirmed YouTube’s exemption before the election … It makes you question what has really changed behind the scenes in the government on this issue, and whether it was an election stunt. IMF upgrades Australia’s economic growth outlook The International Monetary Fund has upgraded its outlook for the Australian and global economy thanks to a “modest decline in trade tensions” after Donald Trump failed to follow through on the worst of his tariff threats. In an overnight update to its April world economic outlook, the IMF forecasts Australian GDP will rise by 1.8% this year, and 2.2% in 2026. The estimates were 0.1 and 0.2 percentage points higher, respectively, than the forecasts three months ago. The IMF in particular noted the de-escalation of trade tensions with China in May, which reduced the effective tariff of imports into the US from 24% to 17% - the highest in 90 years. Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF’s chief economist, said “this resilience (in the global economy) is welcome, but it is also tenuous”. While the trade shock could turn out to be less severe than initially feared, it is still sizeable, and evidence is mounting that it is hurting the global economy.” Compared to the IMF’s pre-April and pre-trade war forecast, global growth is expected to grow 0.2 percentage points more slowly. Gourinchas said": At around 3%, global growth remains disappointingly below the pre-Covid average. Albanese ends the press conference stressing that Australians don’t want the conflict brought here. My priority has been to try and navigate what is a very difficult situation but, you know, the young Jewish boy or girl going to the local school should not be harassed because of who they are. They are not responsible for what is going on in Gaza. And Arab Australians or Muslims are not responsible for what Hamas did. He says the media also has a responsibility not to stoke tensions in the community. Albanese not surprised Aukus review taking US longer than 30 days Albanese says he’s not surprised that the US is delaying the completion of its Aukus review until Australia’s spring. The office of the US under secretary of defence for policy, Elbridge Colby, released a statement on X a short time ago, stating the review would be completed in the US fall, and that it would engage with the UK and Australia during that review. Albanese says: We expected a review from an incoming government just like the Keir Starmer government did it. We expect that those things take longer than just 30 days. ‘Sometimes out of a crisis comes a moment of opportunity to actually advance forward’ Albanese is asked whether the government will place more sanctions on Israel, and accuses those calling for more sanctions of just using “slogans”. He says the government is “about meaningful action” and lambasts protesters who caused his electorate office to be shut down on Friday. There’s been a lot of comparison between the number of sanctions on Russians, compared to Israelis, but Albanese says Israel is democratic, while Putin’s regime is not. Pushed further on his comments that Hamas should not have a role in a future Palestinian government, Albanese is asked what that means for senior bureaucrats that have been involved in the Palestinian health administration. Albanese says the government is “not at that point of detail”. Clearly one of the things that the Palestinian Authority have said is to speak about a demilitarised Palestinian state. What that implies is not just no military in the conventional sense but also obviously no paramilitary. If people are serious, and I’ve been serious about the rights of Palestinians and them having justice since, you know, well before I came to this place … One of the things that I’ve said … is that sometimes out of a crisis comes a moment of opportunity to actually advance forward, in a real way, advance forward for Israelis and Palestinians. Albanese asked about recognising Palestinian state On to other issues, Albanese is asked whether the government is now looking at a specific timeframe for recognising a Palestinian state. Albanese says there’s not a timeline, but specific circumstances to enable that to happen. He says he spoke to Keir Starmer overnight, and expects to speak with the British PM again in the coming days. We’ve signed another statement today with many nations. That statement, I think, has a number of things in it are important. Asked whether Starmer declaration on statehood has influenced Albanese’s thinking, the prime minister the world is “continuing to engage with each other” formally and informally. The world was horrified by the terrorist act and the atrocities committed by Hamas on 7 October. The world looks on what is happening in Gaza and expresses that it is unjustified and it is a tragedy, the ongoing loss of innocent life. ‘My government is pro Wiggles’: Albanese This morning Wells said Wiggles management tried to appeal to the government to allow YouTube to be exempt from the ban. She says they told her that YouTube is a video platform, not a social media platform – the same argument a spokesperson for YouTube made in a statement overnight. Wells clarifies that it was Wiggles management, not the actual Wiggles, who made the appeal, and Albanese adds” “We’re not here to sledge the Wiggles. My government is pro Wiggles.” Wells also said a bit earlier that in terms of age-restrictive content, it should be up to the social media companies to explain why kids might have access to that content. Wells on implementing social media band: ‘The onus here is on the platforms’ Albanese says the government will be holding an event at the UN General Assembly later this year with the 36 months and the Let Them be Kids campaigns to advocate for the social media ban. This legislation is the first of its kind worldwide, but Albanese says other nations are looking at what Australia is doing and considering the impact social media is having on their kids. Our own Josh Butler asks Wells what “reasonable steps” to reduce harm means, and when the public will know what verification measures the platforms will implement. Wells says the platforms are working on a one-on-one basis with the eSafety commissioner, but doesn’t clarify what “reasonable steps” should be. Each platform works differently. Obviously they’re all competitors. That means they need to work on a one on one basis with the eSafety commissioner. But I think reasonable steps is reasonable. We are backing parents. The platforms have a responsibility, a social responsibility, as the PM would say, the onus here is on the platforms. Come 10 December, if your kid has a Facebook account, it is on Facebook to deactivate that account. It’s not on the parent to police that on behalf of Facebook. Albanese says even if children find ways to access social media, the ban will still make a difference Albanese says that just because children may get around the ban, doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be done. We know this is not the only solution, and there’s more to do, but it will make a difference. We know as well that there are those who will say young people will find their way around it. That’s not a reason to stop the other laws that we put in place about alcohol consumption or about purchasing of tobacco. The latest decision to include YouTube in the ban is a result of advice from the eSafety commissioner. Anika Wells says the government can’t ignore evidence that “four out of 10 Australian kids report that their most recent harm was on YouTube.” She adds that the government won’t be “intimidated” by social media companies and says the regulations are about prioritising “parents ahead of platforms”. As parents, we are really trying our best when it comes to the internet, but it is like trying to teach your kids to swim in the open ocean with the rips and the sharks compared to at the local council pool, we can’t control the ocean, but we can police the sharks, and that’s why I will not be intimidated by leaving threats when this is a genuine fight for the wellbeing of Australian kids. Prime minister Anthony Albanese and communications minister Anika Wells are standing up for a press conference this morning, on the decision to include YouTube in the social media ban for children under 16. YouTube kids will still be exempt. Albanese starts by recognising three parents who are with him, all who have lost a child. Mia, Rob and Emma are three parents, but their stories are felt by countless other parents and by communities right across the country. We know that social media is doing social harm, and my government and this parliament is prepared to take action to protect young Australians. Tsunami alert issued for Pacific islands and Japan after earthquake off Russia Leaving parliament again for a moment, there’s a tsunami warning for the Pacific after an earthquake off the north-east coast of Russia. According to the US weather service, there is a “potential threat” warning for Russia and Japan. There is also a “watch” alert for Hawaii. There’s no sign yet of any danger south of the equator. You can stay updated at our live blog: Two Australians on board a boat intercepted by Israeli troops earlier this week have been deported from Israel and are on their way back to Australia, according to their lawyers. Tania “Tan” Safi and Robert Martin were detained on Monday while onboard the ship Handala, which was attempting to reach Gaza with aid as part of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition. Adalah Legal Center, a Palestinian legal rights group, said the pair were among a number of activists who have been deported so far, with the remainder of the 21 people detained expected to be deported in the coming days. Adalah said in a translated statement: Australian activists Robert Daniel Martin and Tania Safi were transferred to Jordan and are scheduled to depart on July 30 via a flight that includes a stop in Dubai before arriving in Australia. Adalah said those left in detention were continuing an open-ended hunger strike after their detention: According to testimonies collected by Adalah’s field team during today’s visit, the activists continue to be subjected to harsh and degrading detention conditions and are continuing an open-ended hunger strike for the fourth consecutive day in protest against their unlawful arrest and detention conditions. Dfat has been approached for comment. Staying with Lawrence’s comments, he said it is “rarely, if ever, the role of the state to prevent mass protests, and that it is the “obligation of the state to facilitate, support and make safer such events.” Lawrence also said he has given repeated warnings in parliament about since October 2023 about “the risk of violence on our streets if attempts are made by the executive government to unreasonably prevent peaceful mass protests.” The management of this planned protest should be left entirely to NSW Police, who should be allowed to make an independent and principled decision according to law. A member of Chris Minns’ government has said he is concerned the New South Wales premier tainted the police’s decision on whether to facilitate a proposed protest that would involve marching across the Sydney Harbour Bridge, arguing that it was not within his authority to do so. On Tuesday afternoon, the deputy police commissioner, Peter McKenna, said police had rejected an application from organisers of a protest, citing safety risks as the reason. The organisers of the rally, the Palestine Action Group, have vowed to fight the decision in the supreme court. It came after Minns had said on ABC Sydney Radio that the mass protests relating to Gaza would not be allowed on the Harbour Bridge under “any circumstances”. The upper house Labor MP Stephen Lawrence, who is also a barrister, said he was “extremely concerned” by these comments. He wrote in a statement on social media: This detailed [NSW] statutory regime as I understand it gives no substantive role to the premier in deciding whether authorisation is given. I am concerned the premier has in effect made a purported decision himself to try and prevent this protest, that this will taint proper consideration of the matter by police and that violence may ensue as a consequence. I have felt the need to give these warnings because an environment has been created by senior political leaders, Labor and conservative, hostile to protests concerned with the rights of Palestinian people. US review of Aukus to be completed late this year, Pentagon policy chief says The Aukus review is expected to be completed late this year, the US has said in a statement on X. The statement is from the office of the under secretary of defence for policy, Elbridge Colby, and states that the department working on the review will engage with Australia and the UK. It doesn’t add a whole lot of new information, but does confirm that the review will take longer than its initial 30-day timeframe. The new statement says: As part of this process the department looks forward to continuing regular engagements on this important matter with other parts of the US government, the US congress, our other allies Australia and the United Kingdom, and other key stakeholders. The department anticipates completing the review in the fall. The fall, or autumn, in the US is between late September and late December. Australia has signed a new joint-statement of 15 foreign ministers, including France and Canada, on Gaza, expressing their “unwavering commitment” to a two-state solution. It states that the nations, ahead of the UN General Assembly meeting in September: Have already recognised, have expressed or express willingness or the positive consideration of our countries to recognise the State of Palestine, as an essential step towards the two state solution, and invite all countries that have not done so to join this call. The statement condemns the 7 October attack, and demands an immediate ceasefire, immediate and unconditional release of all hostages of Hamas and calls for ensuring unhindered humanitarian access. The statement also “welcomes the commitments made by the President of the Palestinian Authority” on 10 June, including where the president condemned the 7 October attacks, called for the liberation of hostages and disarmament of Hamas, and committed to “call for elections within a year to trigger generational renewal”. It was signed by the foreign ministers of: Andorra, Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, San Marino, Slovenia and Spain. Recognising Palestinian statehood would end Hamas’s authority in Gaza, Husic says The Labor MP Ed Husic says Australia joining with countries including France and the UK to recognise Palestinian statehood would end Hamas’s power in Gaza. One of the major stumbling blocks for countries considering statehood is the role of the terrorist organisation, which was responsible for the 7 October attacks on Israel and still holding hostages. But Husic, who says other members of Labor’s caucus want action from the Albanese government, says moving on statehood will deny Hamas authority. “Hamas is built largely on grievance,” Husic says. That grievance gets removed with the establishment of a state of Palestine, nurtured with the cooperation and support of the international community, progressed through the development of democratic institutions. And that would champion the delivery of humanitarian aid to nourishing … children. On backbench discussions about the war and next steps from the international community, Husic said he wanted Labor MPs to make their own statements. We have been talking. Colleagues have been considering this, across the backbench. There is a deep feeling within the caucus, about how right it is to recognise Palestine, and I would much rather that colleagues speak for themselves. Leaving federal politics for a moment, the Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, and attorney general Sonya Kilkenny are holding a press conference at parliament to announce privately owned bail services will be banned in the state. As part of the bail bill announced yesterday, commercial operators will no longer be able to provide monitoring services. It a similar move by the NSW government in May, after private operator BailSafe collapsed I earlier this year, without notifying authorities. It led to a mad scramble to locate about 20 alleged offenders on bail in NSW and eight in Victoria. Allan says: We saw the situation earlier this year where a private company, BailSafe, shut up shop. They didn’t tell anyone across the justice system, the courts, Victoria police, and that’s just absolutely unacceptable. When that happened, I was determined that we would stamp out the use of private companies in the provision of electronic monitoring here in this state. Australia can build momentum on Palestinian recognition: Husic Speaking in the press gallery corridor, the Labor MP Ed Husic says Australia should move with the UK to recognise Palestinian statehood. Husic says “moral momentum cannot be ignored” and has implored the government to “reconsider its approach” to recognising a Palestinian state. I would urge our government to reconsider its approach. We can still maintain that we have conditions that we believe need to be satisfied, the least of which is the build up of democratic institutions within the state of Palestine, the demilitarisation of Hamas, for example. But we can flag our preparedness to join with both France and the UK to signal our commitment to recognise Palestine. Now it is important that that occur. I believe it’s critical that we back them in and build a sense of international momentum. ‘A question of when, not if’ – government MPs on Palestinian recognition In response to the UK government declaring it could recognise Palestine as a state in September, unless Israel takes immediate steps towards peace, government ministers have said this morning that the question for Australia is “when, not if”. Earlier when Anika Wells spoke to ABC News Breakfast, she said there are still things to be worked through to get to a two-state solution. It is a question of when not if. There is things to work through. We need Hamas to release the hostages and we need to secure aid as quickly as possible. Everybody is working on that. Over on Sky News, Julian Hill offered similar remarks. The government will determine its position based on our conception of Australia’s national interest, working with like-minded countries around the world, and the PM is in dialogue. [It’s] a question of when, not if, to recognise the state of Palestine Anthony Albanese is a “Seinfeld prime minister”, says shadow foreign minister Michaelia Cash, over the governments response to Trump foreshadowing higher tariff rates of up to 15 to 20%. Why Seinfeld? It’s a show about nothing, so “stop being a show about nothing” says Cash. On a panel with Clare O’Neil on Sunrise earlier, Cash said Albanese had still failed to get a face-to-face meeting with Trump since he was elected. Other countries [are] meeting, they are successfully negotiating trade deals that benefit their countries. We now hear it could go 15%, it could go 20%. Mr Albanese needs to stop being the Seinfeld prime minister, stop being a show about nothing, step up, get a meeting with President Trump, and advocate on behalf of Australians. O’Neil says the comments from Cash are “really rude and disrespectful” and the opposition should have a team Australia view. She says the government is working calmly and working through the appropriate channel to get the “best deal”. We will manage this not with some of the kind of flamboyant language Michaelia used there. We will manage it in a calm and considered way. That is how our government restored our relationship with China, France all the countries that were left by the way side by the opposition. Wells says she ‘can’t ignore’ new eSafety evidence about YouTube Anika Wells says she can’t ignore new evidence from the eSafety commissioner that more than a third of kids have experienced harm online “at the hands of YouTube”. The communications minister is speaking to ABC News Breakfast and says YouTube will need to work with the eSafety commissioner to change its platform in response to the social media ban. She says YouTube needs to stop users being able to access age-restrictive in a logged-out state. Fresh evidence from the eSafety commissioner that 37% of kids had their most recent or most impactful online harm at the hands of YouTube. That is evidence that I can’t ignore and they are joining the ban. Kids who are under 18 will find a way to smoke. There [are] kids who are under 16 who will find a way around this but it is about making a positive impact. We would rather kids work out who they are before social media platforms assume who they are. Shadow education minister on Naplan results: ‘We need to look at what it is we are teaching’ The opposition says the latest Naplan results aren’t a “cause for particular celebration” but there are positive signs. Shadow education minister Jonno Duniam told ABC News Breakfast earlier that the gap between regional, remote and metro and other disadvantaged students including Indigenous children is “very concerning”. Duniam says it might be time for a relook at the curriculum. Under our federated system, where no one should be worse off because of where they live or any other particular attribute, some are falling behind, which needs addressing. We are falling behind and we have been for a long period of time. This is not just a now problem, this has been for decades. We need to look at what it is we are teaching. Clare on Naplan results: ‘Good news, but there’s still more work to do’ The government says there are encouraging signs from the latest Naplan school results. Two thirds of students have achieved a “strong” or “exceeding” proficiency level, but for the first time since 2017, numeracy results improved across years five, seven and nine. In a statement, education minister Jason Clare said there are still more improvements to be made: The improvements in literacy and numeracy are good news, but there’s more work to do. That’s what the new agreements we’ve now signed with every state and territory are all about. Paterson says Australia should not push to recognise Palestinian state at this time Opposition frontbencher James Paterson says Australia shouldn’t join the UK in pushing to recognise the state of Palestine this year. On RN Breakfast, Paterson says Australia recognising a Palestinian state before Hamas is dismantled would be “counterproductive”. It’s not for me to comment on the foreign policy of other countries, but if the Australian government was to make a similar move, I wouldn’t agree with it. Asked whether the images out of Gaza are evidence of starvation of its population, Paterson said there are “credible reports of that”. Premature recognition of a Palestinian state before Hamas has been dismantled, before the Palestinian Authority recognises Israel’s right to exist, before they give up their aims of using terrorism to abolish the Israeli state, I think would be extremely counterproductive. There’s certainly credible reports of that [widespread starvation]. I’m not on the ground and I can’t independently assess it. But I think very clearly there is very serious suffering happening in Gaza. He went further than his leader Sussan Ley yesterday who declined to say wouldn’t say there was evidence of starvation during a press conference yesterday. But says he’s still “cautious” in not wanting to “endorse claims that are made by Hamas” while observing the “very serious humanitarian situation”. ‘I’ve got sharp elbows’: Wells on any potential legal action by Google Asked about whether she’s concerned about potential legal action from Google, Wells says she’s got “sharp elbows”. We have had threats come in. But look, I’ve got sharp elbows. This is too important for us not to have a crack. They are world leading laws. While social media has a place persuasive and predatory algorithms do not. And that’s what we’re cracking down on. Wells says the laws will not be set and forget, and the social media platforms will have to work with the eSafety commissioner to figure out how to put the new restrictions in place. The communications minister, Anika Wells, says “parents, we have your backs” in announcing her decision to include YouTube in the social media ban. Wells told the Today Show the laws “aren’t infallible” but it’ll be up to the platforms to take reasonable steps to stop children being on them. When they find their way around this, because we know that kids will, god bless them, the platforms [need to] take reasonable steps to mitigate that from happening and to correct errors. These laws aren’t infallible, none are but this is about the chilling effect [of social media]. And there’s a study that asked kids who are 16, 17, 18, ‘do they wish that they had not gotten on social media as early as 13?’ And they all said, yeah, they regret it. Wells said that Google sent the Wiggles management team to try to “persuade” her on the decision. This was Big Wiggle. This was Wiggles Inc, the management around the Wiggles … The Wiggles are a treasured Australian institution. But like I said to them, you’re arguing that my four-year-old twins right to have a YouTube login is more important than the fact that four out of 10 of their peers will experience online harm on YouTube. Liberal senator says YouTube decision represents a ‘broken promise’ The Liberal senator Paul Scarr says the decision to reverse YouTube’s exemption from the social media ban could amount to a “broken promise”, but won’t say whether or not including it in the ban is the right decision. Over on Sunrise, Scarr and Greens leader Larissa Waters have been reacting to the news overnight. There is a lot of harmful content out there. But the fact of the matter is the legislation, when it was first passed by the parliament, specifically excluded YouTube, and now the government appears ready to change their position in that respect. And that’s a broken promise. Scarr says the party will take a “careful” look at the regulations, and it’s important to “get the balance right” between protecting children and freedom of speech and privacy. Waters says the bans aren’t going to work, and the social media giants should do better to make the content on their platforms safer. Kids are so tech savvy, they’re going to find a way around these bans. These bans are not going to work. So what we actually need to do is to make those platforms safer and safer, not just for kids but for anyone who’s accessing them. And I think that’s where the responsibility should be on the big tech companies. They’re getting off scot-free right now. Ted O’Brien says government has ‘questions to answer’ on YouTube decision The opposition is critical of the government’s backflip to include YouTube in the social media ban, saying Labor has “questions to answer” over the decision. Deputy opposition leader Ted O’Brien says his party will wait and see what rules the government puts forward for the ban, which are expected to be tabled to parliament today. On Sky News, O’Brien says the government “failed” to flag that it would put the ban on YouTube, after the eSafety commissioner offered advice to do so. They [the government] were silent on the possibility that it would be brought in… and so let’s wait and see what they table. The eSafety commissioner’s advice needs to be scrutinised. I make the point they failed to tell the Australian people about this before the election. Good morning, Krishani Dhanji here with you, thanks to Martin Farrer for getting us started. The government will be discussing its decision this morning to include YouTube in its social media ban for under 16s – though the more tightly curated YouTube kids will be spared. And this morning the UK has increased pressure on Israel, declaring it will recognise a Palestinian state later this year unless Israel takes urgent steps to commit to peace. We’ll be following all local reaction to that this morning. Stay with us, it’s going to be another busy day! Google has reacted to the government’s decision to include YouTube in the under-16s social media ban (though YouTube kids will be exempt). The search engine giant says it will “consider next steps”, after it threatened to sue the government over the weekend if it was included in the ban, before the decision was announced. A spokesperson for YouTube said in a statement that the platform is “not social media”. We share the Government’s goal of addressing and reducing online harms. Our position remains clear: YouTube is a video sharing platform with a library of free, high-quality content, increasingly viewed on TV screens. It’s not social media. The Government’s announcement today reverses a clear, public commitment to exclude YouTube from this ban. We will consider next steps and will continue to engage with the Government. Chris Bowen was also asked on 7.30 for his reaction to the decision by the UK prime minister to recall his cabinet from their summer break for an emergency meeting on the Gaza crisis. Asked if Australia, as a middle power, would join a joint effort to ensure more aid gets into Gaza, Bowen said: I think the best thing I can do, Sarah, is very warmly and strongly and positively point you to the prime minister’s comments. One, his abhorrence at what has been happening in Gaza in recent times, his condemnation of that action and his statements about Australia’s role in the pathway going forward. A sensible pathway for Australia to work towards the recognition of Palestine at the right time but also his abhorrence at the breaches of international law. There is a high degree of coordination between Australia and like-minded countries, or middle powers, as you correctly put it. There is a very high degree of coordination there and you should expect that to continue. Now, I’m not going to comment on the details of what Keir Starmer may or may not be doing because that’s a matter for the United Kingdom. Obviously, we would respond in due course. Chris Bowen: ‘Anybody can set a high target with no plan to get there’ The minister for climate change and energy, Chris Bowen, appeared on ABC’s 7.30 last night and was asked about calls by a top UN official for Australia to go “big” on its 2035 emissions reduction target. Simon Stiell, who is visiting several countries ahead of the Cop30 climate conference in Brazil in November, said in a speech in Sydney on Monday the 2035 target would be a defining moment for Australia. He urged the government to not pick a “bog-standard” number but to “go for what’s smart by going big”. Bowen said: We have a very rigorous process [and] world’s best practice for setting a climate target. We agree a good, strong target is good economic policy and it also has to be achievable, a target we can set out and achieve. Anybody can set a high target with no plan to get there. That’s not the approach our government has taken and not the approach we’ll take in the future. Just one in seven Australians back Israel’s actions in Gaza, poll shows Guardian Australia’s Essential poll is out this morning, and the top line is the public’s general scepticism over whether they will ever see the US deliver a nuclear submarine to the Australian navy. But as always the poll asked a range of questions. Other interesting results include: Only 15% of Australians believe Israel is justified in continuing its military action in Gaza. Some 41% of voters want Israel to permanently withdraw its military action, while 25% want a temporary ceasefire. 31% of voters say Australia should consider levelling our own tariffs on the US, while 45% say we should prioritise staying on good terms with Trump and keep negotiating for exemptions. You can read the full story here: More from Sarah on last night’s Senate motion. Liberal frontbencher, Maria Kovacic, stood to speak in support of the motion, saying that while it was important to protect children from online harm, “ensuring every adult logs into an account to browse the internet is taking the esafety commissioner’s power to a new level, which must be debated and scrutinised further”. Corinne Mulholland, a newly elected Labor senator, questioned why senators would be against a law that “helps to prevent illegal content from spreading by restricting access to and the distribution of harmful content”. To me, it all makes just common sense, so I’m not sure why it’s so controversial ... The most ludicrous thing is wasting our time in the Senate when we can be getting on with the real business of debating legislation. Read more here: The Senate voted last night to pass an urgency motion against new rules requiring search engines, such as Google, to undertake user identity checks by the end of the year. To refresh your memory, the previous parliament passed rules banning under-16s from many social media sites. As a result, a number of platforms are now required to verify a user’s age by the end of the year with a federal government trial of age assurance systems still underway. Put forward by United Australia Party senator Ralph Babet on Tuesday night, the urgency motion read: “The need to recognise that the internet search engine services online safety code, which requires age assurance measures for account holders of search engines, must be amended as it represents another layer of digital surveillance, dressed up as child protection and raises many privacy issues.” It was supported by the Coalition, the Greens, One Nation and other crossbenchers – including David Pocock, Lidia Thorpe and Fatima Payman – with only Labor senators opposing it. The final vote was 38 ayes and 25 noes. Good morning and welcome to our live politics blog. I’m Martin Farrer with the best of the overnight stories before Krishani Dhanji picks it up. There was some evening activity in the Senate last night as senators voted to pass an urgency motion against rules requiring search engines, such as Google, to undertake user identity checks by the end of the year. More details coming up. Chris Bowen appeared on 7.30 last night when he was grilled about climate policy but also about the UK government’s decision to hold an emergency cabinet meeting about Gaza. The energy minister played that question with a straight bat but the fact that the UK has announced overnight that it will recognise Palestine unless Isrel agrees a truce will increase calls today for Australia to follow suit. More coming up. Plus the latest Essential poll shows that barely one in seven Australians back Israel’s military action in Gaza. More on that soon too.
