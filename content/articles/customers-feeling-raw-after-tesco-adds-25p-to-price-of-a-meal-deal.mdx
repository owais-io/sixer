  Tesco has put the price of its meal deal up by 25p, its third increase since
  2022, as food prices across the UK continue to race higher. The meal deal now
  costs £3.85 for Clubcard holders. Customers who do not have a Tesco loyalty
  card will pay £4.25. The latest official inflation figures, released this
  week, showed that the price of food and non-alcoholic beverages rose 4.9% year
  on year in July, from 4.5% in the 12 months to June. Some retailers have
  chosen to pass on the soaring costs of ingredients to consumers. Heatwaves and
  droughts in parts of Spain, Italy and Portugal, where the UK sources a lot of
  its fresh fruit and vegetables, have pushed up prices this summer, at a time
  when they would usually fall. Beef, orange juice, coffee and chocolate were
  among the worst-hit products. Some shoppers expressed dismay at the price
  increase by the UK’s biggest grocer. On X, one user wrote: “Discovering that a
  Tesco meal deal will be £3.85 *with* a Clubcard from Thursday was truly
  devastating.” Another questioned whether it could still be termed a “deal”.
  Tesco’s sandwich, snack and drink deal had cost £3 for 10 years before prices
  jumped in October 2022, in the depths of the cost of living crisis. However,
  Tesco is not the first major supermarket group to frustrate customers by
  raising the price of its meal deal. In June, Sainsbury’s increased the price
  of its standard offering from £3.75 to £3.95. It was the second time
  Sainsbury’s had increased the price in under a year, after raisingit by 25p in
  July 2024. The Tesco deal still offers significant savings, depending on the
  meal combination. A shopper who selected a brie and smoked bacon sandwich with
  chilli jam, which costs £3.25 when sold alone, as the main meal, vegetable
  samosa for £1.75 as the snack, and a Naked smoothie for £2.90 would save £4.05
  with a Clubcard, and £3.65 without. The combination would cost £7.90 without
  the deal. On Thursday, more than 60 chief executives of Britain’s biggest
  retailers, including Tesco, Sainsbury’s, John Lewis and Boots, wrote to the
  chancellor, Rachel Reeves, to warn her that further taxes on businesses in the
  autumn budget could contradict her plans to improve UK living standards. They
  suggested that food price inflation could hit 6% this year, arguing that they
  would not be able to “absorb” further tax rises, instead passing the higher
  costs on to shoppers. Retailers have repeatedly bemoaned the impact of Reeves’
  increase to employer national insurance contributions, while an increase to
  the national minimum wage in April also raised labour costs. The retailers
  said in the letter, sent by the British Retail Consortium: “Labour’s manifesto
  made a clear and welcome promise to deliver good jobs and higher living
  standards but if future policy decisions lead to rising prices and fewer jobs,
  then those commitments are at risk.”
