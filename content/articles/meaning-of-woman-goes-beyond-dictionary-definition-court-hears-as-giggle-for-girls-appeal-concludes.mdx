  Sex exists on a scale and the definition of “woman” is not limited to the
  pages of a dictionary, a court has heard in an appeal hearing to overturn a
  landmark gender identity discrimination finding made against a women-only
  social media app. Giggle for Girls and its CEO, Sall Grover, are challenging
  Justice Robert Bromwich’s August 2024 federal court judgment that found
  Roxanne Tickle, a transgender woman, was indirectly discriminated against when
  she was barred from the platform in September 2021. The case was the first
  gender identity discrimination case to reach the federal court. Much of the
  proceedings, which concluded on Wednesday, centred on the definition of sex,
  woman and what it means to be a woman. On Wednesday, Celia Winnett, the
  barrister for the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, who acted as a friend of
  the court, said the definition of “women does include transgender women”. The
  full court of the federal court heard Giggle for Girls and Grover argue that
  the Sex Discrimination Act bears the “ordinary” meaning of men and women. But
  Winnett said that “‘woman’ does now have a broader ordinary meaning … informed
  by its use” and that the meaning was “broad enough to include trans women”.
  “There’s no need for ordinary meaning to hinge or rely on dictionary
  meanings,” she said. On Monday, Grover’s barrister, Noel Hutley SC, told the
  court that “even today, the Macquarie dictionary defines the word ‘women’ by
  reference to what I have called ‘natal’ woman”. A natal woman is a term used
  to describe a person who was assigned female at birth. Sign up: AU Breaking
  News email Giggle for Girls and Grover argue the app was allowed to
  discriminate against men because it was a special measure that redressed
  historical disadvantage between men and women. Grover has persistently
  misgendered Tickle and claims she did not know Tickle was a trans woman when
  she barred her from the app. The words “opposite sex” were replaced with
  “different sex” in the Sex Discrimination Act in 2013, when amendments made it
  unlawful under federal law to discriminate against a person on the basis of
  sexual orientation, gender identity or intersex status. Man, woman and sex are
  not defined in the act. Ruth Higgins SC, acting for Equality Australia, on
  Wednesday told the court that transgender people experienced unique forms of
  identity discrimination and that “sex” included social recognition and
  personal identification. “Sex is way of classifying people along a scale
  between a man at one end and woman at the other,” she said. “Sex at birth is
  but one conception of sex.” A purely biological definition relied on a “false
  simplicity”, she said, questioning whether biological meant anatomical,
  chromosomal, hormonal or a balance thereof. The Lesbian Action Group was also
  given leave to intervene in the appeal. Its barrister, Leigh Howard, referred
  to the For Women Scotland case, when the UK supreme court in April issued a
  historic and definitive ruling that the terms “woman” and “sex” in the UK’s
  Equality Act refer only to a biological woman and to biological sex. He said
  “sex is a biological condition, not an identity” and urged for the word
  “woman” to be given the same meaning throughout the act. Georgina Costello KC,
  Tickle’s barrister, said Giggle for Girls’ policy to exclude transgender women
  from the app disadvantaged transgender women – and that those women could face
  gender identity discrimination because of a discordance between their
  appearance and their identity. Because Giggle for Girls required users to have
  a gender identity that appeared consistent with their gender identity at
  birth, direct discrimination – rather than indirect discrimination as Bromwich
  found – was a “better fit”, she argued. But her opposition said it could not
  have been parliament’s intention, when writing the Sex Discrimination Act, for
  protected measures – such as gender identity – to prejudice special measures
  for women. “It would be an extraordinary by-blow of this exercise that
  expanding protection in effect undermines the ability to set up measures to
  achieve substantive equality,” Hutley said. Over the two-and-half-day appeal,
  the court heard Tickle was seeking $40,000 in damages and that she was treated
  as a “hostile invader” when joining the app. A finding is expected by
  February.
