  The White House launched an official TikTok account on Tuesday, as Donald
  Trump continues to permit the Chinese-owned platform to operate in the US
  despite a law requiring its sale. “America we are BACK! What’s up TikTok?”
  read a caption on the account’s first post, a 27-second clip, on the popular
  video-sharing app. The account had about 4,500 followers an hour after posting
  the video. Trump’s personal account on TikTok meanwhile has 15.1 million
  followers, though his last post was on 5 November 2024 – election day. Trump
  has a soft spot for the popular app, crediting it with helping him gain
  support among young voters when he defeated Kamala Harris, his Democratic
  opponent, in the November 2024 presidential election. “The Trump
  administration is committed to communicating the historic successes President
  Trump has delivered to the American people with as many audiences and
  platforms as possible,” Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary,
  said as the account went live. A federal law requiring TikTok’s sale or a ban
  on national security grounds was due to take effect the day before Trump’s
  inauguration on 20 January. But the Republican president, whose 2024 election
  campaign relied heavily on social media and who has said he is fond of TikTok,
  put the ban on pause. TikTok is a tremendously popular social media app with
  170 million users in the US. ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, said in April
  that it had been in discussion with the US government regarding a solution for
  the app. It added that any agreement “will be subject to approval under
  Chinese law”. In mid-June, Trump for the third time extended the deadline for
  the popular video-sharing app by another 90 days to find a non-Chinese buyer
  or be banned in the United States. That extension is due to expire in
  mid-September. The idea of banning TikTok originated with Trump in 2020, who
  said the Chinese-owned app posed a danger to national security. It quickly
  became a bipartisan issue and Congress overwhelmingly voted to ban the app
  last year, which faced a legal challenge but was ultimately affirmed by the
  supreme court. The original deadline for the TikTok ban was 19 January. Trump
  switched his stance on TikTok after joining the app while campaigning for
  president last year, amassing nearly 15 million followers and hosting the
  TikTok CEO, Shou Zi Chew, at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Chew also
  attended Trump’s inauguration. While Trump had long supported a ban or
  divestment, he reversed his position and vowed to defend the platform – which
  boasts almost 2 billion global users – after coming to believe it helped him
  win young voters’ support in the November election. Trump’s official account
  on X, formerly Twitter, has 108.5 million followers – though his favored
  social media outlet is Truth Social, which he owns, where he has 10.6 million
  followers. The official White House accounts on X and Instagram have 2.4
  million and 9.3 million followers, respectively. Dara Kerr contributed
  reporting • This article was amended on 20 August 2025. An earlier version
  said that Donald Trump’s personal TikTok account had 101.1 million followers.
  In fact, that is the number of likes his account has and he has 15.1 million
  followers.
