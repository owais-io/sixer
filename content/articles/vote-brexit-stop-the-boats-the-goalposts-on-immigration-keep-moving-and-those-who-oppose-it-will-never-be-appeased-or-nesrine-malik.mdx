  A few weeks after the Brexit referendum, a leave-voting friend of mine told me
  what the biggest benefit would be. “We will never hear about immigration
  again,” he said. If you give the people the control over the border they want,
  the logic went, then Brexit will finally dissolve immigration as an issue that
  politicians can exploit, and the country can crack on with all the other
  important stuff that needs doing. And, well, let’s just say that this
  prediction did not pan out on such a colossal level that no follow-up
  conversation has been necessary. Because that’s just not how the whole
  immigration thing works. The goalposts always move. Nothing clarifies that
  more than Nigel Farage getting everything he has said he ever wanted, the
  country heaving itself out of the EU and ending free movement, only for
  another boil to fester around the issue of immigration – and guess what, only
  Reform UK can lance it! Nothing is ever enough. One only needs to look at the
  escalating crackdowns in the US to see how the net keeps getting wider and
  wider. In a matter of months, immigration crackdown has expanded so rapidly
  that immigrants, both documented and undocumented, are afraid to leave their
  houses to buy groceries or go to work, as the national guard patrols the
  streets. It starts with the border, a boundary so porous that it must be
  policed with military levels of force and those crossing it treated with
  maximum levels of punishment. People crossing the border are portrayed as
  “invaders” intent on carrying out some criminal or exploitative act. Rightwing
  politicians in the UK have been speaking of “invasion” for years. After Donald
  Trump came to office for the second time, he codified that notion, expanding
  the constitutional protection of states from invasion to include immigrants.
  The US’s southern border is now so militarised that armoured vehicles
  previously stationed in Iraq are positioned there. Border crossings have been
  falling since before Trump became president, but that decline has accelerated
  since he took office. In April this year, they were down 94% on the previous
  year. Is that enough? No. Because really, the numbers are irrelevant: the
  point is to maintain the flamboyant show of force. “Containment is at 95%. But
  95% is not 100%,” said Brigadier General Jeremy Winters in response to the
  drop. When the UK media suggests it may be time for “gunboat diplomacy” in
  response to small boat arrivals – which in 2024 made up about 4% of total
  immigration arrivals to the UK – something similar is playing out. These
  responses are about posturing, not results. And it doesn’t stop, and, in fact,
  can’t stop there. Because what about those already in the country? Under new
  laws that empower US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), everyone from
  undocumented migrants to those who are law-abiding and with residence permits
  have been arrested, while the Trump administration suggests that “criminality”
  is the main criterion for detention. Ice is on its way to becoming the biggest
  police force in the US, and the powers it wields, its high-octane arrests in
  public spaces (some including flash-bang grenades) and confrontations with the
  public, again conjure the appearance of a large, intractable problem, rather
  than solving it. Trump decided he wanted to deport millions, and if those
  millions don’t actually exist, then, through the invoking of old laws and
  their re-definitions, they can be created. Once he has secured the border by
  automatically deporting all who arrive on small boats, Farage intends to
  deport 600,000 people over the course of a five-year parliament. That is a
  number, like Trump’s, plucked from the air, and then whole plans are devised
  around it. And that path only goes in one direction: towards creating large
  enforcement agencies, rewriting or unpicking laws and even reinterpreting the
  concept of legal residence altogether. It is entirely foreseeable that those
  who arrived irregularly and were then granted leave to remain could be
  grandfathered into illegality and thus be added to the numbers of invaders. If
  you think that’s dramatic fortune-telling, you have not been paying attention.
  Once that sort of climate sets in, of a nation battling immigrants on the
  borders and in the streets and in their workplaces, then how can it be
  prevented from extending to British citizens? The very concept of Britishness
  is slipping, redefined already by some to mean “born in Britain”. When the
  academic Matthew Goodwin states that “more than 50% of social housing in
  London is now occupied by people who are not British”, he names a figure that
  corresponds to those not born in Britain, many of whom are naturalised
  citizens. The fixation on a non-native population with no rights then also
  extends that precariousness to those with citizenship. The result is that
  blended families, containing those with citizenship and those without, become
  tethered to those with the weakest protection. In the US, citizens, in some
  cases children, have been deported as part of the crackdown. One can make the
  argument that it doesn’t really matter what the facts or the numbers are,
  because asylum hotels are inflammatory and small boats make people feel
  deluged. And it is the job of politicians to assuage the public’s concerns and
  meet them where they are. But that assumes that the public is always in the
  same place, and not subject to political and media influences that reinforce a
  sense of crisis, and then constantly move it along to the next stage of
  crackdown. When Keir Starmer made his landmark speech announcing a raft of
  measures to ensure that migrants must “earn” the right to stay, the Daily Mail
  capslock headline was “NO CAP ON MIGRANTS IN LABOUR’S CRACKDOWN”. That is
  because the question at the heart of immigration crises isn’t “how many is too
  many”, but “how few is few enough”. The answer is “fewer than zero”. And
  because that is not a scenario that is possible, no matter what
  ever-escalating pledges, solutions or policies are offered, nothing will ever
  be enough. And each time that one decisive solution is executed – whether that
  be Brexit, increasing deportations, mobilising the navy – a chorus of voices
  will tell us that these are necessary placatory measures, and then promptly
  forget when the next one is demanded, and sign up to that as well. Nesrine
