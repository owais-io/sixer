  Kim Le Court won stage five of the Tour de France Femmes, becoming the first
  African rider to win a stage of the race. The Mauritian also took the yellow
  jersey from Marianne Vos, who lost time on her rivals after getting dropped by
  a breakaway. That’s the lot from me, both for today, and for the rest of the
  race. Thanks for reading and for emailing in and enjoy the remaining stages.
  It’s been fun. Goodbye! Julie Bego (Cofidis) leads the best young rider/white
  jersey competition. Nienke Vinke [Picnic PostNL] is second, 22sec down, Titia
  Ryo (Arkéa/B&amp;B Hotels) is third, 10min 15sec behind. 1) Chabbey 11pts 2)
  Smulders 6pts 3) Chapman 4pts 4) Van der Breggen 3pts 5) Garcia 2pts The real
  climbing points start tomorrow, of course. 1) Wiebes 208pts 2) Vos 178pts 3)
  Le Court 103pts 4) Vollering 84pts 5) Koch 70pts 6) Van der Breggen 70pts 7)
  Niewiadoma-Phinney 66pts 8) Jansen 54pts 9) Jackson 50pts 10) Ferrand-Prévot
  50pts In the end, the green jersey-wearer Wiebes lost 9min 04sec after being
  dropped during the late climbs. A big sort-out in GC, then. Le Court retakes
  yellow and leads overall by 18sec from Ferrand-Prévot. Ferrand-Prévot keeps
  saying how good she feels on the climbs, though, so she will be very confident
  of making that time up, and more, in the mountains. And then of course Demi
  Vollering, 23sec down, is a huge threat along with fourth-placed Kasia
  Niewiadoma-Phinney, the reigning champion, who is 24sec behind the leader.
  With four stages remaining the overall winner will surely be among those four
  riders. Vollering has recovered well after that heavy crash on Monday, too, so
  it’s all to play for. Vos drops to sixth overall having lost 33sec today. 1)
  Kim Le Court 15hr 07min 14sec 2) Pauline Ferrand-Prévot +18sec 3) Demi
  Vollering +23sec 4) Kasia Niewiadoma-Phinney +24sec 5) Anna van der Breggen
  _27sec 6) Marianne Vos +37sec 7) Pauliena Rooijakkers +45sec 8) Sarah Gigante
  +55sec 9) Puck Pieterse +1min 04sec 10) Cedrine Kerbaol +1min 16sec “It was
  very punchy,” says Pauline Ferrand-Prevot of Visma-Lease A Bike, one of the
  main GC contenders. “Maybe a bit too much for me. I was happy to finish at the
  front. In the end it’s a pretty good day for us. We didn’t lose time on GC, so
  it’s perfect. I am feeling good uphill. I am looking forward to the uphill
  stages. “It’s great [leading the team]. We have a good time together. It’s
  good to be with a team who really commit to this GC goal. We will go as far as
  we can.” “I’m so proud of Kim, but the whole team,” says Dani Christmas, the
  AG Insurance–Soudal DS, who is also a pundit with TNT Sports. “We have a whole
  staff, working day and night, to make this possible. “Sarah Gigante did an
  incredible ride today. My respect for Sarah goes up and up and up when I see
  her race … but it’s all the riders, every watt of energy that the leaders can
  save, they can use it when it really matters. And they can only do that with
  the support of the whole team. We have to tip our hats to them.” 1) Kim Le
  Court 3hr 54min 07sec 2) Demi Vollering (same time) 3) Anna Van der Breggen 4)
  Kasia Niewiadoma-Phinney 5) Pauline Ferrand-Prevot 6) Sarah Gigante 7)
  Pauliena Rooijakers 8) Mariane Vos +33sec 9) Évita Muzic +33sec 10) Elise
  Chabbey +33sec The first African to win a TdF Femmes stage, Kim Le Court,
  speaks. “We came in with a clear plan, first to stay safe … it was difficult
  because it was flat and fast, a lot of big crashes … then the big goal was to
  take the bonus sprint, which I managed to do, then try for the victory … it
  was difficult in the finish, I went around the [final] corner in front and it
  was a bit further than I expected, but my kick was the best in the group. “I
  couldn’t have done it without a teammate [Sarah Gigante]. Teamwork is what you
  need in the sport.” Did she celebrate too early? “No, I don’t think so. When
  you’re on the bike … you can see you have the speed, and you’ll cross the line
  first. Maybe I gave a bit of a fright to people watching at home … Luckily for
  me, I had enough gap.” Vos, the outgoing race leader, sprinted in 33sec down
  and finished eighth. Le Court did indeed win it, by about the length of half a
  bike wheel, but that looked like an unnecessary risk to sit up with Vollering
  still sprinting! She will be in yellow, which is huge for African cycling. She
  sat up to celebrate, and took a big risk, but I think the Mauritian rider got
  it … Vollering was coming up very fast, and finishes second. Van der Breggen
  third. 600m to go: Van der Breggen squeezes through on the left and attacks.
  1km to go: The road kicks up slightly as the front group of seven enters the
  final 1,000m. 1.5km to go: So it’s Le Court, Ferrand-Prevot,
  Niewiadoma-Phinney, Vollering, Van der Breggen, Rooijakkers and Gigante. One
  of those will win the stage. 2km to go: Up front, there seems to be a bit of
  hesitation. Vos, in the second group with nine riders, is working hard but the
  gap is still 28sec. 3km to go: Wiebes is going to lose a whopping 6min 30sec
  as it stands! 4km to go: Niewiadoma-Phinney is pushing on the descent, at the
  head of the race. Vos is struggling to make any of this time up, such is the
  hot pace being set by the front group. 5km to go: Van der Breggen, Le Court
  and Niewiadoma-Phinney was the one-two-three on that final climb, Le Maupuy.
  6km to go: Now it’s a flat-out sprint downhill to the finish. Can Vos, the
  supreme bike handler, make up the time on the descent? She has half a minute
  to make up … 7.5km to go: A front group of seven powers up the climb. Le
  Court, Ferrand-Prevot, Niewiadoma-Phinney, Vollering, Van der Breggen,
  Rooijakkers and Gigante are there. One of those riders will win, surely, after
  they hit the top of the climb first. Back down the hill, Vos is trying
  desperately to get back in touch. 8km to go: In the virtual GC, Le Court is
  now 2sec behind Vos. 8.5km to go: Le Court takes the 6sec bonus! That was a
  big sprint. Ferrand-Prevot second (4sec), Niewiadoma-Phinney third (2sec). 9km
  to go: The bonus point, or bonification point as I prefer to call it, is
  coming up. 9.5km to go: Squiban is about to be caught. We’re on the final
  climb, Le Maupuy. It’s 2.8km long, with an average gradient of 5.4%. 10km to
  go: The chase is on from behind with Canyon/Sram taking it up. Squiban is now
  out front on her own, but realistically her days look numbered. 10.5km to go:
  Just 5sec for the break now. 11km to go: “Riders are getting dropped all the
  time,” says Slappendel on the TNT bike. “And the course favours the breakaway,
  it’s super-technical.” 11km to go: The five up front are: Maeva Squiban (UAE
  Team ADQ), Shirin van Anrooij (Lidl-Trek), Silke Smulders (Liv AlUla Jayco),
  Dilyxine Miermont (CERATIZIT Pro Cycling Team) and Brodie Chapman (UAE Team
  ADQ). 13km to go: It’s all happening. Silke Smulders (Liv AlUla Jayco) stamps
  on the pedals and tries to distance her four breakaway companions … the gap
  grows slightly to 15sec as a result. 14.5km to go: Vos attacks from the main
  bunch! The five escapees have 12sec. 15km to go: More attacks off the front.
  Plenty of riders are interested in getting in on this breakaway if they can.
  But the five up front still have 11sec. Wiebes has dropped to 1min 23sec
  behind the main bunch. 16km to go: And it’s now five up front: Chapman,
  Miermont, Squiban, Smulders and Van Anrooij. They have 12sec. Can they work
  together to keep the chasing peloton at bay? 16km to go: Now, Smulders and
  Squiban join Chapman on the front. 18km to go: Who, in the main bunch, has
  been harbouring the idea of a late attack for the stage? Here is the answer:
  Eline Jansen (Volkerwessels) has powered off the front of the yellow jersey
  group. Wiebes is still 39sec down. We can safely say that any slim hope she
  may have had of a stage win is gone. But she was never likely to stay in touch
  with the fastest riders on these climbs, anyway. 19km to go: Wiebes is still
  in trouble, 47sec down on the bunch now. Chapman (UAE Team ADQ) is fighting,
  up front, and has 11sec. She took 2pts on the last climb. 21km to go: Chapman
  is speeding down the descent. There is a flattish 10km or so before the final
  climb (Le Maupuy). Then, to finish the stage, there is a downhill section,
  which could spice things up further. 23km to go: Lotte Kopecky (SD
  Worx-Protime) has dropped back to assist Wiebes, who has been put into major
  difficulty on this second categorised climb by the injection of pace up front.
  Up front, Chapman crests the climb of the Côte du Peyroux, but her days look
  numbered. The yellow jersey group is just 16sec down now. 23.5km to go:
  Fenix–Deceuninck are the ones doing much of the work on the front of the bunch
  now. Mind you Movistar and Canyon/Sram are visible at the front, too. 24km to
  go: Yara Kastelijn (Fenix–Deceuninck) is putting in a massive turn on the
  front of the bunch, up the Côte du Peyroux, and that bunch is splintering as a
  result. Suddenly the gap between break and bunch is 32sec. 25km to go: Jackson
  has cracked! Barale rides on ahead of her … but the new race leader is Brodie
  Chapman (UAE Team ADQ), who has ridden off alone. 28km to go: After today,
  there are three mountain stages, and one hilly stage. The biggest day of
  climbing is on Saturday – Chambery to the Col de la Madeleine – that packs in
  3,520m of vertical ascent. 30km to go: “Truly, the Tour de France starts
  tomorrow for the GC, and everyone wants to save energy,” says Iris Slappendel.
  (This was apparently something said by the Movistar DS, who said they are keen
  for a stage win, but that the GC is the ultimate aim.) Slappendel said that
  AG-Insurance were helping Movistar with the chase for a while there while
  Visma-Lease A Bike were not quite so keen to get involved. 31km to go: Do you
  think this break can stay away? They are looking strong, and the peloton may
  struggle to get the chase organised on the upcoming climbs. 33.5km to go:
  Three riders up front now: Barale, Jackson, Chapman. Dijkstra and Soto
  dropped. The gap to the yellow jersey group is 1min 46sec. Six distinct groups
  on the road, including Kristyna Burlova at the back, who is still trying to
  get back in touch with the peloton. 34km to go: The gap between bunch and
  break is now 1min 51sec. Visma-Lease A Bike now seem to be the team doing most
  of the pulling on the front. 35km to go: The five-rider break is about to hit
  the first KOM point, atop the small climb of the Côte de Chabannes. Chapman
  takes 2pts, Barale 1pt in the KOM competition. 1) Jackson 25pts 2) Barale
  20pts 3) Soto Campos 17pts 4) Chapman 15pts 5) Dijkstra (13pts) 6) Wiebes
  (11pts) 7) Vos (10pts) 8) Kastelijn (9pts) 9) Dygert (8pts) 10 Le Court (7pts)
  Wiebes and Vos were the only ones who sprinted from the peloton. Vos looked
  happy enough to let Wiebes take sixth. What is one green jersey point between
  rivals? 38km to go: Wiebes sprints! Vos follows … 38.5km to go: Alison Jackson
  takes maximum points at the sprint. Wiebes, Vos and Koch are all prominent at
  the front of the bunch as they now approach the sprint point. 39km to go: Here
  comes the intermediate sprint at Dun-le-Palestel. 40km to go: “I think it will
  be hard for the break to make it to the finish,” says Iris Slappendel on the
  TNT Sports motorbike. “Some teams, especially Movistar, don’t want to give
  them too much space. Liane Lippert is not a GC rider, but she is the kind of
  rider really suited for this kind of finale. The GC riders will also come into
  play … not everyone is interested in controlling, some teams are “playing
  poker” …” 41km to go: The peloton makes yet more inroads. The gap is down to
  2min. The sprint is coming up in under 3km. 45km to go: Brodie Chapman puts in
  a turn at the front. Then Anneke Dijkstra takes it up again. Unfortunately for
  them, despite their efforts, the gap is still falling. It’s down to 2min 40sec
  now. Meanwhile, Marion Bunel (Visma-Lease A Bike) is still trying to get back
  into the bunch following that crash earlier. She’s currently among the team
  cars, while Kristyna Burlova (Ceratizit) is even further back, 5min 50sec
  behind the front of the race. 47km to go: The peloton speeds through the town
  of Saint-Germain-Beaupré. Any famous inhabitants? Not according to Wiki. 49km
  to go: A mere 10km to the intermediate sprint. After that the riders will
  almost immediately hit the first climb, the Côte de Chabannes. 52km to go:
  Still, it is Movistar Team driving the peloton. They are doing a good job too
  because the gap to the break has fallen to 3min. Liane Lippert will have
  designs on the stage win today. Movistar have lost Marlen Reusser, who packed
  it in a couple of days ago, while Ana Magalhães was in the break yesterday,
  but still they are looking very strong. 54km to go: Alison Jackson (EF
  Education-Oatly), one of the escapees, won Paris-Roubaix Femmes in 2023. She
  also won a stage of the Vuelta España Femenina last season. Brodie Chapman
  (UAE Team ADQ), meanwhile, won the Race Torquay in 2020. Slightly less
  prestigious than Paris-Roubaix, but a win is a win. 56km to go: The gap is
  down to 3min 31 sec. Clearly, the likes of Movistar are not willing to let
  this gap get out of control. 59km to go: It seems certain that these five
  riders will mop up the major points at the intermediate sprint, with 39km
  remaining. The sixth rider over the line will win 11pts in the green jersey
  classification. 60km to go: Anneke Dijkstra does a turn on the front of the
  escape group, then drops back and lets someone else have a go. With 3min
  50sec, do they have a chance of staying away until the end? The peloton snakes
  through a sharp right-hander and then across a bridge over the Autoroute A20
  L’Occitane. 61km to go: The gap between break and peloton has fallen to 3min
  50sec. Movistar are working hard on the front. 64km to go: With 584km raced,
  the halfway point of the Tour de France Femmes has just been passed. 65km to
  go: The gap between break and peloton is 4min 21sec. Lylyk (Winspace Orange
  Seal) has given up on her attempt to get in the breakaway and is swallowed up
  by the peloton. 66km to go: Needless to say, seconds after the live pictures
  appeared, it was time for a commercial break. That meant we missed a crash
  back in the bunch. Marion Bunel (Visma-Lease A Bike) and Elyne Roussel (St
  Michel - Preference Home - Auber93) both went down, but both are back on their
  bikes and riding. 70km to go: It’s 31km until the front of the race reaches
  the day’s intermediate sprint, at Dun-le-Palestel. 71km to go: It’s 4min 36sec
  for the break, and Lylyk is still trying to get across, but she’s 3min 16sec
  down. It’s a brave move but surely she is going to struggle trying to get
  across to these five up front. 75km to go: Kristen Faulkner (EF
  Education–Oatly) has abandoned following one of the earlier crashes. She also
  suffered a crash late yesterday. Maria Giulia Confalonieri (Uno-X Mobility)
  has also packed it in. Sad for those riders and teams. Elisa Balsamo
  (Lidl-Trek) and (as mentioned earlier) Monica Trinca Colonel (Liv-AlUla-Jayco)
  have also abandoned. Balsamo is a huge loss to the race. 76km to go: “There
  has been chaos in the peloton. Two big crashes,” says Iris Slappendel on the
  TNT Sports motorbike. “We’ve had some DNFs today and that is really sad. The
  roads have been very narrow … and tailwind … and a big fight to get in the
  break. “It’s again a really nervous day in the peloton … the girls in the
  break are out of trouble and able to ride their own race.” 77km to go: Kiara
  Lylyk (Winspace Orange Seal) is trying to get across to the break. But she is
  2min 35 behind. 78km to go: The advantage of the five up front has flown out
  to 3min 23sec. The closest rider in the break on GC is Barale, and she is 8min
  24sec down, so it looks like the GC teams are happy for these five up front to
  contest the win? 86km to go: Why not send me an email? Merci. 82km to go:
  “Really looking forward to today,” said Kim Le Court (AG Insurance–Soudal)
  earlier. “If the legs are there we are going to try and grab yellow. For sure
  it’s going to be a fight. “The yellow is in our minds, but it’s more important
  to take some seconds in GC. If we can finish in a small group, then for sure,
  we’ll go for the win.” 87km to go: Five riders up front now: Alison Jackson
  (EF Education-Oatly), Brodie Chapman (UAE Team ADQ), Francesca Barale (Team
  Picnic PostNL), Catalina Anais Soto (Laboral Kutxa-Fundación Euskadi) and
  Anneke Dijkstra (VolkerWessels Cycling Team). They have 1min 45sec on the
  peloton. 87km to go: Barale, Jackson, Dijkstra and Soto Campos are now up
  front together and they have 1min 35sec on the bunch. There are other riders
  trying to get across. Now, in the UK, we have live coverage but still no live
  pictures. Is this good enough, on the part of race organisers, ASO? I don’t
  think so. “For sure, it will be a fast race again, because the wind is quite
  strong and we have a tailwind,” Ferrand-Prévot of Visma-Lease A Bike said this
  morning. “It will be important to be in a good position, and to start the last
  climb in the top positions. “We want to win the stage with Marianne, and keep
  me in good position in GC … we want to be good, but also to save some energy
  for the last days … the last three days will be hard enough to make the
  difference. We have to find the balance.” 93km to go: “I recovered good,”
  Vollering said before today’s stage. “I already feel better today than
  yesterday. It was a relief to be able to ride, because my neck was so stiff
  [after the crash on Monday] … today is a really nice day, super-close to our
  service course – there will be a lot of people cheering, and I am looking
  forward to our “home” race. “We focus every day as a team, on what we can do.
  Yeah, step by step.” 97km to go: According to TNT Sports, Elisa Balsamo
  (Lidl-Trek) has abandoned following an earlier crash that involved about 15
  riders. There are two more withdrawals on the official page, that have
  appeared in the last hour or so, but Balsamo is not among them. Monica Trinca
  Colonel (Liv-Alula-Jayco) and Katrine Aalerud (UnoX-Mobility) are the latest
  withdrawals listed. More to follow. 99km to go: The Côte de Chabannes (1.4km,
  5.2%) is the first climb of the day. It’s a category four. Then the Cote du
  Peyroux (3.3km, 4.3%), another cat-four, then the category-three Le Maupay to
  finish (2.8km, 5.4%). All those climbs come in the last 40km or so. 102km to
  go: Dijkstra and Barale are now working together up front and they have 1min
  27sec on the chasing bunch. Two chasers are in between the peloton and the
  leaders: Alison Jackson (EF Education-Oatly) and Catalina Soto (Laboral
  Kutxa–Fundación Euskadi). They are 20sec behind. 107km to go: Anneke Dijkstra
  (VolkerWessels) is trying to bridge across to the solo attacker, Barale. 109km
  to go: Francesa Barale (Picnic PostNL) has attacked and has 40sec on the
  peloton. Picnic PostNL are certainly trying to animate the race. The average
  speed has gone up to 46.7km/h. 111km to go: “Today we’re going to try to do
  something special, why not take back the yellow jersey?” Not my words, the
  words of Kim Le Court (AG Insurance-Soudal), currently third in GC, before
  today’s stage. 112km to go: Wiebes, in fact, crashed earlier and that is the
  reason she was off the back of the bunch. Sounds like there is no serious harm
  done, however, and she is back and riding in the peloton. 115km to go: I take
  it back about things being calm in the peloton. This was in fact the fastest
  first hour of the race so far. 118km to go: Anna Van der Breggen also dropped
  back to help Wiebes back into the peloton. Meanwhile, Visma-Lease A Bike are
  controlling on the front of the bunch. 128km to go: I wonder how Vollering is
  feeling after her crash two days ago. It’s entirely possible that the injuries
  are more painful today. Yesterday, Jos van Emden, the Visma-Lease a Bike DS,
  claimed that FDJ-Suez want Vollering in “a gilded cage”, after Vollering and
  her team complained about a lack of respect in the peloton. “What he’s saying
  is ridiculous,” Jos van Emden, the team director at Visma-Lease a bike, told
  Dutch media after an outburst by his counterpart Stephen Delcourt. “Apparently
  he wants a peloton of eight riders, with Demi in it, to ride in a gilded cage.
  He’s simply been influenced by Demi, by Demi’s posturing.” 129km to go:
  Wiebes, in the green jersey, is 13sec behind the peloton with a teammate,
  Blanka Vas. Probably a mechanical and no harm done, presuming they catch up
  with the bunch without too much trouble. 132km to go: “The strategy is to go
  for victory with Marianne without losing time overall for me,” said
  Ferrand-Prevot earlier, of the Visma-Lease A Bike drill for today’s stage.
  134km to go: Linda Zanetti (Uno-X Mobility) is the latest to give it a crack.
  She is caught. 141km to go: Now Elena Cecchini (SD Worx-ProTime) has clipped
  off the front, solo, and has 33sec on the peloton. Even so, the average speed
  of the overall race has dropped further, to 43.7km/h. 144km to go: Elena
  Hartmann (Ceratzit) and Victoire Berteau (Cofidis) did launch a cheeky little
  attack, but they’ve now been caught. 145km to go: I don’t currently have the
  luxury of live pictures, but the average speed – 44.6km/h – would suggest
  things are relatively calm in the peloton. Relatively being the operative
  word. 150km to go: Vos’s ability, combined with the time she’s spent at the
  top of the sport, is nothing short of astonishing. I’m old enough to remember
  her beating Lizzie Deignan (then Armitstead) to the women’s road race gold
  medal at London 2012. 152km to go: “We’ll have to see how the day will go,”
  said the race leader Marianne Vos before today’s stage. “It’s the longest
  stage and there is more climbing in the final. Every rider, the whole bunch
  wants to be in the breakaway today. So it’s going to be an especially tough
  start.” Regarding the points classification battle with Lorena Wiebes (SD
  Worx-Protime) –the green-jersey wearer Wiebes leads Vos by 40pts – she said:
  “Lorena has a good advantage, and as we said up front, that’s not the main
  target. With Lorena as competition you know that’s going to be hard.” Quotes
  via LeTourFemmes.fr 154km to go: Franziska Koch (Picnic–PostNL) has gone on
  the attack yet again. She was really strong yesterday and spent most of the
  day in a two-rider break. And she’s obviously feeling good … however, the
  peloton is all together, after Franziska Brausse (Ceratizit) chased Koch down.
  The Polish rider Agnieszka Skalniak-Sojka, of Canyon/Sram-zondacrypto, was the
  solitary withdrawal before today’s race. You can see the full list of
  abandonments here on the official site. “She’ll be deeply missed but above
  all, we’re hoping that she recovers quickly,” the team wrote on X. There are
  143 riders remaining. We are racing. No, they are racing. The temperature,
  according to the official site, is a mere 22.5C. That is almost wintry by the
  standards of the Tour de France. 1) Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime) 197pts 2) Vos
  (Visma-Lease A Bike) 157pts 3) Koch (Picnic PostNL) 70pts 4) Le Court Pienaar
  (AG Insurance-Soudal Team) 66pts 5) Vollering (FDJ-Suez) 59pts 6) Jansen
  (Volkerwessels Cycling Team) 54pts 7) Van der Breggen (SD Worx-Protime) 48pts
  8) Niewiadoma-Phinney (Canyon/Sram) 47pts 9) Bossuyt (AG Insurance-Soudal
  Team) 39pts 10) Lippert (Movistar Team) 35pts Speaking after yesterday’s
  stage, Pauline Ferrand Prévot (Team Visma-Lease A Bike) said she is looking
  forward to the road going up … she’s feeling good, clearly, and will be making
  an assault on the GC in the high mountains. With the top 10 all within 31sec
  of race leader Marianne Vos it is all looking extremely well poised for the
  mountain stages. Christian Prudhomme, director of the men’s race, said over
  the weekend he had hoped for “more of a duel” between Tadej Pogacar and Jonas
  Vingegaard in the GC. Well, here is the tight overall battle he wanted. Today,
  you suspect, will not be a GC day, but here is the top 10: 1) Marianne Vos
  (Team Visma-Lease A Bike) 11hr 13min 11sec 2) Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime)
  +12sec 3) Kimberley Le Court Pienaar (AG Insurance-Soudal) +12sec 4) Pauline
  Ferrand Prévot (Team Visma-Lease A Bike) +18sec 5) Katarzyna
  Niewiadoma-Phinney (Canyon/Sram Zondacrypto) +22sec 6) Demi Vollering
  (FDJ-Suez) +25sec 7) Anna Van der Breggen (SD Worx-Protime) +27sec 8) Puck
  Pieterse (Fenix-Deceuninck) +27sec 9) Niamh Fisher-Black (Lidl-Trek) +31sec
  10) Chloe Dygert (Canyon/Sram Zondacrypto) +31sec That, of course, is Jeremy
  Whittle’s stage report from yesterday, which you have ample time to peruse
  before today’s hostilities. Lorena Wiebes secured her second stage win in the
  2025 Tour de France Femmes on the Avenue John Kennedy in Poitiers, after again
  fending off her Dutch compatriot Marianne Vos in an uphill sprint. Wiebes, who
  also won the Italian classic Milan-San Remo and the the points classification
  in the Giro d’Italia, described 2025 as her “best season to date”. She has
  also won five Giro stages between from 2021-2025. “I have tried to have more
  of a free mindset, like I had in the Giro,” Wiebes, of Team SD Worx-Protime,
  said. “This season has already been really good, even if I hadn’t won in the
  Tour de France. It doesn’t feel like we have a lot of pressure from the team.”
  The profile of stage five, between Chasseneuil-du-Poitou and Guéret, looks
  ripe for a breakaway in the final: there are three categorised climbs inside
  the last 36km, two category fours and one category three, after a relatively
  flat 130km or so. However, the location of the day’s intermediate sprint, at
  Dun-le-Palestel after 127km, may lead certain teams to try and control the
  race until then. Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx–Protime), who leads the green jersey
  standings after two stage wins in two days, said yesterday she may try to get
  in breakaways to fight for more points. But perhaps Marianne Vos, the overall
  leader and yellow-jersey wearer, and her Visma-Lease A Bike team will lend a
  hand in controlling things. At 165.8km, this transitional stage is the longest
  of this year’s race. It will be interesting to see how fierce the battle to
  form an early breakaway becomes, because there are already plenty of tired
  bodies in the peloton, with a few teams and riders hoping for a relatively
  easy day with a non-threatening breakaway allowed up the road. This being the
  Tour de France Femmes, though, it’ll probably be flat-out all the way. Stage

Kim Le Court won stage five of the Tour de France Femmes, becoming the first African rider to win a stage of the race. The Mauritian also took the yellow jersey from Marianne Vos, who lost time on her rivals after getting dropped by a breakaway. That’s the lot from me, both for today, and for the rest of the race. Thanks for reading and for emailing in and enjoy the remaining stages. It’s been fun. Goodbye! Julie Bego (Cofidis) leads the best young rider/white jersey competition. Nienke Vinke [Picnic PostNL] is second, 22sec down, Titia Ryo (Arkéa/B&amp;B Hotels) is third, 10min 15sec behind. 1) Chabbey 11pts 2) Smulders 6pts 3) Chapman 4pts 4) Van der Breggen 3pts 5) Garcia 2pts The real climbing points start tomorrow, of course. 1) Wiebes 208pts 2) Vos 178pts 3) Le Court 103pts 4) Vollering 84pts 5) Koch 70pts 6) Van der Breggen 70pts 7) Niewiadoma-Phinney 66pts 8) Jansen 54pts 9) Jackson 50pts 10) Ferrand-Prévot 50pts In the end, the green jersey-wearer Wiebes lost 9min 04sec after being dropped during the late climbs. A big sort-out in GC, then. Le Court retakes yellow and leads overall by 18sec from Ferrand-Prévot. Ferrand-Prévot keeps saying how good she feels on the climbs, though, so she will be very confident of making that time up, and more, in the mountains. And then of course Demi Vollering, 23sec down, is a huge threat along with fourth-placed Kasia Niewiadoma-Phinney, the reigning champion, who is 24sec behind the leader. With four stages remaining the overall winner will surely be among those four riders. Vollering has recovered well after that heavy crash on Monday, too, so it’s all to play for. Vos drops to sixth overall having lost 33sec today. 1) Kim Le Court 15hr 07min 14sec 2) Pauline Ferrand-Prévot +18sec 3) Demi Vollering +23sec 4) Kasia Niewiadoma-Phinney +24sec 5) Anna van der Breggen _27sec 6) Marianne Vos +37sec 7) Pauliena Rooijakkers +45sec 8) Sarah Gigante +55sec 9) Puck Pieterse +1min 04sec 10) Cedrine Kerbaol +1min 16sec “It was very punchy,” says Pauline Ferrand-Prevot of Visma-Lease A Bike, one of the main GC contenders. “Maybe a bit too much for me. I was happy to finish at the front. In the end it’s a pretty good day for us. We didn’t lose time on GC, so it’s perfect. I am feeling good uphill. I am looking forward to the uphill stages. “It’s great [leading the team]. We have a good time together. It’s good to be with a team who really commit to this GC goal. We will go as far as we can.” “I’m so proud of Kim, but the whole team,” says Dani Christmas, the AG Insurance–Soudal DS, who is also a pundit with TNT Sports. “We have a whole staff, working day and night, to make this possible. “Sarah Gigante did an incredible ride today. My respect for Sarah goes up and up and up when I see her race … but it’s all the riders, every watt of energy that the leaders can save, they can use it when it really matters. And they can only do that with the support of the whole team. We have to tip our hats to them.” 1) Kim Le Court 3hr 54min 07sec 2) Demi Vollering (same time) 3) Anna Van der Breggen 4) Kasia Niewiadoma-Phinney 5) Pauline Ferrand-Prevot 6) Sarah Gigante 7) Pauliena Rooijakers 8) Mariane Vos +33sec 9) Évita Muzic +33sec 10) Elise Chabbey +33sec The first African to win a TdF Femmes stage, Kim Le Court, speaks. “We came in with a clear plan, first to stay safe … it was difficult because it was flat and fast, a lot of big crashes … then the big goal was to take the bonus sprint, which I managed to do, then try for the victory … it was difficult in the finish, I went around the [final] corner in front and it was a bit further than I expected, but my kick was the best in the group. “I couldn’t have done it without a teammate [Sarah Gigante]. Teamwork is what you need in the sport.” Did she celebrate too early? “No, I don’t think so. When you’re on the bike … you can see you have the speed, and you’ll cross the line first. Maybe I gave a bit of a fright to people watching at home … Luckily for me, I had enough gap.” Vos, the outgoing race leader, sprinted in 33sec down and finished eighth. Le Court did indeed win it, by about the length of half a bike wheel, but that looked like an unnecessary risk to sit up with Vollering still sprinting! She will be in yellow, which is huge for African cycling. She sat up to celebrate, and took a big risk, but I think the Mauritian rider got it … Vollering was coming up very fast, and finishes second. Van der Breggen third. 600m to go: Van der Breggen squeezes through on the left and attacks. 1km to go: The road kicks up slightly as the front group of seven enters the final 1,000m. 1.5km to go: So it’s Le Court, Ferrand-Prevot, Niewiadoma-Phinney, Vollering, Van der Breggen, Rooijakkers and Gigante. One of those will win the stage. 2km to go: Up front, there seems to be a bit of hesitation. Vos, in the second group with nine riders, is working hard but the gap is still 28sec. 3km to go: Wiebes is going to lose a whopping 6min 30sec as it stands! 4km to go: Niewiadoma-Phinney is pushing on the descent, at the head of the race. Vos is struggling to make any of this time up, such is the hot pace being set by the front group. 5km to go: Van der Breggen, Le Court and Niewiadoma-Phinney was the one-two-three on that final climb, Le Maupuy. 6km to go: Now it’s a flat-out sprint downhill to the finish. Can Vos, the supreme bike handler, make up the time on the descent? She has half a minute to make up … 7.5km to go: A front group of seven powers up the climb. Le Court, Ferrand-Prevot, Niewiadoma-Phinney, Vollering, Van der Breggen, Rooijakkers and Gigante are there. One of those riders will win, surely, after they hit the top of the climb first. Back down the hill, Vos is trying desperately to get back in touch. 8km to go: In the virtual GC, Le Court is now 2sec behind Vos. 8.5km to go: Le Court takes the 6sec bonus! That was a big sprint. Ferrand-Prevot second (4sec), Niewiadoma-Phinney third (2sec). 9km to go: The bonus point, or bonification point as I prefer to call it, is coming up. 9.5km to go: Squiban is about to be caught. We’re on the final climb, Le Maupuy. It’s 2.8km long, with an average gradient of 5.4%. 10km to go: The chase is on from behind with Canyon/Sram taking it up. Squiban is now out front on her own, but realistically her days look numbered. 10.5km to go: Just 5sec for the break now. 11km to go: “Riders are getting dropped all the time,” says Slappendel on the TNT bike. “And the course favours the breakaway, it’s super-technical.” 11km to go: The five up front are: Maeva Squiban (UAE Team ADQ), Shirin van Anrooij (Lidl-Trek), Silke Smulders (Liv AlUla Jayco), Dilyxine Miermont (CERATIZIT Pro Cycling Team) and Brodie Chapman (UAE Team ADQ). 13km to go: It’s all happening. Silke Smulders (Liv AlUla Jayco) stamps on the pedals and tries to distance her four breakaway companions … the gap grows slightly to 15sec as a result. 14.5km to go: Vos attacks from the main bunch! The five escapees have 12sec. 15km to go: More attacks off the front. Plenty of riders are interested in getting in on this breakaway if they can. But the five up front still have 11sec. Wiebes has dropped to 1min 23sec behind the main bunch. 16km to go: And it’s now five up front: Chapman, Miermont, Squiban, Smulders and Van Anrooij. They have 12sec. Can they work together to keep the chasing peloton at bay? 16km to go: Now, Smulders and Squiban join Chapman on the front. 18km to go: Who, in the main bunch, has been harbouring the idea of a late attack for the stage? Here is the answer: Eline Jansen (Volkerwessels) has powered off the front of the yellow jersey group. Wiebes is still 39sec down. We can safely say that any slim hope she may have had of a stage win is gone. But she was never likely to stay in touch with the fastest riders on these climbs, anyway. 19km to go: Wiebes is still in trouble, 47sec down on the bunch now. Chapman (UAE Team ADQ) is fighting, up front, and has 11sec. She took 2pts on the last climb. 21km to go: Chapman is speeding down the descent. There is a flattish 10km or so before the final climb (Le Maupuy). Then, to finish the stage, there is a downhill section, which could spice things up further. 23km to go: Lotte Kopecky (SD Worx-Protime) has dropped back to assist Wiebes, who has been put into major difficulty on this second categorised climb by the injection of pace up front. Up front, Chapman crests the climb of the Côte du Peyroux, but her days look numbered. The yellow jersey group is just 16sec down now. 23.5km to go: Fenix–Deceuninck are the ones doing much of the work on the front of the bunch now. Mind you Movistar and Canyon/Sram are visible at the front, too. 24km to go: Yara Kastelijn (Fenix–Deceuninck) is putting in a massive turn on the front of the bunch, up the Côte du Peyroux, and that bunch is splintering as a result. Suddenly the gap between break and bunch is 32sec. 25km to go: Jackson has cracked! Barale rides on ahead of her … but the new race leader is Brodie Chapman (UAE Team ADQ), who has ridden off alone. 28km to go: After today, there are three mountain stages, and one hilly stage. The biggest day of climbing is on Saturday – Chambery to the Col de la Madeleine – that packs in 3,520m of vertical ascent. 30km to go: “Truly, the Tour de France starts tomorrow for the GC, and everyone wants to save energy,” says Iris Slappendel. (This was apparently something said by the Movistar DS, who said they are keen for a stage win, but that the GC is the ultimate aim.) Slappendel said that AG-Insurance were helping Movistar with the chase for a while there while Visma-Lease A Bike were not quite so keen to get involved. 31km to go: Do you think this break can stay away? They are looking strong, and the peloton may struggle to get the chase organised on the upcoming climbs. 33.5km to go: Three riders up front now: Barale, Jackson, Chapman. Dijkstra and Soto dropped. The gap to the yellow jersey group is 1min 46sec. Six distinct groups on the road, including Kristyna Burlova at the back, who is still trying to get back in touch with the peloton. 34km to go: The gap between bunch and break is now 1min 51sec. Visma-Lease A Bike now seem to be the team doing most of the pulling on the front. 35km to go: The five-rider break is about to hit the first KOM point, atop the small climb of the Côte de Chabannes. Chapman takes 2pts, Barale 1pt in the KOM competition. 1) Jackson 25pts 2) Barale 20pts 3) Soto Campos 17pts 4) Chapman 15pts 5) Dijkstra (13pts) 6) Wiebes (11pts) 7) Vos (10pts) 8) Kastelijn (9pts) 9) Dygert (8pts) 10 Le Court (7pts) Wiebes and Vos were the only ones who sprinted from the peloton. Vos looked happy enough to let Wiebes take sixth. What is one green jersey point between rivals? 38km to go: Wiebes sprints! Vos follows … 38.5km to go: Alison Jackson takes maximum points at the sprint. Wiebes, Vos and Koch are all prominent at the front of the bunch as they now approach the sprint point. 39km to go: Here comes the intermediate sprint at Dun-le-Palestel. 40km to go: “I think it will be hard for the break to make it to the finish,” says Iris Slappendel on the TNT Sports motorbike. “Some teams, especially Movistar, don’t want to give them too much space. Liane Lippert is not a GC rider, but she is the kind of rider really suited for this kind of finale. The GC riders will also come into play … not everyone is interested in controlling, some teams are “playing poker” …” 41km to go: The peloton makes yet more inroads. The gap is down to 2min. The sprint is coming up in under 3km. 45km to go: Brodie Chapman puts in a turn at the front. Then Anneke Dijkstra takes it up again. Unfortunately for them, despite their efforts, the gap is still falling. It’s down to 2min 40sec now. Meanwhile, Marion Bunel (Visma-Lease A Bike) is still trying to get back into the bunch following that crash earlier. She’s currently among the team cars, while Kristyna Burlova (Ceratizit) is even further back, 5min 50sec behind the front of the race. 47km to go: The peloton speeds through the town of Saint-Germain-Beaupré. Any famous inhabitants? Not according to Wiki. 49km to go: A mere 10km to the intermediate sprint. After that the riders will almost immediately hit the first climb, the Côte de Chabannes. 52km to go: Still, it is Movistar Team driving the peloton. They are doing a good job too because the gap to the break has fallen to 3min. Liane Lippert will have designs on the stage win today. Movistar have lost Marlen Reusser, who packed it in a couple of days ago, while Ana Magalhães was in the break yesterday, but still they are looking very strong. 54km to go: Alison Jackson (EF Education-Oatly), one of the escapees, won Paris-Roubaix Femmes in 2023. She also won a stage of the Vuelta España Femenina last season. Brodie Chapman (UAE Team ADQ), meanwhile, won the Race Torquay in 2020. Slightly less prestigious than Paris-Roubaix, but a win is a win. 56km to go: The gap is down to 3min 31 sec. Clearly, the likes of Movistar are not willing to let this gap get out of control. 59km to go: It seems certain that these five riders will mop up the major points at the intermediate sprint, with 39km remaining. The sixth rider over the line will win 11pts in the green jersey classification. 60km to go: Anneke Dijkstra does a turn on the front of the escape group, then drops back and lets someone else have a go. With 3min 50sec, do they have a chance of staying away until the end? The peloton snakes through a sharp right-hander and then across a bridge over the Autoroute A20 L’Occitane. 61km to go: The gap between break and peloton has fallen to 3min 50sec. Movistar are working hard on the front. 64km to go: With 584km raced, the halfway point of the Tour de France Femmes has just been passed. 65km to go: The gap between break and peloton is 4min 21sec. Lylyk (Winspace Orange Seal) has given up on her attempt to get in the breakaway and is swallowed up by the peloton. 66km to go: Needless to say, seconds after the live pictures appeared, it was time for a commercial break. That meant we missed a crash back in the bunch. Marion Bunel (Visma-Lease A Bike) and Elyne Roussel (St Michel - Preference Home - Auber93) both went down, but both are back on their bikes and riding. 70km to go: It’s 31km until the front of the race reaches the day’s intermediate sprint, at Dun-le-Palestel. 71km to go: It’s 4min 36sec for the break, and Lylyk is still trying to get across, but she’s 3min 16sec down. It’s a brave move but surely she is going to struggle trying to get across to these five up front. 75km to go: Kristen Faulkner (EF Education–Oatly) has abandoned following one of the earlier crashes. She also suffered a crash late yesterday. Maria Giulia Confalonieri (Uno-X Mobility) has also packed it in. Sad for those riders and teams. Elisa Balsamo (Lidl-Trek) and (as mentioned earlier) Monica Trinca Colonel (Liv-AlUla-Jayco) have also abandoned. Balsamo is a huge loss to the race. 76km to go: “There has been chaos in the peloton. Two big crashes,” says Iris Slappendel on the TNT Sports motorbike. “We’ve had some DNFs today and that is really sad. The roads have been very narrow … and tailwind … and a big fight to get in the break. “It’s again a really nervous day in the peloton … the girls in the break are out of trouble and able to ride their own race.” 77km to go: Kiara Lylyk (Winspace Orange Seal) is trying to get across to the break. But she is 2min 35 behind. 78km to go: The advantage of the five up front has flown out to 3min 23sec. The closest rider in the break on GC is Barale, and she is 8min 24sec down, so it looks like the GC teams are happy for these five up front to contest the win? 86km to go: Why not send me an email? Merci. 82km to go: “Really looking forward to today,” said Kim Le Court (AG Insurance–Soudal) earlier. “If the legs are there we are going to try and grab yellow. For sure it’s going to be a fight. “The yellow is in our minds, but it’s more important to take some seconds in GC. If we can finish in a small group, then for sure, we’ll go for the win.” 87km to go: Five riders up front now: Alison Jackson (EF Education-Oatly), Brodie Chapman (UAE Team ADQ), Francesca Barale (Team Picnic PostNL), Catalina Anais Soto (Laboral Kutxa-Fundación Euskadi) and Anneke Dijkstra (VolkerWessels Cycling Team). They have 1min 45sec on the peloton. 87km to go: Barale, Jackson, Dijkstra and Soto Campos are now up front together and they have 1min 35sec on the bunch. There are other riders trying to get across. Now, in the UK, we have live coverage but still no live pictures. Is this good enough, on the part of race organisers, ASO? I don’t think so. “For sure, it will be a fast race again, because the wind is quite strong and we have a tailwind,” Ferrand-Prévot of Visma-Lease A Bike said this morning. “It will be important to be in a good position, and to start the last climb in the top positions. “We want to win the stage with Marianne, and keep me in good position in GC … we want to be good, but also to save some energy for the last days … the last three days will be hard enough to make the difference. We have to find the balance.” 93km to go: “I recovered good,” Vollering said before today’s stage. “I already feel better today than yesterday. It was a relief to be able to ride, because my neck was so stiff [after the crash on Monday] … today is a really nice day, super-close to our service course – there will be a lot of people cheering, and I am looking forward to our “home” race. “We focus every day as a team, on what we can do. Yeah, step by step.” 97km to go: According to TNT Sports, Elisa Balsamo (Lidl-Trek) has abandoned following an earlier crash that involved about 15 riders. There are two more withdrawals on the official page, that have appeared in the last hour or so, but Balsamo is not among them. Monica Trinca Colonel (Liv-Alula-Jayco) and Katrine Aalerud (UnoX-Mobility) are the latest withdrawals listed. More to follow. 99km to go: The Côte de Chabannes (1.4km, 5.2%) is the first climb of the day. It’s a category four. Then the Cote du Peyroux (3.3km, 4.3%), another cat-four, then the category-three Le Maupay to finish (2.8km, 5.4%). All those climbs come in the last 40km or so. 102km to go: Dijkstra and Barale are now working together up front and they have 1min 27sec on the chasing bunch. Two chasers are in between the peloton and the leaders: Alison Jackson (EF Education-Oatly) and Catalina Soto (Laboral Kutxa–Fundación Euskadi). They are 20sec behind. 107km to go: Anneke Dijkstra (VolkerWessels) is trying to bridge across to the solo attacker, Barale. 109km to go: Francesa Barale (Picnic PostNL) has attacked and has 40sec on the peloton. Picnic PostNL are certainly trying to animate the race. The average speed has gone up to 46.7km/h. 111km to go: “Today we’re going to try to do something special, why not take back the yellow jersey?” Not my words, the words of Kim Le Court (AG Insurance-Soudal), currently third in GC, before today’s stage. 112km to go: Wiebes, in fact, crashed earlier and that is the reason she was off the back of the bunch. Sounds like there is no serious harm done, however, and she is back and riding in the peloton. 115km to go: I take it back about things being calm in the peloton. This was in fact the fastest first hour of the race so far. 118km to go: Anna Van der Breggen also dropped back to help Wiebes back into the peloton. Meanwhile, Visma-Lease A Bike are controlling on the front of the bunch. 128km to go: I wonder how Vollering is feeling after her crash two days ago. It’s entirely possible that the injuries are more painful today. Yesterday, Jos van Emden, the Visma-Lease a Bike DS, claimed that FDJ-Suez want Vollering in “a gilded cage”, after Vollering and her team complained about a lack of respect in the peloton. “What he’s saying is ridiculous,” Jos van Emden, the team director at Visma-Lease a bike, told Dutch media after an outburst by his counterpart Stephen Delcourt. “Apparently he wants a peloton of eight riders, with Demi in it, to ride in a gilded cage. He’s simply been influenced by Demi, by Demi’s posturing.” 129km to go: Wiebes, in the green jersey, is 13sec behind the peloton with a teammate, Blanka Vas. Probably a mechanical and no harm done, presuming they catch up with the bunch without too much trouble. 132km to go: “The strategy is to go for victory with Marianne without losing time overall for me,” said Ferrand-Prevot earlier, of the Visma-Lease A Bike drill for today’s stage. 134km to go: Linda Zanetti (Uno-X Mobility) is the latest to give it a crack. She is caught. 141km to go: Now Elena Cecchini (SD Worx-ProTime) has clipped off the front, solo, and has 33sec on the peloton. Even so, the average speed of the overall race has dropped further, to 43.7km/h. 144km to go: Elena Hartmann (Ceratzit) and Victoire Berteau (Cofidis) did launch a cheeky little attack, but they’ve now been caught. 145km to go: I don’t currently have the luxury of live pictures, but the average speed – 44.6km/h – would suggest things are relatively calm in the peloton. Relatively being the operative word. 150km to go: Vos’s ability, combined with the time she’s spent at the top of the sport, is nothing short of astonishing. I’m old enough to remember her beating Lizzie Deignan (then Armitstead) to the women’s road race gold medal at London 2012. 152km to go: “We’ll have to see how the day will go,” said the race leader Marianne Vos before today’s stage. “It’s the longest stage and there is more climbing in the final. Every rider, the whole bunch wants to be in the breakaway today. So it’s going to be an especially tough start.” Regarding the points classification battle with Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime) –the green-jersey wearer Wiebes leads Vos by 40pts – she said: “Lorena has a good advantage, and as we said up front, that’s not the main target. With Lorena as competition you know that’s going to be hard.” Quotes via LeTourFemmes.fr 154km to go: Franziska Koch (Picnic–PostNL) has gone on the attack yet again. She was really strong yesterday and spent most of the day in a two-rider break. And she’s obviously feeling good … however, the peloton is all together, after Franziska Brausse (Ceratizit) chased Koch down. The Polish rider Agnieszka Skalniak-Sojka, of Canyon/Sram-zondacrypto, was the solitary withdrawal before today’s race. You can see the full list of abandonments here on the official site. “She’ll be deeply missed but above all, we’re hoping that she recovers quickly,” the team wrote on X. There are 143 riders remaining. We are racing. No, they are racing. The temperature, according to the official site, is a mere 22.5C. That is almost wintry by the standards of the Tour de France. 1) Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime) 197pts 2) Vos (Visma-Lease A Bike) 157pts 3) Koch (Picnic PostNL) 70pts 4) Le Court Pienaar (AG Insurance-Soudal Team) 66pts 5) Vollering (FDJ-Suez) 59pts 6) Jansen (Volkerwessels Cycling Team) 54pts 7) Van der Breggen (SD Worx-Protime) 48pts 8) Niewiadoma-Phinney (Canyon/Sram) 47pts 9) Bossuyt (AG Insurance-Soudal Team) 39pts 10) Lippert (Movistar Team) 35pts Speaking after yesterday’s stage, Pauline Ferrand Prévot (Team Visma-Lease A Bike) said she is looking forward to the road going up … she’s feeling good, clearly, and will be making an assault on the GC in the high mountains. With the top 10 all within 31sec of race leader Marianne Vos it is all looking extremely well poised for the mountain stages. Christian Prudhomme, director of the men’s race, said over the weekend he had hoped for “more of a duel” between Tadej Pogacar and Jonas Vingegaard in the GC. Well, here is the tight overall battle he wanted. Today, you suspect, will not be a GC day, but here is the top 10: 1) Marianne Vos (Team Visma-Lease A Bike) 11hr 13min 11sec 2) Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime) +12sec 3) Kimberley Le Court Pienaar (AG Insurance-Soudal) +12sec 4) Pauline Ferrand Prévot (Team Visma-Lease A Bike) +18sec 5) Katarzyna Niewiadoma-Phinney (Canyon/Sram Zondacrypto) +22sec 6) Demi Vollering (FDJ-Suez) +25sec 7) Anna Van der Breggen (SD Worx-Protime) +27sec 8) Puck Pieterse (Fenix-Deceuninck) +27sec 9) Niamh Fisher-Black (Lidl-Trek) +31sec 10) Chloe Dygert (Canyon/Sram Zondacrypto) +31sec That, of course, is Jeremy Whittle’s stage report from yesterday, which you have ample time to peruse before today’s hostilities. Lorena Wiebes secured her second stage win in the 2025 Tour de France Femmes on the Avenue John Kennedy in Poitiers, after again fending off her Dutch compatriot Marianne Vos in an uphill sprint. Wiebes, who also won the Italian classic Milan-San Remo and the the points classification in the Giro d’Italia, described 2025 as her “best season to date”. She has also won five Giro stages between from 2021-2025. “I have tried to have more of a free mindset, like I had in the Giro,” Wiebes, of Team SD Worx-Protime, said. “This season has already been really good, even if I hadn’t won in the Tour de France. It doesn’t feel like we have a lot of pressure from the team.” The profile of stage five, between Chasseneuil-du-Poitou and Guéret, looks ripe for a breakaway in the final: there are three categorised climbs inside the last 36km, two category fours and one category three, after a relatively flat 130km or so. However, the location of the day’s intermediate sprint, at Dun-le-Palestel after 127km, may lead certain teams to try and control the race until then. Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx–Protime), who leads the green jersey standings after two stage wins in two days, said yesterday she may try to get in breakaways to fight for more points. But perhaps Marianne Vos, the overall leader and yellow-jersey wearer, and her Visma-Lease A Bike team will lend a hand in controlling things. At 165.8km, this transitional stage is the longest of this year’s race. It will be interesting to see how fierce the battle to form an early breakaway becomes, because there are already plenty of tired bodies in the peloton, with a few teams and riders hoping for a relatively easy day with a non-threatening breakaway allowed up the road. This being the Tour de France Femmes, though, it’ll probably be flat-out all the way. Stage start time: 12.35pm UK/1.35pm local
