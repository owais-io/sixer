  Lucy Connolly, who was jailed in the aftermath of last summer’s riots for an
  expletive-ridden social media post calling for followers to set fire to hotels
  housing asylum seekers, has been released from prison. The former childminder,
  who is married to the Conservative councillor Raymond Connolly, left HMP
  Peterborough on Thursday morning in a taxi after serving 10 months of her
  sentence. She was jailed for two years and seven months in October last year
  after she posted on X: “Mass deportation now, set fire to all the fucking
  hotels full of the bastards for all I care, while you’re at it take the
  treacherous government and politicians with them. I feel physically sick
  knowing what these families will now have to endure. If that makes me racist
  so be it.” The post was viewed 310,000 times with 940 reposts, 58 quotes and
  113 bookmarks before it was later deleted. Connolly pleaded guilty to inciting
  racial hatred by publishing and distributing “threatening or abusive” written
  material on X and was jailed at Birmingham crown court. Before she was
  arrested, she told a friend that she would “play the mental health card” if
  she was questioned by police. During the investigation, police found other
  posts that were described by the judge at her sentencing, Melbourne Inman, as
  “racist”, some of which happened before the murder of three girls in Southport
  that triggered the far-right riots. Four days before the stabbing, in response
  to a video of a black man being tackled to the ground for allegedly carrying
  out a sex act in public, she wrote: “Somalian, I guess. Loads of them.” She
  followed this with a vomiting emoji. In the aftermath, responding to an
  anti-fascist protest, on 3 August she wrote: “I take it they will all be in
  line to sign up to house an illegal boat invader then. Oh sorry, refugee.
  “Maybe sign a waiver to say they don’t mind if it’s one of their family that
  gets attacked, butchered, raped etc, by unvetted criminals.” Her sentence has
  come under criticism, particularly in far-right and anti-immigration circles.
  Reacting to her release, the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, said
  Connolly’s sentence was “harsher than the sentences handed down for bricks
  thrown at police or actual rioting”. In May this year after Connolly’s court
  of appeal application was dismissed, Keir Starmer defended it, saying: “I am
  strongly in favour of free speech, we’ve had free speech in this country for a
  very long time and we protect it fiercely. “But I am equally against
  incitement to violence against other people. I will always support the action
  taken by our police and courts to keep our streets and people safe.”
