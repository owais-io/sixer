  And at what cost?

  Despite commissioning another process into how Australia might deal with
  artificial intelligence, the Labor government will soon have to stop studying
  and start making decisions about how (and how much) to regulate the rapidly
  ballooning technology. Like many regulation questions in the tech space – see
  the under-16s social media ban, the long-delayed response to Peta Murphy’s
  gambling advertising report and questions about the news bargaining incentive
  – any move is likely to raise hackles of at least half, probably more, of the
  participants in the discussion. The government finds itself caught at the
  nexus of business groups itching for productivity gains, unions fearful of
  wide swathes being cut through at-risk workforces, big tech companies eager
  for carve-outs and ordinary Australians pinballing between the massive
  benefits and the extraordinary risks of thinking machines, all-knowing search
  engines and uncanny chat bots. A week on from Jim Chalmers’ economic reform
  summit we’re not much closer to knowing where the Albanese government will
  land on questions of whether overarching new legislation is needed. The
  industry minister, Tim Ayres, is overseeing a national AI capability plan,
  expected by year’s end; a “gap analysis”, announced as an outcome of the
  reform roundtable, is more of a review of existing processes already on foot
  around AI in the areas of health, privacy, copyright and online safety. Other
  work focuses on incorporating AI into the public service, boosting investment
  in datacentres, training for AI skills, and working in international forums to
  help shape global rules frameworks. The issue bleeds into nearly every
  portfolio and the government says it wants to take the time to get it right.
  But we know there are wide and varied opinions among Labor MPs and a mood
  among some for decisions to be reached about what the government will do –
  either rely on existing rules or set up a new AI act. Despite diversity inside
  the caucus about exactly what to do, many are keen to see something happen to
  help Australia seize the moment and get ahead of the wave, or at least not be
  caught by it crashing on top of us. Pointing to the government’s efforts to
  tackle the negative effects of social media, with its under-16s ban and plans
  to compensate media outlets, some Labor sources said that was a model case for
  why a fast-moving and generational technology should be appropriately
  regulated from the beginning – rather than trying to play catchup years later.
  But, coming out of the roundtable, comments from various participants made it
  seem almost as if the only thing they could agree on about AI was that it
  presented some positives and some negatives. Chalmers gave vague responses
  about the meeting agreeing on making AI “a national priority and getting that
  right”. Nearly every workplace in the country will have to figure out how to
  respond to AI. It’s not an easy task. From white-collar workers to mechanics,
  and publicans to public servants, industries will be reshaped and the face of
  work changed for ever. Getting it right, to maximise benefits and minimise
  negatives, is crucial. You don’t get a second chance to let the genie out of
  the bottle. It’s a daunting task for any government. But the most immediate
  outcome from the reform roundtable was a plan to “accelerate work” on the
  national plan and to undertake a “gap analysis”, which Chalmers said would
  determine whether the government will pursue a new overarching law or rely on
  existing rules. The previous industry and science minister, Ed Husic, was
  questioned by some for setting up several reviews into AI and not firming up a
  path of action; he had called for a stand-alone AI act. But as every major
  tech company races to set up new AI models, the government remains in review
  mode. Perhaps a new standing committee of parliament, to constantly review the
  protean technology, would be helpful – but settling a broader government
  course of action is more urgent. Ayres is said to be focused on capturing the
  benefits of the AI boom, harnessing the myriad opportunities and not missing
  the boat. His AI capability plan has three core pillars: capturing economic
  opportunities, sharing the benefits of the new technology and safety checks.
  The gap analysis, announced after the roundtable, is a bit more fluid. It’s
  anyone’s guess how long it will take to decide whether a new law is needed.
  But key players want change. Questions remain about how to deal with copyright
  issues for the large learning models, and whether the government will side
  with tech giants seeking a “data mining” exemption or with arts, creative and
  media companies demanding compensation or licensing deals; a potential
  breakthrough between unions and the Tech Council, teased at the summit, is
  still to bear fruit. Unions are still urging protection for workers and
  guarantees of benefits being shared. The government may be stuck between
  seeing wider adoption as a major productivity measure, as well as an economic
  opportunity in datacentres and attracting tech capital, and protecting
  employees and the work they produce. Where Labor lands on AI will be a
  defining issue for the government for years to come. Harnessing productivity
  gains, protecting workers and keeping a lid on a potentially dangerous
  technology is a hard balancing act – but it will probably take years to learn
  whether producing review upon review was the right and prudent path, or akin
  to standing on the beach debating the tidal wave about to crash.
