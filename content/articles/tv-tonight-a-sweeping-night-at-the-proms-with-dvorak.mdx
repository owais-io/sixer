  Dvořák’s New World Symphony at the Proms 8pm, BBC Four The Proms are in full
  swing, kicking the weekend off with a “musical postcard from America”. The
  night starts with the European premiere of Adolphus Hailstork’s An American
  Port of Call, followed by Jennifer Higdon’s Blue Cathedral and Arturo
  Márquez’s Concierto de Otoño. It ends in grand, sweeping style with Antonín
  Dvořák’s Symphony No 9 in E minor, “From the New World”. Domingo Hindoyan
  conducts the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, with trumpeter Pacho
  Flores. Hollie Richardson Here We Go 9pm, BBC One More unapologetic sitcom
  silliness – and unspeakably bad scouse accents – as the Jessops accompany Sue
  (Alison Steadman) to Liverpool. Between a stakeout at an elderly woman’s house
  and a trip to Sue’s childhood home (now a chicken shop), there’s far too much
  going on. But, really, that’s just all part of the fun. Hannah J Davies Under
  the Bridge 9pm, ITV1 “True crime” and “sensitive” aren’t words that often go
  together – and yet this Lily-Gladstone-led series, which also stars Riley
  Keough, pulls it off. As it continues, we learn more about how Reena fell in
  with the wrong crowd in the lead-up to her death, and – via flashbacks – how
  her parents, Manjit and Suman, first met. HJD 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown
  9pm, Channel 4 This chaotic words-and-numbers game continues to offer a
  showcase for an endlessly rotating cast of comics. We’re in series 28 now and,
  as ever, Jimmy Carr is your smirking master of ceremonies. The guests include
  Joe Wilkinson, Alex Brooker, Judi Love and, in his Brian Butterfield alter
  ego, Peter Serafinowicz. Phil Harrison And Just Like That 9pm, Sky Comedy
  We’ve reached the penultimate episode – and this is Carrie’s most nauseating
  relationship yet: the English downstairs neighbour writing a novel about
  Margaret Thatcher. She also won’t stop narrating the show with the awful prose
  from her own period drama book. Anyway, what moments will make this the
  biggest TV-show-we-love-to-hate-watch this week? HR Whitstable Pearl 9pm,
  U&amp;Drama When an infamous food critic comes to town, restaurateur turned
  private detective Pearl (Kerry Godliman) hopes for a top review. It’s a shame,
  then, that her next case is the murder of said critic – who has been poisoned
  while dining at her gaff. But that’s not the only problem she’s having to
  juggle: her boyfriend Tom (Robert Webb) is about to propose. HR Film choice
  Radio Days (Woody Allen, 1987), 11.10pm, Talking Pictures TV Moral panics over
  technology aren’t anything new: radio is the youth-corrupting influence in
  Woody Allen’s chirpy comedy, filling the head of young Joe (Seth Green) with
  revved-up superhero fantasies. But that’s only one aspect of its communal
  power here: a string of vignettes unites Joe’s eccentric Jewish family with
  radio personalities in 30s and 40s Rockaway Beach. Allen narrates as the older
  Joe, while Dianne Wiest as Joe’s lovelorn aunt Bea and Mia Farrow as an
  aspiring announcer deliver standout performances. Phil Hoad Live sport
  Championship football: Birmingham v Ipswich, 7pm, Sky Sports Main Event The
  second tier gets under way from St Andrews.
