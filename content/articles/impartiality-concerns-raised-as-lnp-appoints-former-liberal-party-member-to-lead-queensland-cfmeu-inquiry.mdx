  The lawyer leading a commission of inquiry into Queensland’s CFMEU was a
  former member of the Liberal party and acted for businesses, raising questions
  about his impartiality, according to the state’s union movement. Deputy
  premier and industrial relations minister Jarrod Bleijie announced on Friday
  that Stuart Wood AM KC, an industrial relations lawyer of 30 years experience
  who has worked in Victoria and Queensland, would be the inquiry’s
  commissioner. “He is the most pre-eminent qualified industrial relations
  expert in Australia, and I’m so pleased that he has accepted the government’s
  offer to start the royal commission today so we can get to the bottom of the
  culture of the CFMEU,” Bleijie said. Bleijie said Wood would be required by
  law to conduct his job “independently, impartially and fairly” despite being a
  former member of the Liberal party. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The
  commission of inquiry will investigate allegations of “the use of threats of
  violence, intimidation, misogyny and bullying” within the union, that were
  revealed last month, among other matters. Wood has been the secretary of the
  conservative Samuel Griffith Society for the last decade. In 2023, at a
  ceremonial sitting of the federal court, another lawyer described him as “one
  who never appears for unions”. Queensland Council of Unions general secretary
  Jacqueline King said Wood’s background called into question whether he would
  conduct the inquiry in an impartial manner. “Are those personal biases and
  potential conflicts going to get in the way of having an independent,
  impartial commission of inquiry, independent from government?” King said. “Why
  was he selected? Was he selected because of his connections with the Liberal
  party?” King said the commissioner would have to manage any conflicts of
  interest, including with prior clients – though, she said, that would also be
  the case for a lawyer who had only represented unions. She said there was a
  potential for the inquiry to be a union-bashing and Labor-bashing exercise and
  Wood would need to manage any conflicts of interest. “Clearly on the paper, he
  is very well experienced and should be able to do it … the ball is in his
  court as to how he manages perceptions about those issues,” she said. On
  Friday morning, Bleijie said Wood had been the subject of a “smear campaign”
  from the Labor party. “The attorney general and I made the decision and
  presented that to the governor. It was a governor-in-council appointment.
  There is no one better qualified in Australia to conduct this inquiry into the
  CFMEU,” he said. Wood said he was “delighted to accept this appointment” and
  was “committed to conducting it with the thoroughness and rigour the people of
  Queensland deserve”. “All Queenslanders deserve workplaces that are safe,
  respectful and operate within the framework of the law,” he said. CFMEU
  administrator Mark Irving KC said on Thursday night that the inquiry would
  receive the full cooperation of the union. Several lawyers contacted by the
  Guardian said it wasn’t unusual for industrial relations lawyers to act for
  only one type of party, whether unions or employers. The commission of inquiry
  has broad terms of reference, including investigating the involvement of
  organised crime in the CFMEU and in the broader construction industry. It is
  scheduled to run for 12 months, but Bleijie said on Friday that its deadline
  could be extended if needed. Former police deputy commissioner Bob Gee will
  serve as the inquiry secretary. He will take leave from his role as director
  general of the Department of Youth Justice and Victim Support to do so. Wood
  was appointed King’s Counsel in 2014, is a member of the Victorian and
  Queensland Bars and has chambers in Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne. He was
  appointed to the Order of Australia in 2019 “for significant service to the
  legal profession, particularly in the area of industrial relations”.
