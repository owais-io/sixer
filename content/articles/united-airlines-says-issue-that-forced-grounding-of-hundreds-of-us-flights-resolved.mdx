  United Airlines has said a technology issue that led to the grounding of
  flights for a few hours and major delays across its network in the US has been
  resolved. “While we expect residual delays, our team is working to restore our
  normal operations,” the airline said in a statement late on Wednesday. The
  issue prompted ground stops at several major United hub airports including
  Newark, Denver, Houston and Chicago, according to the US Federal Aviation
  Administration’s (FAA) website. United said the problem related to its
  Unimatic system that housed information about each flight that was then fed to
  other systems, including those that calculated weight and balance and tracked
  flight times. The US transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, said on X that the
  issue was specific to United’s operations and was unrelated to the broader air
  traffic control system. United said it was treating the technology issue as a
  controllable delay, meaning it would pay customer expenses such as hotels
  where applicable. As of Wednesday evening, tracking site FlightAware showed
  that 1,038, or 34%, of United flights had been delayed on Wednesday. The day’s
  issues come just a few weeks after Alaska Airlines grounded all of its flights
  for about three hours due to an IT outage for the second time in just over a
  year. In April 2024, Alaska grounded its entire fleet due to an issue with the
  system that calculates the weight and balance of its planes.
