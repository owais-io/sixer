  I went to the British Museum with my youngest adult daughter and her partner
  recently – and we were all shocked. I’d been to the institution many times
  when I lived in London until two decades ago, and let’s just say there had
  never been any shortage of imperial plunder to shock and anger me. But the
  notable thing about our shared reactions when visiting on a recent late spring
  day was that the collection that so disconcerted us had not greatly bothered
  me on my last visit in 2003. Times change. So, too, do people. Human
  sensitivities evolve with age and self-education and understanding. Unlike
  some institutions, however, which seem to remain largely intransigent. What
  shook us all on the recent visit were the collections relating to (in the BM’s
  own words) “Egyptian death and the afterlife: mummies’’. Yep, the mummies.
  Dead people shrouded in cloth, some in open sarcophagi. The skulls, mandible,
  ribs and other body parts belonging to ancient people of the Nile valley were
  also on display. The mummy rooms, as they are known, were certainly popular.
  Perhaps the busiest rooms we visited, to judge from the hordes of mums, dads,
  kids and schoolchildren scrambling to get up close and personal to the glass
  cabinets for a better look – and photograph each other with – were those that
  contained the dead. “Mum – get a picture of my head right next to his.’’ The
  British Museum is among many institutions globally that still display human
  remains, although advances in museological ethics and approaches to how
  collections of the dead are curated (not to mention repatriation policies)
  mean the number is dwindling. It is clearly cognisant of the now rapid
  evolution in attitudes on institutional holdings and display of the dead as
  evidenced by its website which stresses “the Museum ensures that the human
  remains held in its care are always treated and displayed with respect and
  dignity’’. The mummy rooms, with all those people struggling for selfies with
  dead people, did not entirely exude respect and dignity. Call me
  old-fashioned. No wait – call me progressive. Actually, no – just call me a
  regular human with more than a passing unease at the dead ending up anonymised
  into collection items and how they might have felt about this when they were
  alive. I’ve written extensively about collections of human remains in
  Australian and overseas institutions, not least at the South Australian Museum
  where body parts belonging to some 4,600 individuals (most of them Aboriginal
  people) have at times been stored – though not recently displayed. As a kid my
  dad would take me to the Melbourne Museum. I remember the mummies on display
  there. I was ghoulishly fascinated – though not shocked. Today I find displays
  of dead people shocking – and not at all fascinating – even if museums still
  advance the purported scientific benefits of holding such specimens. As
  specious as that argument is (advanced, for example, in the explanatory note
  about the decay of the teeth on skulls from the Nile valley, on display in the
  BM mummy rooms) it remains to be seen how it is served by the public display
  of such body parts. Like the SA Museum, which no longer displays remains and
  has gone to lengths to repatriate and re-bury the dead from its collections
  where provenance can be determined, a growing number of institutions globally
  are choosing to no longer display human remains at all. In the UK, an
  all-party parliamentary group has proposed that the public display of human
  remains, including the mummies in the BM, be stopped. The chair of the
  parliamentary group Bell Ribeiro-Addy made the argument succinctly: “I would
  like people to imagine taking the remains of our monarchs to another country
  and putting them on display. Even if they kept them in their coffins, would we
  think that was acceptable?’’ Good question. Many remains (perhaps thousands)
  belonging to Australian Indigenous people are still in overseas collecting
  institutions. Anthropologists from across the globe sought them in the 19th
  century to advance their perverse racially scientific theories (not least the
  pseudo-science of phrenology, which fallaciously proposed that racial
  characteristics, intelligence and personality might be determined by skull
  shape). Some were the victims of colonial massacres. Others were stolen from
  morgues and hospitals. Even one of the world’s most confronting public
  collections of human remains, the Mütter Museum at the College of Physicians
  of Philadelphia, is facing a long-overdue reckoning about the future of its
  gruesome collection (including at one time the skull of an Australian soldier
  to which I brought global attention in 2017). Times have changed, even if some
  globally revered organisations haven’t. It’s beyond time for public collecting
  institutions, which claim to operate ethically and respectfully, to remove all
  human remains, including Egyptian mummies, from public display and, where
  possible, to repatriate them. It is never OK to have them on public view as
  objects of entertainment. • Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnist
