  Grand Prix of Europe review – rodents hit the road in easy-going family

  Here is a very ordinary family animation that gets an almighty engine rev from
  its all-star British vocal cast. Gemma Arterton is the voice of Edda, a perky
  little mouse who lives with her dad (a lovely performance by Lenny Henry), who
  is trying to keep the family’s struggling theme park afloat. But budding
  racing driver Edda dreams of becoming a champion like her hero, four-time
  Grand Prix-winning mouse Ed (voiced by Thomas Brodie-Sangster). The film has
  been produced to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Europa-Park, Germany’s
  biggest theme park. But you have to wonder whether the park’s owners have been
  left feeling short-changed. The theme park in the movie quickly takes a back
  seat to racing after Edda runs away to Paris to watch Ed compete; he is
  disliked by the other drivers on the circuit but adored by fans.
  Brodie-Sangster’s vocal work as Ed is terrific, nailing a type of arrogance
  particular to the sporting world – equal parts diva and crashingly dull bore.
  The film wins no prizes for originality either. Little Edda takes Ed’s car out
  for a joyride and crashes, injuring Ed, who reluctantly agrees to let her
  secretly take his place on the race tour. It’s a perfectly serviceable
  plotline, and unlike so many animated films for under-eights, with their
  needlessly complicated stories, it even makes sense. There is a mystery to
  solve too – one of the drivers is sabotaging the other cars. Could it be the
  sinister crow who wears black leather? Or is there something a bit suspect
  about the cute cuddly Swiss bear who always comes second and pronounces
  muffins as “mooofins”? This is hardly in the fast lane of family movies, but
  it’s cheerful, unassuming fun. • Grand Prix of Europe is in UK and Irish
  cinemas from 22 August
