  impact on science

  Hundreds more jobs could be axed at Australia’s national science agency,
  sparking concerns the country is gutting its research capability just as the
  Trump administration makes deep cuts into the sector in the US. The latest
  potential research job losses at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial
  Research Organisation (CSIRO) follow 440 positions being cut last financial
  year and earlier deep reductions under the Coalition government, including 300
  in 2016. They coincide with the Trump administration slashing science agencies
  in the US, with warnings the loss of expertise could have global ramifications
  in health, climate science and weather forecasting. The Community and Public
  Sector Union said the Australian cuts were at odds with the Albanese
  government’s promise to prioritise economic productivity and urged the
  government to instead increase investment in the CSIRO. Susan Tonks, the
  union’s CSIRO spokesperson, said: “There’s a clear disconnect between the
  government’s talk about boosting productivity and their failure to support the
  very institution that helps deliver it.” Sign up: AU Breaking News email A
  CSIRO spokesperson confirmed the agency was “reshaping its research portfolio”
  with a goal of making it more financially sustainable, but did not indicate
  how many jobs might be lost. They said the changes were in part due to the end
  of Covid-19 “safety net” funding and other government savings measures, and
  would “ensure we are focused on delivering the science Australia needs now and
  into the future”. David Karoly, a University of Melbourne emeritus professor
  who previously worked at CSIRO, said the cuts were not being offset elsewhere.
  He said Australia had lower levels of industry funding in research than
  comparable countries. “There’s a dilemma as to whether Australia wants to
  support the research infrastructure that’s needed to support ongoing research
  activities in science,” he said. “The simple answer is Australia doesn’t
  appear to want to do that.” The latest cuts were understood to primarily
  affect the CSIRO’s agriculture and food research unit, with reductions in
  health and safety, IT and business development. Research unit staff were
  expected to be informed about funding and staffing changes by October. The May
  federal budget papers showed an expected 450-person reduction in CSIRO staff,
  from 5,945 in 2024-25 to 5,495 this financial year. The union said the cuts
  were the worst since 2014, when the Abbott government oversaw an estimated 20%
  reduction in staff. Tonks said the agency’s staff were experiencing “deep
  anxiety” over the CSIRO’s strategic direction and the cuts were “directly
  undermining Australia’s ability to innovate, compete and grow”. “This will
  continue to be the case as long as this government sits on its hands while
  hundreds of staff at the CSIRO are shown the door with little to no
  explanation,” she said. “If this government is serious about productivity, it
  must step in, stop the cuts, and back our country’s peak science institution.”
  The CSIRO also confirmed it would exit its tenancy in the Indian Ocean Marine
  Research Centre’s Watermans Bay site, in Perth’s northern suburbs, by the end
  of 2025. The agency said it was a “small partner”, representing about 15% of
  the site footprint. A spokesperson said the agency remained “committed to the
  Indian Ocean Marine Research Centre partnership”. • This article was amended
  on 7 August 2025 to reflect that CSIRO does not own a stake in the IOMRC, but
  is an ongoing member and rented facilities at Waterman’s Bay.
