  Esther Ghey, the mother of the murdered teenager Brianna Ghey, and the
  Oscar-winning actor Kate Winslet are calling on Keir Starmer to legally ban
  smartphones in schools, warning current guidance against allowing phones has
  created a “postcode lottery”. As children in England and Wales return to
  classes this week, Ghey said research showed that only 11% of secondary
  schools were currently implementing a full ban on bringing in smartphones or
  requiring them to be left in a secure and inaccessible place all day. She said
  a ban would have “solved so many issues” for her daughter, who was “sucked
  away from society and into the online world where she was at risk of so many
  harms”. Brianna, 16, a transgender girl from Warrington, was described as
  addicted to her phone. She was killed by two teenagers in February 2023, one
  of whom she believed to be her friend. The government has resisted banning
  smartphones in schools, insisting headteachers are able to take their own
  actions. It issued guidance in 2024 that “schools should develop a mobile
  phone policy that prohibits the use of mobile phones … throughout the school
  day, including during lessons, the time between lessons, break times and
  lunchtime”. But subsequent research among 2,467 secondary schools in April by
  the children’s commissioner, Rachel de Souza, found that while 90% had some
  restrictions on phone use, only 3.5% banned phones from school grounds and
  only 7.9% required pupils to hand in their phones for the whole day. This
  summer, Peter Kyle, the technology secretary, said schools needed freedom to
  implement guidance in the way that worked for them, but added: “If schools
  need more help to [take action] then we will look very carefully at that
  because we want to make sure that classrooms are free of smartphones.” The new
  Phone Free Education campaign is calling for ministers to introduce a full
  legal ban including funding for schools to pay for a lockable pouch or similar
  alternative. Other backers include the actor Stephen Graham, who appeared in
  the Netflix drama Adolescence, which dealt with online radicalisation of
  children, the boxer-turned-mental health campaigner Frank Bruno, the singer
  Will Young, the website Mumsnet and Jonathan Haidt, the author of The Anxious
  Generation, who says smartphones have caused an epidemic of child mental
  illness. In an open letter to Starmer and the education secretary, Bridget
  Phillipson, they said: “Most schools are relying on children to resist a
  temptation even adults struggle with. It’s not fair, and it’s not working.”
  Calling for a statutory ban, they said: “We know it can work – schools that
  can afford this approach are reporting improvements in both staff and student
  wellbeing.” Winslet, who won a Bafta for her role in the Channel 4 drama I Am
  Ruth, where she plays a mother struggling with a daughter consumed by social
  media, said: “Every child deserves to be in classrooms that are free from the
  distraction and highly addictive nature of smartphones. A statutory ban would
  be a vital step towards protecting the mental health of young people and
  preserving every child’s right to realising their fullest potential during
  these precious and integral years.” Ghey said she wanted children to be free
  to interact face-to-face throughout the school day, “building relationships
  with peers” instead of being subject to content arriving in the classroom and
  playground through phones, which she said could include child sexual abuse
  images, pornography and illegal drug markets. Last year, Brianna’s secondary
  school in Warrington, Birchwood community high school, introduced a pouch
  system, requiring pupils to lock away their phones. Ghey said the teachers had
  noticed how noisy the dinner hall became as children socialised face-to-face,
  “laughing, joking, probably some of them were arguing, but this is all part of
  growing up and figuring out how to live in society”. Brianna’s phone use at
  school led to her being excluded. “There were 120 safeguarding issues around
  Brianna’s phone use, which ranged from child sexual exploitation to the issues
  around her eating disorder and self harming,” Ghey said. “There were also 116
  behaviour incidents logged, which [included] Brianna going to the toilet to
  film Tiktok videos, refusing to put a phone away in class and refusing to go
  into class because she just wanted to go and sit in the exclusion unit on a
  phone. “None of us knew what to do. I just think that if we’d had this [ban],
  then it would have just solved so many issues … she was just kind of sucked
  away from society and into the online world where she was at risk of so many
  harms. She should have been in school, she should have had her phone away, she
  should have been socialising with peers and focusing on education.” A
  government spokesperson said: “Schools already have the power to ban phones.
  Research from the children’s commissioner shows that 99.8% of primary schools
  and 90% of secondary schools already have policies restricting the use of
  mobile phones. “We support headteachers to take the necessary steps to prevent
  disruption, backed by clear guidance and have also brought in better
  protections for children from harmful content through the Online Safety Act.”
