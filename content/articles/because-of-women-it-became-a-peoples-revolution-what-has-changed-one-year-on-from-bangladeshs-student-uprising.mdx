  On 5 August 2024, Sheikh Hasina resigned as prime minister of Bangladesh and
  fled the country, the culmination of a student uprising that saw the most
  widespread participation of women in street protests in Bangladesh’s history.
  Armed with sticks and stones, Bangladeshi women headed marches and stood
  defiant against riot police and the military. Their presence became a defining
  image of a revolution that has rewritten Bangladesh’s political and social
  narrative. The uprising led to the establishment of an interim government
  under the Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, which has focused on
  stabilising the country. But in the wake of the political shift, many women
  still feel they are not being heard. In May, thousands joined the Women’s
  March for Solidarity demanding the government take action to ensure women’s
  rights and safety. Here, five Bangladeshi women share their experiences of
  what life has been like for them over the past year, and suggest the changes
  they think need to be made. Umama Fatema, student activist When Umama Fatema
  persuaded a group of fellow female students at Dhaka University to leave their
  dormitories to join one of the protests last year, she had no idea how far
  things would go. “Everything happened so quickly and soon the uprising spread
  to every corner of the country,” says Fatema, a student activist and key
  coordinator of the July protests. “It is because of women that the movement
  became a people’s revolution. Without women, none of it would have been
  possible.” But one year on, Bangladesh’s student movement has fractured and
  optimism is waning. “The movement raised important questions regarding
  governance, accountability and women’s rights, which remain unresolved,”
  Fatema says. “Instead of addressing them, people have focused on forging their
  own political paths.” Fatema says that after a while, the atmosphere became so
  toxic that women’s participation in the movement quickly began to drop. Until
  recently, she was the spokesperson for Students Against Discrimination, the
  organisation that spearheaded the student revolution. “If women are included
  merely as tokens, they hold no real power,” says Fatema. “As a result, issues
  like rape and sexual harassment are not given proper attention by the state
  because within the existing power structure of Bangladesh, women are still
  considered secondary.” Fatema argues that the interim government’s lack of
  decisive action has led to growing public frustration. “People expected swift
  justice, but the process has moved too slowly,” she says. “All this talk about
  reform and justice for the dead now feels like empty promises.” Shompa Akhter,
  garment worker Shompa Akhter has worked in Bangladesh’s garment industry for
  nearly two decades. In her village in Kushtia, western Bangladesh, there are
  few opportunities for women, so like many, she moved to the capital in search
  of work. Employed at a factory on the outskirts of Dhaka, Akhter works long
  hours and earns roughly 15,000 taka (£90) a month – not nearly enough for her
  family to get by. “The cost of everything has gone up – rice, lentils,
  vegetables, oil and gas – but our wages haven’t kept pace,” says Akhter. “My
  children’s school fees are a constant worry. We skip nutritious meals just to
  cover that. And God help us if any of them falls ill! I often have to borrow
  money from family or loan sharks just to make ends meet.” Akhter recently took
  part in protests demanding higher wages and better working conditions for
  Bangladesh’s 4.4 million garment workers, the majority of whom are women. The
  garment sector, considered the lifeblood of the country’s economy, contributes
  $47bn (£35bn) annually, amounting to 82% of total export earnings. “We garment
  workers keep the factories running and yet we are treated as disposable,” says
  Akhter. “But our voices matter and we demand wages that reflect our labour and
  allow us to live with dignity.” “Being a woman in Bangladesh still means
  fighting for your place – whether it’s in your home, workplace or community,”
  Akhter adds. “My dream is for my daughters to grow up in a country where they
  don’t have to fight just to be heard. “The government must bring us to the
  negotiating table,” she says. “Women need to be involved at every level of
  decision-making if we want real, lasting change in Bangladesh.” Triaana Hafiz,
  transgender model When the transgender model Triaana Hafiz moved to Dhaka in
  2023, she thought things might be different. Growing up in Khulna, south-west
  Bangladesh, she faced constant discrimination and harassment. “I knew I was
  different and so did everyone else. I tried to keep my head down but society
  would not allow me to exist, even quietly,” says Hafiz. “It got so bad, I
  thought about committing suicide on multiple occasions.” Her big break came
  when she landed a modelling job in the capital. “It wasn’t easy but in Dhaka I
  felt I could finally start living my life as I truly am. I found a beautiful
  community of open-minded people who didn’t question or belittle my identity as
  a transgender woman.” When the student protests broke out in 2024, Hafiz felt
  hopeful. “The main motto of the revolution was that there would be no more
  discrimination,” she says. “I am not so naive as to think this automatically
  applied to me. But I had hoped that this younger generation of leaders would
  be more tolerant and inclusive. “If anything, in the past year, discrimination
  has gotten worse, with politicians openly spreading transphobic hate,” she
  says. Hafiz wants the interim government to incorporate the rights of people
  with diverse gender identities into new and reformed laws. “Everyone in the
  new Bangladesh has the right to live with dignity and security,” she says. “We
  need to be a country where diversity is celebrated, not just tolerated; one
  where everyone belongs, regardless of gender, sex, religion, ethnicity or
  class.” Rani Yan Yan, Indigenous rights defender The Indigenous rights
  defender Rani Yan Yan hails from the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) in
  south-east Bangladesh, which has for decades been a site of ethnic conflict,
  violence from the military and Bengali settlers, displacement and tension. The
  region has long had a significant military presence, which has been linked to
  human rights violations and the suppression of Indigenous rights, including
  killings, enforced disappearances, land confiscation and sexual violence
  against Indigenous women and girls. In 2018, Yan Yan was violently beaten by
  members of the security forces while helping two girls from her community who
  had been sexually assaulted. In May this year, an Indigenous woman, Chingma
  Khyang, was brutally gang-raped and murdered. “This attack was typical of
  hundreds that have occurred over the years, where perpetrators have been
  granted impunity,” says Yan Yan. “The interim government must immediately put
  an end to the culture of impunity that has long persisted in the Hill Tracts.”
  In June, human rights group Ain o Salish Kendra warned of a serious failure of
  the state to protect women and a breakdown in security. The organisation has
  urged the government to send a clear and firm message that such barbarity has
  no place in Bangladesh. “There is still so much work to be done, but as a
  priority, we must ensure that the rule of law prevails in Bangladesh, with an
  open and democratic government that is accountable to all its citizens,” says
  Yan Yan. Samanta Shermeen, political newcomer Samanta Shermeen was recently
  elected senior joint convener of the National Citizen party. “During the
  [July] uprising, we saw Bangladeshi women play an extremely active and
  powerful role. But since then, they have been systematically sidelined,” says
  Shermeen. “If we can’t give women the proper respect and recognition they
  deserve, the revolution would have been for nothing.” Earlier this year, she
  condemned attacks by radicals who vandalised a pitch ahead of a women’s
  football match. “It was a blatant act of misogyny and a violation of the
  principles that underpin Bangladesh’s core values,” Shermeen says. “Despite
  this, our women’s national football team has just qualified for the final
  round of the Women’s Asian Cup for the first time,” she says proudly.
  “Bangladeshi women are unstoppable. The more you try to hold us back, the more
  determined we are to succeed,” Shermeen says. “The revolution proved that –
  and it was only just the beginning.”
