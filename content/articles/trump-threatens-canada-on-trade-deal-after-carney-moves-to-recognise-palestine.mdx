  Donald Trump has threatened Canada after it moved to recognise a Palestinian
  state, reacting to Mark Carney’s announcement by saying that signing a US
  trade deal would now be “very hard”. The Canadian prime minister said on
  Wednesday that if the Palestinian Authority promised to meet certain
  conditions, including demilitarising and holding elections without Hamas,
  Canada would join France, the UK and other allies in formally recognising a
  state of Palestine at the UN general assembly in New York in September.
  Portugal said on Thursday it was also considering recognition, and Germany
  said such a move should come at the end of talks on a two-state solution.
  Trump, who had appeared to give tacit approval to the UK prime minster, Keir
  Starmer, for Britain’s own declaration earlier in the week, has since reacted
  to the growing movement toward recognising Palestine by doubling down on his
  support of Israel’s position, saying that doing so “rewards Hamas”. “The level
  of human suffering in Gaza is intolerable,” Carney said in his announcement.
  He said the leader of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, had assured
  him it could meet the goals he had laid out, but acknowledged that “much has
  to happen before a democratic viable state is established”. “The deepening
  suffering of civilians leaves no room for delaying coordinated international
  action to support peace, security and the dignity of human life,” Carney said
  on Wednesday. Israel has been accused of refusing to allow international
  organisations to bring aid into Gaza, where dozens of people have starved to
  death in recent days, with images of emaciated children horrifying the world.
  Trump, however, reacted to Carney’s decision by posting on social media: “Wow!
  Canada has just announced that it is backing statehood for Palestine. That
  will make it very hard for us to make a Trade Deal with them.” Trump is to
  impose a 35% tariff on all Canadian goods not covered by the US-Mexico-Canada
  trade agreement if the two countries do not reach an agreement by the deadline
  on Friday. Carney had already noted that it was unlikely for any Canada-US
  trade deal to avoid tariffs entirely, despite Canada being the largest buyer
  of US exports. Trump has echoed Israel’s position that recognising Palestine
  “is rewarding terrorists”, as Iddo Moed, Israel’s ambassador to Canada, told
  Canada’s public broadcaster CBC. With many of his supporters increasingly
  opposing Israel’s war in Gaza, Trump previously criticised the UK’s plan to
  grant recognition as “rewarding Hamas”, telling journalists on Air Force One
  that the US was “not in that camp”. Trump also said: “You’re rewarding Hamas
  if you do that. I don’t think they should be rewarded.” Trump’s latest
  broadside at Canada comes amid other attempts to use tariffs as leverage over
  the domestic and foreign policies of other nations. He has promised to raise
  tariffs on Brazil to 50%, linking it to the prosecution of his ally, former
  president Jair Bolsonaro, and recently threatened 15% additional tariffs on
  India for buying Russian oil, having fallen out with Putin over the war in
  Ukraine. Thursday’s announcement of a US trade deal with Thailand and Cambodia
  also followed Trump’s demand that the two sides end the military skirmishes
  that broke out last week.
