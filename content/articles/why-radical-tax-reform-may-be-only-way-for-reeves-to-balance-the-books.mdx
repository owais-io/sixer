  Despite a good month for the public finances, the Treasury won’t be putting in
  any champagne orders. Higher self-assessment tax receipts and an increase in
  national insurance payments by employers filled the government’s coffers by
  more than expected in July. The result was that Rachel Reeves’s spending
  deficit fell to £1.1bn, down by £2.3bn from the same month a year earlier.
  That would be cheery news in normal circumstances, but hemmed in by tight
  fiscal rules, jittery financial markets and a restless public, the chancellor
  knows not to be complacent. There is every likelihood that the Office for
  Budget Responsibility (OBR) will downgrade its outlook for economic growth
  when Reeves presents her autumn budget, forcing the government to take further
  action to balance the books. By how much we don’t know. There are wildly
  different estimates from the UK’s main thinktanks and economic consultancies.
  At the moment, government spending is on track to come in at £105.5bn in this
  financial year, a shade below the OBR forecast of £105.7bn. Capital Economics
  says a review of the outlook by the OBR will lead to downwards revisions
  totalling £17bn, creating a £27bn gap once Reeves has restored her target of a
  £10bn buffer. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research used its
  own modelling to arrive at a gap of £41bn, and £51bn if the buffer is
  maintained. These are big numbers, even when they are spread over the OBR’s
  five-year timeline. It would be nice to think that Britain’s reputation for
  responsible government and sound public finances meant it could borrow freely
  to fill the debit side of the ledger. Most City economists say this facility
  is heavily circumscribed. No longer do international lenders believe
  governments when they say they need to borrow for the short-term. Only Germany
  has managed that in the last 20 years, and it has paid a similar price to the
  UK in lost investment and deteriorating public services. Italy is enjoying
  favourable treatment by the debt markets at the moment because it is seen to
  have a solid grip on its deficit, unlike France, which is being punished with
  high borrowing rates for seemingly losing its way. Without much leeway to
  increase borrowing or political capital to revise spending plans – inside or
  outside the Labour party – Reeves must examine ways to raise tax. She knows
  that a repeat of last year’s tax grab will be a growth killer. Instead, she is
  examining ways to reform the tax system that releases much-needed funds and
  spurs activity, especially in the depressed property market. It is a bold
  chancellor who embarks on radical tax reform. At the moment, it seems to be
  her only escape route.
