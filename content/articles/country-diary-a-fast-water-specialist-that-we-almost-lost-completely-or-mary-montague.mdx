  As I lean over the bridge’s parapet, a sudden slap draws my gaze upstream to a
  dark pool. All that’s left of the trout’s leap are a few bubbles encircled by
  slowly widening ripples. I look back to where the Six Mile Water river races
  across stony shallows. Waving languidly in the spate are long, emerald-green
  scarves of river water crowfoot, Ranunculus fluitans. Water crowfoots are a
  branch of the buttercup family. However, compared with its landlubber cousins,
  R. fluitans is another kind of being entirely – one that long ago made a
  completely different bargain with a changing world. Most of our several
  species of water crowfoot have two types of leaf: hair-like ones that are
  submerged in water; and broad flat ones that float on the surface. The
  floating leaves betray the group’s terrestrial origins, and species like pond
  water crowfoot, R. peltatus use them as a raft for their flowers. However, the
  fast-water specialist R. fluitans has dispensed with floating leaves. Instead,
  like daisies woven through a girl’s long hair, its blooms emerge from the
  sinuous underwater leaves directly on to a river’s surface. Under such
  conditions, it’s perhaps not surprising that the flowers produce few seeds.
  Indeed, R. fluitans had to find another way to survive and spread, as it
  evolved into new riverine habitats at the end of the last ice age. In the
  turbulent waters of melting glaciers, it found vegetative reproduction – a
  form of self-propagation whereby stems and leaves can detach to form new
  plants – to be a more favourable strategy. The Six Mile Water is the only
  river in Ireland where R. fluitans is found. The species’ range may have
  contracted in the 18th and 19th centuries when rivers were harnessed to power
  the mills. While the species enjoys legal protection, unfortunately the Six
  Mile Water does not; industrial waste discharge almost wiped out this isolated
  population of river water crowfoot in 2008. But for the commitment of the
  local angler Michael Martin, who manually assisted the survivors to
  re-propagate, it might have vanished altogether. The population is also
  threatened by seemingly intractable local agricultural pollution. For how much
  longer will I be able to admire these bewitching water‑combed tresses and
  wonder at life’s capacity to respond to a changing world? • Under the Changing
