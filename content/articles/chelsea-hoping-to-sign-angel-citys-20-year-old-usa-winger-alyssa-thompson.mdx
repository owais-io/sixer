  Chelsea have made a move for the Angel City winger Alyssa Thompson, with the
  Women’s Super League club hoping to reach a deal before the transfer window
  closes next Thursday. The WSL champions are understood to have been aiming to
  add a world-class winger to their ranks and the USA international is widely
  regarded as one of the best young talents in the game. The 20-year-old has
  eight goal involvements in her 16 NWSL appearances so far this season. Any
  move for Thompson, who was the first overall pick in the 2023 NWSL draft when
  she was 18, would command one of the largest transfer deals in women’s
  football. No fee has yet been agreed, according to sources, but Chelsea are
  understood to be ready to sign the California-born youngster, who has already
  been capped 22 times, having made her USA debut in October 2022 against
  England at Wembley aged 17. Chelsea’s campaign begins on 5 September, on the
  opening night of the new WSL season against Manchester City. Chelsea, who won
  a domestic treble of major trophies during Sonia Bompastor’s first campaign in
  charge, have had a quiet transfer window so far, signing the Australia
  defender Ellie Carpenter for an undisclosed fee from Lyon. They have also
  completed moves for the goalkeepers Livia Peng and Becky Spencer, as well as
  the forward Mara Alber.
