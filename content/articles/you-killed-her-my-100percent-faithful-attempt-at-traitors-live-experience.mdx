  Things are not going well. Halfway through my attempt to play the real-life
  version of the smash-hit reality BBC reality TV show The Traitors, I realise
  something: I may be less charming than I’d hoped. “I don’t trust him,” intones
  a player to my left, scowling at my face as though she has just found it on
  the bottom of her shoe. “Yeah, he seems shifty!” exclaims her friend. I try to
  defuse the tension by smiling winningly. “Look at that smirk. He’s definitely
  a Traitor.” Oh dear. In retrospect, this should not have come as a surprise.
  Since The Traitors first burst on to our screens in November 2022, it’s become
  obvious that it’s not easy to convince people you’re telling the truth while
  being subjected to death-ray stares. Watching contestants go head to head as
  either traitors (who lie, scheme and murder fellow contestants by night) or
  faithfuls (who try to banish traitors so they can share a cash prize with
  fellow honest players) has united the UK around its TV sets. The show has won
  Baftas and Emmys, and drawn up to 10 million viewers an episode, and it’s
  largely down to the sheer unpredictability of what people will do when they’re
  put in a pressure cooker environment and suspicion is allowed to fester. It’s
  also what made Neil Connolly, the creative director behind The Traitors: Live
  Experience, decide to replicate the interior of a Scottish castle in Covent
  Garden in London and have players roleplay the TV show in groups of up to 12.
  “I wanted to make people’s hearts race,” he will tell me on the phone the
  following day. “That moment when you feel your heart pounding in your chest, I
  know that I’ve done my job correctly.” Well, as I play the game, his wishes
  are coming true. Largely because I am a faithful, who is doing a terrible job
  of convincing anyone. Along with a group of other journalists, I’m sitting in
  a wood-panelled room containing an impressive replica of the round table
  around which all the TV show’s fiercest debates take place. Occasionally, our
  host – a tartan-clad Claudia Winkleman-channelling actor – announces that it
  is now “night” and instructs us to put on a “blindfold” (more commonly known
  as “blacked-out ski goggles”). We wait while the Traitors remove theirs and
  plot who to kill – or secretly recruit. And then, masks removed, fierce debate
  breaks out. “The way you reacted there was a bit ‘Hugh Grant in a romcom’,”
  declares one player, casting suspicion towards a particularly emotive
  participant. “Bit strange.” It’s not long before all the tropes of the TV show
  pop up. People begin to form cliques. The phrase “100% faithful” is repeated
  time and again. Rather than evicting people based on any form of evidence,
  players are banished purely due to looking a bit odd. Hugh Grant ends up being
  evicted – and turns out to be a faithful. Randomness rules. “We had one woman
  who voted for someone, then said: ‘It’s because you remind me of Miles Jupp
  from Balamory,’” laughs Connolly. “One guy turned around his slate and said:
  ‘I’ve voted for you, Tom, because I don’t know how to spell the other person’s
  name.’” I, however, am determined to learn from everything I’ve seen on the TV
  show. I refuse to go with the herd. I vote on the basis of evidence, rather
  than conjecture about facial tics. And I never throw around baseless
  accusations, lest I kill one of my own. In short: I repeatedly vote for the
  person next to me, as I’m convinced I heard him removing his goggles during
  the night-time. As the debates go on, I somehow attract more suspicion. The
  number of votes against me increases. Luckily, my methodology proves popular
  and we successfully evict two traitors who were overly noisy when removing
  their blindfold. Less luckily, a faithful player announces that she’d like to
  banish me and then is murdered by the traitors. “You killed her!” declares her
  friend, to the gasps of the room. These traitors know what they’re doing.
  Fortunately, tension defuses as we break to play a game. We solve clues to
  find numbers hidden around the room, which we then put in the correct order by
  communicating with “the dead” – the players who have either been banished or
  murdered, and are now watching us on TV from a nearby room. Unlike the TV
  show, in which these tasks earn contestants money for the prize pot, we get
  points for our total on the daily leaderboard. As we go back into another
  debate, it turns out that my dogged voting for the same player is paying off.
  Enough other people have become suspicious, and he is evicted. “What a
  relief,” he announces before he leaves the room. “I was a traitor.” Suddenly,
  people are looking at me differently. For the rest of the session, not a
  single player votes for me, until our host announces: “It is now time for the
  end game!” Dramatic music swells and we’re told to press a button. We can vote
  either to end the game if we believe everyone to be faithful or to continue
  banishing if we don’t. Over three stressful rounds, we’re whittled down from
  six players to three. The game ends, and we have to declare. Are we all
  faithful? In which case we all win. Or is there a traitor among us? In which
  case only they are victorious. I declare first. Then player number two proves
  to be on the side of good as well. And, finally, the last player announces:
  “I’m a faithful.” We won – and I’m in shock. Surely it doesn’t normally go
  this smoothly? “Oh no,” laughs Connolly. “At the end of one game, a player had
  to tell his fiancee he was a traitor. Before he even finished speaking, she
  had ripped off her engagement ring and thrown it on the floor.” Wow. Thank god
  I’m 100% faithful. The Traitors: Live Experience is in Covent Garden, London.
