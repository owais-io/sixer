  Police have urged Porepunkah shooting suspect Dezi Freeman to call triple zero
  and surrender as their “protracted” manhunt in difficult terrain enters its
  third evening. Victoria police said on Thursday they had conducted searches on
  multiple properties near the rural township, warning anyone who harboured the
  alleged gunman would be prosecuted. Superintendent Brett Kahan on Thursday
  addressed Freeman directly during a press conference. “If Dezi Freeman is
  watching this, ring triple zero, and we will support a surrender plan,” he
  said. “That option is absolutely open to him.” There have been no confirmed
  sightings of Freeman, 56, since he allegedly killed Det Leading Sen Const Neal
  Thompson, 59, and Sen Const Vadim De Waart, 35, at a rural property on Tuesday
  morning. Police have said he was heavily armed. Sign up: AU Breaking News
  email Severe weather conditions in Victoria’s high country were expected to
  hamper the police’s third day of the search. Deputy commissioner regional
  operations, Russell Barrett, on Thursday said “every available asset” was
  being put into the manhunt and the other policing organisations were assisting
  with the effort. “We will not rest until we apprehend the offender,” he said,
  describing the search as “protracted” owing to the difficult terrain police
  were navigating. “We will tread carefully through that terrain, because we
  obviously don’t want to put any of our members in danger.” On Thursday
  afternoon, the Australian federal police confirmed it was providing assistance
  to the Porepunkah operation at the request of Victoria police. Guardian
  Australia understands officers from the tactical response team have been
  deployed. Parts of Victoria’s alpine region, in the state’s north-east, were
  blanketed with fresh snow on Wednesday night, with the Bureau of Meteorology
  warning one of the strongest and widespread cold outbreaks of the winter
  season would move across the state in the coming days. Victoria police on
  Thursday said “severe weather conditions” had complicated travel in the area.
  As the manhunt continued, Porepunkah primary school – which went into lockdown
  on Tuesday – reopened. On Thursday, police said local residents – who had been
  urged to stay indoors – could move around outside but should remain vigilant
  and not approach the alleged gunman if they came across him. A message from
  Victoria police, seen by Guardian Australia, said police continued to search
  for Freeman, who was “armed and dangerous”. The state’s police minister,
  Anthony Carbines, on Thursday said the force was “throwing everything” at
  finding the “dangerous, armed offender at large”. He told ABC radio the
  officers had been “shot down in cold blood doing their job” and Freeman would
  be “held accountable”. Members of the public, particularly those visiting
  nearby ski resorts, were urged not to enter Porepunkah and use alternative
  routes. Carbines said the Victoria police chief commissioner, Mike Bush, had
  not asked for any additional financial support, while interstate police had
  provided technical and specialised assistance. Bush on Wednesday acknowledged
  Freeman knew Victoria’s high country “better than us”. He said anything was
  possible, including that Freeman had set up traps in the bushland. Bush said
  Freeman, who was seen running into the bush alone immediately after the
  shooting, understood “bushcraft well”. He was last seen wearing khaki
  tracksuit pants, a dark green rain jacket, brown Blundstone boots and reading
  glasses, police said. Bush said police had not recovered any firearms from the
  property where the shooting took place, leading officers to believe Freeman
  had taken them all with him. Bush would not confirm reports Freeman may have
  also taken police firearms. Freeman said he had a history of unpleasant
  encounters with the force, who he called “terrorist thugs”, “frigging Nazis”
  and “Gestapo” that wore “the satanic symbol” of an “inverted pentagram” on
  their uniforms, according to court records. He also has a history of
  association with pseudolaw and “sovereign citizen” ideas. On Wednesday,
  Victoria police named Thompson, an adventure-loving local detective planning
  his retirement, and Waart, on temporary assignment in the alpine region, as
  the police officers who Freeman allegedly shot as they attempted to execute a
  search warrants. Another office was injured. The officer, in a stable
  condition after surgery, was being treated at the Alfred hospital. The two
  police officers had been part of a group of 10 police – made up of local
  officers and members of the sexual offences and child abuse investigation team
  – who entered the property in Porepunkah. Bush said the loss of the two
  officers had “struck at the heart” of the force, the broader policing family
  and the community of Porepunkah. “In the coming days, weeks and months, we
  will all grieve this loss and deeply miss our colleagues and friends who have
  paid the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty,” Bush said. “It is not lost
  on me that our members take a risk every time they go to work to protect the
  Victorian community. While we all live with the knowledge that the worst could
  happen on a shift, we don’t expect it to.” Overnight, Melbourne landmarks
  including Flinders Street station and the Shrine of Remembrance were lit up in
  blue to honour the officers allegedly shot dead by Freeman. In parliament on
  Thursday, Anthony Albanese, the leader of the opposition, Sussan Ley, and the
  member for Indi, Helen Haines, paid tribute to the victims.
