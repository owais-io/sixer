  Nigel Farage has rolled back on his pledge to deport “absolutely anyone”
  arriving in the UK on small boats just 24 hours after making it at a combative
  press conference in Oxford that led to accusations of ugly and destructive
  rhetoric. Farage announced plans to deport hundreds of thousands of asylum
  seekers in the first five years of a Reform government and to pay despotic
  regimes such as the Taliban to take them back. He also said: “Yes, women and
  children, everybody on arrival, will be detained.” At a press conference near
  Edinburgh on Wednesday, however, when asked whether his comments on securing
  women’s safety in the UK rang hollow when he had committed to deporting women
  and girls back to countries where they faced oppression and sexual violence,
  Farage said that was not true. At an event to introduce the MSP Graham Simpson
  as the latest defection from the Scottish Conservatives to Reform, Farage
  said: “We’re not even discussing women and children at this stage, there are
  so many illegal males in Britain.” Asked if that meant women and children were
  exempt from the plans, he said: “I didn’t say exempt for ever, but at this
  stage it is not part of our plan for the next five years.” Farage similarly
  rowed back on his proposal to renegotiate the Good Friday agreement after
  political parties in Northern Ireland condemned his comment as reckless and
  irresponsible. He said “the Northern Ireland situation is deeply complex” and
  “that will not be at the forefront of what we do”. Farage also denied having a
  “woman problem”. He said increasing numbers of women had joinedReform over the
  summer and that they were “becoming very strong forces the party”. Describing
  Reform is a “rapidly evolving political movement in Scotland”, he hailed his
  party’s “remarkable result” at the Hamilton byelection in June, when his
  candidate Ross Lambie won 26% of the vote and said there were 200 potential
  candidates being vetted across the country. He predicted “pretty much a
  wipe-out” for the Scottish Conservatives at next May’s Holyrood elections.
  Simpson becomes Reform’s sole MSP sitting in the Scottish parliament, and its
  second MSP overall after the former Tory Michelle Ballantyne’s defection in
  the last parliamentary session. Appealing to former colleagues, Simpson said:
  “I say to those who have great ideas for Scotland and who may have felt
  ignored: ‘Talk to me, you will find my door – wherever I am put in parliament
  next week – open and receptive to the kind of fresh thinking that we need in
  politics.’” A number of anti-immigration protests have taken place outside
  asylum seekers’ accommodation in Scotland over the summer, in Falkirk, Perth
  and Aberdeen, but not on the scale of those in England. Participants were
  often outnumbered by anti-racism counter-protests. The Scottish Tory leader,
  Russell Findlay, said on Monday that recent protests outside an asylum hotel
  in Falkirk were understandable after an Afghan asylum seeker raped a local
  teenager. Sadeq Nikzad, 29, was jailed for nine years in June after attacking
  the 15-year-old in Falkirk town centre in October 2023. Farage said that his
  press conference on Tuesday had “sparked the beginning of a national debate”,
  and that “even the prime minister hasn’t attacked me on the idea that we
  should be deporting people that come illegally”. Downing Street accused him of
  not being serious about his plans. Simpson also denied at Wednesday’s event
  that he had been obliged to apologise for his behaviour towards a junior
  female staffer, after a Scottish Conservative source briefed reporters that he
  was “a pathetic, nasty little man who won’t be missed”. “Just last year, he
  had to apologise to a young female member of staff for acting in a totally
  inappropriate, bullying and intimidating way towards her,” the source said.
  Simpson said the allegation was “absolutely untrue”. “Anything internally will
  be dealt with internally and that’s the way I’ll leave it,” he said. “I
  certainly don’t have a problem with women.”
