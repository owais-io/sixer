  Bobby Beasley was staying in his 1984 Volkswagen T25 Campervan with girlfriend
  Rach when he took this photo. The couple were on the Isle of Harris, in the
  Outer Hebrides. “We’ve both always loved camping and getting out to remote
  spots, preferably on the coast,” Beasley says. “The west coast of Scotland is
  one of our favourite areas to explore.” On their first morning at Horgabost
  Campsite, with its views over Luskentyre beach and its Caribbean-style white
  sand and turquoise waters, they awoke to a thick sea fret. “As it burned away
  and lifted a little, the early morning sun shone through from the mountains
  behind and caused this crazy-looking ghost rainbow,” Beasley says. The pair
  didn’t lose their chance at this shot, “hence why Rach is standing in her
  pyjamas! I didn’t want to miss the moment, especially as it was positioned so
  perfectly over our van.” With that in mind, Beasley used the camera most
  immediately at hand: his iPhone 11. He applied no edits aside from cropping to
  a 4:3 ratio. “I made sure when taking it that I’d put the focus on Rach and
  that the sky wasn’t overexposed,” he adds. “I liked having my shadow in the
  shot, too. It makes for a nice triangular composition.” The pair had never
  seen anything like it before. While the mist stuck around for the rest of the
  day, casting an ethereal light on their surroundings, the ghost rainbow was
  soon gone.
