  Three children charged with murder after the death of a man in a Kent seaside
  resort have appeared in court. Police were called to the Warden Bay Road area
  of Leysdown-on-Sea on the Isle of Sheppey shortly after 7pm on Sunday after a
  disturbance involving a small number of people, Kent police said. Alexander
  Cashford, 49, was confirmed dead at the scene, which was attended by officers
  and the South East Coast ambulance service. Police said he had sustained a
  number of injuries. A 16-year-old girl and two boys, aged 14 and 15, were
  jointly charged with murder on Tuesday and appeared at Medway magistrates
  court on Wednesday afternoon. The three teenagers, all from London, are
  thought to have been on holiday in Kent at the time of the attack. They were
  accompanied in court by their parents, while other family members watched from
  the public gallery. Prosecuting, Dylan Bradshaw said: “What we know is that
  Alexander Cashford, a 49-year-old male, shortly after 7pm on Sunday August 10
  went to the beach area of Warden Bay. About an hour and five minutes later he
  was pronounced dead – during that period, he was the subject of a violent
  assault.” The attack is alleged to have involved a glass bottle and rocks
  being thrown, the court heard. The 16-year-old girl and 14-year-old boy both
  cried during the hearing, while the 15-year-old boy looked at the floor,
  rocking slightly. The three, who cannot be named because of their ages, were
  remanded into youth detention accommodation to appear on Thursday at Maidstone
  crown court. Another girl, 12, who was arrested in Basildon, Essex, on
  Tuesday, is still in custody while the police investigation continues.
  Detectives urged any witnesses who had not yet spoken to the police to contact
  them. Kent police confirmed that Cashford had allegedly been assaulted after a
  disturbance involving a small group of people. Residents said the incident was
  shocking and that “nothing ever happens” in the area.
