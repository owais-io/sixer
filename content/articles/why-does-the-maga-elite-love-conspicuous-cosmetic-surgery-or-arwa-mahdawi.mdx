  A group of chimpanzees in Zambia have been very busy putting grass in their
  ears and sticks up their bum for fashion purposes. Scientists studying the
  behaviour think that one influential chimp started the trend and, instead of
  the rest of the gang going, “mate, you look like an idiot”, they all just
  followed suit. Clearly we haven’t evolved from apes that much because a
  similar phenomenon is at play with the billionaire and Make America Great
  Again (Maga) set, who are spending enormous sums of money acquiring identical
  plastic faces. The trend is so widespread that it’s even got a name:
  Mar-a-Lago face. Among women the look is characterised by huge lips that look
  as if they could suck up a small child whole, frozen facial expressions, and
  cheeks so bulbous you could hide a gerbil underneath them. Men also have the
  slick frozen faces, but instead of bigger lips they’re pairing them with
  bigger jaws. In recent years, surgeons have reported a large increase of male
  clients demanding stronger jawlines. I wouldn’t normally be snarky about
  someone’s looks but let’s be clear: nobody is born with Mar-a-Lago face. These
  are not human faces, they are luxury meat-masks meant to signal wealth and
  in-group belonging. People such as Laura Loomer, Kristi Noem, and Matt Gaetz
  can afford excellent surgeons and subtle cosmetic work but, unless they’ve all
  had botched procedures, it seems they deliberately chose to look like
  AI-generated caricatures. One can only surmise that they live in such weird
  little bubbles, where everyone is addicted to filler, that this sort of
  conspicuous consumption of cosmetic surgery has become desirable. Having the
  right look is certainly desirable to optics-obsessed Donald Trump, whose chief
  concern for his underlings appears to be how they perform on TV. In 2017, an
  Axios report claimed that Trump wanted his female staff to “dress like women”
  and demanded that his male employees have a “certain look.” Over the years it
  seems the “certain look” has only become more extreme. An obsession with
  traditional gender norms also seems to factor into today’s exaggerated
  aesthetics. Earlier this year a New York-based dermatologist told Politico
  that fashion often shifts to more traditional gender expression in culturally
  conservative times. “It’s ironic … that they’re so against trans-ness and
  gender-affirming care for trans people,” the dermatologist said of Trump’s
  inner orbit. “Because, you know, they’re all doing their own gender-affirming
  care.” The Zambian bum-stick chimps seem positively sophisticated in
  comparison. • Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist • Do you have an opinion on
