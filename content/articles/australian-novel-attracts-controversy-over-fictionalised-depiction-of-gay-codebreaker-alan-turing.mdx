  A novel written by a prominent book industry figure in which persecuted gay
  man Alan Turing has sex with a woman and fathers a child has been criticised
  online for its portrayal of the codebreaker. The Turing Protocol was released
  in July and was written by Nick Croydon, the CEO of QBD Books, the largest
  Australian-owned bookshop chain, where the book is being heavily promoted.
  Published by Affirm Press, which was bought by Simon &amp; Schuster last year,
  the novel’s cover features the question: “If you had the power to change
  history, would you dare?” In the thriller, Turing, the brilliant British
  wartime mathematician and computer pioneer, builds a time travel machine and
  has sex with Joan Clarke, with whom he secretly fathers a child. Turing is
  otherwise depicted as gay and the story includes details of his persecution
  for his sexuality. In real life, Turing was briefly engaged to Bletchley Park
  colleague, Clarke, when the pair were employed in vital code-breaking during
  the war. He was later convicted for “gross indecency” with another man and
  died by suicide at the age of 41 after enduring chemical castration. Queen
  Elizabeth II posthumously pardoned Turing in 2013, four years after prime
  minister Gordon Brown apologised for his “appalling” treatment. Croydon told
  The Australian newspaper he had not pretended Turing was straight, but needed
  to give him a child for the purpose of his plot. “I wrote this novel as a
  tribute to him. I wanted to highlight the genius that he was, but also the
  injustice that he suffered,” he said. As of Tuesday afternoon, the book had
  received 115 ratings on Goodreads, with five stars making up 21% and one stars
  making up 64%. Many of the most positive reviews came from first-time
  Goodreads reviewers. The negative reviews included anger about what some
  claimed was the “erasure” of gay history. “Anyone who is aware of Alan Turing
  and his prosecution will be scratching their head in disbelief,” one reader
  wrote. “Erasing the whole point of Alan Turing’s tragedy is one of the worst
  things someone can do. Erasing LGBTQ history, erasing a real person’s pain? …
  Turing was not some fictional character to straight-ify,” wrote another. The
  book is QBD’s fiction book of the month and is being actively marketed by the
  company, including a promotional Channel 7 interview in which Croydon
  explained that his favourite subjects at school were history and mathematics.
  Authors who have endorsed the book include historical fiction writer Fiona
  McIntosh and former QBD fiction book of the month author, Chris Hammer, who
  compared the book to Dan Brown’s The Da Vinci Code. Prize-winning author Trent
  Dalton described the book as “wildly imaginative” and urged people to “read
  the Turing Protocol now”, while Candice Fox said it was “vivid”. Commenting on
  gay erasure broadly, Equality Australia legal director, Heather Corkhill, told
  Guardian Australia that “erasing or marginalising LGBTIQ+ people and
  characters from historical and cultural narratives to fit a more
  heteronormative or ‘traditional’ worldview is not a new phenomenon – but it
  risks erasing our shared history and diminishing our understanding of the
  LGBTQ+ experience”. “At no time did I say Turing wasn’t gay,” Croydon said,
  according to the Australian. “The book makes it very plain that he is gay. It
  talks about how he had to hide the fact that he was gay, and in the historical
  note page at the back of the book I again acknowledge the travesty of the
  treatment he received.” In a statement released last week, QBD said throughout
  the novel, Turing’s “identity as a gay man is neither erased, questioned nor
  diminished”. “Speculative historical fiction often examines phenomena like
  lavender marriages – arrangements where LGBTQ+ individuals married
  opposite-sex partners due to societal pressures, ensuring protection and
  companionship – which were common during Turing’s era and beyond. “Regarding
  reviews, it’s not unusual for friends, family, colleagues and peers to provide
  reviews of an author’s work. QBD Books staff are a team of avid readers across
  the country who engage with literature passionately, some of whom have shared
  their genuine views on the book – both complimentary and critical. “QBD Books’
  Book of the Month program follows a rigorous selection process that highlights
  debut or new authors who have written standout works. Each month submissions
  are received from publishers, and new releases are reviewed by our team of
  expert buyers, after which we select four titles for the whole calendar month
  to spotlight.” QBD, Simon and Schuster and Croydon have been contacted for
  comment.
