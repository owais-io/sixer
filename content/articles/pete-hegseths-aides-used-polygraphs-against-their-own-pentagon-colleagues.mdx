  Senior aides to the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, conducted polygraphs on
  their own colleagues this spring, in some cases as part of an effort to flush
  out anyone who leaked to the media and apparently to undercut rivals in
  others, according to four people familiar with the matter. The polygraphs came
  at a time of profound upheaval in his office, as Hegseth opened a leak
  investigation and sought to identify the culprits by any means necessary after
  a series of sensitive disclosures and unflattering stories. But the polygraphs
  became contentious after the aides who were targeted questioned whether they
  were even official, given at least one polygraph was ordered without Hegseth’s
  direct knowledge and sparked an intervention by a Trump adviser who does not
  work at the Pentagon. The fraught episode involved Hegseth’s lawyer and
  part-time navy commander Tim Parlatore seeking to polygraph Patrick Weaver, a
  senior adviser to the secretary who was at the White House in Donald Trump’s
  first term and has ties to Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, the
  people said. When Weaver learned of his impending polygraph, he complained to
  associates that he had been suspected without evidence, the people said. That
  led the external Trump adviser to take his complaint to Hegseth – only for
  Hegseth to say he did not even know about the test. The external Trump adviser
  called Parlatore on his cellphone to shut down the impending polygraph,
  shouting down the line that in Trump’s second term, career employees did not
  get to question political appointees, according to two people familiar with
  the conversation. Weaver does not appear to have escalated his complaint to
  the White House, telling associates that he preferred not to bother Miller
  with problems. Earlier reports suggested the White House intervened on
  Weaver’s behalf but the people said the White House learned of the test after
  it was cancelled. A White House spokesperson declined to comment. A Pentagon
  spokesperson, Sean Parnell, said in a statement: “The Department will not
  comment on an ongoing investigation.” The extraordinary episode underscored
  ongoing concerns around Hegseth’s ability to manage the Pentagon – he is still
  facing an inspector general report into his disclosures in a Signal chat about
  US strikes against the Houthis – and why a Trump adviser ended up staging an
  intervention. Weaver’s cancelled polygraph was earlier reported by the
  Washington Post. But the effort at the Pentagon to weed out leakers with lie
  detector tests continued against uniformed military officers even after the
  incident with Weaver, three of the people said. Hegseth’s then-military aide
  and current acting chief of staff, Ricky Buria, at one point ordered
  polygraphs against several people connected to possible and perceived rivals
  at the Pentagon including senior adviser Eric Geressy, despite his own
  polygraph coming back as inconclusive. Buria, who is said not to care for
  Geressy, did not order a polygraph against him in the wake of the Weaver
  incident. Instead, the people said, he ordered polygraphs for officers who
  worked for Geressy, including Hegseth’s military assistants Capt William
  Francis, a former Navy Seal, and Col Mike Loconsolo. In an additional twist,
  the polygraphs for the uniformed officials became fraught after one person
  complained his had not been conducted by the Defense Intelligence Agency but a
  defense department contractor, and was separately told his polygraph could
  just double as being for his regular background investigation, two people
  familiar with the matter said. Hegseth himself threatened polygraphs to catch
  leakers, including against two top military officials, the Wall Street Journal
  earlier reported: navy Adm Christopher Grady, the vice-chair of the joint
  chiefs of staff, and army Lt Gen Douglas Sims, the director of the joint
  staff. According to two people familiar with the case of Sims, Buria had
  privately suggested that he might have played a role in leaking a classified
  plan for the Panama canal to NBC News, among other transgressions that
  included an allegation that Sims had been disrespectful. While it does not
  appear that Sims was actually polygraphed, Hegseth revoked his promotion to a
  four star general, despite earlier agreeing to the move at the recommendation
  of multiple career and political officials, the New York Times earlier
  reported. Hegseth told Sims that his connections to Gen Mark Milley, the
  former chief of the joint staff that Trump hates, were disqualifying –
  although Sims had ironically helped remove Milley’s portrait off the wall at
  the Pentagon when Hegseth arrived at the Pentagon, one of the people said.
  Several officials, including the chairman of the joint chiefs, Gen Dan Caine,
  told Hegseth that Sims was not a leaker and deserved better. Hegseth told
  officials he would sleep on it but never revisited the matter, the people
  said.
