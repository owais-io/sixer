  In response to the recent publication of Anne Owers’ report on prison
  capacity, Martin Kettle rightly points out that our prison system has
  historically been out of sight and out of mind, not a priority for anyone –
  whether among government departments or in the public consciousness (The
  biggest problem for Starmer and co: the machinery of government is broken and
  they can’t fix it, 7 August). This is something we must change. It should
  matter to all of us, not least because the distance that lies between
  law-abiding lives and the justice system is thinner than we like to think. The
  blame for the crisis can be fairly laid at the doors of multiple governments
  who have traduced the prison system in the quest for votes, playing to the
  very worst of our human instincts. What we need is vision and courage. We need
  leadership that works for change and looks beyond day-by-day headcount
  management, and investment in what really works. And what really works is
  already evidenced in the work of so many small, independent charities across
  the justice system. None of it is rocket science. Time and again it proves to
  be person-centred, relational work delivered by a trained and supported
  workforce. If we increased investment in that now, we would see the savings
  three, five and 10 years down the line. The challenge is breaking the learned
  patterns of crisis management across the system, which roll from brink of
  breakdown to brink of breakdown and perpetuate a short-term vision framed
  forever in the assumption of inexorable increases in numbers. Penny Parker
  Founder and CEO, StandOut • Martin Kettle is right about the prison crisis,
  but, as it were, not correct enough. Since the media’s representation of
  “public demand” stands only for tougher sentencing and treatment, the prison
  system has not only all but disintegrated as money has tightened, but the most
  devastating consequence has been the rise of readmission rates. Almost all
  attempts to sustain re-education and reform of prisoners have been replaced by
  dysfunctional repression of what this induces: enduring alienation. Richard
  Ellis Derby • Martin Kettle is right in explaining a major reason why the UK’s
  prisons have problems in accommodating convicted people. But it ignores the
  issue of our having the largest numbers in prison of any country in western
  Europe. About 30 years ago I was a school governor alongside an experienced
  justice of the peace who was also an ex-teacher. We discussed the introduction
  of restorative justice to help reduce the numbers in prison and reduce
  reoffending. I said that it seemed that a significant number of people in
  prison were, possibly, creative but they had used that creativity in the wrong
  way. She agreed. I think the same still applies but our current leader is
  taking the pragmatic approach to so many things that such questions as this
  will not be asked. It’s long past time that they were; other aspects of public
  services and education should be addressed to reduce offending and make more
  of people’s positive potential. David Cockayne Lymm, Cheshire
