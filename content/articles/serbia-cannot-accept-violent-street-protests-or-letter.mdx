  I write in response to your editorial on Serbia (25 August). Over the past
  nine months, Serbia has experienced more than 23,000 unauthorised rallies.
  Most were small, sometimes just a few dozen people, but they disturbed daily
  life, brought government to a halt, and recently turned violent. More than 170
  police officers have been injured. Despite this, police actions have remained
  limited and restrained, and have targeted only those who damaged property or
  assaulted officers. The initial demands of student protesters late last year
  were met promptly. We opened investigations, released thousands of documents
  on the railway station renovation and boosted education funding, and the prime
  minister resigned, taking responsibility for youth clashes over the issue.
  Nevertheless, demonstrations continued, shifting away from seeking justice and
  toward overt political aims: the removal of the government outside democratic
  processes. Serbia is deeply engaged with Europe and steadily advancing its
  democratic and economic development. The EU provides more than 60% of foreign
  direct investment and has committed €1.6bn by 2027 to support reforms. Such a
  level of engagement is hardly consistent with the idea of Serbia as an
  “authoritarian” and “malign” outlier in the region. The EU would not invest so
  heavily in a country where its values and interests were fundamentally
  rejected. Serbia is a democracy. It will hold elections before the 2027
  deadline, as it has consistently done for more than a decade, and in the
  meantime it is making progress on electoral reforms. What Serbia cannot accept
  is violence disguised as activism, undermining institutions that have been
  carefully built with dedication and the support of its European partners.
  Aleksandar Vučić President of the Republic of Serbia
