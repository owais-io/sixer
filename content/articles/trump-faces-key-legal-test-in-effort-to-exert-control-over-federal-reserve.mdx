  Donald Trump’s battle to exert control over the Federal Reserve faces a key
  legal test today, with a governor of the central bank seeking a temporary
  block on his extraordinary attempt to fire her. Lisa Cook sued the US
  president on Thursday, with her lawyers describing his attempt to dismiss her
  as “unprecedented and illegal”, and based on “pretextual” allegations. The
  case is widely expected to be ultimately decided by the supreme court. While
  it makes it way through the courts, Cook is seeking a temporary restraining
  order against Trump’s attempt to “immediately” dismiss her from the Fed’s
  board. A hearing on the motion is set for 10am in Washington on Friday. The
  case has been assigned to US district judge Jia Cobb, an appointee of Joe
  Biden. Trump wrote to Cook on Monday, telling her that he was removing her
  from her position “effective immediately”, based on the allegation from one of
  his allies that she had obtained a mortgage on a second home she incorrectly
  described as her primary residence. The president has spent months attacking
  the Fed, where most policymakers – including Cook – have so far defied his
  calls for interest rate cuts. He has spoken of rapidly building “a majority”
  on the central bank’s board, calling into question the future of its
  longstanding independence from political oversight. Firing Cook, whose term is
  not due to expire until 2038, would enable Trump to nominate a replacement.
  But she has argued the president has “no authority” to remove her. “An
  unsubstantiated allegation about private mortgage applications submitted by
  Governor Cook prior to her Senate confirmation is not [cause],” her lawyers
  argued in the complaint. “President Trump’s letter purporting to fire Governor
  Cook did not cite appropriate cause for removing her from the board of
  governors.” The White House claimed on Thursday that Cook had been “credibly
  accused of lying” by the administration. But the accusations are unconfirmed,
  and her lawyers said Trump and his officials had not explicitly alleged that
  any error on her mortgage paperwork was intentional. It comes as the Fed gears
  up to resume rate cuts as soon as next month, albeit not at the scale or pace
  Trump has repeatedly demanded – and its chair, Jerome Powell, has cautioned
  that the president’s tariffs and immigration crackdown have disrupted the
  global economy and knocked the US labor force.
