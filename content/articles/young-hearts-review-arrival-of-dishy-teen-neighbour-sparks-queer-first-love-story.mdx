  Here is a movie from Belgium about young queer love, with an obvious
  superficial resemblance to Lukas Dhont’s recent intense drama Close. But for
  all that this film shows an arguably refreshing and perhaps even radical
  refusal to problematise the central relationship, it looks pretty shallow in
  comparison. Elias (Lou Goossens) is a teen boy in rural Belgium, notionally
  going out with Valerie (Saar Rogiers), a girl at his school. His grandpa is a
  farmer nearby, his dad a composer of cheesy but successful pop songs. Elias is
  quietly stunned when a good-looking boy of his age moves in next door, just
  arrived from Brussels; this is Alexander (Marius De Saeger). They become
  friends; Alexander is perfectly calm and candid about being gay and then they
  become more than friends. They have to deal with homophobic bullying at school
  and Elias’s discarded girlfriend has to handle her own feelings of anger and
  rejection. The drama sorts itself out neatly before the closing credits and
  the older generation on both sides seem to be very enlightened, which is
  surprising, if admirable, in the case of Elias’s rural farmer grandpa. In the
  end there is something a little too smooth and passionless in the film – there
  is nothing, for example to match or even approach the great speech from
  Michael Stuhlbarg’s caring father to Timothée Chalamet’s heartbroken Elio in
  Guadagnino’s Call Me By Your Name. Everyone knows that young love, gay and
  straight, is (mostly) about heartbreak and about moving on. I’m not sure that
  this film really understands that. • Young Hearts is in UK cinemas from 8
  August.
