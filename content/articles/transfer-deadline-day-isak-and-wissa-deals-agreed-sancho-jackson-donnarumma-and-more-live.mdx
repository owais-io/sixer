  David Flynn gets in touch: “Maybe Pep has analysed the current state of
  football and decided that he must evolve into what I’m choosing to call his
  Jack Charlton period. I look forward to Donnarumma, with a big hoof straight
  from the hands, up to Haaland.” Yes, at last Pep may see the error of his
  ways, and throw all those medal’s he’s won in the bin. Kari Tulinius gets in
  touch: “I’m terrible at fantasy football, so I decided to just chuck it in
  this year and engage in a bit of music nerdery at the same time. My team, the
  Global Gang of Johns, is entirely made up of guys named John, or international
  variations thereof (e.g. Jean and João). Unexpectedly, I’m doing much better
  than I have when I tried to be smart about it. However, as my two goalkeepers
  are Jason Sean Steele and Daniel Ian Bentley, I could really use Gianluigi
  Donnarumma. I realize this is a niche reason, but I’m really hoping that City
  get that transfer over the line.” It is suggested by Fabrizio Romano that
  another potential Fulham arrival is Raheem Sterling. Let’s see. Sterling is
  one of three Chelsea players with no future at the club but time left on his
  contract. The two others coming to mind are Ben Chilwell and Axel Disasi. Will
  Chelsea pay them out and leave them as free agents? Unclear at the moment.
  Brentford have agreed a deal to sign Arsenal’s Reiss Nelson on loan for the
  season and are still hoping to add more reinforcements to their squad today
  after allowing Yoane Wissa to join Newcastle. Crystal Palace, Besiktas and
  Fulham - where Nelson spent last year on loan - had also held talks over a
  move for the 25-year-old who came through Arsenal’s academy but he will now
  join Keith Andrews’ side instead and is set for a medical this afternoon.
  Brentford are understood to have cooled their interest in Borussia Dortmund’s
  Max Beier after seeing a £45m bid rejected last week, while PSV Eindhoven have
  also turned down a £25m offer for Joey Veermen over the weekend. Meanwhile,
  Fulham are moving closer to securing a club record £34m deal to sign Shakhtar
  Donetsk’s Kevin, while Milan’s Samuel Chukwueze could also arrive on an
  initial loan before the transfer deadline. On the subject of Arsenal, who are
  presumably spent up now. “The mentality is always to go forward, to be
  attacking, to be aggressive, to try to dominate the game and create chances,”
  Merino said. “But sometimes the game of football is like this. Sometimes the
  ball puts you in a certain situation. You have to adapt to it. John Culley
  gets in touch: “Although Arsenal have bought early and often in this window,
  looks like Arteta needs three players for each position if they are going to
  get injured at this rate. Kiwior has been a good squad player for the last
  couple of seasons, wish him well with his move to Porto, and hope the new
  signing Hincapie has ligaments of iron to deal with whatever is causing our
  injury curse.” Manchester United fans, getting excited about the “new
  Courtois”? The new Simon Mignolet would do at the moment – the old one is
  still playing well for Brugge, as it happens. Martínez would be a good buy,
  too, experienced like a Van Der Sar purchase but that’s not how modern
  transfers work, is it? Where will Martínez go? Senne Lammens is on his way to
  Manchester so it appears the 23-year-old will join Ruben Amorin’s squad.
  United deal for Lammens is €21m plus add ons - there is no sell on; 5-year
  contract. The player, who is travelling to Manchester, is viewed as an
  exciting young goalkeeper with a bright future. Utd considered other GKs
  (Emiliano Martínez), but ended plumping for the Belgian. James Kell gets in
  touch: “As a Newcastle fan, been both “victim” and beneficiary of this trend
  for players to down tools to force a move, which I really don’t enjoy, and I
  must say, in an era of grasping agents and prima donnas, hats off to Marc
  Guehi for not just continuing to turn out for Palace but for being outstanding
  for them and being a captain and leader. Top pro, top man, that’s how you do
  it.” Edward Ricketts gets in touch: “Hard to fathom how Donnarumma is suddenly
  second choice at PSG, having played a massive role in their Champions League
  triumph last season and having been arguably the best keeper in the world
  during that time. Utterly ruthless from Enrique and undoubtedly a coup for
  City. Any thoughts?” Not sure it’s a question being second choice though the
  writing was on the wall was Lucas Chevalier came in. Luis Enrique has
  overhauled the squad with Luis Campos and Donnarumma was signed by a different
  regime, and as part of the Mino Raiola agency, now run after his death by
  Rafaela Pimenta, such players are often on the move because of high demands
  for their players. Erling Haaland is one of their clients, of course, so City
  have a business relationship. The odd thing is Luis Enrique wants a
  progressive keeper who can play from the back and yet Pep, from the same
  school of thinking, is prepared to deal with a keeper from the Francesco
  Toldo/Gianluigi Buffon school of shot-stopping. Kieran McKintosh gets in
  touch: “Morning John. Watched last night’s game with my best friend, a Palace
  fan. Absolutely excruciating way to lose, but what can you do? “We wondered
  after if Glasner could walk. He’s not very impressed with transfer business
  and a manager like him will have his pick of the clubs if he does decide to
  go. I am no longer convinced Arteta is up to the job, so do you reckon Oliver
  Glasner would be a good candidate as the next manager of Arsenal (if you think
  it will get to that point? “ Made a prediction that Glasner will be in charge
  of Bayern this time next year. He’ll have plenty of takers. Could see him at
  Arsenal, United, City, any of them. His stock could not be higher. Maybe he
  might fancy winning the Conference League and signing off. He’s a patient man
  but always truthful in press conferences, he’s friendly but not afraid of
  speaking his mind. He’s almost too adult for the football game. He can also
  make a team play 3-4-3, which is beyond certain other managers. Nathan
  Patterson’s proposed move from Everton to Sevilla appears to be off. The
  Scotland international had been in talks over a season loan as he attempts to
  revive an injury-hit career. But with Sevilla right back Juanlu Sanchez
  looking likely to remain at the club - Napoli were interested - that avenue
  now looks closed. Harrison Armstrong, the promising 18-year-old midfielder,
  could depart on loan depending on whether Everton strengthen in that
  department first. The club are currently in talks with Freiburg’s Merlin Rohl.
  Everton have received several offers for Armstrong and another homegrown
  midfielder, Tyler Onyango, is also set to leave on loan today. Nottingham
  Forest are pushing to sign the Strasbourg winger Dilane Bakwa, with left-back
  Cuiabano also primed to join from Botafogo before the deadline. Forest are
  targeting a couple of additions, while two or three fringe players could
  depart. Strasbourg, part of the BlueCo group that own Chelsea, rejected a £30m
  bid from Forest for Bakwa earlier this window, with the Ligue 1 club wanting
  closer to £35m. Nuno Espírito Santo is to hold talks with Evangelos Marinakis
  over his future in the coming days after a rift with Edu, the global head of
  football at Marinakis’s stable of clubs. Nuno conceded Sunday’s collapse in
  the 3-0 home defeat to West Ham hardly strengthens his hand. Beginning to
  worry about Brentford. An awful lot of pressure on Kevin Schade, who missed a
  penalty at the weekend. At least Igor Jesus is in the goals. Wissa’s exit
  would be the second major sale at Brentford this window, with Bryan Mbeumo
  joining Manchester United for an initial £65m. Last summer Brentford sold Ivan
  Toney to Al-Ahli in a £40m deal. Brentford have seen several high-profile
  departures this summer, with Thomas Frank leaving to become Tottenham manager
  and former club captain Christian Nørgaard signing for Arsenal. Brentford
  broke their transfer record to land Dango Ouattara from Bournemouth in a
  £42.5m deal. Will they make moves before the end of today? They surely must.
  Wissa gets his wish. Seems like refusing to play is the way to get a move
  these days. That doesn’t sit right, but this is where we are now. Our story on
  Ten Hag, another fallen victim to the enduring curse of Manchester United. Dan
  King, Villa fans gets in touch: “As a Villa fan the Sancho signing smacks of
  panic. If we can afford him, why not Jack Grealish? If Sancho gets his head
  down, works hard and acts professionally then he has the talent to succeed.
  Unfortunately he has a strong reputation for not getting his head down, not
  working hard and acting unprofessionally. It’s got bad news written all over
  it. But then I felt the same about Marcus Rashford, about whom there were also
  questions about his attitude, and he was great for us.” I saw Grealish play on
  Saturday for Everton, and he was fantastic. The Villa Grealish, you’d much
  rather have than Sancho. Good morning, and welcome. Anything can happen from
  here. Well, sort of. Seems like the moves we have discussed all summer are
  coming to fruition. Goalkeepers seem the order of the day, with Donnarumma set
  for City, it seems, and Manchester United’s need to sign one, if not two,
  keepers. Righto, that’s it from me; here’s John Brewin to guide you through
  the next bit. Back to Palace, can they really sell Guéhi? He’s available for
  free in the summer, but what message does it send to Glasner if they do? He
  was very clear last evening in stating how crucial it is that he remains.
  “With Ten Hag’s sacking following Mourinho’s and Solskjær’s a few days ago,”
  begins Dean Haigh, “it’s perhaps telling that Manchester United managers seem
  to really struggle after leaving while players seem to go from strength to
  strength. It suggests that despite Amorim constantly denigrating his players
  it is, and always has been, the managers who’ve been the problem.” There’s a
  lot of blame to go around, so no need to be sparing, and I also think it’s
  fair to say that lots of players have left and still been poor. I’d still say
  the majority of the aggravation is on account of the Glazers, but agree the
  managers haven’t been good enough. AC Milan are trying to sign Joe Gomez, but
  Liverpool will only allow that if they succeed in snatching Marc Guéhi from
  Palace. On which point, what a shame it is to see Oliver Glasner’s FA Cup
  winners plundered in this manner – there’d have been a very serious side there
  if they’d only been able to buy rather than sell. Vill are, it seems, also
  interested in Harvey Elliott, a move that makes a lot more sense – and is a
  goodun for the player, too. He’s got his league-winners medal having
  contributed, and now he has to play regularly. Forcing his way into Emery’s
  midfield won’t be easy, though. Sancho loan to Villa nearly done: 80% wages to
  be paid by Villa along with bonuses that should happen, Utd believe, to have
  100% covered. Imagine how James Trafford must be feeling. Leave City to play,
  prove yourself, reject other offers to re-sign, have the club pursue a
  Champions League-winner to go ahead of you. I can’t lie, it freaks my nut that
  any top-half Premier League manager, never mind Unai Emery, wants Sancho. He’s
  got such a lovely touch and imagination, but sadly lacks the physicality to
  succeed in England, while there are also questions about his mentality. It’s
  hard to see this one working. Today’s Rumour Mill: How much of his wages they
  cover will depend on how many games he plays and so on. “Bemused at Manchester
  United apparently believing a 32-year-old keeper isn’t a ‘long term option’,”
  writes Paul McGrory. “Isn’t there anyone there who remembers signing Edwin van
  der Sar when he was turning 35 in October? I believe he was decent for a few
  months at least.” In fairness, he did have the advantage of being decent
  previously, but yes, I agree 32 is fine for a keeper. Martínez has, though,
  been poor in recent times, even if that still makes him several orders of
  magnitude better than Altay Bayindir and André Onana, but might just have the
  self-regard to succeed under the Old Trafford spotlight. Goodness me, that’ll
  be a sore one. Leverkusen have drawn one and lost one of their two Bundesliga
  games so far. Villa are also poised to sign Victor Lindelöf but, as he is a
  free agent after leaving United, they are not under pressure to get that deal
  done. Aston Villa are gearing up for an extremely busy day. As well as a move
  for Jadon Sancho, they are keen on a deal for Liverpool’s Harvey Elliott. Unai
  Emery wants attacking reinforcements after another flat performance in defeat
  on Sunday. Villa sold Jacob Ramsey to Newcastle this month and saw a recent
  inquiry for Lucas Paquetà dismissed by West Ham. Marco Asensio, who joined
  Villa on loan last season and someone greatly admired by Emery, has signed for
  Fenerbahce. As the Villa manager conceded after defeat to Crystal Palace, they
  also need to ‘fix’ the Emi Martínez-shaped problem. Martínez wants to leave
  for Manchester United. For what it’s worth, a Brentford-supporting mate of
  mine doesn’t rate Wissa, and £55m does seem steep. But the Bees must now act
  quickly to replace him because having lost him, Bryan Mbeumo, Christian
  Norgaard, Mark Flekken – and Thomas Frank – they find themselves 15th in the
  league, perhaps in danger of a relegation struggle. Newcastle have their other
  new forward. Thanks Niall and hi everyone. There’s a man in a Sky Sports coat
  stood outside the Newcastle training ground, talking about things entirely
  unaffected by his location. Let’s get on with it! Time for me to hand over to
  my esteemed colleague, Daniel Harris. Don’t forget you can track all the
  latest deals with our interactive guide. Manchester United are intent on
  signing either Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp or Emiliano Martínez from
  Aston Villa to strengthen Ruben Amorim’s goalkeeping options before the close
  of the transfer window. United are thought to prefer Lammens due to his age
  (23) and price (£17m); Martínez turns 32 on Tuesday, could cost £35m and is
  not viewed as a long-term option. But with Villa showing interest in Jadon
  Sancho, a deal could be done for the World Cup winner that sees Sancho used as
  a makeweight. Arsenal are expected to announce the signing of Piero Hincapié
  in the coming hours after the Ecuador defender completed his medical
  yesterday. He will become Arsenal’s eighth signing of the summer after a deal
  was struck on Friday with Bayer Leverkusen to sign the 23-year-old on an
  initial loan, with an option to make the Ecuador defender’s move permanent
  next summer for €52m (£45m). Mikel Arteta’s side have already spent more than
  £250m on new players in this transfer window and had to be careful not to
  exceed Uefa’s FFP regulations, hence the reason for structuring the deal in
  that way. His arrival should clear the way for Jakub Kiwior to complete his
  loan move to Porto with an obligation to buy next summer for up to €27m
  (£23.4m), while Arsenal are hoping to offload other fringe players before
  tonight’s deadline. Midfielder Albert Sambi Lokonga is close to joining
  Hamburg, who have also been in talks over a move for Fábio Vieira. Marseille
  have enquired about signing Oleksandr Zinchenko – although the Ukrainian’s
  wages could be a stumbling block –and Reiss Nelson has interest from Crystal
  Palace and Fulham. Not so long ago, Tariq Lamptey was deemed indispensable at
  Brighton but the full-back has just departed for Fiorentina. Lamptey, who
  spent five-and-a-half years at Brighton, joins the Serie A club on a permanent
  deal after falling down the pecking order under Fabian Hürzeler. The
  24-year-old joined from Chelsea in January 2020 and made 122 appearances for
  Brighton, scoring five goals and contributing 12 assists. In other
  full-backs-to-Italy news, last night Roma sealed a loan move for Liverpool
  left-back Kostas Tsimikas. “Fascinating as it is watching Premier League teams
  chucking the GDP of a small central American country on a new forward, what
  the hell is happening with Josh Sargent, the Norwich City optimism barometer?”
  asks Phil Withall. If reports are to believed, Sunderland could make a late
  swoop for Sargent, who is currently the Championship’s top scorer this season
  with five goals. Bournemouth have signed the Milan full-back Álex Jiménez on
  loan with an obligation to make the move permanent. The 20-year-old, who is a
  product of Real Madrid’s academy, provides a versatile option for Andoni
  Iraola. Jiménez becomes Bournemouth’s sixth summer signing and the fourth
  defensive addition, following left-back Adrien Truffert, centre-back Bafode
  Diakité and goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic. The club has gone through a defensive
  rebuild after the exits of Dean Huijsen, Milos Kerkez and Illia Zabarnyi this
  summer plus the end of Kepa Arrizabalaga’s loan spell. The Cherries are still
  in the market before the 7pm (BST) deadline. West Ham’s hunt for a defender on
  loan has seen them ask Chelsea about a deal for Axel Disasi. The Frenchman,
  who can play at centre-back and right-back and spent last season with Aston
  Villa, has also been targeted by Bournemouth and Crystal Palace in recent
  weeks. Crystal Palace are in talks with Brighton over a loan deal for defender
  Igor Julio and look set to sign Nigeria midfielder Christantus Uche for €20m
  (£17.3m) from Getafe on what is set to be a frantic deadline day for the FA
  Cup winners. The arrival of France Under-20 defender Jaydee Canvot is also
  expected to be confirmed on Monday after he completed his medical over the
  weekend, with Palace to pay Toulouse £23m for the 19-year-old. Any prospect of
  Palce allowing Marc Guéhi to depart for Liverpool rests on them finding a more
  experienced replacement. Attempts to sign Manuel Akanji from Manchester City
  and Monaco’s Mohammed Salisu have come to nothing, so Palace have now sounded
  out their arch-rivals over a potential deal for Igor. The 27-year-old only
  started 10 Premier League games under Fabian Hürzeler last season and has yet
  to feature this season. He is also believed to have interest from West Ham.
  The expected arrival of Uche, who had been lined up for a move to Wolves but
  failed to agree personal terms, will be a welcome boost for Oliver Glasner.
  Capable of playing in central midfield or in a more advanced role, the
  22-year-old who joined Getafe in January 2024 and received his first senior
  call-up for Nigeria in May should help to bolster Palace’s squad after the
  departure of Eberechi Eze. Everton are attempting to sign Freiburg central
  midfielder Merlin Rohl in a deal that could cost €20m (£17.3m). The
  23-year-old is a Germany Under-21 international and is expected on Merseyside
  today to discuss terms. David Moyes is also keen to strengthen in defence
  today – a new right-back has been needed for quite some time now – and could
  offload striker Youssef Chermiti to Rangers for around £8m. Aston Villa are in
  discussions with Manchester United over a deal for Jadon Sancho. The winger is
  out of favour at Old Trafford but has admirers at Villa Park. The structure of
  the proposal is unclear, with Villa thought to be pursuing a loan move. Sancho
  spent last season on loan at Chelsea and has not played for United in more
  than 12 months. Interestingly, the 25-year-old rejected a move to Roma, which
  triggered the Serie A club signing Leon Bailey on loan from Villa earlier this
  window. And then there is Emi Martínez, who was omitted from Villa’s squad on
  Sunday amid interest from United. Martínez is keen on the move but Villa will
  only sanction a sale if they get a replacement and the right price. We have an
  early done deal from the EFL: Leyton Orient have signed 20-year-old
  Southampton striker Dom Ballard on a three-year deal. Is he any relation to
  Sunderland centre-back Dan Ballard? No, he isn’t. As for news of Premier
  League deadline-day surprises, the hits just keep on coming … Away from the
  Isak business, Liverpool could raise more funds on deadline day by selling
  Harvey Elliott and Joe Gomez. Aston Villa have emerged as a potential
  destination for Elliott, whose first-team chances are likely to be squeezed
  further by Isak’s arrival, but they might need to sell Emi Buendía first.
  Milan made a €15m offer for Gomez on Sunday night but, with complications
  arising in Liverpool’s pursuit of Marc Guéhi, the Premier League champions
  would be reluctant to sell the versatile defender at this stage. Nicolas
  Jackson is a target for Newcastle as a replacement for Liverpool-bound
  Alexander Isak. Chelsea are open to selling the striker despite calling off a
  proposed loan move to Bayern Munich after Liam Delap suffered a hamstring
  injury against Fulham. Work is being done to see if a move to the north-east
  is possible for Jackson. Newcastle have also looked at Brentford’s Yoane Wissa
  and the Wolves forward Jørgen Strand Larsen. If Jackson does go, I wouldn’t be
  surprised to see Chelsea pull another rabbit out of the hat in terms of a late
  arrival. There could be departures today too. Tyrique George could be heading
  to Roma, and Chelsea need to find moves for Raheem Sterling, Ben Chilwell and
  Axel Disasi. Here’s a roundup of all the deadline-day transfer chat: “Was
  Vinny Samways ‘tough-tackling’? I always remembered him as more a cultured
  midfielder,” writes Andrew Champney. One deadline day not dominated by Vinny
  Samways, all I ask. Will never happen. But did you know he spent six years at
  Las Palmas? Nice work if you can get it. Manchester City have agreed the €14m
  transfer of Ederson to Fenerbahce but the deal is dependent on signing
  Gianluigi Donnarumma from Paris Saint-Germain for around €35m, or another
  elite goalkeeper as his replacement. A deal is understood to be in place
  regarding Ederson’s move to the Turkish club but City are intent on securing
  Donnarumma’s arrival first. If the Italian cannot be secured the Brazilian
  will not be sold unless another top-class keeper can be signed. As the window
  closes at 7pm on Monday this may be unlikely. Ederson, who is 32 and has a
  year left on his contract, has become unsettled at City while Donnarumma has
  been deemed surplus to requirements by Luis Enrique at PSG, the Spaniard
  signing Lille’s Lucas Chevalier last month to be his new No 1. Ederson has
  been City’s first-choice keeper since signing in summer 2017 from Benfica. He
  has won six Premier Leagues, two FA Cups, four League Cups, the Champions
  League, Uefa Super Cup and Club World Cup. The Brazilian was a key member of
  City’s 2022-23 treble triumph. Sunderland have agreed a fee of around £20m
  with Ajax for Brian Brobbey. The 23-year-old Netherlands striker is on a
  flight to Newcastle from Amsterdam and will have a medical later this morning.
  On Sunday evening, Sunderland agreed to a request from Chelsea to recall their
  loanee striker Marc Guiu to Stamford Bridge in the wake of Liam Delap’s
  injury. Brobbey will become Sunderland’s 13th signing of a very busy summer.
  Burnley are set to complete the signing of midfielder Florentino Luís from
  Benfica on an initial loan deal. The Clarets will pay €2m (£1.7m) upfront with
  a €24m (£20.8m) obligation to buy next summer. Luís has attracted interest
  from Premier League clubs in the past but will finally get the chance to play
  in England with Burnley. He will undergo a medical later today before
  finalising his move to Turf Moor. “I might be late to the party on this one
  but I’ve just spotted David Moyes and the tough-tackling Vinny Samways having
  a sandwich together in a trendy Lytham cafe,” reports Darrien Bold. “Rumours
  of a cool £2m swoop from Everton doing the rounds in these parts.” Some early
  news involving a couple of big Premier League clubs: Chelsea are poised to
  recall Marc Guiu from his Sunderland loan, as cover for Liam Delap’s injury.
  That could reopen the door for Nicolas Jackson to join Bayern Munich; the
  Bundesliga giants have been pondering other options, including Atalanta’s
  Ademola Lookman – who is also on Tottenham’s radar. Meanwhile, Antony looks to
  be leaving Manchester United for good, with the striker set to get his wish
  and rejoin Real Betis on a permanent deal worth £21.7m – around a quarter of
  the fee United paid Ajax to sign him in 2022. Before the madness begins today,
  you can catch up with all the big summer deals – more than 1,500 of them –
  with our interactive guide. More on this morning’s big news, here: Hello.
  Around £6bn (SIX BILLION POUNDS) has been spent this summer across Europe’s
  “big five” leagues – with close to 50% of that figure spent in the Premier
  League alone. It has been – even by modern football standards – a transfer
  window of extraordinary excess, and it’s not over yet. The biggest saga of the
  summer is yet to fully play out, but it looks like Liverpool will finally get
  their man after agreeing a £125m fee for Alexander Isak late last night. Do
  the Premier League leaders even need him? And will Crystal Palace defender
  Marc Guéhi follow Isak through the Anfield entrance later today? Other loose
  ends to be tied up: will Yoane Wissa get his Newcastle move, and/or will the
  Magpies swoop for Wolves’ Jorgen Strand Larsen or Roma’s Artem Dovbyk? Could
  Manchester City hit the panic button and draft in Gianluigi Donnarumma and
  Rodrygo? And will United make their move for Emiliano Martínez, Senne Lammens
  or A.N. Other to cover their goalposts? All will be revealed before the 7pm
  (BST) deadline, apart from those deals which are inexplicably allowed to
  rumble on for another two hours afterwards. Here we go!

David Flynn gets in touch: “Maybe Pep has analysed the current state of football and decided that he must evolve into what I’m choosing to call his Jack Charlton period. I look forward to Donnarumma, with a big hoof straight from the hands, up to Haaland.” Yes, at last Pep may see the error of his ways, and throw all those medal’s he’s won in the bin.

I realize this is a niche reason, but I’m really hoping that City get that transfer over the line.” It is suggested by Fabrizio Romano that another potential Fulham arrival is Raheem Sterling. Let’s see. Sterling is one of three Chelsea players with no future at the club but time left on his contract. The two others coming to mind are Ben Chilwell and Axel Disasi. Will Chelsea pay them out and leave them as free agents? Unclear at the moment. Brentford have agreed a deal to sign Arsenal’s Reiss Nelson on loan for the season and are still hoping to add more reinforcements to their squad today after allowing Yoane Wissa to join Newcastle. Crystal Palace, Besiktas and Fulham - where Nelson spent last year on loan - had also held talks over a move for the 25-year-old who came through Arsenal’s academy but he will now join Keith Andrews’ side instead and is set for a medical this afternoon. Brentford are understood to have cooled their interest in Borussia Dortmund’s Max Beier after seeing a £45m bid rejected last week, while PSV Eindhoven have also turned down a £25m offer for Joey Veermen over the weekend. Meanwhile, Fulham are moving closer to securing a club record £34m deal to sign Shakhtar Donetsk’s Kevin, while Milan’s Samuel Chukwueze could also arrive on an initial loan before the transfer deadline. On the subject of Arsenal, who are presumably spent up now. “The mentality is always to go forward, to be attacking, to be aggressive, to try to dominate the game and create chances,” Merino said. “But sometimes the game of football is like this. Sometimes the ball puts you in a certain situation. You have to adapt to it. John Culley gets in touch: “Although Arsenal have bought early and often in this window, looks like Arteta needs three players for each position if they are going to get injured at this rate. Kiwior has been a good squad player for the last couple of seasons, wish him well with his move to Porto, and hope the new signing Hincapie has ligaments of iron to deal with whatever is causing our injury curse.” Manchester United fans, getting excited about the “new Courtois”? The new Simon Mignolet would do at the moment – the old one is still playing well for Brugge, as it happens. Martínez would be a good buy, too, experienced like a Van Der Sar purchase but that’s not how modern transfers work, is it? Where will Martínez go? Senne Lammens is on his way to Manchester so it appears the 23-year-old will join Ruben Amorin’s squad. United deal for Lammens is €21m plus add ons - there is no sell on; 5-year contract. The player, who is travelling to Manchester, is viewed as an exciting young goalkeeper with a bright future. Utd considered other GKs (Emiliano Martínez), but ended plumping for the Belgian. James Kell gets in touch: “As a Newcastle fan, been both “victim” and beneficiary of this trend for players to down tools to force a move, which I really don’t enjoy, and I must say, in an era of grasping agents and prima donnas, hats off to Marc Guehi for not just continuing to turn out for Palace but for being outstanding for them and being a captain and leader. Top pro, top man, that’s how you do it.” Edward Ricketts gets in touch: “Hard to fathom how Donnarumma is suddenly second choice at PSG, having played a massive role in their Champions League triumph last season and having been arguably the best keeper in the world during that time. Utterly ruthless from Enrique and undoubtedly a coup for City. Any thoughts?” Not sure it’s a question being second choice though the writing was on the wall was Lucas Chevalier came in. Luis Enrique has overhauled the squad with Luis Campos and Donnarumma was signed by a different regime, and as part of the Mino Raiola agency, now run after his death by Rafaela Pimenta, such players are often on the move because of high demands for their players. Erling Haaland is one of their clients, of course, so City have a business relationship. The odd thing is Luis Enrique wants a progressive keeper who can play from the back and yet Pep, from the same school of thinking, is prepared to deal with a keeper from the Francesco Toldo/Gianluigi Buffon school of shot-stopping. Kieran McKintosh gets in touch: “Morning John. Watched last night’s game with my best friend, a Palace fan. Absolutely excruciating way to lose, but what can you do? “We wondered after if Glasner could walk. He’s not very impressed with transfer business and a manager like him will have his pick of the clubs if he does decide to go. I am no longer convinced Arteta is up to the job, so do you reckon Oliver Glasner would be a good candidate as the next manager of Arsenal (if you think it will get to that point? “ Made a prediction that Glasner will be in charge of Bayern this time next year. He’ll have plenty of takers. Could see him at Arsenal, United, City, any of them. His stock could not be higher. Maybe he might fancy winning the Conference League and signing off. He’s a patient man but always truthful in press conferences, he’s friendly but not afraid of speaking his mind. He’s almost too adult for the football game. He can also make a team play 3-4-3, which is beyond certain other managers. Nathan Patterson’s proposed move from Everton to Sevilla appears to be off. The Scotland international had been in talks over a season loan as he attempts to revive an injury-hit career. But with Sevilla right back Juanlu Sanchez looking likely to remain at the club - Napoli were interested - that avenue now looks closed. Harrison Armstrong, the promising 18-year-old midfielder, could depart on loan depending on whether Everton strengthen in that department first. The club are currently in talks with Freiburg’s Merlin Rohl. Everton have received several offers for Armstrong and another homegrown midfielder, Tyler Onyango, is also set to leave on loan today. Nottingham Forest are pushing to sign the Strasbourg winger Dilane Bakwa, with left-back Cuiabano also primed to join from Botafogo before the deadline. Forest are targeting a couple of additions, while two or three fringe players could depart. Strasbourg, part of the BlueCo group that own Chelsea, rejected a £30m bid from Forest for Bakwa earlier this window, with the Ligue 1 club wanting closer to £35m. Nuno Espírito Santo is to hold talks with Evangelos Marinakis over his future in the coming days after a rift with Edu, the global head of football at Marinakis’s stable of clubs. Nuno conceded Sunday’s collapse in the 3-0 home defeat to West Ham hardly strengthens his hand. Beginning to worry about Brentford. An awful lot of pressure on Kevin Schade, who missed a penalty at the weekend. At least Igor Jesus is in the goals. Wissa’s exit would be the second major sale at Brentford this window, with Bryan Mbeumo joining Manchester United for an initial £65m. Last summer Brentford sold Ivan Toney to Al-Ahli in a £40m deal. Brentford have seen several high-profile departures this summer, with Thomas Frank leaving to become Tottenham manager and former club captain Christian Nørgaard signing for Arsenal. Brentford broke their transfer record to land Dango Ouattara from Bournemouth in a £42.5m deal. Will they make moves before the end of today? They surely must. Wissa gets his wish. Seems like refusing to play is the way to get a move these days. That doesn’t sit right, but this is where we are now. Our story on Ten Hag, another fallen victim to the enduring curse of Manchester United. Dan King, Villa fans gets in touch: “As a Villa fan the Sancho signing smacks of panic. If we can afford him, why not Jack Grealish? If Sancho gets his head down, works hard and acts professionally then he has the talent to succeed. Unfortunately he has a strong reputation for not getting his head down, not working hard and acting unprofessionally. It’s got bad news written all over it. But then I felt the same about Marcus Rashford, about whom there were also questions about his attitude, and he was great for us.” I saw Grealish play on Saturday for Everton, and he was fantastic. The Villa Grealish, you’d much rather have than Sancho. Good morning, and welcome. Anything can happen from here. Well, sort of. Seems like the moves we have discussed all summer are coming to fruition. Goalkeepers seem the order of the day, with Donnarumma set for City, it seems, and Manchester United’s need to sign one, if not two, keepers. Righto, that’s it from me; here’s John Brewin to guide you through the next bit. Back to Palace, can they really sell Guéhi? He’s available for free in the summer, but what message does it send to Glasner if they do? He was very clear last evening in stating how crucial it is that he remains. “With Ten Hag’s sacking following Mourinho’s and Solskjær’s a few days ago,” begins Dean Haigh, “it’s perhaps telling that Manchester United managers seem to really struggle after leaving while players seem to go from strength to strength. It suggests that despite Amorim constantly denigrating his players it is, and always has been, the managers who’ve been the problem.” There’s a lot of blame to go around, so no need to be sparing, and I also think it’s fair to say that lots of players have left and still been poor. I’d still say the majority of the aggravation is on account of the Glazers, but agree the managers haven’t been good enough. AC Milan are trying to sign Joe Gomez, but Liverpool will only allow that if they succeed in snatching Marc Guéhi from Palace. On which point, what a shame it is to see Oliver Glasner’s FA Cup winners plundered in this manner – there’d have been a very serious side there if they’d only been able to buy rather than sell. Vill are, it seems, also interested in Harvey Elliott, a move that makes a lot more sense – and is a goodun for the player, too. He’s got his league-winners medal having contributed, and now he has to play regularly. Forcing his way into Emery’s midfield won’t be easy, though. Sancho loan to Villa nearly done: 80% wages to be paid by Villa along with bonuses that should happen, Utd believe, to have 100% covered. Imagine how James Trafford must be feeling. Leave City to play, prove yourself, reject other offers to re-sign, have the club pursue a Champions League-winner to go ahead of you. I can’t lie, it freaks my nut that any top-half Premier League manager, never mind Unai Emery, wants Sancho. He’s got such a lovely touch and imagination, but sadly lacks the physicality to succeed in England, while there are also questions about his mentality. It’s hard to see this one working. Today’s Rumour Mill: How much of his wages they cover will depend on how many games he plays and so on. “Bemused at Manchester United apparently believing a 32-year-old keeper isn’t a ‘long term option’,” writes Paul McGrory. “Isn’t there anyone there who remembers signing Edwin van der Sar when he was turning 35 in October? I believe he was decent for a few months at least.” In fairness, he did have the advantage of being decent previously, but yes, I agree 32 is fine for a keeper. Martínez has, though, been poor in recent times, even if that still makes him several orders of magnitude better than Altay Bayindir and André Onana, but might just have the self-regard to succeed under the Old Trafford spotlight. Goodness me, that’ll be a sore one. Leverkusen have drawn one and lost one of their two Bundesliga games so far. Villa are also poised to sign Victor Lindelöf but, as he is a free agent after leaving United, they are not under pressure to get that deal done. Aston Villa are gearing up for an extremely busy day. As well as a move for Jadon Sancho, they are keen on a deal for Liverpool’s Harvey Elliott. Unai Emery wants attacking reinforcements after another flat performance in defeat on Sunday. Villa sold Jacob Ramsey to Newcastle this month and saw a recent inquiry for Lucas Paquetà dismissed by West Ham. Marco Asensio, who joined Villa on loan last season and someone greatly admired by Emery, has signed for Fenerbahce. As the Villa manager conceded after defeat to Crystal Palace, they also need to ‘fix’ the Emi Martínez-shaped problem. Martínez wants to leave for Manchester United. For what it’s worth, a Brentford-supporting mate of mine doesn’t rate Wissa, and £55m does seem steep. But the Bees must now act quickly to replace him because having lost him, Bryan Mbeumo, Christian Norgaard, Mark Flekken – and Thomas Frank – they find themselves 15th in the league, perhaps in danger of a relegation struggle. Newcastle have their other new forward. Thanks Niall and hi everyone. There’s a man in a Sky Sports coat stood outside the Newcastle training ground, talking about things entirely unaffected by his location. Let’s get on with it! Time for me to hand over to my esteemed colleague, Daniel Harris. Don’t forget you can track all the latest deals with our interactive guide. Manchester United are intent on signing either Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp or Emiliano Martínez from Aston Villa to strengthen Ruben Amorim’s goalkeeping options before the close of the transfer window. United are thought to prefer Lammens due to his age (23) and price (£17m); Martínez turns 32 on Tuesday, could cost £35m and is not viewed as a long-term option. But with Villa showing interest in Jadon Sancho, a deal could be done for the World Cup winner that sees Sancho used as a makeweight. Arsenal are expected to announce the signing of Piero Hincapié in the coming hours after the Ecuador defender completed his medical yesterday. He will become Arsenal’s eighth signing of the summer after a deal was struck on Friday with Bayer Leverkusen to sign the 23-year-old on an initial loan, with an option to make the Ecuador defender’s move permanent next summer for €52m (£45m). Mikel Arteta’s side have already spent more than £250m on new players in this transfer window and had to be careful not to exceed Uefa’s FFP regulations, hence the reason for structuring the deal in that way. His arrival should clear the way for Jakub Kiwior to complete his loan move to Porto with an obligation to buy next summer for up to €27m (£23.4m), while Arsenal are hoping to offload other fringe players before tonight’s deadline. Midfielder Albert Sambi Lokonga is close to joining Hamburg, who have also been in talks over a move for Fábio Vieira. Marseille have enquired about signing Oleksandr Zinchenko – although the Ukrainian’s wages could be a stumbling block –and Reiss Nelson has interest from Crystal Palace and Fulham. Not so long ago, Tariq Lamptey was deemed indispensable at Brighton but the full-back has just departed for Fiorentina. Lamptey, who spent five-and-a-half years at Brighton, joins the Serie A club on a permanent deal after falling down the pecking order under Fabian Hürzeler. The 24-year-old joined from Chelsea in January 2020 and made 122 appearances for Brighton, scoring five goals and contributing 12 assists. In other full-backs-to-Italy news, last night Roma sealed a loan move for Liverpool left-back Kostas Tsimikas. “Fascinating as it is watching Premier League teams chucking the GDP of a small central American country on a new forward, what the hell is happening with Josh Sargent, the Norwich City optimism barometer?” asks Phil Withall. If reports are to believed, Sunderland could make a late swoop for Sargent, who is currently the Championship’s top scorer this season with five goals. Bournemouth have signed the Milan full-back Álex Jiménez on loan with an obligation to make the move permanent. The 20-year-old, who is a product of Real Madrid’s academy, provides a versatile option for Andoni Iraola. Jiménez becomes Bournemouth’s sixth summer signing and the fourth defensive addition, following left-back Adrien Truffert, centre-back Bafode Diakité and goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic. The club has gone through a defensive rebuild after the exits of Dean Huijsen, Milos Kerkez and Illia Zabarnyi this summer plus the end of Kepa Arrizabalaga’s loan spell. The Cherries are still in the market before the 7pm (BST) deadline. West Ham’s hunt for a defender on loan has seen them ask Chelsea about a deal for Axel Disasi. The Frenchman, who can play at centre-back and right-back and spent last season with Aston Villa, has also been targeted by Bournemouth and Crystal Palace in recent weeks. Crystal Palace are in talks with Brighton over a loan deal for defender Igor Julio and look set to sign Nigeria midfielder Christantus Uche for €20m (£17.3m) from Getafe on what is set to be a frantic deadline day for the FA Cup winners. The arrival of France Under-20 defender Jaydee Canvot is also expected to be confirmed on Monday after he completed his medical over the weekend, with Palace to pay Toulouse £23m for the 19-year-old. Any prospect of Palce allowing Marc Guéhi to depart for Liverpool rests on them finding a more experienced replacement. Attempts to sign Manuel Akanji from Manchester City and Monaco’s Mohammed Salisu have come to nothing, so Palace have now sounded out their arch-rivals over a potential deal for Igor. The 27-year-old only started 10 Premier League games under Fabian Hürzeler last season and has yet to feature this season. He is also believed to have interest from West Ham. The expected arrival of Uche, who had been lined up for a move to Wolves but failed to agree personal terms, will be a welcome boost for Oliver Glasner. Capable of playing in central midfield or in a more advanced role, the 22-year-old who joined Getafe in January 2024 and received his first senior call-up for Nigeria in May should help to bolster Palace’s squad after the departure of Eberechi Eze. Everton are attempting to sign Freiburg central midfielder Merlin Rohl in a deal that could cost €20m (£17.3m). The 23-year-old is a Germany Under-21 international and is expected on Merseyside today to discuss terms. David Moyes is also keen to strengthen in defence today – a new right-back has been needed for quite some time now – and could offload striker Youssef Chermiti to Rangers for around £8m. Aston Villa are in discussions with Manchester United over a deal for Jadon Sancho. The winger is out of favour at Old Trafford but has admirers at Villa Park. The structure of the proposal is unclear, with Villa thought to be pursuing a loan move. Sancho spent last season on loan at Chelsea and has not played for United in more than 12 months. Interestingly, the 25-year-old rejected a move to Roma, which triggered the Serie A club signing Leon Bailey on loan from Villa earlier this window. And then there is Emi Martínez, who was omitted from Villa’s squad on Sunday amid interest from United. Martínez is keen on the move but Villa will only sanction a sale if they get a replacement and the right price. We have an early done deal from the EFL: Leyton Orient have signed 20-year-old Southampton striker Dom Ballard on a three-year deal. Is he any relation to Sunderland centre-back Dan Ballard? No, he isn’t. As for news of Premier League deadline-day surprises, the hits just keep on coming … Away from the Isak business, Liverpool could raise more funds on deadline day by selling Harvey Elliott and Joe Gomez. Aston Villa have emerged as a potential destination for Elliott, whose first-team chances are likely to be squeezed further by Isak’s arrival, but they might need to sell Emi Buendía first. Milan made a €15m offer for Gomez on Sunday night but, with complications arising in Liverpool’s pursuit of Marc Guéhi, the Premier League champions would be reluctant to sell the versatile defender at this stage. Nicolas Jackson is a target for Newcastle as a replacement for Liverpool-bound Alexander Isak. Chelsea are open to selling the striker despite calling off a proposed loan move to Bayern Munich after Liam Delap suffered a hamstring injury against Fulham. Work is being done to see if a move to the north-east is possible for Jackson. Newcastle have also looked at Brentford’s Yoane Wissa and the Wolves forward Jørgen Strand Larsen. If Jackson does go, I wouldn’t be surprised to see Chelsea pull another rabbit out of the hat in terms of a late arrival. There could be departures today too. Tyrique George could be heading to Roma, and Chelsea need to find moves for Raheem Sterling, Ben Chilwell and Axel Disasi. Here’s a roundup of all the deadline-day transfer chat: “Was Vinny Samways ‘tough-tackling’? I always remembered him as more a cultured midfielder,” writes Andrew Champney. One deadline day not dominated by Vinny Samways, all I ask. Will never happen. But did you know he spent six years at Las Palmas? Nice work if you can get it. Manchester City have agreed the €14m transfer of Ederson to Fenerbahce but the deal is dependent on signing Gianluigi Donnarumma from Paris Saint-Germain for around €35m, or another elite goalkeeper as his replacement. A deal is understood to be in place regarding Ederson’s move to the Turkish club but City are intent on securing Donnarumma’s arrival first. If the Italian cannot be secured the Brazilian will not be sold unless another top-class keeper can be signed. As the window closes at 7pm on Monday this may be unlikely. Ederson, who is 32 and has a year left on his contract, has become unsettled at City while Donnarumma has been deemed surplus to requirements by Luis Enrique at PSG, the Spaniard signing Lille’s Lucas Chevalier last month to be his new No 1. Ederson has been City’s first-choice keeper since signing in summer 2017 from Benfica. He has won six Premier Leagues, two FA Cups, four League Cups, the Champions League, Uefa Super Cup and Club World Cup. The Brazilian was a key member of City’s 2022-23 treble triumph. Sunderland have agreed a fee of around £20m with Ajax for Brian Brobbey. The 23-year-old Netherlands striker is on a flight to Newcastle from Amsterdam and will have a medical later this morning. On Sunday evening, Sunderland agreed to a request from Chelsea to recall their loanee striker Marc Guiu to Stamford Bridge in the wake of Liam Delap’s injury. Brobbey will become Sunderland’s 13th signing of a very busy summer. Burnley are set to complete the signing of midfielder Florentino Luís from Benfica on an initial loan deal. The Clarets will pay €2m (£1.7m) upfront with a €24m (£20.8m) obligation to buy next summer. Luís has attracted interest from Premier League clubs in the past but will finally get the chance to play in England with Burnley. He will undergo a medical later today before finalising his move to Turf Moor. “I might be late to the party on this one but I’ve just spotted David Moyes and the tough-tackling Vinny Samways having a sandwich together in a trendy Lytham cafe,” reports Darrien Bold. “Rumours of a cool £2m swoop from Everton doing the rounds in these parts.” Some early news involving a couple of big Premier League clubs: Chelsea are poised to recall Marc Guiu from his Sunderland loan, as cover for Liam Delap’s injury. That could reopen the door for Nicolas Jackson to join Bayern Munich; the Bundesliga giants have been pondering other options, including Atalanta’s Ademola Lookman – who is also on Tottenham’s radar. Meanwhile, Antony looks to be leaving Manchester United for good, with the striker set to get his wish and rejoin Real Betis on a permanent deal worth £21.7m – around a quarter of the fee United paid Ajax to sign him in 2022. Before the madness begins today, you can catch up with all the big summer deals – more than 1,500 of them – with our interactive guide. More on this morning’s big news, here: Hello. Around £6bn (SIX BILLION POUNDS) has been spent this summer across Europe’s “big five” leagues – with close to 50% of that figure spent in the Premier League alone. It has been – even by modern football standards – a transfer window of extraordinary excess, and it’s not over yet. The biggest saga of the summer is yet to fully play out, but it looks like Liverpool will finally get their man after agreeing a £125m fee for Alexander Isak late last night. Do the Premier League leaders even need him? And will Crystal Palace defender Marc Guéhi follow Isak through the Anfield entrance later today? Other loose ends to be tied up: will Yoane Wissa get his Newcastle move, and/or will the Magpies swoop for Wolves’ Jorgen Strand Larsen or Roma’s Artem Dovbyk? Could Manchester City hit the panic button and draft in Gianluigi Donnarumma and Rodrygo? And will United make their move for Emiliano Martínez, Senne Lammens or A.N. Other to cover their goalposts? All will be revealed before the 7pm (BST) deadline, apart from those deals which are inexplicably allowed to rumble on for another two hours afterwards. Here we go!
