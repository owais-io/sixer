  Australia Post suspends parcel deliveries to US on eve of Trump’s new import
  tariff scheme

  Australia Post has temporarily halted some postage to the United States and
  Puerto Rico, effective immediately and until further notice. The change is a
  response to President Donald Trump’s tariff regime and changes to customs
  rules for parcels. Until now, low-value packages en route to the US were
  subject to what’s known as “de minimis” treatment, which allowed parcels worth
  less than US$800 to enter the country duty-free. But Trump signed an executive
  order last month ending the de minimis treatment, effective on 29 August.
  Parcels will be subject to duties equivalent to the tariffs imposed on that
  country. Australian goods are subject to the baseline 10% tariff. Gifts under
  US$100, or about $150 Australian dollars, letters and documents are not
  affected by the change. The move is part of his broader tariff war and
  frustration with China, which Trump claims has undercut local manufacturing.
  Sign up: AU Breaking News email Australia Post, which is government-owned,
  said the temporary suspension would affect many customers, including those
  with business or retail accounts hoping to send packages through the postal
  network. Any postal goods sent to the US and Puerto Rico lodged on or after 26
  August will not be accepted until further notice, unless they fall under the
  exemptions. “We are disappointed we have had to take this action, however, due
  to the complex and rapidly evolving situation, a temporary partial suspension
  has been necessary to allow us to develop and implement a workable solution
  for our customers,” said Gary Starr, the executive general manager of parcel,
  post and e-commerce services at Australia Post. “Australia Post continues to
  work with US and Australian authorities and international postal partners to
  resume postal service to the US as a priority.” The agency said it was working
  with a third-party provider authorised by US customs to find a solution that
  would allow services to resume. Australia Post said those customers would be
  notified when the system was nearly finished so they can “be ready for when
  this solution goes live”. A spokesperson for the Australian government said
  the new US tariff rule was “disappointing and will only drive up costs for
  American families and small businesses”. “The Albanese Government will work
  with Australia Post to limit disruption for affected customers while they make
  adjustments to comply with new requirements,” they said. The shadow minister
  for small business, Tim Wilson, said it was “very concerning” and urged the
  ambassador to the US, Kevin Rudd, to lobby the White House and Congress to
  “make sure this relationship is sorted”. Other international postal services
  have taken similar moves. Japan and Switzerland have both paused shipments to
  the US. Trump called the shipping of duty-free parcels a “catastrophic
  loophole” in his order last month, saying it had allowed packages to “evade
  tariffs” and “funnel deadly synthetic opioids as well as other unsafe or
  below-market products that harm American workers and businesses” into the US.
  “The de minimis exemption has been abused, with shippers sending illicit
  fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, precursors, and paraphernalia into the
  United States in reliance on the lower security measures applied to de minimis
  shipments, killing Americans,” the order reads. “President Trump is delivering
  on his promise to ‘put an end’ to the ‘big scam’ of de minimis shipments
  killing Americans and hurting U.S. businesses.”
