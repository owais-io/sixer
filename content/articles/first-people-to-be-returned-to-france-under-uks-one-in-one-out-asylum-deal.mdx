  People who arrived in the UK on a small boat have been detained under Keir
  Starmer’s “one in, one out” deal for the first time and are expected to be
  returned to France within three weeks, the Home Office has said. Detentions
  began on Wednesday lunchtime as those identified in the Channel were held in
  immigration removal centres pending their removal. The UK would be expected to
  make referrals to France within three days, and the French authorities would
  be expected to respond within 14 days, officials said. A small proportion of
  people arriving on small boats will be selected for removal to France and, in
  return, Britain will accept an equal number of asylum seekers from France. The
  Home Office released footage of a group of men who were being assessed for
  possible removal. With their faces blurred, they were shown walking into a
  tent for medical assessment. A second film showed them being screened by
  Border Force staff. Questions remain over the treaty implementing the “one in,
  one out” agreement. Immigration lawyers say its confusingly worded terms could
  be challenged by anyone attempting to block their return to France. The
  charity that successfully challenged the previous government’s Rwanda plan
  said it was now examining whether it could launch a case against Labour’s
  “morally repugnant” policy. Steve Smith, the CEO of Care4Calais, said:
  “Channel crossings are driven by a lack of safe routes, and here we have the
  government claiming to be opening a very limited, safe route, but they are
  locking people up before it’s opened. These first detainees are being denied
  access to justice. “Lets be clear, however. This grubby deal is all about
  permanently denying people the right to sanctuary. Offering a safe route to
  one person who has a strong case to be offered protection, while denying
  somebody else, who may have an equally strong case, is abhorrent. It must be
  challenged, and we are keeping all our options open to do so.” The reciprocal
  scheme allowing asylum seekers with links to the UK has also begun. Applicants
  must satisfy the eligibility and suitability criteria, including uploading a
  passport or other identity documents as well as a recent photograph. Those
  selected will have to pass further stringent security checks and biometric
  controls, meaning that only those individuals whom the UK government has
  approved for entry will be allowed through the new route. People from war-torn
  and drought-hit countries such as Eritrea could be excluded from the scheme by
  the requirement for official documents, a charity has warned. A Refugee Legal
  Support spokesperson said: “This week in Calais, we spoke with many people
  from Eritrea and almost none of them have copies of their Eritrean passports
  because they were never able to obtain one. Eritrean nationals are the top
  nationality crossing the Channel in 2025; 86% of Eritrean asylum seekers
  receive a positive decision, but almost all will be excluded from this
  scheme.” As the one-in, one-out pilot scheme continues into its implementation
  phase, the Home Office is also launching a campaign warning people not to risk
  their money or their life, to be promoted in the coming days across multiple
  channels. The deal has been trumpeted by ministers as a “gamechanging” deal
  but Home Office sources said it would apply only to about 50 asylum seekers at
  first. Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, did not confirm how many people were
  being prepared to be returned to France and said the government would resist
  any legal challenges. “The transfers to immigration removal centres are under
  way as we speak, so we won’t provide operational details at this point that
  criminal gangs can simply use and exploit. “But no one should be in any doubt:
  anyone who arrives from now on is eligible for immediate detention and
  return,” she said. “It’s the beginning of the pilot and it will build as well
  over time, but we’re also clear that France is a safe country, so we will
  robustly defend against any legal challenge that people try.” A copy of the
  agreement was released on Tuesday as the prime minister comes under increasing
  pressure to stop boats carrying asylum seekers from crossing the Channel. The
  UK will pay the costs of transporting asylum seekers to and from France. The
  deal will have to be renewed by 11 June next year, and can be ended at a
  month’s notice by either side. If people have an outstanding claim for asylum,
  they cannot be removed, the deal says. France can reject a requested removal
  if it “considers that an individual would be a threat to public policy,
  internal security, public health or the international relations of any of the
  Schengen states”. So far in 2025, more than 25,000 people have arrived in the
  UK after crossing the Channel in small boats – a record for this point in the
  year since data began being collected in 2018. That is up 48% on the same time
  last year.
