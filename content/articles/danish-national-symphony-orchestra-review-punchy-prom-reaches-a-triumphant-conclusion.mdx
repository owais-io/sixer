  What do you pair with Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony? You might do worse than Anna
  Clyne’s The Years, a subtle meditation on the mystery of time set to words by
  Stephanie Fleischmann. Composed during the pandemic, its approachable mood of
  calm isolation survives a series of angsty intrusions to convey a message of
  quiet hopefulness. Like the Beethoven, it reaches a triumphant conclusion,
  though in Clyne’s case the victory is an eminently peaceful one. The Danish
  National Symphony Orchestra under chief conductor Fabio Luisi gave it a
  relaxed and sensitive reading, warm string tones cocooning vocal lines that
  rose and fell, rendered with impressive clarity by the Danish National Concert
  Choir. The musical language, faintly reminiscent of Tippett or Barber, was
  built on simple melodies that blossomed into tangy harmonic clusters.
  Oscillating voices, stalked by harsh orchestral interjections like wailing
  sirens, gave way to an expansive sunset glimpsed through a haze of strings and
  a tranquil, timeless conclusion. Less successful somehow was Bent Sørensen’s
  Evening Land, a 13-minute musical portrait that contrasted a pastoral
  childhood memory from the composer’s native Zealand in Denmark with the
  sensation 50 years later of standing on a balcony overlooking the bustle of
  Manhattan. The former was represented by wispy, folkish violin and oozy
  strings, the latter by restless syncopations and grating sand blocks, but the
  overall conceit was flimsy, and – a pensive oboe melody aside – there was
  little here that really stayed with you. There was plenty to admire in the
  Beethoven, not least the incisiveness of the 70 Danish singers who frequently
  sounded like a choir twice the size. The orchestra, too, was impressive,
  responding perceptively to the energetic Luisi who, conducting from memory,
  shaped the music with admirably clear intentions. The problem lay in the often
  hectic speeds, perhaps ill-considered for an auditorium as resonant as the
  Royal Albert Hall. The opening movement was punchy and thoroughly organic, but
  instrumental details in the scherzo were sometimes smudgy and the adagio felt
  occasionally perfunctory. It was left to the choir and a fine lineup of
  soloists to stir the emotions and steer the work to its irrepressible rousing
  conclusion. • Listen again on BBC Sounds until 12 October. The Proms continue
  until 13 September
