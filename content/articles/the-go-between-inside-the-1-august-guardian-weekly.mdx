  As this week’s issue of the Guardian Weekly went to press, a UN-backed monitor
  said famine was now unfolding in Gaza. That statement came less than 24 hours
  after Donald Trump acknowledged for the first time that there was “real
  starvation” and told Israel to allow “every ounce of food” into Gaza. This
  week’s big story, led by on-the-ground reporting by Gaza-based journalist
  Malak A Tantash, focuses on the limited pause in fighting by Israel to allow
  aid deliveries. The pictures of malnourished Palestinians that prompted Trump
  to speak out, along with this week’s UN conference on a peace settlement to
  end the war, will hopefully lead back to a negotiating table in Qatar. For our
  cover story, Nesrine Malik examines how this tiny Gulf state managed to
  position itself as the key player on the chessboard of international
  relations. Her in-depth essay goes back to the setting up of Al Jazeera in
  Doha in 1996 and its role in 2011’s Arab spring, the discovery of vast
  offshore gas deposits and how the emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, has
  leveraged his contacts and Qatar’s position in the Gulf to bolster the
  country’s own security. Get the Guardian Weekly delivered to your home address
