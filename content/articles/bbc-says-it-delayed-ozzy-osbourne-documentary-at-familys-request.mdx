  The BBC has revealed it delayed an hour-long documentary about Ozzy Osbourne
  at the last minute at the request of his family. The film about the musician’s
  final years was suddenly pulled from listings on Monday, with the corporation
  making no comment about the decision. Its scheduled screening was less than a
  month after Osbourne’s death. It was also less than three weeks after his
  wife, Sharon, and their children appeared before crowds in his home city of
  Birmingham. In a new statement, the corporation suggested the delay had come
  after a request from the musician’s family. “Our sympathies are with the
  Osbourne family at this difficult time,” a BBC spokesperson said. “We are
  respecting the family’s wishes to wait a bit longer before airing this very
  special film. The new [broadcast] date will be confirmed shortly.” The BBC had
  recently stated that the film would go ahead. Clare Sillery, head of
  commissioning for BBC Documentaries, said earlier this month that the film,
  Ozzy Osbourne: Coming Home, captured “family moments, humour, reflection and
  shows the enduring spirit that made Ozzy a global icon. We hope it brings
  comfort and joy to Ozzy’s fans and viewers as they remember and celebrate his
  extraordinary life”. The programme is not the only documentary in the offing
  about the life of the late star. Paramount+ has also made a feature-length
  film, Ozzy Osbourne: No Escape From Now, about his struggles since a serious
  fall in LA in 2019. It had been slated to run later this year. The BBC’s
  documentary had already been completely overhauled as Osbourne’s health
  deteriorated. It was originally envisaged as a much wider, 10-part series
  called Home to Roost, which followed Ozzy and Sharon’s attempt to restart
  their lives back in the UK. It has now been re-edited into a one-off film,
  showing Osbourne’s battling attempts to become strong enough to perform and
  his struggles with ill-health. Osbourne died last month, aged 76, just weeks
  after performing from a throne on stage at Villa Park. The singer had been
  diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in 2019. The BBC film includes interviews
  with Osbourne family members, including Sharon, Kelly and Jack. It had been
  due to air on BBC One on Monday night, but was removed from the schedule
  earlier in the day. The broadcaster initially stated it had been “moved in the
  schedules” and replaced it with an episode of Fake Or Fortune?
