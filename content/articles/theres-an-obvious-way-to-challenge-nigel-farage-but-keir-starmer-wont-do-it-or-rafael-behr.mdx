  So begins another chapter in the liberation struggle. Released from bondage to
  the EU, Britain finds itself subjugated to a more insidious foe. The border
  that should have been sealed is wide open. The foreign hordes are still
  coming, but their passage is no longer directed by bureaucrats from Brussels.
  This time, national emancipation depends on breaking the tyranny of human
  rights lawyers. That is the plot to Nigel Farage’s Brexit sequel, previewed on
  Tuesday in an airport hangar in Oxfordshire. The Reform UK leader laid out
  plans for “mass deportation” of migrants – all who arrive without permission,
  plus those who are here already and came by illicit channels. Tens of
  thousands will be targeted. There would be cash incentives for anyone
  volunteering to leave. Refusers would be rounded up, detained in camps and
  flown to their countries of origin or, if those places won’t have them, some
  other place. A remote island, maybe. The exchequer would remunerate receptive
  governments. If deportees face the likely prospect of torture or death on
  arrival, well, that would be unfortunate but not sufficient grounds to stop
  the flights. There would be no legal recourse to sanctuary because the UK
  would withdraw from international treaties and conventions that grant
  protection to refugees. The European court of human rights would have no say.
  The universal principles it upholds would be expunged from domestic statute,
  to be replaced by custom-made British rights. And in that category, there is
  only one entitlement Farage holds sacred – the freedom of the settled British
  population to live unmolested by the phantom multitude of foreign criminals
  posing as refugees. By calling his plan Operation Restoring Justice, Farage is
  hinting at future redress for the grievance, much aired in radical rightwing
  circles online, that police and courts operate “two-tier” policies with a
  systemic bias in favour of immigrants. The inference is that courts might be
  used as instruments of nationalist restitution, dismantling liberal
  multiculturalism, putting native-born Britons first. This is not an original
  programme. The last Conservative government passed several laws on the premise
  that the illegal traffic in boats across the Channel would be deterred by
  threats of detention and deportation. When it didn’t work, blame fell on
  European convention rights that prohibit sending people to unsafe places.
  Ministers legislated again, creating a statutory power for ministers to
  declare a country safe: Rwanda, specifically, regardless of evidence to the
  contrary. A bill to assert the primacy of British rights over European ones
  has been rattling around Tory policy cupboards for longer still. David Cameron
  pledged one ahead of the 2010 general election, and again in 2015. A version
  of it resurfaced under Boris Johnson, and even made it as far as a first
  reading in parliament in 2022, but no further. The problem each time has been
  the same. A bill that repudiated international treaties would signal Britain’s
  withdrawal from the community of reliable democracies, sabotaging diplomatic
  relations and burning alliances. No responsible prime minister would consider
  it. Even irresponsible ones have shied at the cost. That is no impediment to
  the Reform UK leader. He welcomes objections to his plans on the basis of what
  a law-abiding government should do because his offer to the electorate is
  wilful transgression and denial of consequence. When politicians whose methods
  are deemed to have failed say a plan is reckless, Farage’s audience hears a
  recommendation. Recklessness sounds like a virtue if it means the status quo
  is in jeopardy. The Reform plan doesn’t entirely ignore the logistics of
  implementation. There is a cost estimate of £10bn over five years, including
  £2.5bn for the construction of detention centres in as yet undetermined
  locations. The numbers are fictions, big enough to sound serious but small
  enough to be easily covered by some bogus revenue source in a future
  manifesto. Diplomatic obligations to honour treaties are swept aside with an
  invocation of national emergency. Public order is imperilled by uncontrolled
  migration, Farage says. Then he executes a rhetorical pivot from the
  undesirable character of those arriving by boat – “suspected of being involved
  in some form of terrorism” – to the prospect of unrest in communities where
  there is “rising anger” and “despair” at the influx of these marauding
  interlopers. His warnings are threats. His foreboding fans the flames. The
  call to arms is amplified by what used to be called the Tory press, but now
  treats Farage with deference as prime minister-in-waiting. There is a lot of
  presumption in that posture when the next general election doesn’t have to be
  held before summer 2029. Reform UK currently have four MPs, 316 seats short of
  a working majority. But not much about Farage’s candidacy fits the
  conventional template of party politics. By any measure of success except
  parliamentary representation and ministerial offices held, he is the most
  significant leader of his generation. No policy action of the 21st century
  matches Brexit in terms of consequence for Britain, nor even comes close.
  Boris Johnson can take credit for cajoling a majority to vote leave in 2016.
  David Cameron earns a place on the podium of shame for blundering into a
  referendum in the first place. But Farage’s agitation was the key. He set the
  goal, branded it “independence” and connected it to the high-voltage rail of
  anti-immigrant feeling. Whatever else leaving the EU was meant to achieve –
  autonomy in tariff rates, regulatory sovereignty, bendier bananas – border
  control was baked in as the test of a proper Brexit. Free movement had to end.
  That is why Theresa May ruled out single market membership before negotiations
  in Brussels had even started, and why Keir Starmer keeps it off the table.
  That taboo prevents the prime minister properly describing the economic cost
  of Brexit. It mutes any recognition of all the other dimensions of national
  self-harm involved in withdrawal from a continental trading bloc at what
  history will judge to be the worst possible moment to go chasing delusions of
  free-trading global grandeur. Starmer is stranded in a strategic cul-de-sac,
  managing a stagnant economy. He struggles to address the frustration and
  dismay of a demoralised electorate, while the principal author of their
  predicament rehearses the remake. There was a tactical case to avoid making
  the last general election a relitigation of Brexit. There are reasons still to
  choose words carefully when commenting on an issue that stirred strong
  emotions, not to belittle the hopes and expectations of leave voters or
  conflate their sincerity with the venal cynicism of campaigns that lied about
  what was on offer. But are we really going to spend the next four years
  watching Farage leaf casually through the familiar playbook, running the same
  campaign to the fawning applause of the same courtier commentariat? Is it too
  much to expect a Labour government to raise, by way of rebuttal, the Reform
  leader’s proven failure as an arbiter of the national interest? We tried
  listening to him. His probity and judgment were sold as the product called
  Brexit. It turned out to be a piece of shit. Enough people already know this
  is the truth, but it would be liberating to hear it from the prime minister.
