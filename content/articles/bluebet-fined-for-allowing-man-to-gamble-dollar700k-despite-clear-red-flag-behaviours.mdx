  A man who “binge gambled” $40,000 in an 11-hour session was awarded VIP status
  by the bookmaker BlueBet and assigned a dedicated personal manager who
  encouraged him to keep betting and took a cut of his losses. A regulator has
  found it wasn’t until the man had gambled $700,000 four months later and
  displayed multiple “clear red flag behaviours” that BlueBet checked whether he
  could afford to be betting so much. The Northern Territory Racing and Wagering
  Commission (NTRWC), which regulates most online gambling companies in
  Australia, described Bluebet’s conduct as “unacceptable” and “extremely
  concerning”. The regulator found that when the man complained about having run
  out of money to gamble, his VIP manager supplied him with bonus bets, deposit
  matches and placed funds directly into his account. Sign up: AU Breaking News
  email On one occasion, when the man’s request for an inducement was initially
  declined, he requested his account be closed. Within two minutes, the VIP
  manager had placed $500 of bonus bets into his account. The man had already
  lost $4,000 that day. A federal parliamentary inquiry, led by the late Labor
  MP Peta Murphy, called for inducements such as bonus bets to be banned. It
  warned they encouraged riskier bets, higher losses and undermined harm
  minimisation messages. BlueBet, according to the regulator, prioritised the
  retention of a profitable customer over its legislated “responsible gambling
  responsibilities”. It found no evidence the VIP manager had been trained in
  harm minimisation. “Instead of monitoring the situation and engaging in
  meaningful responsible gambling actions, BlueBet chose to award the
  complainant VIP status and assign a dedicated VIP account manager, whose
  commission was tied to the complainant’s net gambling revenue,” the NTRWC
  decision said. Bluebet told the regulator that it called the man for a
  “responsible gambling check-in” after he repeatedly failed to place bets on
  his credit card due to insufficient funds. But the regulator found this call,
  which went unanswered, was prompted, in part, by “payment processing issues”
  and not concern for his wellbeing. On the day after the phone call, the man
  continued gambling and requested bonus bets from his VIP manager. “At no stage
  did the account manager make mention that BlueBet was concerned about his
  wagering activities from a responsible gambling perspective,” the NTRWC
  decision said. “Rather, the VIP manager continued to encourage the complainant
  to wager with BlueBet through the promise of the provision of upcoming
  bonuses.” In the two weeks after the unanswered phone call, the man gambled
  close to $400,000 with BlueBet. Missed opportunities The man’s gambling
  account was eventually closed when he texted his manager to say he wished he
  “had been pulled up earlier by you guys” as he had lost everything. “Given the
  numerous earlier red flags, it is extremely concerning that it took the
  complainant himself reaching out to BlueBet for his account to be closed,” the
  decision said. “BlueBet missed multiple opportunities for timely and
  appropriate action and it’s disappointing that the responsibility fell on the
  complainant rather than BlueBet taking a more assertive role in protecting the
  complainant from further harm.” Despite finding Bluebet’s conduct to be
  extremely concerning, the bookmaker was fined $53,380, which is less than 10%
  of the $570,000 the man lost. This was the maximum penalty available to the
  commission. The Tasmanian independent MP Andrew Wilkie has previously called
  for financial penalties to be massively increased to ensure gambling companies
  are effectively punished for their misconduct. “It should be an amount that
  hurts the company financially and hurts them so much that they think,
  ‘heavens, we can’t afford that again’,” Wilkie said in 2023. “It should hurt
  them so much that shareholders say to the board, ‘that must not happen
  again’.” BlueBet merged with gambling company Betr earlier this year and no
  longer operates as a stand-alone brand. The conduct examined by the regulator
  took place during 2021. • In Australia, Gambling Help Online is available on
  1800 858 858. The National Debt Helpline is at 1800 007 007. In the UK,
  support for problem gambling can be found via the NHS National Problem
  Gambling Clinic on 020 7381 7722, or GamCare on 0808 8020 133. In the US, call
  the National Council on Problem Gambling at 800-GAMBLER or text 800GAM
