  Woody Allen has denied claims that his participation in a Moscow film festival
  was “whitewashing” Russian atrocities, after condemnation of his appearance by
  Ukraine’s ministry of foreign affairs. Allen said in a statement to the
  Guardian: “When it comes to the conflict in Ukraine, I believe strongly that
  Vladimir Putin is totally in the wrong. The war he has caused is appalling.
  But, whatever politicians have done, I don’t feel cutting off artistic
  conversations is ever a good way to help.” Allen had appeared on Sunday at
  Moscow international film week, via a remote link for a session hosted by
  film-maker Fyodor Bondarchuk, a long-term political ally of Putin and director
  of patriotic epics such as Stalingrad (2013) and the sci-fi film Attraction.
  In a statement posted on social media, the ministry said: “Woody Allen’s
  participation in the Moscow international film week is a disgrace and an
  insult to the sacrifice of Ukrainian actors and film-makers who have been
  killed or injured by Russian war criminals in their ongoing war against
  Ukraine.” It added: “By taking part in a festival that brings together Putin’s
  supporters and voices, Allen chooses to turn a blind eye to the atrocities
  Russia commits in Ukraine every single day for 11 years now. Culture must
  never be used to whitewash crimes or serve as a propaganda tool. We strongly
  condemn Woody Allen’s decision to bless Moscow’s bloody festival with his
  address.” According to reports in Russian media, Allen said that he had no
  plans to make a film in Russia but that he had “only good feelings for Moscow
  and St Petersburg”. Allen also reportedly said he admired Russian cinema,
  singling out the four-film literary adaptation War and Peace, directed by
  Bondarchuk’s father Sergei, which won the Oscar for best foreign language film
  in 1969. Allen’s last two films have been made with financial backing from
  European sources: Rifkin’s Festival in Spain, released in 2020, and Coup de
  Chance in France, released in 2023. This followed the cancellation of his
  production arrangement with Amazon in 2019; Allen sued Amazon and settled out
  of court. His legal dispute with Amazon followed an open letter published by
  Dylan Farrow in 2014 renewing the allegations that Allen had sexually abused
  her when she was seven, which Allen denies and of which he has been cleared
  after two investigations. In 2024, Allen suggested he may retire, saying: “All
  the romance of film-making is gone.”
