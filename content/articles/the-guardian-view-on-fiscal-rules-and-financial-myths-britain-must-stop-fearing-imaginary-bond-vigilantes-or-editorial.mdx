  In 1995, Nick Leeson, a 28-year-old trader for Barings Bank, brought down the
  City’s oldest finance house by, among other things, betting that the Bank of
  Japan (BoJ) couldn’t keep rates low forever after its financial crash led to a
  borrowing spree. The devastating Kobe earthquake was the final blow. The BoJ
  cut rates, bond prices rose and his losses spiralled to $1.4bn. His bet that
  markets would beat Japan brought down the bank. Barings’ collapse is perhaps a
  spectacular example of the “widowmaker” trade, where speculators think they
  can outsmart Japanese authorities. They’ve ended up with egg on their face as
  their gamble on Japan losing fiscal control proved misguided. Japan, with its
  own currency and a central bank working with the government, shows how the
  state shapes markets, not the other way round. Britain seems to have forgotten
  this lesson with talk of “bond vigilantes”. True, the UK is very different
  from Japan. But in economic terms there are similarities: both borrow in their
  own currency; both have floating exchange rates; both are net importers of
  food and fuel, leaving them vulnerable to imported inflation. Yet only one has
  built a resilient economic model around these facts. And it isn’t Britain.
  Sterling’s recent drop has made headlines. But its long-term value, as
  economist John T Harvey points out, is determined by foreign exchange trading.
  In the case of the pound and the yen, foreign exchange turnover exceeds trade
  by more than 100 times. However, interest rates, unemployment, inflation and
  trade flows are indicators that determine short-term currency prices
  disproportionately because whatever traders think is true becomes fact as it
  then moves the market. As George Soros noted, traders’ perceptions matter, and
  are driven less by facts than by whether the City regards the government as
  competent. That insight should liberate policy. The UK can and should run
  fiscal deficits to fund a green industrial strategy – investing in domestic
  manufacturing, energy security and a strong export base. Investing in
  industrial capacity and public goods strengthens the economy, helps reduce
  inequalities and reduces vulnerability over time. It would also address the
  UK’s persistent current account deficit. Britain imports more than it exports
  – and this deficit, by necessity of accounting, is offset by capital inflows,
  not because they fund government spending. The upshot is Japan is a net
  capital exporter, while the UK has become addicted to short-term inflows into
  property, financial instruments, and speculative assets – flows that can
  reverse sharply, as seen in the 2022 gilt crisis. Which brings us to Liz
  Truss. Her downfall wasn’t caused by borrowing per se, but by doing it for the
  wrong reasons. Sacking Treasury officials, bypassing institutional safeguards
  and promising unfunded tax cuts for the wealthy during a bout of high
  inflation showed not boldness, but a breakdown in basic statecraft. It wasn’t
  a macroeconomic crisis but a governance crisis. Rachel Reeves risks a
  different mistake: adopting fiscal rules to appease markets but that ignore
  reality. Rather than the self-imposed arbitrary constraints, which she already
  changed last October, the Labour party should be bold and get rid of them
  altogether. Better the budget features a short statement of how government
  plans will affect the economy – on trade, inflation and investment. It should
  be voters, not markets, who decide what’s credible. Do you have an opinion on
  the issues raised in this article? If you would like to submit a response of
