  “Nature loves to hide”, or so proclaimed the riddling ancient philosopher
  Heraclitus. These past few weeks, I’ve been on the lookout for the last of the
  season’s orchids – Spiranthes spiralis, or autumn lady’s tresses – and I’m
  starting to see what he meant. Today I’m crouched near the top of Wolstonbury
  Hill, eyes peeled. The place is certainly teeming: scabious and hawkbit dance
  with the dried-out grasses; bees hum and linnets chatter on a hawthorn. The
  orchids that I’m seeking grow from long-lived tubers, and I saw a handful in
  this precise location last summer, so I know they’re here. So far, though, no
  sign. I’m not necessarily too early: two weeks ago, on Newtimber Hill, just
  along the escarpment, I found several, and there’s a valley farther west where
  they’re blooming in conspicuous thousands. Still, just looking for these
  orchids is a perspective-shifting pleasure. They are plants of the grassland
  understorey, a world of snails, crickets, and creeping species such as
  eyebright and thyme. To spot them, I find it’s best to scan haphazardly,
  hoping for a small disturbance of grey-green stem. Close up, each plant is
  tipped with a braided spiral of tiny white flowers. Glittery and translucent,
  their petals form a narrow, almond-scented tunnel for visiting pollinators,
  its outer rim frilled like a lace bonnet. For today, I’m happy to call it
  quits. Being made to wait is a welcome reminder of the myriad factors that
  make a plant community. There are the constants – mild climate, chalk bedrock,
  centuries of grazing – all of which have shaped the characteristic,
  species-rich grasslands of the South Downs. Then, perhaps of most interest,
  there are variations at every scale. Each slope has differences of aspect,
  gradient and land-use history, every anthill a sunny and a shady side. These
  downs have lost over 90% of mature chalk grassland since the second world war,
  yet such numbers can’t tell the full story. Every grassland is different, a
  fractal mosaic of microhabitats. Over the years, I’ve counted 13 different
  orchid species on this hill, its thin, unimproved soils a sanctuary for these
  distinctive plants. For one, the man orchid, this is the only West Sussex
  site. To visit them, each in turn, is a small ritual of record and
  recognition. But nature makes the calendar. • Under the Changing Skies: The
