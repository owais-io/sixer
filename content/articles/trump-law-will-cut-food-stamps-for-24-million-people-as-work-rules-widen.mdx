  Republican-led cuts to public assistance programs – carried out at the behest
  of Donald Trump’s administration – will lead to 2.4 million fewer Americans
  receiving food stamps, among them families with children, the non-partisan
  congressional budget office (CBO) has found. The estimate, published Monday,
  forecast that the number of people receiving food stamp benefits in an average
  month would drop after Republican lawmakers expanded work requirements to some
  parents, older enrollees and others. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
  Program (Snap), formerly known as food stamps, in 2024 served an average of
  41.7 million people monthly, or 12.3% of the US population. Federal spending
  on the program amounts to almost $100bn, and benefits average $187.20 a month.
  But Trump’s congressional agenda bill, which the president signed into law in
  July, requires parents of dependent children to work for their food stamp
  benefits. The Snap program has long required certain able-bodied adults to
  work to receive benefits for longer than three months. But the bill broadened
  the requirement to parents of dependent children – requiring that those with
  kids ages 14 and older work, volunteer or participate in job training at least
  80 hours monthly. The bill – which places more responsibility for food
  programs and other benefits onto states – requires that adults ages 55 to 64,
  veterans, people experiencing homelessness and former foster care youth meet
  the mandate, though it exempts Native Americans, according to CNN. The CBO
  estimates that US households, on average, will see an increase in the
  resources available to them as a result of the bill – but “the changes in
  resources will not be evenly distributed among households”. Those who may lose
  SNAP benefits include 300,000 adults who live with children ages 14 and older,
  the CBO estimates. The agency said it “estimates that, in general, resources
  will decrease for households toward the bottom of the income distribution,
  whereas resources will increase for households in the middle and toward the
  top of the income distribution”. But the highest earners, with incomes of
  nearly $700,000, on average, will see a $13,600 jump in their incomes, or
  about 2.7%. Overall, middle-income Americans, who earn about $86,000 on
  average, will get an $800 increase in federal assistance overall while those
  who earn less than $24,000 will see their projected incomes drop by about
  $1,200 a year. The estimates come as the federal government is shifting costs
  of benefit programs onto states. “Hunger is a public health crisis, and Snap
  is one of the most effective tools we have to address it – reducing food
  insecurity, improving health outcomes, and lowering long-term health care
  costs,” the Food Research &amp; Action Center said recently, after the federal
  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) moved to restrict certain junk
  foods, including sodas and candy, from products that can be purchased with
  Snap benefits. “For years, Snap has used taxpayer dollars to fund soda and
  candy – products that fuel America’s diabetes and chronic disease epidemics,”
  HHS secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr said in a statement. But the Food Research
  &amp; Action Center said the Trump administration “needs to stop being the
  food police and start investing in real solutions”. “That means increasing
  Snap benefits, expanding access to affordable food, and scaling up
  evidence-based programs like fruit and vegetable incentives,” the group said.
