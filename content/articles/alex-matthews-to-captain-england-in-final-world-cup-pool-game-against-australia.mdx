  Alex Matthews will captain England for only the second time in her career in
  their final pool match of the Rugby World Cup against Australia, among one of
  12 changes made to the Red Roses’ starting XV. Jess Breach will win her 50th
  cap on the wing in Brighton and Holly Aitchison will potentially make her
  first appearance of the tournament from the replacements bench with a victory
  cementing a top of the pool finish. The Red Roses have already secured their
  quarter-final place. Matthews captained her country for the first time at the
  2024 WXV tournament against the USA and takes on the skipper duties once again
  on Saturday despite vice-captain Meg Jones retaining her starting shirt at
  outside centre. Regular captain Zoe Aldcroft is still injured, while Marlie
  Packer, who captained last week against Samoa, is not in the matchday squad.
  Breach, who took her try-scoring tally for England to 52 with a hat-trick
  against Samoa last time out, hits her milestone by retaining her wing shirt.
  The head coach, John Mitchell, said of Breach: “To reach 50 caps for your
  country is testament to the hard work and dedication put in over a number of
  years, not only by the individual but by those who support them daily. “Jess
  should be incredibly proud of her milestone and we’re looking forward to her
  taking to the field on Saturday.” Aitchison has been named among the
  replacements after missing the opening two games with an ankle injury. If the
  Sale Sharks player makes an appearance every single player in the Red Roses
  32-strong squad would have had tournament minutes before the knockout stage
  begins. Abby Dow comes back in on the wing and is one try away from hitting 50
  for England, while Ellie Kildunne rounds off the back three. Morwenna Talling
  starts at blindside flanker with Sadia Kabeya back at openside flanker and
  Maddie Feauanti starts from the bench. In the second row the lock pairing is
  Rosie Galligan and Abbie Ward. Mitchell added: “We want to build on our
  opening matches of the tournament and finish the pool stage with a good
  performance against Australia.” England Kildunne; Dow, Jones, Heard, Breach;
  Harrison, Hunt; Botterman, Cokayne, Muir, Galligan, Ward, Talling, Kabeya,
  Matthews (capt). Replacements Atkin-Davies, Clifford, Bern, Campion, Feaunati,
  L Packer, Aitchison, Rowland.
