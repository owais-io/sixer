  Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that he will host the Kennedy Center
  honors this year and said he had been heavily involved in choosing who to
  nominate, rejecting people he thought were too liberal. The US president named
  actor Sylvester Stallone, singer Gloria Gaynor, the rock band Kiss, country
  music star George Strait and actor and singer Michael Crawford among the first
  batch of Kennedy Center honors nominees since he took over as the
  Washington-based arts center’s chairman upon returning to the White House this
  year. The president typically attends the annual honors event each December
  but sits in the audience as a VIP and hosts a reception for awardees at the
  White House. Trump’s announcement that he will host the event is a break from
  tradition, although no details were released on what form that would take. His
  announcement continues his push to exert authority over US cultural
  institutions, such as the Smithsonian, and Democratic-led cities and came on
  the first full day that federalized national guard troops were on duty on the
  streets of Washington by order of the president. Trump has cited a crisis of
  crime and homelessness in the nation’s capital to sharp criticism from
  opponents. In an appearance at the arts center on Wednesday morning, Trump
  also said that he intends to “fully renovate” the entire infrastructure of the
  Kennedy Center to make it a “crown jewel” of arts and culture in the US.
  “We’re going to bring it to a higher level than it ever hit,” the president
  said, adding the venue would be featured in next year’s celebrations of the
  250th anniversary of the US founding. Trump said he had been invited to host
  the Kennedy Center honors and had reluctantly agreed. Trump avoided the
  Kennedy Center awards during his first term after artists said they would not
  attend out of protest. After taking over as the chairman this year he fired
  the board of trustees and replaced it with loyalists amid an overhaul of the
  venue’s offerings. In March, the producers of the rap musical Hamilton pulled
  out of staging their Broadway hit, citing Trump’s aggressive takeover of the
  institution’s leadership. In a Truth Social post on Tuesday, Trump had teased
  a name change for the center, formally the John F Kennedy Center for the
  Performing Arts, and said it would be restored to its past glory. “GREAT
  Nominees for the TRUMP/KENNEDY CENTER, whoops, I mean, KENNEDY CENTER,
  AWARDS,” Trump wrote. He said work was being done on the site that would bring
  it “back to the absolute TOP LEVEL of luxury, glamour, and entertainment”. “It
  had fallen on hard times, physically, BUT WILL SOON BE MAKING A MAJOR
  COMEBACK!!!” he wrote. He did not announce a name change during his appearance
  later on Wednesday. House Republicans added an amendment to a spending bill
  Trump signed into law in July to rename the Kennedy Center Opera House after
  Melania Trump, but that venue has yet to be renamed. Maria Shriver, a niece of
  the late President Kennedy, a Democrat, has criticized as “insane” a separate
  House proposal to rename the entire center after Trump. Trump said he was
  “about 98% involved” in choosing the honorees this year. He added that he
  “turned down plenty” of names, saying those individuals were “too woke” or too
  liberal. He described the artists he announced on Wednesday, including several
  of his favorites, as “great people”. Historically, a bipartisan advisory
  committee selects the recipients, who over the years have ranged from George
  Balanchine and Tom Hanks to Aretha Franklin, Joni Mitchell and Stephen
  Sondheim. In the past, Trump has floated the idea of granting Kennedy Center
  honors status to singer-songwriter Paul Anka and Stallone, one of three actors
  Trump named as Hollywood ambassadors earlier this year. Anka was supposed to
  perform My Way at Trump’s first inaugural ball and backed out at the last
  moment. The Kennedy Center honors were established in 1978 and have been given
  to a broad range of artists. The Associated Press contributed reporting
