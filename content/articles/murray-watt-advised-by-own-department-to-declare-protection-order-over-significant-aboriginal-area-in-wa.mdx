  The environment minister, Murray Watt, has been advised by his department to
  declare a protection order over part of the Burrup peninsula in Western
  Australia due to its significance as an Aboriginal site, a government
  affidavit filed in the federal court shows. A Murujuga traditional custodian,
  Raelene Cooper, applied in 2022 to protect the area’s cultural heritage from
  nearby industrial activities, including Woodside’s planned extension of its
  North West Shelf processing plant. Her court action sought an order that would
  force the federal government to make a decision in her application under
  section 10 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection
  Act. Sign up: AU Breaking News email On Monday afternoon, the court found the
  government’s delay in determining Cooper’s application was unreasonable and
  had not been adequately explained, according to a summary of the judgment.
  However, because the minister had demonstrated an “appropriate level of
  commitment” to progressing the application and reaching a decision in coming
  weeks, the court did not order the government to make a decision by 12
  September, as requested by Cooper. Cooper has been given liberty to return to
  court for further relief if a decision is not made by 12 September and the
  government was ordered to pay her costs “given the finding of unreasonable
  delay, and because the fact of this proceeding has led to the Minister’s
  decision now being imminent”. “After three and a half years of waiting for
  this process, I am relieved that the federal court has found the delays have
  been unreasonable,” Cooper said in a statement. “I am also relieved to hear
  that the department has finally recommended that the minister makes a section
  10 Declaration for protection of Murujuga.” Cooper said she had sought further
  information from the federal environment department “to help understand the
  nature of the protections they are recommending, and which areas will be
  affected”. “It is deeply regrettable, and breaks my heart to know that many of
  the sites I tried to protect with the section 10 application have already been
  damaged or destroyed while this process has been under way,” she said. Cooper
  filed the application for protection due to concern about the impact of
  industrial activities on the Murujuga cultural landscape, including its
  globally significant collection of rock art, which was placed on the world
  heritage list last month. A redacted version of an affidavit filed by the
  minister last week, and released by the court to Guardian Australia, shows
  that the environment department has recommended Watt make a section 10
  declaration over part of the site. A brief provided to the minister last week
  shows the department advised Watt he could be satisfied “the specified area is
  a significant Aboriginal area” for the purposes of section 10 of the act and
  “is under threat of injury or desecration”. The proposed order “would contain
  prohibitions and restrictions for the protection and preservation of the
  proposed declared area from injury or desecration”, according to emails sent
  by the department last Tuesday to affected parties including Cooper and her
  legal team, Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation, the WA government, Woodside and
  the chemical companies Perdaman and Yara. The area the proposed declaration
  would apply to and the associated “prohibitions and restrictions” have been
  redacted, meaning it is unclear whether and to what extent any declaration
  would affect industrial activities at the site. Emails sent by the department
  show the government is seeking comments from the affected parties and has
  asked them to meet officials this week before Watt makes a final decision.
  Cooper said she had met with the department earlier on Monday, with another
  meeting scheduled for this Thursday on Murujuga. Watt declined to comment on
  the department’s advice while the matter remained before the federal court. A
  Woodside spokesperson said section 10 declarations were a matter for the
  federal government and declined to comment. Watt announced in May he had given
  the company’s North West Shelf extension provisional approval but a final
  decision is yet to be made.
