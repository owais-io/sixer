  The chief executive of Ofwat is to step down at the end of the month, after
  the government announced the abolition of the water regulator for England and
  Wales. David Black has been in the role for four years, and will leave amid
  intense scrutiny of water companies and their regulators. Ofwat said the
  government will appoint a new interim chief executive before its abolition.
  The regulation of the English and Welsh water industry has become a key
  political issue in recent years, including during last year’s general
  election, amid a wave of anger over sewage spilling into Britain’s rivers and
  seas. Black’s decision comes as the government and the environment secretary,
  Steve Reed, prepare for what they have billed as the biggest overhaul of water
  regulation since the industry was privatised in 1989. Ofwat has become a
  lightning rod for criticism of the sector, including over decades of
  underinvestment in infrastructure such as reservoirs and water treatment works
  while companies paid vast sums in dividends and other fees to their owners.
  Last year, the regulator gave a green light for companies to raise average
  bills by 36% over the next five years in order to pay for upgrades. After the
  decision to abolish the regulator, Black felt he had to go, according to a
  person familiar with internal discussions at Ofwat. However, the board did not
  want Black to leave and tried to persuade him to stay, the person said. One
  water company chief executive said they felt that he was the wrong figure to
  take the fall. Black said: “I have been privileged to be able to lead Ofwat
  over the last four years, during which time we have achieved a huge amount
  together as a team for customers and the environment. The 2024 price review
  backed an investment programme of £104bn, along with a further £50bn
  investment in major new water resources which will improve service,
  environmental outcomes and resilience in the years to come. I wish the team
  every success as they continue their important work.” Black was appointed
  interim chief executive in April 2021, and was permanently appointed a year
  later. He had risen through Ofwat’s ranks after joining as director of
  economics in 2012. Iain Coucher, Ofwat’s chair, thanked Black and said: “David
  has worked tirelessly to bring about transformational change in the water
  sector. He has sought new regulatory powers and resources to hold companies to
  account, taken major enforcement action and provided funding and incentive
  packages that drive continual improvements for customers.” The decision to
  replace Ofwat, revealed by the Guardian, was made after a review published
  last month by Sir Jon Cunliffe, a former deputy governor of the Bank of
  England, found that the sector was “broken”. The review recommended combining
  powers from four regulators, including Ofwat, into one. The interim boss of
  Ofwat will have to tackle several urgent issues. The UK’s biggest water
  company, Thames Water, has been locked in talks to try to agree leniency on
  fines from the regulator, which it has said will be necessary for its lenders
  to inject billions of pounds of new funding as part of an attempted takeover.
  The regulator has also faced criticism for pay for water companies deemed by
  some politicians as excessive, and for the effectiveness of an effort to ban
  bonuses for the worst polluters. Ofwat was this week directed to scrutinise
  £1.3m in previously undisclosed pay for Yorkshire Water boss Nicola Shaw,
  after the Guardian revealed the existence of the payments via Yorkshire’s
  offshore parent company. The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural
  Affairs was approached for comment.
