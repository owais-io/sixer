  Exhibition of the week Anna Boghiguian: The Sunken Boat: A Glimpse Into Past
  Histories Decayed and broken boats, puppet-like figures and sand feature in a
  salty installation about the sea as a space of world history. • Turner
  Contemporary, Margate, until 26 October Also showing Emma Critchley: Soundings
  Dancers, deep sea fish and Pacific activists all star in a video and sound
  installation about the state of the oceans. • Tate St Ives until 5 October
  Cliffs, Coves and Cockles: Picturing Gower Artists including Ceri Richards and
  Cedric Morris capture the romantic beauty of the Gower peninsula. • Glynn
  Vivian Gallery, Swansea, until 31 August Guy Oliver: Millennial Prayer An
  artist born in 1982 explores his masculinity and identity as a “first
  generation millennial”. Doesn’t sound narcissistic at all. • Jupiter Artland,
  near Edinburgh, until 28 September Jess Blandford: Tender Sensual, poetic
  abstract paintings to add artistic depth to a day in the park. • Southwark
  Park Galleries, London, until 21 September Image of the week The Dutch
  photographer Merlin Daleman shot this image outside a sandwich shop in
  Bridlington, East Yorkshire, in June 2017, one year after the UK voted to
  leave the EU. Daleman travelled through Britain’s four nations to capture
  street life, along with humour, warmth, fortitude and a sense of community in
  “left behind” towns. See more of his work in our gallery What we learned The
  Trump administration’s anti-woke campaign is targeting seven Smithsonian
  museums Barbara Hepworth’s Sculpture With Colour has been saved for the nation
  Jenny Saville’s paintings changed the course of novelist Douglas Stuart’s life
  Joe Caroff, who designed the 007 logo and many iconic film posters, has died
  Black British women changed the face of fashion in the UK An embroidery in
  Mexico is honouring the victims of femicide There no shortage of landscape
  sculpture in Edinburgh Masterpiece of the week View of the Venetian Lagoon
  With the Tower of Malghera by Francesco Guardi, probably 1770s A still, warm
  view of Venice’s lagoon, with delicate traceries of cloud in the blue sky and
  a mistiness that softens the sunlight and makes it deliciously gentle,
  provides the perfect painting for a lazy summer’s day. But don’t mistake this
  for an entirely placid work of art. It is a century ahead of its time.
  Guardi’s atmospheric light, and perception of sky and water becoming one,
  anticipate the French impressionists, especially Monet. And like Monet, Guardi
  has hidden depths. The atmosphere when you look again is changing, evening is
  on its way, perhaps a storm. Reality itself seems to melt at the edges.
  Nothing is quite solid. Let yourself float into this dream. • National
