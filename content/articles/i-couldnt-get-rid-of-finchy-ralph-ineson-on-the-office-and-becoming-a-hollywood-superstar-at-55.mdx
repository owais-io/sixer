  How do you portray Galactus, a gigantic, amoral, immortal superbeing who
  thrives by draining planets of their energy? If you’re making a film of any
  part of Marvel’s Fantastic Four journey, your best bet is probably to depict
  him as a cloud. That’s what happened in 2007, and even though fans complained
  about it a bit, it solved a lot of problems. Matt Shakman, director of the new
  The Fantastic Four: First Steps, cast Ralph Ineson, who still sounds faintly
  surprised by the move. “I’ve been working for a long time,” he says. His first
  role was a small part in Spender, the Jimmy Nail vehicle, in 1991, and he’s in
  a similar mould to Nail: tall with a handsome, rough-hewn face, a guy who
  looks as if he knows how to do guy stuff. “I’ve been a jobbing actor for a
  long time,” he continues, with the same disbelieving, “how the hell did I wind
  up in this huge movie?” tone of voice. “There’s no denying it’s really nice to
  have a huge trailer. And it was huge. Bigger than mine and my wife’s first
  flat.” (He married Ali Milner, a radio host, in 2003.) “Nice trailers, nice
  cars, and a paycheck. But it’s a privilege and an honour to be the first
  person to bring this character to life. Twelve-year-old me wouldn’t have
  believed some of this shit. I don’t have any snobbery about it. I loved it.”
  Then Ineson describes what it took to make this character, in terms I could
  already hear, after five minutes, were extremely true to form: stressing the
  industry and professionalism of everyone on set (including the two people
  whose job it was to blow cold air into each of his gauntlets between takes)
  except himself, the dude who just has to show up and try not to sweat. “They
  had to shoot me on a white background, with lots of bright light, and I’m
  wearing this enormous costume, so it was incredibly hot and there was nowhere
  for the heat to escape. Obviously, Galactus can’t sweat. So I had a Formula
  One pit crew of people around me.” It sounds like a nightmare, I suggest. “For
  me, there’s something quite masochistic about acting. Sometimes you only
  really get the good stuff when you’re at the edge of something, either
  mentally, emotionally or physically. It unlocks stuff.” And then, mindful that
  he has skated way closer to pretension than he’d prefer, “Occasionally I had
  to have the physio at my knees, because I’m 55 and falling apart.” His
  calling, as an actor, has been playing one bad guy after another, but he is
  one of the most personable people you could ever meet. Ineson grew up in Leeds
  in the 1970s, when he “felt as if acting was something that was almost
  shameful, or maybe that’s too strong a word. But it wasn’t really something to
  be proud of, when I was a kid.” His parents were supportive in the sense that
  they would never miss a show, but nobody thought it was a serious career
  prospect, and after doing theatre studies at Lancaster University, he worked
  as a drama teacher at a sixth-form college in York. He got involved with the
  York Mystery Plays – a tradition that’s been going, on and off, since the
  mid-14th century: a Bible story told every year, once performed on a roaming
  cart, then, by the time Ineson did it in 1992, at the York Theatre Royal. All
  the characters were played by the people of York, except for one professional
  actor, who that year was Robson Green. “He was pretty lonely on his own, sat
  in his hotel. We’d go out for a drink and I ended up sharing a dressing room
  with him. And he said: ‘You’re not wedded to being a teacher, are you?’ I
  wasn’t, although I did enjoy it, but I hadn’t been to drama school, I wasn’t
  classically trained. He said: ‘Go home and watch TV tonight, look at the
  characters you could play.’ So I watched a soap, I watched the nine o’clock
  drama, and there were about five people I thought I could play.” He describes
  the next phase as a series of lucky strikes: meeting an agent through Green
  and getting the part in Spender, “basically because I could ride off-road
  motorbikes – the character was a professional motocross rider”. Then another
  agent, more parts, but still “I don’t think I realised I wanted to be an actor
  until I’d been doing it for 20 years,” he says. “Shoots were something I
  really enjoyed, but almost pretended I didn’t. Then, I was sitting on a horse
  on the plains outside Santa Fe, dressed as the man in black, a posse leader” –
  that was The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, a Coen brothers film. “And I thought:
  ‘This is exactly what I have always wanted to do.’ I just didn’t realise it
  until I was in my mid-40s.” But that was 2018, and quite a lot had happened in
  the years before that. If you feel as if you know Ineson personally, it will
  be because of The Office, in 2001, where he occasionally breezed in as Finchy,
  the boorish sales rep whom Ricky Gervais’s David Brent hero-worshipped all the
  more for his proudly offensive humour. Ineson was sent the pilot episode on
  VHS, “which is how long ago it was. I remember being really terrified. How
  brilliant they were, the central four, firing off each other. I was slightly
  intimidated. My first thought was: ‘Shit, can I do this?’” When he first
  started out, he often felt as if he was on the back foot because he hadn’t
  been to drama school. “I don’t know whether I would have suited it, but it
  felt like a big thing for the first few years, because that is all young
  actors talk about.” Slowly, he came to have more regard for his own
  idiosyncratic apprenticeship: “For years I’ve had the chance to work on big
  productions without a lot of responsibility – mainly getting my horse to stand
  in the right place, being in that part of the screen, behind the main
  villain’s left shoulder. You learn a lot about acting, doing that.” Anyway,
  feeling that he had to be on his mettle – which was fair, Gervais, Mackenzie
  Crook, Martin Freeman and Lucy Davis were explosively good together – he made
  a fateful decision. “I thought: ‘I’ll use my own accent, I’ll play Finchy as a
  Yorkshireman so I don’t have to think about anything except keeping up with
  the rest of them.’ That was a big mistake, because it meant that everybody,
  for at least 10 years, thought that I was Finchy. That I wasn’t acting; that
  was just my personality. So having people thinking you’re Chris Finch, looking
  at you with amusement, but also a bit of disgust, a bit of fear. He’s just
  such a shitter. It’s not a nice skin!” It didn’t end with regular human
  interactions, either – “career-wise, it was a bit of pain. I just got offered
  wankers, racists, misogynists and homophobes.” Before The Office, he was
  always having to recount his CV for people in the street – they’d come up and
  go, “what have I seen you in?”, and he’d have to size them up and figure out
  whether they remembered him from Goodnight Sweetheart or an episode of The
  Bill. He remembers thinking it would be nice to have something so major that
  nobody would have to ask. “Be careful what you wish for, because then I got
  Finchy and I couldn’t get rid of him for about 20 years. At least Galactus
  simply exists, he’s a cosmic force. He doesn’t do it out of malice. You can’t
  really get much worse than Chris Finch.” He remains a big fan of The Office,
  which I smoke out by getting him to adjudicate between the British and
  American versions – he didn’t watch the US one for ages, because he caught
  snatches of it and thought: “No, they’re doing it wrong.” Five years ago, his
  daughter watched the whole thing and he realised, “it’s different, but it is
  good. Because I have a slightly twisted sense of humour, I prefer the British
  Office, it’s darker. You would actually let Michael Scott [Gervais’s US
  counterpart, played by Steve Carell] look after your 18-year-old daughter,
  whereas I’m not sure you’d let Ricky Gervais’s character look after your
  18-year-old daughter. Same with my character, he’s a lot darker than Todd
  Packer, the American version. Whether that makes it better or worse, I don’t
  know. It’s nastier underneath, which I kind of like.” The late 00s were taken
  up at least partly with the Harry Potter movies, in which he played the dark
  wizard Amycus Carrow. His son was 10 and his daughter was six when he shot
  Half-Blood Prince in 2008. It was the perfect age, you get the impression he’d
  have done it just so they could meet Daniel Radcliffe. He also got to hang out
  with Michael Gambon for days on end. “He’s the best storyteller in the world,
  ever. Joke-teller, raconteur, everything. He told me this joke that lasted a
  whole week; I could tell it in 15 seconds. It was one of the best weeks of my
  life.” Nevertheless, he had no lines at all, “a supporting artist, basically”.
  The producers enticed him in with the next two books, in which there’s more
  meat on Carrow’s bones. But when they came to make the astronomically long
  Deathly Hallows, parts one and two, the plot had been very slightly tweaked to
  remove the pivotal moment when his character spits in Professor McGonagall’s
  face and unleashes hell. “I did three Harry Potter films without saying a
  single line.” As the father in The Witch, Robert Eggers’s acclaimed,
  hypnotising horror movie, which won lots of indie film awards, including best
  director for Eggers at Sundance, Ineson felt that he’d got the first part with
  its own arc. This was 2015, when he was in his mid-40s, realising he actually
  was an actor, perhaps relatedly, at around the time the industry realised how
  good he was. He speaks so highly of his co-star, Kate Dickie – “she should be
  a dame, she’s that good,” he crescendoes a little surprisingly. But his
  collaboration with Eggers was intense. Ineson sat at the director’s shoulder
  while the other actors were cast. “It was a weird experience – it felt
  terribly unfaithful, as if I was cheating on my profession.” They worked
  together again on The Northman in 2022, which had a broader canvas visually
  and emotionally, but had the same feeling of The Witch, a film that had an
  immense amount of knowledge go into it, only a fraction of which you could pin
  down. “I have got no idea how Rob has managed to read so much in his lifetime,
  it feels as if he has an encyclopaedic knowledge of almost every period in
  history.” If Ineson was never prepared, post-Office, to give in to being
  typecast as a wanker, he’s pretty comfortable with being a supervillain. “I
  think with my size, face and voice, 90% of the time I’ve been on the bad guy
  side of the line anyway. I would be fighting a losing battle if I was trying
  to get myself into romcoms. Some things are beyond the realms of casting.” If
  The Fantastic Four: First Steps is a turning point, the difference is mainly
  one of scale. “Although I’ve been involved with big films before, I’ve never
  played a character that is this important to the film and the franchise,” he
  says, with an amount of trepidation. It’s true – there are other people in the
  movie (Pedro Pascal! Vanessa Kirby!), but if the villain doesn’t work, nothing
  does. “So if it doesn’t make a profit, it’s my fault? Is that what you’re
  saying?”, he says, mock petrified. The film is already doing fine at the box
  office. He should relax. • This article was amended on 6 August 2025. An
  earlier version said that Ralph Ineson did theatre studies at Furness College
  in Lancaster. In fact, he studied at Lancaster University where he was in
  Furness College.
