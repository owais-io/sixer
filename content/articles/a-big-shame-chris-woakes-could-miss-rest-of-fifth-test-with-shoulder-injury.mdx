  England face playing the remainder of the fifth Test against India a bowler
  down after Chris Woakes injured his left shoulder while fielding on the
  opening day at the Oval. The 36-year-old was scheduled to have a scan on
  Thursday evening, with his ability to take an active part in the remainder of
  the game to be assessed overnight. Woakes, the only English bowler considered
  fit enough to play all five games of a gruelling series, was clearly in
  considerable pain after landing awkwardly while attempting to keep the ball
  away from the boundary in the 60th over of a rain-affected day. After
  treatment on the field he was led to the dressing room with his arm cradled in
  a makeshift sling. “It doesn’t look great,” said Gus Atkinson, who was the
  pick of England’s bowlers on his return to the team. “It’s a big shame, in the
  last game of the series. I’m hoping it’s not too bad and whatever it is he’ll
  get full support from everyone.” Atkinson, who since injuring a hamstring in
  May has played one club game and once for Surrey’s second XI, said he was
  confident he could help the team’s remaining seamers cover for Woakes if the
  scan brings bad news. “I feel fresh, I feel good,” he said. “I know I’ve only
  got this one game to play, so I can push the limits a bit.” Assisted by some
  wayward bowling, if not by a green-tinged pitch, several rain breaks and
  consistently threatening overhead conditions, India reached stumps on 204 for
  six, with Karun Nair unbeaten on 52 as he seeks to give a previously
  personally disappointing tour an ending brighter than the skies he was playing
  under. “You look at the pitch, you look at the overheads and you think this
  should be easy for the bowlers, but it’s a ground where if you don’t bowl well
  you can go for a lot of runs,” said Atkinson. “It can be a tough ground to
  bowl on because of the way the ball moves – sometimes off the pitch, and it
  can swing a lot after it’s pitched. And the footholes weren’t easy. It was
  slippy out there and that can obviously affect the bowling.” Ryan ten
  Doeschate, India’s assistant coach, defended the decision not to play the
  team’s star bowler, Jasprit Bumrah, in conditions that appear ideal for him
  and after their captain, Shubman Gill, had indicated on Wednesday that he
  remained under consideration. “It’s quite a complex issue. We want to wheel
  him out but we also want to respect where his body’s at,” the Dutchman said.
  “He’s bowled a large number of overs. He did say coming into the tour he could
  only play three games and we felt it was right to honour that call. “Our
  thinking was the Oval’s normally a fairly good wicket for batting on, so we
  thought we’d roll the dice in Manchester. With hindsight we’d love to have him
  here. Maybe England have got it spot on, leaving the best bowling wicket for
  the last Test after he’s played three. For a tour of England you’d expect
  conditions closer to this than what we’ve seen in the first four Tests.”
  England’s task was eased by a calamitous decision by Gill, the leading
  run-scorer in the series, to attempt a run after nudging the ball into
  Atkinson’s path as the bowler completed his follow-through and having scored
  only 21. “He’s in the touch of his life. Again today he made batting look
  really easy,” Ten Doeschate said. “But these mistakes do happen, and that’s a
  misjudgement of a run. Given what he’s done in the first four Tests we’ll let
  him get away with that one.”
