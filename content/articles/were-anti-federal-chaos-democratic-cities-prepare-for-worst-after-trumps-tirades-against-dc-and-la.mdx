  ‘We’re anti-federal chaos’: Democratic cities prepare for worst after Trump’s
  tirades against DC and LA

  As sand-colored Humvees rolled down Washington DC streets against the wishes
  of local leaders, mayors around the country planned for what they would do if
  the Trump administration comes for them next. Donald Trump’s disdain for
  Democratic-run cities featured heavily in his 2024 campaign. The president
  vowed to take over DC – a promise he attempted to fulfill this week. Earlier
  this year, he sent national guard troops to Los Angeles amid protests despite
  California opposing the move, which led to a lawsuit from the state. City
  leaders say there are appropriate ways for the federal government to partner
  with them to address issues such as crime, but that Trump is using the pretext
  of crime and unrest to override their local authority, create chaos and
  distract from a bruising news cycle about his ties to Jeffrey Epstein. Many
  cities have worked to bring down violent crime rates – they are on the decline
  in most large cities, though mayors acknowledge they still have work to do to
  improve the lives of their residents. “President Trump constantly creates a
  narrative that cities like Seattle are liberal hellholes and we are lawless,
  and that is just not the fact,” said Bruce Harrell, the mayor of Seattle. “We
  are the home of great communities and great businesses. So his view of our
  city is not aligned with reality. It’s to distract the American people from
  his failures as a president.” By sending in the military, some noted, Trump
  was probably escalating crime, contributing to distrust in the government and
  creating unsafe situations both for residents and service members. Even
  Republican mayors or mayors in red states have said they don’t agree with
  Trump usurping local control for tenuous reasons. The US Conference of Mayors,
  currently led by the Republican mayor of Oklahoma City, David Holt, pushed
  back against Trump’s takeover of DC, saying “local control is always best”.
  “These mayors around the country, by the way, from multiple ideological
  backgrounds, they love their city more than they love their ideology,” said
  Jacob Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis. Mayors told the Guardian they are ready
  to stand up for their cities, legally and otherwise, should Trump come
  knocking. They are working with their chiefs of police to ensure they agree on
  the chain of command and coordinating with governors in the event the national
  guard is deployed. Because Trump has so frequently brought up plans to crack
  down on cities, large Democratic cities have been strategizing with emergency
  planning departments and city attorneys. But Trump has shown he is willing to
  bend and break the law in his pursuits against cities. The Pentagon is
  reportedly planning to potentially put national guard troops at the ready,
  stationed in Alabama and Arizona, to deploy to cities experiencing unrest. He
  has indicated this is just the beginning of an assault on cities. His attorney
  general sent letters to a host of Democratic cities this week, threatening to
  arrest local leaders if they don’t cooperate with federal authorities on
  immigration enforcement. The idea that troops could be on the ground for any
  number of reasons in cities around the US should alarm people, said Brett
  Smiley, the Democratic mayor of Providence, Rhode Island. “This is not
  something that we should be used to, and we shouldn’t let this administration
  break yet another norm or standard in our society, such that a couple years
  from now, we don’t think twice about when we see troops in our cities,” Smiley
  said. Why Trump is going after cities The roots of Trump’s battle with cities
  stretch back to his first administration, and they align with common
  narratives on the right about how cities today have fallen off because of
  liberal policies. Project 2025, the conservative blueprint, called for
  crackdowns on cities, including withholding federal funds to force compliance
  with deportation plans. His campaign promises included a commitment to
  “deploying federal assets, including the National Guard, to restore law and
  order when local law enforcement refuses to act”. In a video from 2023, he
  explained: “In cities where there has been a complete breakdown of law and
  order, where the fundamental rights of our citizens are being intolerably
  violated, I will not hesitate to send in federal assets including the national
  guard until safety is restored.” In 2020, he reportedly wished he had cracked
  down much harder and faster on protesters and rioters during the
  demonstrations after George Floyd’s murder. Now, he’s using smaller problems –
  anti-immigration protests and crime against a government employee – to declare
  emergencies. Minneapolis, where the protests began after a police officer
  killed Floyd, has at times made Trump’s list of rundown cities. Frey, a
  Democrat, said he didn’t know whether 2020 protests played a role in Trump’s
  current actions. “I don’t think anybody can pretend to know what’s in Donald
  Trump’s head,” Frey said. “It’s an utter mess of idiocy. I don’t know what
  he’s thinking. I don’t know what he’s thinking or what the rhyme or reason is.
  I mean, clearly there’s a focus on Democratically run cities.” When Trump
  called out other cities on his radar, he named blue cities run by Black mayors
  – Baltimore, Oakland, Los Angeles, Chicago. “The fact that my city and all the
  others called out by the president on Sunday, led by Black mayors, are all
  making historic progress on crime, but they’re the ones getting called up – it
  tells you everything that you need to know,” Baltimore’s mayor, Brandon Scott,
  said in a press call this week. DC is different The federal government can
  often partner with cities to address crime – several Democratic mayors noted
  that they worked with the Biden administration on this front successfully. But
  those partnerships are mutually agreed upon collaborations, not overrides of
  local policing. “We’re not anti-federal help. We’re anti-federal chaos,” Frey
  said. Detroit’s mayor, Mike Duggan, said in a statement that his city was
  seeing its lowest homicides, shootings and carjackings in more than 50 years,
  crediting a partnership with federal agencies and the US attorney as a major
  part of that success. “This partnership is simple and effective: DPD does the
  policing and the feds have strongly increased support for federal
  prosecution,” Duggan said. “We appreciate the partnership we have today and
  are aware of no reason either side would want to change it.” Mayors are not
  saying they have solved the issue of violent crime, Scott said, though they
  are acknowledging they have reduced it and will continue to work toward
  further reductions. “We need folks that want to actually help us do that,
  versus try to take and show force and make us into something other than a
  representative democracy that we all are proud to call home,” he said. Mayors
  throughout the US made a clear distinction between Trump’s authority in
  Washington DC compared with other cities. Washington has a legal provision in
  the Home Rule Act of 1973 that allows for a president to take over its police
  department during an emergency on a temporary basis, though Trump is the first
  to use this power. Other cities have no similar concept in law. Even with the
  Home Rule Act, Washington officials sued Trump after his attempt to replace
  the city’s police chief, saying the president was mounting a “hostile
  takeover” of DC police. Trump and the city agreed to scale back the federal
  takeover on Friday, keeping DC’s police chief in place. “We know when people
  want to say they’re going to be a dictator on day one, they never voluntarily
  give up that aspiration on day two,” Norm Eisen, an attorney who frequently
  sues the Trump administration, said in a press call this week. “That is what
  you are seeing in the streets of the District of Columbia.” Cities are
  preparing In Minneapolis, Frey said the city had prepared operational plans
  with police, fire and emergency management and readied itself legally. “Our
  chief of police and I are lockstep, and he reports up to the commissioner of
  safety, who reports up to me,” Frey said. “There’s no lack of clarity as to
  how this reporting structure works, and it certainly does not go to Donald
  Trump. Doing something like that in Minneapolis, it would be just a blatantly
  illegal usurpation of local control were this to happen here. Of course, we
  would take immediate action to get injunctive relief.” Trump’s decision to
  send in national guard troops to Los Angeles is also legally questionable.
  Governors typically direct guard troops. The California governor, Gavin
  Newsom, sued Trump for using the military for domestic law enforcement in
  defiance of the Posse Comitatus Act. The case was heard by a judge this week.
  Harrell, of Seattle, said he was confident he would be able to protect his
  police department and the city’s residents if Trump sends troops. “What I have
  to do is make sure that the people under my jurisdiction as mayor feel
  confident in an ability to fight his overreach, and that our law department is
  well geared to advance our legal arguments,” he said. Scott, of Baltimore,
  said he was prepared to take every action “legally and otherwise”. Still,
  there is some uncertaintyand unsteadiness about how cities can respond if
  Trump calls up the national guard. “It’s very difficult to know what our
  options are, because we’re in uncharted territory here,” Smiley, of
  Providence, said. “It’s unprecedented and I don’t know what my options are
  with respect to preventing troops from coming in, which is one of the reasons
  that I’m trying to be so proactive about making it clear that it’s not
  necessary, it’s not wanted.” • This article was amended on 17 August 2025. An
  earlier version stated that tanks were present in Washington DC, when they
  were actually Humvees.
