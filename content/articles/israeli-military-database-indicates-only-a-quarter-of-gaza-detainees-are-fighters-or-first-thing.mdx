  Good morning. Only a quarter of detainees from Gaza held in Israeli jails are
  identified as fighters by Israel’s military intelligence, according to
  classified data. A joint investigation by the Guardian, the
  Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 magazine and the Hebrew-language outlet
  Local Call reveals that Israel’s data indicates that civilians make up the
  overwhelming majority of Palestinians held without charge or trial. Those
  jailed include children and elderly people, sick, and disabled people, as well
  as medical workers, teachers, civil servants, media workers and writers. In
  May, Israel had detained 6,000 people under its “unlawful combatants”
  legislation, which allows indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial,
  official data released after legal appeals showed. Of this number, 1,450
  individuals were on Israel’s database that classifies individuals as Hamas and
  Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters. How has the war changed detainees’ rights?
  Israel has extended the length of time the state can detain someone without
  access to a lawyer from 75 to 180 days. It also lengthened the number of days
  people can be held before bringing them before a judge to authorize the
  detention from 45 to 75. Trump asks US supreme court to overturn trade tariffs
  ruling Donald Trump has asked the US supreme court to review a lower-court
  decision that found most of his trade tariffs were illegal. In a decisive blow
  to his trade policy, on Friday the federal appeals court found in a 7-4 ruling
  that Trump had exceeded his presidential powers by using a 1977 law designed
  to address national emergencies to introduce his 2 April “liberation day”
  border taxes. The ruling upheld a previous decision by the US court of
  international trade. What does last week’s decision mean for the levies? They
  have been left in place until 14 October, which affords the administration
  time to ask the supreme court to overturn the decision. Democrats foil justice
  department lawsuit by negotiating to keep 98,000 North Carolina voters
  Democrats have successfully negotiated an agreement to safeguard the voting
  rights of about 98,000 North Carolina residents after the Trump administration
  tried to restrict them. The action was taken after the justice department sued
  the North Carolina state board of elections this year, demanding that the
  state prevent those who had provided a driver’s license number or the last
  four digits of their social security number when they registered from voting.
  The Democratic National Committee and voting rights groups in the state
  stepped in, arguing that the actions demanded by the justice department
  breached the National Voter Registration Act and had partisan motivations.
  What are the terms of the agreement? Voters who have not provided the
  information can still vote with a provisional ballot. In other news … Portugal
  has declared a day of national mourning after at least 17 people were killed
  when a Lisbon funicular railway car derailed and crashed on Wednesday. Donald
  Trump’s administration acted unlawfully in rescinding about $2.2bn in grants
  to Harvard University, and can no longer withhold funding to the Ivy League
  school, a federal judge has ruled. Jamaica has re-elected Andrew Holness and
  the Jamaica Labour party for a third consecutive term in government after a
  close race against the People’s National party. The Trump administration
  deliberately chose to hold immigration detainees in a Louisiana prison because
  of its notorious reputation, said the Department of Homeland Security
  secretary, Kristi Noem. Stat of the day: Sweeteners can harm cognitive health
  equivalent to 1.6 years of ageing, study finds Consuming large amounts of
  sweeteners, such as those used in soft drinks, is linked to a 62% faster
  decline in the ability to think and remember – equivalent to ageing 1.6 years,
  a study has found. It adds to a growing body of research that suggests
  sweeteners such as aspartame and saccharin may raise the risk of a range of
  diseases including type 2 diabetes, cancer, heart problems, depression and
  dementia, as well as damage the gut wall. Don’t miss this: The Knoxville
  dropout fighting to change how we see addiction Kirsten Smith was 16 when she
  first injected morphine; 18 when she shot up oxycodone. By 19, she had moved
  on to heroin, and within a few years she was in prison. Now, as an assistant
  professor of psychiatry and behavioural sciences, she believes her path was
  shaped of her own volition – and resists the model that understands addiction
  as a relapsing disease of the brain, arguing that it can stop people believing
  full recovery is possible. Climate check: Spain and Portugal wildfire weather
  ‘made 40 times more likely by climate crisis’ The extreme weather that fueled
  August’s deadly wildfires in Portugal and Spain was made 40 times more likely
  by the climate crisis, according to early analysis. Researchers also found
  that climate breakdown made the fires, which burned 1.2m acres of the Iberian
  peninsula within weeks, 30% more intense. Last Thing: New Jersey man
  breakdances through town hall tax questions Footage has gone viral of a man
  from New Jersey prefacing his questions about rising taxes at a town hall
  meeting with a breakdancing performance. Will Thilly, who has a history of
  unconventional town hall appearances, said after Tuesday’s impromptu
  performance that he wanted local government to “lighten up” as “people are
  overly stressed”. Sign up First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes
