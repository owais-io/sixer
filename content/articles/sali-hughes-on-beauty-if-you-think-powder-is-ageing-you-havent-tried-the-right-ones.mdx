  Sali Hughes on beauty: if you think powder is ageing, you haven’t tried the
  right ones

  I am rabidly defensive of face powder. “Powder is ageing” is one of those
  enduring beauty cliches that’s not necessarily true – especially now, when
  powders are often talc-free, softly blurring in finish, and frequently contain
  moisturising ingredients. Powder is essential in keeping wet formulations such
  as foundation on your face, and if the appearance of skin ageing bothers you,
  then the right pressed powder is your ally. Shine and greasiness in the wrong
  places, such as on the chin, nose and under the eyes, is more ageing and a
  quality powder will not only mattify it, but can simultaneously reflect light
  and impart greater smoothness. I’ve recently been enjoying Saie’s new Slip
  Tint Undetectable Baked Setting Powder (£26). This is a sensible choice if
  you’ve previously been scared off, since it adds the sheerest veil of airy,
  very natural-looking powder and takes the edge off shine rather than removing
  it completely. If you’ve previously loved (the, in my opinion, perfect) MAC
  Mineralise Skinfinish Natural powder (£34) but are keen to lose the talc, this
  gives that same flattering eggshell finish without it. For dull complexions, I
  would enthusiastically recommend Fenty’s new brightening shades of their
  classic pressed powder. Bright Fix Instant Brightening + Blurring Powder (£27)
  delivers on its name. I particularly love the lavender shade to wake up my
  undereyes, but as is standard with Fenty, the shade range caters for everyone.
  It’s incredibly finely textured, noticeably blurs pores, and held up in the
  recent spell of hot, humid weather. Charlotte Tilbury’s Airbrush Flawless
  Finish powder (£39) is wildly popular, and correctly so. It’s easily my own
  most-used for its versatility and is never far from reach. It sets foundation
  almost as well as a loose powder, controls shine and reboots hours-old makeup
  in seconds. Vieve’s refillable Modern Powder Perfector (£32) lives in the same
  ballpark, giving a similarly smart and smooth finish, the same smidge of
  coverage and no chalky dryness. For oily skins, I’d like to give a shout out
  to the underrated and often overlooked IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Pores (£30), which
  is quietly excellent in blurring the texture of congested skin while lightly
  brightening and locking down concealer beneath. What appears white in the pan
  is colourless on the skin, making it suitable for any skin tone (although
  there are two additional, deeper shades). Elf’s Perfect Finish HD Powder is a
  decent dupe for just £7.
