  What if the protagonist of a novel was not a single person but a couple?
  Damian Barr takes on this challenge, and he’s found a historic couple who make
  the ideal source material. Working-class Scottish artists Bobby MacBryde and
  Robert Colquhoun were rarely apart after they met in 1933. They lived and
  worked together, became famous together and then declined into desperate
  squalor together – even poorer than when they began. Barr knows what it’s like
  to conquer Glasgow from a small, working-class town on its outskirts; he knows
  what it’s like to find yourself feted for your portraits of the place you’ve
  left irrevocably behind. His memoir, Maggie and Me, was a hard-hitting yet
  rambunctious tale of growing up gay near Motherwell under Thatcher, uneasily
  aware that the woman who pushed his parents deeper into poverty also taught
  him that the ruthless exercise of his talents offered his escape. He expanded
  his exploration of how brutality can take hold in his novel You Will Be Safe
  Here, set in South Africa. Now he returns to Scotland in this moving
  meditation on art, love and home. In Barr’s telling, the two Roberts meet on
  their first day at the Glasgow School of Art – scholarship boys drawn
  together, reluctantly on Robert’s part and enthusiastically on Bobby’s. They
  move into the attic of the wealthy socialist Mrs Cranston (“Politics is
  everyone’s thing, whether we like it or not,” she reprimands their tutor) and
  live on Bobby’s stews and a love that moves rapidly from seeming impossible to
  feeling predestined, driven by Bobby’s courage in seeking out other homosexual
  friends and allies on the fringes of Glasgow life. They’re divided by war,
  when Robert fights and the asthmatic Bobby doesn’t, and then become celebrated
  figures in bohemian London, exhibiting at the Lefevre gallery and mingling in
  Soho with Francis Bacon and Peter Watson (Barr has Robert driving an
  ambulance, just about plausibly, with Bacon). Over the years, it’s common for
  couples to divide not just household tasks but talents and traits between
  them, so that each grows into their differences from the other. Barr is very
  astute on the ways that the two Roberts deplete as well as enhance each other.
  There’s charm in their differences: Bobby’s face is a sun, Robert’s a half
  moon; Bobby cries easily while Robert holds his feelings in. But more
  disturbingly, they divide their art too, so that Bobby paints still lifes
  while Robert paints people, and Bobby comes to feel that he would betray his
  lover if he changed this. “What started out as a joke is becoming a contract
  that Bobby doesn’t remember signing.” It’s not surprising that Robert, with
  his more fragile ego and his more ruthless commitment to work, becomes the
  more successful one, and that Bobby declines as Robert flourishes, until
  Robert, dependent always on Bobby’s resourcefulness and bonhomie, begins to
  decline as well. Barr’s memoir all too vividly described his mother’s drunken
  fights with her boyfriend. These memories must power the lurid incandescence
  of the brawls between the men as they drink away income and talent. The arc of
  this tale is long: the book stretches from 1933 to 1959. Barr moves from the
  intense, intimate storytelling of the opening chapters to a travelogue that
  skates across place and time, and then narrates their final years by
  impressively imagining the letters that Bobby sends to old acquaintances
  begging for cash. There are moments when all this becomes unwieldy. I’d hope
  that a novelist with such considerable skill could do better than introducing
  lengthy backstory with “as the strap settles, he remembers what it took to get
  here, to this moment”. There are also sections where Robert remains shadowy
  compared with the livelier and more introspective Bobby – but it’s true of
  many couples in life that one is less knowable than the other. And it was
  remarkable how much I did care about the men’s relationship throughout,
  finding the prospect of their splitting up as unthinkable as they do, however
  unlivable their life together becomes. Barr’s care for the two Roberts is
  palpable. The narrator is drawn into their erotic force field, almost as if
  there are three people in this couple (as it happens, actual threesomes are
  frequent occurrences). “Never forget where you come fae,” Bobby’s Aunt Maggie
  tells him as she sends him out to conquer the world. Barr dramatises the
  double-edged complexity of this. Insofar as it’s Barr’s own return home, this
  novel is a kind of love letter to Scotland – from the Ayrshire hills where the
  men lie “painting together, curled like commas, naked in the nest they’ve
  rolled in the high golden grass”, to Glasgow’s Mackintosh building, with its
  huge panes of glass that “bounce the north light like sails catching a wind”.
  But it’s a love letter that encodes diagnosis and disaster. Both Roberts
  flourish in London as Scottish artists, with Scottish subjects and Scottish
  party pieces. Yet they’re unwelcome when they make a catastrophic trip home.
  Barr mingles comedy and tragedy with wonderful fluidity, showing that it’s
  their inability to forget where they’re from and truly find a home elsewhere
  that destroys them, in the end. • Lara Feigel is the author of Look! We Have
  Come Through! – Living with DH Lawrence (Bloomsbury). The Two Roberts by
  Damian Barr is published by Canongate (£18.99). To support the Guardian order
