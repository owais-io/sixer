  “You say it best, when you say nothing at all,” was how Ronan Keating put it.
  Whether Erik ten Hag will choose to get over his latest breakup with a tub of
  ice-cream in front of a rewatch of Notting Hill is open to conjecture but if
  he did, the Irish singer’s lyrics dotted through the film are sure to have an
  added poignancy. Ten Hag didn’t need telling that in only his second
  Bundesliga game in charge of Bayer Leverkusen, they and he had had a bad
  afternoon. Going to a diminished and depleted Werder Bremen (it is probably
  too early to say lowly, even though we strongly suspect that is the part of
  the table where they may end up spending most of their time), Die Werkself
  appeared to be on top of things, holding a 3-1 lead and a man advantage. Not
  so. A first senior goal for the 18-year-old Karim Coulibaly, deftly poked in
  from just inside the six-yard box after a chaotic spell of pressure, gave the
  home side a wildly celebrated and barely believable leveller. As this was the
  last image of Ten Hag in Leverkusen, Coulibaly’s surprise intervention – he
  was drafted in from the under-19 team for a first start after a slew of
  injuries – will feel like the full stop, the moment that pushed the coach over
  the edge. That will not quite be true. It has been a brutal end and a historic
  failure, for both coach and club, with no Bundesliga club ever having
  appointed a new coach and then removed him after two games. Yet for anybody
  around Leverkusen in the buildup to the trip to Bremen, it can’t be said to
  have been a surprise. It was evident that for Ten Hag’s second Bundesliga game
  in charge (yes, it bears repeating), he was already under enormous pressure
  not just to produce a result but to produce a performance, some evidence of
  direction and leadership in the team’s on-field efforts. None of those things
  were forthcoming. If Leverkusen had escaped the Weserstadion with a win, it
  would have been just that. It had been, in the words of the captain, Robert
  Andrich, “misery versus misery”, an entertaining spectacle but not one of high
  class and not one where Ten Hag’s team had really looked like bringing their
  superior quality to bear. Andrich was the only Leverkusen player to come
  forward and face the media afterwards but that’s all that was needed. The
  Germany midfielder is always direct and clear, and he was here. “What happened
  then is emblematic of our current situation,” he fumed. “We have too many
  people who are preoccupied with other things, too many who are only concerned
  with themselves, and that’s what the game looked like. Everyone played for
  themselves.” Some of this had been clear, not least in the unseemly dispute
  over who should take the penalty that Patrik Schick eventually scored to make
  it 3-1. Schick and Exequiel Palacios argued, Andrich stepped in to settle it
  and gave the ball to Schick – “We can’t stand around on the pitch and play
  rock-paper-scissors for two minutes,” was how the skipper framed it – and
  Palacios then kicked the ball away in frustration. If Andrich had reason to
  bring the blame on to the players, it said little for Ten Hag’s authority, as
  the coach himself implicitly conceded in his post-match press conference. “It
  was very clear who the [penalty takers] were and they simply didn’t implement
  that,” he said, describing the situation as “unacceptable”. But if Ten Hag’s
  own words had little impact, Andrich’s did. Just as his words describing the
  squad’s shortcomings had prefaced the fall of Gerardo Seoane, which led to the
  appointment of Xabi Alonso. Andrich’s words cut through because of the
  content, because of his delivery and because of their solitude. Both the
  sporting director, Simon Rolfes, before the game, and the chief executive,
  Fernando Carro, had been given opportunities to publicly back Ten Hag but they
  had declined to take them. Their nothing at all, to recall Keating, said it
  best. Whatever the result in Bremen, it was really hard to imagine anything
  turning the tide. For if they had been bad in Bremen, they had been truly
  atrocious the week before in the curtain-raiser against Hoffenheim. Even that,
  though, could be argued to be more symptom than cause when we look at the fall
  of Ten Hag. Nobody is suggesting that the former Manchester United coach was
  dealt anything other than a difficult hand, with over €200m worth of player
  sales this summer and the loss of key leaders like Lukas Hradecky, Jonathan
  Tah and Granit Xhaka besides. Even if one takes into account the good
  reputation that Ten Hag enjoyed in Germany from his previous association with
  Bayern Munich, he began on the back foot not just because he followed Alonso
  or took charge of a changing squad at the end of an era, but because he wasn’t
  first choice. The club thought at one point they had a deal for Cesc Fàbregas
  to replace his former international teammate, but Como weren’t for turning and
  Fàbregas was not keen on forcing. From there, the PR disasters kept pace with
  the player exits. There was the infamous 5-1 defeat to Flamengo’s under-20s on
  a promotional tour of Brazil, aimed at continuing Leverkusen’s eager global
  brand expansion. Ten Hag could have reacted in many ways but while
  acknowledging that the result shouldn’t have happened, the headlines became
  his lines that “the game came too soon” and that he “couldn’t give a shit
  about results in pre-season”. It kept coming. The Xhaka exit was perhaps a
  turning point, not because Leverkusen were losing an important influence of
  the rampantly successful Alonso era but because Ten Hag – inexplicably to the
  club – came out and publicly said that he didn’t want the Switzerland
  midfielder to go and aimed to keep him. Rolfes and Carro were blindsided, with
  the sporting director having described getting good money for an ageing player
  and key piece of a previous regime as “a win-win-win” and having discussed it
  (and from their perspective agreed the strategy) with the coach behind the
  scenes. There was more: the all-new coaching team who hadn’t worked together
  before feeling disjointed and the lack of any real reaction to the Hoffenheim
  loss, after which the recently arrived Mark Flekken felt comfortable enough to
  tear his team’s performance apart publicly to journalists. It will be a busy
  transfer deadline day for Leverkusen with Eliesse Ben Seghir having already
  arrived from Monaco and more players of considerable stock to come. Those
  actions, and that a new coach will be tasked with guiding them into the top
  four, will say more than anything Rolfes or Carro could have in a statement.
