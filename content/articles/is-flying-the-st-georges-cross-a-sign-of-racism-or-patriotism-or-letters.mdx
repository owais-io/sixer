  Last week in my small rural town, St George’s flags were erected from
  lamp-posts and crudely daubed on roundabouts and zebra crossings, while
  residents were subjected to “Sieg Heil” as a mob walked along the streets.
  Downing Street has put out a statement that patriotism is important, while
  Joanne Monk, the Reform UK leader of Worcestershire city council, also
  emphasised pride in the flag. I have nothing against the flag per se, but when
  Nazi thugs use it to demonstrate and catcall, it morphs into something else
  entirely. As a Black person, I have been subject to abuse three times in the
  past fortnight. My 12-year-old child and his friend were called “paedos” at
  school – they are the only Black children in the class – and a friend’s child
  was called the N-word on the bus (this was before the summer recess). To be
  Black in the countryside at the moment is to have a target on your back. There
  are real-world consequences of constantly demonising Black and Brown people in
  the media, racialising crimes and acting as if the most vulnerable people in
  our society – asylum seekers – are the reasons your energy bills are too high
  or you can’t afford your food shop. Nigel Farage and his acolytes know what
  they are doing with their disinformation and division campaign, and the media
  should be ashamed of giving them so much airtime. As Rafael Behr notes
  (There’s an obvious way to challenge Nigel Farage. But Keir Starmer won’t do
  it, 27 August), the distraction technique is a well-worn part of Farage’s
  playbook. A strong prime minister would call him out, not mimic him. If he
  gets into Downing Street in 2029, as some pollsters predict, we will only have
  ourselves to blame. Name and address supplied • I am surprised that someone
  who asked their neighbour to take down an England flag is astonished by their
  refusal to do so (Letters, 26 August). But why would they comply? The flag is
  not obscene, offensive or inappropriate; it is the flag of England being flown
  in England. I do not recall similar objections when Ukrainian flags appeared
  in windows in a display of solidarity. Nor do such debates arise when the
  England men’s football team enjoys success, prompting a surge of flags in
  cars, pubs and homes. And the union jacks along the Mall in London rarely
  attract controversy. To equate the St George’s cross with extremism is a
  mistake. Suppressing its display does not challenge intolerance, it merely
  silences legitimate expressions of national identity. Surely the more
  constructive approach is to foster open discussion rather than to remove
  symbols. If one chooses to live in England, one should reasonably expect to
  see England’s flag flown with pride. There is nothing inherently wrong in
  expressing affection for one’s own country. Name and address supplied • I live
  on a terrace of 16 houses. A couple of years ago, one of our neighbours put up
  a St George’s cross. At first, the flag seemed football-related, but they left
  it flying indefinitely. As such a powerful signifier of patriotism, many of us
  felt it gave our terrace a distorted and unwanted image. It then occurred to
  us that we could drown out that cultural noise by us all flying flags. Ten
  houses participated. We made poles from fishing rods and bamboo. I chose the
  flag of Jamaica to represent my partly Caribbean family. There were flags from
  the Philippines, Scotland, Spain, rainbows and doves, and we raised them as
  high as possible above the union flag. On breezy, sunny days they made our
  terrace seem like a festival of difference. Many people asked residents what
  we were celebrating. Our answer was that “we are from everywhere”. The St
  George’s cross couple soon left and our community settled back into its
  peaceful ways. Jane Ryan Woodbridge, Suffolk • Further to the very interesting
  letters about the current rash of flags, has anyone noticed that nearly all
  the ones on tall lamp-posts are flying at half mast? Is it just that
  flag-flyers don’t have cherry pickers, or are we unconsciously in mourning for
  the decline of compassion and decency? Michael Pyke Lichfield, Staffordshire •
  It’s heartening to see so many lads supporting the England women’s team in the
  Rugby World Cup with their street flags. Hugh Coolican Broughton Astley,
  Leicestershire • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian
