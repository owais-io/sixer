  The Israeli military has put parts of Gaza City and Khan Younis under new
  enforced displacement orders amid fears that the country’s prime minister,
  Benjamin Netanyahu, is preparing to order the full occupation of the
  Palestinian territory later this week. Israel’s security cabinet is expected
  to meet on Thursday evening and sign off on plans for an expanded operation
  despite reported serious misgivings from senior military officers. The order
  for Gaza – euphemistically described by the Israel Defense Forces as an
  “evacuation” – is the latest in dozens of such announcements that have
  displaced the vast majority of Gaza’s population, many on multiple occasions.
  The orders came as the US president, Donald Trump, said any decision over
  expanded Israeli control in Gaza was up to Israel. “As far as the rest of it,
  I really can’t say. That’s going to be pretty much up to Israel,” he told
  reporters on Tuesday. Many people had returned to Gaza City only relatively
  recently after long periods of displacement to find their homes war-damaged
  and looted, with even doors and windows stolen in some cases. As Gaza’s health
  ministry reported that five more people had died from starvation in the
  coastal strip, which has been plunged into a devastating hunger crisis owing
  to Israel’s complete block on aid entering earlier this year, Jordan reported
  an aid convoy of 30 trucks that had left for Gaza had been attacked by
  militant Jewish settlers on entering Israel. After the attack, the second in
  days, Jordan accused Israel of failing to act to prevent repeated assaults.
  “This requires a serious Israeli intervention and no leniency in dealing with
  those who obstruct these convoys,” said Jordan’s government spokesperson
  Mohammad al-Momani. Amid continuing scenes of desperate suffering in Gaza,
  where vast areas have been rendered fields of rubble by incessant Israeli
  strikes, the strip’s civil defence agency reported that 20 people were killed
  when an aid truck overturned on a crowd of people. “Twenty people were killed
  and dozens injured around midnight last night in a truck carrying aid [that]
  overturned … while hundreds of civilians were waiting for aid,” said the
  agency’s spokesperson, Mahmoud Bassal. The incident took place near the
  Nuseirat refugee camp as the truck was driving on an unsafe road that Israel
  had previously bombed, Bassal added. Amid acute shortages of aid, trucks
  entering Gaza have been surrounded and looted by hungry Palestinians on
  numerous occasions, contributing to a pervasive sense of chaos. The new forced
  displacement order for Gaza City was made as Israeli media reported
  Netanyahu’s apparent determination to push ahead with an expanded war after
  consultations with his military chiefs on Tuesday and despite growing disquiet
  from serving and former Israeli security officials over the proposals
  reportedly including the Israel Defense Forces chief of staff, Eyal Zamir.
  According to reports, Zamir warned Netanyahu during a tense, three-hour
  meeting on Tuesday that the plan could trap the military in the territory amid
  concerns Israel’s military is already badly overstretched. Zamir has made no
  public statements on the matter. Critics of the plan say any push for full
  occupation – a demand being made by Israel’s far right – would put the lives
  of Israeli hostages in Gaza at risk, could take between a year and two years
  to fully achieve, and would come at the expense of the country’s increasing
  diplomatic isolation, with the international community increasingly horrified
  by Israel’s actions. Among those who spoke out against the plan on Wednesday
  was the Israeli opposition leader, Yair Lapid. “I told Netanyahu that
  occupying Gaza is a very bad idea,” Lapid said after meeting the Israeli prime
  minister. “You don’t make such a move if a majority of the people aren’t with
  you.” Other critics include former leaders of Israel’s Shin Bet internal
  security service, the Mossad spy agency and the military – and also the former
  Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak. In a video posted to social media this
  week, they said far-right members of the government were holding Israel
  “hostage” in prolonging the conflict. Netanyahu’s objectives in Gaza are “a
  fantasy” said Yoram Cohen, a former head of Shin Bet, in the video. Amid signs
  of divisions between Netanyahu and military commanders, the defence minister,
  Israel Katz, said on Wednesday that the army’s chief of staff, Eyal Zamir,
  could “express his views”, but that the military would ultimately have to
  “execute” any government decisions on Gaza. Katz made the statement on X after
  reports in the Israeli media in recent days suggested that Zamir is opposed to
  a government plan to fully occupy the Gaza Strip. “It is the right and duty of
  the chief of staff to express his position in the appropriate forums, and
  after decisions are made by the political echelon, the [army] will execute
  them with determination and professionalism … until the war’s objectives are
  achieved,” Katz wrote. “As the defence minister responsible for the [army] on
  behalf of the government, I must ensure that these decisions are carried out –
  and so it will be,” he added. Gaza’s health ministry said that at least 135
  Palestinians, including 87 people seeking food, had been killed and 771
  injured in Israeli attacks across Gaza in the past 24 hours. Agencies
