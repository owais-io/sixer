  Disability representative groups say they are “collectively disappointed”
  after being blindsided by the Albanese government’s plans to divert children
  with mild to moderate developmental delays or autism from the NDIS. Ten of
  Australia’s biggest disability groups have urged the new NDIS minister, Mark
  Butler, to commit to co-designing a new program for mild-to-moderately
  impaired children in a joint statement on Thursday evening. It comes as state
  and territory leaders offered mixed responses to the federal government’s
  Thriving Kids proposal, which they say they were not consulted on. The joint
  statement, which was endorsed by the Australian Autism Alliance, People with
  Disability Australia, Disability Advocacy Network Australia and Children and
  Young People with Disability Australia, among other groups, said it welcomed
  the new commitment but required more information about how it would work and
  its “ambitious” timeline. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The Albanese
  government has committed to a co-design process of NDIS reform with disability
  representative groups, to ensure those with lived experience are at the centre
  of changes. Butler announced on Wednesday the federal government would commit
  $2bn to the Thriving Kids program, which will begin rolling out from mid-2026
  to children with mild to moderate developmental delays or autism. Changes to
  the access of NDIS won’t begin until mid-2027 after the new program has been
  fully established. “While Minister Mark Butler noted ‘nothing about us without
  us’ in his speech at the National Press Club [on Wednesday], the announcements
  made by the minister came as a surprise to the disability community and
  representative organisations,” the groups’ statement said. “This has created
  further uncertainty for our community. We are heartened by the government’s
  continued commitment to the NDIS, which has changed the lives of people with
  disability around Australia. “However, we are collectively disappointed that
  the government chose not to engage with the disability community about their
  announcement.” On Friday, the NSW treasurer, Daniel Mookhey, told a budget
  estimates hearing he had not been personally consulted about the program prior
  to its public announcement on Wednesday. “We want to see a lot more detail of
  what the commonwealth is asking us to do … for us to determine our position on
  what we can contribute to the Thriving Kids position,” he said. “States are
  going to need to spend more, particularly when it comes to schools as well.”
  Victoria’s premier, Jacinta Allan, and the state’s disability minister, Lizzie
  Blandthorn, both said they first learned of the proposed program when it was
  revealed at Butler’s press club address. Blandthorn told ABC Melbourne on
  Thursday it had been “disappointing” Butler still hadn’t called her about the
  program. Butler dismissed suggestions the states and territories had been left
  out of the loop on Friday morning, saying it had been on the table for almost
  two years. “It’s not true that there haven’t been discussions,” he told ABC
  Sydney. “The states and the commonwealth have been talking about this for
  almost two years now, since we were directed to do so by the prime minister
  and all of the premiers. “The report of the NDIS last week showed that the
  number of children coming on to the scheme, not only is it not slowing, it’s
  increasing. We’ve got to get about actually delivering the work that the
  premiers and the prime minister set us to do back in 2023 now, almost two
  years ago.” The Thriving Kids program is the first clear system proposed to
  offer “foundational supports” – disability support outside the NDIS – for
  those with less severe impairments, as initially proposed by the NDIS review
  in late 2023. After the review’s release, the former NDIS minister Bill
  Shorten announced foundational supports would be jointly funded by the
  commonwealth and the states and territories, and offer two streams: general
  supports for all people with disability, as well as targeted supports for
  people who are ineligible for the NDIS and for which their needs cannot be met
  through mainstream services. The government described the Thriving Kids
  program as the “first piece of work” to give shape to the foundational
  supports concept – but flagged there were others on the way. Butler said the
  next cohort the government would look at, based on the NDIS review’s findings,
  would include adults with more severe and complex mental illness.
