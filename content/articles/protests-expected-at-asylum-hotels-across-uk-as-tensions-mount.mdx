  Dozens of protests outside hotels used as temporary accommodation for asylum
  seekers are expected over the weekend across Britain amid mounting tensions
  over the issue. Figures released on Thursday showed there were more than
  32,000 asylum seekers in hotels, marking a rise of 8% during Labour’s first
  year in office. Anti-migrant protests and counter-demonstrations held by Stand
  Up to Racism are expected on Friday and over the weekend outside hotels
  believed to be used to house asylum seekers, including in Bournemouth, near
  Cardiff airport, Leeds, Perth and Aberdeen with more expected on Saturday. Two
  weekends ago, 3,000 riot police officers were deployed and put on standby when
  a series of protests were planned across England and Wales, but the National
  Police Chiefs’ Council said in a statement that “additional national
  mobilisation for protests this weekend has not been considered necessary. We
  continued to have national mobilisation plans in place to respond should the
  position change.” Meanwhile, councils across the country controlled by Labour,
  the Conservatives and Reform UK are investigating whether they could pursue
  legal challenges against asylum hotels. This follows a judge granting Epping
  Forest council a temporary injunction on Tuesday that blocked asylum seekers
  from being housed at the Bell hotel in Essex. On Friday, Yvette Cooper said
  ministers were working to close hotels housing asylum seekers “as swiftly as
  possible” as part of an “orderly” programme that avoided creating problems for
  other areas. The home secretary said: “That is the reason for the Home Office
  appeal in this case, to ensure that, going forward, the closure of all hotels
  can be done in a properly managed way right across the country – without
  creating problems for other areas and local councils.” Chris Philp, the shadow
  home secretary, said on Thursday that people had “every right” to protest over
  asylum hotels in their areas. While the number of asylum seekers rose in
  Labour’s first year, the new data shows they are still far below the 2023
  peak, when the Conservatives were in government. In a letter dated 18 August
  seen by the Guardian to the home secretary, the Broxbourne Conservative MP
  Lewis Cocking said residents were “understandably concerned at the prospect of
  an influx of unvetted men from barbaric cultures and particularly how this
  will impact the safety of women and children locally”. He asked Cooper to
  guarantee that if the Bell hotel in Epping were to close, asylum seekers from
  there would not be sent to the Delta Marriott hotel in his constituency, which
  currently accommodates asylum seeker families. Broxbourne council is
  considering a similar legal challenge to the one launched by Epping Forest
  council to try to get the hotel shut down. Labour has pledged to end the use
  of hotels to house asylum seekers by the end of this parliament in 2029.
  Cooper said Labour had taken “crucial steps” in the past year towards this by
  cutting the asylum backlog and money spent on the asylum system, increasing
  returns of asylum seekers whose applications had failed, and overhauling
  appeals. While the number of asylum seekers housed in hotels has risen,
  government spending on asylum in the UK is down 12%, data published on
  Thursday showed. The number of people waiting on an initial decision on an
  asylum application in the UK at the end of June dropped below 100,000 for the
  first time in four years. Asylum seekers and their families can be housed in
  temporary accommodation, known as contingency accommodation, if they are
  awaiting assessment of their claim or have had a claim approved and there is
  not enough longer-term accommodation available. When there is not enough
  housing, the Home Office – which has a legal obligation to provide
  accommodation to asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute – can move
  people to alternatives such as hotels and large sites such as former military
  bases. Refugee support organisations have been forced to install safe rooms in
  their premises, relocate to less visible sites and, in some cases, close their
  offices in response to the threat of far-right violence. Half of the NGOs and
  charities supporting people seeking refuge have faced threats, a “hostile
  environment” of protest, and safety concerns since the riots of 2024,
  according to research documents seen by the Guardian.
