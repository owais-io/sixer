  My friend Wally Houser, who has died aged 90, was a lawyer and sax player who
  had a massive effect on British jazz through his relationship with Ronnie
  Scott and his club. Wally met Ronnie at a gig in Manchester in the late 1950s;
  he acted for him when he signed the lease on his first club in Gerrard Street,
  London, in 1959 and was the person who identified his body after his death in
  1996. In between, he dealt with all the club’s legal affairs pro bono, played
  a key role in resolving the impasse between the UK and US musicians’ unions
  that made it difficult for Ronnie Scott’s club to book top American jazz
  musicians, and acted as babysitter to great artists who didn’t always make it
  to the stage in good nick without help. One wonderful anecdote sums it up: Ben
  Webster, the great tenor sax player, was midway through a residency at
  Ronnie’s when he was booked for a one-nighter in Paris. Wally’s job was to
  meet him off the boat train at Victoria and deliver him safely to his hotel in
  Regent’s Park. There was no sign of Ben at the exit, however, so Wally walked
  the length of the train examining every compartment; eventually he glimpsed
  the top of a trilby hat just below window level, with Ben’s rather large body
  slumped on the floor. Somehow Wally got Ben awake enough to stagger to the
  train door – and fall into the gap between the train and the platform, where
  he remained stuck. At this point a British Rail policeman appeared and began
  the process of arresting the man. When he got to: “Your name, please?” and
  Wally replied “Webster – Mr Ben Webster,” the policeman gasped and said, “Not
  the Ben Webster, the saxophonist?” All thoughts of an arrest disappeared, and
  the policeman helped Wally load Ben on to a luggage trolley and then into a
  taxi. Not all challenges were resolved so successfully, especially those
  involving the legendarily difficult Stan Getz, but Wally’s determination to
  look after Ronnie, the club and the musicians who played there never wavered.
  The club would not have survived without him. Born in Manchester to Isaac, a
  bookmaker, and Marjorie (nee Ashworth), a pianist, Wally went to school in the
  city and in the early 50s began to study law at Manchester University. To
  finance his studies he played in a band, which was managed by Jimmy Savile at
  one point. Wally later worked for Philip Ross Solicitors in London, where his
  clients included many actors and musicians. He married the actor Geraldine
  Moffat in 1971 and they had two sons. For many years Wally held the alto sax
  chair in the Stan Reynolds Orchestra, which rehearsed in west London every
  Tuesday and was greatly respected as the band’s elder statesman and linchpin.
  He was always entertaining, with an inexhaustible fund of jazz-related
  anecdotes. Wally is survived by Geraldine and their children, Sam and Dan.
