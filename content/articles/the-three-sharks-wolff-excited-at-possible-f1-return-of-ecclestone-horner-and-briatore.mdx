  and Briatore

  Toto Wolff has said he would welcome something of a Formula One supergroup
  returning to the sport in the form of Christian Horner, Bernie Ecclestone and
  Flavio Briatore potentially uniting to buy the Alpine team. When asked at the
  Dutch Grand Prix what he thought of the concept, albeit a somewhat unlikely
  proposition despite rumours persisting that Horner is interested in purchasing
  Alpine if he can obtain the substantial financial backing required, the
  Mercedes principal was all in favour. “If there was such an exciting project,
  these three guys coming together, all of the mafia reunited, that would give
  good content. The shark mafia. Three sharks,” Wolff said. Horner was recently
  sacked by his Red Bull team and Ecclestone, F1’s long-term ringmaster and
  chief executive, has not been directly involved since Liberty media took over
  the sport in 2017. Briatore is executive adviser to the Alpine team and close
  friends with Ecclestone and Horner. “That would be an exciting story and would
  create lots of buzz around Formula One,” Wolff added. “ I think we need that
  and Formula One has always been about the best racing with exciting drivers
  and great personalities. When you look back at the grand era of team owners
  and team principals around Frank Williams and Ron Dennis, Flavio, Luca di
  Montezemolo – maybe we need to work on that.” On track in first practice at
  Zandvoort, McLaren maintained their hold on the front of the field with Lando
  Norris just having the edge over his teammate Oscar Piastri by two-tenths of a
  second, on a blustery, chilly day on the North Sea coast. Rain repeatedly
  swept across the circuit, weather that is expected to remain over the weekend
  including on Sundaytomorrow, and may yet play its part in the race. Red Bull’s
  struggles remained all too clear at Max Verstappen’s home circuit, where he
  has traditionally been so strong, with three wins from the past four races.
  The Dutchman managed only sixth in first practice, almost a second off Norris
  and he also slid off track as the session closed. In the afternoon session,
  with running limited due to crashes by Lance Stroll and Alex Albon, Norris was
  again on top, eight-hundredths in front of Aston Martin’s Fernando Alonso,
  with Piastri third, Verstappen fifth and Lewis Hamilton in sixth.
