  The Studio, Seth Rogen’s cosy Hollywood satire which dropped on Apple TV+
  earlier this year, features a glut of industry figures cameoing as themselves:
  Martin Scorsese, Charlize Theron, Zac Efron, Ron Howard, Zoë Kravitz, Nicholas
  Stoller. Unless you also happen to work in the movie business, that last name
  probably won’t mean much: in the show Stoller is introduced as a reliable
  writer of kid-friendly fare – The Muppets, Captain Underpants – who can make a
  decent job of the IP-driven film (“the Kool-Aid movie”) that Rogen’s studio
  head, Matt Remick, has been forced to pursue. In real life, Stoller did indeed
  write those films. Yet he’s also a key figure in the later years of the Judd
  Apatow-abetted Frat Pack era, responsible for a number of box office hits
  including Sex Tape, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Get Him to the Greek and
  Neighbors, which starred Rogen and Rose Byrne as a couple warring with the
  fraternity next door. Pairing lowbrow farce with zingy dialogue and hapless
  beta male protagonists, these were out-and-out comedies made at a time when
  the genre occupied a significant slice of the cinematic zeitgeist. Those days
  are over, but Stoller has adapted his shtick to the requirements of the age.
  In Apple TV+’s Platonic, now returning for a second season, he teams up with
  his wife, co-writer Francesca Delbanco, for a comedy drama starring Rogen and
  Byrne, this time as two mischief-loving college pals reunited in midlife after
  a five-year falling out. Byrne is Sylvia, a married mother of three whose life
  of predictable happiness and domestic drudgery is beginning to chafe; Rogen
  plays Will, a recently divorced brewmaster who wears aspirationally quirky
  outfits and likes kicking over parked e-scooters. Platonic has a fair amount
  in common with its cinematic predecessors. It relies heavily on the likability
  of its stars and a healthy roster of eccentric supporting characters
  (including Sylvia’s eight-year-old son, who coolly suggests controversial
  true-crime documentary Dahmer for family film night) and is powered by a
  series of silly set-pieces. Season one saw the duo snatch a collar off a
  ferocious doberman, stumble round a grocery store high on ketamine, and – my
  favourite – take a tour of the abandoned nursing home Sylvia feels cornered
  into buying (very “colonial hospice, Cape Cod mortuary,” nods Will). There are
  also differences. Platonic is lightweight, comforting entertainment primarily
  focused on the gag, but it has real depth, too. During an argument, Will calls
  Sylvia “a miserable stay-at-home mom who hangs out with me to escape your
  boring life.” That’s not quite true: Sylvia’s not miserable, she’s a
  frustrated fun-lover low on self-esteem after 13 years out of the workplace.
  The show does a brilliant job of capturing that feeling of exclusion from the
  real world that often accompanies motherhood, and Byrne expertly walks the
  line between aspirational cool girl and relatably downtrodden housewife.
  Meanwhile, Will has his own struggles – namely to find love and get along with
  his colleagues at the bar they run, Lucky Penny, after they decide to
  collaborate with a cringy diner chain. Will quits in protest, believing the
  value of his beer to be inextricably linked to its non-corporate edge.
  Platonic seems curiously keen to disabuse him of his resistance to capitalist
  overlords; by the first season’s end he is working at the chain’s head office
  and engaged to the CEO, Jenna. This is where season two kicks off, with Sylvia
  organising the pair’s wedding – she’s now moonlighting as a party planner –
  while secretly hoping they will split. The pair do seem ill-matched – Will is
  a committed slacker, Jenna is an overachiever and yet quite basic (she slips
  lines from the Barbie movie into conversation). She’s also dismissive of
  Sylvia in a way that plays neatly into the motherhood theme. Platonic ranges
  from great to decent company. The leads have palpable (nonsexual) chemistry,
  and it’s always nice to watch something that is putting serious effort into
  making you laugh. Byrne is undoubtedly the comic engine, a natural clown who
  is given plenty to do; season two begins with Sylvia posing as an eastern
  European glamourpuss in order to test-drive a sports car which she repeatedly
  stalls before fleeing. Sometimes you can’t help wondering if Platonic would
  work better if its most hilarious moments were smooshed together into a lean
  comic movie rather than padded out into a flabby, 10-hour-long TV series.
  Having worked through the tensions caused by an adult male-female relationship
  in season one, the show now asks whether Will and Sylvia should continue their
  mildly dysfunctional friendship. This question doesn’t provide quite enough
  direction or dramatic substance: the storylines are circular, the bickering is
  repetitive and there’s a distinct streaming-era bagginess to proceedings.
  Still, there remains a lot to enjoy here. • Platonic season two is on Apple
  TV+.
