  New figures have revealed that one in four late-night venues in the UK have
  closed since 2020: almost 800 in total, with closures accelerating this year.
  Lobbyists have warned about the potential for “night-time deserts” without
  urgent tax cuts for nightclubs and music venues, and music industry figures
  have said that the UK’s next music superstars may have nowhere to hone their
  craft if gig venues continue to shut. We want to hear from you. How many
  venues and clubs have closed in your town in recent years? Are there any left
  at all? What opportunities are there for going out to dance or listen to live
  music? For younger people, have you ever been able to have this kind of night
  out in the place where you live, grew up or study? And amid all the doom and
  gloom, we’re interested in hearing about any signs of growth in your area:
  clubs and venues hanging on or thriving against the odds.
