  Hurricane Erin, a large category 2 storm with winds reaching 105mph, was
  slowly moving away from the North Carolina coast on Thursday morning after
  hitting the state’s Outer Banks with intense winds, large waves, storm surge
  and flooding. While Erin is not expected to make landfall, weather officials
  warn that the storm’s effects are not over yet. Coastal communities up and
  down the east coast are bracing as storm conditions continue as
  life-threatening rip currents, flooding and dangerous surf, are forecast in
  some areas through Friday. On Wednesday, North Carolina’s governor, Josh
  Stein, declared a state of emergency, deploying emergency resources and
  personnel to assist coastal communities. Mandatory evacuation orders were
  issued both for Ocracoke and Hatteras islands, with more than 2,000 people
  evacuated. By Wednesday evening, Highway 12 on Hatteras Island was closed due
  to worsening weather conditions. Photos show sections of the highway
  completely submerged in water. As of Thursday morning, the road remained
  closed. Other videos shared earlier this week showed powerful waves slamming
  into homes along the Outer Banks. The National Weather Service warned early on
  Thursday that parts of coastal North Carolina could continue to face flooding,
  storm surge and high surf throughout the day on Thursday and into Friday.
  Tropical storm conditions are also expected along parts of the Virginia
  coastline on Thursday. On Thursday morning, the NWS showed a video from
  Virginia Beach showing powerful waves. A storm surge warning remains in effect
  for parts of North Carolina, where water levels could rise two to four feet
  above ground level in some areas. “Numerous roads will likely be impassable
  under several feet of water and vehicles will likely be submerged” the agency
  said on Thursday morning. “Consider moving cars to higher ground.” The NWS
  office in Newport and Morehead City, North Carolina, said on Thursday morning
  that the “impacts will peak today” with the worst conditions expected along
  the Outer Banks during Thursday’s high tide cycles. “Significant impacts could
  linger into Friday due to lingering powerful swell energy and elevated
  tides/water levels,” the agency warned. Tropical storm conditions are expected
  in parts of Bermuda on Thursday and tropical storm-force wind gusts are
  possible across parts of the mid-Atlantic and southern New England coasts
  through early Friday, per weather officials. Hazardous beach conditions are
  also forecast up and down the entire east coast over the next several days,
  with forecasters warning of life-threatening rip currents and strong surf.
  Authorities from several states along the east coast have urged residents to
  stay out of the water, and in some states and cities, including New York City,
  the beaches have been closed to swimming. Coastal flood alerts remain in place
  on Thursday morning for low-lying coastal areas across the east coast,
  including sections of Delaware and New Jersey.
