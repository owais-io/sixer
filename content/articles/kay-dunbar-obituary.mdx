  My wife, Kay Dunbar, who has died aged 78, was a literature festival director
  and co-owner, with me, of Ways With Words, which organised and ran festivals
  across the UK from 1992 to 2022, as well as creative writing holidays in
  Italy, France and Devon, our home county. Kay had moved to Devon in 1986 to
  help set up a primary school at Dartington Hall. In 1991, seeing an
  opportunity to create a festival of literature at the historic house and
  estate, she began organising the first Ways With Words. Initially sponsored by
  the Observer, with the former editor David Astor as president, the festival
  launched in the summer of 1992 as an eight-day event of talks, readings and
  workshops, with speakers including Anthony Burgess, Andrew Motion, Fiona
  MacCarthy and Peter Ackroyd, and accommodation offered in the buildings and
  grounds of Dartington Hall. Ways With Words grew rapidly, spawning other
  festivals that we ran together, in Southwold on the Suffolk coast for 27 years
  from 1994, in Bath (1994-97), York (1997-2000), Bury St Edmunds (1995-2000)
  and Keswick in Cumbria from 2001. The festivals were marked by their
  collegiate spirit and the hospitality offered to participating authors. After
  Astor’s death, Roy Hattersley became president of the Dartington festival –
  which ran for 30 years – and Melvyn Bragg was president of the Words by the
  Water festival in Keswick. Born in Wigan, Kay was the daughter of Marion (nee
  Cunliffe), a bookbinder, and Harry Pedder, a bespoke tailor running the family
  business, and grew up in the town with a close family of aunts, uncles and
  cousins. She attended Wigan girls’ high school and studied at the Keele
  University institute of education, where she gained a certificate of education
  in English and drama. After college she moved with her first husband, Gavin
  Dunbar, to Suffolk, where both taught at Summerhill, the progressive school
  founded by AS Neill. They then moved around Hertfordshire and Essex, with Kay
  teaching in primaries and in the English department of Harlow College. Later,
  in Bishop’s Stortford, Kay had her first child, Chloë, while studying
  part-time for an MA in language and literature in education at University
  College London under Harold Rosen and the feminist historian Dale Spender. In
  1986, Kay and her family (now also including her son, Hamish) moved to
  Dartington. Both she and I had been enticed there separately by a small
  Guardian advertisement seeking teachers to help found Park school, a
  progressive primary on the Dartington Hall estate, after the closure of
  Dartington Hall school. There we met, working closely together for three
  years, and later married in 1994, after her first marriage ended. As Ways With
  Words took off, Kay gave up her teaching job to concentrate on the festival;
  Park school continues today and will celebrate its 40th birthday next year. In
  2009 Kay was awarded the Benson medal by the Royal Society of Literature and
  in 2021 made MBE for services to literature. She was diagnosed in 2019 with
  the terminal neurological condition progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP),
  which, together with Covid, led to the demise of Ways With Words in 2023. The
  Cumbrian festival still continues independently. Kay is survived by me, Chloë
  and Hamish, and her brother, John.
