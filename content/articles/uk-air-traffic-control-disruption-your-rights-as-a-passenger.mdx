  Wednesday’s air traffic control technical fault came as many thousands of
  families prepared to head off on their summer holiday. Those whose flights
  have been disrupted have significant rights and entitlements in relation to
  everything from refreshments to refunds. Is your flight delayed or cancelled?
  If your flight is significantly delayed – the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA)
  explains how this is defined on its website – you are entitled to care and
  assistance while you wait, which means food and drink and the ability to make
  phone calls, plus accommodation and the necessary transfers if the flight is
  delayed until the next day. Many airlines will provide vouchers for you to buy
  food and drink, and overnight accommodation will typically take the form of a
  nearby hotel. Sometimes airline staff are unable to arrange care and
  assistance for all passengers, in which case you can sort yourself out, and
  claim the cost back later. But do not head straight to a posh restaurant or
  five-star hotel. The CAA says: “If you end up paying for things yourself, keep
  every receipt and do not spend more than is reasonable. Airlines are unlikely
  to refund you for things like luxury hotels or alcohol.” Some airlines will
  provide guidance on reasonable costs. If your flight has been cancelled and is
  covered by UK law (that means one departing from an airport in the UK on any
  airline, or arriving at an airport in the UK on an EU or UK airline, or
  arriving at an airport in the EU on a UK airline), your airline must offer you
  the choice of an alternative flight or a refund. If you select an alternative
  flight, it is up to you whether to fly as soon as possible or at a later date.
  In terms of a refund, you can get your money back for all parts of the ticket
  you have not used. So if you have booked a return flight and the outbound leg
  is cancelled, you can get the full cost of the return ticket back from your
  airline. Once you decide to take a refund, or to travel later than the first
  available flight, your airline has no obligation to provide you with food,
  drink or accommodation. I am due to fly tonight/tomorrow – should I still go
  to the airport? Naomi Leach, the deputy editor of Which? Travel, advises: “If
  you are due to travel today or tomorrow, check the advice from your airport or
  tour operator, or airline apps and airport social media feeds, for the most
  up-to-date advice.” Will I be entitled to compensation? While airlines have a
  duty to look after their passengers when flights are disrupted, they do not
  have to put their hand in their pocket when the disruption is caused by
  “extraordinary circumstances”. Leach says that if your flight is cancelled or
  delayed as a result of these latest problems, you are unlikely to be owed
  compensation by the airline. This is because the technical issue affecting
  flights will be considered an extraordinary circumstance and out of the
  airline’s control. The CAA says that “if it wasn’t the airline’s fault, don’t
  expect to receive any compensation”. My flight is part of a package deal – can
  I still go away? If your flight is delayed or cancelled and it is part of a
  package holiday, you have some additional protections, says Abta. If your
  holiday ends up being cancelled, or new arrangements are made that result in a
  significant change to your holiday, then your travel company must offer an
  alternative holiday if it can, or a refund for the full price of your package
  holiday. Generally, a change of more than 12 hours on a fortnight’s holiday is
  considered a significant change, it says. Can I claim on my travel insurance?
  Your first point of contact should probably always be the airline. However, in
  situations where the disruption is beyond the airline’s control and – for
  example – you are unable to travel or are stranded at your destination, you
  may be able to claim on your travel insurance, depending on the level of
  cover. “Beyond the flight itself, certain costs like non-refundable hotel
  stays, hire car expenses or even pre-booked activity fees may be recoverable
  under specific circumstances,” says Alex Cross, the chief customer officer at
  Tesco Insurance. However, he adds that it is crucial to understand your
  policy’s coverage. If in any doubt, contact your insurer for more details.
