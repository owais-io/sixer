  They are supposed to monitor you throughout the working day and help make sure
  that life is not getting on top of you. But a study has concluded that
  smartwatches cannot accurately measure your stress levels – and may think you
  are overworked when really you are just excited. Researchers found almost no
  relationship between the stress levels reported by the smartwatch and the
  levels that participants said they experienced. However, recorded fatigue
  levels had a very slight association with the smartwatch data, while sleep had
  a stronger correlation. Eiko Fried, an author of the study, said the
  correlation between the smartwatch and self-reported stress scores was
  “basically zero”. He added: “This is no surprise to us given that the watch
  measures heart rate and heart rate doesn’t have that much to do with the
  emotion you’re experiencing – it also goes up for sexual arousal or joyful
  experiences.” He noted that his Garmin had previously told him he was stressed
  when he was working out in the gym and when excitedly talking to a friend he
  had not seen for a while at a wedding. “The findings raise important questions
  about what wearable data can or can’t tell us about mental states,” said
  Fried. “Be careful and don’t live by your smartwatch – these are consumer
  devices, not medical devices.” Fried said although there was a lot of academic
  work looking for physiological signals that can act as proxies for emotional
  states, most were not precise enough. This is because there is an overlap
  between positive and negative feelings – for example, hair standing on end can
  signal anxiety as well as excitement. Fried, an associate professor in the
  department of clinical psychology at Leiden University in the Netherlands, and
  his team tracked stress, fatigue and sleep for three months on 800 young
  adults wearing Garmin vivosmart 4 watches. They asked them to report four
  times a day on how stressed, fatigued or sleepy users were feeling before
  cross-referencing the data. And the results, published in the Journal of
  Psychopathology and Clinical Science, found that none of the participants saw
  the stress scores on their watches meet the baseline for significant change
  when they recorded feeling stressed. And for a quarter of participants, their
  smartwatch told them they were stressed or unstressed when they self-reported
  feeling the opposite. The relationship with physical fatigue, described by
  Garmin as “body battery”, was “quite a bit stronger than for stress but
  overall quite weak” said Fried. Garmin does not disclose the calculations it
  uses to work out the body battery score, though he suspected it was a
  combination of a pulse measurement and activity levels. The relationship with
  sleep was stronger again, though Fried noted it measured sleep duration and
  told us little about how well rested someone was, other than the fact there
  tended to be a relationship between how long you slept and how well rested you
  felt. There was a significant association between the Garmin and self-reported
  data for two-thirds of the sample for sleep. The researchers noted that in
  nearly all cases, if participants went from one day of self-reporting bad
  sleep quality, to another day with a good score, they could predict an
  increase in sleep duration on the Garmin of around two hours. “This is a
  really noticeable effect,” they said. The research is intended to feed into an
  early warning system for depression, in which wearable tech users receive data
  that will help them receive preventive treatments before an episode begins. So
  far, there are promising signs that lower activity levels could be a
  predictor, though Fried has been unable to identify whether this is because of
  exercise’s protective effect against depression or because people feel less
  energetic as their mental state deteriorates. “Wearable data can offer
  valuable insights into people’s emotions and experiences, but it’s crucial to
  understand its potential and limitations,” said Margarita Panayiotou, a
  researcher at the University of Manchester, after reading the study. “This
  research helps clarify what such data can reliably reveal and makes an
  important contribution to ongoing discussions about the role of technology in
  understanding wellbeing. It’s important to remember that wearable data does
  not necessarily represent objective truth and should be interpreted alongside
  broader context, including individuals’ perceptions and lived experiences.”
  Garmin has been approached for comment.
