  As you board the plane, the flight attendant welcomes you on board. They point
  you to your seat and help with your luggage, before giving the safety
  demonstration, and preparing the plane for take-off. And there’s a good chance
  they’ve done it all for free. But a tentative deal between Air Canada and
  thousands of flight attendants has sparked hope more airlines will end a
  little-known reality for many North American cabin crews – and pay flight
  attendants when planes are not moving. “The Air Canada strike helps
  negotiations everywhere,” Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight
  Attendants (AFA)-CWA, which represents about 55,000 flight attendants at 20
  different airlines said in a statement. “It defined the problem of ridiculous
  expectations for flight attendants to work without pay.” Over 10,000 flight
  attendants at Air Canada walked off the job last month, in a battle with
  management that centered on pay during boarding and unboarding of flights. The
  three-day strike at Canada’s largest carrier snarled global summer travel,
  prompted the country’s government to force binding arbitration and led to a
  tentative deal that includes at least 60 minutes of ground pay before each
  flight, at 50% of a flight attendant’s hourly rate. The demonstrations by
  workers, and concessions by Air Canada on pay, “place additional pressure on
  management everywhere to get real in negotiations”, added Nelson. Air Canada
  indicated it will gradually increase the pay of flight attendants for an hour
  before flights on narrow-body jets, and 70 minutes on larger, wide-body
  aircraft, reaching 70% of full wage for ground work within four years –
  dashing flight attendants’ hopes of full compensation for this work, but
  shifting away from the established practice of no pay until flights are in
  motion. Bea Bruske, president of the Canadian Labour Congress, says the
  agreement could serve as a foundation for a “new norm” across the continent.
  “This deal becomes the new standard,” she said, after the deal was agreed,
  “because … other unionized flight attendants that have the ability to demand
  better at the bargaining table will be looking at this collective agreement to
  say, ‘we want that, too’.” Airline employees in the US are covered under the
  Railway Labor Act, which doesn’t mandate direct hourly pay, unlike the Fair
  Labor Standards Act, which covers most other public and private sector
  workers. For a generation, flight attendants for most airlines across North
  America have not been paid for their work during boarding of planes. Delta Air
  Lines became the first big carrier to change this in 2022, in the midst of a
  union organizing drive. Alaska Airlines and American Airlines followed. United
  Airlines has indicated it stands ready to do so, too, although a tentative
  agreement was voted down in July, with bargaining under federal mediation set
  to recommence in December. Things are changing. “Air Canada and its flight
  attendants agreed on a formula for ground pay that is over and above what
  Delta introduced in 2022, and what American and Alaska have agreed since,”
  said John Gradek, an aviation expert and business professor at McGill
  University in Montreal. The deal will probably influence contract negotiations
  for WestJet flight attendants in 2026 in Canada, added Gradek, and may provide
  a window for United flight attendants to secure better boarding pay deals,
  too. ‘Most of our passengers have no idea’ “We’re working more, we’re working
  harder, and we’re not getting enough pay to make our bills every month,” said
  Jen Sala, a longtime flight attendant at Frontier Airlines who serves at
  president of its AFA union. “Flight attendants deserve to be paid for every
  single hour we work. Airlines shouldn’t be able to pick and choose the hours
  that they pay their employees.” Around 4,100 flight attendants at Frontier
  Airlines voted last September to authorize a strike with 99.6% in favor, as
  they have been fighting for a new contract since 2023 that includes boarding
  pay for flight attendants. The union is currently in federal mediation with
  the airline. Frontier Airlines did not respond to multiple requests for
  comment. “We can fly upwards of 15 hours in a day and only get paid for three
  and a half. Our flight attendants don’t make a living wage,” said Becky Black,
  a flight attendant for nearly 22 years at PSA Airlines, which operates flights
  for American Airlines. “We have a flight attendant who lives in a homeless
  shelter. We have flight attendants that are living in crew rooms. We have
  flight attendants who are 30 years old and have to move back in with their
  parents because they can’t afford to live with this job. “Most of our
  passengers have no idea that we are only paid from the time the door closes
  until the door opens.” Unlike flight attendants directly employed by American,
  flight attendants working for PSA are not paid until the plane door is closed
  and the pilot releases the parking brake. Black, a member of the PSA’s union
  negotiating committee, is one of 1,500 flight attendants at the airline who
  have been in negotiations for a new union contract for two years, with
  negotiations currently under mediation. Flight attendants at PSA are expected
  to report 45 minutes prior to a flight, and have to arrive at the airport
  earlier to get through security screening, Black said. Their pre-boarding
  procedures, including safety checks and boarding passengers, take at least an
  additional 30 minutes. “We’ve been on duty, but we haven’t been getting paid
  yet. We get paid for the flight time. And when we land and the door opens, we
  stop getting paid at that point, and we do the deplaning,” Black said. “Our
  time does have value, and we do deserve to be paid for what we’re doing. And
  that’s where the boarding pay comes in.” The union representing flight
  attendants at the airline authorized a strike with a 99.2 % vote last
  September, and have held several picket demonstrations since to raise
  awareness and support for securing boarding pay and wage increases that align
  with other American flight attendants in their union contract, as PSA flight
  attendants are paid 40 to 45% less than flight attendants directly at
  American. “We’re there to hold your hand when you’re afraid of flying, to talk
  to you or hold your hand when you’re traveling to a funeral for a loved one,
  to save your life if you’re having a heart attack in the middle of a flight,
  or to put out a fire,” said Black. “We’re there to evacuate the airplane in 90
  seconds to make sure that you all get off safe and get to your family. And
  we’re not asking for much. We’re just asking for respect, to be respected for
  the job that we do for American Airlines, and to have a livable wage.”
  American Airlines did not respond to multiple requests for comment. PSA
  Airlines did not comment on the boarding pay issue. “We share the same goal as
  our flight attendants to get a deal done,” said a spokesperson. “With the
  support of the National Mediation Board, we continue to meet regularly with
  the AFA and have made progress toward reaching an agreement that our flight
  attendants deserve.”
