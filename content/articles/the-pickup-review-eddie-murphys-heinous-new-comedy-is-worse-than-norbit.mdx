  The Pickup is easily the worst Eddie Murphy movie in recent memory. That’s
  right: worse than A Thousand Words, the Liar Liar ripoff so underwhelming that
  Murphy had to take a break from making comedies. And worse than Norbit, the
  Nutty Professor ersatz probably costing him the Oscar for Dreamgirls. At least
  in those comedy clunkers, Murphy came to play. He made clear either through
  advanced prosthetics or through sheer force of personality that he could
  deliver a satisfying performance no matter the premise – or, better still:
  elevate hackneyed material. But in this straight-to-Prime Video snoozefest
  Murphy struggles to hide his age and boredom while looking for all the world
  like a hostage in his own heist flick. It takes work to make Murphy entirely
  unfunny, and this film manages the job one-handed. It surrounds him with a
  playful cast: Eva Longoria, a true all-rounder; Pete Davidson, the SNL
  stitch-up; and Keke Palmer, maybe the funniest woman of her generation. But
  then it delivers them a script written by two guys – Kevin Burrows and Matt
  Mider – best known for a web series about anthropomorphic lobsters. It all
  comes together in 90 of the longest minutes you’ll ever spend in front of a
  screen, provided you even make it that far. At this late career stage, Murphy
  is at his best when leaning into nostalgia – whether replaying the hits
  (Coming 2 America, Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F) or indulging his inner child
  (Dolemite Is My Name, Candy Cane Lane). But The Pickup doesn’t even get that
  right. Instead it has Murphy playing Russell, an armored messenger counting
  down the days until retirement in a set-up seemingly ripped from the first
  Lethal Weapon. Then there’s Davidson as Travis, the doofus partner who nearly
  shot up a bank after misreading a random come-on as a robbery attempt. And
  while his instincts weren’t completely off – his seducer, Zoe (Palmer), winds
  up stripping him of privileged security information – they do ultimately leave
  him and Russell vulnerable to a hijacking while making rounds in their armored
  truck. Naturally, that sets up phase 2 of the plan – an overwrought copy-paste
  of Oceans 11. At one point Zoe chalks up her heist plans as just another big
  score in our otherwise compromised capitalist system. But that line isn’t as
  eye-roll inducing as the implication of romantic chemistry between Zoe and
  Travis, which the film is at pains to hammer home with a nod to Davidson’s
  rumored BDE. To watch Murphy throw drop-kicks, launch dye packs and otherwise
  fend off robbers is to be reminded of Murphy’s increasing reluctance to
  perform his own stunts at age 64. During the press run for Axel F, he joked
  about rebuffing director Mark Molloy’s call to run down a set of steps with
  greater urgency. “Don’t call me unless you’re offering me the same type of
  shit you would offer Morgan Freeman,” he cracked. In fact, the film’s action
  sequences overall beggar belief. Longoria pops up in the middle of the action
  like Taraji P Henson at the end of Acrimony. Russell ejects one of Zoe’s
  henchmen from his speeding armored truck on to another car trailing just
  behind; he crashes back-first on to the hood, caroms on to the highway and
  somehow lives to fight another day. Worse, bullets fly all over the place –
  and yet the only one that really lands winds up taking out the chop shop owner
  played by Marshawn Lynch, a football legend with a pronounced history of
  repelling unwelcome aggression. Oh, and they had the nerve to name Lynch’s
  character Chop Shop without nodding at that absurdity. They didn’t give him
  any funny lines or make much effort to punch up the truck depot manager
  portrayed by Andrew Dice Clay – you know, the comedy legend who played to a
  sold-out Madison Square Garden crowd not long after Murphy set the standard.
  The waste of comedic talent here borders on criminal, but not as severe as
  commissioning Ruth Carter to render the pedestrian costumes. All of it will
  leave you wondering if director Tim Story, the same comedy boffin who gave the
  world Barbershop, Ride Along and The Blackening – had this picture hijacked
  out from under him. Or maybe he was just keen to show how many cars he could
  blow up in one frame? Early on in the film, as the buddy cops settle into the
  getting-to-know-you stage, Russell shares his gauzy plan to open a bed and
  breakfast upon retiring, and Travis balks at the career shift. Technically, he
  tells Russell: “Your generation can’t pivot,” but it feels like he’s speaking
  directly to Murphy – who should’ve known better than to pick up a full-on
  action comedy script at his big age. This film isn’t likely to do significant
  long-term damage to his beloved reputation, not with his turn as Inspector
  Clouseau coming down the pike. But those who do brave his heist flick won’t
  soon forget the time they were taken prisoner, too. The Pickup is out on
  Amazon Prime Video on 6 August
