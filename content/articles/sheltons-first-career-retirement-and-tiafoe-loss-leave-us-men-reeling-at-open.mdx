  It was a punishing Friday afternoon for American men’s tennis as Ben Shelton
  and Frances Tiafoe were bundled out of the US Open less than an hour apart,
  leaving only Taylor Fritz and Tommy Paul still standing in the singles draw.
  Shelton, the No 6 seed and one of the leading contenders to end the United
  States’ 22-year wait for a men’s grand slam champion, was forced to retire
  from his third-round match against France’s Adrian Mannarino with a shoulder
  injury. It was the 22-year-old’s first career retirement, coming as he led by
  two sets to one before disaster struck late in the third. After landing
  heavily on his left arm while stretching for a ball, Shelton grimaced and told
  his father and coach, Bryan: “I did something to my shoulder. I don’t know
  what it is.” He later admitted the pain was “really high” and said: “I’ve
  never retired before. I’m not a guy who would retire if I could continue.”
  Despite a mid-set visit from the physio and a tactical switch that saw him
  attempt 13 serve-and-volley plays in the fourth set alone, he could not
  protect his advantage. Mannarino leveled the contest and, as the crowd braced
  for a decider, Shelton bowed his head on the changeover and called it off. The
  Frenchman advanced 3-6, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, ret. Shelton left Louis Armstrong
  Stadium with his shoulder wrapped in ice, a towel over his head and fighting
  back tears. Still, he struck a philosophical tone: “I was playing really well,
  I was in form, a lot of confidence … but I’ve got a lot to be grateful for.
  You won’t hear me pouting about how bad things are with the summer that I’ve
  had.” For the 37-year-old Mannarino, ranked 77th in the world, it was a
  bittersweet breakthrough: his first win over a top-10 opponent at a major in
  23 attempts and his first appearance in the second week of the US Open. He
  will face the Czech No 20 seed, Jiri Lehecka, for a place in the
  quarter-finals. If that setback was not dispiriting enough for the home crowd,
  Tiafoe soon followed. The 17th seed, a semi-finalist in New York in two of the
  past three years, fell flat against German qualifier Jan-Lennard Struff before
  an overflow crowd on the Grandstand court. The 35-year-old struck 14 aces and
  never allowed Tiafoe to find rhythm, closing out a 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 (9) upset to
  reach the last 16 here for the first time. “I played extremely passive today.
  I didn’t put any pressure on him at all,” Tiafoe said. “It’s going to be hard
  to swallow how I played today and being out of the US Open this early. I
  haven’t been this down in a very, very long time.” He also bemoaned the quick
  conditions on Grandstand, saying he was “late on everything” and never found
  his timing. Struff, who had already toppled the No 11 seed Holger Rune,
  extended an unlikely run after failing to win a match at Flushing Meadows
  since 2020. His reward could be a fourth-round meeting with Novak Djokovic,
  who was due to face Cameron Norrie in Friday’s night session. For Tiafoe, it
  marked his earliest exit in New York since 2019. The American had not even
  realized Shelton had retired until told in his press conference. “That always
  sucks to go out like that,” he said. “Especially in a grand slam [in a match]
  where he was probably going to win.” The twin blows leave just two American
  men standing. Fritz, last year’s runner-up in Queens and a Wimbledon
  semi-finalist in July, was scheduled to play Swiss qualifier Jérôme Kym on
  Friday night. Paul, a 2023 Australian Open semi-finalist, had survived a
  five-set epic against Nuno Borges that ended in the early hours of the
  morning. Andy Roddick’s 2003 triumph remains the most recent men’s major title
  for an American. On a bruising afternoon in Queens, the odds of that drought
  coming to an end next week narrowed considerably.
