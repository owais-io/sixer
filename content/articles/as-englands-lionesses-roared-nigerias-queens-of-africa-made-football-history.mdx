  Hello and welcome to The Long Wave. On Sunday, depending on which hemisphere
  you live in, you are likely to have seen or heard about a squad of supremely
  talented women pulling off a remarkable comeback to bring home silverware to a
  proud country. Congrats to England’s triumphant Lionesses, who retained the
  Euros trophy. But here, it’s all about Nigeria’s Super Falcons. I checked in
  with Eromo Egbejule, our west Africa correspondent, to talk about last
  weekend’s electric Women’s Africa Cup of Nations (Wafcon) final, which Nigeria
  won for the 10th time. A nail-biting finale Like all great matches, the final
  had the burden of heavy expectation bearing down on it. The stakes were
  greater than just claiming the trophy: for Morocco, it was about winning on
  home turf, in front of families and thousands of supporters. The squad, which
  seemed on the brink of another global tournament watershed after the men’s
  team reached the semi-final of the World Cup for the first time, were in pole
  position for most of the match. The Atlas Lionesses were winning 2-0 until the
  64th minute before conceding three goals, the last one a devastating two
  minutes before the final whistle. Despite the sense that Morocco’s moment had
  finally come, Nigeria’s Super Falcons raised the trophy again. It was their
  10th from a total of 14 tournaments – a dominance, which had been interrupted
  three years ago by South Africa, providing ample motivation this time out. So
  intense is the rivalry between Nigeria and South Africa that Eromo says the
  Super Falcons’ victory over Banyana Banyana in the semi-final had “felt like
  the final”. The reception in Nigeria was, of course, celebratory. People are
  “definitely, definitely happy”, Eromo says. “The Falcons have always been
  popular because they are very very dominant.” But a new element of this
  tournament has widened their appeal: social media. “A couple of players have
  been posting on Snapchat,” Eromo says, which has brought the team closer to a
  new generation of supporters. Of those players, Michelle Alozie, right back
  and also, remarkably, a cancer research technician, is such a prolific poster
  that she came under fire for her “unserious” habit. After Nigeria won, she
  uploaded a story from the pitch with the caption “now let me post in peace”.
  It was the first African tournament outing for Alozie and the MVP of the
  final, Esther Okoronkwo, both of whom have large social media followings. ***
  What makes the Super Falcons so super? Eromo ascribes Nigeria’s success to two
  factors. The first is simply a head start – Nigerian women’s football
  developed at an international level earlier than other African countries. And
  Nigeria, in general, was one of the early African movers. (I am of the
  generation that still remembers, with cinematic detail, the heartbreaking
  Italian goal that denied Nigeria a historic spot in the men’s World Cup
  quarter-finals in 1994.) The other factor is one that Eromo describes as a
  mental edge. “Nigerians thrive in chaos,” he suggests, half in jest and half
  with a sort of national pride, in reference to a playing style that bewilders
  and scatters the strategic plans of their opponents. The rest, he says, can be
  attributed to living in the diaspora: Nigerian players have acquired valuable
  experience while playing for teams in Europe and the US. Some of the Super
  Falcons form part, or have been part, of teams such as Paris FC, Barcelona and
  Houston Dash. *** Winners – but not without challenge Despite the emphatic
  win, Eromo insists it was not business as usual. “During the first couple of
  games, Nigeria did all right – but then it was hard. You could tell that other
  teams were stepping up.” Indeed, Equatorial Guinea have won the trophy
  previously, as have South Africa, and then Morocco flew to the final, buoyed
  up by their home crowd. Now Nigeria’s dominance is no longer a sure thing and
  other African countries are making big investments in their teams and in
  women’s football in general. Eromo says Morocco, in particular, are developing
  quickly, thanks in part to a sports sector that pays players well at a local
  league level. And so it is among a trio of strong challengers to Nigeria. ***
  Where there is football, there is politics Eromo suggests the one factor
  curdling that “definite, definite” happiness is how some in Nigeria are a bit
  hesitant about the country’s president appropriating the win as good PR for
  his unpopular leadership. Bola Tinubu asked the Super Falcons to bring the
  trophy to Abuja so he could welcome them home – all of which seems “natural to
  do”, Eromo says. But it is seen as “the president trying to whitewash his
  performance”, which includes economic policies that have not trickled down.
  “More people are hungrier than ever, and the security situation is still in
  chaos. There’s a lot of state propaganda floating around. This is seen as
  another example of Tinubu trying to gain goodwill ahead of the next election.”
  This is a moment that should belong to the Super Falcons and, in a wider
  sense, African women’s football. Every tournament introduces a new crop of
  talented players to the continent, and overshadows what are usually more
  dominant western competitions. I mention to Eromo that the Wafcon final took
  place within the same 24 hours as the Women’s Euro competition. “To be honest,
  I didn’t know the Euros final was even on until I started hearing about
  another Michelle,” he says. Not Alozie but Michelle Agyemang, the England
  forward of Ghanaian descent who was named young player of the tournament. The
  big week of women’s football was truly a global, diasporic affair. To receive
