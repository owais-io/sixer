  The far-right activist Tommy Robinson will not face charges over allegations
  he punched a man to the ground at a London train station, police and
  prosecutors have announced. Robinson, whose real name is Stephen
  Yaxley-Lennon, was arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm after the
  incident on 28 July at St Pancras train station. The alleged victim, 64,
  refused to provide a statement to detectives from British Transport Police who
  investigated the case, the force said. BTP said: “Following a report of an
  assault at St Pancras station on 28 July, detectives from BTP quickly launched
  a full and thorough investigation, which involved a 42-year-old man being
  arrested on suspicion of GBH at Luton airport on 4 August. “Officers worked at
  pace to gather evidence, including CCTV footage and witness statements,
  however the victim did not wish to provide a statement to the investigation.
  “We presented the prosecution file to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) –
  who are responsible for considering the evidence available and deciding
  whether it meets the legal threshold to charge someone with an offence.
  “Following a review of the available evidence, the CPS concluded that there
  was not a realistic prospect of conviction and therefore there would be no
  criminal charges in this case.” It is understood that police had clear CCTV
  images of the clash, but the man did not support a prosecution. The Guardian
  understands that the CCTV video showed the man – whom police called the victim
  – following Robinson for at least 20 seconds before the punch was thrown,
  leaving him motionless on the ground. Robinson was backing away, it is
  understood, when the man was punched. Shortly after the incident, video was
  posted on social media from the scene, which showed a 64-year-old man on the
  ground and Robinson appearing to claim he had acted in self-defence. The
  alleged victim has a right to appeal against the decision not to prosecute.
  That is thought unlikely, given he has so far not assisted detectives with a
  statement and made clear he did not want to attend court to give evidence. The
  CPS said: “We received a file of evidence from British Transport Police in
  relation to an allegation of assault at St Pancras Railway station on 28 July.
  “Following a careful review of the evidence provided, we have concluded that
  our legal test for prosecution has not been met. We have informed all parties
  involved of the decision.” Hours after the incident at St Pancras, Robinson
  took a flight out of Britain, landing first in Tenerife, Spain. Once abroad,
  he went from Tenerife to Faro in Portugal, flying back to the UK on 4 August,
  where police were waiting for him. The injured man was taken to hospital where
  he spent two days. Police said he was admitted “with serious injuries which
  are not thought to be life-threatening”. Robinson is a former leader of the
  extreme-right English Defence League. The far-right monitoring group Hope Not
  Hate describes him as the “best-known far-right extremist in Britain”.
