  Kamala Harris, the former vice-president and 2024 Democratic presidential
  nominee, announced on Wednesday that she will not run for governor of
  California – a highly anticipated decision that leaves the contest to lead the
  country’s largest blue state wide open. “For now, my leadership – and public
  service – will not be in elected office,” Harris said in a statement, ending
  months of speculation about her political future after losing the 2024
  presidential election to Donald Trump. “I look forward to getting back out and
  listening to the American people, helping elect Democrats across the nation
  who will fight fearlessly, and sharing more details in the months ahead about
  my own plans,” she added. Harris, 60, who previously served as California’s
  attorney general and US senator, had been exploring a run for the state’s top
  job since leaving the White House in January. But, she said in the statement,
  “after deep reflection, I’ve decided that I will not run for governor in this
  election”. The decision does not rule out a future run for public office,
  including a third bid for the White House, after unsuccessful campaigns in
  2020 and 2024. Among the other possibilities Harris is exploring is starting a
  non-profit or leading a policy thinktank, said a person familiar with her
  thinking. Allies said she would be a sought-after surrogate and fundraiser
  ahead of the 2026 midterms. “I think we can expect her to continue to
  invigorate the younger generation who really vibed off of her energy, her
  authenticity, and, you know, her willingness to talk about things that you
  don’t normally talk about when you’re on the campaign trail,” said the
  California congresswoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove, one of the Democrats Harris
  spoke with in recent months as she weighed a run for governor. Harris’s
  looming decision had in effect paralyzed the race to replace Gavin Newsom, the
  term-limited Democratic governor, with early polling suggesting she was
  Californians’ top choice. The Harris-less race to lead California will now
  take place in a political landscape dramatically reshaped by her loss to Trump
  in November, which plunged the party into a period of paralysis and
  soul-searching. In the months since, the Democratic base has grown
  increasingly furious with its old guard, demanding fresh leadership and a more
  combative approach to what they view as Trump’s increasingly authoritarian
  agenda. In a nod to the discontent roiling her party, and the country, Harris
  said: “We must recognize that our politics, our government, and our
  institutions have too often failed the American people, culminating in this
  moment of crisis. As we look ahead, we must be willing to pursue change
  through new methods and fresh thinking – committed to our same values and
  principles, but not bound by the same playbook.” While the decision was
  disappointing to supporters eager to see Harris square off again with Trump
  during the final years of his term, Harris had given few signals that she was
  deeply excited by the prospect of leading the state from the governor’s perch
  in Sacramento. The months-long slog to next year’s contest would have forced
  Harris to grapple with her role in Democrats’ losses in November, which has
  already drawn criticism from corners of the party eager for leaders to step
  aside and make space for a new generation of candidates. The crowded field of
  Democrats running for governor in California is so far made up of long-serving
  or well-known political leaders, including Xavier Becerra, the former attorney
  general of California who served with Harris in Biden’s cabinet as the
  secretary of health and human services; Antonio Villaraigosa, the former
  Democratic mayor of Los Angeles; the state’s lieutenant governor, Eleni
  Kounalakis, who is close friends with Harris; and the former representative
  Katie Porter. The most prominent Republicans in the race are Chad Bianco, the
  sheriff of Riverside county, and Steve Hilton, the former Fox host and former
  adviser to then UK prime minister David Cameron. Ric Grenell, a longtime Trump
  ally, has also toyed with the idea of running. In a statement, Villaraigosa
  commended Harris’s leadership and said that her decision “reflects her
  continued commitment to serving at the highest levels of government”. Becerra
  described Harris’s decision as an “important turning point for her and our
  state” that would reshape the “race for governor, but not the stakes”.
  “California needs a governor who will treat the cost of living crisis like the
  emergency it is, and who will stand up to the chaos and corruption of the
  Trump White House,” he said in a statement. Meanwhile, Newsom, who came up in
  San Francisco politics with Harris, also praised the former vice-president.
  “Kamala Harris has courageously served our state and country for her entire
  career,” he said. “Whether it be as a prosecutor, attorney general, senator,
  or vice-president she has always kept a simple pledge at the heart of every
  decision she’s made: For the People. Grateful for her service and friendship –
  and looking forward to continuing the fight in whatever the future might hold
  for her.” Republicans – some of whom had been eager to elevate Harris as the
  face of the Democratic party – nevertheless touted her decision as a political
  victory for the president. “Kamala Harris’s political career is over thanks to
  President Trump,” said Kollin Crompton, a spokesperson for the Republican
  Governors Association, adding, perhaps prematurely: “Americans across the
  country can sigh in relief that they won’t have to see or hear from Kamala
  Harris any longer.” Harris had maintained a relatively low profile since she
  returned home to Los Angeles, offering few clues about her political future.
  She remained mostly out of view as protests erupted in response to the Trump
  administration’s immigration raids in Los Angeles earlier this summer. In a
  statement issued after Trump ordered national guard troops deployed Los
  Angeles, she said that protest was “a powerful tool” and said she supported
  the “millions of Americans who are standing up to protect our most fundamental
  rights and freedoms”. She has been selective about when to weigh in against
  the Trump administration’s actions. Earlier this year, Harris delivered a
  sharp speech in which she warned that the US was witnessing a “wholesale
  abandonment of America’s highest ideals” by the US president. On Wednesday,
  Harris vowed to remain politically engaged. “We, the People must use our power
  to fight for freedom, opportunity, fairness, and the dignity of all,” she
  said. “I will remain in that fight.” Dani Anguiano contributed to this report
