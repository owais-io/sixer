  Murray-Darling

  Environmental flows in the Murray-Darling necessary to keep wetlands and fish
  healthy have come to an abrupt halt due to a legal stoush between the
  commonwealth and the New South Wales government. The commonwealth
  environmental water holder, Simon Banks, announced on Monday that he would no
  longer be releasing water into the river system because “as a model licence
  holder” he was no longer confident he was complying with NSW law. Australian
  National University’s Prof Jamie Pittock warned a suspension posed potential
  risks to some wetland areas and native species of fish and birds. Although the
  Murray-Darling basin has good levels of water, scientists said the CEWH had
  been planning to release pulses of environmental water that would set up areas
  like the Ramsar-protected Macquarie Marshes for dry years ahead. Pittock, who
  is also a member of the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists, said
  environmental watering occurred on a multi-year cycle and wetter years, such
  as the current one, were used to water harder-to-reach wetlands. “In the
  wetter years the idea is to push the water further out into some of the
  wetlands that are harder to reach like black box and coolibah forested
  wetlands,” he said. “They occur in bands depending on the elevation of the
  flood plain and they might only get water one year in 10. “If you miss this
  wet period to push that water into those harder-to-reach wetlands, they’ll be
  less resilient when the dry years return.” Releasing environmental water is
  also a key strategy to encourage fish breeding in the lower parts of the river
  system because the river system is so altered by dams, weirs and irrigation.
  “If this pause on watering lasts into spring the danger is we miss this year’s
  trigger for the native fish to get active and breed,” Pittock said. The latest
  standoff between the commonwealth and the NSW government appears to be due to
  a legal advice relating to how environmental water releases should be
  interpreted under NSW non-urban water metering policy. At the heart of the
  dispute is whether environmental water should be treated as “take” in the same
  way as water extracted by irrigators and comply with metering rules.
  Irrigators are required to meter their “take” from the system, usually via
  pumps or channels at a single point in the river. Environmental water
  licences, in contrast, often use the water by leaving it in the system where
  it is gradually used as it moves down the river and into wetlands. Banks said
  the pause “temporarily” had become necessary as a result of changes to how NSW
  was interpreting the law in its water sharing policies, adding that he had not
  received a copy of the legal advice the NSW had sought. He said the change had
  “introduced significant complexity and uncertainty, impacting our ability to
  deliver commonwealth environmental water in NSW”. “Compliance is a core
  priority for the CEWH,” Banks said. “As one of the most heavily regulated
  water users in the Murray-Darling Basin, we are committed to acting as a model
  licence holder. The CEWH team is working diligently to find a resolution. “We
  will only proceed with our watering actions once we are confident all our
  obligations are met under the current interpretation of NSW rules.” Mel Gray,
  a water campaigner at the Nature Conservation Council of NSW, said the
  situation was “unprecedented”. “This delay of critical water for the rivers is
  a result of a system that has been designed to prioritise irrigators over
  environmental water,” she said. The NSW Greens water spokesperson, Cate
  Faehrmann, said it was “deeply concerning” environmental flows had been
  suspended while “jurisdictions debate basic terminology”. “The Minns
  government must treat this as a top priority, including addressing any
  confusion that has led to this freeze on environmental watering to ensure that
  it can resume in the earliest possible timeframe,” she said. A spokesperson
  for the NSW environment and water department said the government was “taking
  important steps to ensure all water is effectively and transparently accounted
  for”. “Environmental water holders, in an abundance of caution, have suspended
  delivery of some environmental water in order to ensure they remain within the
  law,” they said. “We have discovered a technical issue in the way the NSW
  Water Management Act is drafted, which we are working to resolve.”
