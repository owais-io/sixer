  Senior CDC vaccine research and public health leaders who resigned in protest
  told hundreds of supporters across the street from the campus on Thursday that
  the Trump administration needs to “get politics out of public health”. The
  agency is reeling from the firing of the CDC chief, Susan Monarez, but
  Monarez, who was confirmed as CDC chief just a month ago, has refused to be
  removed. Three senior leaders – Debra Houry, Demetre Daskalakis and Daniel
  Jernigan – resigned shortly after in protest, citing the alleged spread of
  misinformation under the Trump administration and political interference in
  their work. The staffers cheered and applauded them at the event on Thursday.
  “You are the people that protect America, and America needs to see that you
  are the people that protect America, and we are going to be your loudest
  advocates,” said Daskalakis to the throng. Daskalakis, who was accompanied at
  the rally by Houry and Jernigan, is now the former director of the National
  Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases and is known for his
  leadership in HIV prevention and vaccination programs and the Biden
  administration’s response to the mpox outbreak. The three, plus Jennifer
  Leyden, who led the office of public health data, resigned together on
  Thursday to make a statement about the damage the administration had done to
  public vaccine research, and in protest of the administration’s response to
  vaccine disinformation, they said. “We agreed to do this together. We’ve been
  talking about it for months, and the past few days, it was just escalating,”
  said Houry, the CDC’s former chief medical officer. “If one of us retired, it
  would have been a blip. When the three of us do it together, it’s more
  powerful and just shows the state of our agency.” She and the others are
  asking for Congress to intervene, to put a stop to political interference in
  the organization’s work. The agency is overseen by the US health secretary,
  Robert F Kennedy Jr, who in recent days restricted the use of Covid vaccines
  for Americans and has removed scientific advisers and cut funding for medical
  research. Kennedy has reportedly tapped the deputy health secretary, Jim
  O’Neill, an investor in libertarian billionaire Peter Thiel’s orbit, as the
  CDC’s interim leader. Monarez was the first CDC director in 50 years to not
  hold a medical degree. O’Neill would be the second. The staff and supporters
  of the CDC gathered across the street from the campus in Atlanta, and Houry,
  Daskalakis and Jernigan were met with applause and handshakes, a marked
  difference from this morning when they were escorted off campus. “They are
  essentially trying to undo a lot of the science that has been settled for
  vaccine policies,” Jernigan said. The dismissal “was a tipping point for us
  that we had to say we’ve got to do something. We need to get the politics out
  of public health. We need to make sure that we’re using objective science in
  the making of vaccine and other treatment decisions. Until we can do that and
  get back to that, ideology will be just driving the policies rather than the
  science driving the policies.” The turmoil at the CDC comes as the agency is
  still recovering from the attack of a gunman who fired more than 500 rounds
  into the Atlanta offices before killing the DeKalb county police officer David
  Rose. More than two weeks later, the White House had said nothing about the
  shooting, Houry said. Staffers were “concerned about speaking about vaccines
  in our science because they’re worried they’ll be targeted”, she said. “That’s
  unacceptable … This was an act of domestic terrorism. They need to address
  this.” The shooting has done more than shake up the staff. The community is
  questioning whether their lives are valued by the federal government, said Dr
  Jasmine Clark, an Emory University professor of microbiology and state
  representative in the suburbs north of Atlanta, who is running for Congress.
  The speed with which the event was organized – not a walkout, more like a long
  lunch – spoke to the sentiment in the building, she said: “So many people in
  my community said they feel like no one values their life, and what am I doing
  when I go to work every day? It’s a privilege that people have no idea what
  happens in that building, and the fact that they don’t know means they’re
  doing a good job. But unfortunately we have an administration that does not
  value that work and in fact actively devalues the work and spreads
  misinformation that cost the life of Officer David Rose.”
