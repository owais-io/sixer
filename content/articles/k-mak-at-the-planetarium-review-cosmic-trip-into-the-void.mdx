  ‘I’ll leave you with the cosmos,” Australian singer Kathryn McKee – or K Mak –
  whispers dreamily at the start of this ethereal but oddly muted gig. A globe
  of light emerges and vaguely spacey projections beam around the band as their
  electro-classical orchestration soars into life. From there, with no other
  interaction with the audience, the show struggles to gain much velocity.
  Freeze any moment of this performance and the snippet of synth-infused
  symphony you catch will have an otherworldly beauty. But in the room, with the
  band squashed awkwardly against the back wall so as to be caught in the
  projection’s light, the energy is halting. The action feels untethered from
  the space we occupy together, neither party quite sure what to expect from or
  offer the other. The instruments are an easy extension of their players, the
  irrefutably accomplished musicians on drums, violin and cello sometimes
  closing their eyes as they lose themselves in the mournful music. The voice of
  K Mak, who is also on keys, comes to us first with heavy synths, her voice
  high and alien, her lyrics taking effort to unpick. Then she strips back the
  modulations to give us her voice unfiltered, her just-discernible words of
  love and longing making it equally possible that she’s speaking as a person as
  she is a star. Behind the performers, psychedelic projections veer from micro
  to macro, from abstract and tangible, with globular molecules and rushing
  comets colliding as if tilted through a kaleidoscope. These trippy visuals
  have the most impact when they feel tailored to the music, a burning flame
  around a black hole pulsating in time with the beat of a drum. But moving on
  to images of bouncing jellyfish and unfurling flowers, they begin to seem
  compiled at random. Losing any connection to outer space, they threaten to tip
  into the abstract bounce of a desktop screensaver. The music may be cosmically
  calming, but this performance lacks the intensity required to either truly
  ground or transport you. At Summerhall, Edinburgh, until 24 August All our
  Edinburgh festival reviews
