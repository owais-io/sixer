  Good morning. The US House of Representatives oversight committee yesterday
  released thousands of pages of records related to the disgraced financier and
  convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein from the department of justice. The
  Trump administration has been embroiled in months of controversy over its
  decision not to release additional files in the case. Epstein died by suicide
  in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges and was alleged to
  have abused hundreds of girls. The 33,000 pages included years-old court
  filings related to Epstein and his former girlfriend and associate Ghislaine
  Maxwell, as well as what appears to be bodycam footage from police searches
  and police interviews. Is there anything new in them? The files appear to
  contain information that is already public knowledge. What has Donald Trump
  said? Trump, a longtime friend of Epstein and part of his rich and powerful
  social circle, has, in recent weeks, tried to avoid the subject. Earlier this
  year he sued the Wall Street Journal for its reporting on his relationship
  with Epstein. Xi Jinping says world faces ‘peace or war’, as Putin and Kim
  join him for military parade Xi Jinping said the world was facing a choice
  between peace or war as he held China’s largest-ever military parade, joined
  by Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un in a show of defiance to the west. Putin and
  Kim, the authoritarian leaders of Russia and North Korea, were among dozens of
  world leaders who attended the parade, a big display of military hardware and
  personnel, orchestrated to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the second
  world war, which China calls the war of resistance against Japanese
  aggression. What did Xi say? “Today, humanity is again faced with the choice
  of peace or war, dialogue or confrontation, win-win or zero-sum,” Xi told the
  crowd of more than 50,000 spectators, adding that the Chinese people “firmly
  stand on the right side of history”. Who else was there? Kim’s daughter made
  her first international public appearance in Beijing, adding to speculation
  that she is being groomed to become the first female ruler of North Korea.
  Pedro Sánchez: Europe and the west’s response to war in Gaza has been a
  failure Europe and the west’s double standards over the wars in Ukraine and
  Gaza threaten to undermine its global standing, the Spanish prime minister,
  Pedro Sánchez, has said, describing the response to Israel’s assault on the
  Palestinian territory as one of the darkest episodes of international
  relations in the 21st century. In an interview with the Guardian before talks
  with the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, in London today, the socialist
  leader said the US under Donald Trump was trying to end the post-second world
  war, rules-based global order it had originally created. What else did he say?
  He defended the benefits of migration and blamed traditional rightwing parties
  for breaking the consensus over the response to the climate emergency by
  copying the policies of their populist rivals. In other news … Mohsen Mahdawi,
  a Palestinian student and a permanent resident of the US, has returned to
  Columbia University, more than four months after being arrested, detained and
  nearly deported by the Trump administration for his activism. Google will not
  be forced to sell its Chrome browser, a federal judge ruled yesterday in the
  tech company’s continuing legal battle over being ruled a monopoly last year.

  Hawaii’s Kīlauea volcano resumed erupting yesterday, firing lava 330ft (100
  meters) into the sky from its summit crater. It’s the 32nd episode of the
  volcano releasing molten rock since December 2024, when its current eruption
  began. Don’t miss this: Meet the revenge quitters who are ditching their jobs
  and refusing to go quietly The phenomenon of “revenge quitting”, where
  frustrated or unhappy employees show how they really feel about their
  workplaces, is on the rise. From marching bands to TikTok takedowns, employees

  it opens new doors, they tell Sammy Gescoyler. … or this: Why trans art

  Climate check: Trump team’s contentious climate report ‘makes a mockery of
  science’, experts say A group of leading climate scientists in the US have
