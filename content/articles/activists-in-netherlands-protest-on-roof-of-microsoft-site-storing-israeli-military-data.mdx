  Activists in Netherlands protest on roof of Microsoft site storing Israeli
  military data

  Activists have staged a protest on the roof of a Microsoft datacentre in the
  Netherlands after revelations the Israeli military is storing large volumes of
  data in the country. Images posted on social media showed some of the
  activists blocking access to the large Microsoft facility in the north-west of
  the country on Sunday, while others scaled the building’s roof and lit flares.
  The group, Geef Tegengas (Push Back), said its protest was in response to a
  recent Guardian investigation that revealed how the Israeli military
  surveillance agency Unit 8200 has used Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform to
  store a vast collection of intercepted Palestinian phone calls. The joint
  investigation with the Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and
  Hebrew-language outlet Local Call found that Microsoft’s Azure servers in the
  Netherlands have held large volumes of Israeli military data. Leaked Microsoft
  documents suggest that by July this year 11,500 terabytes of Israeli military
  data, equivalent to approximately 200m hours of audio files, was stored in
  Azure’s servers in the Netherlands. In a statement, the activists said they
  were “calling on all employees of the datacentre to lay down their work until
  all Israeli intelligence has been removed from the servers”. The Microsoft
  facility, a 14-hectare campus located near Middenmeer in the North Holland
  province, is part of a global network of datacentres used to store Azure
  customers’ data. Disclosures about the Israeli military’s reliance on the
  Netherlands-based datacentres prompted questions in the Dutch parliament this
  week at an emergency parliamentary debate about Israel’s war on Gaza. During
  the debate, Christine Teunissen, an MP for the leftwing Party for the Animals,
  asked the government how it would prevent data held in the country from “being
  used to commit genocide” in the besieged Palestinian territory. Caspar
  Veldkamp, the Dutch foreign minister, said in response he does not know
  exactly what information is available, but he would “request further
  investigation”, adding: “If there are serious indications of criminal offences
  in that information, legal proceedings can of course be initiated, and that is
  then up to the public prosecution service.” Responding to the investigation
  this week, Microsoft said it had “no information” about the kind of data
  stored by Unit 8200 in Azure. “At no time during this engagement [with Unit
  8200] has Microsoft been aware of the surveillance of civilians or collection
  of their cellphone conversations using Microsoft’s services,” a spokesperson
  said. On Saturday, the Guardian reported that senior Microsoft executives are
  scrambling to assess what data Unit 8200 holds in Azure and are concerned that
  its staff in Israel may have concealed key details about its work with the
  unit. A spokesperson for the Israeli military previously said its work with
  Microsoft is based on “legally supervised agreements” and the military
  “operates in accordance with international law, with the aim of countering
  terrorism and ensuring the security of the state and its citizens”.
