  Eddie Howe has admitted he does not know what is going to happen next after
  Liverpool had a bid for Alexander Isak turned down by Newcastle on Friday. The
  striker has made it clear he wants to leave this summer and is particularly
  keen on a move to Anfield. Newcastle, meanwhile, are understood to have made
  an offer worth around €75m (£65.5m) for the RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.
  On Saturday, they announced the signing of the goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale from
  Southampton on a season-long loan. Liverpool have had a £110m bid for Isak
  rejected after their sporting director, Richard Hughes, made an enquiry about
  the Sweden international’s availability to Newcastle two weeks ago. Newcastle
  value Isak at £150m. “I am very much removed from everything that is happening
  back home,” Howe said in Seoul, where Newcastle are due to play Tottenham on
  Sunday. “I was made aware there was a bid yesterday. That bid was turned down
  before I heard about it. “There are people back in England dealing with the
  situation. I really don’t know what is going to happen next, but we still
  support Alex in every way. My wish is still that we see him in a Newcastle
  shirt again.” Isak has not been part of the club’s pre-season tour of Asia,
  which Newcastle said was due to a minor thigh injury. However, the 25-year-old
  has been training at his former club Real Sociedad in Spain this week. “I know
  where he is through the media, so it’s difficult for me to go into any
  detail,” Howe said. “The situation is far from ideal. It is quite complex.”
  Isak, who has scored more than 20 Premier League goals the past two seasons,
  has three years left on his contract. There has been no progress on a new
  contract for him. Newcastle are yet to line up a replacement for Isak. They
  are reported to have made a formal bid of €75m (£65.5m) plus €5m in add-ons to
  RB Leipzig for Sesko. That is said to match Leipzig’s valuation, but
  Manchester United are also targeting the forward. “We are looking for the best
  players that we can get,” Howe said, refusing to comment on Sesko
  individually. “Whatever our target position is, we’re looking for the best.
  That’s the only way we’re going to get to where we want to go, which is to
  maximise, and it’s quality over quantity. It always has been.” Newcastle’s
  opening offer for Yoane Wissa was rejected by Brentford last month, while they
  were beaten to the signing of Eintracht Frankfurt’s Hugo Ekitiké by Liverpool.
  “It’s been a challenging summer,” Howe said. “We’ve missed out on various
  targets for loads of different reasons. But we’re still very competitive and
  we’re still in there trying to bring very good players to the club and that
  won’t change until the window shuts.” Newcastle have endured a difficult
  pre-season with defeats to Celtic (4-0), Arsenal (3-2) and the K-League All
  Stars (1-0). The Denmark Under-21 striker Will Osula, who scored twice last
  season, started all three matches in Isak’s absence. After facing Tottenham in
  Seoul, Newcastle will play Espanyol and Atlético Madrid at St James’ Park
  before starting their Premier League campaign at Aston Villa on 16 August.
  Ramsdale arrives, Wilson joins West Ham Newcastle have secured the signature
  of Aaron Ramsdale on loan from Southampton until the end of the season. In a
  World Cup year, the England goalkeeper has opted for a move away from the
  Championship side and will play under his former manager Howe at St James’
  Park. “Working with the manager and his coaching staff again were a big draw
  for me,” Ramsdale said. “They’ve already had a great influence on my career
  and the gaffer turned me from a man into a professional footballer at
  Bournemouth. He really showed me the ropes, so the manager and his coaching
  staff were a huge selling point for me to come here.” The former Newcastle
  striker Callum Wilson, meanwhile, has signed for West Ham on a 12-month
  contract, having been released at the end of last season. The 33-year-old
  scored 49 goals in 130 appearances for the Magpies before his contract expired
  this summer. “I’m excited to be joining a massive football club like West
  Ham,” said Wilson. “A club that shares a similar passion to mine: hard work,
  dedication, and also I strive for success so I’m glad to be a part of it.
  “There’s such talent within the squad. And obviously the gaffer [Graham
  Potter] has come in now, he’s making everybody a team – all working in the
  same direction to achieve the goal which is to be finishing as high as
  possible in the league.”
