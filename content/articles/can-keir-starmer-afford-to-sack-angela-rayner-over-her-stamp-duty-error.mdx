  Keir Starmer has a hard-won reputation for ruthlessness when it comes to
  dispensing with ministers who cause the government embarrassment. But the
  future of his deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, is the toughest call of
  its kind. Every time Starmer has been confronted with this kind of decision
  since the very early days of his leadership, his instinct has been to cut
  loose. But his praise for Rayner was extravagant at prime minister’s questions
  and sympathetic about her family circumstances that led to the error on stamp
  duty. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, has refused to join the chorus calling for
  her resignation. So might Starmer break the habit of a lifetime and back his
  beleaguered deputy? Scholars of recent history may suggest otherwise. Starmer
  has always chosen the most brutal possible path when a minister or aide’s
  standards fall short. The Labour leader set himself up as the polar opposite
  of his then Tory opponent, Boris Johnson, who defended Priti Patel despite a
  conclusive bullying inquiry, or Robert Jenrick’s links with property
  developers – and who eventually came a cropper over his defence of Chris
  Pincher after an alleged groping incident. Within his first few months as
  leader, Starmer brushed aside any early efforts towards party unity: he fired
  his leadership rival Rebecca Long-Bailey for tweets endorsing a controversial
  interview with Maxine Peake and later removed the whip from Jeremy Corbyn
  after the EHRC’s investigation into antisemitism. But Starmer has been just as
  harsh with his allies; the transport secretary, Louise Haigh, was forced to
  resign despite her having disclosed a fraud conviction to him many years
  earlier. He also oversaw the departure of loyalists such as Tulip Siddiq from
  the Treasury, over questions on her connections to her aunt’s Bangladeshi
  regime, and Rushanara Ali, the homelessness minister, because of her
  arrangements as a landlord. None of those tests come close to what Starmer now
  faces in terms of his deputy. Rayner and Starmer have had bitter differences,
  including in the aftermath of Hartlepool byelection when Starmer’s own
  position was under threat and his furious strategists saw she was poised to
  take advantage. She has long had a target on her back from the rightwing
  press, from allegations over the sale of her council home – later cleared – to
  her exuberant declarations of Tory “scum” at late-night Labour conferences.
  But at this moment of peril for Rayner, she is fortunate to be in a relatively
  powerful position. She has become the standard bearer for the party’s left –
  despite being a relative moderate and distrusted by former Corbynites – who
  has agitated for higher wealth taxes and pushed through major reforms to
  housing and employment rights. She is the authentic working-class voice that
  Labour has otherwise found it hard to engage and articulate for the wider
  public. She is popular with the party grassroots and an obvious electoral
  asset. On the LabourList cabinet rankings, Rayner is the second-most popular –
  behind just Ed Miliband. And it was just weeks ago that Rayner saved the
  government from the almost total collapse of authority – as she urged No 10 to
  make more concessions to welfare rebels, knowing they would otherwise lose the
  vote in the Commons, putting Starmer’s position as prime minister at risk. At
  that point it looked as if she had never been more powerful. Though Starmer
  and Rayner are not natural allies, the two have grown closer in recent years.
  Starmer sees her strengths as a communicator and he is effusive in praising
  her in interviews. The prime minister clearly believes there is much to
  sympathise with in the family circumstances – her divorce, her trust for her
  disabled son – which led to this error. Such affection does not extend to many
  of his more hardline aides in No 10, who have long seen her as a liability. It
  is no exaggeration to say that if Rayner were any other cabinet minister, her
  resignation would be a foregone conclusion. There is a very recent precedent.
  Nadhim Zahawi was sacked as Tory party chair after he failed to disclose that
  HMRC was investigating his tax affairs. So to stand by Rayner would be a
  change in form for Starmer – though there would be reasons to do so, beyond
  sympathy with her personal circumstances. As deputy leader of the party,
  Rayner has her own mandate from the membership. That makes her removal as
  deputy leader not in his gift and her job as deputy prime minister far more
  complicated. A move against her would further worsen Starmer’s relations with
  his own MPs and members. But he would have the power to remove her as housing
  secretary. Should she go, Rayner is not only the candidate of the party’s left
  who may one day seek to succeed Starmer – she is also the candidate of many of
  the party’s women who feel it so acutely that Labour has never had a female
  leader. Out of office, she could galvanise opposition to Starmer’s faltering
  leadership among backbenchers in a way none of her departing predecessors have
  ever managed.
