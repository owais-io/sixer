  The chancellor and prime minister will begin to prepare the ground for tax
  rises and reforms from September as part of a strategy to prepare the country
  for a difficult budget that could be held in November, the Guardian has been
  told. Although Treasury sources have insisted Rachel Reeves will stick to her
  pledge not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT, senior Whitehall
  sources said that she and Keir Starmer had begun a series of meetings to
  thrash out the shape of the budget. A rise in gambling levies – advocated by
  the former prime minister Gordon Brown – is thought to be near-guaranteed as
  part of the package of tax rises. The pressure facing the government was
  underlined on Thursday when the Bank of England warned that it could be forced
  to keep interest rates at higher levels for longer than previously thought as
  soaring food prices linked to Labour’s tax increases threaten to drive
  inflation to 4% this year. The central bank cut interest rates to their lowest
  level in two years but warned Britain was facing a toxic cocktail of sluggish
  growth, rising unemployment and stubbornly high inflation. Reeves and Starmer
  have held talks over the past weeks to begin to set the parameters of the
  budget and the economic narrative before Labour’s conference. The government’s
  limited options were further emphasised this week when the National Institute
  of Economic and Social Research said “moderate but sustained” tax rises would
  be needed in the budget for Reeves to overcome a deficit of £41.2bn and
  restore a near-£10bn buffer. No date has been set for the budget, which was
  held last year on 30 October, but government sources expect that it will be in
  November, giving the chancellor a little longer to prepare for controversial
  tax rises or cuts – as well as hoped-for improvements in growth. Advisers
  believe that a “no surprises” approach will be crucial to prevent negative
  market reaction. “Last year was a model of how to do it,” one said. “Had we
  done it otherwise, it would have been a mess.” Sources pointed towards the
  early signs Reeves gave to the markets more than a month before her budget
  last year that she planned to change her fiscal rules around borrowing to
  invest – and said there would be a similar approach this time. However, Labour
  was roundly attacked by business leaders afterwards for failing to warn about
  a £25bn increase in employer national insurance contributions (NICs), with
  companies including Tesco and Boots warning that it would raise their costs by
  £7bn and lead to higher prices and job cuts. Starmer has spent the week in
  Chequers meeting key aides and ministers as he begins work on his conference
  speech. The prime minister is understood to be keen to spend much of the
  summer thinking about the longer-term major structural problems in the UK
  economy that the party failed to identify before the election: the sources of
  low economic growth and productivity. Strategists also believe that the budget
  should be a moment to make the argument that Britain must now make serious
  choices on growth and productivity. They say Starmer must forcefully rebut the
  charges that the poor state of the economy is down to individual tax and spend
  choices, but is a sign of the weakness of the economy’s fundamentals. The
  budget, they believe, should be a moment to set out the hard road of reforms
  to tackle those issues. Reeves and Starmer are understood to have agreed some
  broad principles for the budget and the Treasury will begin to submit ideas to
  Downing Street towards the end of the month. But sources close to Reeves said
  she is unmoved on her two main pledges – there will be no rise in income tax,
  national insurance or VAT and no change to the fiscal rules. One tax rise that
  is near certain is a change to gambling levies, despite a massive lobbying
  offensive by the industry. Brown has urged Reeves to spend funds from raising
  taxes on parts of the gambling industry on lifting the two-child benefit cap,
  a measure likely to be made even more expensive by higher inflation. In one of
  its closest decisions since its independence more than 25 years ago, the
  Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) voted by 5-4 to cut its key base rate
  by a quarter point to 4%. Taking borrowing costs to the lowest level since
  March 2023, a cut was widely expected in financial markets. However, the
  decision was a close call, with the rate-setting panel for the first time in
  history holding two votes before reaching its verdict. Andrew Bailey, the
  Bank’s governor, said: “We’ve cut interest rates today, but it was a finely
  balanced decision. Interest rates are still on a downward path, but any future
  rate cuts will need to be made gradually and carefully.” Reeves sought to
  claim credit for the cut, as she claimed Labour’s economic management had
  helped Threadneedle Street to reduce borrowing costs five times from a peak of
  5.25% in August last year. “The stability we have brought to the public
  finances through our plan for change has helped make this possible,” she said.
  However, the MPC warned tax-raising measures in the chancellor’s first autumn
  budget had contributed to the rekindling of inflationary pressures hitting
  shoppers in the pocket across the country. Bailey warned that rising inflation
  could delay further rate cuts in future. “I do think the path continues to be
  down,” he said. “[But] the path has become more uncertain because of what
  we’re seeing.” City investors pared their bets for the timing of future rate
  cuts, with financial markets expecting a next quarter-point move in February
  and only one more similar reduction before the end of 2026. Reeves said
  reducing child poverty was a priority of the government but did not commit
  that any money from higher gambling levies would be spent on removing the
  two-child limit. The child poverty taskforce is expected to be released before
  the budget this autumn. “I talk to Gordon [Brown] regularly, and saw him last
  week when I was in Scotland,” Reeves said on Thursday. “Like Gordon, I am
  deeply concerned around the levels of child poverty in Britain. No child
  should grow up hungry or parents not be able to afford the basics for their
  family. “On gambling taxes, we’ve already launched a review into gambling
  taxes. We’re taking evidence on that at the moment, and again, we’ll set out
  our policies in the normal way, in our budget later this year.” Inside No 10
  and the Treasury there was fury at the predictions of a £51bn hole in Reeves’
  budget by the NIESR thinktank, which aides say is impossible to calculate at
  the moment given that the budget could be another four months away. But there
  are fears in other parts of government about how boxed in the government has
  become, when Reeves has also appeared to rule out a wealth tax. “I am at a
  loss really how they square the circle,” one Whitehall source said. “It will
  have to be salami slicing small pieces here and there, when what we should do
  is bite the bullet.” At the Bank of England’s press conference on Thursday,
  the MPC singled out fast-rising food prices as it warned that food price
  inflation was on track to reach 5.5% before the end of the year. It attributed
  much of the rise to global factors, including increasingly extreme weather
  events hitting cocoa and coffee harvests, highlighting the dangers from the
  climate emergency. However, it also pointed to “material” rises in employment
  costs and new charges for recycling packaging, both driven by the government,
  that were being passed on to shoppers by UK supermarkets. “In addition to
  global agricultural commodity prices, domestic labour costs are currently an
  important driver of food price inflation,” the Bank said. Business leaders had
  warned that Reeves’s £25bn increase in employer NICs and a 6.7% rise in the
  “national living wage” from April would force them to cut jobs and put up
  prices. Official figures show unemployment has crept higher in recent months,
  while the economy shrank in April and May. Inflation has also risen by more
  than expected, reaching 3.6% in June.
