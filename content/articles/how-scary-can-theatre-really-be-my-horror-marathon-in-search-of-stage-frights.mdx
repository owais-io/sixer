  I am a wimp. When my friends used to gather to screech over horror movies
  after school, I would sit watching Countdown with one of their mums until it
  was over. I had to watch The Blair Witch Project with all the lights on and I
  never got through the opening scene of The Ring. But when it comes to horror
  on stage, I’ve rarely been fazed. Bar the odd jump scare, how scary can
  theatre really be? I set out to find out by watching a full day of horror
  shows at the Edinburgh fringe. I start off gently with Elysium, a winding
  eat-the-rich tale told through lilting song. The gated community of Elysium
  Court is designed to keep the riff-raff out, but the inhabitants should be
  more worried about what they’re locking in. With the air of two friends
  casually making music in their garage, Milly Blue and Jessie Maryon Davies of
  Ghouls Aloud unpack the concept that exclusivity equals safety, watching from
  a distance as the containment crushes everyone in Elysium Court into the same
  make and model – or destroys them if they attempt to stand out. Blue’s
  storytelling is sweet and unsettling, though occasionally veers off into
  tangents that don’t serve the story. Davies laces tension through with moody
  piano, with Blue looping her voice in climbing harmonies above, as strange
  events begin to haunt Elysium’s newest resident. Digging into the soil beneath
  the standard-issue astroturf that clamps down every garden in the Court, old
  monsters start to emerge. The darkness creeps in slowly and the script wants
  tightening, with some songs pausing the action rather than driving it on, but
  I decide I like my horror being sung to me. Maybe this was the problem all
  along. From the candy-pink satire of Elysium, the pitch-black Scatter: A
  Horror Play couldn’t be a sharper shift. The room is so dark it’s a struggle
  to even find your seat. This low lighting continues as Patrick McPherson’s
  jaw-clenching show of hereditary haunting reserves any bright light for
  blinding flashes. Liberally smattered with jump scares, the show sometimes
  leans so heavily on Will Hayman’s intense shadows and sharp, saturated filters
  that the design comes to feel like the main event rather than an anchor to
  sink us deeper into the story. McPherson plays Tom, a young man reluctantly
  recounting the trip he and his brother took to scatter their father’s ashes in
  rural Wales. In the predictably traumatising process, they discover that their
  dad’s end-of-life aggression, previously brushed off as delirium, was
  something far more sinister, his acts of violence actually a deeply troubled
  form of protection. Jonny Harvey’s direction makes repeated use of the classic
  torch sweeping around a blackened room and heavy, breathless silences followed
  by piercing, sinew-shaking screams. These old tricks are effective. I sink
  into my seat every time the torch winds up. A traditional folk horror, Scatter
  takes itself seriously. You can’t help wondering if the balance of tension
  would intensify if some lightness was buried anywhere in the text; McPherson’s
  performance, though convincing, starts off dour and stays similarly severe
  throughout. The ending is rushed, but Scatter sets out to scare, and it
  succeeds. As we pick our way out of the theatre, my heart takes a moment to
  return to its regular pace. Later that afternoon, in another about-turn, Jed
  Mathre does a stellar job of making a whole room want to punch him in the
  face. Melanie Godsey’s existential comedy, Sponsored By the Void, offers a
  queer awakening through the form of a supernatural visitor. Mathre plays the
  emotionally illiterate boyfriend to Leah (Kelly Karcher) who is so
  overburdened by his uselessness that she’s close to bursting. When The Void
  (Jennifer Ewing) waltzes in, Leah is immediately felled by her hot dom energy
  and her demand that Leah does exactly what she wants. “Do you eat?” Leah asks
  her, quivering. “I devour,” The Void replies. Created by Seattle-based company
  The Co-Conspirators, this goofy, sultry sci-fi horror revels in Leah’s
  uncompromising newfound confidence, with Kennedy looking on in horror and
  Leah’s friend Val (Be Russell, funny to her bones) watching with delight as
  she rejects everything she has previously accepted without resistance.
  Subservience to men is the real horror here. Eschewing subtleness, the play
  asks direct questions of how a woman can get trapped into a role she never
  asked for, and how she can – with support of a sexy, suited-up otherworldly
  entity – break her way out of it. “I just want you to know what you’re getting
  into,” David Alnwick says as he pops his head around the door, checking we’re
  not actually here for the musical cabaret going on upstairs, before leaping to
  the side of the stage to fiddle with the video setup. Where a handful of these
  horror shows use film to enhance the spookiness, Alnwick’s The Dare Witch
  Project is the only one to rely on it. Soldiering through technical issues,
  our eager host talks us through the footage he supposedly found in an old VHS
  he got off eBay. The man in the recordings looks surprisingly like him, with
  his clothes and his voice, and a determination to complete a challenge
  inspired by the infamous found-footage movie The Blair Witch Project. While
  most of the tension from this Free Fringe show comes from the screen, as
  Alnwick presents these clips of the mysterious doppelganger recording himself
  in the woods, there is a singular, inspired physical magic trick used to
  beautifully creepy effect. The looping inevitability built into the show
  mounts tension as we wait, nervously, for what we know is coming, but it takes
  too long to get there to truly shake any nerves. I find myself wanting to be
  more scared than I am. Perhaps I’m becoming a horror convert after all. The
  last show of the evening is the least terrifying. Maria Teresa Creasey’s
  toothless attempt at a vampiric comedy-horror, Degenerate, begins ominously,
  as the writer-performer lies face-down, bound and gagged, waiting for one of
  us to untie her. But that’s the end of the innovation. Pitched as
  experimental, Creasey’s babbling speech acts like a fly being swatted,
  scattily returning to a smattering of ideas but never settling long enough to
  offer a performance worth our time. Hazily buzzing around the notion of women
  being deemed irrelevant as they age, Creasey’s character eventually flits
  towards the eternal youth of the vampire and lip-syncs to clips of scary
  movies. She wants to last for ever. I’m glad this performance does not.
  Elysium is at Gilded Balloon at Appleton Tower until 24 August; Scatter: A
  Horror Play is at Underbelly, Cowgate, until 24 August; Sponsored By the Void
  is at Greenside @ Riddles Court until 16 August; David Alnwick: The Dare Witch
  Project is at PBH’s Free Fringe @ Voodoo Rooms until 24 August; Degenerate is
