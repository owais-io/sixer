  passport

  When Danny bought tickets to see Deftones in Crystal Palace Park he was not
  expecting to be initiated into an apparent subterfuge. Yet shortly before the
  south London gig, Viagogo, the resale platform that sold him the tickets, sent
  him a scanned copy of a passport ID page belonging to a Dutch man he had never
  met. A Viagogo staff member told Danny to flash the document if asked by door
  staff for the ID of the “lead booker”. “It felt like we were being asked to
  take part in a deliberate deception,” said Danny, who asked for his name to be
  changed. “I know it’s not the world’s biggest crime but I run a business and
  it’s not a good look.” Danny’s experience underscores the difficulties fans
  face amid opaque and questionable business practices in reselling tickets for
  UK events, as Labour closes in on a long-promised clampdown on the industry.
  He was not the only one who received the ID instruction. In an apparent breach
  of data protection laws, Viagogo mistakenly copied him into an email with
  several strangers, all of whom received a link to the same scanned passport.
  The reason for this curious pre-gig ritual is that Ticketmaster, the primary
  ticket agent for the Deftones gig, had expressly forbidden unauthorised resale
  in its terms and conditions. To get round this, evidence seen by the Guardian
  indicates, Viagogo arranged the sale on its own platform. Viagogo then appears
  to have told the seller to send the tickets through Ticketmaster’s own
  transfer systems, which are intended for groups of friends to share tickets
  between them at face value. But the face on the passport was not a friend of
  Danny’s. In fact, according to a ticketing expert, Reg Walker, the seller was
  a well-known tout and prolific user of ticket-buying “bots”, software deployed
  to harvest tickets illegally and resell them for big profits. “It [the sale]
  is potentially a fraud offence because if the buyer gets stopped, they may not
  be let in,” said Walker, who works with venues to stop touts. He said the use
  of bots to bypass limits on how many tickets could be purchased also
  constituted fraud. Danny and his friends were not challenged at the turnstile
  and were able to see the band. Not everyone who buys a resold ticket is so
  lucky. Kieran Maguire, an author and academic specialising in football
  finance, is no stranger to market forces. He was desperate to see Fontaines DC
  in London’s Finsbury Park, so he bought a ticket from Viagogo for £92,
  including fees. On the day of the gig, just as he was about to buy his train
  ticket to London, Viagogo told him the ticket was not available after all.
  “I’d noticed by now that tickets were on sale [on Viagogo] for £200,” said
  Maguire. “I’m not daft, I know what probably happened. The vendor is now able
  to sell it for more so they’ve withdrawn it and made it available to somebody
  else. The feedback I saw was that it had happened to quite a few people. “I
  count myself lucky compared to people who might have come from overseas and
  booked a hotel.” Viagogo does reimburse the cost of tickets when it fails to
  deliver them but not extra costs such as accommodation and travel. The company
  said it apologised for failing to provide tickets after the sale “fell
  through” and said Maguire received a full refund. “The rules, as they work at
  present, are completely anti-fan and encourage a touting culture,” said
  Maguire. Viagogo said it had strict anti-fraud measures in place and denied it
  encouraged a touting culture. But the existing culture, and the rules that
  angered Maguire, may be about to change. Earlier this year the government
  opened a consultation on capping for-profit resale at between zero and 30%,
  making good on Labour’s general election manifesto. Resale at face value plus
  a service charge, such as through Ticketmaster’s internal system and
  third-party providers such as Twickets, would be unaffected. To many fans, as
  well as to music industry figures, the choice facing the government is a
  no-brainer, particularly given the resale industry’s chequered history. The
  Guardian has previously uncovered evidence of how resale sites can be used by
  professional touts, some of whom scoop up tickets through illegal methods,
  such as using bots, multiple IDs and even employing people to masquerade as
  separate customers to bypass ticket limits. Having skipped the long online
  queues, the touts then exploit fans’ disappointment and desperation to charge
  huge mark-ups. A recent analysis of more than 1,000 ticket listings by the
  telecoms company and venue sponsor O2 uncovered mark-ups of between 100% and
  1,149% on gigs by acts including Billie Eilish, Oasis and Diana Ross. Such
  profits create incentives for dubious practice. In the past few years members
  of several powerful tout networks have been jailed after making millions of
  pounds by committing multiple frauds, including via prominent resale sites.
  Anti-touting campaigners continue to uncover evidence of so-called speculative
  selling, a fraudulent practice where touts advertise tickets they do not have,
  hoping to secure a sale first and source the tickets later. Other lowlights
  include Viagogo profiting from an Ed Sheeran gig for a cancer charity and
  refusing to attend a parliamentary evidence session into its practices. Touts
  and the resale platforms who earn a commission from their sales are not going
  down without a fight. Last year, as Labour closed in on election victory, they
  held a secret meeting to raise funds for a lobbying campaign to quash the
  policy. The plot, exposed in undercover footage filmed by the Guardian,
  appears to have failed. In recent weeks, a series of smartly presented reports
  have emerged, warning that the alternative to resale platforms and their
  much-maligned business model is even worse. A cap on the legitimate and
  regulated resale market, they say, will lead to a surge in outright fraud and
  scams, with touts plying their trade instead through social media, where
  consumers have no guarantees of a refund when things go wrong. One key report,
  written by the public affairs consultancy Bradshaw Advisory, points to polling
  suggesting that rates of fraud were higher in Ireland and the Australian state
  of Victoria, both of which restrict resale, than they are in the UK. However,
  the report conceded that there was no available data to show whether fraud
  actually rose because, or even after, restrictions on resale were introduced.
  What is more, in the initial post on its website outlining the report’s
  findings, Bradshaw failed to disclose that the work was paid for by the resale
  site StubHub, only amending this after a complaint by music industry
  anti-touting group, FanFair Alliance. A spokesperson said the company did
  disclose the relationship in press releases and that its research was
  independent and unaffected by StubHub’s position. Viagogo also paid for a
  report, by the Centre of Economics and Business Research (CEBR), which
  concluded that a resale crackdown could cost the economy £183m, if 25% of
  ticket holders decided neither to attend nor resell their ticket at face
  value. NME, the 72-year-old music magazine, is among outlets that have been
  paid to publicise the findings via advertorial posts. The magazine did not
  respond to a request for comment. Adam Webb, a spokesperson for FanFair
  Alliance, questioned the evidentiary value of reports that produced outcomes
  so apparently favourable to the companies that commissioned them. “Both these
  groups have presented the Bradshaw and CEBR reports as independent and
  authoritative, despite everyone being on the resale industry payroll,” said
  Webb. He said there was “no actual evidence” of fraud rising in Ireland after
  curbs on resale took effect and such a conclusion ran counter to what FanFair
  Alliance had been told by Irish banks. The CEBR said its ethical policy meant
  that it would not say anything on behalf of paying customers that it would not
  in principle say if it were unpaid. Viagogo also appears to have a commercial
  relationship with two private anti-fraud organisations, We Fight Fraud and Get
  Safe Online, both of which have spoken of the perils of price caps. We Fight
  Fraud said: “We’ve been open about Viagogo as a funder, as we are with
  multiple other consumer brands whom we advise on safety and crime prevention.
  “The source of funding does not influence our findings. The integrity of our
  methodology and the data itself are what determine the outcomes.” Get Safe
  Online said: “Purely impartially, we believe that the enforcement of a ticket
  price cap will open up an opportunity for scammers to upscale ticket fraud,
  especially on social media – putting thousands of fans at potential risk. Our
  focus has always been,and will always remain, consumer protection,
  irrespective of any relationships we enter into with third parties.” Viagogo
  said it was a regulated marketplace that operated in compliance with consumer
  law “with robust security and fraud measures in place”. “Sellers on Viagogo
  must adhere to strict policies. If Viagogo has reason to believe a listing is
  speculative after review, it is taken down and we ask the seller to provide
  further proof of purchase.” The company said it apologised for the apparent
  GDPR breach and said it took data protection seriously, provided regular
  training, and would review its procedures. StubHub International said: “We are
  committed to keeping fans safe from real ticket fraud which takes place on
  unregulated channels such as social media […]. “As a regulated secondary
  ticketing platform, StubHub International is one of the safest options for
  consumers wishing to purchase a resale ticket, and we remain dedicated to
  protecting fans in their pursuit to see their favourite live events.”
