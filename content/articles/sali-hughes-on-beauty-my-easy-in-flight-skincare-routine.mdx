  As I write this, I am about to embark on a long-haul flight for which I packed
  my carry-on with newfound abandon. Travellers to many airports are now free
  from the confines of post‑9/11 liquids restrictions and the dreaded plastic
  ziplock bag, so the opportunities for an in-flight skincare moment are
  greater. I try to embark with a clean face, but if that isn’t possible I
  freshen up first with Simple’s Kind to Skin Cleansing Facial Wipes (£2 for
  seven), before layering on a series of humectant skincare products to
  counterbalance horribly dry cabin air. I was sceptical about Summer Fridays’
  Jet Lag Deep Hydration Serum (£44 for 30ml) since I couldn’t see what was
  flight-specific about it beyond the cleverly marketed name. But actually it’s
  very good and needn’t be confined to travel, especially if you’re prone to
  very dehydrated skin year-round. The ingredients list is essentially a
  hydration supergroup: glycerin, squalane, hyaluronic acid, propanediol and
  ceramides, and the effects can be seen and felt for many hours. Ungreasy but
  rich and cosseting, it adds temporary bounce and smoothness to the face,
  restoring a look of good health. For in-flight refreshment – aside from a cold
  wine – I always have a facial mist on standby. They’re a great way to top up
  on moisture and to punctuate waking and dining moments, where you have to stop
  vegetating and look livelier. My newest acquisition is Glazing Mist (£30 for
  80ml) from the consistently good Rhode. It propels a fine, almost vapour-like
  mist, so you needn’t worry about splattering travellers in neighbouring seats.
  The thin, milky liquid gives a pretty, glowy finish and has an extremely
  gentle, soothing feel – moisturising without stickiness. When home, it can be
  stored in the fridge for instant relief in hot weather. I stick on hydrating
  under-eye gel patches an hour or so before landing, and while they certainly
  help me look less knackered, they are there as much for something to do on a
  long and boring flight (the in-sky equivalent of necking a whole bag of wine
  gums while driving on the motorway). I typically reach for any I have at the
  time, but if I were shopping for some, I’d generally opt for Patchology’s Eye
  Gels (from £4 a pair), since they’re inexpensive and do the job well. Before
  landing, I add much-needed colour and SPF, such as Merit’s silky, pared-back
  The Uniform (£34), a tinted mineral sunscreen with added perk. Searching for
