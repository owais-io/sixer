  Veteran climate scientists are organizing a coordinated public comment to a US
  Department of Energy (DOE) report that cast doubt on the scientific consensus
  on the climate crisis. The report, published late last month, claimed concerns
  about planet-warming fossil fuels are overblown, sparking widespread concern
  from scientists who said it was full of climate misinformation; it was an
  attempt to support a proposal from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
  to undo the “endangerment finding”, which forms the legal basis of virtually
  all US climate regulations. “A public comment from experts can be useful
  because it injects expert analysis into a decision-making process that might
  otherwise be dominated by political, economic, or ideological considerations,”
  said Andrew Dessler, a climate researcher at Texas A&amp;M University who is
  organizing the response to the report. “Experts can identify technical errors,
  highlight overlooked data, and clarify uncertainties in ways that improve the
  accuracy and robustness of the final policy or report.” The response comes as
  part of a broader wave of experts’ attempts to uphold established climate
  science as the Trump administration promotes contrarian and unproven
  viewpoints. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine
  (Nasem), the country’s top group of scientific advisers, has launched a
  “fast-track” review of the latest evidence on how greenhouse gases threaten
  human health and wellbeing – a move announced following the proposed
  endangerment-finding rollback. Nasem, which advises the EPA and other federal
  agencies, plans to release their findings in September, in time to inform the
  EPA’s decision on the endangerment finding. The initiative will be self-funded
  by the organization – a highly unusual practice from the congressionally
  chartered group, which usually responds to federal bodies’ calls for advice.
  “It is critical that federal policymaking is informed by the best available
  scientific evidence,” said Marcia McNutt, president of the National Academy of
  Sciences, in a statement. Trump administration efforts to block access to data
  have also inspired pushback. This month, the president ousted the head of the
  Bureau of Labor Statistics after baselessly saying the data it publishes is
  “rigged”. In earlier weeks, federal officials have also deleted key climate
  data and reports such as the national climate assessments and the US Global
  Change Research Program from government websites. The administration has
  changed 70% more of the information on official environmental websites during
  its first 100 days than the first Trump administration did, according to a
  report the research group Environmental Data and Governance Initiative
  published last week. In light of these actions, research organizations such as
  the Public Environmental Data Project and Cornerstone Sustainability Data
  Initiative have worked to safeguard and publicize data that the federal
  government is hiding from the public. “Attacks on science are dangerous
  because they erode one of society’s most effective tools for understanding the
  world and making decisions in the public interest,” said Dessler. “When
  political or ideological forces undermine scientific institutions or discredit
  experts, they weaken our ability to harness this powerful tool.” Asked for
  comment about the Nasem review, an EPA spokesperson repeated a comment offered
  earlier this month: “Congress never explicitly gave EPA authority to impose
  greenhouse gas regulations for cars and trucks.” The Clean Air Act authorizes
  the EPA to set emission standards for cars if the EPA administrator determines
  that their emissions endanger public health or welfare. That includes
  greenhouse gas emissions, due to the endangerment finding. Asked for comment
  on the DOE report supporting the EPA’s position, Department of Energy
  spokesperson Ben Dietderich also repeated an earlier comment. “This report
  critically assesses many areas of ongoing scientific inquiry that are
  frequently assigned high levels of confidence – not by the scientists
  themselves but by the political bodies involved, such as the United Nations or
  previous presidential administrations,” he said. The UN and the US have
  regularly convened top scientists to produce scientific climate reports, which
  warn that urgent action to curb emissions is needed. Dietderich also said
  officials “look forward to engaging with substantive comments” on the report.
  However, “the real question is whether they’ll listen to us”, said Dessler.
