  For the first time, a free chickenpox vaccination will be offered to children
  in England by the NHS from January next year. Here we explore the background
  to the rollout. What is chickenpox? Chickenpox is a highly contagious
  infection caused by the varicella zoster virus, and is common in the UK. It
  results in an itchy rash, and can also cause aches, a high temperature and
  loss of appetite, according to the NHS. Most people catch chickenpox in
  childhood – about 90% have had it by the age of 10, according to UK Health
  Security Agency – and tend to have a mild illness, but it can also occur in
  adults who have not previously been infected. These infections tend to be more
  severe. Once someone has had chickenpox, the virus remains dormant in the
  body. If reactivated it can cause shingles. This tends to occur in cases where
  the immune system is weak. The UK has had a universal shingles vaccination
  programme in place for older adults since 2013. Who can currently get a
  chickenpox vaccination on the NHS? A number of services offer the varicella
  vaccination privately, for about £150 for two doses, but the jabs are
  available for free on the NHS to certain groups. The NHS says these include
  children and adults who are in regular or close contact with people who could
  become very ill from a chickenpox infection or have a weakened immune system.
  A separate shingles vaccine is already available on the NHS for adults turning
  65, those aged 70 to 79 and those aged 50 and over with a severely weakened
  immune system. What has the UK government announced? From January, GP
  practices in England will offer eligible children a combined vaccine for
  measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) as part of the routine infant
  vaccination schedule. The decision to roll out the MMRV vaccine was based on
  expert scientific advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and
  Immunisation (JCVI), officials said, after research showed the significant
  impact of severe cases of chickenpox on children’s health, hospital admissions
  and associated costs. Healthcare policy is devolved in Wales, Scotland and
  Northern Ireland. What happened to chickenpox parties? Some may remember being
  dragged off as children to meet itchy, spotty friends so they could catch the
  virus when young, but times have changed. The introduction of a chickenpox
  vaccine not only prevents children from experiencing a pretty miserable rash
  but could also save lives. Some children develop nasty complications including
  bacterial infections, inflammation of the lungs, inflammation of the brain and
  stroke, In some rare cases such complications can be fatal. It could also help
  others by reducing the circulation of the chickenpox virus in the community,
  thereby protecting adults who have not previously had the disease, including
  pregnant women and their unborn children, for whom chickenpox can be
  dangerous. Is England unique on this? No, in fact it is behind a number of
  other countries, including Germany, Canada, Australia and the US. Data from
  those countries suggests that incorporating the chickenpox vaccine into
  routine childhood immunisation programmes reduces cases of the disease and
  related hospital admissions. According to the US Centers for Disease Control
  and Prevention, the chickenpox vaccination programme in the US has prevented
  91m cases, 238,000 hospital admissions and 2,000 deaths over a 25-year period.
