  What makes a great wedding gift? Does it need to be extravagant to be
  memorable? Or is it the sentimental presents that stand the test of time? To
  find out, we asked readers to share the best gifts from their big day – or one
  they had given that was well received. For many, it was the sentimental gifts
  you treasured most. One reader told us a friend had made their wedding cake.
  “The cake is long gone, but the icing decorations are still in a Tupperware
  box,” they said. For Lauren Alergant, it was a hand-designed card displaying
  her and her partner’s names and their wedding date: “We framed it and it has
  pride of place on our mantelpiece,” she said. Margaret sent us a picture of
  the slender blue vase that still reminds her of the friend who gave it to her
  63 years ago. Practical, everyday wedding gifts were another hit with you.
  Mark Sadler told us about the electric drill he is still using 39 years later.
  Similarly, Andrew and Jane said the most memorable gift from their wedding 46
  years ago was a bread knife they still use daily. Alison shared how much use
  she had got out of the Elna Lotus sewing machine she was given. “We’ve made
  clothes for the children, curtains and soft furnishings for four houses, gifts
  for other people and items to sell for charity,” she said. A few readers
  mentioned the gifts they’d given. Sarah told us about the chopping board she
  had given to her son and his wife. “It was made from upcycled olive wood. They
  got engaged while travelling the Greek islands, and the pattern of the grain
  looked exactly like a group of islands in the Med,” she said. Ellen Fenton
  said her go-to gift is “three bottles of wine chosen with advice from a
  specialist: one to drink on the first anniversary, one for the fifth and one
  for the tenth”. The proof is in the pudding, she said: “Three different
  couples have messaged on various anniversaries to thank us for the wine. And
  if they break up, one of them can drink the wine to drown their sorrows!” she
  joked. *** This week’s picks ‘Your nether regions will know if you’ve
  skimped’: 16 summer cycling essentials Summer beauty saviours: the best
  skincare, makeup and body products for hot weather ‘Whizzes up to a vibrant,
