  UK bank shares tumbled on Friday, cutting the stock market value of the sector
  by almost £8bn in morning trading, as fresh calls for a windfall tax on large
  lenders in the autumn budget spooked investors. Calls for a tax grab, in a
  paper written by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) thinktank,
  took a toll on some of the UK’s biggest high street banks. NatWest Group
  suffered the biggest drop on Friday morning, registering a decline of as much
  as 5% in its share price, while Lloyds Banking Group and Barclays followed
  close behind, falling 4.5% and 3.6% respectively. HSBC dropped more than 1%.
  The falls cut the notional value of the UK’s biggest banks by £7.9bn within
  hours of the market opening. It comes as rumours swirl over a number of
  potential tax increases – including on banks, property and landlords’ rental
  income – which could help the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, plug a shortfall of
  up to £40bn in the public finances. The IPPR’s report calls for a new tax on
  the big banks that would help to recover “windfalls” enjoyed by lenders as a
  result of an emergency economic policy known as quantitative easing, which was
  put in place in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Confidence among UK
  businesses has grown despite anxiety about the state of the economy, in a rare
  slice of positive news for the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, in the run-up to her
  autumn budget. An August poll of UK companies by Lloyds Bank showed that
  improved sentiment among manufacturers and retailers helped push overall
  optimism within UK plc up by two percentage points, with 54% of companies now
  feeling confident in the current environment. It marked the fourth consecutive
  monthly increase in overall business sentiment, according to the Lloyds
  business barometer, driven by a growing number of businesses – roughly 63% –
  feeling strong about their own trading prospects. On that measurement alone,
  confidence reached its highest level since 2014. About half of all businesses
  now expect to hire more staff in the coming year despite growing costs. The
  survey found 38% of companies are expecting to have to raise wages by 3% or
  more, with the vast majority – 83% – saying that higher employment-related
  costs would have a limited impact on hiring plans. Overall optimism across the
  private sector comes despite jitters over the state of the economy, with
  levels of positive sentiment falling for the first time since the drop seen in
  April, when Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff announcements sparked fears over
  the future of global trade. Economic confidence fell three points to 44% this
  month, Lloyds said, although that remained above the longer-term average of
  19%. However, the fact that business confidence continues to rise amid the
  economic gloom will be a rare piece of good news for the chancellor, given
  fears that a fresh round of tax increases – meant to bolster the public
  finances – could knock confidence and investment across the private sector as
  companies try to recoup and offset costs. Reeves is expected to announce a
  date for her autumn budget within days. Scottish Greens have elected a new
  co-leadership team, with MSPs Gillian Mackay and Ross Greer voted in to take
  the party forward. The pair replace Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater, both of
  whom had served as junior ministers in the Scottish government under a
  powersharing deal with the SNP. Harvie announced earlier this year he was
  standing down from his co-leadership post. Slater had stood for re-election,
  but was defeated in the leadership contest, which is held every two years
  under Scottish Green party rules. The UK government has banned Israeli
  officials from attending the country’s flagship defence event next month.
  Israeli industry, including UK subsidiaries of Israeli companies will be able
  to attend London’s Defence &amp; Security Equipment International (DSEI) show
  in September but the UK government will not invite representatives of the
  Israeli government to the major industry event. The move comes as Keir Starmer
  prepares to recognise a Palestinian state after warning Israel it would do so
  if the country did not take steps to relieve suffering in Gaza and met other
  conditions. A UK government spokesperson said: The Israeli government’s
  decision to further escalate its military operation in Gaza is wrong. As a
  result, we can confirm that no Israeli government delegation will be invited
  to attend DSEI UK 2025. There must be a diplomatic solution to end this war
  now, with an immediate ceasefire, the return of the hostages and a surge in
  humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza. Israel’s defence ministry said that as
  a result of the trade fair ban it would not run its national pavilion as it
  has done previously at the DSEI. Israeli defence companies, such as Elbit
  Systems, Rafael, IAI and Uvision, will be able to attend. Conspiracy theorists
  who spread misinformation must be defeated, a health minister said, as he
  urged parents to take up the new chickenpox jab. The government has announced
  a new vaccination programme for chickenpox from January, meaning that GPs will
  offer eligible children a combined vaccine for measles, mumps, rubella and
  varicella – the clinical term for chickenpox – as part of the routine infant
  vaccination schedule. Health minister Stephen Kinnock argued it is “common
  sense” for parents to vaccinate their children, amid what he described as a
  rise in “vaccine hesitancy” after the Covid pandemic. Speaking to LBC, Kinnock
  said: There’s been a 10-year trend in declining take-up of vaccines, and I
  think obviously the vaccine hesitancy that came after the pandemic has
  definitely not helped. These conspiracy theorists, who are peddling this
  nonsense and rubbish, we’ve got to take them on, we’ve got to defeat them in
  our arguments and drown out the noise that they’re making. The government is
  working with GPs, schools and public health authorities to create local and
  national campaigns in an attempt to increase take-up, Kinnock said. Dr Gayatri
  Amirthalingam, deputy director of immunisation at the UKHSA, said: Most
  parents probably consider chickenpox to be a common and mild illness, but for
  some babies, young children and even adults, chickenpox can be very serious,
  leading to hospital admission and tragically, while rare, it can be fatal. It
  is excellent news, that from next January, we will be introducing a vaccine to
  protect against chickenpox into the NHS routine childhood vaccination
  programme – helping prevent what is for most a nasty illness and for those who
  develop severe symptoms, it could be a life saver. According to the Department
  of Health and Social Care, chickenpox causes an estimated £24m in lost income
  and productivity every year in the UK, with parents forced to take time off
  work to care for their children. The rollout of the vaccine is also expected
  to save the NHS £15m a year in costs for treating the illness. Kinnock said:
  We’re giving parents the power to protect their children from chickenpox and
  its serious complications, while keeping them in nursery or the classroom
  where they belong and preventing parents from scrambling for childcare or
  having to miss work. This vaccine puts children’s health first and gives
  working families the support they deserve. The Joint Committee on Vaccination
  and Immunisation, which advises UK health departments, recommended the
  introduction of the jab on the NHS in November 2023. Amanda Doyle, national
  director for primary care and community services at NHS England, said: This is
  a hugely positive moment for families as the NHS gets ready to roll out a
  vaccine to protect children against chickenpox for the first time, adding to
  the arsenal of other routine jabs that safeguard against serious illness. We
  will work with vaccination teams and GP surgeries across the country to roll
  out the combined MMRV vaccine in the new year, helping to keep children
  healthy and prevent sickness from these highly contagious viruses. The PA news
  agency reports that outsourcing company Mitie, which manages the Heathrow
  immigration removal centre (IRC), has responded to its earlier news story
  about the government instructing it to remove certain jobs at an immigration
  removal centre from a recruitment website (see 9.07am BST). A spokesperson for
  the company said: As part of our contractual obligations, we employ colleagues
  to run activities at Heathrow immigration removal centre to support the
  physical and mental wellbeing of detained individuals. The impact of these
  services was highlighted in the recent HMIP (HM Inspectorate of Prisons)
  report into Harmondsworth, which said that these provisions contributed to a
  greater overall focus on helping individuals to manage the stresses of
  detention. Last year, the watchdog said the conditions at Harmondsworth were
  the “worst” in the country, with the chief inspector of prisons Charlie Taylor
  describing the “chaos” he discovered there as “truly shocking”. The Scottish
  Greens will announce the result of its leadership election on Friday. Current
  co-leader Lorna Slater, MSPs Gillian Mackay and Ross Greer and activist
  Dominic Ashmole are seeking to form the new co-leadership team, with the
  result to be announced at an event in Edinburgh. Co-leader Patrick Harvie –
  who has been one of the party’s leaders since 2008 – announced earlier this
  year he would stand down from the role but continue to be an MSP. Among the
  policy pledges outlined by the candidates is universal free bus travel, which
  was proposed by Greer – who has widely been seen as a contender for the
  leadership since he was elected to Holyrood at the age of 21. Mackay – who
  shepherded landmark legislation placing buffer zones outside abortion clinics
  through Holyrood – said she believed she can “take the party further and
  deliver great election results”. Slater – one of the two only Green members in
  the UK to serve as a government minister as a result of the Bute House
  agreement – said the party went from “being a small but effective party to
  being a significant force in Scottish politics” as she pledged to go further
  to “build a fairer, more progressive and greener country”. Ashmole – who has
  stood for the party at numerous elections but does not hold elected office –
  said his pitch to members is to put climate change front and centre, urging
  Scots to “prepare for the worst, strive for the best – and protect what we
  love”. Whichever pair wins the final ballot, reports the PA news agency, the
  leadership team will probably be the ones to lead the party into the 2026
  Holyrood election with a view to increasing their MSP cohort from the seven
  won in 2021. The government has instructed a contractor to remove certain jobs
  at an immigration removal centre from a recruitment website after
  advertisements for floristry and hairdressing tutors emerged, reports the PA
  agency. Outsourcing company Mitie, which manages the Heathrow immigration
  removal centre (IRC) near the west London airport, listed several roles online
  including a painting and decorating tutor and gym manager at the IRC for
  salaries that range between £31,000 and £38,000. One of the job descriptions
  includes responsibilities to deliver workshops in floristry, cake decorating,
  balloon-craft and arts and craft activities to “provide a safe, secure,
  stimulating, supportive and productive environment for residents”. Home Office
  minister Seema Malhotra said: We do not believe all these roles are necessary
  and have told the Home Office to speak to Mitie to remove them. The government
  department has not yet clarified which jobs Mitie has been directed to remove,
  and a number of roles remain listed on the government’s find-a-job portal,
  reports the PA news agency. On its website, Mitie said it aims to “treat those
  in our care with dignity, decency, and respect” and provide an environment for
  residents to “engage in activities relevant to them”. Health minister Stephen
  Kinnock said there had been “excessive interpretation” of contractual
  obligations. He told LBC: My understanding of it is, they’re contractually
  obliged to have some kind of physical exercise, because you want to make sure
  that people aren’t falling into ill health, because that just makes it even
  worse for the taxpayer if we’re having to deal with that kind of thing. But it
  seems that there’s been an excessive interpretation of those contractual
  obligations and Seema Malhotra, the immigration minister, I’m very pleased to
  say, has rapidly responded to this and instructed Mitie to delete those jobs,
  and that is a good move on her part. The Heathrow IRC combines Colnbrook and
  Harmondsworth removals centres and is, according to Mitie, the largest IRC in
  Europe with a capacity of 965 residents. The company has been approached by
  the PA news agency for comment. Rachel Reeves should levy a new bank tax and
  urge the Bank of England to halt bond sales to reduce the government’s
  £22bn-a-year losses from quantitative easing, the IPPR thinktank has argued.
  In a report called Fixing the Leak, the IPPR’s associate director for economic
  policy, Carsten Jung, says the Treasury should rein in the costs of QE as
  public finances are tight. “What started as a programme to boost the economy
  is now a massive drain on taxpayer money,” he said. “Public money is flowing
  straight into commercial banks’ coffers because of a flawed policy design.
  While families struggle with rising costs, the government is … [in effect]
  writing multibillion-pound cheques to bank shareholders.” The emergency
  policy, first enacted in 2009 during the global financial crisis, involved
  buying up £895bn of bonds from the UK’s banks and, in exchange, crediting them
  with reserves at the Bank of England. The Bank is now winding down QE – a
  process known as “quantitative tightening” (QT) – by selling the bonds at a
  rate of £100bn a year, but these sales are taking place at a loss. In
  accordance with a promise from Alistair Darling, then chancellor, the Treasury
  bears the financial risks of QE, so these losses hit the government’s
  finances. In addition, the higher Bank of England base rate, now set at 4% to
  combat above-target inflation, means the Bank is paying out higher interest
  rates on banks’ reserves than it is receiving on the bonds it holds. In total,
  these losses amount to a £22bn-a-year hit to the public finances, according to
  the IPPR. Jung calls for the Treasury to tax the big banks on their QE-related
  reserves, saying the profits of the big four have more than doubled since
  before the Covid pandemic. He says such a policy could bring in £8bn a year
  and sidestep the Bank’s objections to a widely mooted alternative known as
  “tiered reserves”, which the Bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, has argued could
  interfere with its job of combating inflation. The immediate closure of asylum
  hotels could lead to migrants “living destitute in the streets”, a government
  minister said, as he warned against a “disorderly discharge”. Health minister
  Stephen Kinnock told Sky News: It’s not a question of if we close the hotels,
  it’s a question of when and how we close the hotels, and what we don’t want to
  have is a disorderly discharge from every hotel in the country, which would
  actually have far worse consequences than what we currently have, in terms of
  the impact that would have on asylum seekers potentially living destitute in
  the streets. And I don’t think any one of the communities that are campaigning
  on these hotels issue want to see that. So what we are doing is looking to
  appeal this injunction simply because we’re taking a pragmatic approach to how
  we want to manage the process, not because we believe that the hotel … per se
  should stay open.” Pressed on where the migrants would be moved to if the Bell
  hotel in Epping were to close, Kinnock said: We’ve got a whole range of
  options – disused warehouses, disused office blocks, disused military
  barracks. We are looking at every option that we have to manage the discharge,
  and it’s really important that we do that and put those plans in place, but of
  course, it’s going to be much more effective if we’re able to do that in a way
  where we’re controlling the discharge from these hotels. Later today, we
  should get the judgment from the three senior judges ruling on whether to
  overturn a temporary injunction which is to block asylum seekers from being
  housed at the Bell hotel. It is expected at about 2pm. In other developments:
  The Foreign Office in London summoned Russia’s ambassador to the UK, Andrey
  Kelin, at 1pm, in direct response to the severe damage inflicted on the
  British Council building in Ukraine, government sources said. The prime
  minister, Keir Starmer, condemned the attacks as “senseless” and accused
  Russia of “sabotaging hopes of peace”. Rachel Reeves should levy a new bank
  tax and urge the Bank of England to halt bond sales to reduce the government’s
  £22bn-a-year losses from quantitative easing, the IPPR thinktank has argued.
  In a report called Fixing the Leak, the IPPR’s associate director for economic
  policy, Carsten Jung, says the Treasury should rein in the costs of QE as
  public finances are tight. England needs to “wake up” to its faltering infant
  vaccination programme, experts have warned, as it was revealed that one in
  five children start primary school unprotected from serious infectious
  diseases. The government has urged parents to make sure their children are up
  to date with their vaccines. The Reform party’s promise to abolish policies on
  equality and diversity is “ludicrous” and threatens to take policing and
  society backwards, one of the country’s most senior chief constables has said.
  Serena Kennedy retires on Sunday as the chief constable of Merseyside police,
  after a tumultuous four years in charge. She criticised politicians including
  the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, for making questionable statements at
  times of heightened tension, such as immediately after last summer’s Southport
  riot. A member of the House of Lords asked a senior British diplomat to help a
  Ghanaian goldmining venture in which he held shares, claiming it was “in the
  UK national interest”, the Guardian can disclose. The revelation will add to
  concerns about apparent breaches of parliamentary lobbying rules by Richard
  Dannatt, a former head of the British army. The peer is already under scrutiny
  over his lobbying for several companies, leading in two cases to
  investigations by the Lords’ standards body.

UK bank shares tumbled on Friday, cutting the stock market value of the sector by almost £8bn in morning trading, as fresh calls for a windfall tax on large lenders in the autumn budget spooked investors.

And I don’t think any one of the communities that are campaigning on these hotels issue want to see that. So what we are doing is looking to appeal this injunction simply because we’re taking a pragmatic approach to how we want to manage the process, not because we believe that the hotel … per se should stay open.” Pressed on where the migrants would be moved to if the Bell hotel in Epping were to close, Kinnock said: We’ve got a whole range of options – disused warehouses, disused office blocks, disused military barracks. We are looking at every option that we have to manage the discharge, and it’s really important that we do that and put those plans in place, but of course, it’s going to be much more effective if we’re able to do that in a way where we’re controlling the discharge from these hotels. Later today, we should get the judgment from the three senior judges ruling on whether to overturn a temporary injunction which is to block asylum seekers from being housed at the Bell hotel. It is expected at about 2pm.

The prime minister, Keir Starmer, condemned the attacks as “senseless” and accused Russia of “sabotaging hopes of peace”. Rachel Reeves should levy a new bank tax and urge the Bank of England to halt bond sales to reduce the government’s £22bn-a-year losses from quantitative easing, the IPPR thinktank has argued. In a report called Fixing the Leak, the IPPR’s associate director for economic policy, Carsten Jung, says the Treasury should rein in the costs of QE as public finances are tight. England needs to “wake up” to its faltering infant vaccination programme, experts have warned, as it was revealed that one in five children start primary school unprotected from serious infectious diseases. The government has urged parents to make sure their children are up to date with their vaccines. The Reform party’s promise to abolish policies on equality and diversity is “ludicrous” and threatens to take policing and society backwards, one of the country’s most senior chief constables has said. Serena Kennedy retires on Sunday as the chief constable of Merseyside police, after a tumultuous four years in charge. She criticised politicians including the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, for making questionable statements at times of heightened tension, such as immediately after last summer’s Southport riot. A member of the House of Lords asked a senior British diplomat to help a Ghanaian goldmining venture in which he held shares, claiming it was “in the UK national interest”, the Guardian can disclose. The revelation will add to concerns about apparent breaches of parliamentary lobbying rules by Richard Dannatt, a former head of the British army. The peer is already under scrutiny over his lobbying for several companies, leading in two cases to investigations by the Lords’ standards body.
