  Being sick is a costly business for Bill Thompson, who worked in the fast-food
  industry in Independence, Missouri, for more than 30 years, and recently
  worked at Guitar Center until early July, when he was laid off. “As an older
  worker, I have health issues from working on my feet and with my hands for
  many years with no breaks for eight to 10 hours a day. I have done it for 38
  years now, living paycheck to paycheck,” 54-year-old Thompson said, noting in
  Missouri workers are not mandated breaks of any kind during work. So when
  Republicans in Missouri repealed a paid sick leave mandate that the state’s
  voters approved by 58% after an aggressive lobbying campaign by the Missouri
  chamber of commerce and industry and other business industry groups, he said,
  “It was a literal gut punch. “If you’re not paid for missed days, it literally
  means food off your table, bills unpaid, rent unpaid, then that can lead
  towards homelessness. Some of the people I know in the movement are currently
  homeless but still are fighting back against this,” said Thompson. “I was very
  disappointed and disgusted that hard-working taxpayers this would have helped
  matter so little to them.” Thompson helped gather signatures for the
  paid-sick-leave and minimum-wage-increase ballot initiative because of his
  experiences of working through illnesses and losing income when he had to take
  time off to care for his ailing mother. Workers and labor groups in Missouri
  strongly criticized the repeal, arguing elected officials chose to side with
  “greed” over workers, as efforts to re-enact the law and prevent legislators
  from overturning voter ballot initiatives in Missouri are under way. The
  state’s house and senate passed HB567, signed into law on 10 July by the
  governor, Mike Kehoe, which repealed the paid sick leave mandate and annual
  minimum wage increases tied to the consumer price index beyond the increase to
  $15 an hour in 2016 that voters also approved. Voters in Nebraska, by more
  than 74.5%, and Alaska, with nearly 57% approval, also passed paid sick leave
  mandates in November 2024. As of December 2024, 18 states and Washington DC
  had enacted paid sick leave laws covering private employers. “They chose to
  side with greed over the health of Missouri workers,” said Richard Eiker, a
  McDonald’s worker in the Kansas City, Missouri, area for more than 20 years
  who supported the paid sick leave mandate. “But we’re not going anywhere,
  we’re going to stay in this and keep fighting until we win better treatment
  for Missouri workers.” Eiker said the issue of paid sick leave was a public
  health issue, especially for food service workers, and that he has often had
  to go into work sick or injured because he couldn’t afford to take the unpaid
  time off from work. “Whether it’s been an injury I’ve sustained at work or
  been an illness I’ve had, I’ve often found myself having to go into work
  regardless of whether I recovered fully or not, simply because I can’t afford
  to take the time off of work in order to take care of my bills and
  everything,” Eiker said. For 10 years, Eiker was the primary caregiver for his
  mother and he recounted that on a day that she wasn’t feeling well, he had to
  go to work. He came home to find her unconscious and unresponsive after she
  suffered a stroke. “At the time I was caring for her, her expenses, my
  expenses, and we were trying to keep the apartment we were in, all these
  pressures on me, if I had paid sick time off and I had been able to stay with
  her that day, I wonder if things could have been different,” Eiker added.
  Though voters all approved paid sick leave in states where Republicans have
  dominated in statewide elections, only Republicans in Missouri have pushed to
  entirely repeal paid sick leave approved by voters. The repeal law in Missouri
  goes into effect on 28 August, just weeks after the paid sick leave mandate
  took effect in May 2025. Proponents of paid sick leave criticized the repeal
  given the strong support for it and that negotiations were under way to reach
  a compromise. “I think we were 95% of the way on a negotiated agreement, one
  that I wouldn’t have been happy with, because it would have been different
  than what the voters had passed. But at the end of the day, elected officials,
  I think, weren’t so much concerned with paid sick days. I think they were more
  concerned with the idea that working people have power over our lives,” said
  Richard von Glahn, policy director at Missouri Jobs With Justice, a worker
  advocacy group based in St Louis that worked on the paid sick leave ballot
  initiative. “I think that was the more important issue for the chamber of
  commerce and elected officials to try to push back on, because I think they’re
  really terrified that working people have a sense of our own agency in a state
  like this.” He argued the paid sick leave campaign to gather signatures and
  speak with voters “were easy because paid sick days are such common sense to
  most people”. “Even on a day where Missourians sort of overwhelmingly voted
  for Donald Trump, Josh Hawley and Governor Kehoe, they also overwhelmingly
  voted for an increase in paid sick days,” Von Glahn said. “Any notion that
  there’s really a Republican party, that is a party of workers, Missouri shows
  just how much of a stranglehold corporate interests still have on the
  Republican establishment. I think that’s a cautionary tale for working-class
  people.” Groups in Missouri are weighing a new ballot initiative to enshrine
  the law in the state’s constitution, and a 2026 ballot initiative has been
  filed to require at least 80% of the state legislature to repeal all or parts
  of a voter-approved measure. The paid sick leave mandate was repealed as the
  Missouri chamber of commerce and industry called the bill to do so its “top
  priority” during the 2025 legislative session, though repealing the law
  through the legislature was initially seen as challenging given the strong
  public support for it. “Some legislators may look at this and go, we don’t
  want to goof with it at all because the percentage was so high in support of
  it,” Ray McCarty, CEO of Associated Industries of Missouri, said in an
  interview with the Missouri Independent in November 2024. Opponents of the
  paid sick leave bill claimed it was “a job killer”, a common refrain in
  opposition to paid sick leave policies for years, though data and research
  have shown paid sick leave improves workforce participation and lowers
  employee turnover, especially of women, in addition to adding health benefits.
  The authors of the bill to repeal the paid sick leave mandate in the state
  house and senate did not respond to multiple requests for comment. In an
  email, a spokesperson for Kehoe claimed “out of state special interests”
  played a significant role in passing the voter-approved Proposition A, though
  they did not name who they believe those were. “HB567 protects families, job
  creators, and small businesses by rolling back government overreach, cutting
  red tape, and eliminating costly mandates,” the spokesperson added. “This law
  promotes freedom for workers to find jobs that fit their needs and for
  businesses to offer the benefits that work best for them – ensuring Missouri’s
  future is driven by its own people and economy.” Thompson could not disagree
  more. In 2020, when he worked at Burger King, he said, he had to take eight
  weeks off work, all unpaid, because his mother’s cancer had reached an
  inoperable stage and she was put on palliative care through hospice. “I moved
  in with her and cared for her, cooked meals, made sure she took her meds,”
  explained Thompson. “I had to go to food pantries and rely on the charity of
  family and neighbors to feed us. She was in hospice care for eight weeks and
  passed away. I wasn’t paid for that time away from work. No one should go
  through this working in the richest country in the world.”
