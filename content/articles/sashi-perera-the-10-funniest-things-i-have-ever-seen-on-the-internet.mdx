  I love the internet. People from the time before the internet always talk
  about how great that time was. They’re lying. Some things were exactly the
  same: there was love and war, and people pushed doors clearly marked “pull”,
  especially if someone was watching. But we had to bear these experiences
  without a tool to ferret out as much information as possible about anything or
  anyone at any time. So it was definitely a worse time. When a dial-up
  connection came into my life at 12, I threw myself at the internet with the
  intensity usually reserved for Backstreet Boys dances. I’ve aggressively
  communicated on every virtual platform since its inception, and the best bit
  is the link to all the funnies. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of
  must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning I
  don’t have to warn anyone that I’m strange any more – I’m a comedian now so
  it’s assumed – but it was a surprise to myself that this list came out as
  mostly music and animals. Here it is in no particular order. 1. Giant Pandas
  falling over It’s hard knowing that I’ll never write a joke as funny as
  someone falling over. When I’m having a bad day, I watch giant pandas falling
  over to cackle (they’re totally fine, it’s part of their development according
  to this zoo). 2. Graham Norton – David Attenborough Sir Attenborough can
  narrate absolutely anything, including this tortoise trying to mate with a
  shoe. 3. Anisa Nandaula There are many wildly talented people in Australian
  comedy making everyone laugh. No one does it in under 10 seconds like Anisa –
  here she is pretending to be a snake to get closer to Robert Irwin. 4. Lonely
  Island – Captain Jack Sparrow (feat Michael Bolton) This is the sum total of
  my deep love of Michael Bolton, Erin Brockovich, my nightclub era and the
  height of Lonely Island’s dominance of the internet. There is something about
  Michael – we are on first name terms, but he doesn’t know that – saying “well
  hey there, I’m a legal lady” that still gets me. 5. Taylor Swift – Trouble
  (Goat Remix) Taylor Swift’s Trouble was on every radio wave when my brother
  happened upon this video mixing the chorus with a screaming goat and it never
  fails to dissolve me into laughter. 6. Lawyer or cat The year that was 2020
  was hard on all of us but this lawyer who turned up to a virtual courtroom as
  a cat had an especially difficult day. 7. Jonathan Bynoe – Lovely Day If
  you’ve ever wondered what happened in a studio on the day a song was recorded,
  this man answers it for you. My favourite is Lovely Day. 8. Avicii vs Nicky
  Romero – I Could Be The One There’s a scene in this music video where she
  smashes a printer in the office in slow motion and I used to watch it on
  repeat to feel joy. In hindsight, there were many signs that I wasn’t happy
  being a lawyer. 9. Lou Wall – Where is Bed If you’ve tried to put something on
  Facebook Marketplace, you’ll start by relating to this and end by not being
  able to breathe because you’re laughing so hard. That was my experience when I
  saw it live, it just keeps escalating. 10. Birds Who Were Named By People Who
  Clearly Hated Birds A man named Stu made a list of these then everyone else
  chimed in and it is my go-to proof that the internet can be used for good.
