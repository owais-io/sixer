  It was dubbed the “Great European Charm Offensive”. Hours before Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy headed to Washington for a Monday meeting with Donald Trump,
  announcements came pouring in from across Europe, making it clear that the
  president of Ukraine would not be going alone. Instead, seven European
  heavyweights – a “dream team” of leaders representing Europe’s economic and
  military heft and who had a proven rapport with the US president – hastily
  cleared their schedules to join Zelenskyy in Washington. The result was a
  meeting set to become among the “oddest in modern diplomacy”, Simon McDonald,
  former permanent under secretary at the Foreign Office, wrote in the Guardian.
  Their scramble hinted at just how much was at stake. Days earlier, Trump had
  met with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, rolling out the red carpet for a man wanted
  by the international criminal court for war crimes. The US president had gone
  into the summit insisting he wanted “some form of a ceasefire”; he came out of
  it backing pro-Russian positions. As Trump publicly dropped plans for an
  immediate ceasefire and insisted it was now up to Zelenskyy to “get it done,”
  the mood in Moscow was jubilant. At its most simple, the united European front
  was aimed at avoiding a repeat of Trump’s February ambush of Zelenskyy in the
  Oval Office. But the “rare and sweeping show of diplomatic force” was also
  about protecting Ukraine and Europe from any widening aggression from Moscow,
  said Luke Harding, the Guardian’s senior international correspondent, as the
  leaders of Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Finland landed in Washington
  alongside their EU and Nato counterparts. The talks offered up a showcase of
  the lessons learned during Trump’s erratic time in power. Flattery flowed fast
  and freely, with European leaders showering compliments on Trump and gently
  papering over potential sticking points as much as possible. Six months after
  Zelenskyy’s extraordinary dressing down in the Oval Office, the Ukrainian
  president peppered his opening remarks with eight thank you’s, most of them
  directed at Trump, as he sported what one European diplomat described as
  “almost a suit” in a style that Reuters coined as “combat formal”. Matthias
  Matthijs, a senior fellow for Europe at the Council of Foreign Relations,
  likened it to the meandering trajectory that EU trade relations have taken
  under Trump: “There are always high expectations, and then the Europeans’
  expectations are dashed by the Americans – usually by Trump’s social media
  posts or some interview he gives,” he said following Monday’s meeting. “Then
  when they meet again, having avoided the worst outcomes, they come to some
  sort of agreement. It’s better than they feared, but it’s always worse than
  the status quo. But as the saying goes, the Europeans live to fight another
  day.” Fabrizio Tassinari pointed to the broader picture of how Trump had
  inadvertently become “the greatest unifier of Europe since the end of the cold
  war”. Writing in the Guardian, the executive director of the School of
  Transnational Governance at the European University Institute in Florence,
  added: “For those like myself who have followed the chimera that is European
  foreign and security policy for years, it was almost an epiphany to witness
  these seven leaders, each speaking for two minutes, repeating the exact same
  message.” Days after the unprecedented flurry of diplomacy, questions continue
  to swirl over what – if anything – might come out of it. On Monday, Trump and
  several European leaders, said Putin had agreed to face-to-face talks with
  Zelenskyy in the coming weeks. Moscow, however, has yet to confirm that any
  such meeting – which would be the first since Russia launched its full
  invasion of Ukraine more than three years ago – is being planned, with a
  Kremlin aide saying only that Putin and Trump discussed the idea of “raising
  the level of representatives” in the Ukraine talks. Trump had also indicated a
  willingness to be part of security guarantees for Kyiv if there was a deal to
  end fighting. But the exact nature of those guarantees remains to be seen,
  with Trump later ruling out the possibility of the US putting troops on the
  ground in Ukraine and instead floating that Washington could provide air
  support. Concerns also continue to linger over what exactly Trump proposed in
  Alaska and what, if anything, Putin agreed to during the near three-hour
  meeting. As Pjotr Sauer, a Guardian Russian affairs reporter, noted, some fear
  Trump may have overstated the outcome and misjudged Moscow’s willingness to
  compromise. Others, such as Yuriy Boyechko, CEO of charity Hope for Ukraine,
  suggested Trump is deliberately setting out an exit path for Washington by
  entertaining Putin’s demands that Ukraine withdraws from Donetsk and Luhansk,
  even as Zelenskyy sets a firm red line against ceding land beyond the present
  occupation or legitimising Moscow’s control. Putin had offered a “peace deal”
  that Ukraine would be forced to reject, knowing Trump would then blame
  Zelenskyy and end US support for Kyiv, he told the Guardian on Monday. After a
  week dominated by talks and punctuated by Russian bombs continuing to rain
  down on Ukraine, Boyechko hoped that the jarring contrast would force European
  leaders to realise that it would take more than just charm offensives to
  protect the region. “Ukraine and its European allies must recognise the urgent
  need to develop their own strategy to defend Ukraine and secure peace in
  Europe – because it is increasingly likely that Trump will walk away from the
  peace negotiations.” This is an edited version of the This is Europe
