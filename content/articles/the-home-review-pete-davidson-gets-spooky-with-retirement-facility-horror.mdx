  In this retirement home horror, Pete Davidson plays Max, a graffiti artist who
  must work in a plush-yet-spooky facility as part of his community service.
  This deal is worked out by his foster father as a last-ditch effort to keep
  him out of prison; he’s been spiralling towards the drain since the death of
  his older foster brother, who apparently killed himself, and whose memory
  haunts Max’s dreams. You don’t cast Davidson for his everyman qualities as
  he’s not quite your average Joe; he’s much more plausible as, say, a TikTok
  star or a charismatic drug dealer. He’s also become something of an avatar for
  youth, one of those thirtysomethings that can credibly evoke the sensibilities
  of those more than 10 years his junior. It makes sense, then, to see him in
  this role as the one relatively young person at the retirement home,
  grumbling: “Best generation my fucking dick … fucking boomers.” Regrettably,
  though, The Home doesn’t have the requisite spark or internal logic needed to
  really tick along to a satisfying conclusion. It has plenty of would-be
  arresting imagery and icky scares, many of which rely on a physical
  gerontophobia not unusual in horror films, wherein the spectacle of age itself
  is held to be inherently revolting. Moreover, as a theme, ageing offers some
  wide-open horror goals for a society in which politicians in their 70s and 80s
  mire future generations in inequality, the climate crisis and war. The Home,
  though, is more interested in a cool kill shot and can’t quite decide if the
  condition of being old lends itself more to creating monsters or victims. This
  may have been pitched as “Get Out but with age” (and there’s a final 10-minute
  sequence that was worth signing up for alone), but there’s none of the
  consistency of vision or theme achieved by Jordan Peele’s modern horror
  classic. • The Home is on digital platforms from 22 August
