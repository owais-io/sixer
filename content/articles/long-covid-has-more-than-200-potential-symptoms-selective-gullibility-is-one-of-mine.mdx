  Long Covid has more than 200 potential symptoms. Selective gullibility is one
  of mine

bodyText: >-
  Ordinarily, I’m a sensible person – at least part-time. A journalist, an asker
  of questions, a checker of sources. Historically, a big fan of research. But
  three years into a debilitating chronic illness, I am willing to try anything
  to get well. Even things that would have once made me roll my eyes.
  Chromotherapy, sound baths, mushroom extract. Reiki, leg compression boots,
  strategic humming. If the devil (hopefully the Liz Hurley Bedazzled version)
  offered me full health in exchange for my soul, I would have a hard time
  saying no. And so, I am an easy target. I have become a selectively gullible
  person – disillusioned with mainstream medicine, waiting for a cure, sitting
  cross-legged on the floor in front of an infrared light panel wearing nothing
  but a pair of protective wraparound sunglasses and hoping for the best. I
  contracted Covid-19 at a Harry Styles concert in June 2022. Three months
  later, I was diagnosed with post-Covid-19 syndrome, colloquially known as long
  Covid because, well, it does like to hang around. Since then, I have sampled
  from the 200+ available symptoms, including but not limited to heart
  palpitations, gastrointestinal chaos, joint pain, the ability to feel my
  heartbeat in my arms, brain fog so bad I once forgot how to turn off the
  shower and the type of fatigue that regularly makes me Google “can you die
  from tiredness”. At times, a five-minute phone conversation has sent me to bed
  for days. I’d have to rest halfway up a small set of stairs. I’d answer a
  single email then slip into a sleep that felt much closer to a coma than a
  nap. When things are that grim, the promises made by the wellness industry
  sound very, very appealing. An industry worth $6.3tn globally, with some of
  the most diabolically persuasive advocates available – celebrities,
  influencers, internet strangers, a friend’s sister’s boyfriend’s colleague who
  swears this one supplement made him better in a week. I shudder to think what
  my own contribution to that figure has been – and I will not be voluntarily
  doing maths to find out. I’ve been through enough. Whenever someone recommends
  something new, I haven’t had it in me to ask “where’s the rigorous scientific
  proof of this thing’s efficacy?” when I’ve had “help me! I will do anything to
  feel well” playing inside my head on a loop for thousands of days. Sometimes
  this is fine, even great – there are many alternative things that really work
  for me – I love my acupuncturist! Somatic dance! Shiatsu! Other times, it’s
  been more sinister. During the screening call for a wellness program I now
  believe to be at best a pyramid scheme, at worst a cult, I was asked if I felt
  able to “put aside” my “critical thinking” before they signed me up. I
  practically begged them to let me. Thankfully, one day into a dangerously
  stupid three-day initiation course designed by some guy called Paul or Peter
  or Ian, I saw it for what it was, sent an eviscerating email and received a
  full refund. I had found the limit of my wilful gullibility. I found it again
  by accidentally taking part in a ceremony to commune with angels because it
  was advertised as a nice relaxing group meditation. And again, when my local
  gym offered a free rehabilitation program that went against all the prevailing
  advice on treating my condition but conveniently herded me towards a long-term
  membership. These are times when suspending my scepticism has felt like a
  betrayal to myself, when I feel that I’ve been exploited. Now I feel extremely
  protective of other people like me, too sick to necessarily have the clarity
  of mind to tell the false promises of wellness culture from the legit. What
  else? I’ve done 90-minute sessions lying in a sealed hyperbaric oxygen
  chamber, which felt somewhat like road-testing my own coffin. A small,
  frighteningly positive man poked my spine and pulled my arms and pummelled my
  back while he bellowed things like “your immune system works perfectly”. I’ve
  submerged myself in ice-cold bath tubs. Sweated in saunas. Let a man strike a
  drum balanced on my belly so the vibrations would stimulate my cells. Stirred
  mushroom powders into hot water for an alleged boost to my cognitive function.
  Prodded my collar bones, armpits and groin to drain my lymphatic system. Had
  my chakras realigned. Asked a psychic what to do. Drunk what must now be
  gallons of celery juice. All of these things exist on a spectrum of efficacy
  and intentions – from a floret of kale to a full-blown cult. We will each have
  our own quota of what we are able to believe. On hard days, I still worry I’m
  too vulnerable and not discerning enough. On better days, I’m just grateful to
  have things to try. Recently I’ve been going outside first thing, to ask the
  sun to set my circadian rhythm. I down a pint of water and electrolytes. Place
  a little device that looks like a high-end sex toy on my sternum to stimulate
  my vagus nerve. Stand on a vibration plate to move muscles that may otherwise
  atrophy after roughly 900 days of lying down. Dance aggressively to a Selena
  Gomez-heavy playlist to release trapped emotion from my body. Put my legs up a
  wall at every possible opportunity. And guzzle a handful of supplements,
  thinking to myself, at the very least, maybe I can have some placebo effect,
  as a little treat. Do I think these things have helped? Yes. Am I sure about
  that? No. But what else can I do? There is no treatment protocol, no known
  cure for long Covid. Experts disagree on what it even is – tiny blood clots
  preventing oxygen from circulating my body properly? Mitochondrial
  dysfunction? Inflammation? An extreme histamine reaction? Dysautonomia? So
  long as we know so little about something that affects my life so completely,
  there is always the possibility that something wacky could help. Until there
  is an advance in medical science and evidence-based treatments, all I can do
  is hope. Hope, rest, stay hydrated and try my very best not to join a cult
  again.
