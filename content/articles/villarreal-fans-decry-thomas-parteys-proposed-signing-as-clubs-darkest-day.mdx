  News that the former Arsenal midfielder Thomas Partey is poised to join
  Villarreal has upset fans of the Spanish club, with hundreds signing a
  petition urging a halt to what has been described as the “darkest day in the
  club’s history”. Partey appeared in a London court on Tuesday, charged with
  five counts of rape relating to two women and a charge of sexual assault
  against a third woman. The alleged offences are said to have taken place in
  2021 and 2022 when Partey was playing for Arsenal. Partey was granted
  conditional bail on Tuesday and the chief magistrate said he understood that
  the 32‑year‑old would soon be moving to Spain. Villarreal have agreed to sign
  the Ghana international on a one-year contract with an option to extend by 12
  months. Rahul Lakhani, a football journalist and La Liga expert behind the La
  Liga London account, said: “It’s rocked the community. I’ve had people in my
  social media responding quite aggressively to me, saying he’s innocent until
  he’s proven guilty. But the overarching reaction is that Villarreal fans don’t
  want their names associated with him.” On social media scores of fans have
  voiced their opposition to the move, using a hashtag that translates to “No to
  Thomas Partey”. Others have passed around contact details for the club’s
  official channels, urging people to complain. As Arsenal gear up to host
  Villarreal in a friendly on Wednesday, Lakhani described Partey’s potential
  signing as a stain on Villarreal, a club deeply intertwined with its home town
  of 52,000. “They’re seen as someone who isn’t like Real Madrid or Barcelona or
  the [Premier League’s] Big Six,” he said. “They’re the antithesis of that.
  They’re a club that has helped their community a lot, they’re seen as a
  family-run club.” Partey’s arrival would probably alter this image, Lakhani
  said. “Their name is now going to be associated with wanting to sign someone
  who has five [rape] charges over his head, rather than being known as a club
  that plays good football or punches above their weight.” More than 800 people
  have signed a petition that describes the move as a “slap in the face” to the
  club’s supporters and “all victims of sexual abuse worldwide”. The petition
  was launched by the online content hub Villarreal Report, which said this week
  that the signing would be “an act of pure betrayal of the highest order”
  against the club’s supporters and Villarreal’s values. “The darkest day in the
  club’s history is drawing closer by the second,” it said on social media.
  Villarreal did not respond to a request for comment. As Partey’s contract with
  Arsenal neared its expiry date, the club confirmed they were in talks over a
  new contract. After they failed to agree a new deal, it emerged that Partey,
  who has played for Atlético Madrid, Mallorca and Almería, was heading to
  Spain. He was charged not long after he left Arsenal, after an investigation
  that began in 2022. Partey’s lawyer, Jenny Wiltshire, has said previously that
  he “denies all the charges against him” and that he welcomed “the opportunity
  to finally clear his name”. Some Villarreal fans have embraced the prospective
  signing, hinting at the deep divisions sown by Partey’s expected arrival.
  “It’s a top signing, it’s great for the team,” said Borja Jiménez Ortega, who
  heads the L’Os Groc supporters club in Madrid. “I have a lot of confidence in
  the club.” The view was widely shared among the 60 members of his fans group,
  he said. “There’s just two or three who don’t want him.” Others pointed to the
  wider message. “I’m against this signing,” said César Márquez Trabado, the
  president of the supporters club Peña Amarilla Villafranca de los Barros.
  “It’s true he would fit in very well at Villarreal because he’s a player of
  tremendous quality, but I believe there are ethical limits that should not be
  crossed, even if the player has not been convicted of the charges against
  him.” It was a view shared by many, he said. “I would say 90% of fans are
  against this. Because in the end, the team may improve in the short term. But
  in the long term, this will do a lot of damage to our image.”
