  The new pornography taskforce will propose legislation this autumn aimed at
  banning a type of “barely legal” content produced by the porn star Bonnie
  Blue, the Guardian has learned. The proposed action by the independent
  pornography taskforce, launched last month by the Conservative peer Gabby
  Bertin, comes in response to the broadcast of the Channel 4 documentary 1000
  Men and Me: The Bonnie Blue Story. The programme followed the performer for
  six months and included her claim to have had sex with 1,057 clients over the
  course of 12 hours. Visa and Smirnoff are among a number of businesses that
  have pulled online advertisements from streaming of the documentary, after
  reviewing the content. The film was condemned by the children’s commissioner
  for England, Dame Rachel de Souza, for “glamorising and normalising” extreme
  pornography. The documentary also includes footage of Tia Billinger, whose
  stage name is Bonnie Blue, in a classroom preparing to film an orgy with a
  group of models dressed in school uniform; the performers acknowledge that
  they have been selected because they look very young. Lady Bertin said she
  planned to lodge amendments to the crime and policing bill in the autumn to
  make it illegal for online platforms to host any content that could encourage
  child sexual abuse, including pornography filmed by adults dressed as
  children. “This content is pushing at the boundaries. We will be trying to
  address the ‘barely legal’ aspect legislatively,” she said. The Online Safety
  Act charged the regulator Ofcom with monitoring whether pornography sites are
  protecting UK viewers from encountering illegal material involving child
  sexual abuse and extreme content, such as portrayals of rape, bestiality and
  necrophilia. However, other forms of harmful pornography that are regulated
  offline (in cinemas, for example) are not subject to similar restrictions
  online. This regulatory anomaly means adults role-playing as children to
  create pornography that appears close to child sexual abuse imagery is not
  prohibited online. The Channel 4 documentary only showed preparations for the
  classroom scene rather than the footage itself. Clips showing Bonnie Blue
  having sex with more than 1,000 men were pixellated, but the programme has
  still been widely criticised for promoting her brand and for failing to
  challenge adequately her assertion that her activity is harmless. Bertin said
  the documentary would be on the agenda at the taskforce’s next meeting. “She
  has become extremely successful; she is an adult and it is consensual, so it
  may not be harming her, but it has potentially harmful effects on people who
  think that this is a normal way to behave,” she said. “We should be asking
  more about the men who arrive with balaclavas on their head to have sex with
  her.” De Souza said: “For years we have been fighting to protect our children
  from the kind of degrading, violent sex that exists freely on their social
  media feeds. Now this documentary risks taking us a step back by glamorising,
  even normalising the things young people tell me are frightening. Bonnie
  Blue’s content showcases violence against women as entertainment and allows
  sexist ideas that women are ‘lesser’ than men to go unchecked.” Visa’s
  advertisements were placed by a third-party agency, but the company requested
  that they be removed from online streaming of the Channel 4 documentary after
  staff viewed it and judged that the content did not align with its internal
  guidelines. Staff at the drinks company Diageo are assessing how a Smirnoff
  advertisement was cleared to appear during online transmission of the show,
  and have also subsequently pulled their advertising from streaming of the
  programme. An Ofcom spokesperson said the regulator was assessing the
  documentary and would decide whether to launch a formal investigation. The
  policing minister, Diana Johnson, said last week that she would discuss the
  ease with which children could access the documentary on Channel 4’s website
  with ministerial colleagues. Channel 4 requires users to be 16 to register an
  account, but there is no age-verification process, so children could lie about
  their age. A Channel 4 spokesperson said the observational film was designed
  to provoke debate. “The film looks at how Bonnie Blue has gained worldwide
  attention and earned millions of pounds in the last year, exploring changing
  attitudes to sex, success, porn and feminism in an ever-evolving online world.
  Director Victoria Silver puts a number of challenges to Bonnie throughout the
  documentary on the example she sets and how she is perceived, and the film
  clearly lays bare the tactics and strategies she uses, with the audience
  purposefully left to form their own opinions.”
