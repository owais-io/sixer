  The rule is this: don’t spoil movies by giving away the ending, even if the
  events depicted are part of the historical record. But in the case of this
  devastating documentary, knowing what’s coming at the end is a radical
  enhancement, a chilling message from the movie’s future that makes you read
  everything differently. So here’s the big reveal: Fatma Hassona, the young
  Palestinian woman in this film, to whom director Sepideh Farsi talks to via
  video calls over nearly a year, is now dead, killed on 16 April by an Israeli
  airstrike along with several members of her family. In fact, the last we see
  of Hassona is her being told by Farsi that the film we’ve just been watching
  will be shown at the Cannes film festival. This prompts a conversation about
  whether Hassona will attend the premiere (“Of course!” she says,
  optimistically) and perhaps use that trip as an opportunity to leave Gaza for
  good. She demurs politely, insisting that Gaza is her home even if everything
  and everyone is destroyed. This last conversation resonates so deeply because
  Gaza is indeed being ground down to dust. But it’s the audacious austerity of
  Farsi’s film-making that really makes the material sing. As that cheery last
  conversation ends with a humdrum discussion of passports and a promise,
  impossible to keep, to talk again soon, the screen fades to black and bare,
  factual subtitles reveal Hassona’s fate. There’s no soaring string soundtrack,
  no final on-the-nose irony, just the palpable absence of Hassona’s almost
  always smiling face, her laughter, and her irrepressible optimism. The film
  itself consists almost entirely of these often halting video-call
  conversations, interspersed with news reports that Farsi films of live
  broadcasts – and, most importantly, the digital photographs Hassona took
  herself nearly every day. She had aspirations to become a professional
  photographer, and clearly she had an eye. The images show Palestinians in Gaza
  quietly getting on with life against the frayed and collapsing backdrop of the
  city. One of the last clips is a long drive, presumably on a motorcycle or
  bicycle, through streets full of ruins, with kids playing, dust-covered cars
  everywhere, all bedded by snatches of Hassona’s earlier conversations. The one
  that will really get you is the call back to the time when she tried to
  assuage Farsi’s feelings of inadequacy for not being able to help Hassona and
  her community more. “It’s enough that you’re listening to me,” Hassona says.
  “I’m so glad to be here and I’m so glad that you are beside me.” We might
  question whether it is enough that this film memorialises her, but her memory
  will be a blessing. • Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk is in UK and Irish
  cinemas from 22 August.
