  Three thousand riot officers will be deployed and placed on standby amid
  concerns a string of anti-asylum seeker protests and counter-protests this
  weekend could lead to violence and disorder. Police commanders at a national
  level have made the decision. It is the first time since last summer’s riots
  that there has been a mass and national standing up of specialist public order
  officers. Some of the extra riot officers will be deployed on the streets,
  kitted out in helmets and shields to act as a deterrent. Others will be held
  in reserve and all will be on standby to be rushed across England and Wales to
  hotspots of violence and rising tension, a police source with knowledge of the
  planning for this weekend said. The same source stressed there was no specific
  intelligence of violence, but 800 extra riot officers were ordered to be made
  ready on Friday, on top of the 2,200 planned already. At least 20 protests
  targeting hotels used by the government to house asylum seekers are thought
  possible this weekend, with each one in turn potentially attracting a
  counter-protest. As of 8pm on Friday, 10 protests against asylum seekers had
  attracted numbers ranging from the dozens to about 100, according to Hope Not
  Hate, which monitors extremist groups. Stand Up to Racism said about 130 of
  its supporters had faced about 80 protesters in Leeds. In Chestnut, about 100
  protesters against asylum seekers faced 10 anti-racism activists with handmade
  signs. The group said it had a major mobilisation in Islington, facing about
  10 on the other side. One senior officer in an area expecting a protest said:
  “It is impossible to tell what you are going to get. Within crowds you can get
  different factions, concerned locals, bystanders, extremists.” Officers will
  need to keep both sides apart as well as ensure disruption is kept to a
  minimum. The 3,000 riot officers have been requested from local forces and
  will be directed by the National Police Coordination Centre. Local commanders
  will make decisions about specific deployments. In some areas public order
  officers may deploy in full riot gear from the start to act as a deterrent.
  Other forces will prefer to have officers in regular uniforms, so called “soft
  hats”, to start with, with fully kitted riot officers in reserve and close by
  if trouble erupts. The far right is involved in some, if not most, of the
  protests but those attending are expected to include local people concerned by
  claims linking asylum seeker hotels to serious crime. Police public order
  resources this weekend face a pincer movement from right and left. The
  Metropolitan police is calling in support from other forces as it faces three
  days of substantial public order challenges, including an anti-migrant protest
  in Islington, north London, on Friday night, with more are expected at another
  in Canary Wharf on Sunday. On Saturday in central London there will be a
  pro-Palestine march, along with a protest encouraging supporters of Palestine
  Action – and opponents of its ban under terrorism laws – to dare police to
  arrest them. Organisers and police sources agree privately hundreds are likely
  to turn up, the range likely to be 200 to just under 1,000, encouraged to hold
  placards containing the words “I support Palestine Action”, which police say
  will lead to arrest. Organisers hope to stretch to breaking point the police
  and criminal justice system’s ability to deal with a mass defiance. Police
  believe they will manage unless the numbers exceed expectations. In London,
  small groups of protesters started to gather from about 5pm on Friday across
  the road from the Britannia International hotel in Canary Wharf. Riot police
  scrambled to keep groups of masked men who broke away from the anti-asylum
  seeker protest from reaching a separate group of anti-racism activists who had
  attempted to walk down to the hotel. About 200 anti-migrant protesters –
  including men waving St George’s flags and an Israeli flag – had gathered
  across the road from the hotel, with some hurling abuse at a Stand Up to
  Racism protest of about 100 activists, trade unionists and others. Police kept
  a distance but vans with public order officers were also stationed in streets
  nearby. Two people were arrested. On Sunday in London, there will be a march
  in support of the release of hostages taken from Israel by Hamas in the 7
  October 2023 attack, as well as football’s Community Shield match. The start
  of football’s lower divisions this weekend will also require police resources.
  Metropolitan police deputy assistant commissioner Ade Adelekan, who will lead
  the policing operation, warned people who want to protest against the banning
  of Palestine Action that they should expect a terrorism charge. She said:
  “Anyone showing support for Palestine Action can expect to be arrested. An
  arrest under the Terrorism Act can have very real long-term implications –
  from travel, to employment, to finances.” There was some unease in Nuneaton on
  Friday afternoon, before what is expected to be a big turnout at a protest
  outside the council building on Saturday. The Warwickshire town has become a
  target for far-right activists in recent days, after two Afghan men were
  arrested on suspicion of kidnapping and raping a 12-year-old girl. They have
  now been charged in relation to the alleged incident. The Reform UK council
  leader, 19-year-old George Finch, accused the police of covering up the claim
  that the men, Ahmad Mulakhil and Mohammad Kabir, are asylum seekers. A group
  of retired women sitting outside a cafe said they supported the protest. “I
  think it’s good … They’re only protecting the children. That’s all they’re
  doing,” said one woman, who would not give her name because “you can’t have an
  opinion because you’ll get locked up”. Warwickshire’s police chief constable,
  Alex Franklin-Smith, took the unusual step of publishing a letter to Finch on
  Wednesday, writing that the police had asked the Home Office to confirm the
  immigration status of the two men accused in connection with the alleged rape,
  and “did not and will not cover up such criminality”. Care workers Chijioke
  “CJ” Ani and Musa Samson, both originally from Nigeria, had also heard about
  the protest. Ani said he would go to work and go home, and not stay in the
  town on Saturday. He said he had seen a lot of anti-immigration sentiment on
  social media. “Some of them are misinformed or acting out of impulse,” he
  said. “It makes me feel like someone will attack me someday. It’s definitely
  getting worse because the far right are getting stronger.” While the men,
  originally from Nigeria, had found Nuneaton to be a friendly town, Samson said
  he had experienced some racism with men making noises at him as he approached
  a local bar. Most people the Guardian spoke to in Nuneaton said they would be
  avoiding the town centre. Lawrence McIntyre was serving teas and coffees from
  The Kiosk in the town centre. He said: “I do feel sorry if it does put people
  off coming down shopping. The market traders and the small businesses, they
  rely on [customers].” He said there had been plenty of diversity in the town
  for a long time and it had not been a problem until now. In Altrincham,
  Greater Manchester, protesters and counter-protesters were separated by a busy
  road outside the Cresta Court hotel. Far-right agitators were met locals who
  shouted about apparent crimes that they said asylum seekers had committed. “Go
  back to where you’ve come from, we don’t want you,” shouted one woman towards
  the hotel. On the other side of the road, counter-protesters chanted that
  refugees were welcome. In a rare moment of unity, the far right began singing
  “fuck Keir Starmer” to the tune of Seven Nation Army by the White Stripes and
  the anti-fascists joined in. • This article was amended on 9 August 2025. An
  earlier version had an embedded image which was said to show “anti-migrant
  demonstrators”. In fact, these protesters were supporting asylum seekers.
