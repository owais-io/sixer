  An appeals court on Friday tossed out a judge’s finding of contempt against
  the Trump administration in a case over the notorious deportations of
  Venezuelans from the US to an El Salvador prison without due process. The
  decision from a divided three-judge panel based in the nation’s capital
  vacates a finding from US district judge James Boasberg. Boasberg found in
  April there was probable cause to hold Donald Trump’s administration in
  criminal contempt of court for willfully disregarding his 15 March order
  barring the deportations to El Salvador of more than 250 Venezuelans from
  immigration detention in the US to a brutal prison in the Central American
  country, under an agreement with the Salvadorian leadership, without the
  chance to challenge their removals. The Trump administration appealed. On
  Friday, Washington DC circuit judges Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao, both of
  whom were nominated by Trump in his first term in the White House, concurred
  with the unsigned majority opinion. Judge Cornelia Pillard, who was appointed
  by Barack Obama when he was president, dissented. Boasberg had accused Trump
  administration officials of rushing deportees out of the country under the
  1798 Alien Enemies Act before they could challenge their removal in court and
  then willfully disregarding his order that planes already in the air should
  return to the US. The Republican administration has denied violating his
  order. “The district court’s order raises troubling questions about judicial
  control over core executive functions like the conduct of foreign policy and
  the prosecution of criminal offenses,” circuit judge Katsas wrote in an
  opinion. The Trump administration claimed that all the Venezuelans it removed
  to El Salvador outside the normal constitutional process were violent gang
  members, which many of the deportees denied and critics said, regardless of
  any of the individuals’ criminal guilt or innocence, did not justify denying
  them due process in the US. The episode has been one of the most high-profile
  of the second Trump administration’s aggressive anti-immigration agenda, in
  addition to widespread raids and arrests by Immigration and Customs
  Enforcement (Ice) officers in communities across the country. “The district
  court’s order attempts to control the Executive Branch’s conduct of foreign
  affairs, an area in which a court’s power is at its lowest ebb,” Rao wrote.
  Pillard dissented. “The majority does an exemplary judge a grave disservice by
  overstepping its bounds to upend his effort to vindicate the judicial
  authority that is our shared trust,” she wrote. The 250 migrants have since
  been released back to their home country in a prisoner swap with the US after
  months at the mega-prison known as the Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot).
  The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, celebrated the appeals court ruling,
  calling it a “MAJOR victory defending President Trump’s use of the Alien
  Enemies Act” in a social media post and vowing to “continue fighting and
  WINNING in court”. Lee Gelernt, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney who
  represented the migrants, said there was “zero ambiguity” in Boasberg’s order
  about the planes. “We strongly disagree with today’s decision regarding
  contempt and are considering all options going forward,” he said. The
