  Somnium review – dream-injection sci-fi plot follows in dodgy-clinic tracks of
  The Substance
sectionName: Film
webPublicationDate: '2025-09-01T06:00:52Z'
bodyText: >-
  Hard on the heels of The Substance comes another film about a dodgy Los
  Angeles experimental clinic and showbiz obsession – only this medical outfit,
  Somnium, is a shonky mind-fixing operation à la Eternal Sunshine of the
  Spotless Mind. Wannabe actor Gemma (Chloë Levine) lands a “sleep-sitting” job
  at the firm, watching over patients in pods who are hoping to improve their
  lives by having helpful dreams injected into their subconsciouses. Already
  working the audition circuit hard, she doesn’t appear to need that kind of
  assistance – but flashbacks to the idyllic relationship she ditched in Georgia
  hint at a festering inner wound. Appealing though its crisp sci-fi premise
  makes it, Racheal Cain’s debut feature nonetheless feels as if it has been
  directly imprinted with far too many secondhand pop-cultural memories: some
  decaying Eternal Sunshine relationship detritus here, a mysterious producer
  svengali (Johnathon Schaech) and a transformative audition-room scene straight
  from Mulholland Drive over there. Even one of the key performances feels
  derivative: Will Peltz as Noah, Gemma’s creepy, aviator-specs colleague,
  xeroxes Cillian Murphy’s supercilious distaste. All these elements feel like
  cartoonish reductions; apart from the vague umbrella-label of dreams, none
  feel as if they are heading anywhere purposeful. The Hollywood and Somnium
  plotlines are finally forced into a room together, as Noah lures Gemma into a
  therapy pod for reasons as fathomable as the troglodyte lurker she glimpses
  everywhere. But even her mind seems intent on selling her character short:
  humiliation-by-chatshow feels like a horribly off-the-peg fantasy (the 2020
  film Come True is far more memorable and flamboyant as far as low-budget
  dreamscapes go). Levine is consistently deft in conveying Gemma’s peppy
  desperation; if only Cain didn’t display a similar lack of confidence in
  staking out her own territory for the film. It may think it is tilting at the
  dream factory, but Somnium simply feels tired. • Somnium is on digital
  platforms from 8 September.
