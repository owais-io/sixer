  A key chapter in the fascist playbook has always been to convince the public
  that it is living in such a state of mortal danger and unbridled chaos that
  the only chance of survival is to cede individual rights to the determined
  will of the Dear Leader. That’s why fascist leaders have constantly demanded
  that their populations venerate all violence performed in the service of the
  state and revere the apparatuses of state violence, such as police forces and
  the military. In this scenario, state violence is not only necessary for the
  nation’s survival. State violence is understood as even beautiful, something
  the public can and must believe in. Buying into state violence this way
  produces something historian Robert Paxton has called a “mobilizing passion”.
  In his book The Anatomy of Fascism, Paxton described how “the beauty of
  violence and the efficacy of will” is produced and then mobilized by fascists
  by creating “a sense of overwhelming crisis beyond the reach of traditional
  solutions”. In other words, there’s always a grave, existential threat lurking
  around every corner, and only fascist violence can restore order to a lawless
  world. To the fascist, as Umberto Eco once put it, “life is a permanent war”.
  Enter Donald Trump. Whether it’s an existential threat of “wokeness” run amok
  in American universities, or the extraordinary danger of unauthorized
  immigrants picking our vegetables, Trump is prepared to battle everyone and
  everything, including his own windmills, to restore the country to some
  illusory past glory that we are all supposed to believe in, and be willing to
  sacrifice ourselves for. But the sad truth is that many, if not most, of
  Trump’s justifications for his policies, are unsurprisingly based on
  bald-faced lies or gross exaggerations simply to further his pursuit of
  absolute power. Yet it doesn’t seem to matter. With each new announcement,
  Trump continues to prove how excellent he is at crafting the illusion of
  problems where there basically are none and leading his followers down an
  often-violent path of retribution. (Remember January 6, DC’s most violent day
  in recent history?) By doing so, he seeks to constantly expand his authority
  while also deflecting from all the substantial problems that are staring him
  in the face. And these problems are not insignificant. Think of the Jeffrey
  Epstein scandal or the continuation of global conflicts that he promised
  months ago he would uniquely be able to end. The federal takeover of the
  Washington DC police department, announced with loud fanfare by Trump on
  Monday, is the latest example of this phenomenon. About 800 national guard
  troops will be deployed in the nation’s capital because, according to the
  president, “our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and
  bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs, and
  homeless people.” This does sound rather frightening. Fortunately, it’s not
  true. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to matter. First, the facts. Crime in DC
  is at historic lows. “Total violent crime for 2024 in the District of Columbia
  is down 35% from 2023 and is the lowest it has been in over 30 years,” the
  justice department announced earlier this year. And crime numbers for 2025 are
  even better, substantially lower than 2024. Violent crime in 2025 is down 26%
  compared with 2024. The DC council understands this. The council responded to
  Trump’s announcement with an angry joint statement: “This is a manufactured
  intrusion on local authority. Violent crime in the District is at the lowest
  rates we’ve seen in 30 years. Federalizing the DC police is unwarranted
  because there is no Federal emergency. Further, the National Guard has no
  public safety training or knowledge of local laws. The Guard’s role does not
  include investigating or solving crimes in the District. Calling out the
  National Guard is an unnecessary deployment with no real mission.” Such facts
  ought to matter. So why don’t they to Trump? Facts don’t matter for Trump
  because facts have always operated as nothing more than an inconvenience for
  him. Just ask Erika McEntarfer, former commissioner of the Bureau of Labor
  Statistics. She was recently fired by Trump after accurately reporting
  employment statistics, and those specific numbers contradicted Trump and his
  policies. But with every new policy enacted by this administration, Trump’s
  fact-free worldview becomes a lot more worrisome. That’s true for this policy,
  too. Owing to its historically limited autonomy, the District of Columbia is
  governed differently than other parts of the county. And under the Home Rule
  Act of 1973,the federal government can take over its policing functions for a
  period of 30 days. Congress would probably then have to extend that time limit
  if needed. But to think that Trump is focused on federal policing authority
  solely to deploy it to Washington DC is to also believe that Donald Trump has
  never seen a spray tan machine. Here is Trump: “We have other cities also that
  are bad, very bad,” he said at his press conference. “You look at Chicago, how
  bad it is. You look at Los Angeles, how bad it is. We have other cities that
  are very bad. New York is a problem. And then you have of course Baltimore and
  Oakland. We don’t even mention that any more, they’re so far gone. We’re not
  going to let it happen. We’re not going to lose our cities over this. And this
  will go further. We’re starting very strongly with DC.” Now, here are the
  facts. In Chicago, homicides are down 33% in 2025. Los Angeles had the “lowest
  homicide total in nearly 60 years” in 2025. New York’s police department is
  reporting that “from January 2025 through May 2025, New York City experienced
  the lowest number of shootings and murders in recorded history.” The Baltimore
  police department has stated that 2025 “continues to see double-digit
  reductions in gun violence, including a 22% decrease in homicides”. And the
  Oakland police department reported last week “that overall crime in Oakland
  has dropped by 28% in the first six months of 2025” including a 24% decrease
  in homicides. Donald Trump wants to take over all forms of law enforcement in
  the United States, from local policing to the Immigration and Customs
  Enforcement (Ice) agency that is now pumped up on budgetary steroids. (Under
  Trump’s so-called big, beautiful bill, Ice will now expand to become the
  largest federal law enforcement agency in US history, with a bigger budget
  than most nations’ militaries.) Trump’s desire to control all forms of state
  power, and to expand them beyond belief, is a move straight out of the fascist
  playbook. And it’s completely dependent on the production of both
  extraordinary fear and blatant lies. The first way of fighting such an obvious
  power grab is not to give in to the fear and not to believe the lies. But what
  is less understood about Trump is that he doesn’t even care if we believe his
  lies. Like all such leaders, what Trump really wants is just that we no longer
  believe in the truth. The difference between not believing the lies and
  believing in the truth may sound slight, but it’s exactly in that distinction
  where some people are allowed to live and others must die. It’s where
  democracy is found or democracy is lost. And it’s why holding on to the very
  concept of truth ultimately matters so much more than just arguing over the
  lies. Moustafa Bayoumi is the author of the award-winning books How Does It
