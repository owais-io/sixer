  You’ve played many prestigious venues in your career. How do you feel about
  gracing the Sydney Opera House stage? It’s on a lot of people’s bucket list,
  so I’m very excited. I’ve been doing this show [Don’t Tell Anybody the
  Secrets, based on Williams’ memoir] at different venues. When I play, I always
  tell a little story about each song anyway, but this is where I stretch out
  and go more into detail, and I’ve got a visual screen behind me showing
  photographs of some of the characters I refer to in the songs. It’s similar to
  Bruce Springsteen’s Broadway show. You’re touring with Paul Kelly, who’s a
  national treasure here, but not as celebrated in Europe and America. Should he
  be better known beyond our shores? Yes. Absolutely. That’s one of the issues
  in America that really bothers me, because if someone stands out, instead of
  holding them up, we just call them a cult artist or whatever. When I was first
  starting out, the record companies kept saying they didn’t know what to do
  with me, because my music fell between the cracks between country and rock,
  which is now referred to as Americana. Being unique and original doesn’t
  always work in the record business. It’s all about marketing. You had a stroke
  in November 2020. Can you describe your recovery – can you play guitar any
  better now? I can sing better; I can’t play guitar better. But I’ve been
  blessed with two brilliant guitar players, Doug Pettibone, who’s been with me
  for a while, and a new one, Marc Ford, who was in the Black Crowes. It works
  really well, I can just concentrate on my singing. A lot of people have
  approached me and said that my singing was better now than it was before my
  stroke. What’s the most memorable first date you’ve been on, good or bad? Oh,
  Gawd. First of all, I didn’t like the whole idea of dating, because I was so
  shy. The whole idea of going out to dinner and a movie would just terrify me,
  because I would just feel really self-conscious. But I remember being asked to
  dinner by this guy, and sitting down at the table and hearing him say he’d
  already eaten. That just really turned me off. I thought it was extremely
  rude. What’s the best lesson you’ve learned from someone you’ve worked with? I
  was working with an engineer, Dusty Wakeman, on the Sweet Old World album. I
  was complaining about an itty-bitty tiny mistake that I’d made, and he told me
  about how Native American Indians, when they’d weave a blanket, they would
  leave a mistake in the weaving on purpose. You are a road warrior. When you
  check in to a hotel, what’s the first thing you do? I’m a road worrier! People
  tease me all the time about worrying too much. What’s the first thing I do?
  Well, it depends on if we have a show that night or what’s going on. But after
  we check in, I like to sit down in a regular chair or on the couch. Just to be
  able to be off the bus and sit in a regular piece of furniture feels really
  good. What was the song you last played on Spotify? I don’t use Spotify.
  Mainly because, you know, the artists hardly get paid. My music’s not on
  Spotify. [Lucinda’s husband and manager Tom Overby interjects off camera: “Yes
  it is!”] Oh, wait a minute. I made a mistake. Would you consider withdrawing
  your music from Spotify, as Neil Young did temporarily, and King Gizzard and
  the Lizard Wizard have more recently? [Tom in background: “Yes, we may.”] Yes,
  we may do that. [Raises voice] Manager/husband Tom said yes, we may withdraw
  my music from Spotify! … I think the new album probably won’t be available on
  there. You have to make a stand and get your message across when this sort of
  thing crops up. I’ve enjoyed your Lu’s Jukebox series, particularly the album
  of Tom Petty covers, Runnin’ Down a Dream. What’s a song you wish you’d
  written? Oh, so many. That’s the thing that’s probably the hardest about
  covering other people’s material. So many of Tom Petty’s and so many of Bob
  Dylan’s songs I wish I’d written. One of the Tom Petty ones that really struck
  me was Room At the Top. And of course Runnin’ Down a Dream too, it just goes
  on and on. He was just great. What’s the weirdest thing you have done for
  love? The weirdest thing I’ve done for love? OK … the weirdest thing I’ve done
  for love. That adds a different element … It’s not called 10 chaotic questions
  for nothing! OK, does this count? I got married on stage [to Tom] at First
  Avenue, the eponymous venue in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Lucinda Williams is
  touring with Paul Kelly around Australia and New Zealand from 26 August to 12
  September. See here for all dates
