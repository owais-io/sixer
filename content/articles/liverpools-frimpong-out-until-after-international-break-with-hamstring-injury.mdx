  Liverpool will be without new signing Jeremie Frimpong until after the next
  international break as a result of a hamstring injury. Conor Bradley is in
  contention to replace Frimpong having recovered from a hamstring injury of his
  own. Frimpong suffered the setback during the Premier League opener against
  Bournemouth, when he was replaced on the hour mark, and the head coach, Arne
  Slot, revealed the injury could have been worse but for the intervention of
  Liverpool’s medical team. The £29.5m signing from Bayer Leverkusen is likely
  to be out for four weeks but, with the first international break of the season
  from 1-9 September, the only games he should miss for Liverpool are Monday’s
  visit to Newcastle and the home match against Arsenal next Sunday. Slot said:
  “Conor trained for a few minutes with us today for the first time. The medical
  team were completely right about Jeremie and to tell me that I had to take him
  off because he is out until the end of the international break. “I think I got
  criticised a bit for taking him off. It had nothing to do with how he played
  but we felt he had an issue with his hamstring and by we, I mean the medical
  staff. They were completely right. It was a good call to take him off,
  otherwise he maybe would have been out for longer. We expect to have him back
  after the international break.” Bradley is not guaranteed to start at St
  James’ Park given he has been out for several weeks while Joe Gomez, another
  potential replacement for Frimpong, has just recovered from an achilles
  injury. “At the moment we only have two injuries but unfortunately it is two
  in the same position,” Slot added. “The good thing is we have other players
  that can play there. Wataru [Endo] played there for a few minutes, Dominik
  Szoboszlai has already played there. There are other options we can explore.
  Joe Gomez is definitely one of them but for him to already play 20 minutes
  [against Bournemouth] that is already quite a lot. “I wouldn’t say [Gomez] has
  had a setback but he wasn’t able to train three days in a row completely with
  the team, which is completely normal when you have been out for so long and
  all of a sudden the manager needs you for 20 minutes. He is training with the
  team, so let’s see where he is on Monday and if he can be involved with the
  team or even start. But there are other options.”
