  content. He overlooks one key point

  Australia should adopt US-style copyright law to allow artificial intelligence
  to suck up all creative content or risk harming investment in the industry in
  Australia, according to the Atlassian founder Scott Farquhar. Farquhar, the
  Tech Council of Australia chief executive, told ABC’s 7.30 program on Tuesday:
  “All AI usage of mining or searching or going across data is probably illegal
  under Australian law and I think that hurts a lot of investment of these
  companies in Australia.” This was because, he said, Australia doesn’t have
  fair use exemptions coded into copyright law like the US does. Farquhar’s
  claim overlooks that this is not a settled issue in the US, and could have
  devastating effects on creative industries. Companies developing AI, including
  Atlassian, Google and Meta, want a text and data mining exemption put into
  copyright law to make AI able to train on all human works in perpetuity
  without paying for it. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Farquhar’s argument is
  that it is not theft of people’s work unless the AI is used to “copy an artist
  directly”, such as creating a song in their style. “I do think people would
  say that, hey, if people are going to sit down with a digital companion, an AI
  song creator and they collaboratively work with an AI to create something new
  to the world, that’s probably fair use.” Farquhar said the benefits of large
  language models outweighed the issues raised by AI training its data on other
  people’s work for free. His argument hinges on whether that AI then goes on to
  create something “new and novel” which is referred to in copyright as being
  transformative – creating something new. He said he would have no issue with
  someone taking what he had created and using it as long as it was
  “transformative”. “If someone had used my intellectual property to compete
  with me, then I think that is an issue, directly with me. If they’d used all
  the intellectual property of all the software on the world to help people
  write software better in the future, I think that is a fair use.” US law is
  not settled on AI training being fair use. The US Copyright Office noted in
  its May pre-print report on generative AI training that there are dozens of
  lawsuits challenging AI companies using fair use as an excuse for training
  large-language models on copyrighted works without paying. In the US, there
  are also factors to consider whether something is fair use include: Whether
  the use is commercial or not. The nature of the copyrighted work. The amount
  used of the copyrighted work. The effect of the use on the market for or value
  of the copyrighted work. In US case law, the transformative nature of what is
  made of what was taken is the first important factor in fair use, the
  Australian law firm Gilbert + Tobin noted in a May publication but it is not
  the only factor to consider, with the impact on the market of the copyrighted
  work being key. The US supreme court has twice described this as “undoubtedly
  the single most important element of fair use”, according to the US Copyright
  Office report. “The copying involved in AI training threatens significant
  potential harm to the market for or value of copyrighted works,” the report
  said. “Where a model can produce substantially similar outputs that directly
  substitute for works in the training data, it can lead to lost sales. “Even
  where a model’s outputs are not substantially similar to any specific
  copyrighted work, they can dilute the market for works similar to those found
  in its training data, including by generating material stylistically similar
  to those works.” The Copyright Office stopped short of recommending
  legislative intervention in the US, noting that voluntary licensing were
  already under way with some AI companies, and allowing licensing would allow
  AI innovation to continue to “advance without undermining intellectual
  property rights.” Farquhar’s argument that how generative AI uses copyrighted
  works would stack up if there were proper guarantees that all usage would be
  transformative and would not affect the markets from which they’re drawing
  from. In many of the industries, AI could have devastating effects. In news,
  for example, AI summaries in Google search already mean people click through
  to stories less frequently for information, and referrals from AI chatbots
  compared to the amount of times that AI crawls a page are even worse. To argue
  that fair use for AI based on the US law is something Australia should aspire
  to overlooks that it’s hardly settled law, and is being hard fought in the
  courts. Rushing to give the tech companies what they want in the name of
  innovation for one new industry could come at the expense of many other
  industries.
