  The discovery of a previously unknown portrait miniature by one of Elizabethan
  England’s greatest artists would be significant enough. But a work by Nicholas
  Hilliard that has come to light is all the more exciting because it has a
  possible link to William Shakespeare, and a 400-year-old enigma of a defaced
  red heart on its reverse, suggesting a love scorned. Hilliard was Queen
  Elizabeth I’s official limner, or miniature painter. His exquisite portraits,
  small enough to fit in the palm of one’s hand, are among the most revered
  masterpieces of 16th-century British and European art. This example depicts an
  androgynous, bejewelled young sitter with long ringlets, thought to be the
  earliest known likeness of Henry Wriothesley, 3rd earl of Southampton,
  Shakespeare’s friend and patron – and possibly the “fair youth” of the
  sonnets, as some have speculated. Shakespeare dedicated his two erotic poems,
  Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece, to Southampton, declaring: “The love
  I dedicate to your lordship is without end.” Such miniatures were painted on
  vellum as thin as onion skin that was pasted on to playing cards for a stiff
  support. This portrait’s reverse reveals a card whose red heart has been
  painted over with a black spear or spade, seemingly indicating a broken heart.
  The portrait has been identified by the leading art historians Dr Elizabeth
  Goldring and Emma Rutherford, who were taken aback by the defacement.
  Goldring, an honorary reader at the University of Warwick and author of an
  award-winning Hilliard biography, told the Guardian: “You always know that
  there’s a chance that there could be a clue on the back or tucked inside the
  frame, but there almost never is. On this occasion, there was – and it was
  absolutely thrilling. Shivers down the spine. Someone had gone to great effort
  to spoil the back of this work.” Rutherford, the founder of the Limner
  Company, a consultancy and dealership, said: “I can’t find any other evidence
  of this sort of vandalism. Everybody would have known that a miniature would
  be backed by a playing card, but the playing card back was never visible.
  Originally, this would have been encased in a very expensive, possibly
  jewelled locket. You’d have to get the miniature out of the locket in order to
  vandalise the back like this. So it is an extraordinary discovery, a
  400-year-old mystery.” Their research, jointly written with Prof Sir Jonathan
  Bate, a leading Shakespeare scholar, is published in the Times Literary
  Supplement on 5 September. They write: “The fact that the heart has been
  painted over with a spade, or spear, inevitably calls to … mind thoughts of
  Shakespeare, whose coat of arms, drawn up c1602, incorporated a spear as a pun
  on his surname – though virtually nothing is known with certainty of
  Shakespeare’s interactions with Southampton.” Goldring said: “The discovery of
  this miniature will, I suspect, reignite debate about the nature of the
  relationship between Shakespeare and his patron Southampton, including the
  possibility that Southampton may have been an inspiration for some of the
  sonnets.” The historians suggest there is the possibility that this portrait
  was a gift from Southampton to Shakespeare who returned it, perhaps in 1598,
  the year that he married. Within the late Elizabethan court, Southampton was
  known for his androgynous beauty, his vanity and his love of poetry. In the
  1590s, John Clapham’s Narcissus – a retelling of the Ovidian tale of a
  beautiful youth who falls in love with his own image – was dedicated to him,
  and in the dedication to The Unfortunate Traveller, Thomas Nashe praised
  Southampton: “A dere lover and cherisher you are, as well of the lovers of
  Poets, as of Poets themselves.” The portrait’s owners have a family connection
  to Southampton, but they were unaware of Hilliard’s hand or the work’s
  significance, having long kept it in a box. They contacted Goldring and
  Rutherford after reading of their discovery of another Hilliard miniature.
  Rutherford said: “This has never been published. It’s never been seen in
  public.” They believe that it depicts Southampton in the early 1590s, when he
  was in his late teens, shortly before Shakespeare attracted his patronage.
  Addressing the “endlessly debated” identity of the addressee of Shakespeare’s
  sonnets, they write: “Again and again, the sonnets return to the fair youth’s
  androgynous beauty. So, for example, in sonnet 99 his hair is compared to
  ‘marjoram’, the tendrils of which are long and curly: could this be an
  allusion to Southampton’s distinctive long ringlets?” They argue that
  everything about this miniature, including the sitter’s gesture of clasping
  his cascading ringlets of auburn hair to his heart, suggests an intimate
  image. Long hair was unusual at the late Elizabethan court, Rutherford said.
  “We know there was some criticism of how long hair made men ‘womanish’.” Two
  pearl bracelets adorn the sitter’s wrist. Rutherford said bracelets, though
  frequently encountered in portraits of women in this period, were rarely seen
  in portraits of men. She added that when someone first looks at the portrait,
  they struggle initially to determine whether it represents a man or a woman.
  “It’s just extraordinary. It has to be one of the earliest English homoerotic
  images.”
