  On Sunday the Lionesses clinched a historic victory in the Euros final against
  Spain, becoming the first England team to win a major international tournament
  abroad. As a clinical psychologist who works with professional athletes and
  sports teams, I know that discipline and aggression will have played an
  important role in their victory – but that habits and hobbies off the pitch
  might have been just as vital. In the training camp, away from the spotlight
  and competition of the tournament, the Lionesses would come together in the
  evenings to engage in wholesome activities including building Lego, doing
  jigsaws and playing Monopoly. Michelle Agyemang played a piano in her room.
  Defender Lotte Wubben-Moy brought a sourdough starter from home for the team
  chef to feed. They were also encouraged to spend time with their families and
  to talk and journal about “how they had made it to the Euros, their
  footballing journeys and the personal battles they had faced”. Mastering
  professional sport requires resilience, composure and an ability to navigate
  the highs and lows inherent in competition. Highs – such as when an important
  match is won and the stadium roars with approval – kick players’ sympathetic
  nervous systems into overdrive as the neurotransmitters adrenaline and
  dopamine are released. In this state, returning to a hotel room to sleep and
  recover ahead of upcoming fixtures can feel virtually impossible. It’s not
  uncommon for athletes to continue to seek out dopamine hits in the form of
  intense physical exercise, alcohol, social-media feedback, gaming or gambling
  – all of which can have negative outcomes. Similarly, when athletes experience
  a low – a day off, the off-season, an injury or retirement – their mood can
  plummet. Not only is there now ample time to ruminate on negative thoughts,
  but their brain chemistry is suddenly deprived of all that lovely
  pleasure-inducing dopamine as the highs of winning subside and social-media
  feedback wanes. All too often, the instinct is to pursue dopamine through
  other, potentially harmful stimuli because it feels too uncomfortable to
  tolerate the sense of lacking something. Little sympathy is often felt by the
  public towards football stars who appear seemingly reckless in their
  behaviours off the pitch, but in reality they are sliding down a slippery
  slope of addiction and are desperately fighting to get off. Managing the
  cognitive, emotional and neurotransmitter-fuelled rollercoaster inherent in
  sport is crucial for athletes if they want to avoid emotional dysregulation,
  depression, addiction and burnout. Here’s where the Lionesses played a blinder
  with their choice of downtime occupations. Low-tech, slower activities such as
  Lego, puzzles and journalling, as well as being engaging and satisfying,
  provide an off-ramp for dopamine chasing. They allow players to build
  emotional and psychological resilience. If you’ve ever attempted a complex
  Lego build – like the forward Lauren Hemp, who reportedly built a Beauty and
  the Beast castle during the Euros – you’ll know all too well the level of
  patience required. Tolerating the discomfort of a fiddly project can help
  build emotional regulation and resilience – vital for managing uncomfortable
  pressure points on the pitch. Many of the Lionesses’ purported pastimes were
  also low- or no-tech. In choosing to play an instrument or give each other
  beauty treatments (defender Esme Morgan was reportedly the woman to see about
  lash lifts), the Lionesses were giving their sympathetic nervous systems an
  opportunity to switch off, allowing for faster recovery. Moreover, in doing
  non-football related activities together during their leisure time, the
  players opened up space for social and emotional connectedness – a key
  component of a cohesive and connected team. The type of calm, low-tech,
  collaborative activities practised by the Lionesses during the Euros provided
  balance between the rush of fast-paced highs and the discomfort of tolerating
  uncomfortable, slower-paced moments. It’s this balance that our minds and
  bodies need to sustain the physical fitness and mental stamina required to
  meet the demands of a major tournament – and it’s this balance that has been a
  key ingredient of England’s success. We can’t all be Lionesses, but we can
  learn from them. When the going gets tough, the tough … do jigsaws. Dr Amy
