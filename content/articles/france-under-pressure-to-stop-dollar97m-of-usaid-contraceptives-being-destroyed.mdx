  The French government has said it is closely monitoring a US plan to destroy
  millions of dollars of contraceptives stocked in Europe after outrage from
  French feminists, rights groups and family planning organisations at what they
  called a wasteful attack on women’s rights. The Guardian reported this month
  that Donald Trump’s administration planned to destroy $9.7m of contraceptives
  that are believed to be in a warehouse in Belgium but may be moved to France
  for incineration. They are mostly long-acting contraceptives such as IUDs and
  birth control implants, which had been bought under public health programmes
  run by the US Agency for International Development and were probably intended
  for women in Africa. A US state department spokesperson told Agence
  France-Presse this week that “a preliminary decision was made to destroy”
  certain birth control products from “terminated Biden-era USAID contracts”.
  Trump’s administration dismantled USAID, the country’s foreign aid armbody, in
  January. The spokesperson said the destruction would cost $167,000 and “no HIV
  medications or condoms are being destroyed”. The contraceptives, stored in a
  warehouse in Geel in Belgium, were reportedly planned to be incinerated in
  France, although there has been no confirmation of this by France. France and
  Belgium are under pressure to prevent any destruction. The French health
  ministry said in a statement: “We are following this situation closely and we
  support the will of the Belgian authorities to find a solution to avoid the
  destruction of contraceptives. “The defence of sexual health and reproductive
  rights is a foreign policy priority for France.” This week a collective of
  rights groups, feminists organisations and trade unions in France launched a
  petition to stop the destruction of the contraceptives. “We won’t allow this
  unfair and sexist decision to go ahead, it’s both an economic and human
  waste,” they said. The French Green leader, Marine Tondelier, signed an open
  letter calling on the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to intervene to stop
  the contraceptives from being destroyed. “Our country cannot be complicit,
  even indirectly, in retrograde policies,” the letter said. Céline
  Thiébault-Martinez, a Socialist lawmaker, told France Inter radio on Thursday
  that if France failed to speak out on the destruction of these contraceptives
  it would “lose credibility with women”. Sarah Durocher, the head of a French
  family planning group, said: “France has a moral responsibility to act.”
  Charles Dallara, whose politician grandfather Lucien Neuwirth backed the
  French law authorising oral contraceptives in 1967, wrote an open letter to
  Macron in which he urged the president not to “let France become complicit in
  this scandal”. The Belgian government said it was in urgent contact with the
  US but it could not say yet whether the contraceptives had already been moved
  to France. A spokesperson for the foreign affairs department said it contacted
  the US embassy in Brussels as soon as it became aware of the possible
  destruction of contraception stocks held in the Geel warehouse. “Foreign
  affairs is exploring all possible avenues to prevent the destruction of these
  stocks, including their temporary relocation,” they added. “We do not
  currently have additional details that would confirm whether a transfer of
  these products to France has taken place.” The international organisation MSI
  Reproductive Choices said it had offered to “purchase, repackage, and manage
  logistics at our expense, ensuring the products reach those in need”, but the
  offer was rejected. The International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF)
  made a similar offer at “no cost to the US government” that was also turned
  down, AFP reported.
