  No actor defined the 2010s more than Jennifer Lawrence. Less than halfway into
  the decade, at the age of 22, Lawrence had won the hearts of audiences as the
  hero Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games, and a best actress Oscar for her
  performance in Silver Linings Playbook (famously tripping en route to accept
  it). She was bold, beautiful, brash and inescapable; her self-deprecating
  humour paired with megawatt talent made her a messiah for millennials – until
  she wasn’t. By the decade’s midpoint, the internet seemed to sour on Lawrence
  as quickly as it had fallen in love with her. Her foot-in-mouth disease began
  to offend instead of charm, and her dominance in the media teetered into
  overexposure. “I just think everybody had gotten sick of me,” she reflected in
  2021. “I’d gotten sick of me.” This period saw the release of Lawrence’s most
  provocative project to date. Part home invasion thriller, part religious
  parable – Mother! follows Lawrence’s unnamed protagonist as she tends to the
  home shared with her aloof husband, a poet played by Javier Bardem (credited
  as Him). As she supports her husband through writer’s block, a series of
  guests unexpectedly arrive at their remote house. First, a wounded man seeking
  refuge (Ed Harris), then his serpentine wife (played by a deliciously
  villainous Michelle Pfeiffer). Before long, the couple’s sons burst into the
  home, followed by a funeral party. By the film’s climax, thousands of people
  have entered the home against mother’s wishes, each claiming to be a devotee
  of her husband’s work. As the guests become zealot-like in their fervour for
  the poet, Lawrence’s character is driven to madness. What begins as a
  surrealist take on Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? devolves into a full-blown
  Boschian nightmare – and through it all, we are with Lawrence. She barely ever
  exits the frame, and Mother! hinges on her complete command of the screen.
  Lawrence moves from wallflower to pariah throughout the film’s torturous
  passage; it’s a high-wire act that, in the hands of Lawrence, turns a
  character who risks passivity into a deeply emotional, almost primal being who
  guides us through the delirium. It’s a movie star turn of the highest calibre.
  Mother! broke Lawrence’s streak of box office success, landing with a thud.
  Receiving a rare F cinema score from audiences and struggling commercially,
  the frosty reception to Mother! played nicely into the predictably
  misogynistic narrative about Lawrence’s waning star power. Despite the
  backlash and her first Razzie nomination, Lawrence’s fearless performance
  landed her some of the best critical notices of her career. The film’s
  director, Darren Aronofsky, has said that Mother! is a metaphor for the
  destruction of the environment, with Lawrence playing Mother(!) Nature. During
  filming, the pair began a highly publicised relationship, which ended shortly
  after Mother!’s release went up in flames. Lawrence later cited the tension of
  wanting to be a supportive partner while also being a creative muse as playing
  a role in their break-up; the irony that this dynamic had already played out
  on-screen in Mother! was undoubtedly not lost on either of them, Arguably,
  their willingness to mine the deeply personal is part of what makes Mother! an
  astonishing and brutal achievement. While audiences largely rejected Mother!
  in 2017, time has only revealed it to be a searing takedown of the era of
  stardom in which Lawrence made her name, as well as predicting the hostile
  social environment of the Covid era. In a viral clip, Lawrence recounted the
  double standards she experienced as a woman in Hollywood, having now moved
  into producing her own starring vehicles. She has also been a vocal advocate
  against sexual violence after her nude photographs were leaked in a highly
  publicised phone hacking scandal. In an interview discussing the crime,
  Lawrence remarked: “I would much prefer my whole house to have been invaded.”
  The full-throttle nature of Mother! is riveting in its sheer audacity. The
  film’s overwhelming nature and shock value elicit equal laughter and gasping.
  We witness Lawrence endure humiliation after humiliation and, intentionally or
  not, the film invites us to consider our own complicity in the spectacle of
  celebrity and what Lawrence has endured as a result of her stardom. “I have
  nothing left to give,” mother cries at the film’s apex. Lawrence’s fearless
  performance in Mother! is the work of an actor with nothing left to prove.
  Mother! is available to stream on Stan and Paramount+ in Australia and to rent
  in the US and UK. For more recommendations of what to stream in Australia,
