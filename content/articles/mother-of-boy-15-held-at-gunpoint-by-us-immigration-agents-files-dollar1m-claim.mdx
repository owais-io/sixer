  The mother of a 15-year-old boy who was detained at gunpoint by federal
  immigration agents is seeking $1m in damages and accusing the Trump
  administration of false imprisonment and “unconstitutional racial profiling”.
  The teenager, a US citizen with disabilities, was in a vehicle with his mother
  outside Arleta high school in Los Angeles on 11 August when masked immigration
  agents surrounded them and pulled them from the vehicle. They said the boy was
  a suspect in a crime, and handcuffed him for several minutes until they
  realized they had the wrong person, the Los Angeles Times reported. His mother
  told NBC4 that the agent told her son they had confused him with someone else,
  but to “look at the bright side: you’re gonna have an exciting story to tell
  your friends when you go back to school”. “What’s exciting about getting guns
  pointed at you?” she said. The claim, filed by the Carrillo law firm on behalf
  of the boy and his mother, alleges that Ice and Border Patrol agents had no
  reasonable suspicion or probable cause to detain the boy and caused him
  physical injury and emotional distress. He is traumatized and depressed, his
  mother said to media. The agents “racially profiled [the teen] while he was
  merely sitting his car waiting for his family member”, the claim states. It
  also alleges the agents left live bullet rounds on the scene in an act of
  “clear negligence”. The incident drew widespread outrage across Los Angeles,
  and fueled fears around the activities of immigration agents, particularly
  around city schools. Days earlier, authorities arrested an 18-year-old as he
  was walking his dog, shortly before he was set to start his senior year of
  high school. The Los Angeles Unified school district has moved to adopt new
  strategies to protect students and “ensure that schools remain safe,
  supportive spaces for all children and families – regardless of immigration
  status”. Alberto M Carvalho, the LAUSD superintendent, has said the incident
  involving the 15-year-old was “unacceptable”. Immigration enforcement around
  schools “disrupts learning and creates anxiety that can last far beyond the
  school day”, Carvalho said in a statement earlier this month. In response to
  the 15-year-old’s detainment, Luz Rivas, a congressperson, condemned the
  administration’s “continued use of violent tactics to terrorize our students
  and families”. The claim was filed against the US Department of Homeland
  Security, US Customs and Border Protection, US Customs and Border Protection
  and United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The Department of
  Homeland Security said allegations that agents targeted the high school were
  false and that agents were conducting a “targeted operation on [a] criminal
  illegal alien”. “What makes someone a target for immigration enforcement is if
  they are illegally in the US – NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity.
  America’s brave men and women are removing murderers, MS-13 gang members,
  pedophiles, rapists–truly the worst of the worst from Golden State
  communities,” the statement said. The agency accused the law firm of trying to
  use“racial animus to collect clicks, clout, and cash”.
