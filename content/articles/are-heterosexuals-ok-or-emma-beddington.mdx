  Are heterosexuals OK? The question is in the ether, with the New York Times
  interrogating the phenomenon of “heteropessimism” or even “heterofatalism” –
  women, specifically, viewing their heterosexuality as a misfortune and
  lifelong disappointment, given the flakiness and apparent commitment-phobia of
  the men they encounter. Women online have also been deploring the amount of
  “mankeeping” (shouldering the “structural burden of men’s declining social
  networks” as the research team who coined the term put it) in their lives. But
  it has being posed most entertainingly by the French Instagram account
  @le_trema, created by Maël Coutand. Posts follow a standard format: in
  faux-reportage style, Coutand says: “Today we’re asking: are heterosexuals OK?
  (Est-ce que les hétérosexuels vont bien?)” Then there’s a horribly catchy
  jingle and a clip of some egregious online machismo or manosphere discourse
  that makes Sinitta’s So Macho look sophisticated – think men thumping each
  other with tyres, or shaving their eyelashes to look more manly; one tests his
  “self-control” by trapping his fingers in mousetraps; another crawls along
  railings to avoid stepping on a rainbow-painted staircase. Women aren’t
  spared: there’s a mother and daughter proudly pregnant by the same guy
  simultaneously, and a mind-bogglingly OTT gender reveal ceremony. The
  conclusion is inevitably: “Non!” Of course, bigger picture, heterosexuals are
  fine. Many of us are in happy relationships with sane members of the opposite
  sex. But more importantly, it’s not straights who suffer significant physical
  and mental health inequalities and poorer housing outcomes, who face
  discrimination and violence for their sexual identity or whose existence is
  still criminalised in disgracefully large swathes of the world. Teasingly
  interrogating the wilder, weirder corners of heteronormativity is a fun
  corrective; speaking to the radio station France Inter, Coutand said people
  have told him the account has been a starting point to discuss the absurd
  expectations around masculinity with their teenage sons. It’s also very funny
  and doesn’t require much French, but beware that earworm of a jingle: the next
  time you skirt a bare-chested punch-up outside a ’Spoons, read about Gregg
  Wallace’s new “men only” chat room or catch five minutes of Love Island, it
  will play, unbidden, in your head. • Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnist
