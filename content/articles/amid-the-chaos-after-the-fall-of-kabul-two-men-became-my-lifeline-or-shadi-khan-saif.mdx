  Sitting cross-legged on a richly patterned Afghan rug in a Melbourne living
  room, we chatted for hours, reflecting on the fall of Kabul four years ago
  that brought us together and nurtured a bond of friendship across continents.
  We had first connected in the chaos of August 2021, when the fall of Kabul
  shattered decades of fragile progress towards democracy, freedom and peace in
  Afghanistan. Our reunion this winter in Melbourne should have been pure joy –
  a celebration of survival and friendship – but it began in the quiet rows of a
  Muslim graveyard. We were there for the funeral of our mutual friend, Barez. I
  saw the grief on their faces as we stood for the final prayers. “It is so
  sad,” Simon said softly, his voice carrying that mix of resignation and wisdom
  you only hear from people who have faced loss head on. Later that afternoon,
  driving through Melbourne’s southern suburbs, we joined other Reuters
  colleagues for lunch at an Afghan restaurant. The scent of cardamom rice,
  grilled kebabs and freshly baked naan wrapped around us like a memory. Over
  green tea, we slipped into the past – and suddenly I was back in Kabul on 15
  August 2021. At midday I was sipping pomegranate juice at a roadside cafe in
  the heart of the city, just across the street from the Presidential Palace. It
  was a hot, tense day. Rumours had swirled since dawn: Taliban fighters were
  advancing on the capital, checkpoint after checkpoint falling to them without
  a shot fired. The sound came suddenly – the sharp crackle of gunfire. It
  seemed to come from everywhere at once. Panic spread like a shockwave through
  the street. For months Afghans had lived under the shadow of the US withdrawal
  but no one imagined the end would come this quickly. Only that morning
  government officials were assuring the public that Kabul was secure. By noon
  the illusion was gone. I later learned the shots came from a bank, where
  security guards fired AK-47s into the air to control a desperate crowd of
  customers trying to withdraw their savings. But in that moment we all assumed
  the worst – that Taliban fighters were already here, storming the heart of the
  city. I left my half-finished glass on the table, paid the bill and ran for my
  car. Within hours the Taliban were in control of police stations, hoisting
  their white flags, and establishing checkpoints. Shop shutters slammed shut.
  The city held its breath. Within hours my phone buzzed with a message from
  Simon Gardner – urgent but calm: “Get to the safehouse now. We will figure out
  the next steps.” I didn’t know Simon before that day. As a British journalist
  based in London, his efforts protected not only the lives of reporters on the
  frontlines but also the very principle of a free press and, in a way,
  democracy itself. From that first message, he became my lifeline – working
  contacts, finding routes and keeping me focused when fear threatened to
  paralyse me. For days I tried to reach Kabul airport. The scenes were
  apocalyptic – tens of thousands of people crushed against its gates, the roar
  of military planes, gunshots echoing as desperate crowds surged forward. I
  returned to the safehouse more than once, my attempts ending in failure and
  near disaster. Simon never once suggested giving up. “We just had to keep
  trying,” he says now. “The situation was changing by the hour – we had to
  adapt.” Eventually I made it out. I had to leave my family behind for their
  safety. But reaching Islamabad was only the end of the first chapter. I landed
  with little more than a backpack and the clothes I was wearing. Weeks turned
  into months of uncertainty. I couldn’t return to Taliban-controlled
  Afghanistan – it was too dangerous. But the road ahead was blocked by
  paperwork, shifting immigration rules and the political realities of
  resettlement. That’s when James McKenzie entered the picture. A longstanding
  Reuters colleague from Sydney whom I barely knew, he arrived in Islamabad with
  a clear mission: to help get Afghan journalists out of limbo. James’s style
  was different from Simon’s. Where Simon was the strategist, James was the
  steady hand on the shoulder – the one who kept morale alive. He would spend
  hours with displaced families, trying out his limited Persian to make everyone
  smile, explaining complex forms and navigating the wall of bureaucracy that
  stood between us and safety. The process was gruelling but somehow, between
  Simon’s network and James’s persistence, the impossible became possible.
  Months later I stepped off a plane on to Australian soil. Now, four years
  later, hosting the two in Melbourne – where I feel at home – was heartwarming.
  At the Afghan restaurant I gave Simon and James a small gift: coins engraved
  with the name of Dorothea Mackellar, the Australian poet whose words for me
  capture the contradictions of belonging to more than one land. I love a
  sunburnt country, A land of sweeping plains, Of ragged mountain ranges, Of
  droughts and flooding rains • Shadi Khan Saif is an editor, producer and
  journalist who has worked in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Germany and Australia
