  When I look back on my 1990s childhood, it’s hard not to feel nostalgic. We
  roamed for miles without supervision, riding our bikes, building dens and
  swimming in streams. After school, we did crafts or played board games and,
  though the internet existed, my parents would boot me off to use the landline.
  Media was tangible – tapes, CDs, VHS – and often consumed as a family. I still
  recall the thrill of going to the video shop to choose a film. It’s normal to
  feel like this, especially once you have babies of your own, and the social
  media algorithms know it. In the three years since I had my son and started
  writing the Guardian’s Republic of Parenthood column, I’ve noticed a huge
  upswing of interest in “90s parenting” and, this year, the trend seems to have
  exploded. Former 90s kids are in the thick of it, trying to work out how to
  parent our own children. There’s a feeling that huge advances in technology
  have resulted in a commensurate loss. But what of? Is it possible to get it
  back? And was parenting really better back then? “Yes. Full stop,” says Justin
  Flom, a father of two and content creator based in Las Vegas, who built a
  replica Blockbuster video store for his daughters in one of the rooms of his
  house. “The whole family would pile into the car, head to the video store and
  roam the aisles while deciding what to watch,” he says of his own childhood.
  “It felt exciting, full of possibility. Scrolling online just isn’t the same.”
  There’s something about going to a physical place to choose a film together,
  as well as the anticipation and the delayed gratification when finally
  watching, that made it feel like an event. “Everyone remembers that blue and
  yellow sign, the carpet, the ritual of choosing a movie together.” Not
  everyone has the space or the budget to do what Justin has, but the reasoning
  underpinning his decision would be familiar to many. “As a parent, I’m
  constantly guarding my children against content I don’t think is good for
  their brains,” he says. “We prefer older movies and shows, partly because I
  think the pacing is healthier. They’re not as chaotic or overstimulating.” His
  girls love the Home Alone movies, Harriet the Spy and Dennis the Menace, and
  their current favourite is George of the Jungle. Like Justin, I have been
  drawn towards 1990s media for my son. Current favourites are Pooh’s Grand
  Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin and Teletubbies, which were both
  made in 1997 and are a welcome contrast to the frenetic speed of more modern
  shows. Justin’s Blockbuster room is a way of making screen time intentional,
  and that seems to be at the heart of this idea of 90s parenting. “In the 90s,
  the critique was that TV would rot your brain, but it was stationary,” he
  says. “It lived in your living room. Now, media follows us everywhere. It’s in
  our pockets, on demand, nonstop. In my house, we work hard to compartmentalise
  media. It happens at a specific time and in a specific place. That’s part of
  what made Blockbuster special: it was a destination.” With increasing fears
  about the effects of screen time, and parent-led campaigns such as Smartphone
  Free Childhood gaining popularity, it’s no surprise so many of us are looking
  back to the era just before they exploded. Some parents – and schools – are
  even giving their children landlines. A group of parents in South Portland in
  the US has done it so their kids can call each other, creating a “retro
  bubble” of resistance against screens. Scrolling through 90s parenting-themed
  reels on Instagram (I’m aware of the irony), I’m struck by a video of a group
  of adults and kids having a back garden water fight (organised via landline,
  of course), having put all their smartphones in a bowl on top of a high
  cupboard. It takes me back to a time when we weren’t stuck behind screens and
  our summers often saw all the neighbourhood kids engaged in huge water fights.
  It was when the mums joined in – coming out with a bucket or washing up bowl
  so you knew they meant business – that you’d get really excited. Jess Russell
  is a big believer in the importance of play. A former primary school teacher
  and special needs coordinator, Jess is now a stay-at-home mum to two children,
  aged one and three, and uses her Instagram account @playideasforlittles to
  campaign for more learning through play in the curriculum. “I grew up in the
  countryside, and we were outside all the time. My mum was a stay-at-home mum.
  We’d do lots of arts and crafts at home,” she says. She’s trying to replicate
  this with her own children by giving them a slower pace of life, with lots of
  time in the garden and playing board games such as Hungry Hungry Hippos, and
  only watching TV as a family. One of the reasons Jess left teaching was
  because she was disillusioned by the direction of education, away from
  play-based fun towards a more results-driven system. She feels lucky to be
  able to stay at home to look after her children – which was far more common in
  the 90s, when you didn’t always need two incomes to cover housing costs. I
  feel the same about working part-time, and wonder if 90s nostalgia is partly
  to do with modern parents having to work all hours to keep their heads above
  water, when they’d like more time with their kids and for it to be playful.
  It’s not just about screens, I realise, it’s about connection, family time
  and, actually, time more generally. “Parenting in the 90s was basically just
  ‘slow’ parenting,” says Jess. That means not ferrying kids from activity to
  activity so days are jam-packed. Boredom is important, says Melanie Murphy, a
  mother of two from Dublin, who describes herself as “your nostalgic millennial
  mum friend” on Instagram. “Long stretches of unremarkable time were a gift I
  didn’t know I’d miss, and I want that for my kids. I don’t want to schedule
  every hour of their lives. I don’t want their lives to go by while their eyes
  are fixed on a device inches from their faces.” It is when her children, aged
  two and four, are bored, says Melanie, that their imaginations really take
  over. “They’ll build forts, the floor will be lava, underneath the table will
  become a dragon’s den. We go outside in old clothes and get filthy looking for
  bugs. They’ll ‘help me’ cook the dinner and clean the house … We play music
  and have dance parties. We watch my old DVDs on a projector. We colour and
  paint for hours and read lots of books. Treasure hunts, picnics, making a
  mess, simple conversations. My husband and I have pulled back on structured
  activities, adult-led plans and screen time, and as a result our house
  constantly looks like a bomb has dropped, but the kids are happy so we don’t
  care.” No doubt some 90s kids will laugh bitterly reading that. One funny
  video about 90s childhoods describes them as following your mum around
  changing rooms and having your hair cut in the kitchen, both experiences I can
  identify with. When I ask a friend if she mothers like a 90s parent, or knows
  anyone who does, she replies: “Hmmm … as in sleep training, lots of TV and
  Crispy Pancakes?” She has a point. Every 90s parenting proponent I speak to,
  though, is well aware of the danger of rose‑tinted spectacles (round ones with
  wire frames, naturally). I ask Melanie which aspects of the 90s she might want
  to leave in the past. “The physical discipline. Being taught to ‘toughen up’
  instead of allowing emotions to pass through the body as they’re meant to,”
  she says, also citing sleep training and the ‘naughty step’. The list goes on:
  “Secondhand smoke everywhere. The neglect of mental health … Gender
  stereotyping was off the charts, so was diet culture and UPF (ultra-processed
  foods) culture.” Her mum was in WeightWatchers, and Melanie used to binge on
  Pop-Tarts, then try to “undo” the snacks with sit-ups. That can all stay in
  the past. She also points out not all families were watching films together.
  In some, there was “little to no supervision of media consumption” and the
  children would see some incredibly inappropriate and traumatic content.
  Sometimes, the laissez-faire nature of 90s parenting could stray into neglect.
  In my own case, though, I look back wistfully on how “free range” I was as a
  child. Justin’s experience was similar. “My parents didn’t always know where I
  was and that was OK,” he says. “I got hurt sometimes. Kids used to break their
  arms sometimes. And then we learned not to do the thing that broke our arm.”
  (I did indeed break my arm.) “That kind of risk-taking is important. It’s how
  kids learn judgment. These days, we bubble-wrap childhood so tightly that
  we’re taking those lessons away,” he says. There has been too much of an
  overcorrection, he thinks, and people “are longing for something a little
  looser, a little more analogue. Parenting that’s not ruled by fear.” In other
  words, we are looking to redress the balance. “We know so much more now –
  about emotions, neurodiversity, safeguarding, food – and that’s obviously a
  good thing,” says Melanie. “What I long for isn’t a time machine, but a nice
  blend: the laid-back spirit of 90s parenting with the emotional awareness and
  knowledge we have today.” I thought it was worth talking to someone who
  actually was a parent in the 90s about it, so Jess put me in touch with her
  mum, Lynn. “I had precious time with my children and I really value that,” she
  says of their long days spent outdoors, at home or with friends. She points
  out that shops used to be closed on a Sunday, and the simple joy of that being
  a day for family. “Today’s parents are craving that simplicity in family time.
  “We lived in a two-bedroom house, and I had a rubbish car … Now people feel as
  if they have to sustain this standard of living. I feel really sorry for them,
  because there’s just too much pressure.” I ask Lynn if there is anything that
  is better now, and she struggles to think of anything. “I really admire mums
  nowadays because you’re balancing so much. I just didn’t have that. It was
  really quite straightforward.” I’ll confess that when I first encountered the
  concept of 90s parenting, I thought it was a bit of a sentimental gimmick,
  driven by ageing millennials in thrall to social media algorithms. But if that
  is the case then why, writing this, do I feel so … sad? Perhaps the combined
  pressures of childcare and working, not to mention exhaustion (my son hasn’t
  been sleeping) are making me feel wobbly, but I suddenly feel close to tears
  thinking about choosing a VHS in the local Spar, even though that film was
  Scream (1996) and my mum made us turn it off. I can’t quite seem to shake this
  feeling of loss, and of wanting to return to a simpler time. Maybe I just need
  more fun in my life. Time for a water fight, I think. Who’s in? The Republic
