  My friend Christopher Roles, who has died aged 63 of glioblastoma, was head of
  the UK-based charity Age International from 2012 to 2022. It supports older
  people around the world, including through humanitarian responses to disasters
  and emergencies. He brought to that position a characteristic combination of
  calm authority, moral clarity and quiet humour that left a lasting mark on
  colleagues and friends – qualities that also led him to become a valued member
  of organisations in other settings. He served on the BBC Appeals Committee and
  was a trustee of the Disasters Emergency Committee until his retirement in
  2022, when he took up trustee roles at Winchester Cathedral, Wesley House
  Cambridge and the Pensions Trust. Chris was born in Southampton to Margaret
  (nee Pragnell), a piano teacher and organist, and her husband, Bill, a
  research chemist. He grew up immersed in the musical and spiritual life of his
  local Methodist church, and those roots profoundly shaped his life. After
  attending King Edward VI school in Southampton he studied history and
  economics at Pembroke College, Oxford, later adding an MBA from the London
  Business School. He began his career in fundraising at ActionAid, later taking
  senior roles at Christian Aid (1989), the Royal College of Music (1995), YMCA
  England (1997) and as chief executive at Y-Care International (2004). He
  brought strategic thinking and deep ethical conviction to each role. Chris
  wore his achievements lightly, bringing wisdom, kindness, empathy and a gentle
  wit to every setting. He enjoyed reading, watching cricket and football, and
  spending time with his family. In 1992 he married Penny Prestage. She survives
  him, along with their children, Ollie, Sam and Miranda, and his sister
  Elizabeth.
