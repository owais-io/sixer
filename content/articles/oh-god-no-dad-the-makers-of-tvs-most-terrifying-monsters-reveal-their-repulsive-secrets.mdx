  When special effects artist Aaron Sims first read the script for Stranger
  Things, he was struck by how vague the description was for the show’s
  centrepiece monster. “It basically said, ‘The Demogorgon is a tall, lanky
  creature that eats children,’” recalls Sims. “I’m thinking, ‘OK, that’s scary
  – but what does that actually look like?’” What happened when he posed this
  question to the series creators Matt and Ross Duffer? “They said, ‘We have no
  idea – come up with something.’” For Sims, who has worked on films such as The
  Incredible Hulk, Rise of the Planet of the Apes and X-Men, this was a relief.
  “When there’s already a fanbase, there is a lot of scrutiny and expectation.
  The fans either love it or hate it – and there’s nothing you can do. Working
  on The Incredible Hulk, for example, took years. So when it’s a new creature,
  a lot of people get excited.” This near-blank canvas led Sims to an unlikely
  source of inspiration: the snapping mouth of a turtle. “When a turtle opens
  its jaws,” he says, “it looks like it has rows of teeth – but they’re actually
  fibres that draw food inward.” He combined this with a Venus flytrap and the
  result was that uniquely terrifying head that blooms open like a flower,
  revealing concentric rings of teeth, then clamps down on its prey, usually a
  screaming child. The Duffer brothers wanted only one modification: no face.
  Fans of Stranger Things, which returns later this year, will find plenty to
  fear in Alien: Earth, which launches this week. Series creator Noah Hawley has
  promised a terrifying expansion of the film franchise’s already frightening
  monsters, introducing new creatures that will rival – and even surpass – the
  iconic, swoop-skulled, chest-bothering, teeth-within-teeth xenomorphs. “I
  think we’re giving them a run for their money, certainly,” Hawley has said.
  Alien: Earth, which is a prequel to the first 1979 film, leans heavily into
  unsettling body horror, too, with new creatures such as the T Ocellus, a
  jellyfish-like parasite that dislodges the eyes of other organisms in order to
  seize control of them from within. These newcomers will ensure the series
  isn’t just recycling established monsters, but introducing fresh causes of
  terror and revulsion. Like Sims on Stranger Things, prosthetic makeup designer
  Barrie Gower leaned heavily on nature when he was creating his monstrous
  designs for The Infected, the term given to humans who get the brain infection
  in postapocalyptic zombie horror The Last of Us. Fungus became an integral
  part of the creative process, with Gower and his team buying so many bags of
  “grow your own mushroom kits” for the studio to photograph and 3D print that
  they soon had 15 species on their hands. “Fungus,” says Gower, “is just such
  an interesting and beautiful kind of growth. There’s so much to play with.”
  Gower effectively had a “superpower” for creating monsters out of mushrooms:
  he hates them, despising everything from their smell to their texture. “It
  became quite easy to come up with designs that repulsed me,” he says. Along
  with his mushroom aversion, Gower also has trypophobia, an intense discomfort
  triggered by the sight of clusters of small holes or bumps. “It gives you
  goosebumps,” he says. However, rather than avoiding the formations that make
  his skin crawl, he employed them for maximum grotesqueness in his designs for
  how The Infected look, finding the perfect guinea pig in his daughter Lottie,
  who shares his trypophobia. “If she’s like, ‘Oh God no dad, I don’t like the
  look’, I know we’ve succeeded.” The White Walkers, those furrow-faced ice
  demons in Game of Thrones, required an entirely different approach. Costume
  designer Michele Clapton envisioned them wearing dark armour that looked
  salvaged and repurposed, resulting in an austere, unwieldy look. “It was so,
  so brutal to make,” Clapton says. “The cutting and the bending of the metal
  was incredibly labour intensive. The armorists just loathed it because they
  really cut themselves. It’s almost like a huge cheese grater.” The final
  pieces of armour proved so hazardous that the team actually had to create much
  safer leather duplicates for fight sequences, meticulously painted to mimic
  metal. Protecting all the prosthetics also proved difficult, given the sharp
  edges. Another major challenge, ironically, was keeping the White Walkers warm
  while filming in near freezing temperatures. “We had hot-water bottles we
  could place inside the costumes,” says Clapton. “But as there were so many
  prosthetics, you had to be really careful, because they could easily tear.” In
  fact, keeping performers comfortable in elaborate costumes and prosthetics is
  a major headache for monster creators. Gower encountered this with the Bloater
  – the hulking, spore-spewing, elaborately ridged behemoth in The Last of Us.
  “We built this big suit that, in terms of size, was like wearing a sofa,” he
  says. “It was made out of a very soft foam latex material. It’s like a huge
  sponge, but split into six sections and zipped on to the performer.” There was
  one very predictable consequence: “You just got really hot.” The inside of the
  costume could become so sweltering that, between shots, the team had to unzip
  the back and fan down Adam Basil, who portrayed the Bloater, sometimes even
  putting him in a pop-up tent complete with an air-conditioning unit on full
  blast to cool him down. According to Gower, the huge weight, restricted
  movement and the need for agility combined to make the Bloater costume
  ultimately unworkable. The team ended up enlisting the help of Wētā FX in New
  Zealand, who took detailed scans of all the Bloater’s textures and created a
  digital version. Such mega-budget productions give creators the luxury of
  experimentation, with digital backup plans should their monster imaginings go
  awry. But on shows such as Doctor Who, it’s a different story – as special
  effects artist Neill Gorton discovered. On the BBC’s cult show, he encountered
  something every bit as scary as the Time Lord’s weekly foes: a very limited
  budget. “It was a comedown in one way,” he says, “coming from working in
  Hollywood. I had a production design friend who introduced me to Doctor Who.
  When I asked what it was like, he said, ‘It’s fun – but they just don’t have
  money.’ I thought, ‘Well, what the hell, I just want to work on it.’ And
  sometimes it can actually be more fun, because you’ve got to be more
  creative.” Take the Weeping Angels, those statue-like alien humanoids that are
  able to send their victims back in time with a simple touch, gorging on the
  “time energy” this releases. Producers had initially envisioned using numerous
  statues, believing that costumed performers painted as statues would resemble
  street performers too closely. But there was a problem. “The sheer number of
  statues required would have been impossible given the timeframe,” says Gorton.
  “You would need a different statue for every pose. That would have been a
  minimum of 30 statues.” Forced to find an alternative, he suggested a design
  that was part prosthetic, part costume, part body paint. “The producers
  thought it was ridiculous. But we literally had no choice!” he says. Gorton
  would paint the actors, attach fabric, then “glue it all together and hope for
  the best”. At that point, he realised how little time he and the team had left
  to bring the idea to life – just two weeks, compared to the five they would
  normally have to prepare for an episode. Sadly, this realisation came too
  late: Gorton had already talked everyone into his idea. The result? “A total
  scramble!” They discovered that the masks used to create the Weeping Angels’
  haunting blank stare left the performers unable to see. Fortunately, this
  wasn’t a huge issue, since the creatures had to remain perfectly still – a
  feat the team achieved by having the actors sit on a bicycle seat attached to
  a hidden pole. “On a bigger budget,” says Gorton, “you would never go down
  that road. But given no choice, we just had to be smart and quick about it.”
  Of course, it isn’t just the pressure of budgets and time that lead to
  human-being-based effects. The Duffer brothers were adamant from the start:
  the Demogorgon would be portrayed by a performer in a suit. This presented
  probably the biggest conundrum when it came to designing the creature. “Its
  legs are unusually long,” says Sims. “It has kind of an extra joint. That
  makes it very challenging for an actor – to be put into stilts and have to run
  around and jump. The question was, ‘How do I keep the design the Duffer
  brothers love – but make it work for a person in a suit?’” Whatever the
  challenges and the solutions, Sims finds there is always one benefit of
  working with flesh-and-blood performers: they ground any design in reality.
  “It’s important to find things in nature the human eye can identify with,” he
  says. “If you take a human thing that’s scary, then you add all those things
  to it, that makes it even more scary.” Asked how he makes monsters such as The
  Infected so deeply disturbing, Gower makes a similar point: taking everyday
  things like mushrooms and making them seriously creepy is a guaranteed win.
  “Using realistic source material is the key,” he says. “Keeping things
  familiar is always going to make them more terrifying. It just gives you
  goosebumps.” • Alien: Earth is on Disney+ from 13 August
