  … and on that note, it’s a wrap! Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy
  warned the Russian army was not preparing to end the war, but “making
  movements that indicate preparations for new ofensive operations,” as he
  thanked EU leaders for their support (10:55, 13:48, 16:14). His comments came
  after the EU leaders, without Hungary’s Viktor Orbán (10:12), adopted a
  strongly worded statement of support for Ukraine (9:52), just days before US
  president meets Russian president Vladimir Putin for talks on ending the war
  (12:51). Some European leaders are due to speak with Zelenskyy and Trump on
  Wednesday coordinating their positions ahead of the summit (11:31), amid some
  concerns that Europe’s painstaking diplomatic progress with Trump, including a
  successful Nato summit in June, now looks to be at risk (16:16). Elsewhere,
  Over 20 European countries and the EU have called for “urgent action … to halt
  and reserve starvation” in Gaza, warning that “the humanitarian suffering in
  Gaza has reached unimaginable levels” (15:20). The EU separately said that
  Israel’s progress on food, medical deliveries to the territory was “very
  insufficient” (12:55). Almost 6,000 people have been evacuated from their
  homes in northern, central and southern Spain as wildfires continue to burn
  amid a heatwave that could bring temperatures of 44C to some parts of the
  country, and continue to affect large parts of Europe (14:52). And that’s all
  from me, Jakub Krupa, for today. If you have any tips, comments or
  suggestions, email me at jakub.krupa@theguardian.com. I am also on Bluesky at

  leaders are clinging to the hope that Trump’s recent impatience with Putin for
  failing to agree a 30-day ceasefire will not dissolve on contact with the
  Russian leader. Recent signs suggested Trump was slowly hardening his stance
  towards Russia, including resuming intelligence cooperation with Ukraine, a
  willingness to supply arms for Ukraine if bought by the EU and the threat of
  secondary sanctions against countries that traded in Russian oil. But Europe’s
  painstaking diplomatic progress with Trump, including a successful Nato summit
  in June, now looks to be at risk. In the last few minutes, the Ukrainian
  military has posted about on-going clashes with Russian troops near Pokrovsk
  in Ukraine. In a brief report, it said the Russians had “a numerical
  advantage,” but “suffered significant losses,” still “trying to infiltrate the
  first line of defence in smaller groups.” Expect to hear more about similar
  stories in the days leading to the Trump-Putin meeting on Friday, in line with
  Zelenskyy’s earlier warning about offensive operations (10:55). Polish prime
  minister Donald Tusk said on Tuesday that Russia was seeking to drive a wedge
  between Warsaw and Kyiv ahead of peace talks, after an outcry over a spectator
  waving a Ukrainian nationalist flag at a concert in Poland’s national stadium,
  Reuters reported. Warsaw police said they had detained 109 people during the
  concert by Belarusian rapper Max Korzh for offences ranging from drug
  possession to assaulting security personnel. Tusk said that proceedings were
  under way to deport 63 people following the disturbances at the concert – 57
  Ukrainians and six Belarusians. Many Poles were angered by footage shared on
  social media which showed an audience member at a concert in the National
  Stadium in Warsaw on Saturday waving the red and black flag of the Ukrainian
  Insurgent Army (UPA), a nationalist group Poland says was involved in the
  1943-1945 Volhynia massacres of Poles. The Ukrainian man who was filmed waving
  the UPA flag apologised for his actions in a video shared on social media,
  saying that he had only meant to show support for his country. 27
  international partners, including 21 European countries and three EU
  commissioners, have signed a joint statement calling for “urgent action … to
  halt and reserve starvation” in Gaza, warning that “the humanitarian suffering
  in Gaza has reached unimaginable levels” and urging Israel to immediately
  authorise aid shipments to the territory. The statement, signed by the foreign
  ministers of Britain, France, the Netherlands and Spain, among others, and
  three EU commissioners, said: Humanitarian space must be protected, and aid
  should never be politicised. However, due to restrictive new registration
  requirements, essential international NGOs may be forced to leave the OPTs
  imminently which would worsen the humanitarian situation still further. We
  call on the government of Israel to provide authorisation for all
  international NGO aid shipments and to unblock essential humanitarian actors
  from operating. Immediate, permanent and concrete steps must be taken to
  facilitate safe, large-scale access for the UN, international NGOs and
  humanitarian partners. All crossings and routes must be used to allow a flood
  of aid into Gaza, including food, nutrition supplies, shelter, fuel, clean
  water, medicine and medical equipment. Lethal force must not be used at
  distribution sites, and civilians, humanitarians and medical workers must be
  protected. We are grateful to the US, Qatar and Egypt for their efforts in
  pushing for a ceasefire and pursuing peace. We need a ceasefire that can end
  the war, for hostages to be released and aid to enter Gaza by land unhindered.
  The statement has been signed by the foreign ministers of Australia, Belgium,
  Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland,
  Japan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal,
  Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK, as well as the EU’s
  foreign policy chief, and EU commissioners for the Mediterranean and for
  crisis management. in Madrid Spain’s central government has ordered officials
  in a Spanish town to scrap a ban on religious gatherings in public sports
  centres, describing it as a “discriminatory” measure that breaches the right
  to religious freedom as it will mainly impact Muslims. “There can be no
  half-measures when it comes to intolerance,” Ángel Víctor Torres, the minister
  for territorial policy, wrote on social media on Monday. Rightwing opposition
  parties, he added, “cannot decide who has freedom of worship and who does
  not”. Last week, it emerged that the conservative-led council in Jumilla, a
  town of about 27,000 residents in the region of Murcia, had backed the ban. As
  its Muslim residents had for years used the facilities to come together to
  mark Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, the motion was widely seen as targeting the
  town’s estimated 1,500 Muslims. The proposal was initially put forward by the
  far-right Vox party, which called for an outright ban on public celebrations
  such as Eid al-Adha. Vox’s hardline motion was watered down and subsequently
  backed by the People’s party (PP), which removed the explicit reference to Eid
  al-Adha and instead stipulated that municipal sports facilities could no
  longer be used for “cultural, social or religious activities foreign to the
  city council”. Vox had demanded the measure in exchange for backing the budget
  put forward by the town’s PP mayor. As the far right celebrated what it
  described as the “first measure” to ban Islamic festivals in Spain’s public
  spaces, the outcry was swift. The head of a prominent Muslim association in
  Spain described the ban as “institutionalised Islamophobia”, while the
  country’s migration minister called it “shameful”. in Madrid Almost 6,000
  people have been evacuated from their homes in northern, central and southern
  Spain as wildfires continue to burn amid a heatwave that could bring
  temperatures of 44C to some parts of the country. The deadly heat across large
  parts of Europe has created what scientists have called a “molotov cocktail”
  of climatic conditions that is fuelling vast wildfires. A man caught in a
  blaze on Monday night in Tres Cantos, near Madrid, died in hospital after
  suffering 98% burns. The fire – described by the regional environment minister
  as having “explosive characteristics because of a dry storm that has brought
  winds of more than 70km/h” – was being brought under control on Tuesday
  morning, with 180 people forced to evacuate and spend the night in local
  sports centres. In the north-western region of Castilla y León, more than
  3,700 people were evacuated from 16 municipalities. Ten fires were still
  burning on Tuesday and the Unesco world heritage-listed Roman-era mining site
  at Les Médulas was damaged by the flames. In the southern town of Tarifa,
  firefighters and planes were still battling a fire that broke out on Monday,
  with 2,000 people evacuated. The blazes have led the interior ministry to
  declare a “pre-emergency phase” to help coordinate emergency resources. The
  prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, offered his condolences to the family of the
  man who died after the Tres Cantos fire, and thanked the emergency services
  for their “tireless efforts”. He urged people to recognise the seriousness of
  the situation. “We’re at extreme risk of forest fires,” he said in a message
  on X on Tuesday. “Let’s be very careful.” In neighbouring Portugal,
  firefighters were battling three large wildfires in the centre and north of
  the country. Morocco is sending two aircraft to help fight the fires after two
  Portuguese planes broke down. In Italy, where temperatures of 40C are expected
  in Florence later this week, a four-year-old boy died of heatstroke, and a red
  alert warning was issued for seven major cities, including Bologna and
  Florence. The boy had been found unconscious in the family’s car in Sardinia
  and was airlifted to a Rome hospital but died on Monday of irreversible brain
  damage. Dozens of people were evacuated from their homes in the Balkans as
  firefighters battled blazes in Albania, Montenegro and Croatia, where red
  alerts were announced. The UK is quickly recovering a prime position in the
  EU’s £80bn science research programme 18 months after becoming a participating
  member following the resolution of Brexit problems, data shows. The country
  was frozen out of Horizon Europe for three years in a tit-for-tat row with the
  then prime minister, Boris Johnson, over the Northern Ireland trading
  arrangements. While the UK has to play catch-up, entering three years into the
  seven-year 2020-27 funding programme, data shows British scientists are
  punching above their weight with €735m (£635m) in grants in 2024. That ranks
  the UK as the fifth most successful country in the programme, which is open to
  43 nations: the 27 EU member states and 16 non-EU associate members also
  including New Zealand, Canada and Norway. Germany, the top participant in
  Horizon in 2024, won €1.4bn (£1.21bn) in grants and Spain, which came third,
  got €900m (£777m). Scientists have said previously they were “over the moon”
  to be back working with EU colleagues. They said they knew it would take time
  to return to the top three because of the time it took to build multinational
  consortiums to apply for funds. But in terms of grants for proposals by
  individual scientists, which are easier to assemble, the UK now ranks as the
  second-most successful participating country after Germany, with €242m (£209m)
  in funds. The UK is the single most successful applicant country when it comes
  to Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, one of the most prestigious grant
  programmes for doctoral and post-doctoral research in the world. UK scientists
  have said repeatedly the Brexit lockout damaged Britain’s reputation on the
  world stage and made it difficult for universities to recruit researchers from
  the EU. Let’s take a quick look at other updates from across Europe. Just days
  before the Trump-Putin summit, Ukraine’s authoritative DeepState war map
  showed that Russian forces had advanced by at least 10 km (six miles) north in
  two prongs in recent days, part of their drive to take full control of
  Ukraine’s Donetsk region, Reuters reported. The advance is one of the most
  dramatic in the last year, it stated. DeepState said the Russians had surged
  forward near three villages on a section of the frontline associated with the
  Ukrainian towns of Kostyantynivka and Pokrovsk, which Moscow is trying to
  encircle, exploiting Kyiv’s lack of manpower. The news agency speculated that
  the move could be designed to increase the pressure on Kyiv to cede land as
  the US and Russian presidents prepare to meet. Offering an update of sorts on
  the EU-US trade discussions, the EU’s trade spokesperson Olof Gill said:
  “We’re waiting for the US to follow through on the on the commitments they’ve
  made, the clear political commitments they’ve made, and, and that’s where we
  are right now as soon as we have any updates, we’d be happy to provide them.”
  The EU has said the progress made by Israel in delivering food and medical
  supplies to Gaza is “still very insufficient”. The European Commissioner Hadja
  Lahbib briefed foreign ministers from the bloc at an emergency meeting
  yesterday about the latest supplies. A spokesperson for the commission said:
  “It is necessary to say that there is a progress, but it is far from an ideal
  scenario and it is still very insufficient. “Israel is imposing some
  administrative issues, restrictions to the NGOs and our partners,” she said
  adding that airdrops were not a solution. “In Gaza what we need is a full
  access to be able to deliver in much larger scale.” The Commission declined to
  comment on the latest member state response to its proposal to take sanctions
  against Israel including a partial suspension of Israel from the Horizon
  Europe scientific programme. Israel said it has increased humanitarian aid
  deliveries in the last 24 hours. “On August 11, 300 trucks carrying
  humanitarian goods entered Gaza through the Kerem Shalom and Zikim crossings,
  and over 270 trucks were collected and distributed by the UN and international
  organizations. “Additionally, tankers of UN fuel entered for the operation of
  essential humanitarian systems,” a spokesperson for COGAT said. At its midday
  briefing, the European Commission insisted the European position was “clear”
  ahead of this week’s diplomacy blitz on Ukraine. “We welcome the efforts of
  the President Trump to reach peace for Ukraine, a peace that is just and
  lasting and respects sovereignty and integrity [of Ukraine],” the commission’s
  deputy chief spokesperson Arianna Podestà said. She added that the bloc was
  “working with Ukraine to make sure that this is kept in mind in the meeting of
  Friday,” welcoming plans to coordinate with the US during tomorrow’s phone
  call arranged by the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz. Foreign policy
  spokesperson Anitta Hipper also commented on Hungary’s decision to not sign
  the EU statement on Ukraine, saying: “It’s nothing new. Also, it’s nothing new
  that we need unity to be strong, and if we don’t have this unity, there’s only
  one party that will profit from this, and this is Russia.” With the summit
  between the two presidents set for Alaska on Friday, the Guardian’s central
  and eastern European correspondent Shaun Walker reports on what we know so
  far. What might a ceasefire deal negotiated between Russia and the US look
  like, how might it ever be enforced, and what do Ukrainians think about this
  meeting? The former British ambassador to Russia Laurie Bristow tells Lucy
  Hough what it is like to negotiate with Putin and whether he believes a
  lasting peace in Ukraine is possible. in Berlin Germany’s foreign minister,
  Johann Wadephul, is pushing back against the notion the Europeans are mere
  bystanders when it comes to the future of Ukraine. After meeting his EU
  counterparts, Wadephul told German public broadcaster ZDF late Monday the
  Europeans were “standing closely together” and would as a result “be heard” in
  Washington and Moscow. He pointed to a series of online meetings on Wednesday
  convened by the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, to which the leaders of
  France, Britain, Italy, Poland, Finland, the Nato secretary general and top EU
  officials had been invited along with Trump and Zelenskyy. “It’s important
  that Trump listens to the European voice, and it is good that Germany is
  making it heard,” Wadephul said. “The Europeans carry a lot of weight simply
  because they have a common position.” He said the Europeans still held the
  clear view that any negotiations on Ukraine’s future could only come after a
  ceasefire had been agreed and observed, and said Friday’s summit could only be
  “a beginning” to talk about the terms under which peace talks could begin.
  “The mere fact Ukraine is now willing to discuss the status quo is already a
  concession because Russia is occupying Ukrainian territory in violation of
  international law,” Wadephul said. The weapons have got to fall silent to
  allow talks. He insisted only Kyiv could make decisions about Ukraine’s fate.
  “We Europeans can’t allow anyone else to decide on it,” he said. “We’re not
  going to do it and neither can the United States of America.” He admitted that
  a future peace deal could “possibly include concessions” on the part of
  Ukraine but this was a “question to be decided later”. This week’s talks are
  about creating “fair conditions for these negotiations”. Wadephul said in the
  end the future of Ukraine was about “European security” which is why European
  leaders would not stand by “while decisions are taken over the Europeans’
  heads”. “Europeans will continue to stand by Ukraine, as we have done
  throughout the war,” he said, with Germany remaining “at the forefront of this
  support”. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned the Russian army was
  not preparing to end the war, but “making movements that indicate preparations
  for new ofensive operations,” as he thanked EU leaders for their support. In a
  social media post, Zelenskyy said it was criticial that the unity of views “is
  not threatened,” as he urged partners to put more pressure on Russia. “Issues
  related to the security of Ukraine and Europe are discussed by all of us
  together. Any decision must add to our joint security capabilities. And if
  Russia refuses to stop the killings, it must be held accountable,” he said.
  Giving his backing to Donald Trump’s plans for a summit with Vladimir Putin,
  he said: “Indeed, we all support President Trump’s determination, and together
  we must shape positions that will not allow Russia to deceive the world once
  again. “ He added: “As long as they continue the war and occupation, all of us
  together must maintain our pressure – the pressure of strength, the pressure
  of sanctions, the pressure of diplomacy. I thank everyone who is helping.
  Peace through strength.” Meanwhile, the Russian and Belarusian armies are set
  to hold joint strategic exercises in Belarus from 12-16 September, the
  Belarusian Defence Ministry said, reported by Reuters. The aim of the drills
  is to test the capabilities of Russia and Belarus and “ensure the military
  security of the Union State and their readiness to repel possible aggression,”
  the ministry cited Maj Gen Valery Revenko as saying. Ukrainian president
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned earlier this year, without giving details or citing
  evidence, that Russia was “preparing something” in Belarus this summer under
  the guise of routine military exercises. In an interview with Time Magazine
  last week, Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko said he had decided to
  move the location of the joint military drills away from Belarus’ western
  borders with European Union countries, citing security concerns raised in
  Poland and the Baltic nations. To give you an idea of just how strongly
  Hungary feels about the EU’s statement, the country’s prime minister Viktor
  Orbán took to social media this morning to explain his views. He said he felt
  it was necessary to speak before “the liberal-mainstream chorus” – that’s the
  EU leaders for him – “begins its newest rendition of their favourite ‘Putin’s
  puppet’ tune” accusing him of taking pro-Russian positions. But in short: he
  said that since the EU was not involved, it shouldn’t intervene from the
  sidelines, and if it wants to talk to Putin, it should call its own EU-Russia
  summit. Here is his explanation in full: “Just four days ahead of the historic
  summit between President Trump and President Putin, the European Council
  sought to issue a statement in the name of all EU heads of state and
  government. Before the liberal-mainstream chorus begins its newest rendition
  of their favourite “Putin’s puppet” tune, I decided to share why I could NOT
  support the statement on behalf of Hungary. 1. The statement attempts to set
  conditions for a meeting to which leaders of the EU were not invited. 2. The
  fact that the EU was left on the sidelines is sad enough as it is. The only
  thing that could make things worse is if we started providing instructions
  from the bench. 3. The only sensible action for EU leaders is to initiate an
  EU-Russia summit, based on the example of the US-Russia meeting. Let’s give
  peace a chance!” In an early morning statement issued after last night
  ministerial discussions, the EU insisted “the path to peace in Ukraine cannot
  be decided without Ukraine,” as it stressed “the inherent right of Ukraine to
  choose its own destiny.” “Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine has wider
  implications for European and international security. We share the conviction
  that a diplomatic solution must protect Ukraine’s and Europe’s vital security
  interests.” But despite the intentions, the statement didn’t demonstrate the
  EU’s unity on this point: Viktor Orbán’s Hungary, once again, refused to back
  the collective position. And just hours after the EU meeting, Hungarian
  foreign minister Péter Szijjártó was on the phone to Moscow speaking to
  Russian deputy prime minister Denis Manturov. But as we get closer to the
  summit – which Donald Trump described last night as a “feel-out meeting” –
  many European leaders are likely to be alarmed by the US president’s rhethoric
  and talk of “swapping” territories without Ukraine even present at the table.
  They will be hoping that the last-ditch attempt to convince Trump of the
  merits of their position during a scheduled phone call on Wednesday will
  result in the US president changing his views going into the talks. Let’s see.
  Elsewhere, we will be keeping an eye on another day of record-breaking heat in
  parts of Europe. Overnight, Spanish firefighters have finally contained a
  wildfire near Madrid, which killed one and prompted the evacuation of almost
  200 people. I will bring you all the key updates here. It’s Tuesday, 12 August
  2025, it’s Jakub Krupa here, and this is Europe Live. Good morning.

The country was frozen out of Horizon Europe for three years in a tit-for-tat row with the then prime minister, Boris Johnson, over the Northern Ireland trading arrangements. While the UK has to play catch-up, entering three years into the seven-year 2020-27 funding programme, data shows British scientists are punching above their weight with €735m (£635m) in grants in 2024. That ranks the UK as the fifth most successful country in the programme, which is open to 43 nations: the 27 EU member states and 16 non-EU associate members also including New Zealand, Canada and Norway. Germany, the top participant in Horizon in 2024, won €1.4bn (£1.21bn) in grants and Spain, which came third, got €900m (£777m). Scientists have said previously they were “over the moon” to be back working with EU colleagues. They said they knew it would take time to return to the top three because of the time it took to build multinational consortiums to apply for funds. But in terms of grants for proposals by individual scientists, which are easier to assemble, the UK now ranks as the second-most successful participating country after Germany, with €242m (£209m) in funds. The UK is the single most successful applicant country when it comes to Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, one of the most prestigious grant programmes for doctoral and post-doctoral research in the world. UK scientists have said repeatedly the Brexit lockout damaged Britain’s reputation on the world stage and made it difficult for universities to recruit researchers from the EU. Let’s take a quick look at other updates from across Europe. Just days before the Trump-Putin summit, Ukraine’s authoritative DeepState war map showed that Russian forces had advanced by at least 10 km (six miles) north in two prongs in recent days, part of their drive to take full control of Ukraine’s Donetsk region, Reuters reported. The advance is one of the most dramatic in the last year, it stated. DeepState said the Russians had surged forward near three villages on a section of the frontline associated with the Ukrainian towns of Kostyantynivka and Pokrovsk, which Moscow is trying to encircle, exploiting Kyiv’s lack of manpower. The news agency speculated that the move could be designed to increase the pressure on Kyiv to cede land as the US and Russian presidents prepare to meet. Offering an update of sorts on the EU-US trade discussions, the EU’s trade spokesperson Olof Gill said: “We’re waiting for the US to follow through on the on the commitments they’ve made, the clear political commitments they’ve made, and, and that’s where we are right now as soon as we have any updates, we’d be happy to provide them.” The EU has said the progress made by Israel in delivering food and medical supplies to Gaza is “still very insufficient”. The European Commissioner Hadja Lahbib briefed foreign ministers from the bloc at an emergency meeting yesterday about the latest supplies. A spokesperson for the commission said: “It is necessary to say that there is a progress, but it is far from an ideal scenario and it is still very insufficient. “Israel is imposing some administrative issues, restrictions to the NGOs and our partners,” she said adding that airdrops were not a solution. “In Gaza what we need is a full access to be able to deliver in much larger scale.” The Commission declined to comment on the latest member state response to its proposal to take sanctions against Israel including a partial suspension of Israel from the Horizon Europe scientific programme. Israel said it has increased humanitarian aid deliveries in the last 24 hours. “On August 11, 300 trucks carrying humanitarian goods entered Gaza through the Kerem Shalom and Zikim crossings, and over 270 trucks were collected and distributed by the UN and international organizations. “Additionally, tankers of UN fuel entered for the operation of essential humanitarian systems,” a spokesperson for COGAT said. At its midday briefing, the European Commission insisted the European position was “clear” ahead of this week’s diplomacy blitz on Ukraine. “We welcome the efforts of the President Trump to reach peace for Ukraine, a peace that is just and lasting and respects sovereignty and integrity [of Ukraine],” the commission’s deputy chief spokesperson Arianna Podestà said. She added that the bloc was “working with Ukraine to make sure that this is kept in mind in the meeting of Friday,” welcoming plans to coordinate with the US during tomorrow’s phone call arranged by the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz. Foreign policy spokesperson Anitta Hipper also commented on Hungary’s decision to not sign the EU statement on Ukraine, saying: “It’s nothing new. Also, it’s nothing new that we need unity to be strong, and if we don’t have this unity, there’s only one party that will profit from this, and this is Russia.” With the summit between the two presidents set for Alaska on Friday, the Guardian’s central and eastern European correspondent Shaun Walker reports on what we know so far. What might a ceasefire deal negotiated between Russia and the US look like, how might it ever be enforced, and what do Ukrainians think about this meeting? The former British ambassador to Russia Laurie Bristow tells Lucy Hough what it is like to negotiate with Putin and whether he believes a lasting peace in Ukraine is possible. in Berlin Germany’s foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, is pushing back against the notion the Europeans are mere bystanders when it comes to the future of Ukraine. After meeting his EU counterparts, Wadephul told German public broadcaster ZDF late Monday the Europeans were “standing closely together” and would as a result “be heard” in Washington and Moscow. He pointed to a series of online meetings on Wednesday convened by the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, to which the leaders of France, Britain, Italy, Poland, Finland, the Nato secretary general and top EU officials had been invited along with Trump and Zelenskyy. “It’s important that Trump listens to the European voice, and it is good that Germany is making it heard,” Wadephul said. “The Europeans carry a lot of weight simply because they have a common position.” He said the Europeans still held the clear view that any negotiations on Ukraine’s future could only come after a ceasefire had been agreed and observed, and said Friday’s summit could only be “a beginning” to talk about the terms under which peace talks could begin. “The mere fact Ukraine is now willing to discuss the status quo is already a concession because Russia is occupying Ukrainian territory in violation of international law,” Wadephul said. The weapons have got to fall silent to allow talks. He insisted only Kyiv could make decisions about Ukraine’s fate. “We Europeans can’t allow anyone else to decide on it,” he said. “We’re not going to do it and neither can the United States of America.” He admitted that a future peace deal could “possibly include concessions” on the part of Ukraine but this was a “question to be decided later”. This week’s talks are about creating “fair conditions for these negotiations”. Wadephul said in the end the future of Ukraine was about “European security” which is why European leaders would not stand by “while decisions are taken over the Europeans’ heads”. “Europeans will continue to stand by Ukraine, as we have done throughout the war,” he said, with Germany remaining “at the forefront of this support”. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned the Russian army was not preparing to end the war, but “making movements that indicate preparations for new ofensive operations,” as he thanked EU leaders for their support. In a social media post, Zelenskyy said it was criticial that the unity of views “is not threatened,” as he urged partners to put more pressure on Russia. “Issues related to the security of Ukraine and Europe are discussed by all of us together. Any decision must add to our joint security capabilities. And if Russia refuses to stop the killings, it must be held accountable,” he said. Giving his backing to Donald Trump’s plans for a summit with Vladimir Putin, he said: “Indeed, we all support President Trump’s determination, and together we must shape positions that will not allow Russia to deceive the world once again. “ He added: “As long as they continue the war and occupation, all of us together must maintain our pressure – the pressure of strength, the pressure of sanctions, the pressure of diplomacy. I thank everyone who is helping. Peace through strength.” Meanwhile, the Russian and Belarusian armies are set to hold joint strategic exercises in Belarus from 12-16 September, the Belarusian Defence Ministry said, reported by Reuters. The aim of the drills is to test the capabilities of Russia and Belarus and “ensure the military security of the Union State and their readiness to repel possible aggression,” the ministry cited Maj Gen Valery Revenko as saying. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned earlier this year, without giving details or citing evidence, that Russia was “preparing something” in Belarus this summer under the guise of routine military exercises. In an interview with Time Magazine last week, Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko said he had decided to move the location of the joint military drills away from Belarus’ western borders with European Union countries, citing security concerns raised in Poland and the Baltic nations. To give you an idea of just how strongly Hungary feels about the EU’s statement, the country’s prime minister Viktor Orbán took to social media this morning to explain his views. He said he felt it was necessary to speak before “the liberal-mainstream chorus” – that’s the EU leaders for him – “begins its newest rendition of their favourite ‘Putin’s puppet’ tune” accusing him of taking pro-Russian positions. But in short: he said that since the EU was not involved, it shouldn’t intervene from the sidelines, and if it wants to talk to Putin, it should call its own EU-Russia summit. Here is his explanation in full: “Just four days ahead of the historic summit between President Trump and President Putin, the European Council sought to issue a statement in the name of all EU heads of state and government. Before the liberal-mainstream chorus begins its newest rendition of their favourite “Putin’s puppet” tune, I decided to share why I could NOT support the statement on behalf of Hungary. 1. The statement attempts to set conditions for a meeting to which leaders of the EU were not invited. 2. The fact that the EU was left on the sidelines is sad enough as it is. The only thing that could make things worse is if we started providing instructions from the bench. 3. The only sensible action for EU leaders is to initiate an EU-Russia summit, based on the example of the US-Russia meeting. Let’s give peace a chance!” In an early morning statement issued after last night ministerial discussions, the EU insisted “the path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine,” as it stressed “the inherent right of Ukraine to choose its own destiny.” “Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine has wider implications for European and international security. We share the conviction that a diplomatic solution must protect Ukraine’s and Europe’s vital security interests.” But despite the intentions, the statement didn’t demonstrate the EU’s unity on this point: Viktor Orbán’s Hungary, once again, refused to back the collective position. And just hours after the EU meeting, Hungarian foreign minister Péter Szijjártó was on the phone to Moscow speaking to Russian deputy prime minister Denis Manturov. But as we get closer to the summit – which Donald Trump described last night as a “feel-out meeting” – many European leaders are likely to be alarmed by the US president’s rhethoric and talk of “swapping” territories without Ukraine even present at the table. They will be hoping that the last-ditch attempt to convince Trump of the merits of their position during a scheduled phone call on Wednesday will result in the US president changing his views going into the talks. Let’s see. Elsewhere, we will be keeping an eye on another day of record-breaking heat in parts of Europe. Overnight, Spanish firefighters have finally contained a wildfire near Madrid, which killed one and prompted the evacuation of almost 200 people. I will bring you all the key updates here. It’s Tuesday, 12 August 2025, it’s Jakub Krupa here, and this is Europe Live. Good morning.
