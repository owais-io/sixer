  Wildly incoherent, utterly flummoxing, blissful: how And Just Like That
  rewrote the rules of TV

  Sex and the City’s divisive spin-off And Just Like That is set to end after
  three bizarre seasons and a deluge of critical contempt, with bemused fans
  losing it on Reddit, and articles about how the programme became a hate watch.
  There has been little heartache in the discourse after the announcement of the
  show’s demise, the general consensus being: good. But to these people, I say –
  you’re wrong! But also, I understand. There is always an element of fear in
  contemplating change, in engaging with the rapid advancement of modernity, and
  I would like to make the case for And Just Like That being a product of
  exactly that. It feels analogous to a comment a friend of mine once made
  during a conversation about the best oven pizzas, when someone posited Dr
  Oetker pizzas as a contender: “It’s delicious, it’s something different, I
  don’t know what it is … but it’s not pizza.” This is how I feel about And Just
  Like That. It’s a pleasure to watch, it’s fun, it’s compelling, I don’t know
  what it is – but it’s certainly not TV drama. And Just Like That is something
  new; I genuinely believe the show has reimagined what television drama is, and
  how we might engage with it. I wonder whether And Just Like That represents
  the end point of television drama’s evolution into content – pure content, no
  longer a strictly narrative format. Many have wondered whether it was covertly
  written by AI, and I understand this line of thinking, as none of the
  characters behave like their original characters. In fact, they don’t behave
  like human beings. The dialogue is bizarre (repeated references to comedian
  Che’s “comedy concert”), while the editing is flummoxing, unnatural and
  awkward; scenes are abandoned at peculiar moments, new storylines introduced
  four-fifths of the way into an episode, before quickly fizzling out. The
  camera moves in jarring sweeps. The minor characters have their own minor
  characters, and everyone gets a (ridiculous) storyline, with one episode even
  featuring a monologue by the assistant of the dad of one character, Lisa Todd
  Wexley. Recently, many pointed out that the show accidentally killed off her
  dad twice. Watching And Just Like That mirrors the jarring rush of scrolling
  through Instagram: a wildly incoherent, meaningless and disorienting
  experience that is distracting enough to ensure you come back for more.
  Perhaps part of what makes the show such a joy is that it feels as if you’ve
  entered a dream – right down to the fact that plotlines seem to be fuelled by
  a nonsensical dream logic that flows happily if illogically along. Sure,
  Charlotte experiences debilitating vertigo that has never been mentioned or
  referenced previously! Miranda suddenly throws Charlotte a karaoke party after
  mistakenly believing her dog has cancer – why not?! The closest experience I
  can liken watching And Just Like That to is a “digital art museum” I visited
  on holiday in Tokyo. You moved between colourful inflated balls the size of
  zoo animals, and waded through calf-deep warm water, while DayGlo cherry
  blossoms were projected on to the walls. It was baby sensory play but for
  adults, and it was heaven. I think perhaps this is what And Just Like That is
  – a pleasurable sensory experience, intended to induce a sort of ASMR-like
  bliss. In my more generous moments, I wonder if some comment is being made,
  regarding an atomisation that occurs in late middle-age, or regarding the
  alienation these characters are experiencing as a symptom of being hideously
  rich, given their drifting apart from one another. Is its lack of narrative
  throughlineand absence of basic coherence mirroring the dislocating experience
  of life online? Unfortunately, I’m pretty certain it is not that controlled
  (Sarah Jessica Parker, lead actor and executive producer, doesn’t even watch
  it). Either way, it has been a pleasurably mindless experience, and at a time
  in which I have received a very scary diagnosis for my son, I have welcomed my
  weekly lobotomy with full force. And when it comes back, as I’m almost certain
  it will, I will feel much the same about it as Donald Trump does about
  Coca-Cola: I’ll still keep drinking that garbage.
