  The Thursday Murder Club Richard Osman’s wildly popular series of mystery
  novels has, inevitably, reached our screens, with Chris Columbus taking on the
  first book. We’re very much in “cosy crime” country – no Glass Onion-style
  knowing winks here – with the action set in and around a well-heeled rural
  retirement home. Helen Mirren’s Elizabeth, who used to be in “international
  affairs”, is the prime mover of the titular cold case investigation group,
  which also includes former trade unionist Ron (Pierce Brosnan), psychiatrist
  Ibrahim (Ben Kingsley) and Celia Imrie’s nurse/cake obsessive Joyce. The
  murder of a co-owner of the home leads the quartet on a lightly comic,
  reliably twisty hunt for the killer. Thursday 28 August, Netflix *** Shaft In
  one way, the lead character in Gordon Parks’s 1971 film is in a direct
  Hollywood lineage from Philip Marlowe and Sam Spade – a cynical private eye
  who plays both sides of the law but has a moral compass. However, that Richard
  Roundtree’s sexy, sardonic John Shaft is Black makes him groundbreaking – a
  representation of racial confidence rarely seen on screen before. This slick,
  funky movie doesn’t have any pretensions to high art, though, as Shaft is
  hired by a Harlem gangster to find his missing daughter, crossing fists with
  mobsters and militants. Saturday 23 August, 11.30pm, BBC Two *** The Godfather
  Part II Francis Ford Coppola’s Oscar-winning return to the Corleone clan is a
  splicing of two narratives we’re invited to compare and contrast. In the
  present day, Michael struggles to grow his empire in the face of power plays
  and betrayals; while in 1901, his father Vito arrives as a boy in New York and
  rises to criminal prominence. Robert De Niro is convincing as the young adult
  Vito, making his mark in a lovingly recreated Italian expat community, but Al
  Pacino has the greater impact as his successor – distant and controlling of
  his family but haunted by his choices. Monday 25 August, 10pm, BBC Two ***
  Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy The director of 2021’s Drive My Car, Ryûsuke
  Hamaguchi, released another, even more affecting film the same year. This one
  comprises three short stories in which encounters inadvertently lead to
  emotional revelations: a model realises her best friend has unknowingly fallen
  for her ex-lover; a former student is asked to “honeytrap” a professor and
  novelist she admires; two strangers mistake each other for old schoolmates.
  Bergmanesque dissections of relationships mingle with heartfelt, cathartic
  confessionals to profound effect. Tuesday 26 August, 1.20am, Film4 ***
  Thunderbolts* Calling its supervillain “Bob” suggests this entry in the Marvel
  Cinematic Universe has its tongue at least occasionally in its cheek. And with
  Florence Pugh and David Harbour reprising their semi-comic roles from Black
  Widow as Yelena and Alexei it’s a fun if breathless caper. Chuck in Winter
  Soldier Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), disgraced former Captain America John
  Walker (Wyatt Russell) and Hannah John-Kamen’s Ghost and you have a new set of
  crime-fighting heroes ready to go. Wednesday 27 August, Disney+ *** The Claim
  The snow in the Sierra Nevada can bury a lot of things, but in Michael
  Winterbottom’s weighty version of Thomas Hardy’s The Mayor of Casterbridge, it
  can’t keep the past covered for ever. Peter Mullan is at his brooding best as
  Dillon, the benevolent dictator of 1860s gold-mining settlement Kingdom Come.
  But two arrivals spell doom. There’s surveyor Dalglish (Wes Bentley) who may –
  or may not – send the railroad through his town; and there’s his wife Elena
  (Nastassja Kinski) and their daughter Hope (Sarah Polley), whom Dillon sold
  for a gold claim years earlier … Wednesday 27 August, midnight, Talking
  Pictures TV *** The Driller Killer Unfairly drawn into the “video nasties”
  furore of the early 1980s, Abel Ferrara’s low-budget thriller is actually
  relatively restrained in its blood-letting. Troubled painter Reno (Ferrara
  himself) only starts losing his grip on reality – taking up his
  battery-operated drill to attack homeless men – late on in a drama more
  interested in the hard-scrabble life of the marginalised and the mentally ill
  in a crime-ridden New York. From the down-and-outs on the streets to the punk
  band rehearsing next door, it’s a time capsule of the late-70s city. Friday 29
  August, 10.10pm, Talking Pictures TV
