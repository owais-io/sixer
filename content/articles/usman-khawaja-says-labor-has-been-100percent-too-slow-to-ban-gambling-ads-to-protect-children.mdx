  Australian cricketer Usman Khawaja says the Albanese government has been “100%
  too slow” to ban gambling ads and must sever the link between the wagering and
  sport to protect children. Khawaja made a public plea for change alongside a
  group of crossbench MPs, public health academics, doctors and other experts at
  Parliament House. “The relationship that young kids are having with gambling
  is scary and it’s dangerous,” Khawaja said. “We are normalising gambling for
  the younger generation. “I can’t watch an NRL game without getting odds right
  before a game. I play grade cricket with young cricketers who are coming
  through. There are 16-year-olds with gambling accounts and they cannot watch
  the game without putting a bet on.” Sign up: AU Breaking News email The
  Albanese government is yet to formally respond to a bipartisan parliamentary
  report led by the late Labor MP Peta Murphy, which called for a comprehensive
  ban on gambling ads after a three-year transition period. The government had
  planned to introduce legislation before the federal election in May but
  reforms were shelved amid fierce opposition from broadcasters, sporting codes
  and some bookmakers. The communications minister, Annika Wells, has restarted
  negotiations with industry and several gambling sources have told Guardian
  Australia they expect to see legislation by the end of the year. When asked
  what the government’s first step should be, Khawaja said it should “ban
  gambling from sport – it’s quite simple”. “You have to go cold turkey, it’s
  the same as what happened with tobacco,” Khawaja said. “We have a
  responsibility. “If gambling is repeatedly being brought together with sport
  and athletes, showing you can’t watch sport without gambling, then it is a
  very, very dangerous precedent to set.” Khawaja met with Albanese and the
  treasurer, Jim Chalmers, on Thursday, after the cricketer said he had earlier
  been told that a scheduled meeting with the prime minister had been cancelled.
  Chalmers later said he and Albanese had met Khawaja but that the conversation
  focused “solely” on the Middle East. Khawaja had earlier fronted another press
  conference – alongside David Pocock, Labor MP Ed Husic, and other independent
  MPs including Helen Haines and Kate Chaney – calling for the government to
  level further sanctions on Israel, and cut trade ties, over Palestinian
  civilian deaths from the war in Gaza. Chalmers described Khawaja as a friend
  and a “wonderful humanitarian”. “We have a lot of respect [for Khawaja] and we
  listened to him on the issues … he’s a leader of real substance, not just the
  leader in the faith community, but a leader more broadly,” Chalmers said. “I
  take his contribution very seriously. I’m grateful … that he’s made the time
  to come and talk with us directly about these issues.” The prime minister and
  communication minister’s offices were contacted for comment. Earlier this
  week, when asked why it had taken more than two years to respond to the
  inquiry, Albanese told parliament the government was mindful “of whether
  people just go offshore” to continue gambling. Offshore gambling service are
  banned in Australia and not subject to consumer protections. Samantha Thomas,
  a professor of public health at Deakin University who specialises in gambling
  research, said she was concerned the government appeared to be using “industry
  talking points”. Many bookmakers have long argued restricting gambling in
  Australia would push consumers to offshore competitors, which are not subject
  to consumer protections. “Despite industry rhetoric, there is limited
  independent evidence to suggest that ad bans would lead to a mass exodus to
  illegal markets,” Thomas said. “Independent analysis also shows that we don’t
  need gambling ads to protect free-to-air television and big media brands. If
  we are to move forward in Australia, we must also disrupt industry influence
  over policy.” Dr Kerrie Aust from the Australian Medical Association was among
  the group calling for change. She said that, as a GP, she “had seen the damage
  gambling is causing and its links with mental health disorders and substance
  abuse”. “It’s disappointing that steps have not been taken to address the
  really good evidence in this [parliamentary] report and the really good
  recommendations that came from it,” Aust said. “We wants kids and young people
  playing sport and having their heroes without a constant stream of gambling
  advertising.” Independent MP Kate Chaney, who was a member of the Murphy
  inquiry, accused the federal government of “listening to the money from
  gambling, sport and the media instead of listening to the voices of the
  community”.
