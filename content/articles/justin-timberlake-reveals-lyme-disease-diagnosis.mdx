  Justin Timberlake has said he is suffering from Lyme disease, a serious
  illness usually contracted after being bitten by a tick and that has seen an
  upsurge in prevalence across a swathe of the US in recent years. In an
  Instagram post, the pop singer wrote: “I’ve been battling some health issues,
  and was diagnosed with Lyme disease – which I don’t say so you feel bad for me
  – but to shed some light on what I’ve been up against behind the scenes.” He
  added: “If you’ve experienced this disease or know someone who has – then
  you’re aware: living with this can be relentlessly debilitating, both mentally
  and physically. When I first got the diagnosis I was shocked for sure. But, at
  least I could understand why I would be on stage and in a massive amount of
  nerve pain or, just feeling crazy fatigue or sickness.” Timberlake’s post came
  at the end of more than a year of him being on tour, which kicked off in April
  2024, about one month after he released the album Everything I Thought It Was.
  The singer faced scrutiny following perceived lackluster performances on the
  road, with some who bought tickets criticizing the concert on social media.
  Recently, some fans and commentators have pointed out what they felt were
  signs of fatigue or ill health during his performances. Timberlake addressed
  the concerns, saying: “I was faced with a personal decision. Stop touring? Or,
  keep going and figure it out. I decided the joy that performing brings me far
  outweighs the fleeting stress my body was feeling. I’m so glad I kept going.”
  He added: “Not only did I prove my mental tenacity to myself but, I now have
  so many special moments with all of you that I will never forget. I was
  reluctant to talk about this because I was always raised to keep something
  like this to yourself. But I am trying to be more transparent about my
  struggles so that they aren’t misinterpreted.” His statement on social media
  was met with an outpouring of support from fans. “You are so loved, and we’ll
  be here supporting whatever you decide to do next,” said one. Another added:
  “Justin you are so appreciated. Thank you for showing up for us time and time
  again. Take care of yourself. We love you and will continue to ride for you.”
  According to Billboard, the Forget Tomorrow world tour pushed Timberlake to
  the 10th spot of Billboard‘s midyear Boxscore report of touring artists, with
  the tour grossing $73.2m across 41 shows as of late May. Timberlake is not the
  first famous musician who has spoken out publicly about their struggles with a
  diagnosis of Lyme disease, a condition which can cause a rash and symptoms
  such as fever, chills, fatigue and muscle and joint aches. Avril Lavigne,
  Justin Bieber and Shania Twain have also revealed they have suffered from the
  illness. Lyme disease can last many months or even years. Potentially
  disease-bearing ticks have been flourishing recently in the US, especially as
  climate change leads to warmer summers that encourage tick populations to
  thrive. This year, as compared to recent years, there has been an increase in
  the reported number of ticks and visits to the emergency room because of bites
  from the tiny parasitic arachnid, according to data from universities and the
  US federal government. In May and June this year, the US has seen the highest
  number of emergency room visits during those months for tick bites since 2019,
  according to the CDC. Timberlake began his career as a “Mouseketeer” on the
  All-New Mickey Mouse Club in 1993, where his cast mates included fellow
  singers Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. He rose to fame in the popular
  boy band ‘NSync, before going solo in 2002 and going on to become one of the
  best-selling pop artists of the 2000s.
