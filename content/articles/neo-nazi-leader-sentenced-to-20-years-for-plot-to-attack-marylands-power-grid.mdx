  The founder of a Florida-based neo-Nazi group has been sentenced to 20 years
  in federal prison for conspiring with his girlfriend to plan an attack on
  Maryland’s power grid in furtherance of their shared racist beliefs. Brandon
  Russell, 30, was convicted by a jury earlier this year. Prosecutors presented
  evidence detailing his longstanding affiliation with white supremacist causes
  and his recent efforts to organize “sniper attacks” on electrical substations
  around Baltimore. During a sentencing hearing Thursday afternoon in federal
  court in Baltimore, US district judge James Bredar excoriated the defendant
  for his reprehensible views, saying Russell was clearly the brains behind the
  operation, which sought to precipitate societal collapse by targeting the
  energy infrastructure of a majority-Black city. In the aftermath of the
  planned attacks, Russell and his co-defendant, Sarah Beth Clendaniel, intended
  to “create their own bizarre utopia populated by people who only look and
  think like they do”, Bredar said. “Well, that’s not how it works,” the judge
  continued. “The law doesn’t permit that. We don’t change course in this
  country via violent overthrow.” Bredar imposed the maximum sentence allowed
  for Russell’s conviction of conspiracy to damage an energy facility. The judge
  also ordered a lifetime of supervised release, including close monitoring of
  Russell’s electronic devices. Bredar previously sentenced Clendaniel to 18
  years behind bars after she pleaded guilty to her role in the plot. He said
  Russell should receive a longer sentence because he was more culpable and
  contributed the “intellectual horsepower” that propelled the plot closer to
  fruition. The two were arrested in February 2023 — before their plans were
  executed. At trial, it was alleged that the planned attacks could have
  affected significant portions of Baltimore and caused nearly $70m in damage to
  electrical transformers. An FBI employee who engaged Russell online while
  undercover as a neo-Nazi testified during the trial about conversations in
  which Russell urged him to attack power stations and power lines. Russell’s
  attorney, Ian Goldstein, has argued that Clendaniel posed a greater threat
  because she was taking steps to obtain a firearm and shoot up electrical
  substations. Meanwhile, Russell was living in Florida with absolutely no plans
  to travel to Maryland, according to his attorney. “For Mr Russell, everything
  was talk,” Goldstein told the court. He also pointed to Russell’s supportive
  family. Court papers filed ahead of sentencing included a letter from his
  mother, who said she believes he’s been trying to fill the void left by a
  largely absent father. She said some challenges arose with her son after she
  moved them back to the Bahamas, where she has relatives. “Brandon Russell is
  an educated young man who has served this country’s military,” his attorney
  wrote, connecting his descent into nazism with longstanding mental health
  challenges. “His family relationships speak volumes of the person he can be.”
  The judge wasn’t persuaded, but he noted Russell’s “somewhat complicated
  psycho-social history” and recommended mental health treatment during his time
  in prison. Russell declined to address the judge directly. He appeared in
  court wearing maroon prison attire and showed no obvious signs of emotion
  during the hearing. Several years ago, Russell co-founded the neo-Nazi group
  Atomwaffen Division, which is German for “atomic weapon”. The guerrilla group
  was connected to five murders and several bomb plots, but was taken down by
  federal agents in 2020. Prosecutors in California said a man convicted last
  year of stabbing to death Blaze Bernstein, a gay, Jewish university student in
  a hate crime was affiliated with Atomwaffen Division. Russell’s trial provided
  a window into the Biden administration’s efforts to take on violent rightwing
  extremists, the Guardian previously reported. Current and former state
  department officials have raised concerns that the Trump administration was
  minimizing threats of far-right and white supremacist violence. This wasn’t
  Russell’s first run-in with law enforcement. In 2017, police responded to a
  double homicide at a Tampa apartment building and found Russell outside
  crying, dressed in military fatigues. One of his roommates had killed the
  other two, officials said. During a search of the house, police found a stash
  of highly explosive materials and a cache of neo-Nazi signs, posters, books
  and flags. Russell pleaded guilty to possession of an unregistered destructive
  device and improper storage of explosives.
