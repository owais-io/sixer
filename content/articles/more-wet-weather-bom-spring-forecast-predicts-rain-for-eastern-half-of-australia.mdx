  More wet weather: BoM spring forecast predicts rain for eastern half of
  Australia

  Spring looks set to be wetter than usual for Australia’s entire eastern half,
  according to the Bureau of Meteorology’s latest long-range forecast, after
  data showed record heat in the ocean around the continent in July. The
  bureau’s forecast for spring also pointed to warmer than average night-time
  temperatures over almost the entire country. Daytime temperatures were also
  likely to be above average across the north and south, with average conditions
  expected in south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales. Tasmania is
  likely to see maximum temperatures in the top 20% on record, the forecast
  showed. Global weather models suggested warmer waters in the eastern part of
  the Indian Ocean off Australia’s north-west were developing – a phenomenon
  known as a negative Indian Ocean Dipole, which can bring wetter conditions. Dr
  Simon Grainger, senior climatologist at the bureau, said: “It looks like we’re
  in the early stages of that negative IOD. “Historically we have seen that [a
  negative IOD] tends to favour wetter than average springs, particularly inland
  from the dividing range in NSW and Victoria.” Spring rainfall is between 60%
  and 80% more likely to be above average across most of the country’s east and
  September and October could be particularly wet, Grainger said. The increased
  cloud cover that could bring the rain would also help keep night-time
  temperatures above average almost everywhere except the south-west corner of
  Western Australia. Record ocean heat In the ocean, the bureau expects warmer
  than average sea surface temperatures (SST) to the north, east and south-east
  which could “enhance the severity of storms and rain systems”. Just like on
  land, global heating – caused mostly by burning fossil fuels – has been
  pushing up ocean temperatures around the globe. SSTs in July were 0.56C above
  average for the Australian region – the warmest July on the bureau’s record
  that goes back to 1900. The region’s SSTs have been at record, or near-record
  levels, since July last year, the bureau said. Australia’s hotter oceans were
  “part of a pattern we have seen globally,” said Grainger, where, since March
  2023, temperatures have been at record highs. “In a globally warming climate,
  about 90% of the extra heat goes into the oceans,” he said. Increased bushfire
  risk Australia’s climate has warmed by 1.5C since the bureau’s official
  temperature data record started in 1910. Spring 2024 was Australia’s warmest
  on record and since then, the country has broken a string of heat records. The
  12 months ending in March 2025 were 1.61C above average – the hottest of any
  12-month period on record. Earlier this week, fire chiefs said despite the
  expected wet conditions, they were expecting an increased risk of spring
  bushfires in parts of Victoria and northern and central WA. There was a
  heightened risk of bushfire for the Dampier Peninsula, Derby Coast and the
  central Kimberley, Little Sandy Desert and south-eastern Pilbara in WA. In the
  report, the fire chiefs said there was also increase bushfire risk for
  south-eastern agricultural areas of the Murraylands in South Australia and
  parts of Victoria, including south-west Gipplsland.
