  Sanjeev Gupta is preparing a last-ditch attempt to save the remaining arm of
  his Liberty Steel business as government officials step up planning for a
  collapse of the business within days. Gupta is understood to have spent the
  weekend planning an 11th-hour rescue deal to save the company’s Speciality
  Steel UK (SSUK) division days before a courtroom showdown with its creditors
  on Wednesday. The metals magnate hopes to secure a pre-pack administration
  deal that would allow the company to ditch its debts and other liabilities
  before being bought back by Gupta or parties connected to him. The plan is
  likely to raise eyebrows in Whitehall, where government officials are
  reportedly planning for a collapse of the heavily indebted steel division
  while fraud investigations into other areas of Gupta’s business empire remain
  open. A Liberty Steel spokesperson said discussions were ongoing to finalise
  options for SSUK that “best serve the interests of creditors, employees and
  the broader community”. The restructuring specialist Begbies Traynor is
  working on the pre-pack deal, according to Sky News, which first reported the
  plans, but any deal would need Liberty Steel’s creditors, including the
  British tax authority, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and the Swiss lender UBS,
  to agree to write off potentially hundreds of millions of pounds of debt.
  Gupta has limited time to finalise any attempt to rescue his subsidiary before
  an expected court hearing on Wednesday relating to a winding-up petition that
  was issued by a supplier over unpaid debts. Government officials have
  reportedly stepped up planning for the collapse of SSUK if the winding-up
  petition is approved this week, according to Sky. The hearing, which has
  already been deferred several times, could force SSUK into compulsory
  liquidation, leaving a court-appointed official receiver to run the business.
  SSUK is the UK’s third-largest steel producer and employs nearly 1,500 people.
  The South Yorkshire-based business includes an electric arc furnace at
  Rotherham, plus steelworks in Stocksbridge near Sheffield making steel for the
  car industry, as well as for use in construction and engineering. Financial
  pressure has been mounting on Gupta’s metals and energy companies stretching
  from Australia through Singapore and Romania to northern England, known as the
  GFG Alliance. The group has been in trouble since the 2021 failure of
  Greensill Capital, which collapsed after lending GFG about $5bn (£3.7bn).
  Gupta has been engaged in long-running talks with the administrators of
  Greensill, who are trying to recover the money. GFG has been under
  investigation by the UK’s Serious Fraud Office since 2021 in relation to the
  Greensill financing. The company and Gupta have denied any wrongdoing. Gupta
  is also being prosecuted by Companies House over the failure to file accounts
  for more than 70 UK businesses – including those of Liberty Pipes, based in
  Hartlepool. He has pleaded not guilty. Some industry figures have said they
  expect the government to step in to ensure the plants keep running if they
  fall into liquidation – although it is not thought that the government will
  give financial support to Gupta’s companies. A spokesperson at the Department
  for Business and Trade said: “We continue to closely monitor developments
  around Liberty Steel, including any public hearings, which are a matter for
  the company.” Continued financial pressures on Gupta’s companies have followed
  years of difficulty for the wider UK steel industry. British steel production
  fell to its lowest level since the 1930s in 2024, and the government in effect
  took over the British Steel blast furnaces at Scunthorpe in April, amid fears
  of more than 2,700 job losses and the end of primary steel-making in the UK.
