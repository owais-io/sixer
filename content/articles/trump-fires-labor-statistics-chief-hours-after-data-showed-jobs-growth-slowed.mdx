  Donald Trump fired the federal government official in charge of labor
  statistics, hours after data revealed jobs growth stalled this summer,
  prompting accusations that he is “firing the messenger”. The US president
  claimed that Erika McEntarfer, commissioner of labor statistics, had “faked”
  employment figures in the run-up to last year’s election, in an effort to
  boost Kamala Harris’s chances of victory. Trump later claimed: “Today’s Jobs
  Numbers were RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad”. He
  produced no evidence for these allegations, and insisted that the US economy
  was, in fact, “BOOMING” on his watch. But Friday’s employment figures told a
  very different story, and raised questions about the state of the labor market
  since Trump’s return to office. “We need accurate Jobs Numbers,” he wrote on
  Truth Social. “I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee,
  IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and
  qualified.” McEntarfer was contacted for comment. The Bureau of Labor
  Statistics (BLS) confirmed in a brief statement that she had been dismissed.
  William Wiatrowski, the agency’s deputy commissioner, will serve as acting
  commissioner. Trump’s abrupt announcement came as administration officials
  scrambled to explain a lackluster employment report. Not only did jobs growth
  fail to meet expectations in July, but previous estimates for May and June
  were revised significantly lower. The president was promptly accused of trying
  to hide accurate statistics. “Trump is firing the messenger because he doesn’t
  seem to like jobs numbers that reflect how badly he’s damaged the economy,”
  said Lily Roberts, managing director for inclusive growth at the Center for
  American Progress, a thinktank. “Politicizing our country’s collection of data
  on what’s going on in the economy … will make it harder to create an economy
  that makes sure everyone has a good job,” added Roberts. “Borrowing from the
  authoritarian playbook fuels more uncertainty that will cost Americans for
  years to come.” Paul Schroeder, executive director of the Council of
  Professional Associations on Federal Statistics, described the president’s
  allegation as “very damaging and outrageous”, adding: “Not only does it
  undermine the integrity of federal economic statistics but it also politicizes
  data which need to remain independent and trustworthy. This action is a grave
  error by the administration and one that will have ramifications for years to
  come.” McEntarfer is a widely respected economist and veteran employee of the
  federal government. She previously worked at the US Census Bureau under George
  W Bush and at the US census bureau under Barack Obama, Trump and Joe Biden. In
  January 2024, before McEntarfer’s confirmation for her current post by the US
  Senate, her nomination was backed by four former BLS commissioners. In a
  letter also signed by organizations including the American Statistics
  Association and a string of senior economists, they said there were “many
  reasons” to confirm McEntarfer as commissioner of labor statistics, citing her
  “wealth of research and statistical experience”. She was ultimately confirmed
  by a vote in the Senate, with 86 votes cast in favor and eight against. Gene
  Sperling, chair of the national economic council under Bill Clinton and Obama,
  and who worked as an official under Biden, said he expected Trump to “destroy
  the credibility” of economic data when his administration suffered its first
  bad jobs report. “Now: first bad job report, and he just fired BLS head over
  absurd claims of bias,” Sperling wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Trump’s
  decision to fire McEntarfer was “outrageous but not surprising”, said Julie
  Su, former acting US labor secretary under Biden. “He hates facts, so he
  blames truth-tellers.” The US “needs and deserves trustworthy economic data”,
  added Su. “This is a pathetic attempt by the president to gaslight everyone
  about the consequences of his disastrous economic policies.”
