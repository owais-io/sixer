  Multiple news organisations have taken down articles written by an alleged
  freelance journalist that now appear to have been generated by AI. On
  Thursday, Press Gazette reported that at least six publications, including
  Wired and Business Insider, have removed articles from their websites in
  recent months after it was discovered that the stories – written under the
  name of Margaux Blanchard – were AI-generated. Wired published a story titled
  “They Fell in Love Playing Minecraft. Then the Game Became Their Wedding
  Venue” in May. A few weeks later, the outlet took down the story, stating in
  an editor’s note: “After an additional review of the article … Wired editorial
  leadership has determined this article does not meet our editorial standards.”
  The story cited a “Jessica Hu”, an alleged 34-year-old “ordained officiant
  based in Chicago” who reportedly “made a name for herself as a ‘digital
  celebrant’, specialising in ceremonies across Twitch, Discord and VRChat”,
  according to Press Gazette, which reviewed the Wired article. Both the Press
  Gazette and the Guardian were not able to verify the identity of Hu. Press
  Gazette further reported that in April, Business Insider published two essays
  by Blanchard titled: “Remote work has been the best thing for me as a parent
  but the worst as a person” and “I had my first kid at 45. I’m financially
  stable and have years of life experience to guide me.” Earlier this week,
  Business Insider removed the articles after Press Gazette alerted the outlet
  over the authenticity of the author. Both article pages now feature a message
  saying that the stories were “removed because [they] didn’t meet Business
  Insider’s standards”. In a statement to the Guardian, a Business Insider
  spokesperson said: “We have removed first-person essays that didn’t meet
  Business Insider’s standards and have since bolstered verification protocols.”
  In an article published on Thursday, Wired’s management acknowledged the faux
  pas, saying: “If anyone should be able to catch an AI scammer, it’s Wired. In
  fact we do, all the time … Unfortunately, one got through.” The outlet
  explained that on 7 April, one of its editors received a pitch about the “rise
  of hyper-niche internet weddings”. According to the outlet, the pitch had “all
  the hallmarks of a great Wired story”. Wired said that after some standard
  correspondence about framing and payment, the editor assigned the story which
  ran on 7 May. However, in the days that followed, it “became clear that the
  writer was unable to provide enough information to be entered into our
  payments system”. The outlet added that the writer insisted on payment by
  PayPal or check. Upon further investigation, it became clear to the outlet
  that the story was fabricated. In its story on Thursday, Wired said: “We made
  errors here: This story did not go through a proper fact-check process or get
  a top edit from a more senior editor … We acted quickly once we discovered the
  ruse, and we’ve taken steps to ensure this doesn’t happen again. In this new
  era, every newsroom should be prepared to do the same.” Press Gazette says it
  was first alerted to the inauthenticity of Blanchard’s articles by Jacob
  Furedi, editor of a new magazine called Dispatch. Furedi said that he received
  a pitch from Blanchard earlier this month about “Gravemont, a decommissioned
  mining town in rural Colorado that has been repurposed into one of the world’s
  most secretive training grounds for death investigation”. In the pitch, which
  Furedi shared with Press Gazette, Blanchard wrote: “I want to tell the story
  of the scientists, ex-cops, and former miners who now handle the dead daily –
  not as mourners, but as archivists of truth. I’ll explore the ethical
  tightrope of using real human remains in staged environments, the shadow
  economy of body donations, and the emotional toll on those who make a living
  from simulated tragedy. “I’m the right person for this because I’ve reported
  on hidden training sites before, have clearance contacts in forensic circles,
  and know how to navigate sensitive, closed-off communities with empathy and
  discretion,” she added. Furedi told the Press Gazette that pitch sounded like
  it was generated by ChatGPT and couldn’t find details about Gravemont. The
  Guardian has also not been able to verify details of the alleged town. Upon
  asking Blanchard how she discovered the town, she replied: “I’m not surprised
  you couldn’t find much – Gravemont doesn’t advertise itself. I first heard
  about it while interviewing a retired forensic pathologist for an unrelated
  piece.” She went on to say: “Over the next few months, I pieced together more
  through a mix of public records requests, conversations with former trainees,
  and hints buried in conference materials from forensic associations. None of
  them referred to it by name in print, but the details lined up. Eventually, I
  spoke with a former miner from the area who confirmed the site’s
  transformation after the mine closure. “It’s one of those places that exists
  in the industry’s collective memory, but just under the radar enough to evade
  coverage – which is exactly why I think it would resonate with Dispatch
  readers,” Blanchard added. Furedi told Press Gazette that despite the pitch
  seeming “very convincing”, he knew she was “bullshitting”. He asked Blanchard
  for public record requests, about her standard rate and how long she planned
  to spend in the field. In response, Blanchard ignored Furedi’s request to see
  public records requests and instead said she would “ideally spend 5-7 days on
  the ground” and be paid around $670, Press Gazette reports. Last Friday,
  Furedi accused Blanchard via email of publishing false stories to which she
  has not responded. Press Gazette further reports that Blanchard has not
  responded to its own request for her to provide evidence that she is a real
  person. This incident of false AI-generated reporting follows a May error when
  the Chicago Sun-Times’ Sunday paper ran a syndicated section with a fake
  reading list created by AI. Marco Buscaglia, a journalist who was working for
  King Features Syndicate, turned to AI to help generate the list, saying:
  “Stupidly, and 100% on me, I just kind of republished this list that [an AI
  program] spit out … Usually, it’s something I wouldn’t do … Even if I’m not
  writing something, I’m at least making sure that I correctly source it and vet
  it and make sure it’s all legitimate. And I definitely failed in that task.”
  Meanwhile, in June, the Utah court of appeals sanctioned a lawyer after he was
  discovered to have used ChatGPT for a filing he made in which he referenced a
  nonexistent court case.
