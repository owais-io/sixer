  Lidia Thorpe has condemned the “shameful” number of Indigenous deaths in
  custody, including 17 this year, as the latest figures show just four of 19
  Closing the Gap targets are on track to be met. Key targets, including youth
  and adult imprisonment rates, children in out-of-home care, suicide and
  childhood development are continuing to worsen, according to the latest data
  from the Productivity Commission. Thorpe moved a condolence motion, in the
  Senate on Thursday morning, supported by Labor and the Greens, extending
  sympathies to the families of the 17 First Nations people who have died in
  custody this year. They include 24-year-old Warlpiri man Kumanjayi White, who
  died in May after being restrained by officers at an Alice Springs
  supermarket. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The motion urged all
  parliamentarians to do better to prevent further deaths in custody. Since the
  release of the 1991 royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody, there
  has been 602 Indigenous deaths in custody. “These are not just statistics.
  They are sons, daughters, mothers, fathers, cousins, siblings, grandchildren –
  lost to a system that continues to harm our people,” Thorpe said. “This motion
  is about preventing that pain from continuing. It’s about doing what we can,
  here and now, to ensure that Kumanjayi’s death is not just another entry in a
  long and shameful list. It must be a turning point.” One of the Closing the
  Gap targets aims to reduce the rate of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
  adults held in incarceration by at least 15% by 2031. The 2023-24 data showed
  the rate had worsened since the 2019 baseline, from 1,906.1 per 100,000 adult
  population to 2,041.5 per 100,000. The number of Indigenous youths under 18 in
  prisons had also increased year-on-year and remained off-target – but had
  improved from the 2019 baseline. “We need more action by states and
  territories to keep First Nations people out of justice systems and ensure
  they are safe when in custody,” the environment minister, Murray Watt, told
  the Senate. “The government is working to keep people out of the justice
  system and ensure they are safe when in custody, but when there are steps
  backwards, we need to call them out and listen to those calling for change.”
  Attorney generals from state and territory governments will meet in August to
  discuss Closing the Gap targets. They will also discuss the Northern
  Territory’s decision to reintroduce spit hoods for 10-year-old children in
  custody. Without changing the approach to Closing the Gap, Aboriginal and
  Torres Strait Islander people will continue to “pay the price”, Indigenous
  organisations say. While there have been improvements in year 12 attainment,
  tertiary education and housing access, these targets are also not on track to
  meet deadlines. “It’s not enough to hope the gap will close, governments must
  hold themselves to account for the commitments they’ve made under the national
  agreement,” the Coalition of Peaks lead convener, Pat Turner, said. “That
  requires smart investment, longer-term flexible funding and full
  implementation of the four priority reforms – shifting power, not just policy.
  “Without real power shift, we’ll keep seeing the same patterns repeat and our
  people will continue to pay the price.” The Queensland Aboriginal and Islander
  Health Council chief executive, Paula Arnol, said the latest Closing the Gap
  report card was disappointing. “It’s 2025 and Aboriginal and Torres Strait
  Islander people are still not experiencing the health outcomes that
  non-Indigenous Australians enjoy. This is unacceptable,” she said. The data
  follows a recent review of the Closing the Gap agreement, commissioned by the
  Coalition of Peaks. The review found Indigenous community-controlled
  organisations are key to progress, and governments must listen to First
  Nations people and share decision-making power to create positive change.
  Productivity commissioner Selwyn Button said the review shows the outcomes of
  the agreement are falling well short of what governments have committed to.
  “What the outcomes in the agreement reflect most of all is the limited
  progress of governments in collectively acting on the priority reforms:
  sharing decision-making and data with communities; strengthening the
  Aboriginal community controlled sector and changing the way governments
  operate,” he said. Turner said improvements in early education enrolments,
  employment and land and sea rights show what’s possible when government
  partner with Indigenous organisations “in the right way”. But she said when
  governments fail to meet their commitments to work with community-controlled
  organisations, the gap widens. “What’s important for Australians to understand
  is that Aboriginal community-controlled organisations are not fringe
  services,” Turner said. “We’re not asking for special treatment. We’re asking
  for a fair share. When we get that, we deliver.” • Indigenous Australians can
