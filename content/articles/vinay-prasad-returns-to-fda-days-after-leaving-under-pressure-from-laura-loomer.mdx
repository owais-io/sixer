  Vinay Prasad is returning to his role overseeing vaccine, gene therapy and
  blood product regulation at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) a little
  more than a week after he left the agency. “At the FDA’s request, Dr Vinay
  Prasad is resuming leadership of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and
  Research,” Department Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon said
  in a statement to Reuters. Prasad left the agency on 30 July after just a few
  months as the director of the center. Endpoints News, which covers the biotech
  industry, first reported the return of Prasad. Prasad, an oncologist who was a
  fierce critic of US Covid-19 vaccine and mask mandates, was named the center’s
  director by the FDA’s commissioner, Marty Makary, in May. Criticism of
  Prasad’s tenure intensified around the agency’s handling of a gene therapy for
  Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) from Sarepta Therapeutics. The FDA-approved
  therapy played a role in the death of two teens who had advanced DMD. After a
  third death in a separate experimental gene therapy from the company, the FDA
  asked Sarepta on 18 July to stop all shipments of the approved DMD therapy,
  saying it had safety concerns. The FDA changed course on Sarepta on 28 July
  and said shipments to the main group of patients for the drug could restart.
  Laura Loomer, a far-right influencer and conspiracy theorist with outsized
  sway over Donald Trump, had called Prasad a “progressive leftist saboteur” who
  was undermining the agency’s work. Two days before Prasad stepped down last
  month, Loomer had released misleadingly edited audio to suggest that that
  Prasad had admitted sticking pins in a Trump voodoo doll, when the full audio
  made it clear that he was talking about the kind of thing an imagined liberal
  Trump-hater would do. Loomer reacted to the news of Prasad’s return on
  Saturday by renewing her attacks on him in a social media post in which she
  promised to produce “exposes of officials within HHS and FDA” in the weeks
  ahead. “There are several Senate Confirmation hearings coming up and I have
  multiple oppo books ready for distribution!” she wrote. Prasad was a physician
  who joined the agency from the University of California, San Francisco. He has
  had stints at the National Cancer Institute and the National Institutes of
  Health. The FDA and other health agencies have seen multiple shake-ups in
  recent months under the leadership of health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr.
