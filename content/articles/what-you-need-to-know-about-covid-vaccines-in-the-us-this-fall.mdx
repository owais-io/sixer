  There is a lot of confusion about Covid vaccines this year. In late August,
  the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that it had rescinded
  emergency use authorizations (a tool that allows the FDA to expedite the
  availability of certain medications) for Covid-19 vaccines. It also said it
  had approved updated versions of the Covid-19 vaccine, but only for certain
  groups. New restrictions limit shots to adults 65 and older and those with at
  least one underlying condition that puts them at higher risk for severe Covid
  – a significant shift from previous guidelines, which approved Covid vaccines
  for all Americans that are six months and older. The move comes as a new Covid
  variant known as XFG or “Stratus” is spreading in the US. Robert F Kennedy Jr,
  the US health secretary and prominent vaccine skeptic, praised the FDA in a
  post on X, saying that the framework ended Biden-era vaccine “mandates” while
  still keeping “vaccines available to those who want them”. FDA commissioner,
  Dr Marty Makary, echoed this, writing in his own post: “100% of the adults in
  this country can still get the vaccine if they choose.” But access probably
  won’t be that straightforward, say experts. “We have plenty of Covid
  circulating in the US,” says Dr Adam Ratner, a member of the American Academy
  of Pediatrics (AAP) committee on infectious disease. “The more people who
  choose not to vaccinate their kids and not to vaccinate themselves, the more
  it will spread.” He adds that he worries that fewer people getting vaccinated
  could lead to “larger and more severe outbreaks”. Below, what we currently
  know about the availability of Covid-19 vaccines in the US in 2025. What Covid
  vaccines will be available this year? Kennedy announced that the FDA had
  approved Moderna vaccines for those six months and older, Pfizer vaccines for
  those five years old and older, and Novavax vaccines for those 12 years old
  and older. Who can get a Covid vaccine this year? Although administration
  health officials claim that any adult who wants a vaccine will be able to get
  one, experts say that is unlikely to be the case in practice. “This is
  misleading,” wrote Dr Jake Scott, a clinical associate professor of infectious
  diseases at Stanford Medicine, in a reply to Makary’s tweet. He went on to
  outline barriers the new restrictions have imposed: “Insurance won’t cover
  off-label use ($150+ costs), pharmacies can’t administer [vaccines] without
  CDC recommendations you haven’t issued, and you eliminated Pfizer for under-5s
  entirely.” “‘Available’ with barriers isn’t accessible,” he concluded. Scott
  told the Guardian that the FDA’s announcement “causes so much chaos and
  confusion”. Under the FDA’s newly announced rules, people under 65 must be
  considered “high risk” to qualify. It is unclear whether official CDC
  immunization guidelines will be the same. The CDC’s advisory committee on
  immunization practices (ACIP), which develops recommendations for the use of
  vaccines, will meet in September and discuss Covid vaccine policy. But there
  is concern among the medical community about the ACIP’s upcoming
  recommendations. In June, Kennedy fired all 17 sitting members of the panel,
  and announced eight new members, many of whom are vocal vaccine skeptics.
  “There’s a lot of concern about this ACIP and our ability to get science-based
  recommendations from them,” says Ratner. Who counts as ‘high risk’ for Covid
  vaccine eligibility? Under the FDA’s new rules, adults under 65 qualify for a
  Covid vaccine if they have “at least one underlying condition that puts them
  at high risk for severe outcomes from Covid-19”. But what qualifies as an
  underlying condition is unclear. “The definitive answer to that has not been
  put out by the FDA or the CDC yet,” says Dr Richard Ricciardi, a practicing
  nurse practitioner and associate dean for clinical practice and community
  engagement at the George Washington University School of Nursing. “So who
  qualifies for a vaccine is still a little nebulous.” A previous list put out
  by the CDC in February 2025 lists 22 qualifying conditions, including asthma,
  cancer, diabetes types 1 and 2, HIV, mental health conditions including
  depression, obesity, physical inactivity and smoking. There is also reason to
  believe that the CDC’s new list will not be the same. Although the previous
  list includes pregnancy as an underlying condition, Kennedy announced in May
  that Covid vaccines were no longer recommended for healthy pregnant women and
  children. This reversal was made without the usual outside input by
  professional medical organizations, and in June, the AAP and dozens of other
  major medical associations signed an open letter opposing this new policy.
  “Pregnancy’s a risk factor for a lot of reasons,” says Ricciardi. “Your lungs
  are compressed, your immune system changes dramatically and you don’t fight
  off infections as well as you would when you’re not pregnant.” Ricciardi adds
  that pregnant women have safely been getting Covid vaccines for years. “And
  now they’re not able to,” he says. Can children get the Covid vaccine? Since
  the CDC no longer recommends Covid-19 vaccines for healthy children, there is
  confusion among parents and healthcare providers about whether children will
  be able to get Covid vaccines or other routine vaccines, says Ratner. The new
  guidelines are at odds with the AAP’s recommended vaccine schedule, Ratner
  says. The AAP’s position is that “infants and children 6 months through 23
  months of age are at high risk for severe Covid-19” and that all of those
  within this group who do not have any contraindications should be vaccinated
  against the disease. “For older kids, a risk-based approach is reasonable,”
  says Ratner. The group suggests that any child with high risk factors should
  be vaccinated, and any parents who want their children – high risk or not – to
  get vaccinated should be able to do so. Going forward, parents will have to
  consult with pediatricians to determine whether their child gets a vaccine. If
  they have a healthy child, the pediatrician may have to administer the vaccine
  off-label (meaning an unapproved use of a drug) and there is no guarantee
  doctors will be comfortable doing this. “I wish I had a good answer to how
  people are going to access vaccines in the coming weeks and months,” says
  Ratner. “I guess we will find out more, but it’s a frustrating and confusing
  time for all of us.” What if you want a Covid vaccine but don’t qualify for
  one under the new guidelines? In theory, it is possible for adults who do not
  qualify as high-risk to get off-label prescriptions. But Scott says he
  suspects there’s going to be a lot of hesitation among doctors to “prescribe
  something off-label that they may be liable for”. “Can you go to Canada and
  get it? Yeah, you probably could,” says Ricciardi. “But why would we have to
  go to another country to get vaccinated?” Where can you get a Covid vaccine
  this year? During the 2024-2025 cold and flu season, nearly 90% of people who
  received a Covid shot received it in a pharmacy, according to CDC data. But
  pharmacists aren’t sure what the 2025-2026 season will look like. “Pharmacists
  are a little bit anxious because if the ACIP takes on and recommends the same
  guidelines the FDA has approved, a lot of patients will be unable to get a
  Covid-19 vaccine,” says Allison Hill, the director of professional affairs at
  the American Pharmacists Association. Pharmacy regulations also vary from
  state to state. Some states have their own statutes, while others follow ACIP
  recommendations. And some states allow pharmacists to administer vaccines that
  are off-label, while others do not. This confusing tangle of rules has already
  led two of the country’s biggest pharmacy chains, CVS and Walgreens, to
  severely limit how and where they are providing vaccines. A spokesperson for
  CVS said on Friday that the chain would continue to offer vaccines in 34
  states, require prescriptions to administer them in 13 states and the District
  of Columbia, and stop offering Covid vaccines altogether in Massachusetts,
  Nevada and New Mexico. The spokesperson said this was a result of “the current
  regulatory environment”, and that the lists “may change at any time”. Patients
  may be able to get vaccines at their doctor’s office, but that’s not
  guaranteed. Even if someone is at high risk, getting a prescription for a
  vaccine may not be easy. “In the US, a lot of people don’t have insurance,”
  says Scott. “And a lot of people who have insurance don’t have primary care
  doctors, and they don’t get much medical attention.” Requiring people to jump
  through hoops will only further deter people from getting vaccines, says Hill.
  “We know that patients, when they come into the pharmacy and you talk to them
  about a vaccine, they really need to get that vaccine then and there,” she
  says. “If you have to wait on a prescription, you lose the patient.”
