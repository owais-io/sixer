  Donald Trump has said he did not know a raid by the FBI on the home of his
  former adviser turned critic, John Bolton, was planned and that he expected to
  be briefed by the justice department on it. “I tell the group I don’t want to
  know, but just you have to do what you have to do. I don’t want to know about
  it,” Trump said, adding “I’m not a fan of John Bolton. He’s a real sort of a
  lowlife. He’s not a smart guy. But he could be very unpatriotic. I’m going to
  find out.” JD Vance denied the raid was politically motivated. “We don’t think
  that we should throw people – even if they disagree with us politically, maybe
  especially if they disagree with us politically – you shouldn’t throw people
  willy-nilly in prison,” the vice-president told NBC. “You should let the law
  drive these determinations, and that’s what we’re doing.” Here are the key
  Trump administration news stories of the day: FBI raids home of Trump’s
