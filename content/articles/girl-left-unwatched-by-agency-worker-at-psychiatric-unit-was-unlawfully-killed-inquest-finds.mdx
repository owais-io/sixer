  A vulnerable 14-year-old girl was unlawfully killed when an agency support
  worker failed to keep her under observation at a secure psychiatric unit, an
  inquest jury has concluded. The worker, who used a false identity, left Ruth
  Szymankiewicz alone even though she had complex mental health issues and was
  judged to need constant watching because she was a suicide risk. Ruth was able
  to slip back to her room and harmed herself at the privately run Huntercombe
  hospital near Maidenhead on 12 February 2022. She died two days later. During
  the inquest it emerged that the worker, who went under the stolen identity Ebo
  Acheampong, had never worked at any hospital before the day he was put in
  charge of observing Ruth and did not receive an induction before his shift.
  The jury at Beaconsfield raised concerns about training of agency staff at
  Huntercombe and said contributing factors to Ruth’s death included her not
  being prevented from accessing the material she used to harm herself. She did
  not receive therapy that may have helped while she was being detained under
  the Mental Health Act, family visits were limited though they may have helped
  her wellbeing and she was able to access harmful material on her phone, the
  jury heard. Speaking after the jury returned its findings, Ruth’s parents,
  Kate and Mark Szymankiewicz, who are respectively a GP and a consultant
  surgeon from Wiltshire, said: “There is an empty space at our table, a silent
  bedroom in our home, a gaping hole in our family that will never be filled.
  “Ruth was an incredible, bright, friendly, loving and adventurous girl with a
  whole life of joy ahead of her. She, like many other teenagers, developed an
  eating disorder. “When, at our most vulnerable as a family, we reached out for
  help, we ultimately found ourselves trapped in a system that was meant to care
  for her, to help her, to keep her safe, but instead locked her away and harmed
  her. As a child who thrived on her connection with nature, she was essentially
  caged. “Over the last two weeks, we have heard about the numerous systemic
  failures at Huntercombe hospital,” the family said. “It would be easy to be
  distracted by the failings of one individual. However shocking that conduct
  might have been, it is paramount that the other wider and more important
  issues are acknowledged and addressed.” Health experts told the Guardian that
  many of the issues around the use of agency staff and the shortage of
  psychiatric intensive care units for children and young people was still a
  huge problem. Andrew Molodynski, the British Medical Association’s mental
  health lead, said there was a “gap in accountability” over the training and
  vetting of agency staff. He said it was often mental health inpatient units,
  with the most high-risk individuals, that relied on agency staff the most,
  especially when they had patients like Ruth needing one-to-one supervision. He
  said this was a “toxic catch-22 … You end up with very few people who know the
  ward and know the patients”. Minesh Patel, an associate director of policy and
  campaigns at the mental health charity Mind, said Ruth’s case was “a clearcut
  example of the many systemic issues in our mental health hospitals”. He said:
  “An overreliance on agency staff can compromise patient safety, quality of
  care, and in the worst cases lead to serious harm or loss of life.” During the
  inquest, Dr Gillian Combe, the clinical director for the provider group that
  commissioned Ruth’s placement, said the understaffing seen at Huntercombe
  still existed. She expressed frustration at rules in England that make it hard
  for new NHS units to be built, meaning provider groups have to rely on sending
  patients to private units. Combe said this situation arose after Andrew
  Lansley’s changes to the NHS – described by some as “creeping privatisation” –
  when he was the health secretary from 2010 to 2012. She said there were no
  psychiatric intensive care units for children and young people in the whole of
  south-west England. Jodie Anderson, a senior caseworker at the charity
  Inquest, said: “The jury’s findings are a stark indictment of a mental health
  system that sent a vulnerable child far from home to a private unit with
  dangerously inadequate care.” Dr Amit Chatterjee, the chief medical officer at
  Active Care Group, which owned and ran Huntercombe, told the inquest that the
  company had worked hard to improve recruitment and its induction process.
  Huntercombe has closed but Chatterjee said the company had increased
  therapeutic care at its current site for young people, Ivetsey Bank hospital
  in Staffordshire. The inquest heard that after learning that Ruth had died,
  the worker known as Acheampong fled from the UK to Ghana. Thames Valley police
  said they knew his real identity but did not have enough evidence to try to
  get him back. The use of agency staff in mental health settings has been cited
  as a big problem in numerous reviews and inquest conclusions. In the case of
  Lily Lucas, a 28-year-old woman who died in 2022 from excessive fluid intake
  brought on by schizophrenia, an NHS review found that some agency nurses on
  her privately run ward did not know how to use 999. A Care Quality Commission
  report on the Mental Health Act said patients had described agency staff as
  “not friendly” and “less caring” towards patients, and detrimental to morale
  among permanent staff. In the UK, the youth suicide prevention charity Papyrus
