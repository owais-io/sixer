  Postal services in Europe suspend parcel shipments to US amid uncertainty over
  tariffs

  Postal services across Europe have suspended most parcel shipments to the US,
  citing widespread uncertainty about the impact of new import tariffs announced
  by Donald Trump. France’s La Poste on Monday joined other operators, including
  Germany’s Deutsche Post, Spain’s Correos, Poste Italiane and the Belgian,
  Swedish and Danish postal services, which all halted a majority of US-bound
  shipments over the weekend. Austria’s Österreichische Post and the UK’s Royal
  Mail said they would stop accepting packages on Tuesday, to allow enough time
  for packages posted before then to arrive in the US before the tariffs,
  scheduled to come into force at the end of August, kick in. The US president
  last month signed an executive order abolishing from 29 August a tax exemption
  that allowed small packages worth less than $800 – the preferred option for
  many small European businesses – to enter the US duty-free. A total of 1.36bn
  packages were sent last year under the so-called “de minimis” exemption,
  containing goods worth $64.6bn, according to US Customs, but such parcels will
  now face a 15% tariff – the same rate as most other imports from the EU.
  Analysts have said that the regulatory changes, if they are maintained, are
  likely to have a considerable impact, particularly on small and medium-sized
  European companies exporting lower-value goods to the US. European postal
  services said they would continue to ship letters and parcels sent by
  individuals containing gifts worth less than €100, but warned that these would
  be subject to extra checks to prevent the service being used for commercial
  goods. The operators blamed widespread uncertainty about how the new tariffs
  would work, as well as a lack of time to prepare. “Key questions remain,
  particularly regarding who will have to pay the tariffs and how, what
  additional data will be required, and how data will be transmitted to US
  Customs,” said DHL, Europe’s largest logistics company, which owns Deutsche
  Post. The company said it was no longer “accepting or transporting parcels and
  postal items containing goods from business customers destined for the US”. La
  Poste, which sends 1.6m packages on average to the US each year, 80% of them
  from businesses and 20% from individuals, said the new rules had been
  confirmed by US authorities only on 15 August. The late announcement had left
  European postal services with “an extremely limited timeframe to get prepared.
  Moreover, the rules’ related documentation still requires further
  clarification,” the French operator said. Poste Italiane said it had been
  “forced to temporarily suspend acceptance of all shipments containing
  merchandise destined for the US”. The Nordic logistics company PostNord said
  the the pause was “unfortunate but necessary”. The Dutch postal service,
  PostNL, said the Trump administration was pressing ahead with the new duties
  despite US authorities lacking a system to collect them, while Royal Mail said
  it hoped the interruption would last only a few days. PostEurop, an
  association of 51 European public postal operators, said that if no practical
  solutions could be found before 29 August, it was likely that all its members
  would suspend the bulk of parcel shipments to the US. With Agence-France
