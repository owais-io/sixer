  Confucius Institutes at universities across England are under threat from new
  free speech rules, setting off urgent talks between ministers,
  vice-chancellors and regulators over the fate of the China-backed language and
  culture centres. Universities fear that the new regulations imposed by the
  Office for Students (OfS) this month will cause legal headaches with their
  Chinese partners, including the government in Beijing, and could lead to some
  being closed. University leaders claim they have been left in the dark by
  England’s regulator over whether or not they are breaking the new rules, which
  bar foreign governments from vetting staff employed at the institutes. The 20
  Confucius Institutes operating in England – including at the universities of
  Manchester, Coventry and Liverpool – are partnerships between each university,
  a Chinese university, and an arm of the Chinese state that provides funding.
  They offer Mandarin classes and promote cultural events but critics allege
  they also act as a Trojan horse within the education system. The Department
  for Education (DfE) said it “welcomed a range of international partnerships
  with UK higher education” but that they had to comply with UK laws and
  regulations. “It is for individual higher education providers to assess
  whether the criteria of existing arrangements would have the effect of
  restricting free speech and take steps to address that,” the DfE said. Jacqui
  Smith, the skills minister, said the government wanted to ensure that
  universities were “places of rigorous debate” for all views. Smith said: “Any
  attempt by a foreign state to intimidate, harass or harm individuals in the UK
  will not be tolerated. The government has robust measures in place to prevent
  this activity, including updated powers and offences through the National
  Security Act. “We are also working directly with the Office for Students to
  support universities in safeguarding free speech and tackling any form of
  harassment on campus.” A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in London said:
  “Confucius Institutes are non-profit educational institutions jointly
  established by China and foreign countries. They serve as a bridge for people
  around the world to learn the Chinese language and better understand China.
  “In the UK, Confucius Institutes are established at the voluntary request of
  British universities, through partnerships with Chinese institutions based on
  the principles of mutual respect, friendly consultation, equality, and mutual
  benefit. The Confucius Institutes in the UK have always operated in a lawful,
  open and transparent manner. They have helped students and local communities
  learn Chinese, and have been well received by students, parents and the
  general public.” The new guidance is likely to force the universities to
  rewrite agreements with the institutes or face sanctions for breaching the
  OfS’s free speech regulations in England, particularly new rules that punish
  universities involved with “a foreign-funded institute [that] imposes an
  ideological test” as a condition of employment. One critical group, UK-China
  Transparency, says Chinese staff applying to work in the institutes have been
  asked to provide references to their “political attitude” and be vetted by a
  committee of China’s ruling Communist party. A spokesperson for the OfS said:
  “Where universities or colleges enter into agreements with any country, they
  must ensure that they continue to uphold freedom of speech within the law and
  academic freedom. Where they cannot do this, they should immediately take all
  necessary steps to amend or terminate the agreement. “Our guidance is clear,
  for example, that the imposition of any kind of ideological test as a
  condition of employment would be unacceptable.” Several universities contacted
  by the Guardian declined to comment publicly. But university leaders said they
  have asked the OfS for more time to investigate and negotiate with their
  partners. A spokesperson for the OfS said: “Any institution not meeting their
  free speech obligations should take urgent action.” A spokesperson for
  Lancaster University said: “Lancaster University is fully committed to
  upholding the right to freedom of speech for all staff and students. Along
  with our sector colleagues, we are carefully considering if there are any
  potential implications in the new guidance for our Confucius Institute, which
  plays an important role in our internationally diverse academic community.”
  One university said that the situation was complicated by the OfS refusing to
  indicate which arrangements would be allowed under the new regulations. A
  spokesperson for Universities UK, which represents vice-chancellors, said: “UK
  universities are committed to upholding free speech and academic freedom. They
  work hard to protect these fundamental freedoms and meet significant legal
  duties in this area set out by the Office for Students. “This commitment
  extends to the partnerships universities have with institutions around the
  world, which bring important economic and social benefits to the UK.” • This

  in London that was provided after publication.
