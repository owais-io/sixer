  Francis Ford Coppola, the veteran American Italian film-maker behind The
  Godfather and Apocalypse Now, underwent a non-emergency medical procedure in
  Rome, according to his representative, who disputed earlier reports that he
  had suffered a mild cardiac arrhythmia. “Mr Coppola went in for a scheduled
  update procedure with acclaimed Dr Andrea Natale, his doctor of over 30 years,
  and is resting nicely,” the representative said in response to Italian media
  reports that the director was hospitalised, adding “all is well.” Coppola
  himself posted a message on Instagram after, writing to his followers: “Da
  Dada (what my kids call me) is fine, taking an opportunity while in Rome to do
  the update of my 30-year-old afib procedure with its inventor, a great Italian
  doctor — Dr Andrea Natale! I am well!” Local media had reported that Coppola,
  86, was admitted to Policlinico Tor Vergata, a public hospital, on Tuesday
  morning for an operation related to heart issues that had long been scheduled,
  but had experienced a mild cardiac arrhythmia before the operation and doctors
  had placed him under observation. However his representative specifically
  disputed these reports as “not true.” “There was not an emergency. He went to
  the hospital in a car,” the US representative said. The Oscar winner is a
  frequent visitor to Italy, and in mid-July attended the Magna Graecia film
  festival in the southern Italian region of Calabria to present his latest
  film, Megalopolis. He had also been spending time scouting for locations in
  Italy for a new production due to begin filming in the autumn, Ansa reported.
  On Friday, Coppola completed a six-city US tour to promote Megalopolis,
  according to Hollywood Reporter. It is unclear when he returned to Italy.
  Speaking to the audience at the film festival in Calabria, Coppola, the winner
  of five Oscars, said: “Young people say the world is a disaster, but I reply
  that there is no problem man can’t solve.” Megalopolis, his sci-fi epic
  starring Adam Driver, cost $120m that was largely funded through the sale of
  his vineyards. But reviews have been mixed, with the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw
  calling it a “bloated, boring and bafflingly shallow film”. Coppola, however,
  appeared to have no regrets about his passion project. He said: “There are
  many people, when they die, they say: ‘Oh, I wish I had done this, I wish I
  had done that’. But when I die, I’m going to say: ‘I’ve got to do this and
  I’ve got to see my daughter win an Oscar and I’ve got to make wine and I’ve
  got to make every movie I wanted to make.” The director, whose wife, Eleanor,
  died in April last year, added: “And I’m going to be so busy thinking of all
  the things that I’ve got to do that when I die, I won’t notice it.” With
