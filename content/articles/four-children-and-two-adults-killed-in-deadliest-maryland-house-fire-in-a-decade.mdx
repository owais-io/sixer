  A fire killed four children and two adults after ripping through a house in
  Charles county, Maryland, on Sunday, authorities said. Oliver Alkire, the
  master deputy state fire marshal, told reporters that the blaze was the
  deadliest fire in Maryland in more than 10 years. “The house was built in a
  year when they should’ve had hard-wired smoke alarms. I can’t confirm if they
  were actually activated. One person managed to escape the fire reported at
  about 8.40am at the home in Waldorf, about 55 miles (88km) south of Baltimore,
  the local news outlet WTOP reported. It took about 70 firefighters more than
  an hour to control the flames. One firefighter was hospitalized and another
  first responder was treated at the scene for unspecified injuries. The cause
  of the fire was under investigation. Alkire said the blaze originated on the
  right side of the home within an enclosed porch. The ages and names of the
  victims were not immediately released. Alkire said officials didn’t
  immediately know if the residence had working smoke alarms and reminded the
  public to make sure their homes were equipped with such devices. “We have no
  reports of someone hearing a smoke alarm activating, so it just shows you the
  importance of how important those life-saving devices are,” Alkire said. The
  Associated Press contributed reporting
