  We’re closing this blog now, here is a recap of the day’s main developments:
  The Palestinian Authority on Saturday lambasted the Israeli government’s
  decision to expand its military operations in Gaza, as it called on the
  international community to push for the entry of aid into the strip. Muslim
  nations must work in total unison and work to mobilise the international
  community against Israel’s plan to take control of Gaza City, Turkish Foreign
  Minister Hakan Fidan said on Saturday after talks in Egypt. The UK has
  announced another £8.5 million for UN aid to Gaza after Israel unveiled plans
  to expand its military operations in the territory. Development minister
  Baroness Jenny Chapman said the money would “help address urgent need” in
  Gaza, but only if Israel allowed the region to be “flooded with aid”. Five
  Lebanese soldiers were killed in a blast on Saturday while removing munitions
  from a Hezbollah military facility in south Lebanon, a military source told
  AFP. Iran’s judiciary said Saturday it was investigating the cases of 20
  people arrested over their suspected links with Israel following the 12-day
  war between the two arch-foes. Russia condemns and rejects Israel’s plan to
  expand its military operation in the Gaza Strip, Russia’s Foreign Ministry
  said on Saturday. “The implementation of such decisions and plans, which
  provoke condemnation and rejection, is fraught with the risk of exacerbating
  the already extremely dramatic situation in the Palestinian enclave, which has
  all the hallmarks of a humanitarian catastrophe,” the ministry said in a
  statement. The explosion in southern Lebanon which killed six soldiers was
  caused by “remnants of the Israeli war” in the coastal city, security sources
  told Reuters. The Lebanese army said on Saturday that the soldiers were killed
  and others wounded in an explosion while they were inspecting a weapons depot
  and dismantling its contents in the city of Tyre. An investigation was
  underway to determine the cause of the blast, the army added in a statement.
  The Palestinian Authority on Saturday lambasted the Israeli government’s
  decision to expand its military operations in Gaza, as it called on the
  international community to push for the entry of aid into the strip. According
  to the official Palestinian news agency Wafa, the PA’s presidential spokesman
  Nabil Abu Rudeineh said the Israeli government’s moves were “an unprecedented
  challenge and provocation to the international will to achieve peace and
  stability”. He also called on the “international community, led by the UN
  Security Council, to urgently compel the occupying state to cease its
  aggression, allow the entry of aid, and work diligently to enable the State of
  Palestine to assume its full responsibilities in the Gaza Strip”, reported
  Wafa. Early Friday, the Israeli security cabinet approved plans to launch
  major operations to seize Gaza City, triggering a wave of outrage across the
  globe. Iran opposes the Lebanese government’s decision to disarm Tehran-backed
  militant group Hezbollah, a senior adviser to supreme leader Ayatollah
  Khamenei said on Saturday, the Tasnim news agency reported. “The Islamic
  Republic of Iran is certainly opposed to the disarmament of Hezbollah,”
  international affairs adviser Ali Akbar Velayati said. “Iran has always
  supported the people and the resistance of Lebanon and continues to do so.”
  Five Lebanese soldiers were killed in a blast on Saturday while removing
  munitions from a Hezbollah military facility in south Lebanon, a military
  source told AFP. Under a November truce that ended a recent war between Israel
  and Iran-backed Hezbollah, the army has been deploying in south Lebanon and
  dismantling the militant group’s infrastructure there. “Five soldiers were
  killed in an explosion... inside a Hezbollah military facility,” the source
  said, requesting anonymity as they were not authorised to brief the media. The
  blast erupted as the troops were “removing munitions and unexploded ordnance
  left over from the recent war” between Israel and Hezbollah, the source said.
  Iran’s judiciary said Saturday it was investigating the cases of 20 people
  arrested over their suspected links with Israel following the 12-day war
  between the two arch-foes. “These cases were immediately filed under the
  supervision of the esteemed investigators and are being investigated,”
  Judiciary spokesman Asghar Jahangir told reporters in Tehran, adding that
  further information would be shared as it became available. Iran’s
  intelligence agency said in late July that it had identified and arrested “20
  spies, Mossad operational and support agents, and elements connected to the
  regime’s (Israel’s) intelligence officers in Tehran” as well as several other
  provinces. In mid-June, Israel launched an unprecedented bombing campaign
  against Iran, triggering a war during which Iran responded with missile and
  drone strikes. Muslim nations must work in total unison and work to mobilise
  the international community against Israel’s plan to take control of Gaza
  City, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said on Saturday after talks in
  Egypt. Speaking at a joint press conference in El Alamein with his Egyptian
  counterpart after meeting Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Fidan also
  said the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation had been called to an emergency
  meeting. The UK has announced another £8.5 million for UN aid to Gaza after
  Israel unveiled plans to expand its military operations in the territory.
  Development minister Baroness Jenny Chapman said the money would “help address
  urgent need” in Gaza, but only if Israel allowed the region to be “flooded
  with aid”. She said: It is unacceptable that so much aid is waiting at the
  border - the UK is ready to provide more through our partners, and we demand
  that the government of Israel allows more aid in safely and securely. The
  insufficient amount of supplies getting through is causing appalling and
  chaotic scenes as desperate civilians try to access tiny amounts of aid. The
  money, to be delivered through the UN’s Office for the Co-ordination of
  Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), is part of a £101 million UK commitment to the
  Occupied Palestinian Territories this year. OCHA has warned of widespread
  hunger among Gaza‘s 2.1 million people, along with difficulties accessing
  water amid a severe heatwave and “significant impediments and other delays” to
  UN efforts to provide aid. Here are some of the lates images coming out of
  Gaza as the war continues: Several Arab and Muslim countries on Saturday
  condemned as a “dangerous escalation” Israel’s plan to take control of Gaza
  City. Some 20 countries, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, said the
  plan constituted “a flagrant violation of international law, and an attempt to
  entrench the illegal occupation and impose a fait accompli... in contravention
  of international legitimacy”. The US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, has
  launched an undiplomatic attack on Keir Starmer by invoking the allied second
  world war bombing of Dresden after the British prime minister criticised the
  Israeli security cabinet’s decision to expand the war in Gaza. “So Israel is
  expected to surrender to Hamas &amp; feed them even though Israeli hostages
  are being starved?” Huckabee wrote on social media in response to a post by
  Starmer calling for an immediate ceasefire and lamenting the humanitarian
  crisis in Gaza, as well as the fate of the remaining Israeli hostages being
  held by Hamas. Provocatively, Huckabee added: “Did UK surrender to Nazis and
  drop food to them? “Ever heard of Dresden, PM Starmer? That wasn’t food you
  dropped. If you had been PM then UK would be speaking German!” Read the full
  report here: The US and UK have “disagreements” on Gaza including over whether
  to recognise a Palestinian state, JD Vance has suggested as he arrived in
  England for his summer holiday. The US vice-president was speaking before a
  bilateral meeting with David Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, at his
  17th-century grace-and-favour country house, Chevening. His remarks on Gaza
  marked a note of discord in what otherwise appeared to be a convivial meeting
  between the two politicians, who have struck up an unlikely friendship. The
  pair have bonded over their Christian faith and difficult childhoods. The
  vice-president says that, unlike Britain, the White House has no plans to
  recognise the Palestinian state. Read the full report here: US President
  Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff met Qatar’s prime minister
  Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani on Saturday in Ibiza, Spain to
  discuss a plan to end the war in Gaza and release hostages, Axios reporter
  Barak Ravid said on X. Microsoft is investigating how Israel’s military
  surveillance agency, Unit 8200, is using its Azure cloud storage platform,
  amid concerns the company’s staff in Israel may have concealed key details
  about its work on sensitive military projects. Senior executives are
  scrambling to assess what data Unit 8200 holds in Azure after a Guardian
  investigation revealed how the spy agency has used the cloud platform to store
  a vast collection of intercepted Palestinian mobile phone calls. The joint
  investigation with the Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and
  Hebrew-language outlet Local Call found Unit 8200 has used a customised and
  segregated area within Azure to store recordings of millions of calls made
  each day in Gaza and the West Bank. There are concerns that the tech company’s
  Israel-based staff may have concealed key details of work, read the full piece
  here: Gaza’s civil defence agency said at least 10 people were killed across
  the Palestinian territory on Saturday, including civilians who were waiting to
  collect aid. Civil defence spokesperson Mahmud Bassal told AFP that at least
  six people were killed and 30 wounded after Israeli troops targeted civilians
  assembling near an aid point in central Gaza. It comes after, early Friday,
  the Israeli security cabinet approved plans to launch major operations to
  seize Gaza City, triggering a wave of outrage across the globe. Despite the
  backlash and rumours of dissent from Israeli military top brass, prime
  minister Benjamin Netanyahu remained defiant over the decision. In a post on
  social media late Friday, Netanyahu said “we are not going to occupy Gaza - we
  are going to free Gaza from Hamas”. Netanyahu faces mounting pressure to
  secure a ceasefire to bring the territory’s more than two million people back
  from the brink of famine and free the hostages held by Palestinian militants.
  Meanwhile: The worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza and Israel’s plans to
  expand military control over the enclave have pushed Germany to curb arms
  exports to Israel, a historically fraught step for Berlin driven by a growing
  public outcry. Conservative Chancellor Friedrich Merz, hitherto a staunchly
  pro-Israel leader, made the announcement on Friday arguing that Israel’s
  actions would not achieve its stated war goals of eliminating Hamas militants
  or bringing Israeli hostages home. The UN Security Council announced an
  emergency meeting on Israel’s plans was rescheduled to 10am EDT on Sunday (3pm
  BST) after originally being scheduled to take place at 3pm EDT (8pm BST) on
  Saturday. The UN Mission of Panama, which holds the council presidency this
  month, provided no details, but Saturday is the Jewish Sabbath and Israel is
  certain to want to speak at the meeting. The efforts for a new ceasefire have
  the backing of major Arab Gulf monarchies, according to two officials who
  spoke to AP anonymously due to the sensitivity of the discussions. One is
  involved directly in the deliberations and the second was briefed on the
  efforts. The monarchies are concerned about further regional destabilisation
  if Israel fully reoccupies Gaza, the officials said. A senior Hamas official,
  speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorised to brief the
  media, said the group has yet to receive details on the latest efforts to
  revive ceasefire talks.
