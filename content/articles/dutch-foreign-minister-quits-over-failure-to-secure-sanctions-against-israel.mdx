  The Dutch foreign minister, Caspar Veldkamp, has resigned after a cabinet
  meeting failed to secure sanctions against Israel, weakening the Netherlands’
  already fragile caretaker government. Veldkamp’s colleagues from the centrist
  New Social Contract (NSC) party also walked out after the cabinet debate late
  on Friday reached an impasse over adopting harsher measures against Israel.
  The discussions about taking further steps against Israel came after the
  Netherlands joined 20 other countries in signing a joint declaration on
  Thursday condemning Israeli plans to build an illegal settlement in the
  occupied West Bank. Critics say the 3,400-home settlement would split the
  territory in half. The Netherlands barred the far-right Israeli ministers
  Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich from entering the country in July. After
  Friday’s meeting, Veldkamp – a former ambassador to Israel – told the Dutch
  news agency ANP he was “insufficiently able to take meaningful additional
  measures”. In a statement announcing his resignation, he said “we are living
  in a time of unprecedented geopolitical tension, where diplomacy matters more
  than ever”. Backing his stance, the NSC said its coalition partners, the
  centre-right People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) and the populist
  Farmer-Citizen Movement (BBB), “refuse to acknowledge the alarming situation
  [in Gaza] and take necessary action”. There have been a number of protests in
  the Netherlands to pressure the government to take action against Israel’s war
  in Gaza, which is nearing its two-year mark. Between 100,000 and 150,000
  people took part in a demonstration in The Hague in June, making it the
  largest protest in the Netherlands in two decades. Veldkamp’s resignation came
  after UN-backed experts said on Friday that Gaza City and the surrounding area
  was in the grip of an “entirely man-made” famine, and that deaths could rise
  exponentially. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) has
  only declared four famines since it was established in 2004, most recently in
  Sudan last year. The NSC wwas part of a caretaker administration that has been
  running the Netherlands since June, when the coalition government collapsed
  after the far-right politician Geert Wilders withdrew his party’s ministers
  from the alliance. The PVV’s withdrawal from the coalition in June triggered
  an early election, with a snap poll called for 29 October.
