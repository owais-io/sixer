  We are thick in an era of retail simulators. In the comet-trail of Stardew
  Valley, a genre is now fat with titles wherein a protagonist restarts their
  life and career in a bucolic, quasi-rural landscape and undertakes a
  blue-collar job. They get to know the local people, interfere in some lives,
  solve some community issues – maybe even a mystery or two. Maybe even get
  married. In a way, they are all Harvest Moon’s pixelated offspring – but
  Discounty, Crinkle Cut Games’ new offering to the genre, tackles the cozy shop
  life simulator a little differently. In Discounty, you are taken in by your
  tricky, cantankerous aunt and are put to work in her branch of a franchised
  supermarket. A fascinating approach, given that the road less taken through
  Stardew Valley involves prioritising the growth of a local supermarket rather
  than a community centre. Discounty is a game about business and injecting the
  economy of a small town. For a cozy game, there are elements of it that are
  very sharp indeed. The supermarket-building aspect of the game is satisfying.
  You purchase stock, lay it out on the shop floor, open up and let the
  customers buy their groceries. The till system initially operates like a
  tricky little basic maths puzzle, though this evolves in an interesting manner
  later on. Speed is paramount: don’t let the customers get grumpy, make sure
  the shelves are stocked, the floor is clean, things are ticking over. It’s
  very work-heavy, very intense – then the shop closes, you exhale, mop up the
  shop floor and trundle home to the funny little trailer you live in outside
  your aunt’s big, lush home. Aunt Tellar is a fascinating businesswoman, full
  of ambition – a rare, non-benevolent mentor figure. She has disagreements with
  the local people that you have to fix. She does, in fact, fire someone so you
  can come on board and take their job. This gradient of tone is really
  refreshing: the game isn’t clean and cutesy. It’s about operating a
  supermarket, not running away to a magical farm. The graphics are also a
  little deceptive: while you might be initially tricked into thinking the game
  is very pure and sweet by the pixel art, the town you move into is ragged.
  There is a bleak docklands. Many shop-fronts are shuttered, posters rot on the
  walls. These details are fantastic – reminiscent at times of Eastward. The
  music, too, is worth a note: ambient and pleasing. The details of this work
  aren’t skipped over in favour of curating a twee, relaxing vibe. Conferring
  with the local people does involve some solving of local issues, but also
  brokering supplier deals. Sometimes this requires a little massaging on your
  part, due to your aunt’s tricky nature. It’s high responsibility, high focus.
  Occasionally, the controls are a little fiddly: I found the touch-screen
  option on the Steam Deck a little unfocused. The initial stages of the game
  where you are setting up your stock and don’t have a huge amount of options
  are a little stressful, especially if you find the sight of basic sums on a
  calculator to be hard work. However, the resistance isn’t too high: I’m
  impressed by the way in which the challenge softens, while the intensity of
  each day at work notches up. Discounty is a valuable addition to the sorority
  of cozy, slice of life with a dream-job games. It goes a little against the
  grain, while still managing to hold your focus. While there is not a lot of
  romance in running away from your life to work in a supermarket, there is
  certainly a lot of good clean work to do, which still manages to feel like
  play. • Discounty is out now on PC, PS5, Switch and Xbox, £14
