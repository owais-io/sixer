  Rushanara Ali has resigned as homelessness minister for England after it
  emerged she evicted four tenants from a property she owns then re-let it weeks
  later for £700 more a month. The tenants were told in November last year their
  fixed-term contract would not be renewed because Ali’s east London home was
  being put up for sale. Shortly after they left the property, they discovered
  it had returned to the market with the monthly rent increased from £3,300 to
  £4,000, the i Paper first reported. Ali announced her resignation on Wednesday
  evening after hours of intense criticism from housing charities and opposition
  parties. She had been under pressure to explain the contradiction between the
  stated reason for ending the tenancy and the decision to re-let the home at a
  higher price after no buyer was found. In a letter to Keir Starmer, the Labour
  MP said she had “at all times” followed “all legal requirements” and taken her
  responsibilities “seriously”. But she added: “It is clear that continuing in
  my role will be a distraction from the ambitious work of the government. I
  have therefore decided to resign from my ministerial position.” In response,
  the prime minister thanked Ali for her “diligent work” at the Ministry of
  Housing, Communities and Local Government, saying it would have “a lasting
  impact”. Starmer swiftly responded to her resignation letter and said: “I know
  you will continue to support the government from the backbenches and represent
  the best interests of your constituents in Bethnal Green and Stepney.” Ali had
  been widely criticised for apparent hypocrisy. She has spoken out against
  private renters being exploited and said the Labour government would “empower
  people to challenge unreasonable rent increases”. The renters’ rights bill,
  which is due to come into force next year, will ban landlords who have ended a
  tenancy in order to sell a property from relisting it for a higher rent. The
  bill will also end the use of fixed-term tenancies. Kevin Hollinrake, the
  Conservative party chair, accused Starmer of presiding over “a government of
  hypocrisy and self-service”. He said: “It is right that Rushanara Ali has now
  quit the government following our calls for her to go. “Keir Starmer promised
  a government of integrity but has instead presided over a government of
  hypocrisy and self-service. Once again it’s one rule for Labour and one for
  everyone else. “With a fourth minister now having to step down in disgrace, it
  is clear the British public deserve so much better than the endless sleaze and
  scandal of this Labour government.” Peter Wishart, the Scottish National
  party’s deputy leader at Westminster, said earlier on Thursday: “Once this
  shameful story broke, Labour’s homelessness minister should have immediately
  resigned.” Jess Barnard, a former chair of Young Labour and a member of
  Labour’s national executive committee, said: “Seems an appropriate time to
  reiterate MPs should not be landlords and landlords should not be Labour MPs.”
  Mairi MacRae, the director of campaigns and policy at Shelter, said: “It
  beggars belief that after months of dither and delay, the government’s own
  homelessness minister has profited from the underhand tactics the renters’
  rights bill is meant to outlaw. “This story serves as a damning reminder that
  the cards are fundamentally stacked against renters. Unscrupulous landlords
  cannot be allowed to continue the practice of ‘fire-and-rehire’ evictions,
  where they slap renters with a section 21 only to hike up the rent a few
  months later and relet the property at a higher price.” A spokesperson for Ali
  said on Thursday afternoon: “The tenants stayed for the entirety of their
  fixed-term contract and were informed they could stay beyond the expiration of
  the fixed term while the property remained on the market, but this was not
  taken up and they decided to leave the property.” It is understood that after
  an end-of-tenancy inventory was carried out, the managing agent requested
  payment from the tenants to cover the costs of repairs. This was not
  authorised by Ali and was cancelled after she intervened. The house, near
  Ali’s Bethnal Green and Stepney constituency, is listed for sale at £894,995.
  The property was reportedly put up for sale last November and the price was
  reduced in February. • The headline of this article was amended on 13 August
  2025. An earlier version said that Rushanara Ali was UK homelessness minister
  when her remit covered only England.
