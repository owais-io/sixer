  Marriott Bonvoy® American Express® Card (Representative 53.3% APR Variable,
  Annual fee applies, 18+, Subject to status, terms and conditions apply) For
  most of us, taking pictures of a gleaming paella, Vietnamese pho or a display
  of lavender macarons is a huge part of being on holiday. Looking at the shots
  on our phone screens brings back not just the memory of a taste, but the
  place, the time, a soundtrack of conversations and emotions of that particular
  moment, a sensory souvenir of that pastel de nata in Belém or the crispy, wavy
  filo on the delicious spanakopita – the classic Greek spinach and cheese pie –
  at my friend Orfeas’s home on Cephalonia. As a travel writer, food underlies
  so much of what I write about since it opens up the culture and history of a
  destination through local ingredients, preparation and cultivation. The photos
  represent a nostalgic trip back to the people I met and their stories. My
  dream travel experience, essentially, is discovering gastronomic gems and
  taking shots of the food, tucked-away restaurants and fresh produce markets I
  encounter along the way. Jon Bryant: ‘Food opens up the culture and history of
  a destination through local ingredients, preparation and cultivation’.
  Photographs: Rebecca Marshall/The Guardian And I’m not alone in my enthusiasm
  – food, particularly sampling the local cuisine, is an important consideration
  for many holidaymakers. And if you have a Marriott Bonvoy American Express
  Card you can gather points while savouring local dishes on your gastronomic
  adventures. Cardmembers earn two points for every £1 spent using the Card,
  which can then be redeemed at hotels participating in Marriott Bonvoy on
  future stays and dining, adding more new dinner experiences to your list. My
  favourite food destination is Genoa and the Ligurian coast in northern Italy.
  The city, renowned for its pesto and panissa, has an Eataly food hall in the
  revamped port with huge racks of tomato paste, farinata, pasta and cheese.
  Down on Via XX Settembre, one of the main thoroughfares in the centre of the
  city, is the Mercato Orientale, a fresh produce market with glistening fish
  and stacks of artichokes. A little farther down the boulevard is the Cremeria
  Gran Sasso ice-cream parlour, safekeeping its fior di latte and fruity gelato
  inside steel canisters. Sometimes you stumble across a restaurant on your way
  to somewhere else. In Genoa, I was heading to the Castello D’Albertis on a
  hill above the city and came across Osteria Carabàs on Vico Tana. The tiny
  restaurant serves the most amazing Ligurian cuisine, such as homemade trofie
  al pesto, tuna seared with a pistachio crust, and black spaghetti with
  seafood. Meanwhile, at the AC Hotel Genova, you can enjoy beautiful views as
  the sun goes down during dinner on the terrace. Enjoy top regional dining at
  the AC Hotel Bologna and AC Hotel Genova Head inland, travelling east to
  Bologna, for more photogenic local produce and aromatic snack bars. Stay at
  the AC Hotel Bologna, just a few blocks from the Trattoria di Via Serra – a
  great place to experience Bologna’s superlative pasta dishes. Back at the
  hotel, perks include a free fitness centre and meeting rooms for business
  travellers, plus Marriott Bonvoy® American Express® Cardmembers will quickly
  amass points during their stay. Cardmembers gain six points for every £1 spent
  at hotels participating in Marriott Bonvoy, which can go towards room upgrades
  and free stays for their next culinary trip. Across the border in France, Nice
  has developed into one of the country’s foodie hotspots in the last five
  years, with a huge selection of traditional and fusion fare, and eight
  Michelin-starred restaurants. Nice also has a popular cooking school, Les
  Petits Farcis, which offers classes in English and tours of the excellent
  fresh produce market on the Cours Saleya. AC Hotel Marseille Prado Velodrome’s
  on site restaurant offers Mediterranean-inspired dishes. Photograph: Marc
  Rabaux/Studio BaALT Marseille is another French city with a burgeoning food
  scene, renowned for its beloved bouillabaisse (Provençal fish soup). The AC
  Hotel Marseille Prado Velodrome, set alongside Olympique Marseille’s
  futuristic football stadium, is perfectly placed to enjoy the city’s growing
  gastronomic reputation, and also has a restaurant on site, Oh Massalia,
  offering Mediterranean-inspired dishes. Food and photography can offer a deep
  insight into a new city, and I often find myself walking miles during my
  trips, locating food markets, tracking down recommended restaurants, and
  finding the best places to sample the local delicacies. It’s common to eat
  dinner later in France and Italy, than in the UK. For a more relaxed start in
  the morning, your Marriott Bonvoy American Express Card automatically gives
  you Silver Elite status at hotels participating in Marriott Bonvoy, making you
  eligible for Priority Late Checkout (subject to availability). You can upgrade
  to Gold Elite status with even more benefits when you spend £15,000 in a year
  as a Marriott Bonvoy® Amex® Cardmember. Clockwise from top left: the W
  Barcelona and its stylish rooftop pool; Barcelona’s rowdy and colourful Mercat
  de la Boqueria; fresh artichokes in Rome’s Mercato di Testaccio. Photographs:
  Andrea Federici/Shutterstock; Factofoto/Alamy A joy for any photographer is
  always the fresh food markets with their piles of spices, cured sausages,
  cheeses, pastries, and fruit and vegetables. Having drifted through the aisles
  of many of France’s most celebrated halles as well as the English market in
  Cork, Atarazanas in Málaga, Markthal in Rotterdam and Rome’s Mercato di
  Testaccio, the most picturesque is Barcelona’s Mercat de la Boqueria. Packed
  with locals and visitors, it’s rowdy, colourful, majestic and, set in a
  cavernous hall from the 1830s, is enticingly photogenic. Wherever you end up,
  in a few months’ time, you’ll look back at your photos, linger over those
  mouth-watering piles of cheese and pastries, and start planning your next
  food-based adventure. How does the Marriott Bonvoy American Express Card work?
