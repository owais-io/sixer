  It was about seven years ago, in the remote Northern Territory community of
  Imanpa, that Pitjantjatjara artist Julie Anderson first tried her hand at the
  art of tjanpi (wild harvested grass) weaving. “My aunty taught me how to do it
  at her place,” she says. “I didn’t like it at first but she said, ‘Give it a
  go!’ Once I started and learned the steps, I liked it, and now I do it all the
  time.” Born circa 1956 at Victory Downs Station, 300km south of Mparntwe/Alice
  Springs, Anderson once worked as a station hand, cleaner and groundskeeper. It
  wasn’t until she was in her 60s, living in Mparntwe, that her aunt Margaret
  Smith taught her how to weave her first tjanpi basket in 2018. Anderson is now
  living full-time in a renal hostel in Mparntwe and is at her happiest when
  creating: “I have a smile on my face when I’m weaving. I just pick out nice
  colours and weave them to make nice big baskets.” Anderson is one of more than
  400 women in the Tjanpi Desert Weavers, an Indigenous-run social enterprise
  that empowers women across 350,000 sq km of central Australia to earn an
  income through fibre art. When it first started in 1995, the collective’s
  fibre art focused on coiled basket making. It has since expanded to 26 remote
  communities and evolved into more contemporary art and sculptural works,
  exhibited in Australia and around the world. Each tjanpi piece holds stories
  of country, culture and daily life. The often brightly coloured works are
  woven together with raffia, emu feathers, seeds, gumnuts and twine. “Each
  basket or sculpture is more than just an artwork,” the Darwin Aboriginal art
  fair’s artistic director, Simon Carmichael, says of the Tjanpi Desert Weavers.
  “It’s a way of keeping culture strong, passing on knowledge, and staying
  connected to Country. Through weaving, people come together to connect, share,
  create and continue something that’s been done for generations.” The Tjanpi
  Desert Weavers launched in Papulankutja, Western Australia, as a series of
  basket-making workshops facilitated by the Ngaanyatjarra, Pitjantjatjara and
  Yankunytjatjara Women’s Council (NPYWC). It wasn’t long before the women,
  searching for meaningful and culturally appropriate employment on their
  homelands, started sharing the artform with their loved ones. Anderson’s aunt
  Margaret Smith, who is the NPYWC chair, says the project has multiple
  benefits: “We are making it with our own hands … Collecting grass for our
  artwork means collecting bush food, camping out and going out into country.”
  It also helps women make money to cover essential expenses such as groceries,
  powercards and fuel – and it can also “settle the mind down from all the
  worries”, she says. Anderson’s niece Justine is also in the Tjanpi Desert
  Weavers. Based in remote Aputula (Finke) in the Northern Territory, she first
  started learning in 2010 at a workshop in Amata, an Aboriginal community near
  the border between South Australia and the Northern Territory. Justine’s
  sculptures often depict local animals with fanciful details, such as life-like
  saddles on the backs of her kamula (camels), or the tongue and whiskers of a
  panting papa (dog). Vibrant wool and raffia stitching is also a distinctive
  characteristic of her work. Weaving keeps her “happy and busy”. “It’s a way
  for me to keep food on the table and make my kids happy,” she says. “My boys
  go to school down in Adelaide, so my weaving means they have some spending
  money too.” Justine passed her skills on to family members including her
  sister, who is also a Tjanpi weaver; Cynthia Burke, another Tjanpi weaver,
  learned by watching her mum and aunty during the group’s early years. Sitting
  together as a collective, laughing and joking while weaving, is an important
  part of the enterprise, she says. “When you sit down at home on the weekend or
  go somewhere to other places, sometimes for sorry business, ladies always take
  their raffia so they can sit down and do their weaving together,” she says. “I
  feel proud when I sell my work and work for Tjanpi.” Smith emphasises the
  benefits of passing on skills and cultural knowledge to younger generations.
  “All my daughters know how to make tjanpi. They love it. It gives our young
  people pride,” she says. While the women of Tjanpi Desert Weavers speak openly
  about the cultural, financial and emotional benefits of their work, they have
  also made significant strides in the art world over the past 30 years. In
  2005, a group of Tjanpi artists won the major prize in the National Aboriginal
  and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards (Natsiaa) for their giant woven Tjanpi
  Toyota. In 2015, a collaborative work between the Tjanpi Desert Weavers and
  artist Fiona Hall was exhibited at the Venice Biennale. Two years later,
  Tjanpi works were a major feature of the exhibition Songlines: Tracking the
  Seven Sisters at the National Museum of Australia, which subsequently toured
  to the UK, France and Germany; it will travel to India later this year,
  followed by China in 2026. One of the group’s sculptural installations,
  Kungkarangkalpa (Seven sisters), is a centrepiece of the exhibition 65,000
  Years: A Short History of Australian Art at the Potter Museum of Art in
  Melbourne. The co-curator Judith Ryan describes the work as a “palpable, fully
  three-dimensional manifestation” of the creation myth, “spectacular in its
  scale and presence”. “I believe this is the Tjanpi Desert Weavers’ magnum
  opus,” she adds. But not all their works are grand. In August, Justine is
  exhibiting a collection of animal sculptures at Darwin Aboriginal art fair.
  She just wants people to enjoy her work: “I hope my artwork makes them feel
  homey wherever they put it, and reminds them of me,” she says. “It’s good to
  see my art out there, you know?” This article was amended on 25 August. An
  earlier version incorrectly stated a lampshade by Justine Anderson as being
  exhibited at Darwin Aboriginal art fair.
