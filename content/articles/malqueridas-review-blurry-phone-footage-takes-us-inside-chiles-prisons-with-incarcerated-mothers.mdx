  Malqueridas review – blurry phone footage takes us inside Chile’s prisons with
  incarcerated mothers

bodyText: >-
  This documentary about motherhood in Chile’s prison system is edited down from
  4,000 photos and nearly 2,000 videos shot entirely on mobile phones by inmates
  of the country’s largest women’s jail. Phones are banned, so the images are
  often fuzzy and blurred, clips ending abruptly – sometimes with a hiss of
  “Hide the phone!” or “The guard is coming!”. At times, it can be hard to make
  sense of what is happening on screen. The voiceover is spoken by Karina
  Sánchez, who spent more than six years in prison, and she also voices the
  experiences of other incarcerated women. It’s not immediately clear she is
  telling multiple stories, however, so the voiceover becomes mildly
  disorientating. It’s estimated that 95% of women in Chile’s prisons are
  mothers, and their children can stay with them in jail until they turn two
  years old. A woman describes staying awake all night the night before her son
  left, watching him sleep (she had 10 years to serve of her sentence). Mums
  tell painful stories of losing contact with their children once they leave;
  one received a notification from the family court that her children had been
  taken into foster care, relinquished by her sister. Film-maker Tana Gilbert
  collected the footage for her 74-minute film over six years; the title is
  Spanish for “badly loved” or “unloved” women. One prisoner describes having to
  give birth in a hospital in handcuffs, after the doctor refused to believe she
  wasn’t high on drugs (“All you prison bitches are into drugs”). There are
  funny moments, too, including clips of women frantically exercising after a
  fitness craze gripped the prison. We never find out what crimes the women were
  convicted of, which feels respectful, but there’s little wider context either,
  of the poverty and inequality that drive up Chile’s female prison population.
  In the end, the film remains opaque and elusive in ways that audiences
  (particularly outside the country) might find frustrating. • Malqueridas is on
  True Stories from 15 August.
