  We’re closing this blog now – thanks for following along. You can read our
  latest story here: Israel’s plan to take control of Gaza City marks “a
  dangerous escalation” that risks “deepening the already catastrophic
  consequences for millions of Palestinians”, the UN secretary-general Antonio
  Guterres said. That decision “will result in additional forced displacement,
  killings and massive destruction, compounding the unimaginable suffering of
  the Palestinian population in Gaza,” a statement from the UN chief’s
  spokesperson added. The UN Security Council will meet in a rare weekend
  session on Saturday to discuss the situation. The meeting at 7pm GMT had been
  requested by several members of the security council as global concern mounts
  over Israel’s plan. The German government will not approve any exports of
  military equipment that could be used in the Gaza Strip until further notice,
  chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Friday in response to Israel’s plan to
  expand its military operations there. Netanyahu accused the German government
  of “rewarding Hamas terrorism”. The move is hugely significant from Germany,
  which believes it has a special responsibility towards Israel and is its
  second-largest arms supplier after the US. France joined the chorus of
  countries including among others the UK, China, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan and
  Saudi Arabia, condemning the Israeli plan, saying it would “worsen an already
  catastrophic situation without enabling the release of Hamas hostages, its
  disarmament, or its surrender”. France’s ministry of foreign affairs has
  issued a press release, condemning the plan “in the strongest terms”. It
  reads: “These actions would constitute further serious violations of
  international law and lead to an absolute stalemate. They would undermine the
  legitimate aspirations of the Palestinians to live in peace in a viable,
  sovereign, and contiguous state, and pose a threat to regional stability.” The
  ministry added that Israel’s plans would “in no way” contribute to the
  security of Israelis, including the remaining hostages in Gaza. The future of
  Gaza should be through a “framework of a future Palestinian state led by the
  Palestinian Authority”, it said. Israel’s decision to take over Gaza City
  “must have consequences for EU-Israel relations”, EU Council president Antonio
  Costa said on Friday, adding that this will be assessed by the Council and
  that he urged the Israeli government to reconsider. Hamas warned the Israeli
  government that seizing control of Gaza City would amount to “sacrificing” the
  hostages still being held in the Palestinian territory. The group said: “The
  decision to occupy Gaza confirms that the criminal [Israeli prime minister
  Benjamin] Netanyahu and his Nazi government do not care about the fate of
  their captives.” Former Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert told CNN that
  Israel’s plan to take control of Gaza City won’t save the remaining hostages,
  but will rather endanger lives and “increase the number of crimes” in the
  territory. He told CNN today that an expanded military operation “is not going
  to save the hostages, is going to cost the lives of many soldiers, and is
  going to cost the lives of many non-involved Palestinians”. Olmert, was prime
  minister from 2006 to 2009, blamed the decision on Benjamin Netanyahu’s
  struggle to hold together his government. Former Israeli prime minister Ehud
  Olmert has said that Israel’s plan to take control of Gaza City won’t save the
  remaining hostages, but will rather endanger lives and “increase the number of
  crimes” in the territory. He told CNN today that an expanded military
  operation “is not going to save the hostages, is going to cost the lives of
  many soldiers, and is going to cost the lives of many non-involved
  Palestinians”. “It will increase the number of crimes which will be committed
  not as part of a policy. There is no policy of committing crimes or of
  genocide or anything like that,” he said. “But this is the nature of this
  operation.” Olmert, was prime minister from 2006 to 2009, said ending the war
  would save the hostages still being held in Gaza and other victims. He blamed
  the decision on Benjamin Netanyahu’s struggle to hold together his government.
  The prime minister personally is captive of a group of messianic partners in
  the coalition government which holds the tide. And they threaten that if the
  decision will be different, they will break down the government. This is the
  universal consensus in Israel today that this is a political expediency. There
  is no question about it. Last month, Olmert told my colleague Emma
  Graham-Harrison that the so-called “humanitarian city” Israel’s defence
  minister has proposed building on the ruins of Rafah would be a concentration
  camp, and forcing Palestinians inside would be ethnic cleansing. We now have
  confirmation of AFP’s report that the United Nations Security Council will
  indeed meet on Saturday, according to its schedule released today, after
  Israel’s security cabinet approved a widely condemned plan to take control of
  Gaza City. Ambassador Riyad Mansour, permanent observer of the State of
  Palestine to the United Nations, had earlier said a number of countries would
  be requesting a meeting of the UN Security Council on Israel’s plans. The
  meeting will take place at 7pm GMT on Saturday, the schedule says. The US
  ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, has launched an undiplomatic attack on
  Keir Starmer by invoking the allied second world war bombing of Dresden after
  the British prime minister criticised the Israeli security cabinet’s decision
  to expand the war in Gaza. “So Israel is expected to surrender to Hamas &amp;
  feed them even though Israeli hostages are being starved?” Huckabee wrote on
  social media (repeating the un-evidenced Israeli government talking point that
  Hamas is stealing aid meant for civilians). He was responding to a post by
  Starmer calling for an immediate ceasefire and lamenting the humanitarian
  crisis in Gaza, as well as the fate of the remaining Israeli hostages being
  held by Hamas. Provocatively, Huckabee, who has a history of making
  intemperate comments in Israel’s favour, added: Did UK surrender to Nazis and
  drop food to them? Ever heard of Dresden, PM Starmer? That wasn’t food you
  dropped. If you had been PM then UK would be speaking German! The bombing of
  Dresden by the RAF and US air force in February 1945 is believed to have
  killed tens of thousands of civilians. It remains one of the most
  controversial allied acts of the second world war, amid questions marks over
  its strategic necessity and the widespread destruction in civilian areas. You
  can read Robert’s full piece here: Further to the French foreign minister’s
  comments I brought you a little while ago, France’s ministry of foreign
  affairs has issued a press release, condemning “in the strongest terms” the
  Israeli government’s plans to take control of Gaza City. It reads: These
  actions would constitute further serious violations of international law and
  lead to an absolute stalemate. They would undermine the legitimate aspirations
  of the Palestinians to live in peace in a viable, sovereign, and contiguous
  state, and pose a threat to regional stability. The ministry added that
  Israel’s plans would “in no way” contribute to the security of Israelis,
  including the remaining hostages in Gaza. The future of Gaza should be through
  a “framework of a future Palestinian state led by the Palestinian Authority”,
  it said. In July, Emmanuel Macron said that France will recognize a
  Palestinian state in September. France has joined the chorus of countries
  strongly condemning Israel’s plan to occupy Gaza City, saying it would “worsen
  an already catastrophic situation without enabling the release of Hamas
  hostages, its disarmament, or its surrender”. In a post on X, the French
  foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, wrote: France strongly condemns the
  Israeli government’s plan aimed at preparing for the complete occupation of
  Gaza. Such an operation would worsen an already catastrophic situation without
  enabling the release of Hamas hostages, its disarmament, or its surrender. The
  United Nations Security Council will meet in a rare weekend session on
  Saturday to discuss Israel’s plan to take control of Gaza City, three
  diplomatic sources have told Agence France-Presse. The meeting at 7pm GMT had
  been requested by several members of the security council, a member of the
  council told AFP, as global concern mounts over Israel’s plan. United Nations
  secretary-general António Guterres has criticized Israel’s plan to take
  control of Gaza City, with the UN chief’s spokesperson saying the decision
  marked “a dangerous escalation” that risks “deepening the already catastrophic
  consequences for millions of Palestinians”. That decision “will result in
  additional forced displacement, killings and massive destruction, compounding
  the unimaginable suffering of the Palestinian population in Gaza,” the
  statement added. Guterres also posted a statement on X: I’m gravely alarmed by
  the decision of the Israeli Government to “take control of Gaza City”. This
  marks a dangerous escalation &amp; risks deepening the already catastrophic
  consequences for millions of Palestinians. It could further endanger more
  lives, including of the remaining hostages. I reiterate my urgent appeal for a
  permanent ceasefire, unimpeded humanitarian access across Gaza &amp; the
  immediate &amp; unconditional release of all hostages. It follows the UN high
  commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, saying earlier today that “the
  Israeli government’s plan for a complete military takeover of the occupied
  Gaza Strip must be immediately halted”. In a statement, Türk said: It runs
  contrary to the ruling of the International Court of Justice that Israel must
  bring its occupation to an end as soon as possible, to the realisation of the
  agreed two-state solution and to the right of Palestinians to
  self-determination. The plan triggered global condemnation, with China,
  Turkey, Britain and numerous Arab governments issuing statements of concern.
  Displaced repeatedly. Forced to live in tent camps or amid the ruins of their
  homes. Stricken by hunger and deprived of medical supplies. Now, 22 months
  into the war, around a million Palestinians are bracing for another
  catastrophe after the Israeli security cabinet’s decision to take control of
  the entire Gaza Strip. Such an offensive would force them toward the south of
  the enclave, and an uncertain future. “Since this morning, after hearing the
  news of evacuation of Gaza City, I have been been feeling anxious and
  afraid,’’ said Umm Ibrahim Banat, a 55-year-old mother, originally from
  northern Gaza, who has already been displaced four times. ‘‘Where will we go
  with the children and the elderly? I swear we are exhausted from displacement,
  starvation, and being driven from one place to another.” “Now,” she said, “We
  are the walking dead.’’ Following a 10-hour overnight meeting, Israeli prime
  minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office announced on Friday that his security
  cabinet had approved a plan to take over Gaza City, marking another escalation
  of Israel’s offensive that has killed at least 61,000 Palestinians, most of
  them civilians. According to Israel’s Channel 12 the plan, which would mean
  sending ground troops into the territory, could displace tens of thousands of
  people and further disrupt efforts to deliver food to the territory and force
  approximately 1 million Palestinians in Gaza City and other areas into
  evacuation areas in the southern part of the enclave. “Gaza has been
  completely destroyed – what more can they do?”, said Banat, whose daughter
  Maryam was killed with her husband and children. “We have lost the best of our
  youth; our territory is a huge prison besieged by land, sea, and air; the
  destruction has become unbearable; diseases are spreading, tents stretch as
  far as the eye can see, water is contaminated, prices are insane, hospitals
  are in ruins, our lives are utterly tragic! What more do they want?” The US
  and UK have “disagreements” on Gaza including over whether to recognise a
  Palestinian state, JD Vance has suggested as he arrived in England for his
  summer holiday. The US vice-president was speaking ahead of a bilateral
  meeting with David Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, at his 17th-century
  grace-and-favour country house, Chevening. His remarks on Gaza marked a note
  of discord in what otherwise appeared to be a convivial meeting between the
  two politicians, who have struck up an unlikely friendship. The pair have
  bonded over their Christian faith and difficult childhoods. Before speaking to
  reporters on Friday afternoon, Lammy and Vance were filmed fishing for carp
  together in a pond near Chevening House. Expressing his love for the UK and
  describing Lammy as a “good friend” and “gracious host”, Vance joked that
  their varying degrees of success in the carp pond was the “one strain on the
  special relationship”. “All of my kids caught fish, but the foreign secretary
  did not,” he said. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu told German
  chancellor Friedrich Merz that Israel’s goal is not to take over Gaza, but to
  free Gaza from Hamas and enable a peaceful government to be established there,
  the prime minister’s office said on X. Netanyahu expressed his disappointment
  with Berlin’s decision to suspend weapons exports to Israel during the phone
  call with Merz on Friday, the office added. Palestinians on the street

  The German government will not approve any exports of military equipment that
  could be used in the Gaza Strip until further notice, chancellor Friedrich
  Merz said on Friday in response to Israel’s plan to expand its military
  operations there. Israel’s decision to take over Gaza City “must have
  consequences for EU-Israel relations”, EU Council president Antonio Costa said
  on Friday, adding that this will be assessed by the Council and that he urged
  the Israeli government to reconsider. Despite the announcement of the Israeli
  plan, mediators from Egypt and Qatar are working on a new framework which will
  include the release of all hostages — dead and alive — in one go in return for
  an end of the war in Gaza and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the strip,
  two Arab officials told the Associated Press anonymously. Israeli opposition
  leader Yair Lapid blasted the security cabinet’s Gaza City decision as “a
  disaster that will lead to many more disasters” and said far-right ministers
  Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich had dragged Benjamin Netanyahu into
  something that was “exactly what Hamas wanted”. Lapid said the decision would
  lead to the deaths of more hostages and many soldiers as well as “political
  collapse”. Hamas said in a statement that “Netanyahu’s plans to escalate the
  aggression confirm beyond any doubt his desire to get rid of the captives and
  sacrifice them in pursuit of his personal interests and extremist ideological
  agenda”. And in the first reaction by a main Arab neighbour to Netanyahu’s
  comments on taking over Gaza, a Jordanian official told Reuters that Arabs
  “will only support what Palestinians agree and decide on”. Norway’s $2
  trillion sovereign wealth fund will announce changes to the handling of its
  Israeli investments, finance minister Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday, ruling
  out any blanket withdrawal over the war in Gaza. The fund itself said it would
  provide an update on its Israeli investments on Tuesday. David Lammy said he
  would be discussing the “developing situation in Gaza” and the ongoing war in
  Ukraine with JD Vance. Sitting alongside the US vice-president at the start of
  a bilateral meeting at Chevening House, the UK foreign secretary said: “Of
  course we will be discussing the developing situation in Gaza, which is a
  great concern, and of course the ongoing war in Ukraine, and the desire to see
  that come to an end.” Saudi Arabia condemns any Israeli move to take control
  of Gaza, the foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday. The kingdom
  “categorically denounces Israeli occupation authorities’ persistence in
  committing crimes of starvation, brutal practices, and ethnic cleansing
  against the brotherly Palestinian people,” it said in a statement. An Israeli
  airstrike on eastern Lebanon killed a number of people, including a senior
  member of a Palestinian group and his bodyguard as they were on their way to
  Syria, news reports and his group said on Friday, according to the Associated
  Press (AP). China expressed “serious concerns” on Friday over Israel’s plan to
  take control of Gaza City, urging it to “immediately cease its dangerous
  actions”. “Gaza belongs to the Palestinian people and is an inseparable part
  of Palestinian territory,” a foreign ministry spokesperson told Agence
  France-Presse (AFP) in a message. Turkey has urged the international community
  to prevent Israel’s plan to take control of Gaza City, saying it was a “heavy
  blow” to peace and security. “We call on the international community to fulfil
  its responsibilities to prevent the implementation of this decision, which
  aims to forcibly displace Palestinians from their own land,” the foreign
  ministry said in a statement on Friday, reports Reuters. Israel’s decision to
  intensify its military operation in Gaza is wrong and should immediately be
  reversed, Danish foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen told Denmark’s TV2 on
  Friday. Jordan also condemned Israel’s decision to take control of Gaza City.
  Hamas warned the Israeli government on Friday that seizing control of Gaza
  City would amount to “sacrificing” the hostages still being held in the
  Palestinian territory. The group said: “The decision to occupy Gaza confirms
  that the criminal [Israeli prime minister Benjamin] Netanyahu and his Nazi
  government do not care about the fate of their captives.” More than a hundred
  UK-based Israelis and allies led by the grassroots activist group Mi-neged
  staged a protest outside the Foreign Office on Thursday evening, calling for
  the UK to impose immediate sanctions on Israel and end the war in Gaza.
  Hundreds of demonstrators outside Netanyahu’s office in Jerusalem on Thursday
  evening protested against any expansion of the war, demanding an immediate end
  to the military campaign in return for the release of all hostages. Israel’s
  decision to take over Gaza City “must have consequences for EU-Israel
  relations”, EU Council president Antonio Costa said on Friday, adding that
  this will be assessed by the Council and that he urged the Israeli government
  to reconsider. “Not only [does the decision] violate the agreement with the EU
  announced by the High Representative on July 19 but also undermines
  fundamental principles of international law and universal values,” Costa, who
  heads the European Council that represents EU member states, added in his
  statement on X. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Fox News in an
  interview that aired on Thursday that the military intended to take control of
  all of Gaza. The announcement from the prime minister’s office early on Friday
  after Thursday’s security cabinet meeting said the military would take Gaza
  City, but did not say if Israeli forces would take all of the enclave.
  Israel’s cabinet is expected to endorse the Gaza City plan. Norway’s $2
  trillion sovereign wealth fund will announce changes to the handling of its
  Israeli investments, finance minister Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday, ruling
  out any blanket withdrawal over the war in Gaza. The fund itself said it would
  provide an update on its Israeli investments on Tuesday. The government this
  week launched an urgent review of the investments over ethics concerns linked
  to the war in Gaza and the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. “I see several
  measures over time, but what can be addressed quickly, must be done quickly,”
  Stoltenberg told a press conference after holding his second meeting with fund
  officials in three days. He did not say what these measures could be, but
  added that there would not be a wholesale divestment from all Israeli
  companies. “If we did that, it would mean we are divesting from them because
  they are Israeli,” he said. US vice-president JD Vance said the US has “no
  plans” to recognise a state of Palestine during a bilateral meeting with
  foreign secretary David Lammy at Chevening House. He said: “Obviously the
  United Kingdom’s going to make its decision. We have no plans to recognise a
  Palestinian state. “I don’t know what it would mean to really recognise a
  Palestinian state, given the lack of functional government there.” He added
  that the US government’s two goals are “very simple”, saying: “Number one,
  it’s we want to make it so that Hamas cannot attack innocent Israeli civilians
  ever again, and we think that has to come through the eradication of Hamas.
  “Second, the president has been very moved by these terrible images of the
  humanitarian crisis in Gaza, so we want to make sure that we solve that
  problem. “I think all of us can work on how to solve that problem. Obviously,
  it’s not an easy problem to solve, or it would have already been dealt with,
  but we share, I think, that focus and that goal. We may have some
  disagreements about how exactly to accomplish that goal, and we’ll talk about
  that today.” More than a hundred UK-based Israelis and allies led by the
  grassroots activist group Mi-neged staged a protest outside the Foreign Office
  on Thursday evening, calling for the UK to impose immediate sanctions on
  Israel and end the war in Gaza. As civil servants and politicians left the
  Cabinet Office after work, 98 demonstrators raised 98 red and black globes and
  a large sign that read: “You let Israel murder 98 today. Each person is a
  world.” Other signs read “Israelis against genocide” and “stop arming Israel”.
  Mi-neged recently sent UK prime minister Keir Starmer and foreign secretary
  David Lammy a letter signed by more than 200 Israeli citizens living in the
  UK. A Mi-neged spokesperson said: Keir Starmer says the UK might act in
  September. Yet every single day that passes we hear of more people killed by
  Israel in Gaza. Some by plane, some by bullet, some by engineered starvation.
  Today it was 98 Palestinians. It is impossible to fully comprehend the scale
  of this human-made tragedy. We’ve come here today to physically represent this
  unconscionable number and to remind our representatives that every single one
  of those murdered in Gaza is an entire universe, as full, complex and real as
  they are. For more than 60,000 people it is already too late. Starmer’s
  ‘threat’ that the UK will recognise Palestine has unsurprisingly had no
  effect, and Israel is only talking of ramping up its horrific assault with a
  full-blown occupation of Gaza. The UK must take immediate action to sanction
  Israel in ways that would impose a real cost in order to stop its genocidal
  destruction of Gaza and its people, and the ethnic cleansing of the West Bank.
  David Lammy said he would be discussing the “developing situation in Gaza” and
  the ongoing war in Ukraine with JD Vance. Sitting alongside the US
  vice-president at the start of a bilateral meeting at Chevening House, the UK
  foreign secretary said: Of course we will be discussing the developing
  situation in Gaza, which is a great concern, and of course the ongoing war in
  Ukraine, and the desire to see that come to an end. In a statement about the
  latest decision from the Israeli government, the independent MP, and former
  Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn has restated his claim that the UK is “complicit
  in genocide”. Corbyn said: If the government was truly horrified by Israel’s
  occupation of Gaza, it would stop supplying them with the weapons they need to
  carry it out. The prime minister can condemn Israel’s plans all he wants. He
  cannot hide the truth: his government is complicit in genocide. Belgian
  foreign minister Maxime Prévot said on X that the Israeli ambassador had been
  summoned to express “our total disapproval of this decision”. In a statement
  published to the social media site on Friday, Prévot said: Following the
  Israeli government’s official confirmation of its intention to subsequently
  surround and occupy the city of Gaza, and take military control of the entire
  Gaza Strip, I have decided to summon the Israeli ambassador. The aim is
  clearly to express our total disapproval of this decision, but also of the
  continued colonisation, in particular the resumption of the E1 project east of
  Jerusalem, and the desire to annex the West Bank as was recently promoted by
  the Knesset. All of these actions, with a potential to wipe Palestine
  completely off the map, are unacceptable and contrary to international law,
  United Nations resolutions and the decisions of the International Court of
  Justice. They also pose a major risk to the Israeli hostages still being held.
  We must therefore vigorously advocate for a reversal of these plans, which
  would permanently compromise any prospect of a ceasefire and a peaceful and
  lasting two-state solution, which Belgium has been insisting on for months,
  not to mention full free access by land for humanitarian aid. While it is
  legitimate to want to destroy the terrorist group Hamas, this cannot be
  achieved through disproportionate operations that will further lengthen the
  already very long list of Palestinian civilian victims. Germany will not
  authorise any exports of military equipment that could be used in Gaza “until
  further notice”, Chancellor Friedrich Merz has announced. It was a quick
  response by one of Israel’s strongest international backers to a decision by
  prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s cabinet to take over Gaza City. The move
  by Germany, which had previously stopped short of tougher lines against
  Israel’s government taken by some of its European Union allies, appears likely
  to further isolate Israel over the military takeover plan which has been
  condemned by the United Nations and supporters of Israeli hostages still held
  in Gaza. In a statement, Merz emphasised that Israel “has the right to defend
  itself against Hamas’s terror” and said the release of Israeli hostages and
  “purposeful” negotiations towards a ceasefire in the 22-month conflict “are
  our top priority”. He added that Hamas must not have a role in the future of
  Gaza. Saudi Arabia condemns any Israeli move to take control of Gaza, the
  foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday. The kingdom “categorically
  denounces Israeli occupation authorities’ persistence in committing crimes of
  starvation, brutal practices, and ethnic cleansing against the brotherly
  Palestinian people,” it said in a statement. Palestinians in Gaza expressed
  fear, frustration and exhaustion on Thursday after the Israeli prime minister,
  Benjamin Netanyahu, said he wanted Israel to take military control of the
  entire Gaza Strip. Those displaced by the fighting shared their opinions hours
  after Netanyahu told Fox News that Israel intended to take over the entire
  territory for security purposes but did not plan to govern it long-term. He
  said the aim would be to eventually hand over control to Arab forces, though
  he gave no specifics on what that could entail. Hamas warned the Israeli
  government on Friday that seizing control of Gaza City would amount to
  “sacrificing” the hostages still being held in the Palestinian territory. The
  group said: “The decision to occupy Gaza confirms that the criminal [Israeli
  prime minister Benjamin] Netanyahu and his Nazi government do not care about
  the fate of their captives.” Hamas added: They understand that expanding the
  aggression means sacrificing them. The European commission president, Ursula
  von der Leyen, has called for the Gaza City takeover plan to be
  “reconsidered”, urging the release of hostages and immediate delivery of
  humanitarian aid to the territory. In a post on X, she said: The Israeli
  government’s decision to further extend its military operation in Gaza must be
  reconsidered. At the same time, there must be the release of all hostages, who
  are being held in inhumane conditions. And humanitarian aid must be given
  immediate and unhindered access to Gaza to deliver what is urgently needed on
  the ground. A ceasefire is needed now. Despite the announcement of the Israeli
  plan, mediators from Egypt and Qatar are working on a new framework which will
  include the release of all hostages — dead and alive — in one go in return for
  an end of the war in Gaza and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the strip,
  two Arab officials told the Associated Press anonymously. The yet-to-be
  finalized framework aims to address the contentious issue of what to do with
  Hamas’ weapons, with Israel seeking full disarmament and Hamas refusing. One
  official, who is directly involved in the efforts, said discussions are
  underway about “freezing arms,” which may involve Hamas retaining but not
  using its weapons. It also calls for the group to relinquish power in the
  strip. A Palestinian-Arab committee would run Gaza and oversee the
  reconstruction efforts until the establishment of a Palestinian administration
  with a new police force, trained by two US allies in the Middle East, to take
  over the strip, he said. It is unclear what role the Western-backed
  Palestinian Authority would play. A senior Hamas official, speaking on
  condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to brief the media, said
  the group’s leadership has been aware of the Arab mediators’ efforts to revive
  the ceasefire talks, but has yet to receive details. Associated Press reached
  out to the governments in Qatar, Egypt and Israel for comment. Israel’s
  decision to intensify its military operation in Gaza is wrong and should
  immediately be reversed, Danish foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen told
  Denmark’s TV2 on Friday. Jordan also condemned Israel’s decision to take
  control of Gaza City. Israel’s plan to intensify operations in Gaza is “a
  wrong move”, Dutch foreign minister Caspar Veldkamp said on Friday. Veldkamp
  said in a statement on X: The plan of the Netanyahu government to intensify
  Israeli operations in Gaza is a wrong move. The [Gaza] humanitarian situation
  is catastrophic and demands immediate improvement. This decision in no way
  contributes to this and will also not help to get the hostages home. Hamas
  described the Israeli government’s plan to take control of Gaza City as a “new
  war crime” on Friday, warning the operation would cost it “dearly”. According
  to Agence France-Presse (AFP), the group said in a statement: The Zionist
  cabinet’s approval of plans to occupy Gaza City and evacuate its residents
  constitutes a new war crime that the occupation army intends to commit against
  the city. We warn the criminal occupation that this criminal adventure will
  cost it dearly and will not be an easy journey. The German government will not
  approve any exports of military equipment that could be used in the Gaza Strip
  until further notice, chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Friday in response to
  Israel’s plan to expand its military operations there. Merz said it was
  Israel’s right to disarm Hamas and to seek the release of the Israeli hostages
  but “the German government believes that the even tougher military action in
  the Gaza Strip decided upon by the Israeli cabinet last night makes it
  increasingly difficult to see how these goals can be achieved”. According to
  Reuters, Merz said in a statement: Under these circumstances, the German
  government will not approve any exports of military equipment that could be
  used in the Gaza Strip until further notice. The release of the hostages and
  negotiations for a ceasefire are Germany’s top priorities, Merz said,
  expressing deep concern over the suffering of civilians in the Gaza Strip.
  Germany’s parliament said in June that export licences for military equipment
  to Israel worth €485m ($564m) were granted between 7 October 2023 and 13 May
  2025, reports Reuters. Spain has condemned the Israeli government’s decision
  to escalate its military occupation of Gaza. According to Agence France-Presse
  (AFP), Spanish foreign minister José Manuel Albares said: We firmly condemn
  the decision of the Israeli government to escalate the military occupation of
  Gaza. It will only cause more destruction and suffering.” He added that “a
  permanent ceasefire, the immediate and massive entry of humanitarian aid, and
  the release of all hostages are urgently needed”. An Israeli airstrike on
  eastern Lebanon killed a number of people, including a senior member of a
  Palestinian group and his bodyguard as they were on their way to Syria, news
  reports and his group said on Friday, according to the Associated Press (AP).
  The Thursday afternoon airstrike near the Lebanese border crossing of Masnaa
  killed Mohammed Wishah, a member of the central committee of the Popular Front
  for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), the group said in a statement. There
  was no immediate comment from Israel. “We have lost two of the most loyal
  comrades who gave their precious souls to freedom,” Marwan Abdel-Al, a senior
  PFLP official, wrote in a post on social media about the death of Wishah and
  his bodyguard, Mufid Hussein. According to the AP, a PFLP official said Wishah
  had been in Lebanon to meet other officials with the group and was on his way
  back to Syria when the airstrike happened. The official spoke on condition of
  anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the media. The PFLP
  statement said Wishah was born in the Gaza Strip in 1954 and spent five years
  in Israeli jails shortly after he joined the Palestinian group in 1973.
  Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said the airstrike on east Lebanon
  killed six people and injured 10, without identifying the victims.
  Additionally, on Friday morning, an Israeli drone strike hit a car in a
  coastal highway in south Lebanon killing citizen journalist Mohammed Shehadeh,
  the NNA said. The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) accused Israeli forces

  yesterday and killing one of its staff members. In a post on X on Thursday,
  the PRCS wrote: Today, our colleague Ashraf Suleiman Eid Yousef (44), a staff
  member in the administrative services department at the Sarayah field hospital
  in Gaza City, was killed after Israeli forces targeted a group of civilians
  while they were waiting to receive aid in the Kisufim area, east of the
  central governorate. This brings the total number of PRCS team members killed
  to 53. The Guardian has been unable to independently verify this report. The
  Green party has also called for the end of all UK arms sales to Israel. Ellie
  Chowns, the Green MP and a candidate to be co-leader in the current leadership
  contest, posted this on social media: [Benjamin] Netanyahu’s brutal plan to
  take control of Gaza is yet another declaration of intent to commit war
  crimes. The UK must do more than express disapproval: end military cooperation
  and arms sales, recognise Palestine, demand an immediate ceasefire and
  accountability for war crimes. The international charity ActionAid UK said on
  Friday that it was “deeply alarmed” by the Israeli government’s plan to take
  control of Gaza City, describing it as a “horrifying escalation”. Hannah Bond,
  the co-CEO of ActionAid UK, said: We are deeply alarmed that the Israeli
  government has decided to push ahead with its plan to take control of Gaza
  City, which clearly violates international humanitarian law. This horrifying
  escalation will forcibly displace hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who
  are already experiencing starvation and have nowhere else to flee, and will
  inevitably result in even more bloodshed. The UK government has condemned this
  decision but it should know by now that words are not enough to stop the
  Israeli authorities from pursuing a course of destruction. It needs to take
  real tangible action immediately: that includes halting all arms exports to
  the Israeli government and imposing further sanctions. If third states delay
  any longer, there will be nothing of Gaza left. Scotland’s first minister,
  John Swinney, said the Israeli government’s decision to occupy Gaza City will
  “create even more human suffering”. In a post on X, he wrote: The decision of
  the Israeli government to seize control of Gaza City is completely and utterly
  unacceptable. It will create even more human suffering for the Palestinian
  people and further escalate the conflict. The international community must
  stop Israel and secure a ceasefire. China expressed “serious concerns” on
  Friday over Israel’s plan to take control of Gaza City, urging it to
  “immediately cease its dangerous actions”. “Gaza belongs to the Palestinian
  people and is an inseparable part of Palestinian territory,” a foreign
  ministry spokesperson told Agence France-Presse (AFP) in a message. “The
  correct way to ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and to secure the release
  of hostages is an immediate ceasefire,” they added. “A complete resolution to
  the Gaza conflict hinges on a ceasefire; only then can a path to de-escalation
  be paved and regional security ensured,” the spokesperson said. Beijing said
  on Friday it was “willing to work together with the international community to
  help end the fighting in Gaza as soon as possible”. The Hostages and Missing
  Families Forum has accused the Israeli government of sentencing the remaining
  living Israeli hostages and captives in Gaza “to death”, reports the Times of
  Israel. In a statement in reaction to the Israeli security cabinet’s plan to
  take over Gaza City, the group said: Tonight, the Israeli government sentenced
  the living hostages to death and the fallen hostages to disappearance. The
  cabinet decision to launch the process of occupying the [Gaza] Strip is an
  official declaration of the abandonment of the hostages, while completely
  ignoring the repeated warnings by the military echelon and the clear desire of
  most of the public in Israel. According to the Israeli online newspaper, the
  Forum’s statement also accuses the government of acting against the national
  interest with a “foolish” move of “deception and unforgivable moral and
  security neglect” that brings Israel closer to a “colossal disaster for the
  hostages and [IDF] fighters”. The group added that it was not too late and
  that the plan could be stopped, with the government seeking a deal to end the
  war and return all the hostages. The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, has
  said it was “increasingly clear” that Benjamin Netanyahu’s “goal is ethnic
  cleansing” in Gaza and urged the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, to stop the
  export of all UK arms to Israel and sanction the Israeli PM. Davey said:
  Netanyahu’s plans to occupy the whole of Gaza are utterly abhorrent – and it’s
  increasingly clear that his goal is ethnic cleansing. This plan will only
  serve to wreak more devastation on the lives of millions of Gazans – whose
  homes and communities have already been destroyed – while endangering the
  lives of those hostages still held by Hamas. Rather than sitting on its hands
  and issuing strongly worded statements, the UK government needs to take
  decisive action. Keir Starmer needs to stop the export of all UK arms to
  Israel – today – and sanction Netanyahu and his cabinet. Turkey has urged the
  international community to prevent Israel’s plan to take control of Gaza City,
  saying it was a “heavy blow” to peace and security. “We call on the
  international community to fulfil its responsibilities to prevent the
  implementation of this decision, which aims to forcibly displace Palestinians
  from their own land,” the foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday,
  reports Reuters. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, said
  on Friday that “the Israeli government’s plan for a complete military takeover
  of the occupied Gaza Strip must be immediately halted”. In a statement, Türk
  said: It runs contrary to the ruling of the International Court of Justice
  that Israel must bring its occupation to an end as soon as possible, to the
  realisation of the agreed two-state solution and to the right of Palestinians
  to self-determination. Finland’s foreign minister Elina Valtonen said she was
  “extremely worried” by the looming famine in Gaza. According to Reuters,
  Valtonen said: We hope for an immediate Gaza ceasefire and the immediate
  release of Israeli hostages. UK prime minister Keir Starmer on Friday said
  Israel’s decision to further escalate its offensive in Gaza is wrong and urged
  the Israeli government to reconsider. In a statement, Starmer said: The
  Israeli government’s decision to further escalate its offensive in Gaza is
  wrong, and we urge it to reconsider immediately. This action will do nothing
  to bring an end to this conflict or to help secure the release of the
  hostages. It will only bring more bloodshed. Every day the humanitarian crisis
  in Gaza worsens and hostages taken by Hamas are being held in appalling and
  inhuman conditions. What we need is a ceasefire, a surge in humanitarian aid,
  the release of all hostages by Hamas and a negotiated solution. Hamas can play
  no part in the future of Gaza and must leave as well as disarm. Together with
  our allies, we are working on a long-term plan to secure peace in the region
  as part of a two-state solution, and ultimately achieve a brighter future for
  Palestinians and Israelis. But without both sides engaging in good faith in
  negotiations, that prospect is vanishing before our eyes. Our message is
  clear: a diplomatic solution is possible, but both parties must step away from
  the path of destruction. In additional comments, this time to Sky News,
  Fahnbulleh said: We think that the decision is the wrong decision. We think
  that it will risk escalating an already intolerable situation, and the
  consequence will be more bloodshed. There’s no one that can see what is
  happening and unfolding in Gaza that isn’t horrified by it. Our priority is,
  in order to try and get a ceasefire, we’ve got to get parties around the
  table. I know it feels incredibly hard given the current situation, but it has
  to be the priority. The UK hopes Israel will reconsider its decision to take
  control of Gaza City, a junior energy minister said on Friday, reports
  Reuters. Miatta Fahnbulleh told Times Radio: We think that decision is the
  wrong decision, and we hope that the Israeli government will reconsider it. It
  risks escalating an already intolerable and atrocious situation. The Times of
  Israel reports that Yair Golan, the leader of the Democrats party, has said
  that Benjamin Netanyahu and the security cabinet’s decision means that “more
  hostages will be abandoned to their deaths”. Of the Israeli prime minister, he
  said: He is weak, easily pressured, lacking decision-making ability, and
  without the capacity to bridge between what the professional level presents
  and the group of messianists controlling the government. Golan described the
  decision as “a disaster for generations”. Speaking to the Israeli Army Radio,
  Golan said: Our sons and grandsons will still patrol the alleys of Gaza, we
  will pay hundreds of billions over the years, and all this for reasons of
  political survival and messianic visions. Asking how the government plans to
  demilitarize the Gaza Strip, he added: Are we going to crawl through tunnels
  and retrieve the last Kalashnikovs? Here’s a recap of the latest news after
  Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the Israeli security cabinet had approved a
  plan to take over Gaza City, marking another escalation of Israel’s offensive
  in the Gaza Strip. The decision – early on Friday during a marathon meeting –
  came after the Israeli prime minister said Israel intended to take full
  control of Gaza and eventually hand it over to friendly Arab forces opposed to
  Hamas. It is thought that the security cabinet’s decision to take over Gaza
  City as opposed to the entire territory could reflect the reservations of
  Israel’s top military officials. In key developments: Israeli opposition
  leader Yair Lapid blasted the security cabinet’s Gaza City decision as “a
  disaster that will lead to many more disasters” and said far-right ministers
  Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich had dragged Benjamin Netanyahu into
  something that was “exactly what Hamas wanted”. Lapid said the decision would
  lead to the deaths of more hostages and many soldiers as well as “political
  collapse”. In announcing the Gaza City takeover plan, Netanyahu’s office
  referred to another plan submitted to the Israeli security cabinet but said
  most of the ministers believed it “would neither achieve the defeat of Hamas
  nor the return of the hostages”. Israeli media reported that this appeared to
  be referring to a proposal presented by Israeli military chief of staff, Lt
  Gen Eyal Zamir, who has reportedly warned that occupying Gaza would plunge
  Israel into a “black hole” of prolonged insurgency, humanitarian
  responsibility and heightened risk to hostages. Hamas said in a statement that
  “Netanyahu’s plans to escalate the aggression confirm beyond any doubt his
  desire to get rid of the captives and sacrifice them in pursuit of his
  personal interests and extremist ideological agenda”. And in the first
  reaction by a main Arab neighbour to Netanyahu’s comments on taking over Gaza,
  a Jordanian official told Reuters that Arabs “will only support what
  Palestinians agree and decide on”. Hundreds of demonstrators outside
  Netanyahu’s office in Jerusalem on Thursday evening protested against any
  expansion of the war, demanding an immediate end to the military campaign in
  return for the release of all hostages. Before the security cabinet meeting,
  Netanyahu was asked on Fox News if Israel would “take control of all of Gaza”
  and he replied: “We intend to, in order to assure our security, remove Hamas
  there, enable the population to be free of Gaza.” He also said: “We don’t want
  to keep it. We want to have a security perimeter. We want to hand it over to
  Arab forces that will govern it properly without threatening us and giving
  Gazans a good life.” Israeli media reported that Netanyahu had been hoping to
  obtain approval for fully controlling Gaza at the security cabinet meeting.
  The plan would have meant sending ground troops into the few areas of the
  strip that have not been totally destroyed – roughly 25% of the territory
  where many of its 2 million people have sought refuge. Israel was reportedly
  preparing a two-phase operation aimed at seizing control of Gaza City, with
  plans to evacuate about 1 million residents – half of Gaza’s population – in
  what officials described as a temporary measure to establish civilian
  infrastructure in central Gaza. At least 42 Palestinians were killed in
  Israeli airstrikes and shootings across southern Gaza on Thursday, according
  to local hospitals. Of the 42, at least 13 were seeking aid in an Israeli
  military zone in southern Gaza where UN aid convoys are regularly overwhelmed
  by looters and desperate crowds. Former Palestine national team player
  Suleiman al-Obeid, known as the “Palestinian Pele”, has been killed by Israeli
  gunfire in the Gaza Strip, the sport’s local governing body said. Obeid, 41,
  was killed when Israeli forces “targeted people waiting for humanitarian aid
  in the southern Gaza Strip” on Wednesday, the Palestinian Football Association
  (PFA) said. Agence France-Presse reports that Obeid – an ex-star of the
  Khadamat Al-Shati club in Gaza – played 24 international matches for team
  Palestine, the PFA said. During his long career, Al-Obeid scored more than 100
  goals, making him one of the brightest stars of Palestinian football. The
  midfielder also played for the Al-Amari youth centre club in the West Bank,
  which Israel has occupied since 1967. While living there in 2010, Obeid was
  among six players on the national team from Gaza who were turned back at the
  Jordanian border for “security reasons” on their way to a friendly match in
  Mauritania. An Israeli security official said at the time that the players had
  failed to renew special permits allowing them to play in the West Bank. Obeid
  told AFP in 2010: When I heard that we would be forbidden from travelling I
  was very upset, because any athlete dreams of wearing his national jersey in
  international forums. We want to be able to travel freely with our families,
  just like athletes anywhere else in the world. Another major Israeli ground
  operation will almost certainly lead to the killing of more Israeli soldiers
  in hit-and-run attacks, eroding domestic support for the war, and could
  endanger the remaining hostages, as the AP reports. Hamas-led militants killed
  about 1,200 people in the October 2023 attack and abducted 251 hostages, most
  of whom since been released in ceasefires or other deals. Fifty remain in the
  territory, around 20 of whom are believed by Israel to be alive. Palestinian
  militants have released videos in recent days showing emaciated hostages,
  saying they are suffering the same starvation as the Palestinian population.
  Hamas is believed to be holding the hostages in tunnels and other secret
  locations and has hinted it will kill them if Israeli forces draw near. Former
  security officials have also spoken out against further military operations,
  saying there is little to gain after Hamas has been militarily decimated.
  Israel’s military chief of staff, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, reportedly argued during
  the security cabinet meeting that a more sweeping plan to retake all of Gaza
  would endanger the hostages and put added strain on the army after two years
  of regional wars. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid has blasted the
  security cabinet’s Gaza City decision as “a disaster” and said far-right
  ministers Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich dragged the Israeli prime
  minister into something that was “exactly what Hamas wanted”. Lapid also said
  the decision would lead to the deaths of more hostages and many soldiers as
  well as “political collapse”. His post on X reads in full (in a translation):
  The cabinet’s decision tonight is a disaster that will lead to many more
  disasters. In complete contradiction to the opinion of the military and
  security ranks, without considering the erosion and exhaustion of the fighting
  forces, Ben Gvir and Smotrich dragged Netanyahu into a move that will take
  months, lead to the death of the hostages, the killing of many soldiers, cost
  tens of billions to the Israeli taxpayer, and lead to a political collapse.
  This is exactly what Hamas wanted: for Israel to be trapped in the field
  without a goal, without defining the picture of the day after, in a useless
  occupation that no one understands where it is leading. The UK’s ambassador to
  Israel has said extending the war in Gaza would only lead to more deaths and
  that occupying Gaza would be a “huge mistake”. Simon Walters was quoted by
  Israel’s Haaretz newspaper as saying on Thursday: The IDF has achieved all
  that it can achieve in Gaza, and extending the war any further will simply
  lead to more deaths. Deaths of soldiers, deaths of Palestinians, deaths of
  hostages. If you want to defeat Hamas, you cannot achieve that through
  military force. You need to use politics and diplomacy and you need to give
  the people of Gaza an alternative to Hamas. Walters said the UK’s approach to
  the ceasefire proposal set forth by US special envoy Steve Witkoff – for one
  full and comprehensive deal that brings back all hostages – would end the war
  and initiate a new governing body for the Gaza Strip, Haaretz reported.
  Walters said: We are working with friends, allies in Europe and in the Middle
  East to generate a real plan for what happens after the fighting stops, after
  the war. It needs to be a description of what the governments will be for
  Gaza. That has to be governance by Palestinians who are not members of Hamas
  with a role for the Palestinian Authority. Looking at Gaza City – which
  Israel’s security cabinet has earmarked for a military takeover – much of it
  is in ruins. Israel has repeatedly bombarded the city in northern Gaza and it
  launched major ground operations there within weeks of Hamas’s October 2023
  attack that triggered the war. Several neighbourhoods and key infrastructure
  are almost completely destroyed. The Associated Press reports that on the eve
  of the war it was Gaza’s most populous city, home to about 700,000 people.
  Hundreds of thousands fled under Israeli evacuation orders at the start of the
  war but many returned during a ceasefire earlier this year. Israel already
  controls and has largely destroyed around 75% of Gaza, with most of the
  population of some 2 million Palestinians now sheltering in Gaza City, the
  central city of Deir al-Balah and the sprawling displacement camps in the
  Muwasi area along the coast. Australian foreign minister Penny Wong has urged
  Israel not to follow through on its plans to occupy Gaza, a step she said
  could constitute a breach of international law. After Benjamin Netanyahu’s
  office said the Israel Defense Forces would prepare to take over Gaza City,
  Wong pushed back on the plan, telling the Guardian: Australia calls on Israel
  to not go down this path, which will only worsen the humanitarian catastrophe
  in Gaza. Permanent forced displacement is a violation of international law.
  Wong said Australia and international partners were maintaining ongoing calls
  for a ceasefire, the return of hostages and aid to flow unimpeded. A two-state
  solution is the only pathway to secure an enduring peace – a Palestinian state
  and the state of Israel, living side-by-side in peace and security within
  internationally-recognised borders. In announcing the approval of plans to
  take over Gaza City, the office of Benjamin Netanyahu referred to another plan
  that had been submitted to the Israeli security cabinet. A decisive majority
  of security cabinet ministers believed that the alternative plan that had been
  submitted to the security cabinet would neither achieve the defeat of Hamas
  nor the return of the hostages. Israeli media reported that this appeared to
  be referring to a proposal presented by IDF chief of staff, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir,
  who has reportedly warned that occupying Gaza would plunge Israel into a
  “black hole” of prolonged insurgency, humanitarian responsibility and
  heightened risk to hostages. It’s thought that the announcement from the
  security cabinet to take over Gaza City as opposed to the entire territory –
  as Netanyahu pledged on Thursday – could reflect the reservations of Israel’s
  top military officials. After nearly two years of war in Gaza, Benjamin
  Netanyahu faces mounting pressure at home and abroad for a truce deal to pull
  the Palestinian territory’s more than 2 million people back from the brink of
  famine and to spare hostages held by Palestinian militants. Outside the prime
  minister’s office in Jerusalem on Thursday evening, hundreds of demonstrators
  protested against any expansion of the war, demanding an immediate end to the
  military campaign in return for the release of all the hostages. Protesters
  held signs bearing the faces of hostages still held in Gaza and voiced deep
  frustration with the government’s handling of the crisis. “I’m here because I
  am sick and tired of this government. It’s ruined our life,” said 55-year-old
  Noa Starkman, a Jerusalem resident who was born in a southern Israeli
  community close to where Hamas attacked in October 2023. Indonesia will
  convert a medical facility on an uninhabited island to treat about 2,000
  wounded residents of Gaza, according to a spokesperson for the president,
  reports Kate Lamb and agencies. “Indonesia will give medical help for about
  2,000 Gaza residents who became victims of war, those who are wounded, buried
  under debris,” Hasan Nasbi said in Jakarta on Thursday. Indonesia plans to
  allocate the facility on Galang island, home to a former refugee camp for
  Vietnamese asylum seekers which lies off its island of Sumatra, to treat the
  wounded Gaza residents and temporarily shelter their families, the
  spokesperson said. The patients would be taken back to Gaza after they had
  healed, he added, without providing further details on the timing of the plan,
  or how their return would be guaranteed. Muslim-majority Indonesia has sent
  humanitarian aid to Gaza during the war and the announcement follows an Axios
  report in July that the director of Israel’s Mossad spy agency had sought US
  help in convincing several countries – including Indonesia, Libya and Ethiopia
  – to take in hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from Gaza. See the full
  report here: The Axios reporter Barak Ravid has cited an Israeli official as
  saying Israel’s occupation of Gaza City is to involve besieging Hamas fighters
  there while carrying out a ground offensive. Ravid’s post on X says: Senior
  Israeli official tells me: The operation that the IDF is currently preparing
  for is only in Gaza City. The goal is to evacuate all Palestinian civilians
  from Gaza City to the central camps and other areas by October 7. A siege will
  be imposed on the Hamas militants who remain in Gaza City, and at the same
  time, a ground offensive will be carried out in Gaza City. The Prime Minister
  and the Defense Minister have been authorized to approve the IDF’s final
  operational plan The Israeli prime minister’s office also said the “vast
  majority of cabinet ministers believed that the alternative plan presented in
  the cabinet would not achieve the defeat of Hamas nor the return of the
  hostages”. Netanyahu’s office said on X that the security cabinet voted by a
  majority to adopt what he called “the five principles for ending the war”. It
  listed them as (translated from Hebrew): 1. Disarming Hamas of its weapons. 2.
  Return of all hostages – both the living and the deceased. 3. Demilitarization
  of the Gaza Strip. 4. Israeli security control over the Gaza Strip. 5.
  Establishment of an alternative civilian administration that is neither Hamas
  nor the Palestinian Authority. Benjamin Netanyahu’s office has said on social
  media that the Israel Defense Forces will prepare to take over Gaza City and
  to provide aid to civilians outside the areas of fighting. The full post on X
  (translated from Hebrew) reads: The Political-Security Cabinet approved the
  Prime Minister’s proposal for the defeat of Hamas. The IDF will prepare to
  take control of Gaza City while providing humanitarian aid to the civilian
  population outside the combat zones. Welcome to our live coverage of the
  Israel-Gaza war. Benjamin Netanyahu’s office says Israel’s security cabinet
  has approved a plan to take over Gaza City after he earlier said the country
  intended to take full control of the entire Gaza Strip. The decision early on
  Friday marks another escalation of Israel’s offensive in Gaza. Ahead of the
  security cabinet meeting, which began on Thursday and ran through the night,
  Netanyahu said Israel planned to retake control over the whole territory and
  eventually hand it off to friendly Arab forces opposed to Hamas. The announced
  plans stop short of that, perhaps reflecting the reservations of Israel’s top
  general, who reportedly warned that it would endanger the remaining 20 or so
  living hostages held by Hamas and further strain Israel’s army after nearly
  two years of regional wars, the Associated Press reports. Many families of
  hostages are also opposed, fearing further escalation will doom their loved
  ones. A Hamas official was reported as telling the Al Jazeera Mubasher
  television network that the militant group would treat any force formed to
  govern Gaza per Netanyahu’s suggestion as an “occupying” force linked the
  Israel. And in the first reaction by a main Arab neighbour to Netanyahu’s
  comments, a Jordanian official told Reuters that Arabs “will only support what
  Palestinians agree and decide on”. In key developments: Before the security
  cabinet meeting, Netanyahu was asked on Fox News if Israel would “take control
  of all of Gaza” and he replied: “We intend to, in order to assure our
  security, remove Hamas there, enable the population to be free of Gaza.” The
  Israeli prime minister said: “We don’t want to keep it. We want to have a
  security perimeter. We want to hand it over to Arab forces that will govern it
  properly without threatening us and giving Gazans a good life.” Israeli media
  reported that Netanyahu was hoping to obtain approval for fully controlling
  Gaza at the security cabinet meeting. The plan would mean sending ground
  troops into the few areas of the strip that have not been totally destroyed –
  roughly 25% of the territory where many of its 2 million people have sought
  refuge. Israel was reportedly preparing a two-phase operation aimed at seizing
  control of Gaza City, with plans to evacuate about 1 million residents – half
  of Gaza’s population – in what officials described as a temporary measure to
  establish civilian infrastructure in central Gaza. The proposal was being
  framed as a limited operation rather than a full invasion, apparently to
  placate military chiefs wary of long-term occupation, according to Israel’s
  Channel 12. The chief of staff, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, has reportedly warned that
  occupying Gaza would plunge Israel into a “black hole” of prolonged
  insurgency, humanitarian responsibility and heightened risk to hostages. At
  least 42 Palestinians were killed in Israeli airstrikes and shootings across
  southern Gaza on Thursday, according to local hospitals. Of the 42, at least
  13 were seeking aid in an Israeli military zone in southern Gaza where UN aid
  convoys are regularly overwhelmed by looters and desperate crowds. The World
  Health Organization said on Thursday that 99 people were known to have died
  from malnutrition in Gaza this year and the figure was probably an
  underestimate, amid famine warnings from UN agencies. The families of the
  roughly 20 remaining living hostages held in Gaza have called for Israelis to
  protest against the government and a decision they fear would endanger the
  lives of their loved ones.

We’re closing this blog now – thanks for following along. You can read our latest story here: Israel’s plan to take control of Gaza City marks “a dangerous escalation” that risks “deepening the already catastrophic consequences for millions of Palestinians”, the UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres said. That decision “will result in additional forced displacement, killings and massive destruction, compounding the unimaginable suffering of the Palestinian population in Gaza,” a statement from the UN chief’s spokesperson added. The UN Security Council will meet in a rare weekend session on Saturday to discuss the situation. The meeting at 7pm GMT had been requested by several members of the security council as global concern mounts over Israel’s plan. The German government will not approve any exports of military equipment that could be used in the Gaza Strip until further notice, chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Friday in response to Israel’s plan to expand its military operations there. Netanyahu accused the German government of “rewarding Hamas terrorism”. The move is hugely significant from Germany, which believes it has a special responsibility towards Israel and is its second-largest arms supplier after the US. France joined the chorus of countries including among others the UK, China, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, condemning the Israeli plan, saying it would “worsen an already catastrophic situation without enabling the release of Hamas hostages, its disarmament, or its surrender”. France’s ministry of foreign affairs has issued a press release, condemning the plan “in the strongest terms”. It reads: “These actions would constitute further serious violations of international law and lead to an absolute stalemate. They would undermine the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinians to live in peace in a viable, sovereign, and contiguous state, and pose a threat to regional stability.” The ministry added that Israel’s plans would “in no way” contribute to the security of Israelis, including the remaining hostages in Gaza. The future of Gaza should be through a “framework of a future Palestinian state led by the Palestinian Authority”, it said. Israel’s decision to take over Gaza City “must have consequences for EU-Israel relations”, EU Council president Antonio Costa said on Friday, adding that this will be assessed by the Council and that he urged the Israeli government to reconsider. Hamas warned the Israeli government that seizing control of Gaza City would amount to “sacrificing” the hostages still being held in the Palestinian territory. The group said: “The decision to occupy Gaza confirms that the criminal [Israeli prime minister Benjamin] Netanyahu and his Nazi government do not care about the fate of their captives.” Former Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert told CNN that Israel’s plan to take control of Gaza City won’t save the remaining hostages, but will rather endanger lives and “increase the number of crimes” in the territory. He told CNN today that an expanded military operation “is not going to save the hostages, is going to cost the lives of many soldiers, and is going to cost the lives of many non-involved Palestinians”. Olmert, was prime minister from 2006 to 2009, blamed the decision on Benjamin Netanyahu’s struggle to hold together his government. Former Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert has said that Israel’s plan to take control of Gaza City won’t save the remaining hostages, but will rather endanger lives and “increase the number of crimes” in the territory. He told CNN today that an expanded military operation “is not going to save the hostages, is going to cost the lives of many soldiers, and is going to cost the lives of many non-involved Palestinians”. “It will increase the number of crimes which will be committed not as part of a policy. There is no policy of committing crimes or of genocide or anything like that,” he said. “But this is the nature of this operation.” Olmert, was prime minister from 2006 to 2009, said ending the war would save the hostages still being held in Gaza and other victims. He blamed the decision on Benjamin Netanyahu’s struggle to hold together his government. The prime minister personally is captive of a group of messianic partners in the coalition government which holds the tide. And they threaten that if the decision will be different, they will break down the government. This is the universal consensus in Israel today that this is a political expediency. There is no question about it. Last month, Olmert told my colleague Emma Graham-Harrison that the so-called “humanitarian city” Israel’s defence minister has proposed building on the ruins of Rafah would be a concentration camp, and forcing Palestinians inside would be ethnic cleansing. We now have confirmation of AFP’s report that the United Nations Security Council will indeed meet on Saturday, according to its schedule released today, after Israel’s security cabinet approved a widely condemned plan to take control of Gaza City. Ambassador Riyad Mansour, permanent observer of the State of Palestine to the United Nations, had earlier said a number of countries would be requesting a meeting of the UN Security Council on Israel’s plans. The meeting will take place at 7pm GMT on Saturday, the schedule says. The US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, has launched an undiplomatic attack on Keir Starmer by invoking the allied second world war bombing of Dresden after the British prime minister criticised the Israeli security cabinet’s decision to expand the war in Gaza. “So Israel is expected to surrender to Hamas &amp; feed them even though Israeli hostages are being starved?” Huckabee wrote on social media (repeating the un-evidenced Israeli government talking point that Hamas is stealing aid meant for civilians). He was responding to a post by Starmer calling for an immediate ceasefire and lamenting the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, as well as the fate of the remaining Israeli hostages being held by Hamas. Provocatively, Huckabee, who has a history of making intemperate comments in Israel’s favour, added: Did UK surrender to Nazis and drop food to them? Ever heard of Dresden, PM Starmer? That wasn’t food you dropped. If you had been PM then UK would be speaking German! The bombing of Dresden by the RAF and US air force in February 1945 is believed to have killed tens of thousands of civilians. It remains one of the most controversial allied acts of the second world war, amid questions marks over its strategic necessity and the widespread destruction in civilian areas. You can read Robert’s full piece here: Further to the French foreign minister’s comments I brought you a little while ago, France’s ministry of foreign affairs has issued a press release, condemning “in the strongest terms” the Israeli government’s plans to take control of Gaza City. It reads: These actions would constitute further serious violations of international law and lead to an absolute stalemate. They would undermine the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinians to live in peace in a viable, sovereign, and contiguous state, and pose a threat to regional stability. The ministry added that Israel’s plans would “in no way” contribute to the security of Israelis, including the remaining hostages in Gaza. The future of Gaza should be through a “framework of a future Palestinian state led by the Palestinian Authority”, it said. In July, Emmanuel Macron said that France will recognize a Palestinian state in September. France has joined the chorus of countries strongly condemning Israel’s plan to occupy Gaza City, saying it would “worsen an already catastrophic situation without enabling the release of Hamas hostages, its disarmament, or its surrender”. In a post on X, the French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, wrote: France strongly condemns the Israeli government’s plan aimed at preparing for the complete occupation of Gaza. Such an operation would worsen an already catastrophic situation without enabling the release of Hamas hostages, its disarmament, or its surrender. The United Nations Security Council will meet in a rare weekend session on Saturday to discuss Israel’s plan to take control of Gaza City, three diplomatic sources have told Agence France-Presse. The meeting at 7pm GMT had been requested by several members of the security council, a member of the council told AFP, as global concern mounts over Israel’s plan. United Nations secretary-general António Guterres has criticized Israel’s plan to take control of Gaza City, with the UN chief’s spokesperson saying the decision marked “a dangerous escalation” that risks “deepening the already catastrophic consequences for millions of Palestinians”. That decision “will result in additional forced displacement, killings and massive destruction, compounding the unimaginable suffering of the Palestinian population in Gaza,” the statement added. Guterres also posted a statement on X: I’m gravely alarmed by the decision of the Israeli Government to “take control of Gaza City”. This marks a dangerous escalation &amp; risks deepening the already catastrophic consequences for millions of Palestinians. It could further endanger more lives, including of the remaining hostages. I reiterate my urgent appeal for a permanent ceasefire, unimpeded humanitarian access across Gaza &amp; the immediate &amp; unconditional release of all hostages. It follows the UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, saying earlier today that “the Israeli government’s plan for a complete military takeover of the occupied Gaza Strip must be immediately halted”. In a statement, Türk said: It runs contrary to the ruling of the International Court of Justice that Israel must bring its occupation to an end as soon as possible, to the realisation of the agreed two-state solution and to the right of Palestinians to self-determination. The plan triggered global condemnation, with China, Turkey, Britain and numerous Arab governments issuing statements of concern. Displaced repeatedly. Forced to live in tent camps or amid the ruins of their homes. Stricken by hunger and deprived of medical supplies. Now, 22 months into the war, around a million Palestinians are bracing for another catastrophe after the Israeli security cabinet’s decision to take control of the entire Gaza Strip. Such an offensive would force them toward the south of the enclave, and an uncertain future. “Since this morning, after hearing the news of evacuation of Gaza City, I have been been feeling anxious and afraid,’’ said Umm Ibrahim Banat, a 55-year-old mother, originally from northern Gaza, who has already been displaced four times. ‘‘Where will we go with the children and the elderly? I swear we are exhausted from displacement, starvation, and being driven from one place to another.” “Now,” she said, “We are the walking dead.’’ Following a 10-hour overnight meeting, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office announced on Friday that his security cabinet had approved a plan to take over Gaza City, marking another escalation of Israel’s offensive that has killed at least 61,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians. According to Israel’s Channel 12 the plan, which would mean sending ground troops into the territory, could displace tens of thousands of people and further disrupt efforts to deliver food to the territory and force approximately 1 million Palestinians in Gaza City and other areas into evacuation areas in the southern part of the enclave. “Gaza has been completely destroyed – what more can they do?”, said Banat, whose daughter Maryam was killed with her husband and children. “We have lost the best of our youth; our territory is a huge prison besieged by land, sea, and air; the destruction has become unbearable; diseases are spreading, tents stretch as far as the eye can see, water is contaminated, prices are insane, hospitals are in ruins, our lives are utterly tragic! What more do they want?” The US and UK have “disagreements” on Gaza including over whether to recognise a Palestinian state, JD Vance has suggested as he arrived in England for his summer holiday. The US vice-president was speaking ahead of a bilateral meeting with David Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, at his 17th-century grace-and-favour country house, Chevening. His remarks on Gaza marked a note of discord in what otherwise appeared to be a convivial meeting between the two politicians, who have struck up an unlikely friendship. The pair have bonded over their Christian faith and difficult childhoods. Before speaking to reporters on Friday afternoon, Lammy and Vance were filmed fishing for carp together in a pond near Chevening House. Expressing his love for the UK and describing Lammy as a “good friend” and “gracious host”, Vance joked that their varying degrees of success in the carp pond was the “one strain on the special relationship”. “All of my kids caught fish, but the foreign secretary did not,” he said. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu told German chancellor Friedrich Merz that Israel’s goal is not to take over Gaza, but to free Gaza from Hamas and enable a peaceful government to be established there, the prime minister’s office said on X. Netanyahu expressed his disappointment with Berlin’s decision to suspend weapons exports to Israel during the phone call with Merz on Friday, the office added. Palestinians on the street following an Israeli attack on the ez-Zeytun neighborhood in Gaza City today… The German government will not approve any exports of military equipment that could be used in the Gaza Strip until further notice, chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Friday in response to Israel’s plan to expand its military operations there. Israel’s decision to take over Gaza City “must have consequences for EU-Israel relations”, EU Council president Antonio Costa said on Friday, adding that this will be assessed by the Council and that he urged the Israeli government to reconsider. Despite the announcement of the Israeli plan, mediators from Egypt and Qatar are working on a new framework which will include the release of all hostages — dead and alive — in one go in return for an end of the war in Gaza and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the strip, two Arab officials told the Associated Press anonymously. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid blasted the security cabinet’s Gaza City decision as “a disaster that will lead to many more disasters” and said far-right ministers Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich had dragged Benjamin Netanyahu into something that was “exactly what Hamas wanted”. Lapid said the decision would lead to the deaths of more hostages and many soldiers as well as “political collapse”. Hamas said in a statement that “Netanyahu’s plans to escalate the aggression confirm beyond any doubt his desire to get rid of the captives and sacrifice them in pursuit of his personal interests and extremist ideological agenda”. And in the first reaction by a main Arab neighbour to Netanyahu’s comments on taking over Gaza, a Jordanian official told Reuters that Arabs “will only support what Palestinians agree and decide on”. Norway’s $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund will announce changes to the handling of its Israeli investments, finance minister Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday, ruling out any blanket withdrawal over the war in Gaza. The fund itself said it would provide an update on its Israeli investments on Tuesday. David Lammy said he would be discussing the “developing situation in Gaza” and the ongoing war in Ukraine with JD Vance. Sitting alongside the US vice-president at the start of a bilateral meeting at Chevening House, the UK foreign secretary said: “Of course we will be discussing the developing situation in Gaza, which is a great concern, and of course the ongoing war in Ukraine, and the desire to see that come to an end.” Saudi Arabia condemns any Israeli move to take control of Gaza, the foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday. The kingdom “categorically denounces Israeli occupation authorities’ persistence in committing crimes of starvation, brutal practices, and ethnic cleansing against the brotherly Palestinian people,” it said in a statement. An Israeli airstrike on eastern Lebanon killed a number of people, including a senior member of a Palestinian group and his bodyguard as they were on their way to Syria, news reports and his group said on Friday, according to the Associated Press (AP). China expressed “serious concerns” on Friday over Israel’s plan to take control of Gaza City, urging it to “immediately cease its dangerous actions”. “Gaza belongs to the Palestinian people and is an inseparable part of Palestinian territory,” a foreign ministry spokesperson told Agence France-Presse (AFP) in a message. Turkey has urged the international community to prevent Israel’s plan to take control of Gaza City, saying it was a “heavy blow” to peace and security. “We call on the international community to fulfil its responsibilities to prevent the implementation of this decision, which aims to forcibly displace Palestinians from their own land,” the foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday, reports Reuters. Israel’s decision to intensify its military operation in Gaza is wrong and should immediately be reversed, Danish foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen told Denmark’s TV2 on Friday. Jordan also condemned Israel’s decision to take control of Gaza City. Hamas warned the Israeli government on Friday that seizing control of Gaza City would amount to “sacrificing” the hostages still being held in the Palestinian territory. The group said: “The decision to occupy Gaza confirms that the criminal [Israeli prime minister Benjamin] Netanyahu and his Nazi government do not care about the fate of their captives.” More than a hundred UK-based Israelis and allies led by the grassroots activist group Mi-neged staged a protest outside the Foreign Office on Thursday evening, calling for the UK to impose immediate sanctions on Israel and end the war in Gaza. Hundreds of demonstrators outside Netanyahu’s office in Jerusalem on Thursday evening protested against any expansion of the war, demanding an immediate end to the military campaign in return for the release of all hostages. Israel’s decision to take over Gaza City “must have consequences for EU-Israel relations”, EU Council president Antonio Costa said on Friday, adding that this will be assessed by the Council and that he urged the Israeli government to reconsider. “Not only [does the decision] violate the agreement with the EU announced by the High Representative on July 19 but also undermines fundamental principles of international law and universal values,” Costa, who heads the European Council that represents EU member states, added in his statement on X. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Fox News in an interview that aired on Thursday that the military intended to take control of all of Gaza. The announcement from the prime minister’s office early on Friday after Thursday’s security cabinet meeting said the military would take Gaza City, but did not say if Israeli forces would take all of the enclave. Israel’s cabinet is expected to endorse the Gaza City plan. Norway’s $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund will announce changes to the handling of its Israeli investments, finance minister Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday, ruling out any blanket withdrawal over the war in Gaza. The fund itself said it would provide an update on its Israeli investments on Tuesday. The government this week launched an urgent review of the investments over ethics concerns linked to the war in Gaza and the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. “I see several measures over time, but what can be addressed quickly, must be done quickly,” Stoltenberg told a press conference after holding his second meeting with fund officials in three days. He did not say what these measures could be, but added that there would not be a wholesale divestment from all Israeli companies. “If we did that, it would mean we are divesting from them because they are Israeli,” he said. US vice-president JD Vance said the US has “no plans” to recognise a state of Palestine during a bilateral meeting with foreign secretary David Lammy at Chevening House. He said: “Obviously the United Kingdom’s going to make its decision. We have no plans to recognise a Palestinian state. “I don’t know what it would mean to really recognise a Palestinian state, given the lack of functional government there.” He added that the US government’s two goals are “very simple”, saying: “Number one, it’s we want to make it so that Hamas cannot attack innocent Israeli civilians ever again, and we think that has to come through the eradication of Hamas. “Second, the president has been very moved by these terrible images of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, so we want to make sure that we solve that problem. “I think all of us can work on how to solve that problem. Obviously, it’s not an easy problem to solve, or it would have already been dealt with, but we share, I think, that focus and that goal. We may have some disagreements about how exactly to accomplish that goal, and we’ll talk about that today.” More than a hundred UK-based Israelis and allies led by the grassroots activist group Mi-neged staged a protest outside the Foreign Office on Thursday evening, calling for the UK to impose immediate sanctions on Israel and end the war in Gaza. As civil servants and politicians left the Cabinet Office after work, 98 demonstrators raised 98 red and black globes and a large sign that read: “You let Israel murder 98 today. Each person is a world.” Other signs read “Israelis against genocide” and “stop arming Israel”. Mi-neged recently sent UK prime minister Keir Starmer and foreign secretary David Lammy a letter signed by more than 200 Israeli citizens living in the UK. A Mi-neged spokesperson said: Keir Starmer says the UK might act in September. Yet every single day that passes we hear of more people killed by Israel in Gaza. Some by plane, some by bullet, some by engineered starvation. Today it was 98 Palestinians. It is impossible to fully comprehend the scale of this human-made tragedy. We’ve come here today to physically represent this unconscionable number and to remind our representatives that every single one of those murdered in Gaza is an entire universe, as full, complex and real as they are. For more than 60,000 people it is already too late. Starmer’s ‘threat’ that the UK will recognise Palestine has unsurprisingly had no effect, and Israel is only talking of ramping up its horrific assault with a full-blown occupation of Gaza. The UK must take immediate action to sanction Israel in ways that would impose a real cost in order to stop its genocidal destruction of Gaza and its people, and the ethnic cleansing of the West Bank. David Lammy said he would be discussing the “developing situation in Gaza” and the ongoing war in Ukraine with JD Vance. Sitting alongside the US vice-president at the start of a bilateral meeting at Chevening House, the UK foreign secretary said: Of course we will be discussing the developing situation in Gaza, which is a great concern, and of course the ongoing war in Ukraine, and the desire to see that come to an end. In a statement about the latest decision from the Israeli government, the independent MP, and former Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn has restated his claim that the UK is “complicit in genocide”. Corbyn said: If the government was truly horrified by Israel’s occupation of Gaza, it would stop supplying them with the weapons they need to carry it out. The prime minister can condemn Israel’s plans all he wants. He cannot hide the truth: his government is complicit in genocide. Belgian foreign minister Maxime Prévot said on X that the Israeli ambassador had been summoned to express “our total disapproval of this decision”. In a statement published to the social media site on Friday, Prévot said: Following the Israeli government’s official confirmation of its intention to subsequently surround and occupy the city of Gaza, and take military control of the entire Gaza Strip, I have decided to summon the Israeli ambassador. The aim is clearly to express our total disapproval of this decision, but also of the continued colonisation, in particular the resumption of the E1 project east of Jerusalem, and the desire to annex the West Bank as was recently promoted by the Knesset. All of these actions, with a potential to wipe Palestine completely off the map, are unacceptable and contrary to international law, United Nations resolutions and the decisions of the International Court of Justice. They also pose a major risk to the Israeli hostages still being held. We must therefore vigorously advocate for a reversal of these plans, which would permanently compromise any prospect of a ceasefire and a peaceful and lasting two-state solution, which Belgium has been insisting on for months, not to mention full free access by land for humanitarian aid. While it is legitimate to want to destroy the terrorist group Hamas, this cannot be achieved through disproportionate operations that will further lengthen the already very long list of Palestinian civilian victims. Germany will not authorise any exports of military equipment that could be used in Gaza “until further notice”, Chancellor Friedrich Merz has announced. It was a quick response by one of Israel’s strongest international backers to a decision by prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s cabinet to take over Gaza City. The move by Germany, which had previously stopped short of tougher lines against Israel’s government taken by some of its European Union allies, appears likely to further isolate Israel over the military takeover plan which has been condemned by the United Nations and supporters of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza. In a statement, Merz emphasised that Israel “has the right to defend itself against Hamas’s terror” and said the release of Israeli hostages and “purposeful” negotiations towards a ceasefire in the 22-month conflict “are our top priority”. He added that Hamas must not have a role in the future of Gaza. Saudi Arabia condemns any Israeli move to take control of Gaza, the foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday. The kingdom “categorically denounces Israeli occupation authorities’ persistence in committing crimes of starvation, brutal practices, and ethnic cleansing against the brotherly Palestinian people,” it said in a statement. Palestinians in Gaza expressed fear, frustration and exhaustion on Thursday after the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said he wanted Israel to take military control of the entire Gaza Strip. Those displaced by the fighting shared their opinions hours after Netanyahu told Fox News that Israel intended to take over the entire territory for security purposes but did not plan to govern it long-term. He said the aim would be to eventually hand over control to Arab forces, though he gave no specifics on what that could entail. Hamas warned the Israeli government on Friday that seizing control of Gaza City would amount to “sacrificing” the hostages still being held in the Palestinian territory. The group said: “The decision to occupy Gaza confirms that the criminal [Israeli prime minister Benjamin] Netanyahu and his Nazi government do not care about the fate of their captives.” Hamas added: They understand that expanding the aggression means sacrificing them. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has called for the Gaza City takeover plan to be “reconsidered”, urging the release of hostages and immediate delivery of humanitarian aid to the territory. In a post on X, she said: The Israeli government’s decision to further extend its military operation in Gaza must be reconsidered. At the same time, there must be the release of all hostages, who are being held in inhumane conditions. And humanitarian aid must be given immediate and unhindered access to Gaza to deliver what is urgently needed on the ground. A ceasefire is needed now. Despite the announcement of the Israeli plan, mediators from Egypt and Qatar are working on a new framework which will include the release of all hostages — dead and alive — in one go in return for an end of the war in Gaza and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the strip, two Arab officials told the Associated Press anonymously. The yet-to-be finalized framework aims to address the contentious issue of what to do with Hamas’ weapons, with Israel seeking full disarmament and Hamas refusing. One official, who is directly involved in the efforts, said discussions are underway about “freezing arms,” which may involve Hamas retaining but not using its weapons. It also calls for the group to relinquish power in the strip. A Palestinian-Arab committee would run Gaza and oversee the reconstruction efforts until the establishment of a Palestinian administration with a new police force, trained by two US allies in the Middle East, to take over the strip, he said. It is unclear what role the Western-backed Palestinian Authority would play. A senior Hamas official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to brief the media, said the group’s leadership has been aware of the Arab mediators’ efforts to revive the ceasefire talks, but has yet to receive details. Associated Press reached out to the governments in Qatar, Egypt and Israel for comment. Israel’s decision to intensify its military operation in Gaza is wrong and should immediately be reversed, Danish foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen told Denmark’s TV2 on Friday. Jordan also condemned Israel’s decision to take control of Gaza City. Israel’s plan to intensify operations in Gaza is “a wrong move”, Dutch foreign minister Caspar Veldkamp said on Friday. Veldkamp said in a statement on X: The plan of the Netanyahu government to intensify Israeli operations in Gaza is a wrong move. The [Gaza] humanitarian situation is catastrophic and demands immediate improvement. This decision in no way contributes to this and will also not help to get the hostages home. Hamas described the Israeli government’s plan to take control of Gaza City as a “new war crime” on Friday, warning the operation would cost it “dearly”. According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), the group said in a statement: The Zionist cabinet’s approval of plans to occupy Gaza City and evacuate its residents constitutes a new war crime that the occupation army intends to commit against the city. We warn the criminal occupation that this criminal adventure will cost it dearly and will not be an easy journey. The German government will not approve any exports of military equipment that could be used in the Gaza Strip until further notice, chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Friday in response to Israel’s plan to expand its military operations there. Merz said it was Israel’s right to disarm Hamas and to seek the release of the Israeli hostages but “the German government believes that the even tougher military action in the Gaza Strip decided upon by the Israeli cabinet last night makes it increasingly difficult to see how these goals can be achieved”. According to Reuters, Merz said in a statement: Under these circumstances, the German government will not approve any exports of military equipment that could be used in the Gaza Strip until further notice. The release of the hostages and negotiations for a ceasefire are Germany’s top priorities, Merz said, expressing deep concern over the suffering of civilians in the Gaza Strip. Germany’s parliament said in June that export licences for military equipment to Israel worth €485m ($564m) were granted between 7 October 2023 and 13 May 2025, reports Reuters. Spain has condemned the Israeli government’s decision to escalate its military occupation of Gaza. According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), Spanish foreign minister José Manuel Albares said: We firmly condemn the decision of the Israeli government to escalate the military occupation of Gaza. It will only cause more destruction and suffering.” He added that “a permanent ceasefire, the immediate and massive entry of humanitarian aid, and the release of all hostages are urgently needed”. An Israeli airstrike on eastern Lebanon killed a number of people, including a senior member of a Palestinian group and his bodyguard as they were on their way to Syria, news reports and his group said on Friday, according to the Associated Press (AP). The Thursday afternoon airstrike near the Lebanese border crossing of Masnaa killed Mohammed Wishah, a member of the central committee of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), the group said in a statement. There was no immediate comment from Israel. “We have lost two of the most loyal comrades who gave their precious souls to freedom,” Marwan Abdel-Al, a senior PFLP official, wrote in a post on social media about the death of Wishah and his bodyguard, Mufid Hussein. According to the AP, a PFLP official said Wishah had been in Lebanon to meet other officials with the group and was on his way back to Syria when the airstrike happened. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the media. The PFLP statement said Wishah was born in the Gaza Strip in 1954 and spent five years in Israeli jails shortly after he joined the Palestinian group in 1973. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said the airstrike on east Lebanon killed six people and injured 10, without identifying the victims. Additionally, on Friday morning, an Israeli drone strike hit a car in a coastal highway in south Lebanon killing citizen journalist Mohammed Shehadeh, the NNA said. The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) accused Israeli forces of targeting a group of Palestinian civilians waiting to receive aid in Gaza yesterday and killing one of its staff members. In a post on X on Thursday, the PRCS wrote: Today, our colleague Ashraf Suleiman Eid Yousef (44), a staff member in the administrative services department at the Sarayah field hospital in Gaza City, was killed after Israeli forces targeted a group of civilians while they were waiting to receive aid in the Kisufim area, east of the central governorate. This brings the total number of PRCS team members killed to 53. The Guardian has been unable to independently verify this report. The Green party has also called for the end of all UK arms sales to Israel. Ellie Chowns, the Green MP and a candidate to be co-leader in the current leadership contest, posted this on social media: [Benjamin] Netanyahu’s brutal plan to take control of Gaza is yet another declaration of intent to commit war crimes. The UK must do more than express disapproval: end military cooperation and arms sales, recognise Palestine, demand an immediate ceasefire and accountability for war crimes. The international charity ActionAid UK said on Friday that it was “deeply alarmed” by the Israeli government’s plan to take control of Gaza City, describing it as a “horrifying escalation”. Hannah Bond, the co-CEO of ActionAid UK, said: We are deeply alarmed that the Israeli government has decided to push ahead with its plan to take control of Gaza City, which clearly violates international humanitarian law. This horrifying escalation will forcibly displace hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who are already experiencing starvation and have nowhere else to flee, and will inevitably result in even more bloodshed. The UK government has condemned this decision but it should know by now that words are not enough to stop the Israeli authorities from pursuing a course of destruction. It needs to take real tangible action immediately: that includes halting all arms exports to the Israeli government and imposing further sanctions. If third states delay any longer, there will be nothing of Gaza left. Scotland’s first minister, John Swinney, said the Israeli government’s decision to occupy Gaza City will “create even more human suffering”. In a post on X, he wrote: The decision of the Israeli government to seize control of Gaza City is completely and utterly unacceptable. It will create even more human suffering for the Palestinian people and further escalate the conflict. The international community must stop Israel and secure a ceasefire. China expressed “serious concerns” on Friday over Israel’s plan to take control of Gaza City, urging it to “immediately cease its dangerous actions”. “Gaza belongs to the Palestinian people and is an inseparable part of Palestinian territory,” a foreign ministry spokesperson told Agence France-Presse (AFP) in a message. “The correct way to ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and to secure the release of hostages is an immediate ceasefire,” they added. “A complete resolution to the Gaza conflict hinges on a ceasefire; only then can a path to de-escalation be paved and regional security ensured,” the spokesperson said. Beijing said on Friday it was “willing to work together with the international community to help end the fighting in Gaza as soon as possible”. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has accused the Israeli government of sentencing the remaining living Israeli hostages and captives in Gaza “to death”, reports the Times of Israel. In a statement in reaction to the Israeli security cabinet’s plan to take over Gaza City, the group said: Tonight, the Israeli government sentenced the living hostages to death and the fallen hostages to disappearance. The cabinet decision to launch the process of occupying the [Gaza] Strip is an official declaration of the abandonment of the hostages, while completely ignoring the repeated warnings by the military echelon and the clear desire of most of the public in Israel. According to the Israeli online newspaper, the Forum’s statement also accuses the government of acting against the national interest with a “foolish” move of “deception and unforgivable moral and security neglect” that brings Israel closer to a “colossal disaster for the hostages and [IDF] fighters”. The group added that it was not too late and that the plan could be stopped, with the government seeking a deal to end the war and return all the hostages. The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, has said it was “increasingly clear” that Benjamin Netanyahu’s “goal is ethnic cleansing” in Gaza and urged the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, to stop the export of all UK arms to Israel and sanction the Israeli PM. Davey said: Netanyahu’s plans to occupy the whole of Gaza are utterly abhorrent – and it’s increasingly clear that his goal is ethnic cleansing. This plan will only serve to wreak more devastation on the lives of millions of Gazans – whose homes and communities have already been destroyed – while endangering the lives of those hostages still held by Hamas. Rather than sitting on its hands and issuing strongly worded statements, the UK government needs to take decisive action. Keir Starmer needs to stop the export of all UK arms to Israel – today – and sanction Netanyahu and his cabinet. Turkey has urged the international community to prevent Israel’s plan to take control of Gaza City, saying it was a “heavy blow” to peace and security. “We call on the international community to fulfil its responsibilities to prevent the implementation of this decision, which aims to forcibly displace Palestinians from their own land,” the foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday, reports Reuters. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, said on Friday that “the Israeli government’s plan for a complete military takeover of the occupied Gaza Strip must be immediately halted”. In a statement, Türk said: It runs contrary to the ruling of the International Court of Justice that Israel must bring its occupation to an end as soon as possible, to the realisation of the agreed two-state solution and to the right of Palestinians to self-determination. Finland’s foreign minister Elina Valtonen said she was “extremely worried” by the looming famine in Gaza. According to Reuters, Valtonen said: We hope for an immediate Gaza ceasefire and the immediate release of Israeli hostages. UK prime minister Keir Starmer on Friday said Israel’s decision to further escalate its offensive in Gaza is wrong and urged the Israeli government to reconsider. In a statement, Starmer said: The Israeli government’s decision to further escalate its offensive in Gaza is wrong, and we urge it to reconsider immediately. This action will do nothing to bring an end to this conflict or to help secure the release of the hostages. It will only bring more bloodshed. Every day the humanitarian crisis in Gaza worsens and hostages taken by Hamas are being held in appalling and inhuman conditions. What we need is a ceasefire, a surge in humanitarian aid, the release of all hostages by Hamas and a negotiated solution. Hamas can play no part in the future of Gaza and must leave as well as disarm. Together with our allies, we are working on a long-term plan to secure peace in the region as part of a two-state solution, and ultimately achieve a brighter future for Palestinians and Israelis. But without both sides engaging in good faith in negotiations, that prospect is vanishing before our eyes. Our message is clear: a diplomatic solution is possible, but both parties must step away from the path of destruction. In additional comments, this time to Sky News, Fahnbulleh said: We think that the decision is the wrong decision. We think that it will risk escalating an already intolerable situation, and the consequence will be more bloodshed. There’s no one that can see what is happening and unfolding in Gaza that isn’t horrified by it. Our priority is, in order to try and get a ceasefire, we’ve got to get parties around the table. I know it feels incredibly hard given the current situation, but it has to be the priority. The UK hopes Israel will reconsider its decision to take control of Gaza City, a junior energy minister said on Friday, reports Reuters. Miatta Fahnbulleh told Times Radio: We think that decision is the wrong decision, and we hope that the Israeli government will reconsider it. It risks escalating an already intolerable and atrocious situation. The Times of Israel reports that Yair Golan, the leader of the Democrats party, has said that Benjamin Netanyahu and the security cabinet’s decision means that “more hostages will be abandoned to their deaths”. Of the Israeli prime minister, he said: He is weak, easily pressured, lacking decision-making ability, and without the capacity to bridge between what the professional level presents and the group of messianists controlling the government. Golan described the decision as “a disaster for generations”. Speaking to the Israeli Army Radio, Golan said: Our sons and grandsons will still patrol the alleys of Gaza, we will pay hundreds of billions over the years, and all this for reasons of political survival and messianic visions. Asking how the government plans to demilitarize the Gaza Strip, he added: Are we going to crawl through tunnels and retrieve the last Kalashnikovs? Here’s a recap of the latest news after Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the Israeli security cabinet had approved a plan to take over Gaza City, marking another escalation of Israel’s offensive in the Gaza Strip. The decision – early on Friday during a marathon meeting – came after the Israeli prime minister said Israel intended to take full control of Gaza and eventually hand it over to friendly Arab forces opposed to Hamas. It is thought that the security cabinet’s decision to take over Gaza City as opposed to the entire territory could reflect the reservations of Israel’s top military officials. In key developments: Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid blasted the security cabinet’s Gaza City decision as “a disaster that will lead to many more disasters” and said far-right ministers Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich had dragged Benjamin Netanyahu into something that was “exactly what Hamas wanted”. Lapid said the decision would lead to the deaths of more hostages and many soldiers as well as “political collapse”. In announcing the Gaza City takeover plan, Netanyahu’s office referred to another plan submitted to the Israeli security cabinet but said most of the ministers believed it “would neither achieve the defeat of Hamas nor the return of the hostages”. Israeli media reported that this appeared to be referring to a proposal presented by Israeli military chief of staff, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, who has reportedly warned that occupying Gaza would plunge Israel into a “black hole” of prolonged insurgency, humanitarian responsibility and heightened risk to hostages. Hamas said in a statement that “Netanyahu’s plans to escalate the aggression confirm beyond any doubt his desire to get rid of the captives and sacrifice them in pursuit of his personal interests and extremist ideological agenda”. And in the first reaction by a main Arab neighbour to Netanyahu’s comments on taking over Gaza, a Jordanian official told Reuters that Arabs “will only support what Palestinians agree and decide on”. Hundreds of demonstrators outside Netanyahu’s office in Jerusalem on Thursday evening protested against any expansion of the war, demanding an immediate end to the military campaign in return for the release of all hostages. Before the security cabinet meeting, Netanyahu was asked on Fox News if Israel would “take control of all of Gaza” and he replied: “We intend to, in order to assure our security, remove Hamas there, enable the population to be free of Gaza.” He also said: “We don’t want to keep it. We want to have a security perimeter. We want to hand it over to Arab forces that will govern it properly without threatening us and giving Gazans a good life.” Israeli media reported that Netanyahu had been hoping to obtain approval for fully controlling Gaza at the security cabinet meeting. The plan would have meant sending ground troops into the few areas of the strip that have not been totally destroyed – roughly 25% of the territory where many of its 2 million people have sought refuge. Israel was reportedly preparing a two-phase operation aimed at seizing control of Gaza City, with plans to evacuate about 1 million residents – half of Gaza’s population – in what officials described as a temporary measure to establish civilian infrastructure in central Gaza. At least 42 Palestinians were killed in Israeli airstrikes and shootings across southern Gaza on Thursday, according to local hospitals. Of the 42, at least 13 were seeking aid in an Israeli military zone in southern Gaza where UN aid convoys are regularly overwhelmed by looters and desperate crowds. Former Palestine national team player Suleiman al-Obeid, known as the “Palestinian Pele”, has been killed by Israeli gunfire in the Gaza Strip, the sport’s local governing body said. Obeid, 41, was killed when Israeli forces “targeted people waiting for humanitarian aid in the southern Gaza Strip” on Wednesday, the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) said. Agence France-Presse reports that Obeid – an ex-star of the Khadamat Al-Shati club in Gaza – played 24 international matches for team Palestine, the PFA said. During his long career, Al-Obeid scored more than 100 goals, making him one of the brightest stars of Palestinian football. The midfielder also played for the Al-Amari youth centre club in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967. While living there in 2010, Obeid was among six players on the national team from Gaza who were turned back at the Jordanian border for “security reasons” on their way to a friendly match in Mauritania. An Israeli security official said at the time that the players had failed to renew special permits allowing them to play in the West Bank. Obeid told AFP in 2010: When I heard that we would be forbidden from travelling I was very upset, because any athlete dreams of wearing his national jersey in international forums. We want to be able to travel freely with our families, just like athletes anywhere else in the world. Another major Israeli ground operation will almost certainly lead to the killing of more Israeli soldiers in hit-and-run attacks, eroding domestic support for the war, and could endanger the remaining hostages, as the AP reports. Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people in the October 2023 attack and abducted 251 hostages, most of whom since been released in ceasefires or other deals. Fifty remain in the territory, around 20 of whom are believed by Israel to be alive. Palestinian militants have released videos in recent days showing emaciated hostages, saying they are suffering the same starvation as the Palestinian population. Hamas is believed to be holding the hostages in tunnels and other secret locations and has hinted it will kill them if Israeli forces draw near. Former security officials have also spoken out against further military operations, saying there is little to gain after Hamas has been militarily decimated. Israel’s military chief of staff, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, reportedly argued during the security cabinet meeting that a more sweeping plan to retake all of Gaza would endanger the hostages and put added strain on the army after two years of regional wars. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid has blasted the security cabinet’s Gaza City decision as “a disaster” and said far-right ministers Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich dragged the Israeli prime minister into something that was “exactly what Hamas wanted”. Lapid also said the decision would lead to the deaths of more hostages and many soldiers as well as “political collapse”. His post on X reads in full (in a translation): The cabinet’s decision tonight is a disaster that will lead to many more disasters. In complete contradiction to the opinion of the military and security ranks, without considering the erosion and exhaustion of the fighting forces, Ben Gvir and Smotrich dragged Netanyahu into a move that will take months, lead to the death of the hostages, the killing of many soldiers, cost tens of billions to the Israeli taxpayer, and lead to a political collapse. This is exactly what Hamas wanted: for Israel to be trapped in the field without a goal, without defining the picture of the day after, in a useless occupation that no one understands where it is leading. The UK’s ambassador to Israel has said extending the war in Gaza would only lead to more deaths and that occupying Gaza would be a “huge mistake”. Simon Walters was quoted by Israel’s Haaretz newspaper as saying on Thursday: The IDF has achieved all that it can achieve in Gaza, and extending the war any further will simply lead to more deaths. Deaths of soldiers, deaths of Palestinians, deaths of hostages. If you want to defeat Hamas, you cannot achieve that through military force. You need to use politics and diplomacy and you need to give the people of Gaza an alternative to Hamas. Walters said the UK’s approach to the ceasefire proposal set forth by US special envoy Steve Witkoff – for one full and comprehensive deal that brings back all hostages – would end the war and initiate a new governing body for the Gaza Strip, Haaretz reported. Walters said: We are working with friends, allies in Europe and in the Middle East to generate a real plan for what happens after the fighting stops, after the war. It needs to be a description of what the governments will be for Gaza. That has to be governance by Palestinians who are not members of Hamas with a role for the Palestinian Authority. Looking at Gaza City – which Israel’s security cabinet has earmarked for a military takeover – much of it is in ruins. Israel has repeatedly bombarded the city in northern Gaza and it launched major ground operations there within weeks of Hamas’s October 2023 attack that triggered the war. Several neighbourhoods and key infrastructure are almost completely destroyed. The Associated Press reports that on the eve of the war it was Gaza’s most populous city, home to about 700,000 people. Hundreds of thousands fled under Israeli evacuation orders at the start of the war but many returned during a ceasefire earlier this year. Israel already controls and has largely destroyed around 75% of Gaza, with most of the population of some 2 million Palestinians now sheltering in Gaza City, the central city of Deir al-Balah and the sprawling displacement camps in the Muwasi area along the coast. Australian foreign minister Penny Wong has urged Israel not to follow through on its plans to occupy Gaza, a step she said could constitute a breach of international law. After Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the Israel Defense Forces would prepare to take over Gaza City, Wong pushed back on the plan, telling the Guardian: Australia calls on Israel to not go down this path, which will only worsen the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. Permanent forced displacement is a violation of international law. Wong said Australia and international partners were maintaining ongoing calls for a ceasefire, the return of hostages and aid to flow unimpeded. A two-state solution is the only pathway to secure an enduring peace – a Palestinian state and the state of Israel, living side-by-side in peace and security within internationally-recognised borders. In announcing the approval of plans to take over Gaza City, the office of Benjamin Netanyahu referred to another plan that had been submitted to the Israeli security cabinet. A decisive majority of security cabinet ministers believed that the alternative plan that had been submitted to the security cabinet would neither achieve the defeat of Hamas nor the return of the hostages. Israeli media reported that this appeared to be referring to a proposal presented by IDF chief of staff, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, who has reportedly warned that occupying Gaza would plunge Israel into a “black hole” of prolonged insurgency, humanitarian responsibility and heightened risk to hostages. It’s thought that the announcement from the security cabinet to take over Gaza City as opposed to the entire territory – as Netanyahu pledged on Thursday – could reflect the reservations of Israel’s top military officials. After nearly two years of war in Gaza, Benjamin Netanyahu faces mounting pressure at home and abroad for a truce deal to pull the Palestinian territory’s more than 2 million people back from the brink of famine and to spare hostages held by Palestinian militants. Outside the prime minister’s office in Jerusalem on Thursday evening, hundreds of demonstrators protested against any expansion of the war, demanding an immediate end to the military campaign in return for the release of all the hostages. Protesters held signs bearing the faces of hostages still held in Gaza and voiced deep frustration with the government’s handling of the crisis. “I’m here because I am sick and tired of this government. It’s ruined our life,” said 55-year-old Noa Starkman, a Jerusalem resident who was born in a southern Israeli community close to where Hamas attacked in October 2023. Indonesia will convert a medical facility on an uninhabited island to treat about 2,000 wounded residents of Gaza, according to a spokesperson for the president, reports Kate Lamb and agencies. “Indonesia will give medical help for about 2,000 Gaza residents who became victims of war, those who are wounded, buried under debris,” Hasan Nasbi said in Jakarta on Thursday. Indonesia plans to allocate the facility on Galang island, home to a former refugee camp for Vietnamese asylum seekers which lies off its island of Sumatra, to treat the wounded Gaza residents and temporarily shelter their families, the spokesperson said. The patients would be taken back to Gaza after they had healed, he added, without providing further details on the timing of the plan, or how their return would be guaranteed. Muslim-majority Indonesia has sent humanitarian aid to Gaza during the war and the announcement follows an Axios report in July that the director of Israel’s Mossad spy agency had sought US help in convincing several countries – including Indonesia, Libya and Ethiopia – to take in hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from Gaza. See the full report here: The Axios reporter Barak Ravid has cited an Israeli official as saying Israel’s occupation of Gaza City is to involve besieging Hamas fighters there while carrying out a ground offensive. Ravid’s post on X says: Senior Israeli official tells me: The operation that the IDF is currently preparing for is only in Gaza City. The goal is to evacuate all Palestinian civilians from Gaza City to the central camps and other areas by October 7. A siege will be imposed on the Hamas militants who remain in Gaza City, and at the same time, a ground offensive will be carried out in Gaza City. The Prime Minister and the Defense Minister have been authorized to approve the IDF’s final operational plan The Israeli prime minister’s office also said the “vast majority of cabinet ministers believed that the alternative plan presented in the cabinet would not achieve the defeat of Hamas nor the return of the hostages”. Netanyahu’s office said on X that the security cabinet voted by a majority to adopt what he called “the five principles for ending the war”. It listed them as (translated from Hebrew): 1. Disarming Hamas of its weapons. 2. Return of all hostages – both the living and the deceased. 3. Demilitarization of the Gaza Strip. 4. Israeli security control over the Gaza Strip. 5. Establishment of an alternative civilian administration that is neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority. Benjamin Netanyahu’s office has said on social media that the Israel Defense Forces will prepare to take over Gaza City and to provide aid to civilians outside the areas of fighting. The full post on X (translated from Hebrew) reads: The Political-Security Cabinet approved the Prime Minister’s proposal for the defeat of Hamas. The IDF will prepare to take control of Gaza City while providing humanitarian aid to the civilian population outside the combat zones. Welcome to our live coverage of the Israel-Gaza war. Benjamin Netanyahu’s office says Israel’s security cabinet has approved a plan to take over Gaza City after he earlier said the country intended to take full control of the entire Gaza Strip. The decision early on Friday marks another escalation of Israel’s offensive in Gaza. Ahead of the security cabinet meeting, which began on Thursday and ran through the night, Netanyahu said Israel planned to retake control over the whole territory and eventually hand it off to friendly Arab forces opposed to Hamas. The announced plans stop short of that, perhaps reflecting the reservations of Israel’s top general, who reportedly warned that it would endanger the remaining 20 or so living hostages held by Hamas and further strain Israel’s army after nearly two years of regional wars, the Associated Press reports. Many families of hostages are also opposed, fearing further escalation will doom their loved ones. A Hamas official was reported as telling the Al Jazeera Mubasher television network that the militant group would treat any force formed to govern Gaza per Netanyahu’s suggestion as an “occupying” force linked the Israel. And in the first reaction by a main Arab neighbour to Netanyahu’s comments, a Jordanian official told Reuters that Arabs “will only support what Palestinians agree and decide on”. In key developments: Before the security cabinet meeting, Netanyahu was asked on Fox News if Israel would “take control of all of Gaza” and he replied: “We intend to, in order to assure our security, remove Hamas there, enable the population to be free of Gaza.” The Israeli prime minister said: “We don’t want to keep it. We want to have a security perimeter. We want to hand it over to Arab forces that will govern it properly without threatening us and giving Gazans a good life.” Israeli media reported that Netanyahu was hoping to obtain approval for fully controlling Gaza at the security cabinet meeting. The plan would mean sending ground troops into the few areas of the strip that have not been totally destroyed – roughly 25% of the territory where many of its 2 million people have sought refuge. Israel was reportedly preparing a two-phase operation aimed at seizing control of Gaza City, with plans to evacuate about 1 million residents – half of Gaza’s population – in what officials described as a temporary measure to establish civilian infrastructure in central Gaza. The proposal was being framed as a limited operation rather than a full invasion, apparently to placate military chiefs wary of long-term occupation, according to Israel’s Channel 12. The chief of staff, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, has reportedly warned that occupying Gaza would plunge Israel into a “black hole” of prolonged insurgency, humanitarian responsibility and heightened risk to hostages. At least 42 Palestinians were killed in Israeli airstrikes and shootings across southern Gaza on Thursday, according to local hospitals. Of the 42, at least 13 were seeking aid in an Israeli military zone in southern Gaza where UN aid convoys are regularly overwhelmed by looters and desperate crowds. The World Health Organization said on Thursday that 99 people were known to have died from malnutrition in Gaza this year and the figure was probably an underestimate, amid famine warnings from UN agencies. The families of the roughly 20 remaining living hostages held in Gaza have called for Israelis to protest against the government and a decision they fear would endanger the lives of their loved ones.
