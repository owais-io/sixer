  Rangers supporters are entitled to feel conflicted over the prospect of
  Champions League participation. The kudos and finance that come with
  involvement against Europe’s elite would be welcome. There must also be an
  awareness, however, that it may be a chastening experience. Rangers’ last
  involvement in the competition proper ended with them on zero points and a
  minus-20 goal difference at the end of the group stage. That squad, from the
  2022-23 campaign, was stronger than the wholly unconvincing class of 2025.
  Russell Martin can take solace from guiding Rangers to a playoff round against
  Club Brugge and he needs all the positives he can garner. There was audible
  grumbling as an elongated process to find a successor to Philippe Clement
  landed on the former Southampton manager. That ramped up towards outright rage
  as Rangers opened their Scottish Premiership campaign with draws against
  Dundee and Motherwell. Martin, portrayed by his detractors as a dreamy
  idealist, is immersed in a tough, but intriguing battle to win hearts and
  minds at Ibrox. It was rather a Rangers thing that Davide Ancelotti, famous by
  name but not managerial track record, was the preferred choice of a
  significant section of the supporter base. There is cynicism towards Martin
  and not unreasonably so; much of his rhetoric sounds similar to that of
  Michael Beale. It was quickly apparent Beale could not walk the walk at Ibrox.
  In proving nothing happens in isolation in Glasgow, there is discord around
  Celtic’s lack of new signings as they prepare for a playoff tie against
  Kairat. Should one or both of the Old Firm drop into the Europa League, fierce
  reaction is inevitable, despite that being a far more sensible competitive
  environment. Rangers’ tie is tougher, but Celtic must handle the difficult
  logistics of visiting Kazakhstan. It also feels incongruous that Celtic are in
  a weaker position than when admirably progressing to the knockout phase of
  last season’s Champions League. Martin need only glance towards Brugge’s
  performance at Celtic Park last season for evidence of the danger Rangers will
  encounter. They are a powerful, slick side who have made a strong start to
  their season. Rangers, by stark contrast, lack physicality and are prone to
  hilarious defensive calamity. Martin’s brand of play demands risk-taking at
  the back and a quick-footed goalkeeper, which raises questions over the
  longevity of Jack Butland. Martin talks of pain and process, sentiments the
  fanbase has no particular interest in hearing. Martin presumably knows this,
  given he said as much at his unveiling in June. “Winning is how you convince
  people – players, staff and supporters.” Rangers have had quite enough
  managerial churn in recent years without their American owners – who have been
  light on detail when it comes to their plans – needing to regard Martin as a
  short-term option. The 39-year-old must know this given he has been heavily
  critical of his players in public more than once. Logic dictates Martin must
  be afforded a sensible period of time before being subjected to serious
  assessment. There was no queue of elite coaches seeking to replace Clement.
  Martin’s work before Southampton flopped in the Premier League was decent
  enough, but there has already been cause to raise eyebrows. The signing policy
  looks eerily familiar, with players appearing primarily from the English
  market. This route has failed before. Nothing looks different or gamechanging.
  Martin’s pointing towards a five-game unbeaten run drew ridicule given the
  paucity of the displays at Fir Park and when Dundee visited Ibrox. There was
  also the mixed messaging around the potential postponement of Sunday’s league
  trip to St Mirren, as allowed by domestic rules but rendered tricky by the
  possibility of falling 10 points behind Celtic at Ibrox on 31 August. Rangers
  backtracked their request, which made them look as reactionary as has been
  typical in recent years. Rangers have made a habit of reserving their best for
  European competition. It would be folly to assume their early struggles mean
  Brugge will progress. It is, however, also a truism that Martin would hugely
  benefit from victory over two legs. An unforgiving, browbeaten group of
  supporters are already at tipping point.
