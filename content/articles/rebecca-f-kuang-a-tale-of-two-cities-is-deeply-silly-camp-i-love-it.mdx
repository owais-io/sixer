  My favourite book growing up Brian Jacques’s Redwall (and all its sequels).
  All I wanted was to be a squirrel in the Mossflower Woods! The books that
  changed me as a teenager I read China Miéville’s Perdido Street Station and
  The City &amp; the City when I was in college. I had been falling out of love
  with fantasy – I felt too old for Redwall, and I thought I’d outgrown the
  genre – but Miéville’s work opened the door to the enormous world of adult
  fantasy literature that grappled with the problems I was now interested in.
  The writers who changed my mind I had never been wildly interested in books
  that are primarily or even largely about romantic relationships, but in the
  past few years, works by Sally Rooney, Banana Yoshimoto and Mieko Kawakami
  have changed my mind. They have opened my eyes to the potential in describing
  the subtle shifts in any interpersonal encounter, and I’m working out how to
  do that in my own writing now. The authors I came back to It took me a while
  to understand Vladimir Nabokov’s brand of humour. I tried Pnin when I was in
  college and it just didn’t work. I gave it another try last month and I
  couldn’t stop giggling. It also took me a while to find the charm in Victor
  Hugo’s bloviating. In high school, I only read the bits of Les Misérables
  about the Friends of the ABC (I had a crush on Enjolras, just like everyone
  else.) Recently I read the unabridged edition, and I’m old enough now to enjoy
  every rabbit-hole sentence about Waterloo, argot and the Parisian sewer
  system. The book I reread David Mitchell was my favourite author at college –
  I raved about The Bone Clocks to everyone I met. Cloud Atlas didn’t work so
  well for me, but I recently reread both, and this time I was stunned. Cloud
  Atlas (and its woefully underappreciated film adaptation) is so gorgeous and
  life-affirming. It was nice to find Mitchell’s writing is just as magical for
  me now as it was back then. The book I could never read again I’ve just bought
  a copy of Arnold Lobel’s Frog and Toad Are Friends for my friend’s toddler’s
  birthday party. But who am I kidding? I still love those books! The book I
  discovered later in life It took me a long time to get around to Charles
  Dickens’s A Tale of Two Cities, which I only finished this summer despite my
  love of his other work. It is overwritten, melodramatic, deeply silly camp. I
  love it. The book I am currently reading Mario Vargas Llosa’s The Time of the
  Hero, on the recommendation of my French translator. He lives in Spain and
  also does Spanish to French translations – we bonded over our love of Borges,
  and he insisted I read Vargas Llosa too. I’m also on an existentialism kick,
  so Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Gabriel Marcel and Albert Camus are
  high on my list. I’ve only now found out that the animated film character
  Marcel the Shell is a joke about Gabriel Marcel’s concept of the hard shell
  that closes us off to new possibilities. My comfort read Anything by Ray
  Bradbury. • Katabasis by RF Kuang is published by HarperVoyager. To support
