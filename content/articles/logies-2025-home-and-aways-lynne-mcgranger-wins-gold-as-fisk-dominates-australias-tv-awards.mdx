  The Home and Away actor Lynne McGranger has won the Gold Logie award for most
  popular personality on Australian television as she ends her record 32-year
  run playing the much-loved matriarch Irene Roberts. McGranger is the
  longest-serving female actor in any Australian drama, having played Irene for
  nearly 33 years. She announced her departure in February and her final episode
  will air in mid-August. “I am thrilled and honoured – this is going to be
  pride of place next to my 1974 Wagga Wagga drama festival best actress,” she
  said on Sunday night, to laughter. She thanked Home and Away’s writers and
  crew, saying: “Yeah, it is a soap. But it gives Australian actors and crew so
  much work. And we are so proud of it. Thirty-eight years the bloody thing has
  been going for, it just won’t die.” The 72-year-old paid tribute to her almost
  all-female competition – the Muster Dogs host, Lisa Millar, A Current Affair’s
  Ally Langdon, The Voice host, Sonia Kruger, the I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out
  of Here! host Julia Morris, the MasterChef Australia judge Poh Ling Yeow and
  the Lego Masters host, Hamish Blake – as “beautiful, fierce women of all ages.
  And I am the oldest!” Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of
  must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning As
  the only male nominee, two-time winner Blake had actively campaigned against
  himself this year, joking to the media: “It would not be a great look if I
  won, so figure out your favourite lady, and get right behind her.” McGranger
  also won best lead actress in a drama for her performance in Home and Away,
  seeing off competition from the Apple Cider Vinegar actor Kaitlyn Dever and
  the Territory star Anna Torv. The ABC comedy Fisk was the big winner on
  Sunday, taking home best scripted comedy, best lead actress in a comedy for
  Kitty Flanagan for the second year in a row, best lead actor in a comedy for
  Aaron Chen, best supporting actress for Julia Zemiro and best supporting actor
  for Glenn Butcher. Flanagan thanked ABC and Netflix “for the viewing bump” and
  said she was particularly pleased that families watched Fisk, a comedy set in
  a suburban law firm. “It makes me so happy to know we accidentally made a
  family show,” she said. “We didn’t mean to … the fact they appreciate a
  middle-aged lady in a baggy suit who mumbles, I have hope for the future.” The
  ABC had a strong night overall, with the detective show Return to Paradise
  winning best drama, Australian Story winning best current affairs, Muster
  Dogs: Collies &amp; Kelpies winning best structured reality program, Four
  Corners’ Betrayal of Trust winning best news coverage or public affairs
  report, and Bluey winning the children’s program category for a record fourth
  time. Guy Montgomery, the host of Guy Montgomery’s Guy Mont Spelling Bee on
  the ABC, also won the Graham Kennedy award for most popular new talent. The
  New Zealander gave a bullish speech, telling Australia: “Suck it, we have one
  up on your country this time!” The actor and comedian Magda Szubanski was
  inducted into the Logie Hall of Fame months after she revealed she had been
  diagnosed with cancer, with the likes of the film-maker George Miller, Kath
  and Kim’s Gina Riley, Richard E Grant and the politician Penny Wong all paying
  tribute. The US comedy actor Melissa McCarthy called her “one of the funniest
  humans, one of the smartest humans”. Szubanski was unable to attend the
  ceremony but gave an emotional pre-taped speech. “Let’s just get this out of
  the way – I am not being awarded this honour because I have got the cancer. I
  am getting this because of 40 years of hard work – lobbying, bribing,
  threatening, whatever it took. Finally it has all paid off.” She thanked the
  public for their messages of support. “The love and support I have felt, like
  a tsunami, from the Australian public has been overwhelming and I have to tell
  you, it really helps … when I go online and I look at those messages, every
  time my heart lifts and I feel that much stronger to deal with the cancer.”
  Streaming platforms dominated the best drama nominees but failed to win on the
  night. Netflix won just one award: best miniseries for Apple Cider Vinegar,
  its drama about the Australian fraudster Belle Gibson. Though Apple Cider
  Vinegar and Netflix’s Territory dominated the drama categories, neither won.
  Instead, Fisk won the supporting categories, McGranger won best lead actress,
  and Sam Neill won best lead actor for his role in season two of The Twelve.
  The former tennis player turned commentator Jelena Dokic gave an emotional
  speech while accepting a Logie for her documentary Unbreakable: The Jelena
  Dokic Story, about surviving the physical and mental abuse dealt by her
  father, who was also once her coach. “To every kid and person out there, I
  will say, to every single girl and woman out there, never allow anyone to take
  your worth or happiness or smile away,” she said. “Believe in your goals and
  dreams.” The Logies have historically been an unusual awards event, with a mix
  of popularly voted awards – which celebrities have always actively campaigned
  to win – and peer-voted awards. The system has been overhauled so that the
  “best” categories – formerly called “most outstanding” – are determined by a
  combined score, 50% of which is peer assessment and audience data supplied by
  the broadcasters and 50% of which is by popular vote. The Gold Logie, the Bert
  Newton award for most popular presenter, the Graham Kennedy award for most
  popular new talent and the new Ray Martin award for most popular news or
  public affairs reporter, remain determined entirely by popular vote. Logie
