  The high court’s dismissal of the actor Noel Clarke’s case against the
  Guardian is about more than one actor’s failed libel claim. Mrs Justice
  Steyn’s judgment is about power and complicity as well as the failure to
  protect vulnerable people. In her verdict, she agreed with the Guardian that
  there were “strong grounds to believe that [Clarke] is a serial abuser of
  women”. The court heard testimony from 26 witnesses before concluding that
  Clarke had engaged in harassment, bullying and abuse of power over many years.
  The judge accepted some of his evidence, but found him to be neither credible
  or reliable. The Guardian’s journalists, by contrast, were meticulous and gave
  Clarke reasonable opportunity to respond as well as fairly presenting his
  denials. Without women speaking up, Clarke would never have been exposed. The
  judge rightly agreed that these were plainly matters of public interest. But
  in law it is not enough for an editor to say that a story is important. It
  must also demonstrate responsible journalism: it must have careful
  corroboration and fair presentation, and not be given to sensationalism. The
  editors and reporters produced a final article, the judge agreed, that was
  measured, accurate and balanced. Crucially, their belief that this work was in
  the public interest was “reasonable”. Beyond the law is a wider, all too
  familiar story. Clarke was not just another actor; he was being honoured by
  the British film academy, Bafta, for his “outstanding British contribution to
  cinema” even as serious allegations began to circulate. But the deeper
  indictment is of an industry that turned a blind eye. Clarke was rewarded and
  celebrated while women who spoke out risked their careers. The structures of
  power that enabled him – and the colleagues willing to look away – are the
  same factors that have ended up sheltering abusers across society. This is the
  culture that allowed him to flourish. It is the culture that required #MeToo
  before voices were heard, and that now faces a backlash in which powerful men
  are recast as victims. In Britain, a star celebrated by his peers has been
  exposed as a serial abuser only after years of whispers were ignored. In her
  summing up, Mrs Justice Steyn punctured Clarke’s line of defence in a passage
  that was both subtle and resonant. These were, she reasoned, deliberate acts
  of abuse, later rationalised through minimisation and self-deception. The
  lesson of this case is twofold. First, it is a victory for investigative
  journalism. When reporters act responsibly, the courts will uphold their right
  to publish. The Clarke case and allegations on shows such as MasterChef have
  sparked reforms, prompting a BBC culture review and the creation of an
  independent industry standards body. The second part of the lesson is that
  awards, plaudits and silence sustain harassers and abusers more effectively
  than any legal defence. Clarke’s reputation lies in ruins, not because of
  gossip, but because of findings tested in court. For years, Britain’s TV
  industry tolerated a toxic culture where the misconduct of powerful men was
  seen as unmentionable and staff were resigned to silence. The industry’s power
  imbalance – dominant executives and stars versus insecure freelancers, a
  situation worsened by shrinking production budgets – is widely blamed. The
  story here is not just about one man’s downfall. It is about a culture that
  looked away – until it could no longer deny the truth. Do you have an opinion
