  While trying to come up with a pesticide solution to kill off bollworms, Dr
  Robert Mensah had his eureka moment. It was the 90s, and in Australia
  bollworms were devastating cotton farms, with the larvae of these moths
  chomping up the crops faster than farmers could eradicate them. The farmers
  were trapped in an arms race with the bollworms, applying more and more
  pesticide to combat an increasingly resistant species of pest – killing many
  beneficial insects in the process. Instead of carrying on down the death
  spiral, Mensah, an entomologist working at the Cotton Research Institute,
  began to wonder whether it might be possible to get another insect in to do
  the job. He experimented and eventually came up with a simple food spray, “a
  mixture of food ingredients, yeast and sugar-based, diluted in water and
  applied to crops. It emits an odour which is picked up by beneficial predatory
  insects and attracts them to the fields where they kill pests.” He started
  testing it out in the fields and found that food sprays could entice useful
  predators such as ladybirds and lacewings. A refuge crop of evergreen alfalfa
  flowers could also support their populations year-round, so they wouldn’t
  leave at the end of the season and be poisoned by pesticides in the
  surrounding landscape. It was the beginning of an international grassroots
  campaign, in which Mensah has worked with various charities to teach people
  about this sustainable farming method. Ever since the dangerous side effects
  of pesticides became widely known, alternatives have been sought. This
  approach to farming, which reduces our reliance on pesticides, is called
  integrated pest management. “Integrated pest management is a concept that goes
  back to the 1950s,” says Dr Samantha Cook, a behavioural ecologist at the
  agricultural institute, Rothamsted Research. Before reaching for pesticides or
  less harmful substitutes such as pest-killing fungi and bacteria, there are a
  range of methods you can use to prevent pest populations from building. “I
  like to think of it as an IPM triangle. At the base you’ve got management
  tools: If you rotate crops well, that helps to reduce pest populations
  building in the soil. Another key element is monitoring pest populations –
  deciding on thresholds above which the pest population needs to be
  controlled,” Cook says. Enticing natural predators is another of these
  management solutions, and the area in which Mensah specialises. “Natural
  enemies are a good way of not relying on insecticides. If we can look after
  the things that eat the pests, we don’t have to kill the pests ourselves, we
  can leave that to nature,” Cook says. In 2005, Mensah took food sprays to
  Benin, where the Pesticide Action Network (PAN UK) was helping farmers
  transition to organic farming. There, the misuse of chemical pesticides was
  seriously damaging people’s health. “I saw conventional farmers wash their
  chemical containers in a pool of water that the cattle came and drank from,”
  said Mensah “Some of them used the chemical containers to store water for
  their families. The water itself was poisoned.” “It was very sad because I
  came from Ghana, in a time when we were using DDT (a synthetic insecticide) to
  kill fish in the rivers, and then we would bring the fish home and eat them. I
  then moved to a developed country, where they know the risk posed by
  insecticides. So this was like going back to my roots and seeing the same
  thing being repeated.” “That encouraged me to talk to them and advise them.
  They listened to me because they know I’m one of them.” The food sprays –
  cheap, safe and effective – caught on with farmers in Benin where thousands
  now use the technique. From there, Mensah took food sprays to southern
  Ethiopia, where they were also trialled successfully on vegetables as opposed
  to cotton, and then to Vietnam where they were used successfully on maize.
  Another charity, Better Cotton, is now trialling food sprays in India across
  Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Telangana, where they’ve trained 214,000 farmers to
  use sprays. But while the benefits are compelling, a spokesperson noted that
  they can be “time consuming and labour intensive, because farmers are required
  to produce the formula, and then frequently spray and monitor its
  application”. This is one of the problems holding back sustainable pest
  management on a global scale. Pesticide spray may be expensive but they offer
  farmers a one-size-fits-all solution. But entomologists tell us insects will
  inevitably become resistant to any chemical pesticide we invent. Marcel Dicke,
  professor of entomology at Wageningen University says: “It’s simple, insects
  are variable in genetic makeup, and you never eliminate 100% of them. Let’s
  say 1% survives, and that 1% has a way of overcoming the pesticide. They
  transfer this genetic predisposition to the next generation, and so it spreads
  among the population. That’s how insects – sometimes very quickly – can become
  resistant to pesticides.” Food sprays, says Dicke, are not a silver bullet
  technology, but they can be helpful in nourishing beneficial insects,
  alongside a range of other management techniques. “Integrated pest management,
  which reintegrates a diversity of measures, says that you might use selective
  chemical pesticides as the very last resort when nothing else works.” And yet,
  despite promising results, sustainable pest management is getting harder to
  introduce, even in the UK where there’s a consumer market for eco-friendly
  products. This isn’t because farmers don’t want change, says Dr Stephanie
  Williamson, who was a staff scientist at PAN UK for more than 20 years.
  “Pesticides are a very small proportion of farmers’ production costs in the
  UK, so there’s no real economic driver to reduce insecticide use in this
  country. And most standard crop insurance will insist that you’ve taken all
  available measures to stop crop loss, which means using synthetic
  insecticides,” she says. “The whole system does not currently support farmers
  to move towards more agroecological approaches. And unfortunately, the new
  government is cutting back its funding for nature-friendly farming, which is a
  real shame, because farmers are rethinking their methods, but there isn’t
  enough government support for them to change. “Supermarkets also need to put
  their money where their mouth is and help farmers shift to safer, more
  sustainable practices.” Prof Tariq Butt, a member of the UK Expert Committee
  on Pesticides, which provides independent advice to the government, says more
  research needs to be done into the efficacy of food sprays in different
  climates and agricultural systems. “It’s fantastic that they’ve utilised local
  materials and demonstrated that it’s worked for smallholders in Ethiopia and
  other countries. It shows promise, but there are a lot of questions left to
  answer about food sprays,” he said.
