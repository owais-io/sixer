  Many of those arrested in Parliament Square were pensioners (Half of arrests
  at Palestine Action ban protest were 60 or over, data shows, 10 August). It is
  clear that this group are out to cause trouble. The government should create a
  stay-at-home order for anyone over 65; at the very least they should not be
  allowed to gather in large groups. Exceptions allowed for garden centres and
  the House of Lords. Roger Osborne Snainton, North Yorkshire • Having collected
  every single Feast magazine since January 2018, I now need a solution to the
  accompanying storage burden. Gail’s bakery bags will do for now, but all
  suggestions considered. Alternatively, if there were to be a change in format
  or size I would be freed from my compulsion. Help! Mary Burgess Tunbridge
  Wells, Kent • Years ago, during a family hike in a dull part of Normandy on a
  damp day, my young son looked downcast. “Don’t you like this holiday?” we
  asked. His reply: “I’d rather be at home watching Blue Peter with a cup of
  tea” (Letters, 13 August). This has since become the standard family response
  to any similar unappealing situation. Joe Locker Surbiton, London • The right
  answers to the Saturday Kids’ Quiz questions (9 August) are enlightening, but
  the wrong ones can be delightful. Stars are made of summertime and magic? If
  only. Dr Moira Biggins Derby • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the
  Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it will be considered for
