  Russell T Davies has said gay rights are “rapidly and urgently getting worse”
  thanks to the rise of Reform UK and the influence of the Trump presidency on
  British politics. The award-winning screenwriter, who is best known for
  reviving Doctor Who and writing Queer As Folk, said the LGBT community should
  be “revolting in terror and anger and action” in response to growing support
  for Reform, which has pledged to “ban transgender ideology” in schools.
  Speaking to the Big Issue, Davies said: “When Queer As Folk came out in 1999,
  if you’d said: ‘What will gay rights be like in 2025?’, we’d have said: ‘Oh,
  it will all be marvellous – it’ll be sunshine and skipping down the street,
  hand in hand – gays, queers, lesbians, everyone.’ “And look at where we are.
  Things got better but now things are rapidly and urgently getting worse. “What
  happens in America always happens here, and as we look down the barrel of a
  Reform government, we, the gay community, queer community, should be revolting
  in terror and anger and action.” Reform has promised to ban what it called
  “transgender ideology” in schools within its first 100 days of government.
  According to the party’s manifesto, its education policies include plans for a
  “patriotic” curriculum, tax relief of 20% on private schools and cuts to
  funding for universities “that undermine free speech”. It has also pledged to
  replace the Equality Act and said it would scrap diversity, equality and
  inclusion rules. Davies also said Trump was “literally out to get us” and
  “would be happier with us invisible and gone, defunded, completely invisible
  if not biologically altered” to become as straight as him. The Doctor Who
  showrunner called on the younger generation of LGBT people to organise and
  fight back against the rhetoric and policies that have emerged on the hard
  right of British politics. “I hope they’re prepared to fight, that younger
  generation that has no idea how they got there. And neither should they;
  they’re busy living their lives. I didn’t spend my youth looking back at World
  War Two. But I do think: ‘Are you prepared to fight? Because a fight is
  coming.’” Davies’s next Channel 4 series, Tip Toe, deals with the culture war
  that has radicalised some people into homophobia, transphobia and prejudice.
  Channel 4 has said the show will look at “the most corrosive forces facing the
  LGBTQ+ community today, examining the danger as prejudice creeps back into our
  lives”. Davies said: “It’s radical, it’s savage, and it’s hilarious. It is the
  strongest thing I’ve written. I do believe Queer As Folk, Cucumber, It’s A Sin
  and Tip Toe are the ones that will be on my gravestone.” Reform UK has been
  contacted for comment. Davies said earlier this year that gay society was in
  the greatest danger he had ever seen after Trump’s presidential election
  triumph. “As a gay man, I feel like a wave of anger, and violence, and
  resentment is heading towards us on a vast scale,” he said. “I’ve literally
  seen a difference in the way I’m spoken to as a gay man since that November
  election, and that’s a few months of weaponising hate speech, and the hate
  speech creeps into the real world. “I’m not being alarmist. I’m 61 years old.
  I know gay society very, very well, and I think we’re in the greatest danger I
  have ever seen.” In April, he also hit back at claims Doctor Who was too woke.
  “Someone always brings up matters of diversity,” he said. “And there are
  online warriors accusing us of diversity and wokeness and involving messages
  and issues. “And I have no time for this. I don’t have a second to bear [it].
  Because what you might call diversity, I just call an open door.”
