  Ministers are planning to make it harder for refugees to bring family members
  to the UK as part of a package of measures that Yvette Cooper will announce on
  Monday as she looks to get a grip on the fractious debate over irregular
  migration. The home secretary will tell MPs she plans to make a number of
  changes to the way asylum cases are treated, including to the family reunion
  policy, which officials believe is acting as a magnet for people crossing the
  Channel. Cooper’s statement to the Commons on the first day back after the
  recess is intended to draw a line under a difficult summer for the government,
  marked by public protests and legal wrangling over its use of hotels to house
  asylum seekers. The home secretary will say: “Our action to strengthen border
  security, increase returns and overhaul the broken asylum system are putting
  much stronger foundations in place so we can fix the chaos we inherited and
  end costly asylum hotels. “That means ensuring we have the powers we need to
  pursue the criminal smuggling gangs profiting from small boat crossings that
  other parties have voted against, but also new firm rules in place to manage
  the asylum system so we can close hotels.” In a direct rebuttal to Nigel
  Farage, the Reform UK leader, who has dominated headlines for the past week
  with his plan to deport almost all of those who cross the Channel in small
  boats, she will add: “These are complex challenges and they require
  sustainable and workable solutions, not fantasy promises which can’t be
  delivered.” Cooper will promise to overhaul the UK’s family reunion policy,
  which allows people to bring their partners and children to the country once
  they are granted refugee status. The number of people who entered on such
  visas has risen sharply since 2022, with just over 20,000 being granted in the
  year to June 2025 – a 30% rise on the previous 12 months. Officials say the
  rise in refugee numbers is in part to blame, but they also believe the UK now
  has a more lax regime than many nearby countries after moves elsewhere in
  Europe to tighten their rules. In Denmark, for example, refugees must prove
  financial stability before being allowed to bring over family members. Cooper
  is understood to be looking at similar changes, as well as setting a minimum
  period refugees must be settled before being allowed to invite their families.
  The home secretary will also confirm changes to the asylum process which will
  remove the power of judges to hear appeals, handing them to a select panel of
  trained experts. Officials say this will operate in a similar way to the
  magistrate system, with trained members of the public hearing cases under the
  supervision of legal experts. Cooper will also highlight the number of
  “disruptions” law enforcement officials are making to people smuggling gangs,
  whether through arrests, asset seizures or action to close communication
  networks. The government says officers took 347 such actions in 2024-25 – the
  highest on record. They also point to an unexpected dip in small boat
  crossings over August to the lowest levels in four years – something they say
  was triggered in part by law enforcement operations to seize dinghies at the
  Bulgarian border over the summer. This recent drop has not been enough to
  appease public anger, especially at the ongoing use of hotels to house those
  whose claims have not yet been processed. Essex police announced moves over
  the weekend to clamp down on the largest of those protests, outside the Bell
  hotel in Epping, after two police officers were injured on Friday. Protests
  must end by 8pm, while demonstrators will be stopped from blocking the road
  and could be ordered to remove face coverings, the force said. In response to
  the protests, Farage announced a series of policy proposals to bar most asylum
  seekers from Britain. Farage was criticised over the weekend by Stephen
  Cottrell, the archbishop of York, who called his policy “isolationist,
  short-term [and] kneejerk”. But he received backing in part from an unexpected
  quarter as Jack Straw, a former Labour home secretary, added his name to a
  list of experts who believe the UK can leave the European convention of human
  rights without undermining peace in Northern Ireland. Downing Street last week
  accused the Reform leader of not being a “serious person” for advocating the
  UK’s departure from the convention, which it said would damage the Good Friday
  agreement. Straw, however, on Monday gave his backing to a report from the
  thinktank Policy Exchange claiming this was not the case. “The debate about
  our future relationship with the ECHR … should be conducted on its merits,” he
  said. “This paper [from Policy Exchange] argues, in thorough and forensic
  detail, that ‘whatever the merits of UK withdrawal from the ECHR, nothing in
  the Belfast agreement rules it out as a viable course of action.’”
