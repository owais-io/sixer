  Shares in UK lenders surged on Monday after a favourable supreme court ruling
  significantly slashed the anticipated bill for companies engulfed in the car
  finance scandal. The specialist lender Close Brothers, which is the most
  exposed to the scandal, closed 23.5% up, while the UK’s biggest motor loan
  provider, Lloyds Banking Group, rose by 9% to hit a 10-year high. Shares in
  Barclays, which no longer provides car finance but is dealing with the fallout
  for the remaining loans on its books, rose by 1.6%. Shares in FirstRand, one
  of the lenders involved in the supreme court case, were lifted by 2.4%. The
  motor finance industry, which ranges from big banks such as Lloyds and
  Santander UK to specialist lenders and the finance arms of carmakers such as
  Ford and BMW, dodged a collective £44bn compensation bill after the supreme
  court broadly sided with lenders in a ruling on Friday. The Financial Conduct
  Authority (FCA) subsequently announced plans for a much smaller redress
  scheme, which will go out for consultation by October. It is expected to cost
  lenders between £9bn and £18bn. The scheme will help draw a line under the car
  finance scandal, compensating millions of drivers who were overcharged as a
  result of controversial commission arrangements between lenders and car
  dealers as far back as 2007. The question now is the scope of the scheme:
  whether it will be limited to discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs), or
  broadened to include other unfair or egregious arrangements highlighted in the
  supreme court case. Lloyds, which had previously set aside £1.2bn to cover
  compensation payments, did not announce any further provisions on Monday, and
  said the “ultimate impact” on the bank would depend on a “number of factors”.
  That included the outcome of the consultation over the FCA compensation
  scheme, any “further interventions” including by regulators, as well as
  “broader implications of the judgment, including legal proceedings and
  complaints”. However, Lloyds, which is the largest provider of motor loans in
  the UK through its Black Horse division, said any additional money put aside
  for compensation “is unlikely to be material in the context of the group”.
  “The provision will continue to be reviewed for any further information that
  becomes available, with an update provided as and when necessary,” Lloyds
  added. Close Brothers, which was one of two lenders who appealed against their
  case in the supreme court, has already put aside £165m for the scandal,
  cancelled dividends and announced plans to sell its asset management business
  to strengthen its finances. It said on Monday: “We look forward to engaging
  with the FCA in respect of the consultation.” South Africa’s FirstRand, which
  operates as MotoNovo in the UK, said it may put aside more cash to cover
  compensation payouts, which could push earnings growth to the lower end of its
  forecasts. Those results will be released on 11 September. Meanwhile, the
  Financing and Leasing Association (FLA) – the lobby group that represents the
  car loan industry – said it could challenge the FCA’s compensation scheme in
  court if it ends up handing “disproportionate” payouts to drivers. “I’m sure
  both our side, like the claimant side, will have their red lines,” the FLA’s
  head of motor finance, Adrian Dally, told the Guardian. Dally said the
  industry wanted to see a scheme focused solely on compensation to consumers
  for losses linked to DCAs, which were banned in 2021, and became the focus of
  a regulatory investigation last year. However, that would mean limiting
  compensation to about £2.2bn: a figure based on the £165m a year that
  customers were believed to have been overcharged between 2007 and 2020, before
  the ban came into force. “If a scheme was in that ballpark, then I think we’ll
  consider that a reasonable scheme,” Dally said. “But if you have numbers that
  go beyond that, then we would have to think very seriously about that.” The
  FLA also pushed back against redress plans that included contracts that were
  almost 20 years old. “We have concerns about whether it is possible to have a
  fair redress scheme that goes back to 2007 when firms have not been required
  to hold such dated information, and the evidence base will be patchy at best.
  We will be interested to see how the FCA addresses this point in its
  consultation.” The regulator’s chief executive, Nikhil Rathi, told Today on
  BBC Radio 4 on Monday: “There’s some detail to be worked out, and we’ll have
  to look at this on a case-by-case basis … but we think we have enough now to
  put in place a scheme. And of course, what we have found in our review is that
  many firms broke the law and our rules around disclosure: they didn’t disclose
  commissions. And so in those cases, where consumers have lost out, it’s
  important that there’s appropriate compensation.” Motorists have been warned
  they are likely to get less than £950 for a claim. The FCA said there was no
  need to use a claims firm, adding that any redress scheme would be free for
  consumers to use. The regulator said anyone concerned should contact their
  lender in the first instance.
