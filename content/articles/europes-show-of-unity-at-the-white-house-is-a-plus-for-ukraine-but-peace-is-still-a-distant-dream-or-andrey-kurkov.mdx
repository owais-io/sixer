  It was night in Ukraine when President Trump met President Putin in Alaska – a
  night during which Russia shelled only frontline Ukrainian cities. People in
  Kyiv, Lviv, Odesa, Dnipro and even Kharkiv could sleep, but they did not. They
  were waiting for news from Alaska. I was also awake and watching the news
  feed, aware that this meeting would lead to nothing, or worse, something bad
  for Ukraine. But in difficult, seemingly hopeless situations, human nature is
  prone to desperate optimism. In the middle ages, people often hoped for a
  miracle, forgetting about the logic of events. So, the night of 15 August was
  a night of hope for a miracle, which, of course, did not happen. Unlike on the
  eve of the Alaska meeting, in Ukraine, there was no particular tension in the
  buildup to the meeting of European leaders at the White House on Monday,
  despite images of a hugely powerful team arriving in Washington. Ukrainians
  seemed to sense that this meeting had to be visually positive in order to push
  into the shade the Alaska meeting, which ended in nothing, if not actual
  failure. The meeting demonstrated, in equal measure, the continuation of
  Europe’s support for Ukraine and Europe’s concern over the unpredictable
  position of President Trump, for whom the goal is simply a quick end to the
  war, rather than achieving a fair peace. A fair peace, that is the liberation
  of territories seized by Russia and the restoration of Ukraine within its
  constitutional geographical borders, is increasingly becoming a dream that
  only Ukrainians have the right to cherish. Our partners have fallen quiet
  about this obvious prerequisite to a fair peace, although they do not openly
  talk about the opposite – about the “need” to yield to the “inevitable” loss
  of a large part of Ukrainian territory. While the meeting in Alaska was
  greeted with hundreds of ironic comments on social media, Ukrainians took the
  White House gathering much more seriously. They do not overestimate the
  outcomes, but they are quietly satisfied to see President Trump looking
  cheerful in such obviously pro-Ukrainian company. A bilateral meeting between
  President Zelenskyy and Putin is viewed as unlikely and Ukrainians are sure
  that Putin will do everything possible to avoid one. Putin has repeatedly
  questioned Zelenskyy’s legitimacy as president and meeting the Ukrainian
  leader would fly in the face of that stance. But, if we try to imagine how a
  bilateral meeting might go, logically an easy issue should be dealt with first
  – a minor question on which agreement could be achieved, paving the way for
  more difficult topics. But today, between Ukraine and Russia there are no easy
  issues. The exchange of prisoners of war and the return of Ukrainian children
  and civilians from Russia to Ukraine have long been addressed with a degree of
  success by a separate team of employees. All other points for discussion are
  extremely difficult; for example, a mutual ceasefire or a mutual cessation of
  shelling with missiles and drones, or the status of captured territories and
  territories that Russia is still planning to capture. The format of such a
  tete-a-tete meeting is therefore much more likely to be two short monologues,
  but certainly not a dialogue. A three-person meeting with President Trump as a
  moderator could be more productive, but surely Trump will only agree to this
  if he is confident that at least something will be achieved. Otherwise, again,
  as after the Alaska meeting, his reputation will take a beating. For most
  Ukrainians, the very fact of a joint visit to Washington by President
  Zelenskyy and the leaders of the European Union and Britain is more important
  than the post-meeting announcement about the agreement on the purchase of US
  weapons by Europe for Ukraine, which has long been understood as a done deal.
  The most interesting aspect of the meeting – the content of the telephone
  conversation between Trump and Putin after the tete-a-tete with Zelenskyy –
  remains an unknown, but press reports pointing to Hungary as a potential
  meeting place are worrying. Putin’s visit to Alaska was presented by Russian
  media as a victory – Russia’s strongman breakout from global isolation. A
  meeting on EU soil, if it does take place, will be presented as Russia’s final
  victory in its fight to make the civilised world recognise its right to
  violate any international law without bearing the least responsibility for
  violating the rights of other states to a peaceful life within their
  geographical borders. When the White House talks ended, Russian drones and
  missiles attacked energy infrastructure facilities in the Poltava region.
  Dozens of explosions thundered across the cities of Kremenchuk and Lubny.
  Residents were unlikely to be interested in the results of the White House
  meeting the next morning. This week has seen the mutual escalation of military
  action. Many Ukrainian cities have been hit hard but Russia has also felt the
  power of Ukrainian drones, which have seriously damaged large oil refineries
  and exacerbated Russia’s gasoline shortages. At the same time, the Russian
  foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has declared as totally unacceptable Trump
  and European leaders’ proposals to introduce European peacekeeping troops into
  Ukraine. Putin has also made it clear that a meeting with Zelenskyy would be
  possible only if Ukraine first agreed to all of Russia’s demands. In other
  words, if Ukraine agreed to capitulate. Thus, all of Trump’s peace plans once
  again have turned out to be an illusion, and the only person who has not yet
  realised this is the US president. Perhaps the Russian missiles that exploded
  on Thursday at the American electronics plant Flex, located in western
  Ukraine, near the border with Hungary, were meant as a clarifying message for
  Trump. Both the production lines and warehouses of the US plant, which had
  been operating since 2012, were destroyed. Putin’s explosive message was
  directed to at least two addressees: Trump, who must now understand that Putin
  is no longer interested in telephone conversations or invitations to Alaska,
  and the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán. Orbán thought Russia had
  agreed to spare the Zakarpattia region of Ukraine and its ethnic Hungarian
  population in return for his pro-Russian stance. Recently, however, Orbán has
  felt pressure to alter his position. In a phone call to the Hungarian prime
  minister, Trump insisted that Orbán should not interfere with Ukraine’s
  possible accession to the EU. Perhaps it was during this conversation, in
  order to improve the mood of the US president, that Orbán suggested Budapest
  as the place for a one-on-one between Zelenskyy and Putin, hoping that the
  next meeting in the presence of Trump would also take place in the capital of
  Hungary. Putin doesn’t like it when someone decides for him where, and with
  whom, he should meet. Andrey Kurkov is a Ukrainian novelist and author of
