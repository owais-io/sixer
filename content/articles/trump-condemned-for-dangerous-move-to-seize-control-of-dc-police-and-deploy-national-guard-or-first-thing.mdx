  Good morning. Donald Trump has ordered the national guard to Washington DC and
  seized control of the city’s police force, describing a “lawless” city in ways
  that are sharply at odds with official crime statistics. The president’s move
  was swiftly condemned as a “disgusting, dangerous and derogatory” assault on
  the political independence of a racially diverse city. The federal takeover is
  expected to be in effect for 30 days, the White House confirmed to the
  Guardian. Speaking at a White House press conference on Monday, Trump alleged
  DC was “one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the world”, even though
  violent crime is at a 30-year low. What do the crime figures tell us? That
  Trump is spreading a false narrative about DC crime – just as he did with LA.
  Violent crime in DC is at a 30-year low. In January, the Metropolitan police
  department and US attorney’s office released a report indicating that total
  violent crime in DC in 2024 was down 35% from the previous year, marking the
  lowest rate in over 30 years. How are Democrats responding? Hakeem Jeffries,
  the Democratic minority leader in the House, described Trump as a “wannabe
  king” and said: “We stand with the residents of the District of Columbia and
  reject this unjustified power grab as illegitimate.” Global outrage mounts as
  funeral held for five journalists killed by Israel The death of the prominent
  Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif, killed along with four colleagues in an
  Israeli airstrike on Sunday, prompted condemnation from around the world, as
  hundreds of mourners carried their bodies through the streets of Gaza City.
  Sharif, one of Al Jazeera’s most recognisable faces in Gaza, was killed while
  inside a tent for journalists outside al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City on Sunday
  night. Seven people were killed in the attack, including the Al Jazeera
  correspondent Mohammed Qreiqeh and the camera operators Ibrahim Zaher,
  Mohammed Noufal and Moamen Aliwa, according to the Qatar-based broadcaster.
  How deadly has the war been for journalists? Before Sunday’s airstrike, the
  Committee to Protect Journalists recorded at least 186 journalists and media
  workers killed in Gaza, the West Bank, Israel and Lebanon since the war began,
  making it the deadliest period for journalists since it began gathering data
  in 1992. The CPJ accuses Israel of directly targeting and killing 20
  journalists and media workers. Any deliberate attack on a civilian could
  constitute a war crime, experts say. Israel, which has refused to let
  international media into Gaza, denies the accusation. Trump nominates
  rightwing Heritage Foundation economist as labor statistics chief Donald Trump
  has announced he is nominating EJ Antoni, the chief economist at the
  conservative Heritage Foundation, as the next commissioner of the Bureau of
  Labor Statistics. The nomination comes after Trump fired the BLS commissioner,
  Erika McEntarfer, earlier this month following the release of a weak jobs
  report. Trump, without evidence, alleged McEntarfer “faked” employment numbers
  in the run-up to the 2024 election to boost Kamala Harris’s chances and said
  that the recent data was “rigged” to make Trump and Republicans look bad. What
  happens next? The Senate will have to confirm Antoni’s nomination to lead the
  BLS, an independent agency under the labor department. Experts fear Trump’s
  interventions will undermine the credibility of the agency’s economic data,
  long seen as a gold standard. In other news … Donald Trump said he and
  Vladimir Putin would discuss “land swapping” when they meet on Friday in
  Alaska for a summit on the Ukraine war, and expressed frustration with
  Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Meanwhile, Trump again delayed implementing
  sweeping tariffs on China, announcing another 90-day pause hours before the
  last agreement expired. An explosion at a US Steel plant in Pennsylvania
  killed two people and injured at least 10 on Monday. “It felt like thunder,”
  said one worker near the scene. Spain’s central government has ordered
  officials in a Spanish town to scrap a ban on religious gatherings in public
  sports centers, describing it as a “discriminatory” measure mainly affecting
  Muslims. Stat of the day: Farmers displaced by $1.5bn Trump golf course
  reportedly offered rice and cash Villagers whose farms in Vietnam will be
  bulldozed to make way for a $1.5bn golf resort backed by the Trump family have
  reportedly been offered rice provisions and cash compensation of as little as
  $12 for a square meter of land by state authorities. Thousands of villagers
  will be offered compensation based on land size and location, according to a
  report by Reuters. Don’t miss this: ‘If these words reach you … Israel has
  succeeded in killing me’ – the last words of journalist Anas al-Sharif killed
  by Israel Anas al-Sharif, an Al Jazeera reporter, was killed by an Israeli
  airstrike on Sunday night. Before his killing, he prepared a message for his
  family, and calling for the world not to forget Gaza. “I have lived through
  pain in all its details, tasted suffering and loss many times, yet I never
  once hesitated to convey the truth as it is, without distortion or
  falsification,” he writes. Climate check: How ‘nurdles’ are polluting the
  oceans Nurdles: they’re buoyant, the size of a lentil and almost impossible to
  recover. Millions of these tiny plastic pellets are being washed up on the
  coast of Kerala in India in the latest in a series of global spills – with sea
  creatures thinking they’re eggs – as plastic treaty talks continue in Geneva
  until Thursday. Last Thing: What’s behind the surprising boom in
  ventriloquism? Ventriloquism is back in vogue on stage and online. Its new hip
  practitioners explain why their vocal tricks and errant dummies are wowing
  audiences again. “It is very stripped back. That’s why it feels fresh,” one
  ventriloquist says. Sign up First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes
