  The Football Association is to introduce cooling-off periods in grassroots
  football in acknowledgment that more must be done to contain bad behaviour at
  that level. Selected leagues are to trial the system this year, a move that
  will allow referee to order players of both teams to stop and retreat to their
  penalty area in order to prevent “escalation during heated moments in a
  match”. During 2023-24, the latest season for which figures are available, the
  FA received 4,277 allegations of serious misconduct at grassroots level, a 13%
  increase on the previous year. The governing body is committed to “creating
  safe, respectful and inclusive environments” in the grassroots game, according
  to its director of football development, James Kendall. “We’re clear on our
  position that all forms of unacceptable behaviour, whether on or off the
  pitch, have no place in football,” he said. “We’ve made good progress on
  addressing these issues, but we recognise there is still more to be done and
  we need to constantly adapt, develop and evolve our procedures in line with
  changes in the game.” The International Football Association Board (Ifab),
  which determines the laws of the game, authorised trials of cooling-off
  periods in 2024. It argued the measure could be used in instances of
  “significant confrontation” to “prevent further confrontations and the need
  for the match to be abandoned.” Any player who does not adhere to a referee’s
  instructions regarding a cooling-off period will receive a yellow card.
  Captains and coaches will then be charged with calming down their teammates
  before reporting back to the referee, who will use their discretion to restart
  play. The FA’s aim is to keep any break brief, “based on the seriousness of
  the situation and conditions”. Cooling-off periods is one of several measures
  that will be deployed in a new crackdown on discriminatory behaviour, abuse of
  officials and more general misconduct. They include an extension of the use of
  referee body-cams in all leagues with persistent disciplinary problems and the
  introduction of the captain’s-only protocol, whereby only the captain can
  discuss decisions with the referee, which is also to be adopted in the Premier
  League and Football League. The FA will also continue its “behaviour
  improvement programme”, introduced last year, by which clubs are ranked
  according to behaviour.
