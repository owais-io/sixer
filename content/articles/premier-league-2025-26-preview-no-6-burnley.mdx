  Guardian writers’ predicted position: 20th (NB: this is not necessarily Andy
  Hunter’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips) Last season’s
  position: 2nd in the Championship Prospects No club encapsulates the widening
  gulf between the top two tiers of English football quite like Burnley. Their
  record over the past four seasons reads: relegated from the Premier League
  with 35 points, promoted as champions of the Championship with 101 points,
  relegated from the Premier League again with 24 points and promoted from the
  Championship again with 100 points. Too strong for one league but not strong
  enough for the next, Burnley and their ambitious owners face a considerable
  challenge to turn the tide of recent history. Under Scott Parker, the newly
  promoted team are likely to adopt a more pragmatic approach to their Premier
  League return than last time under Vincent Kompany, although relegation didn’t
  do his career prospects any harm. Promotion was built on the back of an
  outstanding defence and survival may depend on a repeat performance. It is not
  only the step up in quality that casts doubt on those prospects, however, but
  the fact Parker has lost key components of the unit responsible for the best
  defensive record in English league history last season – a measly 16 goals in
  46 games – with 30 clean sheets kept along the way. CJ Egan-Riley has left for
  Marseille after rejecting Burnley’s offer of a new contract while goalkeeper
  James Trafford, who was named in the Championship Team of the Season for
  2024-25 alongside the central defender, has rejoined Manchester City. Survival
  hopes have been hit by their exits but at least Maxime Estève, who also had
  admirers, has stayed and signed a new five-year deal. Fielding an attack of
  Premier League calibre could also be a problem for Burnley. Midfielder and
  captain Josh Brownhill was the side’s top scorer last season but will follow
  Egan-Riley in leaving on a free transfer. Parker has added experience to the
  defence in Kyle Walker and Axel Tuanzebe. It will be required. The manager
  Scott Parker is on an identical mission to his club this season: both must
  break an unwelcome cycle to survive in the Premier League after their two
  previous attempts failed. Last season’s promotion was the third of the former
  England international’s managerial career and, along with Fulham and
  Bournemouth, achieved at the first time of asking. He has never reached a
  second successive season in the top flight as a manager, however, losing his
  job after suffering relegation with Fulham in 2021 and being sacked by
  Bournemouth after criticising their transfer policy after a 9-0 thrashing at
  Liverpool in 2022. Parker and Burnley will hope for third time lucky.
  Off-field picture The Clarets are set to become the latest team under
  multi-club ownership after Velocity Sport Limited (VSL), the sports arm of
  their investment group owners ALK Capital, agreed a deal to take over
  Espanyol. Former NFL star JJ Watt, a minority investor in Burnley, has
  confirmed he will be involved in buying the La Liga club. VSL will become
  majority shareholders at Espanyol with the Catalan club’s previous owners, the
  Chinese company Rastar Group, remaining involved. The deal is yet to be
  ratified but Espanyol have stated they will be independent from Burnley. Star
  signing Manchester City were willing to part company with Kyle Walker after
  eight years of stellar service and Milan opted against making last season’s
  loan move permanent, but it was still something of a surprise when the England
  international made Turf Moor the next step in his impressive career. At 35,
  the renowned pace may be slowing but the right-back remains fiercely
  competitive and will bring the leadership, experience and ability that Burnley
  will need to survive. Walker wanted to stay in the north-west and was sold on
  Burnley by Parker, his former Tottenham team-mate. The prospect of joining
  England’s 100 club – Walker currently has 96 caps – will also spur him on.
  Stepping up The 20-year-old striker Joe Westley will be looking to build on
  last season’s important breakthrough when he stepped up to the EFL for the
  first time. After loan spells with National League teams Fylde and Rochdale,
  Westley joined Swindon on a temporary deal in January and made an immediate
  impact with a goal on his League Two debut. He scored three goals in 17
  appearances for Ian Holloway’s side in total, having netted 13 times in 13
  games for Burnley’s under-21s in the first half of the season, and made his
  mark this pre-season with the winner in a friendly against Huddersfield. A big
  season for … Aaron Ramsey suffered a serious knee injury against Arsenal in
  February 2024, and it has been a long road back for the former England
  under-20 international. Ramsey, younger brother of Aston Villa’s Jacob, joined
  Burnley for £14m plus add-ons in 2023 but has been restricted to one brief
  substitute appearance for the first team in the 18 months since his injury.
  “It’s easy to be forgotten about when you’re not on the pitch,” the attacking
  midfielder admitted last season. Now fit and with a pre-season behind him, the
  22-year-old is on course for a welcome return. • This article was amended on 6
  August 2025. An earlier graphic said Burnley had won the Championship last
  season; in fact, they finished second.
