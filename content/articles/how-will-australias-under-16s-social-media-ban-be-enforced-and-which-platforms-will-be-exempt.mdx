  Australians using a range of social media platforms including Facebook,
  Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat and X will need to have their age checked to
  ensure they are 16 or older when the social media ban comes into effect from
  early December. Sign up: AU Breaking News email How will it work? And what
  information will people need to hand over? What does the social media ban
  apply to? From 10 December, new laws will apply to platforms that meet the
  government’s definition of an “age-restricted social media platform”, which
  has the sole or significant purpose of enabling social interaction with two or
  more users, and which allows users to post material on the service. The
  government has not specified by name any platforms that will be included in
  the ban, meaning any site that meets the above definition could be included
  except if they meet the exemptions released on Wednesday. The prime minister,
  Anthony Albanese, has said that the covered platforms include – but are not
  limited to – Facebook, Instagram, X, Snapchat, and YouTube. The communications
  minister, Anika Wells, said these platforms would be expected to take
  reasonable steps to deactivate accounts for users under 16, prevent children
  registering new accounts, check ages, and also prevent workarounds to bypass
  the restrictions. What are the exemptions? The government said platforms would
  be exempt if they had the primary purpose of: Messaging, emailing, voice
  calling or video calling Playing online games Sharing information about
  products or services Professional networking or professional development
  Education Health Communication between educational institutions and students
  or their families Facilitating communication between providers of healthcare
  and people using those providers’ services It will be up to the eSafety
  commissioner to determine which platforms meet the criteria for an exemption.
  In practice, this means that LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Roblox, and Coursera would
  likely be exempt if assessed to meet the criteria. LinkedIn had previously
  argued to the government it was not of interest to children. In theory, it
  could also mean YouTube Kids could be exempt from the ban if it meets the
  criteria for an exemption, given it does not allow comments on videos. But the
  government has not confirmed this, and YouTube has not commented on whether it
  would seek an exemption for its service designed for children. What about
  other platforms? Platforms that have not been named by the government but do
  not meet the exemption criteria will also need to consider whether they need
  to bring in age assurance by December. This would include services such as
  Bluesky, Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform, Discord and Twitch. How will
  tech companies check that users are over 16? A common misconception about the
  social media ban is that it will only apply to children. In order to ensure
  teenagers remain off social media, the platforms will need to check the ages
  of all user accounts in Australia. How they will do that is not prescribed,
  but it will be informed by the outcome of the age assurance technology trial,
  the full report of which is due in August. The government has legislated that
  although ID checks can be one form of age assurance, it can’t be the only one
  accepted. It is expected Australia will follow a similar path for age
  assurance that launched in the UK in July, which includes options such as:
  Allowing banks and mobile providers to confirm a user is over 18 Asking site
  users to upload a photo that is then matched with photo ID Use of facial age
  estimation technology In addition to that, platforms could infer user ages
  based on account behaviour or age. For example, if you signed up for Facebook
  in 2009, you would be over 16 by now. YouTube has also flagged it will use
  artificial intelligence to determine user ages. Won’t kids find ways around
  it? Albanese has compared the social media ban to alcohol restrictions, and
  said there will no doubt be children who manage to get around the ban, but he
  argued it was still worth doing. In the UK, where age verification was brought
  in this week for accessing pornography websites, there has been a surge in
  people using virtual private networks (VPNs), which hide a user’s real
  location, enabling access to blocked websites. Four of the top five free apps
  on the Apple app store in the UK on Thursday were VPN apps, with Proton, the
  most popular, reporting a 1,800% increase in downloads. The Australian
  government has said it expects the platforms will implement “reasonable steps”
  to account for how teens may seek to avoid the ban. What happens if sites
  don’t comply with the ban? Platforms that do not take what the eSafety
  commissioner determines to be “reasonable steps” to keep kids off their
  service can face a fine of up to $49.5m that will be determined in the federal
  court. What “reasonable steps” means will be up to the commissioner to
  determine. When asked on Wednesday, Wells said: “I think reasonable steps is
  reasonable. “These are meant to be working rules, and they also need to sort
  of correct any errors as they arise. Because these are not set-and-forget
  rules, these are set-and-support rules. They are world-leading. But this is
  manifestly too important for us not to have a crack.”
