  greater heights?

  Taylor Swift’s podcast interview with her American football player boyfriend,
  Travis Kelce, this week yielded plenty of tidbits for fans. Across two hours
  of loose chat on New Heights, the show Kelce helms with his brother Jason –
  also a football player – Swift revealed she was obsessed with sourdough and
  lurked on baking blogs. The couple spent the summer with her family, caring
  for her 73-year-old father, Scott, after he had a quintuple heart bypass. She
  gave Kelce a lesson on Hamlet and taught him how to avoid internalising
  speculation about their two-year relationship. You could call them the
  tentpoles of the 35-year-old pop star’s brand: literary passions and
  professional self-awareness. One surprising revelation came near the end.
  Until the record-breaking 149-date Eras tour that Swift mounted from 2023-24,
  she said she had “never allowed myself to say: ‘You’ve arrived. You’ve made
  it.’” Being the only artist to win the Grammy for album of the year four times
  hadn’t done it; not the records broken, the acclaimed shifts from country to
  mainstream pop to indie. Nor her staggeringly successful campaign to re-record
  her first six albums to devalue their master recordings, sold by her first
  record label to an industry nemesis, and then on to a private equity company.
  “But the Eras tour,” she said, “I was like, this is nothing like what I’ve
  experienced before. It was so much better than anything else.” Eras
  leapfrogged becoming the first billion-dollar tour to become the first $2bn
  tour. That would be plenty of cause for celebration and a good long rest. So
  would, as Swift announced in May, finally owning the rights to those first six
  albums, having successfully negotiated to buy the asset outright. (It ended
  her re-recording project: her 2006 debut is done and waiting, and she barely
  started 2017’s Reputation.) Her legacy isn’t just culturally assured, but
  materially secure. But Swift evidently isn’t ready to let that feeling of
  having “made it” go. She appeared on New Heights to announce her 12th album,
  The Life of a Showgirl, arriving just 18 months after its predecessor and 10
  months after Eras concluded: she is apparently congenitally incapable of rest,
  with a lot to process. The public will – correctly – have long assumed that
  Swift has well and truly made it like no one ever has. But the record’s
  promised contents, intentions and release strategy are set to make Swift – and
  Kelce alongside her – hysterically famous at a new level, capitalising on and
  shifting industry norms in a way that may leave her detractors researching
  bunkers in which to hide from it all. *** Swift’s new album does not arrive
  until 3 October, but this week’s edition of the industry newsletter Record of
  the Day led with a tongue-in-cheek congratulations to “everyone at EMI and
  Taylor Swift on her latest No 1 album The Life of a Showgirl”. Supernova
  success is a foregone conclusion: last year’s introspective The Tortured Poets
  Department (TTPD) was the first album to pass a billion streams in its first
  week, reaching 1.76bn. Swift is beloved on an unfathomable scale. She is one
  of the last monocultural pop stars. You suspect she could have toured Eras for
  five years and still sold out every night. Her devout Swifties, casual pop
  fans and curious rubberneckers will likely propel Showgirl past TTPD’s record,
  such is the critical mass behind her, no matter what it sounds like. Her
  reign, says Annie Zaleski, the author of Taylor Swift: The Stories Behind the
  Songs, is unprecedented because “she’s so consistent and continuing to
  evolve”. But on the podcast, Swift sounded surprisingly aware of the
  limitations of TTPD – too wordy, too long, too downbeat – and keen to
  course-correct. That project, she said, had been about “catharsis”, “mess” and
  “rawness” following an apparently humiliating fling with the 1975’s Matty
  Healy. TTPD comprised 16 songs; and on release day, Swift dropped a previously
  unannounced 15-track sister album, The Anthology. For Showgirl, she said she
  craved “focus and discipline”: just 12 songs going behind the scenes of her
  Eras life, with “melodies that were so infectious you’re almost angry”. She
  made a surprising admission about her recent quality control: “Keeping the bar
  really high is something I’ve been wanting to do for a very long time.” Swift
  recorded Showgirl with the Swedish co-producers Max Martin and Shellback in
  Stockholm around Eras’ spring 2024 European run. The second of her three dates
  in the Swedish capital was the 89th date of the Eras tour: she named her fifth
  album, partly produced by the Swedes, 1989 after her birth year. Given the
  endless number games she plays, sowing numerology clues for fans setting up
  her future movements, you can assume the scheduling was no accident. Martin
  and Shellback co-produced Red (2012), 1989 (2014) and Reputation (2017), homes
  to her biggest pure-pop smashes, among them Style, 22, and Blank Space. Her
  first subsequent album without them, 2019’s playful Lover, was regarded as
  ending that imperial period. Since then, Swift’s music has grown more muted
  and experimental, often in collaboration with the producers Jack Antonoff and
  the National’s Aaron Dessner, as if she were trying to carve out a sustainable
  future for a 30-something songwriter: 2020’s folksy Folklore and Evermore, the
  dusky pop of 2022’s Midnights, TTPD. They spawned no comparable radio hits;
  her biggest in recent years is Lover’s Cruel Summer, never officially released
  as a single but adopted as a fan favourite. Swift now seems to be framing
  those records as a phase – her art school years. The Showgirl era seems to be
  an attempt to recapture the kind of musical ubiquity where little kids yell
  your lyrics at birthday parties, as they did with 2014’s Shake It Off and now
  do with songs such as Chappell Roan’s Hot to Go! “My business is making music
  and taking care of my fans and I have ways of monitoring what they want from
  me and how best to entertain them, which is my job,” she told the Kelces. Eras
  was divided into segments reflecting each of her albums (except her 2006
  debut): imagine it as a 149-night focus group. Swift’s monitoring also cannot
  have failed to note that her brand of hermetically sealed, grown-up pop has
  been ceding ground to Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and Charli xcx, who have seized
  culture’s centre with less inhibited and far rowdier hits than the exacting
  Swift has ever made. Or perhaps ever could: one insurmountable difference is
  that Roan and xcx are unlikely to ever monitor fan desire or cater to it. And
  Martin, despite being second only to John Lennon and Paul McCartney for having
  the most US No 1 singles, has waned as a hitmaker. “I don’t think she can get
  ahead of those artists because she’s such a millennial pop star,” said a
  publicist for comparably superstar acts who asked to remain nameless. “She
  can’t create trends like those younger artists because they have a lot less to
  lose.” There is a sense that Swift is catching up: that she’s clocked
  criticisms, read the room. She released 19 physical variants for TTPD, and was
  accused of exploiting fans and damaging the environment with excess vinyl
  production, a practice Billie Eilish has called “wasteful”. Showgirl appears
  to have a fairly industry-standard four. She is also competing with herself:
  if there is a tour, says the music business expert Eamonn Forde, it will have
  to take a significantly different form to Eras – residency-style, perhaps
  Vegas or in a bespoke venue, as recently done by Adele – to avoid unfavourable
  comparisons to the biggest tour of all time. *** Swift drew mass media
  coverage for her appearances at Kelce’s games with the Kansas City Chiefs,
  prompting some aggrieved football fans to boo whenever she appeared on the
  jumbotron. In a trailer for her episode of New Heights, traditionally a sports
  show, Swift joked: “I think we all know that if there’s one thing that male
  sports fans want to see in their spaces and on their screens, it’s more of
  me.” Unluckily for them, the brand-building between Kelce and Swift looks set
  to make their association unavoidable. New Heights is part of their lore:
  after Kelce tried and failed to land a meeting with Swift after an Eras show,
  he told listeners he wanted to meet her. Intrigued, she took him up on it. The
  synchronicity began. It can be no mistake that Kelce’s cover of GQ magazine
  landed the same week as Swift’s podcast. Meanwhile, Swift rarely gives
  interviews: New Heights offers a mutually beneficial space where the couple
  wield full control, albeit with a soft touch: giving cute disclosures, such as
  his love of wild otters or her running to tell him about getting her masters
  back when he was gaming with the boys. The moment capitalised on the
  prevailing trend for A-listers to reserve their media engagements for fairly
  fannish video podcasts, making traditional journalists fear for their jobs as
  they dutifully write up any news lines. Premiering Wednesday night in the US,
  the episode livestream crashed; within 24 hours it had 13m YouTube views, not
  including other podcast platform stats. The value to advertisers is huge,
  especially in anticipation of future Swift revelations. And Kelce, a
  comparatively old player at 35, is rumoured to be retiring after the coming
  season – his 13th year, Swift’s lucky number – so will be power-brokering his
  post-game career. He admitted to GQ he had literally taken his eye off the
  ball, with underwhelming stats in his past two seasons, because he was chasing
  other opportunities. “It’s his Steven Bartlett, Diary of a CEO move,” said the
  publicist. “It’s future-proofing their lives. He can’t be a football player
  for ever; she can’t be a pop star for ever. It makes them a unit – look at how
  it worked for the Beckhams.” After a backlash around 2015-16 resulting from
  her beef with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, Swift managed to convincingly
  reboot her brand: a dedicated, literary songwriter who fights for artists’
  rights. To onlookers outside the NFL, Kelce’s is ripe for shaping from two
  years of dating Swift. The couple are clearly conscious of this: Kelce told GQ
  he had “become way more strategic in understanding what I am portraying to
  people”, something you may imagine constitutes pillow talk in a
  business-minded household. “No man has ever said those words,” said the
  publicist. Kelce’s image is openhearted romantic. Notably, he is Swift’s first
  significant boyfriend to seem undaunted by her celebrity – her previous
  six-year relationship with the British actor Joe Alwyn took place almost
  entirely in private. A sweet aspect of the New Heights episode was two beefy
  jocks being so excited by and supportive of a girly pop star. Swift joked of
  his public entreaty to date her that “this is sort of what I’ve been writing
  songs about wanting to happen to me since I was a teenager”. The couple riffed
  on memes questioning Kelce’s intelligence – “it’s so hot when she says big
  words,” he said when Swift called Folklore “esoteric” – which is in itself
  very smart: positioning Kelce as lovable and non-threatening. Swift said she
  immediately warmed to him for not being “judgmental”, describing him as “a
  vibe booster in everyone’s life … like a human exclamation point”. The
  implication is that he could pep up your sentences if you let him into your
  heart. Kelce’s post-football business is being everyone’s boyfriend, not just
  Swift’s. His pesky family ties to Maga Trumpists won’t hurt him in the US; if
  Swift, who endorsed Kamala Harris in the last election, were to be questioned
  about this, “her argument can be that she’s the leftwing voice in these
  rooms”, the publicist said. Win-win. Although Swift seemed keen to establish
  some distance from the voluble TTPD era, a song from The Anthology about her
  and Kelce’s relationship seems to outline her present mindset. “I’m making a
  comeback to where I belong,” she sings on The Alchemy. “Ditch the clowns, get
  the crown / Baby, I’m the one to beat … These blokes warm the benches / We’ve
  been on a winning streak.” That streak is assured: next year marks the 20th
  anniversary of Swift’s self-titled debut, and she will inevitably release the
  re-recording to mark the occasion. Showgirl’s successor will be her 13th
  album, a significant moment in her lore. There are rumours of a
  behind-the-scenes Eras documentary to complement the record-breaking concert
  movie, extending the moment’s IP. Any new tour will once again recalibrate the
  live industry. Before Swift drops a note of music, or Kelce touches grass,
  they’re the coming season’s reigning champions.
