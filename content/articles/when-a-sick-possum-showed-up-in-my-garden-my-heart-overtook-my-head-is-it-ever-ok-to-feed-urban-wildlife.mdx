  When a sick possum showed up in my garden my heart overtook my head. Is it
  ever OK to feed urban wildlife?

  Chopping vegetables in my kitchen on a winter afternoon, I was startled by the
  sound of rustling branches and loud coughing coming from my back yard. I
  walked outside tentatively, prepared to face a fence-hopping intruder.
  Instead, after a few minutes of listening to evenly timed wheezes, I spotted
  it – a small brushtail possum, tucked behind lilly-pilly branches bowing over
  my fence. Through the leaves, two black eyes peered desperately into the
  afternoon sun, eyelids dotted with pus. Its pink nose was swollen and its body
  and limbs were a patchwork of rashes, with pieces of fur missing across its
  torso. Huffing and bloodied, the possum looked like a once-loved teddy bear –
  greying, losing its stuffing and left to decay in the garden. My bleeding
  heart took over my head and I dashed inside and grabbed a bag of frozen
  berries, dumping a handful in a glass of water to thaw before wandering out
  and dropping a few wet fruits on the fence. Sign up for the fun stuff with our
  rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday
  morning Over the afternoon I watched the sick possum pick up berries, nibbling
  while purple juice dripped off its chin. As the sun set it put its head into
  its chest, wheezing itself to sleep. Feeding native wildlife is a divisive
  topic. While some throw mince to kookaburras with wild abandon, others tut
  tut, insisting it’s best to let them fend for themselves. I called the
  wildlife rescue organisation Wires, which advised us to capture the possum so
  it could receive veterinary care. As my husband slowly approached with an old
  bath towel, in a scene not dissimilar from the 1931 film Dracula, the possum
  suddenly reanimated, screeched loudly then scampered into the night. Despite
  its terror it was clearly tempted by the prospect of more thawed-out berries
  because a few days later it returned. But I was not keen on trying to catch
  the possum again. After seeing it thrash around in fear, I worried that the
  stress of the ordeal might actually hasten its death. Diligently, and against
  best advice, I began leaving food for it. Providing slices of apple and carrot
  seemed like a neighbourly thing to do. But regular offerings might harm an
  animal more than they help. Brushtail possums in a natural environment eat
  native shrubs, plants and leaves. This is why a professor of behavioural
  ecology at the University of Sydney, Clare McArthur, says feeding brushtail
  possums should largely be avoided: “What are we doing to their gut flora? How
  good is [the food] we’re feeding them? “If they become reliant on us, what
  happens when we go away?” John Grant from Wires says feeding poses other
  risks, too. “They can also become ‘humanised’ and lose their natural fear of
  potential predators including domestic pets,” he says. “Possums (and native
  birds) are best fed with native foliage, so planting native trees and shrubs
  endemic to your area helps provide them with a natural food source.” Male
  possums being routinely fed can also become stressed when other males, keen
  for an opportunistic meal, encroach on their territory, which they naturally
  want to defend, according to a Taronga veterinary nurse, Annii Downing.
  McArthur says giving a brushtail the odd piece of healthy food might not be a
  cardinal sin. “Now and then, it would be OK, because one of the virtues is
  that we start to value the wildlife around us. So it’s not a yes or no thing.
  It’s a fine line.” While official advice on wild animal feeding skews
  negative, Prof emeritus Darryl Jones from Griffith University agrees that
  responsibly interacting with urban wildlife can increase people’s compassion
  for animals. “No wild animals in Australia need extra food,” Jones says. “The
  reality is, millions of people every single day are feeding birds, and can’t
  find any information.” Compelled to counter this information void with facts,
  the behavioural ecologist, bird feeder and author of 10 books wrote a popular
  Australian field guide to urban birds, Feeding the Birds at Your Table. “If
  you Google ‘What should I feed my magpies’ you’ll get inundated with huge
  amounts of negativity,” he says. “That’s my thing … to reconnect people with
  nature. “Only when people care about, look for, observe and just try and
  understand the wildlife around us will they care enough to protect them.
  “That’s the big philosophical side to this.” Just under a year on, I still see
  the possum on our fence. Its wounds have healed, it no longer wheezes or
  wobbles. Instead it has taken to chewing my veggie patch, gnawing rainbow
  chard and parsley down to the mulch line every few days. While I used to enjoy
  my own harvest, I now laugh at what the picky possum has chosen and wonder why
  it doesn’t like lemon thyme. Some nights, it seems as though there’s been a
  possum party. I wake to lilly-pilly fruits strewn like confetti across our
  concrete back yard. And every so often my husband still leaves out an apple
  slice for the possum. Even though we know we shouldn’t. Philosophically,
  though, I think it is sound.
