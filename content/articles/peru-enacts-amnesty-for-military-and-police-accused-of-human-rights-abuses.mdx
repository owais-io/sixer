  Human rights groups and families of victims of Peru’s two-decade internal
  armed conflict have expressed outrage after the country’s government granted a
  blanket amnesty for all military and police officers accused of human rights
  crimes from 1980 to 2000. The Peruvian president, Dina Boluarte, signed the
  amnesty – which was approved by the country’s congress last month – into law
  on Wednesday, to the applause of military top brass and ministers at Lima’s
  government palace. The legislation prevents the criminal prosecution and
  conviction of former soldiers, police officers and self-defence committee
  fighters accused of serious human rights violations in the country’s fight
  against leftist insurgents of the Mao-inspired Shining Path and other groups.
  Gisela Ortiz, the sister of one of the victims of a 1992 death squad massacre,
  said on X: “A government that violates human rights enacts an amnesty law for
  those who support it: police and military personnel who murdered, disappeared
  and raped between 1980 and 2000.” Juanita Goebertus, Americas director at
  Human Rights Watch, described the law as a betrayal of Peruvian victims. “It
  undermines decades of efforts to ensure accountability for atrocities and
  weakens the country’s rule of law even further,” she said. The brutal and
  protracted conflict was marked by atrocities committed by both sides. Between
  1980 and 2000, nearly 70,000 people were killed and 20,000 disappeared,
  according to the findings of Peru’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission;
  Shining Path fighters were responsible for about 54% of the deaths and the
  military for the rest. Boluarte said: “With the enactment of this amnesty law,
  the Peruvian government and congress recognise the sacrifice of members of the
  armed forces, the police and self-defence groups in the fight against
  terrorism.” She added: “We’re giving them back the dignity that should never
  have been questioned.” There has been widespread concern about backsliding on
  human rights under Boluarte’s government. In 2023, the former president
  Alberto Fujimori was released from prison, where he was serving a 25-year term
  for human rights crimes, despite a request from the regional inter-American
  court of human rights to delay his release. Last year, Peru’s congress
  approved a bill establishing a statute of limitations for war crimes and
  crimes against humanity committed before 2003. The UN Human Rights Commission
  expressed alarm about the amnesty bill in July, warning Peru that it had a
  “duty to investigate, prosecute, and punish serious human rights violations”
  and that “international standards prohibit amnesties or pardons for such
  serious crimes”. Peruvian courts have secured more than 150 convictions, and
  an estimated 600 investigations are under way, according to the National Human
  Rights Coordinator, a coalition of Peruvian human rights organisations. “This
  amnesty law is a law that consecrates impunity,” said Jo-Marie Burt, a Peru
  expert and senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America. “Peru is
  now a pariah state from the point of view of international law. It puts Peru
  on the same level as Venezuela and Nicaragua for their outright disregard for
  the rulings of the inter-American court and of international law more
  generally.” She expressed disappointment at what she called a “cynical move”,
  especially as Peru “for many years did make meaningful efforts to bring
  perpetrators of serious human rights violations to justice”.
