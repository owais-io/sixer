  In the intimacy of a blacked-out theatre, the smell of freshly made coffee,
  cheap perfume and stuffed peppers becomes more pronounced. The weight of each
  character’s footsteps become recognisable. Welcome to the Blind Theater from
  Brazil, where every scent is a prop, and an actor’s breathing and tread are
  their character’s signatures. Before their Edinburgh fringe show begins, the
  blind actor Edgar Jacques briefs the audience on what to expect when they
  enter the entirely darkened space. It is a fringe first and will be an
  unusual, perhaps unsettling experience, he warns the sighted. Sitting in pitch
  dark will “reach your other senses, and use your other senses. You will listen
  to things, you will smell things and maybe things will touch you, like the
  wind or maybe the rain.” Before audiences line up single file, one hand
  resting on the shoulder of the person in front, everyone is cautioned to
  switch off their mobile phones and smartwatches, and to avoid stretching their
  legs in the small auditorium, where production staff taped out light leaking
  under the theatre door. Although well established in São Paulo, the Blind
  Theater (Teatro Cego) production of Another Sight is one of several shows
  designed for visually impaired audiences being staged by the venue group Zoo
  for the first time at this year’s festival. Another theatre company, Extant,
  has teamed up with the charity Sight Scotland and artists’ collective Visually
  Impaired Creators Scotland to put on three “enhanced” performances, which
  include touch tours of the shows and live audio description over headphones.
  One semi-autobiographical Extant production, I Dream in Colour, was written by
  a fully blind writer Jasmin Thein. It recounts the trauma of a blind woman
  forced to weigh up losing her remaining eye owing to a tumour or risking
  cancer. Another Sight, played by blind and sighted actors, examines Brazil’s
  class system and the politics of disability. It explores the tensions between
  a wealthy woman, Grace, confronting a cancer diagnosis, when her maid, Maria,
  returns to work as Grace’s domestic while she completes her own treatment for
  cancer. Anxious to work again despite being clearly fragile and diminished by
  her chemotherapy, her presence triggers a powerful reaction from her employer.
  Their respective husbands, including Jacques, act as peace-makers. For
  Jacques, the darkness offers him an equality that conventional theatre
  productions do not. Unlike on a fully lit stage, he is no longer defined by
  his disability or his physical movements and posture which, as a blind person,
  can be different from the sighted. “We open this universe for blind actors to
  play not just blind characters, but the good guy, the bad guy, the princess,
  the frog, everybody. So in the darkness, a blind person can be like anybody
  else,” he told the audience earlier this week. For Ana Righi, a fully sighted
  actor who played Grace, that means she has to emphasise the sound of her feet
  and voice far more deliberately. Facial expressions, makeup and physical
  movement are irrelevant. Speaking through an interpreter, Righi said that
  changes “a lot of elements … especially using breathing to express emotions”.
  Actors move through the audience, which sits close to the small stage in a
  semi-circle, adding a spatial dimension by working in different parts of the
  room. Grace has “a very stiff, secure step, whereas the maid has a very timid
  step, like a person who’s always afraid”. Another Sight is part of a series
  showcasing theatre, dance and clowning from São Paulo supported by the state
  government, the Brazilian consulate in Edinburgh and the local arts
  association Associação Paulista dos Amigos da Arte. Paulo Palado, the show’s
  director, said blind actors were normally expected to play only blind
  characters. The approach taken in Another Sight lifted that restriction. The
  company realised the power of that only during their first show 13 years ago;
  they now have seven plays in that format. Sensory perceptions are essential,
  Palado said. Those can include fans to provide a breeze or, in some shows,
  rain. It can be a special experience for unsighted audiences, too, who
  normally have audio description telling them what is happening in conventional
  theatre. In this show blind and sighted people “are all in exactly the same
  situation. We have the same information. In this case audio description is not
  necessary because that language is for all.” Another Sight runs at Playground
  2 at Zoo Playground from 1-24 August • This article was amended on 11 August
  2025. The actor Ana Righi spoke with the help of an interpreter, not a
  translator as an earlier version said; translators work with written words
  whereas interpreters deal with spoken words.
