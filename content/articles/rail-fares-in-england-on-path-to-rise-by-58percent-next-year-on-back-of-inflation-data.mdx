  Train fares in England are now expected to rise by a higher-than-expected 5.8%
  next year, prompting concern among passenger groups. Rail ticket increases are
  usually calculated by adding one percentage point to July’s inflation reading
  on the retail prices index (RPI), which came in 0.2 points above forecasts on
  Wednesday at 4.8%. The government has not yet confirmed how it will calculate
  rail fare increases for 2026 regulated fares, which account for about half of
  rail journeys. They would rise by 5.8% if ministers follow the pattern of last
  year, when they rose by 4.6% in March – one percentage point above the RPI
  reading from July 2024. This would be higher than the 5.6% increase that had
  been predicted, after both the consumer and retail prices index measures of
  inflation rose more than expected in July, fuelled by higher food prices and
  travel costs, particularly air fares. Before the publication of July’s
  inflation figures, passenger groups had warned that such fare increases risked
  pricing out some passengers, at a time of a squeeze on consumers’ wallets,
  including rising food prices. Almost half of rail fares in England are set
  directly by Westminster. The devolved Scottish and Welsh governments usually
  cap fares at a similar level. Regulated fares include season tickets on most
  commuter journeys, off-peak returns on long-distance routes and flexible
  tickets for urban rail. A 5.8% increase in rail fares would result in the cost
  of an annual season ticket for travel between Gloucester and Birmingham rising
  by £312 from £5,384 to £5,696, while an annual season ticket between Woking
  and London would climb by £247 from £4,260 to £4,507. The Department for
  Transport (DfT) said there would be an update on changes to regulated fares
  later this year, but no decisions had yet been made on next year’s rates.
  Train operators set increases for unregulated fares, although these are
  expected to be in line with rises in regulated fares. Recent official figures
  showed unregulated long-distance advance fares climbed by 5.9% for the
  financial year ending in March 2025, according to data from the Office of Rail
  and Road, at the same time as regulated fares rose by 4.6%, after the
  government’s decision to set regulated rail fare increases at 1% above the RPI
  rate in July 2024. Labour is nationalising train operators as their current
  contracts expire, while it is setting up Great British Railways, which will
  oversee Britain’s rail infrastructure and train operations. Bruce Williamson,
  a spokesperson for the campaign group Railfuture, said the inflation figure
  was “even worse than expected”. He said: “The government dare not add another
  1% on top of that. When you have got increasing food prices it is making life
  harder for your average person who is trying to get work.” Pointing out that
  fuel excise duty – the tax paid on fuel at the pump – has been frozen for 15
  years by successive chancellors, Williamson said: “It is about time rail
  travellers got a break rather than motorists being sweetened up every time.”
  The transport charity Campaign for Better Transport called on the government
  to do more for passengers. “With the railways now moving under public control,
  the fundamental question for the government is how to use its role in setting
  fares policy to deliver a more affordable rail network and encourage more
  people to travel on it,” said Ben Plowden, the group’s chief executive, in a
  social media post. “Next year’s annual rise represents the first real
  opportunity for the government to show passengers – both current and future –
  just how it plans to do this.” Rail fares have risen by more than inflation
  for more than 25 years, apart from in 2023, when the previous government said
  it was making its “biggest ever intervention” on rail fares at a time of
  soaring inflation after the coronavirus pandemic. Despite this intervention,
  fares rose by up to 5.9% in March 2023. A DfT spokesperson said: “The
  transport secretary has made clear her No 1 priority is getting the railways
  back to a place where people can rely on them. No decisions have been made on
  next year’s rail fares but our aim is that prices balance affordability for
  both passengers and taxpayers.”
