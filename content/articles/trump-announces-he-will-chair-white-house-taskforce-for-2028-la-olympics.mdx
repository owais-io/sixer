  Donald Trump announced on Tuesday the creation of a White House taskforce that
  he will lead to oversee elements of the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. The
  president signed an executive order establishing the taskforce, which will
  include JD Vance as well as other cabinet members and government officials.
  The body will work with local and state authorities on security and
  transportation for the first Games in the US in nearly three decades. Trump
  will chair the taskforce, while Vance will serve as vice-chair and an
  executive director will oversee “daily operations”, according to the White
  House. “The LA Olympics is shaping up to be a wonderful moment for America.
  It’s going to be incredible,” Trump said. With the Olympics just three years
  away, Los Angeles has been rushing to prepare for the Games, which are
  expected to attract millions of people over the course of 16 days. The city
  has been planning for the event for years. In recent weeks, city leaders have
  been engaged in what the Los Angeles Times described as “high-stakes”
  negotiations with LA28, the committee managing the event, over the use of city
  staff, including police officers. Meanwhile, a proposed ballot measure could
  require some Olympic venues to receive approval from voters in order to be
  used. The preparations come at a challenging time for LA. The devastating
  wildfires that tore through the area in January and recovery efforts have
  strained the region’s finances. Meanwhile, the city has clashed fiercely with
  the Trump administration over aggressive immigration raids in the region and
  the deployment of US troops into the city over the objections of city and
  state leaders. Still, LA mayor Karen Bass has said the city will be ready to
  host the Olympics. And during the peak of this summer’s protests, the former
  International Olympic Committee president, Thomas Bach, expressed confidence
  in the “strong” city and said the Games have the support of US leaders. “With
  regard to LA, we have the full support of the president of the United States
  and the governor of California and the mayor of Los Angeles for the success of
  these Olympic Games,” Bach told the Associated Press in June before he stepped
  down. Trump’s announcement of the taskforce displayed his strong support for
  the LA Olympicsand his contentious relationship with the region’s leaders. In
  the past, Trump has frequently touted his support for hosting the Games in Los
  Angeles and his recent budget bill allocates $1bn for security, planning and
  other Olympic-related costs. At the White House on Tuesday, the president said
  that the city is “a little bit of a different place” than it was when selected
  in 2017, but “we’re gonna bring it back stronger than ever”. Trump said that
  the federal government would consider using the national guard or military
  during the games, and criticized Bass, calling her “not very competent”, along
  with California governor Gavin Newsom. The taskforce will “streamline visa
  processing and credentialing” for participants and media, the White House said
  in a statement. The order also directs various government departments, as well
  as the FBI and the Secret Service to use “every tool at their disposal” to
  ensure a safe Olympics, the president said. He also heralded his
  administration’s crackdown on transgender athletes, telling reporters that the
  US will not let “men steal trophies from women”. During Tuesday’s
  announcement, the chair and president of LA28 expressed appreciation to the
  administration for its “extraordinary” support and praised the creation of the
  taskforce. “You’ve been supportive and helpful every step of the way, and we
  wouldn’t be here without you,” Casey Wasserman said. “And now with the
  creation of this taskforce, we’ve unlocked the opportunity to level up our
  planning and deliver the largest and yes, greatest Games for our nation ever.”
