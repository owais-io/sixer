  When did people start going on holiday? Valentina Otero, Mexico City Send new
  questions to nq@theguardian.com. Readers reply Only a privileged few could
  afford to go on holiday in pre-industrial times (and before the advent of the
  railways). The earliest known holiday postcard, however, dates back to Roman
  times. The text, in full, reads: “Gallia est omnis divisa in partes tres.
  Utinam hic esses.” EddieChorepost People certainly went on holiday during the
  Roman empire – actually travelling, not just nipping off to your villa on the
  coast for the summer, as many rich people did – because we’ve found the
  souvenirs. There are at least two “A present from Hadrian’s Wall” cups,
  decorated with names of major forts. SpoilheapSurfer Well, the first to have a
  holiday was God – according to Genesis, that is. (Not sure which album,
  though.) If organised holidays are meant, for “hoi polloi”, not the grand tour
  aristos, then Thomas Cook arranged everything on 5 July 1841 for a group of
  temperance campaigners to travel the vast distance between Leicester and
  Loughborough to attend a rally. Apparently, refreshments were included: cakes,
  but no ale. For cakes and ale, it was necessary to wait until Cook had changed
  his mind and started taking the great unwashed to Spain; things really started
