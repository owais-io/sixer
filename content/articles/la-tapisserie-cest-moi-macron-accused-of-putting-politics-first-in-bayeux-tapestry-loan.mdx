  The Bayeux tapestry is so fragile that transporting it risks irreparable
  damage, French experts have said, as a petition urging Emmanuel Macron to
  reverse a “catastrophic” decision to loan the unique embroidery to Britain
  passed 60,000 signatures. France’s president declared in July that the nearly
  1,000-year-old, 70-metre-long wool-on-linen artwork, which depicts William the
  Conqueror’s victory over King Harold II of England at Hastings in 1066, would
  cross the Channel next year. For nine months from September 2026, it is due to
  be on display at the British Museum, whose director, Nicholas Cullinan, has
  called it “one of the most important and unique cultural artefacts in the
  world”, symbolic of a millennium of shared history between Britain and France.
  French conservators who have worked on the embroidery, however, say it is so
  fragile as to be essentially untransportable, and the organiser of a campaign
  against the loan argues Macron has ignored near-unanimous expert advice for a
  grand political gesture. “I’m not against the loan of cultural artefacts and I
  have always liked the UK,” said Didier Rykner, the editorial director of La
  Tribune de l’Art, an art news website, whose month-old petition against the
  loan has been signed by nearly 62,000 people. “But this is a purely political
  decision. Here is an extraordinary work of art, a wholly unique historical
  document, an artefact without equivalent anywhere – and which expert opinion
  agrees, overwhelmingly, cannot travel. It’s not complicated.” Macron first
  suggested lending the Bayeux tapestry to the UK – as previously requested by
  London, and rejected by Paris, for the coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953 and,
  in 1966, for the 900th anniversary of the Battle of Hastings – in 2018.
  Conceived as the sort of momentous cultural offer that might help sustain
  British ties to the continent even as it was preparing to quit the EU, the
  plan foundered as cross-Channel relations soured during the bitter Brexit
  negotiations and their aftermath. The idea was resurrected as relations
  gradually improved after Boris Johnson and Liz Truss left Downing St, and
  accelerated with Keir Starmer’s EU “reset”. French officials say King Charles
  was also instrumental and personally “very supportive” of the plan. But the
  loan agreement to celebrate cross-Channel reconciliation – which will also
  involve French museums displaying artefacts from the Anglo-Saxon burial site
  Sutton Hoo, and the Lewis Chessmen – ignores decades of warnings about the
  state of the tapestry. Housed since 1983 in a purpose-built museum in Bayeux
  due to close next month for a major two-year renovation, the fabric has been
  severely weakened by age but also, experts say, by being displayed suspended
  from a rail, rather than laid out flat. Some of the most damning arguments
  against the plan have come from curators and restorers who have worked or are
  working on the tapestry, five of whom have told Rykner – on condition of
  anonymity – of their disbelief and concern. Precisely because the tapestry was
  considered too fragile to move far, complex plans were already under way to
  remove it from display and store it during the museum’s rebuilding work, with
  a full restoration to follow once it was returned. “We fell off our chairs
  when we heard,” said one conservator. “It’s the opposite of all we had
  prepared for.” Any movement at all of the canvas, in a state of “absolute
  fragility”, was “fraught with risk, an incredibly delicate operation”, said
  another. Now the embroidery is set to be carried over a distance of possibly
  more than 500km (310 miles) “in its most fragile state, with its stabilising
  lining already removed, and before its restoration”, said a third. All
  emphasised that the thousands of existing weak spots would be strained, with
  every movement risking tears, and it seemed almost impossible that what would
  have to be an entirely new system of transporting the tapestry could be
  designed in time. “It’s discrediting our profession,” one said. “Not listening
  to us is like saying we’re useless.” A rare conservator to speak publicly,
  Thalia Bajon Bouzid, said any damage would be irreversible: “Tears would not
  be repaired, for reasons of authenticity.” The curators’ fears echo multiple
  previous expert warnings. As early as 2018, Antoine Verney, the chief curator
  at the Bayeux Museum, said he “could not conceive” of it being moved far. A
  report by eight antique textile experts in 2020 recommended a full
  restoration, identifying 24,204 stains, 16,445 creases, 9,646 deficiencies and
  30 “non-stabilised” tears, and a pre-restoration study in 2021 “advised
  strongly against transporting the tapestry over a long distance (for more than
  an hour)”. That study added: “The longer the timeframe for micro-alterations
  to occur, the greater the risk that visible and irreversible alterations will
  appear”, especially since “no vibration-absorption system currently exists
  that can eliminate all risk during transportation”. Yet another analysis the
  following year reached much the same conclusion, according to Le Monde – but
  remains confidential except to companies submitting tenders for a full
  feasibility study into the tapestry’s proposed removal to London, Rykner said.
  So far, the French government has barely acknowledged the experts’ concerns.
  Macron went out of his way to dismiss them, saying in July that France had
  “found the best experts of the world to explain in perfect detail” why the
  loan “was impossible”, but “we decided” otherwise. Philippe Bélaval, the
  president’s special adviser on the project, has insisted the tapestry is
  “absolutely not untransportable”, referring to an “extremely precise” – but
  confidential – report from early this year detailing what precautions must be
  taken. “Playing with words,” said Rykner. “The transport had already been
  decided, so it was not the job of this report – about which we know strictly
  nothing – to argue against it. Any artwork is transportable. The question is,
  in what condition will it arrive?” The fact of the matter, Rykner said, was
  that Macron, famously enamoured of both the grand theatrical gesture and
  making his own decisions, had placed politics over the conservation of an
  exceptionally vulnerable piece of cultural heritage. One of the tender
  documents related to the loan, Rykner said, contained what was probably a
  mistake, but a revealing one: “The loan of the Bayeux tapestry has been
  granted”, it reads, “by the President of the Republic, owner of the work …” In
  the 17th century, Louis XIV, the Sun King, apocryphally said: ‘“L’état, c’est
  moi” (“I am the state.”) This, Rykner said, was a case of “‘La tapisserie,
  c’est moi.’ It’s outrageous, and people are starting to see why it must be
  stopped.”
