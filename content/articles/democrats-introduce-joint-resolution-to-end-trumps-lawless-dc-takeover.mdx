  Democratic lawmakers have introduced a joint resolution aimed at ending what
  they call Trump’s unlawful and unprecedented move to federalize the
  Metropolitan police department (MPD) in Washington DC. Representative Jamie
  Raskin, the ranking member of the House judiciary committee; DC’s non-voting
  House delegate, Eleanor Holmes Norton; and representative Robert Garcia,
  ranking member of the House committee on oversight and government reform,
  introduced the resolution on Friday, invoking the District of Columbia Home
  Rule Act of 1973. The resolution states that Trump has not demonstrated the
  existence of any special emergency conditions that would warrant the
  federalization of the police force. In the Senate, Chris Van Hollen of
  Maryland will sponsor the resolution. “The only emergency here is a lawless
  president experiencing a growing public relations emergency because of his
  close friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and his stubborn refusal to release the
  Epstein file despite his promise to do so,” said Raskin in a statement shared
  with the Guardian. The Home Rule Act of 1973 states that DC residents have the
  authority to govern their local affairs, including by electing a mayor and
  local council members. But because DC is considered a “federal district”
  rather than a state, the president and Congress (where DC residents have no
  voting representatives) are given the legal ability to manage local laws and
  local tax dollars. Under the act, the president has limited power to
  temporarily take over the DC police department for “federal purposes” under
  “special conditions of an emergency”. On Monday, Trump signed an executive
  order granting himself direct control of the MPD in a highly controversial and
  suspected premeditated move. But lawmakers argue that the special conditions
  have not been met and that Congress has the authority to end such emergency
  control through a joint resolution. In a substantial development early on
  Friday evening, White House officials and attorneys for Washington DC agreed
  to scale back the executive order of the US attorney general, Pam Bondi,
  regarding the federal takeover of the city’s police department. Under the new
  agreement, DC’s Metropolitan police department will remain under the control
  of the DC police chief, Pamela Smith, instead of the Drug and Enforcement
  Administration’s top administrator, Terry Cole, according to reports.
  According to the joint resolution’s sponsors, the president has attempted to
  rationalize his decision to place local police under federal control and
  increase militarization of the city by pushing a misleading account of DC’s
  crime rate, which has actually declined for two consecutive years and recently
  hit its lowest point in three decades. “President Trump’s incursions against
  DC are among the most egregious attacks on DC home rule in decades,” said
  Norton. “DC residents are Americans, worthy of the same autonomy granted to
  residents of the states … No emergency exists in DC that the president did not
  create himself, and he is not using the DC Police for federal purposes, as
  required by law.” Lawmakers say that his actions have worsened public safety
  by blocking DC’s access to $1bn in locally generated funds intended for
  police, fire, emergency services and other safety programs. Additionally, the
  resolution notes that Trump has removed or reassigned many of DC’s
  prosecutors, creating a backlog in criminal cases and delaying justice for
  victims. He also pardoned or granted clemency to nearly 1,600 people involved
  in the January 6 attack on the US Capitol in 2021, including hundreds found
  guilty of assaulting law enforcement officers.
