  Welcome, readers, to Afternoon Update. Convicted rapist MP Gareth Ward will
  face an urgent court hearing on Thursday after he sought an injunction from
  the New South Wales supreme court to stop his parliamentary colleagues
  expelling him from the state parliament. The Minns government on Tuesday
  sought the hearing in the supreme court to lift an ex parte injunction granted
  the previous day to Ward. The injunction prevents parliament, until at least
  Thursday, from moving to expel Ward. The parliament faced a potential
  constitutional showdown with the state’s supreme court after the leader of the
  Legislative Assembly, Ron Hoenig, told reporters the government did not
  believe the court had the constitutional power to restrain the parliament or
  any member from moving a motion in the lower house. However, “out of respect
  for the court”, the parliament would apply for a more urgent hearing date,
  when it would seek to have the injunction lifted, Hoenig said. Ward has said
  he will appeal against his July criminal convictions on three counts of
  indecent assault and one for sexual intercourse without consent involving two
  young men in 2013 and 2015. Top news First Nations group launches federal
