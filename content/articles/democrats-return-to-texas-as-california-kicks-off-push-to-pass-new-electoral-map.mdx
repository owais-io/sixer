  Texas Democrats returned to their state on Monday as California lawmakers
  kicked off a rapid push for voters to approve a new congressional map that
  could add as many as five Democratic seats in the US House. The Texas
  Democrats’ return ends a two-week walkout that stalled the Republican effort
  to redraw the state’s congressional districts to satisfy Donald Trump’s
  demands to reshape the US House map in his favor ahead of the 2026 midterm
  elections. The California plan was drafted in response to Texas’s push to
  redraw the congressional map there. On Friday, Texas’s Republican governor,
  Greg Abbott, called a second special session after Democrats remained out of
  the state for two weeks, denying Republicans a quorum to conduct legislative
  business. The Democrats said last week they would return once California moved
  ahead with its counter-proposal, all but ensuring that Texas’s new maps will
  pass. The protest began on 3 August, when dozens of Texas Democrats left the
  state for Illinois and other blue states in a high-stakes bid to deny their
  Republican colleagues the quorum needed to approve the redrawn maps. Although
  the Democrats’ return allows Republicans to advance their redistricting plan,
  the quorum-breakers have declared their two-week walkout a strategic success
  that set off a “redistricting arms race”. “We killed the corrupt special
  session, withstood unprecedented surveillance and intimidation and rallied
  Democrats nationwide to join this existential fight for fair representation –
  reshaping the entire 2026 landscape,” Gene Wu, the chair of the Texas house
  democratic caucus, said. “We’re returning to Texas more dangerous to
  Republicans’ plans than when we left.” Dustin Burrows, the Republican house
  speaker, did not mention the Republican redistricting proposal, but said the
  chamber would move swiftly to enact its legislative agenda during the second
  special session. Later on Monday evening, a house committee approved the new
  map, which will soon be sent to the floor for a full vote. “Representatives
  come and go. Issues rise and fall. But this body has endured wars, economic
  depressions and quorum breaks dating back to the very first session,” Burrows
  said during Monday’s session. “Now is the time for action.” He also outlined
  new surveillance protocols that would apply to the Democrats who had civil
  arrest warrants issued in their absence, stating they would “be granted
  written permission to leave only after agreeing to be released into the
  custody of a designated [Texas department of public safety] officer” who would
  ensure their return to the chamber. One Democrat is refusing to accept the
  conditions. Nicole Collier, a state representative for Fort Worth, vowed to
  remain confined inside the Texas house chamber until lawmakers reconvene on
  Wednesday, declining to comply with what she condemned as a Republican
  “permission slip” – a document authorizing a round-the-clock law enforcement
  escort. “I refuse to sign away my dignity as a duly elected representative
  just so Republicans can control my movements and monitor me with police
  escorts,” Collier, a seven-term lawmaker and a former chair of the Texas
  Legislative Black caucus, said on Monday. Collier’s demonstration is the
  latest act of Democratic resistance to the Republican redistricting plan.
  “When I press that button to vote, I know these maps will harm my constituents
  – I won’t just go along quietly with their intimidation or their
  discrimination,” she said. The new California map, released on Friday, would
  create three new safely Democratic districts and two new districts that are
  Democratic leaning but still competitive. The plan, led by the California
  governor Gavin Newsom, must be approved by the state legislature before it is
  put to vote in a special election this fall. If voters agree to override the
  house map created by the independent redistricting commission after the 2020
  census, the proposed boundaries would replace current ones through 2030.
  Democrats said they will return the mapmaking power to the commission after
  that. Newsom praised the effort on Monday, calling it a necessary response to
  Trump’s influence over redistricting in Texas and other Republican-led states.
  “We are not going to sit idle while they command Texas and other states to rig
  the next election to keep power,” Newsom said, adding that the proposal gives
  Californians “a choice to fight back”. Internal polling presented to lawmakers
  showed voters favored the measure 52% to 41%, with 7% undecided, according to
  the local television station KCRA. Republicans in California condemned the
  proposal as an assault on the state’s voter-approved independent redistricting
  commission and said they plan to introduce legislation that advocates for
  creating similar map-drawing bodies in all 50 states. “Governor Newsom, this
  is nothing more than a power grab,” Tony Strickland, a Republican state
  senator, said during a Monday news conference in Sacramento. He warned the
  redistricting tit-for-tat sets a dangerous precedent that will not be easily
  undone. “The Golden Gate Bridge toll was supposed to be temporary,” he added.
  “You’re still paying the toll.” The legislature could hold floor votes to send
  the measure to voters for approval as soon as Thursday, KCRA reported. House
  Republicans currently hold a razor-thin three-seat majority in the US House
  and Trump has pushed to redraw district boundaries ahead of next year’s
  midterm elections, in which the president’s party typically loses seats.
  Republicans are also poised to redraw congressional districts in Ohio,
  Missouri and Florida, as well as potentially Indiana. Democrats have signaled
  they will try to redraw districts in other states where they hold power at the
  state level, such as New York and Maryland, though they do not have as many
  opportunities to draw districts as Republicans do.
