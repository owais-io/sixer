  A string of Ukrainian politicians and public figures have condemned the idea
  of handing over unoccupied land to Russia for peace on Sunday, arguing that
  their country had not been defeated and should not be forced into a surrender.
  The hardening of the mood came at the end of a weekend where there was first
  ridicule and disgust in Ukraine at the red-carpet treatment of Vladimir Putin
  by Donald Trump at their summit in Alaska, followed by frustration as it
  appeared that Trump was siding with the Russian leader. Trump reportedly told
  European leaders that he believed a peace deal could be negotiated if
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy agreed to give up the areas of the Donbas region that the
  Russian invaders have not been able to seize in more than three years of
  fighting. Halyna Yanchenko, an independent member of Ukraine’s parliament,
  said the suggestion that Ukraine should “simply surrender new territories
  without a fight – just because Putin wants it – is absurd from the very
  start”. The MP, an anti-corruption activist previously part of Zelenskyy’s
  Servant of the People party, said hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians would be
  affected by Putin’s proposal, initially favoured by Trump after Friday’s
  Alaska summit. Official estimates are that 255,000 people still live in the
  3,500 sq miles (9,000 sq km) of Donetsk province that Russia has been unable
  to seize in its three-and-a-half-year invasion, which includes the industrial
  cities of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk. The Donbas also comprises Luhansk
  province, which is almost totally occupied by Russia. Prior to Russia’s
  full-scale invasion the population of Donetsk was 1.9 million, so the number
  of people with property and other connections to the area wanted by Russia is
  higher. “So when someone brings up the idea of ‘trading territory’, we must
  understand that in practice it is trading people,” Yanchenko said. Serhii
  Kupavykh, who was born and raised in Kramatorsk but now lives in Kharkiv, said
  he believed that allowing Russia to take his city and the rest of Donetsk
  would amount to “a defeat in the war, which will lead to a split in society”,
  though he recognised that gradual Russian advances had made the defence of
  them difficult. He said Zelenskyy had “no right to resolve such issues
  unilaterally” and he believed that “renouncing the territory is political
  suicide for the entire government” – though he acknowledged that Ukraine was
  in a complex position. Cartoons and memes circulated widely online over the
  weekend with a particular focus on the sight of US soldiers kneeling to
  straighten out the red carpet in Alaska for the Russian president.
  “Dishonored,” wrote Serhii Sternenko, a Ukrainian drone fundraiser, on X,
  comparing the image to soldiers raising the US flag at Iwo Jima towards the
  end of the second world war. Maksym Palenko, a cartoonist, drew a picture of a
  glum-looking Trump with his trademark red tie spooling out beneath him and
  turning into a carpet on which a laughing Putin was standing. It reflected
  shots of Putin smiling as he was sitting in Trump’s limousine while it was
  setting off. “We do not deserve to surrender and we are not in a position to
  surrender,” said Oleksiy Goncharenko, an MP with the opposition European
  Solidarity party. “This part of Donetsk is a fortress and Putin has tried and
  failed to take it for 11 years. Now he wants to take it through diplomatic
  tricks and manoeuvres.” Russia’s military has struggled to capture urban
  centres during the war, and the Kramatorsk area is one of the most heavily
  defended in Ukraine. Last week Zelenskyy said it in effect protected the
  centre of the country and there was no guarantee that handing it over would
  not prevent a new war. Goncharenko said Putin’s offer to freeze the conflict
  in the western Kherson and central Zaporizhzhia provinces if Ukraine hands
  over Donetsk was designed to provoke splits in Ukraine and abroad and the
  situation needed to be handled with care. Zelenskyy’s response needed to be
  “well framed, to persuade Trump that Putin has set a trap, because we have
  seen in the past that the relationship between Trump and Zelenskyy can be
  quite explosive,” Goncharenko said. On his previous visit to see Trump at the
  White House, Zelenskyy was ambushed by Trump and his vice-president, JD Vance,
  and got into a bitter public argument with both, leading to a pause in
  intelligence sharing and arms deliveries at a crucial point in the battle.
  Sevgil Musaieva, the editor of Ukrainian Pravda, said in a column published on
  Sunday: “We are being forced to behave as if we have to admit defeat. Not
  military, but political. Not a surrender of arms, but a surrender of thought.”
  She said this was “the most dangerous form of defeat. Because if we accept it
  internally then external defeat will only be a matter of time.” In fact, “for
  the first time in a century, Ukrainians put up a worthy resistance”, she said.
  “We have no right to forget Bucha, Izium, Mariupol. We have no right to forget
  the torture, the mass graves, the children killed and abducted by Russia,” she
  said, arguing that “without memory we will lose ourselves”. Oleksii Kovzhun, a
  popular Kyiv-based video blogger, said Putin’s demands were “akin to
  capitulation” and that “Zelenskyy could not legally hand over Donetsk even if
  he would want to (and he does not)” because it would have to be subject to a
  referendum. “Ukrainians will not allow it,” he said.
