  Calls to reduce the tobacco excise as a way to tackle the illegal tobacco
  industry are a “simplistic, misguided and ineffective solution”, Australia’s
  peak medical body says. The president of the Australian Medical Association,
  Dr Danielle McMullen said there had been a “worrying increase in calls to
  reduce tobacco excise, with the idea, not surprisingly, backed by big
  tobacco.” The scheduled rise in the tobacco excise occurred earlier this week
  after criticism from the NSW premier, Chris Minns, and Victoria’s minister for
  casino, gaming and liquor regulation, who blamed high tobacco prices for a
  spike in violent crime related to the illicit trade - an idea which was
  rejected by federal ministers citing overseas evidence. McMullen said: There’s
  absolutely no evidence to support the idea that reducing excise will impact
  illegal tobacco — in fact the evidence says the opposite, with jurisdictions
  that have reduced the excise seeing a horrible combination of increased
  smoking rates and no tangible impact on the illegal tobacco trade. Crackdown
  on advertising idealising or sexualising cosmetic procedures Advertising
  changes for cosmetic surgery will focus on higher-risk procedures, requiring
  advertisements only use real images and avoid airbrushing or editing that
  misleads the public. The guidelines also specify that the use of photographs,
  videos and images in advertising must not “idealise or sexualise higher risk
  cosmetic procedures through the use of sexualised images, such as poses
  suggestive of sexual positions, parting of legs, hands placed near genitals or
  positions that imply sexual readiness, or gratuitous nudity.” Ahpra says the
  guidelines will also offer greater protection for young people, with those
  under the age of 18 considering non-surgical cosmetic procedures required to
  have a mandatory seven-day cooling off period between their first consultation
  and any procedures, while advertising by practitioners aimed at under 18s will
  also be banned. Ahpra CEO Justin Untersteiner said practitioners have had
  since May to get their houses in order and make sure their practice and
  advertising complies with the new guidelines. “Practitioners have been warned.
  If we find practitioners prioritising profits over patient care, we will not
  hesitate to act.” Australians having cosmetic procedures will have stronger
  protections from today, with new guidelines for health practitioners coming
  into effect. The guidelines, published by the Australian Health Practitioner
  Regulation Agency (Ahpra), target unsafe practices and misleading ads for
  non-surgical cosmetic procedures, such as injections and fillers. Under the
  new rules, further training or education will be necessary for many health
  practitioners wanting to expand the services they provide into these
  procedures. Many will need more than just the foundational qualifications -
  nurses for example, will be required to complete a set period of practice
  before they are allowed to perform these procedures. The nursing and midwifery
  board of Australia chair, adjunct Prof Veronica Casey said the guidelines are
  the robust response needed to safeguard consumers in the growing industry. “A
  lot of people might think of these procedures in the same way they’d consider
  getting a facial or a haircut. But these are clinical procedures and require
  appropriate training and experience to be performed safely.” Good morning and
  welcome to our live news blog. I’m Martin Farrer with the top overnight
  stories and then Krishani Dhanji will take you through another busy day in
  Canberra and beyond. Australians undergoing cosmetic procedures should have
  more protection from rogue operators under new guidelines released today by
  the regulator. The new rules crack down on misleading ads and will require
  better training for practitioners. Elsewhere in health, calls to reduce the
  tobacco excise as a way to tackle the illegal tobacco industry are a
  “simplistic, misguided and ineffective solution”, Australia’s peak medical
  body says. And the Albanese government will face renewed pressure today from
  opposition parties to release immediate in-home aged care funding; while there
  will also be more scrutiny on the government’s Nauru deportation plan – though
  Anthony Albanese has denied there is anything secret about it. We’ll have all
  the developments as they happen today.
