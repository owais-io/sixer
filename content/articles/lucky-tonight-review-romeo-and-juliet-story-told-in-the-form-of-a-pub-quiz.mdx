  There is no shortage of one-person plays about the pressures of growing up in
  a conservative culture. But safe to say, Lucky Tonight! is the only one that
  is 50% pub quiz. On the one hand, it offers Afreena Islam-Wright’s
  coming-of-age tale about her Old Trafford upbringing, as the youngest – and
  most wayward – daughter in a family of Bangladeshi origin. On the other, it
  provides several rounds of general knowledge quizzes and her own version of
  The Chase. The ostensible reason for this happy and eccentric hybrid is
  Islam-Wright’s parallel careers in the arts and as a quiz host. She is a
  practised hand at reassuring clueless contestants, jollying along the
  uncertain players and celebrating the victors. She circulates electronic pads
  on which the questions will be displayed and asks us to form teams. Mine is
  called Critical Mass, natch, and has the good fortune to include someone who
  knows what she is doing. We don’t win, but we hold our own. So far, so Monday
  night down your local. But Islam-Wright’s conceit is not as random as it
  sounds. Between each round, she intersperses a story from her life. That is
  when you realise we have been primed. The quiz questions match the narrative
  theme. When you have just been straining for answers about the Bangladesh her
  family left behind or the attack on the World Trade Center a couple of days
  before she started school, you respond to her true-life tales in a different,
  more attuned frame of mind. Hers is a Romeo and Juliet story common to any
  immigrant community in which traditional values and present-day experience
  come into conflict. In her case, it all works out in the end, but not before
  she celebrates the richness of her heritage, exposes the prevalence of racism
  – and gives out prizes. • At the Traverse, Edinburgh, until 24 August • All
