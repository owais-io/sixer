  Police Scotland have warned the public not to share misinformation about an
  incident in Dundee involving a 12-year-old girl after online speculation was
  amplified by Elon Musk and Tommy Robinson. After the incident, during which a
  Bulgarian couple were approached by young people in St Ann Lane, Dundee, on
  Saturday evening, a 12-year-old girl was charged with being in possession of
  offensive weapons. Alleged footage of the incident was circulated widely on
  social media, including images of a girl holding up bladed weapons and claims
  that she and her friends had been harassed and followed by individuals, who
  were described as migrants with no evidence to back that up. Musk retweeted
  some of these allegations on his social media platform X and posted himself:
  “What kind of government arrests little girls who try to defend themselves?”
  The allegations were also reposted by the far-right activist Tommy Robinson,
  real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennnon, who wrote: “Very concerning video out of
  Dundee, Scotland. Very distressed young girls being filmed by a migrant, the
  children can be heard saying they’re only 12, and to leave them alone.” But
  police in Dundee have since confirmed that after reviewing CCTV footage they
  had found no evidence for the allegations circulating on social media. Ch Supt
  Nicola Russell said: “We are aware of misinformation being shared on social
  media in relation to an incident where a Bulgarian couple were approached by
  youths in St Ann Lane, Dundee, on Saturday. “A 12-year-old girl has been
  charged with being in possession of offensive weapons. She will be referred to
  the relevant authorities and our enquiries are ongoing.” As the girl is under
  16 her case will be heard through Scotland’s children’s hearing system, which
  takes a less formal approach to court. Russell said: “We would like to thank
  the local community for their help with our investigation and would urge the
  public not to share misinformation about this incident or speculate on the
  circumstances.” The girl has been declared a hero on social media, with
  cartoons depicting her as Braveheart and a crowdfunder appeal already
  generating £20,000 in donations. The appeal, which was apparently set up by
  her family, repeats allegations that the 12-year-old’s sister was physically
  attacked during the incident and says the girl “needs our help to stand up to
  the corrupt law establishment that would rather go after victims than hold
  foreign migrants accountable for their crimes”.
