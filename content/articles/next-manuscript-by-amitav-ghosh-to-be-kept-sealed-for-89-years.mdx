webTitle: Next manuscript by Amitav Ghosh to be kept sealed for 89 years

  The next manuscript by Indian writer Amitav Ghosh will not be read for 89
  years, as he becomes the 12th author to contribute to the Future Library
  project. Ghosh joins Margaret Atwood, Han Kang, Ocean Vuong and other
  prominent authors who have written secret manuscripts, which are locked away
  until 2114. The texts are stored in a specifically designed silent room in the
  Deichman Bjørvika building at the public library in Oslo. At the end of the
  project, the full anthology of texts will be printed using paper made from
  trees from the Future Library forest in Nordmarka, in northern Oslo, where
  1,000 spruce trees were planted by Katie Paterson, the artist behind the
  project, in 2014. Ghosh, whose novels include The Circle of Reason and Sea of
  Poppies, said being invited to participate in the Future Library project was a
  “profound honour and a humbling act of trust”. The initiative “compels us to
  think beyond our lifetimes, to imagine readers who have not yet been born”.
  “It is particularly significant for me that the project has a forest at its
  core,” he added, “because for a long time now, I have been writing about a
  forest, albeit of an entirely different kind – the great mangrove forest known
  as the Sundarban.” Stretching across the Ganges delta, the Sundarbans are the
  backdrop to Ghosh’s novels The Hungry Tide, Jungle Nama and Gun Island. “It
  will be an exciting challenge to make a connection between the forests of the
  far north and those of the tropics, at this time of extreme planetary crisis,”
  added Ghosh, whose works often address climate disaster. “I am moved to be
  part of a work that intertwines ecology, literature and patience on such a
  monumental scale.” Ghosh grew up in India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, and has a
  doctorate in social anthropology from the University of Oxford. He has written
  a number of novels, as well as works of nonfiction and essay collections.
  Ghosh’s writing “is expansive, urgent, and deeply attuned to the shifting
  ground of our world”, said Paterson. “His stories traverse oceans and
  centuries, revealing how the climate crisis is inseparable from histories of
  empire, migration and myth.” “With a rare ability to weave the intimate with
  the planetary, the visible with the invisible, Ghosh gives voice to the forces
  – human and more-than-human – that shape our shared future,” she added. Ghosh
  will submit his manuscript at a ceremony in the Future Library forest in May
  or June 2026, when the work’s title will be revealed. Along with Atwood, Han
  and Vuong, other writers to have contributed to the project include David
  Mitchell, Sjón, Elif Shafak, Karl Ove Knausgård, Tsitsi Dangarembga, Judith
  Schalansky, Valeria Luiselli and, most recently, Tommy Orange. In June 2022,
  the City of Oslo signed an agreement which ensures the forest remains in the
  hands of the Future Library Trust for the duration of the project.
