  I’m on a steadily rising road in northern Greece as swallows sweep over the
  burnished grasses to either side of me and pelicans spiral through the summer
  sky. Gaining height, the land thickens with oak forests and a Hermann’s
  tortoise makes a slow, ceremonial turn on to a sheep track at the edge of the
  asphalt. And then, just as the road briefly levels out before corkscrewing
  down the other side, a glittering lake appears beneath me – a brilliant blue
  eye set in a socket of steep mountains. I can’t even begin to count how many
  times I’ve crossed the pass into the Prespa basin on my way home from trips
  into town, but the sight of shimmering Lesser Prespa Lake – often striking
  blue in the afternoons and silvery at sunset – takes me back to the summer of
  2000 when I saw it for the first time. A little over 25 years ago, my wife and
  I read a glowing review of a book about the Prespa lakes region. In the
  north-west corner of Greece and an hour’s drive from the towns of Florina and
  Kastoria, the two Prespa lakes straddle the borders of Greece, Albania and
  North Macedonia in a basin of about 618 sq miles. We’d never heard of Prespa
  until then, but the review of Giorgos Catsadorakis’s Prespa: A Story for Man
  and Nature got us thinking about a holiday there, imagining a week or two of
  walking in the mountains, birding around the summer shores and enjoying food
  in village tavernas at night. When the book finally arrived at our London
  flat, at a time when we were talking seriously about living somewhere else, it
  took just a single evening (and, to be fair, a couple of bottles of wine) to
  decide to leave the city behind. Not for a holiday, but to try to make a home
  for ourselves in the Prespa national park. Twenty-five years later, we’re
  still in the village we moved to – Agios Germanos. I park the car near the
  pass and walk further into the hills on a path worn smooth by shepherds and
  their animals. It’s high summer and there’s a languor to the landscape. Clouds
  of butterflies drift on the hot air and a hoopoe raises its magnificent crest
  in an oak. From up here I can now see Great Prespa Lake as well, separated
  from its smaller neighbour by a wide and sandy isthmus. These two ancient
  lakes, thought to be in the region of 3-5 million years old, are almost
  entirely encircled by a bowl of mountains, making it feel a world apart when
  you cross into the basin. Although the water levels in the lakes have dropped
  significantly because of climate change in recent decades, Prespa remains a
  place of extraordinary vitality. Looking north over the rolling oak forests, I
  can see the rough point in the lake where Greece, Albania and North Macedonia
  meet. Prespa is a crossroads not only of countries but of geologies too,
  resulting in an extraordinary profusion and abundance of wild species – almost
  three times as many butterfly species (172) can be found on the Greek side of
  Prespa than in the whole of the UK (59). I look up as a mixed group of
  Dalmatian and great white pelicans lowers towards Lesser Prespa Lake. Seeing
  these birds in flight, carried across the mountains on wings that can have a
  total span of more than three metres, it feels as if you have been given a
  glimpse into the age of the dinosaurs. Until we read the book that brought us
  here, I had no idea that pelicans could even be found in Greece, let alone
  nest on these lakes in large numbers, but then Prespa is full of surprises. In
  some winters, Lesser Prespa Lake can freeze solid enough to walk across – and
  there are far more brown bears in the region than bouzoukis. While Prespa is a
  popular winter destination for Greek visitors, in part because of a ski-centre
  halfway between Florina and the basin, it’s the quieter spring and summer
  seasons when the place comes into its own for walking and nature tourism.
  There’s a mosaic of cultural riches to explore here too: the remarkable ruins
  of the 1,000-year-old Byzantine basilica on the island of Agios Achilleios;
  the lakeside cliffs on Great Prespa Lake, studded with centuries-old
  hermitages and monastic cells, reached by hiring a boatman from the fishing
  village of Psarades; the churches screened by sacred groves of immense juniper
  trees, found on some of the many marked walking trails. Besides the abundant
  nature and mountain walking that prompted us to move here, what also makes
  this place so special is the food and hospitality. There are welcoming,
  family-run guesthouses in many of the villages and excellent tavernas serving
  regional specialities, including slow-baked beans in a rich tomato sauce with
  oregano, fresh carp and sardine-sized tsironia from the lake, grilled
  florinela cheese brushed with red pepper marmalade, and wild greens called
  horta doused in lemon juice and olive oil. I stop to watch the cross-hatchings
  of light on the lakes as the hum of insects deepens with the heat. A
  short-toed eagle turns into the wind ahead of me, briefly motionless as it
  hunts for snakes in the forest clearings. Then it steers northwards and away
  across the mountains. Beyond those peaks encircling Prespa are the beautiful,
  traditional market towns of Korҫë in Albania and Bitola in North Macedonia,
  which, together with Florina and lakeside Kastoria just outside the basin in
  Greece, help make the entire region one of endless fascination for me. There
  are plans to re-open the long-closed crossing between Greece and North
  Macedonia within the Prespa basin in the next few years, an opportunity to
  build further bridges between communities and make movement for tourists
  easier. Another project will establish a cross-border walking route between
  our village and the neighbouring mountain village of Brajčino in North
  Macedonia; it will celebrate the cultural and natural heritage of the common
  watershed while highlighting the importance of low-impact tourism to local
  economies, particularly at a time when climate change is making itself felt
  around the lakes and threatening agricultural livelihoods. It’s almost time to
  return along the path and head home, but first I sit in the shade of an oak,
  its leaves rustling in the warm breeze. A steel-blue dragonfly unzips the air
  and I can hear sheep bells somewhere in the hills. The sound shifts and
  swirls, just as on the saint’s day festivals of summer, called panigyria, when
  the wild, soaring music of clarinets and raucous Balkan brass rises into the
  mountain nights as people gather with food and drink to circle-dance in
  village squares. I’ve never thought of Prespa as anything but a shared place,
  where human cultures and wild species come together and co-exist, a place best
  experienced slowly and with care. And although Prespa has been my home for a
  quarter of a century now, when I see that blue water glimmering beneath me as
  I cross the pass, it still so often feels like the first time. For more
