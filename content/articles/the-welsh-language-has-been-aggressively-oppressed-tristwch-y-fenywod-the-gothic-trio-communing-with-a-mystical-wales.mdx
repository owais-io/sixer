  ‘It’s often dealing with quite elemental things,” says the vocalist Gwretsien
  Ferch Lisbeth of Tristwch y Fenywod’s music. “The sense of being in an ancient
  landscape; or the enchanted, sapphic feeling of being by the ocean. Our music
  addresses things that are simple and foundational, but very powerful.”
  Released last August – and now being performed live by the band across the
  summer festival circuit – the trio’s self-titled debut album is a lush,
  cathartic mix of gothic instrumentation and eldritch melody, like a lost
  Cocteau Twins masterpiece recorded in a cave in Eryri, stirring intense
  feelings even in those who can’t understand its Welsh lyrics. There’s a
  political dimension too. “The oppression of the Welsh language over the past
  200 years was so aggressive,” says the drummer Leila Lygad, citing how Welsh
  children were forced to speak English in 19th- and 20th-century schools. “It
  feels important to champion languages that have been oppressed by colonial
  systems.” Formed in Leeds by members of the underground groups Guttersnipe,
  Hawthonn and the Courtneys, and using Welsh pseudonyms for the project,
  Tristwch y Fenywod tap into a particularly Welsh mysticism. Ferch Lisbeth was
  born in Bangor, and lived in North Wales until the age of 12. “I always found
  it to be a very mystical place,” she says. “The language was definitely part
  of that, although we were in the minority of not being a Welsh-speaking
  family.” Before living in Leeds, Lygad grew up on the nearby
  Staffordshire-Shropshire border, and spent her childhood “walking on
  Penmaenmawr mountain” – on the North Wales coast – “and visiting the first
  stone circle I’d ever been to”, which sparked “a lifetime interest in
  archaeology, history and Welsh culture”. Ferch Lisbeth’s family moved her to
  England aged 12, but the landscape and language of Wales stayed in her
  subconscious. In 2020, after discovering a friend on the Leeds experimental
  music scene was a fluent speaker, she dedicated herself to learning Welsh
  “obsessively, every minute of every day”. She’d also started to date the
  band’s third member, the Canadian bassist Sidni Sarffwraig, and the pair
  visited North Wales together. “Having this beautiful sapphic connection in
  those places felt profound,” says Ferch Lisbeth. “It was some logical arrival
  of fate for me; different threads of the psyche converging.” When Tristwch y
  Fenywod formed in 2022, Ferch Lisbeth was driven to sing in Welsh about
  queerness, mysticism and belonging, because “maybe no one’s ever written a
  song in Welsh from this perspective, and it’s about time it existed.” Their
  band name translates to “the sadness of women”, and they are inspired by the
  “stately, elegant, feminine sadness” of groups such as Dead Can Dance. They
  also embrace the experimental amateurism of the 1970s no wave scene. Lygad
  plays electronic drums, programmed with unconventional sounds from field
  recordings. Her snare is a recording of a snapping toy from a joke shop she
  exploded in an underground bunker, while her toms are the clicks made by
  echolocating bats, a particularly goth detail of her set-up. Sarffwraig plays
  a standard bass guitar, but Ferch Lisbeth plays a self-made instrument she
  calls a dwydelyn – Welsh for “two-harp” – constructed from two zithers and a
  contact mic: “I was thinking about Celtic harp music, and the first Dead Can
  Dance record where Lisa Gerrard is playing the yangqin [a Chinese dulcimer].”
  The three of them talk admiringly about the adventurous atmosphere they’ve
  cultivated within the band, and that’s echoed in the Leeds scene that nurtured
  them. At the centre is Wharf Chambers, an accessible, co-op-run venue where,
  according to Ferch Lisbeth, “honesty is rewarded and genuineness of expression
  is the goal”. This is especially crucial for a band who are all
  neurodivergent. “For neurodivergent people, experimental music is a space to
  unmask and be publicly witnessed experiencing intense emotions,” says
  Sarffwraig. “The scene around Wharf Chambers gave us space to do something
  weird in a language people don’t understand. DIY venues have to be protected
  because they’re so important for experimentation.” The band have found a
  similarly supportive second home in North Wales, in a community of alternative
  Welsh and Welsh-language musicians such as Anxiolytics, Sister Wives and Cerys
  Hafana that has “a very wholesome, casual inclusion of queer, trans and
  neurodivergent people”, according to Ferch Lisbeth. Established Welsh
  musicians have shown support, including Datblygu and the Super Furry Animals
  producer Gorwel Owen, members of Fflaps, and the singer Gwenno, who has
  recorded albums in Welsh and Cornish. “Gwenno is a very important figure,”
  says Lygad. “She’s championing minority languages and is an outspoken
  anti-capitalist and anti-colonialist.” Outside of Wales, Tristwch y Fenywod
  have a kinship with groups such as Kneecap and Lankum, who share their
  anti-colonial approach to language and folk tradition. “It’s been lovely
  seeing Kneecap have success with the Irish language and take it to the
  mainstream, because that’s where it should be,” says Lygad. The band hope
  their music inspires people to learn Welsh, or other minority languages, for
  pleasure and resistance. “People talk about wanting large-scale systemic
  change, but they’re still using the [English] language of laws and power
  structures,” says Ferch Lisbeth, who sees every language as “a different
  system of perception”. They also model a radical connection with history and
  heritage. “There’s a way of respecting the past and tradition without the
  politics of nationalist ideas,” says Sarffwraig. “Welsh is ancient, and allows
  you to connect with the way people were living a really long time ago. It’s
  unfair that people with conservative politics get to have a monopoly on that
  culture and history. We’re resisting that.” • Tristwch y Fenywod play Green
