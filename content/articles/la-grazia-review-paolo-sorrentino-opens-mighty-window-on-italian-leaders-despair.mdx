  despair

  Paolo Sorrentino has rediscovered his voice, his wan humour and his flair for
  the surreal and sensational set piece; this wintry, elegant movie is a welcome
  reassertion of his natural style after the facile and weirdly humourless
  affectations of his previous, very disappointing film Parthenope. It is a dry
  comedy of grief and regret which wears its dreamy melancholy and ennui like a
  well-tailored if fussily old-fashioned suit, and it returns Sorrentino to the
  various mysterious tableaux of political power that recurred in Il Divo from
  2009, about political mandarin Giulio Andreotti, and his 2013 film The Great
  Beauty about a dissolute journalist and hedonist bidding a bittersweet
  farewell to everything he holds dear. And above everything else, Grazia
  returns Sorrentino to the star of those films, 66-year-old Toni Servillo, his
  male muse and alter ego, an actor able to suggest fathomless depths of sadness
  or lenient humour with a single smile. (Oddly, that last film Parthenope
  assigned the Servillo-esque role of the knowing outsider to Gary Oldman, who
  had to play a bafflingly supercilious version of the author John Cheever.)
  Maybe this film, concluding as it does on a distinctive note of euphoric
  sentimentality, does not add up to quite as much as the director thinks; but
  it intrigues, it exhilarates and it shows that Sorrentino is Italian cinema’s
  heir to Antonioni. The scene is Rome, and Servillo is Mariano, the president
  of Italy, nearing the end of his term of office, admired for his rectitude and
  stately bearing and perhaps also, in having won the presidency, for having
  thwarted an extremist candidate. (A rather amazing set piece scene at La Scala
  has a tuxed member of the audience call out to him “You saved us from that
  fool!”) He is a widower and distinguished former judge renowned for an
  impossibly large and dry book on the minutiae of legislation; he is also a
  stickler for the letter of constitutional law, with the nickname “reinforced
  concrete”. Mariano is assisted by his lawyer daughter Dorotea (Anna Ferzetti),
  who is exasperated by his reluctance to make decisions; he must decide on
  whether to sign off a bill making euthanasia legal, and also whether to give
  pardons to a woman who killed her abusive husband in his sleep and a man who
  killed his dementia patient wife. Eccentrically, his only pleasure is
  listening to rap music on his earphones, and Sorrentino, as so often in the
  past, supplies plenty of distinctive electro-pop on the soundtrack, buzzing
  and clanging like an MRI scanner. And it seems his only friend is his personal
  protection officer Labaro (Orlando Cinque), who gives him forbidden
  cigarettes. The awful truth is that the end of his term of office has given
  him an inkling of the end of his life, but this has not brought Mariano any
  peace. In fact, he is in agony, haunted by the thought of his late wife being
  unfaithful to him 40 years before. And with whom? Mariano suspects his
  contemporary Ugo (Massimo Venturiello), who has slippery ambitions of his own.
  The only person who knows for sure is his wife’s best friend and Mariano’s old
  classmate Coco Valori (Milvia Marigliano), a dyspeptic and opinionated critic;
  she is a very Sorrentino-esque character, a type in fact played by Servillo in
  The Great Beauty. She refuses to betray the confidence. As he prepares to lay
  his robe of office down, Mariano suspects he will never know, and a lifetime’s
  devotion to the establishment of facts will only mock his ignorance of the
  only fact that matters to him. But … does it matter? What does matter, given
  that our destiny is dust? La Grazia is a stylish, soigné film, ruminative and
  enigmatic. Like The Great Beauty it broods on the Romanità of the capital; the
  Romanness, the way in which its history is inscribed on its buildings for
  those who understand it. And the set piece moments are tremendous: Mariano is
  guest of honour at a veterans’ dinner for Italy’s mountain infantry, the
  Alpini, and suddenly bursts into song with them. Perhaps most knowingly, there
  is a scene where he hosts an official reception for the Portuguese president
  and simply looks on motionless as the visitor attempts to process toward him
  across a courtyard in the driving rain, along a red carpet which is being
  swept away by the wind: a dream image of the vulnerability and absurdity of
  official pomp. Arguably, none of this would count for as much, or anything,
  without Servillo: but it’s a satisfying meditation on the pleasures and
  sadnesses of solitude in old age. • La Grazia screened at the Venice film
  festival.
