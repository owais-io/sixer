  On Wednesday, the Western Australian supreme court ruled Brittany Higgins had
  defamed her ex-boss, Linda Reynolds, when she accused the former Liberal
  senator of mishandling her rape allegation. The state supreme court judge Paul
  Tottle ruled the former defence minister’s reputation was damaged by a 2022
  social media post from Higgins’ partner David Sharaz, which Higgins responded
  to, and an Instagram story published by Higgins in July 2023. The judgment
  marks the end of a long legal battle stemming from Higgins’ decision to go
  public with allegations she was raped in a ministerial suite in Parliament
  House by a former colleague, Bruce Lehrmann. Wednesday’s 360-page ruling
  followed five weeks of evidence, which covered a five-year period from the
  alleged rape in 2019 to the trial’s start in August 2024. Sign up: AU Breaking

  ruled against Lehrmann in his defamation case against Network Ten and Lisa
  Wilkinson for airing Higgins’ sexual assault allegations against him. Lehrmann
  denied the rape allegations and pleaded not guilty at his criminal trial in
  the Australian Capital Territory supreme court, which was aborted. Prosecutors
  did not seek a retrial due to concerns about Higgins’ mental health. Justice
  Michael Lee found that Lehrmann had raped Higgins, on the balance of
  probabilities, on the minister’s couch in Parliament House in March 2019.
  Lehrmann is appealing against the verdict. Here are five things we learned
  from the court’s ruling. Reynolds was ‘honest’ but ‘impressionistic’ Reynolds
  was in the witness box for five days to deliver her account of the events. In
  determining her reliability as a witness, Tottle said the former senator’s
  role as a politician meant she produced “long answers in which she focused on
  the point she wished to put across rather than answering the question, either
  directly or in some instances at all”. “This approach was frustrating because
  it necessitated the same question being asked several times,” Tottle said. “It
  was also counterproductive so far as the plaintiff was concerned because it
  created the impression she was being unnecessarily defensive and, at times,
  evasive.” He added that her recollections of events were at times
  “impressionistic” and influenced by a “desire to defend her conduct”.
  Ultimately, Tottle said he found Reynolds to be an “honest” witness
  “determined to ensure her account of events was heard”. Higgins’ trauma taken
  into account but judge set ‘feelings of sympathy’ aside Tottle acknowledged
  Higgins was the “victim of one of the most serious crimes known to the law”
  and that her trauma could have a “disruptive effect” on her memory. He also
  noted she likely “projected an impression of confidence and resilience in 2019
  and 2020 which masked the emotional and psychological distress she was
  suffering”. Higgins did not appear as a witness in the trial so Tottle said he
  had to rely on evidence and statements tendered in other areas. While Tottle
  said he took a “generous approach” to his assessment of Higgins’ reliability
  as a witness, he said her evidence had to be looked at “entirely
  dispassionately”. “While the defendant’s evidence must be evaluated in the
  context of the trauma she has suffered, her evidence must be evaluated
  entirely dispassionately,” Tottle wrote in his ruling. “Feelings of sympathy
  for the victim of a very serious crime must be set aside.” Tottle wrote that
  Higgins’ account of events “was distorted by her need for events to conform to
  her view about how she was treated by the Liberal party and, specifically how
  she was treated by the plaintiff and Ms Brown”. “The existence of a cover-up
  was a vital part of the defendant’s story. I have concluded the defendant was
  dishonest in aspects of the account given by her of the alleged cover up.”
  Reynolds’ texts with former Lehrmann lawyer ‘inconsequential’ Texts were
  tendered in court between Reynolds and Lehrmann’s then barrister, Steven
  Whybrow SC, in the lead-up to Lehrmann’s 2022 criminal trial in the ACT. The
  text messages showed Reynolds offered Whybrow the names of staffers he should
  speak to while he was preparing for the criminal trial. One message to Whybrow
  from Reynolds suggested speaking to a former staffer, who could “shed light on
  Brittany’s activities in Perth and also how she came to be with Bruce on that
  night”. Higgins’ lawyer, Rachael Young SC, alleged the 21 text messages sent
  between the two showed Reynolds had not acted impartially toward both parties
  involved in Lehrmann’s criminal trial. During the defamation trial, Reynolds
  was asked about why she suggested to Whybrow that Higgins was trying to
  imitate Kate Middleton in her clothing choices. Reynolds said Higgins had a
  “predilection for expensive clothes”, including a jacket the former senator
  alleged Higgins had stole. Reynolds acknowledged it was “a little bit catty”.
  Tottle ruled these text messages were ultimately “inconsequential” as evidence
  of Reynolds’ impartiality. “As was implicitly recognised by the plaintiff,
  sending these photographs did not reflect well on her,” Tottle wrote. “The
  epithet ‘catty’ was apt. That said, a sense of proportion is required, her
  conduct was a manifestation of human frailty at a time of great stress. It was
  inconsequential” Judge ‘confident’ Reynolds had no knowledge of alleged rape
  on couch in meeting with Higgins The court heard handwritten notes from AFP
  assistant commissioner, Leanne Close, written on 4 April 2019 suggested
  Reynolds may have been aware of Higgins’ alleged rape on 1 April 2019, when
  Reynolds had a meeting with Higgins in the room it allegedly took place. Close
  noted Reynolds brought her then chief of staff, Fiona Brown, into the office
  to begin the meeting. She noted the minister said: “It’s about Brittany – we
  became aware on Tuesday that this had happened on Saturday night – on my couch
  there.” Close said Reynolds pointed toward the couch in her office where the
  rape allegedly occurred. Tottle said the inconsistencies could have occurred
  as Close’s notes were written after the meeting with Reynolds and Brown. He
  added he had “reservations about the accuracy of the notes” given they were
  recorded direct quotes. “They are reservations borne out of general experience
  of the frailty of the powers of human recollection,” he said. Tottle
  concluded: “Further, and for the reasons I have already given, had Ms Brown
  and [Reynolds] known (or indeed suspected) [Higgins] had been the victim of a
  sexual assault in the private office, I am confident they would not have held
  the meeting with her on 1 April 2019 in that office,” he wrote. Reynolds’
  decision to leak confidential letter ‘not unreasonable’ The court heard
  Reynolds leaked confidential letters outlining the proposed terms of Higgins’
  personal injury settlement to Janet Albrechtsen, a columnist at the
  Australian. Reynolds told the court she sent the confidential documents to
  Albrechtsen because she was “incredibly angry”, believed the attorney general,
  Mark Dreyfus, was “stitching” her up, and wanted the public to know. Reynolds
  denied all accusations by Young that her intention, or even the effect of
  actions, was to undermine Higgins’ rape allegation. Tottle found Reynolds’
  reasons for challenging Higgins’ claims during the settlement were “soundly
  based” and it was “not unreasonable” for her to question her exclusion from
  the settlement meeting in a public arena. “The propositions may be contestable
  but it cannot be said the plaintiff was not justified in raising them,” he
  wrote. “The defendant’s claim relied heavily on her allegations against Ms
  Brown and the plaintiff and many of those allegations were challenged by the
  plaintiff.”
