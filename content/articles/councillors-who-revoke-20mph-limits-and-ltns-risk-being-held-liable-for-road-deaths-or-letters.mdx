  Re Sadiq Khan’s article (Dear Britain, it’s now clear: 20mph zones save lives
  and don’t slow traffic. Implement them, 12 August), many people are unaware of
  the outstanding success of 20mph limits and low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs)
  in saving lives and preventing injuries and crashes, because the research and
  statistics are only being reported consistently by the BBC and the Guardian.
  People who rely on some of the other media outlets will have seen these
  policies characterised as unpopular, “hated” or a “war on drivers”. The
  failure to report impartially is a distortion of the truth that is misleading
  the public and politicians, and leading to pressure to revoke these
  life-saving measures. Highway authorities have a statutory duty to promote
  road safety, a duty to have “due regard” to the needs of elderly and disabled
  people, and a common law duty of care to all road users not to be negligent.
  On top of this, councils have duties relating to public health, and policies
  relating to active lifestyles and the prevention of obesity, all of which are
  supported by creating safer streets. Councillors are obliged to ensure their
  decisions are reasonable and based on relevant considerations. While
  councillors and officers are protected by statutory immunity, this protection
  does not extend to deliberate or reckless wrongdoing. The science and evidence
  are totally clear: revocation of 20mph limits or LTNs will lead to crashes,
  injuries and deaths. Councillors and their advisers who pursue such actions
  risk being held personally liable for the harm that ensues. Robert Huxford
  Director, Urban Design Group • Sadiq Khan describes the safety benefits of
  20mph limits in urban areas. Hopefully, the increased carbon emissions from
  the petrol and diesel cars being driven at inefficient speeds will be balanced
  out by the smoother overall traffic flow and the much greater efficiency of
  electric vehicles at low speeds. There are even greater benefits to be had
  from a lower national speed limit of 55mph as road transport decarbonises, but
  that does not have a champion since the idea was recommended and then
  inexplicably dropped by the Climate Change Committee. Daniel Scharf Abingdon,
  Oxfordshire • I congratulate Sadiq Khan on the excellent progress he has made.
  I would ask, though, whether more speed cameras can be installed. There is a
  road from Putney to Wimbledon which is 20mph along its whole length, with just
  one speed camera. Once past this camera, cars speed up and overtake drivers
  who are maintaining the speed limit. Sadiq should ask councils to install more
  cameras with the carrot of letting them keep the ensuing fines. Shirley
  Pritchard Wimbledon, London • As a reluctant pedestrian, following a stroke, I
  have to walk miles along urban roads, using a robust walking stick. It’s
  essential – not for balance but to vent my anger at threatening drivers who
  speed past and often instinctively veer towards the pavement away from
  oncoming traffic. Andrew Morgan Poole, Dorset • Have an opinion on anything
