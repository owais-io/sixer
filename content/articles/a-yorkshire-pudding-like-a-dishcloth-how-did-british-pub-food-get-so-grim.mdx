  It was supposed to be a special occasion: an extended family get-together for
  Sunday lunch at a country pub. The setting was promising: a traditional
  establishment recently redecorated; outside terrace by the river; plenty of
  customers. The menu was also promising: a giant sheet of paper like a medieval
  charter, with glowing descriptions of how they aged their beef and sourced
  their produce locally. The food, though, was awful. The starters were assorted
  deep-fried pellets of unidentifiable organic matter; the meat was cold and
  colourless, the gravy watery, the roast potatoes soggy and the yorkshire
  pudding chewy as a dishcloth. It was very difficult to believe all of this had
  been freshly prepared in the kitchen that day. It felt more like reheated
  leftovers – for £30 a head. You may, like me, have had this experience – and
  the lower-budget equivalent, the pub menu that consists of 700 variations of
  pie or burger, all of which arrive at the table via the freezer and the
  microwave, molten hot and almost glowing. With chips. How did pub food get so
  grim? We like to think the bad old days of British cuisine, the days when it
  was a national embarrassment, are far behind us, that the 1990s and 2000s
  ushered in a wave of quality gastropubs and that the shires are bursting with
  talented chefs cooking local produce from scratch. In some cases, that is
  true, but more broadly – in my view, at least – pub food in the UK is on the
  decline. “You’re definitely not alone,” says Katie Mather, a drinks writer and
  pub culture blogger. “There is evidence to support your hypothesis.” Ray
  Bailey, one half of the bloggers Boak &amp; Bailey and a co-author of 20th
  Century Pub, also agrees. “Pub food has quietly been on the decline for a few
  years now, both in terms of quality and availability. There was a golden
  period during which you could rely on being able to get a solid meal for a
  reasonable price, but now many pubs have closed their kitchens or outsourced
  food to fast food popups.” Pubs have never had it so hard, you could argue.
  They face significant and often inexorably increasing costs: rent; staffing
  (partly as a result of the recent national insurance contribution increases);
  energy (to heat and chill food and people); alcohol (duty on a bottle of 14.5%
  red wine has risen by nearly £1 in the past two years); and food (one chef
  tells me beef has gone up 50% in the past eight months). This comes on top of
  Covid recovery and the cost of living crisis. According to the British Beer
  and Pub Association, 15,000 pubs have closed in the past 25 years. There are
  still roughly 45,000 left, but the UK is losing about six pubs a week. “Pub
  food used to be the moneymaker, but with the rising price of literally
  everything, it really isn’t as cheap to do that any more,” says Mather. “For a
  long time, business owners have been able to hide the effects from customers
  to a certain degree; they’ve been able to cut corners in kind of invisible
  ways. But it’s become so difficult to deal with.” Pubs have had it hard for a
  long time, says Brian Hannon, a co-founder of the London-based restaurant
  group Super 8, which includes Brat, Kiln and Smoking Goat. Previously, he
  worked for 18 years in the pub sector. The shake-up began with the beer orders
  in 1989. In an attempt to improve competition, the government limited the
  number of tied pubs a brewery could own to 2,000. At the time, 75% of UK pubs
  were controlled by six breweries (Bass, for example, had to sell nearly 5,000
  of its 7,000 pubs) and 95% of their revenue came from drinks. This change
  created conditions for new pub chains and independents to flourish. By the
  time the beer orders were revoked, in 2003, the industry had been transformed.
  Habits were changing, too. By the 2000s, we had what Hannon calls the three
  Fs: “Food, females and fenestration.” Pubs opened up literally and socially,
  while food revenues made up for declining drinks sales. It was the era of new
  chains, such as All Bar One, and the original gastropubs, such as the Eagle in
  Clerkenwell, London. Pub food became a route to culinary acclaim and
  celebrity. In 2001, the Stagg Inn in Herefordshire became the first pub to
  receive a Michelin star. The Hand and Flowers, Tom Kerridge’s pub in Marlow,
  Buckinghamshire, has two stars. This era didn’t last long, though. “I refuse
  to use the word gastropub, because I don’t think it means anything any more,”
  says Oisín Rogers, a co-founder of the Devonshire, one of London’s hottest
  pubs. “Gastropubs in the 90s and the 2000s were always chef or mom-and-pop
  operations where you’d have a single freeholder or leaseholder who was in the
  kitchen all the time, cooking from scratch, making really delicious things in
  a place they were really proud of. And that was copied by the [pub chains].
  They’d say: ‘Look, this is a gastropub. It’s the same colour and the menu
  looks a bit similar,’ but actually you’re getting a far inferior product.” The
  Good Food Guide stopped using the term “gastropub” in 2011. These days, you
  are more likely to see the word in supermarkets: Marks &amp; Spencer has a
  “Gastropub” range of ready meals created by Kerridge. Hannon breaks down
  today’s pub food landscape into three brackets. At one end are those putting a
  premium on quality food and targeting customers willing to pay for it. At the
  other end are the big chain pubs, operating on the basis of low cost and high
  margins. “The lower the price, the more likely it’s been bought in and not
  been cooked by a chef,” Hannon says. However, he adds: “The chains will apply
  their skill set and their muscle to actually get not-bad food produced well.”
  In the perilous middle ground, smaller chains and independent pubs try to
  present a gastropub-looking menu for minimum outlay and maximum profit, which,
  in this climate, necessitates compromises – and may well explain my
  unsatisfactory Sunday roast. (On closer inspection, the pub in question turned
  out to be part of a group, offering very similar menus across several sites,
  which suggests some degree of centralisation.) “What often happens is the guy
  who’s running the pub has a spreadsheet that’s been sent down saying: ‘This is
  where you get your beef, this is where you get your yorkshire pudding, here’s
  the instructions on how to do it,’” says Rogers. “And they’ve followed the
  instructions, maybe not completely correctly, and ended up with an inferior
  product on the plate.” Hannon says: “The people in the middle are making no
  money out of producing food because, number one, the cost of employing a chef
  is really high and, number two, it’s hard to actually get the staff,
  especially given that pubs are often out in the countryside. And then the
  economics of running those have been really challenged. So what they’re now
  doing is de-skilling their food.” A pub menu will never say: “We don’t
  actually make this food ourselves.” But more and more pubs are quietly
  outsourcing some or all of their cooking. “We’ve heard stories of pub kitchens
  serving microwavable supermarket ready meals because they’re cheap, last for
  ever in the freezer and have incredibly high mark-up,” says Bailey. Even big
  names have been caught out. In 2009, Gordon Ramsay was found to have been
  serving food prepared at a central kitchen in three of his London gastropubs,
  presenting it as “freshly made”, at considerably inflated prices. One
  indicator of this trend is the growth of external catering firms. Visit the
  website of Brakes, the market leader, and you will find more than 9,000
  products: everything from fresh, raw ingredients to frozen pub grub – 20
  formed cod fillets in batter for £1.69 each, yorkshire puddings for 35p each.
  They do 66 kinds of chip, says Paul Hulyer, Brakes’ head of hospitality
  customer marketing. He doesn’t provide exact figures on how their pub business
  is doing, but he says: “We’ve sustained very good, healthy volumes in the
  sector.” Having worked for pub chains himself, Hulyer knows how the pressures
  have grown. “One of the things I’ve noticed is more pubs want to try to do
  some cooking,” he says. “When I worked in kitchens, everything was cooked from
  scratch, you had 12 people in the kitchen, whereas now, with all the
  increasing costs, you’ve got to do similar with four or five people. How do
  you do that? Well, you take some of the prep out. That’s what we help to do.”
  For example, Brakes sells a whole beef brisket, Hulyer explains. “We’ve done
  the seven-, eight-hour cook so you’ve not had to. And [the pub kitchen] would
  take it, defrost it and portion it. And then they would say: ‘Right, I’m going
  to flavour this with …’ and they would personalise it.” If they don’t want to
  do even that, Brakes also offers a range of sauces. Brakes is scrupulous about
  food standards and responsible sourcing, of course, but it has little control
  over what goes on in the kitchens it supplies (assuming anything is going on
  beyond setting a timer on a microwave) or how their products appear on menus.
  The language can often be wilfully obscure, with terms such as “homemade” and
  “freshly prepared” covering a multitude of sins, says Rogers. “Some of the big
  chains will say they do aged beef, for example, which doesn’t mean dry aged;
  it just means it’s been kept in a vacuum bag.” There are also dodgy supply
  chains, he says, such as what has been called “long-range chicken”, “where you
  buy chicken that was bred in Vietnam, packed in Singapore, injected with
  fillers in the Netherlands and then arrived frozen to a cash-and-carry in the
  UK”. Everyone seems to have horror stories. “When I worked as a waiter in a
  chain pub in the 1990s, the ‘homemade’ steak and kidney pie was assembled from
  a sachet of brown goop emptied into a dish with an oval of pre-made pastry
  popped on top,” says Bailey. The quality end of the pub food spectrum comes
  with its own challenges. While pub chains may operate on a profit margin of
  70%, serving fresh, quality food is far less profitable, which inevitably
  means higher prices for customers. Mains at the Devonshire’s upstairs
  restaurant are £20 to £40, not counting side dishes, although they do cheaper
  bar snacks downstairs. Sunday lunch at the Hand and Flowers will set you back
  £175. When that is the case, Mather asks, can we still call these places pubs?
  “I would argue that they focus so much on food that now they are just
  restaurants.” She defines a pub as “a place that I would feel comfortable
  drinking in without having a meal”. Those places do exist, she says, citing
  her local in Lancashire. “They do fantastic food, but I could sit in there
  with pints, just reading a book. I don’t feel as if I’m in the way, or taking
  up a table that someone else might eat at, whereas there are pubs that have
  gone completely the other way.” It’s almost as if “gastro” and “pub” are going
  their separate ways. So how can you avoid disappointment with your pub meal?
  What are the warning signs? “Because I’m in the industry, I always look at the
  tills,” says Rogers. “If the tills are the corporate type, where it’s the same
  system that’s run all over the country, then I’m always suspicious.” Hannon
  says: “Look at the menu: size, focus, how it is actually presented. No
  laminated menus, no menus that try to be Chinese, Indian and Sunday roast.
  Talk to the staff about where the produce is from, how long the chef has been
  there.” Rogers continues: “I think one way to spot a really good, decent pub
  menu is that it’s short. If you’ve got 35 main courses and 20 starters, you
  can be certain that most of that is in the freezer.” Look for closer to six
  starters, mains and desserts. “If I go to a chain pub somewhere that I’ve not
  been to before and I look at the menu and it’s like ‘lasagne’, then you just
  know that that’s frozen and microwaved,” says Mather. “The fish and chips –
  that’s going to be frozen as well. Unless there’s a good specials menu, or
  it’s got really good local reviews, I would eat somewhere else.” There may be
  other solutions. In 2014, France launched a fait maison (homemade) scheme,
  whereby restaurants that genuinely made their food in-house could display a
  special logo. The scheme never caught on, but there are plans to revive it and
  make it mandatory. At the same time, especially in UK cities, there has been a
  resurgence of what might be called “drinking pubs”, where the emphasis is on
  the beer or wine, rather than the food: microbreweries, tap rooms and the
  like. There is also a growing appetite for locally owned pubs, says Mather,
  who just visited one in the Lake District. “Their food was fantastic and their
  entire staff seemed to care a lot about the food and drink that they’re
  serving.” Pubs were once the heart of the community and some places are
  successfully keeping them that way, not just with food and drink, but as
  gathering spaces for all manner of functions: artistic performances, family
  events, markets, workshops. The best boozers have always moved with the times,
  but also respected their hungry, cash-strapped customers – who can tolerate
  only so many soggy roast potatoes. • This article was amended on 5 August
