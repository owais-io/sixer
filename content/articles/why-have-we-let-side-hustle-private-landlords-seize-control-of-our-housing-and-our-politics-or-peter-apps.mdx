  In the 1970s, private landlordism in the UK was a fringe part of the market –
  and a dying one. With council housing plentiful and house prices within the
  range of those with decent, working-class jobs, we did not need private
  landlords. In the mid-1970s, the Conservative Policy Council had written that
  their decline was “quite irreversible” and that within a generation they would
  be “as extinct as the dinosaur”. This prediction has proved to be among the
  worst ever made about the UK housing market. Since then, our reliance on
  private landlords has exploded. They are now the first port of call for
  everyone in the market who cannot afford to buy: students, graduates,
  families, pensioners, refugees and more. There are 2.8 million private
  landlords in Britain – almost twice as many people as work for NHS England and
  almost four times the UK’s entire workforce of teachers. How did we go from
  one extreme to the other? We chose it. In 1979 Margaret Thatcher arrived with
  a new vision for the country. As she defunded and sold off council housing,
  her plan was that the private market would take its place. A big-bang
  deregulation of private renting in 1988 swept away rent control and introduced
  short tenancies where the tenant could be evicted at the end without the
  landlord needing a reason. Her expectation was big, strategic investment from
  the corporate world – there was demand for rented housing, so there would be
  supply. Competition would drive up standards. The state just needed to get out
  of the way and let it happen. But instead, something else happened. In 1996,
  “buy-to-let” mortgages were launched, targeting everyman investors with a bit
  of spare cash. Previously, the only way to build up a property portfolio was
  to take out a commercial mortgage. This new product was available to anyone
  with a deposit, the repayments were interest only and the mortgages could be
  written off against tax. This came at a time when a global collapse of
  interest rates left lots of people without a viable pension plan, which meant
  it was suddenly the most obvious, and perhaps only, route to financial
  security. By 2001, the number of private landlords had exploded, but a survey
  revealed that only 9% of landlords saw the profession as their full-time
  occupation. It was the dawn of what the lawyer and writer Nick Bano terms “the
  small-time side hustler”. Today, we live in the wreckage of this policy
  failure. The thirst for investment assets has driven house prices far beyond
  the reach of ordinary first-time buyers, especially in big cities. Meanwhile,
  rents have soared – as landlords make use of Thatcher’s “no-fault evictions”
  to create an effective ratchet system, where they can quickly and easily evict
  tenants in favour of whoever can pay the most. We have some of the lowest
  protections for renters in the developed world, and are, according to the
  London School of Economics “at one end of the international spectrum on rent
  control” – ie the end that gives most freedom to landlords. The consequences
  of this are plain – people on lower incomes can no longer afford to live in
  the cities where they need to work; those who fall into homelessness are stuck
  in temporary accommodation indefinitely; and pensioners and families who
  cannot buy or find council housing are left without security. It is a great
  failure of policymakers of all parties over the past 35 years that they have
  simply sat back and let this happen. All of which brings me to Rushanara Ali.
  The homelessness minister resigned last Thursday after the revelation that she
  had kicked tenants out of her private rental property, before putting it back
  on the market at a significantly increased rent. This was, in effect, a
  classic example of the “ratchet effect” of rent increases, and a major driver
  of the homelessness she is supposed to prevent. Ali resigned as minister, but
  retains the Labour whip and returns to the backbenches, where she will join
  the Labour MP for Ilford South, Jas Athwal, who was exposed last year for
  renting out properties with black mould and ant infestations. They are among
  83 landlord MPs in the House of Commons – a list that includes the foreign
  secretary, David Lammy, and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves. Labour has more
  landlords among its ranks than any other party, with 43. And this is before we
  get into the House of Lords – a chamber previously made up exclusively of
  landowners. There are at least 134 landlord peers in the upper house, although
  the true number is likely to be much higher – with many holding properties via
  a trust. All of this poses a big problem in policy terms. Listen to the
  landlord lobby and you would imagine that policy has turned decisively in
  favour of tenants in recent years, with landlords’ representative arm warning
  that forthcoming changes to tax, law and environmental requirements will drive
  24% of its members to sell up. The legal change they are worried about is the
  Renters’ Rights Act, which will abolish no-fault evictions and impose tougher
  standards for fixing serious disrepair – in other words, attempting to tackle
  the behaviour of Ali and Athwal respectively. But these laws have been
  desperately slow coming through. They are a package of changes first announced
  in April 2019, under the government of Theresa May. That they took six and a
  half years and a change of government to finally become law owed something to
  the Conservative party’s fear of its backbenches, as Tory MPs pushed back hard
  against the removal of no-fault evictions. We will now get the act, with royal
  assent likely in September and implementation from 2026. It makes steps
  towards a more stable, European-style rental market. That it is coming at all
  shows progress, and perhaps the start of a break in the dominance of the
  landlord influence in parliament. That it has taken so long shows the control
  that force has had over our politics until now. Labour does also appear likely
  to impose a requirement to bring private rented homes up to a moderate
  standard of environmental efficiency by 2030 – though this faces continual
  challenge and was previously scrapped by the Conservatives after landlord
  pressure. Rental reforms, though, remain off limits, despite support from
  figures outside parliament such as Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham. Labour called
  even limited rent control “cowardice” before the election. Over the past 35
  years, we have dug ourselves into a pit. The dominance of the rental market by
  small-time side hustlers makes any reform perilous: if these landlords sell
  up, those who need somewhere to rent will be left in the lurch. If we want a
  functional housing market again, we need a long-term housing strategy that
  ends our reliance on side hustlers to meet complex housing needs and
  encourages an economy that treats homes as places to live, not an investment
  asset to replace a pension. But we are unlikely to ever see such a strategy
  when it is the side hustlers themselves entrusted to write it. Peter Apps is a
