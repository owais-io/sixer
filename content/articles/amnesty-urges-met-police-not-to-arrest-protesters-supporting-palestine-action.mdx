  Amnesty International has warned the Met police against arresting participants
  protesting this Saturday in London in support of Palestine Action, as the
  first people were charged for showing support for the banned group. Two women
  and a man who were arrested in Westminster after a protest in central London
  on 5 July will appear in court on 16 September. Jeremy Shippam, 71, of West
  Sussex, Judit Murray, also 71, of Surrey, and Fiona Maclean, 53, of Hackney,
  north-east London, were charged with showing support for a proscribed
  organisation under section 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000. A total of 10 people
  have been charged across the UK for suspected offences under the Terrorism Act
  since the proscription of Palestine Action, counter-terrorism police said on
  Thursday. Since the ban, a total of 221 people have been arrested by police
  across Britain, including one person who was arrested under section 11,
  membership of a proscribed organisation. A total of 58 have been arrested
  under section 12 (inviting support for, recklessly expressing support for, or
  arranging a meeting in support of a proscribed organisation) and 162 arrested
  under section 13 (wearing clothing or carrying articles in public which arouse
  reasonable suspicion that an individual is a member or supporter of a
  proscribed organisation or publishing an image of an article such as a flag or
  logo). A protest in support of the group is planned for Saturday afternoon in
  Parliament Square, central London. Organisers expect more than 500 people to
  attend. Those taking part have been asked by the organisers, the pressure
  group Defend Our Juries, to hold signs saying: “I oppose genocide, I support
  Palestine Action.” Defend Our Juries said on Thursday that an open meeting it
  had scheduled on Zoom had been taken down after the company received a request
  from the Metropolitan police. The group said it had received an email from
  Zoom that said it was granting a request from the Met’s Counter Terrorism
  Internet Referral Unit to restrict users accessing the meeting. Commander
  Dominic Murphy, the head of the Met’s counter-terrorism unit, said the force
  would be sending case files to the CPS for the other 26 people arrested on 5
  July. “I would strongly advise anyone planning to come to London this weekend
  to show support for Palestine Action to think about the potential criminal
  consequences of their actions,” he added. In a letter to Mark Rowley, the Met
  commissioner, Amnesty International UK called for “restraint” to be exercised
  when policing people holding placards expressing support for Palestine Action
  The letter, signed by Amnesty UK’s chief executive, Sacha Deshmukh, said the
  arrest of otherwise peaceful protesters solely for expressing a statement such
  as I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action was a violation of the UK’s
  international obligations to protect the rights of freedom of expression and
  assembly. “As such, we urge you to instruct your officers to comply with the
  UK’s international obligations and act with restraint in their response to any
  such protests that occur, by not arresting protesters who are merely carrying
  placards that state they oppose genocide and support Palestine Action,” the
  letter said. The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, proscribed Palestine Action
  last month after activists caused an estimated £7m of damage to jets at the
  RAF Brize Norton military base in Oxfordshire. Cooper said on Wednesday night
  that the decision to proscribe was based on strong security advice and the
  unanimous recommendation by the expert cross-government proscription review
  group. “It also follows disturbing information referencing planning for
  further attacks, the details of which cannot yet be publicly reported due to
  ongoing legal proceedings,” she added. “Those who seek to support this group
  may yet not know the true nature of the organisation. But people should be
  under no illusion – this is not a peaceful or non-violent protest group.” The
  proscription decision was not about Palestine, she added, and did not affect
  the freedom to protest about Palestinian rights. “It only applies to the
  specific and narrow organisation, Palestine Action, whose activities do not
  reflect or represent the thousands of people across the country who continue
  to exercise their fundamental rights to protest on different issues.”
