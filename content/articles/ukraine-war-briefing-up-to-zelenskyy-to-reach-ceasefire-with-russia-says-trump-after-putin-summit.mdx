  Donald Trump has put the onus on Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to
  reach a ceasefire with Russia after the US leader held direct talks with his
  Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in Alaska on Friday. Trump said Zelenskyy
  and Putin were going to set up a meeting to try to reach a ceasefire to end
  the war in Ukraine. “Now, it’s really up to President Zelenskyy to get it
  done,” Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity after his meeting with Putin. “And I
  would also say the European nations, they have to get involved a little bit.
  But it’s up to President Zelenskyy … And if they’d like, I’ll be at that next
  meeting.” Trump said the direct talks with Putin on Friday did not yield an
  agreement to pause the war in Ukraine, though he claimed “great progress”
  during the nearly three-hour-long summit. “I believe we had a very productive
  meeting,” the US president said at a joint press conference with Putin after
  the talks. “There were many, many points that we agreed on.” Putin, speaking
  through an interpreter, suggested the two leaders had hammered out “an
  understanding”. He said he expected Ukraine and its European allies to accept
  the results of the US-Russia negotiation constructively and not try to
  “disrupt the emerging progress”. The Russian leader agreed that Ukraine’s
  security must be guaranteed – but also said that the “root causes” of the
  conflict must be resolved. Zelenskyy said Russia was continuing to attack
  Ukraine ahead of the Trump-Putin summit, but claimed its attempt to “show
  strength” with a new assault in the east had failed. “On the day of the
  negotiations, they also kill people. And that says a lot,” Zelenskyy said on
  Telegram on Friday. “The war continues. It continues precisely because there
  is no order, nor any indication that Moscow is preparing to end this war.”
  Ukraine said it had conducted a long-range drone attack on a supply ship that
  it claims was carrying drone components from Iran, hours before the
  Trump-Putin summit. Photographs showed a partially sunken cargo vessel at
  Olya, near Astrakhan, north of the Caspian Sea. Ukraine’s military claimed
  credit for the attack and the overnight bombing of an oil refinery at Samara
  on the Volga River, deep inside Russia. Ukraine’s general staff said the ship
  was “loaded with components” for Shahed-type drones “and ammunition from
  Iran”. Russia launched a ballistic missile into Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk
  region hours before the Trump-Putin summit, killing one person and wounding at
  least one other, and causing a fire. “A truck and a minibus were damaged in a
  hostile attack on the Dnipro district. A man was killed. Another person was
  injured,” the regional governor, Serhiy Lysak, said on Telegram. The city of
  Dnipro is a logistics hub for Ukrainian forces. The Ukrainian military says it
  has retaken six villages in the east that Russia captured in a push this week.
  On Tuesday, Russia made a swift advance to the town of Dobropillia, piercing
  through Ukraine’s defences. “The advance of the enemy was stopped by the
  forces of the 1st Corps of the National Guard of Ukraine (NGU) ‘Azov’,
  together with adjacent and subordinate units, over the past three days,”
  Ukraine’s general staff said. The town is now under constant Russian drone and
  shell fire. Ukrainian military intelligence claimed that Russia is preparing
  to test its new nuclear-capable, nuclear-powered cruise missile and, if
  successful, plans to use the results to bolster its negotiating position with
  the west. Military intelligence spokesperson Andriy Yusov told Reuters that
  Moscow saw the test as diplomatic leverage. “Russia is preparing for another
  round of tests of the 9M730 Burevestnik,” his statement said. “The purpose of
  these tests is to validate scientific and technical solutions implemented by
  the missile. If successful, Russia will leverage the test results to defend
  its interests in negotiations.”
