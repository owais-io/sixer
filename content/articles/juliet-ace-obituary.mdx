  My mother, Juliet Ace, who has died aged 87, was one of the original writers
  for the TV soap EastEnders and a prolific playwright specialising in radio
  drama. She wrote two films for S4C (Llygad y Ffynnon, 1994, and Cameleon,
  1997), more than 40 radio plays and many episodes of The Archers. She was
  nominated for a Welsh Bafta and twice for Sony awards. Her final radio play
  for BBC Radio 4 was Moving the Goalposts, broadcast in 2020, which told the
  story of her survival of stage four spinal cancer. She somewhat miraculously
  defied the prognosis of imminent death and lived for another 12 years, but was
  in no way heroic about it. One of her proudest moments came when a doctor told
  her that he had prescribed her play to one of his patients. Born and raised in
  Llanelli, south Wales, Juliet was the daughter of Glenys (nee Evans) and
  Charles Ace, a businessman. It was a chaotic wartime childhood, speaking Welsh
  with her mother’s relatives in Llangennech and English at home: her father
  wanted her to sound like a Home Service announcer. After leaving Llanelli
  girls’ grammar school, she trained as a teacher in Coventry and as an actor at
  Rose Bruford College in London. She was in weekly rep at the Swansea Grand
  theatre before leaving to care for her dying mother, then taught for a while
  at Edward Seguin school in Finsbury Park, north London. After marrying Richard
  Alexander in 1966, she moved to Dartmouth, Devon, where her husband worked as
  a lecturer at the Naval College. She had two children, Daniel and me, worked
  in local primary schools and was involved in the Dartmouth Players. In her
  late 30s she realised she was a writer after attending a residential course
  run by the Arvon Foundation, and the plays poured out of her. She claimed to
  have had enough rejection letters to paper her toilet walls, but her first
  broadcast play, Speak No Evil, went out on BBC Radio 4 in 1980. Steadily she
  built a reputation for her keen characterisations, sharp and truthful dialogue
  and exploration of social themes as diverse as hearing loss, Kurdish refugees
  in London and war correspondents in Beirut. Many of her plays were
  autobiographical and described life growing up in Wales, her communist uncles,
  and more recently her two experiences of cancer. After her marriage ended, she
  moved back to London in the 1980s. Her talent had been spotted by Julia Smith
  and Tony Holland, and in 1985 she was part of the first group of writers for
  the new BBC soap EastEnders. She loved the work, the new friendships, and the
  income that enabled her to buy a dilapidated house in Camden. In recent years
  she researched and wrote Rigby Shlept Here (2015), a biography of the actor
  Terence Rigby: a tribute to one of her dearest friends. She lived
  independently until the end of her life, fiercely intelligent and with a
  strong propensity for giggles. She is survived by Daniel and me, and by three
  grandchildren, George, Masha and Stanley.
