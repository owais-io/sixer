  Morning everyone. Last year’s devastating bleaching event on the Great Barrier
  Reef has led to the biggest annual drop in live coral for decades, scientists
  warn today. Plus: a 13-year-old girl has been charged with murdering another
  girl on the same exchange visit from China, the Gaza “apocalypse” seen from
  the sky, and this month’s best Australian books. Australia Smart skinks |
  Australian skinks have evolved the means to resist snake venom by shutting
  down their muscles, suggests new research which could help find new treatments
  for snakebites. Coral blow | The Great Barrier Reef has suffered its biggest
  annual drop in live coral in two out of three areas monitored by scientists
  since 1986, a new report has revealed. Student stabbing | A 14-year-old girl
  on an exchange visit from China has been killed and her fellow exchange
  student has been charged with murder after a stabbing at their host family’s
  home in the Hunter Valley. Graduates ‘failed’ | Labor MPs are increasing
  pressure on the government to speed up reform of the controversial
  Morrison-era job-ready graduates scheme that has “failed” students. Meanwhile,
  the legality of the system designed to penalise jobseekers has been thrown
  into doubt after the commonwealth ombudsman found a government department’s
  automatic system unlawfully cancelled payments. Invasive innovation | A study
  has shown that two invasive weed species could be used as ingredients for
  clean, renewable fuel. World Gaza ‘apocalypse’ | Our reporter and photographer
  joined a Jordanian airdrop over Gaza to witness the devastation wreaked on the
  territory which resembles “the aftermath of an apocalypse”. An Israeli
  security cabinet meeting, which had been expected to be held overnight to
  debate Benjamin Netanyahu’s call for the “full occupation” of Gaza, has been
  postponed amid mounting tensions over whether the plan is feasible. Mea culpa
  | An admission by Spanish conservative MP Noelia Núñez that she had never
  completed her double degree in law and public administration has sparked a
  wave of similar confessions from politicians. Epstein trove | The Jeffrey
  Epstein scandal has broadened after the New York Times published a trove of
  previously unseen letters to the disgraced late financier from numerous
  powerful figures such as Woody Allen and former Israeli leader Ehud Barak. The
  House of Representatives oversight committee has subpoenaed Bill and Hillary
  Clinton as well as several former attorneys general and directors of the FBI
  demanding “testimony related to horrific crimes” perpetrated by Epstein.
  Genie’s out | As Google outlined its latest step towards artificial general
  intelligence with a new model, ChatGPT said it would not tell people looking
  for advice online to break up with their partner. In Sweden, the prime
  minister has admitted that he regularly consults AI tools for a second
  opinion, prompting voters to say “we didn’t vote for AI”. Norway search |
  Rescuers in Norway have resumed the search for an award-winning former
  Guardian journalist, Alec Luhn, who has gone missing in bad weather during a
  solo hike in the remote Folgefonna national park. Full Story The Descendants
  episode 2: the search for Tom Wills In the final part of our Descendants
  investigation, we look at the 1861 Cullin-la-ringo massacre of white settlers
  in which Australian rules football pioneer Tom Wills escaped death. In today’s
  podcast, Indigenous affairs reporter Ella Archibald-Binge and Lorena Allam
  from UTS’s Jumbunna Institute discuss suggestions that Wills may also have
  been involved in a revenge attack on Indigenous people, and how families on
  both sides of the conflict are reckoning with the truth of their ancestors’
  colonial past. In-depth In its latest report into how to improve the economy,
  the Productivity Commission says it is examining whether technology firms
  should be exempted from copyright rules so companies can freely mine text and
  data to train artificial intelligence models. Not the news Our writers have
  picked out the best Australian books published this month, including the
  second part of David Day’s biography of Bob Hawke chronicling his years as
  prime minister, a biography of Bryce Courtenay by his son, Adam, and campfire
  recipes by Outback Tom and Steve Forrest. Sport Rugby union | After beating
  the Lions on Saturday, Australia are fit and full of fire ahead of matches
  against South Africa. Golf | Sports organisations in the US are hoping for

  English’s caddie was denied a visa for the Open because of a criminal
  conviction. Football | Manchester United could thwart Newcastle’s £70m effort
  to sign the RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko after making a rival bid amid
  their belief the player would prefer a move to Old Trafford. Media roundup A
  controversial $39m office development next to St Mary’s Cathedral has been
  approved, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. Tasmania’s premier is being
  “pig-headed” by announcing he will visit the governor to seek another term,
