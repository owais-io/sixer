  If senior Conservatives thought things couldn’t get any worse for the party
  after its historic defeat in last year’s general election then the past 12
  months has proved them wrong. Latest Ipsos polling has the Tory party’s
  national vote share on just 15%. YouGov polling has the party on 18%. The last
  time the Conservative party polled 30% or more was in September 2022. A party
  that gave people a choice at the ballot box has become a husk. It is, as a
  former MP colleague said to me recently, akin to an empty warehouse – the
  building is still there but the goods inside have all but disappeared. And now
  those who have built this most unpopular version of the Conservative party are
  beginning to implicitly acknowledge the truth, and are coming up with the next
  “doom loop” step for their party. Now it’s time to “unite the right”, they
  begin to chatter. The logic is that bringing the votes of the Conservative and
  Reform UK parties together adds up to a vote-share far greater than your
  opponents have. Surely then, they believe, we can win again. Yet those
  Conservatives wanting to “unite the right” should be careful what they wish
  for. For those many other Conservatives feeling queasy about that next step,
  they’re right. Here’s why. It’s simplistic to think you can just add up the
  Conservative vote and the Reform UK vote and then it’s enough to win. For a
  start, it assumes the dwindling Tory vote is stable – it’s not. And in no
  sense is there a distinct Tory vote any more – voters have switched to Reform
  UK (in the north) or to the Liberal Democrats (in the south), or
  conventionally, to Labour. Importantly, the reality is that the more the
  Tories talk about uniting the right, the more they are essentially telling all
  voters the two parties are now so similar that there is no real difference
  between them. In effect, they are either validating a pro-Reform UK voter to
  switch to Reform or an anti-Reform voter to switch to a different party
  standing against Reform. So, on messaging alone, calling for “unite the right”
  could be the equivalent of the Conservative party self-administering a
  political cyanide pill from a bottle labelled “how to get rid of your
  remaining voters”. More practically, in our first-past-the-post electoral
  system, voters may anyhow consider that if they want to eject the Labour party
  from power at the next general election, they should vote for the party best
  able to beat it. It will be an uphill struggle for the Conservatives to
  persuade voters that they have a chance of winning locally in constituencies
  if Reform UK continues to poll so far ahead nationally. Senior Conservatives
  may remember that, in advance of the 2019 general election, there was a
  similar clamour to bring together the rightwing vote. Then, the rightwing
  press successfully put pressure on the smaller of the two rightwing parties,
  the Brexit party, to have its candidates step aside, rather than risk a Labour
  government. It worked hugely to the Conservatives’ advantage. But now the
  tables have turned, and it is the Brexit party’s new incarnation, Reform UK,
  that is the dominant political force. It’s wishful thinking in the extreme
  that Nigel Farage and the Reform UK party will give way again. Conversely, at
  the next election, it may well be the Conservative party being put under
  pressure by the rightwing press to withdraw its candidates, with Conservative
  constituency associations all over the country told: “Sorry, don’t bother
  selecting a candidate this time, Reform has a better chance in your patch.”
  That would be a sure-fire way to decimate any remaining grassroots support and
  Conservative party membership. Yet it’s hard to argue against that logic when
  there are those in the party making the argument of “unite the right”. Is
  there an alternative path ahead for the Conservatives, other than continuing
  to follow this political death-wish cult, taking the party further into the
  electoral abyss? Yes, but it’s a hard one. First, all those who want to “unite
  the right” should be told to do that – go and join Reform UK. If they don’t
  think they can beat them, they should join them. At least it would remove
  their negativity from the party and leave it to those who still believe the
  Conservative party could offer something distinctive and positive to Britain
  again. Those remaining could shift it to once more become a more centrist
  party capable of reaching a broader base of voters. But it’s a tall order. It
  would take time to move on from the disastrous state of the party in recent
  years. And there is the bigger question: if all the Conservatives who deep
  down prefer Reform UK joined Reform, how many would be left? What we do know
  is that the polls show beyond doubt that this current version of the
  Conservative party has run out of road. It can change the driver at the wheel
  (again), but it has been the political direction and strategy that has been
  all wrong, not just the captain at the helm. The latest changing tack on North
  Sea oil and gas, with promises to “maximise extraction”, is yet more
  Reform-lite messing that comes over to voters as the party being a follower
  not a leader. Until the Conservative party accepts this diagnosis it will
  continue to terminally decline. A fundamental reset is required. The party
  needs to reinvent and modernise, not merge. A message of “unite the right” is
  not what the Conservatives need, because that “unite the right” benefits only
  one party, and that party is Reform UK. Justine Greening is a former
  Conservative minister and was MP for Putney from 2005 to 2019 Do you have an
