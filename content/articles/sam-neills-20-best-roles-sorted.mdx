  Scientists, farmers, spies, cops, priests, the devil incarnate: is there any
  role Sam Neill can’t play? The New Zealand actor has been delivering cracking
  performances for more than four decades and, after returning to screens in
  Untamed and the third season of The Twelve, shows no signs of slowing down.
  Here are his 20 all-time greatest performances. 20. Reilly: Ace of Spies
  (1983) This is the Neill performance that’ll make you think: hot damn, he
  could’ve made a great James Bond. In this UK TV series he plays a Russian spy
  who works for the Brits; he is a devil with the ladies; and he scrubs up great
  in a tux: tick tick tick. The show is adapted from Robin Bruce Lockhart’s 1967
  book Ace of Spies, and its titular character based on Sidney Reilly, a
  real-life spy who was executed by the Soviets in 1925. 19. The Hunt for Red
  October (1990) It couldn’t have been easy to hold your own against Sean
  Connery. But in John McTiernan’s deep sea blockbuster, Neill delivers a
  thoroughly engrossing supporting performance as Vasily Borodin, the
  second-in-command to Connery’s Capt Marko Ramius, a Soviet who defects to the
  US. Borodin is pragmatic and process-driven but embroiled in dangerously
  volatile circumstances. 18. The Tudors (2007-10) In this glamorous and racy
  series set in 16th-century England, Neill plays Henry VIII’s most trusted
  adviser, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey. He’s a man of the cloth, who clearly enjoys
  being referred to as “your eminence”, but is also a cunning and calculating
  powerbroker who doesn’t like getting his hands dirty. Staying on the king’s
  good side is easier said than done, as is surviving in this world; let’s just
  say Wolsey doesn’t appear in the second season. 17. Sweet Country (2017)
  Everybody brings their A game to Warwick Thornton’s sumptuously shot
  neo-western, one of the greatest Australian films of the century to date.
  Neill plays a preacher, Fred Smith, who’s a little pious but walks the walk –
  following Bryan Brown’s sergeant on his mission to track down an Aboriginal
  man accused of murder (Hamilton Morris) because “I want to see him come back
  alive”. It’s not a huge performance but it’s beautifully balanced. Tender yet
  tough. 16. The Dish (2000) Rob Sitch’s pleasant historical drama is based on
  the true story of the Parkes Observatory, which helped Nasa track and
  broadcast Apollo 11’s voyage to the moon. Neill plays Cliff, the observatory’s
  mild-mannered but intensely focused director. It’s a warm, fully rounded
  performance that takes an avuncular tone, complete with a face-stretching
  smile and pipe hanging from his mouth. 15. The Piano (1993) Initially Neill’s
  character in Jane Campion’s Palme d’Or-winning masterpiece seems relatively
  fair-minded, playing the new husband of Holly Hunter’s famously mute
  protagonist, Ada. That changes in the final act, when he violently responds to
  discovering Ada’s love affair with a retired sailor (Harvey Keitel), tipping
  the film into nightmarish terrain. It’s broodingly dark and poetic, and all
  the performances are great. 14. Daybreakers (2009) The ol’ vampire villain is
  given a modern, corporate makeover in the Spierig brothers’ revisionist genre
  movie, in which Neill plays Charles Bromley, the chief executive of the
  largest supplier of blood in the US. In this world, most humans have become
  vamps, leading to a massive blood shortage that Bromley’s determined to
  exploit. Neill gives him a monstrously large impact, with an air of menacing
  sophistication. In one memorable scene he elegantly quaffs a lovely glass of
  red – and no, it’s not wine. 13. Death in Brunswick (1990) In this classic
  Australian black comedy Neill plays Carl, a manchild who sleeps in late,
  rarely washes his clothes (he rarely washes anything) and lives in a grubby
  broken-down house. He does, however, scrub up pretty well in a black leather
  jacket. The plot kicks into gear when Carl – a two-bit chef at a dingy club –
  accidentally kills a drug dealer and sets off a gangland war. Neill makes him
  a little blase and aloof, and pitiable in some ways – but he is also his own
  worst enemy. 12. The Omen: The Final Conflict (1981) An adult Damien Thorn is
  a role that could so easily have tipped into evil cartoonishness. But Neill is
  devilishly good in The Omen’s second sequel, imbuing the protagonist with a
  disquietingly calm and serpentine presence. Thorn’s smile stretches a little
  too wide, and something funny’s going on with his eyes; he seems to look
  through people. The film can be a little goofy, stuffed to the gills with talk
  of prophecies and end times, but it builds a genuinely creepy psychological
  space. 11. My Brilliant Career (1979) Gillian Armstrong’s superb adaptation of
  Miles Franklin’s classic feminist novel is centred around Judy Davis’s great
  performance as the bull-headed protagonist Sybylla Melvyn, an aspiring author
  who dreams of something greater than a rural life as a wife. Her primary love
  interest is Neill’s Harry Beecham: a man of the world with a polite, dignified
  way about him that takes on extra layers as the role deepens. Harry is
  swoon-worthy but Sybylla is no pushover, twice rejecting his hand in marriage.
  10. Merlin (1998) What a spunky wizard! Neill cuts a charismatic presence as
  the lead in this two-part miniseries about the mythic middle ages magician,
  giving the role dramatic weight but also leaning into the story’s
  fairytale-like elements. The special effects of course have dated but the
  production holds up surprisingly well, with an appealingly old-timey spirit of
  adventure. 9. Event Horizon (1997) Critics have never been kind to Paul
  Anderson’s gruesome sci-fi about a team of astronauts who land on a ship that
  haunts people with their deepest fears, but it’s a cracking movie. Neill’s
  role as the ship’s designer, Dr William Weir, begins in geeky scientist mode
  but becomes a berserk reinvention of the mad scientist trope. “Where we’re
  going, we won’t need eyes to see,” says Weir, around the time he literally
  opens the gates of hell. Good times. 8. Possession (1981) Cranked to 11?
  Dowsed in petrol, then set on fire? No string of words, however sensational,
  can capture the balls-to-the-wall spirit of Neill’s ghoulish performance in
  Andrzej Żuławski’s cult classic. Nor the qualities of the film itself – a
  bizarre combination of relationship drama and Grand Guignol spectacle. Neill
  plays Mark, a spy who returns home to West Berlin and discovers that his wife
  (Isabelle Adjani) wants a divorce; it might have something to do with a
  bedroom kink involving an tentacled alien. 7. Rams (2020) Neill has never been
  more huggable than in Jeremy Sims’ remake of the Icelandic drama of the same
  name, in which he stars as Colin, a hardy and empathetic sheep farmer. He
  really, really loves his flock, though such affection does not extend to his
  crotchety brother Les (Michael Caton), who lives next door. The pair haven’t
  spoken in years but that might change when a rare disease infects their
  animals. 6. Evil Angels (1988) Titled A Cry in the Dark outside Australia and
  New Zealand, Fred Schepisi’s drama about the trial of Lindy and Michael
  Chamberlain arrived in Australian cinemas with white-hot topicality, just six
  weeks after their convictions for murdering their daughter Azaria were
  quashed. Both lead performances are hauntingly powerful, with Neill starring
  opposite Meryl Streep as Michael, a holier-than-thou pastor who questions his
  faith when the trial puts them through the wringer. 5. Peaky Blinders
  (2013-22) Cillian Murphy’s gangster Tommy Shelby and his gang of “Peaky
  Blinders” find themselves in an existential fight for survival when Neill’s
  hotshot chief inspector Maj Campbell arrives in town, sent from Belfast to
  clean up the streets and retrieve stolen weapons. It’s a deliciously
  entertaining performance with plenty of chest-thumping dialogue, and sizzling
  chemistry with Murphy. 4. Jurassic Park (1993) Who could forget Neill’s
  palaeontologist, Dr Alan Grant, gawking at a Brachiosaurus while John
  Williamson’s beautiful score swells? This moment from Jurassic Park
  demonstrates how special effects can evoke wonder, rather than just fill the
  frame with bling. There are a couple of other scientist characters in the
  Jurassic Park franchise but it was Grant who got his own film (Jurassic Park
  3). 3. Dead Calm (1989) For a large chunk of Phillip Noyce’s white-knuckle
  thriller, Neill’s navy officer John is alone on a sinking ship, with nobody to
  share the frame with or bounce off. It’s a role that required emotional and
  physical intensity. The calm-under-fire John tries his darndest to stay alive
  and return to his wife (Nicole Kidman), who’s alone on their yacht with a
  psychotic stranger (Billy Zane). The film is pacy as hell; there’s a real
  electrical charge to it. 2. Hunt for the Wilderpeople (2016) Taika Waititi’s
  beloved New Zealand comedy unforgettably paired on-the-run young delinquent
  Ricky Baker (Julian Dennison) with Neill’s cranky foster uncle Hector. Neill
  goes whole hog on the grumpy old man shtick – smoking, grunting and firing off
  fun lines like, “You ever worked on a farm before, are you just ornamental?”
  The stoic Hector, who always looks as though he’s had too much to drink, may
  not want our love, but by god, he got it. 1. In the Mouth of Madness (1994)
  John Carpenter’s sensationally loud and Lovecraftian horror movie features a
  brilliant, wall-rattling performance from Neill, who perfectly drives the
  human elements of this long under-appreciated film. He plays John Trent, an
  insurance investigator convinced that a mass hysteria event surrounding the
  release of a new horror novel is a PR trick. The hardened cynic who becomes a
  true believer is a classic trajectory, and our man runs with it to hell and
  back, the protagonist’s sanity erupting like a burst blood vessel. So good.
