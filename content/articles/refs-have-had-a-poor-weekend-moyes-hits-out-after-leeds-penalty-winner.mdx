  David Moyes has questioned the standard of Premier League officiating on the
  opening weekend of the new season after his side were at the centre of a
  controversial decision in their defeat against Leeds on Monday. Everton were
  beaten 1-0 at Elland Road courtesy of a late penalty from debutant Lukas
  Nmecha, after James Tarkowski had been adjudged to have handled inside the
  Everton penalty area. However, Moyes said he was disappointed not just with
  that decision, but with the overall standard across the first round of
  fixtures. “I’m obviously going to say it’s not a penalty and I believe it’s
  not a penalty,” he said of the winning goal. “I’ve been to see the referee.
  The referee sort of took nothing to do with it, he thought it was to do with
  VAR, the decision they’ve made. I don’t know what else I can say.” But Moyes
  did not stop there in his criticism. “I actually think the referees have had a
  poor weekend in the opening weekend,” he said. “I think there have been a lot
  of [poor] decisions and tonight’s is another one. The rules are supposed to be
  that if you keep your hands down to your side and if anything he’s tried to
  get it behind his back as well. “The ball takes a deflection on the flight as
  well. You’re allowed to block it and he’s leaned towards the ball, we accept
  that. We saw one on Friday night [in Liverpool v Bournemouth] that wasn’t
  given, which looked far clearer a handball than what it was tonight.” Moyes
  admitted Everton did not deserve anything from the game at Elland Road and
  said they will have to be patient with new signing Jack Grealish, who appeared
  only for the final 19 minutes on Monday evening. “Jack’s trained really well,”
  he said. “I just want to bring him in at the right time rather than the
  expectations be too high, too quickly for him. I think he’s very rarely played
  two games in a row. He’s very rarely played three games in a row, so if you
  look into his history we need to bring him on at the right times.”
