  Kemi Badenoch has spoken openly about the racism she has suffered as the first
  black woman to lead the Conservative party. The Tory leader told the Sunday
  Times she had been surprised at the amount of racism she had faced since being
  elected, having previously insisted that Britain was “the best place in the
  world to be black”. She told the paper: “There’s a certain cadre of people who
  clearly can’t cope with the fact that I won this and I’m doing it. “The level
  of personal attacks from anonymous people, it’s hysterical. Not even just from
  MPs. I actually don’t think it’s that many MPs. I think it’s two to three
  people out of 120. That’s nothing. But online as well. People used to talk
  about Trump derangement syndrome. I think there’s a Kemi derangement syndrome:
  ‘How could she possibly have done this?’.” She added that on social media,
  “there’s a lot of ethno-nationalism creeping up, lots of stuff about my race
  and my ethnicity and the tropes around, ‘well, she couldn’t possibly have done
  this all by herself’”. Badenoch, who was born in Wimbledon but grew up in
  Nigeria before moving back to the UK aged 16, rarely talks at length about her
  race or heritage. She said recently she no longer felt Nigerian and has
  frequently criticised anti-racism campaigners and critical race theory. She
  told the Sunday Times: “I always try to think of every possible explanation
  before I go to race and racism. I think that is a healthy way to run a
  society. I remember when I stood up a few years ago and said Britain is not a
  racist country – ethnic minorities do very well here, it is white
  working-class boys who are actually struggling on a lot of metrics, and I got
  pilloried for that. “My view is that there are people out there who will say
  whatever it is, they will throw whatever kind of mud at you and they will hope
  that it sticks.” Badenoch faces a pivotal few months in the job as she
  prepares to deliver her first party conference speech as Tory leader and tries
  to fend off a potential leadership challenge from her shadow justice
  secretary, Robert Jenrick. The party sits in third place in the polls on 17%.
  Asked about claims by Jenrick’s supporters that he will soon be leading the
  party, she said: “I think it’s wishful thinking. “There will always be people
  who are sore losers, our candidate didn’t win, and so on, and sour grapes …
  When I hear those things, I can tell those people are not focused on the
  country at all. Many of those people having those conversations think this is
  a game. But the lives of people in this country aren’t a game.” Badenoch
  defended Jenrick, however, saying: “I think even Rob himself finds it
  distressing, but it’s just something that we deal with.”
