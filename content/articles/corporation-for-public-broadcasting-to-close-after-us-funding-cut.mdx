  The Corporation for Public Broadcasting announced on Friday it will shut down
  operations after losing federal funding, delivering a blow to America’s public
  media system and the more than 1,500 local stations that have relied on its
  support for nearly six decades. The closure follows the Republican-controlled
  House’s decision last month to eliminate $1.1bn in CPB funding over two years,
  part of a $9bn reduction to public media and foreign aid programs. “Despite
  the extraordinary efforts of millions of Americans who called, wrote, and
  petitioned Congress to preserve federal funding for CPB, we now face the
  difficult reality of closing our operations,” said Patricia Harrison, the
  corporation’s president and chief executive. The 57-year-old corporation
  distributed more than $500m annually to PBS, NPR and 1,500 local stations
  nationwide. Despite the federal support, stations mostly rely on viewer
  donations, corporate sponsorships and local government support for the
  remainder. Rural communities face the biggest impact, as 245 of the 544
  grantee organizations are considered rural and many may close without federal
  support which could affect educational programming, children’s shows and local
  news coverage. These rural stations also employ nearly 6,000 people, according
  to the CPB. Public broadcasting has historically served areas underserved by
  commercial media, providing emergency information during disasters and
  cultural programming not available elsewhere. Rural communities are already
  hard hit by a lack of community journalism, as one in three US counties do not
  have a full-time local journalist, according to a July report from Muck Rack
  and Rebuild Local News. Most CPB staff will be terminated by September’s end,
  with a small transition team remaining through January 2026 to wind down
  operations. Donald Trump and Republican allies have long argued that taxpayer
  funding for public media represents unnecessary government spending, while
  claiming that PBS and NPR programming exhibits anti-conservative bias. The
  Trump administration has also filed a lawsuit against three CPB board members
  who refused to leave their positions despite the president’s attempts to
  remove them. The closure ends nearly six decades of federal commitment to
  public broadcasting. The corporation was established by Congress in 1967 to
  ensure educational and cultural programming remained accessible to all
  Americans.
