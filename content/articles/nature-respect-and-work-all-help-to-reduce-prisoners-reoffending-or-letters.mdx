  Your article about the prisoner rehabilitation project LandWorks, excellent
  though it was, arguably placed too much emphasis on nature as the chief factor
  accounting for the project’s undoubted success (‘A natural antidepressant’:
  how working with the land is helping ex-prisoners, 16 August). I have been a
  keen supporter of the project since it was set up 12 years ago. The remarkably
  low reoffending rate (5%) seems to me to be due largely to participants being
  treated with respect, together with the wraparound care they receive while
  working at LandWorks. This ranges, as the article explains, from help with
  accommodation to finding work. I am sure that, with the same dedication and
  kindness, a similar project could be set up in the middle of a city, also with
  remarkably low costs. Gillian Hamilton Budleigh Salterton, Devon • I read the
  article about LandWorks with joy. I know the project and the effect it has on
  people. Margaret Thatcher brought in the “community care” initiative in 1983,
  closing psychiatric hospitals and selling off farmland. I was a psychiatric
  nurse. My patients loved working and being on the hospital’s farm – it gave
  them a reason to get up in the morning. Cut to Bristol city later that year:
  lots of the long-stay patients were placed in the local “community”, with
  nowhere to go all day, and only the promise of a fry-up in a local cafe. After
  that they were left on their own. So we made a place, Windmill Hill city farm,
  where they could come – it was just a secondhand caravan on some farmland with
  a former psychiatric nurse (me) on hand. It worked, and still does more than
  40 years later. Give people an opportunity to belong, and to matter. Sow the
  seeds and watch them grow. People need to belong to feel hope. That’s why
  “land works”. Juliana Dart Poundsgate, Devon • The obvious question is that if
  this works, why not have gardening clubs in schools, and set up schemes for
  youngsters to work with allotment groups or to tend a patch themselves?
  Imagine how much money would be saved. Add in fishing, which has also reduced
  recidivism. If people have a purpose and a connection to a community, it stops
  antisocial behaviour. In 10 years someone will do a research project and get
  paid to tell us these actions work. Do it now. A small investment will have a
  big impact. Heather Penny-Larter Swindon, Wiltshire • Have an opinion on
  anything you’ve read in the Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it
  will be considered for publication in our letters section.
