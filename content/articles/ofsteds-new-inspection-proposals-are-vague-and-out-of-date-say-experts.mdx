  Proposals for overhauled school inspections have been criticised as cosmetic,
  vague and potentially out of date by school leaders and Department for
  Education (DfE) officials, just days before approval by Ofsted’s management.
  Ofsted, the schools inspectorate, has made changes to its new school
  inspection toolkit – how it will carry out inspections – after earlier
  criticisms. It plans on renaming grades and shrinking the number of
  evaluations areas from nine to seven, in the latest draft seen by the
  Guardian, but appears unlikely to win over sceptical teachers in England. The
  new system is part of efforts to implement the government’s manifesto pledge
  to replace inspection reports with a “report card” format and do away with
  single summary grades such as “inadequate” that have become controversial
  since the death of Ruth Perry in 2023. But Ofsted’s struggle to reform its
  inspection framework is turning into a headache for Bridget Phillipson, the
  education secretary, who is also juggling a curriculum review and an overhaul
  of special needs education in England that are all scheduled to be published
  in autumn. The draft proposals, to be approved by Ofsted’s executive on
  Wednesday, has ditched controversial plans for a “secure” grade and instead
  renamed it “expected standard”, after complaints that the original term was
  confusing. The top grade, previously proposed as “exemplary”, has been
  replaced by “exceptional”, the “strong” grade amended to “strong standard”,
  while the lowest “causing concern” grade is changed to “urgent improvement”.
  There are also plans to cut the number of evaluation areas from nine to seven,
  by combining the teaching and curriculum areas into one, and merging the
  attendance and behaviour areas. It also revises the report card’s “traffic
  light” colour codes for grades, with the top exceptional grade to be blue
  instead of dark green. But the changes have been criticised as “cosmetic” by
  school leaders and are unlikely to settle the fears of teaching unions and
  multi-academy trusts, with one describing the proposals as “a pick-and-mix of
  statutory rules taken from random documents and turned into an inspection
  framework”. Those who have seen the revisions say it is studded with
  ill-defined language asking inspectors to evaluate categories such as
  leadership or assessment as “broadly,” “typically” or “on the whole” in line
  with national performance. “Some of the things that have made it in, you’re
  thinking, how do you inspect that? There’s a whole lot of vague language. I
  don’t think they are going to implement it,” one school leader said. “A lot of
  schools are going to end up in the middle bracket [of grades] because Ofsted
  won’t be able to argue against it. It’s a mess, it lacks precision, and
  there’s too much overlap between different categories.” DfE officials have
  raised concerns that the proposals fail to take account of the government’s
  plans to have mainstream schools open more units for children with special
  educational needs and disabilities (Send), as part of the overhaul of special
  needs provision in England to be announced in autumn, around the same time as
  the new inspection framework is being introduced. Feedback by DfE officials
  seen by the Guardian describes “future-proofing and sequencing concerns” about
  the toolkit, including that the expectations around pupils with Send “may
  become out of date”. The DfE feedback also suggests schools may be put off
  enrolling pupils with special needs because of Ofsted’s requirement that
  schools must achieve “above average outcomes” in Sats or GCSEs to be awarded
  high inspection grades. A spokesperson for Ofsted declined to respond directly
  to the criticisms but noted: “Our proposals, including the toolkits, will be
  formally finalised when we publish our response to the consultation in early
  September and not before. “We don’t recognise the ‘DfE criticism’ assertion –
  we are not out of step with government proposals. We have already made clear
  in recent press releases that we’re revising the toolkits to tighten language,
  in response to feedback – we are confident this will be recognised in
  September.” A DfE spokesperson said: “Our Send reforms will make sure there is
  more early intervention in mainstream schools, and we are working closely with
  Ofsted to ensure their education inspection framework enables this. “We are
  laying the groundwork to ensure all children have access to the help they
  need, from more early support in mainstream schools across ADHD, autism and
  speech and language needs, through to £740m investment to encourage councils
  to create more specialist places in mainstream schools.” Ofsted’s full
  proposals are due to be implemented from November. However, the Association of
  School and College Leaders and the National Association of Head Teachers have
  said that timetable is “entirely unacceptable”, adding: “It will significantly
  add to workload pressures, negatively affect leaders’ and teachers’ wellbeing
  and mental health, and further undermine trust in the proposed framework.”
  Relations between Ofsted and the teaching profession have been deeply strained
  since a coroner’s finding that Perry’s death was “contributed to by an Ofsted
  inspection”. Perry’s sister, Julia Waters, has described Ofsted’s proposed
  changes to inspections as “a rehash of a deeply flawed system”.
