  Summer’s ending – and the delusion that a new me might be possible is back |

  Every year at this time, I think of a quote from the Bible, but which I know
  from Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit by Jeanette Winterson, in which
  seven-year-old Jeanette stitches a needlepoint sampler decorated withthe
  inscription: “The summer is ended and we are not yet saved.” We are not yet
  saved: no, not in this house, where I experience the back-to-school week in
  September far more urgently than New Year’s Day as the time of year for a
  behavioural reset. New school year, new me, new cast-iron conviction I can put
  the rocky road on the top shelf after I’ve used it in my girls’ packed lunches
  and not get it down until tomorrow. This is the first and most pressing item
  on the list: diet. Ten days out from Iberico ham night at the all-inclusive
  buffet in Spain, and I’m still more jamón than woman. It wouldn’t have
  mattered 10 years ago. But you can’t stuff your face with cold cuts and eat
  cake for breakfast, lunch and dinner (what? I’d paid for it, am I not going to
  eat it?) in middle age without triggering intense thoughts of death. And so
  this morning, after the drop-off: a return to the thrilling self-denial of two
  slices of misery bread from the health food store (fibre content: dysentery
  level). And a resolve to settle on a stable position re chia seeds, once and
  for all. Also this morning, a cold, critical eye on the house after six weeks
  of people being in it all day. Pressing concerns include working out how to
  empty the chamber in the handheld vacuum and moving the leaning pile of
  clothes by the door to a charity shop – not a risk-free task, by the way.
  Shelter is so fancy these days that, like trying to offload books at Strand
  Books in New York, you suffer the very real possibility of being publicly
  shamed for having your sad castoffs from Primark rejected. On the pile, a
  single, bankable item – a Tory Burch shirt from back when I was trying to be
  someone else and a symbol of the occasional necessity of retiring one’s
  dreams. I will never get around to selling that shirt on Poshmark. I know that
  now. It’s the same every year, this routine. Even though it’s modish these
  days to accept that “resolutions” pinned to a particular time of year don’t
  work, and we’re better off tweaking our general attitude year-round, I won’t
  give up this enjoyable period. I like a few weeks of stern reckoning. At the
  very least, the shortlived gusts of energy that come with them can be enough
  to clean the fridge and figure out where that clicking sound’s been coming
  from. Not the smoke alarm. What remains curious is that the primary impetus
  during these periods tends towards small, trivial home- and diet-related
  chores, never anything big, like that massive deadline for the massive thing
  that’s on my mind and will somehow have to take care of itself. I know this is
  what we call displacement activity; the delusion that, through attention to
  the little things, we can get a better aerial view of What Is Really Going On.
  Which, in my case, for the past three months, has definitely been obscured by
  that pile of clothes by the door. It’s also the case that doing something
  physical but mindless, like wiping and scrubbing or folding and sorting, can
  put you in the slack-line mental state that allows bigger things to jump out.
  And I don’t mind a bit of displacement activity if it delivers the instant
  reward of striking one or two items off the endless mental to-do list. So it
  goes on, Gatsby-style, year after year, as we thrust ourselves forward against
  waves of small obligations. Pay the cats more attention. The business pages:
  like, be more on top of them. Stop playing Block Blast on my phone. Have a
  strong word with myself about my coffee-and-snack spending. And the big one,
  obviously: stop putting rocky road in my children’s lunches and instead, batch
  bake bran muffins stuffed with secret avocado and – maybe? – chia seeds. It
  won’t last, but who cares? In the meantime, I’m happy to be soothed by the
  vague but heartfelt conviction that putting things in Tupperware will save me.
