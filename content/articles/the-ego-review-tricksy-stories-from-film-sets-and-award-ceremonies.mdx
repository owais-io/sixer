  When we arrive, the screen behind the performers is displaying the entry for
  The Ego in the online fringe programme. It has a funny circularity that chimes
  with the self-aware nature of the show. Looking us in the eye, Belgian actors
  Verona Verbakel and Anemone Valcke tell us they are committed to being
  truthful. It is a promise that puts us on alert: do we really believe
  everything they say? How much is artifice? How much constructed? They confess
  to misleading us in one respect. The show is only superficially about egotism.
  There is a nice joke when Verbakel describes The Ego as her show, then
  remembers Valcke and attributes it to both of them. They flatter each other
  and glow with the praise. In their anecdotes from film sets and award
  ceremonies, they present themselves as actors who are hungry for the
  spotlight, insecure about rejection and in need of affirmation. Their ego
  drives their ambition and punishes their failures. But is their ego really
  what makes them feel so vulnerable? Or could it more accurately be their need
  to please in a ruthlessly competitive industry? Could their frustrations stem
  from having to suppress their rage at a post-#MeToo culture in which
  anti-female bias and microaggressions persist? Should a woman expect to be a
  male director’s muse; should she tolerate a male actor’s onstage kisses;
  should she welcome a new age of equality when a gender-blind acting award goes
  only to men? Like several shows at this year’s Edinburgh fringe, The Ego is
  not about the most obvious abuses of male power and perhaps not even about
  behaviour that would meet the legal threshold of discrimination. Rather, it
  reflects a world in which women in their early 30s (they both appeared in
  Sirens by Ontroerend Goed more than 10 years ago) still find themselves
  constrained, moulded and defined by men. Their experiences dent their ego but
  their ego is not to blame. • At Zoo Playground, Edinburgh, until 24 August •
