  The latest inflation figures confirm that the Reserve Bank wrongly kept
  interest rates steady at its meeting earlier this month as the official
  measure of inflation fell to 2.1%, while the monthly indicator dropped outside
  the RBA target band at 1.9%. The one thing you won’t hear from the Reserve
  Bank after the release of the June quarter inflation figures is an apology.
  Because, to give credit to the RBA, in its May statement on monetary policy it
  predicted inflation of 2.1%. That it did predict this inflation and yet still
  kept interest rates steady tells you something about how punishingly timid it
  has been. In June, not only was the official CPI at 2.1%, meaning it has now
  been below 3% for a year, but the core measure of inflation (the trimmed mean)
  fell from 2.9% to 2.7%: If the graph does not display click here Even more
  astonishing is that in a majority of capital cities, inflation is now below 2%
  – yep, below the Reserve Bank’s target range: If the graph does not display
  click here And if you want even more confirmation of just how low inflation is
  at the moment, the monthly measure of inflation – which in November will take
  over as the official measure once a few more items are added – rose just 1.9%:

  Breaking News email It is less good news for the opposition. The shadow
  treasurer, Ted O’Brien, took to the parliament on Monday and told the
  treasurer that “inflation remains too high”. If that is the case then we need
  to change the English language as well as economics to redefine “high”. Even
  when you compare our core inflation with those in other major economies,
  Australia is doing well. If the graph does not display click here Core
  inflation is the measure that the RBA mainly focuses on because it gives a
  less erratic view of what is happening. What it does is top and tail (or
  “trim”) the 15% biggest price rises and falls. This time around, that means,
  for example, the trimmed inflation measure does not include fuel or lamb
  prices which fell the most, and at the other end of the scale it mostly
  ignores the jump in secondary education cost and also electricity prices which
  jumped 8.1% this quarter. The reason electricity jumped was the end of
  state-based subsidies – especially in Western Australia and Queensland. If the
  graph does not display click here The Bureau of Statistics notes that without
  these subsidies electricity prices across Australia would have risen just 0.4%
  in the June quarter. But even still, electricity costs on average 14% less
  than it would without the subsidies. So you can bet the government will be
  very happy it extended its scheme: If the graph does not display click here
  That the RBA did not cut rates earlier this month is even more inexplicable
  when you dig deeper into the figures. The RBA always looks at the price
  increase of services rather than goods, because services are more closely
  linked with wages (because you need workers to do the services). In the year
  to June service prices rose just 3.3% – that is back at the level they rose in
  2011 to 2014 – a period when the RBA cut interest rates eight times: If the
  graph does not display click here And the level of inflation is also very
  broad. The prices of about two-thirds of all items counted in the CPI basket
  rose less than 3% – that’s a very solid level: If the graph does not display
  click here This of course does not mean all things are hunky dory and life is
  a sweet basket of chocolates and strawberries. Pleasingly the prices of
  non-discretionary items – those things we have to buy, such as food, petrol or
  insurance – are now rising the slowest, but there is still a lot of catching
  up to do after the past four years. Since June 2022, which was about the same
  time the RBA began lifting rates, wages have risen 14% – well behind the 22%
  increase in the price of those necessities. That makes for a lot of people
  still feeling worse off than they were then: If the graph does not display
  click here But overall, the story is very good. Inflation should no longer be
  such a concern that the RBA holds off on cutting rates until it gets more
  information. But unemployment is now rising above 4%; when you combine that
  with inflation falling close to 2% that equals an interest cut. And even
  though they won’t, when they do cut in August, the RBA also should apologise
  for making everyone wait six weeks longer than they needed to. Greg Jericho is
