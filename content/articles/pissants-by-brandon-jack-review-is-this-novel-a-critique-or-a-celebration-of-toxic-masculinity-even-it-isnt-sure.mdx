  “Virgil and Homer would recognise these hulking airborne men,” Helen Garner
  wrote of AFL players in her most recent book, The Season. As the celebrated
  author and footy tragic watched her grandson play in an under-16 league, she
  found in the sport “a kind of poetry, an ancient common language between
  strangers, a set of shared hopes and rules and images, of arcane rites played
  out at regular intervals before the citizenry”. Garner has enthusiastically
  blurbed the scabrous debut novel of former AFL player Brandon Jack: Pissants,
  a book mostly dedicated to the arcane rites that play out off the oval –
  preferably as far from the citizenry as possible. Whereas Garner lovingly
  traces the epic dimensions of teenage footy in the suburbs, Jack depicts AFL
  culture as a crucible for addiction, misogyny and brutal conformity. As
  readers of Jack’s 2021 memoir, 28, will know, this novel draws from the well
  of personal experience: much like his characters, Jack spent his early
  adulthood adjacent to AFL stardom, playing 28 senior games for the Sydney
  Swans before being unceremoniously retired. William Burroughs, Irvine Welsh
  and Charles Bukowski are the poets who would recognise Jack’s Pissants, a
  group of players relegated to the fringe of an unnamed footy team, hoping to
  get a game. They cushion themselves against humiliation and ego death in the
  traditional manner: getting wasted, obsessing about their dicks (and everybody
  else’s) and treating women like disposable props. Collateral damage includes a
  dead woman and a dead dog. There’s very little in the way of plot to speak of
  and abundant variations on themes of degradation and anti-authoritarianism.
  Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips
  for the weekend, every Saturday morning We know the Pissants only by their
  nicknames and the brittle stories they tell about themselves. There’s no
  singular noble protagonist on a journey of personal growth or redemption;
  perhaps the stars who kick game-winning goals each week are entitled to an
  individual character arc – but not these guys, whose identities have been
  deformed under the pressure of club culture. If Pissants has an agenda, it
  might be to demonstrate the conditions that produce such obnoxious young men,
  withhold their agency and shield them from the consequences of their
  behaviour. Most of the novel takes the form of interior monologues delivered
  by the various Pissants, interspersed with found texts – Pissant arcana, if
  you like. The players are piss-eloquent narrators: reckless, funny, profane.
  In its best stretches, Pissants is a work of rowdy polyphony; reading it is a
  bit like being on the town with a bunch of big talkers just before things fall
  apart. There’s Fangs, the grandiose ironist; Stick, an arsehole; and Shaggers,
  who is just trying to keep it together. Welsh’s 1993 novel Trainspotting is a
  clear influence on the hectic vernacular mode of Pissants (and respectfully
  invoked through frequent references to suppositories and shitstains). But the
  problem with relying on the interior monologues of desperate, wrecked
  narrators to carry a novel is that – as is the case with so many front bar
  nihilists – things get messy and repetitious. That it’s not all slapstick
  vignettes might be the point here, but even so, the pace of Pissants is slowed
  by tedious disquisitions on such topics as the protocols of Mario Kart. Jack
  recently told Guardian Australia that “there’s no agenda to this book for me”.
  To me, that seems like a bit of a cop-out, because it’s hard not to read
  Pissants and its cast of damaged, charismatic narrators as a compassionate,
  even forgiving account of toxic masculinity. Jack was acclaimed for his
  unflinching self-portraiture in 28. Here, he seems determined to withhold
  judgment on the Pissants and their behaviour and the result is a book that
  cannot decide whether it is a critique or a celebration of the culture it
  observes. Yes, the Pissants are aggressive, entitled gronks who drink each
  other’s urine on the regular, but our attention is always drawn back to their
  charm, their vulnerability and their love of a good laugh. Of course the
  Pissants themselves are largely indifferent to women, being mainly interested
  in each other – but the novel isn’t much interested in them either. The only
  woman with a moderately developed character is Belle Thompson, “the incestual
  sister who everyone messaged on a night out and wanted to fuck after a few
  drinks”. She gets to crack rape jokes, but for some reason she doesn’t get to
  speak for herself. Only the fellas get access to the first person. In the
  periphery hover the silhouettes of other women: nags, sluts, a
  power-suit-wearing AFL executive called Kiwi Kel, an ex-girlfriend or two. One
  Pissant does incur narrative consequences for sexual misconduct right at the
  end of the novel, but that reckoning is a travesty of justice, played for
  shock value. These authorial decisions about how to represent gender and
  gender relations can’t be brushed aside as having “no agenda”. We know that
  footy culture brutalises young men and that it fails to protect young women,
  both in this novel and in Australia in 2025. To be honest, reading Pissants
  has left me a little weary of the poetry of footy. It might be patriarchy that
  silences women and exonerates male violence, but it’s the bloody poets who
  continue to exalt these athletes, who let grace, discipline and ambition serve
  as excuses for each and every transgression. Pissants by Brandon Jack is out
  now (Simon &amp; Schuster, $34.99)
