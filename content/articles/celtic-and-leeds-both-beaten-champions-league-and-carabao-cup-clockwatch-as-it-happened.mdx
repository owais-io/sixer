  And with that the night’s fun is done. And what fun we had, did we not? Same
  place tomorrow? History, meanwhile, is made in the Champions League: Pafos of
  Cyprus edge out Red Star Belgrade/Crvena Zvezda 3-2 on aggregate to make it
  through to face the big boys for the first time, while Bodo/Glimt are in
  similarly uncharted waters after completing a 6-2 aggregate win over Sturm
  Graz, despite losing 2-1 on the night. With that tonight’s Carabao Cup action
  concludes. Your final scores in full: Accrington Stanley 0-2 Doncaster
  Barnsley 2-1 Rotherham Birmingham 0-1 Port Vale Bournemouth 0-2 Brentford
  Bromley 1-1 Wycombe – Wycombe win 5-4 on penalties Burnley 2-1 Derby Burton
  Albion 0-1 Lincoln City Cambridge Utd 3-1 Charlton Cardiff 3-0 Cheltenham
  Millwall 2-1 Coventry Norwich 0-3 Southampton Preston North End 2-3 Wrexham
  Reading 2-1 Wimbledon Sheff Wed 1-1 Leeds - Sheffield Wednesday win 3-0 on
  penalties Stoke 0-3 Bradford Sunderland 1-1 Huddersfield – Huddersfield win
  6-5 on penalties Swansea 1-1 Plymouth – Swansea win 5-3 on penalties Wigan 1-0
  Stockport County Wolverhampton 3-2 West Ham Finally a penalty is missed, and
  that’s the end of Sunderland’s Carabao Cup dreams! After 11 perfect penalties
  Milan Aleksic sends his wide, and Huddersfield are through! It’s sudden death
  penalties at Sunderland, where every one of the first 10 have been converted!
  Longstaff’s penalty is also saved – Leeds fail to convert any of the three
  they took, and Wednesday win the shootout 3-0! Wednesday now 3-0 up! Meanwhile
  at Sunderland there have been seven impeccable spot-kicks and Huddersfield
  lead 4-3. And now Dominic Calvert-Lewin has skied his! Way over the bar it
  goes, and Wednesday lead 2-0 after two penalties each! Leeds’ Joel Piroe has
  seen his penalty saved, so it’s advantage Sheffield Wednesday there – the home
  side have converted their first two. Penalties also incoming at Sunderland,
  whose game against Huddersfield has ended 1-1, and at Sheffield Wednesday,
  whose match against Leeds has finished with the same scoreline. Also going
  through on penalties are Wycombe, after an epic shootout against Bromley. The
  final score is 5-4, after 14 spot-kicks in all, Will Hondermarck with the
  winning effort. Swansea are through! Matthew Sorinola’s penalty miss for
  Plymouth proves decisive as the Swans score all of theirs, making it 5-3 on
  penalties. Here’s a report on Celtic’s Champions League elimination: Some
  mainly final Carabao Cup scores for you now, with two games now heading to
  penalties: Accrington Stanley 0-2 Doncaster Barnsley 2-1 Rotherham Birmingham
  0-1 Port Vale Bournemouth 0-2 Brentford Bromley 1-1 Wycombe – Penalties
  incoming Burnley 2-1 Derby Burton Albion 0-1 Lincoln City Cambridge Utd 3-1
  Charlton Cardiff 3-0 Cheltenham Millwall 2-0 Coventry (8pm) Norwich 0-3
  Southampton Preston North End 2-3 Wrexham Reading 2-1 Wimbledon Sheff Wed 1-0
  Leeds (8pm) Stoke 0-3 Bradford Sunderland 1-1 Huddersfield (still being
  played) Swansea 1-1 Plymouth – Penalties being taken Wigan 1-0 Stockport
  County Wolverhampton 3-2 West Ham A stoppage-time winner (surely) for Burnley!
  Oliver Sonne is played through, running from the right to the left of the
  penalty area, and he passes the ball with his left foot past the keeper and in
  off the post! The lead Derby 2-1 now. Apart from the three games that have
  already finished, and the two later kick-offs at Millwall and Sheffield
  Wednesday, all the other games are in stoppage time now. And there’s been a
  key goal in one of them! Kieffer Moore has headed Wrexham into a 3-2 lead at
  Preston! The game between Sunderland and Huddersfield has been paused because
  of a medical emergency in the stands. It’s 1-1 there, with around four minutes
  still to play. At Molineux, Jarrod Bowen has been pulled away as he headed
  towards the West Ham fans, steam almost visibly emanating from his ears,
  apparently to confront one or more of them. Wolves meanwhile are soaking up
  the fans’ ovation. Sunderland equalise against Huddersfield with six minutes
  to play! Marc Guiu with an excellent header across goal and in at the far
  corner after a cross from the left. It’s 1-1 there now. Boom! Kurya Matsuji
  has scored a fabulous left-footed 30-yard blaster to put Southampton 3-0 up at
  Norwich! Final score: Wolves have beaten West Ham 3-2, coming back from a goal
  down with half an hour to play thanks to a quickfire double from Jorgen Strand
  Larsen. Sheffield Wednesday take the lead in the Yorkshire derby! It’s a bit
  of a goalkeeping howler from Karl Darlow, who saves a shot, pushes it wide to
  his left, but then when the ball is sent low and hard into the box by Jamal
  Lowe he deflects it slowly, agonisingly, over his own goalline! The game at
  Molineux is deep into stoppage time now, Wolves 3-2 up, West Ham throwing
  everything at it. And he’s done it again! It’s a cross from the right, and
  Strand Larsen bullets in a header at the near post. It’s 3-2 now, with six
  minutes to play! Jorgen Strand Larsen, subject of a rapidly-rebuffed £50m bid
  from Newcastle, has equalised for Wolves against West Ham. It’s 2-2 now at
  Molineux. Here’s your might-as-well-do-it-now 9.05pm BST Carabao Cup score
  update! Accrington Stanley 0-0 Doncaster Barnsley 1-1 Rotherham Birmingham 0-1
  Port Vale Bournemouth 0-1 Brentford Bromley 1-1 Wycombe Burnley v Derby Burton
  Albion 0-0 Lincoln City Cambridge Utd 3-1 Charlton (7.30pm) Cardiff 3-0
  Cheltenham Millwall 1-0 Coventry Norwich 0-1 Southampton Preston North End 2-2
  Wrexham Reading 2-1 Wimbledon (final score) Sheff Wed 0-0 Leeds (8pm) Stoke
  0-2 Bradford Sunderland 0-1 Huddersfield Swansea 1-1 Plymouth Wigan 0-0
  Stockport County Wolverhampton 1-2 West Ham (7.30pm) “This has to be rock
  bottom for Celtic, if not all of Scottish football as a proxy,” says Peter
  Mumola. It’s an embarrassing result against an unheralded side, but Kiarat –
  whose players are currently dancing around their dressing-room in front of the
  TV cameras – worked hard, stayed tactically disciplined and got a bit lucky,
  which is the basic blueprint for a cup upset. Final score: Reading 2-1
  Wimbledon, and Reading are going to be in the hat, when the hat sees some
  action tomorrow night. The Celtic captain, Callum McGregor, speaks: We were
  pushing late on to get the goal. A couple of chances in the game but it never
  quite fell. We have to shake this off, there’s another massive game at the
  weekend. We have to get over this disappointment very, very quickly. We know
  what the noise will be. We have to learn from that as well. You see these
  games, you have to make home advantage count. They made it stuffy and credit
  to them, over the two games they defended really well. We had the better
  moments and on another night probably go through, but we have to suck it up
  and get over the disappointment. We are so disappointed, we really wanted
  Champions League football, but it shows you that on any given night you need
  to be at the level. We can still have a good season. The experienced players
  have got a role to play picking everyone up for the weekend. One thing at
  Celtic, we never pass the blame. It’s everyone as a collective. Over the two
  legs we didn’t do enough to hurt them. We’ll get better as the season goes on.
  We can still have a good season, but we need to get over this. Lucas Paqueta
  scores for West Ham, who have come from behind to lead 2-1 at Wolves! Brendan
  Rodgers speaks after Celtic’s Champions League elimination: It was very
  frustrating. It’s bitterly disappointing because we were on the right track
  last season, playing really good football, so to not be in there this season
  is a huge blow for us. We all know the consequence. We want to be in the
  Champions League. We aren’t. The Europa League’s still a prestigious
  tournament, but we missed a massive opportunity in these two games. Scenes in
  Almaty, coach getting the bumps, players on the ground sobbing, the works.
  Meanwhile, many miles away, Tomas Soucek heads in at the back post to equalise
  for West Ham at Wolves. “Nearly three hours of my life I will never get back.
  And at my age that isn’t insignificant,” writes Joe Pearson, after enduring
  the game in full. Daizen Maeda fluffs his penalty, sending it low and down the
  middle, allowing Anarbekov to save with his legs! Kairat have qualified for
  the Champions League! And Celtic, well, haven’t! Another great penalty! Egor
  Sorokin finds the top corner, and Celtic now must score their fifth, after
  which Kairat must not! Ofri Arad makes it 2-1 with a beautiful penalty, high
  down the middle. Then Callum McGregor thumps his in too. 2-2, but Kairat have
  two still to take. Arne Engels sends the keeper one way with a little stutter,
  and the ball the other. It’s 1-1 now! Aleksandr Martynovich, on his 38th
  birthday, has actually scored a penalty! It’s Kairat 1-0 Celtic after two
  spot-kicks each. Unbelievable scenes! Three penalties taken, not a single one
  converted!. Luke McCowan’s penalty is poor, neither hard enough nor well
  directed enough to beat the keeper if he went the right way. Which he did. And
  still! Valeri Gromyko tries a Panenka, Schmeichel dives out of the way, and
  the ball loops into the crossbar! One penalty each, still 0-0! And it’s saved!
  Still nobody can find the net here! OK, then. Penalties. Celtic’s Adam Idah
  will take the first … Fabio Carvalho puts Brentford 1-0 up at Bournemouth! It
  was a simple header down and into the area, which at least three defenders
  were much closer to than Carvalho, but perhaps they assumed the keeper would
  come for it, or maybe that just didn’t notice Carvalho sprinting past them,
  but it ended up with an easy finish. Talking of penalties, there are several
  of those coming up in Almaty after the inevitable goalless draw between Kairat
  and Celtic limped to a conclusion. Wolves have missed a penalty but scored a
  rebound, Hwang Hee-chan thumping his spot-kick into the base of the post but
  Rodrigo Gomes snaffling the follow-up. Zan Vipotnik has thundered a 25-yarder
  into the top corner to put Swansea a goal up at home to Plymouth. Some
  cracking goals in the League Cup already, almost enough to make up for the
  Almaty aberration. Another excellent chance for Celtic, but Nygren’s effort is
  turned round the post! Then the corner is cleared to the edge of the area,
  Nygren has another shot, and this is also turned round the post. Cambridge
  United lead Charlton by two goals to no goals now, Kylian Kouassi scoring on
  his full debut after signing on loan from Blackpool, taking his time after the
  nearest defender helpfully fell over and finding the bottom corner. Half time
  in extra time in Almaty and it’s still Kairat 0-0 Celtic. Ryan Hardie has
  scored an absolute beauty to equalise for Wrexham at Preston! There’s some
  debate on Sky about whether he actually intended that to be a cross, but it
  looked like a shot to me. Huddersfield take the lead at Sunderland! A corner
  from the right is headed out to the edge of the area, where Leo Castledine
  runs in to blast it into the roof of the net! Most Carabao Cup ties have
  started, and goals are already flying in. Preston’s Lewis Dobbin has scored a
  very nice goal to put them 1-0 up against Wrexham, while Aaron Ramsey has
  given Burnley the lead against Derby. Another chance for Celtic! This time a
  pull-back from the left runs to Reo Hatate, but he, stretching and also
  falling, shoots into a defender. Meanwhile in the early Carabao Cup kick-off
  there have already been two goals: Reading and AFC Wimbledon are tied at 1-1,
  with Liam Fraser opening the scoring for the Royals in the 24th minute and
  Omar Bugiel equalising two minutes later. Nobody scored in stoppage time.
  Another half an hour will have to be endured as a result. Maybe just two
  interesting things that coincidentally happened quite close together. Anyway,
  four minutes of stoppage time await. And at the other end, Arad’s header from
  a free-kick is turned round the post by Schmeichel. Interesting things
  starting to happen! An amazing chance for Celtic! Daizen Maeda is played
  through, scampers clear, has only the goalkeeper to beat, and sends his shot
  over the bar while falling over! Five minutes to play, which brings the
  exciting possibility of tiring players making a game-changing mistake. They
  have not yet done so. Now 75 minutes have been played, and the award of a
  free-kick remains the most exciting thing to have happened in them. Good or
  bad news, depending on your outlook: for a while readers were
  excited/perturbed/confused to find that this liveblog appeared to be covering
  a Champions League game between Sheffield Wednesday and Leeds, and now it does
  not. As my colleague Alex Reid points out: “Leeds vs Sheffield Wednesday in
  the Champions League is something you get on your 200th season of Football
  Manager.” While you wait for something interesting to happen in this game,
  here’s some Alexander Isak news. The news being, nothing has changed – he
  still wants out. No penalty is given! The ball definitely hit Maeda’s hands,
  but they were in front of his body so if he hadn’t handled it the shot would
  have been blocked anyway. But he did handle it. One of those that would have
  been a pathetically feeble penalty to give someone, but a defending team is
  still lucky to get away with. Jorginho’s shot deflects to safety off a
  defender. A couple of Kairat players think it’s a handball, but the referee
  doesn’t give anything. Will VAR intervene? I don’t know why teams touch these
  free-kicks to the taker, allowing the defenders amassed on the goalline to
  launch themselves at it. Just welly it goalwards and hope it goes in off
  somebody, surely? An interesting thing! McGregor’s back-pass bounces over
  Schmeichel’s head, and forces the keeper to use his hand to stop it crossing
  the line. Kairat will therefore have an indirect free-kick on the six-yard
  line. The players are back out for the second half. No substitutions have been
  made. Joe Pearson has filed a half-time match report: “As a retired football
  fan in central Indiana, I always enjoy the opportunity to watch an early
  afternoon weekday match,” he enthuses. “But. This match is dire. I feel I have
  made a bad life choice.” Still no sign of a goal in this tie, but the two
  teams now have 15 minutes to come up with a plan to create one. There will be
  one minute of first-half stoppage time. That Forrest header remains the only
  effort on target. You may be wondering what exactly happens if this tie
  remains level on aggregate at the end of this second leg. And I have an
  answer! It follows the Champions League knockout system, so is exactly the
  same in format as the knockout matches at the sharp end of the competition
  will be come next April and May. Here’s the relevant bit of the tournament
  regulations: Article 21 Knockout system, extra time and penalty shoot-outs
  21.01 For matches played under the knockout system, if the two teams involved
  in a tie score the same number of goals over the two legs, two 15-minute
  periods of extra time are played at the end of the second leg. The team that
  scores more goals during extra time qualifies for the next stage. If both
  teams score the same number of goals or no goals are scored during extra time,
  a penalty shoot-out determines which team qualifies for the next stage. 21.02
  If extra time is required, there is a five-minute break between the end of
  normal time and the start of extra time. As a rule, the players remain on the
  field of play during this five-minute break, at the discretion of the referee.
  21.03 Penalties are taken in accordance with the procedure laid down in the
  IFAB Laws of the Game. The game has developed into something more interesting,
  a little more plump with potential. By which I mean, the ball is spending much
  more time in the vicinity of penalty areas than it did in the opening 20
  minutes. Celtic are currently preparing to send it into one of them, from a
  free-kick on the right. And one for Celtic moments later! Hatate crosses,
  Forrest heads goalwards, and Anarbekov turns over the bar! It was a good
  header, plenty of power on it, but right down the middle of goal and the
  keeper only needed to fling up a hand. Chance for Kairat! But Schmeichel
  saves! And Ricardinho is miles offside anyway! This game has not been hugely
  intense so far. Kairat just worked a decent crossing chance on the right, but
  Tapalov did not produce a decent cross. The Celtic game has started, and after
  seven minutes the score remains very much 0-0 (Kairat have had the only shot
  so far, not on target). The teams look something like this: Kairat Almaty:
  Anarbekov, Mrynskiy, Sorokin, Martynovich, Mata, Glazer, Tapalov, Arad,
  Gromyko, Jorginho, Ricardinho. Subs: Kalmurza, Kasabulat, Kurgin, Sadybekov,
  Baybek, Shirobokov, Stanojev, Gadrani, Bekbolat, Tuyakbayev, Bagdat, Reimov.
  Celtic: Schmeichel, Ralston, Carter-Vickers, Scales, Tierney, Nygren,
  McGregor, Hatate, Yang, Maeda, Forrest. Subs: Sinisalo, Doohan, Simpson-Pusey,
  Idah, McCowan, Yamada, Osmand, Kenny, Engels, Bernardo, Murray, Donovan.
  Referee: Maurizio Mariani (Italy). And so another day draws towards a close.
  Here’s a little summary of what this fine August Tuesday has brought us so
  far: 1) The Manchester United badnewsometer has swung once again towards 11,
  what with this: And also this: With a side order of this: 2) A bit more
  transfer news courtesy of Jacob Steinberg, who says West Ham are hunting
  Monaco’s 21-year-old midfielder Soungoutou Magassa. 3) That Rio Ngumoha is a
  bit special is he not? 4) David Squires has had his pencil set out again: 5)
  Max Rushden has guided the Football Weekly panel through a breathless, hugely
  entertaining and sometimes bizarre discussion of a breathless, hugely
  entertaining and sometimes bizarre football match, and the result is here: And
  now, on with the evening! We’ve got three Champions League play-off fixtures
  to look forward to tonight, being as follows: ***Potential humiliation
  klaxon*** Kairat v Celtic (1st leg score 0-0, 5.45pm BST kick-off) Pafos v Red
  Star Belgrade (2-1, 8pm) Sturm Graz v Bodo/Glimt (0-5, 8pm) And also a bumper
  19 Carabao Cup games (7.45pm BST kick-off unless stated): Accrington Stanley v
  Doncaster Barnsley v Rotherham Birmingham v Port Vale Bournemouth v Brentford
  Bromley v Wycombe Burnley v Derby Cambridge Utd v Charlton (7.30pm) Cardiff v
  Cheltenham Millwall v Coventry Norwich v Southampton Preston North End v
  Wrexham Reading v Wimbledon (7pm) Sheff Wed v Leeds (8pm) Stoke v Bradford
  Sunderland v Huddersfield Swansea v Plymouth Wigan v Stockport County
  Wolverhampton v West Ham (7.30pm) Burton Albion v Lincoln City There are also
  some Scottish Challenge Cup games, one FA Cup preliminary round replay, and
  the potential for other unscripted excitement. Strap yourselves in, it’s going
  to be a cracker*! * cracker not guaranteed. Your statutory rights are
  unaffected

And with that the night’s fun is done. And what fun we had, did we not? Same place tomorrow?

Wolves have missed a penalty but scored a rebound, Hwang Hee-chan thumping his spot-kick into the base of the post but Rodrigo Gomes snaffling the follow-up. Zan Vipotnik has thundered a 25-yarder into the top corner to put Swansea a goal up at home to Plymouth. Some cracking goals in the League Cup already, almost enough to make up for the Almaty aberration. Another excellent chance for Celtic, but Nygren’s effort is turned round the post! Then the corner is cleared to the edge of the area, Nygren has another shot, and this is also turned round the post. Cambridge United lead Charlton by two goals to no goals now, Kylian Kouassi scoring on his full debut after signing on loan from Blackpool, taking his time after the nearest defender helpfully fell over and finding the bottom corner. Half time in extra time in Almaty and it’s still Kairat 0-0 Celtic. Ryan Hardie has scored an absolute beauty to equalise for Wrexham at Preston! There’s some debate on Sky about whether he actually intended that to be a cross, but it looked like a shot to me. Huddersfield take the lead at Sunderland! A corner from the right is headed out to the edge of the area, where Leo Castledine runs in to blast it into the roof of the net! Most Carabao Cup ties have started, and goals are already flying in. Preston’s Lewis Dobbin has scored a very nice goal to put them 1-0 up against Wrexham, while Aaron Ramsey has given Burnley the lead against Derby. Another chance for Celtic! This time a pull-back from the left runs to Reo Hatate, but he, stretching and also falling, shoots into a defender. Meanwhile in the early Carabao Cup kick-off there have already been two goals: Reading and AFC Wimbledon are tied at 1-1, with Liam Fraser opening the scoring for the Royals in the 24th minute and Omar Bugiel equalising two minutes later. Nobody scored in stoppage time. Another half an hour will have to be endured as a result. Maybe just two interesting things that coincidentally happened quite close together. Anyway, four minutes of stoppage time await. And at the other end, Arad’s header from a free-kick is turned round the post by Schmeichel. Interesting things starting to happen! An amazing chance for Celtic! Daizen Maeda is played through, scampers clear, has only the goalkeeper to beat, and sends his shot over the bar while falling over! Five minutes to play, which brings the exciting possibility of tiring players making a game-changing mistake. They have not yet done so. Now 75 minutes have been played, and the award of a free-kick remains the most exciting thing to have happened in them. Good or bad news, depending on your outlook: for a while readers were excited/perturbed/confused to find that this liveblog appeared to be covering a Champions League game between Sheffield Wednesday and Leeds, and now it does not. As my colleague Alex Reid points out: “Leeds vs Sheffield Wednesday in the Champions League is something you get on your 200th season of Football Manager.” While you wait for something interesting to happen in this game, here’s some Alexander Isak news. The news being, nothing has changed – he still wants out. No penalty is given! The ball definitely hit Maeda’s hands, but they were in front of his body so if he hadn’t handled it the shot would have been blocked anyway. But he did handle it. One of those that would have been a pathetically feeble penalty to give someone, but a defending team is still lucky to get away with. Jorginho’s shot deflects to safety off a defender. A couple of Kairat players think it’s a handball, but the referee doesn’t give anything. Will VAR intervene? I don’t know why teams touch these free-kicks to the taker, allowing the defenders amassed on the goalline to launch themselves at it. Just welly it goalwards and hope it goes in off somebody, surely? An interesting thing! McGregor’s back-pass bounces over Schmeichel’s head, and forces the keeper to use his hand to stop it crossing the line. Kairat will therefore have an indirect free-kick on the six-yard line. The players are back out for the second half. No substitutions have been made. Joe Pearson has filed a half-time match report: “As a retired football fan in central Indiana, I always enjoy the opportunity to watch an early afternoon weekday match,” he enthuses. “But. This match is dire. I feel I have made a bad life choice.” Still no sign of a goal in this tie, but the two teams now have 15 minutes to come up with a plan to create one. There will be one minute of first-half stoppage time. That Forrest header remains the only effort on target. You may be wondering what exactly happens if this tie remains level on aggregate at the end of this second leg. And I have an answer! It follows the Champions League knockout system, so is exactly the same in format as the knockout matches at the sharp end of the competition will be come next April and May. Here’s the relevant bit of the tournament regulations: Article 21 Knockout system, extra time and penalty shoot-outs 21.01 For matches played under the knockout system, if the two teams involved in a tie score the same number of goals over the two legs, two 15-minute periods of extra time are played at the end of the second leg. The team that scores more goals during extra time qualifies for the next stage. If both teams score the same number of goals or no goals are scored during extra time, a penalty shoot-out determines which team qualifies for the next stage. 21.02 If extra time is required, there is a five-minute break between the end of normal time and the start of extra time. As a rule, the players remain on the field of play during this five-minute break, at the discretion of the referee. 21.03 Penalties are taken in accordance with the procedure laid down in the IFAB Laws of the Game. The game has developed into something more interesting, a little more plump with potential. By which I mean, the ball is spending much more time in the vicinity of penalty areas than it did in the opening 20 minutes. Celtic are currently preparing to send it into one of them, from a free-kick on the right. And one for Celtic moments later! Hatate crosses, Forrest heads goalwards, and Anarbekov turns over the bar! It was a good header, plenty of power on it, but right down the middle of goal and the keeper only needed to fling up a hand. Chance for Kairat! But Schmeichel saves! And Ricardinho is miles offside anyway! This game has not been hugely intense so far. Kairat just worked a decent crossing chance on the right, but Tapalov did not produce a decent cross. The Celtic game has started, and after seven minutes the score remains very much 0-0 (Kairat have had the only shot so far, not on target). The teams look something like this: Kairat Almaty: Anarbekov, Mrynskiy, Sorokin, Martynovich, Mata, Glazer, Tapalov, Arad, Gromyko, Jorginho, Ricardinho. Subs: Kalmurza, Kasabulat, Kurgin, Sadybekov, Baybek, Shirobokov, Stanojev, Gadrani, Bekbolat, Tuyakbayev, Bagdat, Reimov. Celtic: Schmeichel, Ralston, Carter-Vickers, Scales, Tierney, Nygren, McGregor, Hatate, Yang, Maeda, Forrest. Subs: Sinisalo, Doohan, Simpson-Pusey, Idah, McCowan, Yamada, Osmand, Kenny, Engels, Bernardo, Murray, Donovan. Referee: Maurizio Mariani (Italy). And so another day draws towards a close. Here’s a little summary of what this fine August Tuesday has brought us so far: 1) The Manchester United badnewsometer has swung once again towards 11, what with this: And also this: With a side order of this: 2) A bit more transfer news courtesy of Jacob Steinberg, who says West Ham are hunting Monaco’s 21-year-old midfielder Soungoutou Magassa. 3) That Rio Ngumoha is a bit special is he not? 4) David Squires has had his pencil set out again: 5) Max Rushden has guided the Football Weekly panel through a breathless, hugely entertaining and sometimes bizarre discussion of a breathless, hugely entertaining and sometimes bizarre football match, and the result is here: And now, on with the evening! We’ve got three Champions League play-off fixtures to look forward to tonight, being as follows: ***Potential humiliation klaxon*** Kairat v Celtic (1st leg score 0-0, 5.45pm BST kick-off) Pafos v Red Star Belgrade (2-1, 8pm) Sturm Graz v Bodo/Glimt (0-5, 8pm) And also a bumper 19 Carabao Cup games (7.45pm BST kick-off unless stated): Accrington Stanley v Doncaster Barnsley v Rotherham Birmingham v Port Vale Bournemouth v Brentford Bromley v Wycombe Burnley v Derby Cambridge Utd v Charlton (7.30pm) Cardiff v Cheltenham Millwall v Coventry Norwich v Southampton Preston North End v Wrexham Reading v Wimbledon (7pm) Sheff Wed v Leeds (8pm) Stoke v Bradford Sunderland v Huddersfield Swansea v Plymouth Wigan v Stockport County Wolverhampton v West Ham (7.30pm) Burton Albion v Lincoln City There are also some Scottish Challenge Cup games, one FA Cup preliminary round replay, and the potential for other unscripted excitement.
