  Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has thanked those working for
  Ukrainian security and developing its aviation in a post to mark Aviation Day.
  Every year on the last Saturday of August, Ukraine celebrates Aviation Day, a
  holiday to honour military and civilian pilots and aviation industry workers.
  In a post on X, Zelenskyy wote: Aviation Day. A day to honor those for whom
  the skies became their workplace, their dream, and their true calling.
  Military and civilian. Pilots, crews, engineers, designers, air traffic
  controllers, technicians – each of you is doing a tremendous job for Ukraine.
  Our sky is under your protection. I thank everyone who works for our security,
  for Ukraine’s strength in the air, and to all those developing our aviation.
  We will certainly do everything to ensure that Ukraine’s sky is peaceful and
  safe. Happy Aviation Day of Ukraine! Here are some images coming in via the
  newswires of Zaporizhzhia: Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un are among the world
  leaders who will attend a military parade with President Xi Jinping in Beijing
  next week, in a show of collective defiance amid western pressure. No western
  leaders will be among the 26 foreign heads of state and government attending
  the parade next week – with the exception of Robert Fico, prime minister of
  Slovakia, a member of the European Union – according to the Chinese foreign
  ministry. Against the backdrop of China’s growing military might during the
  Victory Day parade on 3 September, the three leaders will project a major show
  of solidarity. Russia, which Beijing counts as a strategic partner, has been
  battered by multiple rounds of western sanctions imposed after its invasion of
  Ukraine in 2022, with its economy on the brink of slipping into recession.
  Putin, wanted by the international criminal court, last travelled in China in
  2024. North Korea, a formal treaty ally of China’s, has been under UN security
  council sanctions since 2006 over its development of nuclear weapons and
  ballistic missiles. Kim last visited China in January 2019. Those attending
  the parade marking the formal surrender of Japan during the second world war
  will include Belarus president Aleksandr Lukashenko, Iran’s president Masoud
  Pezashkian, Indonesian president Prabowo Subianto and South Korea’s National
  Assembly speaker Woo Won-shik, said Chinese assistant foreign minister Hong
  Lei at a news conference. Serbia’s president Aleksandar Vucic will also attend
  the parade. The United Nations will be represented by under secretary general
  Li Junhua, who previously served in various capacities at the Chinese foreign
  ministry, including time as the Chinese ambassador to Italy, San Marino and
  Myanmar. The Russian defence ministry said it had shot down 20 Ukrainian
  drones, including 18 over Moscow-annexed Crimea, between 4am and 8am GMT on
  Saturday, reports Reuters. The other two drones were shot down over Russia’s
  western Smolensk region. In an earlier statement, Russia’s defence ministry
  said it had destroyed 86 Ukrainian drones overnight into Saturday. Reuters
  could not independently confirm the reports. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un
  met the families of soldiers killed fighting for Russia against Ukraine and
  offered condolences for their “unbearable pain”, state media said on Saturday,
  according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). Pyongyang has not confirmed the
  number of its soldiers that died fighting for Russia, though Seoul estimates
  it is about 600, with thousands more wounded. South Korean and western
  intelligence agencies have said North Korea sent more than 10,000 soldiers to
  Russia in 2024 – primarily to the Kursk region – along with artillery shells,
  missiles and long-range rocket systems. Kim gave a speech to the families on
  Friday, the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported, after meeting
  only some of them last week at another public ceremony awarding honors to the
  soldiers. According to KCNA, Kim said in his speech: I thought a lot about
  other martyrs’ families who were not present there. So, I had this meeting
  arranged as I wanted to meet and console the bereaved families of all the
  heroes and relieve them of their sorrow and anguish even a little. He pledged
  to erect a monument in the capital as well as a new street for the bereaved
  families, while the state would give full support to the troop’s children. He
  said: My heart breaks and aches more at the sight of those little children. I,
  our state and our army will take full responsibility for them and train them
  admirably as staunch and courageous fighters like their fathers. North Korea
  only confirmed it had deployed troops to support Russia’s war in Ukraine in
  April and admitted that its soldiers had been killed in combat. Regional
  governor Ivan Fedorov said that three children were among the 24 injured in
  the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia after a Russian attack (see 8.59am
  BST). He confirmed that one person had been killed. The Ukrainian air force
  recorded five missile and 24 drone hits at seven locations with debris falling
  on 21 sites, according to the statement on the Telegram messaging app, reports
  Reuters. The attack on Zaporizhzhia cut power to 25,000 residents, Fedorov
  said. The local energy facility said the attack damaged its equipment and that
  repairs were under way. As of early Saturday, Ukrainian state-owned railway
  Ukrzaliznytsia said it had repaired the damage to its infrastructure in the
  Kyiv region. Ukrainian military said on Saturday that it had struck Russian
  oil refineries in Krasnodar and Syzran overnight. Kyiv’s military recorded
  multiple explosions and a fire at the Krasnodar oil refinery in Russia’s
  south, which produces 3m tonnes of light petroleum products annually, reports
  Reuters. Russian authorities in Krasnodar said falling drone debris damaged
  one of the refinery’s units and a fire had broken out over an area measuring
  300 square metres (3,230 square feet). That fire was later extinguished,
  authorities said. There were no casualties, and employees were evacuated,
  authorities wrote on Telegram. Russia’s defence ministry said it had downed 11
  Ukrainian drones over the Krasnodar region overnight. There was also a fire in
  the Syzran oil refinery area in Samara region, which had a processing capacity
  of 8.5m tonnes per year before August, the Ukrainian military said. Samara’s
  regional governor confirmed an attempt overnight to attack an industrial
  enterprise, but gave no further details. One person has died and dozens have
  been injured, including children, in Zaporizhzhia after a reported Russian
  strike on a five-story residential building, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy said on Saturday morning. “All emergency services are engaged at the
  site,” said Zelenskyy. He added that Volyn, Dnipro, Donetsk, Zhytomyr,
  Zaporizhzhia, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kyiv, Rivne, Sumy, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi,
  Cherkasy, Chernivtsi and Chernihiv regions were all affected by the attack.
  “Numerous fires broke out, and civilian infrastructure – homes and businesses
  – suffered the most damage,” he said. According to Zelenskyy, Russia launched
  “nearly 540 drones, 8 ballistic missiles, and 37 other types of missiles
  against civilian life”. In a social media post on X, Zelenskyy wrote: We saw
  the world’s response to the previous strike. But now, as Russia once again
  shows its utter disregard for words, we count on real action. It is absolutely
  clear that Moscow used the time meant for preparing a leaders-level meeting to
  organise new massive attacks. The only way to reopen a window of opportunity
  for diplomacy is through tough measures against all those bankrolling the
  Russian army and effective sanctions against Moscow itself – banking and
  energy sanctions. This war won’t stop with political statements alone; real
  steps are needed. We expect action from the US, Europe, and the entire world.
  In other developments: Vladimir Putin will travel to China this weekend for
  what the Kremlin has called a “truly unprecedented” visit to his most
  important ally, which comes at a crunch moment in talks over Ukraine.
  Ukraine’s central Dnipropetrovsk region came under a “massive attack” early on
  Saturday, the region’s governor said, reporting strikes in Dnipro and
  Pavlograd. “The region is under a massive attack. Explosions are being heard,”
  Sergiy Lysak wrote on Telegram, warning residents to take cover. He said
  overnight Russian strikes killed two people in Dnipropetrovsk, which had been
  largely spared from intense fighting since Russia’s 2022 invasion. Kyiv
  acknowledged on Tuesday that Russian troops had entered the region. The French
  president, Emmanuel Macron, has warned that Donald Trump risked being “played”
  by Putin if a Russia-Ukraine peace summit did not go ahead. Macron expressed
  hope that the two-way meeting would take place but warned if Russia did not
  meet a Monday deadline to agree to the talks, “it will show again President
  Putin has played President Trump”. Zelenskyy said he expected to continue
  talks with European leaders next week on “Nato-like” commitments to protect
  Ukraine, adding that Trump should also be involved. “We need the architecture
  to be clear to everyone,” he said, adding that he wanted to tell Trump “how we
  see it”. EU defence ministers meeting in Copenhagen on Friday expressed “broad
  support” for expanding the bloc’s military training mission to operate inside
  Ukraine, the EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said. “The EU has already trained
  over 80,000 Ukrainian soldiers,” Kallas wrote on X. “We must be ready to do
  more.”
