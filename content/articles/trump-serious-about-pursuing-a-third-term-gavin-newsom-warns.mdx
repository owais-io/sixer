  Donald Trump is gravely serious about running for a third term in violation of
  the US constitution, California governor Gavin Newsom said on Wednesday,
  warning Americans to “wake up” to what he described as the president’s
  flagrant disregard for democratic norms. “I don’t think Donald Trump wants
  another election,” Newsom, a Democrat, said during a live interview at a
  summit hosted by Politico in Sacramento. “This guy doesn’t believe in free,
  fair elections.” Newsom, who has gained national attention in recent weeks for
  his merciless trolling of Trump online and who is widely considered a
  presidential contender, said he had a stack of two dozen “Trump 2028” hats
  sent to him by the president’s supporters. “You think he’s joking about 2028?”
  Newsom asked the audience. Noting Trump’s ambitious – and controversial –
  plans to build a 90,000-square-foot state ballroom off the East Wing of the
  White House, replete with gold trim that echoes the one he built at his
  Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Newsom remarked: “Who spends $200m on a ballroom
  at their home and then leaves the house?” “The rule of law is being replaced
  by the rule of Don,” Newsom declared. The governor has previously warned that
  Trump would attempt to cling to power beyond his term, as he did in 2020, when
  he sought to overturn Joe Biden’s victory with baseless claims of election
  fraud – a campaign that culminated in the January 6 attack on the Capitol by
  his supporters attempting to halt the certification of the results. But on
  Wednesday, he added a new data point to his case, revealing that Trump had
  raised the subject during a 90-minute Oval Office meeting in February, when
  the governor had traveled to Washington to push for federal disaster aid that
  the newly inaugurated president had threatened to withhold after deadly
  wildfires in Los Angeles. According to Newsom, Trump pointed to a portrait of
  Franklin D Roosevelt, the only US president who served more than two terms in
  office. “I said, ‘I know exactly what you mean,’” Newsom said. “And then he
  went on and on about the third term.” It is unusual for a political leader,
  especially a sitting governor, to divulge details of an Oval Office exchange
  with the president. But Newsom appeared unfazed by the breach of protocol.
  “Apparently there are no rules any more,” he said. Pressed on what else was
  discussed, he said the conversation also touched on what he described as the
  president’s “crypto grift” drawing the observation from Trump that a “meme
  coin” was “not even a coin”. Though Trump has said he would be an “eight-year
  president” – and is barred by the constitution from serving a third-term – he
  has repeatedly entertained the possibility in public. Citing Roosevelt’s four
  election wins as a precedent, Trump has suggested that there may be ways to
  circumvent the 22nd amendment – adopted after Roosevelt’s election to a fourth
  term – that states: “No person shall be elected to the office of the president
  more than twice.” Asked earlier this month whether he would run again, Trump
  said “no, probably not.” But then he added: “I’d like to run. I have the best
  poll numbers I’ve ever had.” During the interview, Newsom implored Democrats
  to stand up and “fight fire with fire” as he was doing in California with a
  redistricting proposal that would offset a Trump-sought gerrymander to secure
  five more Republican seats in Texas. Californians will vote in November on
  whether to temporarily override the state’s independent redistricting
  commission and adopt new congressional maps that would give Democrats more of
  an advantage in five Republican-held US House districts. Newsom’s more
  combative posture – especially his online mockery of Trump and his Republican
  allies – has seemed to strike a nerve. This week, Trump fired back, calling
  the California governor a “nice guy” who “looks good” but who was also
  “incompetent”. Newsom on Wednesday implored Americans to take Trump’s threats
  seriously. “Wake up,” he said. “We’re losing this country in real time. This
  is not bloviation, this is not exaggeration.”
