  Some philosophers find inspiration in mountains, such as Nietzsche, and some
  in caves, like Plato. Clare Carlisle found hers in a cave halfway up a
  mountain. It happened 20 years ago: walking on a Himalayan path, she met a
  holy man who lived in a cave nearby. Not your stereotypical sadhu, he didn’t
  have matted hair and wasn’t semi-naked but wore nice trousers and an acrylic
  pullover. Nor did he have any obvious wisdom to impart; at the last of their
  three meetings, he and Carlisle mainly got stoned and giggled about the
  chicken-like patterns on a cushion she had brought him as a gift. Yet, after
  leaving, she felt a “yearning” for something that they had shared: a sense
  that there could be a more “noble” way of living, or that we could experience
  “transcendence”, a higher perspective on life. Carlisle went on to have an
  eminent career as a philosophy professor and the acclaimed biographer of Søren
  Kierkegaard and George Eliot. The holy man receded from her mind until she was
  invited to give the 2024 Gifford Lectures, a venerable series dedicated to the
  theme of “natural theology”. She decided to make the encounter her starting
  point for the six talks, and now for these six interlinked essays based on
  them. The opening essay sets the scene by telling the Himalayan story, while
  the remaining five lead us onward and upward. The most interesting step comes
  in the second essay, in which Carlisle uses her own experience of writing
  biography to point out a dramatic difference in two ways of thinking about
  human lives. While we are living our own life, it is a flowing, varied and
  incomplete thing. We are immersed in it, as if in a river. New experiences
  flood in on us or rain down like a “shower of atoms”, as Virginia Woolf wrote.
  But we cannot generally step out of the temporal flow to get a more elevated
  view of the entire shape and meaning of our experience. For a biographer
  writing about someone in the past, however, everything shifts. The life is
  completed and you are outside it. The details may be less rich than they were
  to the living person but the view over it is better. You can float up, as it
  were, to see what shape the person’s time-flow formed, as when a satellite
  picture shows the full course of a river. Liberated from time, you can see the
  life “under the aspect of eternity”, to borrow Spinoza’s phrase. Carlisle
  illustrates the difference with a children’s fable told in Karen Blixen’s Out
  of Africa. In brief: a man stumbles around in the mud for a while in the
  middle of the night. He loses his way, changes direction and trips over a few
  things before going back to bed. Only when he wakes up and sees the scene by
  daylight does he realise that his footprints have traced out a perfect picture
  of a stork. The point is that, by living, we create a meaningful picture
  without knowing it – unless we attain some inkling of that wider view through
  art or mysticism. This idea that we “manifest” something in life is explored
  through the rest of the book. Each essay leads us further up into the
  conceptual clouds and closer to the idea of transcendence. The Milieu looks at
  the various wider contexts a life can have – historical or social, for
  example. Incarnations examines spiritual possibilities as embodied by
  individuals. Arunachala partly concerns another cave-dwelling sage, Ramana
  Maharshi, who got over a personal fear of death to become a mystic and
  teacher. The final chapter, Transcendence for Beginners, ties it all together,
  asking whether we can have access to a noble or radiant realm while still in
  the midst of life. By this time, we have climbed quite a mountain of
  ineffability, but Carlisle has led us so gently step by step that we are
  willing to follow. Like William James – an earlier Gifford lecturer also
  fascinated by experiences that are hard to describe – she combines close
  readings of texts (notably those of Spinoza, Eliot and Proust) with examples
  from her own life. Sometimes, the citations fly past too quickly, but her
  extended analyses are both touching and enlightening: I especially liked her
  reading of Eliot’s Daniel Deronda and passages on the artist Celia Paul.
  Having arrived at the ending, we look back to see that we have traversed
  territory that is not completely religious but is not merely aesthetic or
  literary or psychological either. Like the man in Blixen’s fable, we see a
  picture traced by our steps, but I suspect it may vary for each reader, and
  even for the same reader at different times and in different moods. This is to
  Carlisle’s credit: we can make our own shape out of her words because she is
  never dogmatic and because she is clearly on an open-ended quest herself. All
  possibilities remain alive in this subtle, generous and humane book. •
