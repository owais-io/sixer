  Caught Stealing review – Darren Aronofsky’s violent, chaotic and highly
  enjoyable crime flick

  Baseball fans will see the pun straight away; I had to look it up. The
  non-batting runner, having only made it a certain way around the field, gets
  tagged out by a fielder trying to “steal”, or sneak up, on a base from the one
  behind. As far as the non-metaphorical meaning goes, no one in this movie is
  actually apprehended in the act of theft. But in a world where home runs are
  unavailable to most, the idea of cheekily trying for covert advantage and
  survival through quick wits is clear. Charlie Huston’s violent crime novel of
  the same name from 2004 has been adapted for the screen by the author, and
  Darren Aronofsky directs with gleeful energy, flair and a dark humour that
  straddles the mischief/malice borderline. Incredible to think that his last
  film was the solemn and inertly sententious body-image drama The Whale. This
  has more of the confrontational extravagance and energy of his earlier work;
  it’s not as purely deranged as Aronofsky’s meltdown film Mother!, although,
  speaking of mothers, there is no doubt who the hero of this film considers to
  be his best friend. Austin Butler plays Hank, a former baseball star and
  booze-addicted bartender in New York whose disastrous exit from the sport –
  and from his own bright future – is progressively disclosed in nightmare
  flashbacks. The only good thing in his life is his smart, beautiful girlfriend
  Yvonne, played by Zoë Kravitz, a paramedic whose professional skills come in
  useful. When Hank good-naturedly agrees to look after a cat belonging to his
  dodgy British friend Russ (a very broad, mohawk-sporting performance from Matt
  Smith), poor Hank winds up getting savagely beaten by some scary Russians to
  whom Russ owes a great deal of money. The assault has serious consequences,
  not least Hank’s encounter with two other villains: a pair of Hassidic guys
  (played by Vincent D’Onofrio and Liev Schreiber). Their kindly mother Bubbe,
  played by Carol Kane, sagely tells Hank not to show his teeth if he isn’t
  going to bite. Most importantly, Hank comes into contact with a coolly
  self-possessed New York police officer, played by Regina King, who is airily
  insensitive about what Hank is going through, but perceptive about him in ways
  that no other character really is. When talking to (or interrogating) Hank,
  she asks if he played baseball; Hank coldly admits to playing only at high
  school level, and this cop instantly senses the lie, the symptom of
  self-harming pride and grief on which he is challenged by no one else in his
  life, but can’t work out if it means something more. The late-90s setting is
  signalled by Smash Mouth’s Walkin’ on the Sun on the jukebox, Jerry Springer
  on the TV, a landline answering machine and characters resentfully lending
  people their flip-top mobile phones and telling them not to “use up my
  minutes”. In fact, the story itself perhaps comes from an era of Elmore
  Leonard, Ed Bunker and Quentin Tarantino; the shocks and twists and jolts are
  nasty and unexpected, and the stunts and car crashes are dished up in a
  chaotic swirl. I was disconcerted, however, when Butler’s character, a
  sweet-natured guy for whom we’re supposed to be rooting, seems to get over one
  particular horror with relative ease: I couldn’t quite decide if this was a
  drawback in his performance or something diluting the black comedy. Either
  way, Caught Stealing is a very enjoyable spectacle. At one stage, Hank hits a
  few balls and instantly a crowd of people gather round, awed – and an
  old-timer tells him he has “one hell of a swing”. The film has it too. •
  Caught Stealing is out on 28 August in Australia, and on 29 August in the US
  and UK.
