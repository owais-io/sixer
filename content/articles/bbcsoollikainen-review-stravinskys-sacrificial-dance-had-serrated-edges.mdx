  A clarinet solo line carved, firm and fierce, out of the heatwave stuffiness.
  Twitches and rustles from the huge array of percussion. A bigger picture
  emerges, anchored by the deep throb of low brass. Bitonal parps cut through
  like car horns in gridlock. A century after its premiere, Edgard Varèse’s
  Intégrales remains a beguiling listen – particularly in a performance as
  coolly loose-limbed as the BBC Symphony Orchestra served up under Finnish
  conductor Eva Ollikainen. Standing where the strings would normally be to
  marshal the piece’s sparse wind, brass and percussion, Ollikainen made
  angular, hyper-efficient gestures. That not-for-show approach persisted
  throughout – with sonically spectacular results – as each item on the
  programme demanded an incrementally larger orchestra. The UK premiere of Anna
  Thorvaldsdottir’s Before We Fall (Cello Concerto) began with a splash of
  cymbal and a tutti chord that disintegrated rapidly into tapping and sliding
  out of which soloist Johannes Moser soared, all generous vibrato and lyrical
  warmth. As with so many of Thorvaldsdottir’s scores, the concerto has an
  elemental, immersive quality, its symphonic textures seeming at times to
  breath as if a living organism. Elsewhere, the orchestra was in danger of
  swallowing Moser’s detailed passagework whole. Occasionally, the entire
  ensemble clicked briefly into tonal harmony – a remarkable, luminous effect.
  After the interval: Stravinsky’s The Rite of Spring was performed with
  breathtaking clarity. The coordination was absolutely taut across the now-vast
  orchestra, the piece’s sudden cut-offs of phrases and ideas brutal, Ollikainen
  maintaining a knife-edge balance between effortful, friction-heavy string
  playing and woodwind solos that might hail from another planet. The piece’s
  tension between the mellow and the murderous, the natural and the machinic,
  felt genuinely high stakes: this sacrificial dance had serrated edges, every
  detail terrifying in its lucidity, its momentum intoxicating. The Rite’s power
  was only increased by a cool-as-ice performance of Ravel’s Boléro (earworm to
  end all earworms) at the end of the first half. Ollikainen’s air of detachment
  came into its own here, holding back the tremendous power of Ravel’s 13-minute
  crescendo until the very last minute so that the looping melody’s final crash
  to earth came as a full-on orchestral catastrophe. • Listen again on BBC
  Sounds until 12 October. The Proms continue until 13 September.
