  Guardian writers’ predicted position: 14th (NB: this is not necessarily Ed
  Aarons’ prediction but the average of our writers’ tips) Last season’s
  position: 12th Prospects Crystal Palace’s achievement of winning the club’s
  first major trophy by beating Manchester City in the FA Cup final should have
  made it a summer to savour for supporters. Instead, it has been spent
  nervously awaiting news over which European competition the team will play in
  after Uefa eventually said Palace had breached its rules on multi-club
  ownership. Palace’s fate is still yet to be resolved as they prepare for their
  appeal against demotion to the Conference League at the court of arbitration
  for sport, with a decision expected on Monday. At least that will finally
  provide clarity as the club attempt to build on last season’s success,
  although a lack of signings is an indication of the effect such uncertainty
  has had on their planning. The Argentina goalkeeper Walter Benítez and Croatia
  defender Borna Sosa have been the only additions to Oliver Glasner’s squad and
  the Austrian manager admitted during Palace’s pre-season tour last week that
  he was “promised more”. With doubts over the futures of the captain Marc
  Guéhi, who has entered the final 12 months of his contract and is wanted by
  Liverpool, and the Arsenal target Eberechi Eze, the chair Steve Parish faces
  another testing month as Palace attempt to keep hold of their most important
  players. He has yet to replace Dougie Freedman after the sporting director’s
  surprise departure for Saudi Arabia and it looks as if Palace will be forced
  to repeat last year’s flurry of late transfer business that brought four
  signings on deadline day. Glasner’s side failed to win until their ninth match
  last season – a nightmare start that meant even a spectacular turnaround after
  November that culminated in their FA Cup triumph could not quite clinch a
  top-half finish. Palace have shown they are capable of achieving that,
  although their chances will be complicated by being in Europe. The manager
  Glasner is not the kind of manager who hangs around if he doesn’t think a club
  match his ambition. The softly spoken 50-year-old with the Austrian equivalent
  of an MBA in business administration has yet to recommence talks over
  extending a contract that has less than a year remaining and has made clear
  that he wanted more investment in a squad that has thrived since he was
  appointed in February 2024. If Palace are to have any chance of avoiding
  becoming what Glasner described as “a one-hit wonder” then the club must do
  all they can to keep him happy. Off-field picture Woody Johnson has replaced
  his fellow American John Textor as the club’s biggest shareholder after
  Palace’s issues with Uefa, and the hope is that the New York Jets owner can
  provide some stability in the boardroom given the turmoil of recent months. It
  remains to be seen whether Johnson will be able to stump up the extra funding
  required for the new Main Stand that some insiders fear could cost up to
  £250m, although the 78-year-old who previously tried to buy Chelsea is
  estimated to have a £3.5bn fortune. His relationship with Parish, who saved
  his boyhood club from administration in 2010 and has established them as
  Premier League regulars, will be crucial to whether Palace can continue to
  progress. Star signing Snapping up a 27-year-old Croatia international for £3m
  is pretty much unheard of these days but Palace will be hoping that Sosa can
  follow in the footsteps of Daniel Muñoz and take the Premier League by storm.
  The Colombian wing-back has been a revelation down the right since joining
  from Genk for £6.8m last year and Glasner has wanted competition for Tyrick
  Mitchell on the left for some time. Sosa has plenty of experience having
  played in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and in his homeland, as well as
  being part of the Croatia squad that finished third at the 2022 World Cup in
  Qatar. Stepping up Romain Esse scored his first Premier League goal 25 seconds
  into his debut in January, a couple of weeks after his move from south London
  rivals Millwall for an initial £12m. Yet the 20-year-old forward was hauled
  off by Glasner in the final game of the season against Liverpool amid
  suggestions that he was not playing “100% for the team”. “He knows why, that’s
  enough,” said the Palace manager. Esse should get his opportunities this
  season given the extra games in Europe and will be eager to prove he can live
  up to the potential he showed in the Championship. A big season for … Chadi
  Riad didn’t have much luck during his first season in south London. The
  Morocco defender, who came through Barcelona’s academy and was signed from
  Real Betis for about £14m, damaged knee ligaments 10 minutes into his second
  appearance for Palace in a Carabao Cup tie against Norwich in August. He
  returned in January but was then ruled out for the rest of the season after
  sustaining another serious knee injury in training. Riad’s expected return in
  the near future will be most welcome in an area of the team where Palace have
  been stretched. It will be a bonus too for Palace if, as expected, the Mali
  midfielder Cheick Doucouré is back soon, after he was sidelined for most of
  last season.
