  Police in England brace for disorder as far right promote anti-migrant
  protests

  Police are braced for potential disorder in towns across England this weekend
  amid the far right’s promotion of a range of protests against asylum seekers,
  with anti-racism activists planning counter-protests. Restrictions will be in
  place on Friday at locations including Norwich while officers will police at
  least 12 other towns and cities that evening. There are particular concerns
  around a planned protest on Saturday at council offices in Nuneaton, where
  Warwickshire police have dismissed claims by a Reform UK council leader that
  the force held back information over the alleged rape of a 12-year-old girl.
  While local people have been involved in demonstrations that have taken place
  in recent weeks at many of the locations, a disparate range of far-right
  groups and influencers are heavily involved in promoting the protests,
  including supporters of the activist known as Tommy Robinson. The chair of the
  National Police Chiefs’ Council’s operations coordination committee, chief
  constable BJ Harrington, said: “We urge communities to carefully consider the
  information they read, share and trust from online sources. “It is essential
  to remain aware of the potential for motivations behind such content. We would
  encourage the public to access formal authorities for accurate information.
  “The spread of disinformation and misinformation by individuals or groups can
  significantly contribute to community tensions and has real-world
  implications. We all have a responsibility in this respect, and relevant
  criminal law applies to online actions.” Harrington said police were committed
  to upholding the right to lawful and peaceful protest and would work with
  event organisers where possible. However, he added that police were monitoring
  intelligence while public order units and evidence-gathering teams would
  respond to any incidents that involved the risk of disorder. Georgie Laming,
  the director of campaigns at Hope Not Hate, which monitors racist and
  extremist groups, said: “It’s difficult to predict how many people will attend
  these protests. “Some may not materialise at all, while others might draw
  crowds. These protests continue to look more like the anti-migrant protests of
  2023 and less like the violent disorder and rioting of 2024.” The latest
  protests come after days of clashes last month in Essex, where groups of men
  attacked police and vandalised police vehicles after violence erupted after a
  protest outside a hotel in Epping housing asylum seekers. Anti-racism
  activists and trade unionists outnumbered a recent protest outside the hotel,
  but Epping is among the towns where the far right are promoting another
  protest on Friday. Activists from the far-right Homeland party are among those
  centrally involved in Epping, while a rival group, Patriotic Alternative, has
  sought to exploit protests in the north. There were also clashes outside a
  hotel in Islington, north London, as far-right activists and a Stand Up to
  Racism protest faced off. Also in the city, there is expected to be another
  protest outside a hotel in Canary Wharf against the suspected use of the hotel
  to accommodate asylum seekers. Women and children have taken part in what has
  been promoted online as a “pink protest”, but far-right activists and
  influencers have also been involved in activities outside the hotel and
  online. In Warwickshire, chief constable Alex Franklin-Smith has responded to
  a claim by the county council leader, Reform UK’s George Finch, that it held
  back information over the alleged rape of a 12-year-old girl, saying officers
  “did not and will not cover up such criminality”. However, the case is a
  factor in tensions. Norfolk police will put in place powers on Friday evening
  at a protest in Bowthorpe, Norwich, including an obligation for members of the
  public to remove face coverings when asked by officers. Another order will be
  in place allowing the police to direct anyone committing, or who may commit,
  antisocial behaviour to leave the area from 2pm on Friday to 2am on Saturday.
