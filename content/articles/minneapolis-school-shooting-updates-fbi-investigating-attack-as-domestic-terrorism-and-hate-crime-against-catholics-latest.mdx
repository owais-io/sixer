  There was a rifle, a shotgun and a pistol which had all been lawfully
  purchased by the shooter, O’Hara said, adding it is believed the shooter acted
  alone. At this point, there are 19 victims - 2 who were children aged 8 and 10
  who were pronounced dead on the scene, and another 14 children who were
  injured along with 3 adults in their 80s who were parishioners, Minneapolis
  police chief Brian O’Hara said in an update. “Anybody who is using this as an
  opportunity to villainize our trans community has lost their sense of common
  humanity,” said Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey just now. We should not be
  operating from a place of hate for anyone. We should be operating from a place
  of love for our kids. This is about them. “As horrible as this has been, it
  could have been far worse,” Frey went on. We’ve got more guns in this country
  than we have people and it’s on all of us to recognize the truth and the
  reality that we can’t just say that this should not happen again and then
  allow it to happen again and again beyond that. “There shouldn’t be words for
  these kinds of incidents because they should not happen,” Minnesota governor
  Tim Walz has just told the news conference on the shooting. “And there’s no
  words that are going to ease the pain of the families today.” Pope Leo XIV was
  “profoundly saddened” to learn of the deaths and injuries from the mass
  shooting, the Vatican said in a statement reported by CNN. “He sends his
  heartfelt condolences and the assurance of spiritual closeness to all those
  affected by this terrible tragedy, especially the families now grieving the
  loss of a child,” said Vatican secretary of state Pietro Parolin. The Pope is
  praying for the victims, first responders and clergy, and sends his blessings
  to the school and community, Parolin added. Minneapolis city leaders and law
  enforcement were due to hold a news conference at 2.30pm local time (3.30pm
  ET) to provide an update on the shooting, though that seems to be running
  slightly late. I’ll bring you any updates from that when it happens. The FBI
  is investigating the school shooting in Minneapolis as an act of domestic
  terrorism and hate crime targeting Catholics, the bureau’s director Kash Patel
  has announced in a post on X. Patel continued: There were 2 fatalities, an
  8-year-old and a 10-year-old. In addition, 14 children and 3 adults were
  injured. The shooter has been identified as Robin Westman, a male born as
  Robert Westman. The FBI will continue to provide updates on our ongoing
  investigation with the public as we are able. Asked what was going through his
  head as he hid under a pew during the attack, a 10-year-old witness told
  reporters: “I covered my head. My friend Victor saved me though, because he
  laid on top of me. But he got hit.” Reporters asked him if they had practised
  for such [active shooter] scenarios, to which the child said yes, but added:
  “We never practised it in the church though, only in school, so it was way
  different.” He described feeling “relief” and “very happy” seeing his mother
  after it had happened. “It was super scary,” he said, adding that he was
  praying for his friend that got shot. And the Minnesota Vikings football team
  shared this statement: The Minnesota Twins baseball team has shared a
  statement on X in reponse to the school shooting. “The taking of innocent
  lives in a place of learning and worship is incomprehensible,” the statement
  reads. “We mourn this tragedy and yearn for a future where such violence no
  longer shatters lives.” Westman’s uncle, former Kentucky state lawmaker Bob
  Heleringer, said he did not know the accused shooter well and was confounded
  by the violence: “It’s an unspeakable tragedy.” “We’re praying for my sister
  and her other children and also, obviously, for these poor, poor children,”
  Heleringer told the Associated Press. He said he had last seen Westman at a
  family wedding three or four years ago. The shooter’s identity has been
  confirmed as 23-year old Robin Westman, according to law enforcement officials
  speaking to local news outlets. Records reviewed by Kare 11 showed that
  Westman had grown up in Richfield and that Westman’s mother was an employee at
  Annuciation School before retiring in 2021. Further records reviewed by the
  outlet showed that Westman had put in an application at 17-years old for a
  name change from Robert to Robin. The request was granted in January 2020,
  Kare 11 reports. Barack Obama has condemned the mass shooting in Minneapolis
  where two children were killed. Writing on X, Obama said: We can’t allow
  ourselves to become numb to mass shootings. What happened today in Minneapolis
  is heartbreaking, and Michelle and I are praying for the parents who have lost
  a child or will be sitting at their hospital bedside after yet another act of
  unspeakable, unnecessary violence. A young man who grew up in the nearby
  neighborhood to Annunciation church and school dropped white flowers at the
  stoplight near the site. He heard about the shooting and headed over to pay
  his respects, tearfully telling reporters that the violence left him shaken.
  The church holds a fair, which just happened earlier this summer, and is very
  much a part of the community, he said. Voters of Tomorrow, the US’s largest
  youth-led voter outreach organization, has released the following statement in
  response to this morning’s mass shooting in Minneapolis: Our hearts break for
  the Annunciation Catholic School Community. We offer our sincerest condolences
  to the victims, survivors, and their loved ones as they navigate this
  difficult time.” “At the start of a new school year, kids should be excitedly
  greeting their teachers and friends, not mourning their classmates. However,
  this back-to-school season has been marked by daily threats, false alarms, and
  this horrific tragedy at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis.” “While
  decades of lawmakers have failed to enact a comprehensive solution to the gun
  violence crisis, only this administration has worked to deliberately undo what
  little progress we have made. With every grant cut and regulation repealed,
  Trump tells our generation that our lives matter less than the interests of
  the gun lobby. Trump has students’ blood on his hands.” Donald Trump has
  ordered American flags to be flown at half-mast following the mass shooting at
  a Catholic school in Minneapolis. In a statement released on Wednesday, Trump
  said: As a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of violence
  perpetrated on August 27, 2025, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, by the authority
  vested in me as President of the United States by the Constitution and the
  laws of the United States of America, I hereby order that the flag of the
  United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and upon all
  public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on
  all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and
  throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset,
  August 31, 2025. I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for
  the same length of time at all United States embassies, legations, consular
  offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and
  naval vessels and stations. I’m standing outside police tape about a block
  away from where a shooter fired at a Catholic school, killing two children.
  Police vehicles with their lights on are staged outside the school as news
  cameras are trained from outside the police tape, awaiting more information
  from officials. A white tent is set up outside the school. The school is near
  a main road and commercial area. As I walked by a Starbucks and grocery store
  beside the police line, a woman walked by and said, “It just makes you sick.”
  Police officers are redirecting traffic, escorting elected officials and
  surveying the area. Leaders and parents across the US have reacted in shock
  and horror as yet another mass shooting has struck America, this time at a
  Minneapolis Catholic school when an assailant opened fire on children gathered
  in a church celebrating their first mass of the new school year. Authorities
  said the shooting took place Wednesday morning at Annunciation Catholic
  school. Two children, ages eight and 10, were shot and killed as they sat in
  the pew at Annunciation Church. About 17 others were hurt, with 14 of them
  being children. As details emerged, political leaders released statements on
  the shooting. The shooter has been named as Robin Westman, 23, by local news
  outlets. Westman reportedly grew up in Richfield, Minnesota, and his mother
  worked at Annunciation School. Westman applied in Dakota County to change his
  birth name from Robert to Robin, per court documents obtained by Minnesota
  news outlet KARE 11. That request was granted in January 2020. The Associated
  Press has spoken to people at the scene reacting to the shooting at
  Annunciation Catholic School that left two children dead. Aubrey Pannhoff, a
  16-year-old student at a nearby Catholic school, had been on a mission trip to
  Colorado with the school earlier this summer. “I’m just asking him (God) why
  right now. It’s little kids,” she said. One of her mission trip leaders’
  children was grazed by a bullet, Pannhoff said, and she doesn’t know how the
  other teachers are. “It’s just really hard for me to take in.” Michael Simpson
  said his 10-year-old grandson, Weston Halsne, was nicked by a bullet as he sat
  by the church windows on Wednesday. His voice was shaking as he left the area
  around the school. Simpson said the violence during mass left him wondering
  whether God was watching over the school still. “I don’t know where He is,”
  Simpson said. “It’s just really hard for me to take in” Here is the longer
  statement from Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey from the earlier press conference
  today: “Children are dead. They are families that have a deceased child. You
  cannot put into words the gravity the tragedy or the absolute pain of this
  situation. We are a Minneapolis family, but to everybody out there, do not
  think of these as just somebody else’s kids. Those families are suffering
  immense pain right now. Think of this as if it were your own. Every one of us
  needs to be wrapping our arms around these families, giving them every ounce
  that we can muster. These were Minneapolis families. These were American
  families, and the amount of pain that they are suffering right now is
  extraordinary. Don’t just say this is about thoughts and prayers right now.
  These kids were literally praying. It was the first week of school. They were
  in a church. These are kids that should be learning with their friends. They
  should be playing on the playground, they should be able to go to school or
  church in peace without the fear or risk of violence, and their parents should
  have the same kind of assurance. These are the sort of basic assurances every
  family should have every step of the day, regardless of where they are in our
  country. I’m so deeply saddened and I’m so sorry to the families that I know
  are suffering right now. My ask is to everyone, stand by them. Love them.
  These families have forever been changed, and we’ve all been changed with
  them. We need to do everything possible to support them through this time… To
  the families that are suffering, to those that have experienced loss, I’m so
  deeply sorry. We’re going to be with you every step of the way. We love you.
  This kind of act of evil should never happen, and it happens far too often.”
  Renee Lego, an Annunciation parishioner who has a 5th grader and 8th grader at
  Annunciation Catholic School, told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that her older
  son thought the gunshots were “fireworks or a gas explosion” but then he saw
  people falling. “Both my kids have blood on them,” she said. “It’s just
  horrific — so cowardly. This person knew this was our first all-school Mass of
  the year. It was obviously planned. This is the children’s Mass, not an
  advertised Mass for the public.” Former congressional representative and gun
  violence prevention advocate Gabby Giffords took to X and wrote: I am
  heartbroken and furious over the shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in
  Minneapolis. Kids should be learning, laughing, making friends — not running
  for their lives on the very first week of school. Another community is now
  traumatized by a mass shooting. How many more children will have to live this
  nightmare before our elected leaders do something? Meanwhile, House minority
  leader Hakeem Jeffries wrote: The shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in
  Minneapolis is horrifying. Praying for the children, families and first
  responders during this moment of terror and unimaginable grief. Weapons of war
  have no place in our neighborhoods, streets or schools. Similarly, the
  youth-led gun violence prevention group March for Our Lives said: “Gun
  violence is the leading cause of death for children in America. Today in
  Minneapolis, that meant stained glass blown apart by bullets and kids
  slaughtered in church. A parent called it evil. They’re right. But let’s be
  clear: this isn’t just evil — it’s policy. It’s the direct result of people in
  power cashing checks from the gun industry while our kids are murdered. They
  know children are dying. And they choose it anyway. We will not live in a
  country that executes children in schools and churches. We will not accept
  their cowardice. We demand action. And we will not stop until the killing
  ends.” Students at the Annunciation Catholic School, which enrolls children
  from preschool through eighth grade, only just returned for their first day
  back from summer break on Monday. The school’s Facebook page shared images
  this week of students reuniting and parking their bikes. “Happy first day of
  school! It was great having everyone back in the building today,” the school
  wrote on Monday. Donald Trump said on Truth Social on Wednesday morning that
  he has been “fully briefed on the tragic shooting” and that the “White House
  will continue to monitor this terrible situation. Please join me in praying
  for everyone involved!” Meanwhile, education secretary Linda McMahon said: “I
  am devastated by the shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minnesota. I
  am grateful to the first responders working at the scene and praying for the
  victims of this horrific violence. My office is reaching out to local
  officials to learn more.” Today’s incident marks the fourth deadly shooting in
  24 hours in Minneapolis. Over the course of Tuesday into Wednesday, three
  people were shot and killed in three separate shootings. Despite this
  morning’s shootings not appearing to be connected to the shootings of the
  previous day, police said: The level of gun violence across the city within
  the last day is deeply unsettling. Across three separate multiple-victim
  shootings, eight people have been injured by gunfire and three have lost their
  lives. Hennepin Healthcare, a level 1 trauma hospital in Minneapolis said it
  had received 11 patients, including two adults and nine children, ranging in
  age from 6 to 14. Four required the operating room, but no fatalities were
  related to those brought in, said Dr. Thomas Wyatt, chair of emergency
  medicine. Here are some images coming through the newswires from Minneapolis:
  Minneapolis police chief Brian O’Hara provided more details about the shooter,
  saying: “It appeared he had some black clothing on, cargo type pants.” He
  added: “I do believe there was one, I guess you would call it a smoke bomb,
  like not an explosive, but a sort of a firework that would release smoke.”
  Police are now working to determine a motive from the shooter. Speaking to
  reporters, police chief Brian O’Hara said: “We believe it is one suspect, a
  sole shooter. We believe he is deceased. He is in his early 20s, does not have
  an extensive known criminal history, and we are looking through information
  left behind to try and determine some type of motive…” O’Hara added that it
  remains to be determined whether he was a former school employee or a former
  student. “There’s a vehicle that we believe that the suspect used, that is
  being searched, and we will be conducting other searches related to this
  inside the parking lot,” he said. O’Hara also said the shooter was armed with
  a rifle, a shotgun and a pistol. Two children, ages 8 and 10 were killed, with
  17 others being injured, 14 of those being children, said Minneapolis police
  chief Brian O’Hara. He said: “This worship service was marking the first week
  of school for children that are attending the Annunciation Catholic school.
  During the mass, a gunman approached on the outside, on the side of the
  building and began firing a rifle through the church windows, towards the
  children sitting in the pews at the mass. He struck children and worshippers
  that were inside the building. The shooter was armed with a rifle, a shotgun
  and a pistol. This was a deliberate act of violence against innocent children
  and other people worshipping. The sheer cruelty and cowardice of firing into a
  church full of children is absolutely incomprehensible … Two young children,
  ages 8 and 10 were killed where they sat in the pews, their parents have been
  notified. 17 other people were injured, 14 of them being children. Two of
  those children are in critical condition. The coward who fired these shots
  ultimately took his own life in the rear of the church.” Minneapolis mayor
  Jacob Frey is holding a press conference currently. “There are families that
  have a deceased child. You can not put into words the gravity, the tragedy, or
  the pain of this situation … Those families are suffering immense pain right
  now. Think of this as if it were your own. Every one of us needs to be
  wrapping our arms around these families, giving them every ounce that we can
  muster. These were Minneapolis families. These were American families, and the
  amount of pain that they are suffering right now is extraordinary.” The
  Department of Homeland Security has also been notified of the shooting, with
  secretary Kristi Noem saying: “DHS is monitoring the horrific shooting at
  Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis. We are in communication with our
  interagency partners, and will share more information as soon as it becomes
  available. I am praying for the victims of this heinous attack and their
  families.” Minnesota leaders including governor Tim Walz, Minneapolis governor
  Jacob Frey, as well as congressional senators Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith
  have been briefed on the incident. Writing on X, Walz said: I’ve been briefed
  on a shooting at Annunciation Catholic School and will continue to provide
  updates as we get more information. The BCA and State Patrol are on scene. I’m
  praying for our kids and teachers whose first week of school was marred by
  this horrific act of violence. Meanwhile, Frey said: “I’m monitoring reports
  of horrific violence in South Minneapolis. I’m in touch with Chief O’Hara and
  our emergency response team has been activated. We will share more information
  as soon as we can. Please give our officers the space they need to respond to
  the situation.” Similarly, Klobuchar said: “I am heartbroken by the horrific
  violence at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis this morning. My
  prayers are with the students, teachers, and families, and I am grateful for
  the first responders who are on the scene.” Smith wrote: “My staff and I are
  monitoring the situation at Annunciation Catholic School. I’m grateful for the
  quick response of law enforcement as we continue to gather information. It’s
  the first week of school. These kids should not be fearing for their lives.
  Police responded to an active shooter incident at a Catholic school in south
  Minneapolis on Wednesday, with sources confirming there are multiple victims
  and that the shooter is now dead. Children’s Minnesota hospital told the
  Minneapolis Star Tribune that it currently has five children “admitted to our
  hospital for care” and “will not share more details to respect the privacy of
  our patients and families”. The city of Minneapolis’s official X account said
  there is “no active threat to the community at this time” as of 10:29am EST.
  “The shooter is contained. Stay away from the area to allow emergency
  personnel to help victims – W. 54th Street between Lyndale and Nicollet Ave,”
  the city wrote. A justice department official confirmed to Reuters that three
  people were dead, including the shooter, and 20 injured. Fox 9 also reported
  that the first call to law enforcement went through at 8.27am local time,
  shortly after a mass for students was slated to kick off at 8.15am. The police
  department from Richfield, a suburb that borders Minneapolis, told Fox 9 there
  were 20 victims. “A man dressed in all black and armed with a rifle was
  reported at the scene,” the Richfield police department said. Stay tuned as we
  bring you the latest updates.

This is the children’s Mass, not an advertised Mass for the public.” Former congressional representative and gun violence prevention advocate Gabby Giffords took to X and wrote: I am heartbroken and furious over the shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis. Kids should be learning, laughing, making friends — not running for their lives on the very first week of school. Another community is now traumatized by a mass shooting. How many more children will have to live this nightmare before our elected leaders do something? Meanwhile, House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries wrote: The shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis is horrifying. Praying for the children, families and first responders during this moment of terror and unimaginable grief. Weapons of war have no place in our neighborhoods, streets or schools. Similarly, the youth-led gun violence prevention group March for Our Lives said: “Gun violence is the leading cause of death for children in America. Today in Minneapolis, that meant stained glass blown apart by bullets and kids slaughtered in church. A parent called it evil. They’re right. But let’s be clear: this isn’t just evil — it’s policy. It’s the direct result of people in power cashing checks from the gun industry while our kids are murdered. They know children are dying. And they choose it anyway. We will not live in a country that executes children in schools and churches. We will not accept their cowardice. We demand action. And we will not stop until the killing ends.” Students at the Annunciation Catholic School, which enrolls children from preschool through eighth grade, only just returned for their first day back from summer break on Monday. The school’s Facebook page shared images this week of students reuniting and parking their bikes. “Happy first day of school! It was great having everyone back in the building today,” the school wrote on Monday. Donald Trump said on Truth Social on Wednesday morning that he has been “fully briefed on the tragic shooting” and that the “White House will continue to monitor this terrible situation. Please join me in praying for everyone involved!” Meanwhile, education secretary Linda McMahon said: “I am devastated by the shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minnesota. I am grateful to the first responders working at the scene and praying for the victims of this horrific violence. My office is reaching out to local officials to learn more.” Today’s incident marks the fourth deadly shooting in 24 hours in Minneapolis. Over the course of Tuesday into Wednesday, three people were shot and killed in three separate shootings. Despite this morning’s shootings not appearing to be connected to the shootings of the previous day, police said: The level of gun violence across the city within the last day is deeply unsettling. Across three separate multiple-victim shootings, eight people have been injured by gunfire and three have lost their lives. Hennepin Healthcare, a level 1 trauma hospital in Minneapolis said it had received 11 patients, including two adults and nine children, ranging in age from 6 to 14. Four required the operating room, but no fatalities were related to those brought in, said Dr. Thomas Wyatt, chair of emergency medicine. Here are some images coming through the newswires from Minneapolis: Minneapolis police chief Brian O’Hara provided more details about the shooter, saying: “It appeared he had some black clothing on, cargo type pants.” He added: “I do believe there was one, I guess you would call it a smoke bomb, like not an explosive, but a sort of a firework that would release smoke.” Police are now working to determine a motive from the shooter. Speaking to reporters, police chief Brian O’Hara said: “We believe it is one suspect, a sole shooter. We believe he is deceased. He is in his early 20s, does not have an extensive known criminal history, and we are looking through information left behind to try and determine some type of motive…” O’Hara added that it remains to be determined whether he was a former school employee or a former student. “There’s a vehicle that we believe that the suspect used, that is being searched, and we will be conducting other searches related to this inside the parking lot,” he said. O’Hara also said the shooter was armed with a rifle, a shotgun and a pistol. Two children, ages 8 and 10 were killed, with 17 others being injured, 14 of those being children, said Minneapolis police chief Brian O’Hara. He said: “This worship service was marking the first week of school for children that are attending the Annunciation Catholic school. During the mass, a gunman approached on the outside, on the side of the building and began firing a rifle through the church windows, towards the children sitting in the pews at the mass. He struck children and worshippers that were inside the building. The shooter was armed with a rifle, a shotgun and a pistol. This was a deliberate act of violence against innocent children and other people worshipping. The sheer cruelty and cowardice of firing into a church full of children is absolutely incomprehensible … Two young children, ages 8 and 10 were killed where they sat in the pews, their parents have been notified. 17 other people were injured, 14 of them being children. Two of those children are in critical condition. The coward who fired these shots ultimately took his own life in the rear of the church.” Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey is holding a press conference currently. “There are families that have a deceased child. You can not put into words the gravity, the tragedy, or the pain of this situation … Those families are suffering immense pain right now. Think of this as if it were your own. Every one of us needs to be wrapping our arms around these families, giving them every ounce that we can muster. These were Minneapolis families. These were American families, and the amount of pain that they are suffering right now is extraordinary.” The Department of Homeland Security has also been notified of the shooting, with secretary Kristi Noem saying: “DHS is monitoring the horrific shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis. We are in communication with our interagency partners, and will share more information as soon as it becomes available. I am praying for the victims of this heinous attack and their families.” Minnesota leaders including governor Tim Walz, Minneapolis governor Jacob Frey, as well as congressional senators Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith have been briefed on the incident. Writing on X, Walz said: I’ve been briefed on a shooting at Annunciation Catholic School and will continue to provide updates as we get more information. The BCA and State Patrol are on scene. I’m praying for our kids and teachers whose first week of school was marred by this horrific act of violence. Meanwhile, Frey said: “I’m monitoring reports of horrific violence in South Minneapolis. I’m in touch with Chief O’Hara and our emergency response team has been activated. We will share more information as soon as we can. Please give our officers the space they need to respond to the situation.” Similarly, Klobuchar said: “I am heartbroken by the horrific violence at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis this morning. My prayers are with the students, teachers, and families, and I am grateful for the first responders who are on the scene.” Smith wrote: “My staff and I are monitoring the situation at Annunciation Catholic School. I’m grateful for the quick response of law enforcement as we continue to gather information. It’s the first week of school. These kids should not be fearing for their lives. Police responded to an active shooter incident at a Catholic school in south Minneapolis on Wednesday, with sources confirming there are multiple victims and that the shooter is now dead. Children’s Minnesota hospital told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that it currently has five children “admitted to our hospital for care” and “will not share more details to respect the privacy of our patients and families”. The city of Minneapolis’s official X account said there is “no active threat to the community at this time” as of 10:29am EST. “The shooter is contained. Stay away from the area to allow emergency personnel to help victims – W. 54th Street between Lyndale and Nicollet Ave,” the city wrote. A justice department official confirmed to Reuters that three people were dead, including the shooter, and 20 injured. Fox 9 also reported that the first call to law enforcement went through at 8.27am local time, shortly after a mass for students was slated to kick off at 8.15am. The police department from Richfield, a suburb that borders Minneapolis, told Fox 9 there were 20 victims. “A man dressed in all black and armed with a rifle was reported at the scene,” the Richfield police department said.
