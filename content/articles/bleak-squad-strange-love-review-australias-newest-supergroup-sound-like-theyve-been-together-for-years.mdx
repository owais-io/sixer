  Occasionally the musical universe offers unexpected gifts that we might never
  have thought to ask for and had no right to expect. Strange Love, the debut
  album by new Melbourne supergroup Bleak Squad, is one such gift. The names
  speak for themselves: Adalita (Magic Dirt), Mick Harvey (the Bad Seeds, the
  Birthday Party), Mick Turner (Dirty Three) and Marty Brown (Art of Fighting,
  SodaStream, Claire Bowditch), who brought the band together. Brown’s intuition
  that such a combination would go well together has proven inspired. Such
  things can easily end up sounding better on paper than in practice. Instead,
  Bleak Squad sound pretty much exactly as you’d expect, given their name and
  collective histories: the hour is late, the lights are low, the writing is
  sharp, the arrangements are tight – but the playing is expansive and
  open-ended, with songs designed to be stretched out in live performance. This
  is a genuine collaboration, with significant written contributions from all
  four members. Vocals are shared mainly by Adalita and Harvey, with guitars by
  Adalita and Turner. Harvey, the best multi-instrumentalist, does a bit of
  everything, while Brown takes most of the drums, piano and more besides. In
  lesser hands, it could be a dog’s breakfast, but the sound Bleak Squad have
  arrived at is coherent and fully formed. Sign up for the fun stuff with our
  rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday
  morning Of course, Adalita, Harvey and Turner are all established soloists,
  with distinctive voices. You can hear echoes of all four members’ respective
  projects, and the ghost of Harvey’s old bandmate Rowland S Howard seems to
  hover over all of it. But nothing feels forced or contrived. It’s a real band:
  Strange Love sounds more like a fourth album than a first, by an act that’s
  honed their craft for years. The reality of how the record was made is quite
  different. Bleak Squad’s method was to play each other their songs once,
  teaching the basic parts, do a run-through, then record the second take,
  leaving room for soloing or improvisation. The nine songs flow like a river,
  usually unhurried, occasionally cascading over rapids. To an extent this lends
  an element of sameness (and it does, at least on the first listen), but it
  also feels like one long, satisfying trip. Adalita is at the top of her game
  here. Unabashed about playing with her heroes – Turner and Harvey coming from
  the musical generation before hers – her vocals and lyrics on Safe as Houses
  and Lost My Head are richly assured. The delicious surprise is what a great
  foil the ever-deadpan Harvey makes for her, whether in duet (Everything Must
  Change, World Go to Hell) or when he steps up for lead vocals (Ghost of the
  Bad Humour Man). The latter is one of this album’s highlights, and provides
  welcome comic relief. It’s actually not quite as bleak as it sounds: on face
  value, Harvey could be talking about depression, but he could also be poking
  fun at his rather stoic image. “I told my jokes, those caustic puns, / not
  popular with everyone, / as dry as dust, / they obscure the sun,” he
  sing-speaks, like an Australian Lou Reed. (Reed’s sense of humour went over
  plenty of heads, too.) Time will tell whether or not Bleak Squad is left to
  stand as a one-off project by a group who all have their own stuff going on,
  or something more lasting. What I’m more confident in predicting is that they
  should not be missed live: four Australian music greats with charisma to burn,
  uncanny chemistry, and a quality set of songs tailor-made for those long, dark
  nights of the soul. Strange Love is out now (Poison City Records). Bleak Squad
  will perform on 17 October at the Unconformity festival, Tasmania
