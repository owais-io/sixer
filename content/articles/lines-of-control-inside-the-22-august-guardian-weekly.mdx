  Donald Trump had seemed to be firmly back under the sway of Vladimir Putin
  following their summit in Alaska last Friday. But an intense push by European
  leaders appeared to coax Trump out of pro-Russian positions on Ukraine and led
  to a remarkable gathering in Washington on Monday. Have their efforts done
  enough to give Volodymr Zelenskyy a meaningful role in negotiations?
  Washington correspondent David Smith reports on the hectic diplomatic efforts.
  Trump’s talk of “land swaps” between Ukraine and Russia, as a simple
  transactional path to a peace deal, belies the grim reality of what it would
  mean for people in Zaporizhzhia. Shaun Walker reports from the Ukrainian
  frontline city where emotions are running high. Trump’s meeting with Putin in
  Anchorage – where the US president rolled out the red carpet for his Russian
  counterpart – was widely viewed as a diplomatic triumph for Moscow.
  International affairs expert Rajan Menon explains why Putin is likely to be
  delighted with the way events are unfolding. Get the Guardian Weekly delivered
