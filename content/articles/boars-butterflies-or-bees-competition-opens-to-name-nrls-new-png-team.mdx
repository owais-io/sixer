  Following the Perth Bears, the next franchise to join the National Rugby
  League competition may just be the PNG Boars. Or will it be the Hunters, the
  Chiefs or even the Coastal Thunderhawks? That will be decided in coming months
  after the NRL’s Papua New Guinea franchise launched an international call-out
  for suggestions, giving fans two weeks to come up with an identity for the new
  entity. Prime minister James Marape said it was an important step for more
  than just the club. “This team must be owned by the people of Papua New
  Guinea,” he said. “It must tell our national unification story and resonate
  with the idea of one people, one nation, one country.” At an event at the
  National Stadium in Port Moresby on Wednesday, Marape was joined by Australian
  High Commissioner to PNG, Ewen McDonald, and franchise chief executive Andrew
  Hill. “We no longer want to be a franchise, we no longer want to be a bid, we
  actually want to be a club,” Hill said. “Before we become a club, we need a
  name.” On the website for submissions, Boars, Chiefs and Coastal Thunderhawks
  are suggested, but within hours social media has been flooded by hundreds more
  options. The PNG Hunters is an early favourite, given a team under that banner
  has competed in the Queensland Cup competition since 2014. There have also
  been more novel proposals. “The fitting name would be PNG Traders,” one said.
  “The name strongly takes us back to the days of our ancestors prior to the
  arrival of colonisers into PNG.” Another proposed the PNG Flames “since we
  have many active volcanoes”. PNG Butterflies and PNG Bees featured in one
  pitch, continuing a theme for the natural world that included the Birds of
  Paradise and the PNG Hornbills, known locally as Kokomos. Another fan wanted
  the Muruks, a variety of cassowary, because it is “an iconic and formidable
  bird” that “represents power, agility, and a deep connection to the natural
  environment”. At the end of August, five names will be selected by the club’s
  board to progress to a second phase which will involve a public vote. “At this
  stage though, we need everybody that’s interested to give us a name so we can
  take forward and turn this franchise into a thriving NRL club,” Hill said,
  confirming the process was open to anyone around the world as long as they
  were “connected to PNG”. The club’s entry into the NRL was confirmed last year
  thanks to a $600m pledge from the Australian government to PNG and Pacific
  rugby league. Yet the new franchise – due to enter the NRL in 2028 – has
  already faced challenges. Bid chairman and businessman Wapu Sonk stepped down
  from the board due to allegations of corruption made in July unrelated to the
  team. He has denied any wrongdoing and said the claims are “baseless”. Similar
  fan-driven naming processes have been undertaken for clubs in recent decades,
  including for the Tasmania Devils in the AFL, and are designed to connect
  clubs with potential fans before the players take the field. Marape said he
  had entered a suggestion, but told local media he would not reveal it. “I
  don’t want to influence the mindset of the country,” he said.
