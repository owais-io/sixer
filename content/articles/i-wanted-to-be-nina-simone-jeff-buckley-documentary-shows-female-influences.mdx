  In the years since Jeff Buckley’s shocking death at age 30 in 1997, his estate
  has sanctioned the release of 10 studio compilations, eight live collections,
  one box set, eight singles and five video recordings. In addition, there have
  been a rash of documentaries, produced in various countries around the world,
  as well as a dramatic depiction of him played by actor Penn Badgley in a movie
  whose title alludes to his musical father, Greetings from Tim Buckley.
  Collectively, that places him in the realm of other departed stars, including
  Jimi Hendrix, Miles Davis and Eva Cassidy, whose catalogues have been mined
  for every ounce of gold they can possibly produce. In that context, the title
  of the new Jeff Buckley documentary, It’s Never Over, could easily read like a
  threat. Luckily, nothing could be further from the truth. The film winds up
  giving a largely familiar story a holistic reach like no project before it.
  However picked over the bones of Buckley’s story may be, director Amy Berg has
  found fresh flesh by emphasizing the crucial role women played in his life
  starting with his mother, Mary Guibert, and fanning out to various
  girlfriends, most of whom are fellow artists who sometimes doubled as
  spiritual collaborators. Together, they show how a female spirit not only
  shaped Buckley’s early life, it also provided a foundational part of his art.
  The earliest songs he sang as a kid were voiced by women, from Diana Ross’s
  yearning reading of Ain’t No Mountain High Enough to Judy Garland’s
  self-immolating take on The Man Who Got Away. “I wanted to be a chanteuse,”
  Buckley says in a vintage audio interview used in the film. “Secretly, I think
  I wanted to be Nina Simone.” You can hear the connection in the intensity,
  range and sustain of his quaver, which also drew from the qawwali chants of
  the Pakistani devotional singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. In the film, Buckley
  refers to Khan as “my Elvis”. At the same time, he drew profound inspiration
  from classically macho sources, initially through the scorched earth whomp of
  Led Zeppelin and, later, via the chest-beating yowls of Soundgarden’s Chris
  Cornell. The breadth of those gender identifications allowed Buckley to
  idealize the Jungian concept of anima, which asserts that men have to
  recognize their feminine side in order to fully embrace their humanity, as
  well as to truly understand the role of women in their lives. In one vintage
  quote in the film, Buckley says, “I decided to make a woman of music and give
  myself to her. At another point, I decided to make a man of music and give
  myself to him,” adding for good measure: “Music was my mother. It was my
  father. It was the best thing in my life.” That last line can’t be easy to
  hear for his actual mother, who co-produced the film and who guards his estate
  like a sentry, deciding who from his life can speak for him and who cannot. To
  her credit, Guibert allowed director Berg to cast Jeff’s early years with her
  in a far from soft light. She was just a teenager when he was born, the
  product of a fleeting relationship with the visionary cult singer Tim Buckley.
  At the time, he was on the rise (or at least seemed to be), and, in his
  ambition, he ignored both her and the coming child. Five months into her
  pregnancy, Guibert recalls in the film, “I knew I was never going to see Tim
  again.” While Tim Buckley ran off to pursue his dreams, her ambitions of being
  an actor and musician withered under the responsibility of raising the child.
  She’s honest in the film about her own immaturity at the time, which meant
  that Jeff had to mother her in ways that came to haunt and anger him. The only
  time he saw his father was during several days they spent together when Jeff
  was a boy. His later attempts to reach his dad were ignored, then made
  impossible when Tim died of a heroin overdose at age 28 in 1975. Jeff harbored
  dark feelings afterwards, complicated further by the fact that music – his
  savior and muse – bound him inescapably to the man who abandoned him. Jeff’s
  path to a career in music has been chronicled endlessly elsewhere and it’s
  dutifully recalled in the film. Yet seldom, if ever, has the story had as
  caring a context as the one provided by the friends and lovers who spoke to
  Berg. They paint a portrait of someone whose insecurities and neurosis ran in
  tandem with his talent and daring. When Grace appeared and artists of the
  order of David Bowie and Robert Plant fell over themselves to praise him in
  interviews, Buckley buckled under the expectations of their awe. He was just
  as itchy about his anointment by People magazine as one of the “most
  beautiful” men alive. A girlfriend in the film recalls him buying every copy
  of the magazine he could get his hands on so he could throw them in the trash.
  Stark as the contrast may have been between his often ugly view of himself and
  the beauty of his outward appearance, there’s no denying the part it played in
  his myth. Like Jackson Browne, Buckley’s soulful brand of handsomeness ideally
  mirrored the sensitivity and refinement of his art. The man behind that face
  is presented here as someone simultaneously confused and playful, sweet and
  lost. For a fresh insight, friends tell Berg they think he may have been manic
  depressive, a term given little airing back in the 90s, when Buckley died by
  accidentally drowning in the Mississippi River. Another coup for the film is
  the inclusion of voicemails he left for his mother, including one in which he
  excoriates her for her deficiencies and another in which he honors her
  perseverance and unwavering love for him. Despite that support, friends say
  Buckley had no idea how to grow into a mature man. As deeply as that vexed
  him, his melding of genders in his art allowed him to live his short life with
  the androgynous freedom of a child. Today Buckley would be 58, an unimaginable
  age for someone whom fate has forced us to see as forever young. Now he exists
  solely on a plane he might well appreciate, where he’s less a person than a
  sound, a soul captured wholly in song. It’s Never Over: Jeff Buckley is out
  now in US cinemas
