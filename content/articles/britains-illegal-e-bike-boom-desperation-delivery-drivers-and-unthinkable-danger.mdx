  A busy Wednesday morning on Bishopsgate in London and Sgt Stuart Ford of the
  City of London police is pointing out possible offenders. “He’s not
  pedalling,” he says, indicating a man on a bike on the other side of the road.
  “Still not pedalling, but he is going downhill, he might be all right. I’d
  still pull him over and have a look.” Not today, though, because the
  non-pedalling possible offender is heading north, while Ford’s team – two
  members of the cycle response unit he set up two years ago and leads – are
  facing south on the opposite side of the road. A lot of the unit’s work
  centres on illegal e-bikes; they have seized 212 so far this year. News comes
  over the radio that PCs Harry Rose and David Parker have stopped someone they
  suspect is on an illegal e-bike, so we find them with a delivery rider in the
  familiar green livery of Uber Eats. The man, whose name is Mahede Hasan, says
  his bike has pedals, and the power of the electric motor is 250 watts, which
  he thought was allowed. Ford tilts the bike on its stand and twists the
  throttle on the right handlebar. “That’s illegal for a start,” he says. “You
  should pedal to make the motor work.” The bike doesn’t go anywhere, because
  the spinning back wheel is off the ground, but the speedometer climbs – 20,
  30, 40, 50, 52km/h. That’s about 32mph. “What do you think the top speed of
  this bike should be, with pedal assist?” he asks Hasan, who doesn’t know, so
  Ford tells him. “15.5mph [25km/h]. This is basically a motorcycle.” E-bikes
  aren’t illegal per se, and you will no doubt have noticed their increased
  popularity in UK cities, including the proliferation of rental ones (you might
  have views on them blocking pavements, or the fact that the ever-present
  background noise of urban Britain is the click click click of a kid on a
  stolen Lime bike, but that is a different issue). To be legal, which the
  rental bikes are, an e-bike needs to meet certain criteria. These include
  having pedals that can be used to drive the bike, an electric motor with a
  maximum power output of 250W, and a maximum assisted speed of 15.5mph. That
  doesn’t mean they can’t go faster, if you pedal hard or go downhill, just that
  the motor won’t help above that speed. Essentially, they’re bicycles with a
  bit of help, and that’s how they’re treated: you don’t need a licence,
  registration or insurance to ride one. The trouble is a lot of e-bikes aren’t
  legal to ride on the road, but they are very easy and cheap to get hold of.
  While the officers complete their paperwork, Hasan, 21, tells me he bought his
  bike new, on the internet, for £600. “I got it because I do, like, eight or
  nine hours a day, and if I’m only pedalling I’m going to get more tired. An
  e-bike makes it more comfortable.” Originally from Bangladesh, he has put a
  sticker showing a map of the country on the front mudguard. He assumed the
  bike was legal because there was nothing on the website he bought it from that
  said it wasn’t. “If it’s not, how do they sell it to people?” He says that if
  he’d known he was breaking the law, he wouldn’t have stopped when they pulled
  him over. The cycle response unit operates on pedal bikes. “I believe they
  wouldn’t catch me,” he says. The officers tell him they’re seizing the bike,
  and he asks if he can keep the detachable battery, which they allow, while he
  cancels the lunch order he was due to deliver. “It’s going to affect my
  account because when you accept a job, that means you’re committing to
  delivering to the customer. If you don’t, that’s your problem, not the
  company’s.” Back at Bishopsgate police station, Ford shows me the pound with
  some of the other bikes they’ve seized over the past few days (from here they
  get taken away to be crushed). There’s one that’s probably 500 or 750W. The
  pedals aren’t even connected to the chain to turn the wheel – it’s not even
  pretending to be a bicycle. Several have been converted from regular pedal
  bikes, using kits, also readily available. Again, not illegal in itself, so
  long as the motor is not bigger than 250W – you can generally tell from the
  size of the hub on the rear wheel. A few seconds on my phone, and I’ve found a
  3,000W conversion kit, made in China, that I can have delivered for £142.59. I
  can’t see anything about it being illegal to ride on the road in the UK. Ford
  estimates that about three-quarters of the illegal e-bikes they deal with are
  ridden by food delivery riders. They’re getting wise to the clampdown.
  “They’ll come down the road, see us, spin round, that’s usually a giveaway
  they’re on an illegal bike. We’ll then try to catch up with them if we can.”
  E-bikes – usually high-powered, ready-made ones – are also the vehicle of
  choice for gangs of phone snatchers, Ford adds: “Because they’re so quick, and
  they can’t be detected because they’ve got no licence plates and [if the
  riders are wearing helmets] you can’t see who they are.” What about the people
  who aren’t committing any other crimes, who just want to get around a bit
  quicker, most likely in order to make a half-decent wage? The issue is, says
  Ford, that these illegal e-bikes are in effect motorbikes. “These people have
  passed no test, have no road training and don’t have the road skills. They
  just get on and ride around without insurance, tax, the bike not conforming to
  lights and everything else it should conform to, it’s not registered with the
  DVLA, all these things.” Ford shows me another one they’ve just impounded; it
  looks more like a motorbike than a bicycle. He invites me to lift up one end
  to feel the weight of it. “Imagine if that hit you – or a child – at 30,
  40mph.” The fastest one they’ve seized was capable of 70mph. *** Christine
  White doesn’t know how fast the e-bike that hit her dad was going. On the
  morning of 6 July 2023, 91-year-old army veteran Jim Blackwood was sorting the
  bins outside his house in Rochester, Kent, when a man on an e-bike coming down
  the hill ran into him. White, who was staying with her parents at the time,
  ran out in her pyjamas. “Dad had managed to get up and was hanging on next
  door’s gate,” she tells me. It didn’t initially seem that bad – Jim had a
  scrape on his cheek and was bleeding from his finger. But in hospital they
  found he had internal injuries – a bleed on the brain and an artery in his
  kidney was ruptured. After an operation, there were more complications, a
  heart attack and infections. He ended up spending three months in hospital
  before being sent home for palliative care. He died on 13 October. Before the
  accident, Jim had been in great health. “I expected him to get to 100, no
  problem,” White says. The rider is now awaiting trial on charges of
  manslaughter and “causing bodily harm by wanton or furious driving”. He has
  not yet entered a plea. White thinks the way e-bikes are classified should be
  updated, even legal e-bikes (she doesn’t know if the one that hit her dad was
  legal or not). “For me, an e-bike is no different to a 50cc moped, except it’s
  electric rather than petrol-powered. The government has been far too slow to
  bring in proper regulations. They should need insurance, and a registration
  plate, be identifiable.” Her father had four grandchildren and seven
  great-grandchildren. She says her mum has trouble coming to terms with the
  fact that her husband, who served with the British army for 26 years, in
  Northern Ireland during the Troubles, and before that clearing mines in
  Malaysia, is no longer around. “Mum says he survived all that and then he gets
  killed outside his front door.” *** Fabian Hamilton, Labour MP for Leeds
  North, calls the danger posed by illegal e-bikes “a crisis hiding in plain
  sight”. He’s chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Cycling and
  Walking, which this summer published a report on the issue. Its findings
  highlighted a surge in battery fires caused by unregulated e-bike conversion
  kits, low-cost batteries and poor-quality imports. In 2023, the London fire
  brigade attended 179 incidents involving e-bike or e-scooter fires. That
  December, 28-year-old Mohsin Janjua died when his e-bike battery caught fire
  at his home in Bradford. The APPGCW report also highlights the online
  marketplaces selling unsafe products with little or no oversight, enforcement
  or legal liability. “It never ceases to amaze me that you can sell a product
  that is illegal to be used on the roads,” Hamilton tells me. He’s a big fan of
  legitimate e-bikes, and has a British-made folding one himself. “I love it.
  When I finish this call I’m going to get on my e-bike and ride home. It will
  never catch fire because it is properly designed and has proper battery
  management systems.” And if he’s rushing home, at 15.5mph the electrical
  assistance will cut out. “I do go faster than that, but by using the muscles
  in my legs.” It cost £1,600 – cheaper than the equivalent Brompton, he says,
  but almost certainly not in Mahede Hasan’s price range. The exploitation of
  gig-economy riders, who are incentivised to use faster, illegal bikes to meet
  delivery targets, is also underlined in the report. “Deliveroo has been sold
  for £2.9bn to an American conglomerate [a takeover by rival company DoorDash],
  and that’s off the back of the most shocking exploitation of some of these
  riders, most of whom daren’t give their names because they’re in the country
  illegally,” says Hamilton. “What happens, I’m told, is that people who pay
  people smugglers to get into this country are told they can pay the money back
  by taking this job for the next three years and earning their way back out of
  it. So it’s even worse for them, because they don’t even get to keep the
  paltry amount they get paid for the deliveries that they make, which they have
  to do illegally. It’s a circle, isn’t it? And you’ve got to break that circle
  somewhere.” He compares it to what was going on in the 19th century. “When the
  Factory Acts were passed, MPs said we’re going to need to have inspectors to
  enforce them or they’ll just be ignored by the exploiters. So they introduced
  the Factory Inspectorate, which stopped children being exploited in factories
  to earn vast profits for the owners. This is a new form of industrial
  revolution where the most vulnerable are being exploited but now they’re
  foreigners, people who have come here for asylum or economic migration.”
  Hamilton, and the report, call for a number of things: for online retailers to
  withdraw unsafe e-bikes from sale; making retailers legally accountable for
  unsafe listings; ending the loophole that allows them to be sold under the
  guise of off-road use; and a safety Kitemark for legal bikes. Additionally, it
  calls for enforcing compliance from delivery companies, requiring them to run
  checks on the bikes used by couriers; and rights and protections for
  gig-economy riders. *** Celestino Pereira, originally from Brazil, came to the
  UK – legally – in 2019, and began working in London as a rider for Deliveroo.
  “You only need a phone and a bicycle, just show the number and pick up the
  order, no need to speak English, so it was good for me.” Pereira began on a
  pedal bike, but found it impossible to make the minimum wage, so when he had
  enough money he got an e-bike – a road-legal one, for about £500 – and was
  initially able to get a few more orders. But three weeks after getting it, the
  e-bike was stolen outside a block of flats in south London. That’s when he
  decided to give up on e-bikes. He thinks the legal ones aren’t suited to
  real-world working conditions. “Many models don’t allow for battery
  replacements, so riders have to sit idle for hours, waiting to recharge. When
  replacement batteries are an option, they are so expensive.” Pereira got a
  petrol moped, which meant he had to do CBT (compulsory basic training), have a
  licence, get insurance, all of which cost him money. He estimates that about
  70% of food delivery riders in London are on illegal e-bikes, and he
  understands why. “They’re cheaper than legal ones and are faster, so you can
  complete more orders, and they can have more batteries so you don’t have to
  stop to recharge.” Pereira estimates that now, with his moped, he makes about
  £11 an hour. He knows people who are struggling to make seven or eight pounds.
  “The companies have no interest in the wellbeing of the workers, it’s about
  minimising the costs and maximising returns.” As soon as his son is old enough
  to go to and from school on his own, he will try to find other work, he says.
  A Deliveroo spokesperson says: “We take our responsibilities regarding road
  safety in the communities we operate in very seriously. All riders are
  provided with road safety information when they join, and we have a number of
  partnerships in place to give riders access to safe and affordable e-bike
  rentals. We will investigate and stop working with the rider if they are in
  breach of their obligations to follow the rules of the road. “Each rider has a
  minimum guaranteed rate of pay of £12.30 an hour for the period on an order,
  but in practice most orders pay more than this. An Uber Eats spokesperson
  says: “Uber Eats is fully committed to tackling illegal work and the criminal
  networks who are often behind it. We have taken a number of steps, including
  introducing state-of-the-art identity and document-video verification
  technology, but we are constantly reviewing our tools and finding new ways to
  make sure that everyone on our platform has the right to work.” *** And so
  back to Hasan, now speaking to me a couple of weeks later from the flat he
  shares with his parents in east London. His seized bike will probably have
  been crushed by now. He was also fined £300 and given six points on his
  driving licence. Again, he stresses that he didn’t know the bike was illegal,
  and can’t understand how online platforms are allowed to sell them. He also
  questions the £300 fine. “The first time, if people don’t know, they should
  give you a warning.” Hasan has got another e-bike; he needs to work. This one
  is legal, he was assured at the shop: 250W, 15.5mph limit, no throttle. It
  cost £900, he’s paying in instalments, and it’s going to take a while. Hasan
  says he makes £50-60 for an eight- or nine-hour shift. “On a busy day,
  sometimes £70. In a week I can make £350.” He hasn’t got a Bangladesh sticker
  for the new bike’s front mudguard yet, but he does have something to look
  forward to: he’s heading there at the end of the month to see his wife. They
  married in 2023, but she can’t join him in the UK. “Unless you earn good
  money, you cannot bring your spouse. You have to be earning nearly £30,000,
  and you can’t earn this money doing a delivery job.” There’s a reason illegal
  e-bikes are illegal: they’re dangerous – to other people on the road, to
  pedestrians, often to the riders themselves. Still, looking at the bigger
  picture – of an industry that exploits vulnerable people while making huge
  profits, and online marketplaces that sell unsafe products with no liability
  or retribution – it’s hard to see a 21-year-old from Bangladesh, struggling to
  make the minimum wage, as the bad guy in this story.
