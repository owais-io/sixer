  An artificial intelligence tool designed to speed up the discharge of patients
  is being trialled at a hospital trust in London. The platform completes
  documents needed to send fit patients home, potentially saving hours of delays
  and freeing up beds. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, said the tech will
  enable doctors to spend less time on paperwork and more time focused on care,
  cutting waiting times in the process. The platform, which is being piloted at
  Chelsea and Westminster NHS trust, extracts information from medical records,
  including diagnoses and test results. This helps medics to draft discharge
  summaries, which have to be completed before a person is sent home from
  hospital. The document is then reviewed by healthcare professionals
  responsible for the patient and used to send them home or refer them to other
  services. The manual system can sometimes leave patients waiting for hours to
  be discharged, as doctors may be too busy to fill in forms, the Department for
  Science, Innovation and Technology said. Streeting said: “This potentially
  transformational discharge tool is a prime example of how we’re shifting from
  analogue to digital as part of our 10-year health plan. “We’re using
  cutting-edge technology to build an NHS fit for the future and tackle the
  hospital backlogs that have left too many people waiting too long. “Doctors
  will spend less time on paperwork and more time with patients, getting people
  home to their families faster and freeing up beds for those who need them
  most.” The tool will be hosted on the NHS Federated Data Platform (FDP), a
  software system aiming to make it easier for health and care organisations to
  work together and provide better services to patients. In January, Keir
  Starmer, the prime minister, said AI will be used to “turn around” the economy
  and public services. Elsewhere, the government has announced that technology
  shown to halve the time probation officers spend organising notes will be
  launched later this year. The system helps to transcribe and take notes in
  meetings that probation officers have with offenders after they leave prison.
  AI is also being trialled across the NHS. The technology will analyse hospital
  databases and catch potential safety scandals early, providing an early
  warning system which could detect patterns or trends and trigger urgent
  inspections. The first NHS AI-run physiotherapy clinic halved the waiting list
  for back pain and musculoskeletal services. More than 2,500 patients living in
  Cambridgeshire and Peterborough were able to access Flok Health, a
  physiotherapy app, over a 12-week period starting in February. And the NHS in
  England is trialling a “superhuman” AI tool that predicts a patient’s risk of
  disease and dying early. Speaking on a visit to Chelsea and Westminster
  hospital, the technology secretary, Peter Kyle, said: “This is exactly the
  kind of change we need, AI being used to give doctors, probation officers and
  other key workers more time to focus on delivering better outcomes and
  speeding up vital services. “This government inherited a public sector
  decimated by years of underinvestment and is crying out for reform. “These AI
  exemplars show the best ways in which we’re using tech to build a smarter,
  more efficient state. “When we get this right across government, we’re talking
  about unlocking £45bn in productivity gains, delivering our plan for change
  and investing in growth, not bureaucracy.”
