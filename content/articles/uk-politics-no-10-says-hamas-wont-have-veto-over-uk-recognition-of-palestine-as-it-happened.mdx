  Downing Street has urged people not to take part in a protest in support of
  the banned group Palestine Action as police warned they would arrest anyone
  breaking terrorism laws. Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, has announced
  that the police and creim. e commissioner for Leicestershire and Rutland has
  defected to his party from the Conservatives. (See 11.15am.) At his latest
  summer news conference on the topic of crime, he also said the police should
  release information about the immigration status of people who are charged
  with crimes. Kate Forbes, Scotland’s deputy first minister, has said she will
  step down as an MSP at next year’s Holyrood elections. (See 10.56am.) The
  Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, is not telling the truth about the “real
  failures of 14 years of Conservative government”, the former Conservative
  prime minister Liz Truss has said. Napier barracks, one of the first mass
  accommodation sites opened to house asylum seekers, will not be closing as
  planned in the coming weeks, as the government attempts to deal with an influx
  of small boats arrivals. The UK has been left behind in the cryptocurrency
  boom and is in danger of missing a second wave of demand, according to the
  former chancellor George Osborne. For a full list of all the stories covered
  on the blog today, do scroll through the list of key event headlines near the
  top of the blog. Mhari Aurora from Sky News was the reporter who asked Nigel
  Farage at his press conference this morning the question that prompted him to
  reply with the claim that she would not dare to walk through London after 9pm
  wearing jewellery. (See 11.49m.) In an article for Sky’s website, she says
  that he is wrong. I am not afraid to walk in the West End of London after 9pm
  wearing jewellery. I have done it many times before and will continue to do so
  … but perhaps that is because I do not own a Rolex. But she says that does not
  mean she is not concerned about the risk of being a victim of crime, and she
  says that Farage is “tapping into” concerns that voters have. According to
  police reports, thefts from a person in London are almost five times the
  national average, and they’ve been going up since the pandemic. And the Office
  for National Statistics (ONS) also notes that thefts outside of the home, eg
  phone snatching, has increased. However, possession of weapons has fallen in
  London by 29% over the last three years. And according to the ONS, crime in
  England and Wales is 30% lower than in 2015, and 76% lower than 1995 … In
  short, am I right to be more worried that snatch theft and knife crime in
  London is increasing? Yes, and no. But Nigel Farage is tapping into voters’
  emotions - their feelings that the country is broken … And the more
  politicians of all colours tell voters that “the system is broken”, the more
  voters might start to believe them. Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, does
  not take a strong interest in transgender isssues but in its manifesto at the
  election the party attacked “transgender indoctrination” and “baseless
  transgender ideology”, leaving it fairly clear where the party stands on these
  issues. That’s why, in its report this morning about Vanessa Frake joining the
  party as an adviser, the Times pointed out that Frake, a former prison
  governor, did not support a banket ban on trans women being placed in women’s
  prisons. At his press conference this morning Farage was asked if he agreed.
  Whereas with most of his answers Farage was keen to lean into rightwing
  opinion (and then some), on this, perhaps mindful of the need not to embarrass
  his new recruit, Farage backed her up. He said one problem with government is
  that ministers often have no experience of the issues for which they are
  responsible. He went on: “I personally have never worked in a prison, so I
  can’t answer it.” But he said Frake had worked in prisons at the highest
  level, and that she thought it was all about risk assessment. Frake, who was
  at the press conference, agreed. She said everyone in prison “deserves to be
  treated with humanity and decency, and that includes female prisoners and it
  includes trans prisoners”. Prisons were used to dealing with issues like this
  by carrying out risk assessments, she said. In response Kemi Badenoch, who
  unlike Farage does have a close interest in this issue, posted a clip of the
  Farage answer on social media with a message saying: A reminder that
  @Conservatives are the ONLY party standing up for women-only spaces. After the
  Supreme Court judgment, we shouldn’t be hearing anymore about men being put in
  women’s prisons. Yet here we are. As usual, Reform have not done their
  homework and will make a big mess. Vanessa Frake, the former prison govenor
  who is now a Reform UK adviser, has also disagreed with some of her new
  colleagues about male police officers being more reassuring than female ones.
  At a press conference two weeks ago Nigel Farage, the party leader, said he
  would like people to feel a bit intimidated by police officers. Following up
  on this, Sarah Pochin, the Reform MP and justice spokesperson for the party,
  told the BBC: I never feel comfortable actually seeing two female officers
  together. I’d much rather see a great big strapping male police officer with a
  female. Today, asked if she agreed with these comments, Frake told Times Radio
  agree: I disagree. I’ve seen police officers and I’ve seen prison officers,
  females. And, you know, that’s Nigel’s opinion. As I said, I’m not going to
  agree with him all the time. And I’m sure he’s not going to agree with me all
  the time. Vanessa Frake, the former prison govenor who announced today she is
  joining Reform UK as an adviser, was critical of the government when she
  appeared alongside Nigel Farage at their press conference this morning. (See
  11.29am.) But she was a bit more positive last year. After the election, when
  Keir Starmer appointed James Timpson as prisons minister, Frake described that
  as a “stroke of genius” because of Timpson’s record working with ex-offenders.
  In the same interview last year, Frake also she would like to see more
  non-violent offenders serving sentences in the community, and not in jail –
  something Labour is pursuing through its sentencing review. Frake will be
  contributing to the Reform’s law and order taskforce. Keir Starmer is now
  all-but-certain to recognise Palestine as a state in September. Last week he
  said this would happen unless Israel complied with certain conditions,
  including committing to a two-state solution. Given that Benjamin Netanyahu,
  the Israeli PM, said last week this would involve Israel having to accept a
  “jihadist state”, it seems fair to assume that Israel will not comply (unless
  the Netanyahu government is replaced with a very different one in the next few
  weeks, which is also not plausible). Starmer also set out requirements for
  Hamas. But the government has confirmed that these are not formal conditions,
  implying Palestinian state recognition will go ahead even if all the hostages
  have not been released. But the government has not admitted this explicitly
  and, at the Downing Street lobby briefing this morning, asked if the UK might
  recognise the state of Palestine if hostages were still being held, the No 10
  spokesperson just said “we’ll make an assessment ahead of Unga [the United
  Nations general assembly in September] on how far the parties have met the
  steps that we’ve set out.” Asked whether a Palestinian state could be
  recognised with Hamas still in government, the spokesman also said that Hamas
  would not get a “veto” over UK recognition of Palestine. He said: We’ve been
  very clear that Hamas can have no role in the future governments of Gaza …
  We’ve also been clear that they must disarm, must release all the hostages.
  We’ve also been clear that Hamas are not the Palestinian people, and it is the
  inalienable right of the Palestinian people to have recognition along the
  lines and the steps that we’ve previously set out. We’ve also been very clear
  it cannot be in the hands of Hamas, a terrorist group, to have a veto over
  recognition of Palestine. John Swinney, the SNP leader and Scottish first
  minister, has paid tribute to Kate Forbes following her announcement that she
  will leave Holyrood at the elections next year. (See 10.56am.) In an open
  letter to her, Swinney said: I have deeply valued the contribution you have
  made to the work of the Scottish National party and the Scottish government
  and am pleased we will continue to benefit from that in the approach to the
  May 2026 elections. You have made a huge contribution to public life in
  Scotland and have been instrumental in making progress on economic issues for
  my government. You have much to be proud of in all of the work you have
  undertaken but I am especially heartened by the effect of your leadership on
  advancing support for the Gaelic language. We all wrestle with the inevitable
  conflicts between family and public life and I sympathise with the dilemmas
  you have faced. I wish you, Ali and your family well and much happiness in the
  years ahead. In her own tribute, Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour’s deputy
  leader, thanks Forbes for her service as an MSP. She went on: Of course, as
  much as being an MSP is a privilege, it is also a demanding job which can make
  for a difficult balance between our working and personal lives. In that
  spirit, I wish Kate all the very best in her future endeavours and hope that
  she can enjoy spending time with her family. But it cannot have escaped the
  notice of voters that many of the SNP’s former rising stars are abandoning the
  stage, often to be replaced by defeated names of yesteryears and anonymous
  party apparatchiks. Kate Forbes was the future once - but now, like many of
  her counterparts in the SNP, she can see the writing on the wall. The truth is
  this is a tired government with no vision and no ideas. And Alex
  Cole-Hamilton, the Scottish Lib Dem leader, said his party would be fighting
  hard to win Forbes’s constituency, Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch. He said: Kate
  and I were both elected to the Scottish parliament in 2016 and there have been
  several occasions when we’ve worked well together on shared interests since. I
  wish her family well for everything that comes next. This is a top target seat
  for the Scottish Liberal Democrats, having won the equivalent seat at
  Westminster last year. We’re campaigning hard to fix the care crisis, to cut
  your energy bills, and for better local healthcare having recently secured the
  replacement for the Belford Hospital in the Scottish budget. In their response
  to the Nigel Farage press conference, the Liberal Democrats focused on the
  defection of a Tory police and crime commissioner. (See 11.15am.) A Lib Dem
  source said: Elected Conservatives are becoming more and more like UFOs
  themselves - they’re rarely if ever seen, and most people don’t believe in
  them. Never mind life on Mars, it’s unclear if there’s life in the
  Conservative Party. Time for Kemi Badenoch to admit that her plan to mimic
  Nigel Farage and drag the Conservatives further to the right isn’t working.
  This is a reference to the fact that Rupert Matthews, the police and crime
  commissioner for Leicestershire and Rutland who has defected from the Tories
  to Reform UK, has written books about UFOs and the paranormal. In a post on
  Bluesky Sunder Katwala, director of the British Future thinktank, points out
  that, with his press conference answer about sending Afghan asylum seekers
  back to Afghanistan (see 11.53am), Nigel Farage seemed to forget his own
  party’s policy. Nigel Farage would simply send Afghan asylum seekers back to
  Afghanistan. Has he now forgotten that his current policy (bluff) is that he
  can simply return asylum seekers in boats to France, without permission Labour
  and the Conservatives have both criticised Nigel Farage this morning for not
  being able to give details of Reform UK policies. In particularly, they
  focused on what he said when asked how Reform would pay for new prisons. (See
  11.57am.) In a statement, Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said: Reform
  are doodling fantasy prisons on the back of a pub napkin. Once again Nigel
  Farage has made wild promises to the British public but completely failed to
  set out how he intends to pay for any of them. Empty words, zero plan, and not
  a shred of credibility. And Labour issued a statement from a party
  spokesperson saying: Nigel Farage offers anger, but no answers. It’s farcical
  that Farage can’t say what his policies are, how much they would cost, or how
  they would even work. Reform aren’t serious and don’t have a clue as to how
  they would address the challenges facing working people. This is what Farage
  said during the press conference when it was put to him that the supermax
  prisions his new prisons adviser seemed to be proposing would be particularly
  expensive. He said: This is week three of the campaign. We laid out very
  clearly a plan. I was asked [at a previous press conference] about the cost of
  that plan, to which I said, how can we afford not to do this? Now the supermax
  prisons – have we costed it, have we thought it through? It’s a debate. The
  point about this taskforce is we’re starting a debate, and we’d rather like it
  to become a full public debate too. Vanessa Frake, the former prison governor
  who is now advising the party, said she was not calling for new US-style
  supermax prisons in her opening remarks. She said she was calling for the use
  of supermax regimes, which she said could be implemented “relatively easily”.
  (See 11.17am.) The UK has been left behind in the cryptocurrency boom and is
  in danger of missing a second wave of demand, according to George Osborne, the
  former chancellor. Dan Milmo has the story. Severin Carrell is the Guardian’s
  Scotland editor. Kate Forbes’s surprise decision to quit frontline Scottish
  politics next May inevitably raises questions about what this means for the
  next Scottish National party leadership contest and for the pro-independence
  movement. John Swinney, the incumbent first minister and party leader, has
  insisted he plans to stay in post long after next year’s Holyrood election,
  quashing speculation his goal is solely to save the SNP from imploding and to
  secure a fifth term in power. That promise presupposes the SNP will win next
  May’s election and that he wins handsomely; Scottish Labour’s collapsing poll
  ratings suggests for now that that is likely. But whether Swinney would stay
  on for a full five year term is another question. And if Forbes is no longer
  in the running, who might the contenders be? Swinney faces a potential
  challenger in the shape of Stephen Flynn, the SNP’s hyper-ambitious
  Westminster leader, who is standing for election to Holyrood in May, and
  ousted the former SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford in a coup. However,
  many see Swinney’s housing secretary Màiri McAllan, who recently returned to
  the cabinet after taking maternity leave, as his heir apparent. A very able
  minister, she has the conspicuous advantage of having a powerful coterie of
  allies in cabinet – mostly women ministers close to Nicola Sturgeon. Swinney
  was openly dismissive of Flynn’s potential challenge when he was asked about
  it after he unveiled the SNP’s slate of Holyrood candidates some months ago –
  an event where McAllan was prominent and Flynn absent. However, Flynn, an
  Aberdeen MP closely allied to Alex Salmond’s former aides, who trades in what
  he sees as a robustly realist defence of North Sea oil and gas jobs, has a
  power base too in the wider party. If he becomes prominent in a post-election
  SNP government, Swinney will face pressure to give him a ministerial role, and
  that will then put serious strains on any putative partnership with the
  pro-independence Scottish Greens at Holyrood. Like their sister party in
  England and Wales, the Scottish Greens are embroiled in a live leadership
  contest. Depending on the result in May, Swinney’s fortunes could well hinge
  on Green cooperation, and they, for now, are his best bet to hold onto power.
  Q: Are you worried that some of the comments made by George Finch earlier
  might prejudice a future trial, putting a conviction at risk? (This is a
  reference to comments that I did not report here, when covering Finch at
  11.36am, because some of what said did seem to pose a contempt of court risk.)
  Farage said he was not concerned about this. He claimed that Finch was just
  expressing the concerns felt by Warwickshire residents. “If that means he was
  slightly emotional, well, you know what, good,” Farage said. Q: What is your
  response to Neil Kinnock urging the government to put VAT on private
  healthcare? Farage said that was the sort of idea that would encourage even
  more wealthy people to leave the country. There was already an exodus, he
  claimed. In an interview with the i, Kinnock, the former Labour leader, said:
  Introducing VAT on private health provision could provide vital funding for
  the NHS and social care. After 14 years of underinvestment, many people are
  turning to private healthcare not out of choice, but because they cannot
  afford to wait. This has increasingly led to unequal access to care. Ending
  the VAT exemption to generate much-needed revenue is a reasonable and widely
  supported step. Q: What is your response to the report about Labour using Hope
  Not Hate analysis of Reform UK voters, even though Hope Not Hate label Reform
  as “far right”. Farage said this was “moronic”. And he claimed Labour would
  find it hard to profile Reform support because, of all the parties, it had the
  greatest spread of support, geographically and in terms of age, faith and
  ethnicity. Q: Keir Starmer is reportedly interested in introducing digital ID
  cards, partly to tackle illegal immigration. Would you back that? Farage said
  that was a Blairite idea. “I’m sure that Tony Blair would have us all
  microchipped,” he said. He went on: No, I don’t support it. I don’t trust big
  government. If you want to see why my trust in government doesn’t exist, just
  think about what’s happened in the space of the last week, where they
  introduced legislation they tell you is purely to protect children [the Online
  Safety Act], and actually it is having a terrible effect on free speech and
  democracy. I would not trust this government with digital ID, I have to say, I
  didn’t particularly enjoy the vaccine passport phase that we lived through. As
  for the argument, it’ll stop crime, it’ll stop illegal immigration, it’ll stop
  illegal working, well, I don’t think digital ID will stop teenage girls being
  raped, I don’t think digital ID will stop the drugs gangs, I don’t think
  digital ID will stop illegal working. Q: Have you discussed your concerns
  about the Online Safety Act with the US vice president, JD Vance? Farage
  claimed he could not remember. Q: Will Reform UK councillors block the use of
  HMOs (houses in multiple occcupation) to house asylum seekers? Farage said
  that was “absolutely” the position of Reform councillors. In some ways, the
  use of HMOs by asylum seekers was “even worse” than the use of hotels. Finch
  said that in Warwickshire he wanted to be able to tell residents where HMOs
  housing migrants were. He claimed not being able to do this was “dangerous”
  and “against safeguarding”. He also claimed this was “a huge problem for the
  children in Warwickshire”. Q: Since you have been running a campaign linking
  sexual crimes with migration, are you picking up more support from women?
  Farage replied: I do think one of the things that’s happened over the course
  of the last few weeks is, without doubt, we’re definitely seeing, not just
  high profile women coming to Reform – and you’ve seen one or two of those on
  the stage here and in Wales over the course of the last few weeks – but I
  think generally out there there is grave concern, particularly amongst
  mothers, about their teenagers, whether they can let them out. So perhaps this
  issue has spoken the truth to people that they’ve been feeling increasingly
  for some time. And I think that may be that changing the complexion of how
  people view Reform. When I came back into this last June, people regarded it
  as being a bit of a blokeish party - something to do my reputation, I can’t
  quite think why. But I think that’s changing and changing very rapidly. This
  campaign is very much a part of that. Q: Vanessa Frake is calling for supermax
  prisons. [See 11.29am.] But they are the most expensive prisons to build. How
  are you going to afford that? Farage says he is only at the start of this
  campaign. He suggests it is too early for the party to have full details.
  Frake says she was not calling for supermax prisons. She was calling for a
  supermax regime in some prisons. That could be implemented “relatively easy”,
  she says. UPDATE: See 1.22pm for the full Farage quote. Q: Where should people
  be deported to if they come from a country that is not safe? Farage replies:
  Sorry. I’ve had enough of this. If you come from Afghanistan, you go back to
  Afghanistan. End of. This idea, we can’t send people to certain countries, all
  the false claims that people make about their own personal lives – I’m sorry.
  We’re done. We’re done. We’ve had enough. Q: Are you trying to make people
  afraid, to get them to vote for you? Farage replies: No, they are afraid. They
  are afraid. I dare you to walk through the West End of London after nine
  o’clock of an evening wearing jewellery. You wouldn’t do it. You know that I’m
  right. You wouldn’t do it, and that’s just in London – let alone what’s
  happening in so many other parts of the country, and the genuine fears.
  Linking this to immigration, he claims there are “some people who come from
  certain cultures that pose a danger to our society”. This is the contested
  claim raised by Robert Jenrick this morning. (See 9.53am.) Farage is now
  taking questions. Asked what Reform UK would do to stop the small boat
  crossings, Farage dismissed today’s Home Office announcement about £100m being
  spent on more officers. (See 10.48am.) He said the UK had already given £800m
  to France to address the problem. But the boats were still coming. He said
  people were still arriving because they knew they had a “99% chance of
  staying”. He said the only effective solution would be to turn people away
  when they arrived. That is what Australia did, he said. He said: If you enter
  a country illegally, you will be detained and deported. This is what normal
  countries do all over the world. We’ve surrendered normality to this new human
  rights regime. George Finch, the Reform UK leader of Warwickshire county
  council, goes next. (Aged 19, he is the youngest council leader in the
  country.) He claims the police have opposed his attempts to expose the
  immigration status of someone arrested in connection with an alleged crime.
  Colin Sutton, a former police officer who is now advising Reform UK on crime,
  introduces the next speaker – Vanessa Frake, a former prison governor and
  author of the memoir, The Governor. Frake says when she went to Wormwood
  Scrubs, she was assigned the task of cleaning up D wing, where the lifers were
  based. It was dirty, run down and had major drug issues. My attitude to the
  task was assertive and no nonsense. That’s the approach that I will take for
  my role within Reform UK [advising on crime]. She says the public have lost
  faith in how prisons are run. Assaults on staff are up, drug use is up, and
  thousands of offenders are being released early, she says. She says the
  government has “appeased prisoners” who have been allowed to cook their own
  food. This has led to attacks on staff, she says. She says she wants a
  “tougher prison regime for prisoners who will never be rehabilitated”, based
  on the supermax prisons in the US. But, for prisoners who will be released,
  she wants more focus on rehabilition, she says. UPDATE: I updated the headline
  after Frake said (at 11.57am) that she was proposing having a supermax regime
  in prisons for the most serious offenders, not building new supermax jails.
  Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, introduces a defector. It is Rupert
  Matthews, the police and crime commissioner for Leicestershire and Rutland. He
  was elected to that post as a Conservative in 2021. Before that he was a Tory
  MEP. Matthews claims the police are “fighting crime with one hand tied behind
  their back”. He goes on: The courts impose sentences that too often are
  derisory and Labour’s early release scheme means that crooks are back out
  after serving a fraction of their time in prison. Now it’s all because our
  prisons are full. They’re full of foreign criminals who should be deported the
  day they are convicted, not kept here at the expense of British taxpayers.
  It’s no wonder that criminals do not fear the justice system, no wonder that
  the law abiding have almost given up on reporting crimes, and our wonderful
  police officers are let down even by their own senior commanders. The Reform
  UK press conference is starting now. There is a live feed here. Severin
  Carrell is the Guardian’s Scotland editor. Kate Forbes, Scotland’s deputy
  first minister and previous Scottish National party leadership contender, has
  announced she is quitting Holyrood at the next election. The news will shock
  her party. Forbes has long been regarded by centrists in the party as a
  potential leader and was a favourite of many business leaders and SNP MSPs
  aligned with former leader Alex Salmond. She said she had reflected over the
  recess about whether to stand again at next May’s Scottish parliamentary
  election, but had decided to put her young family first. In a statement she
  said: I have grown up in the public eye, getting married, having a baby and
  raising a young family. I have consistently put the public’s needs ahead of my
  family’s during that time. I am grateful to them for accommodating the heavy
  demands of being a political figure. Looking ahead to the future, I do not
  want to miss any more of the precious early years of family life – which can
  never be rewound. But her statement left open the possibility she may stand
  again at a later date, emphasising she did not wish “to seek re-election for
  another five-year term in the Scottish parliament”. Her decision to quit now
  will also spare Forbes of the challenge of deciding whether or not to contest
  the leadership again if Swinney quits after the 2026 election; many see the
  housing secretary Màiri McAllan as the favourite to succeed him. An MSP in the
  Highlands, Forbes came close to winning the leadership and becoming first
  minister after Nicola Sturgeon stood down in February 2023, following one of
  the most turbulent and combative campaigns of recent party history. Forbes
  openly attacked many of Sturgeon’s landmark policies on social inclusion and
  accused her closest rival Humza Yousaf of incompetence, with the contest
  exposing significant strains with their pro-independence partners the Scottish
  Green party. An active member of the socially conservative Free Church of
  Scotland, which does not admit women as church ministers, she was accused in
  turn of taking regressive stances on abortion rights, equal marriage and the
  climate crisis. After Yousaf’s period as first minister and party leadership
  ended suddenly following his disastrous decision to abandon a coalition with
  the Greens, Forbes was brought back in to serve as deputy first minister by
  John Swinney as he sought to steady the ship. Forbes said she enjoyed the
  privilege of becoming a minister for public finance, then as cabinet secretary
  for finance (a post she was given at extremely short notice after the then
  finance secretary quit on the eve of a budget) and most recently as deputy
  first minister and cabinet secretary for economy and Gaelic. Angela Eagle, the
  Home Office minister, was giving interviews this morning to promote government
  plans to spend £100m hiring up to 300 extra National Crime Agency officers.
  Here is the Home Office press release, and Rajeev Syal has written the story
  up here. As Rajeev says, this was the third Home Office announcement on this
  topic within 24 hours, following confirmation of plans plans to introduce a
  new offence for advertising irregular small boat crossings and plans to
  fast-track the processing of asylum applications. Today the Times reports
  that, as part of the measures to limit asylum applications, the Home Office
  will penalise universities that accept foreign students who are primarily
  motivated by the desire to claim asylum in the UK. In their story Matt Dathan
  and Aubrey Allegretti report: As part of a fresh government crackdown,
  universities will be penalised if fewer than 95 per cent of international
  students accepted on to a course start their studies, or fewer than 90 per
  cent continue to the end. Institutions that accept foreign students will face
  sanctions if more than 5 per cent of their visas are rejected. The plans,
  which are expected to be announced next month, are designed to prevent the
  growing numbers of foreign nationals using study visas to enter the UK and
  then claim asylum. Dathan and Allegretti also say Yvette Cooper, the home
  secretary, is expected to sign the “one in, one out” returns deal with France,
  allowing around 50 small boat arrivals to be returned to France every week in
  exchange for the UK accepting an equal number of asylum applicants from
  France, on Wednesday. According to Mahri Aurora from Sky News, Reform UK will
  announce a defection at their press conference. NEW: Reform UK are holding a
  press conference at 11am today in which they will unveil a defection from the
  Tory party. They will also introduce former prison governor Vanessa Frake MBE
  as their new justice adviser. The press conference will be held with them as
  well as Farage and the Reform Warwickshire County Council leader George Finch.
  In her interviews this morning Angela Eagle, the minister for border security
  and asylum, was asked what her message was to people who have been protesting
  outside hotels used to house asylum seekers. She told Sky News: Anger doesn’t
  get you anywhere. What we have to do is recognise the values we have in this
  country, the rule of law we have in this country, the work we’re doing with
  the police to protect people. We will close asylum hotels by the end of the
  parliament. We’ll do it faster if we can. And she told Times Radio: Those who
  are worried and demonstrating have an absolute right to do that, so long as
  they do it peacefully. People don’t have a right to then have a pop at the
  police, which has been happening in some isolated cases outside hotels. Kemi
  Badenoch, is not telling the truth about the “real failures of 14 years of
  Conservative government”, the former Conservative prime minister Liz Truss has
  said. Kevin Rawlinson has the story. Good morning. During August, when
  parliament is not sitting and the tap of domestic news is running dry,
  opposition parties often like to run campaigns. Nigel Farage, the Reform UK
  leader, is following this model with gusto and today, for the third week in a
  row, he is holding a press conference on the subject of crime. Reform’s
  success in the polls is almost entirely down to the fact it advocates hardline
  policies to cut immigration and small boat crossings and Farage is trying
  explicitly to link this issue to crime, arguing that asylum seekers are
  disproportionately likely to be criminal. The Conservative party don’t have a
  single theme for their summer campaigning. (Yesterday Kemi Badenoch was
  campaigning about the uselessness of the Liz Truss mini-budget, a topic where
  the nation largely agrees.) But in response to an overnight announcement from
  the government about new measures to crack down on small boat crossings, they
  have also been depicting these migrants (whose numbers, of course, increased
  dramatically while they were in office) as a threat to public safety. In a
  statement released overnight Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said:
  “This weak Labour government has lost control of our borders, and we now see
  rapes and sexual assaults by illegal immigrants reported on a near daily
  basis.” And, in an interview on the Today programme this morning, Robert
  Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, doubled down on this claim. He said: I
  am afraid there is increasing evidence of a serious link between illegal
  migration, migration generally, and crime, particularly sexual crime against
  women and girls. In London, 40% last year of all of the sexual crimes were
  committed by foreign nationals, despite the fact that they only make up 25% of
  the population. And some of the data that – we’re seeing we don’t have good
  data at the moment – some of the data we’re seeing is very striking. Afghans
  and Eritrean nationals are 20 times more likely to be convicted of a sexual
  crime than a British national. These are very shocking statistics. Farage
  recently told the New Statesman, for an interesting, lengthy profile written
  by Harry Lambert, that he thought Jenrick would “almost certainly” end up to
  the right of him on migration by the next election. “I suspect he will
  probably go further – that’s just my instinct for someone who wants to make
  noise,” Farage said. Angela Eagle, the minister for border security and
  asylum, has been giving interviews this morning, and on the Today programme
  she suggested that there was not firm data to back up the claims that Jenrick
  was making. She said: [Jenrick] did actually say that we don’t have good data
  at the moment, and yet he’s asserting with great certainty data points, and I
  don’t know where he’s got them from. So it’s difficult for me to criticise
  from a data point of view. But he’s admitted in that interview that we don’t
  have good data. Asked if she thought that the Tories were “playing with fire”
  by linking asylum seekers with sexual crime, Eagle replied: I think that we
  need to deal with all crimes, all sexual crimes, regardless of who has
  perpetrated them in the same way. And we need to crack down on violence
  against women and girls, which is why we’ve actually got Jess Phillips, a
  minister, whose entire job is about doing that. Asked if she was open to
  discussing possible links between immigration and crime, Eagle replied: I
  don’t mind having debates about anything, but I think we haven’t got good data
  on this, and I think that we’ve got to look at the principle. And that is that
  we’ve got to deal with all sexual criminality, whoever perpetrates it, in an
  almost colour blind way. If a girl has been abused by somebody or has been
  subjected to a vile sexual crime, it doesn’t really matter what the colour of
  the skin of the perpetrator is. As Eagle said, it is hard to assess the truth
  about the link between immigration and crime because the data is complicated,
  and in some respects limited. But one person who has tried is the researcher
  and scientist Emma Monk. On her Substack blog she recently published an
  analysis of the claim that some people arriving in the UK on small boats are
  20 times more likely than Britons to be criminal. This is a claim that Jenrick
  referenced, describing it as “shocking”. Monk argues that it is shockingly
  inaccurate – or “ludicrous on multiple fronts”, to use her words. Her whole
  post is worth reading, but here is her conclusion. As you can see, the claim
  that migrants arriving on small boats are 24x more likely to end up in prison
  was an easy manipulation of available statistics. It wasn’t entirely
  fabricated - they can point to ‘official statistics’ to claim credibility -
  but it’s clearly misinformation all the same. A Tory MP briefed it to a
  right-wing newspaper, which published it unquestioningly. That was picked up
  by the rest of the right-wing media ecosystem, and now the 24x figure is
  firmly in the minds of those who want to believe it, and is being repeated all
  over the internet, and across dinner tables and garden fences. There are only
  two items in the diary for today. 11am: Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader,
  holds a press conference. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. (For
  readers who keep asking why we feature the Reform UK press conferences, but
  not the Lib Dem ones, or the Green party ones, the answer is simple; they are
  not holding any.) If you want to contact me, please post a message below the
  line when comments are open (normally between 10am and 3pm at the moment), or
  message me on social media. I can’t read all the messages BTL, but if you put
  “Andrew” in a message aimed at me, I am more likely to see it because I search
  for posts containing that word. If you want to flag something up urgently, it
  is best to use social media. You can reach me on Bluesky at

  have my account, and if you message me there at @AndrewSparrow, I will see it
  and respond if necessary. I find it very helpful when readers point out
  mistakes, even minor typos. No error is too small to correct. And I find your

Downing Street has urged people not to take part in a protest in support of the banned group Palestine Action as police warned they would arrest anyone breaking terrorism laws. Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, has announced that the police and creim. e commissioner for Leicestershire and Rutland has defected to his party from the Conservatives. (See 11.15am.) At his latest summer news conference on the topic of crime, he also said the police should release information about the immigration status of people who are charged with crimes. Kate Forbes, Scotland’s deputy first minister, has said she will step down as an MSP at next year’s Holyrood elections. (See 10.56am.) The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, is not telling the truth about the “real failures of 14 years of Conservative government”, the former Conservative prime minister Liz Truss has said. Napier barracks, one of the first mass accommodation sites opened to house asylum seekers, will not be closing as planned in the coming weeks, as the government attempts to deal with an influx of small boats arrivals. The UK has been left behind in the cryptocurrency boom and is in danger of missing a second wave of demand, according to the former chancellor George Osborne. For a full list of all the stories covered on the blog today, do scroll through the list of key event headlines near the top of the blog. Mhari Aurora from Sky News was the reporter who asked Nigel Farage at his press conference this morning the question that prompted him to reply with the claim that she would not dare to walk through London after 9pm wearing jewellery. (See 11.49m.) In an article for Sky’s website, she says that he is wrong. I am not afraid to walk in the West End of London after 9pm wearing jewellery. I have done it many times before and will continue to do so … but perhaps that is because I do not own a Rolex. But she says that does not mean she is not concerned about the risk of being a victim of crime, and she says that Farage is “tapping into” concerns that voters have. According to police reports, thefts from a person in London are almost five times the national average, and they’ve been going up since the pandemic. And the Office for National Statistics (ONS) also notes that thefts outside of the home, eg phone snatching, has increased. However, possession of weapons has fallen in London by 29% over the last three years. And according to the ONS, crime in England and Wales is 30% lower than in 2015, and 76% lower than 1995 … In short, am I right to be more worried that snatch theft and knife crime in London is increasing? Yes, and no. But Nigel Farage is tapping into voters’ emotions - their feelings that the country is broken … And the more politicians of all colours tell voters that “the system is broken”, the more voters might start to believe them. Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, does not take a strong interest in transgender isssues but in its manifesto at the election the party attacked “transgender indoctrination” and “baseless transgender ideology”, leaving it fairly clear where the party stands on these issues. That’s why, in its report this morning about Vanessa Frake joining the party as an adviser, the Times pointed out that Frake, a former prison governor, did not support a banket ban on trans women being placed in women’s prisons. At his press conference this morning Farage was asked if he agreed. Whereas with most of his answers Farage was keen to lean into rightwing opinion (and then some), on this, perhaps mindful of the need not to embarrass his new recruit, Farage backed her up. He said one problem with government is that ministers often have no experience of the issues for which they are responsible. He went on: “I personally have never worked in a prison, so I can’t answer it.” But he said Frake had worked in prisons at the highest level, and that she thought it was all about risk assessment. Frake, who was at the press conference, agreed. She said everyone in prison “deserves to be treated with humanity and decency, and that includes female prisoners and it includes trans prisoners”. Prisons were used to dealing with issues like this by carrying out risk assessments, she said. In response Kemi Badenoch, who unlike Farage does have a close interest in this issue, posted a clip of the Farage answer on social media with a message saying: A reminder that @Conservatives are the ONLY party standing up for women-only spaces. After the Supreme Court judgment, we shouldn’t be hearing anymore about men being put in women’s prisons. Yet here we are. As usual, Reform have not done their homework and will make a big mess. Vanessa Frake, the former prison govenor who is now a Reform UK adviser, has also disagreed with some of her new colleagues about male police officers being more reassuring than female ones. At a press conference two weeks ago Nigel Farage, the party leader, said he would like people to feel a bit intimidated by police officers. Following up on this, Sarah Pochin, the Reform MP and justice spokesperson for the party, told the BBC: I never feel comfortable actually seeing two female officers together. I’d much rather see a great big strapping male police officer with a female. Today, asked if she agreed with these comments, Frake told Times Radio agree: I disagree. I’ve seen police officers and I’ve seen prison officers, females. And, you know, that’s Nigel’s opinion. As I said, I’m not going to agree with him all the time. And I’m sure he’s not going to agree with me all the time. Vanessa Frake, the former prison govenor who announced today she is joining Reform UK as an adviser, was critical of the government when she appeared alongside Nigel Farage at their press conference this morning. (See 11.29am.) But she was a bit more positive last year. After the election, when Keir Starmer appointed James Timpson as prisons minister, Frake described that as a “stroke of genius” because of Timpson’s record working with ex-offenders. In the same interview last year, Frake also she would like to see more non-violent offenders serving sentences in the community, and not in jail – something Labour is pursuing through its sentencing review. Frake will be contributing to the Reform’s law and order taskforce. Keir Starmer is now all-but-certain to recognise Palestine as a state in September. Last week he said this would happen unless Israel complied with certain conditions, including committing to a two-state solution. Given that Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli PM, said last week this would involve Israel having to accept a “jihadist state”, it seems fair to assume that Israel will not comply (unless the Netanyahu government is replaced with a very different one in the next few weeks, which is also not plausible). Starmer also set out requirements for Hamas. But the government has confirmed that these are not formal conditions, implying Palestinian state recognition will go ahead even if all the hostages have not been released. But the government has not admitted this explicitly and, at the Downing Street lobby briefing this morning, asked if the UK might recognise the state of Palestine if hostages were still being held, the No 10 spokesperson just said “we’ll make an assessment ahead of Unga [the United Nations general assembly in September] on how far the parties have met the steps that we’ve set out.” Asked whether a Palestinian state could be recognised with Hamas still in government, the spokesman also said that Hamas would not get a “veto” over UK recognition of Palestine. He said: We’ve been very clear that Hamas can have no role in the future governments of Gaza … We’ve also been clear that they must disarm, must release all the hostages. We’ve also been clear that Hamas are not the Palestinian people, and it is the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to have recognition along the lines and the steps that we’ve previously set out. We’ve also been very clear it cannot be in the hands of Hamas, a terrorist group, to have a veto over recognition of Palestine. John Swinney, the SNP leader and Scottish first minister, has paid tribute to Kate Forbes following her announcement that she will leave Holyrood at the elections next year. (See 10.56am.) In an open letter to her, Swinney said: I have deeply valued the contribution you have made to the work of the Scottish National party and the Scottish government and am pleased we will continue to benefit from that in the approach to the May 2026 elections. You have made a huge contribution to public life in Scotland and have been instrumental in making progress on economic issues for my government. You have much to be proud of in all of the work you have undertaken but I am especially heartened by the effect of your leadership on advancing support for the Gaelic language. We all wrestle with the inevitable conflicts between family and public life and I sympathise with the dilemmas you have faced. I wish you, Ali and your family well and much happiness in the years ahead. In her own tribute, Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour’s deputy leader, thanks Forbes for her service as an MSP. She went on: Of course, as much as being an MSP is a privilege, it is also a demanding job which can make for a difficult balance between our working and personal lives. In that spirit, I wish Kate all the very best in her future endeavours and hope that she can enjoy spending time with her family. But it cannot have escaped the notice of voters that many of the SNP’s former rising stars are abandoning the stage, often to be replaced by defeated names of yesteryears and anonymous party apparatchiks. Kate Forbes was the future once - but now, like many of her counterparts in the SNP, she can see the writing on the wall. The truth is this is a tired government with no vision and no ideas. And Alex Cole-Hamilton, the Scottish Lib Dem leader, said his party would be fighting hard to win Forbes’s constituency, Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch. He said: Kate and I were both elected to the Scottish parliament in 2016 and there have been several occasions when we’ve worked well together on shared interests since. I wish her family well for everything that comes next. This is a top target seat for the Scottish Liberal Democrats, having won the equivalent seat at Westminster last year. We’re campaigning hard to fix the care crisis, to cut your energy bills, and for better local healthcare having recently secured the replacement for the Belford Hospital in the Scottish budget. In their response to the Nigel Farage press conference, the Liberal Democrats focused on the defection of a Tory police and crime commissioner. (See 11.15am.) A Lib Dem source said: Elected Conservatives are becoming more and more like UFOs themselves - they’re rarely if ever seen, and most people don’t believe in them. Never mind life on Mars, it’s unclear if there’s life in the Conservative Party. Time for Kemi Badenoch to admit that her plan to mimic Nigel Farage and drag the Conservatives further to the right isn’t working. This is a reference to the fact that Rupert Matthews, the police and crime commissioner for Leicestershire and Rutland who has defected from the Tories to Reform UK, has written books about UFOs and the paranormal. In a post on Bluesky Sunder Katwala, director of the British Future thinktank, points out that, with his press conference answer about sending Afghan asylum seekers back to Afghanistan (see 11.53am), Nigel Farage seemed to forget his own party’s policy. Nigel Farage would simply send Afghan asylum seekers back to Afghanistan. Has he now forgotten that his current policy (bluff) is that he can simply return asylum seekers in boats to France, without permission Labour and the Conservatives have both criticised Nigel Farage this morning for not being able to give details of Reform UK policies. In particularly, they focused on what he said when asked how Reform would pay for new prisons. (See 11.57am.) In a statement, Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said: Reform are doodling fantasy prisons on the back of a pub napkin. Once again Nigel Farage has made wild promises to the British public but completely failed to set out how he intends to pay for any of them. Empty words, zero plan, and not a shred of credibility. And Labour issued a statement from a party spokesperson saying: Nigel Farage offers anger, but no answers. It’s farcical that Farage can’t say what his policies are, how much they would cost, or how they would even work. Reform aren’t serious and don’t have a clue as to how they would address the challenges facing working people. This is what Farage said during the press conference when it was put to him that the supermax prisions his new prisons adviser seemed to be proposing would be particularly expensive. He said: This is week three of the campaign. We laid out very clearly a plan. I was asked [at a previous press conference] about the cost of that plan, to which I said, how can we afford not to do this? Now the supermax prisons – have we costed it, have we thought it through? It’s a debate. The point about this taskforce is we’re starting a debate, and we’d rather like it to become a full public debate too. Vanessa Frake, the former prison governor who is now advising the party, said she was not calling for new US-style supermax prisons in her opening remarks. She said she was calling for the use of supermax regimes, which she said could be implemented “relatively easily”. (See 11.17am.) The UK has been left behind in the cryptocurrency boom and is in danger of missing a second wave of demand, according to George Osborne, the former chancellor. Dan Milmo has the story. Severin Carrell is the Guardian’s Scotland editor. Kate Forbes’s surprise decision to quit frontline Scottish politics next May inevitably raises questions about what this means for the next Scottish National party leadership contest and for the pro-independence movement. John Swinney, the incumbent first minister and party leader, has insisted he plans to stay in post long after next year’s Holyrood election, quashing speculation his goal is solely to save the SNP from imploding and to secure a fifth term in power. That promise presupposes the SNP will win next May’s election and that he wins handsomely; Scottish Labour’s collapsing poll ratings suggests for now that that is likely. But whether Swinney would stay on for a full five year term is another question. And if Forbes is no longer in the running, who might the contenders be? Swinney faces a potential challenger in the shape of Stephen Flynn, the SNP’s hyper-ambitious Westminster leader, who is standing for election to Holyrood in May, and ousted the former SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford in a coup. However, many see Swinney’s housing secretary Màiri McAllan, who recently returned to the cabinet after taking maternity leave, as his heir apparent. A very able minister, she has the conspicuous advantage of having a powerful coterie of allies in cabinet – mostly women ministers close to Nicola Sturgeon. Swinney was openly dismissive of Flynn’s potential challenge when he was asked about it after he unveiled the SNP’s slate of Holyrood candidates some months ago – an event where McAllan was prominent and Flynn absent. However, Flynn, an Aberdeen MP closely allied to Alex Salmond’s former aides, who trades in what he sees as a robustly realist defence of North Sea oil and gas jobs, has a power base too in the wider party. If he becomes prominent in a post-election SNP government, Swinney will face pressure to give him a ministerial role, and that will then put serious strains on any putative partnership with the pro-independence Scottish Greens at Holyrood. Like their sister party in England and Wales, the Scottish Greens are embroiled in a live leadership contest. Depending on the result in May, Swinney’s fortunes could well hinge on Green cooperation, and they, for now, are his best bet to hold onto power. Q: Are you worried that some of the comments made by George Finch earlier might prejudice a future trial, putting a conviction at risk? (This is a reference to comments that I did not report here, when covering Finch at 11.36am, because some of what said did seem to pose a contempt of court risk.) Farage said he was not concerned about this. He claimed that Finch was just expressing the concerns felt by Warwickshire residents. “If that means he was slightly emotional, well, you know what, good,” Farage said. Q: What is your response to Neil Kinnock urging the government to put VAT on private healthcare? Farage said that was the sort of idea that would encourage even more wealthy people to leave the country. There was already an exodus, he claimed. In an interview with the i, Kinnock, the former Labour leader, said: Introducing VAT on private health provision could provide vital funding for the NHS and social care. After 14 years of underinvestment, many people are turning to private healthcare not out of choice, but because they cannot afford to wait. This has increasingly led to unequal access to care. Ending the VAT exemption to generate much-needed revenue is a reasonable and widely supported step. Q: What is your response to the report about Labour using Hope Not Hate analysis of Reform UK voters, even though Hope Not Hate label Reform as “far right”. Farage said this was “moronic”. And he claimed Labour would find it hard to profile Reform support because, of all the parties, it had the greatest spread of support, geographically and in terms of age, faith and ethnicity. Q: Keir Starmer is reportedly interested in introducing digital ID cards, partly to tackle illegal immigration. Would you back that? Farage said that was a Blairite idea. “I’m sure that Tony Blair would have us all microchipped,” he said. He went on: No, I don’t support it. I don’t trust big government. If you want to see why my trust in government doesn’t exist, just think about what’s happened in the space of the last week, where they introduced legislation they tell you is purely to protect children [the Online Safety Act], and actually it is having a terrible effect on free speech and democracy. I would not trust this government with digital ID, I have to say, I didn’t particularly enjoy the vaccine passport phase that we lived through. As for the argument, it’ll stop crime, it’ll stop illegal immigration, it’ll stop illegal working, well, I don’t think digital ID will stop teenage girls being raped, I don’t think digital ID will stop the drugs gangs, I don’t think digital ID will stop illegal working. Q: Have you discussed your concerns about the Online Safety Act with the US vice president, JD Vance? Farage claimed he could not remember. Q: Will Reform UK councillors block the use of HMOs (houses in multiple occcupation) to house asylum seekers? Farage said that was “absolutely” the position of Reform councillors. In some ways, the use of HMOs by asylum seekers was “even worse” than the use of hotels. Finch said that in Warwickshire he wanted to be able to tell residents where HMOs housing migrants were. He claimed not being able to do this was “dangerous” and “against safeguarding”. He also claimed this was “a huge problem for the children in Warwickshire”. Q: Since you have been running a campaign linking sexual crimes with migration, are you picking up more support from women? Farage replied: I do think one of the things that’s happened over the course of the last few weeks is, without doubt, we’re definitely seeing, not just high profile women coming to Reform – and you’ve seen one or two of those on the stage here and in Wales over the course of the last few weeks – but I think generally out there there is grave concern, particularly amongst mothers, about their teenagers, whether they can let them out. So perhaps this issue has spoken the truth to people that they’ve been feeling increasingly for some time. And I think that may be that changing the complexion of how people view Reform. When I came back into this last June, people regarded it as being a bit of a blokeish party - something to do my reputation, I can’t quite think why. But I think that’s changing and changing very rapidly. This campaign is very much a part of that. Q: Vanessa Frake is calling for supermax prisons. [See 11.29am.] But they are the most expensive prisons to build. How are you going to afford that? Farage says he is only at the start of this campaign. He suggests it is too early for the party to have full details. Frake says she was not calling for supermax prisons. She was calling for a supermax regime in some prisons. That could be implemented “relatively easy”, she says. UPDATE: See 1.22pm for the full Farage quote. Q: Where should people be deported to if they come from a country that is not safe? Farage replies: Sorry. I’ve had enough of this. If you come from Afghanistan, you go back to Afghanistan. End of. This idea, we can’t send people to certain countries, all the false claims that people make about their own personal lives – I’m sorry. We’re done. We’re done. We’ve had enough. Q: Are you trying to make people afraid, to get them to vote for you? Farage replies: No, they are afraid. They are afraid. I dare you to walk through the West End of London after nine o’clock of an evening wearing jewellery. You wouldn’t do it. You know that I’m right. You wouldn’t do it, and that’s just in London – let alone what’s happening in so many other parts of the country, and the genuine fears. Linking this to immigration, he claims there are “some people who come from certain cultures that pose a danger to our society”. This is the contested claim raised by Robert Jenrick this morning. (See 9.53am.) Farage is now taking questions. Asked what Reform UK would do to stop the small boat crossings, Farage dismissed today’s Home Office announcement about £100m being spent on more officers. (See 10.48am.) He said the UK had already given £800m to France to address the problem. But the boats were still coming. He said people were still arriving because they knew they had a “99% chance of staying”. He said the only effective solution would be to turn people away when they arrived. That is what Australia did, he said. He said: If you enter a country illegally, you will be detained and deported. This is what normal countries do all over the world. We’ve surrendered normality to this new human rights regime. George Finch, the Reform UK leader of Warwickshire county council, goes next. (Aged 19, he is the youngest council leader in the country.) He claims the police have opposed his attempts to expose the immigration status of someone arrested in connection with an alleged crime. Colin Sutton, a former police officer who is now advising Reform UK on crime, introduces the next speaker – Vanessa Frake, a former prison governor and author of the memoir, The Governor. Frake says when she went to Wormwood Scrubs, she was assigned the task of cleaning up D wing, where the lifers were based. It was dirty, run down and had major drug issues. My attitude to the task was assertive and no nonsense. That’s the approach that I will take for my role within Reform UK [advising on crime]. She says the public have lost faith in how prisons are run. Assaults on staff are up, drug use is up, and thousands of offenders are being released early, she says. She says the government has “appeased prisoners” who have been allowed to cook their own food. This has led to attacks on staff, she says. She says she wants a “tougher prison regime for prisoners who will never be rehabilitated”, based on the supermax prisons in the US. But, for prisoners who will be released, she wants more focus on rehabilition, she says. UPDATE: I updated the headline after Frake said (at 11.57am) that she was proposing having a supermax regime in prisons for the most serious offenders, not building new supermax jails. Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, introduces a defector. It is Rupert Matthews, the police and crime commissioner for Leicestershire and Rutland. He was elected to that post as a Conservative in 2021. Before that he was a Tory MEP. Matthews claims the police are “fighting crime with one hand tied behind their back”. He goes on: The courts impose sentences that too often are derisory and Labour’s early release scheme means that crooks are back out after serving a fraction of their time in prison. Now it’s all because our prisons are full. They’re full of foreign criminals who should be deported the day they are convicted, not kept here at the expense of British taxpayers. It’s no wonder that criminals do not fear the justice system, no wonder that the law abiding have almost given up on reporting crimes, and our wonderful police officers are let down even by their own senior commanders. The Reform UK press conference is starting now. There is a live feed here. Severin Carrell is the Guardian’s Scotland editor. Kate Forbes, Scotland’s deputy first minister and previous Scottish National party leadership contender, has announced she is quitting Holyrood at the next election. The news will shock her party. Forbes has long been regarded by centrists in the party as a potential leader and was a favourite of many business leaders and SNP MSPs aligned with former leader Alex Salmond. She said she had reflected over the recess about whether to stand again at next May’s Scottish parliamentary election, but had decided to put her young family first. In a statement she said: I have grown up in the public eye, getting married, having a baby and raising a young family. I have consistently put the public’s needs ahead of my family’s during that time. I am grateful to them for accommodating the heavy demands of being a political figure. Looking ahead to the future, I do not want to miss any more of the precious early years of family life – which can never be rewound. But her statement left open the possibility she may stand again at a later date, emphasising she did not wish “to seek re-election for another five-year term in the Scottish parliament”. Her decision to quit now will also spare Forbes of the challenge of deciding whether or not to contest the leadership again if Swinney quits after the 2026 election; many see the housing secretary Màiri McAllan as the favourite to succeed him. An MSP in the Highlands, Forbes came close to winning the leadership and becoming first minister after Nicola Sturgeon stood down in February 2023, following one of the most turbulent and combative campaigns of recent party history. Forbes openly attacked many of Sturgeon’s landmark policies on social inclusion and accused her closest rival Humza Yousaf of incompetence, with the contest exposing significant strains with their pro-independence partners the Scottish Green party. An active member of the socially conservative Free Church of Scotland, which does not admit women as church ministers, she was accused in turn of taking regressive stances on abortion rights, equal marriage and the climate crisis. After Yousaf’s period as first minister and party leadership ended suddenly following his disastrous decision to abandon a coalition with the Greens, Forbes was brought back in to serve as deputy first minister by John Swinney as he sought to steady the ship. Forbes said she enjoyed the privilege of becoming a minister for public finance, then as cabinet secretary for finance (a post she was given at extremely short notice after the then finance secretary quit on the eve of a budget) and most recently as deputy first minister and cabinet secretary for economy and Gaelic. Angela Eagle, the Home Office minister, was giving interviews this morning to promote government plans to spend £100m hiring up to 300 extra National Crime Agency officers. Here is the Home Office press release, and Rajeev Syal has written the story up here. As Rajeev says, this was the third Home Office announcement on this topic within 24 hours, following confirmation of plans plans to introduce a new offence for advertising irregular small boat crossings and plans to fast-track the processing of asylum applications. Today the Times reports that, as part of the measures to limit asylum applications, the Home Office will penalise universities that accept foreign students who are primarily motivated by the desire to claim asylum in the UK. In their story Matt Dathan and Aubrey Allegretti report: As part of a fresh government crackdown, universities will be penalised if fewer than 95 per cent of international students accepted on to a course start their studies, or fewer than 90 per cent continue to the end. Institutions that accept foreign students will face sanctions if more than 5 per cent of their visas are rejected. The plans, which are expected to be announced next month, are designed to prevent the growing numbers of foreign nationals using study visas to enter the UK and then claim asylum. Dathan and Allegretti also say Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, is expected to sign the “one in, one out” returns deal with France, allowing around 50 small boat arrivals to be returned to France every week in exchange for the UK accepting an equal number of asylum applicants from France, on Wednesday. According to Mahri Aurora from Sky News, Reform UK will announce a defection at their press conference. NEW: Reform UK are holding a press conference at 11am today in which they will unveil a defection from the Tory party. They will also introduce former prison governor Vanessa Frake MBE as their new justice adviser. The press conference will be held with them as well as Farage and the Reform Warwickshire County Council leader George Finch. In her interviews this morning Angela Eagle, the minister for border security and asylum, was asked what her message was to people who have been protesting outside hotels used to house asylum seekers. She told Sky News: Anger doesn’t get you anywhere. What we have to do is recognise the values we have in this country, the rule of law we have in this country, the work we’re doing with the police to protect people. We will close asylum hotels by the end of the parliament. We’ll do it faster if we can. And she told Times Radio: Those who are worried and demonstrating have an absolute right to do that, so long as they do it peacefully. People don’t have a right to then have a pop at the police, which has been happening in some isolated cases outside hotels. Kemi Badenoch, is not telling the truth about the “real failures of 14 years of Conservative government”, the former Conservative prime minister Liz Truss has said. Kevin Rawlinson has the story. Good morning. During August, when parliament is not sitting and the tap of domestic news is running dry, opposition parties often like to run campaigns. Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, is following this model with gusto and today, for the third week in a row, he is holding a press conference on the subject of crime. Reform’s success in the polls is almost entirely down to the fact it advocates hardline policies to cut immigration and small boat crossings and Farage is trying explicitly to link this issue to crime, arguing that asylum seekers are disproportionately likely to be criminal. The Conservative party don’t have a single theme for their summer campaigning. (Yesterday Kemi Badenoch was campaigning about the uselessness of the Liz Truss mini-budget, a topic where the nation largely agrees.) But in response to an overnight announcement from the government about new measures to crack down on small boat crossings, they have also been depicting these migrants (whose numbers, of course, increased dramatically while they were in office) as a threat to public safety. In a statement released overnight Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said: “This weak Labour government has lost control of our borders, and we now see rapes and sexual assaults by illegal immigrants reported on a near daily basis.” And, in an interview on the Today programme this morning, Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, doubled down on this claim. He said: I am afraid there is increasing evidence of a serious link between illegal migration, migration generally, and crime, particularly sexual crime against women and girls. In London, 40% last year of all of the sexual crimes were committed by foreign nationals, despite the fact that they only make up 25% of the population. And some of the data that – we’re seeing we don’t have good data at the moment – some of the data we’re seeing is very striking. Afghans and Eritrean nationals are 20 times more likely to be convicted of a sexual crime than a British national. These are very shocking statistics. Farage recently told the New Statesman, for an interesting, lengthy profile written by Harry Lambert, that he thought Jenrick would “almost certainly” end up to the right of him on migration by the next election. “I suspect he will probably go further – that’s just my instinct for someone who wants to make noise,” Farage said. Angela Eagle, the minister for border security and asylum, has been giving interviews this morning, and on the Today programme she suggested that there was not firm data to back up the claims that Jenrick was making. She said: [Jenrick] did actually say that we don’t have good data at the moment, and yet he’s asserting with great certainty data points, and I don’t know where he’s got them from. So it’s difficult for me to criticise from a data point of view. But he’s admitted in that interview that we don’t have good data. Asked if she thought that the Tories were “playing with fire” by linking asylum seekers with sexual crime, Eagle replied: I think that we need to deal with all crimes, all sexual crimes, regardless of who has perpetrated them in the same way. And we need to crack down on violence against women and girls, which is why we’ve actually got Jess Phillips, a minister, whose entire job is about doing that. Asked if she was open to discussing possible links between immigration and crime, Eagle replied: I don’t mind having debates about anything, but I think we haven’t got good data on this, and I think that we’ve got to look at the principle. And that is that we’ve got to deal with all sexual criminality, whoever perpetrates it, in an almost colour blind way. If a girl has been abused by somebody or has been subjected to a vile sexual crime, it doesn’t really matter what the colour of the skin of the perpetrator is. As Eagle said, it is hard to assess the truth about the link between immigration and crime because the data is complicated, and in some respects limited. But one person who has tried is the researcher and scientist Emma Monk. On her Substack blog she recently published an analysis of the claim that some people arriving in the UK on small boats are 20 times more likely than Britons to be criminal. This is a claim that Jenrick referenced, describing it as “shocking”. Monk argues that it is shockingly inaccurate – or “ludicrous on multiple fronts”, to use her words. Her whole post is worth reading, but here is her conclusion. As you can see, the claim that migrants arriving on small boats are 24x more likely to end up in prison was an easy manipulation of available statistics. It wasn’t entirely fabricated - they can point to ‘official statistics’ to claim credibility - but it’s clearly misinformation all the same. A Tory MP briefed it to a right-wing newspaper, which published it unquestioningly. That was picked up by the rest of the right-wing media ecosystem, and now the 24x figure is firmly in the minds of those who want to believe it, and is being repeated all over the internet, and across dinner tables and garden fences. There are only two items in the diary for today. 11am: Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, holds a press conference. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. (For readers who keep asking why we feature the Reform UK press conferences, but not the Lib Dem ones, or the Green party ones, the answer is simple; they are not holding any.)

I can’t read all the messages BTL, but if you put “Andrew” in a message aimed at me, I am more likely to see it because I search for posts containing that word. If you want to flag something up urgently, it is best to use social media. You can reach me on Bluesky at @andrewsparrowgdn.bsky.social. The Guardian has given up posting from its official accounts on X, but individual Guardian journalists are there, I still have my account, and if you message me there at @AndrewSparrow, I will see it and respond if necessary. I find it very helpful when readers point out mistakes, even minor typos. No error is too small to correct. And I find your questions very interesting too. I can’t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either BTL or sometimes in the blog.
