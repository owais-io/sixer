  One man is dead and another is in hospital with serious wounds after a
  shooting outside a Sydney pub which police described as “outrageous” and
  “brazen”. Emergency services were called to the Harold Park hotel on Ross
  Street in Forest Lodge in Sydney’s inner west at about 6.40pm on Sunday. New
  South Wales police said two people had been shot multiple times by unknown
  assailants who left the scene by car. One man died at the scene while a second
  was treated by paramedics for gunshot wounds. He was in a critical condition
  on Monday morning after finishing a second round of surgeries. In a press
  conference on Monday, Det Supt Alfio Sergi of the Leichhardt Police Area
  Command said “numerous” shots were fired outside pub, with some being
  described as “whizzing by” by a woman working there while she was picking up
  glasses outside. Sergi said it had been an “extremely dangerous” situation,
  and although the investigation was in its early stages, he believed it was a
  “targeted attack”. “Obviously we’ll be looking at [any] links with organised
  crime networks, that will be a focus of our investigation,” he said. Sergi
  told 2GB on Monday morning the two victims had been walking from the pub to
  their car when they appear to have been “ambushed” by one or more gunman. A
  39-year-old man was shot. Despite being treated by police, whom Sergi said
  were “nearby”, as well as paramedics and a local doctor, he died at the scene.
  Sergi said the other victim, a 31-year-old man, was “chased by the offender,
  he was shot a number of times, he slumped at the back of the hotel, again
  police rendered first aid assisted by some medical students who were in the
  hotel”. He described the shootings as an “outrageous, brazen, callous attack”,
  adding that a bullet hit one of the pub windows and “narrowly missed” a female
  staff member. Sergi said police were searching for a dark-coloured vehicle and
  appealed for witnesses and anyone with dashcam footage of the incident to come
  forward. Sign up: AU Breaking News email One eyewitness told the ABC she heard
  more than a dozen shots ring out. “It was such rapid fire I actually thought
  it was firecrackers, until I saw a family running down the street and
  screaming,” she said. Another told the Sydney Morning Herald she saw a man
  being shot “at least six times” in the neck, chest and legs. Police have
  established a crime scene, and Leichhardt detectives – with assistance from
  the homicide squad – are investigating the incident. – Australian Associated
