  Israeli police have refused to release the body of Awdah Hathaleen, a
  Palestinian activist and journalist who helped make the Oscar-winning
  documentary No Other Land, while the settler accused of killing him, Yinon
  Levi, has been released from custody. Hathaleen was shot to death on Monday
  night during a confrontation between settlers driving a bulldozer in the
  village of Umm al-Khair in the occupied West Bank and residents of the town. A
  video appears to show Levi firing his gun wildly and then people screaming as
  Hathaleen, standing a distance away in the town centre, collapsed. Levi was
  released from custody by a court on Tuesday and placed under three days of
  house arrest, which ends tomorrow and allows him to roam free. According to
  Levi’s lawyer, Avihai Hajabi, the court found that there was evidence
  supporting his claims that he acted in self-defence, and ordered his release.
  Levi, who was earlier put under sanctions by the then US president Joe Biden
  and later removed from the sanctions list by Donald Trump, could still face
  charges. Despite the release of Levi, Hathaleen’s family is still struggling
  to recover his body from Israeli police so that they can hold his funeral.
  “It’s devastating. His body is still being held and the killer is free. His
  mother and his wife – they keep asking where he is, when his body will come
  back. I have no answers any more. I tell them an hour, two hours, but I don’t
  know,” said Salem Hathaleen, the elder brother of Awdah. Israeli police said
  they would not release Hathaleen’s body until his family agreed to 10
  conditions, including limiting the funeral to 15 people and burying his body
  outside his birth village, according to a lawyer representing the family. “The
  idea is that the police want the funeral to be really small and quiet, so that
  it is like it never happened and nobody will come,” said Karin Wind, who has
  reviewed the conditions and is communicating with the police on behalf of the
  family. According to a police document seen by the Guardian, police requested
  that no “signs calling for incitement” be displayed or “amplification” system
  used at the funeral, with the police requesting a deposit from the family to
  ensure they complied with conditions. The family refused to sign the document
  and its conditions. “Fifteen people – this would mean basically half his
  siblings and children couldn’t even attend,” said Salem. The Guardian reached
  out to the Israeli police and the military for a comment but did not receive
  one by the time of publication. The Israeli military has claimed the
  conditions are necessary to preserve public order. Israeli soldiers raided the
  tent erected for mourners on Tuesday, declaring it a closed military zone as
  they pushed mourners out and threw stun grenades at activists and journalists
  in attendance. “Coming to the place that he was killed, where they killed him,
  and kicking people out? This is not a life, this is against any law in the
  world,” said Awdeh’s brother Alaa Hathaleen, who witnessed him die. The
  Guardian attempted to reach Alaa Hathaleen for a comment on Thursday but
  discovered he had been arrested, along with 13 other residents, by the Israeli
  military. More than 70 women from the village declared on Thursday that they
  were going on hunger strike until the police returned the body of Awdeh
  Hathaleen. Activists and relatives of Hathaleen said the case underscored what
  they called a system of impunity for Israeli settlers as they committed a wave
  of violence against Palestinians. At least 1,010 Palestinians have been killed
  and more than 7,000 have been injured in the West Bank by Israeli settlers and
  soldiers since October 2023. On Thursday morning, another settler attack was
  carried out in the village of Silwad in the West Bank. The Palestinian
  Authority said Israeli settlers descended upon the village and set fire to
  homes and cars in the village, killing a Palestinian man. “Forty-year-old
  Khamis Abdel-Latif Ayad was martyred due to smoke inhalation caused by fires
  set by settlers in citizens’ homes and vehicles in the village of Silwad at
  dawn,” the Palestinian health ministry said in a statement. The Israeli
  military said in a statement to Agence France-Presse that several suspects set
  fire to property and vehicles in Silwad, but that they were unable to identify
  the suspects. The Israeli police said it had launched an investigation into
  the incident. Accountability for settlers who commit acts of violence against
  Palestinians is rare. Israeli settlements are considered illegal under
  international law, but their development has been accelerated under the
  current rightwing government. The Israeli government distributed 29
  all-terrain vehicles, in addition to security and logistical equipment
  including drones and night vision goggles, to settlements on Wednesday. At the
  ceremony to hand over the equipment, the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich,
  said: “The agricultural farms and young settlements are the spearhead of
  Zionist settlement in Judea and Samaria.” The killing of Hathaleen prompted a
  wave of international condemnation. The French ministry of foreign affairs
  released a statement urging the Israeli government to hold Hathaleen’s killer
  accountable and calling settler violence “a matter of terrorism”. Umm al-Khair
  is within Area C of the West Bank, which is under full Israeli control and
  sits just below the Israeli settlement of Carmel. All settlements in the West
  Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967, are illegal under international
  law. “There’s a saying here: ‘The dignity of the dead is in burial.’ When
  someone is killed, there should be immediate burial. It brings some small
  relief to the heart. But until now, we’ve received neither the body nor the
  right to do anything,” said Salem.
