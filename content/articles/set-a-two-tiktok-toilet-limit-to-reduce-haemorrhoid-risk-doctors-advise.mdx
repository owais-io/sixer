  People who take a mobile phone to the loo should keep to a two TikTok limit,
  according to doctors who found that toilet scrollers are more prone to
  haemorrhoids than phoneless lavatory-goers. Those who sit on the throne with a
  phone spend far more time on the toilet than others, with longer stints linked
  to a greater risk of developing the bulging anal veins known as haemorrhoids
  or piles. Though preliminary, the findings prompted the team to advise people
  against taking a phone to the lavatory, or at least to impose a scroll limit
  lest they become distracted and find themselves still sitting there half an
  hour later. “Leave your smartphone outside because when you go in you have
  just one job, and you should focus on that job,” said Dr Trisha Pasricha, a
  gastroenterologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. “If the
  magic hasn’t happened within five minutes, you should get up and go. Take a
  breather and come back.” Pasricha and her colleagues examined 125 people for
  haemorrhoids during colonoscopies for a bowel cancer screening programme. The
  same volunteers completed questionnaires on diet, exercise and bowel habits,
  including how long they spent on the toilet and whether they ever strained or
  experienced constipation. Further questions, according to the study in Plos
  One, delved into people’s mobile phone habits to find out whether they took
  their device to the toilet and what apps they used once there. All were aged
  45 and over. Two-thirds of people admitted to taking a phone to the toilet,
  where most scrolled through news and social media. After accounting for common
  risk factors for haemorrhoids such as older age, physical inactivity and low
  dietary fibre, toilet scrollers were 46% more likely to have piles than those
  who left their phone behind. More than a third (37%) of toilet scrollers spent
  more than five minutes on the lavatory compared with only 7% of those without
  phones. Reading on the toilet is nothing new, but Pasricha believes that the
  newspapers, magazines and books that once kept people occupied are no match
  for the likes of TikTok and Instagram. “The whole business model of these apps
  is to make you lose track of time,” she said. “Our pre-TikTok ancestors were
  just reading a newspaper or whatever they could find. It wasn’t distracting to
  the same level.” More work is needed on the health implications, but Pasricha
  suspects that smartphone apps prolong the time people spend on the toilet,
  which in turn increases the pressure on anal tissues, leading to haemorrhoids.
  “If you’re just hanging out there in the open, this passive pressure will
  eventually, over time, cause the connective tissue to weaken and cause those
  veins to engorge,” she said. One pressing question surrounds the habits of
  younger people. In a continuing study of college students, Pasricha said
  nearly all admitted to taking phones to the toilet, raising concerns that the
  teenagers of today might develop piles sooner than older generations.
  Haemorrhoids affect up to a quarter of all adults, and while most resolve on
  their own or with minimal treatment, more than 20,000 surgical procedures are
  performed on piles each year in the UK alone. For those who cannot contemplate
  being phoneless on the toilet, Pasricha suggests minimising the toilet scroll.
  “Set a two TikTok limit,” she said. “What you shouldn’t be doing is getting so
  trapped in this cycle of scrolling and watching TikTok that you lose track of
  why you came here in the first place.”
