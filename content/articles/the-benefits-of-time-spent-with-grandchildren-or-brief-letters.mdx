  I was saddened reading the letter from the parent whose children are ignored
  by the grandparents (1 August). What has not been stated is the benefit to the
  grandparents that comes from close contact with our grandchildren. We have
  three grandchildren, and I never feel more alive and energised than when I am
  with them – I am 80 and can’t wait for more. Nicholas Kraemer London • It is a
  little ironic that you chose to illustrate your article in the print edition
  (Cacio e pepe, with parmesan? Roman ire at unforgivable formaggio blunder, 7
  August) with a photo of a fine Venetian restaurant, rather than one in Rome.
  Venice has its own splendid culinary traditions, but they tend towards the
  pescatarian, as you might expect. Dr Richard J Goy Cambridge • Please stop
  crediting Gen Z for 6pm dinner reservations (Polly Hudson, 5 August). I am an
  always‑hungry 46 years old and have long been enjoying bargain early eat‑outs
  thanks to the First Table app, which gives huge discounts to diners willing to
  eat off-peak. David Carden Bristol • So Timothy Garton Ash believes that the
  “prime minister gets roasted every Wednesday at prime minister’s questions”
  (With Trump wreaking havoc, a question for the US Democrats: when will you
  ever learn?, 4 August). More a case of dealing with questions that are only
  half-baked, I’d have thought. Ann Spencer Newcastle upon Tyne • Have an
  opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today? Please email us your
  letter and it will be considered for publication in our letters section.
