  Pick of the week Lives Less Ordinary: Hold Fast! For this spin-off of the BBC
  World Service’s unusual life stories series, Derry Girls and Amandaland actor
  Siobhán McSweeney narrates the tale of a crew who found themselves confined to
  a Caribbean-bound cargo ship during the Covid pandemic in 2020. It takes a
  little while to warm up but, once it gets going, the tale of ship cook Giulia
  and the “zombie vibe” that she encountered at sea becomes increasingly
  surreal. Hannah J Davies Widely available, episodes weekly When the Cops Say
  No, We Say Yes There’s a strong chance that this podcast will sound a little
  familiar. Not only is it from the team behind Who Shat on the Floor at My
  Wedding, it kicks off with another faecal felony. If you could stomach that
  show and its low-stakes investigations, you’ll love this speedier version, AKA
  “part detective show, part gameshow, part panicky race”. HJD Widely available,
  episodes weekly Fame Under Fire After her hit series following the Sean
  “Diddy” Combs case, journalist Anoushka Mutanda-Dougherty returns with the
  latest on another lawsuit: the allegations against Kanye West by his former
  chief of staff, Lauren Pisciotta (which West denies). Hollie Richardson Widely
  available, episodes weekly Lawless Planet Doyens of the true-crime podcast,
  Wondery, offer something slightly different here, with a tense show about
  environmental malfeasance. It kicks off with an episode about a Montana
  coalmine dubbed a “den of thievery”, where – Zach Goldbaum reports – fraud,
  embezzlement and even links to Putin were just the tip of the iceberg. HJD
  Widely available, episodes weekly Try Hard In words that will be relatable to
  many, Alex Sujong Laughlin describes herself as “terrified, uncomfortable and
  uneasy”. Gladly, the Normal Gossip co-creator has channelled this nervous
  energy into a charming, gentle series about people trying to do new things.
  First up is Mattie, a trans woman who finds exercising in public excruciating
  but would love to visit her local yoga studio. HJD Widely available, episodes
  weekly
