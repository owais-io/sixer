  Bruce Lehrmann’s appeal against the federal court ruling that he was not
  defamed by Network 10 and Lisa Wilkinson is set to be heard on Wednesday. In
  April last year, Justice Michael Lee found that on the balance of
  probabilities Lehrmann raped former Liberal staffer Brittany Higgins in
  Parliament House in 2019, and that Lehrmann was therefore not defamed when
  Wilkinson interviewed Higgins about the case on The Project. The appeal
  against that finding will be heard over three days before the full court of
  justices Michael Wigney, Craig Colvin and Wendy Abraham. Here’s what to know.
  What was the defamation case about? Lehrmann was not named in the 2021
  interview on The Project, but later claimed he was identifiable and sued for
  defamation. He was charged with sexual intercourse without consent later that
  year, and at his criminal trial in 2022 pleaded not guilty, denying that any
  sexual activity had occurred. After his criminal trial was aborted in December
  2022, prosecutors dropped charges against Lehrmann for the alleged rape of
  Higgins, saying a retrial would pose an “unacceptable risk” to her health.
  Lehrmann has maintained his innocence. Lehrmann then pursued Ten and Wilkinson
  in the federal court, resulting in a five-week defamation trial in 2023. Lee
  famously said of Lehrmann’s decision to bring the civil case against Ten and
  Wilkinson, after his criminal trial was aborted due to juror misconduct:
  “Having escaped the lion’s den, Mr Lehrmann made the mistake of going back for
  his hat.” Why is Bruce Lehrmann appealing? Lehrmann is appealing on grounds
  including that the sexual assault described by Lee was “substantially
  inconsistent” with the violent rape portrayed on The Project, according to
  submissions to the appeal filed with the court in March. “The problem is that
  the broadcast clearly suggests a violent rape, where the complainant was in
  tears and repeatedly refused consent, of which repeated refusal the
  perpetrator must have been aware,” the submission said. “That is quite
  different from a non-violent rape involving inadvertent recklessness as to
  whether there was consent.” Lehrmann’s legal team say he was denied procedural
  fairness because the case which was found to be true was not put to him in
  cross-examination. “He was not cross-examined adequately on issues arising in
  the truth defence and accordingly, there has been a breach of procedural
  fairness to the extent we submit must result in the judgment against Mr
  Lehrmann being set aside,” the submission said. Lehrmann has also argued the
  definition of rape was misconstrued by Lee and was not the ordinary person’s
  understanding of the word. “The rape described graphically by Ms Higgins
  included allegations of violence, an assault, called out ‘no’ on multiple
  occasions and numerous references to an assault and trauma,” the submission
  said. “The ordinary reasonable reader would have, particularly in this
  context, excluded rape by this form of non-advertent recklessness and would
  probably mean a violent rape with express lack of consent.” Last October,
  Abraham granted Lehrmann a stay on $2m in costs he had been ordered to pay
  Ten, pending the outcome of the appeal. What does Lisa Wilkinson say?
  Wilkinson said in her submissions to the appeal, also filed in March, that she
  challenged Lee’s finding that she acted unreasonably in broadcasting an
  allegation of rape. Lee upheld the defence of truth, but found Wilkinson and
  Network 10 failed to establish the qualified privilege defence. That section
  30 defence, at the time of broadcast in 2021, was that they acted reasonably
  and in the public interest, in airing the rape claims in an interview with
  Higgins on The Project. In submissions to the appeal, Wilkinson now asserts
  the public interest defence “should have been found to have been established”
  in the original judgment. In documents filed in the federal court, Wilkinson’s
  barrister, Sue Chrysanthou SC, argued Lee erred in his finding that her
  client’s conduct in broadcasting an allegation of rape was improper and
  unjustifiable.
