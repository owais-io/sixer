  Welcome, readers, to Afternoon Update. Anthony Albanese is seeking a call with
  Benjamin Netanyahu after at least 100,000 people marched across the Sydney
  Harbour Bridge to protest against bloodshed and suffering in Gaza. Organisers
  put the figure at closer to 300,000. The Labor MP Ed Husic said politicians
  had “underestimated how strongly Australians feel” about Israel’s conduct in
  Gaza, while the Sussan Ley claimed the protest threw Sydney “into chaos for
  hours and hours”. Yesterday, NSW police said there were no reported injuries
  and protesters were “well behaved”. The NSW premier, Chris Minns, said he did
  not regret voicing his opposition to the Harbour Bridge protest and he
  respected Australians’ right to protest. Several state Labor MPs attended the
  march yesterday, including Penny Sharpe, Jihad Dib, Stephen Lawrence, Lynda
  Voltz and Sarah Kaine. The author and journalist Sarah Malik said Sunday’s
  protest “felt different”, describing it and similar rallies as “peaceful,
  powerful, loving declarations of freedom and democracy in action”. Top news
