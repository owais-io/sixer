  Dorset police have launched an investigation and stepped up patrols for
  Bournemouth’s Jewish community after a wave of antisemitic hate crimes in the
  seaside town. Over the weekend, a teenage boy was shot with an air rifle and
  injured, and swastika graffiti appeared on buildings, police said. Two people
  were walking along a street in the East Cliff neighbourhood on Saturday
  afternoon when a passing driver instigated a verbal altercation before
  shooting the teenager in the forehead. The unnamed boy is said to be well, but
  with swelling to the forehead. There were at least four reports that the Nazi
  swastika symbol had appeared on walls and homes overnight on Friday, including
  the house of a local rabbi, Bentzion Alperowitz. Alperowitz noticed the
  swastika on the side of his house when he was heading to synagogue on Saturday
  morning with his two daughters, aged seven and 10. He told the Jewish
  Chronicle that the graffito was “very upsetting and alarming” but he refused
  to be cowed by the incident. “We will continue to live as proud Jews here in
  Bournemouth … I want to encourage everyone to do exactly the same,” he added.
  Members of the local Jewish community, which numbers about 1,600 people,
  quickly helped the family clean off the swastika, the rabbi said. In a
  statement, Dorset police said they took hate crime extremely seriously. A full
  investigation was under way to identify those responsible, they said, and the
  public have been encouraged to approach officers carrying out inquiries in the
  area or on patrol with any information or concerns. According to the Jewish
  security charity Community Security Trust, reports of antisemitic incidents
  have soared across the UK since the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack and ensuing
  war in Gaza. Between October 2023 and October 2024, there were 5,583 incidents
  around the country, including abusive behaviour, threats, assaults, damage and
  desecration – a 204% year-on-year increase.
