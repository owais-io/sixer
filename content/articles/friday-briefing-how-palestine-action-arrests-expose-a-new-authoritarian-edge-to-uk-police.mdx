  Good morning. An award-winning poet, a decorated army officer, and a retired
  head teacher are handcuffed together in the back of a police van ... It’s not
  the start of a terrible joke, but a representation of just some of the
  eyebrow-raising arrests the police have made in recent weeks. These eminently
  establishment figures are just a few of the 700 arrested for showing support
  for Palestine Action after it was proscribed as a terrorist organisation. Many
  were in their seventies or older, and video footage made one of the mass
  arrests look like a giant garden party gone sour. Safe to say, manhandling
  octogenarians is sub-optimal optics for the police. “I’ve never been arrested
  before so I’m quite nervous, actually,” said one elderly man wearing a beige
  blazer. But bigger shifts in policing appear to be under way. Most recently,
  new government guidance says police forces should look to disclose the
  ethnicity and migration status of suspects charged in high-profile
  investigations. Although this may solve one headache for the criminal justice
  system – stopping the spread of conspiracies about alleged offenders – it
  could create another by damaging race relations across the country. For
  today’s newsletter, Rajeev Syal, home affairs editor at the Guardian,
  discusses the police’s pivot to a more authoritarian approach to protest, the
  potential impacts of releasing information about race, and which voters are
  being wooed. That’s after the headlines. Five big stories Ukraine | Keir
  Starmer and Volodymyr Zelenskyy have hailed “a visible chance for peace” in
  Ukraine, as long as Vladimir Putin proves he is serious about ending the war
  when he meets Donald Trump in Alaska on Friday. Education | Students in
  England gained record levels of top grades in this year’s A-level exams,
  driven by young men producing their strongest performances outside the
  pandemic years. Gaza | More than 100 aid organisations working in the Gaza
  Strip and the West Bank have accused Israel of “weaponising aid” in its
  application of rules for groups involved in delivering humanitarian
  assistance. Climate crisis | UK firefighters have warned that 2025 is on track
  to beat the national record for wildfires, with frontline staff “pushed to
  their limits”. US news | Donald Trump cold-called Norway’s finance minister
  last month to ask about a nomination for the Nobel peace prize, Norwegian
  press reported. In depth: ‘They’re picking up people who are peaceful’ A total
  of 532 people were arrested in London last Saturday at the largest
  demonstration in support of Palestine Action. Most of them were simply holding
  supportive placards or signs. Half of the people arrested were aged 60 or
  older, according to police figures. Nearly 100 of those detained were in their
  70s and 15 were in their 80s. Police officers manning the protest were obliged
  to make these arrests. “It’s not how one would envisage the job. And they are
  just doing their job,” says Rajeev Syal. “When you speak to officers
  privately, they know that they’re not picking up thugs, they’re picking up
  people who are motivated by politics and beliefs, and they’re also peaceful.
  So it does certainly make police officers sit up and think.” Such events
  illustrate broader changes in policing driven by changing priorities in the
  Labour government. “I would say that this government has certainly moved
  towards a more authoritarian line on protests compared to previous
  governments,” says Rajeev. “It does look as if they are pivoting towards an
  electorate who are less comfortable with asylum seekers in their
  constituencies, who are more worried about small boats coming over the sea.
  They know they have to win those people over in order to win a general
  election.” The surge in Reform UK support has made the government nervous,
  even though we’re barely a year past an historic landslide election. Labour
  remain focused on so-called red wall seats dominated by white working-class
  voters in market, former mill and seaside towns. “Those are the places they
  think they’ve got to win people over,” explains Rajeev. *** What is the logic
  behind revealing the racial identity of suspects? In recent days, home
  secretary Yvette Cooper, welcomed new police guidelines that encourage forces
  to release the race and nationality of those charged in high-profile cases. It
  comes after an independent watchdog found that failure to share basic facts
  about the Southport killer last summer led to “dangerous fictions” which
  helped spark riots across the country. The policy is designed to work on two
  fronts, explains Rajeev. Firstly, the government wants to stop the rise of the
  far right and their ability to organise through misinformation and fomenting
  public disorder by spreading untruths about suspects (such as the Southport
  case). And secondly, it sends a signal to potential Reform UK voters that the
  government is taking the issue of people committing crimes while applying for
  asylum seriously. “Reform UK politicians have promoted the idea that the
  government and the police are involved in a cover-up of information, and this
  allows the government to say, ‘well we can’t be’,” says Rajeev. “I think
  there’s a lot of politics involved behind some of these decisions: it’s the
  politics of winning over Reform voters and undermining Reform in those pivotal
  seats that will define the next election.” *** What are the criticisms of the
  policy? The family of Bebe King, one of the three girls killed in the
  Southport attack last year, have expressed their dismay at the decision. They
  have urged ministers to reconsider support for disclosing the ethnicity of
  serious crime suspects saying the information was “completely irrelevant”. The
  family’s position is that mental health issues, and the propensity to commit
  crime, have nothing to do with ethnicity, nationality or race. Their argument
  is that such tragedies are too often used as a political football, especially
  by the far right. Campaigners have argued it could set a dangerous precedent
  for “dog-whistle politics”, Rajeev says: “When a suspect involved in an
  alleged crime is thought to be a black or brown person, or an asylum seeker,
  there will be huge pressure on the Home Office from right-leaning media and on
  social media to release details … but there won’t be as much pressure, when
  it’s obviously a white man.” “This will add to the distorted impression that
  minority ethnic people and refugees are responsible for a disproportionate
  number of crimes.” *** What is the counter argument? Lawrence Sherman, a
  criminology professor from the University of Cambridge, and ex-chief
  scientific officer for the Met Police, disagrees that it will inflame racial
  tensions – he believes the opposite to be true. Last summer, after false
  rumours spawned online about the Southport killer’s foreign nationality, the
  police were not in a position to correct the misinformation. “I would say that
  was a problem with the rules,” he says. These rules have now been changed.
  Sherman believes that stating the demographic details of suspects will help
  with transparency. “Especially in an era of what Richard Hofstadter, the
  American historian, called ‘paranoid politics’, in which people are always
  suspicious of ‘elites’ trying to cover things up. Greater transparency about
  all these things will help to shape a dialogue around peacekeeping on one hand
  and proportionality on the other.” And while the far right may be championing
  the changes, he cautions it may not have the result they are hoping for:
  “Being transparent about it will remind people that there’s a lot of very
  violent white people in this country.” What else we’ve been reading As early
  2000s attitudes favouring thinness return to the fore, Lucy Knight does a deep
  dive interview with the unapologetic Bob Harper, personal trainer and TV
  personality, who hosted the controversial US show ‘The Biggest Loser’. Saranka
  Maheswaran, newsletters team In the fourth year of Russia’s invasion of
  Ukraine, Oleksandr Mykhed writes movingly about his struggle to convey the
  shelling of his home town and his determination to resist accepting daily
  atrocities as the new normal. Aamna Scholars from across the globe unite in
  opposition to academic censorship, condemning the cancellation of a Harvard
  journal issue on Palestine. Saranka Wet wipes are blighting the UK’s
  second-longest river. The Guardian’s Kate McCusker goes to investigate
  London’s grimmest new landmark. Aamna In a deeply questionable move, the BBC
  have removed criticism of Robert Jenrick being called xenophobic after his
  insidious comments to the Mail on Sunday about “men from backward countries”.
  Saranka Sport Rugby | England’s women’s rugby team is gearing up for a home
  Rugby World Cup next week. Maud Muir, the team’s 24-year-old prop, reflects on
  their defeat in the last World Cup final and how the team have returned
  stronger than ever. Fantasy football | A whiff of condescension often follows
  those who play fantasy football. Jonathan Liew asks, is it less valid a way of
  consuming Premier League football than the other forms of obsession that
  surround it? Football | Tottenham have expressed their disgust after forward
  Mathys Tel was subjected to racial abuse on social media following his recent
  missed penalty. The front pages “Putin is ready to make a deal, says Trump
  ahead of Alaska meeting,” is the splash on the Guardian today. The Telegraph
  covers the same meeting with “‘The West must not be cowed by Putin’” and the
  Times: “Trump eyes economic incentives for Putin.” “Our VJ Day heroes ‘gave us
  more than freedom... they left us the example of how it can and must be
  protected’” says the Express. The Mirror puts it more succinctly with: “Thank
  you.” “Cost of fat jabs to triple,” says the Metro, while the Mail leads with
  “Fat jab price soars after Trump threat.” “Relief for Reeves as non-dom tax
  returns quell fears of mass exodus,” is the headline at the FT. “Students face
  yearly tuition fee hikes to bail out struggling universities,” at the i paper.
  “Now boot him out,” says the Sun, over an outrageous video on Tik Tok.

  weekend Our critics’ roundup of the best things to watch, read, play and
  listen to right now Music Cass McCombs: Interior Live Oak | ★★★★★ As bloated
  piles of “content” overfill our cultural to-do lists, a double album isn’t
  always met with a warm welcome. But the US singer-songwriter’s 74-minute new
  double LP begins at the highest songwriting level and barely wavers. Full of
  dreamscapes anchored in real-world settings, and backings that are both
  classically American but also have their own weird back-country accent, the
  album’s long runtime means the songs all feel wonderfully unhurried. If
  anything, 74 minutes doesn’t feel remotely long enough. Ben Beaumont-Thomas TV
  Alien: Earth | ★★★★☆ A new TV take on cinema’s greatest sci-fi horror
  franchise with a bristling, bewildering, overpoweringly confident aura. We are
  in the year 2120, corporations have taken over the universe, and which one
  achieves total domination will be determined by which of three technologies
  wins a “race for immortality”. Whether it’s a padded corridor filmed at a
  10-degree angle or the look in someone’s jaded eye, the series always has a
  way of making us feel like helpless prey being circled. Jack Seale Film Wolf
  Children | ★★★★★ In Mamoru Hosoda’s emotionally rich fable from 2012, single
  urbanite mum Hana moves her two werewolf children to a beaten-up country
  house, where she struggles to cope with their bestial and human needs. Her son
  is a clingy mother’s boy, her daughter a whirlwind of claws and teeth who
  insists on starting proper human school. Swept up in potent nostalgia for
  early parenthood, childhood and the cradle of nature itself, this is a modern
  classic. Phil Hoad Games Tiny Bookshop | ★★★★☆ A rare game made with readers
  in mind. The setup is simple: you’re selling books. Actual books. From
  Shakespeare and Agatha Christie all the way through to Toni Morrison and John
  Green, you are providing the inhabitants of a sleepy seaside and university
  town with books that are recognisable and real. The gameplay is rhythmic and
  mellow, and, dare I say it, genuinely cosy, providing players with a job that
  doesn’t feel like a job but a lovely escape into words and stories. Sarah
  Maria Griffin Today in Focus Ghosting, breadcrumbing, one-night stands: are we
  done with dating apps? More than a million people in the UK left dating apps
  last year – a problem so severe, explains the Guardian writer Kitty Drake,
  that the apps are in “financial crisis”. Cartoon of the day | Ben Jennings The
  Upside A bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all bad Amitav
  Ghosh is the latest contributor to the Future Library Project, known for his
  well-loved work in historical fiction and, more recently, climate change. The
  Future Library project was set up in 2014 by Scottish artist Katie Paterson.
  Innovatively, the project places books and nature in conversation with one
  another as authors contribute a new manuscript yearly, to be printed only a
  100 years later, in 2114. The paper used to print these books will come from a
  forest just outside Oslo, also planted in 2014. Paterson celebrates the work
  of Ghosh and the fact that “His stories traverse oceans and centuries,
  revealing how the climate crisis is inseparable from histories of empire,
  migration and myth”. Sign up here for a weekly roundup of The Upside, sent to
  you every Sunday Bored at work? And finally, the Guardian’s puzzles are here
  to keep you entertained throughout the day. Until tomorrow. Quick crossword
