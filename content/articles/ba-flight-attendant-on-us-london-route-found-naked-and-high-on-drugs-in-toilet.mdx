  A British Airways flight attendant was found high on drugs and completely
  naked in an onboard toilet during a flight from California to London, a court
  heard. Haden Pentecost, who was described as agitated, sweating and babbling,
  had to be stood down by the flight’s manager when he failed to help with any
  pre-flight safety checks. After complaining of stomach cramps and saying he
  needed to change his clothes, the attendant locked himself in one of the
  plane’s toilets. A colleague found him there naked and oblivious to the fact
  he had no clothes on. She had to dress him before moving him into a free seat,
  the court was told. The flight attendant was spoken to by the captain before a
  health professional was called, the magistrate was told. The court heard
  Pentecost had dilated pupils, a high heart rate, and had to be checked every
  20 minutes until the plane arrived at Heathrow, where paramedics took him to
  hospital. A blood test later revealed he had methamphetamine and amphetamine
  in his system. He has since been sacked by British Airways, the court was
  told. Pentecost appeared at Uxbridge magistrates court on Friday, where he
  pleaded guilty to performing an aviation function while impaired by drugs. The
  41-year-old from Basingstoke was granted bail to be sentenced at Isleworth
  crown court at a later date. British Airways has been approached for comment.
