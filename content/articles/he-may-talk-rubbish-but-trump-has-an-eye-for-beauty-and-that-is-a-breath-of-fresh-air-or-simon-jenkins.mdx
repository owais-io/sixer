  Trigger warning. Some readers may find this disturbing. Not everything Donald
  Trump says is mad and a lie. Not all of it is about money. Some of it is even
  worth saying. When he came to office, one of Trump’s first actions was
  extraordinary. He directed his fire at what he saw as the ugliness of American
  architecture. He demanded that at least federal buildings should be “visually
  identifiable as civic buildings, and respect regional, traditional, and
  classical architectural heritage in order to uplift and beautify public spaces
  and ennoble the United States”. All plans had to be submitted to Washington
  for his approval. There was more than an element of psychological obsession in
  such bureaucracy. American classicism – born of an admiration for France’s
  republicans – was a cult throughout the 19th century. The White House was
  based on a Dublin mansion. This week it was announced that it is to get what
  it has always lacked, a sumptuous new ballroom in which to receive and
  entertain foreign dignitaries. It is to be classical, with no nonsense about
  trying to make it look modern. That a president should seek to revive both
  regional and European style in the face of America’s relentless modernism is a
  breath of fresh air. That aesthetic interest extends to landscape. Trump left
  Scotland this week clearly still seething over the wind turbines waving over
  his coastal Turnberry and Aberdeen golf courses. At Turnberry eight tower over
  a hill inland. The president cannot avoid the sight of wind turbines. “Ugly as
  hell”, “monstrosities”, “so noisy and so dangerous”, and a threat to
  “Scotland’s tourism industry”, he has described them. Turnberry has lost Trump
  tens of millions of pounds over the decade since he bought it, but he loves
  golf and his mother’s home country of Scotland. The course also has the most
  exquisite view over an old lighthouse to the prominent island of Ailsa Craig
  across the water. There is no question: the turbines spoil the setting.
  Whatever Trump says about wind power killing birds and driving whales mad –
  most of it rubbish – there is no denying that about 4,000 giant turbines are
  now desecrating Scotland’s in-shore waters. There is no sign of any Scottish
  politician showing the slightest concern for their visual impact. The chief
  consideration is a turbine’s proximity to the grid, in other words profit. The
  price has been a real loss of wildness in Scotland’s once-glorious islands.
  Trump may be wrong to deride the value of renewable energy, and he may talk
  nonsense about other evils of turbines. But he is not wrong to demand that we
  should consider how and where to locate them. He pleads that in the US they
  are “killing the beauty of our scenery, our valleys, our beautiful plains”,
  and he is right. From what I have seen in California, turbines are located
  without a thought for their scenic impact. The reality is that I cannot recall
  a single British minister who would these days mention scenic beauty as a
  consideration in any area of policy, be it energy or planning or
  transportation. A generation ago, few in Britain would likewise have dared to
  complain about the building of ugly petrol stations in open country, where
  most now lie empty and derelict. So now no one – other than Trump – dares
  complain about turbines. Generally sent well offshore by the Cameron
  government in the 2010s, they are now to return onshore, enticed by the energy
  secretary Ed Miliband’s crazy subsidies. In spring came Trump’s most
  remarkable initiative. He announced he would take over from New York’s
  transport authority the future of its notoriously grim Penn Station, the
  original having been demolished in 1963. An adventurous plan had been hatched
  during his first term by his president of the Commission of Fine Arts, Justin
  Shubow. It was for a return to the station’s neoclassical forerunner, widely
  regarded as the US’s finest terminus and partner to the majestic Grand Central
  up the road. In April Trump duly appointed the federal rail operator Amtrak to
  revive Shubow’s project with a price tag of $7.5bn. Its majesty is to rise
  again on the initiative of a president eager to demonstrate stylistic taste in
  the American public sector. Eat your heart out Liverpool Street; get lost
  Euston. Clearly there is a limit to what Trump can change in just four years
  in office. Much of what he does is psychodrama and playacting. The president
  with whom he is becoming comparable is Teddy Roosevelt after 1900. He too
  tested the limits of presidential power. He too was frantic to lead the daily
  news agenda. But he too seemed to care about America’s natural environment,
  its forests and deserts, and a role for Washington in their custodianship. To
  show aesthetic sensitivity is today regarded as a weakness in a politician.
  Breathe the words art, conservation or natural beauty in the presence of Keir
  Starmer and you are dismissed as a nimby. Where Trump ends up leading his
  country and the western world may well prove alarming. It is certainly
  impossible to predict. But I find it refreshing to have a leader unashamed to
  talk of beauty and ugliness. I like him being ready to debate style. Above
  all, I welcome him calling out a scenic abomination when he sees one. Simon
