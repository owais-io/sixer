  Brexit isn’t working, and the British people know it. Poll after poll,
  including that unveiled this weekend by More In Common for the Sunday Times,
  shows that people are feeling the terrible damage caused by the deal forced
  upon us by Boris Johnson, Kemi Badenoch and the rest of the Conservative
  party, and want something different. The latest shows less than a third of
  Britons would vote to leave the EU if a referendum were repeated. There’s no
  doubt that fundamental change is needed. There’s no doubt the public will is
  there to make it happen. The question is: will Keir Starmer seize the moment
  and deliver it? There are big prizes on offer if he does. Giving our economy
  the boost it desperately needs, pulling it out of the cycle of low growth and
  high debt that the Conservatives plunged us into. Helping to raise more
  funding to lift our NHS and other public services off their knees. And,
  crucially, showing people that there is a better, more hopeful way forward
  than the nasty, nonsensical “solutions” they hear from Nigel Farage and his
  fellow snake-oil salespeople on the right. Because people are, understandably,
  fed up. After so many failures of Conservative and Labour governments,
  people’s faith in politics is at an all-time low. Many people just don’t
  believe that any government of any party can really make their lives better.
  And beyond our shores, they see a world rife with conflict and instability,
  making it even harder to envisage our domestic challenges being solved. It’s
  no surprise that all this disillusionment is fuelling the rise of rightwing
  populists such as Farage. Restoring faith in politics is critical if we are to
  save our country from a Reform UK-Conservative coalition of chaos. And acting
  decisively to fix our broken relationship with Europe is Starmer’s big chance.
  To be fair, the prime minister has made some tentative steps in the right
  direction. He has at least shown a willingness to take a more positive and
  pragmatic approach to Europe than his Conservative predecessors. He has talked
  about a youth mobility scheme and bringing down trade barriers in key sectors
  such as farming and energy. But so far, all these amount to little more than
  promises to “work towards” new deals. For all the smiles at the “reset” summit
  in May, there’s very little in the way of concrete progress to date. Like so
  much of this government’s record, it risks becoming too much like “continuity
  Sunak”: all process and promises, no real change. But with growth still
  flatlining, Donald Trump wreaking havoc on the global economy and populism on
  the march, this challenge is much too urgent for such timidity. Of course, we
  know why Starmer has been reluctant to go further. He’s spooked by the
  combined threat of the Conservatives and Reform, both of whom are itching for
  the chance to plunge Britain back into the nasty Brexit wars of the past
  decade. Well, I say let them try. With so many serious problems in need of
  urgent solutions, the British people have absolutely no appetite for all that
  division and distraction, and they will have no truck with politicians who do.
  The way to see off the populist right isn’t to cower in its shadow; it’s to
  step up and offer a compelling, positive alternative. So what does that look
  like? The first thing the prime minister should do is raise his sights when it
  comes to negotiating with the EU. This can’t be about the odd limited
  improvement for this sector here or that sector there. The government has to
  be far more ambitious than just trying to polish up the rough edges of
  Johnson’s bad deal. Just imagine if, instead, the prime minister set a clear
  target of leading the UK into a new customs union with the EU by 2030. That
  could be truly transformative. It’s the single biggest thing the government
  could do to turbocharge our economy in the medium and long term. It would set
  us firmly on the path back to the single market, with all the benefits that
  would bring. It would be a game-changer – not just for our economy, but for
  the future of British politics. And not only that. A clear commitment to work
  towards a customs union would unlock big benefits for the UK now. It would
  give us the power to finally sign a veterinary and plant health agreement to
  boost British farming, and secure that youth mobility scheme to give our young
  people incredible new opportunities to live, work and travel across Europe,
  while also helping British employers to recruit the workers they need. Or even
  something less headline-grabbing but potentially just as impactful, such as
  joining the European Union Aviation Safety Agency. Post-Brexit rules mean that
  air cargo firms – such as the one run by a constituent of mine – can’t have
  repair work done in Europe, apart from by the single German workshop that is
  recognised by the UK. It means they have to fly their planes all the way to
  the US just to get them serviced – at huge expense. With a more ambitious
  approach to Europe, we could get rid of that ridiculous red tape, and so much
  more like it. We could free British businesses to get on with their work,
  create jobs and grow our economy. That is the real change people across the
  country are crying out for. The opportunity is there and the rewards are
  great. I really hope the prime minister is listening. Ed Davey is the leader
  of the Liberal Democrats and MP for Kingston and Surbiton
