  Speculation that the chancellor could announce new property taxes in her
  autumn budget is likely to slow down an already price-sensitive housing
  market, estate agents have said. Rachel Reeves is reportedly considering a tax
  on the sale of homes over £500,000 and the removal of the capital gains tax
  exemption on primary residences above £1.5m as ways to boost income for the
  government. The property website Zoopla said changes to the taxation of homes
  over £500,000 “may make some buyers consider a wait-and-see strategy. This
  covers those who may possibly save money on purchases under £500,000 and
  concern those buying over this level as well.” It said a third of homes for
  sale were priced at more than £500,000, with London and the south-east of
  England in line to be most affected by a change. The website’s latest monthly
  snapshot of the property market showed the number of sales agreed was up by 5%
  year on year in July and that average prices had risen by 1.3%. One in 10
  homes listed had been reduced in price, above the five-year average of 6% of
  homes. Homes that have been reduced are typically on the market for almost two
  and a half times longer than those that are priced well when they go on the
  market, Zoopla said. Richard Donnell, an executive director at Zoopla, said:
  “Sellers need to understand local market conditions when considering how to
  market their home, setting the right price and how quickly they would like to
  sell. The risk of being too ambitious on price is your home taking more than
  twice as long to find a buyer, or not selling at all.” Jeremy Leaf, an estate
  agent and former chair of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said:
  “The market inevitably lost a little steam over the summer period with so many
  decision makers away and listings continuing to pile up.” He said agreed sales
  were going ahead but added: “Unfortunately, perhaps the government do not
  appreciate that even rumours of a new property tax can have a detrimental
  impact on housing market confidence and activity, which we certainly witnessed
  on the ground since the story broke last week.” Tom Bill, the head of UK
  residential research at Knight Frank, said: “A price-sensitive housing market
  has become a whole lot more price-sensitive over the last fortnight thanks to
  the speculation around property taxes.” He said that in the run-up to the
  budget there could be “weeks of more speculation in a tiresome re-run of 2024
  that will keep a lid on transaction activity and stamp duty revenue”.
