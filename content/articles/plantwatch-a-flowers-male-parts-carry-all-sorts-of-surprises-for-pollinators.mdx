  Plantwatch: A flower’s male parts carry all sorts of surprises for
  pollinators

bodyText: >-
  Flowers are surprisingly touchy, especially their male parts, the stamens,
  with hundreds of plant species performing touch-sensitive stamen movements
  that can be endlessly repeated. Insects visiting Berberis and Mahonia flowers
  to feed on nectar get slapped by stamens that bend over and smother pollen on
  to the insect’s face or tongue. This unwelcome intrusion scares the insect
  into making only a short visit, so the flower avoids wasting its nectar and
  pollen. The insect then finds another flower where it brushes the pollen off
  on receptive female organs and cross-pollinates the flower. An insect landing
  on the flowers of the orchid Catasetum gets a violent reception – whacked by a
  pair of sticky pollen bags shooting out at such great speed the insect gets
  knocked out of the flower with the pollen bags glued to its body. The flowers
  of triggerplants (Stylidium) of Australia carry their sex parts in a
  club-shaped organ and when touched, this club swings through 180 degrees in
  about 10 thousandths of a second, smacking a visiting insect with pollen and
  receiving any pollen it may be carrying. Afterwards the trigger quickly
  resets, ready to hit another visiting pollinator.
