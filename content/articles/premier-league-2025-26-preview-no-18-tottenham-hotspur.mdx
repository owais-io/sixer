  Guardian writers’ predicted position: 6th (NB: this is not necessarily Ed
  Aarons’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips) Last season’s
  position: 17th Prospects The sacking of Ange Postecoglou after he ended
  Tottenham’s 17-year wait for a trophy by winning the Europa League divided
  opinion among supporters, although the appointment of the experienced Thomas
  Frank has been generally received with enthusiasm. Not even that night in
  Bilbao was enough to save Postecoglou after Spurs ended last season 17th –
  their lowest placing since 1977 – having lost 22 games. But Frank, after
  cutting his teeth with a Brentford team that consistently punched above their
  weight, deserves the chance to show what he can do with more resources after
  the chair, Daniel Levy, opted for the Dane over candidates such as
  Bournemouth’s Andoni Iraola or Fulham’s Marco Silva. Frank will know a good
  start is imperative if Tottenham are to build on the momentum of their Europa
  League triumph that also secured Champions League qualification. The departure
  of the captain, Son Heung-min, for Los Angeles symbolised the end of an era in
  north London and there is plenty of work to do to make sure they are equipped
  to challenge on all fronts. Mohammed Kudus, Mathys Tel and João Palhinha – who
  should add some much-needed bite in central midfield after joining on loan –
  have bolstered a squad since weakened by the knee injury sustained by James
  Maddison. A move for Morgan Gibbs-White failed to materialise after Nottingham
  Forest dug their heels in and Spurs have rekindled interest in Eberechi Eze of
  Crystal Palace, having also targeted Manchester City’s Savinho. If Frank can
  secure more attacking additions he should at least be able to make Tottenham
  contenders for the top six again and satisfy Levy’s short-term remit of
  competing at the highest level in every competition, not just one. The manager
  Frank has become known as one of English football’s most personable managers
  in his seven years at Brentford but don’t let that fool you into thinking he
  doesn’t have a ruthless side. Over a crab starter and sole meunière prepared
  by Gary Lineker in January for the BBC’s Football Focus, Frank admitted he
  does lose his temper on occasions: “When something is really irritating you,
  it’s just a burst. Boom.” Tottenham fans will welcome another manager who
  provides his teams with a clear identity and has an ambition to play attacking
  football but who also recognises the value of being tough to break down.
  Off-field picture It has also been a summer of change in the boardroom at
  Spurs after the appointment of Vinai Venkatesham as the chief executive – he
  held the same role at their north London rivals Arsenal until last summer –
  after the departure of the long-serving executive director Donna-Maria Cullen.
  Levy and Spurs’ owner, Enic, have made no secret that they have been on the
  lookout for investors over the past few years, and there have been talks over
  selling lucrative naming rights to the stadium, which has hosted NFL, boxing,
  rugby and Kendrick Lamar among other things this year. Star signing Kudus is
  the first player to join Spurs from West Ham since Scott Parker in 2011, when
  the midfielder left a club that had finished bottom, and the forward’s arrival
  has excited supporters despite his disappointing final campaign at the London
  Stadium. The Ghana international showed during his first season after signing
  from Ajax in 2023 that he has the ability to thrive in the Premier League when
  utilised correctly, even if there were only glimpses of his talent as West Ham
  struggled under Julen Lopetegui and Graham Potter. It will be intriguing to
  see whether Frank regards Kudus as right-winger or has plans to use him more
  centrally as well – a position the 25-year-old has previously said he favours.
  Stepping up Mikey Moore has joined Rangers and the 18-year-old Croatia
  defender Luka Vuskovic looks poised to depart on loan as well despite starring
  in pre-season. But Frank will be relishing the chance to work Archie Gray
  after missing out on signing the versatile teenager from Leeds last summer
  when in charge at Brentford. Gray, who made three appearances for England’s
  Under-21s in the summer as they won the European Championship in Slovakia, was
  even pressed into emergency duty at centre-back for Spurs last season during a
  defensive injury crisis but will hope to establish himself in his favoured
  central midfield position. A big season for … There were rumours at the start
  of the summer that Cristian Romero might have played his last game for
  Tottenham amid strong interest from Spain, in particular Atlético Madrid. The
  2022 World Cup winner ended up staying and has been chosen as the captain
  after Son’s departure. Romero struggled with injuries last season, making 18
  appearances in the Premier League, but the 27-year-old has improved his
  disciplinary record and forms a strong partnership at the back with Micky van
  de Ven when both are fit.
