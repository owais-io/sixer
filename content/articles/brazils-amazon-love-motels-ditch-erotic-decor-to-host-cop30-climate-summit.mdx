  Guests at the Love Lomas Pousada in the Amazon city of Belém receive an email
  from reception before check-in with two questions, one conventional, the other
  unforeseen. “Could you kindly let us know what time you expect to arrive at
  our establishment,” the message reads. “And one other thing, our rooms feature
  erotic chairs. Would you like to have it removed?” With less than three months
  until tens of thousands of climate negotiators, campaigners and diplomats
  flock to this sweltering riverside metropolis to discuss the future of the
  planet, Belém’s love motels are racing to remodel themselves to receive
  visitors from around the globe. Ricardo Teixeira, the owner of Love Lomas,
  said a “de-eroticization” campaign was in full swing as motels – traditionally
  used for passionate rendezvous between lovers – stepped into the breach to
  help authorities cope with the huge influx of outsiders for November’s Cop30
  summit. Mirrored ceilings, pole dancing poles and sex chairs resembling a
  cross between a torture rack and a weight bench were being covered or removed.
  Mattresses were being changed and kitsch erotic artwork being stored away to
  ensure bashful conference-goers felt at home. “There’s a certain stigma
  [attached to motels] … because they charge by the hour … but the only
  difference is that they’re mostly used for romantic liaisons,” said Teixeira,
  urging delegates to make a booking at his 48-room drive-in, just around the
  corner from Cop’s main venue and directly opposite the environment
  secretariat. Teixeira insisted love-makers were not the only ones who
  frequented his motel, where bedside menus offer condoms and caipirinhas and
  there is a £1 surcharge for dirty sheets. During Covid, frontline health
  workers rented rooms to avoid infecting their families. Business travellers
  from the interior of Pará, a state the size of South Africa of which Belém is
  capital, sometimes used its air-conditioned chambers. “People still have the
  wrong idea about motels … that outdated image from TV and films that they are
  brothels,” complained Teixeira, who said visiting delegates were welcome to
  keep the erotic chairs, if they wished. “You never know, do you?” The love
  motel community’s efforts to support the climate summit comes at a delicate
  moment for Brazil’s government which is facing a backlash over the failure to
  sufficiently improve Belém’s hotel infrastructure since President Luiz Inácio
  Lula da Silva announced the city would host Cop30 two years ago. The lack of
  accommodation has caused a jaw-dropping surge in prices, with rooms hard to
  come by, even now. One report showed a budget hotel had hiked its rates from
  about £10 per night in 2023 to nearly £800 during the gathering, which is set
  to take place between 10 and 21 November. Earlier this month Austria said its
  president and negotiators would not attend the Amazon’s first-ever Cop summit
  citing “particularly high costs”. Some diplomats have even suggested partially
  relocating the event although Brazilian officials insist there is no “plan B”.
  In an open letter, the Climate Observatory watchdog warned the summit risked
  being “the most exclusionary in history” with civil society, representatives
  of developing nations and the press priced out. “A poorly attended Cop would
  be, as well as a historic humiliation for Brazil, a precious opportunity
  missed at a moment when we have just five years to keep the [Paris] climate
  agreement’s temperature target alive,” it said. So far, just 30% of the nearly
  200 countries that are part of the United Nations Framework Convention on
  Climate Change have reportedly managed to confirm bookings in Belém. Márcio
  Astrini, the Observatory’s director, voiced frustration that the lack of
  accommodation had supplanted the climate breakdown as the main topic of
  debate. “Fossil fuels is the key discussion we should have on the agenda right
  now … How is the world going to organize so there is a plan to transition away
  from fossil fuels? “[But] to have a negotiation about transitioning … you need
  to have a room full of negotiators … If the negotiators are saying they won’t
  come, how are you going to negotiate these topics? It simply won’t happen,”
  Astrini said. Addressing complaints over the lack of lodging earlier this
  year, Lula declared: “If there isn’t a five star hotel [available], sleep in a
  four-star one. If there isn’t a four-star one, sleep in a three-star one. If
  there isn’t a three-star one, sleep looking up at the stars … and it will be
  wonderful.” Authorities plan to deploy two cruise ships to serve as floating
  hotels for about 6,000 visitors. Belém’s sex moteliers have another solution
  in mind for policy wonks, ambassadors and reporters struggling to find
  affordable beds. “They are welcome here,” enthused Teixeira, who is the
  regional representative of the Brazilian Motel Association. Teixeira said
  motel bosses had so far offered to make nearly 600 of their estimated 2,050
  rooms available for the summit. Cristiano Ribeiro, the 51-year-old owner of a
  motel called Só Prazer (Pleasure Only), has rented eight of its 33 rooms to
  Cop-goers through a government website. Guests will pay $200 a night, or $280
  for rooms with jacuzzis. Ribeiro’s father, a truck driver who migrated to
  Belém in the 70s, founded Pleasure Only in 1995 – the year Cop’s first meeting
  was held in Berlin. Initially called Ponto G (G-spot), the motel changed its
  name to Pleasure Only after a copyright complaint from a rival. As he showed
  off his açaí palm-flanked premises, Ribeiro celebrated how Cop was
  transforming his culturally rich but economically disadvantaged home town.
  “It’s wonderful. We’ve progressed 30 years in one,” he said of the hundreds of
  millions of dollars of infrastructure investments that have turned much of the
  city into a construction site. Ribeiro has paid a graffiti artist to cover his
  roadside motel with murals celebrating the Amazon’s wildlife and Indigenous
  peoples, hoping foreign visitors would enjoy their stay. By the time they
  arrived, the adult channels on its televisions would have been deactivated;
  the sex shop selling nurses’ costumes removed; and the laminated catalogues
  offering furry handcuffs and “Real Peter” dildos replaced by English-language
  menus offering food. Pole dancing poles could be used as coat hangers. Climate
  negotiators would receive a warm reception. “We’ve all kinds of clients,”
  Ribeiro said as a pair of lovers swept into Pleasure Only on motorbike for a
  lunchtime romp. “We welcome them all.”
