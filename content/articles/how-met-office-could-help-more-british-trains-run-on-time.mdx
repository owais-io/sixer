webTitle: How Met Office could help more British trains run on time

  From “leaves on the line” to “the wrong kind of snow”, the railway system in
  the UK has been a byword for feeble excuses about why the weather has affected
  trains running on time. Both were legitimate reasons in their time – new
  trains were much lighter than their predecessors, so their wheels unexpectedly
  spun round on the wet leaves rather than gained traction on the rails – and
  the wrong snow was in such tiny flakes that it passed through the protective
  grilles of diesel engines and shorted the electrics. Perhaps both events
  should have been foreseen. To avoid such weather-related problems, and far
  worse in the future, Network Rail and the Met Office have signed a deal to
  speed up research into the extreme events of the present and the future.
  Currently, increasing heat causes rails to buckle and overhead power lines to
  sag, resulting in speed restrictions or total closure. Storms can blow down
  trees and flood lines but sometimes, fearing danger, services can be cancelled
  because of undue caution. Better expert advice should keep services running
  longer. Perhaps with Britain’s complex geology the most difficult and
  currently unpredictable danger is landslips caused by heavy rain. This has
  already caused accidents and the research will be aimed at prediction and
  prevention to avoid it happening again.
