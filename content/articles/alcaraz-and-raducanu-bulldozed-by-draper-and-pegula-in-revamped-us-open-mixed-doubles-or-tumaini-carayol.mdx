  After many long months of discussion and anticipation, the doubles partnership
  between Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz came and went in the blink of an eye
  in a well‑populated Arthur Ashe Stadium. Despite ample smiles and enjoyment on
  the court, they were outclassed in a battle of British No 1s by a sharp
  Jessica Pegula and Jack Draper, the top seeds, who reached the quarter-finals
  of the revamped mixed‑doubles competition with a 4-2, 4-2 win. With one win
  under their belt and their confidence growing, Pegula and Draper then rolled
  through their quarter-final against Mirra Andreeva and Daniil Medvedev, easing
  into the semi-finals with an emphatic 4-1, 4-1 victory. They will face
  Danielle Collins and Christian Harrison on Wednesday afternoon for a place in
  the final, which takes place on Wednesday night. In a draw filled with surreal
  scratch partnerships, the first bracket was particularly striking. Draper and
  Raducanu have known each other since their childhood days when they were
  rising up the national rankings in Great Britain while dreaming of becoming
  professional players. When in February the US Open announced its “reimagined”
  mixed‑doubles competition, the two British players pairing up seemed like a
  logical option. Instead, they found themselves facing each other inside the
  biggest tennis stadium in the world. Raducanu had played just three doubles
  tournaments in her entire career before this week and the match started with a
  reminder of her inexperience as she sprayed a backhand drive volley far wide.
  That first point set the tone for a difficult day as she was continually
  vulnerable at the net. Draper and Alcaraz have not spent much more time on the
  doubles court, either, but it was Draper who tackled the contest with total
  aggression. He played two great matches, constantly looking to close down the
  net and punching holes in his opponents with his heavy topspin forehand. He
  also showed his old friend Raducanu no mercy at all, successfully targeting
  her throughout their match. Perhaps the most significant result on Tuesday was
  Draper’s mere presence on the court. He has not competed since his
  second‑round defeat at Wimbledon last month after opting to withdraw from both
  the Canadian Open and the Cincinnati Open because of a left forearm injury.
  After his blistering start to the season, the past few months have been tough
  with injury and two difficult defeats at the French Open and Wimbledon. One
  year after his breakthrough semi-final run in New York, he looks fit and ready
  again. While the partnership between Raducanu and Alcaraz has dominated the
  headlines since it was announced, the pairing of Draper and Pegula is a result
  of numerous withdrawals but they have now formed a formidable team. Pegula is
  one of the most accomplished players across both singles and doubles, the
  current singles No 4 and a former doubles No 1. Pegula’s solid baseline play
  and intelligence on the court provided Draper with the platform to continually
  attack the net, and they have put themselves in position to compete for the
  title. On Monday night, after her triumph against Jasmine Paolini at the
  Cincinnati Open, Iga Swiatek did not finish her media duties until around
  10pm. She and Alcaraz, the men’s champion, travelled from Cincinnati together
  on a private jet and arrived in New York at 12.50am. Just over 13 hours after
  finishing her work in Ohio, she was on Grandstand training with her new
  doubles partner, Casper Ruud. No matter, she put together two brilliant
  performances to deliver her second and third wins in less than 24 hours. Sara
  Errani and Andrea Vavassori, the defending champions and the only doubles
  specialist team in the draw, marched through the rounds in pursuit of another
  title – and justice for the doubles specialists who have been squeezed out of
  the competition in order to accommodate the singles stars. From the first ball
  of their opening-round match against Elena Rybakina and Taylor Fritz, the
  second seeds, the Italian pairing were on a mission and they carried
  themselves like a team determined to represent all doubles players. Every
  point was played with manic intensity, especially from Errani, with their
  screams of “allez” and “vamos” directly punctuating almost every success. Most
  importantly, they played flawlessly, erecting a wall at the net and picking
  apart their inexperienced opponents as they eased to a straight‑sets win
  against Fritz and Rybakina, then Karolina Muchova and Andrey Rublev. They will
  face Swiatek and Ruud for a spot in another final. “For us it was important to
  send a message before the tournament,” Vavassori said. “When we got the
  wildcard, when Eric [Butorac] called me, I was grateful to play. At least
  there were not so many doubles players. We are also playing for them. I think
  it’s important to show also that doubles players are great players.”
