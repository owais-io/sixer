  I’ve never been one to run with the “let’s just stick to football” line. But
  every person has their breaking point. Mine came this week when Andrew Dillon
  – a man who’d spent the previous four days weighing and measuring a slur, and
  four days negotiating five weeks down to four – carved out a good chunk of his
  press conference reminding us that Snoop Dog was “a grandfather and a
  philanthropist”. A few hours later, footage emerged of a less than
  grandfatherly and less than philanthropic headline act, accompanied by the
  headline “Snoop Dog’s Dig at Gay Parents”. That was it for me. Within a few
  hours, the AFL had appointed one of the state’s preeminent spin doctors and
  crisis managers. She could deal with this sort of stuff. The rest of them
  could just step out of the way, take their learnings, close the roof and
  bounce the effing ball. There’s always lots of talk about wildcard rounds and
  manipulating the fixture to create more games of interest. But it’s usually
  best to let these things unfold organically. The drama at the Adelaide Oval on
  Friday for Ken Hinkley’s final game couldn’t have been conjured up by some
  sizzle merchant. Nor could the sense of dread that enveloped the MCG when it
  looked for all money as though Collingwood had thrown away the double chance
  and their season. Sunday’s Bulldogs v Fremantle clash had been circled many
  months before. It pitted two very different teams, and two very different
  coaches. Whatever happened, it was clear that the loser was going to be
  catastrophised. For Bulldogs in particular, to be the highest scoring team in
  the land and still miss would be an indictment on, well, something – the team,
  the coach, the backline, the fixture, something! And that’s precisely what
  happened. They were so disappointing. It ended up being a season infuriatingly
  on-brand for Beveridge’s Bulldogs. They bucked a scarcely believable injury
  list early in the year, rolled out half a dozen of the best and most exciting
  players in the competition, and were competitive in nearly every game they
  played. And they still missed. But this was Fremantle’s day and Fremantle’s
  story. When their midfield got cranking in the second term, they had the
  Bulldogs’ defence under extreme pressure. It’s a back six that’s wobbly at the
  best of times, let alone with Shai Bolton, Caleb Serong and friends charging
  at them. Fremantle’s seven goals was their best haul in a quarter this year.
  And when Josh Treacy put his side 32 points up early in the second half –
  double the Dogs’ score – Luke Beveridge had the pinched look of a man who’d
  spent the previous few hours podcasting with Snoop. It was Fremantle’s
  backline that held firm during their streak of close wins, and they were
  resolute to a man again on Sunday. Alex Pearce was excellent on Sam Darcy and
  Brennan Cox likewise on Aaron Naughton. But their gamebreakers were further
  afield. Bolton hasn’t quite been the player they hoped he’d be this year. He
  has come close to tearing games to shreds but he’s been a bit cute at times,
  and a bit lost out on starvation corner. The stakes and stage suited him on
  Sunday. He attended more stoppages than usual and spent the afternoon whirring
  through the midfield, slicing through congestion and lurking forward to great
  effect. In a team that can sometimes be a bit cautious and plain, he gives
  them their zing. At no stage could the Dogs get an appropriate match-up for
  him. Another to step up was Jye Amiss. He has been a bit of a peripheral
  player for months now. He’s done a lot of decoy and bullocking work, but has
  been spilling marks and spraying set shots that would normally be a breeze for
  him. When he kicked a long-range goal in the first quarter, his confidence was
  back. A preposterous dribbling goal on his left was followed by a bender from
  deep in the opposite pocket. There was so much pressure on the Dockers heading
  into this match. Every game for the past few months has felt like an
  elimination final, a mini referendum on the future of the coach. History
  hasn’t been kind to them. Five times they’ve needed to win the last game of
  the home and away season and five times they’ve missed out. But they’ve been
  an excellent team on the road all year, beating Gold Coast, GWS, Collingwood
  and now the Bulldogs away. They met the moment yesterday, and fully deserved
  their September slot. For the Bulldogs, it was the same old story. All their
  losses this year were narrow. But all highlighted their inability to defend.
  When they’re fully charged, they’re a wonderful team to watch. But they’re so
  flawed. In quarters, in games, in months, in seasons, hell for almost the
  entirety of the Beveridge era, they’ve been determined to make things as
  difficult as possible for themselves. And now their finals fate rests with
  Essendon, which is no way to live your footballing life.
