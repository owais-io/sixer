  Dawn Dusk review – handbag designer deals with grief over murdered sister and
  dead friend

  Chicago-based Chelli Look, the subject at the centre of this diffuse
  documentary, seems like a nice person, with a talent for designing and making
  minimalist leather handbags. Not long out of high school, the best friend with
  whom she planned to start a business died in a car accident. Then her elder
  sister, Megan Henneberg, was murdered in 2007 by her husband Brian, leaving
  Chelli, her parents, siblings and extended family to deal with the harrowing
  loss. And yet, no matter how much sympathy you might feel for Chelli and her
  family’s trauma, or interest you might have in her bagmaking skills, or
  engagement with her as a person, somehow those core components don’t coalesce
  to make this feature-length documentary feel vital or even especially
  necessary. A self-described introvert, Chelli herself is a pretty opaque
  figure although she speaks quite expressively and intelligently about her
  approach to design. We only get tiny glimpses of her home life with husband
  David, so she’s not really developed as a “character” sufficiently to carry
  the film. Meanwhile, the story around her sister’s murder has something of a
  shroud around it, which is understandable to an extent, but then turns the
  film into a strange fan dance, alternating revelation with concealment about
  the facts of the case. In the end, the fact that Chelli found a way to forgive
  her brother-in-law in a religious sense, seems to be the big takeaway, but the
  wafty haziness around the whole issue reduces the murder to a brutal but
  incidental noise off-screen. The most engaging parts of the film are the
  scenes where Chelli is at work at her fancy industrial Juki sewing machine in
  her alarmingly tidy, sepulchre-white studio. The hum of the machinery is as
  seductively lulling as an ASMR video and watching Chelli buy leather hides is
  pure shopping pornography. Even more visually lush is the sequence where
  Chelli goes off to Florence to take a course in leatherwork and design to
  refine her skills, offering the film-makers a chance to shoot one of the
  world’s more photogenic cities at crepuscular times of the day. All of which
  makes the surprise ending even more baffling, denying viewers the
  redemption–through–small-business-ownership ending the film appears to be
  striving for. • Dawn Dusk is on digital platforms from 15 August.
