  One student has died and 15 people were taken to hospital, some with serious
  injuries, after a school bus rolled in regional Victoria. The bus, carrying 28
  high school-age students from Christian College Geelong, was turning left on
  to the Hamilton Highway at Stonehaven, north-west of Geelong, when the
  incident occurred at about 8.20am on Wednesday, Victoria police said. A girl
  died at the scene and a boy was airlifted to the Royal Children’s hospital
  with serious but non-life-threatening injuries. There were also “numerous
  students injured”, police said. The driver of the bus, a 76-year-old Hamlyn
  Heights man, sustained non-life-threatening injuries and was taken to hospital
  by road ambulance. He was later discharged and was helping police with
  inquiries, police said. Police said the exact circumstances surrounding the
  collision were yet to be established and an investigation was ongoing. Sign
  up: AU Breaking News email The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, extended her
  “deepest sympathy” to the family and friends of the girl killed on her way to
  a “regular school day”. She said her thoughts were also with the broader
  school community, and with the bus driver. Allan encouraged any members of the
  public with further information, including dash cam footage, to contact police
  for their ongoing investigation. As of Wednesday evening, Victoria’s deputy
  premier and education minister, Ben Carroll, said two students remained in the
  RCH, and nine in University hospital Geelong, with a “range of injuries”,
  including a skull fracture. “By all reports it was a very horrific scene …
  it’s been a really, really tragic, harrowing day.” Paramedics transported 10
  patients by road ambulance to University hospital Geelong. An additional 14
  patients with minor injuries were assessed on site and transported by bus to
  the hospital, where three stayed, and the others returned to their families.
  Another patient presented at the hospital “by private means”, Ambulance
  Victoria’s statement said. Detective Snr Sergeant Paul Lineham said on
  Wednesday afternoon that the bus, from Christian College Geelong, was
  travelling south along Friend In Hand Road towards the Hamilton Highway, a
  “routine school pickup”, when it failed to negotiate a left-hand bend and hit
  the rail on the side of the road, causing the bus to roll over. Some parents
  turned up to the scene of the crash and were also looked after by first
  responders, Lineham said. He said the bus had seatbelts but investigators were
  yet to determine where each passenger was sitting. “The seatbelts will form
  part of the investigation as to whether they were worn or not,” he said. Allan
  and Carroll both thanked first responders for their “professionalism and
  compassion in such difficult circumstances”. “This tragedy will weigh heavily
  on them too – especially in what is already a dark and difficult week,” Allan
  wrote in a post on X on Wednesday afternoon. “These moments touch us all. They
  remind us to hold our loved ones a little tighter.” Dr Mathilda Joubert, the
  executive principal of Christian College Geelong, confirmed on Wednesday
  afternoon that the student who died was a pupil of the school. “This is a
  profoundly distressing situation for our entire school community,” Joubert
  said, adding that the school was unable to provide further information while
  the police investigation continued. Carroll said on Wednesday evening that the
  bus was travelling to the school’s three Geelong campuses (among its total
  five): a junior, middle and senior school. He said the department of education
  was working to support the school, and that counselling professionals remained
  on site. The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, member for Corio, had
  earlier confirmed reports of the death of a student in the crash in a post on
  X. He said his “heart breaks hearing the devastating news of a school bus
  incident and death of a student in my home town of Geelong”. “I do know this
  will affect so many in Geelong as we are a tight-knit community,” Marles said.
  Jess Wilson, Victoria’s shadow minister for education, said the opposition
  expressed its “deepest condolences to the students and families impacted by
  the … unimaginable tragedy”. – with AAP
