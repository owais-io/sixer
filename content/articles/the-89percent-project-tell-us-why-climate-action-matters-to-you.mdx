  A global study of 130,000 people in 125 countries found that 80 to 89% of
  people around the world want more to be done about the climate crisis – but
  mistakenly assume their peers do not. More than two-thirds said they were
  willing to give 1% of their income to fight the climate crisis. Crucially,
  however, they thought only a minority of other people – 43% – would be willing
  to do the same. People in China, the world’s biggest polluter, were among the
  most concerned, with 97% saying the Chinese government should do more to fight
  the climate crisis and four out of five willing to give 1% of their income.
  The world’s second biggest polluter, the US, was near the bottom, but still
  had about three-quarters of its citizens saying its government should do more
  with almost half willing to contribute. We’re interested in finding out why
  climate action matters to you and if anyone has inspired you to take action.
  Would you give 1% of your income to help the climate? How can political
  obstacles be overcome? If you’re having trouble using the form click here.
