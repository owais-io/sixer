  The bishop of Monmouth, Cherry Vann, has been elected as the new archbishop of
  Wales, becoming the UK’s first female archbishop and first LGBTQ+ leader in
  the church in Wales in a symbolic break with recent safeguarding scandals.
  Vann, 66, was chosen on Wednesday after an electoral college made up of clergy
  and laypersons met for two days of deliberations at St Pierre church near
  Chepstow. Andy John, the former archbishop, announced in June he was standing
  down with immediate effect after calls for his resignation gathered pace after
  two reports that revealed a culture of excessive drinking, bullying and sexual
  misconduct at Bangor Cathedral. There is no suggestion that John, who became
  archbishop in 2021, behaved inappropriately. Last month, he issued an
  “unreserved and unequivocal” personal apology regarding “the situation”,
  saying he took full responsibility for failings under his leadership. “I
  repent and offer no excuses nor justifications,” he added. In addition, six
  “serious incident reports” were sent to the Charity Commission in the past 18
  months, four relating to safeguarding and two relating to financial matters.
  Financial irregularities reportedly include more than £400,000 spent on new
  furnishings for the cathedral with inadequate consultation, and £20,000 for
  trips to Rome and Dublin for senior staff. Many of the concerns about Bangor
  centred on a period when Siôn Rhys Evans was its acting dean – in effect chief
  executive – while continuing in post as secretary of the Bangor diocese. Both
  posts are senior full-time jobs, and it is unprecedented for one person to
  manage both sets of responsibilities. In February 2024, Rhys Evans stood back
  from both roles without explanation. Two members of the cathedral’s college of
  priests have called for an independent inquiry into events at Bangor. Vann,
  originally from Whetstone in Leicestershire, became a bishop in the Church in
  Wales in 2020, following 11 years as archdeacon of Rochdale in the diocese of
  Manchester. In 1994, she was among the first women in the Church of England to
  be ordained as a priest. The archbishop-elect studied at the Royal College of
  Music and the Royal Schools of Music before entering an Anglican theological
  college in 1986. Vann’s appointment comes as the Church of England is in a
  drawn-out process to choose a new archbishop of Canterbury following Justin
  Welby’s resignation last November after he was criticised in a report on a
  major abuse scandal. His successor is expected to be named in the autumn. The
  archbishop of Canterbury is the most senior cleric in the country and the
  leader of the global 80 million-strong Anglican church, of which the Church in
  Wales is a self-governing province. Some senior figures in the Church of
  England are believed to favour a female archbishop, arguing that this would
  signal a new beginning and more modern church after decades of acrimonious
  rows over gender, sexuality , as well as abuse scandals. A few might be irked
  that the Welsh church has beaten them to it. Vann’s sexuality could be
  controversial in the global church, which is deeply divided on the issue; most
  African provinces are staunchly opposed to same-sex marriage. In 2017, global
  church leaders imposed de facto sanctions on the Anglican church in Scotland
  after it voted in favour of allowing same-sex couples to marry in church. The
  archbishop-elect is a patron of the Open Table Network, an ecumenical
  Christian community for LGBTQ+ people and their allies, and previously held
  senior positions in the governance of the Church of England. Her biography
  describes her as living with her civil partner and their two dogs. Same-sex
  marriages are not allowed in the Church in Wales, but clergy are permitted to
  be in same-sex civil partnerships. The church’s governing body approved
  blessings for same-sex civil marriages and civil partnerships in 2021 for a
  five-year period that will shortly be reviewed. It is expected to be extended,
  or the church could move forward with a possible vote next spring on allowing
  gay marriage. In the Anglican church in England, clergy are permitted to be in
  same-sex relationships, but are expected to remain celibate. Marriages of
  same-sex couples can be blessed within regular church services. Vann becomes
  the 15th person to hold the title of archbishop of Wales after being chosen
  from the five eligible serving Welsh diocesan bishops by an electoral college
  made up of three elected clerics and three elected laypeople from all six
  dioceses. A nominee must secure two-thirds of the votes. Traditionally, the
  longest-serving bishop is elected as leader, which in this case would have
  been the bishop of St Asaph, Gregory Cameron. The new archbishop will be
  enthroned at her home cathedral, St Gwynllyw in Newport, at a later date. •
  This article was amended on 31 July 2025. An earlier version said Cherry
  Vann’s home cathedral of St Gwynllyw was in Monmouth; however, it is in
  Newport.
