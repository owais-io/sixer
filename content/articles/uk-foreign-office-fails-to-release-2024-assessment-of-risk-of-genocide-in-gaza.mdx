  The Foreign Office has failed to release an internal assessment made in June
  last year that reportedly concluded that there was no serious risk of Israel
  committing genocide in Gaza. It has also refused to disclose if an updated
  assessment of a risk of genocide has been made. The rights group Amnesty
  International in June tabled a freedom of information request to see the 2024
  assessment, but when officials failed to reply within the statutory one month
  deadline Amnesty lodged a formal complaint with the Information Commissioner’s
  Office. It also asked if there was an updated government assessment of
  Israel’s intent to comply with international law, including a re-examination
  of the risk of genocide. An increasing number of legal experts, as well as two
  prominent Israeli NGOs, have recently declared Israel is showing genocidal
  intent in Gaza, but the issue is contested and yet to be determined by the
  international court of justice (ICJ). On Friday, the Liberal Democrat leader,
  Ed Davey, described the new Israeli plan to occupy Gaza City and displace tens
  of thousands of Palestinians as ethnic cleansing. Ministers have been accused
  of adopting a contradictory position on the question of whether a genocide is
  occurring by telling parliament only the international courts can make valid
  assessments, yet at the same time telling the domestic courts – in a recent
  case brought by the human rights group Al Haq – that Foreign Office officials
  had examined Israel’s actions to see if a serious risk of genocide existed,
  and concluded Israel’s actions and statements did not create such a risk.
  Extracts from that assessment were recently revealed to the courts by the
  government in witness statements, but Amnesty is seeking access to the full
  document. In part of a document sent to ministers, officials said: “No
  evidence has been seen that Israel is deliberately targeting civilian women or
  children. There is also evidence of Israel making efforts to limit incidental
  harm to civilians.” It adds: “There is no evidence of a high-level strategic
  decision, passed down through military chains of command, like that which was
  in evidence for the massacre and deportations at Srebrenica that were found in
  the Bosnian genocide case to constitute genocide (the ICJ’s only finding of
  genocide to date).” Some of the bases of the assessment made more than a year
  ago appear to be outdated. The Foreign Office found there was no pattern
  suggesting deliberate targeting of civilians or civilian objects, the rough
  ratio of military to civilian casualties in the conflict was in line with
  conflicts fought in similarly dense urban environments, and the ratio of
  military to civilian casualties also had to be assessed taking into account
  Hamas’s systematic use of civilians and civilian objects as shields, the
  report said. It overall concluded that Israel’s pattern of conduct in the
  hostilities could reasonably be explained as a legitimate military campaign
  waged as part of an intensive armed conflict in a densely populated urban
  area. Ministers have conceded Israel has breached international humanitarian
  law, but this is different from genocide. More than 60 parliamentarians in a
  letter to the Foreign Office sent in May asked for any updated British
  genocide assessments to be made public. Kristyan Benedict, of Amnesty, said:
  “The government’s refusal to engage with us on this raises the suspicion that
  the government has made a further genocide assessment, and it is likely to be
  different from the 2024 claim that there was no serious risk of a genocide.”
