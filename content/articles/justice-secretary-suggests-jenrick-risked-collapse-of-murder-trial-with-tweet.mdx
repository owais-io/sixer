  The justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has suggested that her Tory
  counterpart, Robert Jenrick, was guilty of “risking the collapse of trial”,
  after he was criticised in court for tweeting about a criminal case. Jenrick,
  the shadow justice secretary, posted on social media about a murder trial a
  week after it had begun, making comments that the judge said were “ill thought
  through”. The Liverpool Echo reported that Jenrick’s tweet, described as
  “appalling, outrageous and egregious” by the defence counsel, was raised in
  court during the trial because of fears it could prejudice proceedings and
  amount to contempt of court On Wednesday, speaking to the House of Lords
  constitution committee about the rule of law, Mahmood said: “I do think that
  it’s incumbent on politicians of all stripes to play their part in maintaining
  the integrity of our system. “Certainly, if a Labour politician, and somebody
  whose behaviour I could more directly influence through our party structures
  was, for example, risking the collapse of a trial, it [sic] would be
  repercussions. “Needless to say, no parliamentarian should be risking a
  contempt [of court] and the possibility of a murderer walking free.” While
  Mahmood did not refer to Jenrick by name, her comments were clearly aimed at
  him, coming the day after the report in the Echo. Writing about the trial of
  Elias Morgan for the murder of Lenny Scott, Jenrick was said to have written
  on a since-deleted post on X, on 1 July: “Lenny exposed corruption and took on
  the gangster controlling a prison wing. He received threats to his life, but
  he was left unsupported. Four years later he was shot dead. That will enrage
  any decent person. We need radical change, now.” His comments were raised in
  court, without the jury, by the prosecutor, Alex Leach KC, the following day,
  when he told Mr Justice Goose that “the post is problematic because it
  delivers as apparent fact what the prosecution relies upon”. The prosecution
  took steps to have it taken down and it is no longer online. Caroline Goodwin
  KC, representing the defendant, said that the post “put political ambitions
  first and the requirements of justice second”. She also said that Jenrick, a
  qualified solicitor, “should know better” than to share a “hard-lined opinion”
  about continuing proceedings, the Echo reported. She said: “We ask he reflects
  carefully as a shadow lord chancellor should. We ask he thinks and he refrains
  from commenting further.” Goose reportedly told the courtroom that there was a
  danger in commenting as Jenrick had and that “this was ill thought through
  given it’s an ongoing trial”. On Friday, Morgan was found guilty of Scott’s
  murder, which meant the concerns raised in court about Jenrick’s comments
  could be reported. On Tuesday, Goose sentenced Morgan to a life term with a
  minimum term of 45 years. Mahmood told the committee: “There are some very
  important rules that all politicians with their huge platforms should bear in
  mind. It will be an absolute travesty of justice if somebody walks away from a
  murder charge because of social media activities and the desire to have a
  viral tweet.” The Guardian has approached Jenrick for comment.
