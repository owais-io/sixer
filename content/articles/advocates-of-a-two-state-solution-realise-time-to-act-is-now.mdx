  It may prove to be a momentous week in Middle East diplomacy, and not just
  because Keir Starmer – after much hesitation – made his historic pledge on
  Tuesday that the UK would recognise a Palestinian state at the UN general
  assembly in September if Israel did not agree to meet certain conditions. The
  day was momentous because in New York, Brussels, Jerusalem and even Berlin the
  battle lines are becoming clearer between the moderate and extremist visions
  for the future of Gaza and the West Bank once the war finally ends. Advocates
  of a two-state solution, including a radically reformed Palestinian Authority
  governing without Hamas, have finally realised the time to act is now, or else
  risk their vision being buried by Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right
  minister of finance, Bezalel Smotrich, under the benign watch of Donald Trump.
  The choice is between coexistence and forced displacement of hundreds of
  thousands of Palestinians. Britain’s policy that it could hold back playing
  the “recognition card” until the point of maximum impact in the peace process
  was based on a belief that the UK still held sway in the Middle East, but also
  rested on an outdated interpretation of the future trajectory of Israeli
  politics. The reality is that Israel in the wake of 7 October has moved
  further and further away from notions of a two-state solution. On Tuesday,
  Smotrich said the re-establishment of Israeli settlements in Gaza was no
  longer “wishful thinking, but part of what had become a realistic work plan.
  Gaza is an inseparable part of Land of Israel,” he said. It comes amid reports
  that Netanyahu will give Hamas a few days to agree to a ceasefire on his terms
  and if not he will begin annexing parts of the Gaza Strip. Smotrich also said
  of the West Bank: “Israel is making a revolution there by implementing de
  facto sovereignty, regulating construction making declarations changing the
  DNA of the entire system and paving roads.” Formal sovereignty over the West
  Bank will be completed in the government’s term, he predicted. In this context
  it became absolutely critical that proponents of a two-state solution
  galvanise even if to make a last stand to keep the concept from being
  destroyed by Israeli bulldozers. In the words of the French foreign minister,
  Jean-Noël Barrot, the two-state solution was “in mortal danger. On both sides
  the proponents of rejection seem to be winning.” A postponed conference in New
  York held this week provided the chance to turn the tide. Barrot argued:
  “After 22 months of fruitless attempts, it is illusory to hope a lasting
  ceasefire can be obtained without outlining a shared vision for the postwar
  period in Gaza, without charting a political horizon, an alternative to a
  permanent state of war.” Before the conference the French president, Emmanuel
  Macron, presented a letter from the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud
  Abbas, in which he made a series of concessions. Among other commitments, the
  PA committed to hold presidential elections within a year throughout the
  occupied territories, including East Jerusalem. The aim was to achieve
  generational renewal – and the resignation of 89-year-old Abbas. Speaking to
  the New York conference, the Palestinian prime minister, Mohammad Mustafa,
  reiterated that Hamas must stand aside. But the conference, co-chaired by
  France and Saudi Arabia, did not just focus on reform of the PA and the
  marginalisation of Hamas, it set out in a seven-page document – the New York
  declaration – containing a path to a two-state solution, one in which Israel’s
  security can be assured without further occupation, repression and annexation,
  the grim dystopian vision offered by Netanyahu. The declaration merges
  previous Arab and European postwar plans for Gaza. It proposes: “Following the
  ceasefire, a transitional administrative committee must be immediately
  established to operate in Gaza under the umbrella of the Palestinian
  Authority. The declaration supports the deployment of a temporary
  international stabilisation mission, mandated by the UN security council, and
  welcomes “the readiness expressed by some member states to contribute troops”.
  It emphasised Gaza was an integral part of the Palestinian State and must be
  unified with the West Bank. Hamas must end its rule in Gaza and hand over its
  weapons to the Palestinian Authority with international engagement. It also
  holds out the aspiration that the ending of the Israel-Palestinian conflict
  will lead to a wider regional settlement, even if the Gulf states currently
  balk at offering normalisation with Israel. In this wider context, the
  internal British debate about the conditionality attached to the British
  pledge to recognise a Palestine state looks somewhat marginal. From the left,
  Starmer faces criticism for not offering recognition as a principled assertion
  of the Palestinians’ right to self-determination. His offer certainly lacked
  the high-flown rhetoric about statehood embedded in the French offer, and it
  seems misplaced to cast the offer as a punishment against Israel. Moreover, by
  refusing to act jointly with Macron last week, Starmer’s decision appeared to
  be a retreat in the face of an internal rebellion, rather than showing
  leadership. Nevertheless the UK decision was greeted warmly in New York when
  announced by the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy. The conditionality, the
  last vestige of the UK hang-up about using recognition as an influential card,
  also helps to clarify that Israel faces an essential choice between conflict
  and coexistence. Since Israel has immediately rejected Starmer’s terms, UK
  recognition now looks an inevitability in September. There are growing signs
  in Brussels and Berlin too that patience with Netanyahu’s methods has run out,
  even if they cannot agree on a form of punishment. In the US the latest Gallup
  poll shows only 8% of Democrats support Israel’s strategy. It is now the task
  of diplomats to harness the momentum created in New York, and the worldwide
  abhorrence at Israel’s war in Gaza, to persuade Donald Trump to think more
  strategically about a Palestinian peace. It may yet prove impossible, but at
  least the groundwork has now been laid.
