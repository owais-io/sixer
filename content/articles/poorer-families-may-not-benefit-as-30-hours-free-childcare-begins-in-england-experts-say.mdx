  Disadvantaged children who stand to benefit most from early years education
  are at risk of missing out, experts have warned, as the final stage of the
  rollout of the government’s funded childcare scheme gets under way in England.
  From Monday, working parents who earn up to £100,000 a year will be entitled
  to 30 hours free childcare a week during term time for children from the age
  of nine months until they start school. Families who do not earn enough
  however (more than £9,518) to be eligible would have to pay £205 a week on
  average for the same amount of early education for a child under two,
  according to analysis by the Coram Family and Childcare charity. The charity
  says a child of working parents who meet the eligibility requirements will
  receive three times as much government-funded early education than a
  disadvantaged child by the time they start school. The Department for
  Education (DfE) says there is support in place for the most disadvantaged
  children. Lower-income families can get 15 hours a week for their
  two-year-olds, and all three- and four-year-olds are eligible for 15 hours
  regardless of their parents’ working status. Other help is also available,
  dependent on circumstances. Keir Starmer, the prime minister, said: “Launching
  30 hours of free childcare is a promise made and a promise delivered. It’s a
  landmark moment for working families across the country, and a clear sign that
  our plan for change is not just words – it’s action.” Lydia Hodges, the head
  of Coram Family and Childcare, warned that the gap between entitlements for
  disadvantaged children and those with working parents was wider than ever.
  “Whilst the expansion of funded childcare hours is very welcome support for
  many working families, the focus on parental income risks excluding
  disadvantaged children who stand to benefit the most from early education, and
  further widening the disadvantage gap. “Steps must be taken to remove the
  emerging imbalance and ensure all children have access to the same opportunity
  to boost their outcomes through early education, no matter their parents’
  circumstances.” The final stage of the rollout gets under way amid continued
  warnings about recruitment and funding challenges. The National Foundation for
  Educational Research (NFER) said early years workers earned 36% less on
  average than other comparable workers in 2022-23. While growth in staff
  numbers is now “on track”, the NFER said this may not necessarily continue.
  “It is critical that workforce challenges in the sector are addressed, so that
  it can be both attractive enough to recruit new staff and also retain a higher
  level of staff, to ensure it can meet the demands of the expanded free
  childcare entitlement,” said Jack Worth, the NFER education workforce lead.
  Neil Leitch, the chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, added: “The
  harsh reality is that under current levels of funding – particularly given the
  huge impact of national insurance increases – many providers will struggle to
  keep their doors open in the coming year, while those that do are likely to
  struggle to deliver the affordable, flexible service that families need.” The
  education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said: “It was never going to be easy,
  but against all odds we’ve delivered through our plan for change. And this is
  just the beginning. I want access to high-quality early years for every single
  family that needs it, without strings and without unfair charges. Over the
  next few years, that is my commitment to parents.” Victoria, a headteacher and
  single mother from Gloucester, said: “I work five days a week without any
  family support. The government-funded hours are going to save me about £600 a
  month, but they also mean I can continue my career. Without them, I’d likely
  have to cut my working hours. This rollout is a significant step forward in
  women’s rights and workplace participation.”
