  Exhibition of the week Encounters: Giacometti x Mona Hatoum Second in a sparky
  series of shows comparing sculptors of today to the 20th-century legend who
  captured the slender survival of the human spirit in spindly simplified
  figures. • Barbican, London, 3 September to 11 January Also showing Toyen A
  welcome look at this Czech surrealist painter who has only recently been
  rescued from oblivion. • Richard Saltoun Gallery, London, from 3 September to
  4 October Paul McCartney Photographs of the Beatles by McCartney as they
  became world famous in the winter of 1963. • Gagosian Davies Street, London,
  until 4 October Suzanne Song Highly calculated, precise and impressive
  abstract art from New York. • White Cube Mason’s Yard, London, from 4
  September to 3 October Andrew Geddes This Scottish artist of the Romantic era
  is revealed as a pioneer of etching under the influence of Rembrandt. • The
  National, Edinburgh, until 28 September Image of the week A new retrospective
  shows how the lauded photographer David Bailey shook up fashion imagery in the
  1960s with his Box of Pin-Ups. His sitters, some of whom like Michael Caine
  were already famous, were photographed with head and shoulders tightly cropped
  against a harshly lit white background. “They’re the hardest shots to do,” he
  said at the time. See more images here. What we learned An old master painting
  looted by Nazis was spotted on an estate agent’s website Two-time Archibald
  prize-winning painter William Robinson died aged 89 There are poses and prizes
  in the best art this autumn Catherine Leroy was fearless in the face of war
  Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s cinematic art has a primal power The UK has some
  glorious garages Photographer Martin Parr captures the magic of the mundane
  African American life during the Great Depression was laid bare Masterpiece of
  the week The Charity of St Nicholas of Bari by Girolamo Macchietti, c.1555-60
  This quirky painting is typical of the narrative technique of Macchietti’s
  master Giorgio Vasari, for whom he worked much of his career at the Palazzo
  Vecchio in Florence. Vasari was not just an architect and painter but also
  author of The Lives of the Artists, a massive compendium of tales, true and
  fanciful, about artists themselves. At the Palazzo Vecchio he directed an art
  of anecdotal storytelling including in the Studiolo of Francesco I where
  Macchietti was one of the painters. Both the charm and silliness of the Vasari
  style are seen here. Saint Nicholas of Bari chucks gold balls into the house
  of an impoverished gentleman at night, while the whole family are asleep: now
  his daughters will get dowries and be spared having to become sex workers,
  according to the story. Macchietti captures the sleepiness of the whole
  household, but also suggests the anxiety that stops these people sleeping
  comfortably. They sit in their clothes as if they’ve been talking and worrying
  until they finally fell asleep in the small hours – and that’s when Saint
  Nicholas delivers his gifts. I’m not going to mention how this saint became
  Santa Claus – it’s still August. • National Gallery, London Sign up to the Art
