  For a lawyer who specialised in the arcane area of law known as “state
  immunity”, Hazel Fox was a remarkably influential figure. Her chosen subject
  is increasingly the cause of courtroom and political clashes. Fox, who has
  died aged 96, was one of the foremost authorities documenting the interaction
  between domestic and international legislation as aggrieved parties attempt to
  sue foreign governments for alleged torture, murder or financial misdeeds. Her
  volume The Law of State Immunity, published in 2002 and already into its third
  edition (updated by her successor Prof Philippa Webb), analyses the cases
  through which the traditional, absolute freedoms enjoyed by states to engage
  in diplomatic relations have come under mounting pressure to give ground to
  other demands in an ever more interconnected world. Fox appeared in few cases.
  One was a 1988 high court libel hearing in which Mohamed Al Fayed, the former
  owner of Harrods, sued a Gulf state ambassador for accusing him of
  impersonating an official in order to gain access to the VIP lounge at
  Heathrow Airport and attempt to import “prohibited goods”. The court dismissed
  the case on the grounds of inviolability of diplomatic documents. Fox was also
  involved in a landmark torture claim brought against the Kuwaiti government in
  1996 by Sulaiman Al-Adsani, a British national who had also been a member of
  the Kuwait air force. The judges in London dismissed the case due to state
  immunity. In the case of Augusto Pinochet, the Chilean former dictator
  arrested in London in 1998 under an extradition warrant to face human rights
  abuse charges in Spain, Fox was reported to have been consulted by one of the
  UK judges. Her lucid, explanatory talks recorded for the United Nations Office
  of Legal Affairs on state immunity are still available online. Fox was a legal
  blue blood: the stepdaughter of Lord Denning – the distinguished former master
  of the rolls – and wife of an appeal court judge. A sparky and dynamic
  presence, she moved in rarefied judicial and academic circles. She was born in
  the colonial hill station of Maymyo, near Mandalay, in what was then
  British-administered Burma. Her father, Jack Stuart, was the engineer
  responsible for dams, water control and bridges on the Irrawaddy River; her
  mother, Joan (nee Elliot-Taylor), loved painting. Hazel was the second of
  their three children. In the mid-1930s the family returned to England. Stuart
  advised on water irrigation in Palestine and Persia. Hazel was sent to board
  at Roedean, a girls’ school near Brighton. Along with the school she was
  evacuated to Keswick in the Lake District during the second world war. There
  she learned of her father’s sudden death in 1941, but continued lessons – not
  seeing her mother or siblings until weeks afterwards at the end of term. At a
  school drinks party for parents, Joan Stuart met the also recently widowed
  high court judge, Tom Denning; the couple married in 1945. Hazel, who was head
  girl at Roedean, went to Somerville College, Oxford, the following year to
  study modern languages. She did not enjoy the course and, with the help of her
  stepfather, switched to jurisprudence, graduating with a first in 1949. Moving
  to London, she joined chambers and in 1950 was called to the bar, where she
  practised for several years before marrying, in 1954, Michael Fox, a barrister
  who later became an appeal court judge. She began to research, publishing
  International Arbitration: Law and Procedure in 1959 with the Foreign Office
  official John Simpson. Her language skills had tilted her interests towards
  international law and enabled her to read foreign court reports. In the 1960s,
  Fox joined a group exploring legal records in the Foreign Office archives.
  Their investigations were published in the British Digest of International
  Law. While bringing up four children, she also served as a magistrate at Tower
  Hamlets juvenile court. In 1976, she returned to Oxford to teach law, later
  becoming chair of the London Rent Assessment Panel and the London Leasehold
  Valuation Tribunal. In 1982, she was appointed director of the British
  Institute of International and Comparative Law (BIICL). She revitalised the
  institute through fundraising and partnerships with industry and other
  organisations, turning it into one of the most influential UK forums for
  debate on international law. She also pioneered legal agreements that enabled
  prospecting companies to exploit oil and gas offshore in areas where maritime
  boundary disputes remained unresolved. As general editor of the International
  and Comparative Law Quarterly, she was renowned as a tough editor, damning one
  book for being “a woolly diatribe”. Described by friends as “doughty” and a
  “formidable legal scholar”, she was the only member of a British legal
  delegation to post-Soviet eastern Europe to bring her bathing costume and
  insist on a dip in the Baltic. Her laughter, charm and good humour inspired
  loyalty and affection. She named one of her cats BIICL (pronounced “Bikle”) as
  a play on her professional duties. At one point she was a candidate to become
  the UK’s judge at the European court of human rights in Strasbourg. Fox
  returned to the bar in her 60s, appearing at the international court of
  justice in The Hague in a border dispute between Botswana and Namibia. She
  continued practising until her mid-80s. In 1993, she was appointed an honorary
  QC for her legal scholarship, and in 2006 made a Companion of the Order of St
  Michael and St George (CMG) for contributions to international law and
  diplomacy. Outside law, she loved gardening and reading. In later life she
  cared for her husband, whose final years were marred by blindness and
  Alzheimer’s disease. She is survived by her children, Matthew, Patrick, Jane
  and Charles, and nine grandchildren. • Hazel Mary Fox, barrister and legal
  author, born 22 October 1928; died 12 July 2025
