  YouTube has become popular to watch on TV with children and older people
  choosing the video platform when they first switch on their televisions.
  Viewers aged 55 and over watched almost twice as much YouTube than they did in
  2023, with 42% of them watching on a TV. The platform is also the most popular
  first TV destination for generation Alpha viewers, aged four to 15. We’d like
  to hear from people who watch YouTube on their TV more than other channels.
  When and why did your watching habits change and how does it differ to what
  you grew up with? What are your favourite YouTube shows and why? This
  Community callout closed on 6 August 2025. You can see the article that
  included respondents to this callout here. You can contribute to open
