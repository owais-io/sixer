  Local politicians have recognised the right of a famous chalk stream, the Test
  in Hampshire, to flow freely and unpolluted. Councillors on Test Valley
  borough council voted unanimously to acknowledge “the intrinsic rights” of the
  rivers within its boundaries, including the Test, which is renowned for its
  trout and fly fishing. It means councillors and officials will have to keep
  the Test front and centre when making decisions on planning, land use, water
  management and biodiversity. Members of the Tory-led council promised to
  support efforts by citizens to monitor the Test and ask the UK government to
  publish an annual “state of the rivers” report to track progress in protecting
  river ecosystems. Geoff Cooper, a Liberal Democrat councillor who put forward
  the motion to recognise the Test’s rights, said rivers were one of the
  country’s greatest assets. He said: “It is our duty to protect those for
  future generations to come. It is not just sewage that endangers our rivers,
  there is the impact of road runoff, the impact of agriculture, the impact of
  planning and development. It is not just about pointing your fingers at the
  water company, it is all the factors that endanger our rivers.” There are only
  about 200 chalk streams in the world. The 39-mile Test is important for
  Atlantic salmon, while birds such as kingfishers, marsh harriers and little
  grebes live on and around it. Parts of the stream, which flows from chalk
  downs into Southampton Water, are ideal for watercress growers. The Test
  featured in Richard Adams’ novel Watership Down, in which some of the rabbits
  flee down the stream on a punt. Cooper said biodiversity in and around the
  stream had declined dramatically over the last few decades. When he used to
  drive alongside the riverbanks a quarter of a century ago, his car windscreen
  would be covered by insects, he said. On the way to the meeting at which the
  rights of the Test were ratified there were hardly any, though it is high
  summer. He described this as a red flag. The motion was seconded by Janet
  Burnage, another Lib Dem, who said: “We live in one of the most beautiful
  areas of the English countryside. We should and must be proud of this. Without
  the River Test, its tributaries and all the other rivers that flow through
  Test Valley, we would not have the wonderful bounty of nature around us.”
  Other local authorities around the world have begun to afford rivers official
  rights and the supporters of the Test hope the new initiative will inspire
  even more. The Earth Law Center, a US charity, championed the idea of giving
  nature a voice in the legal system, allowing it to defend its rights just as
  people can. In 2017, New Zealand granted legal personhood to the Whanganui
  River in the North Island. This year Lewes district council in East Sussex
  produced a rights of river charter to help protect the River Ouse. Ali Morse,
  water policy manager at the Wildlife Trusts, said rights of rivers motions
  could help ensure council decisions, particularly around planning, are made
  with the health of rivers in mind. Morse said: “They can protect them from the
  cumulative harms of additional water extraction, wastewater discharges, urban
  runoff and other pressures. Home to many significant species, this focus can
  also help to reverse the tide for declining wildlife in freshwaters. “For the
  River Test and other precious chalk streams across the country, for example,
  we hope the threat of Atlantic salmon extinction can be avoided once the right
  safeguards are in place. The rights of rivers work is seeing councils like
  Test Valley getting ahead of the curve.” The Test motion says the river should
  have “the right to flow – unimpeded, seasonal, and natural; the right to
  perform essential functions within the ecosystem; the right to be free from
  pollution and contamination.”
