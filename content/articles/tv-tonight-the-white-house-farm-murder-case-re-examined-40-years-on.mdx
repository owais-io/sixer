  White House Farm: Murder, Bloodline and Betrayal 10pm, Channel 4 In 1985, the
  Bamber family – Nevill and June, their daughter Sheila Caffell and her
  six-year-old twin sons – were found dead at their Essex home. At first, police
  believed Caffell was responsible for the murders before turning the gun on
  herself, but suspicion turned to her brother Jeremy Bamber. He was convicted
  in 1986 on five counts of murder and has been in prison ever since, but has
  always insisted he is innocent. The grisly, perplexing case of “the farmhouse
  of death” is scrutinised here by some of those who responded to and reported
  on the crime. Hollie Richardson The Great British Sewing Bee 9pm, BBC One Art
  week should be a breeze for this crafty bunch. But with a place in the
  quarter-final coming into view, the pressure is on. After making dolls’
  dresses and painters’ overalls, the theme for the Made to Measure challenge is
  pop art – but who will confuse it with impressionism? Oops. HR The Jury:
  Murder Trial 9pm, Channel 4 A second series of the social experiment that
  recreates a real trial for the benefit of a new batch of 12 laypeople. A
  Liverpool mother says she stabbed her boyfriend in self-defence; as arguments
  rage, it’s as much a reality show about individuals whose behaviour is altered
  by the knowledge that they are on camera as it is a comment on the judicial
  system. Jack Seale Tommy: The Good. The Bad. The Fury 9pm, BBC Three It can’t
  be easy having Tyson Fury as a brother – particularly if you are also a boxer.
  In this glossy series, Tommy Fury looks to establish his own niche, opening
  the doors to the cameras and discussing doubts, ambitions and family. He also
  gets into the ring for some gentle sparring with his elder sibling. Phil
  Harrison Resident Alien 10pm, Sky Max Season four of the daffy sci-fi comedy
  veers into Doctor Who territory as powerless Harry and D’Arcy don curly wigs
  and flares to zap back to the 1970s. Can they convince time-travelling frenemy
  General McCallister to give up an artefact that could restore Harry’s alien
  mojo? Graeme Virtue Crime Scene Cleaners 11.05pm, Channel 4 This week on true
  crime’s answer to Mrs Hinch, a Las Vegas team encounter a corpse so decomposed
  its outline is etched into the mattress. Meanwhile, in the UK, an evicted
  tenant in Newcastle has booby-trapped his former home with dirty needles
  suspended from the ceilings and doorframes. Ellen E Jones Film choice Wheel of
  Fortune and Fantasy (Dir: Ryusuke Hamaguchi), Tuesday, 1.20am, Film4 The
  director of 2021’s Drive My Car, Ryusuke Hamaguchi, released another, even
  more affecting film the same year. This one comprises three short stories in
  which encounters inadvertently lead to emotional revelations: a model realises
  her best friend has unknowingly fallen for her ex-lover; a former student is
  asked to “honeytrap” a professor and novelist she admires; two strangers
  mistake each other for old schoolmates. Bergmanesque dissections of
  relationships mingle with heartfelt, cathartic confessionals to profound
  effect. Simon Wardell Live sport The Hundred Cricket: Northern Superchargers
  Women v Manchester Originals Women, 2.45pm, BBC Two From Headingley, Leeds.
  The men’s teams play at 6pm. Carabao Cup football: Sheffield Wednesday v
  Leeds, 7pm, Sky Sports Football All the second-round matches are available on
  Sky Sports+. On Wednesday, Grimsby v Manchester United is on ITV1 and Sky
  Sports Football at 7.30pm.
