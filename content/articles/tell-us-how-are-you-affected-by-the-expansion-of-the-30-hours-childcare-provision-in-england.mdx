  Tell us: how are you affected by the expansion of the 30 hours childcare
  provision in England?

bodyText: >-
  From 1 September 2025, families in England who meet certain work and income
  criteria will be able to claim 30 hours of free childcare per week – as part
  of the Free Childcare for Working Parents scheme. Some are celebrating the
  potential break from burdensome childcare costs for working families. However,
  critics say that the childcare sector still faces considerable funding and
  recruitment challenges, which may go unaddressed while the scheme places
  higher demand on nurseries and charities. Further, those who earn below £9,518
  or are excluded from the eligibility criteria might be left behind if other
  provisions are not as thorough. We would like to hear from anyone who is going
  to be affected by the rollout – whether you are an eligible or ineligible
  parent, a childcare sector worker, or an early years sector expert. Are you
  optimistic about the announcement? What has your existing experience led you
  to believe about the sector and this particular support plan for families?
