  The contingent of neo-Nazis arrived at Flinders Street station about an hour
  before Sunday’s anti-immigration rally was due to start. A hundred or so men,
  dressed in black, strode across Princes Bridge in a bloc, weaving through the
  large crowd that had already gathered under a sea of Australian flags. There
  were plenty of people in the lead-up to the so-called March for Australia on
  Sunday, and many who attended, who said that the widespread promotion of the
  rally by known neo-Nazis did not mean it was organised by them; or that the
  presence of the National Socialist Network (NSN) in the crowd did not mean it
  was central to the day’s message. Even if they were there, some said, you
  didn’t have to agree with everything they said in order to attend. In
  Melbourne, however, neo-Nazis were not just central to the march, they led it,
  all the way to the steps of parliament. And the National Socialist Network
  leader, Thomas Sewell, when he addressed the crowd to huge cheers, clearly
  laid out the role he envisioned for “my men” in the “fight for [Australia’s]
  survival” against “ginormous empires of the third world”. Members of the group
  allegedly went on to attack a First Nations protest site, Camp Sovereignty, in
  Melbourne’s Kings Domain on Sunday evening. In Sydney too, the New South Wales
  leader of the group spoke to cheers of “send them back” from onlookers as
  Australian flags flew in the background. Pamphlets were handed out for a
  far-right political party about the “plague level” of immigration. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email In some cities, politicians spoke at the rallies. In the
  lead-up, parts of the media interviewed march organisers and showed the flyers
  on television. “It was only about recruitment,” said Mario Peucker, an
  associate professor at Victoria University, of the presence of far-right
  figures on Sunday. “It was an opportunity to mingle with people who basically
  [are] their target group … presenting themselves as the only voice for them.”
  Victoria police said it was too early to confirm whether the alleged attack on
  Camp Sovereignty or any of the other activity complained about at the rally
  would be investigated as “prejudice-motivated”, the force’s term for offences
  that could also be described as hate crimes. From TikTok to the streets The
  first mentions of a “March for Australia” came after the Palestine Action
  Group’s March for Humanity, which saw massive crowds (police estimated 90,000
  but organisers said the figure was closer to 300,000) walk across the Sydney
  Harbour Bridge on 3 August to oppose Israel’s actions in Gaza. Online, the
  event incensed several high-profile nationalist accounts, one of which made
  AI-generated images of the bridge covered in Australian flags. Not long later,
  a TikTok video emerged from an anonymous account. Over stock footage of
  Australian flags, it called for rallies on 31 August: “We finally stand up for
  ourselves and take this country back.” A woman who goes by the name Bec
  Freedom online claimed to be in touch with the video creator, “a young kid”.
  In early August, she began responding to tweets from One Nation’s Pauline
  Hanson and various online influencers with a poster calling for Australians
  “to rise” on 31 August. In an X space on 11 August (where live audio
  conversations occur on the X platform), Bec said messaging should follow
  certain steps: “So, protect Australian heritage, culture, way of life. Next
  step, protect European culture, heritage, way of life. The next step is
  protect white heritage. So it all means the same thing. “By saying it that
  way, it is more appealing to the public. It’s going to deter them from saying,
  ‘Oh, it’s a Nazi rally, blah, blah, blah’. ‘Australian’ is white.” The March
  for Australia website launched on 8 August and the ABC reported that an
  earlier version of the March for Australia websites included a reference to
  the white supremacist concept of “remigration” – the forced return of
  immigrants back to their country of origin. The ABC report makes clear it had
  been unable to establish exactly who is responsible for the website. As the
  date approached, there was confusion about who the organisers of the rallies
  were in each state, although statements on the March for Australia Facebook
  page distanced the events from white supremacists. “In particular, recent
  claims by Thomas Sewell of White Australia are not reflective of the
  organisers nor the politics of March For Australia. We are not associated with
  their organisation,” it posted on 12 August. In a video on 22 August, Bec said
  she and other organisers were not members of any extremist group, and were not
  endorsing violence. “All we are doing is gathering en masse to fight for
  Australia,” she said. The rallies also brought together many elements of the
  pandemic-era anti-lockdown movement and others, but despite the messaging of
  the March for Australia accounts, Nazi groups clearly intended to capitalise
  off the events, issuing a press release in the lead-up claiming to have
  “positive ongoing contact with the event organisers nationwide” and promising
  that members would be speaking at March for Australia events. In response, Bec
  posted on Facebook that she was no longer involved with the Melbourne event.
  “The National Socialist Network will not be stopped or banned from attending
  the March For Australia events,” she wrote. “Anyone who shares similar
  opinions on the reason for these events is welcome to attend, so long as they
  are not causing any trouble or being violent. Anyone causing trouble or being
  violent will be removed.” She also said “just remember that there will be
  people there that we don’t all necessarily agree with entirely, but if we are
  all able to come together in unity under this message and our flag, then we
  can really make a visual impact that we are not happy with the state of
  Australia as it currently stands”. British protests and Trump raids The
  rallies come amid growing anti-immigration protests in the UK as well as the
  Trump regime’s raids and deportation of migrants. These ties were recognised
  in March for Australia messaging, with the main account posting on Instagram
  in support of Operation Raise the Colours. This movement urges members to
  raise British flags around the country and post photos, and the 31 August
  events in Australia was praised in turn by British “patriot” accounts.
  Aurelien Mondon, a UK-based academic who attended the recent protests there,
  has written extensively about how immigration is often used by those on the
  far right to appeal to the mainstream. He also says it is important not to
  describe such movements as “populist”, even when they involve the support of
  politicians. “When we allow the far right to be described as populist, we are
  incorrectly implying that they are tapping into what the people want or that
  they speak for the ‘silent majority’,” Mondon and a fellow academic, Alex
  Yates, wrote in a piece for the Conversation last year. In February, Mike
  Burgess, Asio’s director general, used his annual threat assessment to outline
  the spectre of the far right. “We expect nationalist and racist violent
  extremists to continue their efforts to ‘mainstream’ and expand their
  movement,” he said. “They will undertake provocative, offensive and
  increasingly high-profile acts to generate publicity and recruit. “While these
  activities will test legal boundaries, the greatest threat of violence comes
  from individuals on the periphery of these organised groups.” Rallies
  represent a new escalation While there was a range of grievances on display
  about perceived immigration rates on Sunday, it was clear for many that the
  return to an imagined white Australia was a central theme. For Jordan
  McSwiney, who researches the far right at the University of Canberra, the
  weekend’s rallies brought to mind the 2015-2017 anti-Islam and
  anti-immigration street protests of Reclaim Australia. This time, however,
  far-right groups were not shielding their involvement. McSwiney noted how
  “easy it has been for the NSN to basically use the shield of ‘ordinary mums
  and dads’ to sell white supremacy to a big crowd of people who may very well
  have genuine concerns … that won’t be fixed by stopping immigration.” In his
  view, the recent response of state and federal governments to these movements
  – banning known Nazi symbols, for example – has been a distraction, and has
  not made it meaningfully more difficult for neo-Nazis to organise and recruit
  in Australia. As has been the “softball condemnations” of some politicians in
  response to the rallies – and the presence of others. For Peucker, Sunday’s
  rallies represent a new escalation that demonstrated how the views of some who
  consider themselves “part of the ordinary Aussie mainstream” overlap with the
  political agenda of openly white nationalist groups. “It’s not that white
  supremacy, which was present clearly yesterday, is something that the
  neo-Nazis in some evil, secretive fashion introduced into the political
  mainstream,” Peucker said. “It is something that has always been present in
  parts of the mainstream.” March for Australia and Bec Freedom were approached
  for comment.
