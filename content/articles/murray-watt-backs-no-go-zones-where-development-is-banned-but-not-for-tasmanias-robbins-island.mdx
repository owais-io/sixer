  Tasmania’s Robbins Island

  Australia’s environment minister, Murray Watt, has backed the creation of
  “no-go zones” where development will be banned in some places under a revamped
  nature law, but said Tasmania’s remote Robbins Island – the site of a
  contentious windfarm proposal – does not qualify. Watt this week said the
  Albanese government would accelerate its plan to overhaul the Environment
  Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act so that legislation was
  introduced to parliament this year, sooner than previously suggested. He has
  promised the changes would improve nature protection by introducing
  environmental standards against which developments are measured, lead to
  faster decisions by “removing duplication” and boost transparency. The
  legislation would also create a national environmental protection agency
  (EPA). But the details of the overhaul, the EPA’s design and the government’s
  planned path to get the changes through parliament – whether with the support
  of the Coalition or the Greens – are yet to be revealed. Government reviews
  have repeatedly found the existing laws are failing nature. Speaking on
  Friday, Watt said the government supported the “concept of no-go zones” as a
  “good way to help deliver the fast ‘yeses’ and fast ‘nos’ that businesses are
  looking for”. “Of course, more than anything, it delivers greater
  environmental protection by establishing at the very beginning of a process
  areas where activity cannot happen,” he told Guardian Australia. Watt
  confirmed the government would drop the “nature positive” name that his
  predecessor, Tanya Plibersek, used to describe her plan to revamp the EPBC Act
  in the last parliamentary term. Under this label, Plibersek was on the brink
  of a deal with the crossbench last year to create an EPA before the prime
  minister, Anthony Albanese, intervened to scupper the agreement after industry
  pressure from Western Australia. Internationally, nature positive has been
  defined as halting and reversing nature loss by 2030 measured against a 2020
  baseline and achieving “full recovery” by 2050. It would require retaining
  existing natural ecosystems and restoration work on damaged and lost nature
  areas. Watt said the government was dropping the term because his experience
  suggested people did not understand what it meant, but had not abandoned the
  idea. “We need to communicate these concepts in ways that the average person
  relates to, but we absolutely remain committed to the principle of not just
  protecting and reducing environmental damage, but restoring our environment.
  That will be a central principle in the reforms,” he said. Watt was applauded
  by industry but criticised by some conservationists on Friday for approving
  the Robbins Island windfarm in north-western Tasmania. Birdlife Australia had
  called for the area to be declared a “no-go site” due to its importance as a
  feeding site for migratory shorebirds, and for the critically endangered
  orange-bellied parrot and the endangered Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle. The
  minister said “having reviewed the scientific evidence” the government did not
  believe Robbins Island qualified as a no-go site, and had instead attached 88
  conditions to the windfarm’s approval the proponent, Acen Australia, must
  meet. The conditions included conducting parrot surveys for three years before
  construction can begin, and developing and implementing a plan to evaluate and
  manage the risk of birds colliding with turbines. Watt said Australia needed
  more renewable energy and dismissed objections from the former Greens leader
  Bob Brown, a sharp critic of the Robbins Island development, arguing he
  opposed “any major development that is sought to occur in Tasmania”. Christine
  Milne, another former Greens leader and a patron of the Bob Brown Foundation,
  said “of course” the country needed more renewable energy, but the
  environmental impact of the Robbins Island windfarm on birds and Tasmanian
  devils would be too great. She said she had “zero confidence” in the
  conditions Watt had imposed on the project. “This is a disaster for the
  Tasmanian environment and for threatened species,” she said.
