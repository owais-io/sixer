  Zara, 26 We probably have sex less now than when we lived apart, but it’s
  amazing that when the mood strikes, we can just do it I’ve known Max since I
  was 10. We were friends at high school and became “lovers” through some steady
  teenage flirting. Our first sexual experience was after a Halloween party,
  unplanned. I imagine it was like everyone’s first time: bad. It’s funny
  looking back, thinking how awkward we were. Being so young, there was a kind
  of shame associated with sex: it was gossipy and a lot of people were getting
  called slags. When we started shagging regularly, we were just so horny and
  doing it whenever we could – at most, seven times a day. Once we did it in a
  portable toilet. It was like: “OK, we’re sexually active!” We’ve been together
  for more than a decade now and are so involved in each other’s lives, sharing
  the same friends and hobbies. There have been phases over the years when it
  has been a test, emotionally and physically. At one point, we were living in
  different time zones and our lives felt very separate. I used to send nudes
  all the time. When we moved in together after university, it was exciting to
  no longer have to shag in our family home or with flatmates next door. We
  probably have sex less now than when we lived apart, but it’s amazing that
  when the mood strikes we can just do it: the short and sweet version, or make
  it a marathon over hours. There’s less pressure to have sex as soon as we see
  each other. Now and then, I’ll buy sex toys. It’s never been a premeditated
  jazz-up-our-sex-life thing – I used solo toys for a while before, so it felt
  like a natural progression. Some things work for us and then we integrate them
  more frequently, like a vibrating butt plug. Though we soon discovered that a
  vibrating cock ring was not our thing. Having done all these things for the
  first time together, there’s no weirdness about suggesting stuff. We’ve spoken
  before about whether we think we’ll ever do stuff with other people. It’s a
  weird thing to consider, and honestly, the answer is no. I can’t imagine it.
  Growing up exploring sex with Max means we are totally comfortable trying
  whatever. We know each other so well we understand what we like and how to get
  each other there. Max, 27 Often, we’ll start by inviting each other to join in
  the shower, wash each other, then move into the bedroom Zara is a spontaneous
  shopper and often buys sex toys on a whim. It’s nice she’s thinking about our
  sex life and taking the reins, but I probably haven’t enjoyed the toys as much
  as she has. Maybe it’s because there’s some stigma around them for straight
  men: they’re often considered creepy or sleazy. I’m not sure why, especially
  since porn is widely accepted yet considerably more problematic. When Zara and
  I got together as teenagers, it took us about five months before we had sex. I
  had all these big ideas, but remember thinking it wasn’t as easy as the boys
  would have you believe. We’ve grown with each other. Living together made us
  even more comfortable – and much less quiet. At first, we had sex all the
  time, then it slowed. Now, there’s a nice middle ground. We have three or four
  positions that we rotate, which makes it sound robotic, but we mix it up with
  foreplay. I enjoy intense eye contact, and love it when Zara is noticeably
  more excited than usual. We joke about “wine sex”: if we’re at dinner and get
  a bottle of wine, we’ll give each other a look, because Zara notoriously gets
  quite horny after a few glasses. Often, we’ll start by inviting each other to
  join in the shower, wash each other, then move into the bedroom. Lately, we’ve
  been having quickies during the work day, usually over lunch when we’re both
  WFH, which is fun. We’ve also been experimenting more. Knowing Zara so well,
  it’s sometimes a bit odd when she’s submissive in bed, as she’s quite an
  assertive person. I’ve learned to play into it, knowing she enjoys it and we
  have that freedom. I’d be lying if I said I haven’t wondered what it would be
  like to have sex with someone else, especially in the younger years, but I’ve
  never felt I was missing out on anything. We’re in love and have dated for so
  long. We build each other up and tell each other we fancy each other. We
  always laugh and say there isn’t a single spot on each other’s bodies that
  hasn’t been touched by the other person.
