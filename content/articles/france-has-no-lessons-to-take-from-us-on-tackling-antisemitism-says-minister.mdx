  Cabinet ministers and Jewish groups have said France has “no lessons to take”
  from the US on tackling antisemitism, as Washington’s ambassador to Paris was
  summoned after accusing the government of failing to do enough to stem hate
  crimes against Jews. Charles Kushner, who is Jewish, was ordered to report to
  the foreign ministry on Monday after he wrote a letter to Emmanuel Macron
  criticising a “lack of sufficient action” by the government to confront the
  “dramatic rise” in antisemitism in France. “In France, not a day passes
  without Jews assaulted in the street, synagogues or schools defaced, or
  Jewish-owned businesses vandalised,” Kushner, whose son Jared is Donald
  Trump’s son-in-law, said in the letter, published in the Washington Post on
  Sunday. He urged the French president to enforce hate-crime laws and tone down
  criticism of Israel, saying Macron’s pledge that France would formally
  recognise a Palestinian state at the UN in September had further fuelled
  antisemitic incidents in France. French diplomatic sources told Agence-France
  Presse that since Kushner was not in Paris on Monday, the US embassy’s chargé
  d’affaires attended the ministry in his place. The summoning of an ambassador
  is considered a formal and public notice of displeasure on the part of the
  host government. The French interior ministry said on Monday the number of
  antisemitic acts recorded in France in the first six months of 2025 had fallen
  by 27% compared with the same period last year, but remained significantly
  higher than in 2023. The ministry said police had registered 646 antisemitic
  acts from January to July, of which almost two-thirds targeted people, and the
  remainder buildings. France is home to western Europe’s largest Jewish
  population, at about half a million people. Among recent incidents, French
  prosecutors have placed the manager of a leisure park who refused entry to a
  group of 150 young Israeli tourists under investigation on suspicion of
  discrimination based on ethnic origin or nationality. Police are also
  investigating the felling of an olive tree earlier this month that was planted
  outside Paris in memory of a young Jewish man tortured to death in 2006.
  Macron has vowed that the perpetrators will be punished for antisemitic
  “hatred”. The US on Monday refused to back down on Kushner’s allegations. “We
  stand by his comments,” a state department spokesperson, Tommy Pigott, said.
  “Ambassador Kushner is our US government representative in France and is doing
  a great job.” France’s foreign ministry said Kushner’s comments were
  unacceptable and violated international law, which requires ambassadors not to
  interfere in the internal affairs of the countries they are posted to, as well
  as breaching “trust … between allies”. The ministry said in a statement that
  the rise in antisemitic acts in France since the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7
  October 2023 was “a reality that we deplore” but that the French authorities
  were “responding with total commitment”. The French equality minister, Aurore
  Bergé, on Monday said antisemitic incidents throughout the west had reached
  “absolutely intolerable levels” but said the government’s fight against
  anti-Jewish hate crimes was “unambiguous”. She added that the issue was “too
  important to be used as a diplomatic bargaining chip”. The foreign trade
  minister, Laurent Saint-Martin, denounced what he called “erroneous and
  unacceptable” remarks by the US ambassador. France “need take no lessons
  whatsoever” from the US on antisemitism, Saint-Martin told the broadcaster
  TF1. France had “never stopped fighting” the rise of anti-Jewish acts, he
  said, adding that Kushner had “got the wrong target”. Patrick Klugman, a
  lawyer for several French victims of the 7 October attacks, said antisemitism
  in France had reached historic levels, but also defended the French government
  and said Washington was in no position to lecture Paris. “Over the past six
  years, no antisemitic murder has been committed in France, while sadly several
  have occurred in the US. The contrast is striking,” he posted on social media.
  “No country is in a position to lecture others; all must revise their
  approach.” Alain Jakubowicz, a lawyer and honorary president of the
  International League Against Racism and Antisemitism (Licra), also said France
  had no lessons to learn from the US on the subject, but added that
  antisemitism was “a real problem” in the country. “We have lived through an
  antisemitic summer, that’s clear,” he said. “A new incident every day. Attacks
  on buildings, people and symbols.” • This article was amended on 26 August
  2025. Licra is the International League Against Racism and Antisemitism, not
  the League Against Anti-racism and Antisemitism as an earlier version said.
