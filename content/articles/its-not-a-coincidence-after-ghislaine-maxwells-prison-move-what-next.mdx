  When Ghislaine Maxwell was transferred to a minimum security prison camp last
  week, despite being convicted of sex trafficking for Jeffrey Epstein, her move
  fueled ever-growing speculation about authorities’ handling of the late
  financier’s crimes. For many, the timing of Maxwell’s sudden relocation from a
  Florida penitentiary to a Texas lockup known for its more campus feel and
  celebrity inmates was especially suspect – with two Epstein victims reportedly
  describing the event as a “cover-up”. Maxwell, who was found guilty in 2021 of
  luring girls into Epstein’s abusive world, met with the deputy attorney
  general, Todd Blanche, one week before the move. This sit-down with Blanche –
  who defended Donald Trump in criminal proceedings before working in his
  justice department – came amid extensive criticism of the president’s botched
  release of Epstein investigative files. The Epstein scandal is once again
  roiling American politics with many especially focused on the exact nature of
  Trump’s own social links to Epstein, who killed himself in a New York jail
  cell in 2019. Trump had vowed on the campaign trail to release the Epstein
  files, a siren song to the many Maga devotees convinced that a network of
  elites protected Epstein and potentially participated in his sex trafficking
  of teen girls. But Trump’s justice department then later released a memorandum
  stating that there was no Epstein client list and elected not to release
  extensive case files. Following the backtracking, several reports highlighting
  Trump’s past ties to Epstein stoked still more suspicion. The Wall Street
  Journal published an article alleging that Trump contributed a “bawdy” letter
  to a birthday book for Epstein. Not long after this story was published, Trump
  said that he had instructed the justice department to request unsealing of
  grand jury transcripts in Epstein and Maxwell’s criminal proceedings. The
  newspaper on 23 July reported that his attorney general, Pam Bondi, told him
  that there were multiple instances of his name in the Epstein files,
  potentially negating whatever benefit he hoped would come from his grand jury
  directive. The House oversight committee on Tuesday subpoenaed Trump’s justice
  department for Epstein investigation files, per the Associated Press – further
  amplifying comment surrounding Maxwell’s improved prison conditions. Several
  longtime defense attorneys said that Maxwell’s reassignment to FPC Bryan
  suggested she provided useful information to the justice department officials
  she talked with. It’s also possible that this transfer foreshadows still
  better conditions for Maxwell – including possible release, they speculated.
  “My thinking is: if it walks like a duck, if it quacks like a duck, it’s
  probably a duck,” said Randy Zelin, a longtime defense attorney who has taught
  law at Cornell Law School. “If someone who is in a really not nice prison gets
  moved to a nicer prison, there is typically a reason behind that, and it’s not
  merely because you are the next contestant on The Price Is Right or today’s
  your lucky day. “It would appear to me that when Ms Maxwell was questioned
  under what we call a ‘proffer agreement’ by the government, the answers that
  she gave were found to be credible, they were found to be truthful and they
  were found to be helpful,” Zelin said. “In exchange for her being helpful and
  being truthful and being candid and being cooperative, she had a [benefit]
  conferred upon her, which is: she’s in much nicer digs than she was before she
  provided her help to the government.” While the Bureau of Prisons has
  discretion over inmate placement, Zelin surmises there was probably an
  agreement between the correctional agency and the justice department to move
  Maxwell. “It’s not a coincidence, and it’s either because she’s helping the
  Department of Justice go after other people, or she has more or less
  exonerated the president, and she has told the Department of Justice that she
  knows of absolutely nothing inappropriate, untoward or gross that took place
  between the president and Jeffrey Epstein,” Zelin said. Asked if one should
  look at Maxwell’s move as a one-off, Zelin said no. “This is the beginning,
  not the end.” For Sam Bassett, a criminal defense attorney with Austin,
  Texas-based law firm Minton, Bassett, Flores &amp; Carsey, publicity
  surrounding Maxwell’s meeting is particularly interesting. “One of the things
  that intrigued me about the whole situation with her interview is how public
  it was and how public her lawyer was about it. I know that when my clients
  cooperate, either post conviction or even before they’re convicted, it’s
  something that I like to keep under wraps,” Bassett said. He noted that one
  reason for privacy surrounding meetings and cooperation is because other
  inmates tend to look down upon those who cooperate. “So it really flagged to
  me that this was kind of a political move on a lawyer’s part. It puts some
  pressure on the president or his staff to consider a pardon or commutation at
  some point.” As for Maxwell’s transfer, Bassett said it could stem from
  security reasons – such as threats at her previous prison in Florida – or her
  lawyers requested a move. But it was “unusual” that a person found culpable of
  such a serious crime as sex trafficking would end up in a prison camp. “Maybe
  it’s to be a recognition for cooperation, giving her more freedom, so to
  speak, in a facility,” he said, noting that a move to a lower-security
  facility might be considered a favor to some. “The question is: is this a
  foreshadowing of bigger favors to come? Neama Rahmani, founder of West Coast
  Trial lawyers and a former federal prosecutor, said there were multiple
  possibilities behind the move. “It could be something huge or just a mere
  coincidence,” Rahmani said. “The Bureau of Prisons has complete control over
  inmate placement, and especially when you deal with female inmates, there’s
  not as many facilities, so the options are more limited.” Rahmani said that
  sex trafficking was considered a more serious crime, a crime of violence, “so
  her being moved to a minimum security camp would be atypical, but it’s not
  unheard of”. That said, the chronology continues to raise many questions.
  Maxwell met with Blanche, she is vying for relief from the US supreme court,
  and potentially will testify before Congress. “The timing of it all leads me
  to believe that maybe something big is really happening, and by something big,
  that has to be a cooperation, right? That’s really all she has to offer.” For
  Maxwell, relief could take the form of prosecutors requesting a resentencing,
  prison officials moving her to home confinement, or a pardon. A veteran legal
  public relations expert, who spoke under the condition of anonymity as they
  have clients in federal custody, surmised Maxwell “must have provided
  prosecutors with information that was valuable enough post conviction for her
  to warrant these more favorable sentencing conditions – and they’re
  considerably more favorable”. “The interesting thing to outsiders is it
  appears that she’s a cooperating witness, though, at this point, she’s
  cooperating against a corpse, and a corpse cannot be convicted,” they said.
  The public relations veteran described the Maxwell-Blanche meeting as “part
  one” of a process potentially resulting in better sentencing conditions. “Part
  two is the public finding out, through DoJ disclosure, what information she
  actually provided,” they said. “I do think that there’s going to be some
  mechanism for them to release what she shared – and I think what she shared
  was indeed favorable enough to secure these lessened conditions.” Asked for
  comment about Maxwell’s transfer, a senior administration official said: “Any
  false assertion this individual was given preferential treatment is absurd.
  Prisoners are routinely moved in some instances due to death threats, and
  significant safety and danger concerns.” Trump’s justice department pointed to
  Blanche’s tweet about his meeting with Maxwell, in which he said they “will
  share additional information about what we learned at the appropriate time”.
  Neither the Bureau of Prisons nor Maxwell’s lawyer immediately responded to
  requests for comment.
