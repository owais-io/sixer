  It didn’t take long for Dezi Freeman to allegedly shoot and kill two police
  officers before he vanished into the bush in the Victorian high country,
  seemingly without a trace. That brief moment in time launched a manhunt that
  has involved hundreds of police officers from all over the country, some of
  Australia’s elite special forces, a visit from the premier and, as one local
  described it, a media “circus” in the small town of Porepunkah, in Victoria’s
  north east. It has also profoundly changed the lives of the people who knew
  and loved the officers who Freeman allegedly killed: Det Leading Sen Const
  Neal Thompson, 59, a local detective who had been planning his retirement, and
  Sen Const Vadim De Waart, 35, who was on temporary assignment to the state’s
  alpine region. A third officer, who Freeman allegedly shot and injured, was
  recovering from surgery in hospital on Friday. Meanwhile, dozens of police
  carried out the fourth day of the search for the suspected gunman whom locals
  say could be “anywhere” in the wild and imposing terrain around the base of
  Mount Buffalo. Senior Victoria police officers have described Thompson as a
  well-loved and respected member of the community who was due to retire next
  month. De Waart, they say, was a bright young man looking forward to his
  future who was already known for his professionalism. Staff at Ineeta cafe in
  Moyhu, a town in between Porepunkah and Wangaratta, say they are “absolutely
  devastated” by Thompson’s death. They have paid tribute to the officer, who
  was a regular customer, in a post on social media, saying he always made them
  feel safe and was someone “unique” and “larger than life” who had a “heart of
  gold” and a “softness without words”. Lately, they say, he talked to them
  about “all the things he was going to do in his retirement”. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email Thompson and De Waart were among 10 officers who police
  say went to the Rayner Track property to arrest Freeman – who has been linked
  to the “sovereign citizen” movement – on a warrant relating to charges that
  had been investigated by detectives from Victoria police’s sexual offences and
  child abuse team. Porepunkah locals on Friday were trying to keep things as
  normal as possible, buying coffees, walking their dogs, taking their children
  to school, while convoys of cars carrying police officers pursued potential
  leads about Freeman’s whereabouts, and the journalists in town covering the
  story chased the police. “The circus has come to town,” one local buying
  breakfast mutters. In some parts of this community, there is a kind of support
  for Freeman. Many respect his bush skills; others share his views about the
  government, firearms or the police. Marty Robinson, who owns the mechanic shop
  in Porepunkah, describes Freeman as a “new-age Ned Kelly”. He doesn’t have a
  lot of sympathy for the police. Freeman, formerly known as Desmond Filby, had
  expressed hatred of police during previous brushes with the law. It’s not
  unusual for people who live in the high country around Porepunkah to hold a
  firearm licence, live off the land, or choose to not vaccinate their children,
  locals say. Survival skills are shared among friends. People practise going
  bush for days. A local woman, who identifies as part of the survivalist
  community, says many people in the area share Freeman’s anti-authoritarian
  views and share information with each other about how to live off the land,
  such as how to hunt deer. The woman, who lives near the property Freeman was
  living on, says he and his family had been living in a converted bus on the
  property, which she describes as a “commune”. There are others who have a
  dimmer view of Freeman. One resident, who asked not to be named, says
  Porepunkah is an “idyllic place to live” and “not some conspiracy theorist
  town”. Another local, who also didn’t want to be identified, says of Freeman:
  “I wouldn’t say he was well respected”. “Have your views, but don’t push them.
  My kids aren’t vaccinated, but I don’t go around telling everyone. [He is]
  arrogant, maybe.” But Freeman’s wife is well-liked, the woman says, describing
  her as “the most gentle, gorgeous person”. Asked if she is worried, she shrugs
  it off. “He wouldn’t come for us,” she says. Police say they arrested
  Freeman’s wife and a 15-year-old boy at a property in Porepunkah on Thursday
  night. They were interviewed and released without charges, “pending further
  inquiries”, police say. Some people in town are quick to point out that
  Freeman’s views are radical, or that he did the wrong thing, but everyone
  seems to agree on one thing – he knows this bushland like no one else. ‘Very
  difficult’ conditions Police are preparing for a fifth day of searching for
  Freeman in terrible conditions, with blizzards expected for the Alpine region
  on Saturday and snow forecast for as low as 600 metres above sea level.
  Porepunkah, in the alpine foothills, is about 300 metres above sea level. A
  cold front hit Porepunkah on Friday afternoon, smashing the small town with
  heavy rain while lightning lit the roads. The granite cliffs in the national
  park surrounding Mount Buffalo, already barely visible, were engulfed in
  cloud. A severe weather warning for winds of up to 110km an hour on the ranges
  was issued on Friday afternoon. “That will continue to make conditions very
  difficult for the police incident up around Porepunkah,” the Victorian
  emergency management commissioner, Tim Wiebusch, told reporters. “We have not
  seen a weather system like this for some time.” Local people speculate about
  where Freeman could be – maybe he is down a mine shaft, or perhaps he has
  built an underground bunker. Without a shelter how could he light a fire?
  Everyone is speculating about whether he has managed to survive, and if so,
  how? “He could stay out there for months,” says Glen, who did not give his
  last name but lives near the property Freeman was living on. “He won’t go out
  without a fight.” Glen has known Freeman for 20. He’s taking the police
  warnings seriously and has told his next-door neighbour, a 70-year-old woman,
  to stay inside. He says lots of people in town hated lockdown, and hated the
  government intervention during the Covid-19 pandemic. But when Freeman got
  going on the topic, he was unstoppable, Glen says. “You would have a beer with
  him, but you wouldn’t [want to] get him started on that stuff.” Victoria
  Police say they are throwing everything they have at finding Freeman. They’re
  not just up against an armed suspect, but are battling a harsh terrain perfect
  for someone to hide in. And the weather is only going to get worse. The police
  say they won’t rest until they find Freeman, but they’ve been tight-lipped
  about much of the operation. Everyone in town is speculating, but no one
  really knows how long it will take.
