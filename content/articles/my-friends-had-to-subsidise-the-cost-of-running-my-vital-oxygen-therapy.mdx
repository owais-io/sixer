  I am dependent on long-term oxygen therapy after a double lung transplant. I’m
  entitled to reimbursement of the excess electricity used by the oxygen
  concentrator and have received quarterly payments of about £48 from Vivisol,
  which administers rebates on behalf of the NHS. However, I was forced to stay
  with friends and family for a year after my house was flooded, and I spent a
  further two months convalescing at my daughter’s house after a heart
  operation. I received no rebates during that time, and Vivisol told me l would
  not be reimbursed while I was not living at home, which means my hosts had to
  subsidise my treatment. SS, East Sussex The rebate scheme is intended to
  protect eligible patients who rely on an oxygen concentrator from spiralling
  energy costs. I see that Vivisol’s website states, in passing, that patients
  are eligible for the cost of using the machine at their main address. This
  strikes me as insufficiently clear, as well as potentially unfair. It’s a
  no-brainer that those with such serious health issues might have to relocate,
  as you did, for convalescence, for respite care or building work. It seems
  unreasonable to me to expect friends and family to foot what can be a
  considerable bill for treatment and, since concentrators record electricity
  consumption on an integrated meter unconnected to the household meter, it is
  straightforward to be able to monitor the costs involved. I first approached
  NHS England to ask if this restriction was NHS policy and whether there were
  exemptions for cases such as yours. It referred me to the NHS Sussex
  Integrated Care Board, which explained that patients can nominate a temporary
  address as their main residence via their service provider in circumstances
  such as yours. In the meantime, Vivisol responded to my contact by agreeing to
  reinstate and backdate your rebates to cover the period while you were away. A
  spokesperson said: “All communication does highlight that the eligibility only
  applies at the patient’s main address. As a result of your email, we will
  review to identify if that can be made clearer.” We welcome letters but cannot
  answer individually. Email us at consumer.champions@theguardian.com or write
