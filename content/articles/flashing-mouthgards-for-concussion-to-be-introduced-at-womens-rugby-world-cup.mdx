  Rugby union is to introduce flashing LED mouthguards that light up when a
  player sustains a significant head impact during a match. The mouthguard will
  flash red if the impact is severe enough to potentially cause a concussion.
  The referee will then stop play and the player will go off for a head injury
  assessment. Dr Lindsay Starling, a science and medical manager at World Rugby,
  said the new system would debut at the Women’s Rugby World Cup, which begins
  next week, before being rolled out across the men’s and women’s elite game.
  “Match officials and players will be able to see that this player has
  sustained a big head impact because their mouth guard is flashing red,” she
  said. “And it will create awareness about head injuries and concussions in the
  stands and for fans at home, being able to see it on TV.” Dr Éanna Falvey, the
  chief medical officer at World Rugby, said every player at the Women’s World
  Cup would be wearing the new mouthguards, apart from two who wear braces. He
  said that was significantly higher than for the men’s game, in which around
  85% of players wear smart mouthguards. He said he hoped all players would
  embrace the new technology. “It would be great for the game. But personal
  choice is an important thing, autonomy is an important thing.” The mouthguards
  work by measuring how much a player’s head moves up and down and rotates
  during a collision. When it registers an acceleration above 75g and 4,500
  radians per second squared for men – and 65gs and 4,500 rad/s2 for women – it
  will start flashing. That is an improvement on the existing system, which uses
  Bluetooth to alert the match‑day doctor and can take several seconds to
  arrive. Starling also indicated that the mouthguards could help to identify
  foul play, but that there were caveats. “There is a world in which the data
  from the mouthguard can start to come into play a little bit more with foul
  play,” she said. “But what everybody needs to understand is that in the same
  way a player can get concussed from a pretty small head impact, foul play [can
  have occurred] without registering anything substantial. “What we need to be
  careful not to do is overrely on the data or put too much power in the hands
  of the data. Data is incredibly powerful, but in this case the data might not
  tell 100% of the picture.” Starling said broadcasters had asked World Rugby if
  they could show the G-forces of big tackles during matches, but they had been
  turned down. She indicated that may change over time. “It’s classified as
  medical data about a player, and so therefore we can’t share those numbers
  anywhere. But we’re working with the players to get them on board to want to
  share that information. “There is a very fine line between big and being safe
  and correct and the player being looked after. Because big isn’t always good,
  sometimes it’s bad.”
