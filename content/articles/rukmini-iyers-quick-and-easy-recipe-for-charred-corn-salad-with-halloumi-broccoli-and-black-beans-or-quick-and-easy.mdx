  This is my version of a chopped salad, and I love the textural contrast of the
  crisp broccoli against the soft black beans and squeaky halloumi. The
  lime-and-spring-onion dressing makes everything sing, while the slightly
  bitter note of the charred corn keeps things interesting. A filling rainbow
  salad for warm days. Charred corn, halloumi, Tenderstem and black bean salad
  Prep 15 min Cook 15 min Serves 2-3 2 tbsp olive oil 300g tin sweetcorn,
  drained 225g halloumi, cut into ½cm slices 200g Tenderstem broccoli, cut into
  ½cm pieces 400g tin black beans, drained and rinsed Finely grated zest and
  juice of 1 lime 20ml extra-virgin olive oil 1 tsp flaky sea salt 3 spring
  onions, trimmed and finely sliced Put a tablespoon of oil in a large,
  heavy-based saucepan on a high heat. When it’s almost smoking, add the
  sweetcorn (stand well back!), then fry, stirring occasionally, for five
  minutes, until charred all over (stand back when you stir, too, because it’s
  going to try to pop at you like popcorn). Transfer the charred corn to a large
  bowl, then turn down the heat to medium, add the remaining tablespoon of oil
  and fry the halloumi for three minutes on each side, until well browned. Tip
  into the bowl with the sweetcorn. Meanwhile, put the broccoli and black beans
  in a bowl, cover with just-boiled water and leave to blanch for two minutes.
  Drain well and add to the sweetcorn bowl. In a small bowl, whisk the lime
  juice and zest, extra-virgin olive oil, sea salt and spring onions, then pour
  this dressing over the sweetcorn mix, toss to coat and serve warm.
