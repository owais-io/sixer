  Donald Trump is removing Billy Long as the commissioner of the Internal
  Revenue Service, and the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, will temporarily
  serve as acting commissioner for the president, a White House official and a
  source familiar with the matter said to Reuters on Friday. The New York Times
  first reported the news about Long, a former congressman from Missouri. He was
  expected to be nominated for an Iceland ambassador post, according to NBC
  News. A treasury spokesperson declined to comment. Long was sworn in as the
  51st commissioner of the IRS in June – meaning he served as IRS chief for less
  than two months – with his term meant to run through November 2027. He leaves
  after new substantial tariffs from Trump took effect and after the president
  signed into law a number of tax cuts and tax code changes. Under the Trump
  administration, the IRS also absorbed numerous job cuts implemented by the
  so-called “department of government efficiency”(Doge), which was temporarily
  headed by the billionaire Elon Musk. In a message posted on the social media
  platform X, Long said it was an “honor to serve my friend president Trump”. “I
  am excited to take on my new role as the ambassador to Iceland,” Long added.
  “I am thrilled to answer his call to service and deeply committed to advancing
  his bold agenda. Exciting times ahead!” Long on X also made a joke about
  calling Trump and asking to join Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice)
  like the actor Dean Cain announced he had on Wednesday. “I guess he thought I
  said Iceland?” Long wrote. “Oh well.” Reuters contributed reporting
