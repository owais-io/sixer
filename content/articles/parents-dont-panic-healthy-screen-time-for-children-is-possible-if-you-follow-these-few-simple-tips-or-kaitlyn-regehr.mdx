  This summer the technology secretary, Peter Kyle, announced he was considering
  a two-hour “screen time” cap on children’s use of social media apps – a
  proposal that is not just insufficient, it’s outdated. Though appropriately
  placed at the start of the summer holiday – a time when kids’ screen time can
  increase, along with the onus on parents to ensure the safety of such
  engagement – Kyle’s announcement is linked to somewhat stale screen time
  guidance. We should indeed be thinking about moderating time on screens, but
  the proposed cap addresses only the quantity of consumption, not the quality.
  Fortunately, as someone who lectures on digital literacy (and is a mother), I
  can tell you there are some ways to push back and create healthier habits for
  children this summer – even if the government doesn’t seem to have caught up
  with them yet. Limiting screen time has been the dominant digital guidance
  used by parents, educators – and all of us really – over the past decade. This
  advice emerged after studies indicated that increasing screen time could be a
  risk factor for being overweight/obesity in children and adolescents. This
  was, and is, good guidance to promote physical health. However, it didn’t
  include robust discussion about how the quality or nature of content online
  might be affecting mental health. For example, in following this guidance, you
  could have one child watching CBeebies with their family in a communal space,
  engaging in discussion; and another child wearing headphones and watching
  algorithmically driven YouTube shorts. Under “screen time” guidance, these two
  forms of viewing would be considered equal. But, of course, they are
  qualitatively very different. In this scenario, one child is engaged in
  interactive, collective viewing with a parent that might be a jumping-off
  point for discussion and connection. The other child’s viewing is isolated and
  fragmented; they are consuming short-form content, probably with little focus
  on meaningful storylines or characters, on a platform that is still, by
  comparison, unregulated. YouTube is where much of our kids’ screen time is
  spent, and is now the most popular first TV destination for generation Alpha.
  A staggering 88% of UK children aged three to 17 use the platform. And yet
  YouTube is often not included in discussions of social media bans, and nor was
  it mentioned in Kyle’s statement. There have been attempts to distinguish
  between types of screen time, such as “passive” and “active” engagement. The
  Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health has pushed for policy to focus
  on habits and behaviours. This might take into account “active screen time”,
  which involves cognitively or physically engaging in screen-based activities,
  such as playing games or completing homework on a computer, and “passive
  screen time”, which includes non-interactive viewing with low levels of
  intellectual and social engagement. Similarly, the American Academy of Child
  and Adolescent Psychiatry recommends familiarising yourself with what your
  child is watching and talking to them about it – and in ways that makes screen
  time more social, educational and creative. However, for the most part, these
  suggestions have not been fully embraced by the public or political zeitgeist.
  In encouraging more intentional choices about what and how kids are watching,
  I am not suggesting that heaping personal responsibility on to individuals is
  the answer. We are in the midst of a digital public health crisis. One that
  has prompted the US surgeon general Vivek Murthy’s to suggest that social
  media increases the risk that children will experience symptoms of anxiety and
  depression. Bold policies that address the underlying technical and financial
  structures of these platforms are necessary. This is where Kyle should direct
  his attention. In the meantime, the proposals Kyle should be offering the
  public should not be limply drawn from outdated guidance. Proposals should be
  based on a deeper understanding around differing forms of usage. They should
  consider both physical and mental health concerns, and address systemic issues
  in the design of digital platforms. And crucially, they should take into
  account not just quantity, but also the quality of our children’s digital
  consumption. Until then, however, the onus of responsibility will fall
  primarily on individuals – in this case, on parents – to ensure their children
  are learning, engaged, active and safe. That sounds overwhelming. I know. If
  it helps, here are some of the things I’ll be doing with my kids during the
  summer holidays. For younger children, time off screens is generally better
  than on. However, when we do use screens, I encourage my own children to watch
  live TV on platforms such as CBeebies and CBBC, as this provides a diversity
  of content curated by a children’s programmer. Lots of time and advocacy has
  gone into producing it. Prioritise active and engaged viewing over passive
  viewing. This means content that encourages creativity and discussion. This
  supports active brain engagement, learning and communication skills. It’s
  often better to opt for collective over solitary viewing, which can act as a
  springboard for discussion and build critical thinking and social engagement
  skills. Begin seeding critical thinking about digital content from an early
  age. You can input questionable images into platforms such as Sightengine, and
  they will tell you how likely each image is to be fake. This is a great way to
  start conversations about disinformation online. Speak to older children about
  what they want their digital diet to look like. Together, dedicate half an
  hour a week to training the machine learning by actively searching for
  positive content – content that they are passionate about or that makes them
  feel good. Don’t watch uninteresting, uninspiring content or content that
  makes them (or you) feel bad. Quickly move past it. And teach them not to
  like, share things or comment on things that they don’t like. Even commenting
  on something you don’t like counts as engagement, meaning you may get more of
  it. As a family, do an “uninspiring” clean. If it no longer inspires or
  educates you, unfollow it. This includes exes, TV personalities and brands. Do
  this regularly to clean up your feed and narrow in on what you do want to see.
  To combat targeted advertising, there are some Google alternatives you might
  want to look at as a family. DuckDuckGo or Firefox Focus are search engines
  that do not track you to serve targeted ads. You could also look at Startpage,
  which allows you to use Google without tracking your digital footprint.
  Governments may not be properly regulating this technology, but as parents,
  there are still things we can do. We can be more intentional about our screen
  use – and in doing so, begin to seed the ideas of healthy, critical screen
  engagement from an early age. Dr Kaitlyn Regehr is the programme director of
