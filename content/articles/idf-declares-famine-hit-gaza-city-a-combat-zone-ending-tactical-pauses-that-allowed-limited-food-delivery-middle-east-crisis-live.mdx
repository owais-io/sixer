  A spokesperson for the Israeli military said earlier this week that the
  evacuation of Gaza City is “inevitable”. Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel
  will launch its Gaza City assault while simultaneously pursuing a ceasefire,
  though talks have stalled. The Israeli prime minister has claimed the assault
  is the best way to weaken Hamas and return hostages, but many hostage families
  disagree and Netanyahu has been accused of expanding the conflict to ensure
  his own political survival. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken
  hostage in the Hamas-led 7 October attacks on southern Israel in 2023. Most
  hostages have been released during previous ceasefires. About 50 remain in
  Gaza, and Israeli officials believe about 20 are still alive. With Israel
  already holding 75% of Gaza, the military has warned that the Gaza City
  takeover could endanger hostages still alive and draw troops into protracted
  and deadly guerrilla warfare. Netanyahu has been accused of prolonging
  ceasefire negotiations – and blocking their progress – to ensure his own
  political survival by having the war continue. The Israeli leader is on trial
  in Israel for alleged corruption and is wanted by the international criminal
  court over allegations of war crimes in Gaza. He denies all the charges
  against him. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has declared Gaza City “a
  dangerous combat zone” as the military prepares for an assault on the
  shattered remains of Gaza’s largest city. In a post on X, the IDF wrote: In
  accordance with the situational assessment &amp; directives of the political
  echelon, starting today at 10:00, the local tactical pause in military
  activity will not apply to the area of Gaza City, which constitutes a
  dangerous combat zone. The IDF continues supporting humanitarian efforts while
  conducting operations to protect Israel. Planes and tanks have reportedly been
  pounding parts of Gaza City over the past week and Israeli tanks and armored
  vehicles have been deployed to its outskirts. Around one million Palestinian
  people, many of whom are too frail or old to keep moving, are expected to be
  displaced by Israel’s expanded assault in the area, where a UN-backed food
  body declared earlier this month that a famine was taking place. More than 500
  staff at the UN have urged its human rights chief, Volker Türk, to describe
  Israel’s war on Gaza as a genocide being committed against the Palestinian
  people. In a letter to Türk, staff reportedly claimed that the legal criteria
  for genocide – which, under international law, is defined as committing one or
  more acts with the intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a national,
  ethnic, racial or religious group – has been met. In the letter, seen by the
  Reuters news agency and Al Jazeera, the UN staff said failure to describe
  Israel’s assault as a genocide “undermines” the UN’s credibility. It was
  reportedly signed by the Staff Committee on behalf of more than 500 employees
  at the Geneva-based office of the high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR),
  and sent to Türk earlier this week. “OHCHR has a strong legal and moral
  responsibility to denounce acts of genocide,” said the letter, which called on
  Türk to take a “clear and public position”. “Failing to denounce an unfolding
  genocide undermines the credibility of the UN and the human rights system
  itself,” it added. It cited the international body’s perceived moral failure
  for not doing more to stop the 1994 Rwanda genocide that killed more than 1
  million people. Turk has the full and unconditional support of the UN
  secretary general António Guterres, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said,
  adding: “Labelling of an event as a genocide is up to a competent legal
  authority.” South Africa’s case against Israel at the UN’s international court
  of justice (ICJ) accusing the state of committing genocide is ongoing. Israel
  denies the charges. There has been a worsening in relations between Israel and
  the UK over recent months. The UK government said in July it would recognise a
  Palestinian state unless Israel abides by a ceasefire and commits to a
  two-state solution in the Middle East, enraging the Israeli government. The UK
  has sanctioned far-right Israeli ministers and those who committed settler
  violence, and broken off trade negotiations with Israel over its military
  conduct in Gaza. But Keir Starmer’s government has been accused inside of the
  UK of not doing enough to try to exert pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu to stop
  his assault on Gaza, which has brought famine conditions to the territory and
  killed over 61,000 Palestinian people, many of whom are women and children,
  according to officials. Despite Israel being accused of war crimes and of
  committing genocide in Gaza, the UK has still allowed arms sales to Israel and
  has run surveillance flights over Gaza with the help of a US contractor.
  Israel’s defence ministry has criticised the UK government for excluding its
  officials from a London arms fair next month, calling it an act of
  “discrimination”. A UK government spokesperson said earlier that no Israeli
  government delegation would be invited to attend the Defence &amp; Security
  Equipment International (DSEI) event, which will feature national delegations
  and private companies who showcase military equipment and weapons at London’s
  Excel centre. The spokesperson said the Israeli government’s decision to
  further escalate its assault in Gaza was wrong, in comments seemingly in
  reference to Israel’s plan to launch a massive new assault on Gaza City within
  weeks. “As a result, we can confirm that no Israeli government delegation will
  be invited to attend DSEI UK 2025,” the spokesperson said. “There must be a
  diplomatic solution to end this war now, with an immediate ceasefire, the
  return of the hostages and a surge in humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza,”
  the spokesperson added. Israel’s defence ministry said that as a result of the
  trade fair ban it would not run its national pavilion at the trade show as it
  has done previously. Israeli defence companies, such as Elbit Systems, Rafael,
  IAI and Uvision, will still be able to attend. “These restrictions amount to a
  deliberate and regrettable act of discrimination against Israel’s
  representatives. Accordingly, the Israel Ministry of Defence will withdraw
  from the exhibition and will not establish a national pavilion,” Israel’s
  defence ministry said in a statement. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja
  Kallas, said this morning that Europe wants to find diplomatic solutions to
  the Iranian nuclear programme question. “We are entering a new phase with this
  30 days that is now giving us also the opportunity to really find diplomatic
  ways to find a solution,” Kallas told journalists. “We have this 30 days to
  sort things out,” she added. Iran has been enriching uranium to up to 60%
  fissile purity, a short step from the roughly 90% of bomb-grade, and had
  enough material enriched to that level, if refined further, for six nuclear
  weapons, before airstrikes by Israel (and then the US) were launched on
  Iranian nuclear sites in June, according to the UN nuclear watchdog. The west
  says the advancement of Iran’s nuclear programme goes beyond civilian needs,
  while Tehran says it wants nuclear energy only for peaceful purposes. Patrick
  Wintour is diplomatic editor for the Guardian The UK, France and Germany have
  formally notified the UN that they have triggered the restoration of sweeping
  UN sanctions against Iran, giving Tehran 30 days to make concessions on access
  to its nuclear sites or face deeper worldwide economic isolation. UK officials
  said the decision had not been taken lightly and there had been intensive
  diplomacy to try to avert this step. The officials emphasised there was still
  room for last-ditch diplomacy before the sanctions “snapback” comes into force
  in 30 days’ time. The annual high-level UN general assembly in September is
  likely to involve more intensive diplomacy over the situation with Iran. They
  added that Iran had been in significant non-compliance with the terms of the
  2015 nuclear deal since 2019, saying Tehran had been given ample opportunity
  to become compliant but had either been unwilling or unable to act. The
  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) left Iran after Israel bombed its
  key nuclear sites, and has been unable to renegotiate a return to assess the
  state of those sites. Iran has allowed the IAEA inspectors to visit the
  Bushehr site, where refuelling is due to occur. David Lammy, the UK foreign
  secretary, told the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, of the decision
  by the three European countries in a call on Thursday morning. You can read
  the full story here: Israel rejected the findings of the report, saying they
  were based on “Hamas lies laundered through organisations with vested
  interests”, and denied the existence of a famine in Gaza. We mentioned the
  findings of the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC)
  in our opening post. Here is a bit more detail about the report which said
  last week that more than half a million people across Gaza are facing
  “catastrophic” conditions characterised by “starvation, destitution and
  death”. The IPC said an “entirely man-made” famine is happening in Gaza City,
  the territory’s largest, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, and
  could spread south to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of next month.
  Only four famines have been declared by the IPC since it was established in
  2004, most recently in Sudan last year. The IPC is a globally recognised
  organisation that classifies the severity of food insecurity and malnutrition.
  “This famine is entirely man-made, it can be halted and reversed,” the report
  says. It continues: The time for debate and hesitation has passed, starvation
  is present and is rapidly spreading. There should be no doubt in anyone’s mind
  that an immediate, at-scale response is needed. Any further delay – even by
  days – will result in a totally unacceptable escalation of famine-related
  mortality. If a ceasefire is not implemented to allow humanitarian aid to
  reach everyone in the Gaza Strip, and if essential food supplies and basic
  health, nutrition and (sanitation and water) services are not restored
  immediately, avoidable deaths will increase exponentially. We are restarting
  our live coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza. The director of the UN World Food
  Programme, Cindy McCain, said it is “very evident” there isn’t enough food in
  Gaza, adding that starvation was clearly under way in the territory. Her
  comments were made to the Associated Press during a visit to Gaza earlier this
  week and echo the declaration last Friday of widespread famine in Gaza made by
  the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification. “I personally met mothers
  and children who were starving in Gaza,” McCain said. “It is real and it is
  happening now.” McCain said she spoke with Israeli prime minister Benjamin
  Netanyahu and claimed he is “concerned” about the issue. In the past,
  Netanyahu has denied the existence of famine in Gaza and said the claims about
  starvation are a propaganda campaign launched by Hamas and spread by the
  media. “We agreed that we must immediately redouble our efforts to get more
  humanitarian aid in. Access and security for our convoys is critical,” McCain
  said. Netanyahu has presided over a government that has been starving Gaza by
  limiting the amount of aid coming into the territory. Charities say there are
  ongoing obstructions in being able to collect and distribute aid. In March and
  April Gaza was under total siege, with no food entering. Israel justified what
  was widely seen as the collective punishment of the civilian population as a
  tactic to pressure Hamas into releasing hostages. In mid-May Netanyahu said
  shipments would restart because of international pressure over a “starvation
  crisis”. But the amount of food and basic essentials let into the territory is
  still woefully inadequate and many Palestinian people have been killed while
  trying to collect aid. Stay with us as we give you the latest updates on Gaza
  throughout the day.
