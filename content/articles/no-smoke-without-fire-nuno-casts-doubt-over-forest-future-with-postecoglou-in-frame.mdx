  Nuno Espírito Santo has cast doubt over his future at Nottingham Forest by
  conceding his relationship with the owner, Evangelos Marinakis, has
  deteriorated and acknowledging there is “no smoke without fire” amid reports
  he could be sacked. Nuno secured Forest a place in European competition for
  the first time since 1995-96 and signed a new three-year contract in June, but
  his position appears in jeopardy – with Ange Postecoglou believed to be in the
  frame to replace him – after a series of ominous remarks in an extraordinary
  pre-match press conference on Friday. Nuno, who tends to be guarded and
  reluctant to overshare, divulged the breakdown in communication after being
  asked whether his relationship with Marinakis has suffered. “I always had a
  very good relationship with the owner, last season was very close, almost
  [talking on a] daily basis,” he said. “This season, not so well, but I always
  believe that dialogue and your opinion is always valid, because my concern is
  the squad and the season that we have ahead of us. But our relations have
  changed. “It is not so close [now]. I’m being honest with you, I cannot say
  that is the same, because it’s not the same. The reason behind it, I don’t
  know. My job is always to try to anticipate what’s coming ahead of us, and
  that’s what I said with respect. “It’s not good. I think everybody at the club
  should be together but it’s not the reality. The reality is that [it] is not
  what it used to be. It was a good, respectful relationship, but was more based
  on trust and sharing opinions, and now it’s not so good.” Asked about a report
  in Italy that referenced rising tensions between Nuno and Marinakis and
  suggested the Portuguese could be sacked, the 51-year-old fuelled doubts over
  his position. “Where there’s smoke, there’s fire, so I know how things work,
  but I’m here to do my job. I understand, because I’m worried. I’m the first
  one to be worried. I’m the first one to be concerned. There’s no smoke without
  fire.” It is thought Nuno’s comments have inflamed tensions behind the scenes,
  particularly given their personal nature and the fact they came 48 hours
  before an already supercharged match against Crystal Palace. Forest profited
  from Palace’s demotion to the Conference League and will take the place of
  Oliver Glasner’s side in the Europa League. Postecoglou, the former Tottenham
  manager, is understood to be a leading candidate for the role should Forest
  decide to sack Nuno. Postecoglou, who is out of work after leaving Spurs in
  June, is thought to be interested in the role. Nuno had voiced concerns
  heading into the season that his squad was undercooked to cope with the
  Premier League and the Europa League, which they will play in after Palace’s
  demotion. Marinakis responded by spending almost £100m on four players: Omari
  Hutchinson, James McAtee, Arnaud Kalimuendo and Douglas Luiz. Forest, who beat
  Brentford 3-1 in their opening game last weekend, travel to Palace on Sunday
