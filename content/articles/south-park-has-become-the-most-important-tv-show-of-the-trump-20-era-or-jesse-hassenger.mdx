  I’ll admit it: I’m more of a Simpsons guy than a South Park guy. Nothing
  really against those South Park guys – I’ve caught plenty of episodes over its
  astonishing near-30-year run, and loved the 1999 big-screen movie. But while I
  haven’t always maintained clockwork viewership of The Simpsons, either, those
  characters have proved durable enough to revive my interest in episodes old
  and new. South Park has a thinner bench by comparison, and as the show itself
  astutely pointed out years ago, it’s difficult for a satirically minded
  animated sitcom to explore ground that The Simpsons hasn’t covered already.
  South Park’s political bent, too, has often seemed less varied than the warmer
  (but still sometimes cutting) social ribbing of Matt Groening’s signature
  show. It’s a fine line between omnidirectional satire and libertarian
  crankiness. And yet the 27th season of South Park has accomplished something
  vanishingly few of its peers, whether in animation or topical comedy, have
  been able to do: getting laughs taking shots at the second Trump
  administration. It’s not that the White House is beyond reproach. Quite the
  opposite problem, much-documented: the Donald Trump cabal is so outsized in
  its stupidity and cruelty that it’s hard to distend it into a “funny”
  caricature, even a bleak one. In Trump’s second term, it has only gotten
  bleaker; jokes that were worn out by the end of 2020 are getting retold with a
  nasty vengeance, and the bar for cathartic laughter has been raised
  considerably. For a comedy fan, this winds up translating to an aversion. The
  occasional shots taken by The Simpsons somehow don’t land as squarely as they
  did when aimed at presidents I liked much, much more. I watch Saturday Night
  Live every week, and mostly dread James Austin Johnson’s accurate but
  ultimately defanged impression. (Some weeks, Johnson himself seems bummed out
  to be doing it.) I respect the hell out of Stephen Colbert, but I have never
  sought out his Trump commentary; I don’t need any more clapter – the reaction
  encouraged by comedy that wants your approval more than your laughter – in my
  life. South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone seemed to agree; Parker’s
  2017 announcement that they’d grown bored of taking shots at Trump – then
  barely into his first presidential term – was one of the show’s many
  controversies over the years. So how is it that South Park’s revived
  anti-Trump blows this season have managed to land? A big part of it is
  precisely Stone and Parker’s allergy to clapter and the grandstanding that
  inspires it. They obviously resent anything they read as putting on airs and
  sometimes in the past, this came across as its own form of preachiness, with
  “everybody chill”-style speeches at an episode’s end that would secretly sound
  just as prescriptive as the self-righteousness they wanted to send up. With
  their most recent Trump parody, though, there isn’t much moralizing – just
  gratifyingly mean caricatures of deserving figures such as Trump, JD Vance and
  homeland security secretary Kristi Noem. Some (not all) of their past
  roastings have verged on point-and-laugh bullying; here are targets worthy of
  that derision. Some of this derision speaks through the language of South Park
  itself. Trump isn’t vocally or visually imitated; he’s depicted in a series of
  repurposed photos, with the same voice and animation technique that Parker and
  Stone used to bring Saddam Hussein to life in the South Park movie. He’s also
  given the same sexual partner: a muscled-up and put-upon version of Satan, who
  has found himself in another toxic relationship. Calling Trump a wannabe
  dictator doesn’t break new ground, but there’s something satisfying in Stone
  and Parker using their personal toolkit to draw a line between Trump and
  Hussein; if they thought it was a histrionic comparison, they’d be making fun
  of it instead of making it. Similarly, there’s real spite animating the
  depiction of Noem as a dog-murdering zealot whose glamorous face needs to be
  repeatedly lacquered and reaffixed to her head as she commands an army of
  Immigration and Customs Enforcement thugs. Not all of the season’s satire has
  involved making real-life figures regulars on the show. Because South Park’s
  ensemble has rarely felt as vast or believably developed as Springfield of The
  Simpsons (or even Arlen on King of the Hill), it’s also flexible enough to
  turn Randy, Stan’s desperately trend-following dad, into a
  ketamine-microdosing, tech-bro moron addicted to the soothing, empty
  reassurances of ChatGPT – the focus of the most recent episode, to the point
  where most of the core child cast doesn’t appear. Surprisingly, this season
  has deployed forever favorite Cartman more sparingly so far, again getting
  self-referential in the season’s second episode, where the id-driven and
  arguably evil little kid is incensed to find out that podcasters have stolen
  his “shtick” – his pervasive hatefulness, repackaged as a challenge to debate
  where the aggressor is always the self-appointed winner. Ascribing this
  “master debater” title to Cartman (alongside a fellow kid serving as an
  obvious Charlie Kirk/Ben Shapiro stand-in) somehow manages to make this
  ridiculous behavior funny in its petty smallness without glorifying it. A
  South Park diehard would probably describe this praise as a fair-weather fan
  only enjoying the show when it goes after the “right” targets. Maybe that’s
  true, but it’s also a lot easier to take some joy in savaging Vance as a
  meme-faced version of a Fantasy Island sidekick than, say, accusing George
  Lucas and Steven Spielberg of cultural rape. It’s probably wishful thinking to
  wonder if Parker and Stone might actually move the needle of the perception on
  tech bros, debate-me podcasters and Trump-world ghouls, especially among the
  dude demo. But it’s also just a blessed change of pace to see say-anything,
  first-amendment types finding a fresher target than the wokeness bogeyman.
  While countless standups continue to whine about being silenced, Parker and
  Stone seem highly aware of their rarified position (and, as Paramount
  contractors, also aware of what actual political-corporate interference looks
  like). In a world where Trump’s actual political opponents seem terrified to
  actually fight him, some well-deserved, point-and-laugh meanness has become a
  surprising novelty.
