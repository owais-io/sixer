  This is a story about the queer community in footy. It’s not a story about
  hate – although make no mistake, that’s certainly the stage upon which this
  plays out. It’s been a long, trying week in AFL land, after all. When
  Adelaide’s Izak Rankine used a homophobic slur at an opposition player, the
  league took four days to sanction him. People in the LGBTQIA+ community felt
  every excruciating second of that wait, and were subjected to waves of online
  abuse while they did. And then, the verdict. The AFL reneged on their stated
  precedent, and they reduced Rankine’s suspension. Their first real test on
  tackling homophobia – from a star player with something tangible to lose on
  the brink of finals – and they caved. The result seems to have emboldened some
  of the worst elements of AFL-watching society, and the comment sections are
  still rife with the most eclectic spread of homophobic hate speech you’re
  likely to see. It’s been a rough week. But, despite that, this is still not a
  story about hate. This is a story about love. Because former West Coast player
  Mitch Brown chose this very moment – this landscape, fraught with hostility –
  to speak his truth and to come out publicly as a bisexual man. It is a move
  steeped in love for his community, which bleeds through his every word. He did
  it to ease the way and to be a role model. He did it so that closeted players
  might draw strength and comfort from his experience, and feel even a little
  bit less isolated. There may have been an “easier” time for Brown to do this,
  when people were less hostile, less inclined towards vocalising hate. However,
  he chose now. Now, after a week where the LGBTQIA+ community seemed to get
  little to no consideration from AFL House when passing down their Rankine
  verdict, and where morale in the queer football community was at an all-time
  low. If the slur emboldened the worst in society, then Brown has empowered the
  best. Ahead of AFL finals sign up for our free weekly newsletter There is no
  overstating his bravery, and I know many people would have seen themselves in
  each shaky breath he drew, every considered pause. Brown spoke with clarity
  and eloquence, giving voice to heartbreakingly universal experiences and
  ensuring that the discourse is no longer flooded by hypotheticals. However
  much love and care it took for him to make the decision to come out, I can
  only hope he understands that it is being returned to him tenfold. Because
  that’s the thing about the queer community, we’re no strangers to any of this
  hate-mongering. It doesn’t get easier to weather, and it certainly doesn’t get
  any less painful, but we’ve learned where to find the salve. This community is
  at its best when we can wrap our arms around each other, coax out a laugh, and
  simply sit with the reminder that we’re not alone in this. But in the AFL,
  that community does not yet exist for gay, bisexual, or queer male players.
  That much is clear from what Brown shared of his experience. But this, too,
  can change. Footy speaks the language of community – it understands the ebbs
  and flows, the early mornings and late nights, the rainy days and the raffles
  and the carpooling and the showing up for your mate. Bridging the gap would
  not take that big a leap, if there is a concerted effort from the players. And
  that effort does exist, scarce though it may seem. Ben Brown and Tom Campbell
  marched with the Ruby Demons in this year’s Midsumma Pride march, to visible
  gratitude from members of the crowd. Nick Davis did the same with the Rainbow
  Swans at Sydney’s Mardi Gras. Collingwood’s Brayden Maynard was outspoken
  against homophobia amid last week’s maelstrom. At time of writing, Darcy Moore
  and Alex Pearce have made strong statements in support of Mitch Brown on
  Instagram. Such is the changing character of the AFL playing group that I
  expect they will be far from the last to express this sentiment. The AFL
  doesn’t yet have a soft landing place for closeted men’s players. Their
  LGBTQI+ inclusion action plan was released in 2024 – too late to have had any
  impact on Brown. The frequency of slurs in the league needs to be dealt with
  more decisively, bigger cultural change enacted, and a return to the promised
  zero tolerance would be more than welcomed. But there is movement in the right
  direction. And at a time when we could dwell on the work to be done, Brown has
  reminded us that we can also shine a light on the positives. So, this isn’t a
  story about hate. It’s a story about love, and what that love looks like in
  action. It’s a story about hope for a better, more kind future in Australian
  rules football. And more than anything, it’s a story about a queer community
  that proudly, joyously, includes Mitch Brown, ex-AFL player and bisexual man.
