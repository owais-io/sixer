  years with the Blackpool Illuminations

  When the pop star Olly Murs switches on Blackpool’s famous Illuminations next
  weekend, it will continue a tradition that has endured for almost a century
  and a half. The Lancashire town was first lit up by twinkling bulbs 146 years
  ago – 12 months before Thomas Edison even patented the electric lightbulb. The
  seaside resort has not been without its struggles, but the enduring popularity
  of the lights, which are switched on at the end of August every year, has
  helped to keep its tourism industry afloat. Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen, perhaps
  best known for his work on BBC programme Changing Rooms, and famed for his
  love of maximalist design, is this year marking 20 years of involvement with
  the illuminations, and is the event’s creative curator. “It’s hilarious
  because people were very confused by it,” he said, “they’ve got this strange
  idea that somehow we’re turning on Christmas decorations, because they’ve got
  kind of no idea.” Actually, Llewelyn-Bowen said, the illuminations are “the
  first ever, ever, ever, ever light festival; there was no electric light
  festival before that.” While globally there are now many more, including in
  Sydney, Lille and China, Blackpool is, he said, “the literal grande dame of
  all of that”. This year his new installation is Guardians of the North, three
  seven-metre tall dragons, wrapped around turrets, which come alive with light,
  smoke and roving eyes. “I love the idea that we can make the illuminations
  into this absolutely giant, free, illuminated art experience,” he said. “But
  not art that’s scary, not art that’s kind of turbulent, but just jolly art.”
  One of the special things about Blackpool Illuminations, he said, was its
  enduring intergenerational appeal. While British seaside resorts are
  struggling amid tough competition from cheap overseas holidays, the lights
  remain, he said, “an incredibly strong part of people’s leisure heritage”.
  “The British seaside does have an extraordinary place in everybody’s holiday
  legacy,” he said. “And this is something that we really focus on with the
  Blackpool experience. “Come here and remember what it was like when you were
  your children’s age,” he added. “Come with your parents, come with your
  grandparents, use this as a way of coming together.” However, Llewelyn-Bowen
  said, while the illuminations have formed core memories for generations of
  children in the north-west in particular, the appeal of the lights has not
  spread widely beyond the Midlands; “It is a bit of a north-south divide,” he
  said. “You get to a point where suddenly you just say ‘Blackpool’, and
  everyone starts getting rather misty-eyed,” he said, “and that carries on as
  far north as you can go, because it’s always been incredibly popular with the
  Scots as well. “I always feel rather sorry for the poor mealy mouthed,
  magnolia-shaded Farrow and Ball-obsessed south,” he added. “Because they never
  really will get that, they will be kind of quite Brighton-centric, because
  somehow it’s cool, but actually, there’s nothing cooler than Blackpool, and
  nothing naughtier as well.” Growing up in London, Llewelyn-Bowen said he
  himself was a latecomer to the illuminations. “I have no vestigial nostalgia
  for Blackpool,” he said. “Blackpool was never part of my childhood experience
  at all.” However, he said, “it very quickly became part of my children’s
  childhood … and of course, a big thing now is that my grandchildren are
  obsessed by this whole thing. So I love the fact that it’s a contagion, that I
  kind of started myself.” Thanks to his involvement with the illuminations,
  Llewelyn-Bowen is one of Blackpool’s fiercest advocates, but he was taken by
  the town even on his first visit, on a very wet November afternoon in the
  mid-1980s, when he was working for a flooring company, and sent up to the
  Winter Gardens. “I just didn’t know that somewhere like this existed in the
  United Kingdom, somewhere where everywhere you looked there was so much
  design,” he said. “To me, it was like a jacked version of Portmeirion, but in
  such an incredibly kind of opulent, ornate way. “I mean, Brighton’s got bits
  of embellishment, everywhere you go in Britain’s seaside-scape, you’ll find
  some curly, twirly piers, but Blackpool, literally you cannot spit without
  hitting a furbelow,” he added. “I’ve always just felt that it is in such an
  incredibly stiff-upper-lip, strait-laced architectural nation, Blackpool is
  literally the only place, I think, where design really gets to take its bra
  off in this country, and really just do it for the shits and giggles.”
