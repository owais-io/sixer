  David Moyes believes Everton can provide a platform for Jack Grealish to
  showcase “the best version of himself”, with the midfielder targeting an
  England recall before the World Cup. Grealish completed his move from
  Manchester City on Tuesday on a season’s loan that will cost Everton more than
  £12m in wages and fees. The 29-year-old had been marginalised at City by Pep
  Guardiola and was not included in his 27-man squad for the Club World Cup this
  summer. The attacking midfielder was also omitted from Gareth Southgate’s
  squad for the European Championship last summer but Moyes is confident that
  Grealish, after two seasons of decline at City, can recapture the form that
  prompted his £100m move to the Etihad Stadium in 2021. “I think we’re getting
  him at a good time because he’s experienced, he understands the Premier
  League, and we’re all fully aware of the levels he’s capable of performing
  to,” the Everton manager said. “I know Jack’s ambition is to get back into the
  England squad so hopefully we can help him achieve that over the course of the
  season. We’re all looking forward to working with him and providing a platform
  for him to show the best version of himself.” Grealish had several offers to
  leave Manchester this summer, including from Napoli, but was sold on the
  prospect of relaunching his stalled career in the Premier League with Everton
  during talks with Moyes. The deal moved swiftly over the weekend once Grealish
  gave the green light to Everton’s interest. The England player, who passed a
  medical on Monday, said: “It’s massive for me, honestly. This is a great club,
  with great fans. As soon as I spoke to the manager, I knew there was only one
  place that I wanted to go. “On social media, I’ve been flooded with messages
  from Everton supporters, so there’s that side of it as well and that’s another
  reason why I chose Everton. I want to say thank you to the fans for all of the
  messages I’ve had already. Thank you for all of the love and support. I hope I
  can repay you now and I’m sure I will.” Grealish hopes to feature in Everton’s
  Premier League opener at Leeds on Monday and has chosen to wear the No 18
  shirt. He said: “My two favourite English players ever are Wayne Rooney and
  Paul Gascoigne and I know they both wore No 18 here. “So, as soon as I knew
  this deal was close, I had a look and No 18 was free, so that was perfect for
  me and it was the only number I was going to take from that point. I spoke to
  Wayne before I came here and I mentioned that to him – about the No 18 – so I
  hope he’s happy as well.”
