  YOUR ESSENTIAL TRAVEL GUIDE The joy of a Bigger Cup European tour is what
  makes a season for the fans – the trinket on offer in Budapest is merely a
  bonus. Six Premier League sides will get to test themselves against the best
  over the coming months and there are a few new faces in the competition and
  some intriguing passport stamps to collect. Who wouldn’t want to travel to the
  Cypriot city of Paphos in September to watch their beloved club play David
  Luiz’s Pafos FC? The temperature reaches 29C and there is no chance of rain.
  There are miles and miles of beaches to enjoy with a Keo in hand. If anything,
  the prospect of a 90-minute match is a bit of a distraction. The even better
  news is there are flights from London, Manchester and Newcastle. Obviously,
  travelling to Paphos is the ideal scenario for any supporter but equal weight
  should be given to some of the other Bigger Cup new boys. Bodø/Glimt’s Aspmyra
  Stadion is also very close to a body of water but swimming in the Norwegian
  Sea is not advised in winter when the temperature drops to a rather chilly 3C.
  A trip in December would make it unlikely that the thermometer would get above
  freezing. Trying to find a direct flight is a nightmare, so changing in Oslo
  is about as good as it gets but when the team plane does eventually land it is
  less than a quarter of an hour walk from the airport, making it very
  convenient. On the upside, even with a stop in Norway’s capital, it can be
  reached in five hours from Manchester. Almaty, on the other hand, is almost in
  China and that is a ruddy trek. It will therefore come as no surprise that is
  is a right faff getting there. The most straightforward route would involve a
  stopover in Istanbul and flying to Kazakhstan from there, which would set you
  back around 12 hours but is certainly worthwhile. As Celtic fans will tell
  you, it is a long way to go for disappointment, although Football Daily is
  sure the blow was softened by seeing the Tian Shan mountains and a trip to the
  The Museum of Folk Musical Instruments. No one can really complain about a
  Daizen Maeda missed penalty when there is the prospect of seeing a zhelbuaz –
  a Kazakhstani bagpipe. Football is not the be-all and end-all in life,
  enriching oneself with culture is more important and Bigger Cup gives people
  the chance to visit places they would never have considered on your average
  package holiday. Qarabag are 3-1 up from their opening leg against
  Ferencvaros, meaning Azerbaijan will be another destination on this voyage.
  Surely the idea of going somewhere new rather than your Barcelonas, your
  Madrids and your ,erm, Parises is a far more enticing prospect for the average
  fan. The Camp Nou has been done to death, it’s not even cool to go there, even
  with its revamp. Celtic and – almost certainly – Rangers fans should not be
  upset about missing out on Bigger Cup for the matches, but for the places they
  will never see. Bigger Vase has gone mainstream, with teams from Salzburg,
  Zagreb and Rotterdam, which EyeWitness and Lonely Planet have covered to the
  extreme. Bigger Cup is finally for the real hipsters, wanting to catch a
  glimpse of football destinations as they should be, and it should be embraced.
  LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Simon Burnton at 8pm for goal updates on the Bigger
  Cup and Worthington’s Cup action. QUOTE OF THE DAY I’m someone who is
  passionate and will fight ever[y] time I step on the pitch. But I need to set
  a better example and you fans know how much I love you and this club” – West
  Ham’s Jarrod Bowen takes to InstaChat to expain why he appeared to lose his
  cool with a West Ham fan after they were knocked out of the Milk Cup by
  Wolves. FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS A doff of the cap to the Leeds fans, who went
  from chanting Sheffield Wednesday’s hopefully soon to be ex-owner, Dejphon
  Chansiri’s name to booing their own side and leaving during the penalty
  shootout as they lost to what is essentially our under-21 team. And an extra
  doff of the cap to Dominic Calvert-Lewin, making his debut for Leeds, who
  fluffed three easy chances to win it for them in the last 10 minutes and then,
  in the penalty shootout, did his own heartwarming tribute to Wednesday legend
  Chris Waddle (circa Italia 1990). Hurrah!” – Noble Francis. Thank you Celtic
  for giving us the daunting prospect of impossible away-day draws, cheesy
  headlines and, worst of all, hearing about that teenager Chelsea have already
  signed until 2068 every single week. Yes Kairat Almighty, the unbeaten at home
  Beast from the Far East. The broadcasters and tabloids are going to milk this
  to the last drop aren’t they? As a Spurs fan, I am already dreading the second
  half of our inevitable fixture against them. I hope you enjoy Bigger Vase,
  Celtic” –Yannick Woudstra. I can assure Alex Cameron (yesterday’s Football
  Daily) he was not alone in his interpretation of your wine-related strapline.
  Maybe readers could suggest suitable managerial or player candidates to
  receive a bottle of Chateau d’Arse, an amusing little Fitou from the
  Languedoc-Rousillon region” – Max Maxwell. Federico Macheda (yesterday’s
  Football Daily) – now there’s a blast from the past! The last time I heard
  that name, I looked like Jack Grealish before he signed for City. Fortunately,
  as someone who’s only 40 in January, I’m still some ways away from looking
  like Everton Grealish” – Rowan Sweeney. If you have any, please send letters
  to the.boss@theguardian.com. Today’s winner of our prizeless letter o’ the day
  is … Noble Francis. Terms and conditions for our competitions, when we run
  them, can be viewed here.   RECOMMENDED BOOKING On Thursday 11 September, join
  Max Rushden, Barry Glendenning and Football Weekly favourites Jonathan Wilson,
  Nicky Bandini and Jonathan Liew for an evening of unfiltered football punditry
  at Troxy in London. The pod will also be livestreamed globally. Book now. 
  SHAKE IT OFF A new Bundesliga rule that calls for a meeting with the
  refereeing team and both captains and coaches before every league match has,
  weirdly, been a cause of intense irritation for generally mild-mannered and
  reasonable World Cup winner Toni Kroos. The rule, which is called the
  handshake dialogue (OK, that is an annoying name), came into last week,
  obliging captains and coaches to meet the referees as a group 70 minutes
  before kick-off. “This has absolutely no effect,” roared Kroos. “You [are] in
  the midst of preparing. Now we will say how much we like each other and by the
  fifth minute there is no handshake anymore, just a yellow card. Köln coach
  Lukas Kwasniok went further. “This is all nonsense,” he parped. “Seventy
  minutes before the game no one is in the mood for something like that. Apart
  from interrupting preparations not much else is happening there.” The DFL said
  in July when it introduced the rule that the meeting was intended to improve
  standards of fair play.  NEWS, BITS AND BOBS In the latest instalment of the
  deeply dignified Alexander Isak saga – we know, we’re spoiling you – the
  striker has rejected an attempt by Newcastle minority owner Jamie Reuben and
  representatives of the club’s Saudi state overlords to keep him on Tyneside by
  tempting him with a lucrative pay rise. But Isak was having none of it. Serial
  club investor John Textor is in talks with Sheffield Wednesday’s recalcitrant
  owner, Dejphon Chansiri, about a possible takeover of the stricken
  Championship club. The American plans to meet next week with Chansiri, who has
  still been holding out for £100m for the club. Some good news for Wednesday on
  the pitch at least, as Henrik Pederson’s side turfed out Leeds from the
  Rumbelows Cup on penalties in a widely boycotted tie at Hillsborough.
  Elizabeth Terland hit a hat-trick for Manchester United as they hammered PSV
  4-0 in Women’s Big Cup qualification in Stockholm. Celin Bizet got the other
  goal as United secured a tie against either Sweden’s Hammarby or Metalist 1925
  Kharkiv of Ukraine in the next round of the qualifying process. Spurs are set
  to loan out new signing Luka Vuskovic to Hamburg on a season-long deal.
  They’re also looking to ship out Yves Bissouma to Galatasaray. As mentioned
  above, Celtic are reeling from an Almaty shock (honk!) after crashing out of
  Bigger Cup qualifying to Kazakhstan’s Kairat Almaty on penalties after a
  second turgid 0-0 draw between the sides. “It’s very frustrating,” sighed
  Brendan Rodgers, “Sack the board,” yelled Celtic’s travelling fans. And the
  European Commissioner for Sport says it would be “a betrayal” to play domestic
  league matches overseas in the light of proposals to stage a Serie A and La
  Liga game outside of Italy and Spain. “I’m deeply disappointed by proposals to
  stage domestic league matches outside Europe,” sniffed Glenn Micallef, the
  Commissioner for Intergenerational Fairness, Youth, Culture and Sport. “Today
  I spoke with Ronan Evain of FansEurope to express my solidarity and make clear
  that I will stand with football fans, especially in Spain and Italy.” STILL
  WANT MORE? Suzanne Wrack on Martin Ho, the new Spurs manager looking to bring
  confidence and style back to the WSL side’s football. Our latest WSL
  pre-season preview spotlights a Brighton side buoyed by the return of Michelle
  Agyemang. What scoreline has occurred the most in a single gameweek? What are
  the longest title droughts suffered by a capital city? The Knowledge knows.
  Tactical chameleons would be a good name for a band. It’s also what Eddie Howe
  has become in order to hold Newcastle together, says Louise Taylor. Marc Guéhi
  to Spain? Andreas Pereira to Palmeiras? While the window’s still open, the
  Rumour Mill‘s still churnin’. Only six sweet days to go. And it’s quiz time!
  Test your knowledge of the game’s most remarkable phone calls. MEMORY LANE
  Wolves players hold their captain, Emlyn Hughes, as they enjoy some fun and
  games before the League Cup final in March 1980. You can see Andy Gray there
  in the picture. He scored the winning goal against Nottingham Forest at
  Wembley to bring the trophy back to Molineux. ‘WITH MY MIND SHE RUNS’
