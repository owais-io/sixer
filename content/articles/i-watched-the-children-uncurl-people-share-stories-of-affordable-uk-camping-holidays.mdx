  Parenting in London can often be defined by “don’ts”, says Jen Ablitt, 48, who
  has a four-year-old daughter – “don’t touch that, stop there, don’t run”. But
  whenever they go camping in the countryside, she finds, for a city kid it’s a
  completely different realm. “Off they go, and you give them more freedom,” she
  says. Ablitt is one of many people taking a camping or caravanning holiday
  this summer, options that tend to be significantly cheaper than some other
  breaks while providing benefits such as proximity to nature. Camping and
  caravan holidays work out cheaper than other domestic accommodation types.
  With 62% of UK adults saying they’re currently spending cautiously or cutting
  back due to the cost of living crisis, according to the British Tourist
  Authority, cheaper holiday options are increasingly attractive. Dozens of
  people responded to a Guardian callout asking for their experiences of UK
  camping holidays. Here are some of their affordable tales of pitching up and
  switching off. ‘I don’t think I’ve ever met a little kid that doesn’t love
  camping’ I was recently made redundant, and hopefully I’ll get a new full-time
  job, so this might be the last summer holiday where I can spend the entire six
  weeks with my daughter, who’s four. I rented our home out online and planned
  nearly three weeks staying with friends and camping: the Forest of Dean, the
  Peak District, the Lake District and north Wales. We camp a lot anyway – and
  started when she was 18 months old – so we’re used to it. I don’t think I’ve
  ever met a little kid who doesn’t love camping. We’ve had a very cheap holiday
  – about £20 a night – more than paid for by the home rental money. But as a
  solo parent it has been exhausting to do all the driving, packing, camping,
  parenting, interspersed with house guest changeovers. Overall, I’m very glad I
  did it. Camping is a terrific way to see some truly gorgeous parts of the UK.
  Jen Ablitt, 48, south-west London ‘I watched the children uncurl’ I went
  camping for the first time in the Lee Valley this August – three mums and six
  kids – to try to give our city kids a taste of outdoor living, off their
  phones and out into nature. They’re teenagers, and most of them are glued to
  screens. We had looked at a few seaside holiday lets, but the prices – one
  place was £1,000 a week – were just too high. Cost was definitely a factor. It
  feels like UK seaside holidays are getting out of reach, whereas the campsite
  cost £140, including equipment hire, for two nights per family. It was camping
  for softies – none of us have camping equipment or tents, so we got to
  experience it without the stress of bringing endless bits. Only one of us has
  a car, so she drove with the luggage, and the rest of us got the train, which
  was only 20 minutes. We then walked 45 minutes along the River Lea to the
  campsite. It was brilliant that it wasn’t far. There were the initial
  complaints from the kids: “How long is this walk going to take? There’s no
  toilet in the tent. It’s cold at night. The shop doesn’t sell any good
  snacks.” It took about 24 hours, but I watched the children uncurl, and by the
  end of our stay they were all out playing frisbee, making fires, going on
  river walks, watching the ducks and climbing trees to get apples. Rebecca
  Lovell, small business owner, east London ‘On clear nights you could see the
  Milky Way’ This summer, I’ve reacquainted myself with low-tech camping and had
  two glorious weeks in Dumfries and Galloway. My family prefer more comfort and
  also have less spare time, so I went solo. I stayed at a family-owned farm
  campsite, which is in the Galloway Dark Sky area and close to lots of
  interesting attractions. This is my happy place. Each day was an early rise,
  including watching an uninterrupted sunrise on Midsummer Day from my tent.
  Most days I cycled around the quiet roads and trails. On clear nights you
  could see the Milky Way and millions of stars. For £17 a night, I got my
  pitch, free hot water and showers, a freezer for ice packs, and mains
  electricity to charge my phone and electric bike. It was amazing value and I
  had a great reception from the owners. The carbon footprint of these holidays
  was tiny: two cans of butane gas a week and 50 litres of petrol. The weather
  was kind, but then being retired I could pick my weeks to take advantage of
  the sunshine. As a solo holiday, there were many other folks around to chat
  with and share tips. I think these are the best holidays I can remember. Nick
  Norton, 70, retired business analyst, Glasgow ‘Camping offers the opportunity
  to be close to nature’ We took our two children to Coniston Water in the Lake
  District camping, We’re keen paddleboarders and kayakers. It did not
  disappoint and was only a two-hour journey from our home. We all enjoyed the
  water, with spectacular views. We played ball games on the camping pitch, made
  a lovely campfire under the stars and toasted marshmallows. Our children also
  enjoyed the brilliant tree swing each day. It was absolutely perfect, and all
  for £34 a night. As a family, we have enjoyed holidays to France, Finland,
  Scotland, Tunisia, Spain and Cornwall. Each holiday is unique so it’s hard to
  say how our camping trip compares, but we had just as much fun in the Lakes
  and felt really connected as a family. Camping offers the chance to be close
  to nature, and it is a great learning experience for children. We love that
  these kinds of holidays build character and resilience. Other holidays, you
  can end up fretting about a missed departure, getting lost or wondering
  whether you can afford to eat out. But when we got home from camping, we felt
  refreshed and relaxed. Rachel Hardy, teacher, northern England
