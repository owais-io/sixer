  After the confusion over Morgan Gibbs-White’s release clause and bitter blow
  of being blindsided by Arsenal when it came to Eberechi Eze, Tottenham can
  finally celebrate an unlikely swoop of their own. They have moved quickly to
  land Xavi Simons, who has been touted as a certainty to join Chelsea for much
  of the past month, and must be relieved not to have fallen victim to yet
  another late hijack. There were understandable nerves at Spurs as they raced
  to complete a £51.8m deal to sign Simons from RB Leipzig. Previous attempts to
  bolster Thomas Frank’s options in attacking midfield had not gone well. Where
  next after Eze and Gibbs-White? Spurs have made a hugely encouraging start
  under Frank, who has won his first two league games by an aggregate score of
  5-0, but they needed something extra in the final third. Son Heung-min has
  gone; James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski are out. Mohammed Kudus has
  impressed since joining from West Ham for £54.5m but he is at his best on the
  right. The arrival of extra creativity is highly welcome. The element of
  surprise around Simons has given Spurs fans rare joy. Frank was still treading
  carefully at his press conference before Saturday afternoon’s home game
  against Bournemouth. He would not talk about Simons, even though the
  Netherlands international was clearly at the training ground. Frank smiled.
  Asked about a potential signing, he confirmed there was a new international in
  the building: Djed Spence, who has just received his first England call-up.
  Smartly dodged. Frank was less evasive on other issues, saying that Spurs are
  unlikely to be in the market for another centre-back. He talked about the
  importance of having options in every position. Spurs, who must deal with the
  demands of the Champions League, had huge injury problems last season. Simons
  will give them vital depth. Chelsea looked long and hard at him. There was
  constant talk about the 22-year-old waiting for the west London club to make
  their move. The suggestion was that Chelsea were waiting to sell Christopher
  Nkunku. Yet Chelsea believed that strengthening at left-wing was a bigger
  priority. They have focused on securing a £40m agreement for the Manchester
  United winger Alejandro Garnacho. The situation with Simons was more relaxed.
  There was never a bid from Chelsea, who have caused surprise by opening talks
  to loan Brighton’s Facundo Buonanotte. Spurs saw an opportunity. They advanced
  on Wednesday, contacting Leipzig. A bid was submitted on Thursday and Simons
  was brought to London. Was it really happening? The memory of Chelsea stealing
  in front of Spurs to sign Willian from Shakhtar Donetsk in 2013 lingered.
  Willian had already done his Spurs medical. This time, though, Chelsea had no
  intention of spoiling the party. They will watch on with interest. The obvious
  question is whether Simons can adapt to English football. Leipzig do not seem
  especially bothered about losing him. There have been reports in the German
  media criticising Simons’ attitude, although that can be interpreted as the
  standard briefs against a player making no secret of his desire to leave.
  Frank was asked about his “No Dickheads” policy. “I actually don’t think there
  are any people who are a dickhead,” he said. “You’re probably a psychopath if
  you are. Most people have not been guided well enough. A lot of them need to
  get guided. It’s human nature. We want to be part of a clan. Part of
  something. You feel you are accepted, you want to do more.” The challenge with
  Simons is to mould him into a consistent performer. He has never quite found a
  home. He came through Barcelona’s academy but left for Paris Saint-Germain in
  2019. Next came PSV, although not for long. The bouncing around continued, PSG
  re-signing Simons in 2023 and immediately loaning him to Leipzig, who
  eventually bought him permanently this year. In that context perhaps it is not
  a surprise there are suggestions that teams have struggled to work out how
  best to use Simons. It is said he is at his best in a 4-3-3. He had a variety
  of roles for Leipzig: sometimes a No 8, sometimes on the left, sometimes a cog
  in a box midfield. Frank can give him clarity. The Spurs manager is flexible
  and adaptable. He used a solid 5-3-2 when Spurs faced PSG in the Super Cup and
  an open 4-3-3 when they beat Burnley at home on the opening day. In last
  weekend’s triumph at Manchester City Frank used a high press and a physical
  midfield of Rodrigo Bentancur, Pape Matar Sarr and João Palhinha. “I think
  when you see players perform their best, most likely they play in one
  position,” Frank said. “But that is not to say they can’t play across a front
  four or front three. Modern football is much more flexible now.” Frank sees
  different ways to mould his midfield. It is interesting that Spurs have gone
  for an array of profiles in the final third. Gibbs-White, Eze and Simons have
  different strengths. Simons has to find his place. He has had a restless
  career, stability eluding him. Choosing the Spurs project gives him a chance
  to rediscover the level that meant he was feted as one of the best playmakers
  in Europe when he was striving for his breakthrough at Barça. It gives him a
  chance to be part of something.
