  Councils across England are weighing up their own legal challenges after a
  high court ruling blocked people seeking asylum from being housed in an Essex
  hotel. The Conservative-run Broxbourne council in Hertfordshire said it was
  taking legal advice “as a matter of urgency” on whether it could follow the
  example of neighbouring Epping Forest district council, which applied
  successfully for an injunction to stop asylum seekers being accommodated at
  the Bell hotel in the town. Corina Gander, the leader of Broxbourne council,
  said a hotel in the town of Cheshunt put “an enormous strain on local
  services”. “We are going to be looking at the ruling of Epping yesterday and
  we will be expecting to go down the same path as Epping,” the Conservative
  councillor told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. Gander said her council had
  tried previously to get legal advice to block the hotel, but had been
  unsuccessful. “What Epping have done is they have really set a precedent for
  local councils,” she added. The ruling has been seized on by the Reform UK
  leader, Nigel Farage, who said the party’s 12 councils would also consider
  such challenges. Writing in the Telegraph, Farage said those authorities would
  do “everything in their power” to replicate Epping’s approach, describing the
  case as a template for resistance to the Home Office’s use of hotels. However,
  a number of these councils do not have responsibility for planning permission,
  which may limit their ability to launch legal challenges. After Farage’s
  comments, West Northamptonshire and Staffordshire county councils, both led by
  Reform, said authorities would look at the options available in light of the
  high court ruling. Ian Cooper, the leader of Staffordshire county council,
  said: “The control and protection of our country’s borders is a national
  issue, but the impact of central government policy is felt in communities
  across Staffordshire.” Ministers are braced for such legal challenges, as the
  government is working on contingency plans to house asylum seekers. The
  security minister, Dan Jarvis, told Times Radio: “We’re looking at a range of
  different contingency options following from a legal ruling that took place
  yesterday, and we’ll look closely at what we’re able to do.” Asked whether
  other migrant hotels had the proper planning permission, Jarvis said: “Well,
  we’ll see over the next few days and weeks. Other local authorities will be
  considering whether they wish to act in the same way that Epping (Forest)
  district council have. “I think the important point to make is that nobody
  really thinks that hotels are a sustainable location to accommodate asylum
  seekers. That’s precisely why the government has made a commitment that, by
  the end of this parliament, we would have phased out the use of them.” Farage
  also called for protests outside hotels housing asylum seekers, to put
  pressure on local authorities to take the same route as Epping Forest. He
  said: “Now the good people of Epping must inspire similar protests around
  Britain. Wherever people are concerned about the threat posed by young
  undocumented males living in local hotels and who are free to walk their
  streets, they should follow the example of the town in Essex. “Let’s hold
  peaceful protests outside the migrant hotels, and put pressure on local
  councils to go to court to try and get the illegal immigrants out; we now know
  that together we can win.” Jarvis said he believed “the very worst
  politicians” tried to drive people apart, when asked on Sky News about
  Farage’s opinion piece in the Telegraph on Wednesday about hotels housing
  asylum seekers. He told the broadcaster: “I haven’t read Mr Farage’s op-ed,
  but I’ve always thought that the best politicians try and bring people
  together, and the very worst politicians try and drive them apart.” The
  decision followed weeks of far-right protests in Epping, including clashes
  outside the Bell hotel, where an asylum seeker has been charged with sexually
  assaulting a 14-year-old girl. The judge gave the Home Office until 12
  September to stop housing asylum seekers at the site. The Home Office had
  argued that granting an injunction risked setting a precedent and warned it
  could hinder its legal duty to provide accommodation. Chris Philp, the shadow
  home secretary, used the case to call for tougher measures to halt Channel
  crossings. Writing in the Daily Express, he said “every illegal arrival must
  be removed, every loophole must be closed” to prevent other towns being put in
  a similar position. Not all Conservative councils are rushing to the courts,
  however. The leader of South Norfolk council, Daniel Elmer, said his authority
  would instead use planning rules to ensure hotels in this area housed families
  rather than single men. “If we can punish people who put up sheds in their
  gardens without permission, then we can take action against hotels being
  converted into hostels,” he said. According to recent Home Office figures,
  there were 32,345 asylum seekers being housed temporarily in UK hotels at the
  end of March. This was down 15% from the end of December, when the total was
  38,079, and 6% lower than the 34,530 at the same point a year earlier. The
  Guardian reported on Tuesday that insiders at the Home Office had admitted the
  department had been left “reeling” by the ruling. The department is obliged to
  house asylum seekers until their cases are assessed.
