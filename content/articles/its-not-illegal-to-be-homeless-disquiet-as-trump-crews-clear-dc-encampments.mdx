  For the past eight months, David Harold Pugh has found his “spot” outside the
  Martin Luther King Jr Memorial Library in Washington DC. He keeps all his
  belongings, including a guitar, tied up together on a two-wheeled buggy. “This
  is shelter. It’s a safe place where I can put my buggy up against the wall,
  and it’s up against that beam so nobody can roll it,” said Pugh. “I roll it on
  its back, and then I sleep alongside of it, so nobody can get it without me
  waking up.” He’s one of the more than 5,000 people in the city without a
  permanent place to live and now facing uncertainty about where to find shelter
  after Donald Trump said homeless people in DC must be moved far from the city.
  Crews tore down a major encampment near the Kennedy Center on Thursday, with
  federal law enforcement removing residents and clearing out the remaining
  encampments across the city overnight. The removal is part of Trump’s federal
  takeover of the city’s police department and deployment of the national guard
  across the city. Pugh believes the Trump administration is out of line for
  blaming crime on unhoused individuals. “It’s not illegal to be homeless,” he
  said. Despite the widespread encampment closures, Pugh told the Guardian he
  didn’t have any plans to visit a shelter this week and wanted to stay close to
  his spot. “If they tell me to roll, I’ll roll and I’ll come back when they
  leave,” he said. In an encampment across the city, near the interchange of
  Rock Creek Parkway and Whitehurst Freeway, one homeless individual, who
  identified himself as G, had already packed up his belongings. He said he had
  had to bounce around to various locations over the last few weeks. “It’s just
  going with the punches,” said G. “So you just never get settled. It feels like
  you [are] on the edge.” G is also just days away from moving off the streets
  and into permanent housing. He said the only thing he’s missing is a new
  social security card, which he will have very soon, but until then, he’s not
  sure where he will go. “What am I supposed to do for six days? Am I supposed
  to tell the national guard, or whoever, I got six days? Gonna get six days,
  and I literally have the appointment at the social security [office] on the
  20th,” said G. With encampments now closed around DC and just a few days
  before he can secure stable housing, G said he may consider staying at a
  shelter. “I know the shelters might be full. I don’t even know where a shelter
  is, they haven’t gave us any list. No, nothing. They just made us fully aware
  of possibilities,” he said. According to the DC office of the deputy mayor for
  health and human services, unhoused residents who want shelter will not be
  turned away, and the city is prepared to expand capacity as necessary. But if
  homeless individuals refuse to leave encampments, the Trump administration
  said their options are limited. During a news briefing earlier this week, the
  White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said homeless individuals could
  face fines or even jail time if they refused to go to a shelter or receive
  addiction or mental health services. “We’re in the business of making sure
  people have the information, they have the connection to resources if they
  choose, but then people are, you know, left up to make their own decisions,”
  said Kierstin Quinsland, chief program officer at Miriam’s Kitchen, a homeless
  service provider in DC. “However, it is extremely concerning that people are
  being threatened with arrest if they are refusing services.” Jesse Rabinowitz
  of the National Homelessness Law Center said many unhoused people sleep
  outside in DC and across the nation because rent is too expensive. “Arresting
  or ticketing people for sleeping outside makes homelessness worse, wastes
  taxpayer money and simply does not work. The solution to homelessness is
  housing and supports, not handcuffs and jails,” said Rabinowitz in a written
  statement. Quinsland said advocates and community partners have mobilized to
  keep an eye on encampment closures to make sure unhoused individuals are
  offered support and “treated as respectfully as possible”. She said one of
  their biggest concerns about these federal police sweeps is losing contact
  with homeless residents. In many cases, Quinsland said advocates work with
  members of the city’s unhoused population for weeks, months or longer if they
  are trying to move them toward permanent housing. “Trust is an issue in
  homeless outreach, you know. A lot of folks [who] are outside, they decline
  shelter for a reason, because they don’t trust services,” said Quinsland. “So
  these relationships that we have with folks are precious, and they are hard
  fought.” Advocates also warn that these citywide encampment closures may
  separate homeless individuals from critical support and social services. “If
  they’re moved somewhere where they don’t know where they can get a meal, they
  don’t even know how to get back to the neighborhoods that they’re familiar
  with,” said Quinsland. Ahead of the encampment closures, Quinsland said
  outreach street teams with Miriam’s Kitchen have been passing inexpensive
  mobile phones to unhoused residents to help them stay connected. “Making sure
  that they have our phone numbers, have our business cards with them, to make
  sure that wherever they may end up, we can remain in contact,” she said. With
  Trump’s temporary takeover of the DC police department in place for the next
  few weeks, Quinsland said there had also been discussion about bussing
  homeless residents to neighboring areas like Montgomery county, Maryland, or
  parts of Virginia to be “out of sight of Donald Trump”. But that’s just a
  temporary fix, she said, as homeless service providers need more funding to
  address the issue. “The long-term answer is, if we have the political will to
  put money in the city budget for housing, then we can do that,” said
  Quinsland. “This year, there is zero dollars in the budget for permanent
  supportive housing vouchers, so that’s not a help.”
