  An American game hunter was killed by a buffalo he was stalking during a
  hunting expedition in South Africa over the weekend, according to multiple
  reports. Asher Watkins, 52, of Texas, died on 3 August while tracking a
  1.3-ton Cape buffalo in South Africa’s Limpopo province, according to a
  statement from Coenraad Vermaak Safaris (CV Safaris), the company that
  organized the hunting trip. “It is with deep sadness and heavy hearts we
  confirm the tragic death of our client and friend Asher Watkins from the USA,”
  CV Safaris said in the statement, obtained by the Metro new outlet and other
  publications. “On Sunday 3rd August, while on a hunting safari with us in
  South Africa’s Limpopo Province, Asher was fatally injured in a sudden and
  unprovoked attack by an unwounded buffalo he was tracking together with one of
  our professional hunters and one of our trackers,” the statement adds.
  According to Metro, the buffalo suddenly charged at Watkins at 35 mph (56
  km/h). “This is a devastating incident, and our hearts go out to his family
  and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time,” the company said,
  adding that it is “doing everything we can to support the family members who
  are here with us and those back in the United States as they navigate this
  tragic loss”. Metro reported that Watkins’ brother Amon, mother Gwen and
  stepfather Tony were waiting for him at the safari lodge when the incident
  occurred, and CV Safaris also said it was in touch with Watkins’s teenage
  daughter and his ex-wife, Courtney. A warning on the CV Safari website notes
  the dangers of Cape buffaloes. “No species on the planet has a more fearsome
  reputation than a Cape buffalo,” the statement reads, adding that the
  buffaloes are “responsible for several deaths and many injuries to hunters
  each year”. Watkins’s ex-wife also reportedly confirmed his death on social
  media, according to People magazine, writing that Watkins died on Sunday
  “suddenly in a tragic accident involving a Cape buffalo while on a hunting
  trip in South Africa”. “It’s a reality that’s still hard to put into words,”
  she added. “Our hearts are heavy as we navigate the days ahead.” A Texas
  native and Baylor University graduate, Watkins was a managing partner at
  Watkins Ranch Group, affiliated with Briggs Freeman and LIV Sotheby’s
  International Realty. His company biography described him as someone who
  “spent the better part of his life in the outdoors and on ranches” and a
  “proud and devoted father”. Watkins had a Facebook page where he shared
  hunting photos, often posing beside animals he had killed, including deer and
  mountain lions.
