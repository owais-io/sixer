  To get to the geothermal pool of the Squeeze near Taupō in New Zealand, you
  need to kayak across a lake and wade through a stream pinched between the
  narrow walls of a canyon. As she walked through the forest to get to the pool,
  Carmen Chan could feel the mud between her toes getting warmer. “It was such a
  visceral way to be in the forest,” Chan says. The pool had a hot waterfall,
  the steam from which created a fogginess “like an Indiana Jones adventure” –
  even though the real world, golf courses and highways, was only 6km away. A
  decade after that first trip, the now 32-year-old Chan is still hooked. The
  doctor regularly goes to local hot springs to soak her feet after a long shift
  at Rotorua hospital. Rotorua, three hours’ drive from Auckland in northern New
  Zealand, has geothermal pools thanks to the Taupō volcanic zone, an area of
  activity caused by the Pacific tectonic plate melting as it is pulled
  underneath the Australian plate. “Groundwater seeps through the crust and gets
  heated by magmas deep below,” says Adrian Pittari, an earth sciences lecturer
  at the University of Waikato. On a map of New Zealand’s hot springs there’s a
  trail of bright red dots, indicating springs of up to 90C, around Rotorua and
  nearby Taupō. The water has sometimes been as deep as 5km underneath the
  Earth’s surface where rock melts. Blue dots represent slightly cooler hot
  springs, created by the ambient heat of the Earth, scattered through the North
  Island and New Zealand’s Southern Alps. Where hot water spills from the earth,
  people have always gathered. Historical photos show Māori in the Rotorua area
  cooking food by lowering a basket into a near-boiling hot spring, or placing
  food underground to be cooked by steaming geothermal vents. At Whakarewarewa,
  a geothermal village in Rotorua, food is still prepared this way, and sold to
  visitors. Hot springs have attracted tourists to the Rotorua and Taupō region
  since the 1800s, with the New Zealand government paying for spas and health
  resorts to be developed starting in 1880. Today, geothermal activity remains a
  key draw for the area. “They’re so dynamic and visual, you can see the Earth
  in action,” says Pittari. Numerous resorts and geothermal areas have been
  developed as tourist sites, with paid entry, spa treatments and information
  about the natural and human history of the area. Many, like Whakarewarewa, are
  owned and operated by Māori. The area also has geothermal electricity
  stations, providing power into the grid. For locals, though, affordable basic
  hot springs or totally free sites in the forest are the way to go. “I used to
  go to the hot springs every Wednesday,” says Joel Mani, who grew up in
  Rotorua, making visits to the hot pools a regular routine with his family
  until he moved to Hamilton for work last year. It’s further now, but he still
  makes his way to a thermal pool whenever he can. His favourite pools, near
  Waiotapu between Rotorua and Taupō, have a warm spring right next to a hot
  one, and nearby parking with no thrashing through the forest required.
  Kerosene Creek, a warm river in the Kaingaroa Forest, is popular too, often
  filled with people soaking in the terraced pools. Going to a hot spring is
  social and relaxing. “Sometimes, it’s deep enough to do a manu,” Mani says,
  referring to the distinctive style of doing a bomb with one leg out popular in
  New Zealand. On his weekly hot pool trips, he brings lots of water or other
  beverages to stay hydrated, and waterproof speakers to play music. One of the
  trade-offs is the persistent smell of hydrogen sulphide, “like farts or a
  toilet”, from the springs, but “you get used to it”, Mani says. Pittari likes
  the pools around Wai-O-Tapu for their diversity of geological features,
  colourful sinter deposits and steaming pools rimed by minerals carried by the
  water from deep in the crust. Eventually, Pittari says, the plate boundary
  will shift and there won’t be so much heat to supply the steaming streams,
  pools and waterfalls in the area. But that is millions of years away, and in
  the meantime humans can enjoy them. “People want to sit in hot water and enjoy
  these unusual places on our planet’s surface,” Pittari says.
