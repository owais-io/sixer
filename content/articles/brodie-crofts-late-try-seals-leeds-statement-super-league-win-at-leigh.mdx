  For most of this season the conversation surrounding Leeds Rhinos has been
  about what happens in 2026 with uncertainty lingering over the future of their
  impressive head coach, Brad Arthur, the man who has transformed this club over
  the past year. The end of that particular saga is now just days away from a
  resolution, with Arthur expected to inform Leeds on Monday whether or not he
  will take up the multi-year contract that the Rhinos have tabled or whether he
  will return to Australia to continue his coaching career. And for all the
  drama and speculation concerning Arthur, it has perhaps been easy to miss the
  fact that he has restored one of Super League’s most successful clubs into
  legitimate challengers again. With all that in mind, there was perhaps no
  better time for his side to deliver a performance that should convince Arthur
  his future is here in 2026. The Australian has promised in recent weeks that
  the performances of his team will help shape his decision. If that is true,
  there can be no doubting in his mind that this project is well worth buying
  into long-term. Leeds have finished eighth in each of the past two seasons, a
  position far too low for a club of the Rhinos’ stature. But after arriving
  last summer and inheriting a squad bereft of confidence, Arthur has put Leeds
  in a position where they are legitimate contenders once again. Now just two
  points adrift of second-placed Wigan with six rounds to go, this win against a
  side who could themselves have ended the night in second was sensational. It
  was a contest that wasn’t decided until the final minutes when Brodie Croft
  finally settled a compelling game that would have been a fitting playoff
  encounter. “This team keeps fighting so hard,” Arthur said. “That’ll hold us
  in good stead for some big games later this year.” His side were second best
  in the opening quarter against a Leigh side who were hunting a fifth
  successive win and are themselves contenders. Tries from Umyla Hanley and
  Keanan Brand made it 8-0 but a wonderful 40-20 from Jake Connor decisively
  shifted the momentum back Leeds’ way. Tries from Lachie Miller and Sam Lisone,
  coupled with a conversion from the boot of Connor, made it 10-8 to the
  visitors at the break and from there, they remained ahead for the rest of the
  evening. That said, it certainly wasn’t straightforward as the contest
  continued to ebb and flow. Leeds opened up a two-score lead when Connor’s
  magnificent kick led to James Bentley scoring, with the half-back’s goal
  creating an eight-point advantage. Leigh responded when a fine move led to
  Brand scoring his second of the evening and suddenly, the gap was just two
  points again. Pre-Arthur, Leeds would have wilted at this point. They may not
  have even found themselves in such a position against a side this good. Leigh
  came close to going back ahead when Bailey Hodgson had a try disallowed and
  Josh Charnley fumbled a golden opportunity. But Leeds held on, breaking away
  in the final minutes to secure what could be a priceless victory as Miller
  broke downfield and Croft was in support to put the seal on another statement
  win. When pushed on whether that performance had convinced him to stay, Arthur
  would only say: “I absolutely love my time here.” There is not long left to
  wait but whatever his decision is, it is increasingly clear he could be
  leading this side out in a Grand Final come October.
