  Perhaps it is inevitable that the two most persistent evils in human societies
  – racism and misogyny – can be at times difficult to define and pin down. It’s
  like the elephant in the archetypal parable about the blind men who each touch
  one part of the beast and assume they know its nature. One touches the tail,
  and conceives a snake-like creature. Another the flank, and thinks of pillows
  and comfort. Another the tusk, and perceives danger. When they compare notes,
  they can’t believe the other’s account to be genuine. They suspect the others
  of delusion, or even of lying. Some of the obvious signs and symptoms of
  racism are a subjective experience, so we often find it hard to agree on the
  nature of the problem, let alone tackle it. This might go some way to
  explaining why, after the disturbing anti-immigration protests on the weekend,
  we can’t agree on what they mean, and whether racism was at their core. In
  this age of misinformation, even the numbers of protesters are not agreed.
  Elon Musk, a metaphorical blind man if ever there was one, shared a post on X
  which claimed it was 150,000 in Sydney and Brisbane. Police say it was closer
  to 21,000. Even immigration numbers have been misreported. The spurious claim
  that 1,500 migrants arrive every day in Australia was used by 2GB Radio host
  Ben Fordham, among others, to suggest the “March for Australia” protests were
  being held as a response to legitimate concerns about housing, rather than
  motivated by racism. But the figure he used is wrong, as the Australian Bureau
  of Statistics has been trying to make clear. Meanwhile, Andrew Bolt on Sky
  News Australia bangs the same drum. He asserted that while there were a
  minority of racist “morons and thugs” at the protests, it was “defaming some
  good people” to claim that racism was the prime motivation. Australia has a
  long history of this kind of defensiveness and denial. When ABC journalist
  Laura Tingle stated at the Sydney writers’ festival that Australia was a
  racist country, it caused an outrage. The Australian newspaper editorialised
  that she had demonstrated “loathing for the country the ABC is funded to
  serve”. Before that, Stan Grant got into trouble for commenting, during the
  ABC’s coverage of King Charles’s coronation, that the crown represents the
  invasion and theft of land from Indigenous Australians. For this he was mocked
  and abused. And yet, as he pointed out, Australia is the only Commonwealth
  country not to have signed treaties with First Nations people. “We cannot live
  in the fantasy Australia that pretends we have transcended this history,” he
  said. Further back, there were the 2005 Cronulla riots, which radio shock jock
  Alan Jones helped to incite by describing Lebanese Muslims as “vermin” who
  “rape and pillage a nation that’s taken them in”. The then prime minister,
  John Howard, declined to describe the Cronulla riots as racist, and has more
  recently held to his assertion that there is “no underlying racism in
  Australia”. How can it be that we have such different understandings of our
  nation? What hope is there of improving when we can’t even acknowledge
  verifiable facts, such as statistics, let alone more rubbery concepts such as
  the boundary between xenophobia (fear of difference and of strangers) and
  racism, or the boundary between criticism of Israel and antisemitism. Racism
  is defined by the Australian Human Rights Commission as “the process by which
  systems and policies, actions and attitudes create inequitable opportunities
  and outcomes for people based on race”. On that definition it is surely
  impossible not to recognise that Australia has underlying issues with racism.
  Yet, many things can be true at once. Australia was founded on racist
  assumptions. Yet it is also held up as a successful multicultural society.
  Those facts sit together, and in tension. In surveys of nations aimed at
  discovering which are most racist, Australia usually comes up comparatively
  well – not that there is any room for pride or complacency. We don’t have a
  legal system of apartheid, yet race is embedded into the constitution in
  section 51, which gives parliament the power to make laws for “the people of
  any race for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws”. This clause is
  the legacy of a perceived need to protect the white population from low-wage
  labourers from south-east Asia. Past surveys show that about 41% of us believe
  Australia is weakened by people of different ethnicities “sticking to their
  old ways”. About 20% believe African refugees increase crime in Australia.
  About 54% of those who speak a language other than English at home report
  workplace racism. I have a friend, born in India, who is a medical
  professional in a public hospital. Almost daily, she finds patients reluctant
  to be treated by her, because of her race. Is this xenophobia, or racism, or
  is it a distinction we should not worry about, rather focusing on the
  experience of the victim and the impact on the prejudiced patient and the
  system as a whole? The eminent sociologist Andrew Jakubowicz has answered the
  question about whether Australia is racist by saying we are a country with a
  racist history, endeavouring in many ways not to have a racist future. It is
  an optimistic take. It is certainly true that racism in Australia is hardly
  new. To that extent, the weekend marches should not surprise us. But optimism
  for the future can’t be justified if we flinch and defend every time someone
  points out the problem. It would be great to think we had a media and a
  politics capable of navigating and illuminating these complexities and
  ambiguities. The likes of Andrew Bolt and Ben Fordham make us weaker. They say
  they are proud of Australia, but undermine the future of the nation they say
  they love. • Margaret Simons is an award-winning freelance journalist and
