  The Teesside mega-rat: a 22-inch rodent and the great global rat crisis of
  2025

  Name: The Giant Rat of Normanby. Age: Unknown, but probably not more than
  three years old, given the lifespan of a rat. Appearance: Enormous! A giant
  rat! Where? Keep it away from me! Don’t worry, it’s deceased. The 22in
  colossus was found by a pest controller in a home in Normanby, Teesside. I’m
  more of a metric person, so I don’t know how big that is. You might prefer it
  that way: 22in is nearly 56cm. That’s five tins of beans, end to end. Or
  longer than the average cat (without tail). It looks exceptionally bulky, like
  a meerkat on steroids. Brrrr, I bet it could eat five tins of beans. Is this
  the biggest rat ever? No: the extinct Timor giant rat was absolutely vast:
  it’s estimated it could have weighed up to 6kg (nearly a stone). Conan Doyle
  wasn’t far wrong with his giant rat of Sumatra, then? About 4,000km, but sure.
  The Normanby specimen is still spectacular: it has beaten the 21in “Dorset
  mega-rat” of 2018. But it’s dead, you say, so we can go back to our
  giant-rodent-free lives? We certainly can’t hope for rodent-free lives. “It is
  a growing problem,” local councillor David Taylor said, blaming overflowing
  public bins and overgrown vegetation, among other factors. So, it’s a Normanby
  problem. Phew. Nope, it’s a great time to be a rat globally. Research on rat
  numbers published in January found that rising temperatures and population
  mean 11 global cities are experiencing significant increases in rat numbers:
  390% in Washington DC, 300% in San Francisco and 186% in Toronto, which is
  reported to be experiencing a “perfect rat storm”, according to a city
  councillor. New York reportedly has 3 million Remys running around, hence the
  city appointing a “rat tsar”. How about in the UK? Well, the same conditions
  that allow rats to thrive elsewhere – warmer temperatures, increasing urban
  populations creating more waste – apply here. And cuts hitting bin collections
  aren’t helping. The recent Birmingham bin strike apparently created a rat
  “banquet” of refuse. And how bad are rats, exactly? They can destroy
  infrastructure and contaminate food supplies (costing an estimated $27bn in
  the US alone) and carry about 50 zoonotic (that’s transmissible to humans)
  diseases and parasites, such as salmonella and leptospirosis. Research also
  shows they have a negative impact on the mental health of people affected by
  infestations. Ratatouille was a lie. What can we do? Rats are highly fertile
  (theoretically, they can conceive every 25 days), mobile and adaptable and can
  survive on as little as an ounce of food a day, so not much. Management
  strategies involve poisoning, trapping and trying to limit their food sources
  – and New York City and other places are experimenting with rat birth control
  – but we are fighting a losing battle. Do say: “The Normanby mega-rat is an
  outlier – most rats are only 6-11in long.” Don’t say: “Good luck shoving that
  under your chef’s hat.” • The headline and text of this article were amended
  on 5 August 2025. Normanby is in Teesside rather than Yorkshire or North
  Yorkshire as an earlier version said.
