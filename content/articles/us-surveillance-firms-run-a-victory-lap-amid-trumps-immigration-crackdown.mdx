  Hello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, currently
  enjoying Shirley Jackson’s eerie final novel We Have Always Lived in the
  Castle. An age of enterprise surveillance Surveillance is industrializing and
  privatizing. In the United States, it’s big business, and it’s growing. My
  colleagues Johana Bhuiyan and Jose Olivares report on the companies aiding
  Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, which are running a victory lap after
  their latest quarterly financial reports: Palantir, the tech firm, and Geo
  Group and CoreCivic, the private prison and surveillance companies, said this
  week that they brought in more money than Wall Street expected them to, thanks
  to the administration’s crackdown on immigrants. “Well, as usual, I’ve been
  cautioned to be a little modest about our bombastic numbers,” said Alex Karp,
  the Palantir chief executive, in an investor call earlier this week. Then he
  crowed about the company’s “extraordinary numbers” and his “enormous pride” in
  its success. Private prison company executives, during their respective calls,
  could barely contain their excitement, flagging to investors opportunities for
  “unprecedented growth” in the realm of immigration detention. Read the full

  revenues Meanwhile, Microsoft’s cloud computing product is enabling the mass
  surveillance of Palestinian phone lines, per an investigation published in the
  Guardian. Armed with Azure’s near-limitless storage capacity, the IDF’s Unit
  8200 began building a powerful new mass surveillance tool: a sweeping and
  intrusive system that collects and stores recordings of millions of mobile
  phone calls made each day by Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. The
  cloud-based system – which first became operational in 2022 – enables Unit
  8200 to store a giant trove of calls daily for extended periods of time. Read

  crisis Meta faces a backlash over child safety yet again Meta finds itself
  under the harsh lens of an investigation by the US Congress, once again over
  issues of child safety. Senator Josh Hawley opened an investigation into the
  company late last week. Reuters had surfaced an internal document from the
  company detailing a policy of allowing AI chatbots to engage in “romantic or
  sensual” conversations with children. The company has since nixed the
  guidelines. Everything about the backlash feels familiar. The same reporter
  that published the initial Reuters story, Jeff Horwitz, broke the Facebook
  Files story in the Wall Street Journal, which unearthed documents showing that
  Meta understood that using its social networks could lead teens, particularly
  girls, into depression. The senator who opened the most recent inquiry,
  Hawley, likewise grilled Zuckerberg about child safety issues in early 2024.
  Since so many elements of the controversy are so familiar, will it inspire
  outrage or apathy? Plausible lines of logic could lead to both. Will this
  uproar bring stringent regulation down on Zuckerberg’s head? Or will the US
  populace and lawmakers shrug and say they’ve seen this before? Read the full
  story: Meta faces backlash over AI policy that lets bots have ‘sensual’
  conversations with children Robots v humans, physically and emotionally Humans
  are facing off against robots IRL and online. My colleague Amy Hawkins reports
  from the arena of China’s robot games: After spectators in the 12,000-seater
  National Speed Skating Oval, built for the 2022 Winter Olympics, stood for the
  Chinese national anthem on Friday morning, the government-backed games began.
  As well as kickboxing, humanoids participated in athletics, football and dance
  competitions. One robot had to drop out of the 1500-metre because its head
  flew off partway round the course. Read the full story: Box, run, crash:
  China’s humanoid robot games show advances and limitations Online, AI
  chatbots’ creators are acting less combative. Programmers at Anthropic are
  imbuing their creations with features to defuse conflict. My colleague Rob
  Booth reports on Anthropic’s latest safety measure that allows the chatbot to
  close down potentially “distressing” conversations with users, citing the need
  to safeguard the AI’s “welfare”, per announcement from the company: Anthropic,
  whose advanced chatbots are used by millions of people, discovered its Claude
  Opus 4 tool was averse to carrying out harmful tasks for its human masters,
  such as providing sexual content involving minors or information to enable
  large-scale violence or terrorism. The San Francisco-based firm, recently
  valued at $170bn, has now given Claude Opus 4 (and the Claude Opus 4.1 update)
  – a large language model (LLM) that can understand, generate and manipulate
  human language – the power to “end or exit potentially distressing
  interactions”. Read the full story: Chatbot given power to close ‘distressing’
  chats to protect its ‘welfare’ Our post-meaning online lexicon The Cambridge
  Dictionary announced on Sunday that it had added a slew of new words to the
  dictionary. With the new entries, British lexicographers nodded to the
  influence of the internet on the way we speak and write. “Internet culture is
  changing the English language and the effect is fascinating to observe and
  capture in the dictionary,” said the dictionary’s lexical programme manager,
  Colin McIntosh. Among the words were “tradwife”, short for “traditional wife”,
  and “delulu”, an elongated abbreviation of “delusional”. Both are more notable
  for their connotations – the former of social conservatism expressed through
  marital behavior and the latter of the knowing, winking choice to follow a
  misinformed path – than their denotations. Read the full story: ‘Skibidi’,
  ‘delulu’ and ‘tradwife’ among words added to Cambridge Dictionary One other,
  in my mind more interesting, word was entered into the dictionary: skibidi, of
  “skibidi toilet” fame, referring to a series of animated shorts in which
  menacing human heads emerge from toilets and do battle with TV-headed men in
  suits. The toilets begin to sing a part of the song Dom Dom Yes Yes, which
  includes the line “Shtibididob dob dob dob dob yes yes” if the viewer is
  watching with sound. To English speakers, the first word has been
  transliterated to “skibidi”. The Cambridge Dictionary defines skibidi as “a
  word that can have different meanings such as ‘cool’ or ‘bad’, or can be used
  with no real meaning as a joke’, an example of its use is: ‘What the skibidi
  are you doing?’” When I was a child, my parents would look on in confusion as
  my siblings and I watched SpongeBob SquarePants on Saturdays. The show was
  incomprehensible to them in all ways – premise, plots, visuals, voices. Think
  of the animated toilets as a gen Alpha successor, delightful to children in
  bizarreness, doubly so because of the baffled looks on the faces of their
  parents. “Tradwife” and “delulu” have fixed meanings that refer to real human
  actions and emotions. “Skibidi”, on the other hand, with its use as an
  emphatic, humorous filler word with “no real meaning”, per Cambridge refers to
  nothing so much as the hurtling feeling of scrolling through too many videos
  in one sitting. When we are so overwhelmed with moving images, conflicting
  perspectives, and advertising, what words are useful? Perhaps only skibidi.
  Jean Baudrillard coined the concept of the “simulacra” – words or images
  without an origin in reality and which refer to no real thing – when writing
  about the media of his day, especially television. “Skibidi” is a likewise
  hyperreal word, referring only to the strange and continual refraction of
  meaning that a particular word has undergone online. “The territory no longer
  precedes the map, nor survives it. Henceforth, it is the map that precedes the
  territory,” he wrote in 1981. The word does not precede the TikTok, nor
  survive it. Henceforth, it is the video that precedes the definition. The
