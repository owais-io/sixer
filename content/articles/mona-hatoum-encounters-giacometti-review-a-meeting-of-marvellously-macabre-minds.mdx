  Mona Hatoum’s show begins with an indelible afterimage of modern war. Into a
  stack of welded steel boxes resembling an apartment block in a city that could
  be anywhere, Hatoum has melted or blasted holes imitating drone or missile
  strikes. Parts of interior walls and floors have been shorn away to look like
  apartments with their fronts blown off. This is the shell of what was once a
  home to many, emptied out by war, like the buildings you saw on the news last
  night. Hatoum created Bourj, which means “tower” in Arabic, for an exhibition
  in Beirut, the city where she was born into a Palestinian family in 1952.
  Since 1975 she has been based in London but her art knows no peace. Home and
  family are perforated by violence. A steel cot resembling a prison cell has
  cheese wire in place of a soft mattress. A kitchen with small chairs for the
  kids, alongside larger ones for mum and dad, has been incinerated, and the
  carbonised fragments of wooden furniture painstakingly reassembled inside wire
  mesh replicas of what they looked like before the disaster. In a work made
  this year, a baby’s disembodied arm lies on the ground. Cast from glass it
  could almost be cute, like a little handprint on a kitchen wall. Except you
  know it’s not. It filters a horror too terrible to look at or even think about
  directly: the reality of what happens when you bomb children. What, you may
  wonder, has all this to do with Alberto Giacometti, the Swiss modern sculptor
  who died in 1966? A lot, it turns out. This is the second in a series of
  exhibitions that juxtapose Giacometti with contemporary artists. In the first,
  he was made to look old and safe by the wildly creative Huma Bhabha, but this
  is a more complex, reciprocal conversation – between Hatoum and an artist she
  loves, or at least finds common cause with against a terrifying world. Her
  cheese wire prison cot, Incommunicado, stands next to Giacometti’s most brutal
  work, his 1932 bronze Woman with Her Throat Cut: a sprawled body on the
  ground, opened up like an anatomical model, resembling a giant praying mantis
  with a long, exposed oesophagus and a head that is a tiny screaming mask.
  Giacometti was part of the surrealist movement when he created this splayed
  frenzy. Does it wallow in the macabre? Hatoum suggests you have to do that to
  capture the violence of reality in art. Close by she places her piece A Bigger
  Splash: six giant, blood-red splashes that she cast in glass in a workshop in
  Murano. Most artists working in Venice would be inspired by sunsets or canals
  but for Hatoum it’s always blood. She – unlike David Hockney, whom she mocks
  with her title – can’t forget the world’s anguish. And she sees a fellow
  spirit in Giacometti. That empathy with an artist who died when she was 14
  takes an extraordinary twist when they create a joint work. Giacometti’s The
  Nose, made in 1947, looks like the grinning skull of a commedia dell’ arte
  clown, out of which sprouts a thin spear of a nose. Here, it is displayed
  inside Hatoum’s prison-cell-like Cube, a steel cage just big enough for a
  person. Their “joint” artwork is an unholy installation of nihilistic despair.
  Giacometti’s carnivalesque death mask – he said it grew out of watching people
  die, their noses appearing to enlarge as their cheeks sank – is a prisoner in
  Hatoum’s image of authority, abuse, oppression. What the two share is a
  seriousness about life, a refusal to shy away from the modern world’s pain.
  But Hatoum’s eye for Giacometti’s black humour also leads her to include his
  delightful 1954 sculpture Cat, a long, slender cartoon kitty on a permanent
  prowl. It’s the feline equivalent of his walking human figures, and while they
  resemble Etruscan funeral statuettes, this puss looks like an Egyptian
  mummified feline. Archaeology is for both these artists a bedrock of the
  human. Near Giacometti’s cat, Hatoum shows her Terracotta Tile, a red tile
  with a dog’s paw-print in it – her homage to ancient Roman tiles that still
  preserve the prints of pooches who died 2,000 years ago. Sculpture has changed
  a lot since Giacometti’s death but this series proves what magnificent power
  it has in our century. Hatoum shares Giacometti’s grief, terror and compassion
  even though their attitude to media is very different. Back in 1985 she walked
  doggedly through Brixton, barefoot, with Doctor Marten boots tied to her
  ankles. The video of this performance is shown here close to a Giacometti
  striding statuette. She pounds the streets, watched by puzzled passers by,
  dragging the weight of those empty boots – the weight of the world. Mona
  Hatoum Encounters: Giacometti is at the Barbican, London, from 3 September to
