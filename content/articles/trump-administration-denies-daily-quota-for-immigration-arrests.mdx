  In a new court filing, attorneys for the Trump administration denied the
  existence of a daily quota for immigration arrests, despite reports and prior
  statements from White House officials about pursuing a goal of at least 3,000
  deportations or deportation arrests per day. In May, reports from both the
  Guardian and Axios revealed that during a meeting with Immigration and Customs
  Enforcement (Ice) leaders on 21 May, the White House adviser Stephen Miller
  and the Department of Homeland Security secretary, Kristi Noem, demanded that
  immigration agents seek to arrest 3,000 people per day. Following that report,
  Miller appeared on Fox News in late May and stated that “under President
  Trump’s leadership, we are looking to set a goal of a minimum of 3,000 arrests
  for Ice every day.” He added that Trump “is going to keep pushing to get that
  number up higher each and every day”. However, in a court filing on Friday,
  lawyers representing the US justice department said that the Department of
  Homeland Security had confirmed that “neither Ice leadership nor its field
  offices have been directed to meet any numerical quota or target for arrests,
  detentions, removals, field encounters, or any other operational activities
  that Ice or its components undertake in the course of enforcing federal
  immigration law.” The filing is part of an ongoing lawsuit in southern
  California, where immigrant advocacy groups have sued the Trump
  administration, accusing it of conducting unconstitutional immigration sweeps
  in the Los Angeles area. In mid-July a judge issued a temporary restraining
  order barring immigration agents from detaining individuals based on factors
  such as race, occupation or speaking Spanish anywhere in the central district
  of California, which includes Los Angeles. On Friday, an appeals court upheld
  that order. Politico reported that during a hearing earlier this week in the
  case, the justice department lawyers were pressed on the reports regarding the
  alleged arrest quota, and a judge reportedly asked whether it was a “policy of
  the administration at this time to deport 3,000 persons per day?”. An attorney
  for the justice department, Yaakov Roth, reportedly responded “Not to my
  knowledge, your honor” per Politico. And in the government’s filing on Friday,
  the attorneys for the government said that the allegations of that the
  “government maintains a policy mandating 3,000 arrests per day appears to
  originate from media reports quoting a White House advisor who described that
  figure as a ‘goal’ that the Administration was ‘looking to set’”. “That
  quotation may have been accurate, but no such goal has been set as a matter of
  policy and no such directive has been issued to or by DHS or ICE,” the
  attorneys added. The discrepancy was first reported by the Los Angeles Daily
  News and Politico. When asked about the discrepancy, Tricia McLaughlin, the
  DHS assistant press secretary, said in a statement to the Guardian: “Under
  Secretary Noem, we are delivering on President Trump’s and the American
  people’s mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens to make American
  safe. “Secretary Noem unleashed ICE to target the worst of the worst and carry
  out the largest deportation operation of criminal aliens in American history,”
  McLaughlin added. In a later statement to the Guardian, a spokesperson from
  Ice said “there is no quota that … agents must meet, but there are goals to
  aim for”. The statement added that Ice “is working diligently to implement the
  administration’s goals of focusing on illegal aliens who pose a threat to the
  security of our communities”. The agency’s statement also said it “continues
  to identify, target and apprehend those with criminal convictions or
  outstanding warrants, as well as those who have illegally re-entered the
  United States or have a final order of removal.” In a statement to Politico, a
  White House spokesperson also did not directly address the questions about the
  discrepancy, but said that “the Trump Administration is committed to carrying
  out the largest mass deportation operation in history by enforcing federal
  immigration law and removing the countless violent, criminal illegal aliens
  that Joe Biden let flood into American communities.” A justice department
  spokesperson told the outlet that there is no disconnect between the
  department’s court filings and the White House’s public statements. The
  spokesperson added that “the entire Trump administration is united in fully
  enforcing our nation’s immigration laws and the DoJ continues to play an
  important role in vigorously defending the president’s deportation agenda in
  court.” At various points during his 2024 election campaign, Trump claimed
  that he would target between 15 and 20 million people who are undocumented in
  the US for deportation. As of 2022, there were 11 million undocumented
  immigrants living in the US.
