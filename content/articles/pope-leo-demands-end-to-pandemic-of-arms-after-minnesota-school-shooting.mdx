  Pope Leo XIV called for the “pandemic of arms, large and small” to end during
  a weekly public prayer with crowds in St Peter’s Square on Sunday that also
  addressed the plague of mass shootings in the US. The first US pope in
  history, a native of Chicago, spoke in English as he prayed for the victims of
  last week’s shooting during a Catholic school mass in Minnesota which saw two
  children killed and others seriously injured. “Our prayers for the victims of
  the tragic shooting during a school mass in the American state of Minnesota,”
  he said. “We hold in our prayers the countless children killed and injured
  every day around the world. Let us plead God to stop the pandemic of arms,
  large and small, which infects our world.” Fletcher Merkel, eight, and Harper
  Moyski, 10, were killed in the shooting on Wednesday at the Annunciation
  Catholic school church in Minneapolis and 18 people were injured. The shooter
  fired 116 rifle rounds through the church’s stained glass windows before he
  died by suicide. The shooting has reignited debate over guns in the US after
  the Minneapolis mayor, Jacob Frey, called for solutions on gun control rather
  than the “thoughts and prayers” statements often made by Republicans. The US
  has experienced, by far, a higher proportion of mass gun shootings than other
  countries around the world. The pope had initially refrained from political
  commentary in response to the shooting, offering condolences by telegram,
  stating he was saddened by the “terrible tragedy”. “While commending the souls
  of the deceased children to the love of Almighty God, His Holiness prays for
  the wounded as well as the first responders, medical personnel and clergy who
  are caring for them and their loved ones. At this extremely difficult time,
  the Holy Father imparts to the Annunciation Catholic School Community, the
  Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis and the people of the greater Twin
  Cities metropolitan area his Apostolic Blessing as a pledge of peace,
  fortitude and consolation in the Lord Jesus,” the telegram stated. He began
  his appeal on Sunday by calling for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine, calling
  on both sides to make a “serious commitment to dialogue”. “It’s time that
  those responsible renounce the logic of weapons and take the path of
  negotiations and peace, with the support of the international community,” Leo
  said. “The voice of weapons must be silenced, while the voice of fraternity
  and justice must rise.” Leo’s predecessor, Pope Francis, had long decried the
  weapons industry calling gun manufacturers “merchants of death” and asked
  during his speech to US Congress in 2015 why weapons were sold purely to kill.
  “Sadly, the answer, as we all know, is simply for money: money that is
  drenched in blood, often innocent blood,” Francis said during his speech. “In
  the face of this shameful and culpable silence, it is our duty to confront the
  problem and to stop the arms trade.”
