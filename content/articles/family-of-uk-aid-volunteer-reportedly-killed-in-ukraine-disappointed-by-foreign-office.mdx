  The family of a British aid volunteer reportedly killed in a drone strike in
  Ukraine said they were very disappointed by the reaction from the Foreign
  Office. Annie Lewis Marffy, 69, travelled from her home in Silverton, near
  Exeter in Devon in late May to deliver supplies packed into a green Toyota
  Rav4 in a mission arranged by the non-profit organisation Aid Ukraine UK. She
  was to take the vehicle in convoy with a British volunteer to Kramatorsk in
  the contested Donbas region. She arrived in Ukraine on 4 June and reportedly
  sustained “injuries incompatible with life” in a Russian drone strike on the
  morning of 11 June, according to a police file. The Kramatorsk district police
  department said her body “remains in an area of active hostilities, making it
  impossible to conduct evacuation measures” to transfer it to the forensic
  medical examination department. Based on this information, her relatives have
  asked for a death certificate to be issued either through local authorities or
  the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO). They said this would
  allow them to grieve properly for the “brave, capable and determined” mother
  of three and begin the probate process. Katarzyna Bylok, the founder of Aid
  Ukraine UK, told the PA Media news agency that issuing a death certificate
  could take months or years, as Lewis Marffy’s remains could not be safely
  recovered. She described the area where the volunteer was allegedly killed as
  a “kill zone”. “It leaves her family in a horrible red-tape limbo,” she said.
  “They will never get her body. But what they need is the ability to close her
  affairs. Her sons have their hands tied; they don’t have power of attorney.”
  The family said: “All the family, the sisters and the sons, have been very
  disappointed at the reaction of the FCDO and the lack of response from the
  police. “After all this time, we haven’t got any report at all from the
  Ukrainian police. That has to come from Ukraine and would be sent to Devon and
  Cornwall police.” They said police had retained Lewis Marffy’s computer for
  analysis, which contained information that would help the family manage her
  affairs. “The family are desperate to get more information. Her sons have been
  told that their mother is missing, presumed dead,” they said. Bylok said there
  was an expedited process in Ukraine to certify deaths in cases where remains
  could not be recovered, though it still took six to 12 months. “There is
  enough evidence to prove that Annie is dead,” she said. “The procedures
  stating that you need to have remains or DNA for a death certificate need to
  be updated.” Lewis Marffy travelled through Europe in convoy with a former
  soldier from Wales, who had to return to the UK after becoming unwell in
  Poland. After it was suggested she should hand the vehicle to Aid Ukraine
  teams in Lviv, she insisted she would continue her mission to deliver the
  supplies to the Ukrainian military in Kramatorsk. She contacted Aid Ukraine on
  the evening of 10 June, saying she was 55 minutes from her destination. After
  failing to hear from Lewis Marffy, Bylok posted a picture of her on Telegram
  and asked for information about her whereabouts. Police then contacted Bylok
  to say Lewis Marffy had been killed, she said. An FCDO spokesperson said: “We
  are supporting the family of a British woman who is missing in Ukraine and are
  in contact with the local authorities.”
