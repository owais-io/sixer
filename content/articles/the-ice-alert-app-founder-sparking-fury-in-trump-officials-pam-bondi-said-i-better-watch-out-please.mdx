  better watch out? Please.’

  For many undocumented immigrants living in the US, the constant threat of Ice
  raids has turned their homes into prisons. Leaving the house to go to work,
  school, buy groceries or the doctor’s office all carry unthinkable risks. It’s
  a problem that Joshua Aaron wanted to tackle. A former indie musician (he
  played bass in 2000s buzz band The Rosenbergs and later fronted his own group
  Stealing Heather) turned app entrepreneur, he set about making an app that
  could spot Ice and alert people, the same way drivers let other drivers know
  about traffic stops on Waze. Launched without fanfare and with no intention of
  profit in April 2025, IceBlock offers real-time alerts about the presence of
  agents – while, Aaron claims, fiercely guarding the anonymity of its users.
  Within two months, the app had soared on the charts in Apple’s app store –
  prompting the US homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, to attack the app
  and its founder, claiming they were “obstructing justice”. She claimed she
  wanted to work with the Department of Justice to try to prosecute CNN for
  reporting on the app. Noem’s intervention ensured the app topped the charts
  for a number of days (although it has since fallen out of the top 100). Then
  last month Aaron’s wife, Carolyn Feinstein, was fired from her Department of
  Justice job in Austin, Texas. The couple believe it was clear “retaliation”
  for the app, despite Feinstein not being involved in the app’s creation or
  promotion. Aaron is an unlikely figure in this space – he has a brash,
  rock’n’roll demeanor and not much experience in immigration activism. His
  background has led to some questions about how well the app protects its
  users, especially as it asks you to keep your location data on at all times.
  But a number of independent investigations have shown he is managing to keep
  users anonymous. Aaron spoke with the Guardian a week after his wife’s firing.
  First of all, what happened to your wife? Why was she fired? They fired her as
  retribution against me. They can’t do shit to me. I’m not going to be afraid.
  So they fired her. Were they explicit in why they were firing her? No, that’s
  the crazy part, in her termination letter, she got accused of lack of candor
  but they didn’t mention the app. But the Department of Justice responded to
  every journalist that reached out in, like, five minutes. They had a prepared
  statement for an auditor in Austin? In the US trustee department? They have
  nothing to do with immigration. They have nothing to do with anything else
  with the DoJ, they’re a whole separate division that handles bankruptcy. What
  did they say? They had this prepared statement, they accused her of
  threatening law enforcement officers and endangering the lives of Ice agents
  and all this horrible shit. It was very different from her termination letter.
  The whole thing started when Laura Loomer doxed her on X and then said that
  she spoke to Tom Homan. Homan goes on Newsmax and says that he spoke to the
  DoJ, which obviously is [headed by] Pam Bondi. Twenty-four hours later, my
  wife gets a termination letter from the deputy director of the DoJ. It was
  pretty obvious that it went from Loomer to Homan and to Bondi to “You’re
  fired.” That was it. [A spokesperson for the Department of Justice said they
  discovered his wife, Feinstein, has a sizable interest in All U Chart Inc, the
  company that holds the IP for IceBlock. In a statement, they said: “ICEBlock
  is an app that illegal aliens use to evade capture while endangering the lives
  of ICE officers by disclosing their location. This DOJ will not tolerate
  threats against law enforcement officers.” Aaron acknowledged that his wife
  always owns a 20% share in any company he starts. He describes this as a
  security precaution: if something were to happen to him, Feinstein would have
  the legal ability to take over the company without complications. He says she
  had no involvement in the development or operation of the IceBlock app.] It
  must be tough for your family. She worked there for almost a decade. She has
  decades of experience in the private sector, and she’s really, really good at
  what she does, and was honestly beloved by everyone she worked with. They just
  basically fired her and accused her of all this horrible stuff, and none of
  it’s true. It really, really sucks. She misses it terribly. Are you worried
  about other ways the Trump administration might retaliate? Well, you have Pam
  Bondi accusing me and saying, I better “watch out.” Please, come on. I better
  watch out? Why? I’m protected under the first amendment. This is perfectly
  legal, and I made sure of that – I checked with multiple constitutional
  attorneys and criminal attorneys before I released this app, because I was
  concerned about whether I’m protected. And everyone agreed 100% this is
  protected speech. Can you explain briefly how IceBlock works? Well it can only
  be downloaded from the US app store, and people can only report sightings
  within a five-mile radius of where they are currently. Then all sightings get
  deleted after four hours. So let’s say there are 100 people in a five-mile
  area, and one person sees Ice – they’re walking down the street, whatever –
  and they go, “Oh, shit.” And they report it. All the other users in that
  five-mile radius get an immediate notification that shows up on their phone.
  The app has been live for quite a few months. Do you get the sense it’s
  actually being used to by people who are worried about Ice? I have no idea,
  because it’s 100% anonymous. We don’t track those metrics. I get asked all the
  time: “Where are most of your users?” I have no fucking idea. “How many
  sightings do you get per hour?” I don’t know. We don’t track this. It’s so
  hard to answer these basic questions that normal apps would be able to answer
  because there is the whole core principle of anonymity. We don’t have that
  data, and I don’t want it. The only thing I can tell you is that currently on
  the app we have 445 sightings nationwide [likely over a four-hour window due
  to the fact that sightings stay up for four hours once reported] and we have
  just about 1 million users that have this installed on their phones right now.
  But is it being downloaded by well-meaning liberals who support what you’re
  doing? Or is it doing its practical job and helping undocumented people as a
  practical tool in their lives? Maybe we just can’t know that yet? I would say
  this, most people who download the app are doing it to keep themselves safe,
  so they want to know what’s going on around their five-mile radius. So yes, I
  think it’s very much being used for how it’s intended to be used. I didn’t
  want to have to build this, but it is a necessity. It is a tool as this early
  warning system that does keep people safe, and it is, I think, giving people
  peace of mind, especially those who are most affected by it or most at risk.
  It allows them to go to that restaurant or walk around that neighborhood with
  a little bit of peace of mind. What were the initial fears and challenges? Did
  you worry about whether the Apple app store was going to allow it on? How
  confident was I I could do it? I don’t want to sound egotistical – and don’t
  print this so I sound like a fucking asshole – but, dude, I can fucking do it.
  Of course, I could do it. Even with my music career, I built audio studios,
  and I was a producer and a mix engineer, and I designed gear. So I’ve always
  kind of been on that tech engineering side of things like, that’s just how my
  brain works. And I’ve been coding a healthcare app for the past four and a
  half years. So as far as could I write the code? Could I make it happen? This
  is a crazy easy app. Would it be approved by Apple? That was an interesting
  one, because nothing like it has ever been done before. When I brought it to
  Apple and I submitted it to the app store, it got pushed back, and it took
  three weeks of going back and forth with Apple’s legal department and
  higher-ups in Apple’s app review, and there were conversations almost on a
  daily basis with senior people there saying: “Is this even legal? Can we do
  this? Are we going to get in trouble for having this?” Apple had a hard time
  wrapping their head around it, because they were like, “What do you mean
  you’re never going to make money? What do you mean you’re never going to track
  anything?” I was like, “Yeah, that’s the point. I don’t care.” I don’t care
  about people’s data as far as, like, being able to get analytics or track them
  or sell their data. I don’t care about any of that. I care about keeping
  people safe. That is literally the whole point. Eventually they allowed it on.
  Because there are no user accounts, and no way of you seeing what’s happening
  on the app, there’s no way to block bad actors. Does that mean there is a
  possibility of people reporting false sightings? I can’t verify the sightings
  without driving to rural Indiana and seeing if they’re there. I’ve put in
  safeguards: you can only report a sighting once every five minutes so you
  can’t just spam the database; all sightings are deleted after four hours; it
  has to be a real address – you can’t type in 123 Main Street; and you can only
  report within your own five-mile radius. So with all of those safeguards – are
  there any false sightings? Yes, of course there are. Are they prevalent? No,
  because it would be too time-consuming. And what’s the worst-case scenario for
  a false sighting anyway? That a user gets a notification on their device and
  says: “Hey, I’ll stay away from that address for a couple hours?” Who gives a
  shit. So beyond helping people – what’s your personal interest in developing
  these apps? You’re also working on a healthcare app, which is also focused on
  keeping patient data private. Yes, my whole thing is very, very
  privacy-focused. I don’t use Gmail. I run my own mail servers. I run my own
  web servers. I have always done that because I just don’t trust these
  companies who are reading all of your messages, and they’re doing it to
  harvest your data and market to you. I want myself to be private. I’m an
  individual. I think that lent quite a bit to the way that I thought about
  IceBlock. I’ve had my IceBlock open while we’ve been on the phone, and there’s
  been one reported sighting in my area. Yeah, isn’t that nice to know that? I
  mean, you’re British right, obviously you are not a native-born American. So
  now you know maybe don’t go over in that area for the next couple hours. Not a
  big deal. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity • This
  article was amended on 13 August 2025; an earlier version incorrectly said
  that Carolyn Feinstein was arrested, not fired.
