  Donald Trump has ordered federal officers to start sweeping the streets of
  Washington DC, launching what the White House is calling a seven-day crackdown
  on violent crime just one day after threatening to “federalize” the city. The
  mobilization, which began on Thursday night, follows an attempted carjacking
  that left well-known Trump administration figure Edward “Big Balls” Coristine
  bloodied and injured. “Washington DC is an amazing city, but it has been
  plagued by violent crime for far too long,” the White House press secretary,
  Karoline Leavitt, said in a statement. “President Trump has directed an
  increased presence of federal law enforcement to protect innocent citizens.
  Starting tonight, there will be no safe harbor for violent criminals in DC.”
  The deployments come despite crime statistics showing violent crime in
  Washington hit a 30-year low in 2024, according to city police data. Crime has
  continued to decline in the first half of 2025 compared with the previous
  year. The operation will focus on “high traffic tourist areas”, Leavitt said,
  and involves multiple federal agencies working alongside local police forces
  under Trump’s March executive order “Making DC Safe and Beautiful Task Force”.
  All federal officers are clearly identified in marked vehicles and maintain
  high visibility, according to the White House statement. The announcement
  follows Trump’s social media threat to take federal control of Washington DC
  if local authorities failed to address crime. In a Truth Social post, the
  president called for minors as young as 14 to be prosecuted as adults and
  declared: “If this continues, I am going to exert my powers, and FEDERALIZE
  this City.” Federal officers from the US park police will lead the effort,
  supported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s homeland security
  investigations unit and enforcement and removal operations divisions. The
  Metropolitan police department, US Capitol police and Metro transit police are
  also participating. On the first night after the White House announcement,
  federal agent deployment across the city was reportedly minimal. The
  Associated Press conducted a two-hour street tour starting at 1am and found
  little evidence of the promised surge. Just before 2am on Friday, the Bureau
  of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives posted on social media that
  federal law enforcement partners were “out ensuring that the residents of the
  District of Columbia are safer this evening” while appearing to be near the
  Petworth metro station in north-west Washington DC. They tagged US park
  police, the US Marshals Service and local Ice and FBI offices. The Washington
  Legal Clinic raised concerns about the operation’s scope, warning on social
  media that Trump was planning “7 nights of action, rounding up homeless people
  and attempting civil commitment or arrests for as many as possible”. The
  organization noted there was currently no available shelter space. The White
  House, in their statement, said the seven-day operation could be extended “as
  needed”.
