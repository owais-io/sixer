  A collection of photographs taken by Paul McCartney when the Beatles were on
  the brink of global stardom are to be shown in an exhibition that sheds light
  on intimate moments as the group first experienced fame. Rearview Mirror:
  Liverpool-London-Paris, which opens at Gagosian in London on 28 August,
  features 18 shots taken by the singer-songwriter during late 1963 after the
  release of the Beatles’ first album, and early 1964 as they travelled to the
  US. Joshua Chuang, the director of photography at Gagosian, said the images
  captured the Beatles before the all-consuming fame of a few months later.
  “When Paul is most prolific when using his camera parallels the time in which
  they actually had time. When they weren’t so overwhelmed by being so
  overexposed and in demand,” Chuang said. “It was a really precious few months
  in which they’re realising who they are, who they are to other people, and
  want to participate in that image formation.” The Beatles released their first
  two albums in 1963: Please Please Me and With the Beatles, which catapulted
  them into the limelight, powered by what the Guardian called “a different and
  heavily northern-flavoured sound of their own”. The band followed that up in
  1964 with singles including A Hard Day’s Night and two more albums that helped
  them break America and become a global phenomenon. In autumn 1963, McCartney
  decided to pick up a camera, long before he and the group became some of the
  most photographed people on the planet. He bought a simple Pentax and used
  mostly black and white Kodak and Ilford film, and took a small selection of
  colour images in early 1964. “I think they knew that history was happening,”
  said Chuang. “They wanted to capture it, and do it themselves. They picked a
  camera for the same reason anyone does, to have your own view.” There are also
  more reflective self-portraits taken before live shows and interviews. One of
  the self-portraits is taken in the attic of McCartney’s then girlfriend, the
  actor Jane Asher, which is where he wrote the melody for Yesterday. Chuang
  said: “When life is happening so quickly and changing so quickly, you don’t
  often have a chance to stop and look at yourself in the mirror. And I really
  think that’s exactly what he’s doing: looking at himself in the near and
  wanting to crystallise that moment, not knowing what was going to happen
  next.” The images cover the era when the band were well known in the UK but
  could still get the cold shoulder when they ventured abroad. McCartney’s
  photos from Paris hint at a less-than-rapturous response in the French
  capital. He captures the modest crowds outside the Olympia – where they had a
  three-week run – and a stroll down the Champs-Élysées where John Lennon could
  still walk freely. Some of the images were shown in 2023 at Paul McCartney
  Photographs 1963-64: Eyes of the Storm, an exhibition of the photos he
  rediscovered during the pandemic.
