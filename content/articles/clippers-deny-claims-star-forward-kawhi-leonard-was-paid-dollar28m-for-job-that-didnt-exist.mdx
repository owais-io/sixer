  didn’t exist

  The Los Angeles Clippers and their owner, Steve Ballmer, have denied
  allegations the team’s star forward, Kawhi Leonard, was paid $28m for a job
  that doesn’t exist. Journalist Pablo Torre laid out the allegations in his
  podcast on Wednesday. Torre, citing legal documents, claims Ballmer employed
  Leonard for a non-existent role in one of his companies to circumvent the NBA
  salary cap, which punishes teams for spending too much on player salaries.
  Torre claims that Ballmer partially funded a now defunct tree-planting company
  called Aspiration. That company then allegedly entered into a $28m agreement
  with KL2 Aspire, LLC, a company owned by Leonard. Torre says he could find no
  evidence that Leonard had ever performed any work for Aspiration, and there
  was a clause in the contract between KL2 Aspire and Aspiration effectively
  allowed Leonard to be paid even if he did no work. Another clause said the
  deal would be voided if Leonard left the Clippers. One former employee of
  Aspiration told Torre he had heard the deal with Leonard had been set up to
  “circumvent the salary cap.” The Clippers and Ballmer denied the allegations
  in a statement released to Torre. “Neither Mr Ballmer nor the Clippers
  circumvented the salary cap or engaged in any misconduct related to
  Aspiration,” the statement said. “Any contrary assertion is provably false.”
  The NBA investigated Leonard’s advisor, Dennis Robertson, in 2019 and found
  the Clippers had not granted the player any impermissible benefits when they
  pursued him in free agency. Leonard, a six-time All-Star, joined the Clippers
  in July 2019 after leading the Toronto Raptors to the NBA title. The NBA is
  yet to comment on Torre’s story, but has said in the past it would reopen the
  investigation into Robertson if new evidence emerged. Under the terms of the
  NBA collective bargaining agreement, the Clippers could be fined up to $4.5m
  for a first offense if they attempted to circumvent the salary cap. They could
  also be docked a first-round draft pick.
