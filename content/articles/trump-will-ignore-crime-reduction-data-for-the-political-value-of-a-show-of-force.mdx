  “They fought back against law enforcement last night, and they’re not going to
  be fighting back long,” Donald Trump said of young people on a “rampage
  through city streets” at his press conference this morning. “See, they fight
  back until you knock the hell out of them, because it’s the only language they
  understand.” Lay this comment against a series of executive orders about law
  enforcement and civil rights that the president has issued over the last seven
  months, and one consequence of the federalization of police in Washington DC
  becomes evident: Trump will ignore measured effectiveness in reducing crime
  for the political value of a show of force. “There is no public safety
  emergency warranting the deployment of the national guard on DC streets or the
  federalization of the city’s police force,” said Ryan Downer, legal director
  of the Washington Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, a
  Washington DC-based civil rights group that has litigated police brutality
  cases. Noting a sharp decrease in violent crime – reaching a 30-year low this
  year – Downer said that federalizing control of the district “is an invitation
  for abuse. When you try to solve a problem of criminal behavior with
  overpolicing and harsher penalties … you see increases in police violence and
  police harassment. It’s a call at the highest levels for police lawlessness.”
  Downer said his group would be vigilantly looking for stories to share about
  police abuses over the term of federal control of the district’s police. But
  accountability under these conditions is complicated. Police officers almost
  anywhere else in the US are constrained both by state and federal law. If a
  local cop in New York or Los Angeles brutalizes someone in the course of an
  arrest, they can be arrested by either state or local police, and accountable
  to a state court and a prosecutor elected by local voters. Uniquely in the US,
  a serious felony in Washington DC is prosecuted not by the elected attorney
  general for the district, but by a federal prosecutor appointed by the
  president – Jeanne Pirro, TV judge turned US attorney for the District of
  Columbia. And a crime prosecuted in that federal court can be pardoned by the
  president, as we saw with the convictions of rioters from the January 6
  insurrection. “This is ultimately a problem of DC not having statehood,” said
  Monica Hopkins, executive director of the ACLU of Washington DC. The city
  council passes laws covering the district and the mayor controls the police
  force, but the president can declare an emergency that gives him control for
  30 days, she said. “He is acting under a pretextual emergency and extending
  the sort of blatant abuse of power over DC in a way that he could not do in
  any other jurisdiction as of right now.” Local organizations said they view
  Trump’s declaration as yet another reason to call for statehood. “Statehood is
  the only path to real accountability and local control. Without it, the
  current administration will continue to treat us as powerless and deploy power
  over us,” said Clinique Chapman, CEO of the DC Justice Lab. “This latest
  overreach mirrors nationwide efforts to disempower Black-led cities, elected
  officials and prosecutors, while leaving federal agencies, unaccountable to
  our residents, in control of our justice system.” Violent crime is higher in
  Washington DC than the national average. But it is not among the most violent
  large cities in the United States today, and the number of incidents have been
  falling in Washington DC for about two years. Trump cited figures during the
  press conference from 2023, while ignoring precipitous drops in most
  categories of violent crime since. Violent crime overall was at a 30-year low
  on the day Trump took office this January. Decrying local leaders who
  “demonize” and “handcuff” aggressive police, Trump issued an executive order
  in April, Strengthening And Unleashing America’s Law Enforcement To Pursue
  Criminals And Protect Innocent Citizens, calling for the federal government to
  withdraw its support for consent decrees and other federal oversight on civil
  rights and police brutality and for city to “unleash high-impact local police
  forces”. Then he went on to test out the experiment in California. Over the
  objections of California governor Gavin Newsom, Trump called in nearly 5,000
  national guard troops and to guard federal property in Los Angeles, a move
  facing a three-day hearing today for Newsom’s federal court challenge. But
  Trump has also called in the national guard in Washington DC in the past.
  Troops were present during protests against police brutality in the summer of
  2020. US park police dispersed hundreds of demonstrators in Lafayette Park in
  front of the White House during the protests using chemical irritants, rubber
  bullets, smoke bombs, flash grenades and a baton charge. The federal
  government settled an ACLU lawsuit over the dispersal of peaceful protesters
  at Lafayette Park in 2022, agreeing to policy changes that restrict park
  police from arbitrarily withdrawing demonstration permits, allowing protesters
  to leave safely and to identify themselves clearly, and modifying Secret
  Service policy to make clear that uses of force and dispersals are not
  normally justified by the unlawful conduct of some individuals in a crowd. At
  the press conference on Monday, Trump seemed to ignore that completely and
  talked about the conduct of protesters writ large as justification for police
  violence. “They’re standing and they’re screaming at them an inch away from
  their face, and then they start spitting in their face,” Trump said. “And I
  said: ‘You tell them you spit and we hit,’ and they can hit real hard … People
  are spitting in their face, and they’re not allowed to do anything, but now
  they are allowed to do whatever the hell they want.” The downward trend in
  violence in Washington is consistent with what’s being reported in other large
  cities across the country, according to statistical tracking by the Council on
  Criminal Justice. But that may not matter if the president is ignoring data in
  favor of ideology and bluster. “He made some pretty bold statements that I
  think should concern everyone in the country at that press conference,”
  Hopkins said. “DC is being done now, but he is looking at other cities, right?
  He just can move more swiftly with DC.”
