  The Trump administration is planning a pilot program to cover “miracle” weight
  loss drugs under the government health insurance systems for low-income people
  and retirees, Medicaid and Medicare, in a move aimed at tackling the US’s
  chronic obesity problem. Such a plan was previously proposed by the Biden
  administration in its final months before Donald Trump re-entered the White
  House after winning a second term in office in the 2024 election. Now the
  Trump administration intends a five-year experiment in which the Medicaid
  program and Medicare drug coverage plans will have the option of covering the
  cost of drugs selling under the names Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound
  for “weight management” purposes, the Washington Post reported on Friday
  morning, citing documents from the government’s Centers for Medicare &amp;
  Medicaid Services (CMS). This type of medication, known as GLP-1 drugs and
  originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes, have gained popularity for
  their ability to reduce body weight by suppressing appetite and slowing
  digestion. But their high cost, typically between $5,000 and $7,000 a year,
  has raised concerns about long-term affordability and such a plan now under
  consideration by Donald Trump would come at a hefty cost to the public purse.
  Insurance coverage for such drugs is currently typically approved when
  patients have other conditions that are often tied to obesity, such as
  diabetes, heart disease and cancer. The new proposed plan would permit state
  Medicaid programs and Medicare Part D insurance plans to voluntarily cover
  GLP-1 drugs, including those from the market leaders Novo Nordisk and Eli
  Lilly, the report said. Lilly and Novo are leaders in the weight-loss drug
  market, which some analysts expect could bring in more than $150bn in revenue
  by the next decade. Lilly’s shares were up nearly 2% in premarket trading on
  Friday. The initiative is slated to begin in April 2026 for Medicaid and
  January 2027 for Medicare. If it clears the way, it would mark a shift in
  federal policy after the administration said earlier this year that the
  programs would not cover weight loss drugs. The Centers for Medicare &amp;
  Medicaid Services, Lilly and Novo did not respond to Reuters’ request for
  comment. The plan could expose division between CMS head Mehmet Oz, who has
  previously praised such drugs, and health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, who
  has criticized their high cost and how they are not a substitute for a healthy
  lifestyle.
