  crashes shortly after takeoff

  The spaceship hovered for less than a minute before crashing in a giant plume
  of smoke, but it was history-making nonetheless – the attempted launch of an
  orbital rocket designed and made in Australia. The Eris rocket was built by
  Gold Coast-based Gilmour Space and briefly blasted off from the Bowen orbital
  spaceport in north Queensland on Wednesday morning, after months of waiting
  for the right conditions. The orbit attempt was watched on from the
  surrounding hills by enthusiasts and streamed live by the likes of YouTuber
  Josh Keegan, also known as Aussienaut. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “OK
  we’re going, we’re going, it’s going!” Keegan said with breathless excitement
  after a second day of patient watching – but the celebrations did not last
  long. “It’s gone, it’s gone,” Keegan said seconds later. “Oh no, it didn’t go,
  there wasn’t sufficient thrust to actually keep it up. “I believe that’s the
  end of the Eris rocket. We have a cloud, and that’s the end.” But while the
  billow of smoke may have marked the end of Eris, Gilmour and the nascent
  Australian space industry hope this failed orbit attempt will prove just a
  beginning. Gilmour Space issued a statement shortly afterwards saying Eris’s
  14 seconds of flight brought Australia closer to the club of six nations who
  regularly launch spacecraft to orbit. “For a maiden test flight, especially
  after an extended 18-month wait on the pad for final approvals, this is a
  strong result and a major step forward for Australia’s sovereign space
  capability,” the statement read. “Most importantly, the team is safe and
  energised for Test Flight 2.” The company’s CEO, Adam Gilmour, posted on
  social media that he was happy with the launch attempt. “Got off the Pad, I am
  happy,” he wrote. “Of course I would have liked more flight time but happy
  with this.” The 23-metre-long, 30-tonne rocket was covered in sensors from
  which the Queensland company will hope to glean information to assist future
  launch attempts. One Giant Leap Australia Foundation, which develops education
  programs geared toward growing a future workforce in the space industry, was
  among those to congratulate Gilmour Space for a “sterling effort”. “The only
  way to learn is to fail forward,” it posted on social media. “We know more
  today than we did yesterday.” Gilmour Space was poised to launch on Tuesday
  but winds were too strong. It had also sought to launch in May but did not.
  The company received $5m from the Australian government for its Eris launch
  vehicle last week to develop its next-generation liquid rocket engine.
