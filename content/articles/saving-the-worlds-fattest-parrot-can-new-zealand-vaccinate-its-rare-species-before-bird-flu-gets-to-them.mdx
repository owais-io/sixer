  before bird flu gets to them?

  It is easy to imagine how it could happen. A petrel, flying east from the
  Indian Ocean at the end of the Austral winter, makes landfall at New Zealand’s
  southern Codfish Island/Whenua Hou. Tired from its long journey, the petrel
  seeks refuge in the burrow of a green kākāpō: a critically endangered
  flightless species that is the world’s fattest parrot. If the seabird intrudes
  when the kākāpō is primed to breed, the male parrot may attempt to mate with
  the smaller petrel, accidentally smothering it in the process. In this case,
  there are two unwitting victims. The petrel harbours a deadly agent: H5 avian
  influenza. Soon after, bird flu begins to rip through the imperilled parrot
  population, pushing the waddling bird – which numbers fewer than 250
  individuals – to extinction. This is the kind of scenario that New Zealand’s
  conservationists are considering before the arrival of the spring migration
  season – as they have done for the past two years since a highly pathogenic
  strain of bird flu known as H5N1 began burning through global wildlife,
  spurring the largest sudden drop in the world’s bird population in decades.
  Tens of millions of wild birds have succumbed to H5 worldwide, but so far
  Oceania has managed to keep the virus out – buying time for New Zealand to add
  another weapon to its arsenal before thousands of birds arrive from distant
  shores. In August, the country’s Department of Conservation announced the
  completion of a world-first research trial showing that some of its rarest
  birds could be successfully and safely vaccinated against bird flu. The effort
  is the latest in a global push to protect wildlife – not just farmed poultry –
  from the virus, which has also inflicted dramatic mass deaths among elephant
  seal, fur seal and seabird populations across the world. For those species
  already teetering on the brink of extinction, vaccination could be a
  gamechanger. New Zealand is home to nearly 100 bird species found nowhere else
  in the world. Over the past year, the department has vaccinated up to 10
  captive birds from five critically endangered species that have 500 or fewer
  individuals left – the kākāpō, takahē, kakī (black stilt), tūturuatu (shore
  plover) and one type of kākāriki. The programme, using the H5N3 poultry
  vaccine, is the first to vaccinate so many species at the same time. After
  receiving two doses, a month apart, of the licensed poultry vaccine,
  scientists found that four species had built up a strong antibody response to
  the virus that lasted for at least six months. “These species are dependent on
  captive breeding,” says Kate McInnes, a wildlife veterinarian and the
  department’s senior science adviser. Vaccination, she says, could protect core
  breeding populations in aviaries used for restocking wild populations on the
  knife-edge of survival, as well as managed kākāpō populations on offshore
  islands. The next step is building a deployment strategy before spring
  migration, when travelling seabirds could introduce the virus. “You can’t just
  run around the forest and catch everything and jab it,” McInnes says. “You’ve
  got to have a really carefully planned programme in place.” Other countries
  are watching the attempt closely. Australia is in close contact with officials
  in New Zealand about the vaccine results, and is running its own trials using
  stand-in species – animals similar to the critically endangered species but
  not endangered themselves – according to Fiona Fraser, Australia’s
  commissioner for threatened species. “There is increasing concern now that the
  migratory bird season is just on our doorstep,” she says. Tens of millions of
  birds are expected to arrive in Australia in the coming weeks. The Australian
  government last year announced it would allocate A$100m (£48m) to prepare for
  bird flu, including A$2.8m specifically to protect captive populations of
  threatened species. “Having that extra time for our region to understand what
  the overseas impacts have been, and to get better prepared for Australian
  species, has been enormously important,” says Fraser. “We expect it’s not a
  matter of if, but when bird flu arrives in Australia. Because now that it is
  circulating in Antarctica, we are essentially surrounded.” Vaccination, she
  says, makes up only a small part of the strategy. The country is focused on
  planning for species considered particularly vulnerable to avian influenza,
  such as the native Australian sea lion and Tasmanian devil, an endangered
  scavenger that could feed on the carcasses of infected birds. Boosting the
  overall health of wild populations to help them withstand the eventual arrival
  of avian influenza is the priority, she says. “Vaccinations can be stressful
  for wild animals and it cannot be as feasible as taking other measures such as
  improving their habitat,” Fraser says. Australia’s policy on vaccination
  echoes the broader global view. Jabbing animals for conservation purposes is
  rare, although some programmes have been established to immunise koalas
  against chlamydia; vaccinate Ethiopian wolves against canine distemper; and
  develop a West Nile vaccine to protect endangered birds in Hawaii. The World
  Organisation for Animal Health noted in a 2023 committee report on the
  emergency vaccination of wild birds that it would be difficult to vaccinate
  wild populations against avian influenza with the currently available
  strategies. “There are so many logistics that come into play,” says Krysten
  Schuler, a wildlife disease ecologist at Cornell University in New York state.
  Capturing and recapturing wild animals for multiple doses is difficult and
  expensive, especially for species that have short lifespans. Nevertheless,
  when 21 California condors died from H5 avian influenza in 2023, the US
  government raced to intervene. About $20m (£15m) in federal and state funding
  has been spent on conserving the critically endangered vulture to date, making
  it one of the most costly US conservation projects in history. Scientists
  first conducted trials of an H5N1 poultry vaccine on 20 black vultures and 20
  captive condors. “We knew that this was going to have some international
  relevance – people were going to be watching it,” says Todd Katzner, a US
  Geological Survey wildlife biologist and research coordinator for the Condor
  Recovery Program. “It was the first controlled trial with a wild species.”
  After finding that the vaccine yielded a successful antibody response with no
  harmful effects, the government approved an emergency vaccination campaign. By
  October 2024, they had inoculated 207 condors, including 134 “free-flying”
  birds. An additional challenge, Katzner says, is that the trial vaccine used
  to jab the condors was based on a 2014 strain of avian influenza. “When they
  build human vaccines, there’s a huge economic driver to encourage them to stay
  up to date,” he says. “There is not a similar driver for bird flu vaccines, so
  you end up with vaccines that are out of date.” Viruses evolve over time,
  meaning vaccines can be rendered less useful as the virus changes. Still, “the
  general sentiment was that a vaccinated bird will have better protection than
  an unvaccinated bird”, Katzner says. Some scientists express reservations
  about jabbing wild animals. Viruses, they say, can quickly develop even more
  potent strains. “A big concern with wildlife is incomplete vaccination that
  would actually lead to more viral evolution,” says Schuler. “Especially for a
  lot of these birds, they might be exposed to multiple avian influenza viruses.
  So by inserting a vaccination process in there, does it actually have the
  potential to sort out the ones that are more pathogenic – the ones that could
  be worse?” New Zealand’s wildlife authorities plan to vaccinate its captive
  breeding populations of critically endangered bird species, as well as their
  offspring introduced to the wild, pending regulatory approval of emergency use
  of the vaccine. The timing of the programme depends on assessments of when the
  virus is likely to reach the country’s shores. “If we start too soon, we’re
  going to lose that antibody because it will start to disappear,” McInnes says.
  “But if we start too late, we might have missed the crucial moment.”
