  President Donald Trump has threatened to deploy the National Guard to Chicago,
  New York, Seattle, Baltimore, San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, to fight
  what he says is runaway crime. Yet data shows most violent crime in those
  places and around the country has declined in recent years. Homicides through
  the first six months of 2025 were down significantly compared to the same
  period in 2024, continuing a post-pandemic trend across the US, AP reports.
  Trump, who has already taken federal control of police in Washington, DC, has
  maligned the six Democratic-run cities that all are in states that opposed him
  in 2024. But he hasn’t threatened sending in the Guard to any major cities in
  Republican-leaning states. John Roman, a data expert who directs the Center on
  Public Safety &amp; Justice at the University of Chicago, acknowledged
  violence in some urban neighborhoods has persisted for generations. But he
  said there’s no US city where there “is really a crisis.” “We’re at a
  remarkable moment in crime in the United States,” he said. Senator Roger
  Wicker, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee and one of the strongest
  advocates for Taiwan in the US Congress, arrived in Taipei on Friday to
  discuss security as China ratchets up its military pressure on the island.
  Wicker, a Republican, said he and Senator Deb Fischer were visiting to
  reinforce the “great partnership” the United States and Taiwan had and would
  have in the future, Reuters reports. Fischer is also a Republican and a member
  of the Armed Services Committee. “We’re here to talk to our friends and allies
  in Taiwan about what we’re doing to enhance worldwide peace, the kind of peace
  through strength that Ronald Reagan talked about,” he told reporters at
  Taipei’s downtown Songshan airport, referring to the late US president. “We
  stand here to re-emphasise the partnership and the security friendship
  agreement that the United States has had with Taiwan for some decades.” The US
  Senate is due to consider next week the National Defense Authorization act, or
  NDAA, a nearly $1 trillion bill that sets policy for the Pentagon. Wicker said
  that this year’s NDAA would “add to the provisions again” when it came to
  Taiwan, though he gave no details. The White House has chosen a top aide to
  health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr to temporarily lead the Centers for
  Disease Control and Prevention – an appointment that is expected to bolster
  Kennedy’s goals of remaking federal vaccine policy. Jim O’Neill, a biotech
  investor and speechwriter for the health department during the George W Bush
  administration, was tapped as acting director of the agency that oversees
  vaccine recommendations, a White House official confirmed to the Guardian.
  O’Neill, unlike Monarez, has no training in medicine or infectious disease
  science. He is a former speechwriter for the health department, during the
  Bush years, who went on to work for the tech investor and conservative
  megadonor Peter Thiel. But who is O’Neill and what does he want to do at the
  CDC? Read our full explainer here: Senior CDC vaccine research and public
  health leaders who resigned in protest told hundreds of supporters across the
  street from the campus on Thursday that the Trump administration needs to “get
  politics out of public health”. The agency is reeling from the firing of the
  CDC chief, Susan Monarez, but Monarez, who was confirmed as CDC chief just a
  month ago, has refused to be removed. Three senior leaders – Debra Houry,
  Demetre Daskalakis and Daniel Jernigan – resigned shortly after in protest,
  citing the alleged spread of misinformation under the Trump administration and
  political interference in their work. The staffers cheered and applauded them
  at the event on Thursday. “You are the people that protect America, and
  America needs to see that you are the people that protect America, and we are
  going to be your loudest advocates,” said Daskalakis to the throng.
  Daskalakis, who was accompanied at the rally by Houry and Jernigan, is now the
  former director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory
  Diseases and is known for his leadership in HIV prevention and vaccination
  programs and the Biden administration’s response to the mpox outbreak. The
  three, plus Jennifer Leyden, who led the office of public health data,
  resigned together on Thursday to make a statement about the damage the
  administration had done to public vaccine research, and in protest of the
  administration’s response to vaccine disinformation, they said. “We agreed to
  do this together. We’ve been talking about it for months, and the past few
  days, it was just escalating,” said Houry, the CDC’s former chief medical
  officer. “If one of us retired, it would have been a blip. When the three of
  us do it together, it’s more powerful and just shows the state of our agency.”
  She and the others are asking for Congress to intervene, to put a stop to
  political interference in the organization’s work. The chaos at the CDC is far
  from the president’s only battleground todat. Later on, Donald Trump’s battle
  to exert control over the Federal Reserve faces a key legal test, with a
  governor of the central bank seeking a temporary block on his extraordinary
  attempt to fire her. Lisa Cook sued the US president on Thursday, with her
  lawyers describing his attempt to dismiss her as “unprecedented and illegal”,
  and based on “pretextual” allegations. The case is widely expected to be
  ultimately decided by the supreme court. While it makes it way through the
  courts, Cook is seeking a temporary restraining order against Trump’s attempt
  to “immediately” dismiss her from the Fed’s board. A hearing on the motion is
  set for 10am in Washington on Friday. The case has been assigned to US
  district judge Jia Cobb, an appointee of Joe Biden. Trump wrote to Cook on
  Monday, telling her that he was removing her from her position “effective
  immediately”, based on the allegation from one of his allies that she had
  obtained a mortgage on a second home she incorrectly described as her primary
  residence. The president has spent months attacking the Fed, where most
  policymakers – including Cook – have so far defied his calls for interest rate
  cuts. He has spoken of rapidly building “a majority” on the central bank’s
  board, calling into question the future of its longstanding independence from
  political oversight. Read the full report here: Hello and welcome to the US
  politics live blog. My name is Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you the
  latest news lines over the next few hours. We begin with news that the White
  House has chosen a deputy of Robert F Kennedy Jr to serve as the acting head
  of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a decision that
  comes as the standoff over the firing of director Susan Monarez has deepened,
  with Monarez’s lawyers claiming she will not depart unless Donald Trump
  himself removes her. A White House official confirmed to the Guardian that Jim
  O’Neill, currently the deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human
  Services (HHS), had been selected to temporarily lead the public health
  agency, giving Kennedy an ally in his efforts to overhaul US vaccine policy.
  Unlike Monarez, O’Neill, a former investment executive, does not have a
  medical or scientific background. He served as a former speechwriter for the
  health department during the George W Bush administration, and went on to work
  for the tech investor and conservative megadonor Peter Thiel. Senator Bill
  Cassidy, chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee,
  called on the department’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)
  to indefinitely postpone its upcoming 18 September meeting. He said: Serious
  allegations have been made about the meeting agenda, membership and lack of
  scientific process being followed for the now announced September ACIP
  meeting. Meanwhile, senator Susan Collins said she was “alarmed” by Monarez’s
  firing, adding: Susan Monarez is a highly capable scientist who brought a
  wealth of experience to the agency. While I recognize that the CDC director
  serves at the pleasure of the president, I am alarmed that she has been fired
  after only three weeks on the job. Last night I talked with former director
  Monarez about her removal. I agree with chairman Bill Cassidy, who heads the
  Senate committee with jurisdiction over the CDC, that this matter warrants
  congressional oversight. It came as senior CDC vaccine research and public
  health leaders who resigned in protest told hundreds of supporters across the
  street from the campus on Thursday that the Trump administration needs to “get
  politics out of public health”. In other developments: The president is
  gravely serious about running for a third term in violation of the US
  constitution, California governor Gavin Newsom said on Wednesday, warning
  Americans to “wake up” to what he described as Trump’s flagrant disregard for
  democratic norms. “I don’t think Donald Trump wants another election,” Newsom,
  a Democrat, said during a live interview at a summit hosted by Politico in
  Sacramento. “This guy doesn’t believe in free, fair elections.” The White
  House has requested that a US military base on the outskirts of Chicago assist
  with immigration operations as the Trump administration plans a broader
  takeover of Democratic-run “sanctuary cities”. On Thursday, the Naval Station
  Great Lakes confirmed that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had
  reached out for assistance, telling the Associated Press that the DHS had
  requested “limited support in the form of facilities, infrastructure and other
  logistical needs to support DHS operations”. The air force will provide
  military funeral honors to Ashli Babbitt, the rioter fatally shot during the
  January 6 Capitol attack, marking another step in Donald Trump’s aggressive
  rehabilitation of the attack. A Washington senator has called for the Trump
  administration to provide “immediate answers” about reports that two
  firefighters were detained by border agents as they were responding to a
  wildfire in the state. Seven people have arrived in Rwanda as part of a deal
  to accept deportees from the US, the Rwandan government has said. The Trump
  administration has been negotiating arrangements to send people to third
  countries including South Sudan and Eswatini, formerly Swaziland, as part of
  its wider deportation drive. The family of 18-year-old Benjamin Guerrero-Cruz
  was shocked when they found out that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement
  (Ice) had discreetly moved him out of California, according to California
  congresswoman Luz Rivas, who spoke with his relatives and reviewed federal
  detention records.
