  California governor Gavin Newsom on Thursday signed a sweeping redistricting
  proposal aimed at redrawing the state’s congressional boundaries to create
  five new Democratic US House seats – a direct response to the gerrymandered
  maps Republicans in Texas are advancing at the behest of Donald Trump. The
  Democratic-controlled state legislature voted to advance a legislative package
  revising California’s maps after hours of debate. With Newsom’s signature, the
  measure now heads to voters in a special election this November. Newsom, who
  led the redistricting push, said California was “neutralizing” Texas’s maps
  designed to help Republicans stave off losses in next year’s congressional
  midterm elections. “They fired the first shot in Texas,” the governor said,
  surrounded by Democratic lawmakers at a signing ceremony on Thursday
  afternoon. “When all things are equal, [when] we’re all playing by the same
  set of rules, there’s no question that the Republican party will be the
  minority party in the House of Representatives next year.” The nation’s two
  most populous – and ideologically opposed – states were racing on parallel
  tracks toward consequential redistricting votes, potentially within hours of
  each other. As Democrats in Sacramento signed off on a legislative package
  that would put their “election rigging response act” before voters in a
  special election this fall, Republicans in Austin were nearing a final vote on
  their own partisan map. “We will not let our political system be hijacked by
  authoritarianism. And today, we give every Californian the power to say no,”
  said assembly speaker Robert Rivas, a California Democrat, in remarks before
  the vote. “To say no to Donald Trump’s power grab and yes to our people, to
  our state and to our democracy.” In California, Democratic state lawmakers
  faced a Friday deadline to give the secretary of state’s office enough time to
  place the amendment on the November ballot. Both chambers took up the package
  simultaneously on Thursday, volleying it back and forth until final approval
  was secured on all three measures: the proposed congressional map, an
  accompanying constitutional amendment and funding to run the administration of
  the special election. Democrats broke into applause on the chamber floor after
  the assembly passed the constitutional amendment. Approval by the Texas
  senate, which is expected as early as Thursday, would mark the end of a
  dramatic showdown with the state’s outnumbered Democratic lawmakers whose
  two-week boycott captured national attention and set in motion a
  coast-to-coast redistricting clash. The California plan is designed to flip as
  many as five Republican-held seats in California – the exact number of
  additional GOP seats Trump has said he is “entitled to” in Texas. “He’s trying
  to rig the election,” Newsom said of the president. “Open your eyes to what is
  going on in the United States of America in 2025.” The redistricting
  tit-for-tat is an extraordinary deviation from the norm that will determine
  the battle lines for next year’s midterm elections. Traditionally, states
  redraw congressional maps once a decade based on census data, with both the
  Texas and California maps originally intended to last through 2030. Before
  Thursday’s vote, California Republicans pleaded with their Democratic
  colleagues to oppose what they derisively called a “Gavinmander”. Some members
  disagreed with Trump’s push for partisan maps in Texas and elsewhere, but said
  Newsom’s “fight fire with fire” was harmful. “The problem when you fight fire
  with fire is you burn it all down,” James Gallagher, the state assembly
  Republican leader, said at a news conference. Initially, Democratic lawmakers
  said the changes would only take effect in response to a gerrymander by a
  Republican state – a condition that would be met when the Texas legislatures
  sends the maps to the state’s governor, Greg Abbott, for his promised
  signature. But they amended the language on Thursday to remove any reference
  to a trigger, arguing it was no longer necessary now Texas has moved ahead. A
  Texas senate committee approved the GOP plan on Thursday morning, setting up a
  vote on final passage in the chamber, which was scheduled to reconvene that
  evening. California was acting after a dramatic showdown in Austin, where
  Democratic lawmakers left the state earlier this month to delay a GOP
  redistricting plan pushed by the president. They returned only after
  California moved forward with its counterproposal. When they returned, some
  were assigned police minders and forced to sign permission slips before
  leaving the capitol. Several spent the night in the chamber in protest before
  Wednesday’s session, where Republicans pushed through a map designed
  explicitly to boost their party’s chances in 2026. California Democrats are
  moving ahead after days of contentious debate over the cost – and consequences
  – of a referendum to temporarily toss out the maps drawn by the state’s
  voter-approved independent redistricting commission. Republicans estimated
  that a special election could cost more than $230m – money they said would be
  better spent on other issues such as healthcare. On Wednesday night, the state
  supreme court declined an emergency request by Republican lawmakers seeking to
  block the Democratic plan from moving forward. Republicans have vowed to keep
  fighting it in court, and called for a federal inquiry into the proposal. The
  redistricting push has also caused angst among some Democrats and independents
  who have fought for years to combat gerrymandering. Testifying in favor of the
  changes during a hearing earlier this week, Sara Sadhwani, a political science
  professor who served as a Democratic member of the state’s independent
  redistricting commission in 2020, said the map-drawing tit-for-tat presented
  California voters with a “moral conflict”. But she argued that Democrats had
  to push back on the president’s power play. “It brings me no joy to see the
  maps that we passed fairly by the commission to be tossed aside,” she said. “I
  do believe this is a necessary step in a much bigger battle to shore up free
  and fair elections in our nation.” The California revision also drew the
  backing of former president Barack Obama and other champions of fair
  redistricting, such as his former attorney general, Eric Holder. But Newsom’s
  redistricting plan – a high-stakes gambit for the term-limited governor who
  has made no secret of his 2028 presidential ambitions – is not assured to
  succeed. It faces mounting opposition from high-profile Republicans, including
  the state’s former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has vowed to “terminate
  gerrymandering”. Early polling has been mixed. But a new survey conducted by
  Newsom’s longtime pollster David Binder found strong support for the measure
  in the heavily Democratic state, with 57% of voters backing it while 35%
  opposed it. “All of us support independent redistricting, here in California
  and in every state in this union,” said Mike McGuire, the senate president pro
  tempore, at the signing ceremony. “One thing that we do not support is
  unilateral disarmament, when the fairness of the 2026 election is being
  threatened.”
