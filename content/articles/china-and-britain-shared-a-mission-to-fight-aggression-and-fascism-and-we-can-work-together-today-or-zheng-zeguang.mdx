  This year marks the 80th anniversary of the victory in the Chinese people’s
  war of resistance against Japanese aggression and the world anti-fascist war.
  On Friday, there will be a two-minute silence at noon in the UK to honour the
  80th anniversary of VJ Day. This is a moment not only for solemn remembrance,
  but also for reflection on the enduring bonds forged in the crucible of
  history – bonds that continue to resonate in our world today. At the darkest
  hour of the second world war, China and the UK fought on different fronts but
  shared a common mission: to defend humanity against fascism and aggression.
  Millions of lives were lost, cities razed, and families torn apart. Yet in
  that darkness, courage and solidarity illuminated the way forward. The Chinese
  and British peoples stood shoulder to shoulder, united by sacrifice and a
  shared belief in freedom and justice. In Asia, Chinese forces made immense
  sacrifices to support allied efforts. In 1942, the Chinese Expeditionary Force
  marched over 1,500 gruelling kilometres through the jungles of Myanmar to
  rescue British forces trapped by Japanese troops. The campaign was costly, but
  it demonstrated China’s unwavering commitment to its allies. In Britain,
  thousands of Chinese seamen served with quiet courage in perilous convoys.
  They braved the freezing Atlantic to deliver fuel and supplies to British
  forces on the frontlines – often with little recognition and no promise of
  return. Their contribution remains a poignant chapter in our shared wartime
  history. One of the most moving examples of China-UK solidarity occurred in
  October 1942, when the Lisbon Maru, a Japanese transport vessel carrying over
  1,800 British prisoners of war, was mistakenly torpedoed by a US submarine. As
  the ship sank off the coast of Zhoushan in eastern China, local fishermen
  risked their lives, dodging volleys of Japanese gunfire, to rescue 384
  survivors from the sea. In a letter to a family member of a Lisbon Maru
  survivor, President Xi Jinping commended this act of compassion and bravery as
  powerful proof of the wartime alliance between our countries and the enduring
  friendship between our peoples. Earlier this year, the story was brought to
  life for British audiences in a documentary, The Sinking of the Lisbon Maru.
  British support for China’s resistance against Japanese aggression is equally
  etched in our collective memory. Across the UK, ordinary citizens formed aid
  organisations, held fundraisers, and sent donations to support the Chinese
  people. Among the most cherished names is George Hogg, a young man from
  Harpenden (a one-time reporter for the Manchester Guardian). He journeyed to
  China to provide schooling and shelter for displaced children, dedicating his
  youth, passion and ultimately his life to a just cause. His internationalist
  spirit remains deeply cherished by the Chinese people. These moments of
  solidarity continue to inspire our relations today. Both China and the UK are
  permanent members of the UN security council, sharing a responsibility to
  uphold international peace and security. The UK was the first major western
  country to recognise the People’s Republic of China. Since we established full
  diplomatic ties in 1972, our people-to-people exchanges have flourished. In
  2024, over 1.2m mutual visits were made. More than 200,000 Chinese students
  are studying in the UK, while over 50,000 British students have visited China
  for study programmes – long or short – over the past decade. Just last month,
  nearly 1,200 students from 61 UK secondary schools visited China on an
  exchange programme – experiencing first-hand a millennia-old culture. In both
  countries, there is growing enthusiasm for more dialogue and engagement. With
  concerted efforts, China-UK relations have been put back on a path of
  improvement and renewal. At a time of global uncertainty, it is more important
  than ever to reaffirm our commitment to partnership. That means treating each
  other with mutual respect, managing differences properly, and responding to
  the aspirations of our peoples. It also means we need to deliver the outcomes
  of bilateral mechanisms such as the strategic dialogue, economic and financial
  dialogue, and energy dialogue, and also eliminate distractions, expand
  channels of communication, and strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation.
  Just as vital is our joint responsibility to safeguard the hard-won outcomes
  of the second world war and to uphold true multilateralism and an open global
  trading system. By working more closely to address global challenges like
  climate change and promote political solutions to regional hotspot issues,
  China and the UK can help inject new momentum into global peace and
  development. History has shown what China and the UK can achieve when we stand
  together. As we commemorate this historic anniversary, China is ready to work
  with the UK to carry forward the legacy of those who came before us. Let us
  honour the past not with nostalgia, but with action, telling the stories of
  courage and friendship that inspire new generations. Let us build a future
  where peace and prosperity prevail. The torch of friendship and solidarity,
  lit eight decades ago, must now light the way forward – for our two countries,
  for our peoples and for the world at large. Zheng Zeguang is Chinese
