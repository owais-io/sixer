  The US House of Representatives oversight committee on Tuesday released
  thousands of pages of records related to the disgraced financier and convicted
  sex offender Jeffrey Epstein from the department of justice. The release comes
  as the Trump administration has been embroiled in months of controversy over
  its decision not to release additional files in the case. Epstein died by
  suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges and was
  alleged to have abused hundreds of girls. The 33,000 pages included years-old
  court filings related to Epstein and his former girlfriend and associate
  Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as what appears to be bodycam footage from police
  searches and police interviews. The files appear to contain information that
  is already public knowledge. The records were posted online as the Trump
  administration was facing renewed attention on the investigation into Epstein.
  With Congress back in session this week, Democratic and Republican
  representatives had planned to hold press conferences to demand greater
  transparency from the administration in the case. Donald Trump, a longtime
  friend of Epstein and part of his rich and powerful social circle, has, in
  recent weeks, tried to avoid the subject. Earlier this year he sued the Wall
  Street Journal for its reporting on his relationship with Epstein on a
  birthday note Trump was alleged to have written to him. The president has
  called the recent Epstein controversy a hoax. The White House has urged
  Republican lawmakers not to support a discharge petition from Thomas Massie, a
  Kentucky Republican, and Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, which would force
  the release of all of the Epstein files. James Comer, the Republican chair of
  the committee, said there was no need for the discharge petition since the
  committee had subpoenaed the records. The question of how many of the files
  will be released by the committee remains unanswered. Mike Johnson, the
  Republican House speaker, said the petition was “moot” because of the release.
  “It’s superfluous at this point, and I think we’re achieving the desired end
  here,” he said. Johnson was among a bipartisan group of lawmakers who met with
  survivors of abuse by Epstein and Maxwell. The Trump administration has faced
  intense criticism, even from its fervent supporters, over its decision not to
  release additional files related to Epstein. A Reuters/Ipsos poll from July
  found that most Americans and the majority of Republicans believe the
  government is hiding details about the case. Most of the documents released
  this week were already public, including records from the 2005 investigation
  into Epstein which contained a notation indicating the inquiry had been
  released previously in a 2017 public records request. The files include a
  recording of a police interview of an Epstein employee who told law
  enforcement “there were a lot of girls that were very, very young” visiting
  Epstein’s Florida home but said he couldn’t say for sure if they were minors.
  The release appears to have done little to alleviate the controversy. Robert
  Garcia, the top Democratic representative on the House oversight committee,
  chided Republicans for releasing material that he said was almost entirely
  already available information. “The 33,000 pages of Epstein documents James
  Comer has decided to ‘release’ were already mostly public information. To the
  American people – don’t let this fool you,” Garcia said in a statement.
