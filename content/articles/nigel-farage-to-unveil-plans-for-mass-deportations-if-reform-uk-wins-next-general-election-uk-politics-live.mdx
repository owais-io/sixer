  The Guardian’s deputy political editor, Jessica Elgot, is reporting that
  ministers are planning to launch a mass communications campaign to people
  waiting in camps in northern France to warn them that they risk being deported
  back to France, though opposition parties have claimed the numbers will be
  roughly one in 17 of those crossing the Channel. Here is an extract from her
  story: A government source said: “Detentions of those arriving from France
  have been taking place over the last 24 hours, so these three small boat
  migrants may end up finding themselves being bussed to a detention centre
  before the day is out. “We are shortly launching a big communications campaign
  right along the northern French coast, warning those in camps that if they
  travel they will be returned to France and that the money they have paid to
  criminal smuggling gangs will have been wasted.” The source denied that
  potential asylum seekers needed a fixed address to make the claim for a safe
  route and said all of those who applied received communication from the Home
  Office. Many people making the dangerous journey across the Channel are trying
  to escape rapid climate change, famine, oppressive governments and war across
  Africa, Asia and the Middle East but the reasons motivating their migration
  are rarely featured in political commentary, much of which is demonising and
  dehumanising. If you are looking for some more context, the Guardian’s home
  affairs editor, Rajeev Syal, has this explainer on what other factors are
  behind the rise in Channel crossings. Housing minister Matthew Pennycook has
  confirmed that the first small boats arrivals have been detained to send back
  to France under the one in, one out migrant deal. Here are some of the quotes
  he gave to Times Radio presenter Rosie Wright when asked how much more
  capacity there is in the system to detain more people who have crossed the
  Channel: Pennycook said: Well, there is capacity in the system. But as you
  know, the pressures that we have in the debate about hotel use and other forms
  of contingency accommodation. But that contingency accommodation, including
  hotels, including large scale government owned sites … for example, Napier
  Barracks in Kent, are there. The housing minister was then asked how confident
  the one in one out scheme is sufficient to deter migrants from crossing the
  Channel. Well, it’s early days in terms of this pilot scheme getting up and
  running. We are confident that as part of a wider comprehensive plan, it will
  act as a deterrent. But don’t forget, the key elements of our strategy are not
  yet enforced. Our borders bill, which will give law enforcement new counter
  terror style powers to tackle the gangs who are running this vile trade that’s
  still going through parliament. French authorities are still reviewing their
  laws so that border enforcement teams on their side of the Channel can
  intervene in shallow waters. So taken as a whole, yes, the package, we are
  confident will work. It won’t be a quick, overnight fix, but we’re taking the
  unglamorous, hard headed, practical steps needed to clamp down on this crisis.
  In contrast, I have to say to parties trying to hoodwink the British public
  with unworkable gimmicks. Under the growing pressure from Reform and internal
  pressure from some Labour MPs, Keir Starmer has made tackling illegal
  immigration and “restoring order” to the asylum system a key political
  priority. The number of people who have crossed the Channel on small boats
  since Labour took office last summer has recently exceeded 50,000, a milestone
  that Starmer did not want to reach so quickly. Under a new “one in, one out”
  pilot scheme set up between the British and French governments over the
  summer, France will accept the return of undocumented people arriving in
  Britain by small boats, in exchange for Britain agreeing to accept an equal
  number of legitimate asylum seekers with British family connections. More than
  100 asylum seekers have now been detained for deportation to France, the Times
  is reporting. The outlet says there are dozens of migrants in detention,
  including some arrested over the bank holiday weekend. A government source
  told the Times: Detentions of those arriving from France have been taking
  place over the last 24 hours, so these small boat migrants may end up finding
  themselves being bussed to a detention centre before the day is out. Good
  morning and welcome to our live coverage of UK politics. Nigel Farage will
  outline Reform’s plans to tackle small boats crossings this morning, setting
  out his party’s stall for government if it wins the next general election,
  expected in 2029. The Reform party leader has claimed that his plans will lead
  to the “mass deportation” of hundreds of thousands of migrants and will
  prevent anyone entering illegally from ever being able to claim asylum. A
  central tenant of Farage’s platform is disapplying swathes of international
  law to make removals easier. How tenable these plans are remains to be seen as
  the party would likely face many legal obstacles. Reform is promising to leave
  the European court of human rights (ECHR), repeal the Human Rights Act and
  disapply international treaties like the Refugee Convention. Writing in the
  Telegraph, Farage said: No longer will these malign influences be allowed to
  frustrate deportations. The planes will take off, and plenty of them at that.
  The time has come to put this country first. This is all a question of
  priorities. Is Keir Starmer on the side of the British people, national
  security and protecting women and girls – or is he on the side of outdated
  international treaties and human rights lawyers? Reform only have four MPs but
  have had an outsized impact on Labour’s stance on illegal migration, pushing
  them to adopt ever more right-wing positions and intensify its rhetoric on the
  issue. The government has set out its plan to close asylum hotels by the end
  of the parliament and the UK’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, announced a “one
  in, one out” returns deal with France last month. But there is a rising
  political urgency around the issue as Reform continues to lead polls and
  asylum hotel demonstrations spread across the country. Speaking to BBC
  Breakfast this morning, Zia Yusuf, head of Reform’s government efficiency
  department, insisted it is possible to remove all illegal immigrants from the
  UK despite Farage having previously called it a “political impossibility”.
  “(Nigel Farage) said it was a political impossibility. His view on that
  clearly has decisively changed because of the facts on the ground and the fact
  that we’ve now done the work that this not only can be done, it must be done,”
  he said. “The social contract in this country is hanging by a thread.” Yusuf
  said Reform UK would set up a new agency called the “deportation command” and
  that under the plans those who have entered the UK illegal would be detained
  and “not be allowed to roam around inside the community”. He added: And this
  is a temporary programme, so regardless where they are, regardless of the
  accommodation, they will be gone at the end of Nigel’s first term.
