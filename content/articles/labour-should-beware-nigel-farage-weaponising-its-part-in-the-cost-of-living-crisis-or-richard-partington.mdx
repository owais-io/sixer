  “These prices are disgusting” is the common retort from shoppers browsing the
  supermarket shelves. To say that the cost of everything from a pint of milk to
  a loaf of bread has changed beyond recognition in only a few years is an
  understatement. But it could still get worse. The warning from the Bank of
  England last week that food prices are stirring the inflation beast that has
  stalked Britain for the past four years shows that the cost of living crisis
  is far from over. The headline rate of inflation is expected to hit 4% by
  September, in a reawakening fed by the soaring cost of things such as butter,
  chocolate and beef. Keeping inflation in check is a high-stakes job.
  Successive governments have foundered on the promise of putting more money in
  people’s pockets, only for voters to find that their hard-earned cash barely
  covers the rising cost of bills, food and other essentials. For Rishi Sunak,
  it was clearly a mistake to gamble the last election on a bet that a halving
  in the headline rate of inflation would help households forget the previous 14
  years of pain. Real living standards went backwards in the Tory years. For
  Keir Starmer, the same could be true if the change Labour promised does not
  begin to materialise soon. Last week, the prime minister used the promise of
  putting more pounds in your pocket to deflect rumours of an autumn budget
  laden with tax increases. “The focus [at the budget] will very much be on
  living standards and making sure people feel better off,” he said. However,
  Threadneedle Street’s dire forecasts showed Labour has added to the problems
  of high inflation, as food producers and retailers pass on the higher costs of
  employment triggered by Rachel Reeves’s £25bn increase in employer national
  insurance contributions. Despite a global rise in food price inflation, the
  Bank warned that Britain was still an outlier, with an annual rate 1.5% higher
  than in the euro area. “Higher labour costs are contributing to food price
  inflation in the UK,” it added. For the government, this is worrying stuff.
  Particularly as inflation driven by rising food prices is felt most by the
  poorest households in society – at a time when Labour has a job to prove that
  tackling poverty remains a top priority. Food price inflation hits those on
  low incomes most because they spend disproportionately more of their monthly
  budgets on the essentials of life compared with the wealthiest, who have more
  room to cut discretionary spending. While the poorest fifth spend 14.4% on
  food and drink, the figure is 8.5% for the richest. For Labour’s political
  opponents, and for Nigel Farage and Reform in particular, this is a gift.
  Starmer actively making the problems Labour sets out to fix worse, with the
  poor paying the price, is already the message Reform is using to target
  working-class voters on the doorstep. Starmer and Reeves should be mindful
  that an autumn budget that fails to acknowledge the renewed inflationary pain
  for hard-pressed households will only make defeating Farage harder. However,
  despite the bad news from the Bank last week, its grim inflation forecast also
  gave Labour evidence to show voters why Farage would have all the wrong
  answers. For some time economists have been warning that Britain is exposed to
  growing dangers from “climateflation” – when extreme weather, droughts and
  floods drive up living costs. To some, including Farage, this might sound like
  an abstract risk more likely to afflict countries far from our cold, wet
  shores. However, the Bank showed that the danger has already moved from risk
  to reality, highlighting how worsening climate conditions are adding to this
  latest inflationary burst. Its latest report showed dry weather in the UK and
  elsewhere was among the contributing factors in pumping up the price of beef
  because lower grass growth means cows must be fed silage earlier in the year,
  which is costlier. The price of coffee and cocoa has been pushed up by
  droughts in key producer countries, including Brazil, while rainfall and plant
  disease outbreaks have hit harvests in west Africa. The Bank reckons roughly
  half of current food price inflation can be linked to government tax
  increases, which will be digested and gone in time. The other half – from
  global heating – is only going to get worse. Most of the food Britain consumes
  – about 58% – is domestically produced. But international food prices still
  have a material impact. That is because many food items are globally traded
  goods, with prices determined by world markets. Erecting Brexit barriers with
  the EU – the source of 24% of food supplies – has not helped. Meanwhile, only
  33 countries worldwide account for 90% of imported supply, raising the
  fragility of the UK supply chain by concentrating the risks in certain
  countries. Throughout history climate conditions and wars have influenced the
  economy, including the Great Frost of 1709 leaving England with the worst
  recession – until the Covid pandemic – for three centuries, and the Great
  Famine forcing a quarter of Ireland’s population to emigrate in the 19th
  century. But the pace of climate change has increased dramatically – the
  result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and proceeding at a rate not
  seen in millennia. Add on top of that mounting geopolitical tensions,
  conflicts and a breakdown in global trade amid Donald Trump’s tariff war, and
  the picture is bleak. Labour can show clearly that Farage’s pledge to scrap
  net zero is more than counterproductive. Failure to limit global heating, in
  which Britain can play a leading international role, would hurt the poorest
  households most.
