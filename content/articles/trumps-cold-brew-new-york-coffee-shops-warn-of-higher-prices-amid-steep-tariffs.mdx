  tariffs

  The Trump administration has targeted Brazil with steep US tariffs of 50%.
  Coffee shops in the heart of New York are bracing for impact. When the Trump
  administration announced another wave of sweeping tariffs, particularly on
  Brazil, Stone Street Cafe’s managing partner was first confused. Then came
  fear. A cafe already runs on slim margins and extra costs passed on from
  tariffs could risk everything. “If these tariffs are long term, it will put
  our business in jeopardy,” Antony Garrigues, managing partner of Stone Street
  Cafe, said. “In New York City, the operating costs are already so high, and
  these tariffs will make everything much more expensive. “In the end, if people
  cannot afford our coffee, and we do not have a profit margin, we will not make
  it.” Stone Street Cafe, based in Manhattan, sources green coffee beans from
  more than 35 different countries, including Brazil. But Brazil is not the only
  coffee-producing nation facing tariff pressures: Vietnam, Colombia, Ethiopia
  and Indonesia are also affected. “These tariffs are not paid by the country.
  The costs are passed down to the business owner, and consumer,” noted
  Garrigues. “For now, we are going to try and absorb as much [of] the cost as
  we can. But at the end of the day, this is a business – so we may have to
  increase the prices.” With the growing effects of climate change already
  inflating coffee prices, other cafes have already done so. Aside from coffee
  Ciao Gloria, in Brooklyn, also imports cocoa powder from Brazil. Jams sourced
  from Italy now face Trump’s 15% tariff on exports from the European Union. The
  cafe raised prices by about 25 cents per cup, but plans to absorb any
  additional tariffs costs, at least for now. “I’m selling sugar and caffeine –
  I’m basically a drug dealer,” joked owner Renato Poliafito. “So I want to make
  sure the menu is affordable.” But then he turned serious. “We have to be
  vigilant about analyzing the situation before jumping to price increases.”
  Customers are already scrutinizing their receipts. US coffee prices rose 14.5%
  in the year to July, according to official data. “It’s this idea of shifting
  baseline where we normalize something being expensive when it shouldn’t [be],
  and it’s very scary to see,” said Helina Seyoum, 29, who has reverted to
  making coffee at home. “Now a morning coffee becomes a burden, because you’re
  obsessing over the costs.” A daily cafe trip was how Aley Longo, 28, made sure
  she escaped the confines of her studio apartment and spoke to people outside
  work in an “affordable” way. Now it’s strictly a weekend activity. Trump’s
  tariffs are “bad for Americans, and our quality of life”, Longo said, “and we
  are suffering, whether it’s as tiny as just being able to buy coffee out, or
  something so much bigger”. Those behind the counter know what it’s like to
  watch the price of a regular purchase grow. Allon Azulai, who owns Kos Kaffe
  in Brooklyn, which imports beans from countries including Colombia, Honduras
  and Kenya, described nervously asking vendors for their latest prices each
  week, as tariffs and mounting demand looms large. “Right now the industry is
  so unstable and what worries me if tariffs continue is cafes that do not have
  big pockets will not be able to survive,” said Azulai. ‘Straight to the
  American consumer’ As US cafes come under pressure, the coffee producers they
  source from are also preparing for disruption. Brazil is the world’s largest
  coffee producer and exporter. The US is the leading destination of its coffee:
  about a third of its coffee imports are Brazilian. The Brazilian Soluble
  Coffee Industry Association, which represents producers, said the 50% US
  tariff on the country’s exports amounted to a “clear competitive disadvantage”
  as other leading countries for coffee production face lower rates, ranging
  from 10% to 27%. “This decision not only harms the Brazilian industry but
  could also negatively affect American consumers, who benefit from the quality
  and competitive price of our coffee,” the association said. Brazilian
  producers and exporters still hope they can lobby for coffee to be exempt from
  US tariffs, arguing the US produces very little coffee domestically. The US
  commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, had previously suggested products not
  cultivated on American soil could be granted zero tariffs, they note. If that
  fails Brazil’s Coffee Exporters Council says it will at least seek to reduce
  the tariff on coffee to 10%, in line with other Brazilian goods, including
  oil, orange juice and aircraft. “We remain optimistic and hopeful,” the
  council said. New coffee export deals with the US are on hold and shipments
  ready to go are stuck in storage, adding costs for exporters. China has
  meanwhile approved 183 new Brazilian firms to export coffee, although the
  exporters’ council cautioned that sales may take time to materialize. In
  Vietnam and Colombia – the world’s second and third largest coffee-producing
  nations, respectively – exporters hope that lower US tariffs on their coffee
  will help them steal a march on Brazil. “The US can’t grow coffee at scale, so
  tariffs won’t bring production back home,” Timen Swijtink, founder of Lacàph
  Coffees in Vietnam, said. “With the tiny margins in our industry, any tariff
  cost goes straight to the American consumer.” Even with 20% US tariffs on
  Vietnam, the country’s farmers “are resilient and will find new markets”,
  added Swijtink, “with global demand strong and China’s demand growing like a
  rocket ship”. With the US tariff on Colombia only at the baseline 10%, small
  coffee growers across the country are shrugging off any immediate impacts.
  “The average coffee farmer won’t feel it, at least for now,” said José David
  Posada, a fourth-generation coffee farmer and owner of Capilla del Rosario, a
  finca in Medellín. “It’s the exporters who will be impacted.” There is also a
  sense among some that, given Brazil’s tariffs are at 50%, Trump’s tariff war
  could even help Colombian business. The country’s coffee cultivation is vital
  to the national economy, representing 8% of total Colombian exports. Posada
  said: “The fact that Brazil has a higher tariff, obviously that’s going to
  have a positive impact on us, right?” Guilherme Morya, a coffee analyst at
  Rabobank, said the 50% tariff on Brazilian coffee may, at least in the short
  term, shift American buyers toward other sources. “Colombia gains a price
  advantage, and being the second-largest supplier, it becomes the most obvious
  candidate to fill this gap,” he said. But Alejandro Lloreda, a farmer at
  family-run Cafetal de la Trinidad, which produces specialty coffee, cautioned
  the difference would only give Colombia “a temporary advantage”. “A coffee
  tree can take two to three years to produce, and the tariff situation could
  well change before then,” he said. Back in New York, cafe owners find
  themselves in an equally uncertain position. “The tariffs are to small
  businesses’ detriment,” said Poliafito, of Ciao Gloria. “Big businesses can
  find a way around it. But we will suffer the costs.” “It’s scary to not know
  if we can continue our business,” added Nick Kim, manager of Koré Coffee in
  Manhattan. “It’s really a shame, and sad, that you know bad things are coming,
  but you cannot do anything to change it. We have no option but to see what
  will come.”
