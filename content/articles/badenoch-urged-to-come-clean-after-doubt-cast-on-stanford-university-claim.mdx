  Labour and the Liberal Democrats have called for Kemi Badenoch to come clean
  about her claims of an offer from Stanford University at the age of 16, after
  former admissions staff said she had described an impossible scenario. The
  Labour MP Peter Prinsley has written to the Conservatives leader saying she
  should lay out the specifics of how the alleged offer came about, given the
  doubts cast over her story. The Lib Dem education spokesperson, Munira Wilson,
  said Badenoch risked undermining trust. Badenoch has defended her claim to
  have received an offer as a teenager in Nigeria from the elite university to
  study medicine, sometimes described by her as pre-med, even though the
  university does not offer that course for undergraduates. Admissions staff
  have also said the Conservative leader’s assertion she was offered a place on
  exam results alone, and was offered a partial scholarship, would not have been
  possible, with no offers made on that basis. Jon Reider, the admissions
  officer during the period Badenoch applied, told the Guardian he had been
  responsible for international admissions and scholarships and had not offered
  one to Badenoch. Badenoch doubled down on Monday, telling reporters she had
  indeed received offers based on her exam results. “All I will say is that I
  remember the very day those letters came to me. It was not just from Stanford.
  I was 16, I had done very well in my SATs,” she said. “But this is 30 years
  ago, I don’t have the papers, and what the Guardian is doing is reporting on
  hearsay rather than talking about what the government is doing.” Multiple
  former admissions staff and US academics have told the Guardian that Stanford
  has never made offers based only on SATs – US standardised tests – with no
  exceptions even for royalty or child prodigies. Prinsley, a former hospital
  consultant, wrote to Badenoch to say her claims have been “called into serious
  question by people in a position to understand the situation, and I would be
  grateful if you could demonstrate that you have been telling the truth”. He
  said the Tory leader should clear up whether she had applied to Stanford and
  whether a place and financial aid had been offered. A Labour source said:
  “Honesty and integrity aren’t optional qualities for those who serve as the
  leader of His Majesty’s official opposition. The uncertainty surrounding Kemi
  Badenoch’s Stanford University claims raises important questions that the
  public deserve to know the answers to. “Badenoch needs to come clean about
  what’s happened here and whether she’s been telling the truth to the British
  people.” Wilson also wrote to Badenoch saying she should come clean. “If Kemi
  Badenoch cares about restoring trust, she should start by explaining her own
  academic record,” she said. “Failing to come clean over these allegations
  would send a message to the thousands of pupils who just received their exam
  results that their hard work does not matter and that you can just bluff your
  way to the top.”
