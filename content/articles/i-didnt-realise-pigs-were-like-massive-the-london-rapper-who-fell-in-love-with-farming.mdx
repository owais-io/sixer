  In Hood 2 Farm, a 76-year-old shepherd is explaining his daily routine.
  “There’s only my wife and I, and when she gets out of bed, I get in, and when
  I get out of bed, she gets in,” he says. The south London rapper Fekky pauses,
  before saying: “If you don’t mind me asking, if she’s getting out of bed,
  you’re getting in bed, when are you … hugging up, man?” The farmer laughs and
  replies: “It’s not happening, chap!” to Fekky’s clear horror. This kind of
  interaction is common on Hood 2 Farm, a unique and genuinely inspired YouTube
  series about the rapper’s attempt to become the steward of his own farm.
  Across eight 30-minute episodes, he meets farmers from around the UK and
  learns basics such as milking cows, shearing sheep and driving tractors. The
  resulting show wraps genuine insight about agricultural practice in the
  screwball energy of classic British comedy, thanks to Fekky’s perpetual
  fish-out-of-water spirit – he is fond of wearing a Gucci cap on the farm – and
  clear passion for nature. With some episodes netting well over 100,000 views,
  the unconventional series has been a hit, and Fekky says he plans to continue
  with future seasons. Fekky, 38, says the idea began before lockdown, when he
  went on holiday to Thailand to decompress from the pressures of life in the
  music industry. As a rapper, Fekky has played to crowds of thousands, appeared
  alongside Dizzee Rascal, collaborated with Skepta and started his own label, F
  Music, but has often talked about his struggles with alcohol use and anxiety.
  “After my long music career, I just decided to have a break – a lot of it gets
  very busy and gets wild,” he says over a video call. “I just fell in love with
  nature in Thailand.” When he got home, London was plunged into lockdown, and
  he began gardening as a way to pass the time, documenting his progress on
  social media. “I realised there were a lot of people that were engaged and
  loved seeing me doing it, I think because I was a fish out of water,” he says.
  He decided he “wanted to live in nature full time”, so he bought a plot of
  land – which he has dubbed F Manor – and decided to leave London for good,
  while continuing to post farm content. “I just said to myself that I should
  basically learn farming but show everyone that’s watching, especially the
  youth, what I’m doing – so as I’m learning, they can learn,” he says. The
  posts were a runaway success, and people began messaging him asking when his
  next piece of farm content would go live, “so it made sense for me to do a
  show about farming”. The only problem, of course, was that he “didn’t know
  nothing” about farming, and had never set foot on a farm until he bought one.
  His family back in Nigeria are farmers, he says, “so I knew it must be
  something in the family, but I had no idea”. When he decided to visit other
  farms, he was shocked by how little he knew about where our food comes from.
  “A pig farm is like … I thought pigs were small, like that” – he holds his
  hands about 10 inches apart – “I didn’t realise pigs were, like, massive,” he
  says, still astounded. “You see food on a plate, but you never think about
  where it’s coming from. The first thing I learned about having chickens was
  like … it’s weird to think you’re eating chicken … but then I love my
  chickens, if that makes sense.” You can see Fekky experiencing all this in
  real time on Hood 2 Farm, which rivals some sitcoms in its laughs-per-minute
  ratio. It’s amazing to see how game Fekky is to puncture his own tough-guy
  rapper image. In the first episode, he gets hit in the face by a cow’s tail
  while attempting to milk it, admits he previously thought a cow’s teats were
  “willies”, and asks a farmer whether milk is actually just semen – to her
  dumbstruck confusion. In Fekky’s mind, there hasn’t been a single wildest
  moment of learning to farm – the entire process has been totally shocking. “A
  cow tried to hit me!” he says. “Even sheep, I was trying to herd sheep, and it
  was just crazy – they’re going everywhere! And I never thought I would have
  10,000 bees all over me. You’re just walking straight into that craziness.
  Just being comfortable around animals was the hardest part – all the animals
  are big, and if you run into something where you don’t know what it can do,
  there’s a danger element. But it didn’t end up being dangerous, you just feel
  a bit, like, out of your depth.” The feeling of being around the animals, he
  says, isn’t so dissimilar to being on stage. “You’re stepping into the unknown
  every time,” he says. “The similarity is the adrenaline rush you get when
  performing on stage or when I’m with animals – because, like I said, it feels
  dangerous – but then after that, it’s like, it’s all right.” Since making the
  pivot to farm life, Fekky has found that his friends and family have been more
  than supportive – “a lot of my rapper friends all want to come to the farm” –
  and have been amazed to find that growing your own food can come with benefits
  on multiple levels. “When I give my eggs, which I get from my chickens, to my
  friends, they say they taste so much better than from any shop,” he says. “I
  think I’ve opened people’s eyes to eating food that you’re growing yourself.
  Something about it just tastes real.” The greatest benefit for him personally,
  he says, is on his overall mental health and wellbeing. “I think nature in
  general is very healing, and we live a very wild lifestyle as rappers; hotel
  to hotel, show to show,” he says. “Going into farming gives you the balance.
  We shouldn’t pigeonhole ourselves to one thing in our careers. After a while,
  you should start thinking about how diverse you can be, and what else can you
  do in life? Even if it’s just a hobby.” That’s the lesson he wants to impart
  to black British kids who might be watching. “I just hope the youth understand
  that where you start in life is not where you finish. You have to explore the
  world and open your thoughts. I think when we grow up, you see people like
  myself being rappers or footballers, and these are the most cliche careers
  that people think you have to go into to make it. I want you to understand
  that you can be you, you can explore, you can do farming, and you’ll be
  accepted and find happiness.” • Hood 2 Farm is on YouTube
