  We criminalise the political stunt at our peril. It is a crucial art form that

  We must ask ourselves: how would the heroic suffragettes or the remarkable
  Greenham Common women be regarded if active today? The answer is simple: they
  would be locked up. Just as they were locked up then. A century ago, women
  chained themselves to railings, set fires, endured prison and changed the
  world, and we celebrate their victories without thinking too hard about their
  methods. Yet today’s laws would criminalise them on sight. Last month, the
  home secretary, Yvette Cooper, wore a commemorative sash celebrating the
  suffragette struggle. Yet this is the same Yvette Cooper presiding over an age
  of repressive laws and mass arrests. It’s a paradox: we laud the rebels of the
  past while shackling the rebels of the present. I have been retracing these
  acts of protest for a new BBC Radio 4 documentary, Outrage Inc. I wanted to
  understand not just the anger, but the creative genius and conviction behind
  the stunt. Because at its best, a stunt isn’t chaos. It’s an art form –
  theatre with consequences. It’s designed to provoke, timed to perfection and
  impossible to ignore. Those who stage them aren’t amateurs: they storyboard,
  construct narrative, marshal resources. They are producers of disruption. Take
  the suffragettes. With their matchsticks, they weren’t vandals – they were
  master tacticians who understood the media economy of Edwardian Britain. By
  the early 1900s, papers such as the Daily Mail and Daily Express were locked
  in a circulation war, selling millions of copies at a penny each. Their
  lifeblood was advertising and their oxygen was spectacle. Respectful reports
  of speeches and petitions did not move papers off newsstands. Outrage did.
  Emmeline Pankhurst and the Women’s Social and Political Union knew this. They
  didn’t smash Bond Street windows or torch postboxes for fun. They did it
  because they knew the placards outside kiosks would scream “SUFFRAGETTE
  OUTRAGE”, forcing the issue into every parlour in Britain. Editors vilified
  them, yes, but they printed the stories, because sensation sold. That was the
  economy, and the suffragettes exploited it ruthlessly. In today’s parlance,
  they hacked the algorithm. The Greenham women weren’t eccentrics, either. They
  were moral Boudiccas who turned protest into performance art on a national
  scale. Tents, banners, singing at the wire, cutting fences, dancing on missile
  silos looked anarchic, but it was a rolling installation, a piece of theatre
  that lasted nearly a decade. Some of it was planned, some improvised, but its
  genius lay in persistence. They kept the story alive, constantly reframing it
  so the cameras always had something to see and the public always had something
  to talk about. And then there’s Peter Tatchell. He didn’t simply “make a
  scene”, he made himself the scene. He has spent decades putting his own body
  on the line: attempting a citizen’s arrest of Robert Mugabe, confronting
  police indifference to homophobic violence, interrupting Easter sermons. He
  has been beaten unconscious, arrested countless times, vilified and
  celebrated. Tatchell embodies conviction, turning his own suffering into
  testimony, forcing Britain to confront prejudice it preferred to ignore.
  Fast-forward to 2004 and the Yes Men’s audacious Bhopal stunt. They posed as
  Dow Chemical executives on BBC World, announcing a $12bn compensation package
  for victims of the disaster. For a brief moment, the world believed justice
  had arrived. Dow’s share price plummeted before the hoax was exposed. This
  wasn’t chaos, it was conviction armed with wit, a mind bomb detonated live on
  air. Or take Germany’s Centre for Political Beauty, which built a replica
  Holocaust memorial outside the home of the Alternative für Deutschland leader,
  Björn Höcke. The far right had claimed the “wounds of the Holocaust should
  heal”. Its answer was unignorable concrete, a daily reminder that history
  isn’t a wound to be closed for convenience. It was satire sharpened into
  steel, cutting deeper than any speech. And then there’s Led By Donkeys, the
  post-Brexit guerrillas. They don’t rant. They don’t editorialise. They hold up
  a mirror, reminding politicians of words they have said, written or tweeted,
  and probably wished they hadn’t. Their giant projection on parliament, Boris
  Johnson’s lies replayed on the cliffs of Dover, their Covid memorial wall of
  thousands of painted hearts; these weren’t stunts for novelty’s sake. They
  weaponised the words of the powerful, replaying them until they choked their
  authors. Clarity, timing, simplicity. This is the lesson we keep forgetting.
  Protest isn’t just confrontation, it’s an imagination weaponised. A stunt is a
  mind bomb that plants itself in the national conversation. These acts of
  theatre marry humour and symbolism to conviction, creating ripples that travel
  long after the news cameras have moved on. Yet the cycle is always the same.
  At the time, protests are demonised, particularly by the right, who
  instinctively oppose change. Later, the very same acts are reappraised,
  rehabilitated or even lauded. The suffragettes, once branded terrorists, are
  now national heroines. The Greenham women, once derided as cranks in
  cardigans, are now honoured for their foresight. Time transforms outrage into
  heritage. Today, with Palestine Action banned and Extinction Rebellion
  dismissed as a nuisance, we’re told that only “lawful protest” is legitimate.
  But the suffragettes would fail that test, and so would Greenham. Their
  legacies endure because they didn’t seek permission, they sought change. Their
  power lay in creativity, conviction and the audacity to place truth before
  power and performance before permission. Having examined the BBC archives for
  Outrage Inc, I believe we are at a crossroads. We can allow protest to be
  neutered into stage-managed civility, or we can acknowledge that it has always
  been outrageous, risky and profoundly creative. This is not a rallying cry for
  lawlessness. But we should reflect on the red-hot battles that forged our
  society. We call them stunts, but the word feels too trivial for acts that
  pushed the envelope and forced us to confront inequality and injustice.
  Because history shows this: the stunt is never a sideshow. It is the main act
  of change. Mark Borkowski is a crisis PR consultant and author. His BBC Radio
  4 Archive on 4 documentary, Outrage Inc, airs on 23 August Do you have an
