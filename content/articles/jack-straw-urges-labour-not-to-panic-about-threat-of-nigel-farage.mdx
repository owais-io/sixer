  Keir Starmer and his ministers must not “panic” about the threat of Nigel
  Farage, the former home secretary Jack Straw has said, adding that the prime
  minister had impressed on the world stage and should show more of that side of
  himself at home. In an interview with the Guardian, he praised Starmer’s
  intention to recognise a Palestinian state after an ultimatum to Israel – but
  defended the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, saying he would also have
  proscribed the direct action group Palestine Action. The British political
  veteran said he believed Starmer and his cabinet were “head and shoulders”
  above opposition politicians and would reap the rewards of a gradual
  improvement in the economy and public services, which would not come
  immediately. And he said the poll lead of Reform UK should not be taken as a
  foregone conclusion. “We have been here before in terms of an insurgent party
  leading in the polls. So I think it is the famous phrase – don’t panic,” he
  said. The former cabinet minister said Labour faced not only a terrible
  economic inheritance, but fundamental damage to the fabric of democracy by the
  previous Conservative governments, primarily Boris Johnson. “Johnson polluted
  British politics and although he’s left the stage, that pollution carries on,
  and has been very profound,” he said. “People look at the first Blair period
  with kind of rose-tinted spectacles. It didn’t always feel that it was easy at
  the time, but the inheritance was much easier.” Straw said there had at least
  been an appreciation in 1997 that his predecessors had been competent people.
  “These people [in the last Tory government] were not competent. They couldn’t
  do the job. In the space of four years, I think there were five home
  secretaries,” he said. Straw, who was foreign secretary during the invasion of
  Iraq, which he later admitted had been a mistake, said he had spent time in
  the run-up to last year’s general election with David Lammy and dismissed the
  idea Labour that had not been adequately prepared to enter government. “The
  issues that they’re dealing with have become much more intense,” he said. “I
  was talking to someone who worked for years in the Treasury, he was saying how
  these ministers are head and shoulders above what he described as the Fourth
  XI of the previous government.” Straw represented his Blackburn constituency
  for 33 years, and has often talked about how he had been proud that a Labour
  government had helped to heal racial and social divisions in Britain, which
  many in Westminster now feel have fractured with tensions exploited by Farage
  and others. His seat is now held by Adnan Hussain, a pro-Gaza independent.
  Straw, who until recently still chaired a youth centre in the town and still
  chairs a chain of academies including Muslim faith schools in Blackburn, said
  it was hardly surprising given the strength of feeling about Gaza. He said he
  knew Hussain and thought he was “throughly decent” and added: “Politics there
  has always been complicated.” But he said it was clear that politics was
  fracturing in a way that would start to produce unpredictable results –
  particularly under first past the post, which he favoured abolishing. “The
  party needs to think about that,” he said of electoral reform. “And it would
  get through, I think people understand that in a multi-party situation, first
  past the post is potentially unfair. It can produce really quirky results.
  Farage could come through on that.” Could he envisage Farage as PM? “There is
  a chance. I think it’s a small chance, smaller than he thinks. The Tory party
  appears to me to just be collapsing,” he said. Although he admitted he did not
  expect such a plummet in popularity for Starmer and Labour, he urged the party
  to remain calm. “In 2000 of course we lost the mayoral election to Ken
  Livingstone; that was regarded as a great humiliation for Labour. “So, not
  being Pollyanna-ish about this, but my instinct is that things will gradually
  improve.” He said he hoped a sceptical UK public would begin to make the
  connection between Starmer’s successful diplomacy, especially with Donald
  Trump, and the kind of statesman he could be at home. “The way Starmer has
  navigated the challenge from America has been extraordinary,” he said. “This
  government has made missteps, which all governments do, and not least about
  things like [welfare]. “But at some stage I think that people will start to
  make the connection between the stalwart international statesman and Starmer
  the domestic prime minister, and realise that we’re talking about the same
  person and the character.” In one of his first acts as home secretary Straw
  was the architect of the Human Rights Act 1998, incorporating the European
  convention on human rights (ECHR) into UK domestic law. His ruthless approach
  to crime and law and order was often contrasted with his commitment to the act
  – which survived threats of abolition under the Conservatives. But Straw has
  become increasingly sceptical of the sweeping reach of the Strasbourg court –
  and said the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, should consider legislating
  to stop such an interventionist approach on asylum, which rightwing parties
  have denounced. “I’m not remotely in the position of people on the right who
  say just abolish the Human Rights Act and withdraw from the ECHR,” he said.
  “But we need to look at two things. One, if you can persuade the court in
  Strasbourg that they have to be less interventionist, and that if they’re not,
  they will write themselves out of the script. “The second thing is considering
  ways in which you progressively decouple the Human Rights Act from Strasbourg.
  The Human Rights Act says British courts should ‘take account’ of the
  decisions of the ECHR. But that’s basically been interpreted as ‘to follow’.
  And that was never, never our intention.” He said the court should be
  “concentrating on the original purposes, which was to stop really serious
  breaches of rights, not everyday asylum issues.” As home secretary, it was
  also Straw’s Terrorism Act that introduced the proscription of terror groups –
  used against al-Qaida and others. At the time, addressing concerns that it
  would affect civil disobedience by organisations such as Greenpeace, Straw
  said there was “no evidence whatever” they would be affected. But he said now
  he was fully behind the decision to proscribe Palestine Action, because of the
  attack on military planes at RAF Brize Norton. “This was a very, very serious
  breach of the security of the base. And if I’d have been in Yvette’s position,
  which I have been, I would have done exactly what she’s done,” he said. “You
  can’t proscribe on a whim. And you need clear evidence. Much of that evidence
  is based on intelligence, but also just the fact that they are attacking our
  military assets and military bases. I think we certainly would have taken the
  action that she has taken.” But Straw said he had been delighted to see
  Starmer take the decision to recognise a Palestinian state – saying it was
  “barefaced cheek” of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to say it
  was playing into the hands of Hamas. “I applaud the decision which Keir
  Starmer has taken. I’m really glad that he’s done that. I think that the
  conditions imposed were quite skilful,” he said. Straw said he did not know
  yet whether the Israeli offensive in Gaza would ultimately be deemed a
  genocide. “Whatever label you put on it, it’s absolutely amoral and
  unacceptable and just terrible.
