  You once said you need to be so in control of things that if you had brain
  surgery, you’d only feel comfortable doing it yourself. Do you still feel this
  way? FioreSebek I don’t remember saying that, but I can see how someone might
  joke about it. There’s usually room for improvisation in life, but I have
  never been a very good improviser when it comes to acting. When I do things in
  my own accent, like Jack Irish, he was quite laissez-faire and flippant, so I
  could be looser and pull stuff out of the air. But when I’m working with
  high-powered actors and speaking with a tricky accent, I’m learning my lines,
  doing what’s required and staying in control. If you were attending a dinner
  party where all the other guests were characters you have played, who would
  you sit next to, and who would you avoid? FrocksAway I’d avoid Eric from The
  Rover and the Reverend from Brimstone, because they might kill me. Ed Exley
  from LA Confidential is quite arrogant and boring. I’d like to sit next to
  Andy Warhol, who I’ve played [in Factory Girl]. Houdini would be interesting,
  although I don’t reckon you’d get a word in. And Leonard from Memento would
  start with dessert and finish with the starter because he’s all backwards. I
  love my partner dearly, but she says if she was ever going to leave me, it
  would be for “Mike from Neighbours”. What can I do to make her stop? Perhaps
  you can tell her for me? TooMuchSpareTime No, I’m not going to make her stop.
  I’m with her all the way if she thinks: if you’re going to have an affair,
  make sure you have one with Annette Bening, or whoever. Maybe she needs to
  watch a couple of the horrible characters I’ve played, like Charley Rakes in
  Lawless. That’s another character I don’t want to sit next to. She should
  watch Brimstone and Lawless, and I can guarantee you she will have lost
  interest in Mike from Neighbours. When they first sent you the script for
  Memento, was it backwards? lagodeluna It was exactly as you see it in the
  film. Speaking of people who are in control of what they’re doing, Christopher
  Nolan is king of that, because he so brilliantly constructed something where
  there was no room for things to move around. When my agent sent me the script,
  he said: “By the way, this all goes backwards.” I’m glad he did, otherwise I
  would have read it three times before I got what was going on. Any news about
  the Priscilla, Queen of the Desert sequel? Have you boarded the lavender bus
  again, or are you still stuck in the pre-production desert? badrobot2 and
  feirefitz We’re stuck in the pre-production desert, going back and forth on
  the script, locations and budget. I feel there’s enough love in the room to
  make it happen. I don’t know if I am looking forward to putting on a dress
  again. I don’t think I’m going to look as good in a frock as I did in 1993
  when I was 25. Funnily enough, I was contacted by Madame Tussauds, who were
  setting up in Australia and wanted to have iconic Australian actors, like Hugh
  Jackman as Wolverine, Russell Crowe from Gladiator, Eric Bana from Chopper and
  me from Priscilla. I was filming Prometheus in London, so they said: “Could
  you come in to Madame Tussauds and stand in your underwear, pulling this pose”
  – they had a photo – “and we’re going to take six million photos from every
  angle?” I said: “This is 2011. I’m not in the same shape that I was in 1993.”
  They went: “Yes, yes, yes. Everyone wants bigger muscles and bigger boobs.
  We’ll make the clay model first, you can come in, and if there’s anything you
  don’t like, you can let us know.” So I had to go in and say: “If you look at
  this photo, my waist used to be a little bit thinner,” and they said: “Oh
  yeah, good point.” Did you have an inkling that LA Confidential would be such
  a masterpiece while you were filming it? GasparGarcao No, is the answer. I
  don’t really have an inkling for anything. I’d done four or five films in
  Australia, but it was a totally different environment: in the US, with
  Americans, on an American film. The whole thing was so big, it was hard for me
  to gauge anything. I was too focused on trying to do a good job to think:
  “Wow, this is going to be good.” I was the second person cast after Russell
  Crowe. Russ and I were rehearsing while they were working with the script, and
  casting other people. So then David Strathairn, Kim Basinger and Danny DeVito
  turned up. James Cromwell says to my character in the film: “Would you be
  willing to shoot a hardened criminal in the back to save face?” I say: “No no
  no,” being all moral, but in the end, I shoot him in the back. When I shot
  him, the wadding from the shotgun flew out and hit him in the back of the
  head. He was 30ft away, so everyone had said: “Don’t worry, it’s safe.” But,
  for a moment, I thought: “Jeez. I’ve killed him. I’ll never work in Hollywood
  again.” Was there a particular role that earned you Radiohead’s nod of
  approval to appear in their music video for Follow Me Around? McScootikins I
  don’t think so. They contacted my agent in the US saying: “Do you have any
  actors who might want to do it?” And Chris, my agent, who knows I’m a big
  Radiohead fan, said straight away: “Guy Pearce is in London right now.” I was
  filming A Spy Among Friends with Damian Lewis and said: “I have to take a call
  with Thom Yorke about this Radiohead music video I’m in. So, excuse me.” Are
  you grateful that your late 80s pop career didn’t take off? Megapode777 That’s
  the best question I’ve ever been asked in my life. After I finished
  Neighbours, there was a period where people would say: “Didn’t you used to be
  Mike from Neighbours?” Then one day, this 10- or 12-year-old kid came up to me
  in a shopping centre and said: “Didn’t you used to be Guy Pearce?” I thought:
  “Wow, that’s the most profound thing anyone’s ever said,” because, in a way,
  it was true. I always knew I wasn’t just a soap opera actor. I was just stuck
  in that cycle. Prior to Neighbours, I’d done 10 years of theatre, which made
  playing the same character for four years frustrating. I wanted to delve into
  a wider variety of personalities and behaviours. But when I finished
  Neighbours in 1989, I was in the wilderness because no one wanted to employ
  the guy who was in Neighbours, and I struggled to find work. I went back and
  did some theatre, a little bit of Home and Away and then, in 1993, I got to do
  Priscilla. So, yes, I’m really grateful that my 80s pop career didn’t take
  off! • Inside is available on digital, DVD and Blu-ray on 11 August
