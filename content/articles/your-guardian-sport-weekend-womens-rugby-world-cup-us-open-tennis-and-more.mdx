  Saturday 8am (all times BST) Matchday live Football After a (mostly) exciting
  set of matches on the first weekend, we’ll have all the buildup to the Premier
  League’s second Saturday of the season, plus reaction to West Ham v Chelsea,
  with Billy Munday and John Brewin. There may also be news of more transfer
  targets being hijacked by a club’s fiercest rivals, as we get to less than 10
  days before the window closes. Our correspondents will be chipping in with the
  latest transfer news, while Jamie Jackson will be checking in from the Etihad
  Stadium, before Manchester City v Tottenham. 12pm Australia v Samoa Rugby
  union After Friday night’s opener between England and the USA, the Women’s
  Rugby World Cup continues in Salford. Australia are likely to be too strong
  for the Pacific islanders, in what is expected to be a warm-up for the
  Wallaroos’ key Pool A game, against the USA next Saturday. Daniel Gallan is
  helming the minute-by-minute blog, while Aaron Bower will cover this match and
  the Scotland v Wales Pool B game that follows, before Sarah Rendell reports
  from York on the day’s other game in that section, Canada v Fiji. 12.30pm
  Manchester City v Tottenham Football A nice, easy game for Spurs fans to look
  forward to after Eberechi Eze’s relocation to north London took an unexpected
  diversion. Tottenham began with a convincing home win over Burnley last
  Saturday, but the deposed serial champions will surely be tougher opponents.
  Billy Munday brings you minute-by-minute coverage as City look to follow up
  the 4-0 dispatching of Wolves against opponents who have caused Pep Guardiola
  a fair deal of angst down the years, last season’s equivalent fixture being a
  4-0 win for Angeball. Jamie Jackson will provide the match report and the
  managers’ reactions. 1.45pm Premier League clockwatch Football Join us for the
  3pm team news and updates on the lower-league lunchtime games too, including
  Charlton v Leicester, from where Yara El-Shaboury will be sending us a report.
  John Brewin is at the helm for the live afternoon, which includes Brentford v
  Aston Villa and Bournemouth v Wolves, but perhaps the most critical game of
  the afternoon was a Championship fixture last season: Burnley v Sunderland.
  Will Unwin is at Turf Moor for the match report (including news of whether
  Martin Dubravka has learned to count to eight), while Ben Bloom is at the
  Gtech and Ben Fisher at the Vitality. We’ll also have all the news through the
  Championship and Leagues One &amp; Two. 4.10pm South Africa v Australia Rugby
  union How do the Wallabies follow that? Last Saturday’s epic comeback win in
  Johannesburg – Australia’s first victory there since 1963 – will live long in
  the memory whatever happens in Cape Town, but a Springboks backlash is
  expected. They are not alone in seeking revenge: the Brumbies wing Corey
  Toole, a sevens star at the Paris Games, makes his 15-man international debut
  against the nation that denied him an Olympic medal in the bronze playoff last
  August. Rassie Erasmus has made a number of changes against an Australia side
  shorn of their captain, Harry Wilson, by a knee injury. Daniel Gallan will
  guide you through. 5.30pm Arsenal v Leeds Football It’s going to be second
  playing first from last season two weekends in a row, as before Arsenal travel
  to Liverpool they host the winners of the Championship. The Gunners’
  hard-fought victory at Manchester United was followed up by the transfer
  window win over Tottenham, so the home crowd at the Emirates Stadium should be
  buoyant. But Leeds fans are on a double high of their own, back where they
  feel they belong and with three points under their belts, too; they will hope
  new keeper Lucas Perri will cope better with Arsenal’s set pieces than
  Manchester United’s Altay Bayindir did. Scott Murray is your live host, while
  David Hytner and Jacob Steinberg will have the report, reaction and analysis
  from the ground. Sunday 5.30am Australia v South Africa, third ODI Cricket
  While Australia claimed the T20 series in a thrilling finish, winning last
  Saturday’s decider by two wickets with one ball to spare, South Africa have
  sealed the one-dayers in convincing fashion, winning by 98 runs in Cairns and
  84 runs in Mackay. Lungi Ngidi took five for 42, including Josh Inglis for 87,
  in Friday’s second game to clinch the series, the rest of the home batting not
  offering much resistance at the Great Barrier Reef Arena. That’s also the
  venue for Sunday’s dead rubber; James Wallace and Geoff Lemon are on the
  over-by-over. 8am Matchday live Football It’s time to pick over all the
  controversies from Saturday with Dominic Booth – and there will be
  controversies, because there always are, as evidenced by the split in opinion
  over James Tarkowski’s handball on Monday. Talking of Everton, their fixture
  against Brighton is not the biggest match of the day in footballing terms but
  the first competitive game at Hill Dickinson Stadium is a huge landmark for
  one of the Football League’s founder members, the venue at Bramley-Moore Dock
  following on from Anfield and Goodison Park as the Blues’ homes. Our man on
  Merseyside, Andy Hunter, will be on the ground on an historic day, as will one
  of our news colleagues, the loyal Evertonian Aaron Sharp. 2pm Crystal Palace v
  Nottingham Forest Football Just as those new students of football lore have to
  have the misty origins of the Palace-Brighton rivalry outlined to them, so
  will future generations need to listen to “Marinakis” and “Textor” being
  darkly muttered by their still-bitter elders. After Thursday night’s
  demonstrations, Uefa executives may be thin on the ground at Selhurst Park but
  there will be extra police and stewarding, not least in case Evangelos
  Marinakis turns up. It is to be hoped that protests tied to Forest’s
  intervention in Palace’s demotion from Europa League to Conference League are
  limited to chants and banners, but the authorities will be prepared. On the
  pitch, both sides made promising starts, with Palace drawing at Chelsea and
  Forest dispatching Brentford, though the hosts will be Eberechi Eze, scorer of
  their disallowed Stamford Bridge goal. Scott Murray will have all the latest
  with updates from Everton v Brighton, too, as players vie to be the first
  official scorer at the new ground. Ed Aarons and Jonathan Wilson are at
  Selhurst Park for reports and analysis. 4.30pm Fulham v Manchester United
  Football Two sides with something to build on meet at Craven Cottage. Fulham
  deservedly took a last-gasp point at one of their peers, Brighton; while
  Manchester United put together a promising performance against Arsenal, albeit
  without reward. Defeat for either, though, would suddenly leave them at risk
  of an anxious international break, with only the Carabao Cup and one more
  league game in which to earn some credit. Tim de Lisle will have the highs and
  lows as they happen, while John Brewin and Barney Ronay are by the Thames. 4pm
  US Open day one Tennis Well, it’s day one if you don’t count the novel version
  of mixed doubles with which some of the big names warmed up for the main
  event. The singles gets under way at 11am or noon local time and while home
  hopeful Ben Shelton kicks off action on Arthur Ashe, Emma Raducanu gets the
  honour on Louis Armstrong. Both are up against qualifiers, while the women’s
  No 1 seed, Aryna Sabalenka, against Rebeka Masarova, Britain’s 2021 winner is
  followed by the US’s Taylor Fritz, seeded four, against his compatriot Emilio
  Nava. Taha Hashim will follow the action live, while Tumaini Carayol will be
  reporting from Flushing Meadows on the pick of the action.
