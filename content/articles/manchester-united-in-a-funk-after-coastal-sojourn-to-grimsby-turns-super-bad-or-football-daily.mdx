  HIT IT AND QUIT IT? Fifty-five years have passed since James Brown, singer,
  songwriter and minister of new super-heavy funk, released a song about people
  who “like a dull knife [that] just ain’t cutting”, were “talking loud and
  saying nothing”. Manchester United would probably have preferred to prompt
  thoughts of Brown’s I Feel Good but they are where they are – and if they ever
  do shake their money-makers they could probably then benefit from dropping a
  few of them. Sometimes we don’t get to choose which 70s deep funk classic we
  unwittingly call to mind, and Ruben Amorim left no doubt when after Wednesday
  night’s ineffably miserable defeat by Grimsby he opined about feeling “my
  players spoke really loud today … At half-time I told them that they were
  speaking really loud to me. I understand what you are doing, what I am
  seeing.” Like a dull knife, they just weren’t cutting. In this way United’s
  players contrasted pleasingly with Grimsby’s fans, who while also talking loud
  were definitely saying something, specifically about someone getting sacked in
  the morning. If only the Portuguese could work out how to inspire his charges
  to get up (get on up). At a push he might be able to take ’em to the bridge,
  but they would almost certainly then want to jump off it. And now many are
  doubting whether Amorim will even be able to stay on the scene – like, for
  example, a lovin’ machine. United’s Super Bad display turned the evening into
  a classic coastal Milk Cup tie, complete with wildly overperforming minnows
  (perhaps better described as haddocks on this occasion), wildly overpaid
  international megastars resembling fish out of water, and a joyful,
  disbelieving pitch invasion. “I’ve been fortunate enough to go to the FA Cup,
  European Championship and Champions League finals, but the atmosphere here
  absolutely trumps them,” said Polly Bancroft, Grimsby’s CEO. It was a game in
  which United managed to humiliatingly lose, somehow recover, almost win and
  then humiliatingly lose again. “The way we started the game, we were not even
  here,” mumbled Amorim, who spent key periods of the match ignoring the action
  completely in favour of dementedly shuffling tokens around a laminated pitch
  map, and then the decisive shootout ignoring both the action and his toys
  while fully focusing on his footwear. It took 26 penalties to split the teams,
  in the end. This was partly because one goalkeeper, while making genuine
  attempts to reach the spot-kicks, appeared happy when he succeeded simply to
  help them on their way into the net, while the other’s technique involved
  flinging himself to the ground several seconds before most of them were
  actually taken. “I’m a Man United fan, so I’m half-fuming,” Grimsby keeper
  Christy Pym explained at the end – and these days they’re the ones who are
  most likely to be in a funk. QUOTE OF THE DAY Physically, because they’re
  small, they look like wee boys. They’re clearly not wee boys, and they won’t
  thank me for saying that, they’ll hate me saying it, but they look like wee
  boys. There’s no men, you need men. And your men don’t need to be 6ft 5ins,
  6ft 6ins. They just need to have heart, head and a bit of organisation and
  desire” – Not-tall Ally McCoist on a theory as to how Club Brugge, currently
  fourth in the Belgian Pro League with six goals from four games, found a way
  past Russell Martin’s rattled Rangers 6-0 (9-1 agg) in Bigger Cup playoffs.
  FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS Grimsby Town supporters had a grand old celebration
  last night. How long will it take for the FA to spoil the fun by putting the
  club on the naughty step for the pitch invasion?” – JJ Zucal. If Ruben Amorim
  was pleased at how a lack of European football would benefit his Man Utd
  squad, he must be delighted now that they will no longer be troubled with
  contesting the Carabao Cup either. They’ll be unstoppable at this rate” – Tom
  Dowler It is no longer funny. Making a joke out of yet another Man U debacle
  appears indecent. You can’t beat a dead horse. Let them rest in peace” –
  Krishna Moorthy Lukas Kwasniok’s get-up from the weekend makes it look like
  the actual manager has got injured and a call has gone out in the stadium for
  a qualified fan to replace him on the touchline” – Jim Hearson If you have
