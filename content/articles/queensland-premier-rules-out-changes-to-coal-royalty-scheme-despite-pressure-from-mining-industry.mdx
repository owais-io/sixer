  Queensland’s premier has ruled out changes to the state’s coal royalties
  regime, often dubbed the world’s highest, amid pressure from the industry.
  David Crisafulli gave his strongest denial yet of any changes at a press
  conference in Emerald, in central Queensland, ahead of a cabinet meeting on
  Monday. “We’re not changing that scheme,” Crisafulli said on Monday. “We’ve
  been upfront. I said to you clearly before the election, we aren’t touching
  the royalty regime.” Sign up: AU Breaking News email Introduced in 2022 amid
  high coal prices, the Labor policy raised more than $10bn for the state budget
  in a single year. Royalties revenue has since declined alongside coal prices.
  Under the scheme, miners pay a 20% royalty for prices above $175 a tonne, 30%
  for prices above $225 a tonne, and 40% for prices above $300 a tonne. Royalty
  rates in other jurisdictions are typically in the single digits; in NSW, coal
  producers can be charged as little as 8.8% depending on the type of mine. As
  opposition leader, Crisafulli ruled out any changes to the royalties scheme
  during the period covered by the forward estimates, raising the possibility of
  changes after the 2028 election. The CEO of the Queensland Resources Council,
  Janette Hewson, said it was “disappointing” that the industry’s concerns “are
  not being properly considered”. The state’s resources sector has consistently
  opposed the policy, arguing that it would deter investment and could lead to
  mine closures. It reportedly spent $40m on advertising attacking the previous
  Labor government. “Around a quarter of Queensland coal companies are
  struggling to break even. The world’s highest coal royalty tax rates is a bad
  policy contributing to that,” Hewson said. Royalties have been cited as the
  reason for a series of downturns, including by Bowen Coking Coal after it went
  into administration last month. Coronado Coal also cited the levy as a reason
  for a reported $73m loss last week. The Queensland Treasury argues that
  royalties have little effect on profits. Coal and gas campaigner for
  Queensland Conservation, Charlie Cox, said the industry was wrong to blame
  royalties for its downturn. “The truth is, they’re being undone by their own
  product. Whether the coal lobby admits it or not, the era of coal is coming to
  an end,” he said. “The problem isn’t a policy that puts just some of the money
  back in Queenslanders’ pockets, the problem is continuing to recklessly dig,
  burn, and export a fossil fuel that is exacerbating the cost-of-living crisis
  and fuelling climate change.” Crisafulli told media in Emerald that he was
  “very bullish about the future of the coal industry in Queensland”, because
  the government would grant it “certainty”. The central Queensland town of
  about 15,000 is among the country’s most coal-dependent, with about 16.6% of
  the local labour market employed in “coal mining”, according to the Australian
  Bureau of Statistics. “We believe in the future of the coal industry. We
  believe in the future of regional Queensland, and with the confidence that we
  are giving through the certainty of taxation, regulation and approvals, you
  are going to see a bright future for the industry,” he said. The government
  has extended the life of Queensland’s coal power plants, and ordered a review
  of its emissions reduction targets.
