  Your article (Country diary: Ongar, Essex, 13 August) briefly mentions the
  connection between St Andrew’s church in Greensted and the Tolpuddle Martyrs,
  several of whom settled nearby on their return from transportation. The
  implication is that the link was benign. It was not. The Martyrs actively
  supported the Chartist movement for universal (male) suffrage, payment for MPs
  and annual parliamentary elections. These radical demands were too much for
  the vicar of St Andrew’s, who, with the local squirearchy, kicked up such a
  fuss that the Martyrs departed for Canada after a few years of persecution.
  David Jobbins Kelvedon Hatch, Essex • I enjoyed your look back in Ongar. But
  the ancient church there was surely not “built by” the Tudors or Stuarts –
  probably not by many Normans either. The real work was done mostly by
  hard-pressed Essex folk skilled in the necessary tasks, or labourers. Let us
  fairly remember who truly built this world. Clive Needle Rowhedge, Essex •
