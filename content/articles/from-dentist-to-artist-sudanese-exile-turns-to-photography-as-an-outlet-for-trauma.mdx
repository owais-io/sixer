  ‘For me, red is always a representation of blood and losing people, so I tend
  to use this red fabric to represent our trauma.” The Sudanese photographer
  Hashim Nasr is talking about how the war in his homeland has influenced his
  work. Before the start of the conflict in 2023, the figures in his photographs
  were often covered in flowers or holding heart shapes, challenging stereotypes
  of masculinity. Now, flowing red fabric representing trauma, loss and
  bloodshed is a frequent motif. Nasr describes his art as “dreamlike” – his
  project On War and Displacement features a series of striking, surreal images
  with anonymous figures wearing traditional white Sudanese robes, their
  identities concealed beneath conical masks. In one of his most recent works,
  two figures sit in front of a TV, from which a length of red fabric flows out
  towards them. “Me and my family are always stuck in front of TV, watching news
  of what’s happening in Sudan,” says Nasr, who now lives in Egypt. But, he
  adds: “All you get from TV is news of destruction, blood and loss.” In other
  photos, the red fabric trails from a suitcase or flows between different
  buildings, representing how war has pushed Sudanese to leave their homes and
  find new ones. War has also transformed how the dentist turned photographer
  views his work: from a form of personal creative expression to a tool for
  raising awareness about the situation in his country, which the UN calls the
  world’s largest humanitarian crisis. “I feel this heavy weight on me to speak
  up. I need to express who I am and the impact this war has on me as a person
  [and] my family,” he says. Nasr was on holiday in Egypt in April 2023 when the
  war in Sudan broke out and has not been able to return. He still struggles to
  adapt to life abroad, he says, living in a small home knowing that his large
  family house in Sudan’s capital, Khartoum, has been looted by militia
  fighters. At least 3.3 million Sudanese have fled Sudan since 2023, with 1.5
  million arriving in Egypt, according to the UN, while the remainder are spread
  throughout Sudan’s other neighbours. While Nasr’s close family escaped Sudan,
  many of his relatives are among the 8 million internally displaced people.
  Within two months of the war starting, an uncle who had been on dialysis died
  because he was trapped in his home, unable to access treatment. “It was really
  hard news for us to take at that time because we’d been asking them to go to a
  safer place, or at least get his medication,” says Nasr. “But anytime they
  tried to leave there were clashes outside.” Nasr began experimenting with art
  during the Covid-19 pandemic, when his dental practice was closed, taking
  self-portraits and using friends as models. While he still does some part-time
  dentistry, art is now his main focus. His work is mostly shared on social
  media sites such as Instagram but his images are earning attention in the art
  world, winning him the East African Photography award last year, a series of
  fellowships and a place in the British Journal of Photography’s “ones to
  watch” issue last year. The striking masks in his photos were developed while
  trying to find a creative way to conceal the identities of his models, mindful
  of the risk to them and their families in Sudan if they were identified. Some
  of his photos are a commentary on the war itself – such as a series called the
  Curse of Gold, which depicts men looming over a woman wrapped in gold fabric
  to represent the looting of Sudan’s gold resources by the paramilitary Rapid
  Support Forces. But most of his work is about connecting with other Sudanese
  with shared experiences of trauma, loss and exile. “I noticed this war isn’t
  talked about enough in social media or in the news,” he says. “I feel like
  it’s neglected and that gave me the motivation to talk more about it.”
