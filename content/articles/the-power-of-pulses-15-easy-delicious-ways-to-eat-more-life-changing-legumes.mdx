  Worried about rising food prices, your diet’s carbon footprint or whether
  you’re eating healthily enough? Believe it or not, there could be a magic
  bullet: pulses. According to a study by the University of Reading, published
  in the European Journal of Nutrition in March, adults who eat more pulses –
  dried beans, peas and lentils – have a higher intake of nutrients including
  fibre, folate and vitamins C and E; minerals such as iron, zinc and magnesium;
  and a lower intake of saturated fat and sugar. Similar results have been found
  in American, Australian and Canadian research. The UK study also found that
  eating pulses was associated with a more sustainable diet. In her book, Pulse:
  Modern Recipes with Beans, Peas &amp; Lentils, Eleanor Maidment explains that
  growing pulses has a positive effect on the environment. “Many are ‘nitrogen
  fixers’, meaning they have the ability to convert nitrogen in the atmosphere
  into a form that can be used in the soil, making it more fertile for other
  crops,” she writes. Justine Butler, the head of research at Viva!, says: “The
  lowest-impact beef still creates six times the greenhouse gases and uses 36
  times more land per gram of protein than peas.” Pulses are filling and good
  value but, say the Reading researchers, the typical British adult eats only
  about 15g a day, with the average household spending just £1.68 on pulses a
  week. UK guidelines state that 80g of pulses (about a third of a tin) counts
  as one of your five a day. The University of Reading study is part of the
  Raising the Pulse project, which aims to increase pulse consumption to improve
  public and planetary health. One of its strategies is adding fava bean (dried
  broad bean) flour to white bread – similar to a successful programme in
  Denmark using rye flour to increase wholegrain consumption. Prof Julie
  Lovegrove, the director of the Hugh Sinclair Unit of Human Nutrition at the
  University of Reading, says: “These foods are not only nutritious but also
  incredibly versatile, affordable and sustainable.” If you want to start eating
  more pulses, here are 15 things you need to know. You don’t have to cook
  pulses for hours. “Don’t be put off by the idea that you have to soak dried
  pulses in advance,” says Maidment. “I am rarely organised enough to do so, but
  thankfully there’s a huge range of jarred and canned varieties that require no
  prep and are hugely convenient. If you can afford to spend a bit more, then
  jarred varieties have the edge over canned in terms of flavour and texture.
  Brands such as Bold Bean Co, Brindisa or Belazu are consistently excellent.”
  But batch-cooking dried pulses is the best value. Jenny Chandler, the author
  of Super Pulses and Pulse, soaks and cooks a big pot of pulses once a week.
  “You will finish up with well over double their volume – it’s a really
  economical way to have a ready supply. They will keep in their cooking water
  for five days in the fridge and you can freeze any leftovers. Use them in
  salads, soups, purees, curries, stews and even puddings – they will become the
  bedrock of your cooking.” Pulses are for everyone. “You do not have to be
  vegetarian or vegan to enjoy pulses – far from it,” says Maidment. “We should
  all be eating more pulses. For instance, in a traybake, I’ll use one chicken
  thigh per person instead of two, and add a can of chickpeas or butter beans. I
  often add a can of lentils to bolognese. You’re still getting filling protein,
  but with the added benefits of gut-friendly fibre and numerous other minerals,
  vitamins and antioxidants.” They make meals go much further. “Most pulses are
  relatively cheap and quite mild in taste, making them ideal for bulking out
  soups, stews and curries without affecting the original flavour,” says
  Maidment. “You can often use different varieties interchangeably, depending on
  what you have to hand.” Chandler adds a handful of cooked pulses to all sorts
  of dishes. “Throwing a few chickpeas or cannellini beans into a simple tomato
  sauce with pasta not only ups the nutritional profile, but also keeps you
  feeling full for much longer,” she says. Baked beans are just the beginning.
  “By far the most eaten pulse in the UK is the haricot bean due to its starring
  role in tinned baked beans,” says Maidment. “Butter beans, cannellini beans,
  black beans and kidney beans are also popular, but there is a huge variety of
  beans to try. For instance, flageolet beans are delicate, pale-green beans
  popular in French cooking – try them in a slow-braised lamb stew with garlic,
  thyme and white wine.” Chandler loves yin yang beans, AKA calypso or orca
  beans. “These black and white beans are utterly beautiful and taste wonderful
  in chilli,” she says. But beans on toast still rules. “My favourite
  pulse-based dish is garlicky beans and bitter greens on toast, topped with
  chilli oil,” says Joe Yonan, the author of Cool Beans. You can make (almost)
  anything with chickpeas. “The chickpea is my favourite pulse, for its
  versatility,” says Yonan. “It is the basis of hummus, the best dip on the
  planet. It’s great in a coronation chickpea sandwich, and it holds its shape
  in salads and stews.” For a snack, Yonan mixes cooked chickpeas with olive oil
  and spices (such as za’atar, Chinese five spice, chaat masala or smoked
  paprika) and roasts them in the oven for an hour at 150C/300F. “I then turn
  off the oven but leave them in there to completely cool – it dries them out
  and makes them really satisfyingly crunchy.” He also uses chickpea (AKA gram)
  flour to make farinata or socca, a savoury pancake; panisse (chickpea fries);
  and bhajis and pakoras. “Sometimes I use it as a base for a sort of
  non-traditional, don’t-tell-the-Italians pizza.” Lentils cook more quickly
  than most pulses. Red split lentils are especially quick, cooking in about 15
  minutes. Lentils don’t need soaking, but it does reduce the cooking time.
  Maidment likes to experiment with different dals. “Regional Indian dals can be
  made with a range of lentils – yellow moong, black urad, chana dal – each
  bringing a slightly different flavour and texture,” says Maidment. But she
  also has a soft spot for tinned lentils. “I often roast drained, tinned
  lentils with olive oil and crushed garlic to boost their flavour and add
  crispness before throwing them into a salad – perhaps ricotta and prosciutto,
  or chopped fresh and sun-dried tomatoes, mozzarella and basil.” Pulses make
  delicious dips. “Hummus is the classic, but you can blend most pulses into
  dips,” says Maidment. “Fava, a fabulous Greek split yellow pea dip, is
  absolutely worth making.” Blend cooked split yellow peas with caramelised
  onions and garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, salt and a little of the beans’
  cooking liquor or water to make. Pulse liquid has many uses. “Jarred and
  canned pulses are usually stored in a liquid known as aquafaba,” says
  Maidment. “It can be great for adding creaminess to savoury dishes or used as
  an egg alternative in baking.” She advises checking the salt levels and
  ingredients list before using – some pulses have added preserving and firming
  agents. Black beans make the best veggie burgers, says Yonan. The Guardian’s
  Meera Sodha agrees. She mashes a drained tin of black beans with breadcrumbs,
  garlic and onion powders, chipotle paste, dijon mustard, tomato ketchup and a
  splash of aquafaba, shapes them into patties, then fries them in olive oil
  until crispy. British pulses are having a revival. Maidment and Chandler both
  recommend carlin peas, pleasingly also known as black badgers, which are a
  heritage British pulse. They are available dried and cooked from companies
  such as Hodmedod’s. “They’re small, nutty brown peas, and make a great
  alternative to chickpeas, with a similarly impressive nutrient profile,” says
  Maidment. She roasts cooked carlin peas until crispy, then adds them to salads
  such as quinoa, broccoli and halloumi. Chandler uses them in dips and curries,
  and to make a version of refried beans. “They’re much more versatile than
  yellow or green dried peas as they don’t have such a pronounced ‘pea’
  flavour,” she says. In the US, Yonan suggests the lady pea, a spherical white
  bean that is popular in southern cuisine. Pulses make great protein shakes. “A
  handful of cooked pulses added into a smoothie will give it a great creamy
  texture and make it more nourishing,” says Chandler. She adds black beans or
  borlotti beans to dark berry smoothies, and chickpeas, cannellini beans or
  butter beans to green smoothies. Pulse-based pasta is worth a try. There is an
  increasing range of high-fibre pasta made from pulse flour: peas, lentils,
  chickpeas, black beans, mung beans … Chandler enjoys this alternative pasta,
  but says she doesn’t use it in classical Italian dishes: “I may use it in a
  pasta salad, say, or team it with a blue cheese and walnut sauce.” Yonan
  agrees that pulse pasta is best paired with “pungent flavours – super-garlicky
  or spicy”. Pulses aren’t just for savoury dishes. Yonan makes a chocolate and
  chickpea tart, and adds adzuki beans to brownies. “Adzuki beans are used in a
  lot of Asian desserts, such as mochi and ice-cream,” he says. Maidment prefers
  to use kidney beans in her brownies, while Chandler has a recipe for a simple
  chocolate and cannellini bean mousse. Drain and retain the liquid from a tin
  of cannellini beans. Blitz the beans with 150g of melted dark chocolate and an
  optional tablespoon of cocoa powder. Whisk the liquid for five to 10 minutes,
  until frothy. Fold into the melted chocolate and bean mix, and sweeten with a
  couple of tablespoons of maple or date syrup. Chill the mix before eating,
  perhaps topped with some chopped stem ginger in syrup, or served with fresh
  raspberries. • Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article? If
