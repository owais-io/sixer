  Wild bees strategically visit different flowers to balance their intake of
  protein, fat and carbohydrates, a study has found. A team of ecologists
  observed eight species of wild bumblebees in the Colorado Rockies over eight
  years to develop a comprehensive nutritional map. Focusing on pollen
  consumption, the team led by Northwestern University and the Chicago Botanic
  Garden tracked which flowers each bee species visited for pollen. They
  collected pollen samples from these plant species to understand their nutrient
  content. At the lab, the team measured each pollen sample’s macronutrient
  content and calculated its concentration of protein, fat and carbohydrates.
  Clear patterns emerged when the researchers compared each bee species’ diet
  with their physical traits. The nutrient content of the pollen changed through
  the seasons, the study also found. This shift in protein would then influence
  the bees’ nutritional preferences across the seasons. Researchers were
  surprised by the protein differences among the studied flowers. Some flowers
  consist of only 17% protein while others contained as much as 86%. The
  pollen’s nutrient content also changed throughout the season. For example, the
  study shared that spring flowers have more protein-rich pollen, while
  late-summer flowers are richer in fat and carbs. Justin Bain, the lead author
  on the study, which is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B:
  Biological Sciences, said: “all pollen contains protein, fats and carbs but
  each has a different mixture of micronutrients. Some are very high in protein
  like a steak. Others are more like a salad.” The team also found that
  coexisting bee species occupied two distinct nutrient niches. Larger-bodied
  bees with longer tongues preferred pollen high in protein but lower in sugars
  and fats, while bees with shorter tongues looked out for pollen richer in
  carbohydrates and fats. Individual bees will adjust their diets as their
  colonies develop and grow, which means their nutritional needs change through
  the seasons. Paul CaraDonna, senior author on the study, said: “We now have a
  better idea of what bees are bringing home in their grocery bags. Although
  this work is from one ecosystem in the Rocky Mountains, it paints a very
  important picture for scientists to build upon.” He said the study showed the
  “huge amount” of variation in macronutrients in natural ecosystems and how
  bees’ nutrient needs are not “one-size-fits-all”. CaraDonna believes the
  findings from the research can provide “some of the best information” on the
  availability of nutritional resources found in wildflowers and how pollinators
  use these resources. “We can incorporate this work into our thinking about
  garden design, so we can select the right flowers that best support the
  nutritional needs of wild pollinators.” Global pollinator populations continue
  to face threats of habitat loss, the climate crisis and poor nutrition. The
  authors said the study highlighted the need for conservation efforts to focus
  on nutritional diversity. This would ensure that the mixes of plants that
  support the dietary needs of wild bumblebee species continue to exist. Michael
  Walsh, the founder of The Urban Apiarist, who was not involved in the study
  said the “fascinating” research proves that bees do not forage randomly. Walsh
  believes the study further evidences the “remarkable” way bees solve problems
  as a colony. “Bees show a kind of collective intelligence. Studies like this
  show how specialised and vulnerable bees are. We need to protect both bees and
  their ecosystems – our food systems depend on them.”
