  Texas Democrats, fresh off encouragement from Barack Obama, are poised to
  return to their state as Governor Greg Abbott formally called a second special
  session to address redistricting on Friday. Abbott issued the proclamation for
  the special session, set to begin at noon local time on Friday, just two hours
  after lawmakers formally adjourned the first one. Democrats have spent nearly
  two weeks away from the state, denying Republicans a quorum to conduct
  legislative business and pass new congressional maps. “Special Session #2
  begins immediately,” Abbott said in a post on X. “There is critical work that
  is left undone. Texas will not back down from this fight. That’s why I am
  calling them back today to finish the job.” Earlier on Friday, the speaker of
  the Texas house of representatives, Dustin Burrows, ended the first special
  session. “Do not go very far, as I believe our governor will be calling us
  back for another special session very, very soon,” he said just before hearing
  the motion to adjourn. Obama spoke to the Texas Democrats via video on
  Thursday, praising them for fighting against the redistricting plan. He told
  them they should return to Texas “feeling invigorated” and with the knowledge
  that they helped lead what will be a long fight. Former attorney general Eric
  Holder also joined the call. “We can’t let a systematic assault on democracy
  just happen and stand by and so because of your actions, because of your
  courage, what you’ve seen is California responding, other states looking at
  what they can do to offset this mid-decade gerrymandering,” he said, according
  to ABC News. Abbott has pledged he will call consecutive special sessions
  until Democrats have returned. More than 50 Democrats left the state last
  month in order to deny a quorum in the legislature after Republicans announced
  plans to redraw the state’s congressional maps, at the request of Donald
  Trump, in order to gain five Republican seats. Gene Wu, the chair of the Texas
  Democratic caucus, said in a statement on Thursday that Democrats would return
  as long as the first special session adjourned on Friday and California
  introduced its own new congressional map to offset the gains by Republicans.
  California was set to unveil its new map on Friday. The plan will reportedly
  make three districts currently represented by Republicans into safe Democratic
  ones, according to the Washington Post and Punchbowl News. It would make two
  additional Republican-held seats more Democratic friendly, though they could
  still be competitive. “Under the advice of legal counsel, Democrats must
  return to Texas to build a strong public legislative record for the upcoming
  legal battle against a map that violates both the current Voting Rights Act
  and the Constitution,” the Texas Democratic caucus said in a statement. At
  least one Texas house member, Ann Johnson of Houston, said she was returning
  to Texas. “I am proud of what we accomplished,” she said in a statement. “We
  ended a session that had nothing to do with helping Texans and everything to
  do with silencing them. And we exposed the truth behind the governor’s
  political agenda: to hijack the maps, erase opposition and decide the next
  election before a single vote is cast. “Now, with that session behind us, I’m
  returning to Texas to continue the fight – from the floor of the house.”
  Republicans already represent voters in 25 of the state’s 38 congressional
  districts. Abbott called a special session last month to redraw the map to add
  five Republican seats, and the new map, unveiled at the end of July, would do
  just that. Republicans hold a three-seat majority in the US House and are
  seeking to add seats ahead of next year’s midterm elections, when the
  incumbent president’s party typically does not perform well. Texas Republicans
  have been trying to ratchet up the pressure on Democrats to return to the
  state, seeking to cut off funding for their travel and filing long-shot legal
  bids to have them removed from office. The Texas effort comes as Newsom plans
  to push ahead with an effort to redraw his state’s congressional map to add
  five additional Democratic seats there. Newsom will need to get California
  voters to approve his proposal through a referendum this fall because
  California’s constitution requires redistricting to be done through an
  independent redistricting commission. On Thursday, he called on state
  lawmakers to approve the ballot measure. Republicans are expected to push
  ahead with efforts to redraw maps to add seats in Ohio, Florida, Missouri and
  potentially Indiana.
