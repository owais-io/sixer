  Thousands of fans lined the streets of Birmingham to watch Ozzy Osbourne make
  his final journey through his home city, with his tearful family laying
  tributes as crowds chanted the late singer’s name. A hearse carrying Osbourne,
  who died last week aged 76, made its way through the city centre on Wednesday
  afternoon on the way to his private funeral. The procession stopped on “Black
  Sabbath Bridge”, where his family members placed roses among the hundreds of
  tributes left for the heavy metal pioneer in front of a bench depicting the
  band. A visibly emotional Sharon Osbourne, the singer’s wife of 43 years, was
  aided by her children, Aimee, Kelly and Jack, as she tearfully took in the sea
  of tributes and signalled a peace sign to the crowd before leaving. They were
  joined by a number of family members, including some of Osbourne’s
  grandchildren who waved to the crowds offering their support. People could be
  seen leaning out of windows and climbing on top of walls and bus stops to
  catch a glimpse of the Prince of Darkness’s funeral cortege. His coffin began
  its journey in Aston, in the north of the city, passing Osbourne’s childhood
  home on Lodge Road and the football stadium Villa Park, where he performed in
  a huge farewell concert with his Black Sabbath bandmates just weeks ago.
  People chanted his name, held up rock hand gestures and threw roses at the
  hearse carrying his coffin adorned with purple flowers spelling out “Ozzy”. A
  local brass band, Bostin Brass, played songs including Black Sabbath’s Iron
  Man ahead of the procession of vehicles. In an interview in 2011, Osbourne
  said he didn’t care what music was played at his funeral as long as it was “a
  celebration, not a mope-fest”, and the atmosphere along Broad Street seemed to
  reflect his wishes. Will Howell, an 18-year-old student, said Osbourne was “a
  legend, so you know, you gotta go and say goodbye to him”. He said: “I got up
  at six in the morning to go to work, to come here early so I could get here
  and see it.” He had been listening to Osbourne’s music since his dad
  introduced it to him aged eight. “Probably not the best age,” he said. “Ozzy
  changed music a lot, even inside of metal, and I think it’s just good to say
  goodbye to him.” Paul Allen, 58, a musician from Birmingham, said Osbourne was
  “a great ambassador” for the city. “He was obviously a flawed character, and
  we’re all flawed characters aren’t we?” he said. “It just goes to show you
  that you can still make something of your life, even though you’ve got these
  flaws. “He was one of life’s characters, really. They’re all dying off. It’s
  heartbreaking. I can’t believe he’s gone.” He said he missed Osbourne’s final
  concert as he was abroad. “It was one of those times when you think there’ll
  probably be another time. We didn’t expect him to pass away. He’s had more
  comebacks than a boomerang,” he said. Will Taylor, a musician from
  Chesterfield, said it was a “no-brainer” to come to the city to watch the
  funeral procession with his wife and dog. He is a massive fan of Black Sabbath
  and of Osbourne’s collaborations with the American guitarist Randy Rhoads, who
  died in a plane crash while on tour with Osbourne in 1982. “A bit of me thinks
  if there’s something after death then Ozzy is with Rhoads looking down
  wherever they are,” he said. Osbourne was the lead singer of Black Sabbath,
  who formed in Birmingham in 1968 and were widely credited with defining and
  popularising heavy metal music. Earlier this year Osbourne and his bandmates –
  Terence “Geezer” Butler, Tony Iommi and Bill Ward – were given the freedom of
  the city of Birmingham to recognise their “exceptional service to the city”.
  Osbourne’s health had declined in recent years and he was diagnosed with
  Parkinson’s disease in 2019. He appeared for a surprise performance at the
  Commonwealth Games closing ceremony in Birmingham in 2022 and performed his
  last gig on 5 July, a farewell concert at Villa Park featuring global metal
  stars such as Anthrax, Metallica and Guns N’ Roses.
