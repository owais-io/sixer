  Joe Kent-Walters is Frankie Monroe: Dead!!! (Good Fun Time) review – garish
  grins
sectionName: Stage

bodyText: >-
  With his painted face and demonic demeanour, Joe Kent-Walters’ alter ego
  Frankie Monroe has been compared to the League of Gentlemen’s Papa Lazarou.
  It’s Lazarus he more resembles in this follow-up to last year’s debut, which
  won Kent-Walters a best newcomer award. In Live!!!, the monstrous MC of a
  Rotherham working men’s club was dragged to hell after the expiry of his pact
  with Satan. In Dead!!!, he rises again, after a stint as entertainment officer
  in the underworld, to reclaim his club from a scarier foe than the devil
  himself: gentrification. That’s the premise for a show that doubles down on,
  rather than develops, the formula that hit paydirt for the Huddersfield man
  last summer. And why not? Kent-Walters has devised something outrageously
  funny and bizarre here, a charismatic ghoul of an alter ego, terrorising his
  audience with a series of crap cabaret acts, delivered in a voice as deep and
  gravelly as a quarry in the bowels of hell. He appears in fewer guises this
  time, but his tatty ventriloquist’s doll, Mucky Little Pup, returns, and
  Kent-Walters swaps jackets to star as the usurper of Frankie’s club, Vegas
  Dave, too. More scally than yuppie, Dave – from loathed Lancashire – is
  nevertheless taking the Misty Moon upmarket (“schooner of creme fraiche for
  you, madam?”) Can our (anti)hero escape the clutches of Beelzebub and save the
  day? If that’s to happen, we must help: Kent-Walters embroils his audience in
  every set-piece here, whether that’s trading blows with Frankie’s “gammon
  hammer”, judging his gameshow Wine or Brine?, or singing along with his
  demented ditties (“I’m on me ’olidays”; “Egg in a bag”) – which in their
  gleefully aggressive idiocy summon, to comedy fans of my generation, Alexei
  Sayle’s blunt earworm ’Ullo John! Gotta New Motor? It’s garish, ridiculous and
  chaotic in all the best ways, with our full-throttle host delivering one
  did-I-just-see-that? image after another – none wilder than the skit he
  performs with a mouthful of vegetables – and some choice gags, too, like the
  one imagining The Iron Lady as a Marvel movie. Happy to report after the
  success of Kent-Walters Live!!!, death very much becomes him. At CabVol1 at
  Monkey Barrel, Edinburgh, until 24 August All our Edinburgh festival reviews
