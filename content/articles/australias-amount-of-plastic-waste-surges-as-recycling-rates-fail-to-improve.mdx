  Plastics recycling rates in Australia have flatlined as the amount of waste
  continues to grow, the latest government data reveals. Australians produced
  3.2m tonnes of plastic waste in 2023-24, up from 3m tonnes the previous year,
  according to Australian plastics flows and fates data released on Friday.
  About 39% of the nation’s plastic waste was from packaging. The data,
  collected since 2000, showed the total amount of plastic waste had doubled
  since 2005 (from 1.57m tonnes) but recycling rates had barely shifted despite
  investments in increased capacity. Sign up: AU Breaking News email In 2023-24
  the plastics recovery rate was 14.1% compared with 14.7% in 2005, with the
  majority of material still being sent to landfill. “We can’t recycle our way
  out of this,” said Gayle Sloan, the chief executive of the Waste Management
  and Resource Recovery Association of Australia. “It’s a supply chain
  challenge, not just a waste challenge. “If you don’t design well and you don’t
  buy back, we cannot solve this.” Despite promises from the government since
  2023, Sloan said Australia had still not moved on mandatory design or recycled
  content standards. According to the data, of the 446,000 tonnes of plastics
  diverted from landfill in 2023-24, about two-thirds were recycled in Australia
  and a third (145,000t) exported for processing overseas. About 23,000 tonnes
  of the plastic recovered was sent to energy recovery (where waste was burned
  as a fuel substitute, or used to generate heat or electricity) in 2023-24, a
  figure that could increase in coming years as several states pursued
  waste-to-energy projects. Plastic consumption was also increasing. Australians
  used 4m tonnes of plastic products and packaging in 2023-24 – equivalent to
  146kg per person – up from 3.9m tonnes the previous year. The largest source
  was due to product packaging, responsible for about 1m tonnes of new plastic
  each year. Other large plastic users included the built environment (18%),
  electrical (9%) and clothing (8%). Almost all of the plastics used in
  Australia were imported in the form of products and packaging, or as new
  plastic resins. On Monday, the environment minister, Murray Watt, reaffirmed
  Australia’s commitment to tackling plastic waste, after countries failed to
  reach agreement on a treaty to end plastic pollution in Geneva. “By boosting
  recycling capability with our state and territory partners through investments
  in new recycling infrastructure, we’re making real progress in recovering
  materials that would otherwise go to landfill,” Watt said. “On top of this,
  we’re continuing to work with states and territories to phase out problematic
  single-use plastics and transforming Australia’s packaging regulations.” The
  new data comes as a University of NSW study reviewed the extent of
  microplastic pollution in Australia – in indoor air, road dust, and freshwater
  and marine ecosystems. While further research was needed, the study found
  microplastics posed a significant threat to human health, biodiversity and
  ecosystems, and recommended steps to limit plastic pollution. The report
  recommended laws to minimise the amount of plastics in products, a ban on the
  use of soft plastics in restaurants and home kitchens, restrictions on
  microbeads in personal care, cosmetics and cleaning products, and the
  introduction of an extended responsibility scheme.
