  The remains of homes believed to have been lived in by working-class people
  around the time of the early Roman empire have been found by workers building
  an underground station in the city’s historic centre. The relics are the first
  to emerge from beneath the bustling Piazza Venezia since work began in 2023 on
  the station that will form part of the Italian capital’s Metro C underground
  line. The ambitious project at Piazza Venezia, which will also feature an
  85-metre deep underground museum stuffed with archaeological objects found
  during construction, is forecast to be completed in nine years. Archaeological
  experts said the structure appeared to resemble a multistorey complex that
  would have contained shops and homes lived in by imperial Rome’s working
  class, between the late Roman republic and early empire – a period spanning
  the second and first centuries BC. “Once again, the construction of a metro
  station makes us rediscover our city’s past,” said Daniela Porro, Rome’s
  special superintendent. The archaeologist Marta Baumgartner said the discovery
  “represents an extraordinary opportunity to learn about the historical
  topography of central Rome”. A station at Piazza Venezia was first envisaged
  25 years ago as part of the extension of Metro C, a line which connects Rome’s
  suburbs with San Giovanni in the centre. But progress was stalled by
  corruption inquiries and a lack of funding but also the huge number of relics,
  including the remains of Emperor Hadrian’s auditorium, which emerged during
  initial preparation works. New funding revived the project, with Metro C’s
  extension – a joint construction between Webuild and Vianini Lavori –
  including stops at the Roman Forum-Colosseum before arriving at Piazza Venezia
  and heading towards the area of the Vatican. The line’s extension is intended
  to help relieve central Rome’s traffic-clogged streets, with the museum at
  Piazza Venezia showcasing its rich archaeological past. The sprawling station
  will include 27 escalators, six elevators and corridors connecting the
  above-ground Palazzo Venezia, from where the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini
  made some of his most famous speeches, the Vittoriano and the ruins of the
  Roman Forum.
