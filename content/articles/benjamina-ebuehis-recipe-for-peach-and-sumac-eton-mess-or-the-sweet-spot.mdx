  It’s not a British summer without a generous serving (or two) of a creamy,
  fruity, meringue dessert. While pavlova is often my go-to, I also like the
  more relaxed, throw-together nature of Eton mess. I’ve given it my own spin
  here by using a brown sugar meringue, which adds a gorgeous, caramel flavour
  and makes all the difference compared with shop-bought shells. Macerate the
  peaches in sumac and lime, whip up some cream and yoghurt, then pile it all
  high on a pretty platter for a perfect pud for a crowd. Peach and sumac Eton
  mess Prep 5 min Macerate 20 min Cook 2 hr Cool 2 hr+ Serves 10-12 For the
  meringue 60g caster sugar 120g light brown sugar 3 egg whites (about 120g) For
  the filling 4 ripe peaches 30g caster sugar Juice of ½ lime 1 tsp sumac 250ml
  double cream 150g greek yoghurt 2 tsp icing sugar ½ tsp vanilla bean paste
  Fresh mint, to finish Heat the oven to 120C (100C fan)/250F/gas ½ and line a
  large baking tray with greaseproof paper. Mix the caster and light brown
  sugars in a small bowl and set aside. Put the egg whites in the bowl of a
  stand mixer and whisk on medium-low until they turn frothy. Turn up the speed
  to medium-high, then beat in the sugar mixture a tablespoon at a time. Once
  you have a stiff and glossy meringue, spoon tablespoon-sized dollops of it on
  to the lined tray, then bake for 80-90 minutes, until the meringues are firm
  to the touch and the paper peels off easily. Turn off the oven and leave the
  meringues inside for a few hours (overnight is best) with the door closed
  until they have cooled completely. Stone the peaches, then slice them all into
  eighths and put in a bowl with the sugar, lime juice and sumac. Stir gently to
  coat, then leave to macerate for at least 20 minutes. When you’re ready to
  serve, put the cream, yoghurt, icing sugar and vanilla in a bowl and whip to
  soft peaks. Break up half of the meringues and fold the pieces into the cream
  mix. Spoon half the mixture on to a platter and top with more broken meringue
  and some peach slices. Repeat with the remaining cream and meringue, then top
  with the remaining peaches and any juices from the peach bowl. Finish with a
  few fresh mint leaves and serve immediately.
