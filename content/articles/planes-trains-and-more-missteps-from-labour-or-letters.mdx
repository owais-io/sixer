  Polly Toynbee rightly advocates greener rail travel over the greater
  environmental damage caused by airliners (Pushing airport expansion while rail
  travel languishes – so much for Labour’s green agenda, 5 August). Alas, the
  same government that has authorised a massive expansion of Heathrow airport
  has also just pulled the plug on completing the electrification of the Midland
  Main Line from London to Nottingham, Derby and Sheffield. By my reckoning,
  this is the third time the scheme has been abandoned partway through. It will
  ensure that four diesel trains an hour will be plying the route for the
  foreseeable future, adding to air quality issues and consuming more fossil
  fuels. The overhead wiring for the electric trains currently ends in the
  middle of nowhere a few miles south of Leicester. New trains being built for
  the route are bi-mode – that is, equally capable of operating on diesel or
  electric power. It’s all a huge waste – and more proof that, when it comes to
  investing in the north, the money always runs out. Alan Whitehouse Silkstone
  Common, South Yorkshire • Polly Toynbee is correct to assert the advantages of
  rail versus flying, especially for domestic journeys. She does not mention the
  big drawback of the current UK rail system – unreliability. I live in
  Aberdeenshire and have family in Birmingham and London. I have given up on
  using the train to visit family because on many occasions my train has not
  reached its destination because of cancellations of connections or driver
  shortages. I now reluctantly fly to Birmingham and London from Aberdeen. I
  will return to rail (my preferred option) when I can be sure of reaching my
  destination. Dr Nick Williams Auchenblae, Aberdeenshire • Living as I do
  adjacent to the flight path to Manchester airport, I would of course welcome
  any reduction in non-essential air travel. But more Eurostar journeys are of
  little relevance to anyone living outside the south-east because of the cost
  and time involved in getting to St Pancras. But here’s an idea. Now we have an
  integrated rail network, why not adapt the Interrail idea of allowing the cost
  of the journey to and from the home station to St Pancras to be covered by the
  standard Eurostar fare? That would incentivise the use of rail travel to
  Europe for all of those who currently fly because there is no practical
  alternative. Michael Reardon Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester • Polly Toynbee
  is so right in her analysis of the case against the Heathrow third runway. If
  our only hope of stopping them is Boris Johnson indeed lying down in front of
  those bulldozers, we are doomed. Margaret Squires St Andrews, Fife •
  International Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways, is implying that
  the cost of a third runway at Heathrow will be so expensive that it can’t be
  done without public subsidy (Heathrow’s third runway ‘is going to be empty’ if
  it means high fees, says BA owner, 1 August). As air travel comes bottom in
  the hierarchy of sustainable transport to meet our climate obligations, and
  the last thing Londoners need is more plane noise and air pollution, I can’t
  think of a single reason for rescuing this venture, particularly as so many
  other parts of the UK are in urgent need of investment in better rail
  infrastructure. Jenny Rathbone MS Senedd member for Cardiff Central • Have an
