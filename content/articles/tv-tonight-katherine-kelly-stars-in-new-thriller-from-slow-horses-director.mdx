  In Flight 9pm, Channel 4 Katherine Kelly is a dodgy flight attendant in this
  crime thriller by Mike Walden (Marcella) and Adam Randall (Slow Horses). She
  plays Jo, a single mum, who is well respected by her colleagues. But things
  take a dark turn when her teenage son, Sonny (Harry Cadby), is arrested for
  murder in Sofia. As well as trying to raise cash for lawyers to prove his
  innocence, she needs to deal with a threat to his life in prison – and that
  involves smuggling drugs for the criminal underworld. Hollie Richardson The
  Big Pound Shop Swap 8pm, Channel 4 This frothy new series sees Denise van
  Outen challenge a family to survive for a week using only bargain-store
  products, from food to toiletries. First up are the Phillips clan from Kent,
  who usually rely on Sainsbury’s and Ocado for their groceries. Can they put
  together a decent meal plan when fresh veg is in such short supply? Graeme
  Virtue The Great British Sewing Bee 9pm, BBC One Things get personal in
  reduce, reuse and recycle week, as the sewers use garments worn by family
  members and friends to create something new. One family’s collection of
  Christmas pyjamas is reworked as a party dress, and another clan’s collections
  of jeans are turned into a jumpsuit. HR Pompeii: Life in the City With Dan
  Snow 9pm, Channel 5 Et tu, Gluteus? The ever-enthusiastic Snow does an ancient
  Roman workout this week, before bigging up Pompeii’s party credentials of yore
  (“the French Riviera, Ibiza, Blackpool, Brighton, Vegas – all rolled into
  one!”) Meanwhile, fellow historian Kate Lister gets the short straw, as she
  samples a yeasty wine cake. Hannah J Davies Confessions of a Steroid Gang 9pm,
  BBC Three “It’s like Breaking Bad … only in north Wales.” This three-part
  documentary tells the story of a father and son who started an illegal steroid
  empire (the biggest in the UK) and earned millions – until they were busted
  and convicted. They are undeniably great storytellers and their testimonies
  are convincingly told through actors. HR Resident Alien 10pm, Sky Max Harry
  busts out of the Greys’ moonbase as season four opens – but his troubles are
  just beginning. A shape-shifting Mantid has been impersonating him back on
  Earth, and on his return he finds he is stuck in human form. There’s also an
  abducted baby alien to hide, while the Mantid gets inappropriate with Asta.
  Ali Catterall Live sport The Hundred Cricket: Birmingham Phoenix Women v Oval
  Invincibles Women, 2.45pm, BBC Two The men’s game follows at 6pm.
