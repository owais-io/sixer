  Southampton have rejected a £27m bid from Everton for Tyler Dibling, leaving
  the Merseyside club to consider an improved offer to land the England Under-21
  international. The 19-year-old was one of the few pluses in a troubled season
  for the relegated club and has attracted interest from Aston Villa, Fulham and
  West Ham. He has two years remaining on his contract at St Mary’s Stadium and
  is believed to be open to a move to Merseyside. Everton have endured a
  frustrating summer in the transfer market, particularly in their attempts to
  improve their options out wide. David Moyes has missed out on Francisco
  Conceição, who joined Juventus from Porto, and RB Leipzig’s recent signing
  from PSV Eindhoven, Johan Bakayoko. Another target, Lyon’s Malick Fofana,
  would prefer to join a club offering Champions League football. Moyes has
  struggled to fill his bench with established players during Everton’s
  pre-season tour of the United States, where his team have lost to West Ham and
  Bournemouth. The club have made four signings so far this summer but have lost
  nine members of last season’s first-team squad. Everton are expected to
  increase their offer for Dibling.
