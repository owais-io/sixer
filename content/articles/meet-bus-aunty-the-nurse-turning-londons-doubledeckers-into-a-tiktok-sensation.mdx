  To her nearly 300,000 TikTok followers, she is Bus Aunty, the unlikely star of
  short videos that celebrate London’s streets and, above all, its
  doubledeckers. Now Bemi Orojuogun, 56, has urged her army of fans to share her
  appreciation for the hard-working bus drivers who keep the capital running.
  The mental health nurse has been overwhelmed by the response to the quirky,
  bite-size videos she began posting on social media last year. They feature
  clips of her standing at the roadside, sometimes at landmarks such as
  Trafalgar Square and Piccadilly Circus, as buses drive past. “My love for
  London red buses started a long time ago, when I first came to this country in
  the early 90s,” said Orojuogun, who is from Nigeria. “There are four parts of
  London that I really, really love: red buses, red telephone booths, all the
  London bridges and Big Ben. But buses are main my love.” She showcased this
  enthusiasm last March, posting a video of a 241 bus driving past her in
  Plaistow, east London. For Orojuogun, there was nothing unusual about the
  video but it quickly racked up millions of views when it was shared worldwide.
  “I received a call from my daughter saying: ‘Mummy, you’re going viral’,”
  Orojuogun said. “I loved the way young people really liked the video, their
  comments and the way they were reposting it, and then I did more of it. Some
  of them love to guess where I’ll be going next and suggest where I should
  visit next, and that’s how it all started.” Orojuogun’s most popular video has
  amassed 48.1m views. The one-minute clip shows her standing in front of a bus
  stop in Greenwich as a series of buses drive past her to the soundtrack of
  Back for Good by Take That. “It’s still all a dream and a shock to me,” she
  said of the popularity of her videos. “A lot of celebrities have been in my
  DMs, congratulating me, telling me they’re proud of me. But not only that, I’m
  so glad the way social media has accepted me, the way they have come behind me
  and supported me.” Orojuogun rarely speaks in her videos, instead beaming into
  the camera with her distinctive glasses, colourful headscarves and dangly
  earrings. She often appears perilously close to the kerb, leading some viewers
  to fear she may be standing in the road. But she insists it is all in the
  camera angles and she is always on the pavement. Her popularity has landed her
  advertising deals with Transport for London, Ikea and Burberry, which
  described her in a campaign last month as “our fare lady”. But her motivation
  for posting videos remains her love of the capital and its buses which she
  said allowed her to get to work during the pandemic. “I love those buses,” she
  said. “Since Covid, the buses have been my main means of travelling, from home
  to work, shopping, everywhere. London is a beautiful place to see from the top
  of the bus. That’s my belief. I love it. And those red buses, take it from me,
  they represent London. I just wish we loved them a bit more. I wish people
  could love them the way I do.” Orojuogun is using her platform to encourage
  her followers and the wider public to value bus drivers. Through her accounts,
  she has befriended some and even had lunch with them. “We need to appreciate
  those bus drivers,” she said. “I’m sure you quite remember during Covid, a lot
  of them died. I think a lot of us, we go on buses and we just take them for
  granted, ‘just take me from A to Z’. “There’s nothing wrong with saying ‘good
  morning’, ‘good afternoon’, or ‘thank you’ when you get out of the bus. That’s
  just my view. Since I started going around London, I meet so many of them, we
  get into conversations, and I love them and I think they’re doing a fantastic
  job.”
