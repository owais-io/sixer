  ‘I’ve got a gun.” Nice to be pitched, with that opening line, straight into a
  show declaring itself different from the others. Zainab Johnson’s maiden
  fringe set – although she’s already a big noise in the US – gives an account
  of how she came to own a firearm. It’s not an explicitly political show – if a
  show about gun ownership by a black, Muslim, American female is allowed to be
  anything but. But Toxically Optimistic does invite engagement with some
  searching questions about guns, their use, and the safety they supposedly
  ensure – even if, so poised is Johnson’s delivery, you barely notice it doing
  so. Hers is that particularly American style of standup that can feel too
  polished for UK tastes: smiling, slick and a little bit frictionless. If a
  British comedian tells a dating story, you can bet they’ll be the butt of the
  joke; when Johnson does, it’s to lord it over the short guy who wants but
  can’t have her. Small wonder she is, by her own account, an eternal optimist –
  even if that quality is now to be tested when a friend tells her, apropos of
  her buying her own house, that she should acquire a gun without delay. Is that
  so? Johnson resists, and keeps resisting, even when her friend drags her to a
  shooting range, even when she imagines the home invasion scenario that might
  make a gun worthwhile. She asks herself questions about fear, with reference
  to an odd anecdote about a homeless man and a “bucket of shit”, and about
  safety, which has arguably been secured, but at what cost? Delivered with
  authority by the Harlem comic, the tone is smooth and philosophical, with the
  safety catch coming off only occasionally – see the excellent joke explaining
  why she takes notes when out on a first date. The show’s final quarter pivots
  to a different subject entirely – and a less compelling one, too,
  notwithstanding that Johnson justifies it persuasively with a take-that reveal
  at the end. If you didn’t know she was armed and dangerous before, that fine
  flourish of an ending proves it. • At Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 24
  August • All our Edinburgh festival reviews
