  Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder medication is linked to significantly
  lower risk of suicidal behaviours, substance misuse, transport accidents and
  criminality, according to a study of the wider outcomes of treatment. The
  research, based on the medical records of nearly 150,000 people in Sweden,
  suggested that the drugs could have meaningful benefits beyond helping with
  the core symptoms of ADHD. Although the study was not a randomised trial – and
  so cannot definitively prove that medication caused improved outcomes – it
  adds to evidence of the substantial value of treatment. “We found that ADHD
  medication was associated with significantly reduced rates of first
  occurrences of suicidal behaviours, substance misuse, transport accidents and
  criminality,” said Prof Samuele Cortese, a child and adolescent psychiatrist
  and researcher at the University of Southampton. “Our results should inform
  the debate on the effects and safety of ADHD medications.” After accounting
  for factors including age, sex, education level, psychiatric diagnoses and
  medical history, ADHD medication was associated with reduced rates of a first
  occurrence of four of the five outcomes investigated: a 17% reduction for
  suicidal behaviour, 15% for substance misuse, 12% for transport accidents and
  13% for criminality. It is well established that ADHD, thought to affect about
  5% of children and 2.5% of adults worldwide, is linked to higher rates of
  mental health problems including suicide, substance misuse and accidental
  injuries. People with ADHD are also disproportionately represented within the
  criminal justice system. Randomised clinical trials have demonstrated that for
  many patients, medication can help alleviate hyperactivity, impulsivity and
  the inattention. But there has been more limited evidence on whether these
  improvements translate into benefits in everyday life, at a time when the
  increasing number of people being diagnosed has fuelled a debate about the
  possibility of “overdiagnosis”. The number of prescriptions being issued in
  England for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication has
  risen by 18% year on year since the pandemic. The latest study, which the
  researchers say is the largest and most rigorous of its kind, used Swedish
  national registers from 2007 to 2020 to examine the effects of ADHD drug
  treatment in 148,581 individuals aged six to 64 years with a new diagnosis of
  ADHD. The team used a technique called target trial emulation, which aims to
  apply the design principles of a clinical trial to existing medical records
  through the use of strict inclusion criteria, follow-up timeframes and the use
  of statistical techniques to compensate for the fact that people were not
  randomly assigned to “treatment” or “placebo” arms. Dr Zheng Chang, an
  epidemiologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and senior author of
  the research, said: “It’s now considered one of the most rigorous methods for
  analysing observational data. However, since we don’t have the real
  randomisation data it is not bias-proof.” Of the 148,581 individuals with ADHD
  (average age 17 years, 41% female), 84,282 (57%) started drug treatment for
  ADHD, with methylphenidate being the most common. After adjusting for
  potential confounding factors, those who took medication had a reduced risk of
  first occurrence of suicidal behaviour, substance misuse, transport accidents
  and criminality, although there was no significant risk reduction for a first
  occurrence of accidental injury. Among people with recurrent events, there
  were statistically significant reductions linked to all five outcomes, the
  paper in the British Medical Journal reports. “When clinicians discuss the
  possible use of medication with families, oftentimes there is not a focus on
  what are the risks if you don’t treat,” said Cortese. “If left untreated,
  there will be unfortunately some risk. Now we have evidence that medication
  can reduce this risk.” Prof Adam Guastella, of the Children’s Hospital
  Westmead Clinical School at the University of Sydney, said: “Such benefits
  have been shown repeatedly in previous studies, but the large sample size, use
  of a national registry, and more sophisticated analysis give greater
  confidence in these results that findings aren’t explained by something else
  other than medication use. “People should know that if ADHD medications work
  for them and their child, that there will likely be many other positive
  impacts on life from treatment. Such effects will not work for everyone and
  there is still a need to understand why many individuals benefit from ADHD
  medication and some do not.”
