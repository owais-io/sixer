  A pro-Palestine fundraising gig planned at a Newcastle pub on Friday night was
  cancelled after police warned a “credible threat” had been made against the
  venue – but organisers say they have been left in the dark. The Palestine
  Action Group Muloobinba (PAGM) has accused police of “bullying tactics” after
  the cancellation of the Make Some Noise charity event at the Hamilton Station
  hotel, from which all proceeds were meant to go towards aid for Gaza. The
  hotel announced the cancellation on Facebook on Thursday, saying it was
  “disappointed”, but “NSW police have advised us of credible threats made
  against the venue, and we must proceed in the interest of the safety of our
  staff and customers”. The pub’s licensee, Dan Southam, told Guardian Australia
  the venue was “approached by multiple police” on Thursday “with a credible
  threat to the venue in direct relation to the event on Friday”. “Advice from
  police was cancel the event,” he said. “The safety of our staff and patrons is
  our priority.” Police had said earlier on Friday they spoke with the operators
  “in light of online comments” but insisted any decision about a private event
  lay with the venue and not the police. One of the fundraiser’s organisers,
  Regan Dubois, said the venue contacted the PAGM on Thursday to say they had
  been visited by the police officer they regularly dealt with for licensing
  matters. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “The police apparently said they had
  received a report of a credible threat if the event was to go ahead and they
  were suggesting that for safety reasons they cancel the event,” Dubois said.
  Dubois claimed this was the PAGM’s second event in a week that police had
  played a role in shutting down. She said the group had planned to host a film
  screening on 26 July at a local church, but police had contacted its owners
  and said “they couldn’t be sure it was legal to show a documentary”. “They’re
  trying to shut down the event, without even notifying organisers that the
  threat even exists,” she said. “It’s a pattern.” Dubois said the PAGM had not
  directly received any threats and Hamilton Station hotel staff had said the
  venue hadn’t either. “We clarified with the venue … it’s coming via police,”
  she said. “It’s completely unprofessional and inappropriate that, if the
  threat is credible, [the police] haven’t contacted the community that is being
  threatened.” In a post to Facebook, the PAGM said it believed the police were
  using “bullying tactics”, alleging a “precedent” with similarly cancelled
  pro-Palestine events. Police declined to comment further when asked about
  Dubois’ concerns. Dubois said she understood why the hotel, as a small
  business, would be wary about any safety risks, but she questioned the
  police’s actions. “I assume they could do more. I don’t know what they’re
  doing because I’ve had no contact with police,” she said. “If it is a serious
  threat, it should be under serious investigation. “Police could also be doing
  a different thing – instead of shutting down the event, they could be
  protecting the event.” Dubois said the organisers were working to move the
  event to another venue but had been worried about advertising it because “we
  don’t understand the nature of the threat to us”. “Is it anti-Palestinian? Is
  it Islamophobic? The main speaker for the night is Jewish,” she said.
