  Australia

  The former pro-democracy Hong Kong legislator Ted Hui, who is wanted by
  authorities in the Chinese city, has been granted asylum in Australia, he said
  in a social media post, calling on Canberra to do more for those who remain
  jailed. The special administrative region, handed back to China by the UK in
  1997, has seen dissent quashed since Beijing imposed a sweeping national
  security law following huge and at times violent pro-democracy protests that
  erupted in 2019. Hui, a high-profile participant at the time who has since
  resettled in Adelaide where he works as a solicitor, said the Australian
  government had granted him a protection visa, with asylum also extending to
  his wife, children and parents. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “I express my
  sincere gratitude to the government of Australia – both present and former –
  for recognising our need for asylum and granting us this protection,” he said
  in a Facebook post on Saturday. A vocal critic of Hong Kong and Beijing
  authorities, Hui is among several overseas activists targeted in 2023 by
  police bounties of HK$1m each (A$196,000). The bounties, which western
  countries have criticised, are considered largely symbolic given they affect
  people living abroad in nations unlikely to extradite political activists to
  Hong Kong or China. Earlier this year, an anonymous letter sent to Hui’s
  Adelaide office offered his colleagues $203,000 for information on his
  whereabouts and his family. Fake pamphlets falsely accusing Hui of being a
  pro-Israel lawyer willing to “wage war” against Islamic terrorism were also
  allegedly mailed to mosques in Adelaide in an apparent attempt to intimidate
  him. In his Facebook post, Hui urged the Australian government not to forget
  other Hong Kong activists who remained jailed, including media mogul Jimmy
  Lai, who has been behind bars since 2020. “Australia must do more to rescue
  them and to speak up for their humanity,” Hui said. “Its stance matters
  internationally, and its protection of Hong Kongers sets a precedent for other
  democracies.” He added that he and his family will “give back to Australia in
  every way we can – through our work, our civic engagement, and our commitment
  to the values of democracy and freedom”. Hong Kong’s government did not
  comment directly on Hui’s case, but a spokesperson said on Saturday those who
  absconded should not think they could evade “criminal liability”. “Any country
  that harbours Hong Kong criminals in any form shows contempt for the rule of
  law, grossly disrespects Hong Kong’s legal systems and barbarically interferes
  in the affairs of Hong Kong,” the spokesperson said. The Australian foreign
  minister, Penny Wong, has previously criticised Hong Kong’s arrest warrants
  and bounties. “Freedom of expression and assembly are essential to our
  democracy,” she said last month on social media. “We have consistently
  expressed our strong objections to China and Hong Kong on the broad and
  extraterritorial application of Hong Kong’s national security legislation, and
  we will continue to do so.” The Department of Home Affairs said it does not
  comment on individual cases due to privacy.
