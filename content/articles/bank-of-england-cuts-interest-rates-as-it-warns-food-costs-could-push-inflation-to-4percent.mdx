  The Bank of England has warned that rising food prices could drive inflation
  to 4% as it voted for a fifth cut in interest rates in a year, amid mounting
  concerns about the strength of the UK economy. In one of its closest decisions
  since its independence more than 25 years ago, the Bank’s monetary policy
  committee (MPC) voted by 5-4 to cut its key base rate by a quarter- point to
  4%. The cut, taking borrowing costs to the lowest level since March 2023, was
  widely expected in financial markets. However, the decision was a close call,
  with the rate-setting panel for the first time in history holding two votes
  before reaching its verdict. Andrew Bailey, the Bank’s governor, said: “We’ve
  cut interest rates today, but it was a finely balanced decision. Interest
  rates are still on a downward path, but any future rate cuts will need to be
  made gradually and carefully.” City investors reacted to the decision by
  sending the pound higher on foreign exchanges, after Bailey warned that
  mounting inflation risks could delay further rate cuts. “I do think the path
  continues to be down … [But] the path has become more uncertain because of
  what we’re seeing,” he said. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, welcomed the cut,
  which will ease some of the financial pressure on borrowers. Pressure is also
  mounting on the government over its management of the economy, and speculation
  is swirling about tax rises in her autumn budget. Ministers have sought to
  claim credit for the Bank’s rate cuts since its first reduction last August,
  with borrowing costs now down from a peak of 5.25%. “The stability we have
  brought to the public finances through our plan for change has helped make
  this [rate cut] possible,” Reeves said on Thursday. However, critics say the
  chancellor’s tax-raising autumn budget has added to the pressure on businesses
  and households amid global uncertainty from Donald Trump’s trade war. In a
  blow to the government, Threadneedle Street said tax rises were contributing
  to rising inflation and unemployment as it sounded the alarm over the
  country’s weak growth prospects. Publishing updated forecasts, the MPC singled
  out fast-rising food prices as it warned that food price inflation was on
  track to reach 5.5% before the end of the year. It attributed much of the rise
  to global factors, including increasingly extreme weather events hitting cocoa
  and coffee harvests, highlighting the dangers from the climate emergency.
  However, it also pointed to “material” rises in employment costs and new
  charges for recycling packaging, both driven by the government, that were
  being passed on to shoppers by UK supermarkets. “In addition to global
  agricultural commodity prices, domestic labour costs are currently an
  important driver of food price inflation,” the Bank said. Business leaders had
  warned that Reeves’s £25bn increase in employer national insurance
  contributions (NICs) and a 6.7% rise in the “national living wage” from April
  would force them to cut jobs and put up prices. Official figures show
  unemployment has crept higher in recent months, while the economy shrank in
  April and May. Inflation has also risen by more than expected, reaching 3.6%
  in June. Facing double-sided risk to the UK economy from weak growth yet
  mounting inflationary pressures, the split MPC decision in favour of cutting
  rates was swung by the external economist Alan Taylor. The independent MPC
  member, who has repeatedly backed deeper cuts in borrowing costs, had first
  voted for a half-point reduction before joining the narrow majority –
  including Bailey – supporting a quarter-point cut. Exposing tensions at the
  heart of Threadneedle Street, the four other members – including the Bank’s
  chief economist, Huw Pill, and one of its deputy governors, Clare Lombardelli
  – voted to keep rates unchanged. Inflation has fallen back substantially in
  the past two and a half years from a peak of more than 11% in late 2022 after
  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. That progress has allowed the Bank to cut rates.
  However, it said lingering inflationary pressures could delay future rate
  cuts. “The MPC judges that the upside risks around medium-term inflationary
  pressures have moved slightly higher since May,” it said.
