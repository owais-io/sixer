  The “worst cholera outbreak in years” has killed at least 40 people in the
  last week in Sudan, according to the medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières.
  Overwhelmed medical centres are resorting to treating patients on mattresses
  on the floor, MSF said, as the country’s two-year civil war aids the spread of
  the disease. Sylvain Penicaud, MSF project coordinator in Tawila, North Darfur
  state, said families in displacement and refugee camps often had no choice but
  to drink dirty water, the main cause of cholera. “Just two weeks ago, a body
  was found in a well inside one of the camps. It was removed, but within two
  days, people were forced to drink from that same water again,” he said.
  Sudan’s cholera outbreak was first confirmed by the Federal Ministry of Health
  a year ago, and there have since been more than 99,700 suspected cases and
  more than 2,470 related deaths. The disease is spreading as people flee
  fighting, and being worsened by heavy rains, which contaminate water and
  overwhelm sewage systems, public health leaders said. The Africa Centres for
  Disease Control and Prevention, the public health agency of the African Union,
  has repeatedly raised concerns about the spread of cholera on the continent,
  which as of May accounted for 60% of cholera cases and 93.5% of related deaths
  globally. Vulnerable and conflict-affected states such as the Democratic
  Republic of the Congo and South Sudan, as well as Sudan, are among the worst
  affected. MSF said its teams in Tawila, working with the local health
  ministry, had treated more than 2,300 cholera patients last month. The
  hospital’s 130-bed treatment centre had to accommodate 400 patients in the
  first week of August. About 380,000 people have arrived in the small town
  since April as they flee fighting around the city of El Fasher and Zamzam
  camp, according to UN records. While the World Health Organization says that
  during an emergency people need at least 7.5 litres of water a day for
  drinking, cooking and hygiene, people in Tawila must survive with an average
  of only three. MSF said water shortages across Darfur made it “impossible to
  follow essential hygiene measures, such as washing dishes and food”. Cholera
  treatment centres in other towns and regions were also being “overwhelmed”, it
  said. “The health centres are full,” said Samia Dahab, a resident of Otash
  displacement camp in Nyala, South Darfur state. “Some areas have water, others
  have kiosks that are far [away] or empty. Some water is salty, and we drink it
  unboiled, unsure if it’s safe.” Tuna Turkmen, MSF’s head of mission in Sudan,
  said the situation was “beyond urgent” and “spreading well beyond displacement
  camps now, into multiple localities across Darfur states and beyond”. In
  neighbouring Chad, 16 deaths and 288 cases were reported in the second week of
  August. Turkmen called for an international response “to provide healthcare,
  improve water and sanitation services, and begin cholera vaccination campaigns
  in affected areas at a pace that matches the urgency this catastrophic
  situation requires”, warning: “Survivors of war must not be left to die from a
  preventable disease.”
