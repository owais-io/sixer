  25% tariff on India – as it happened

  Time to wrap up…. Activity in the UK construction sector fell last month at
  the sharpest rate since the height of the Covid pandemic amid a collapse in
  housebuilding, underscoring the challenge facing the government to meet its
  1.5m new homes target. The figures from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence
  showed activity fell in July at the steepest pace since May 2020, during the
  first UK coronavirus lockdown. The data provider said a sharp drop in
  residential building pulled down its monthly purchasing managers index (PMI)
  for the UK construction sector as a whole, alongside a plunge in civil
  engineering and a softer downturn in commercial property. It’s been another
  day dominated by Donald Trump’s trade wars too, with the White House is
  placing an additional 25% tariff on imports from India. The move brings total
  tariffs up to 50%, in retaliation over the country’s purchase of Russia oil.
  Shares in European pharmaceutical companies have sunk to a near four-month
  low, after Donald Trump repeated his threats to introduce tariffs on drug
  imports “within the next week or so”. Europe’s STOXX Healthcare index has
  dropped to its lowest level since mid-April, shortly after the US president’s
  initial “liberation day” tariff announcements. The Japanese carmaker Honda has
  reported a 50% drop in quarterly profits as it counted the cost of Donald
  Trump’s tariffs and electric vehicle policies, even as it said the full impact
  would be less than its worst expectations. The manufacturer’s operating
  profits fell by half to 244bn yen (£1.2bn) in the three months to June,
  according to financial results published on Wednesday. That was mainly because
  of a 124bn yen hit from tariffs, as well as 113bn yen in losses on electric
  car sales in the US. Elsewhere….OpenAI is reportedly in early talks about a
  sale of shares held by current and former employees that would value it at
  half a trillion dollars, overtaking Elon Musk’s SpaceX. If the transaction
  goes ahead, the value of the ChatGPT developer would rise by about two-thirds,
  from $300bn (£225bn). And…FTSE 100 miner Glencore has decided to retain its
  stock market listing in London, rejecting calls for it to move to the US in a
  boost for the London Stock Exchange. Despite the latest twists in Donald
  Trump’s trade wars, the UK’s stock market has ended the day at a new closing
  high. The FTSE 100 index has cloased 21 points higher at 9164 points, up
  0.24%. Although that’s a closing peak, it’s still below the intraday high of
  9190 hit last week. The top risers were insurer Hiscox (+9.4%), precious
  metals producer Fresnillo (+8.9%), drinks firm Diageo (+4.2%) and BP (+3%).
  Analyst John Kicklighter predicts that the White House’s targeting of Russian
  energy customers will drive up crude oil costs, and also be “a burden on
  India”: The executive order signed by Donald Trump today also leaves open the
  possibility that other countries are hit with higher tariffs for buying
  Russian oil. In it, Trump says: The Secretary of Commerce, in coordination
  with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, and any other
  senior official the Secretary of Commerce deems appropriate, shall determine
  whether any other country is directly or indirectly importing Russian
  Federation oil. Such a country could, like India, face an an additional ad
  valorem tariff of 25% on their imports to the US, the order explains. We also
  have more details about the investment pledge from Apple which Trump economic
  adviser Kevin Hassett mentioned earlier. A White House official has now
  revealed that Apple will announce a domestic manufacturing pledge of $100bn
  today that will focus on bringing more manufacturing to the United States. The
  pledge would be a new financial commitment, the official told Reuters, on
  customary condition of anonymity. The iShares MSCI India ETF, which tracks
  Indian equities, has dropped by 0.5% today as traders react to this new tariff
  hit. Donald Trump’s new executive order has been issued shortly after his
  envoy, Steve Witkoff, met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. Donald
  Trump has followed through on his threat to penalise India for buying energy
  from Russia. The White House has announced that US President Trump has issued
  an executive order imposing an additional 25% tariff on India, for directly or
  indirectly imported Russian oil. Trump says: I determine that it is necessary
  and appropriate to impose an additional ad valorem duty on imports of articles
  of India, which is directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil.
  Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis president Neel Kashkari has suggested it
  could soon be time to start cutting US interest rates. Speaking to CNBC today,
  Kashkari warned that the US economy is slowing, adding: In the near term it
  may become appropriate to start adjusting the federal funds rate. Kashkari
  suggested it might be better for Fed policymakers to act soon, rather than
  wait until the impact of Donald Trump’s trade wars is clearer, arguing: How
  long can we wait until the tariff effects become clear? That’s just weighing
  on me right now. If the best of all the options is we make some adjustments
  and then we have to pause, or even then we have to reverse course, that might
  be better than just sitting here on hold until we get clarity on tariffs. The
  Fed’s FOMC committee left interest rates on hold in July, but has since
  learned that job creation in May and June was much lower than previously
  thought, with hiring weak in July too. Under the rotating seat system operated
  by the Fed, Kashkari doesn’t have a vote on interest rates this year (unless a
  committee member can’t make a vote), but will join the FOMC in 2026. Wall
  Street has opened a little higher, as investors digest the latest earnings
  reports, and weigh up the prospects of interest rate cuts soon. The Dow Jones
  Industrial Average rose 84.9 points, or 0.19%, at the start of trading to
  44,196.61. Apple (+2.5%) are the top riser on the Dow, followed by McDonald’s
  (+1.9%) as traders welcome its pick-up in sales. Disney, though, is down 4%
  despite beating earnings forecasts. The broader S&amp;P 500 index has gained
  10 points, or 0.16%, to 6,309 points, while the tech-focused Nasdaq is up
  almost 0.2%. Sales of Novo Nordisk’s injectable diabetes drugs including
  Ozempic have slowed sharply amid fierce competition and the threat of US
  tariffs, prompting it to cut costs and sharpen its commercial focus. The
  Danish drugmaker, whose booming sales of GLP-1 diabetes and obesity drugs in
  recent years had turned it into Europe’s most valuable company, has lost
  nearly $100bn (£75bn) in market value since cutting its full-year sales
  forecast last week, when its share price slid 30% in its worst week in more
  than two decades. It has fallen a further 3% today… White House economic
  adviser Kevin Hassett has hinted that Apple could make an investment
  announcement today. Hassett dropped the teaser as he discussed the financial
  pledges made by companies and countries under President Donald Trump, in an
  interview with Fox Business Network. Hassett said: “They’re moving here in
  droves. This is trillions and trillions of dollars of commitments for people
  to build new factories here. In fact, you’re likely to see one today from
  Apple.” Back in february, Apple pledged to invest $500bn in the US in the next
  four years that would include a giant factory in Texas for artificial
  intelligence servers… Car hire and food delivery group Uber has announced a
  $20bn share buyback programme, after reporting sales and earnings growth. Uber
  reported 17% growth in gross bookings, year-on-year, to $46.8bn in April-June,
  with income from operations up 82% YoY to $1.5bn. And in a sign of confidence,
  the firm is also planning to spend $20bn buying back some of its stock.
  Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah, Uber’s CFO, says: Today’s announcement of a new
  $20bn share repurchase authorisation underscores our confidence in the
  business, following yet another quarter of strong top- and bottom-line
  performance. Our trailing 12-month free cash flow hit a new all-time high of
  $8.5bn and we remain committed to driving durable, profitable growth. Fast
  food chain McDonald’s has shrugged off economic anxiety, and posted a rise in
  sales in the last quarter. McDonald’s has reported that global comparable
  sales increased by 3.8% in the April-June quarter, with “broad-based growth
  across all segments”. Sales in the US rose by 2.5%, while McDonald’s overseas
  restaurants grew sales by 4%. Bloomberg points out that this ended four
  quarters of weak growth as the burger chain dealt with an E. coli outbreak,
  backlash against American brands in the Middle East and consumer unease about
  the economy in response to President Trump’s trade disputes. Claire’s
  Accessories faces an uncertain future on UK high streets after its US parent
  business filed for bankruptcy. US-based fashion accessories and jewellery
  business Claire’s has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in a court in Delaware,
  according to new filings. It is the second time the group has declared
  bankruptcy, after first filing for the process in 2018 after it was unable to
  repay a loan. The group saw its finances improve after wiping around $1.9bn
  (£1.4 billion) off its balance sheet in a refinancing but has come under
  pressure from recent weak consumer demand and supply chain uncertainty.
  Claire’s runs 2,750 stores across 17 countries. It has around 280 stores in
  the UK. Its UK stores are currently unaffected by the bankruptcy process, PA
  Media reports. Last month, Sky News reported that Claire’s has hired advisers
  at Interpath Advisory to find a buyer for its British operations, and that a
  sale of the British chain could lead to significant numbers of store closures.
  Entertainment giant Disney has just beaten Wall Street expectations. In its
  latest financial results, Disney reported a 16% rise in adjusted earnings per
  share to $1.61, beating analysts forecasts of $1.47. Disney reported: Revenues
  increased 2% for Q3 to $23.7bn from $23.2bn in Q3 fiscal 2024 Income before
  income taxes increased 4% for Q3 to $3.2bn from $3.1bn in Q3 fiscal 2024
  Income from “Experiences” (Disney’s theme parks) rose by $294m year-on-year to
  $2.5bn in the quarter. Income from “Sports” (such as TV channel ESPN) rose
  $235m to $1bn. But income from “Entertainment” (such as Disney+ and Hulu) fell
  by $179m to $1bn. CEO Bob Iger said Disney was pleased with its “creative
  success and financial performance” in the last quarter, adding: “The company
  is taking major steps forward in streaming with the upcoming launch of ESPN’s
  direct-to-consumer service, our just-announced plans with the NFL, and our
  forthcoming integration of Hulu into Disney+, creating a truly differentiated
  streaming proposition that harnesses the highestcaliber brands and franchises,
  general entertainment, family programming, news, and industry-leading sports
  content. And we have more expansions underway around the world in our parks
  and experiences than at any other time in our history. With ambitious plans
  ahead for all our businesses, we’re not done building, and we are excited for
  Disney’s future.” Back in the financial market, European healthcare stocks
  have hit a three-month low as the threat of US tariffs looms over the sector.
  The STOXX Healthcare index has dropped by 1.6% today, to its lowest level
  since mid-April, early in the Trump trade wars. Investors are jittery after
  the US president said Washington would initially impose a “small tariff” on
  pharmaceuticals firms before raising it to 150% within 18 months, and
  eventually to 250%, in a bid to boost domestic production. Top fallers this
  morning include Germany’s Bayer, who are down 4.7% after reporting a 5.1% drop
  in earnings, ahead of special items, for the first half of this year. Last
  month, the European pharmaceutical industry warned that a 15% tariff on
  medicines imported from the EU would harm patients on both sides of the
  Atlantic…. Construction activity is likely to improve over the coming months,
  predicts Elliott Jordan-Doak, senior UK economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics:
  The Bank of England will likely cut interest rates in August, reducing
  borrowing costs for businesses, and the shock from tariff uncertainty will
  continue to fade. Moreover, the government’s focus on investment spending and
  planning reforms should also provide support to the construction industry. The
  PMI should recover over the coming months. Here’s some early reaction to the
  tumble in UK construction activity last month: Gareth Belsham, director of
  Bloom Building Consultancy: “There’s no sugarcoating it - this data will be
  tough to swallow for almost everyone in construction. “All three subsectors of
  the industry saw output contract in July, with the sharpest fall coming in
  civil engineering. Housebuilding, the sector beloved of politicians in need of
  a photo opp, also declined badly. “To make matters worse, the pipeline of new
  work is drying up fast. New order numbers have now fallen for seven months in
  a row, with July’s slump the worst seen since February. “Little wonder
  contractor confidence is weak and many construction firms are laying off
  payrolled staff. “June saw sentiment plunge to its lowest level since December
  2022, and while July’s figure improved marginally, even the most optimistic of
  builders will find it hard to see the glass as half full. Brian Smith, head of
  cost management and commercial at infrastructure consultancy firm AECOM: “A
  slower summer for construction reflects ongoing caution in the market, with
  clients holding back decisions amid cost pressures and capacity concerns. This
  marks the seventh consecutive month of declining activity, but clearer
  direction from government is helping to steady sentiment and reframe
  expectations for the second half of the year. “The new Infrastructure Pipeline
  marks a welcome shift from strategy to delivery. It provides the long-term
  certainty the sector needs to plan and prioritise, with 780 public and private
  sector projects worth £530bn helping to define the scale of opportunity ahead.
  A stable pipeline, insulated from political cycles, is essential to unlocking
  growth and driving efficient delivery. “But the scale of what’s set out in the
  pipeline cannot be delivered without the right capacity in place. Labour
  shortages remain a challenge across the sector, particularly in technical and
  delivery roles. Turning visibility into progress will require investing in the
  people and skills needed to build at pace.” Max Jones, director of
  infrastructure and construction at Lloyds: “Despite a challenging month, signs
  of recovery are emerging across the UK construction sector. Easing inflation
  has likely helped to stabilise core material costs including steel, concrete
  and aggregates. This has also potentially helped to operate supply chains more
  smoothly, improve project delivery and protect margins. “However, with
  increased investment, progress on planning reform, and plans to expand their
  project pipelines, firms are likely to feel encouraged that more positive
  months are ahead.” The contraction in UK construction last month is another
  reason for the Bank of England to consider cutting interest rates at noon
  tomorrow. A rate cut, from 4.25% to 4%, is already widely expected – it’ s a
  95% chance, according to the City money markets this morning. Andy Burgess,
  fixed income investment specialist at Insight Investment, says: “The Bank of
  England is widely expected to cut rates this week in what is likely to be a
  complex decision as the MPC weighs weak growth, sticky inflation, and a
  looming fiscal tightening. While markets are pricing in a 0.25% cut, attention
  will centre on the voting split – particularly how many members vote for a
  0.5% move or prefer to hold. Burgess adds that the rhe Bank has a narrow
  window to cut rates ahead of the autumn budget. Looking ahead, UK construction
  firms are – on balance – optimistic about growth over the next year. However,
  expectations are weak when compared with their long-run trend, with business
  confidence rising slightly from June’s two-and-a-half-year low. With activity
  falling, construction firms kept laying off staff last month. This morning’s
  construction PMI report shows that the downward trend in payroll numbers
  continued into July, meaning employment levels have now fallen for seven
  months. Builders reported lay-offs, recruitment freezes and the nonreplacement
  of leavers, and also cut back on their use of subcontractors. Some
  construction firms have reported a drop in work undertaken on public sector
  projects in July. This led to civil engineering showing the sharpest drop in
  activity during July, followed by housebuilding and then commercial work.
  Ouch! Activity in the UK construction sector has fallen at the fastest rate in
  over five years, indicating the government is struggling to hit its
  housebuilding targets. Data firm S&amp;P Global has reported that there was “a
  considerable slump in the UK construction sector” in July, as builders
  reported a renewed decline in housing projects. That is a sign that Labour are
  falling behind in their target to boost housebuilding and build 1.5 million
  new homes by 2029. Commercial construction, and civil engineering, both also
  shrank in July. S&amp;P Global says: Underlying data highlighted marked
  decreases in volumes of work carried out across all three monitored
  sub-sectors, but a considerable drag came from a fresh drop in residential
  building. This pulled the S&amp;P Global UK Construction Purchasing Managers’
  Index (PMI) down to posting 44.3 in July, from 48.8 in June. Any reading below
  50 shows a contraction, and today’s data signals the sharpest contraction in
  over five years. Builders blamed site delays, lower volumes of incoming new
  business and weaker customer confidence for falling activity in July. Joe
  Hayes, principal economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, says UK
  construction suffered “a fresh setback” in July, explaining: Dissecting the
  latest contraction, we can see a fresh and sharp drop in residential building,
  as well as an accelerated fall in work carried out on civil engineering
  projects. Forward-looking indicators from the survey imply that UK
  constructors are preparing for challenging times ahead. They’re buying less
  materials and reducing the number of workers on the payroll. Expectations also
  continue to underwhelm, despite a modest pick-up in confidence from June’s
  two-and-a-half-year low. London’s main share index is inching closer to the
  record high struck at the end of last month. The FTSE 100 share index traded
  as high as 9184 points this morning, just 6 points away from the intraday high
  of 9190 hit on 31 July. Insurance group Hiscox are the top riser, up 8.6%,
  after beating profit forecasts this morning and lifting its dividend despite
  “the largest wildfire insurance event in history”. Victoria Scholar, Head of
  Investment at interactive investor, says: “The FTSE 100 is trading slightly
  higher, although earnings reports are stemming an even greater gain for the
  index. Glencore is down around 3.5% after the miner reported a drop in first
  half profits and Legal &amp; General is down a similar percentage,
  disappointing investors despite an earnings beat.” Chris Beauchamp, chief
  market analyst at IG, says: “London’s listing authorities will breathe a sigh
  of relief over Glencore’s plans to stay on the LSE, mainly since it seems
  unlikely it can make the S&amp;P 500. It’s been a gloomy update overall from
  Glencore, which has suffered from the dire performance of coal prices, though
  recent improvement there and in cobalt provides hope that they can turn the
  ship around in the second half.” There’s some good news for the City this
  morning: mining giant Glencore has decided not to quit the London stock market
  in favour of New York. Glencore told shareholders this morning that it has
  completed its analysis of potential alternative listing options, and concluded
  that shifting its listing to the US did not make sense. Glencore explained: Of
  the major global equity exchanges, the scale and depth of US capital markets
  is unrivalled, but having considered the costs and benefits, including in
  respect of indexation, we do not believe that becoming a US domestic issuer or
  having a sponsored ADR program [an American depositary receipt] would be
  value. Back in February, Glencore said it was considering moving its primary
  share listing away from London, a journey already taken by major companies
  such as gambling firm Flutter. Glencore also reported a 14% drop in adjusted
  profits in the first half of the year, on an EBITDA basis, as it suffered from
  weaker coal prices and lower copper production. Glencore’s chief executive
  officer, Gary Nagle, says: “While there is much uncertainty around the impacts
  of geopolitics and trade in the shorter-term, we remain of the view that, in
  certain commodities, the scale and pace of required resource development will
  struggle to meet the demand projections for such materials into the future. We
  are well placed to participate in bridging this gap, through the flexibility
  embedded in both our Marketing and Industrial businesses to respond to global
  needs.” Profits at Japanese automarket Honda have halved in the last quarter,
  as Donald Trump’s trade war hit their earnings. Honda, which is Japan’s
  second-largest carmaker, has reported quarterly operating profit of ¥244.2bn
  (£1.24bn) for April-June, missing analyst forecasts of ¥311.7bn. Honda said
  the 27.5% tariffs on auto imports imposed by the US, pulled down its operating
  profit for the quarter by about ¥125bn. But the automaker said the impact from
  the tariffs on its full-year operating profit was smaller than it had
  estimated in May. It now expects a ¥450bn yen hit for the year, compared to
  ¥650bn forecast previously. But in better news, Honda now believes tariffs
  will have less impact on its full-year operating profits than previously
  forecast. It now expects a ¥450bn hit this year, down from ¥650bn forecast
  previously. The company raised its full-year operating profit forecast to 700
  billion yen from 500 billion yen, and said it expected the yen to trade at a
  weaker rate than it had previously estimated, Reuters reports. Last month, the
  US and Japan agreed a trade deal under which tariffs on Japanese cars would
  drop to 15%. However, a timeframe for the change to go into effect was not
  announced; yesterday, Japan’s top tariff negotiator Ryosei Akazawa headed to
  Washington to try to hammer this out… Good morning, and welcome to our rolling
  coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The
  artificial intelligence boom is continuing to excite investors, creating the
  possibility of huge earnings for the companies and individuals at the heart of
  the AI race. Overnight, news has broken that OpenAI, the group behind the
  ChatGPT chatbot, is in talks about a share sale that would value the company
  at $500bn. That would be a serious jump on OpenAI’s previous valuation of
  $300bn, set in a financing round in March, and underline its status as one of
  the largest privately held companies in the world. The talks centre on a
  potential sale of stock for current and former employees, Bloomberg reports,
  adding that existing investors including Thrive Capital have approached OpenAI
  about buying some of these shares. As OpenAI isn’t listed on the stock market,
  such a secondary stock sale would allow present and ex-staff to cash in. The
  mooted share sale comes as companies race to test, and roll out, artificial
  intelligence systems, which has sent the value of chipmaker Nvidia surging to
  over $4tn last month. Shares in Palantir, the software analytics and AI
  company, jumped almost 8% yesterday after it beat Wall Street estimates and
  hiked its full-year guidance due to the artificial intelligence boom. OpenAI
  is riding this wave too. The Financial Times reports that OpenAI’s annual
  recurring revenue — a measure of expected revenue from subscriptions commonly
  used by start-ups — has surged to $12bn, and the company is apparently
  expecting $20bn or more in ARR by the end of 2025. Yesterday, OpenAI launched
  new freely available artificial intelligence models, in a challenge to rivals
  including Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta and Chinese rival DeepSeek. The ChatGPT
  developer has announced two “open weight” large language models, which are
  free to download and can be customised by developers Sam Altman, OpenAI’s
  chief executive, said the company was excited to add to a stack of freely
  available AI models “based on democratic values … and for wide benefit”,
  adding: “We’re excited to make this model, the result of billions of dollars
  of research, available to the world to get AI into the hands of the most
  people possible.” The agenda 7am German factory orders for June 8.30am BST:

The broader S&amp;P 500 index has gained 10 points, or 0.16%, to 6,309 points, while the tech-focused Nasdaq is up almost 0.2%. Sales of Novo Nordisk’s injectable diabetes drugs including Ozempic have slowed sharply amid fierce competition and the threat of US tariffs, prompting it to cut costs and sharpen its commercial focus. The Danish drugmaker, whose booming sales of GLP-1 diabetes and obesity drugs in recent years had turned it into Europe’s most valuable company, has lost nearly $100bn (£75bn) in market value since cutting its full-year sales forecast last week, when its share price slid 30% in its worst week in more than two decades. It has fallen a further 3% today… White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett has hinted that Apple could make an investment announcement today. Hassett dropped the teaser as he discussed the financial pledges made by companies and countries under President Donald Trump, in an interview with Fox Business Network. Hassett said: “They’re moving here in droves. This is trillions and trillions of dollars of commitments for people to build new factories here. In fact, you’re likely to see one today from Apple.” Back in february, Apple pledged to invest $500bn in the US in the next four years that would include a giant factory in Texas for artificial intelligence servers… Car hire and food delivery group Uber has announced a $20bn share buyback programme, after reporting sales and earnings growth. Uber reported 17% growth in gross bookings, year-on-year, to $46.8bn in April-June, with income from operations up 82% YoY to $1.5bn. And in a sign of confidence, the firm is also planning to spend $20bn buying back some of its stock. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah, Uber’s CFO, says: Today’s announcement of a new $20bn share repurchase authorisation underscores our confidence in the business, following yet another quarter of strong top- and bottom-line performance. Our trailing 12-month free cash flow hit a new all-time high of $8.5bn and we remain committed to driving durable, profitable growth. Fast food chain McDonald’s has shrugged off economic anxiety, and posted a rise in sales in the last quarter. McDonald’s has reported that global comparable sales increased by 3.8% in the April-June quarter, with “broad-based growth across all segments”. Sales in the US rose by 2.5%, while McDonald’s overseas restaurants grew sales by 4%. Bloomberg points out that this ended four quarters of weak growth as the burger chain dealt with an E. coli outbreak, backlash against American brands in the Middle East and consumer unease about the economy in response to President Trump’s trade disputes. Claire’s Accessories faces an uncertain future on UK high streets after its US parent business filed for bankruptcy. US-based fashion accessories and jewellery business Claire’s has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in a court in Delaware, according to new filings. It is the second time the group has declared bankruptcy, after first filing for the process in 2018 after it was unable to repay a loan. The group saw its finances improve after wiping around $1.9bn (£1.4 billion) off its balance sheet in a refinancing but has come under pressure from recent weak consumer demand and supply chain uncertainty. Claire’s runs 2,750 stores across 17 countries. It has around 280 stores in the UK. Its UK stores are currently unaffected by the bankruptcy process, PA Media reports. Last month, Sky News reported that Claire’s has hired advisers at Interpath Advisory to find a buyer for its British operations, and that a sale of the British chain could lead to significant numbers of store closures. Entertainment giant Disney has just beaten Wall Street expectations. In its latest financial results, Disney reported a 16% rise in adjusted earnings per share to $1.61, beating analysts forecasts of $1.47. Disney reported: Revenues increased 2% for Q3 to $23.7bn from $23.2bn in Q3 fiscal 2024 Income before income taxes increased 4% for Q3 to $3.2bn from $3.1bn in Q3 fiscal 2024 Income from “Experiences” (Disney’s theme parks) rose by $294m year-on-year to $2.5bn in the quarter. Income from “Sports” (such as TV channel ESPN) rose $235m to $1bn. But income from “Entertainment” (such as Disney+ and Hulu) fell by $179m to $1bn. CEO Bob Iger said Disney was pleased with its “creative success and financial performance” in the last quarter, adding: “The company is taking major steps forward in streaming with the upcoming launch of ESPN’s direct-to-consumer service, our just-announced plans with the NFL, and our forthcoming integration of Hulu into Disney+, creating a truly differentiated streaming proposition that harnesses the highestcaliber brands and franchises, general entertainment, family programming, news, and industry-leading sports content. And we have more expansions underway around the world in our parks and experiences than at any other time in our history. With ambitious plans ahead for all our businesses, we’re not done building, and we are excited for Disney’s future.” Back in the financial market, European healthcare stocks have hit a three-month low as the threat of US tariffs looms over the sector. The STOXX Healthcare index has dropped by 1.6% today, to its lowest level since mid-April, early in the Trump trade wars. Investors are jittery after the US president said Washington would initially impose a “small tariff” on pharmaceuticals firms before raising it to 150% within 18 months, and eventually to 250%, in a bid to boost domestic production. Top fallers this morning include Germany’s Bayer, who are down 4.7% after reporting a 5.1% drop in earnings, ahead of special items, for the first half of this year. Last month, the European pharmaceutical industry warned that a 15% tariff on medicines imported from the EU would harm patients on both sides of the Atlantic…. Construction activity is likely to improve over the coming months, predicts Elliott Jordan-Doak, senior UK economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics: The Bank of England will likely cut interest rates in August, reducing borrowing costs for businesses, and the shock from tariff uncertainty will continue to fade. Moreover, the government’s focus on investment spending and planning reforms should also provide support to the construction industry. The PMI should recover over the coming months. Here’s some early reaction to the tumble in UK construction activity last month: Gareth Belsham, director of Bloom Building Consultancy: “There’s no sugarcoating it - this data will be tough to swallow for almost everyone in construction. “All three subsectors of the industry saw output contract in July, with the sharpest fall coming in civil engineering. Housebuilding, the sector beloved of politicians in need of a photo opp, also declined badly. “To make matters worse, the pipeline of new work is drying up fast. New order numbers have now fallen for seven months in a row, with July’s slump the worst seen since February. “Little wonder contractor confidence is weak and many construction firms are laying off payrolled staff. “June saw sentiment plunge to its lowest level since December 2022, and while July’s figure improved marginally, even the most optimistic of builders will find it hard to see the glass as half full. Brian Smith, head of cost management and commercial at infrastructure consultancy firm AECOM: “A slower summer for construction reflects ongoing caution in the market, with clients holding back decisions amid cost pressures and capacity concerns. This marks the seventh consecutive month of declining activity, but clearer direction from government is helping to steady sentiment and reframe expectations for the second half of the year. “The new Infrastructure Pipeline marks a welcome shift from strategy to delivery. It provides the long-term certainty the sector needs to plan and prioritise, with 780 public and private sector projects worth £530bn helping to define the scale of opportunity ahead. A stable pipeline, insulated from political cycles, is essential to unlocking growth and driving efficient delivery. “But the scale of what’s set out in the pipeline cannot be delivered without the right capacity in place. Labour shortages remain a challenge across the sector, particularly in technical and delivery roles. Turning visibility into progress will require investing in the people and skills needed to build at pace.” Max Jones, director of infrastructure and construction at Lloyds: “Despite a challenging month, signs of recovery are emerging across the UK construction sector. Easing inflation has likely helped to stabilise core material costs including steel, concrete and aggregates. This has also potentially helped to operate supply chains more smoothly, improve project delivery and protect margins. “However, with increased investment, progress on planning reform, and plans to expand their project pipelines, firms are likely to feel encouraged that more positive months are ahead.” The contraction in UK construction last month is another reason for the Bank of England to consider cutting interest rates at noon tomorrow. A rate cut, from 4.25% to 4%, is already widely expected – it’ s a 95% chance, according to the City money markets this morning. Andy Burgess, fixed income investment specialist at Insight Investment, says: “The Bank of England is widely expected to cut rates this week in what is likely to be a complex decision as the MPC weighs weak growth, sticky inflation, and a looming fiscal tightening. While markets are pricing in a 0.25% cut, attention will centre on the voting split – particularly how many members vote for a 0.5% move or prefer to hold. Burgess adds that the rhe Bank has a narrow window to cut rates ahead of the autumn budget. Looking ahead, UK construction firms are – on balance – optimistic about growth over the next year. However, expectations are weak when compared with their long-run trend, with business confidence rising slightly from June’s two-and-a-half-year low. With activity falling, construction firms kept laying off staff last month. This morning’s construction PMI report shows that the downward trend in payroll numbers continued into July, meaning employment levels have now fallen for seven months. Builders reported lay-offs, recruitment freezes and the nonreplacement of leavers, and also cut back on their use of subcontractors. Some construction firms have reported a drop in work undertaken on public sector projects in July. This led to civil engineering showing the sharpest drop in activity during July, followed by housebuilding and then commercial work. Ouch! Activity in the UK construction sector has fallen at the fastest rate in over five years, indicating the government is struggling to hit its housebuilding targets. Data firm S&amp;P Global has reported that there was “a considerable slump in the UK construction sector” in July, as builders reported a renewed decline in housing projects. That is a sign that Labour are falling behind in their target to boost housebuilding and build 1.5 million new homes by 2029. Commercial construction, and civil engineering, both also shrank in July. S&amp;P Global says: Underlying data highlighted marked decreases in volumes of work carried out across all three monitored sub-sectors, but a considerable drag came from a fresh drop in residential building. This pulled the S&amp;P Global UK Construction Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) down to posting 44.3 in July, from 48.8 in June. Any reading below 50 shows a contraction, and today’s data signals the sharpest contraction in over five years. Builders blamed site delays, lower volumes of incoming new business and weaker customer confidence for falling activity in July. Joe Hayes, principal economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, says UK construction suffered “a fresh setback” in July, explaining: Dissecting the latest contraction, we can see a fresh and sharp drop in residential building, as well as an accelerated fall in work carried out on civil engineering projects. Forward-looking indicators from the survey imply that UK constructors are preparing for challenging times ahead. They’re buying less materials and reducing the number of workers on the payroll. Expectations also continue to underwhelm, despite a modest pick-up in confidence from June’s two-and-a-half-year low. London’s main share index is inching closer to the record high struck at the end of last month. The FTSE 100 share index traded as high as 9184 points this morning, just 6 points away from the intraday high of 9190 hit on 31 July. Insurance group Hiscox are the top riser, up 8.6%, after beating profit forecasts this morning and lifting its dividend despite “the largest wildfire insurance event in history”. Victoria Scholar, Head of Investment at interactive investor, says: “The FTSE 100 is trading slightly higher, although earnings reports are stemming an even greater gain for the index. Glencore is down around 3.5% after the miner reported a drop in first half profits and Legal &amp; General is down a similar percentage, disappointing investors despite an earnings beat.” Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, says: “London’s listing authorities will breathe a sigh of relief over Glencore’s plans to stay on the LSE, mainly since it seems unlikely it can make the S&amp;P 500. It’s been a gloomy update overall from Glencore, which has suffered from the dire performance of coal prices, though recent improvement there and in cobalt provides hope that they can turn the ship around in the second half.” There’s some good news for the City this morning: mining giant Glencore has decided not to quit the London stock market in favour of New York. Glencore told shareholders this morning that it has completed its analysis of potential alternative listing options, and concluded that shifting its listing to the US did not make sense. Glencore explained: Of the major global equity exchanges, the scale and depth of US capital markets is unrivalled, but having considered the costs and benefits, including in respect of indexation, we do not believe that becoming a US domestic issuer or having a sponsored ADR program [an American depositary receipt] would be value. Back in February, Glencore said it was considering moving its primary share listing away from London, a journey already taken by major companies such as gambling firm Flutter. Glencore also reported a 14% drop in adjusted profits in the first half of the year, on an EBITDA basis, as it suffered from weaker coal prices and lower copper production. Glencore’s chief executive officer, Gary Nagle, says: “While there is much uncertainty around the impacts of geopolitics and trade in the shorter-term, we remain of the view that, in certain commodities, the scale and pace of required resource development will struggle to meet the demand projections for such materials into the future. We are well placed to participate in bridging this gap, through the flexibility embedded in both our Marketing and Industrial businesses to respond to global needs.” Profits at Japanese automarket Honda have halved in the last quarter, as Donald Trump’s trade war hit their earnings. Honda, which is Japan’s second-largest carmaker, has reported quarterly operating profit of ¥244.2bn (£1.24bn) for April-June, missing analyst forecasts of ¥311.7bn. Honda said the 27.5% tariffs on auto imports imposed by the US, pulled down its operating profit for the quarter by about ¥125bn. But the automaker said the impact from the tariffs on its full-year operating profit was smaller than it had estimated in May. It now expects a ¥450bn yen hit for the year, compared to ¥650bn forecast previously. But in better news, Honda now believes tariffs will have less impact on its full-year operating profits than previously forecast. It now expects a ¥450bn hit this year, down from ¥650bn forecast previously. The company raised its full-year operating profit forecast to 700 billion yen from 500 billion yen, and said it expected the yen to trade at a weaker rate than it had previously estimated, Reuters reports. Last month, the US and Japan agreed a trade deal under which tariffs on Japanese cars would drop to 15%. However, a timeframe for the change to go into effect was not announced; yesterday, Japan’s top tariff negotiator Ryosei Akazawa headed to Washington to try to hammer this out… Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The artificial intelligence boom is continuing to excite investors, creating the possibility of huge earnings for the companies and individuals at the heart of the AI race. Overnight, news has broken that OpenAI, the group behind the ChatGPT chatbot, is in talks about a share sale that would value the company at $500bn. That would be a serious jump on OpenAI’s previous valuation of $300bn, set in a financing round in March, and underline its status as one of the largest privately held companies in the world. The talks centre on a potential sale of stock for current and former employees, Bloomberg reports, adding that existing investors including Thrive Capital have approached OpenAI about buying some of these shares. As OpenAI isn’t listed on the stock market, such a secondary stock sale would allow present and ex-staff to cash in. The mooted share sale comes as companies race to test, and roll out, artificial intelligence systems, which has sent the value of chipmaker Nvidia surging to over $4tn last month. Shares in Palantir, the software analytics and AI company, jumped almost 8% yesterday after it beat Wall Street estimates and hiked its full-year guidance due to the artificial intelligence boom. OpenAI is riding this wave too. The Financial Times reports that OpenAI’s annual recurring revenue — a measure of expected revenue from subscriptions commonly used by start-ups — has surged to $12bn, and the company is apparently expecting $20bn or more in ARR by the end of 2025. Yesterday, OpenAI launched new freely available artificial intelligence models, in a challenge to rivals including Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta and Chinese rival DeepSeek. The ChatGPT developer has announced two “open weight” large language models, which are free to download and can be customised by developers Sam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, said the company was excited to add to a stack of freely available AI models “based on democratic values … and for wide benefit”, adding: “We’re excited to make this model, the result of billions of dollars of research, available to the world to get AI into the hands of the most people possible.” The agenda 7am German factory orders for June 8.30am BST: eurozone construction PMI report for July 9.30am BST: UK construction PMI report for July
