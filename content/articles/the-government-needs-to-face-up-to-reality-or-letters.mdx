  Martin Kettle’s analysis of the dysfunctionality of government is spot-on, but
  incomplete (The biggest problem for Starmer and co: the machinery of
  government is broken and they can’t fix it, 7 August). The core problem is our
  unwillingness to face up to reality, whether it is on tax, the need to invest
  in reform, the impact of Brexit, the pros and cons of legal migration, the
  real steps necessary to stem illegal migration at source, the implications of
  the new cold war, or the new world order under Donald Trump. By biting our
  tongue and trying to fudge the hard choices, successive governments have both
  confused and misled. Now is the time to treat the public as adults and trust
  them to recognise the need to get real. We need to rebuild the country to make
  it relevant for both today and the future, and that means moving beyond the
  Widow Twankey politics of saying a lot but doing nothing. Now is the time for
  genuine leadership and a promise to lead, not follow, the nation. Tom Kelly
