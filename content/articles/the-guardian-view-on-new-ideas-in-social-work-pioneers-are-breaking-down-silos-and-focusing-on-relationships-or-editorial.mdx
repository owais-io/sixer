  The Guardian view on new ideas in social work: pioneers are breaking down
  silos and focusing on relationships | Editorial

  When it is not framed around cost savings, discussion of public service reform
  these days mostly focuses on technology. This is most obvious in healthcare,
  where medical science drives change all the time: weight loss drugs, genetic
  cancer tests, and so on. The benefits and risks of AI are another theme, from
  education to criminal justice. But some of those involved in trying to improve
  public services are taking a strikingly different tack. Their work centres not
  on machines but on relationships. This might sound like common sense. Pretty
  well everyone recognises the value of an inspiring teacher or trusted social
  worker. Wes Streeting has stressed his support for Labour’s policy of
  “bringing back the family doctor, so patients can see the same doctor for each
  appointment”. But despite such pledges, the connections between people are too
  often overlooked when public services are designed and thought about – and
  this is one of the problems that a current project, Changing Futures, seeks to
  address. Like the Tories’ Troubled Families programme, led by Louise Casey,
  Changing Futures targets help at the crisis-prone households that appear to be
  least well served by existing services. Its particular focus is a population
  of up to 400,000 people in England who are regarded as highly vulnerable due
  to some combination of addiction, homelessness, mental illness, domestic
  violence and involvement in crime. Funding runs until next year, so formal
  evaluations are not due for some time. But one project, in Northumbria, has
  published descriptions of the “liberated method” through which its
  practitioners try to break down silos, in order to deliver the kind of
  person-centred support that is the programme’s guiding principle. Face-to-face
  work is central, and an approach its leaders describe as “high support and
  high challenge”. This is informed by methods from the world of addiction
  recovery (AA and its offshoots), including the role of peer-group mentors with
  lived experience. The rationale is that while current services are configured
  to address discrete issues (housing, employment and so on), the bigger picture
  also needs to be seen. Judging from past experience, the prospect of such
  projects shaping the reform of services nationally is remote – although local
  leaders might find ways to embed them. Our overcentralised system of
  government means that most change comes from Whitehall. But the Changing
  Futures teams are not the only ones banging the drum for relational public
  services. Ministers made the mistake of undermining their £1bn investment in
  employment support by linking it to disability benefit cuts. But their Get
  Britain Working plan does recognise the importance of personalised help – in
  preference to sanctions. In the words of one adviser at a charity visited by
  Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, “everything in this business of
  getting people back into work is about relationships”. In both the benefits
  context, and Changing Futures, saving money is a big part of the motive for
  trying new things. The people being supported by the latter include heavy
  users of crisis services, such as A&amp;E departments. The underfunding of
  existing services and chronic lack of affordable homes, which make people
  vulnerable in the first place, must never be overlooked. But that doesn’t mean
  nothing creative can come of efforts to reconfigure support. Trying to improve
  public services is a core duty of government. Innovation is not all about AI.
