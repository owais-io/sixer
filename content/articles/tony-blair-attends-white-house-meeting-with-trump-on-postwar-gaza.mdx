  The former British prime minister Tony Blair has attended a White House
  meeting with Donald Trump to discuss plans for postwar Gaza, the Guardian
  understands. After stepping down as prime minister in 2007, Blair took on the
  role of Middle East envoy until 2015 and spent time in Jerusalem trying to
  formulate a plan for a two-state solution. The former Labour leader, 72, was
  in Washington DC on Wednesday for the meeting with Trump. The Axios website
  reported that Trump’s son-in-law and former senior adviser, Jared Kushner, was
  also in attendance. Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said the US was
  putting together a “very comprehensive” plan for “the next day” after the war.
  In an interview with Fox News on Tuesday, Witkoff said he believed the war in
  Gaza could be ended in the next four months. “We’re going to settle this one
  way or another, certainly before the end of this year,” he said. Asked about a
  plan for governing postwar Gaza, Witkoff said: “It’s a very comprehensive plan
  we’re putting together on the next day that I think many people are going to …
  see how robust it is and how well meaning it is, and it reflects President
  Trump’s humanitarian motives here.” No details have been disclosed about the
  proposals under discussion. The White House said: “President Trump has been
  clear that he wants the war to end, and he wants peace and prosperity for
  everyone in the region.” Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, also met his
  Israeli counterpart, Gideon Sa’ar, in Washington. The meetings came after Pope
  Leo XIV demanded that Israel stop its “collective punishment” of the
  population in the besieged territory. Ten Palestinians, including two
  children, have died from starvation in the last 24 hours, health authorities
  in Gaza said on Wednesday. At least 313 people have died from hunger,
  including 119 children, since the war in Gaza began and Israel intensified its
  siege on the Palestinian territory. The pope said: “I beg for a permanent
  ceasefire to be reached, the safe entry of humanitarian aid to be facilitated
  and humanitarian law to be fully respected.” He referred to international law
  and its “prohibition of collective punishment, indiscriminate use of force and
  the forced displacement of the population”. The pope was interrupted twice by
  applause as he called for a ceasefire in front of thousands of people in the
  Vatican auditorium. Israeli tanks rolled into the outskirts of Gaza City
  overnight, destroying houses and displacing residents. Tanks shelled the Ebad
  al-Rahman neighbourhood on the northern outskirts of the city, causing
  injuries, as Israeli forces sought to clear a path into Gaza City before an
  expected offensive. Israeli strikes and fire killed at least 76 people
  throughout Gaza in the previous 24 hours, the Gaza health authorities said.
