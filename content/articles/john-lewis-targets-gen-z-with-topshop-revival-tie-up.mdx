  John Lewis is to host Topshop in 32 of its 36 stores from February as the
  clothing brand’s only national stockist on UK high streets, in a drive to
  attract younger shoppers and their mothers. Peter Ruis, the managing director
  of the staff-owned department store chain, said Topshop – and Topman, which is
  to go into six outlets – would “really exemplify the new John Lewis”, as it
  tries to broaden its appeal with more fashion, home and beauty brands, ranging
  from Fenty to the Conran Shop. He said Topshop was “a brand that is going to
  resonate with our gen Zs [those in their late teens and early 20s] and our gen
  Xers and everyone in between”. Topshop, which launched in Sheffield in 1964,
  closed all its UK high street stores in 2021 after its parent company, Philip
  Green’s Arcadia, went into administration. The brand was bought out by the
  online fashion seller Asos, which last week relaunched Topshop’s website and
  opened an outlet in the London department store Liberty. At its height,
  Topshop had 300 stores in the UK and 11 in the US. Ruis said gen X – those in
  their 40s and 50s – were more interested in fashion than their parents and
  “grew up with Topshop” and now had the money to buy it, while the younger
  generations were interested in 90s revival fashion. “I think the best fashion
  brands are multigenerational. I think that’s always been the case,” he said,
  suggesting Topshop would “bring more of that family day out” to the retailer.
  Ruis said younger customers were already shopping in its beauty halls
  alongside their parents and buying brands such as Mango but this would bring a
  new attraction. He said Topshop would have a specially created area in stores
  staffed by handpicked John Lewis staff and was “going to have a lot of
  energy”. Michelle Wilson, the managing director of Topshop, said John Lewis
  had picked a selection of 120 items suitable for its shoppers, including
  denim, footwear and faux leather jackets, with the most expensive item a £250
  suede jacket. She said shoppers “absolutely want to see us back in stores” and
  wanted to “touch and feel and try on product”, with John Lewis being “a name
  trusted by millions”. Wilson added that Topshop had been “pretty open about
  the fact that we would like our own store presence” but there was “no defined
  dates” for such a move and the brand was also not looking for other partners
  on UK high streets. Ruis said John Lewis, which is due to reveal its half-year
  results next week, was not abandoning its mainstream customers. “We are not
  just a typical luxury fashion and beauty department store. We’re one that
  sells you everything in your life,” he said, pointing to the chain’s very
  large market share in sales of cots and gear for babies. He said this broad
  appeal positioned it well to outlive the difficulties that led to its rivals
  Debenhams and Beales disappearing from high streets and House of Fraser
  significantly contracting. He said John Lewis was “super positive” about
  trading in this year’s key Christmas period as its customer surveys indicated
  consumers were “more optimistic than they’ve been for a very long time”,
  partly thanks to mortgage rate decreases. “We’re seeing big-ticket items come
  back with a vengeance,” he added, referring to strong sales of sofas and
  mattresses, in particular. Last year’s return of the group’s now 100-year-old
  price promise, never knowingly undersold, had gone better than expected, Ruis
  said, helping to pull in shoppers searching for goods online.
