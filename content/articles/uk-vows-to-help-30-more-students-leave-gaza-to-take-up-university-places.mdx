  Ministers have approved plans to help a further 30 students leave Gaza to take
  up places at UK universities next month but their evacuation remains uncertain
  and dependent on Israel’s approval. It takes the total to 39, after a
  government commitment last week to work to secure the evacuation from Gaza of
  nine Chevening scholars with places at some of the UK’s leading universities.
  Chevening scholarships are largely government funded and are offered to
  “exceptional individuals” to study for a one-year master’s degree at a UK
  university. All 40 students identified by the government have fully funded
  scholarships. A Home Office source said it was “a complex and challenging
  task”. Names would have to be submitted to the Israeli authorities for
  approval, after which the students would travel to a third country, likely to
  be Jordan, for visa biometric checks, which are not currently available in
  Gaza. Campaigners for the students welcomed the news, but expressed concern
  that the latest group had received no direct contact from the government or
  been given details of what might happen next, while others with full funding
  appeared not to have been included. Dr Norah Parr, a researcher at the
  University of Birmingham who has been coordinating efforts to support the
  students, said: “We are relieved that the government has agreed to assist a
  larger group of students and ensure their arrival to the UK for the start of
  their autumn term, but we remain concerned about a lack of transparency or
  clear guidelines. “At our last count, at least 53 students had full funding
  and support from UK universities. There may be more we are not aware of. As it
  stands, the news is causing further concern and anxiety. Who will be included
  and by what parameters will inclusion be determined?” Soha, 31, who is due to
  start her PhD in the UK, said: “We were very excited to read the news and
  learn that there’s action and a plan for another 30 students, but we are
  really scared that it might not come through. We will not rest until every one
  of us receive the same news – not nine, not 30, but every one of us.” Abtisam
  Mohamed, the Labour MP for Sheffield Central, has been among those urging the
  government to help evacuate the scholarship students, winning the backing of
  more 100 parliamentarians in a letter at the weekend. “Stranded, many students
  feared that they would die under Israel’s bombs before being able to take up
  their university places,” she wrote on X. “Our message to the students was
  that they are not alone. And I’m relieved to share the news that the
  government will offer almost all funded scholarship students the same
  assistance with safe routes out of Gaza. This is the right decision.” A Home
  Office source said: “This remains a complex and challenging task, but the home
  secretary has made it crystal clear to her officials that she wants no stone
  unturned in efforts to ensure there are arrangements in place to allow this
  cohort of talented students to take up their places at UK universities as soon
  as possible.”
