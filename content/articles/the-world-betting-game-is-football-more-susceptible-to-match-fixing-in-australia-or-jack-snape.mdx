  Australian football faces a significant and ongoing threat given what is known
  about the recent A-League match-fixing case, which returns to court this week.
  Yet two of Australia’s most prominent sport integrity voices are concerned
  that an even greater peril lies in the opaque pit that is the illegal
  international online bookmaking market, and that local laws are not doing
  enough to mitigate the risk. Former Western United player Riku Danzaki and his
  friend Yuta Hirayama pleaded guilty last week to charges related to a scheme
  in which the pair bet on Danzaki receiving yellow cards in the A-League Men
  competition. They will be sentenced this week and face hefty fines. According
  to court proceedings, Danzaki and Hirayama used Australian-licensed bookmakers
  Bet365, Sportsbet and Tabcorp and won more than $20,000 in the scheme, but
  were undone when Tabcorp rejected their final bet and reported them to police.
  The case appears to be an endorsement for the cooperation between bookmakers,
  sporting codes and police that underpins gambling licence-fee agreements in
  Australia. In this instance, Tabcorp’s trading staff detected the suspicious
  behaviour and notified its investigation team, which referred it to the
  sporting integrity intelligence unit of Victoria police. While police will
  work across borders, this kind of cooperation between sports betting partners
  is weaker overseas, especially on the shady black market providers that evade
  regulation and enforcement. At the same time, the volume of betting is much
  larger on these platforms. The UN estimated in 2021 that up to US$1.7tn
  (AU$2.6tn) was wagered on illicit betting markets each year. The head of
  strategy and international policy at Sport Integrity Australia, James Moller,
  says football “could also be known as the world betting game, such are the
  volumes wagered on the sport across the globe”. “The quality of our sporting
  competitions and our closely aligned time-zone with Asia makes Australian
  sport particularly popular for betting in that part of the world,” he says.
  Football Australia says the Danzaki matter is one example that shows measures
  against match-fixing “have proven to be effective” in its mission to protect
  the sport. “Our aim is to prevent behaviours that threaten sport integrity
  from occurring in the first place, however, we have measures to detect and act
  where required.” Yet Dr Catherine Ordway, a sports integrity consultant, says
  catching those who benefit through offshore betting remains challenging.
  “People change their web domains very quickly, and the technology is changing
  to using cryptocurrencies and so on to make it very difficult to use the
  traditional forms of traceability and accountability that crime-fighters have
  been using over decades,” Ordway says. She highlighted where athletes are
  underpaid, or have not received integrity education, or are exposed to
  traditional corruption risks such as around drugs or sex work, the
  vulnerability grows. “Once you get down below that first league, then that’s
  where the risks present,” she says. The federal government has pledged to
  introduce commonwealth legislation to specifically address match-fixing, as
  part of the process to ratify the Macolin Convention, the international treaty
  aimed at combating sports corruption. There is currently a mishmash of state
  legislation, including a reluctance by governments in Tasmania and Western
  Australia to introduce specific laws to combat match-fixing, even as the other
  states followed through with a 2011 national agreement. But there is no clear
  timeline for the arrival of new powers. The temptation of match-fixing has
  lured Australians from sports other than football. Oliver Anderson, who won
  the 2016 Australian Open boys singles tennis title, is perhaps the
  highest-profile local athlete outside football to succumb to its temptations.
  And Australia’s other major codes are not without integrity concerns. The AFL
  has sought to increase licensing fees with bookmakers in order to improve
  detection of gamblers’ use of inside information. Former NRL player Ryan Tandy
  received a lifetime ban from the NRL in 2012 over a spot-fixing scandal. Like
  tennis, football’s appeal is global, and bettors are interested even in
  amateurs playing in Australia. Log on to one of the many offshore bookmakers
  beyond the reach of local regulators and investigators, and markets are
  available on 21 separate Australian football competitions, including
  second-tier leagues in several states. But Ordway says next year’s Women’s
  Asian Cup matches in Perth – where the state government has deemed its general
  wagering and criminal code provisions “sufficient” to effectively prevent
  match-fixing – is a “massive vulnerability”. “We’ve got people coming in that
  are not paid properly, that are not given the adequate training and education,
  whether it’s referees or players or team officials,” she says. “And they’re
  coming into an environment where, on the other side, we don’t have the
  legislation that’s as strong as it could be.” FA’s spokesperson said:
  “Football Australia would be supportive of legislation designed to uphold and
  protect the integrity of football and sport more generally.” A spokesperson
  for WA attorney-general Tony Buti said the state’s criminal code has “some of
  the strongest criminal laws in Australia” with a “range of offences relating
  to fraudulent behaviour”.
