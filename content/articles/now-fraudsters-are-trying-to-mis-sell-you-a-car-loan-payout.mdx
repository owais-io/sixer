  You are contacted out of the blue by a call or text and told you are due
  compensation for your mis-sold car loan. They say they are calling from the
  lender and just need your details to process your claim. With the recent news
  that UK motorists could be in line for payments of up to £950 each if they
  were victims of car finance mis-selling, the call or text might not be a
  surprise – particularly if you are one of millions who has written to your
  lender saying you think you may be owed money. But do not fall for it. This
  week, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) warned that drivers were being
  targeted by scammers posing as lenders. The FCA is in charge of working out
  who lenders will need to compensate and how, and says it will be October
  before it has announced how the scheme is likely to work – next year before
  payouts can be made. In the meantime, lenders will not be contacting customers
  to arrange a payment, so you can safely assume that anything promising money
  is a scam. What it looks like It could be a call from a mobile number or a
  text – on the website Whocalledme one number used had also been linked to
  other frauds. Some have reported being called by someone claiming to be
  working for a car finance company. Other reports say drivers have received a
  text with their car model and registration in it, and a message telling them
  they needed to follow a link and complete a registration. In one message
  shared online it looks like the driver was told they might be entitled to a
  payment of up to £16,000. What to do The FCA says if you receive a call like
  this you should hang up immediately. Do not share any information with the
  caller. In the UK you can report scam calls and texts to Ofcom by forwarding
  them to 7726. If you do think you may be owed money, sit tight. The FCA will
  tell lenders how they need to deal with claims for compensation and, at that
  point, you may be paid automatically, or contacted for more information on
  your finance deal. Even then, be wary and do not give personal details via
  online links.
