  Staff at a hospital trust where police are investigating at least 90 deaths
  say they face reprisals and ridicule from bosses if they raise concerns,
  according to a damning report. Asked to review University Hospitals Sussex,
  the report’s authors said they “repeatedly heard concerning examples of staff,
  often at a senior level, being ignored, dismissed and sometimes ridiculed when
  speaking up”. The report by Niche Health and Social Care Consulting said this
  fear of reprisals from whistleblowing could be harming patient safety. It also
  highlighted complaints of misogyny and failures to deal with “unwanted
  romantic advances”. The review team noted a number of challenges facing the
  trust, including an investigation by Sussex police into possible corporate and
  individual manslaughter charges over allegations of medical negligence and
  cover-up in the general surgery and neurosurgery departments. Operation
  Bramber is focused on the deaths of more than 90 patients, and serious harm
  suffered by more than 100 others. It was sparked by the concerns of two
  consultant whistleblowers who lost their jobs at the trust after speaking up,
  first revealed in the Guardian in June 2023. The report found staff feared
  their careers could be hindered if they raised concerns. One said they had
  been told not to share data that made the trust look bad. Another said when
  they did raise concerns they were “gaslit” and targeted by management. The
  report identified “significant issues with psychological safety at every
  [staff] level” and noted that the fear of speaking up had worsened in the last
  year. It said staff identified as having the potential to disagree with
  management said they were deliberately ignored in meetings. A staff survey
  conducted for the review received 376 responses, of which more than 300 were
  negative or very negative on the issue of speaking up. The responses often
  cited a “fear of reprisals”. One said: “There could be comeback which will
  affect your career in [a] negative manner.” Another said: “I raised concerns.
  It put a target on my back. Management lied, gaslit me, would circumvent the
  issue, would dismiss my concerns.” A third said: “I feel no one listens.”
  Staff complained that the executive team discouraged bad news and different
  opinions. The review identified a “predominance of direct and authoritative
  leadership styles”. It added: “We heard repeatedly that ‘there is a
  parent-child dynamic in this organisation’.” It also found that “incivility
  and poor behaviours appear to be pervasive” and there was a strong view that
  these were tolerated by leaders. The report did not give details of these
  behaviours. Last year the Guardian revealed that a consultant surgeon was
  promoted after allegedly assaulting resident doctors during surgery. Six
  senior women at the trust complained to the reviewers of misogyny, which was
  felt to be prevalent among consultants. Female staff said they faced eye
  rolling and other signs of dismissiveness from male colleagues when they spoke
  at meetings. They also faced pejorative references to sexuality when they took
  the lead. One woman claimed she “experienced unwanted romantic advances and
  inappropriate comments, with no actions taken months after reporting this to
  various senior leaders”. Earlier this month the trust chief executive, George
  Findlay, announced his departure. Andy Heeps, the acting chief executive, said
  the trust accepted all the report’s recommendations for improvement and its
  “valuable insight into what we do well, where we are improving, and where
  there is clearly more to do”. He said: “The authors recognise the scale of the
  task in completing such a huge trust merger during the Covid pandemic, and
  highlight a number of key improvements such as our big reductions in waiting
  lists and key service quality improvements. “But they also draw attention to
  some fundamental issues which we’ve not yet succeeded in tackling – and all of
  these things need to change, and change quickly.”
