  As the prosecution touches on Patterson’s custody conditions, Beale says it
  “doesn’t sound very humane”. He says he is confident Patterson will remain
  isolated for a long time. Beale tells the court that Patterson’s “notoriety is
  not going to diminish”. But Warren argues her fame will die down, noting “at
  some point people will lose interest”. When asked when this could occur,
  Warren says she cannot estimate how long this would be. Beale says he
  anticipates Paterson would remain isolated for a long time. Warren argues
  against Beale imposing a fixed non-parole period, saying this would be
  inappropriate. Beale says he will sentence Patterson on 8 September. The court
  adjourns. Touching on the defence’s submission about Patterson having
  “Asperger syndrome”, Warren says it is “hearsay” and the “evidence isn’t
  there.” Beale says Patterson doesn’t have “a lot of credibility”. Warren says
  Patterson made an “elaborate attempt to cover up her offences”. “That is
  indicative of a complete absence of regret or remorse,” she says. Warren says
  it also shows indifference to the victims and their families. Beale says he
  read the victim impact statements over the weekend. He notes the offending has
  affected “four generations” of the extended Patterson and Wilkinson families.
  “The word ripple. Ripple effect is often mentioned. More like a tsunami than a
  ripple,” he says. Warren says Patterson also intended to serve Simon a
  poisoned beef wellington if he attended the lunch. There is evidence Patterson
  decided to kill all her lunch guests in the weeks before the lunch, Warren
  says. She says it’s “anybody’s guess” when Paterson first formed the intention
  to harm her lunch guests. But she says there is evidence that by 16 July, when
  she invited the guests, she had a “clearly formed intention” to “harm all of
  them”. Addressing the court, prosecutor Jane Warren says Patterson has no
  recorded prior criminal convictions but notes a VicRoads record relating to a
  matter in 2004. Beale says Patterson has no relevant criminal history. Warren
  agrees. Warren says all the charges fall in the “worst category” . She says
  the prosecution is calling for a maximum penalty for the murder charges. But
  she says it does not make the same submission for the attempted murder charge.
  Judge asks about alleged ‘Asperger syndrome’ Justice Christopher Beale asks
  Mandy about his reference to Patterson having “Asperger syndrome” in his
  written submission. Mandy says this is Patterson’s claim in the brief of
  evidence and was also mentioned by others in their depositions. He tells the
  court Simon Patterson said that he believed Patterson had anxiety and
  high-functioning autism. Mandy says: “She does find it difficult because of
  that condition. Because she finds it difficult to cope with changes in
  routine,” he says. Beale says it doesn’t sound like there is much change in
  routine for Patterson. But Mandy says there are “minute by minute” changes,
  such as prisoners yelling in nearby cells, which is “never palatable”. Mandy
  says the defence will not argue against a life sentence for the “grave”
  offences. “The ultimate issue, the dispute between parties, is whether or not
  a non-parole period should be fixed,” he says. Mandy says his client facing a
  minimum non-parole period of 30 years means she would be 80 before she becomes
  eligible to apply for parole. He says Patterson being held in isolation is a
  relevant sentencing factor. “Ms Patterson will likely be held in those
  conditions for the foreseeable future,” he says. Mandy says Patterson will
  always be at risk from other prisoners, meaning isolation will be required to
  manage this. Mandy says these conditions make the “burden of imprisonment”
  much greater for Patterson than other prisoners. Mandy argues that there
  should be a fixed non-parole period. Mandy disputes claim Patterson has not
  seen prison chaplain Mandy disputes Hosking’s evidence that his client has not
  used the prison’s chaplaincy service. Hosking says she had been informed about
  Patterson’s lack of engagement with the chaplaincy service by prison officers
  but had not seen records about this. Mandy says Patterson has used the
  chaplaincy service and seen the chaplain on a number of occasions. Hosking
  says she cannot refute this. Patterson has never spoken to another prisoner,
  Mandy says Mandy says Patterson is not able to use the courtyard if another
  prisoner is using it due to her restricted conditions. Hosking says Patterson
  has approval to have contact to one other prisoner. But Mandy says she has
  never spoken to this prisoner. “I can’t deny that,” Hosking says. She says
  this could be due to the other prisoner not wanting to speak to Patterson.
  Under questioning by Mandy, Hosking confirms the other prisoner is serving a
  sentence for terrorism and has attacked other prisoners. Patterson’s defence
  lawyer, Colin Mandy SC, is questioning Hosking. Responding to Mandy, Hosking
  says the maximum time period that prisoners should remain in separation is 15
  days according to UN guidelines. Hosking says Patterson has been alone,
  segregated from other prisoners, in the restricted Gordon unit for 14 months.
  Mandy says this is about 400 days. Hosking says she agrees with this. Mandy
  says Patterson says she has only met with her prison case worker a “handful”
  of times. He says Patterson spends about 22 hours a day in her cell due to
  lockdowns at the prison. Hosking agrees. She says there is a small courtyard
  adjacent to Patterson’s cell that she had access to for up to an hour a day.
  Library access limited Hosking says due to staff shortages, there have been
  more lockdowns at the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre since the middle of 2024.
  Consequently, Patterson’s access to some areas of the prison including the
  library have been limited, Hosking says. Hiring at the prison was paused due
  to Covid and lower levels of prisoners, the court hears. Hosking says she
  expects staff shortages to ease later in the year due to a current recruitment
  drive. Under questioning by Warren, Hosking says Patterson has not used the
  chaplaincy services available to her at the prison. Hosking tells the court
  about Patterson’s cell: “I understand she’s a keen crocheter. She has a lot of
  wool and crochet equipment within there.” “She has her computer which she’s
  had for some time.” Patterson also has crocheted blankets she has made
  herself, Hosking says. “She also has a hair straightener and a fan,” she says.
  Hosking says after Patterson is sentenced she will have access to the prison’s
  education services. Within six weeks of arriving at the Dame Phyllis Frost
  Centre – a maximum security women’s prison in Victoria – Patterson was moved
  from the Gordon unit (a restricted unit) to the Murray unit. Hosking says the
  Murray unit is for prisoners requiring more supervision or protection. In
  March 2024, Patterson returned to the Gordon unit due to safety concerns. She
  later returned to the Murray unit before being transferred to the Gordon unit
  in June 2024. Hosking says Patterson has engaged with forensic intervention
  services – rehabilitation and treatment programs within the prison – for a
  “period of time”. “She is still able to access that. She has most recently …
  refused to engage,” she says. The court hears Hosking has made an affidavit
  about Patterson’s custody conditions. Prosecutor Jane Warren is questioning
  Hosking. Hosking says when Patterson was taken into custody in 2023 she was
  assigned a “major offender” status due to a high volume of media attention.
  Jenny Hosking, the assistant commissioner for the sentence management division
  at Corrections Victoria is appearing via video link. Earlier, we heard from
  family members affected by the murder of Don and Gail Patterson and Heather
  Wilkinson. The court also heard from Ian Wilkinson, the sole surviving lunch
  guest. The Victorian supreme court heard seven victim impact statements, out
  of a total of 28, from: Ian Wilkinson Ruth Dubois, Heather and Ian’s daughter
  Lynette Young, Heather and Gail’s sister Martha Patterson, Don’s mother Colin
  Patterson, Don’s brother Tim Patterson, Don’s nephew Simon Patterson, Erin’s
  estranged husband The remaining statements will not be read in court.
  Lynette’s Young statement was read by prosecutor Nanette Rogers SC. Simon
  Patterson, Erin’s estranged husband, had his victim impact statement read in
  court by Naomi Gleadow, his cousin. Gleadow also read statements from Martha,
  Colin and Tim. Erin Patterson’s plea hearing has resumed in the Victorian
  supreme court. Ian Wilkinson says he forgives Erin Patterson for trying to
  murder him but cannot offer her forgiveness for killing three other people
  with poisoned beef wellingtons, a Victorian court has heard. You can read more
  about the victim impact statement Wilkinson delivered this morning here: There
  are a total of 28 victim impact statements, the court hears. The remainder
  will not be read in court. Justice Christopher Beale says after the break the
  court will hear from a Department of Corrections employee about Erin
  Patterson’s custody conditions. The hearing is adjourned until 2.15pm. Simon
  Patterson describes media attention as ‘dehumanising’ Simon’s statement also
  calls out the “deplorable” actions of some legacy media outlets. He details
  having his home ambushed by the media and says his family have become fearful
  of strangers. He says: The children and I have been filmed in cafes and in the
  street. He describes the media attention as “dehumanising”. He says: I doubt
  I’ll get used to being treated in that way. The final victim impact statement
  is from Simon Patterson, which Gleadow reads out on his behalf. He says he
  misses his parents and aunt “more than words can express”. Simon says his two
  children have been left without grandparents and “robbed of hope”. He says:
  Like all of us, they face the daunting challenge of trying to comprehend what
  [Erin] has done. The grim reality is they live in an irreparably broken home
  with a solo parent when almost everybody knows their mother murdered their
  grandparents.” He says these are difficult hurdles to overcome. Despite this
  both children are incredibly strong, loving, intelligent … with much help they
  are overcoming the hurdles. ‘They deserve better than this’: Don and Gail
  Patterson’s nephew gives statement Naomi Gleadow also reads a statement from
  Tim Patterson, the nephew of Don and Gail, to the court. He says after their
  deaths he wrote an entry in his diary: I wrote in my diary: ‘Why did God
  decide to end such amazing lives in such a horrific manner? They deserve
  better than this.’ Tim says he now finds it difficult to “comprehend this
  world”. He says: I still can’t believe that Don and Gail are gone. Tim says
  sometimes it seems as though “they just haven’t seen each other in a while”,
  as if “they’re still there in Korumburra, sitting by the fire in their cosy
  living room”. Don Patterson’s younger brother says murders severed ‘core
  relationships’ The court hears from Colin Patterson, the younger brother of
  Don, whose victim impact statement is read by Gleadow. He says the “core
  relationships” in his life “have been severed”. He describes his older brother
  Don as a “powerful influence” on him. Court hears statement from Don
  Patterson’s mother The victim impact statement of Martha Patterson, Don’s
  mother, is read by Naomi Gleadow. Martha’s statement says the whole family is
  broken and she feels “broken-hearted”. She says: “May God help our family to
  heal after this tragedy.” Court hears statement from sister of Gail Patterson
  and Heather Wilkinson Prosecutor Nanette Rogers SC is reading a victim impact
  statement on behalf of Lynette Young, the sister of Gail and Heather. She
  says: I’m just so angry and so sad that my people are not here to be the
  loving parents and grandparents that they always were. Young says since the
  deaths of her two sisters she felt as if she had to be “three daughters” for
  their father. Ruth Dubois, the Wilkinsons’ daughter, is delivering her victim
  impact statement. She says in Heather’s final moments of life she was worrying
  about her family: She was more concerned about our own family, our work, our
  kids, than she was about her own sudden and unexpected health crisis … I miss
  her daily and life feels less bright without her. Dubois says she grew up with
  Don and Gail as a “constant” in her life. She says the pair cared deeply for
  those around them. Dubois says it’s horrible to know that the kindness of her
  parents and Don and Gail were used to lure them to the fatal lunch. She says:
  The world seems colder and harsher knowing this. Erin Patterson was in tears
  during Wilkinson’s statement, watching on quietly throughout. Her hands sat in
  her lap, the fingers turning over constantly as he neared the end of his
  statement. When Wilkinson finished, she reached for tissues from a box in
  front of her in the dock, and dabbed at her eyes and nose. Wilkinson says he
  is “compelled to seek justice” for the deaths of Heather, Don and Gail. But he
  says for his attempted murder, he offers Patterson forgiveness. He says: I
  encourage Erin to receive my offer of forgiveness for those harms done to me …
  I bear her no ill will. He says his prayer for Patterson is that she will use
  her time in jail “wisely”. He says: Now I am no longer Erin Patterson’s victim
  and she has become the victim of my kindness. ‘I only feel half alive’ without
  wife Heather, Ian Wilkinson tells court Wilkinson says a “very important
  member of our family is missing”. He says: The greatest impact on Erin’s
  actions on me has been to deprive me of Heather’s company and Heather’s
  important place in our family … The silence in our home is a daily reminder. I
  continue to carry a heavy burden of grief over her untimely death. It’s a
  truly horrible thought to live with that somebody could decide to take her
  life. I only feel half alive without her. At this point, Wilkinson stops to
  wipe tears away from his eyes and is joined at the bar table where he is
  standing by his daughter, Ruth Dubois. Wilkinson says his life is also
  “greatly impoverished” by the deaths of Don and Gail Patterson. Wilkinson is
  delivering his victim impact statement in court. He begins by describing his
  wife, Heather, who was murdered by Patterson. He says: She was a
  compassionate, intelligent, brave, witty, simply a delightful person who loved
  sharing life with others … She was generous in her attitudes and with her
  resources. If she could help somebody, she would. Wilkinson says Heather had a
  great sense of humour and it was a “joy” to be her in company. His voice
  begins to crack as he says the pair shared a close marriage relationship for
  44 years. Together we faced life as a team and we delighted in each other’s
  company. Wilkinson says the pair’s six children were thrown into an
  unprecedented situation where they had to take medical responsibility for
  their parents. He says the trauma they experienced over their mother’s death
  and his attempted murder has left “deep wounds.” Ian Wilkinson to deliver
  first victim impact statement Justice Christopher Beale says there are seven
  victim impact statements. The first victim impact statement will be from Ian
  Wilkinson, the sole surviving lunch guest, the court hears. Wilkinson will
  read his statement in court. Erin Patterson, appearing gaunt and drawn
  compared with when she appeared in court for her trial, just responded in the
  affirmative to four questions regarding her particulars. There are about 10
  members of the Wilkinson and Patterson family in court, including Ian
  Wilkinson, but not Simon Patterson. Patterson’s plea hearing has begun in
  Victoria’s supreme court. She will hear her victims’ loved ones give
  statements about how the crime has impacted them. Welcome to our live coverage
  of Erin Patterson’s plea hearing. On 7 July, Patterson was found guilty of
  murdering her estranged husband’s parents, Don and Gail Patterson, and his
  aunt Heather Wilkinson. A Victorian supreme court jury also found Patterson
  guilty of attempting to murder Heather’s husband, Ian Wilkinson. In the
  pre-sentencing hearing, the prosecution and defence will make arguments about
  factors supreme court judge Justice Christopher Beale should take into account
  when sentencing Patterson. The hearing also gives loved ones of the victims a
  chance to tell the court how the crime has affected them. The prosecution has
  flagged “a lot” of victim impact statements will be heard. The hearing is
  expected to begin at 10.30am.
