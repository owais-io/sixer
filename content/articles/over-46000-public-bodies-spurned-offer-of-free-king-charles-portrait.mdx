  It was a celebratory multimillion pound scheme to mark the beginning of King
  Charles III’s reign. Free portraits of the king were offered to all public
  bodies – every town hall, university, hospital and even jobcentre – so the new
  monarch’s visage could gaze down on his subjects. The initiative would provide
  “a reminder of the example set by our ultimate public servant”, said the then
  Tory deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden. But the current government is
  proving coy about where exactly any of the images of King Charles ended up
  after it admitted more than 46,000 public institutions had showed no interest.
  In what has been described as an “absurd” decision about a scheme to
  distribute large portraits of the king to be hung in public view, it is
  refusing to say which schools, hospitals and job centres did request them,
  saying it could “give rise to controversy” and create “negative public
  perception”. More than £2.7m was spent meeting requests for the pictures and
  while take-up was patchy, more than 20,000 images of Charles in a medal-laden
  Royal Navy uniform were sent out – a 31% hit rate. But the reluctance to
  reveal where they ended up has emerged from a Guardian freedom of information
  request which the Cabinet Office has been resisting for many months. Last
  October it rejected the request for the information by arguing disclosure
  would be an “actionable breach of confidence”. In effect it implied a public
  authority which requested a portrait of the king to display in public might
  sue the government for revealing that it had done so. When the Guardian
  appealed on the grounds that “requesting a portrait of the king funded by the
  taxpayer for the express purpose of being publicly displayed cannot reasonably
  be considered a confidential matter”, it dropped that justification and
  changed tack to claim release would “prejudice the effective conduct of public
  affairs”, a different exemption under the Freedom of Information Act. It said
  disclosure “would be likely to trigger questions about why certain
  organisations requested the portrait and (by extension) why others did not”
  and that organisations would be distracted from operational activity by having
  to answer them. One royal historian said it was the latest example of the
  government acting to protect the reputation of the monarchy and a sign of
  anxiety in Whitehall about any further undermining of the institution’s
  reputation. The refusal comes amid a steady decline in the proportion of the
  adult population who believe the monarchy is good for Britain, falling from
  60% in July 2019 to 51% in March 2024, according to You Gov. The combined
  proportion of people who thought it was either bad or neither good nor bad
  rose in the same period from 34% to 44%. Graham Smith, the chief executive of
  the anti-monarchy campaign group Republic, said declining public support meant
  “the chances of there being controversy around spending money on portraits is
  far more likely than in the past”. The government has already said that less
  than a third of eligible public institutions asked for a portrait, including
  only 3% of hospitals, 7% of universities and only one in four Church of
  England churches. National and local government bodies were far more
  enthusiastic with 73% making requests, while every one of the 23 coastguard
  bodies received a portrait. But overall more than 46,500 public institutions
  that could have ordered a portrait did not. “The public may have an interest
  in knowing which institutions applied for the King’s portrait,” the government
  said in its freedom of information response. “However, the likely motivation
  behind such interest may focus more on identifying which organisations did not
  apply rather than understanding government decision making or policy
  effectiveness. This type of scrutiny does not necessarily serve a broader
  public interest and could unfairly single out institutions for criticism over
  a discretionary decision that does not impact their ability to provide public
  services. This type of negative attention could discourage organisations from
  engaging in similar schemes in the future due to negative media coverage or
  reputational harm.” Transparency could cause enough people to ask why a given
  school or hospital did or did not request a portrait, that it could distract
  the public body from its work and that releasing the facts of the matter could
  cause “negative media coverage or reputational harm”, the Cabinet Office said.
  Smith said it was unacceptable to maintain secrecy around public spending by
  cash-strapped public institutions in order to avoid controversy. “The whole
  point of freedom of information is to allow the public to judge the conduct
  and decisions of public authorities,” he said. “It is up to the public to
  determine whether they criticise those who do order or don’t order the
  portrait.” Dr Ed Owens, a royal historian, called the refusal “a form of
  obfuscation”. He said that releasing the information “would shed light on the
  fact that there isn’t a great deal of interest in him”. “The fact that
  hospitals haven’t unanimously requested portraits suggests there’s a
  disconnect between the monarchy’s public image when it seeks to nurture
  relationships with public institutions like NHS hospitals and their actual
  relationship with the monarchy,” he said. “If we were to go back 100 years
  you’d almost certainly see a picture of the king in most public and many
  private institutions and many private homes as well. In terms of the
  significance of this particular figure to ordinary people’s lives, I think it
  is very telling.” He described the decision to withhold the information as
  “more than absurd” and said: “The Cabinet Office seems to be playing an active
  role in seeking to protect the reputation of the monarchy … they are clearly
  anxious about this kind of information being used to discredit and to further
  undermine the monarchy’s public image.”
