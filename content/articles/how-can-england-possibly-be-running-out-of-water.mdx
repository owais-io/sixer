  During the drought of 2022, London came perilously close to running out of
  water. Water companies and the government prayed desperately for rain as
  reservoirs ran low and the groundwater was slowly drained off. Contingency
  plans were drafted to ban businesses from using water; hotel swimming pools
  would have been drained, ponds allowed to dry up, offices to go uncleaned. If
  the lack of rainfall had continued for another year, it was possible that taps
  could have run dry. That, however, was just a taster of what could come down
  the line. On Tuesday, the government announced a “nationally significant”
  water shortage in England, which means the whole country is at risk of running
  out if the dry weather continues. People across England are already banned
  from using hosepipes, with more restrictions probable over coming months. The
  UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH), an independent research
  institute, has warned of exceptionally low river flows. Reservoirs are also at
  extremely low levels and groundwater is dwindling. Droughts are generally
  two-year events. A year of dry weather means water supplies are running out –
  that is what is happening now. Things really come to a head if the following
  year does not bring above average rainfall. That is when the shortages start
  to bite, with farmers unable to irrigate and households and businesses hit
  with sweeping restrictions. With reservoirs at record lows and stream flows
  exceptionally low, England is desperate for rain. Forecasts indicate that by
  2055 England’s public water supply could be short by 5bn litres a day without
  urgent action to future-proof resources, the equivalent to more than a third
  of the supplies available today. The effect on the economy will be profoundly
  negative. The thinktank Public First has estimated that the economic cost of
  water scarcity could be £8.5bn over this parliament. So how on earth did
  famously rainswept England, notorious the world over for being green and wet
  with our national symbol pretty much a furled umbrella, come to this?
  Britain’s geology and climate means there should be plenty of water.
  Underground in the south of England the rock is made of chalk, which is very
  soft and porous. These layers of rock filter rainwater into some of the
  cleanest water in the world, collecting in huge aquifers that have been tapped
  by local residents for centuries. Water companies now use those aquifers to
  provide the majority of the drinking water in some parts of the south. Further
  north, the rock underfoot is harder; sandstone and limestone, so lacking the
  benefits of the chalk aquifer. But it tends to receive more rainfall than the
  south, so there has generally been plentiful water from the skies to fill the
  reservoirs on which the northern water companies rely. There are also the
  rivers that crisscross the country, which (when clean) include gin-clear chalk
  streams buzzing with mayflies and thronging with salmon and other fish. The UK
  is one of the rainier places in Europe. Some areas are wetter than others. In
  England, the Lake District generally receives an average of 2,000mm of
  rainfall a year, while in parts of the south-east it is as low as 700mm.
  Perhaps it is because the country has always had such rich resources, that
  they have been taken for granted. Running out of water has never really been
  in question. But with population growth and climate breakdown, this is
  starting to look like folly. It was in the 17th century that the New River
  Company began piping water into London’s homes from the springs in nearby
  Hertfordshire for the very rich. Slowly the technology began to spread and
  grow in popularity. Over the next decades, England’s population would rise
  dramatically and the water systems of its rapidly growing cities would come
  under increasing stress. When the Great Stink hit London in 1858 during a
  heatwave, the civil engineer Joseph Bazalgette had already been commissioned
  to draw up plans to urgently update the city’s sewage system. Known for his
  tirelessness, Bazalgette checked every connection himself, making thousands
  upon thousands of notes, and saved many lives as the system diverted sewage
  away from the city and into the Thames estuary. Later, treatment centres were
  added to purify the water. Today, consumers are used to having water coming
  out of a tap and they want to use a lot of it. Future generations, who will be
  dealing with long, dry summers, would probably be shocked at the profligate
  way clean tap water was used to flush toilets, water gardens and run washing
  machines. UK households use more water, mostly on showering and bathing, than
  other comparable European countries, at about 150 litres a day per capita. For
  France the average is 128, Germany 122 and Spain 120 (although in Italy its
  243 litres a day). And the waste starts long before it gets to people’s taps.
  Water companies in England and Wales lose about 1tn litres of water through
  leaky pipes each year. The industry has said that about 20% of all treated
  water is lost to leaks. The water firms have pledged to halve leakages by
  2050. Meanwhile, the annual pipe replacement rate is 0.05% a year across all
  water companies: much of the sewage system in London, for example, has not
  been significantly updated since Bazalgette and his colleagues installed it in
  the 19th century. No new reservoir has been built in 30 years despite
  significant population growth and climate breakdown meaning longer, drier
  summers during which the country desperately needs to store water. The
  reservoirs England does have are at their lowest levels in at least a decade,
  just 67.7% full on average. According to Dr Wilson Chan, a hydroclimatologist
  at UKCEH, “above average rainfall over several months is needed to ease
  pressures on water resources”. Was it the privatisation of the water and
  sewerage industry in 1989 that has led to this situation? England’s water
  system has been widely criticised, and privatisation has been blamed for a
  lack of investment in infrastructure. Some say this is owing to the water
  companies paying out dividends rather than using the money raised by customer
  bills solely for investment in infrastructure; others blame a privatised
  regulated monopoly system that has prioritised low customer bills over
  investment. Experts have also pointed to the regulatory system. Water company
  drought plans compel firms to follow a series of steps before they can
  increase abstraction, taking more water from reservoirs, rivers and the ground
  to supply customers, beginning with reducing consumption (a hosepipe ban).
  “Water companies must now take action to follow their drought plans – I will
  hold them to account if they delay,” says the water minister, Emma Hardy. “We
  face a growing water shortage in the next decade.” But water companies believe
  that people hate being told to reduce their water consumption, so avoid
  hosepipe bans as much as possible. It does not help that bans may also lead to
  customers giving low satisfaction marks for their company, which are then
  taken into account by the regulator. The end result of these incentives;
  unsustainably high levels of abstraction from the natural environment, most of
  which will not be replaced by rain on the same timescale. Stores of water such
  as fossil aquifers and chalk streams recharge over centuries. The Environment
  Agency (EA) assess that 15% of surface water bodies and 27% of groundwater
  bodies in England have unsustainable levels of abstraction. “We are calling on
  everyone to play their part and help reduce the pressure on our water
  environment,” says Helen Wakeham, the EA’s director of water and chair of the
  National Drought Group. “Water companies must continue to quickly fix leaks
  and lead the way in saving water.” This is not just a management problem. As
  climate breakdown accelerates, rainfall patterns are changing fast, and water
  will increasingly become less available at certain times of year. As Sir David
  King, a former UK chief scientific adviser who chairs the Climate Crisis
  Advisory Group, says: “Drought in England is no longer a warning. It is a
  clear signal that climate collapse is unravelling our water, food and natural
  systems right now. “This crisis demands a fundamental shift that places real
  value on our planet and environment, invests in nature, restores water cycles
  and transforms how we use every drop. If we rise to this moment we can turn
  crisis into opportunity, delivering economic resilience, ecological renewal
  and climate leadership.” The UK is not the only country that is already
  struggling to deal with changing weather patterns. Almost half of Europe is in
  drought, with wildfires tearing across the continent and farmers struggling to
  grow crops. Many of the economies of Southern Europe are dependent on sunny
  weather that has historically made the region the perfect place to grow
  vegetables for export. Scientists are concerned that farming in certain
  southern European countries will become less and less viable. More than 90
  million people in eastern and southern Africa are facing extreme hunger after
  record-breaking drought across many areas has led to widespread crop failures
  and the death of livestock. As the impacts of the climate crisis unfurl around
  the world, is the UK government awake to the scale of the problem? Nine new
  reservoirs are in the pipeline to be built before 2050, while there are
  consultations on reducing demand for water. But this may be too little, too
  late; many housing developments are on pause because of water scarcity. The
  first new reservoir planned for Abingdon in Oxfordshire is sited in the same
  place as the government’s new datacentre zone, leading to fears the water will
  be used to cool servers rather than serve customers in one of the most
  water-stressed areas of the UK. Green homes experts have said government
  building codes for new housing should include rainwater harvesting for
  internal use such as in lavatories and washing machines. People with gardens
  could use a water butt in summer, so that clean tap water is not being pumped
  through a hose into garden plants. Reducing time in the shower by a minute can
  save water, says Waterwise, while green building groups recommend the use of
  water-saving shower heads. A recent government commissioned report recommends
  smart water meters are installed nationally, so households who use sprinklers
  and fill swimming pools are charged more than those who are more frugal with
  their use. More broadly, farmers could build reservoirs on their land to
  reduce the need for irrigation. Nature-based solutions could be used too, such
  as releasing beavers that create dams and hold water in the system, or
  restoring wetlands. “We need to build more resilience into our rivers and
  their catchment areas with nature-based solutions at scale, such as healthy
  soils that allow water to filter into the ground and not rush off taking the
  soil with it; riverside tree planting to provide shade and further slow the
  flow of water; wetlands to store and slowly release water, and rewiggling
  streams to raise the water table and purify pollutants,” says Mark Lloyd, the
  chief executive of the Rivers Trust. “We also need to finally implement the
  use of rainwater rather than drinking water where we can, such as car washing,
  gardening, washing pets, filling paddling pools and flushing the loo. Other
  water-stressed countries have used this approach for decades and we need to
  join that party.”
