  The demo of All Will Rise begins with a win for lawyer Kuyili. She has just
  successfully argued in front of a court that a river running through the
  fictional version of the Indian city of Muziris should have the same rights as
  a person. According to Kuyili, this has precedent – after all, companies can
  argue in court similarly to individual people. The excitement over this
  historic win doesn’t last long as, soon after, the river is polluted by a
  large oil spill, which catches fire, the toxic smoke enveloping several
  neighbourhoods. Pollution on this scale has devastating effects, so Kuyili and
  her colleagues begin investigating. All Will Rise is effectively a
  deck-building game built around verbal sparring. In order to prepare for an
  important conversation, you first send Kuyili and her colleagues to different
  people in the community to gather information. Those trips net you cards,
  which you can then use as arguments. Claims cards can appeal to different
  emotions and each one has a different validity based on the information you
  have gathered. Saying that a corporation’s illegal waste disposal is
  responsible for the pollution of the river, for example, may get your opponent
  fired up, but if the card is mere speculation, as opposed to something you can
  back up with definitive proof, they may reject it. While it’s a lot to absorb
  at first, the card-based conversations aim to represent the many ways a
  conversation can go. While developer Speculative Agency cites courtroom comedy
  Ace Attorney as one of its inspirations, shouting “Objection!” will not
  necessarily get you what you want here. “Talking to people in All Will Rise is
  based on the idea that you often partner with another person when you’re
  having a conversation,” Speculative Agency’s co-founder and producer Niels
  Monshouwer says. “In Dutch we use the word gesprekspartner, conversational
  partner, for the person you’re talking to, and conveying that feeling of
  partnering with someone was important to us.” In conversation and information
  gathering, characters expend emotional energy, a system based on what it can
  take out of you to engage in activism or simply keep up with the news.
  “Looking at the state of the world, we experience the same pain that everybody
  in their right mind is having,” says narrative director Meghna Jayanth. “But
  every time we meet, we feel empowered, stronger, happier. There are so many
  people out there trying to do the right thing. Don’t stay alone – organise,
  collaborate. This is where you will feel strong. We want the game to give
  people that feeling, and hopefully take that back out into the real world.”
  All Will Rise is not only set in India. Each chapter will shed light on the
  environmental challenges in a different part of the world and people’s efforts
  to counteract them. “We haven’t completely decided yet, but we are thinking
  about Puerto Rico, the Netherlands and maybe Nigeria,” says Monshouwer. “The
  first case deals more with pollution, corporate exploitation and local
  government corruption. But we’re also thinking about topics such as
  biodiversity loss, climate change and destruction of ocean floors due to
  mining.” Speculative Agency, which is planning a Kickstarter campaign to raise
  funding for the game, wants to include countries its developers are based in,
  which Monshouwer feels is crucial for tackling these subjects with
  authenticity. Another important driver for the studio is the work of its
  science and impact director, Joost Vervoort, who is an associate professor at
  Utrecht University in the Netherlands, working at the intersection of games
  and sustainability. Vervoort’s research group Anticiplay, has already explored
  how the climate crisis can be dealt with in games and is working to make sure
  All Will Rise can empower players with real-life facts around climate
  activism. The team has found that while the number of games tackling
  real-world issues is rising, there is still a lot of space for improvement.
  “In our first chat together we found that too many games that deal with
  climate change, pollution or other forms of societal collapse fall into two
  categories: green god games and toxic wasteland games,” says Monshouwer.
  “Toxic wasteland games are games where the collapse is a backdrop and the
  message is that there is no hope. Green god games put you into the shoes of an
  omnipotent being that decides where to put magic machines that clean up
  pollution. It oversimplifies the problem to a technical instead of a societal
  one, and nobody in the world has that much power. We wanted to make games
  about the process of change and what you can do as an individual within a
  community, instead of being the lone hero.” While the subjects that All Will
  Rise tackles are heavy, Jayanth says that it is a joyful game at its core. The
  team has even described the game as “inappropriately joyful” given, well,
  everything. “If we look around at the world right now, it would be easy to say
  it’s inappropriate to feel joy,” says Jayanth, who has long used her position
  in the gaming industry for activism. “But joy powers transformation. Rage does
  too, and we have plenty of that in the game as well. But we as a team feel
  like hope is the only useful political response to the challenges facing us
  all.” Ultimately, All Will Rise is meant to show that it’s never too late to
  get involved in activism, even though the challenge can feel daunting. “Our
  ideal reaction to the game would certainly be if someone went out and got
  involved,” Jayanth says. “There are many more types of activism than tying
  yourself down somewhere or joining a demonstration, and we hope people will
  feel inspired to give it a try.” • All Will Wise is set for release on PC,
  date is to be confirmed
