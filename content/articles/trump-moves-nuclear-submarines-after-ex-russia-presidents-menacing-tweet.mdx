  Donald Trump has said that he has deployed nuclear-capable submarines to the
  “appropriate regions” in response to a threatening tweet by Russia’s former
  president Dmitry Medvedev, suggesting that he would be ready to launch a
  nuclear strike as tensions rise over the war in Ukraine. In a post on Truth
  Social on Friday, Trump wrote that he had decided to reposition the nuclear
  submarines because of “highly provocative statements” by Medvedev, noting he
  was now the deputy chairman of Russia’s security council. Medvedev had earlier
  said that Trump’s threats to sanction Russia and a recent ultimatum were “a
  threat and a step towards war”. “I have ordered two Nuclear Submarines to be
  positioned in the appropriate regions, just in case these foolish and
  inflammatory statements are more than just that,” Trump responded. “Words are
  very important, and can often lead to unintended consequences, I hope this
  will not be one of those instances.” He did not specify whether he was
  referring to nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed submarines. Asked later by
  reporters why he ordered the submarine movement, Trump said: “A threat was
  made by a former president of Russia and we’re going to protect our people.”
  Medvedev, who was sidelined when Vladimir Putin returned to the presidency in
  2012, is also an avid fan of X, formerly Twitter, where he often posts
  aggressive and curiously worded attacks against western countries and leaders
  in the evening in Moscow. Earlier this week, Medvedev had attacked Trump for
  shortening his timeline for Russia to make progress toward peace with Ukraine
  from 50 days down to just 10, saying that he was ready to impose sanctions and
  other financial penalties against Russia if it didn’t comply. “Trump’s playing
  the ultimatum game with Russia: 50 days or 10,” Medvedev wrote in a post. “He
  should remember 2 things: 1. Russia isn’t Israel or even Iran. 2. Each new
  ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war. Not between Russia and Ukraine,
  but with his own country. “Don’t go down the Sleepy Joe road!” he added,
  referring to the former US president Joe Biden. Some security analysts called
  Trump’s move a rhetorical escalation with Moscow but not necessarily a
  military one, given that the US already has nuclear-powered submarines that
  are deployed and capable of striking Russia. Trump has voiced frustration with
  Putin, who he said had been stalling on Trump’s efforts to broker a ceasefire
  between Russia and Ukraine, a campaign promise that he said that he could
  achieve in just 24 hours. On Thursday he described Russia’s continued attacks
  on civilian areas as “disgusting”. “I go home. I tell the first lady, ‘You
  know, I spoke to Vladimir today. We had a wonderful conversation.’ She said,
  ‘Oh, really? Another city was just hit,’” he said in at the White House last
  month. Putin has not responded to Trump’s ultimatum. On Friday, he said he
  wanted a “lasting and stable peace” in Ukraine but gave no indication that he
  was willing to make any concessions to achieve it, after a week in which
  Russian missiles and drones again caused death and destruction across Ukraine.
  “We need a lasting and stable peace on solid foundations that would satisfy
  both Russia and Ukraine, and would ensure the security of both countries,”
  said Putin, speaking to journalists on Friday, a week before a new deadline
  imposed by Trump for hostilities to cease. Putin has periodically claimed to
  be interested in peace, but only on terms wholly unacceptable to Kyiv. Last
  week, the third round of direct talks between Russia and Ukraine took place in
  Istanbul, but broke up in less than an hour and have so far led to no
  agreements except on prisoner exchanges. In an apparent reference to Trump’s
  comments, Putin said on Friday: “As for any disappointments on the part of
  anyone, all disappointments arise from inflated expectations. This is a
  well-known general rule.”
