  Tax calculations can be, well, taxing, so a message from HMRC saying that
  there’s been a mistake may not ring too many alarm bells. Some bring good
  news: you have overpaid and are owed a refund, but others claim you owe money.
  In both cases there’s an imminent deadline to act – sometimes with the threat
  of legal action, or penalties if you don’t. Scammers are taking advantage of
  people’s fears over bills to steal personal and banking information. Automated
  phone calls, and messages sent by text and email, typically tell you that you
  need to click on a link and log in to make a payment or claim a refund. In the
  year to 31 July, HMRC received more than 170,000 reports of scams, of which
  more than 47,000 involved fake refunds. These happen year-round, but often
  catch people out around the time of deadlines for self-assessment tax returns.
  HMRC says it will never contact you in that way to ask you to claim a refund,
  or give personal details, and that it never leaves voicemail messages
  threatening legal action or arrest. What the scam looks like Messages can be
  very convincing and bear the logo and details of HMRC. They will tell you to
  act quickly so you feel panicked into responding. There will be a link, and
  the website it takes you to may also be very convincing. However, check the
  URL and it won’t be an official gov.uk address. Caller ID can be spoofed so it
  appears that it is genuinely HMRC getting in touch. What to do If you think
  you may genuinely be owed a refund, or are concerned that you have underpaid,
  you can find out via your tax account. HMRC lists the areas that it may want
  to contact people about, and the ways in which it may do so. You can check
  this list to find out what details appear on genuine messages. Report scam
  messages to HMRC. You can forward emails to phishing@hmrc.gov.uk and texts to
  60599. Do not trust caller ID. Put the phone down and call back later, or
  check your account online.
