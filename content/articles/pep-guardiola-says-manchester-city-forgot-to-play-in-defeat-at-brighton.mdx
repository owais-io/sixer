  Pep Guardiola said his team “forgot to play” after they gave up a lead to lose
  2-1 at Brighton. It was Manchester City’s second defeat of the season, the
  first time they have lost two of their first three league games in 21 years.
  City had taken the lead through Erling Haaland and seemed to have the game
  under control when the Brighton manager, Fabian Hürzeler, made a quadruple
  substitution after an hour and levelled from a James Milner penalty seven
  minutes later. “We played brilliantly the first hour but conceded a goal and
  then forgot to continue playing,” said Guardiola. “We decided to play long but
  we were not good enough. Sometimes the momentum changes the shapes. I used to
  be a player. I understand this.” Before the collapse, Guardiola had seen
  positive signs. “I had the feeling we are more active compared to last
  season,” he said, “but last season we lost to Spurs and Brighton and this
  season it happened again. It’s difficult at the start of the season, but we
  have to find a way to win games.” He also confirmed Rayan Cherki is likely to
  be out for two months with a thigh injury. Brajan Gruda claimed Brighton’s
  winner in the 89th minute. “At that moment, we were tired.” Guardiola said,
  pointing out that if Abdukodir Khusanov had not gone off injured four minutes
  earlier, his pace might have covered the gap that undid City. “We are missing
  the level,” said Rodri, after his first league start in almost a year. “It is
  a matter of the team and the changes, new players have to adapt and, of
  course, when you change the team that much it is difficult. But some of the
  mistakes we are making are kids’ mistakes, not concentrating and paying
  attention. The reality is that we have to raise the level if we want to
  compete.” Hürzeler spoke of “a feeling that comes from inside” as having
  guided his substitutions. “In some moments my body says something to me. Not
  just in football but generally in life you need to have the courage to take
  the decisions you want to if you feel they are the right thing to do. But with
  four subs you don’t change the game,” he said. “You need 11 players who are
  changed by the subs, by their energy and belief.” He also paid tribute to
  Milner who, at 39, came off the bench to score the equaliser from the penalty
  spot. “He always has the belief no matter against whom you are playing, and if
  you have these believers in your crew, it’s like a positive virus that
  transports this to your teammates and the crowd. One has the spark and the
  spark becomes like a fire.”
