  France’s embattled prime minister looks likely to be ousted and his government
  toppled next month in a high-stakes confidence vote that could plunge the EU’s
  second-biggest economy into even deeper political crisis. François Bayrou said
  on Monday that he would seek parliamentary backing for his unpopular plans to
  shore up France’s ailing public finances on 8 September, asking deputies to
  “confirm the scale” of spending cuts he says are needed to save €44bn (£38bn)
  a year. “We face an immediate danger, which we must tackle … otherwise we have
  no future,” he said of the country’s huge debt burden, adding that the vote
  would focus on whether MPs agreed with the gravity of the danger, and choose
  the path to fix it. He said: “There are moments … when only a calculated risk
  can allow you to escape a more serious risk. It is a matter of the survival of
  our state, the image of our nation, and each and every family.” Bayrou said
  France was going through a “decisive moment”. If the government secured a
  majority in the confidence vote, it would be confirmed, he said, but “if it
  does not have a majority, the government will fall”. Early reactions suggested
  the centrist prime minister could well lose his gamble, toppling a government
  that was formed only last December after the premature collapse of his
  predecessor Michel Barnier’s even shorter-lived administration. The leader of
  the opposition party National Rally (RN), Jordan Bardella, said his far-right
  party would “never vote in favour of a government whose decisions are making
  the French suffer”. Bayrou had in effect announced “the end of his
  government”, he said. Manuel Bompard of the radical left Unbowed France (LFI)
  said: “The chips are down, and it is up to everyone to stake out their
  position clearly.” His party’s deputies “will vote on 8 September to bring
  down the government”, Bompard said. The Green party leader, Marine Tondelier,
  said on social media her parliamentary group would also vote against the
  government, as did the Communist party (PCF). Tondelier said Bayrou’s
  announcement amounted “de facto to a resignation”. Olivier Faure, the leader
  of the centre-left Socialist party (PS), also said it would vote against the
  government. Bayrou had “chosen to go”, Faure said, adding that it was
  “unimaginable” that PS or any other opposition party would vote for him.
  Bayrou acknowledged that the vote was a gamble. “Yes, it’s risky – but it’s
  even riskier not to do anything,” he told a press conference. France’s budget
  deficit hit 5.8% of GDP last year, nearly double the official EU limit of 3%.
  Opposition leaders said that if the government did fall, they would demand the
  dissolution of parliament and new elections. Bardella said: “Our fellow
  citizens are waiting for a change and a return to the ballot box: we are
  ready.” Nevertheless, President Emmanuel Macron, whose shock decision to
  dissolve parliament in June 2024 produced an assembly divided into three
  opposing groups, none of them with anything like a majority, is thought
  unlikely to want to repeat the experiment. Analysts believe Macron is more
  likely to try to avoid another early election, instead aiming to appoint a new
  prime minister – although who that might be, and how they might be any more
  effective, is open to question. The confidence vote is due to be held two days
  before planned protests across France against the government’s austerity
  budget that have been widely relayed on social media and are supported by LFI
  and some trade unions. The calls have drawn comparisons to the gilets jaunes
  (yellow vests) protests that erupted in 2018 over fuel price increases and the
  cost of living, eventually spiralling into a broad movement that seriously
  challenged Macron during his first term.
