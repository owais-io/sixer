  Even by Keely Hodgkinson’s standards this was astonishing. The Olympic 800m
  gold medallist had not raced for 376 days due to a series of hamstring
  problems. Yet on a blistering hot day in Poland she marked her return by
  destroying a quality field in 1min 54.74sec – the fastest time in the world
  this year by nearly two seconds. Hodgkinson’s effort was also the ninth
  fastest in history and it was perfect timing, given the world championships in
  Tokyo starts in a month. “The track here is very fast,” said Hodgkinson of the
  Stadion Slaski in Katowice. “I wanted to open my season today, I was ready and
  it worked. “I was just happy to step on the track after more than a year. But
  as I got closer to the race I got more and more relaxed. I planned to run a
  fast time because I do not have five races any more before Tokyo, I only have
  today and the meeting in Lausanne. So it had to be fast and I am happy that it
  worked.” The 23-year-old had given little away about her form in training
  during Friday’s pre-race press conference. Yet she signalled her intent first
  by setting the wavelights to finish in 1:54.50 and then by immediately moving
  into second place behind the pacemaker, Lisanne de Witte. The field was
  already strung out in single file as the bell sounded in 56.09, with the
  Kenyan Lilian Odira and Oratile Nowe of Botswana in close pursuit. Yet when De
  Witte dropped out with 300m to go, Hodgkinson showed no signs of rust as
  pushed hard to extend her lead. Coming into the home straight she was 10m
  clear of the field and she continued to push on to finish in her second
  fastest time ever, before jumping up and down in delight. Behind her, Odira
  took second in a personal best of 1:56.52 with Nowe third in a national record
  of 1:56.72. But it was a measure of the race that there were seven personal
  bests and two season’s bests across the field. Elsewhere, Faith Kipyegon
  narrowly missed out on an attempt on the 3,000m world record set by China’s
  Wang Junxia in 1993. Kipyegon had been on course to break it with a kilometre
  to go but slowed to finish in 8:07.04 – less than a second behind Wang’s mark.
  In the women’s 1500m, Britain’s Georgia Hunter Bell finished third in 3:56.00
  behind Gudaf Tsegay, who ran 3:50.52.
