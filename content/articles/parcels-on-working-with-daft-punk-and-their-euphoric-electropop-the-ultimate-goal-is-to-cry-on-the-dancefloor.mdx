  Within six months of forming in high school in Byron Bay and just a handful of
  gigs, Parcels packed their bags and moved to Berlin. The band’s five members
  were barely out of their teens with no real plan; it was purely “vibes-based”,
  as vocalist and guitarist Jules Crommelin remembers: “It’s the inevitable
  small town [thing] – you either stay forever or you leave as quick as
  possible.” That spontaneous move a decade ago turned out to be a fortuitous
  decision for the young band: Crommelin, percussionist Anatole “Toto” Serret,
  keyboardist and vocalist Louie Swain, bassist Noah Hill and keyboardist,
  vocalist and guitarist Patrick Hetherington. Their 2015 self-released debut EP
  caught the attention of the French record label Kitsuné, who signed them. A
  year later, when Parcels played their first-ever gig in Paris, a little duo
  called Daft Punk was in attendance. The dance pioneers liked what they heard
  and invited the band to their studio. The result was Parcels’ 2017 single
  Overnight, which ended up being Daft Punk’s final ever production. “[That] was
  the first time we’d ever been in a proper recording studio as a band,”
  Crommelin says. “Having them guide us and write with us and produce with us …
  They really helped us get on the tracks.” Working with Daft Punk felt like a
  “university degree of lessons”, teaching the young band how to approach and
  refine their craft. “It was just an explosion of everything … how to record,
  how to put instruments together, how precise to be,” Crommelin says. “They are
  just absolutely so tapped into detail, and really focusing on this
  infectiousness of music and just getting it right … and things just having
  magic.” Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture
  and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Parcels took those lessons
  and ran with them. The rest, you might say, is history. They released their
  self-titled debut album in 2018, with one single’s video starring Milla
  Jovovich, and chased it with an ambitious double album, Day/Night, in 2021.
  Blending Beach Boys-style vocal harmonies with disco and funk influences,
  Parcels’ simultaneously nostalgic and contemporary sound has clearly struck a
  chord – their music has topped 1bn streams worldwide. The band’s euphoric live
  performances also put them on the map. They’ve been in hot demand this year,
  playing Coachella and Glastonbury. They will return to the Red Rocks
  Amphitheatre in Colorado in October – a venue they sold out in five minutes
  last year – and kick off the Australian summer with east coast shows,
  including two gigs on the Sydney Opera House steps. Crommelin singles out
  Glastonbury as the pinnacle of a year full of highlights. “I just found that
  festival so wildly different to every other festival – just how people were,
  how people engaged with the music, the vibe, the energy of the crowd,” he
  says. “We just played an amazing show thanks to them – we got out there, and
  they were just so on for us.” The band is firing on all cylinders, but that
  couldn’t have happened if they didn’t take some time to rest after almost a
  decade of nonstop touring and recording. In 2023, Parcels hit pause for six
  months, and Crommelin returned to Australia for some downtime: “I finally got
  to be with friends and just have a normal life.” But the music never stopped –
  not really. During the break, the band members continued to write and work on
  music individually, without the pressures of deadlines or touring. It all
  comes together in their upcoming third album, Loved, which was recorded all
  around the world in studios in Byron Bay, Berlin, Sydney and Mexico. Loved
  builds on their signature disco grooves, while also taking inspiration from a
  raft of different genres – Crommelin told Billboard that Katy Perry, the
  Plastic Ono Band and the seminal post-rock group Tortoise all influenced the
  sound. Each band member’s “wildly different” musical tastes have converged to
  make something new. Serret “is deep in dance and techno”, for example, while
  Crommelin just “admire[s] it”. But “I’ve always felt that the more we can all
  go our own directions, the better the band will be,” he adds, “because when
  you’re pulling the same references, you can start to feel like you’re in an
  echo chamber.” The title of the new album has a double meaning: being loved in
  both the past and present tense. These songs are about love in all its pain
  and glory, and that duality is baked into the music. “Our music [has] this
  overarching light spirit … but the lyrics often speak towards something deeper
  and sometimes darker,” Crommelin says. “The ultimate goal is to cry on the
  dancefloor.” The members of Parcels are now approaching their 30s; two of them
  have returned to live in Australia, while the others remain in Berlin. The
  beauty of a band being together for so long is that there’s space for both
  personal and artistic growth – but what has remained unchanged is their shared
  love of music. “It’s been such a journey, us five being together over 10
  years,” Crommelin says. “Of course, from 10 years of life, everything’s
  different … [but] when we get together as a dynamic of five and when we play
  together, we sound like Parcels.” Parcels’ new album Loved is out 12 September
  (Because Music). The band is performing across Europe in September and October
  before heading to Australia in November and December. See here for all dates.
