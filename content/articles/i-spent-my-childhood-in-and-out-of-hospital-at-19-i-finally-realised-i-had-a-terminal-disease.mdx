  Yvonne Hughes was 19, and attending the funeral of a friend with cystic
  fibrosis, when she realised: “Oh shit, I’m going to die of this.” She had met
  him during shared hospital stays in childhood, and although Hughes had always
  known she had CF, she had never understood her illness as terminal until that
  day in 1992, when she stood at the back of the crowded chapel in Glasgow. For
  three days afterwards, she couldn’t stop crying. “I had a kind of meltdown.
  That’s probably the first time I thought that this thing I had was going to
  kill me.” Over the next few months, Hughes, who was studying at the University
  of Glasgow, listened to her mum, dad and older sister chatting during family
  meals as if she was a ghost at the table. “I pulled back from them. I
  deliberately didn’t talk or include myself,” she says. “I wanted them to get
  used to sitting and chatting without me, so that when I died, they wouldn’t
  notice I wasn’t there.” It’s a harrowing responsibility for a teenager to
  take, but self-erasure must have felt like a way to pre-empt death, perhaps to
  resist it. When she was growing up, cystic fibrosis was considered “a
  childhood disease” – because about half of those diagnosed did not survive
  their teens. A genetic condition in which the body creates thick, sticky
  mucus, it makes digestion difficult, damages lung function and can lead to
  respiratory failure. It affects about 160,000 people globally. Now 52, and
  enjoying what she calls a “second chance” at life more than 30 years later,
  Hughes has emerged as a comedian. We are speaking on a video call before her
  one-hour show, Absolutely Riddled, which she is performing at the Edinburgh
  fringe, based on her experiences of living with the condition. “I want to be
  true to myself and my story,” she says. Why does she think she survived when
  so many didn’t? For most of her childhood, Hughes, who works as a community
  development worker in Renfrewshire, didn’t regard herself as struggling for
  survival. Her parents didn’t sit her down in childhood to explain her illness;
  she had been diagnosed at six weeks old. But there were hospital visits and
  tablets and eating often made her vomit. Gradually, she says, she “put
  together those two words, cystic and fibrosis, with something that I had”. At
  school, she kept her illness hidden, taking her medication at home. She was
  popular; joined the Brownies, then Guides. “I’m a very level-headed person,
  but I keep a lot in my mind. I remember when I was younger thinking: ‘There’s
  no point telling people about this because everyone is dealing with something.
  I’m nothing special.’ I just got on with it.” Roughly one in every 2,500
  people are born with cystic fibrosis in the UK, Australia and the US. Hughes’s
  older sister does not have the illness and the family had no idea what it
  meant for their lives, or for Hughes herself. Only as she grew older did
  Hughes build a sense of the precariousness of her life. “My mum said to me:
  ‘We thought you were going to die, every day. We just didn’t know.’ It became
  their new normal to keep me alive.” If she got a chest infection, pleurisy or
  pneumonia, she would go into hospital, and over the years made friends on the
  CF ward, a fragile community. When the curtains were closed around a bed for a
  long time, Hughes and the other children knew not to go past. She reasoned
  with herself, to allay her fears: “People were dying around me but I put it
  down to: ‘Maybe they had a really bad infection, maybe they were worse than
  me.’” In childhood, she developed “a lot of level-headed thought processes
  around why those people died”. She found solace in the Cystic Fibrosis Trust
  magazine, and dreamed of attending one of the advertised camps. “Luckily, I
  didn’t,” she says, because in the early 1990s, scientists discovered that the
  camps were a hotbed for the spread of bacteria, present in the lungs and
  phlegm of children with CF. Many cross-infected each other, some with fatal
  consequences. Did Hughes struggle to accept that sense of herself, as both
  vulnerable and a threat? “Absolutely,” she says. Hospitals implemented a
  policy of segregation, according to bacteria carried. Hughes has the
  pseudomonas bacteria, and after her friend’s funeral in 1992, she stopped
  seeing people with cystic fibrosis in case they had different bacteria or bugs
  that might lead to cross-infection. She has stayed in touch by phone with one
  old friend. “We shared growing up in the hospital ward and I do love speaking
  to him.” But after that funeral, “I became reckless,” she says. “I thought:
  ‘Well, life’s for living. I’m just going to do what I want.’ I didn’t care
  very much for myself. I thought: ‘What’s the point?’ I spiralled.” Her 20s and
  30s passed in a blur of “festivals, partying, travelling when I could, flying
  by the seat of my pants … ” She had hoped to meet someone, and to have
  children. “I thought it would happen. And it never did.” In her 30s, her lung
  function got so low – 45%, then 36% – that she wouldn’t have been able to
  sustain a pregnancy anyway. “That was something I tried to grieve. But over
  the course of a year, I thought: ‘I’d rather be alive.’ My mantra became: ‘I’d
  rather have a full and short life than a long and unhappy one.’ These kinds of
  philosophical things got me through.” Hughes doesn’t have a mantra now –
  “other than trying to be funny”. The frequency of her performances range from
  three times a week to every few weeks, depending on her health needs. But even
  in her reckless phase, she embodied a stoicism, too. She worked throughout –
  at a call centre, a radio station, the CF Trust. “I just had to keep going,
  pay my bills and mortgage.” Did she ever wonder: “Why me?” She has had years
  of spitting out and swallowing mucus – “constant, constant” – hankies
  everywhere, non-stop sterilising of stuff, endless medication and pain, unable
  to take the next breath for granted. As a child, when she went into hospital,
  there was a faint sense of privilege at being given Lucozade and new slippers,
  things her sister didn’t get. But no one else in her family has the illness.
  Didn’t she feel aggrieved? “It’s a difficult question,” she says. “I’ve
  thought about ‘Why me?’ in a positive sense – that it was me because I could
  handle it. Or, I’m glad … because this has made me the way I am.” She has also
  thought, “Why at all? Why did cystic fibrosis come into being? Why have this
  weird disease that just kind of ruins lives?” While Hughes survived childhood
  by reminding herself that she wasn’t special, the differences between her life
  and others’ sharpened as she entered her 40s. She became an aunt, and bore
  close witness to her peers’ life transitions while she kept on being “just
  Yvonne – the one that never reached any potential”. “I couldn’t have a career
  because I would always get ill. I never moved social class. I always remained
  working class.” Her dad was a welder, her mother a GP receptionist.
  “Everything I did, I did myself. But it was day by day, week by week. There
  was never a plan. I always felt I could never get ahead of myself.” In 2018,
  aged 45, with deteriorating health, Hughes took redundancy from her job as
  public affairs officer at the CF Trust. Eating was difficult. Her weight
  hovered around 7 stone. She braced herself for the possibility of a lung
  transplant, but as her lung capacity dropped to 30%, she was deemed too ill
  for the waiting list. “I was like: ‘OK, that door’s closed. At this point,
  there isn’t anything else on the horizon to keep me alive.’” She completed an
  end-of-life form, and met the palliative care team. She thought: “I’ll see my
  days out with my parents, make memories and know I did well to get to 48.”
  Then, in 2020, the UK government granted access to a new drug, Kaftrio. Hughes
  had read about its worldwide trials. When the delivery driver knocked on the
  door, she told him: “You’re going to save my life.” At that point, her lung
  function was down to 26%. Within an hour or two of the first tablet, she
  started coughing. “They call it the purge,” she says. There was so much mucus
  – dark, watery and horribly fascinating – she captured it in a cup, put a lid
  on it, and stowed it in a drawer in her bedroom. “I kept that cup for a long
  time,” she says. Maybe she already knew it was a relic. The Kaftrio turned
  Hughes’s life “a whole 180, literally overnight”. There are side-effects –
  insomnia, weight gain, which have brought other challenges – but before long,
  she says, “I could breathe again without coughing. I went back to work within
  the year. I could run, I could dance, I could speak, I could stand up straight
  and cook. I used to always be bent over, catching my breath. And then all of a
  sudden that was gone. It was a miracle.” Energised, she decided to enrol in an
  evening course. Acrylic painting, maybe, or playing the keyboard? But at the
  University of Strathclyde’s Centre for Lifelong Learning, it was the flyer for
  comedy that caught her eye. “I had always loved going to gigs. Something
  clicked and I enrolled.” She performed a five-minute set for the course finale
  – and immediately wanted to do it again. “I started applying for clubs, Monkey
  Barrel and the Stand Comedy Club [both in Edinburgh]. I got Red Raw [the
  Stand’s beginners’ slot] and went from there. I want to change my life,” she
  says, “and I am doing comedy to see if I can change my life.” Nearly four
  years ago, Hughes met her partner, Alan, online. Having spent a lifetime
  feeling unable “to rely on a future”, she has had to learn to picture one –
  and to override her old instinct to absent herself to mitigate later losses.
  Sometimes, this means catching herself in the act of “pulling back” from Alan,
  and letting the pleasure she takes in his company teach her to quiet her mind.
  Life now is so different, it requires a conscious effort to remember how hard
  it was from one moment to the next. “I used to breathe so shallowly that I had
  to take a – haa! – sharp intake of breath – to feel I was breathing,” she
  says. The sound punctuated even the simplest actions – after getting into a
  car, for instance, after reaching for her seatbelt, after pulling it across
  her, after fastening it. “Now I can get in the car, pull the seatbelt over and
  go. I can walk and talk. I can laugh without wetting myself or going into a
  convulsion of coughing, pulling a muscle or breaking a rib,” she says. “It is
  a horrible, horrible disease. It suffocates you. It takes every inch of your
  breath away. And now it is something I can live with and not die from. I’ll
  probably live to get my pension.” Comedy has brought “fun, joy and laughter”
  back into Hughes’s life. But it has also given her something that nothing else
  has. “I had never found anything for me in my life. I’d never married. I had
  no children. So I had no community. Nothing,” she says. “There were people
  getting their careers and their lives sorted. Comedy was the one thing that
  was for me. And it still is. Just for me.” • Yvonne Hughes: Absolutely Riddled
