  Chelsea are in talks with RB Leipzig over a potential swap deal for Xavi
  Simons that could lead to Christopher Nkunku returning to the German club. It
  is understood Leipzig would like to re-sign the France striker, who moved to
  Stamford Bridge on a six-year deal in 2023 for £52m but has failed to settle
  in west London, as a replacement for Benjamin Sesko after his £73.7m move to
  Manchester United. Chelsea have been in negotiations with the Bundesliga club
  over a fee for Xavi Simons, with the Netherlands forward having already agreed
  personal terms despite interest from Bayern Munich. Simons joined Leipzig from
  Paris Saint-Germain in January for €50m (£43m) after two successful loan
  spells and had been expected to cost about €70m (£61m) but Chelsea are now
  pushing to include Nkunku, who they believe to be valued at £40m, as part of
  the deal. Negotiations are ongoing, with Chelsea likely to have to pay a
  sizeable fee on top for the 22-year-old, who can play in a number of attacking
  positions. Leipzig are also interested in signing Liverpool’s Harvey Elliott,
  who has interest from several Premier League clubs. Chelsea remain in talks
  with United over a move for Alejandro Garnacho and are hoping to sell Nicolas
  Jackson to help balance the books. Newcastle have shown interest in the
  Senegal forward after missing out on Sesko and other targets, although they
  are believed to be waiting to see whether Liverpool make a new bid for
  Alexander Isak after turning down a £110m offer. Jackson, who missed Chelsea’s
  4-1 pre-season win over Milan on Sunday has fallen down the pecking order at
  Stamford Bridge after the arrivals of Liam Delap and João Pedro, with Eddie
  Howe’s side believed to be frontrunners to sign the 24-year-old. He is
  understood to have trained alone on Friday after informing Chelsea that he
  would like to move, with Milan also linked with the 24-year-old. Chelsea had
  valued Jackson at £80m but are likely to accept a reduced fee of around £65m
  as they attempt to reshape their attacking options. Nkunku and Jackson were
  both left out of Friday’s friendly against Bayer Leverkusen.
