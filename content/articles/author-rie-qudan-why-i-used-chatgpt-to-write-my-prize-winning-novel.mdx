  “I don’t feel particularly unhappy about my work being used to train AI,” says
  Japanese novelist Rie Qudan. “Even if it is copied, I feel confident there’s a
  part of me that will remain, which nobody can copy.” The 34-year old author is
  talking to me via Zoom from her home near Tokyo, ahead of the publication of
  the English-language translation of her fourth novel, Sympathy Tower Tokyo.
  The book attracted controversy in Japan when it won a prestigious prize,
  despite being partly written by ChatGPT. The author speaks conversational
  English, but her translator, Jesse Kirkwood, is also on the line, interpreting
  questions and answers when needed. At the heart of Sympathy Tower Tokyo is a
  Japanese architect, Sara Machina, who has been commissioned to build a new
  tower to house convicted criminals. It will be a representation of what one
  character – not without irony – calls “the extraordinary broadmindedness of
  the Japanese people”, in that the tower will house offenders in compassionate
  comfort. In the novel, Sara, herself a victim of violent crime, wonders if
  this sympathetic approach to criminals is appropriate. Does this sympathy
  reflect Japanese society in reality? “It’s definitely prevalent,” says Qudan.
  One of the triggers for writing the novel, she adds, was the assassination of
  former prime minister Shinzo Abe in July 2022. “The person who shot him became
  the centre of a lot of attention in Japan – and his background elicited a lot
  of sympathy from people. He had grown up in a heavily religious household, and
  been deprived of freedom. That idea had been in my head for a long time, and
  when I came to write the novel, it came out again as part of the process.” The
  question of public attitudes towards criminals runs through the story, in
  serious and satirical ways. Potential residents of the tower must take a
  “Sympathy Test” to determine if they are deserving of compassion (“Have your
  parents ever acted violently towards you? – Yes / No / Don’t know”) … and the
  ultimate decision will be made by AI. Sympathy Tower Tokyo won the Akutagawa
  prize in 2024 for new or rising authors when it was first published. She was
  “delighted”, she says, but also “liberated, because once you make your debut
  as a writer, there’s a constant pressure to win this prize”. In 2022, she had
  been nominated for her book Schoolgirl, but didn’t win. “I felt I’d let people
  down by not winning the prize, and that was something I didn’t want to repeat.
  You know, with that prize it stays with you your whole life.” But the book
  also grabbed attention because Qudan said that part of it – 5% was the figure
  given, though she now says that was only an approximation – was written using
  artificial intelligence. This, she tells me, comprised parts of the novel
  which are presented as a character’s exchange with ChatGPT. But Qudan also
  “gained a lot of inspiration” for the novel through “exchanges with AI and
  from the realisation that it can reflect human thought processes in
  interesting ways”. Qudan’s use of AI, in other words, seeks not to deceive the
  reader but to help us to see its effects. One character feels pity for the
  chatbot, “condemned to an empty life of endlessly spewing out the language it
  was told to spew, without ever understanding what this cut-and-paste patchwork
  of other people’s words meant”. Does Qudan fear that AI will supplant human
  writers? “Maybe a future will come when that happens, but right now there’s no
  way an AI can write a novel that’s better than a human author.” Among Japanese
  readers, Sympathy Tower Tokyo “did get attention for using AI. But more than
  that, it was a focus on the language itself which really generated discussion;
  how the changes of language over the last few decades are affecting how people
  act or view things.” And this feeds into the key issue at the heart of Qudan’s
  book. Sympathy Tower Tokyo is really all about language, which in the book is
  not just how we express ourselves, but how we reveal ourselves. “Words
  determine our reality,” says one character. In the novel, a key debate is
  around the growth of katakana in Japan – that is, the script used to write
  foreign-derived words. Words rendered in katakana (as opposed to hiragana
  script and kanji characters, which are used to write traditional Japanese
  words) resemble transliterations of English – “negurekuto” for neglect, “fōrin
  wākāzu” for foreign workers – and to Japanese ears they are “milder, more
  euphemistic” than traditional kanji words, and can avoid “discriminatory turns
  of phrase”. The character Sara thinks “Japanese people are trying to abandon
  their own language”. Her boyfriend wants to “stop this wretched proliferation
  of katakana”. But stopping it is not easy, and probably not possible. Qudan
  explains that while older generations sometimes choose katakana over kanji, or
  vice versa, for younger generations like her – Qudan was born in 1990 –
  katakana “has become a standard which is not questioned”. This is not merely
  an academic or cultural detail, but an urgent issue for Japan’s politics
  today. In Japanese elections last month, the far-right party Sanseito surged
  in support, winning 14 seats in the upper house of parliament, where it had
  previously held only one. The party campaigns on a slogan that translates as
  “Japanese people first”, echoing Donald Trump and Maga’s “America first”. Its
  success has raised fears of an anti-foreigner backlash. Is diversity valued in
  Japan? “Unfortunately,” Qudan says, “the reality is that not all Japanese
  people welcome diversity. Twelve years ago, I had a foreign, non-Japanese
  boyfriend, and I introduced him to my parents. My mother was extremely
  unhappy. She panicked. It might have been the biggest shock in my entire life
  to see my own mother react in this way. I’d never thought of her as someone
  who discriminated against foreigners. “There are people all around you who you
  would never think hold those views, who actually do hold those views. A lot of
  Japanese people, on the surface, they know how to act in a way that makes them
  seem [welcoming of diversity]. And this discrepancy between what people think
  on the inside and what they say is a very distinctive feature.” This brings us
  back to language, and how it can both conceal and reveal. In its “Japanese
  people first” slogan, Qudan explains, the Sanseito party uses the katakana
  word for “first”, rather than the traditional Japanese kanji word. “By using
  the katakana equivalent,” Qudan says, “a lot of the negative associations can
  be replaced by neutral ones. It doesn’t trigger people in the same way.” It
  creates, in other words, a sort of plausible deniability? “Yes, yes. They know
  exactly what they’re doing. And that’s why this use of katakana requires our
  attention,” Qudan concludes. “When someone uses katakana, we should ask: what
  are they trying to hide?” • Sympathy Tower Tokyo by Rie Qudan is published on
  21 August (Penguin Books, £10.99). To support the Guardian, order your copy at
