  The Ineos Grenadiers head carer who left the Tour de France earlier this month
  after it was revealed he had been called to interview by the International
  Testing Agency (ITA) over alleged links to convicted German doping doctor,
  Mark Schmidt, worked for Manchester United in 2024. Sources at Manchester
  United have confirmed to the Guardian that David Rozman spent one month
  working at Old Trafford last year as part of what is called a “knowledge
  exchange” within Ineos Sport. Rozman is described on the Ineos Grenadiers
  website as “one of the longest-serving members of our staff” who “takes on the
  important role of head carer”. The Slovenian spent four weeks last year
  working alongside United’s soft tissue therapists as part of an exchange
  programme introduced after Sir Jim Ratcliffe became co-owner at Manchester
  United. In a statement issued to the Guardian on 24 July, Ineos said Rozman
  had spoken “informally” to the ITA in April when he was told he was not under
  investigation but added: “Following recent media allegations, David Rozman has
  now received a request from the ITA to attend an interview. Accordingly, he
  has stepped back from race duties and has left the Tour.” The allegations stem
  from a recent documentary made by ARD in Germany, which made claims linking
  Rozman to Schmidt but did not name him, with further media reports including
  alleged texts between the Ineos staff member and Schmidt from June 2012, when
  the team were racing as Team Sky. The documentary and subsequent reports were
  said to have drawn on court transcripts and in-court reporting during the
  Aderlass hearings, which resulted in Schmidt being jailed in 2021 for
  orchestrating a doping ring revolving around cross-country skiers and multiple
  cyclists between 2012 and 2019. Dave Brailsford, the head of Ineos Sport, who
  returned to the Tour de France this July after his sojourn at Manchester
  United, declined to comment on the Rozman allegations during the race.
  Brailsford was a leading figure in directing performance at Old Trafford. Also
  seconded to Carrington, United’s training ground, during refurbishment of
  their laundry facilities, was an Ineos Grenadiers team bus for use by kit
  staff at Old Trafford. British Cycling has confirmed that Rozman was also
  present, working for Team GB, at the London 2012 and Rio 2016 Olympic Games.
  His spell at Manchester United pre-dates the ARD documentary or any contact
  with the ITA. In the statement on 24 July Ineos Grenadiers said: “The team has
  acted responsibly and with due process, taking the allegations seriously
  whilst acknowledging that David is a long-standing, dedicated member of the
  team. The team continues to assess the circumstances and any relevant
  developments, and has formally requested any relevant information from the
  ITA. “To date the team has received no evidence from any relevant authority.
  In response to the team’s request for information, the ITA has advised the
  team that it cannot share any further information, due to legal and
  confidentiality restrictions. Both David and the team will of course
  co-operate with the ITA and any other authority. The team reiterates its
  zero-tolerance policy and is unable to comment further at this time.” Ineos
  Grenadiers did not respond to further requests for comment.
