  With “Untitled” (America), The Whitney celebrates 10 years in its new space
  and offers visitors a statement on what the museum is all about. Combing the
  institution’s archives, it brings together 80 years of American art, from the
  turn of the century up through the 1980s. As art historian and Whitney chief
  curator, Kim Conaty, was hard at work curating “Untitled” (America), she
  envisioned the Whitney as a place of refuge and nourishment for artists who
  have furnished new ways of seeing and new historical narratives. “When I think
  of the very brave work of artists over decades,” she said via video interview.
  “I’m excited by how it’s possible for us now through their work to see the
  questions they have put forth, the histories they have made visible. We need
  to give our support to those artists who have done that hard thinking and
  helped reveal or made visible our history and helped us see new futures.” In
  envisioning exactly what the Whitney is all about, Conaty was particularly
  inspired by a quote from Cuban-American artist Félix González-Torres, which
  reads in part: “America has always been an unattainable dream, a place to
  dream about … The America that I now know is still a place of light, a place
  of opportunities, of risks, of justice, of racism, of injustice, of hunger and
  excess, of pleasure and growth. Democracy is a constant job, a collective
  dedication.” González-Torres’s 1994 piece “Untitled” (America) figures
  prominently in the show. The piece, which consists of 12 individual strings of
  42 lightbulbs each, had long been displayed in the Whitney’s stairwell, but
  for this show it sits in a window on the museum’s western face, creating a
  kind of connection to the world beyond the galleries. “I liked the openness,
  the ambiguity, and the kind of poetry that is the challenge of
  González-Torres’s work,” said Conaty. “His decision to use the word ‘America’
  felt like it was in keeping with a kind of questioning that many people are
  having now. While we were planing the show, for some reason I kept thinking
  about that specific work. It just feels emblematic about what it is to be a
  museum of American art – evocative, abstract in a way, everyday in a way.”
  Opposite Gonzalez-Torres’s piece, “Untitled” (America) is headed by five major
  works of art that greet visitors when they step off the elevator and on to the
  museum’s seventh floor: Jasper Johns’s sculptural, landmark piece Three Flags,
  Black portraitist Barkley Hendricks’s bravura work Steve, Cherokee landscape
  artist Kay WalkingStick’s ephemeral April Contemplating May, Georgia
  O’Keeffe’s conceptual Summer Days, and Alma Thomas’s sci-fi abstraction Mars
  Dust. Taken together, the five works make for a fascinating suite that boldly
  states the many sides of the United States – as well as the many artistic
  movements within it – that “Untitled” (America) seeks to foster conversations
  around. A strength of the show is how effortlessly it fosters surprising
  dialogues between seemingly disparate pieces. Discussing the five openers,
  Conaty was enraptured by each for the different artistic pathways they opened
  up, but also saw the grouping of them as more than the sum of the individual
  parts. “They all have a way of opening up different approaches to art-making,”
  she observed. “Part of the selection was how they looked together –visually,
  how do these paintings work together in an associative way? You also have to
  imagine what are the stories behind these works.” Fostering conversations
  between the pieces was high on Conaty’s mind as she curated the show. She
  opted for a more free-flowing experience in which audiences are able to chart
  their own path through the exhibition, carefully placing and shaping the
  show’s walls to encourage free associations and connections. “We designed it
  so that all in one view you see a particular work, but you also see the work
  far behind it,” she explained. “We were thinking about sightlines that allow
  visitors to make visual connections between works. That’s where you find a lot
  of serendipity – when you’re working in a much more open architecture, you see
  so much, you take in so much. When you’re actually installing the work, you
  realize, oh this is kind of fascinating.” One of the new acquisitions
  highlighted in the show is Native American artist Fritz Scholder’s striking
  1970 work Massacre at Wounded Knee II. Tending toward abstraction, the great
  majority of the painting is done in off-white, with a thin, undulating band in
  green at the top and two abstracted figures in stark red, gesturing to the
  many murders that the painting represents. The title refers to an 1890
  incident in which well over 300 Lakota people were either killed or wounded by
  the US military as part of a long-term campaign to seize the Lakota people’s
  lands. “It depicts a site of trauma, as well as a history that’s undertold or
  told differently in history books,” said Conaty. “It looks like an abstraction
  but is actually based on historical documentary photographs. Looking at it,
  you get a sense of violence, a haunted landscape.” Conaty connected Scholder’s
  work to a grouping of Black artist Jacob Lawrence’s War Series, for which he
  received a Guggenheim, and which he made after completing service as part of
  the US Coast Guard during the second world war. The 14 works, which blend
  aspects of figuration and abstraction, document various aspects of the
  experience of fighting in the military, including shipping out, being on
  leave, battling for a beachhead, and victory. “Together, Lawrence’s and
  Scholder’s works tie into histories of the American landscape, histories that
  are tied in with trauma,” said Conaty. “They imagine alternatives to more
  heroic American narratives.” For Conaty, combing through the Whitney’s huge
  holdings was an overwhelming experience. She described the process of curating
  “Untitled” (America) as one of constant discovery, as well as an object lesson
  in the power of confronting great works of art. “There were so many works that
  we ended up falling in love with that weren’t necessarily on the a list of our
  plans,” she said. “You learn about the real power of some of these objects
  that you get used to seeing things in PowerPoint slides. When you’re in front
  of the actual thing, it’s just like that sort of powerful, visceral feeling.”
  Ultimately, Conaty hopes that “Untitled” (America) will offer audiences a
  sense of inquiry, inspiring many to continue the work of renewal that is key
  to America’s capacity to thrive, improve itself, and weather dark political
  storms. “I like that we allow that idea of America to have a subtle question
  mark,” she remarked. “It’s something that’s constantly being rethought,
  reimagined.” “Untitled” (America) is on display now at the Whitney Museum of
  American Art
