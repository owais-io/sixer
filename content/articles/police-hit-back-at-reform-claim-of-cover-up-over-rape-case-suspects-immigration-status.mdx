  Police have hit back at Reform UK’s claim of a “cover-up” over the immigration
  status of two Afghan men being prosecuted in connection with the alleged rape
  of a 12-year-old girl. Warwickshire police said they had asked the Home Office
  to confirm the full immigration status of Ahmad Mulakhil and Mohammad Kabir,
  who have been charged in the case. The force’s chief constable, Alex
  Franklin-Smith, took the unusual step of publishing a letter to the county
  council leader, Reform UK’s George Finch, who had accused authorities of a
  “cover-up” for not disclosing that the suspects are Afghan asylum seekers. In
  the letter, published on the force’s website on Tuesday night, Franklin-Smith
  wrote: “I am confident that Warwickshire police has treated this investigation
  seriously from the outset working tirelessly to identify, locate, arrest and
  charge those suspected of being responsible for this awful crime as quickly as
  possible. Warwickshire police did not and will not cover up such criminality.
  “As I confirmed to you when we spoke for the first time on Thursday 31 July,
  in events such as these it is good practice for police forces to work closely
  with partner agencies in order that we can collectively protect our
  communities.” The alleged rape of the 12-year-old girl in Nuneaton, said to
  have happened on 22 July, has become the centre of a political storm after the
  Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, amplified claims of a police cover-up. Finch,
  the youngest council leader in England, alleged within days that Mulakhil and
  Kabir were asylum seekers, but police forces do not routinely release the
  immigration status of suspects, in order to prevent the potential prejudice of
  any future trial. In a letter to the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, Finch
  claimed the police risked “disorder breaking out on the streets” of the
  county. Cooper said on Tuesday “we do want to see greater transparency” from
  police forces and that she wanted national guidance to change in relation to
  the release of information about suspects. Mulakhil has been charged with two
  counts of rape, while Kabir has been charged with kidnap, strangulation and
  aiding and abetting of the rape of a girl aged under 13. Both men are in
  custody and due to appear at Warwick crown court on 26 August. Warwickshire
  county council’s chief executive briefed Finch confidentially about the
  immigration status of the two men, according to the chief constable’s letter.
  Franklin-Smith said he confirmed to Finch last Thursday that this information
  was accurate but that “we wouldn’t be releasing immigration status at point of
  charge as we follow national guidance”. The police chief said he had asked the
  Home Office to confirm the full immigration status of the two men, given that
  Finch had released some details publicly. He added: “My responsibility is what
  Warwickshire police say and do and we will continue to work with our partners
  across the county on behalf of the Warwickshire public. I am confident that
  Warwickshire police has treated this investigation seriously from the outset,
  working tirelessly to identify, locate, arrest and charge those suspected of
  being responsible for this awful crime as quickly as possible.” A Home Office
  spokesperson said: “As the home secretary said yesterday, it has been widely
  reported that this case involves two Afghan individuals who are in the asylum
  system, some of which information has already been confirmed in open court.
  “The home secretary has made clear that there is a strong public interest in
  maximum transparency wherever that is possible. “That is why the Home Office
  and College of Policing are working together to strengthen and clarify the
  guidance around how and when information is released.”
