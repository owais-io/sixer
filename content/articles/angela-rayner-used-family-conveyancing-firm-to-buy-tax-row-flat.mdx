  Angela Rayner used a small, high-street conveyancing firm for the purchase of
  the £800,000 Hove flat at the centre of a damaging tax row, the Guardian has
  learned. The deputy prime minister employed Verrico &amp; Associates, a family
  firm based in Herne Bay, Kent, to complete the transaction, according to legal
  documents seen by the Guardian. Rayner has said she asked for legal advice
  before buying the flat in Hove, West Sussex, based on which she mistakenly
  paid the lower rate of stamp duty, believed to be about £30,000. She said on
  Wednesday, however, that she had subsequently taken advice from a senior
  barrister, which made her realise she had underpaid. The controversy has put
  Rayner’s political career in the balance and she is facing a series of
  questions about what advice she took before underpaying stamp duty by tens of
  thousands of pounds. Rayner believed she owed the lower amount of stamp duty
  because she did not own any other property. However, her family home in
  Greater Manchester is owned by a trust in the name of her son, meaning that
  for stamp duty purposes it counts as her property. Rayner, who is also the
  housing secretary, has refused to say which firms she consulted before the
  Hove transaction, although she is understood to have consulted Verrico and two
  experts in trust law. The barrister who gave the later advice is reported to
  have been Jonathan Peacock, a tax specialist who has been a king’s counsel for
  nearly 25 years. The Guardian has seen the document filed with the Land
  Registry to apply to change the name on the deed to the Hove flat. The
  document was filed by Verrico, under a reference that includes Rayner’s name.
  Neither Verrico nor advisers to Rayner responded to requests for comment.
  According to its website, Verrico is a family firm run by Joanna Verrico and
  her three daughters. The firm lists four directors and two legal secretaries
  as members of staff. Experts have said that small, high-street law firms
  offering general legal services may not have the expertise to deal with the
  complex piece of law that determines the ownership of properties held in
  trust. It is not yet known who Rayner relied on for advice on the trust.
  Downing Street said on Thursday: “The final legal opinion was received by the
  deputy prime minister on Wednesday morning, at which point she immediately
  took steps to refer herself to the independent adviser, and begin the process
  of engaging with HMRC.” It is understood she commissioned Peacock last Friday
  and received a draft opinion on Monday, while the prime minister was still
  insisting she had done nothing wrong. She received the final opinion on
  Wednesday, after which she disclosed to the Guardian she had underpaid stamp
  duty and would be referring herself to Laurie Magnus, the prime minister’s
  independent adviser on ministerial standards. Magnus will submit his report as
  soon as tomorrow, with its outcome likely to determine the deputy prime
  minister’s political fate. Rayner received backing on Thursday morning from
  the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, who said: “I have full confidence in Angela
  Rayner. She’s a good friend and a colleague. She has accepted the right stamp
  duty wasn’t paid. That was an error, that was a mistake. She is working hard
  now to rectify that, in contact with HMRC, to make sure that the correct tax
  is paid.” On Wednesday night, Rayner’s Hove flat was vandalised with graffiti
  saying “tax evader”, an act her spokesperson called “unjustifiable and beyond
  the pale”.
