  A Republican-led congressional committee has subpoenaed documents from the
  estate of the disgraced late financier Jeffrey Epstein, according to a release
  on Monday. The subpoena was signed by congressman James Comer, the Republican
  chair of the House oversight committee. The estate is registered in the US
  Virgin Islands. The letter demands that Epstein’s estate produce documents
  including a book that was compiled with notes from friends for his 50th
  birthday, his last will and testament, agreements he signed with prosecutors,
  his contacts, “Black Book”, any non-disclosure agreements, and his financial
  transactions and holdings. The move is the latest twist in a flurry of events
  surrounding the convicted sex trafficker’s links to rich and powerful people,
  especially Donald Trump whose rightwing base has long been consumed by
  conspiracy theories around Epstein. Comer wrote to Epstein’s executors,
  attorneys Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn, saying the committee “is reviewing
  the possible mismanagement of the federal government’s investigation of Mr.
  Jeffrey Epstein and Ms. Ghislaine Maxwell, the circumstances and subsequent
  investigations of Mr. Epstein’s death, the operation of sex-trafficking rings
  and ways for the federal government to effectively combat them, and potential
  violations of ethics rules related to elected officials”. Earlier this month,
  the committee issued a subpoena to the justice department for records on the
  Epstein case. About 33,000 pages were handed over last week but Democrats on
  the committee said many were already in the public domain. Additionally, the
  committee has issued deposition subpoenas to Bill and Hillary Clinton, former
  attorney generals James Comey, Loretta Lynch, Eric Holder, Merrick Garland,
  William Barr and Jeff Sessions, among others. The new demand signals that the
  committee may not be satisfied by the recent release of an interview with
  Epstein co-conspirator Maxwell – a former British socialite – that was
  recently conducted by deputy attorney general Todd Blanche. Epstein’s estate,
  which was originally valued at $600m, dwindled to $40m after it paid out an
  estimated $170m in settlements to the more than 200 women and girls who were
  victims of his sex-trafficking operation. A further $105m was paid to settle
  racketeering charges brought by the Virgin Islands. But it was recently
  re-capitalized by a tax refund to around $150m. Beneficiaries of the estate
  are said to include former girlfriend, Karyna Shuliak, and the executors,
  Indyke and Kahn.
