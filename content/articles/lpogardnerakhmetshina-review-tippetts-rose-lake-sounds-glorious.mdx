  The London Philharmonic’s single Prom this year was a concert to stir up
  wanderlust: four works all vividly evocative of far-flung places. Bookended by
  vivid depictions of the sea, it also brought the chance to hear a piece
  inspired by a very different body of water: The Rose Lake, Michael Tippett’s
  swansong, completed by the 88-year-old composer in 1993. The Rose Lake was
  written after Tippett visited Lake Retba in Senegal, where a particular kind
  of algae turns the water pink. Spare, translucent music links thickly textured
  episodes that evoke the idea of the lake itself singing through the day – a
  slow, expansive melody that changes yet remains essentially the same. It’s not
  often performed – partly because of the demands on the percussionists and the
  sheer amount of hardware it requires to create Tippett’s otherworldly
  soundscape. Ranged along the back of the Albert Hall stage, next to every
  other percussion instrument you can think of, was a long line of three dozen
  rototoms: tuned drums a bit like miniature timpani. Two of the LPO’s
  percussionists darted back and forth along this line, arms whirling and sticks
  flying, looking from a distance like panicked spiders but hitting their marks
  to weave gossamer melodic effects. Even if the piece itself has the occasional
  longueur, it sounded glorious here as conducted by Edward Gardner. Ravel’s
  song cycle Shéhérazade, conjuring up an imagined, exotic Asia, marked the
  Proms debut of the recently anointed star mezzo-soprano Aigul Akhmetshina. Her
  singing shone, riding above the orchestra with seeming ease; and yet for all
  this power she seemed more the wide-eyed innocent than the indulgent dreamer.
  Perhaps in this huge hall a more operatic approach would have captured more of
  the songs’ sensuousness. The orchestra, however, had this covered, here and
  throughout, Gardner blending sonorities seamlessly with forensic attention to
  detail. Sibelius’s 1914 tone poem The Oceanides evoked both far horizons and a
  sense of fairytale; the first movement of Debussy’s La Mer went from uneasy,
  tense dawn music to a midday blaze. The best music about the sea is not just
  waves and water but time, space and, above all, light. • Listen again on BBC
  Sounds until 12 October. The Proms continue until 13 September.
