  Poland’s president vetoes legislation to prolong benefits for Ukrainian
  refugees

  Poland’s president has vetoed legislation to prolong benefits received by
  Ukrainian refugees in Poland, following up on a campaign promise to tighten
  welfare payments amid a steady growth in anti-Ukrainian sentiment among Poles.
  Karol Nawrocki, who took office earlier this month after winning an election
  in spring, said only Ukrainians in work should receive child benefit payments.
  “We remain open to providing assistance to Ukrainian citizens – that hasn’t
  changed,” said Nawrocki in a statement. “But after three and a half years, our
  law should be amended.” Nawrocki vetoed a bill that would have extended the
  current system of payments, due to expire in September, until March 2026.
  About 1 million refugees are believed to have settled in Poland since 2022,
  the majority of them women and children. The prime minister, Donald Tusk,
  criticised the veto, as did others in his government. “We cannot punish people
  for losing their job – particularly not innocent children. This is the ABC of
  human decency,” the labour minister, Agnieszka Dziemianowicz-Bąk, wrote on X.
  The child benefit payments are 800 złoty (£162) a month. “President Nawrocki
  does not agree to the privileged treatment of citizens of other countries,”
  said a statement released by his office. “That is why he has decided to veto
  the bill on assistance for Ukrainian citizens in its current form and will
  present his own legal proposals.” The government and president are stuck in a
  legislative deadlock. Tusk had hoped that his political ally Rafał
  Trzaskowski, the mayor of Warsaw, would win the presidential election, but the
  rightwing Nawrocki won a tight contest, meaning he can veto government
  legislation. The government can also veto presidential proposals. The deputy
  prime minister and digital affairs minister, Krzysztof Gawkowski, claimed that
  by vetoing the legislation, Nawrocki also put at risk Poland’s continued
  funding of Starlink satellite internet for Ukraine. “This is the end of
  Starlink internet, which Poland provides to Ukraine as it wages war,” he wrote
  on X. A spokesperson for Nawrocki told Reuters that Starlink payments could
  continue if parliament adopted a proposed presidential bill by the end of
  September. Poland was one of the most welcoming countries in Europe to
  Ukrainians in the aftermath of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022,
  with millions of Poles volunteering to help at the border, donating to
  charitable causes or opening their homes to refugees. As time has gone on,
  anti-Ukrainian sentiment has been slowly increasing, despite studies showing
  that the influx of Ukrainians has benefited the Polish economy. A study by
  Poland’s National Development Bank this year found that Ukrainians had
  contributed more in taxes than they had received in benefits, and found that
  their labour was crucial for economic stability. The resentment has been
  fuelled by politicians looking to score points. Trzaskowski, the liberal
  presidential challenger, first called for tightening the rules for Ukrainians
  to access benefits during his failed election campaign. Back then, his
  proposed measures were supported by Tusk. Historical issues are also a
  frequent point of friction in Warsaw, with many in Poland angry over
  glorification in Ukraine of a wartime nationalist movement that was
  responsible for massacres of Jews and Poles. Nawrocki said on Monday he wanted
  to make amendments to the Polish criminal code to equate the promotion of the
  Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera with the promotion of Nazism and
  Soviet communism, banned under Polish law. Bartosz Cichocki, who was Poland’s
  ambassador to Ukraine until 2023, said current public attitudes were somewhat
  inevitable after the large numbers of Ukrainians who have made Poland their
  temporary home. “After the euphoric solidarity in 2022, the climax of social
  and political support, there had to be some sort of swing to the other side.
  We are now in this other extreme. I believe at some point this will calm down
  and we will reach a balanced approach,” he said.
