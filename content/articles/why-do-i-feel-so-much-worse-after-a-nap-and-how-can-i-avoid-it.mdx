  I woke up on the couch feeling nauseous and groggy, with a
  needle-jabbing-my-temples headache. Was it the flu? Did I eat something bad?
  There was drool on my cheek, and I glanced at the clock. I remembered checking
  the time at 1.30 pm; it was now 4pm. I’d accidentally taken a nap. Many people
  say there’s nothing like a good nap – but not me. It always gives me
  stomach-turning nausea, usually for the rest of the day. So I do my best to
  avoid dozing, even when I need the rest. In college, I’d power through even if
  I pulled an all-nighter. But now, as a mom, my no-nap lifestyle is more
  difficult to maintain. I feel like I’m playing real-life “would you rather”:
  zombie-tired from staying up all night with my crying baby or spin-cycle sick?
  Dr Waiz Wasey, a Mayo Clinic-trained sleep physician based in Scottsdale,
  Arizona, says symptoms such as nausea, dizziness and lightheadedness after a
  nap are common. These can vary from mild to day-ruining, and could have
  different causes. Because of this, he says, treatment isn’t one-size-fits-all.
  Why do I feel sick after a nap? There are several reasons people might
  experience nausea, dizziness or a generally unwell feeling after a nap. Sleep
  inertia: Wasey says sleep inertia, characterized by dizziness,
  lightheadedness, nausea and disorientation, is one of the main reasons people
  feel sick after taking a snooze. Sleep cycles typically last about 90 minutes,
  which includes three sleep stages plus REM sleep. People usually go through
  three or four sleep cycles per night, but when nappers wake without completing
  a full cycle, they may experience unpleasant, often disorienting, symptoms, he
  says. Most cases of sleep inertia are mild and resolve on their own after
  about 20 minutes, says Dr Funke Afolabi-Brown, a triple-board-certified sleep
  medicine physician based in Philadelphia. But extreme cases can involve
  “debilitating symptoms lasting four to six hours, sometimes with vomiting or
  panic-like symptoms”. Sleep inertia isn’t nap-specific: it can also happen
  when you wake from a night’s sleep. But this is less common, says Wasey, as
  someone who has completed a few sleep cycles feels more restored upon waking.
  Symptoms also tend to be more severe after a nap because of your body’s
  circadian rhythm, or natural daily sleep cycle. “Your body isn’t expecting to
  sleep in the afternoon,” Afolabi-Brown says. “Morning grogginess usually
  resolves within 15-30 minutes, while post-nap symptoms may persist longer.”
  Wasey notes that people who have sleep apnea, insomnia or sleep deprivation
  are more likely to experience more extreme symptoms of sleep inertia.
  Gastrointestinal issues: Acid reflux – also called gastroesophageal reflux or
  heartburn – is a common cause of nausea, dizziness and chest pain after
  resting, says Dr Bharat Pothuri, a board-certified gastroenterologist based in
  Houston, Texas. It is characterized by stomach acid traveling into the
  esophagus, and lying down after eating makes it worse, says Pothuri. Just
  about everyone will experience some acid reflux now and then, Pothuri adds,
  especially after eating fatty or acidic foods. But some experience more severe
  symptoms. About 20% of the US population is affected by frequent acid reflux,
  or gastroesophageal reflux disease (also known as Gerd), and is more likely to
  experience nausea after lying down. Stomach issues can show up after a full
  night’s rest, but it’s especially common for daytime snoozers because they may
  lie down directly after lunch or a snack. Dr Rucha Mehta Shah, a
  board-certified gastroenterologist in Scottsdale, Arizona, says diet plays a
  role. “Certain foods like fatty, fried, creamy, dairy or high-fiber foods can
  sit longer and cause more symptoms,” she says. Other causes: Dehydration and
  low blood sugar can make a person feel unwell upon waking, says Wasey. Sleep
  apnea, a condition where one’s breathing stops and starts abruptly during
  sleep, can cause symptoms such as headaches, sore throat and even anxiety.
  “Disruptions in breathing can lead to drops in oxygen levels that can trigger
  headaches, dizziness, and nausea,” he explains. Less common issues include
  dysautonomia, the inability to regulate involuntary body functions such as
  heart rate and blood pressure, and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo,
  characterized by dizziness after your head changes positions, such as lying
  down or sitting up in bed. If you suspect any of these, Wasey says to talk
  with a doctor. Does the length of a nap matter? A short slumber is a safe bet.
  “We always encourage naps to be brief: 20 minutes or less,” says Wasey. “If a
  nap is more than 20 minutes, it can go into deep sleep. If they wake during
  deep sleep, they’re more likely to experience unpleasant symptoms upon
  waking.” If a quick lie-down doesn’t seem like enough, give yourself time to
  complete one full 90-minute sleep cycle. “I tell patients to either do a
  20-minute or a 90-minute nap,” he says. If GI issues are causing problems,
  keep the nap under half an hour, says Pothuri. The digestive system tends to
  slow down after 20 minutes of sleep, which means food stays in the stomach
  longer. Plus, less horizontal time means less time for stomach acid to
  irritate the esophagus. How can you prevent and treat post-nap nausea? Keep
  naps short, says Wasey – or skip them altogether. It helps to have a good
  night’s rest, he says: “Start a bedtime routine by winding down, reading a
  book or meditating, and limit blue light one to two hours before actual
  bedtime.” Afolabi-Brown says that if you take a nap, doing so earlier in the
  day can help ensure you don’t have trouble sleeping at night. Snoozing too
  long or too late in the day can reduce your sleep drive, the pressure to sleep
  that builds in our bodies the longer we’re awake. If you suspect GI issues,
  Shah recommends waiting until your food has digested before lying down –
  ideally three to four hours. If that’s not realistic, try to avoid spicy,
  acidic and fatty foods before napping. And when you lie down, prop yourself up
  with pillows or an adjustable mattress. “We want to work with gravity,” says
  Shah. “Keeping the head and chest elevated will mean less acid injury to the
  lower part of the esophagus.” Over-the-counter antacids can alleviate
  symptoms, but if discomfort persists, Shah recommends seeing a doctor.
  Prescription medications may provide more relief, or a physician may want to
  check for other issues in the esophagus, such as infection, ulcers or
  esophagitis. After speaking with the experts, I set aside a day to try their
  advice. I kept breakfast and lunch simple, swapping an acidic orange for toast
  and ignoring lasagne leftovers in favor of a light salad. When my son went
  down for a nap, I made a mini mountain of pillows to prop myself up and set an
  alarm for 20 minutes. When I woke up, I felt refreshed, rested and happy – no
  nausea or brain fog. I don’t always have the forethought to avoid triggering
  foods or arrange pillows. But thanks to these adjustments, I’ve discovered
  that there really is nothing like a good nap. Jillian Pretzel is a freelance
