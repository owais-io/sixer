  Several survivors of Jeffrey Epstein’s abuse signaled their support on
  Wednesday for a bipartisan resolution to release all the files related to the
  convicted sex offender, who died in a Manhattan prison in 2019. Speaking
  outside the US Capitol, Anouska De Georgiou, a survivor of both Epstein and
  his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, said that while “every day of this
  journey toward healing has come at a profound cost to my mental health”, she
  had chosen to be there because this legislation “really matters”. The only
  motive to oppose the bill would be to “conceal wrongdoing”, she added, but
  also issued a plea to Donald Trump to use his power and influence to help
  release the full tranche of records on Epstein. The section of the Capitol
  grounds, known as the House Triangle, was packed with reporters and
  demonstrators. Signs accusing the US president of “protecting pedophiles” were
  raised alongside placards demanding the administration “release the files”,
  and messages of support for survivors, reading “we believe you”. Many of those
  at the news conference told personal stories of how they were abused and
  trafficked. Annie Farmer, now 46, said she was only 16 when she was flown to
  New Mexico to spend a weekend with Epstein and Maxwell. “For so many years, it
  felt like Epstein’s criminal behavior was an open secret,” Farmer said. “Not
  only did many others participate in the abuse, it is clear that many were
  aware of his interest in girls and very young women and chose to look the
  other way because it benefited them to do so.” At the same press conference,
  the bill’s co-author, Republican representative Thomas Massie said that he is
  close to reaching the 218 signatures needed to bypass US House leadership and
  bring his bipartisan legislation, calling for the release of the Epstein
  files, to a floor vote. “Hopefully they can find their spines,” the Kentucky
  lawmaker said of the Republican holdouts. “I’m calling on my colleagues to be
  one of the next two who sponsors this discharge petition.” With all 212 house
  Democrats expected to sign on to the bipartisan effort, Massie would only need
  six house Republicans to sign to get it across the line. Four, including
  himself, have already done so. These include Maga firebrands such as
  representatives Lauren Boebert of Colorado, and Marjorie Taylor Greene of
  Georgia. “This is an issue that doesn’t have political boundaries. It’s an
  issue that Republicans and Democrats should never fight about,” Greene told
  reporters on Wednesday. “The truth needs to come out, and the government holds
  the truth. The cases that are sealed hold the truth. Jeffrey Epstein’s estate
  holds the truth.” Representative Nancy Mace has also signed the petition; the
  South Carolina Republican left a meeting with survivors of Epstein’s abuse in
  tears on Tuesday. “Full blown panic attack. Sweating. Hyperventilating.
  Shaking,” she wrote in a post on Twitter/X. “I feel the immense pain of how
  hard all victims are fighting for themselves because we know absolutely no one
  will fight for us.” Mace has been vocal about her own allegations of sexual
  abuse at the hands of multiple men, including her ex-fiance. Massie’s
  co-sponsor, Ro Khanna, a Democrat, also spoke Wednesday, and noted that any
  efforts to derail the bill would be misguided. “This is not against President
  Trump. I would like nothing more than a Truth Social post for him after this
  press conference saying ‘just release the files’,” he said. The pair’s
  proposed resolution, the Epstein files transparency act, demands that the
  government release all unclassified Epstein records in the possession of the
  justice department, including the FBI, US attorneys’ offices and other federal
  agencies. Personally identifiable information would remain redacted. Massie
  was undeterred by the House oversight committee releasing on Tuesday a
  redacted trove of more than 33,000 pages of records related to Epstein, as
  part of their ongoing investigation. Many Democratic lawmakers said that much
  of the material, which includes court filings, is already public, while Massie
  called it “woefully incomplete”. But the document drop could stymie the
  remaining buy-in Massie needs from his Republican colleagues. House speaker
  Mike Johnson has branded the bipartisan petition a “moot point” and
  “superfluous”, given the several subpoenas filed by the oversight committee in
  recent weeks. He also backed a resolution that would direct the committee to
  continue its investigation. Massie, for his part, was quick to dismiss this
  move today as achieving “absolutely nothing”. He expressed appreciation for
  the work of oversight chairperson James Comer, also a Republican
  representative from Kentucky, but said that the committee is allowing the
  justice department “to curate all of the information” that they’re providing.
  Meanwhile, the White House called the discharge petition “a very hostile act”
  that would undermine that work of the House oversight committee and the
  justice department’s compliance in the overall investigation. Trump also said
  on Wednesday that the call for more information about Epstein to be released
  is a “Democrat hoax that never ends”. When Congress returned from recess this
  week, Massie was quick to formally file what’s known as a “discharge petition”
  – a manoeuvre that allows legislation that has been sitting in committee for
  more than 30 days to be put to a vote if a majority of House members sign onto
  it. The bill would then enter a seven-day waiting period before it heads to
  the House floor. Even if the petition receives that support, and the bill
  passes the House, the legislation will still need to be approved by the
  Senate, where Republican majority leader John Thune has given no indication he
  will put it up for a vote. Should it pass the Senate, it faces another
  obstacle: the president. Trump’s condemnation of the Epstein file furor, as a
  distraction created by the Democrats, could result in him vetoing the
  legislation. That would punt the issue back to Congress, where the bill would
  need two-thirds majority support to overcome his veto.
