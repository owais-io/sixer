  ‘Just hysteria’: UK faces a crisis but the Denis Healey comparison is
  overblown

  International confidence in the UK government’s economic policies had
  evaporated. Growth was stalling, inflation was galloping, and Labour – back in
  power after a reckless Conservative administration had gambled on tax cuts –
  was in deep trouble. It was 1976, when James Callaghan’s government was forced
  to go cap in hand to the International Monetary Fund for an emergency loan.
  Fast forward almost half a century and some economists are drawing obvious
  parallels. Just as Callaghan’s chancellor, Denis Healey, did before her,
  Rachel Reeves is facing a challenge to placate jittery global investors. The
  UK’s long-term borrowing costs have risen close to their highest level since
  1998, adding to pressure on the chancellor before a tough autumn budget. With
  a lacklustre growth outlook, sticky inflation, and Labour’s welfare U-turns
  hitting the public finances, most economists expect Reeves to announce a raft
  of tax increases to cover a shortfall of between £20bn and £40bn against her
  main, self-imposed, fiscal target. Last weekend the Sunday Telegraph ran an
  article headlined: Britain heading towards IMF bailout, featuring quotes from
  three experienced economists comparing the fiscal mess facing the two Labour
  administrations 49 years apart. However, for most economists, comparisons with
  Healey’s begging-bowl plea to the global lender of last resort are
  significantly overblown. “You can quote me as saying that is complete
  nonsense… something like that is just hysteria,” said Michael Saunders, a
  former member of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee. “That is not
  to say the UK does not have a weak fiscal position. It does. But it is
  somewhere well between that and an IMF bailout.” Back in the autumn of 1976,
  inflation was running close to 17%, having hit a postwar high of almost 25% a
  year earlier; it forced the Bank to drive interest rates up to 15%. Sterling
  was in freefall and the UK government faced a buyers’ strike among investors
  who would normally purchase its bonds, known as gilts. This week the Treasury
  sold £5bn of three-year gilts to institutional investors in an auction that
  was more than three times oversubscribed. The pound has strengthened against
  other major currencies this year. Inflation is on track to peak at 4%, up from
  3.8% currently, economic growth in the first half of 2025 was the fastest in
  the G7, and Threadneedle Street cut interest rates this month by a
  quarter-point, to 4%. Benchmarking things to the 1970s, is, though, a mainstay
  of British political discourse. The IMF bailout episode became synonymous with
  national humiliation, and led to Labour’s 1979 defeat and long exile from
  government. Jagjit Chadha, a Cambridge university economist and former
  director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr),
  who was quoted by the Telegraph, said it could not be predicted whether an IMF
  loan was required. But he warned the UK’s “unsustainable path” should not be
  underplayed. “We need to address this risk not devalue it,” he said. At the
  Treasury, the most painful episode in postwar economic history remains burned
  into the institutional memory. Within weeks of Labour’s return to power last
  year, officials briefed ministers with a 25-minute PowerPoint presentation on
  the importance of keeping markets onside. Liz Truss triggering a meltdown in
  the market for UK government debt with her September 2022 mini-budget had been
  a potent reminder of the fragile conditions in markets, and underscored
  Britain’s delicate position. Baked into the rise in government borrowing costs
  are several ingredients. After a succession of shocks – from the 2008
  financial crisis, to Brexit and the Covid pandemic – the UK’s national debt
  has risen to the highest level as a share of GDP since the 1960s. The return
  of high inflation and the end of rock-bottom interest rates has made servicing
  those debts more expensive. An ageing population and political pressure to
  mend battered public services has added to the strain. The Bank has also
  complicated matters further. Although it is cutting rates, the central bank is
  also selling UK government bonds to unwind its crisis-era quantitative easing
  scheme, adding to the supply of debt investors are being called on to buy.
  Earlier this month, Threadneedle Street admitted for the first time that this
  had contributed to the rise in the UK’s long-term borrowing costs. At its next
  policy meeting on 18 September, the Bank will decide whether to reduce its
  sales over the next 12 months. Most economists believe a reduction is likely.
  Britain is not alone in facing challenges. Borrowing costs have risen across
  advanced economies, in part because of Donald Trump’s trade wars and his
  assault on the independence of the US Federal Reserve. Several other countries
  are seen as running unsustainable fiscal policies, including France, where
  Emmanuel Macron’s government is in crisis. Chris Scicluna, a former Treasury
  economist who is now head of research at the Japanese bank Daiwa Capital
  Markets Europe, said the UK was more reliant on overseas investors to buy its
  debt than some other countries were. “Debt stocks are much higher than they
  used to be. Therefore governments need to be offering higher yields to attract
  buyers, and there’s no shortage – whether from the US, euro area or Japan –
  and unfortunately the UK has to compete to attract investors.” Many investors
  believe that Reeves has made a rod for her own back. Labour promising before
  the general election not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT has
  left big revenue-raisers off limits. Labour’s welfare U-turns show that
  further spending restraint is not an option. Neil Mehta, a hedge fund manager
  at RBC BlueBay Asset Management, said: “The government can’t contain spending
  or tax effectively without breaking manifesto rules. No one wants to make the
  tough political choices. If we continue like this the market will act as the
  enforcer, like it has done many times in the past.” The trouble for Reeves is
  that raising taxes to balance the books could undermine economic growth. Her
  previous measures also stoked inflation. That in turn would be viewed
  negatively in financial markets, in what some economists refer to as an
  effective doom loop. Andrew Sentance, a former MPC member, said that
  comparisons to the 1970s were valid, but that suggesting an impending IMF
  bailout was hyperbole. “I do not think in the UK’s case we are heading for an
  IMF bailout,” he told the Guardian. “You have a cocktail of problems which is
  very reminiscent of the 1970s. Does that mean we have to go to the IMF? No,
  not necessarily. Does it mean there is some kind of reckoning in terms of an
  economic crisis coming up, of some sort? Yes, that’s quite likely.”
