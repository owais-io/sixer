  Melbourne Symphony Orchestra/ Martín review – soloist and players gather
  strength after protesters disrupt Prom

  The fallout continues for the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. A year ago, its
  management cancelled a concert by the pianist Jayson Gillham because of
  comments he made from the stage condemning the targeting of journalists in
  Gaza. Despite changes in management, Gillham’s case is still set to go to
  court – and the MSO remains a target for protest. This was the second ever
  Prom for the MSO, and twice it was brought to a halt by shouts from the
  balcony, where the Jewish Artists for Palestine group unfurled banners. The
  first time, the conductor Jaime Martín went off stage, then returned and
  started from the top; the second, he immediately resumed where they had left
  off. If anything it felt a little unfair that the piece disrupted should have
  been by Haunted Hills by the Australian composer Margaret Sutherland. With
  loping, almost balletic melodies dragging the ominous weight of tuba and other
  brass, this muscular 1950 tone poem evokes both the unchanging landscape and
  what Sutherland called the betrayal of Indigenous people by settlers. Her
  music still awaits an undisrupted Proms premiere. Next, in theory, was
  Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto No 1, with Khatia Buniatishvili as soloist. The
  stage was rearranged, the piano wheeled out – and, a few minutes later,
  wheeled back again. Buniatishvili was understandably rattled, and so Dvořák’s
  Symphony No 6 would be played first. It’s a buoyant symphony and, as the
  performance unfolded unchallenged, it sounded all the more so. Yet while there
  were some lovely touches – the glassy violins and perky flutes as the first
  movement turned back towards the light; the rustic piccolo singing out in
  relief to the almost aggressive main dance theme of the third movement – the
  balance still felt weighted towards the brass, with the strings silky yet a
  little reticent. Buniatishvili finally took the stage after the interval, and
  with Martín in attentive support she gave a performance of almost relentless
  drive, bringing out the skittishness and spikiness behind this work’s
  grandeur. Her encore was JS Bach’s version of an adagio for oboe by Marcello,
  its melody highly decorated but introverted, played almost as if she were
  alone. A long silence followed: the end of a highly charged evening. • Listen
  again on BBC Sounds until 12 October. The Proms continue until 13 September.
  This Prom will be broadcast in Australia on ABC Classic on 14 September at
  1pm.
