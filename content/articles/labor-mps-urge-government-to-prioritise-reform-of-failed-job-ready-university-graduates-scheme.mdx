  Labor MPs are increasing pressure on the government to speed up reform of the
  controversial Morrison-era job-ready graduates scheme that has “failed”
  students. The Albanese government has flagged its intention to reform the JRG
  scheme but MPs have told Guardian Australia it should be a priority early in
  Labor’s second term. Louise Miller-Frost, a South Australian Labor MP, said
  the scheme, which has been widely condemned for hiking the cost of humanities
  and social science degrees, has angered voters. “It is something that gets
  raised quite often, particularly when I’m talking to students about the 20%
  off Hecs which is very popular and people love it, but this is the next step,”
  she said. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “It is a priority to make sure that
  we have the best possible access for university … I do see it as an
  intergenerational equity [issue].” The matter has also been raised with the
  Victorian MP Carina Garland, who studied humanities and has worked as an
  academic. She said reforms were needed as soon as possible. “I would hate to
  see the scheme becoming too entrenched,” Garland said. “It’s really clear from
  my community that they want the government to act on the current job-ready
  graduates scheme, and it should happen sooner rather than later. “The
  [universities] accord was pretty clear in its assessment and the minister has
  said we will move progressively to implement the recommendations. I’ve
  advocated for change [directly] to the minister’s office and will continue to
  do so.” The scheme, introduced in 2021, changed the fee structure for
  university courses to increase costs for subjects including arts and law, and
  lowered course fees for degrees in Stem areas. The scheme also introduced a
  rule to remove Hecs debt eligibility for students who failed more than 50% of
  their units. Labor commissioned the universities accord to outline a reform
  path across the entire sector, which made several key findings on the JRG
  scheme. In July 2023 the accord released its interim report, which found the
  fee structure needed to be “redesigned before it causes long-term damage to
  Australian higher education by increasing the cost of gaining a
  qualification”, and recommended the 50% pass rule should be scrapped. Labor
  immediately abolished the 50% pass rule, and later established the Australian
  Tertiary Education Commission (Atec) to make recommendations on changing the
  fee structure under the scheme. The education minister, Jason Clare, has
  provided no timeline on when Atec, which has been in place since 1 July, will
  make its recommendations. Clare said the accord had “made a number of
  recommendations and called out the previous government’s job-ready graduates
  program as a failure”. “We’ve bitten off a big chunk of its recommendations
  already – 31 of 47 in full or in part. This includes changes to make the
  repayment system for Hecs fairer, which we passed through parliament last
  week,” he said. “There’s more work to do and we’ll take it one step at a
  time.” The Labor MP Sally Sitou railed against the “failed” rules in
  parliament last week. Sitou told Guardian Australia the previous Morrison
  government “actively undermined and underfunded the university sector” and
  said reform was “complex” and would take time. “[The Coalition government]
  introduced the job-ready graduate scheme which the universities accord said
  [has] failed, and it made recommendations about how to address this,” she
  said, adding that Atec would “help to steer reform across the sector,
  including advice on the setting of course fees”. Sitou said Labor had made
  significant progress on reform and she wanted a rethink of the rules. The
  parliament’s youngest senator, Labor’s 21-year-old Charlotte Walker, said
  “stigma” around arts degrees, exacerbated by the JRG program, had to end.
  “There’s a stigma around, ‘Oh, why would you want to do that? You’re not
  actually going to be able to get a job.’ I do genuinely think that sort of
  stigma turns students away from studying things,” Walker said. “I really hope
  we can start moving past that.”
