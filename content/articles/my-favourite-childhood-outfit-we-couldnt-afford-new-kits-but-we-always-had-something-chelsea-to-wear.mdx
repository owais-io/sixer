  My favourite childhood outfit: ‘We couldn’t afford new kits – but we always
  had something Chelsea to wear’

  My dad made sure my two younger brothers and I were raised in a Chelsea
  household; the shed at the back of the garden was, we were told, where Arsenal
  supporters belonged. Growing up, we went to all the games at Stamford Bridge,
  competed in our local little league as though it were the Premier League, and
  followed Dad to the pub to watch Sunday matches (the cheeky chips and J2Os
  were at least half of the allure). I’m pretty sure I’m 12 years old in this
  photo and closing in on the peak of my sporting career, as I got ready to play
  football at a nearby park with my siblings Jevan (then nine) and Kiran (just
  four). Although we didn’t always have the money for the expensive new kits
  every season (I’m sure you can spot my mismatched camo shorts), we always had
  something Chelsea to wear. My dad would often dodge the high ticket prices by
  taking us to watch the women’s team play, as well as the under-21s, where you
  would witness great talent at a fraction of the cost. One of my most memorable
  football moments was the extraordinary 6-0 Chelsea victory against Arsenal in
  2014, which I got to enjoy alongside our extended family from the local area.
  In south-west London, particularly my area of Worcester Park, there has always
  been a strong Chelsea tradition as a result of the movement of working-class
  households out to the suburbs in response to overcrowding in inner-city areas
  like Kensington. This gave the area a strong football culture, which my family
  was more than happy to be a part of. Now, as a new generation is priced out of
  the suburbs, that community risks being broken up and dispersed across the
  country, where I’m sure it will find new places to call home. Even though
  we’ve all grown up a bit since (it’s certainly been a few years since I’ve
  been to Stamford Bridge or donned a Chelsea shirt), I’ll always look back
  fondly on the childhood memories, even as our old kit finds its way from the
  back of my cupboard to a high street charity shop. Today, Dad still goes every
  Saturday to coach the little league team I joined almost a decade ago, where
  my youngest brother, Kiran, has taken my place. Even after a torn ligament
  left him with limited capacity for the sport, my father is still as committed
  to his club as ever. My hope is that one day I can give my future children
  their own memories to cherish, as he has done for me.
