  She can barely see me – young Honey’s golden fringe falls well past her eyes.
  But the 11-month-old Highland calf trusts me, allowing me to nestle in close
  to brush her long, shaggy coat up along her neck. She tilts her head towards
  the sky, her wet pale pink nose catching the sun – she loves it. And for a
  moment, nothing else matters. I’m at Wildhand Farm, a 10 hectare property in
  Willunga Hill, South Australia. Little more than 12 months ago, budding
  farmers Alice Cearns, 29, and Reece Merritt, 37, were “going broke”. Their
  income from growing and selling native Australian flora and proteas was not
  enough to support their growing family. They began hosting flower-arranging
  workshops for the public but, in a twist of fate, their two Highland cows
  stole the show. “The excitement was crazy,” says Cearns. “People wanted to
  spend more time with the cows than the flowers. “We realised: we have to get
  more cows.” The pair, who live on the farm with their two children, both under
  three, have seen more than 2,000 people through their property since launching
  private and small group Highland cattle experiences in October 2024. Dates now
  book out months in advance. “That first woman from the flower workshop who
  asked to see the cows, she just started crying when she got up close with
  them,” Cearns says. “We’ve had an 82nd birthday here, and she could barely
  walk, but she was just so over the moon to be out there. Sign up for the fun
  stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend,
  every Saturday morning “We realised it’s a very therapeutic process to be out
  there with them, brushing them, bonding with them. We had a woman who worked
  for the NDIS say how much it would help those with disabilities improve their
  mental health.” Cow cuddling isn’t new: in recent years, farmers in Australia,
  the UK and the US have been inviting people to hug their herds as a supersized
  form of animal therapy. But these aren’t ordinary cows. Scottish Highland
  cattle – recognised for their shaggy coats and long, curved horns – aren’t
  farmed for meat in Australia, living to an average age of 23. There are a
  handful of other farmers and business owners who run Highland cow encounters
  in Australia, including The Farm at nearby Clarendon. The animal-loving pair
  were drawn to Highlands for grazing because the breed isn’t used for milk or
  meat – though the cows’ endearing faces helped, too. “I wanted a cow breed
  that you didn’t have to kill,” Cearns says. Merritt’s feelings on this also
  run deep. Raised on his family’s sheep farm in Mount Compass, he says he
  “never liked the killing”. Highlands, the pair say, are more like giant pets.
  Their charismatic herd now numbers nine, each “with their own personalities”:
  Mabel, Millie, Matilda, Ruby, Mia, Max, Menzi and Banks, aged between seven
  months and four-and-a-half years. At the start of the tour, the females come
  galumphing out – some faster than others (easy does it for the old girls).
  Merritt throws out a fresh batch of hay, giving them a chance to settle before
  we approach. Their presence feels big, not only in size but in an intangible,
  humbling energy that surrounds us as we slowly build confidence in patting,
  brushing and even cuddling the warm-bodied beauties. Smiles and laughter
  ripple through the group – and the cows bask in the attention. First-time
  participant Georgia Standing, 22, says pampering the cows made her feel “warm
  and fuzzy”. “They’re so cute,” she says. “It’s satisfying getting their knots
  out, too.” Brushing their coats feels grounding, wholesome. The surrounding
  gums, the fresh air and free-roaming chickens add to the tranquillity, as do
  the many rows of blooming flowers. The cows are a time waster, Merritt jokes.
  “In the evening, I’ll come out here and the cows are just laying, and I’ll lay
  with them,” he says. “You can’t hear any cars. It’s just peaceful.”
