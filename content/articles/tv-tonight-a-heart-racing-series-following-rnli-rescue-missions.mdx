  Saving Lives at Sea 8pm, BBC Two Storm Eunice is about to hit the south coast
  – not the best day for a windsurfer to be caught out there, especially as he
  needs diabetes medication. But the Portsmouth rescue team aren’t even sure
  whether they can get to him. Will they make it there in time? More tense
  scenes in this heart-racing series that highlights the great work of the RNLI.
  Hollie Richardson Supercruising: Life at Sea 8pm, Channel 4 It’s the
  penultimate episode in this not-at-all riveting series about life at sea on
  cruise ships. There’s excitement as some of the higher-up staff take a break
  on a private beach in the Bahamas (not so exciting for everyone else – or us
  at home), while back on board the MS Nieuw Statendam, the chefs give
  passengers a cooking lesson. HR Tom Kerridge Cooks Spain 8.30pm, ITV1 The
  popular chef drives through Cuenca, a mountain town in north-eastern Spain,
  then Murcia, a university city in the south-east, in this week’s foodie tour.
  In Cuenca, he gets on a tractor and farms intense garlic. Over in Murcia, he
  investigates the story behind the area’s reputation as “the fruit basket of
  Spain”. HR The Gone 9pm, BBC Two We’re nearing the end of this patient New
  Zealand-set thriller and a look at Mervin’s farm suggests a man with an
  unhealthy interest in the business of serial killing. Elsewhere, Aileen
  (Carolyn Bracken) has a spiritual awakening and reconciles with Richter
  (Richard Flood) as a result. But with a prison break imminent, it seems any
  happy endings will be hard won. Phil Harrison Ben Fogle: New Lives in the Wild
  9pm, Channel 5 In a new exploration series, Ben Fogle heads to Africa where he
  meets the Norwegian model Aleks, who has made a home in the deserts of
  Botswana. He helps her to build bush fences to keep out wild lions and meets
  her local community, while finding out how she ended up moving there. HR The
  Walking Dead: Dead City 10pm, Sky Max Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) may be the
  last gang leader standing in the ruins of New York, but his young ward is in a
  bad way. A mercy dash to Bellevue hospital for medical supplies is required.
  Meanwhile, Maggie (Lauren Cohan) considers whether to enter into a risky
  alliance to track down her erratic son Hershel, last spotted trying to poison
  the water supply. Graeme Virtue Film choice Grand Hotel (Edmund Goulding,
  1932), 7pm, BBC Four “I want to be alone!” Greta Garbo is at her most diva-ish
  in this 1932 Oscar winner, a seductive pre-Code melodrama set exclusively in
  an opulent Berlin hotel. She is a depressed ballerina given a new lease of
  life after falling for John Barrymore’s Baron Felix von Geigern. Sadly, he has
  plans to steal her jewels to pay off his debts – but he’s also in love with
  her so it’s not a simple proposition. Lionel Barrymore’s terminally ill
  bookkeeper, a young Joan Crawford as a flirtatious stenographer, and Wallace
  Beery’s bumptious factory owner are other guests adding to the social whirl.
