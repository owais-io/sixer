  I recently tried to renew the tax on my van, but the DVLA told me that the
  vehicle had been registered as scrapped. This was news to me. The DVLA
  insisted I take it up with my insurer, which confirmed that the vehicle is
  still insured and roadworthy. I was required to send the DVLA evidence of this
  and was told that the investigation would take at least six weeks, during
  which time the van could not be driven. I live in a rural area and am reliant
  on it. I’ve since received a further letter from the DVLA naming the insurance
  company that wrote it off, and telling me to contact them. So basically, a
  random company has incorrectly, or possibly fraudulently, passed on my
  details, leaving me stranded, and the DVLA won’t help. MD, Aberdeenshire Not
  only did the DVLA decline to help you, it got the name of the notifying
  insurer wrong. Service Claims was the culprit it named despite the fact that
  no such company apparently exists. You eventually discovered that your van had
  been written off by a claims handling company in the north of England. It told
  you it had confused your van with a vehicle with a similar registration plate.
  (I contacted the company for a comment, but it did not respond.) What unnerves
  you, and me, is that the DVLA will happily write off a vehicle on the say-so
  of an insurer without alerting the registered keeper. Even more troubling, the
  van was recorded as salvage in January 2024, since when it has been
  successfully taxed once and passed two MOTs – a fact recorded on the website
  of the DVLA’s sister authority, the DVSA. The DVLA told me that it is reliant
  on information being provided correctly by insurers, and that if a mistake is
  made, the notifying insurer is welcome to let them know. It declined to
  comment on your case but its system is now showing your van as hale and
  hearty, and you are legally back on the road. We welcome letters but cannot
  answer individually. Email us at consumer.champions@theguardian.com or write
