  Congress returned to session on Tuesday, and with it comes a political
  headache for Donald Trump in the form of renewed attention on the
  investigation into the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein and his death, a
  subject that the president has sought to avoid in recent weeks. While the
  president got a month-long break from the Epstein issue when lawmakers left
  town for the annual August recess – with the House of Representatives wrapping
  up a day early because of the controversy over Epstein – the calm will
  probably end quickly. Representatives from both parties have planned press
  conferences and legislative maneuvers intended to put pressure on the Trump
  administration for more transparency over Epstein, whose suicide while
  awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in 2019 has been the subject of
  conspiracy theories the president amplified while on the campaign trail. The
  Republican congressman Thomas Massie announced he had filed a legislative
  maneuver known as a discharge petition that could force a vote in the House on
  legislation mandating the release of investigative files related to Epstein,
  over the objections of the speaker, Mike Johnson. The petition needs 218
  signatures to succeed and is expected to attract support from most, if not
  all, Democrats as well as some Republicans, but it is unclear if it will
  prevail. However, even if the bill passes, it still must be approved by the
  Senate, and it is unclear if the majority leader, John Thune, will allow it to
  be considered. Meanwhile, victims of Epstein are on Capitol Hill to meet with
  Johnson, a source familiar with the speaker’s schedule told the Guardian. They
  will also sit down with lawmakers on the House oversight committee, which is
  investigating the government’s handling of the financier’s case. The
  Democratic congresswoman and oversight committee member, Ayanna Pressley, said
  the encounter “is a step toward the healing, accountability, and transparency
  survivors deserve”. “As the oversight committee continues its investigation, I
  continue to demand the release of the full, unredacted Epstein files with the
  names of survivors protected,” she added. On Wednesday, Massie and the
  Democratic congressman Ro Khanna will hold a press conference with the victims
  to make the case that investigative files pertaining to Epstein should be made
  public. “I pray [Johnson]will listen to the pleas of these victims for justice
  and quit trying to block a vote on our legislation to release the Epstein
  files,” Massie, who has broken with Trump on several high-profile issues since
  his second term began, wrote on X. Trump campaigned on getting to the bottom
  of conspiracy theories that have swirled around Epstein since his death, but
  sparked the fury of some of his supporters after the justice department
  announced in July that it had determined the financier died by suicide and
  that the long-rumored list of his clients does not exist. The department also
  said it would release no further details about the case, sparking a clamor
  among lawmakers who argued the investigative files pertaining to Epstein
  should be made public. The White House has since been looking for ways to
  assuage the demands for transparency, including by pushing for the release of
  grand jury transcripts related to Epstein’s indictment, and sending the deputy
  attorney general, Todd Blanche, to Florida to spend two days interviewing his
  jailed accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell. But those meetings produced little new
  information, while a judge has refused to make the grand jury proceedings
  public. Democrats view the issue as a rare one with the ability to drive a
  wedge between the president and his supporters, while Trump has decried it as
  a distraction. “The whole thing is a hoax. It’s put out by the Democrats
  because we’ve had the most successful six months in the history of our country
  and that’s just a way of trying to divert attention to something that’s total
  bullshit,” he said in August. Johnson, a persistent defender of the president
  and his policies, has struggled to find ways to quell the concerns of
  Republican lawmakers that fear opposing the release of the files will put them
  on the wrong side of their constituents. On Tuesday, Republican leaders
  proposed a resolution that directs the House oversight committee “to continue
  its ongoing investigation” into the Epstein matter. Massie blasted it as a
  “meaningless vote to provide political cover for those members who don’t
  support our bipartisan legislation to force the release of the Epstein files”.
  Led by its Republican chair and Trump ally, James Comer, the oversight
  committee has sent a slew of subpoenas to former top government officials who
  may have knowledge of how previous administrations, including Trump’s first
  term, handled the allegations against the financier. Among those who received
  summons were the former secretary of state Hillary Clinton as well as Bill
  Clinton, who associated with Epstein in the past. The committee has also
  demanded documents from the justice department and Epstein’s estate, and on
  Sunday asked the treasury for suspicious activity reports related to Epstein.
  “The House oversight committee is conducting a thorough review of the federal
  investigation into the crimes committed by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine
  Maxwell. We are committed to providing full transparency to the American
  people,” Comer said in a statement after the resolution was announced.
