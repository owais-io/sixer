  “The good thing about getting older is that you stop giving a stuff what other
  people think about you,” Marina Prior says as we set off on a cold winter’s
  walk through parkland in the outer-Melbourne suburb of Eltham. “While I care
  deeply about the work, I don’t care if you don’t like it.” Despite decades in
  the public eye – first as the star of blockbuster musicals of the 80s and 90s
  including Les Misérables and Phantom of the Opera and then as an annual
  yuletide favourite on Carols by Candlelight – Prior remains a curiously
  contradictory figure, both open book and shut case. “I’m not really a dramatic
  person,” she says as she tightens her navy puffer jacket against the biting
  wind. “I don’t get stressed or suffer from anxiety.” At 61, Prior has reason
  to be relaxed. She recently wrapped up the Australian leg of the Les
  Misérables Arena Spectacular tour, playing one of the show’s comic villains
  opposite Little Britain’s Matt Lucas. She’s currently starring in the Tony
  award-winning musical Kimberly Akimbo, playing the show’s eponymous hero. And
  there is almost zero chance we won’t be seeing her round out our Christmas
  Eves on this year’s Carols. “Wild horses wouldn’t drag me away.” The evolution
  from colourless ingenue to rich character actor can be tracked through the
  roles Prior has played in Les Mis alone – originally cast as young lover
  Cosette, she transitioned to the tragic part of Fantine and now plays the
  grotesque comic foil of Madame Thénardier. It’s tempting to see this as a
  natural progression, but Prior maintains that “I had to fight for it.” “It’s
  very hard to avoid getting pigeonholed in this country,” she says, her
  laughter hiding the slightest hint of exasperation. “People see you as
  something, and it’s really difficult to get them to change their mind about
  you.” She stops to consider which path we should take, up towards the noisy
  main road or under a nearby footbridge. “I’d never dismiss those ingenue
  roles,” Prior says once we’re walking again, away from traffic and towards an
  oval full of galahs. “People think they’re shallow, but there’s a lot of skill
  involved in playing those parts well. The problem is people think that’s who
  you are in real life. It’s funny. People see me on Carols and think that’s me,
  but I want to explain that that’s also a persona. I’m acting!” Shifting public
  perceptions might be an ongoing battle, but there is no doubt Prior has the
  runs on the board. She has proven comic credentials – she was hilarious in
  Melbourne Theatre Company’s production of The 25th Annual Putnam County
  Spelling Bee and a delightfully droll Dolly Levi in the Production Company’s
  Hello, Dolly! – and is attracted to roles that stretch her as an actor and
  singer. “I credit [former MTC artistic director] Roger Hodgman for taking a
  chance on me,” Prior explains. “He was directing a production of Guys and
  Dolls, and approached me for the role of Sarah Brown, the ingenue part.” Prior
  had other ideas, and insisted on auditioning for the comic role of Miss
  Adelaide. She was sensational and has since played the part twice. Born in
  Port Moresby to parents who loved the arts (they joined the local Gilbert
  &amp; Sullivan Society there, and “were thrilled” when their daughter made her
  professional debut as Mabel in The Pirates of Penzance), Prior graduated from
  Korowa girls’ school without quite knowing what career she’d pursue. “I was
  going to do law, but my dad talked me out of it.” Prior says. “He asked me
  what I loved, and I said music and acting. He said, ‘Well do that.’ I’m very
  grateful to him for not being sensible. He was living his unfulfilled dreams
  through me, quite honestly.” Thoughts of teenage life are at the forefront of
  Prior’s mind at the moment, a natural byproduct of her work on Kimberly
  Akimbo. She plays a 16-year old girl who ages four times faster than everyone
  else around her, mature beyond her years but desperate to seize the little
  time she has left. “It’s the most wonderful show,” Prior enthuses. “It has
  these confronting themes, but then it’s so uplifting.” While mortality itself
  haunts the edges of the musical, it also deals with appearances, with the
  disconnect between how we feel and how we look. It’s the teenage experience
  writ large. “There’s a lot of hilarity to be mined in teenage angst and
  insecurity,” Prior says. “And I’m not really any different on the inside than
  I was at 16. Unlike Kimberley, I have life experience. I’ve buried people,
  I’ve given birth to people. I’ve been married, I’ve been divorced and
  remarried. But fundamentally, I’m the same person.” Prior moved out to Eltham
  with her husband, fellow actor Grant Piro, “because I wanted a different
  lifestyle. I have kangaroos at my back fence. There’s something about the
  inner city that’s so hip and aspirational, and I just didn’t want to play that
  game. We’ve lived in lots of places, and they were fine for a time, but we’ve
  found our place now.” Prior and Piro manage to carve out time for each other
  despite gruelling and often conflicting schedules. “For instance, Grant’s
  about to move into the theatre I’ve just bumped out of [Her Majesty’s in
  Adelaide]. We’ve only got a few days crossover.” Piro walks ahead of us with
  their dog India, a silent sentinel guiding our way, stopping every now and
  again to point out the local birdlife. If there’s a downside to the actor’s
  life, with its peripatetic demands and insecure working schedule, Prior
  doesn’t share it. As we round a final turn and the weather threatens to
  blacken, she seems both poised and content, completely in control. “When I was
  younger, I used to tie myself in knots, worrying what people thought of me. I
  don’t do that any more. I love my age. I’m vibrant, I’m doing more exciting
  things than I’ve ever done.” • Kimberly Akimbo is playing at the Arts Centre
  Melbourne until 30 August.
