  Jamaicans head to the polls on Wednesday for a closely fought general election
  which has been overshadowed by an investigation into potential corruption in
  the ruling Jamaica Labour party (JLP) which is seeking a third term in office.
  The latest local poll put the opposition People’s National party (PNP) 3.1%
  lead over the JLP, but political analyst Damion Gordon cautioned that the lead
  was barely larger than the margin of error. “It is going to be a very close
  election,” he said. While the JLP is leaning on their track record of reducing
  crime and debt and growing the economy, the PNP has pitched itself as a party
  that will restore trust in leadership to rid the country of corruption and
  focus on critical public services such as infrastructure, water supply and
  hospital facilities. The government has won praise in areas such as education
  and the economy, but it has also come under criticism for failing to improve
  infrastructure and access to running water in some parts of the country. In
  the closing weeks of the campaign, however, the opposition put the spotlight
  on concerns over alleged corruption involving the prime minister, Andrew
  Holness. Last year, the country’s anti-corruption body, the Integrity
  Commission, issued a report raising concerns about Holness’s income and assets
  declarations and recommended further investigation by the Financial
  Investigations Division, a specialized unit within the Ministry of Finance.
  The prime minister has denied any wrongdoing, gaining permission from the
  supreme court to challenge the report, which he branded unlawful and unfair.
  “It’s a distraction for the government because the government has built its
  election campaign on the idea that it has delivered for Jamaicans in an
  unprecedented way,” Gordon said. The World Bank has praised Jamaica for making
  “significant strides” in reducing public debt, from more than 140% of GDP in
  2013 to 73.4% in the financial year 2023-2024, and its economy is expected to
  grow by 1.7% this year. There has also been a drastic reduction in crime under
  the JLP, with official figures showing a 40% drop in murders in May, compared
  to the same period last year. But during a recent debate between Holness and
  the opposition leader, Mark Golding, the prime minister was forced to focus on
  defending himself against allegations rather than just defending his
  achievements in office. He said: “I have been investigated, for a year, with
  an expert forensic auditor. The findings of that report have suggested no
  corruption. There have been no charges. Every aspect of my report, every
  aspect of my personal life and my personal financial details are in the public
  domain.” Golding told the Guardian that the investigation into the prime
  minister was a valid concern for voters. He said: “Other issues are often on
  the top of people’s minds, especially the cost of living and crime and
  violence and so on. But I think the consciousness of the nation has been
  sufficiently stirred around this issue that it is going to be an issue that
  will impact the outcome of the election.” He added: “We don’t see how a
  country like Jamaica can do with a prime minister who has that cloud hanging
  over him.” Golding, who previously held dual Jamaican and British citizenship,
  himself came under pressure during the campaign over concerns over his
  “Jamaican-ness”. “I am born in Jamaica. I grew up here, I’ve only ever worked
  here … And the fact that my father was British meant that I did inherit
  citizenship by descent. So I was a dual national, which is allowed by our
  constitution as long as the other nationality is a Commonwealth nationality,
  which obviously Britain is part of the commonwealth.” Golding said he decided
  to give up his British citizenship after polls indicated that voters didn’t
  think a leader should have dual citizenship. He has allowed a journalist to
  examine his citizenship renunciation documents and displayed his birth
  certificate to voters. For many voters, however, the main concern is the
  economic progress Jamaica has seen in recent years. “I’ve seen growth,” said
  business owner, Shana Kay Henry, 30. “JLP is for everybody, poor and rich.”
  One PNP supporter, an accountant who did not want to give her name, said that
  people in her constituency were not being listened to and their needs were not
  being addressed. She said: “We need somebody who will represent us. They need
  to hear our voices … do what needs to be done.” The outcome of the election
  will come down to how parties mobilise their bases, Gordon said. With the
  JLP’s strong performance in key areas during their tenure and with Golding
  offering a credible alternative, it is too close to call. “Both political
  parties appear very confident, but I am of the view the election will be won
  on the day,” he said.
