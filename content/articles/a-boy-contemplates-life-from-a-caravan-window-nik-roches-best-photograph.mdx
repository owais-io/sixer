  Having designed and built gardens all my life, I bought my first camera when I
  was 47. Photography gave me an opportunity to have conversations about myself
  through questioning others. I don’t just take some snaps and then go, I fully
  immerse myself in the lives of the friends I make. Who am I to speak on
  anybody’s behalf if I haven’t experienced what they have, myself? I photograph
  where I live, in south Wales, because I know it better than anywhere else, but
  in this case I wanted to document a community I lived near but wasn’t part of.
  The body of work this picture is part of came about as a result of working
  with people who have been in and out of prison and become trapped in a cycle
  of incarceration, freedom then back to incarceration. I was wondering what
  draws them back to the place where they committed all their crimes. I found a
  kind of tour guide who’d been released from prison after many, many years,
  though he’s since gone back inside. He became my friend. He took me around the
  estate where he lived. During that process, I met a guy who’d just “acquired”
  a plot of land – I’m using the word loosely. He had chickens, horses and
  ducks, and he’d just bought some young doves. He told me the most beautiful
  story, which became a big part of the thought process behind my work. He said
  that at first he’d put the doves’ food on the floor of the cage, so they’d
  start to learn about love and family. After a week or two, he put the cage up
  on top of the horses’ stable, from where the doves would be able to see the
  clock tower on the school opposite, and he’d feed them up there. Finally, he
  opened the cage door and they were free. But they’d always fly back to that
  cage, after homing in on the clock tower – after a few weeks, he’d release
  them 500 miles away and they’d still find their way back, he said. They had
  the freedom to fly anywhere, but this was home. They’d go back into their
  cage, and the owner would lock them in. As it happens, the day I was on this
  guy’s plot there were kids playing all around. One kid had gone into a
  caravan, and he looked out at me and in that moment, I made this image. As
  viewers, we do the rest of the work in our heads – it’s our projection. Does
  he look reflective? Does he look sad? Actually, he was having loads of fun. In
  essence, my work is about home, family and relationships. It is all made with
  people who are friends with each other. I’ll go months without even making an
  image at all, but my camera is always present. I edit the work into chapters
  and include text from the conversations I’ve recorded. This first chapter was
  called The Budgie Died Instantly, and was about the wider community. For the
  second chapter, It’s Hard to Report a Stolen Bike Stolen, the focus narrowed
  in on a particular group of friends, including a man called Tony who I’d
  approached after seeing him swearing and ranting in the street. We became dear
  friends, and the third chapter, As Far As They’re Concerned We Are a Normal
  Family, was all about Tony. Tony had a townhouse but chose to live in a big
  bell tent in the garden. He was desperate to find his tribe. Sadly, he took
  his own life in 2022, and I haven’t really made any pictures since. He never
  got to find out that I’d moved into a caravan myself as part of the process
  between us – I’ve lived that way for four years now. On reflection, I think
  Caravan Kid is looking out of the window and seeing the world at his feet.
  Kids are setting up their hierarchy at that age, they’re fighting for their
  place in the pecking order. There’s always a pecking order in both kids and
  adults, in the workplace and beyond. It’s that fight not to be the bottom dog.
