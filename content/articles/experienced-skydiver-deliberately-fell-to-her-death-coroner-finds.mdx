  An experienced skydiver deliberately fell to her death in April after ending
  her relationship with her partner the night before, an inquest has heard. Jade
  Damarell, 32, died of blunt trauma injuries after falling from 15,500ft (4,600
  metres) into a field in Shotton Colliery, County Durham, on 27 April. At an
  inquest at Crook civic centre in County Durham on Thursday, the coroner Leslie
  Hamilton gave a conclusion of suicide, finding that Damarell had intended to
  take her own life. Hamilton summarised a note from her former partner, whom
  she had met through their shared love for skydiving, which read that “they had
  ended their relationship the night before”. The inquest heard that Damarell,
  an experienced skydiver from Caerphilly in Wales had completed more than 500
  jumps, including six on the day before her death. On her final jump, however,
  the inquest was told that Damarell had deliberately not deployed her main
  parachute, which is usually opened at about 5,000ft. She had also turned off a
  device designed to automatically deploy a parachute at a certain speed or
  altitude should a skydiver be unable to do so. The parachute and device were
  found to be in full working order. The inquest heard that Damarell normally
  wore a camera to capture her dives, but was not wearing one on the day she
  died. Hamilton concluded that Damarell, a “very experienced” skydiver, had
  intended to end her own life. The inquest heard that DI Andrew Stephenson of
  Durham police, who attended the scene, found that Damarell had left
  instructions on her phone’s lock screen about how to access it after her
  death. His report said that notes addressed to her family were found on the
  handset, which included her “apologising and thanking them for their support”,
  as well as details of her finances. Speaking after the inquest, Damarell’s
  family accepted the coroner’s findings and thanked the skydiving community for
  its support, saying they were “incredibly comforted by how admired, respected
  and deeply loved she was”. Describing her as “brilliant, beautiful, brave and
  truly extraordinary”, they said they wanted to speak “openly and without
  shame” about her death to “contribute to a culture where mental ill-health is
  met with kindness and support, and where people in deep distress, and those
  around them, feel seen, believed and able to reach for support without fear of
  judgment”. • In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone
