  The public has been warned to keep away from an injured dolphin that was
  filmed dancing and playing with swimmers off the coast of Dorset earlier this
  month. The Marine Management Organisation (MMO), a government-backed agency
  responsible for England’s seas, said it was “increasingly concerned about a
  lone dolphin spotted in Lyme Bay, Dorset, following multiple potential marine
  wildlife disturbance offences observed online and shared on social media”. The
  post showed an image of a bottlenose dolphin, who has been nicknamed Reggie,
  that appeared to have a gash on the right side of its torso beneath its dorsal
  fin, which it said was not part of a pod. The dolphin appeared in a viral clip
  in early August in the bay alongside Lynda MacDonald, her partner, her son and
  his girlfriend as they were out for a swim. The dolphin bobbed in and out of
  the water, playfully engaging them and receiving belly rubs. Though the
  interaction appeared jovial and harmless, the MMO has issued a strict warning
  that such encounters “can harm dolphins leading to injury, death, or
  aggression”, urging the public to keep its distance. The MMO said the public
  should “never swim with, touch, feed, or approach dolphins. If a dolphin
  approaches you, calmly leave the area.” “Human interaction can cause dolphins
  to lose their natural wariness, leading to injury or even death,” the agency
  added. “Disturbed dolphins are also known to become aggressive toward people.
  “Dolphins may seem friendly, but they are wild animals. The dolphin in Lyme
  Bay has already been injured by a suspected boat propeller,” the MMO said.
  “Let’s protect them by keeping our distance and please share this message to
  respect their space.” Whale and Dolphin Conservation, a charity dedicated to
  protecting wild dolphins and whales, says dolphins can be disturbed not only
  by jetskis and motorboats but any intrusive human interaction. When people
  encounter dolphins, the WDC advises keeping a safe distance, leaving after
  about 15 minutes, and ensuring no more than two boats are within 300 metres of
  a group of dolphins. According to the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, 28
  different species of whales, dolphins and porpoises have been recorded in UK
  waters – including four types of dolphin: bottlenose, common, Risso’s and
  white-beaked. There are an estimated 700 bottlenose dolphins living off the
  UK’s shores. They can be encountered fairly regularly off the British coast,
  potentially coming into contact with swimmers or people sailing, interactions
  that can cause the animals harm.
