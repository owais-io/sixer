  Women’s Super League players will resume taking the knee this season after
  England’s Lionesses abruptly stopped performing the symbolic gesture at last
  month’s European Championship. England’s players announced they would no
  longer be taking the knee before their semi-final against Italy because of the
  racist abuse aimed at Jess Carter during the tournament. The 27-year-old
  defender was targeted online by several individuals, with the first of what is
  expected to be several arrests in the case made on Thursday. In a joint
  statement two days before the Italy semi-final the England squad said: “It is
  clear we and football need to find another way to tackle racism.” But the
  Guardian has learned that the WSL has decided, after talks with club captains
  in recent days, not to abandon the pre-match protocol it introduced five years
  ago. Almost all of England’s Euro 2025 squad play in the WSL. Carter – whose
  club, Gotham FC, are in the US – is among the exceptions. The WSL is expected
  to brief clubs on plans next week, before the season begins with the
  champions, Chelsea, facing Manchester City at Stamford Bridge on Friday. After
  discussions with captains, the WSL is understood to have resolved to adopt a
  model similar to that used by the Premier League, which announced this month
  that its players would perform the gesture before two selected fixtures during
  Black History Month in October. The WSL has also decided to move away from
  taking the knee before every game owing to concerns that the symbol’s ubiquity
  may have reduced its impact, and will target specific fixtures to highlight
  the sport’s commitment to diversity and inclusion. England’s next match after
  winning the European Championship last month is a friendly against China at
  Wembley in November, and the players will decide on their stance before that
  game. The WSL declined to comment.
