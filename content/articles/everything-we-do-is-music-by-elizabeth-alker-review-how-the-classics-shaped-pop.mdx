  One of many things I did not expect to learn in this book is that the BBC
  benefited from Nazi technology. Its standard tape recorder, in use till the
  1970s, was called the BTR-2: EMI’s original model, the BTR-1, had been copied
  from a captured example of the German “magnetophon”, as used by Hitler to
  record a radio broadcast. Musicians who liked fiddling with machines, too,
  benefited from this legacy. Delia Derbyshire, the BBC Radiophonic Workshop
  pioneer who produced the original Doctor Who theme tune and otherwise
  particularly enjoyed playing an enamel green lampshade, influenced Paul
  McCartney’s experiments with tape loops, while Steve Reich hit upon his
  compositional technique of “phasing” phrases in and out of sync with one
  another on tape recorders, before training live musicians to do the same. Many
  other revolutions occurred in sheds and back rooms. Bob Moog, a musically
  trained engineer, invented his electronic synthesiser in his garage. Along
  with other synths such as the Buchla, it was initially used by avant garde
  classical composers such as the great Karlheinz Stockhausen, then deployed by
  psychedelic rockers in the 1960s, before eventually Giorgio Moroder used a
  Moog for the bass part on Donna Summer’s futurist-disco earthquake I Feel Love
  and all hell broke loose. Meanwhile, back in the 1920s, a Soviet physicist and
  spy, while working on measuring the density of gases, had accidentally
  invented a new electronic instrument that he named after himself. Leon
  Theremin’s otherworldly warbler was first toured in classical concerts before
  becoming a mainstay of 1960s sci-fi film soundtracks. Radio 3 presenter
  Elizabeth Alker’s book is a sparkling map of such connections, and it is
  enlivened by encounters with practitioners including McCartney himself, Jonny
  Greenwood from Radiohead and DJ the Blessed Madonna. Greenwood names the
  Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki as an influence – he was also “very good
  at drinking vodka late at night” – while the German electronic artist Nils
  Frahm cites John Cage as inspiration for learning to listen to the spaces
  between notes. (The female composer Pauline Oliveros, Alker argues
  persuasively, was a still under-acknowledged influence on Cage and his milieu
  at that time.) John Cale of the Velvet Underground explains how he was
  inspired to add viola drones to Lou Reed’s songs as a result of studying with
  avant garde composer La Monte Young. Young himself proves a spicy interviewee:
  “When one does music on the level that I do music,” he warns, “it is not
  entertainment.” He is rumoured, Alker reports, to be able to spend six hours
  taking a shower. Wandering through the whole book like a dapper ghost,
  meanwhile, is Erik Satie, the Parisian prophet of what he called,
  self-deprecatingly, “furniture music”. He has apparently influenced absolutely
  everyone, up to and including ambient-techno pioneers the Orb. Despite this
  book’s subtitle, of course, it has never been a simple one-way street from
  classical music to pop. Popular music, in the form of jazz, heavily influenced
  Stravinsky – and so did the folk tradition. What counts as “classical” music
  is, too, a matter for debate. Alker praises 20th-century experimenters for
  working to “free” music from “classical” notions of strict harmony and rhythm,
  though the idea that those were an oppressive prison is now very old hat.
  Indeed, she later celebrates composers, such as Terry Riley and Reich, who
  willingly re-embraced the servitude apparently represented by C-major chords.
  And the modern “neoclassical” movement represented by Frahm and Ólafur
  Arnalds, which follows on from Reich’s and Philip Glass’s minimalism, is all
  about harmony and melody, as well as the kind of relaxing vibe it shares with
  Japanese ambient electronica, itself the subject of a particularly lovely
  final chapter. But this is a book that delights in music and sound of all
  kinds, and its author has the wit to call the surge in popularity of ambient
  music a “quiet boom”, so this is merely a quibble. Its guiding principle
  nestles in a wise line supplied to the author by bassist and record producer
  Youth (AKA Martin Glover) and then echoed approvingly by Reich himself: “Good
  music is good music.” • Everything We Do Is Music: How 20th-Century Classical
  Music Shaped Pop by Elizabeth Alker is published by Faber (£20). To support
