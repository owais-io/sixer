  The Racial Justice Centre is preparing to file a group complaint with the
  Australian Human Rights Commission after a Sydney restaurant denied dine-in
  service to people wearing Palestinian keffiyehs during a 20-minute period last
  weekend. The legal centre will file the complaint to Australia’s national
  anti-discrimination body on behalf of six Palestinian complainants, regarding
  an incident that took place on 3 August at Merivale-owned Jimmy’s Falafel in
  the Sydney CBD after the Sydney Harbour Bridge march, first reported by the
  Sydney Morning Herald. Guardian Australia has spoken to four people, not part
  of the complaint, who report being told they would be barred from eating
  inside at Jimmy’s Falafel unless they removed their keffiyehs. A man who
  wishes to be identified as Amir – not his real name – travelled from
  Queensland to Sydney to attend the pro-Palestine protest. Afterwards, Amir and
  his friend Hasan, who were both wearing Palestinian keffiyehs, went searching
  for food and stumbled across Jimmy’s Falafel on George Street. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email Amir said while they were asking a restaurant employee if
  a table was vacant, a security guard approached the pair and said their
  scarves could not be worn inside the venue and had to be removed if they
  wanted to dine in. The security guard said the directive came from the
  restaurant manager, Amir said. “We were quite shocked that this is happening
  to us, right in the centre of Sydney,” he said. Amir, who said he saw other
  people also being turned away due to wearing keffiyehs, said the pair calmly
  left the venue. Keffiyehs, traditional scarves worn across the Middle East,
  are often worn by people expressing support for Palestine. A Merivale
  spokesperson said in a written statement that Jimmy’s Falafel was patronised
  by many who participated in the Harbour Bridge protest march on 3 August,
  including “many, many people wearing keffiyehs and hijabs”. The statement said
  that a management decision was made at about 3.55pm “that people carrying
  large flags and placards should not carry or display them within the Jimmy’s
  Falafel venue”, after instances of members of the public “yelling obscenities
  and violent rhetoric” at Merivale venues on George Street, including comments
  such as “death to the IDF”, “death to all Zionist pigs” and “f***ing Zionist
  pigs and scum”. “Jimmy’s staff understood that decision as providing that
  persons wearing political garb and/or carrying flags and placards should be
  kindly asked to remove those items (place them in their bags) before
  entering,” the spokesperson said. “This meant that for the period 3.55pm to
  4.15pm, people wearing political items of clothing were politely asked to
  remove those items and place them in their bags before entering.” Merivale
  CCTV footage, viewed by Guardian Australia, shows that during that 20-minute
  window, some patrons wearing keffiyehs left the venue or were turned away,
  while others removed them before entering or ordering takeaway. The footage
  shows other diners wearing keffiyehs inside the venue during that period, as
  well as at other points during the day. On the footage, which did not include
  audio, just before the start of the 20-minute period, protesters appear to
  yell into the venue. “To be clear, at no time was anyone refused entry or
  discriminated against due to their political or religious affiliations. As you
  can imagine, it was a day of thousands of people attending the city. It was a
  challenging time for venue staff, and we of course have an obligation to their
  safety and comfort. Merivale is politically neutral and has no interest
  whatsoever in disabusing any patron of their religious or political views,”
  the spokesperson said. “No Merivale venues including Jimmy’s Falafel have
  policies on customers wearing keffiyehs or other scarves.” Sharfah Mohamed, a
  lawyer at the Racial Justice Centre, said: “Our position is that Merivale’s
  conduct breaches the federal Racial Discrimination Act.” In a written
  statement, Mohamed said that security personnel “in all types of venues are
  required to respond to threats to safety on a case-by-case basis based on
  actual conduct”. “As to neutrality, there is nothing neutral about banning the
  cultural garment of a specific racial or ethnic group,” Mohamed said. Hasan,
  who requested his last name be withheld, said the security guard did not say
  why they were not allowed to wear the keffiyehs inside the venue. “We were
  humiliated. I felt humiliated,” he said. Hasan, who is Lebanese, said the
  keffiyeh resonates with Palestinians and is a symbol of “hope and freedom”.
  “We just wanted to become one with the Palestinian people and show solidarity
  with them,” he said. Amir said he now fears wearing a keffiyeh in public or
  expressing his opinion about the conflict in the Middle East. “I feel quite
  shocked, traumatised and humiliated,” he said. Qamar Albashir said he was
  wearing a Moroccan scarf when his group of six people approached Jimmy’s
  Falafel. He said the security guard told the group, which included three
  people wearing keffiyehs, they could not enter the venue wearing the scarves
  and would have to remove them to go inside. “We were kind of dumbfounded. When
  [they] said we couldn’t go in we ask why not, and the security guard said it
  was a private establishment. We were lost for words.” “It felt really
  horrible. We felt further anguished because our kids were there with us.” A
  fourth man, who requested anonymity, said he was also denied entry to Jimmy’s
  Falafel on the afternoon of the march while wearing a Jordanian keffiyeh. “We
  were told by the security guard that we wouldn’t be allowed in because we were
  wearing scarves,” he said. “We were in shock at first.” The man said he was
  accompanied by his wife, who was wearing a Palestinian keffiyeh, and his
  friend, who was not wearing a scarf. He said the group observed two other
  groups, where some members were wearing Palestinian keffiyehs, who were denied
  entry on the same basis. The man said his friend ordered takeaway food from
  the venue from the street for the group.
