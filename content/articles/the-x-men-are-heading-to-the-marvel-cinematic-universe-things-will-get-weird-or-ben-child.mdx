  The news this week that the X-Men are finally heading to the Marvel Cinematic
  Universe has been predicted ever since Disney’s $71bn buyout of 20th Century
  Fox in 2019, when every comic book mutant back to Apocalypse suddenly became
  available to Kevin Feige and Marvel. But it remains to be seen when and how
  Jean Grey, Cyclops et al will finally make landfall on Earth-616, especially
  since nobody has yet explained how Marvel plans to smuggle them into a
  timeline that has spent the best part of two decades blissfully ignoring their
  existence. In an interview with Empire magazine, Thunderbolts* director, Jake
  Schreier, describes the chance to oversee the X-Men reboot – which is unlikely
  to land before 2028 – as “an incredible opportunity with super interesting
  characters and internal conflict”, adding: “These characters are wrestling
  with their identity and place in the world – that’s inherently interesting and
  complex material.” Which, of course, is the usual guff film-makers blurt out
  when trying to reassure fans that they’re taking the project seriously, but
  tells us zilch about how it is all going to pan out. The big problem for
  anyone trying to suddenly introduce mutants into the MCU is that screenwriters
  can’t magic up a 20-year-old Cyclops without explaining how he somehow missed
  the Battle of New York, the Ultron incident and Thanos’s big midlife crisis.
  Industry reports suggest that Marvel wants to introduce a new generation of
  younger X-Men, which means that unless something really interesting (and
  possibly narratively dysfunctional) is going on, they would have been born
  around the time Tony Stark was still cheerfully selling weapons to failed
  states, a couple of years before 2008’s Iron Man kicked off the whole MCU
  circus. So where have all these X-babies been all this time? Of course Marvel
  can and will introduce alternate-universe versions of Professor X, Magneto,
  Jean Grey and so forth, as is the plan in next year’s Avengers: Doomsday, with
  old favourites from the Fox years such as Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen
  turning up for one last hurrah. And we’ve already seen Deadpool and Wolverine
  in the main reality. But that doesn’t allow Marvel to present the X-Men as
  they have always existed in the comics: as a huge new wave of mutants who
  suddenly begin to proliferate at a monumental moment in history, reshaping the
  world around them. So what are Marvel’s options? The most obvious universal
  reset button, if it really does want to persuade us the X-Men have just
  appeared from nowhere, is to use the Blip – which already functions as this
  creaking old franchise’s narrative duct tape and may as well be wheeled out
  again in the studio’s hour of need. You will probably recall that after Thanos
  finger-snapped half the galaxy out of existence in 2018’s Infinity War, things
  got very weird – especially when everyone inconveniently popped back in 2019’s
  Endgame, thanks to the time-bending efforts of Stark et al. What if, a few
  years later, it turns out that quite a few of those cosmic returnees were
  actually resurrected with added extra laser eyes and angel wings? Would anyone
  really bat an eyelid? Then there’s the multiverse option. After 2027’s
  Avengers: Secret Wars, Marvel simply grafts on a universe where mutants have
  always been around. It’s been done before in the comics: the 2015 Secret Wars
  event cheerfully stitched together Earth-616 with the Ultimate universe,
  giving us a brand-new continuity. It’s the kind of narrative sleight of hand
  only Marvel could get away with. And if all else fails, there’s always
  Elizabeth Olsen’s Scarlet Witch – except she’s technically dead, having
  brought down an ancient sorcerer’s temple on her own head in Multiverse of
  Madness. But death in the MCU has all the permanence of a bank holiday parking
  restriction, so it’s not inconceivable that Marvel drags her back to flick the
  mutant switch. Wanda’s chaos magic could be rebranded as a patch update – the
  kind that suddenly downloads the “Mutant Expansion Pack” whether you wanted it
  or not. There are other options. Perhaps mutants have been here all along, and
  Professor X has been quietly gaslighting humanity for decades. Or maybe the
  Celestials, those giant space gods from Eternals who are often credited with
  priming humanity for mutation in the comics, have been at it again. The Blip
  flips the switch, and suddenly we’re knee-deep in superpowered teens, with the
  only slight snag being that Marvel would have to admit Chloé Zhao’s misfiring
  nonentity of a film actually happened. Either way, the X-Men are finally on
  their way, and the MCU is likely to be forever changed. Unless Feige and his
  team have something up their sleeves we haven’t imagined yet, their arrival is
  likely to be clunky. Then again, if the past two decades have taught us
  anything, it’s that subtlety was never Marvel’s superpower in the first place.
