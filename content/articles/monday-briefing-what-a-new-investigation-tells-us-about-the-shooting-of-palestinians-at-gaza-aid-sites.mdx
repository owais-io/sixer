  Good morning. In May 2025, Israel dismantled the United Nations-led
  humanitarian aid distribution system in Gaza. In its place came a distribution
  scheme run by the secretive Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) that came under
  immediate scrutiny for its “militarised model” and close ties to Israeli
  authorities, which rights groups warned “undermines the core humanitarian
  principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence”. In the
  months since, humanitarians’ worst fears about the aid sites have been
  realised. International observers have expressed concern as daily reports
  emerged of civilians being shot, shelled or crushed while attempting to access
  aid. Almost 1,400 Palestinians have reportedly been killed while seeking food,
  primarily near GHF distribution sites. Bitter dispute over responsibility has
  followed. Journalists, Palestinian eyewitnesses and humanitarian workers on
  the ground have attributed the killings to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF),
  alleging that soldiers have fired on civilians. The IDF and GHF reject these
  allegations, denying the reported death toll and claims of misconduct. They
  argue that accusations of starvation are either exaggerated or the result of a
  UN failure to distribute aid effectively. Now, a new investigation by the
  Guardian has corroborated longstanding claims by Palestinian journalists and
  aid workers, finding evidence that Israeli forces have repeatedly fired on
  civilians attempting to access food. For today’s newsletter, I spoke to
  investigative correspondent and the paper’s visual forensics lead Manisha
  Ganguly on what exactly her investigation found, and how we reached this
  catastrophic moment. That’s after the headlines. Five big stories Israel-Gaza
  war | Benjamin Netanyahu has defended his plan to take control of Gaza City,
  even as senior UN officials warned the move risked unleashing “another
  calamity” on the territory. On Sunday, Anas al-Sharif, a prominent Al Jazeera
  journalist, was killed in an Israeli airstrike. Israel admitted a deliberate
  attack on the journalist. Ukraine | Europe’s leaders have raised the pressure
  on Donald Trump to involve Ukraine in a planned summit with Vladimir Putin, as
  Germany warned the White House against any deal hatched “over the heads of
  Europeans and Ukrainians”. Housing | Lower-income householders, minority
  ethnic people and those with young children are more likely to live in homes
  at risk from dangerous overheating, research has found. UK news | Half of the
  people arrested during the protest in relation to Palestine Action in London
  on Saturday were aged 60 or above, according to police figures. A total of 532
  people were arrested at the largest demonstration relating to the group – all
  but 10 under section 13 of the Terrorism Act for displaying supportive
  placards or signs. Crime | Foreign criminals from 15 more countries face
  deportation before they have a chance to appeal, in an expansion of the UK
  government’s “deport first, appeal later” scheme. In depth: ‘The Israeli
  military is indiscriminately firing on Palestinians’ When Israel shut down the
  UN-led humanitarian aid system, the government alleged Palestinian militant
  group Hamas was diverting aid to support its operations. However, a USAID
  analysis published last month found no evidence of large-scale diversion of
  aid by Hamas. The following day, The New York Times reported that an Israeli
  military official acknowledged there was no proof Hamas was routinely stealing
  UN-provided aid. Manisha Ganguly tells me that, on the back of this claim,
  Israel imposed an 11-week siege on the Gaza Strip. “During this time, Gaza’s
  population, over two million people, was effectively starved, creating the
  acute conditions we’re seeing now.” The GHF was set up amid the siege and
  became the only organisation allowed to operate in the Strip, she explains,
  while veteran aid groups were refused entry. “GHF only operates in areas under
  IDF control. Humanitarian organisations like Oxfam, whose policy lead for the
  Occupied Palestinian Territories, Bushra Khalidi, told me that the conditions
  under which GHF operates, conditions set by the Israeli military, do not meet
  the standards required by international humanitarian law,” she adds. She
  explains that international law says aid must be delivered independently,
  impartially and with safe access. But due to IDF operations in Gaza, there is
  no real way to do this. She points to two key indicators of the lack of safe
  access: • All four GHF food distribution sites are located in areas the
  Israeli military has marked for evacuation. To collect food, Palestinians must
  enter zones of direct danger. • There are reports, and video evidence, of the
  Israeli military firing on Palestinians near or en route to these distribution
  sites. *** What does the evidence show? Manisha reviewed a range of evidence,
  and reached a damning conclusion. She first started with videos uploaded to
  social media by Palestinians showing attempts to collect food near GHF sites.
  “In nearly all of them, you hear the distinctive sound of machine-gun fire. A
  weapons expert told me the machine guns heard are likely Israeli. Hamas does
  have machine guns, but they’re typically used ceremonially and don’t match the
  pattern here,” she says. Next, she spoke to doctors at Nasser hospital in Khan
  Younis, and a field hospital operated by the International Red Cross. “They
  reported a clear correlation between spikes in gunshot wounds and days when
  food was being distributed, at a level that was unprecedented in the entire
  previous year,” Manisha says. “One surgeon told me that every single patient
  with gunshot wounds said they had come under Israeli fire.” Then, to
  strengthen the link, she asked surgeons to send photos of bullets removed from
  patients. “The tricky thing about bullets is that you need exact measurements
  to be able to correctly attribute it. For two of them, I had exact
  measurements: one matched the IDF’s standard calibre of bullet. The other
  matched calibres used by both the IDF and some Hamas snipers – but remember,
  the firing heard in the videos was unmistakably machine-gun fire, not sniper
  fire,” she says. “If you combine the visual evidence of machine gun fire, the
  Palestinian testimony, reports from doctors at hospitals who are describing an
  overwhelming number of patients with gunshot wounds coming in, in an
  unprecedented way that they hadn’t seen in the previous entire year of the
  war, with the really solid evidence of the bullet being cut out of patients
  and analysed, it paints a very clear picture,” she says. Manisha didn’t want
  there to be any reasonable doubt, so she also reviewed one specific video
  where you can actually hear the machine gun fire, and see the bullets hitting
  the sand right next to Palestinians in the immediate vicinity of the GHF food
  site. “There is an overwhelming amount of evidence that suggests that the
  Israeli military has been indiscriminately firing on Palestinian food seekers
  in an extremely sustained way.” One particularly disturbing testimony came
  from Prof Nick Maynard, a consultant surgeon at Oxford University Hospitals,
  who has visited Gaza repeatedly since 2010. He spoke to Manisha during his
  third mission to Nasser hospital since the current war began. “He said that on
  particular days, he saw particular body parts being targeted. One night he was
  on call, Nasser hospital admitted four teenage boys, all of whom had been shot
  in the testicles. Other days, he saw patterns of gunshots to the neck, head,
  or arms, and he told me that the clustering of similar injuries in one day
  suggests that this is a targeting activity,” she says. *** How the IDF and GHF
  responded When Manisha put these conclusions to the IDF, they “unequivocally
  denied” deliberately targeting civilians or minors and said they have standing
  orders prohibiting intentional fire on these groups. The IDF has admitted to
  firing “warning shots” at Palestinians. But weapons experts told Manisha that
  what’s happening doesn’t fit that definition. In the two cases she reviewed,
  the victims were civilians trying to collect food. The IDF explanation that
  troops were firing at “suspicious individuals” or people who “left the queue”
  just doesn’t hold up. The response from GHF was interesting, too. “In the
  first instance, they accused me of aiding Hamas, and said the statistics I
  used in my report appeared to directly align with the Gaza Health Ministry,
  and called them false and exaggerated,” Manisha says, “even though my analysis
  relied on Red Cross data, UN statistics and extensive interviews with
  doctors.” The GHF also added that it had reached out to the UN and other
  humanitarian organisations to collaborate, but that the UN continues to reject
  those offers. *** What this means for the GHF scheme Last Friday, Israel’s
  security cabinet approved a plan to take over Gaza City, marking another
  escalation in the 22-month offensive that has killed tens of thousands of
  Palestinians, destroyed most of Gaza and pushed the territory toward famine.
  Israel has said it would work with the US to continue getting aid into the
  territory. It’s now clear that it will be through the GHF. Manisha tells me
  that the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, who recently visited Gaza on
  a trip with Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, described GHF’s
  work as “phenomenal”. Reports have since come out that Huckabee was told they
  are exploring the possibility of opening 12 new sites and a 24-hour operation.
  “The rationale behind the 24-hour operation is that it is easier and safer for
  Palestinians to travel to the sites – at the moment they’re open for a limited
  period. Palestinians usually end up travelling at night or in the early hours
  of the morning and queueing for hours while facing bullets from the Israeli
  military,” Manisha says. “So they’re thinking, this might minimise it, but it
  doesn’t go to the heart of the central problem: the Israeli military is
  indiscriminately firing on Palestinians.” What else we’ve been reading In case

  reincarnations of the recently departed is chilling. From Rod Stewart’s weird

  you that the world’s not all bad Saturday’s baseball game between the Atlanta

  the season. It saw, however, a remarkable moment in Major League Baseball
  history as umpire Jen Pawol became the first woman in league history to
  referee a game. After a decade working up through the minor leagues, the
  48-year-old former art teacher, finally got her much-deserved chance. “It was
  pretty amazing when we took the field,” Pawol said after the game. “It seemed
  like quite a few people started clapping and saying my name, so that was
  pretty intense and very emotional.” Sign up here for a weekly roundup of The
