  Jaime Slaughter-Acey was in a state of shock and anger when she learned that
  her National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded study on birth outcomes in
  Black families was cancelled this spring. The University of North Carolina at
  Chapel Hill associate professor in epidemiology said that she felt like “the
  rug was pulled out from under us” when the university called her to share the
  news. The termination notice said that the study no longer met the agency’s
  priorities and didn’t promise to increase life expectancy. “It was
  heartbreaking,” Slaughter-Acey told the Guardian, “and honestly, infuriating
  given the high rates of maternal and infant mortality in this country.” The
  cancellation came as the Trump administration terminated 1,902 NIH grants
  totalling more than $4.4bn between his January inauguration and the end of
  July, according to Grant Witness data. NIH followed guidance from the
  so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) and Trump’s executive
  orders to cut costs. Additionally, in April, the Trump administration let go
  of a majority of the staff at the federal Division of Reproductive Health, a
  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) office that collects data on
  maternal experiences. It also surveils pregnancy-related deaths in an effort
  to reduce infant mortality and improve health outcomes for mothers and their
  children. Slaughter-Acey’s several-year study funded by a more than $2.4m NIH
  grant aimed to look at how social and biological factors affect outcomes for
  more than 500 Black women in Detroit. The grant termination froze the team’s
  more than $581,000 remaining funding. Through blood samples and surveys of
  Black mothers and grandmothers, Slaughter-Acey and her team aimed to
  understand if social environments accelerated how bodies physiologically age,
  otherwise known as biological ageing, which may lead to adverse pregnancy
  outcomes for Black women. She said that the research is “designed to tell us
  how social environment and the pathways that social environment affects us
  physiologically, to then increase this risk that Black moms and Black babies
  have with respect to pregnancy”. While most studies that look at racism only
  focus on one point in time, Slaughter-Acey said that hers was “the first study
  to comprehensively examine how exposure to structural, cultural and
  intergenerational racism throughout a Black woman’s life impacts her epigenome
  and her child’s birth outcomes.” It was also innovative because Black women
  are underrepresented in epigenomic studies, a field where researchers look at
  how environment and behavior impacts a person’s genes, said Slaughter-Acey,
  due to medical mistrust and experiences of racism in the healthcare system.
  ‘When science is silenced, communities suffer’ The NIH-grant cancellation in
  late March followed the release of data from the CDC revealing that Black
  women were the only race or ethnic group who didn’t experience a decline in
  deaths from pregnancy related causes in 2023. Out of every 100,000 live
  births, 50.3 Black mothers died, compared with 14.5 deaths for white people,
  12.4 for Latinos and 10.7 for Asians. The NIH didn’t respond to a request for
  comment. Slaughter-Acey fears that the grant-cancellation signals that
  research and efforts to close the maternal death gap are at risk of coming to
  a standstill under the Trump administration. Other NIH grants that have been
  terminated include one that looked at prenatal exposure to public drinking
  water contaminants and a study that analyzed why women of color die of
  cervical cancer at a disproportionate rate. On Thursday, the Trump
  administration froze UCLA research grants from federal agencies including NIH
  and the National Science Foundation totaling nearly $200m, accusing the
  university of antisemitism and discrimination in admissions. “It’s part of a
  larger pattern of political interference in science that puts the health of
  all people at risk, especially vulnerable populations,” Slaughter-Acey said.
  The study “is about understanding the root causes of poor maternal and infant
  health in this country – something that affects all of us, regardless of race
  or background. When science is silenced, communities suffer”. Still,
  Slaughter-Acey and her team are hopeful that the study will continue for years
  to come as they search for alternative funding sources, including donations.
  On Slaughter-Acey’s LinkedIn page, she called upon her followers to donate to
  the University of North Carolina Department of Epidemiology, and to include a
  note that they support Slaughter-Acey’s work, or the name of the study,
  “LIFE-2”. “The voices of these 500 plus moms and babies should not die or be
  silenced with the termination of this grant,” she told the Guardian. The pull
  in funding “is an example of erasure of black mothers and infants”. There has
  been some temporary relief. This June, Slaughter-Acey’s team received
  short-term funding from Michigan State University to continue their study over
  the next few months. Now nearly 600 moms are enrolled in the study, but
  without additional funding, it will probably pause again at the end of the
  year. ‘We need research that reflects Black women’s experiences’ The nearly
  600 women who have joined the study were recruited from local delivery
  hospitals in Detroit, Michigan, in the day or two following childbirth.
  Slaughter-Acey chose Detroit since she completed her post-doc at the
  University of Michigan, where she researched the influence of social
  environments on Black maternal health. Participants for her study, which began
  in 2021, completed a post-delivery survey where they answered questions about
  social determinants of health including housing and food insecurity throughout
  their life. Along with collecting their blood through a finger prick,
  researchers also collect the babies’ and mothers’ birth certificates from the
  state health department as well as the mothers’ blood that was collected at
  birth and stored in a biobank. About 20% of the babies’ grandmothers are also
  participating in the study by answering questions about the social environment
  during their pregnancies and their daughters’ early childhoods. The multilevel
  data collection allows the researchers to create “this robust and triangulated
  dataset that includes social determinants of health, like information about
  food and housing insecurity”, Slaughter-Acey said. “It’s capturing a more
  holistic view than what’s been captured previously for moms in terms of
  maternal and infant health.” After the moms are discharged from the hospital,
  the researchers also follow up with a majority of the women eight to 10 weeks
  after they give birth to ask about their adjustment to motherhood, whether
  they’ve received support for breastfeeding, a postpartum healthcare visit, or
  if they’ve experienced discrimination from their healthcare providers. At the
  time of the funding termination, the research team was in the process of
  creating a 12-month postpartum checkup with the mothers to help define
  maternal thriving. “When we are talking about maternal morbidity and
  mortality, we’re defining maternal health by the absence of disease, by mom
  not dying, by mom not having a severe morbidity,” Slaughter-Acey said. “But
  the field in general does not have a good understanding or even definition of,
  ‘what does maternal thriving look like?’ And we need to get past this
  conversation of maternal survival, and move to thriving.” More than two years
  of funding remained in the NIH grant, during which her team had planned to
  recruit more mothers and to conduct data analysis. They also aimed to create a
  website for participants to read about the study’s findings. But the data that
  the team has analyzed thus far has revealed that mothers with a lot of adverse
  childhood experiences were more likely to have conflict with the father of the
  child. The finding, Slaughter-Acey said, “underscores the importance of
  understanding how the social environment influences relationship dynamics and
  maybe perinatal outcomes. We know that social support is key during
  pregnancy”. The team also found that one in five study participants
  experienced housing insecurity during their pregnancy, a factor that she said
  greatly affects perinatal health and is rarely documented in hospital records.
  They also created a tool to measure racial microagressions from healthcare
  providers and in the mothers’ everyday life, since many in the cohort said
  that they experienced harmful interactions that Slaughter-Acey said may
  explain why they felt unsupported. For Slaughter-Acey, the study findings
  “highlight how structural inequities – across housing, healthcare, and
  personal history – intersect to shape maternal and infant outcomes. And they
  underscore why we need research that listens to and reflects the full
  complexity of Black women’s experiences.” NIH research funding will probably
  continue to take a hit under the Trump administration. A new Trump
  administration policy requiring that multiyear grants be paid upfront lowers
  the odds that a research proposal will be accepted. As a result, university
  labs may close.
