  A group who claim technical problems with Fifa’s online football agent exam
  prevented them from completing the test are to take their cases to the court
  of arbitration for sport. As revealed last month in the Guardian, dozens of
  prospective agents complained there were various issues with the platform
  being used for the new global exam that took place for the first time on 18
  June. That included candidates left with insufficient time to answer the
  questions and later finding out that multiple answers had not been recorded.
  Some were allowed to resit the exam on 30 June, but many were informed they
  will have to wait until next year and had no right to appeal. In a letter sent
  last month to Fifa’s general secretariat, the group of more than 40 candidates
  who were affected asked for a review “based on fundamental and obvious errors
  in the application of Fifa regulations” that they estimate could have had an
  effect on “thousands worldwide”. “Across borders and examination centres,
  candidates encountered severe technical and procedural irregularities that
  compromised the fairness, transparency and validity of the exam,” the letter
  says, listing several examples including “incorrect or misleading questions”
  and “multiple correct answers marked as wrong”. “The list of technical issues
  is extensive and in many cases nearly never‑ending. These conditions made it
  impossible for many candidates to complete the exam under fair or standardised
  conditions. We are appealing directly to Fifa, believing in its responsibility
  and commitment to justice. We are not an institution. We are students and
  professionals, volunteering our time in search of fairness. Please do not
  reject our appeal automatically.” Fifa said it “diligently checked every
  substantiated complaint regarding technical impediments in the context of the
  exam” but could not respond further to the letter and claimed the issue had
  “already been resolved”. As such, the group is now planning to take their case
  to Cas, where they will request an opportunity to retake the exam before the
  scheduled date next year. Fifa has yet to comment publicly on the claims, but
  has been reassured by providers that there was no issue with the exam
  platform. World football’s governing body is believed to be satisfied that
  most of the candidates were able to take the exam with no technical problems.
