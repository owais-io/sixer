  The Trump administration announced plans to impose a 50% tariff on copper
  pipes and wiring, roiling US prices after details of the levy fell short of
  the sweeping restrictions expected. By leaving out copper input materials such
  as ores, concentrates and cathodes, the new policy will fall significantly
  short of Donald Trump’s initial threats to introduce a sweeping new levy on
  overseas shipments of the metal. The surprise move dragged down US copper
  prices more than 17% on the Comex exchange and unwound a premium over the
  London global benchmark that had grown in recent weeks, with shipments
  diverted there in anticipation of higher domestic prices. “Markets are now
  busily repricing refined copper much lower after Trump’s epic backflip on his
  own import tariff policy,” said Tom Price, an analyst at the London brokerage
  Panmure Liberum. “Someone must have finally got through to [Trump] that the US
  economy simply can’t afford this new trade-hit.” Freeport-McMoRan is likely to
  be among the most harmed by the trimmed tariff, according to RBC Capital
  Markets, with Hudbay Minerals, Arizona Sonoran and others developing mines in
  the country also affected. The US president first teased the tariff in early
  July, implying that it would apply to all types of the red metal, ranging from
  cathodes produced by mines and smelters to wiring and other finished products.
  Yet in a proclamation released by the White House, the administration said the
  tariff would apply starting this Friday only to pipes, tubes and other
  semi-finished copper products, as well as products that copper is heavily used
  to manufacture, including cable and electrical components. In the executive
  order, Trump said Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, had concluded “that
  copper is being imported into the United States in such quantities and under
  such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the
  United States”. The move aids manufacturers, but does little to boost the
  constrained US copper mining industry, which for years has asked Washington
  for permitting reform or other steps that could fuel growth. The tariffs will
  exclude copper scrap and copper concentrates, mattes, cathodes and anodes,
  some of the main products of copper mines and smelters. The move is
  essentially a boost for Chile and Peru, two of the world’s largest copper
  miners and major suppliers to the United States. Reuters contributed reporting
