  In the overcrowded, rubble strewn streets of Gaza City, there was little
  surprise at the announcement that UN-backed experts believed the scenes of
  desperation could now be formally described as a famine. “This is something we
  have been saying for months now, and we have witnessed this and we have been
  living this and suffering this. We feel very powerless and very sick and very
  tired,” said Amjad Shawa, the director of the Palestinian NGO Network, who has
  been in Gaza City throughout the 22-month war. On Friday, the Integrated Food
  Security Phase Classification (IPC), a globally recognised organisation that
  classifies the severity of food insecurity and malnutrition, found that three
  key thresholds for a declaration of famine had been met in the once bustling
  commercial and administrative hub. Only four famines have been declared by the
  IPC since it was established in 2004, most recently in Sudan last year. “This
  famine is entirely man-made, it can be halted and reversed,” the report said.
  It warned of an exponential increase in deaths if “a ceasefire is not
  implemented … and essential food supplies and basic … services are not
  restored immediately”. It is the most vulnerable among the Palestinians now
  living in Gaza City, thought to be between 500,00 and 800,000 people, that are
  most at risk, especially elderly people, the young, sick or socially isolated,
  aid officials have said. “I have nothing to cook and no money to buy firewood
  for cooking. We eat a little food in the morning to stop our hunger and a
  little more at night. I eat just some za’atar [spice mix], cheese or just salt
  with bread, no vegetables, nothing cooked,” said Sabah Antaiz, 55, who was
  displaced from the Tuffah neighbourhood in eastern Gaza City by recent Israeli
  offensives. Antaiz has hypertension, diabetes and a heart condition. Her
  husband, 60, is very ill and cannot work or collect food. “We have no one
  left, no one to support me or even bring us food. I lost about 10 members of
  my family in an airstrike on Tuffah neighbourhood: my father, mother, nephews
  and nieces, the children of my brothers and sisters,” Antaiz said. Israeli
  authorities tightened their existing blockade of Gaza at the beginning of the
  conflict in October 2023 and imposed a two-month total ban on supplies in
  March and April. More has reached Gaza in recent weeks, though only a fraction
  of what is needed, aid agencies say. The price of sugar has gone from about
  $100 (£74) for a kilogram to about $7, but much else remains too expensive for
  the 90% of people who have no income. Tomatoes cost $30 a kg. Ibtisam Saleh,
  50, who lives in a tent in Gaza City after being displaced 20 times, said she
  had no food and no source of income. “What we have now comes only from aid or
  gifts. Before the war, I used to receive $100 each month from the Qatari
  embassy because I was divorced and had a son. But since the war began, we have
  not received anything,” Saleh said. Saleh eats one meal a day, usually
  lentils, though earlier this week a neighbour gave her a small bag of rice. “I
  do not have the strength to stand in line waiting to get my share [of any food
  aid]. One time I fainted while waiting. The sun was very hot and I am
  hypertensive. Because of the heat, my blood pressure dropped and I lost
  consciousness,” Saleh said. Along with the sick and elderly people, there are
  those who are destitute. After almost two years of displacement and
  deprivation, few in Gaza City have any physical or financial reserves. “This
  is a population that has been stripped of any resilience … They have
  absolutely nothing. There is no safety margin at all. They are right on the
  very edge,” said one UN aid official with oversight of operations across Gaza.
  There are deep concerns about the very north of Gaza, where thousands still
  live among ruins in the worst humanitarian conditions anywhere in the battered
  territory, though data there was insufficient for the IPC to make a judgment
  on the category of the crisis. In Gaza City, families sleep in the open on
  streets without shelter or pack into crowded, damaged apartments or tented
  camps where flies, mosquitoes and infectious diseases are rife. Rubbish piles
  up everywhere and choking smoke from plastic burning on fires causes chronic
  coughs. In recent weeks, temperatures have soared. Riham Kraiem, 35, lives in
  a tent in Gaza City with her unemployed husband and their 10 children aged
  between two and 18. They had to leave their home in Beit Hanoun, a now
  flattened northern town, three months ago. An Israeli military assault near
  the school where they were sheltering initially pushed them to Gaza City. “For
  the past three months, we haven’t received any money or aid. We no longer have
  money to buy anything, even though prices have come down,” Kraiem said. “My
  children ask for many things … They want me to make them sweets but I can’t
  because we have no money. We eat only two meals a day, one in the morning and
  one in the evening. This morning, I cooked a can of lentils and we ate that.
  In the evening, we usually eat thyme or cheese with bread and sometimes just
  bread alone.” Kraiem said she had no food supplies left. “We left some behind
  in our home when we fled, and the house was destroyed,” she said. “Yesterday,
  my son went to look for aid and got one kilogram of pasta and a can of tomato
  sauce. He was given it by a young man who had got it from a food distribution
  site. He came back feeling like he was flying from happiness.” Israel has
  rejected the findings of the IPC report, saying there is no famine in Gaza and
  that the findings were based on “Hamas lies laundered through organisations
  with vested interests”.
