  Crystal Palace’s European adventure goes on after successfully navigating past
  Norwegian opponents who were determined to make things hard for the FA Cup
  winners on a tricky plastic pitch. After being denied entry into the Europa
  League by Uefa, a gritty defensive performance that equalled a club record of
  13 matches unbeaten in all competitions while playing in the top flight
  ensured that they will take their place in Friday’s draw for the Conference
  League. More than 1,700 made the journey from south London to Fredrikstad on
  an occasion many Palace supporters had never thought would become a reality.
  There were times when they would have feared that the club’s first away match
  in a major European competition may also end in disappointment as Andreas
  Hagen’s side piled on the pressure after their narrow defeat in the first leg.
  But it was Oliver Glasner, who said that he is expecting more clarity on
  captain Marc Guéhi’s future after he put in another outstanding performance on
  what could be his final appearance for the club, who was able to mark his 51st
  birthday by giving the Palace fans at least another three trips to look
  forward to. “It’s a huge achievement to get to the group stage,” said Glasner.
  “With all the noise of being demoted to the Conference League and against
  opposition who were not easy to play – there were so many long balls but the
  players did really well. It’s big for Crystal Palace.” Ever meticulous in his
  preparations, the Palace manager had made sure his squad were given an
  opportunity to train on Fredrikstad’s artificial pitch 24 hours before
  kickoff, with Adam Wharton saying it was a difficult surface to play on. So it
  proved as the Norwegian Cup winners came close to forcing the game into
  extra-time when substitute Henrik Skogvold volleyed over in injury time after
  piling on the pressure with a series of set pieces. Glasner, who arrived in
  Norway with only 14 fit outfield players available after Will Hughes and
  Odsonne Édouard were ruled out, had suggested last week he might be forced to
  bring his boots for the second leg if his captain was sold to Liverpool. Asked
  before kick-off whether there had ever been any doubt that the 25-year-old
  England defender would play, the manager appeared to suggest developments on
  Guéhi’s future are anticipated once this fixture was out of the way. “It’s
  very important,” he said. “I’m speaking to Marc almost every day and it was
  clear he would play this game in Norway and then let’s see what will come. But
  I know that I can rely on Marc and we can count on him.” Palace are understood
  to be working hard on bringing in a replacement for Guéhi before Monday’s
  transfer deadline but, even if he stays to see out the final year of his
  contract, they will need to add much more depth to the squad if they are to go
  all the way to May’s final in Leipzig. Fredrikstad were given the weekend off
  to prepare for the second leg after their spirited performance at Selhurst
  Park last week and looked much more intent on attacking in front of their home
  supporters. They have endured a disappointing second campaign in the top
  flight having won the Norwegian Cup last season and knew any chance of
  salvaging something from their season relied on them producing an upset.
  Having allowed Chris Richards a free header that he spurned in the 10th minute
  from Borna Sosa’s pinpoint corner, the hosts gave the Palace supporters
  filling out the end behind Dean Henderson’s goal plenty of cause for concern
  in the first half – especially when the England goalkeeper flapped at one of
  Eid’s long throws and Guéhi hacked the ball away to safety. Palace have not
  lost since a 5-0 thrashing by Newcastle in April and finally got to grips with
  the surface after the break as Wharton began to dictate proceedings in central
  midfield on his first experience of an away game in Europe. Whatever happens
  this season, there will surely be plenty more to come for the 21-year-old who
  will be anxiously waiting to see if he has earned a call-up from Thomas Tuchel
  on Friday after missing out on the German’s first two England squads.
  Jean-Philippe Mateta should have added to his goal in the first leg that
  eventually settled this tie when Fredrikstad goalkeeper Martin Børsheim
  somehow got back in time to save the Frenchman’s shot after he went up for a
  corner. But Palace were not to be denied.
