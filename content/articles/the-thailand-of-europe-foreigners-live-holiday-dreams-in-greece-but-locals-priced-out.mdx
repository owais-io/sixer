  From a booth facing the ferries moored at Piraeus, Tassos Papadopoulos cuts
  tickets for passengers heading to the isles of the Saronic Gulf. It’s 5pm on a
  hot summer’s day and through the sun-streaked haze he takes in the cars and
  trucks lining up to cross the steel ramp into the hold of the Aegina-bound
  vessel. Last year the queues were much longer. “People aren’t travelling it
  seems,” he says with a shrug. “The weekend traffic is heavier but ticket sales
  are down by, I’d say, 50%.” Shimmering within view of the hills beneath the
  Acropolis, the Argo-Saronic isles are popular precisely because of their
  proximity to Athens. In 2024 Aegina attracted more than 2 million visitors,
  many budget-conscious Greeks drawn by the island’s affordable ferry fares.
  “This time, last August, all the loungers over there were taken by 10am,” says
  Konstantinos Tsantas, who runs a watersports business on shores framed by the
  jagged outline of the Peloponnese beyond. “This year they’re empty. I know
  watersports people all over the country and they all say the same: that
  business is down. And to think, Aegina is comparatively cheap.” 2025 will be
  remembered as the year Greeks decided to forfeit their annual pilgrimage to
  the beach. Immortalised by singers and songwriters, poets and
  cinematographers, the carefree joys of summer have, for many, fallen prey to
  the harsh reality of making ends meet. “Our studies show that one in two
  Greeks will not go on holiday this year,” says Takis Kalofonos, chief
  financial adviser at EEKE, the union of working consumers of Greece. “Whereas
  10 years ago people would take 20 or even 30 days off, this summer it’s less
  than a week. The Cyclades and islands further out are a distant dream for many
  Greeks. Who can pay €450 on boat tickets, which is what it would cost a family
  of four with a car, when the average salary is €1,342 a month?” The great
  August retreat – often centred on the religious festival of the Dormition of
  the Virgin Mary on 15 August – has for many been whittled down to days spent
  with family or friends in villages on the mainland. “I’d love to spend time in
  Amorgos but getting to an island so far away is just out of bounds,” said
  Ismini Balale, who is 28 and struggling to survive on a retail sector salary
  of €850 a month. “I can’t cough up €200 a night for a room. All my friends are
  in the same position, and we all have postgraduate degrees. We’re taking a few
  days off, here and there, this summer.” The European Statistics agency,
  Eurostat, recently endorsed EEKE’s findings, announcing that 46% of Greeks –
  19% higher than the rest of the EU – were unable to afford a one-week holiday
  last year. In Athens, August has given way to once unimaginable scenes: the
  public transport system is bursting; traffic in the city centre has barely
  thinned; seats at open-air cinemas are sold out and bars and fast food
  eateries are teeming with young Greeks who have been unable to get away. “They
  talk about our country’s economic recovery but none of those positive indices
  affect people like me,” says Balale. “And I don’t think this government much
  cares.” Paradoxically, it is partly because Greece is such a perfect place for
  holidays that Greeks are increasingly unable to afford them. The arrival of 36
  million travellers last year – nearly four times the resident population – has
  ensured the Mediterranean country is one of the top 10 go-to places globally.
  The sector brought an estimated €21.7bn in revenue in 2024, helping Athens
  reduce its gargantuan public debt load from 180% of GDP, at the height of the
  nation’s excoriating debt crisis, to 153.6%. But while tourism is the engine
  of the Greek economy, providing at least one in five jobs, success has also
  resulted in soaring prices. Wages, by contrast, have remained stagnant,
  outpaced by inflation rates that have far outstripped other EU countries,
  prompting a steep rise in the cost of living. Those who do manage to put money
  aside say increasingly they find it cheaper to holiday abroad than within
  Greece. An Alco poll in June revealed rocketing accommodation costs, ferry
  fares and restaurant prices as the main impediments to travel. “Greeks are
  being priced out from enjoying what was a cultural and religious tradition,
  the August holiday,” says Prof Christos Pitelis, an expert on industrial
  economics and the tourism and hospitality sector at the University of
  Southampton. “Dwindling disposable incomes make this an experience many simply
  cannot afford.” With the middle class hit hardest by austerity measures that
  were the price of the bankrupt Greek economy’s rescue by international
  creditors a decade ago, the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has said
  relief measures are on the way. His centre-right government has pledged to
  bring down taxes and raise the average monthly wage to €1,500 by 2027. But it
  is not lost on Greeks that while foreign visitors can savour the natural
  beauty and other joys of their country, such pleasures for them have become a
  bittersweet memory. “We are the Thailand of Europe; we provide services for
  others to enjoy,” says Aris Apikian, taking in the passing tourists outside
  the carpet shop where he works in central Athens. “While foreigners live their
  dreams in Greece, we experience the sharp end of everything that is wrong with
  it. Who wants to go on holiday when they’re told energy bills, you name it,
  are about to rise? I think the penny is beginning to drop, now that we cannot
  afford to take even a week off, that it’s us Greeks, who are the real losers.”
