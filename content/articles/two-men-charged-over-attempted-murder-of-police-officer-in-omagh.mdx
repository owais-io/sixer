  Two men have been charged over the attempted murder of an off-duty police
  officer in Northern Ireland two years ago, police said. John Caldwell, then a
  DCI in the PSNI, was shot several times, allegedly by two men, while he was
  off duty and putting footballs in the boot of his car at a sports complex in
  Omagh, County Tyrone, in February 2023. A 45-year-old man, arrested in
  Stewartstown in Tyrone, and a man aged 25, arrested in west Belfast, have both
  been charged with the preparation of terrorist acts and with perverting the
  course of justice. The men are due to appear at Dungannon magistrates court on
  Wednesday. The charges follow their arrests and subsequent detention under the
  Terrorism Act on Monday, the Police Service of Northern Ireland said. The PSNI
  said: “As is usual procedure, all charges will be reviewed by the Public
  Prosecution Service.” Caldwell was a senior officer and has led high-profile
  investigations into paramilitaries and other criminals. Caldwell retired from
  the PSNI last December on medical grounds. He had been coaching a youth
  football match and was with his young son at the time of the shooting. He was
  released from Altnagelvin hospital in April 2023.
