  ‘I don’t want to name- drop,” says David Hughes, the Newport County manager,
  mindful of his reply to a question about the coaches who have shaped his
  career to this point, and whether he canvassed their opinion before taking the
  job this summer. The 47-year-old has spent the past three seasons at
  Manchester United, in an instrumental academy role as a development-phase
  coach, and prior to that worked at Aston Villa, Cardiff, clubs for whom he
  also played, and Southampton. This may be his first real shot at frontline
  management – aside from a few months in charge of Barry Town more than two
  decades ago – but he is anything but inexperienced. The close season always
  brings change but it is hard to imagine a starker shift than Hughes swapping a
  global institution for Newport, with one of the smallest budgets in League
  Two. He has added two performance analysts to his team but it is a skeleton
  operation compared to United’s academy structure, where he worked closely with
  Nick Cox, who is moving to Everton as their technical director. “Big, big
  clubs have huge numbers of staff, different levels of responsibility and
  accountability,” Hughes says. “But we’re really pleased with our small staff.
  We came back for pre-season and the goals were green from last season, so we
  went out as staff cleaning the goalposts and I’m thinking: ‘We’ve got a team
  here.’ Everybody’s prepared to muck in.” Hughes, who was born in Wrexham,
  calls south Wales home and acknowledges Newport has never really been a place
  for bells and whistles. “Supporters expect to see some sweat on the shirt,” he
  says. “They expect to see positive body language: don’t throw your arms in the
  air, get on with it. Let’s not carry anyone. Supporters will definitely
  forgive a mistake if there’s a willingness and intent to press and engage and
  get after the ball and force mistakes and errors into your opponents.” Did
  Hughes anticipate the opportunity to manage a senior team? “It’s a good
  question,” he says. “Did I think it would come? I suppose the older you get,
  possibly not.” His time at United, where he coached academy players on the
  pitch next to the one used by the first team, only enhanced his education. “In
  your first week or two, you go round Old Trafford, the Munich [memorial], the
  museum and see the history and heritage that’s attached to the club, and the
  individuals that have come through, and there is a responsibility. It’s just
  the most fascinating, incredible place. I don’t think there’s another place
  like it. In my eyes, it’s the pinnacle of youth development.” Hughes tackles
  the sniffy perception of managers born in academy coaching. “Like it’s a bad
  thing,” he says. “I’m not sure there’s anything to be ashamed of in trying to
  help people evolve and improve. That’s commendable, right? And I would imagine
  every manager is trying to help their players develop and evolve to help them
  win. I’m quite proud of the fact that I’ve supported people to become
  successful … it definitely wasn’t down to me, it was down to them. And so
  that’s what we’re trying to do here. We’re trying to help the team become
  successful.” He insists there are many similarities between the roles. “What’s
  different now is ‘Saturday’, I guess,” he says. This Saturday Newport host
  Notts County, who also have a new manager in Martin Paterson. Talking on a
  bench outside Newport’s training base at the University of South Wales campus
  in Treforest, Hughes is at ease in newish surroundings, citing a conversation
  with a loan player. “I went through a presentation we shared with our players
  on the first day and just said: ‘This is us, this is what we’ve got, and we’re
  really proud of it. It might not be what you’re used to where you’ve come
  from, but it’s ours.’ Let’s not look over the fence at what other people have
  got.” Newport have done things their way in pre-season, completing a recovery
  session at the lido in Pontypridd and heading to the former boxer Jamie
  Arthur’s gym in nearby Rhydyfelin. “It was almost like a mental toughness,
  conditioning session,” says Hughes. “It was just to try and take the group
  somewhere else … where you think about the skill set you need to be a boxer,
  they definitely suffer to win. And all we’re trying to do is have a culture
  where we understand and appreciate that winning looks different at times. To
  win games of football, at times you’ve got to suffer.” That pain was apparent
  on Tuesday, when Newport overcame Barnet on penalties to reach the EFL Cup
  first round after squandering their two-goal lead in second-half stoppage
  time. That triumph represented Hughes’s first match and win, and it was a game
  in which Newport donned their striking new away kit – commemorating the 36
  children who relocated to Caerleon from Bilbao after fleeing the Spanish civil
  war in 1937 – for the first time. The shirt is modelled on Athletic’s
  red-and-white stripes and on the label, beneath the flags of the Basque
  Country and Wales, a message reads: “In 1937, when the Basque people needed
  help, Wales responded.” As for those who have helped Hughes along the way and
  whether he consulted them before signing a two-year contract at Rodney Parade,
  the answer is yes. Hughes, who credits his youth-team coach at Villa, Tony
  McAndrew, as a big influence, spoke to, among others, Rob Edwards, who swapped
  his role with England’s age groups for Forest Green Rovers in the fourth tier,
  the Wales manager Craig Bellamy and Sean Dyche, whom he worked alongside at
  Watford. “We all see the game differently but there are pillars that underpin
  performance and hard work has to be one of those,” Hughes says, referencing
  positive conversations with the Newport chairman, Huw Jenkins, who completed
  his takeover 18 months ago. “Success will look different for us compared to
  other teams. We’re aware of the constraints we’re under, but those constraints
  are definitely not excuses,” Hughes says. “We know it’s going to be tough, we
  know there’s going to be some turbulence along the way. But, most importantly,
  we’re going to enjoy it.”
