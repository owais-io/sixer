  When Kash Patel, the FBI director, faced senators during his confirmation
  hearings on 30 January, he bristled at suggestions that his 2023 book
  contained an “enemies list”. The appendix to Government Gangsters, which
  included a list of names for around 60 people, was simply documentation of
  those who had “weaponized” the government, he insisted. Seven months later,
  that denial appears increasingly hollow. Friday’s FBI search of the former
  national security adviser John Bolton’s home and office, reportedly to find
  classified documents, marks the fifth investigation targeting people from
  Patel’s book. Bolton now joins a growing list of Trump critics from Patel’s
  roll the administration has targeted with what appear to be retaliatory
  federal investigations: James Comey, the former FBI director, John Brennan,
  the former CIA director, Miles Taylor, the ex-homeland security official and
  Lt Col Alexander Vindman. All five people, investigated in just seven months,
  were on Patel’s 60-name list. Typically, federal prosecutors open cases based
  on tips, evidence or ongoing criminal activity. They don’t work their way
  through the index of a political book. While there is no public evidence that
  the book itself or any outside group is directing investigations, the overlap
  appears more than coincidence. The Biden justice department definitively
  closed both civil and criminal proceedings against Bolton in 2021 over his
  memoir about his time in the Trump White House. Bringing that investigation
  back to life requires a deliberate decision to re-litigate an already settled
  matter. Bolton’s investigation, like those into the other four on Patel’s
  list, is unprecedented in how it is calculated to target a critic. The justice
  department acknowledged opening criminal investigations into Comey and Brennan
  over their 2016-2017 Russia investigation roles. Taylor faced presidential
  orders revoking his security clearance and demanding investigations into his
  anonymous anti-Trump writings. The DC interim US attorney pressed
  representative Eugene Vindman for business records tied to Ukraine aid,
  targeting the twin brother of Alexander Vindman, who testified against Trump
  during his first impeachment. When asked for details about the raids and the
  reasoning behind them, a spokesperson for the FBI did not answer directly.
  “The FBI is conducting court authorized activity in the area,” the
  spokesperson said in a statement. “There is no threat to public safety. We
  have no further comment.” The systematic nature of these investigations
  exposes the fundamental contradiction in the administration’s approach.
  Officials claim to be combating the “weaponization” of justice while at the
  same time weaponizing it against a pre-compiled list of critics. Notably,
  Patel’s targets are both “deep state” bureaucrats and former Trump allies.
  Along with Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton, they include Trump’s
  own former officials like the former defense secretary Mark Esper and
  Stephanie Grisham, the press secretary, a suggestion that the list features
  anyone who crossed or flipped on the president, regardless of their previous
  loyalty. Patel on Friday morning posted on social media that “NO ONE is above
  the law”. Trump’s reaction to the Bolton investigation undermines claims of
  prosecutorial independence. Asked about the raids, the president claimed
  ignorance while launching familiar attacks: Bolton was “sort of a lowlife” and
  “could be a very unpatriotic guy – we’re going to find out”, he told reporters
  on Friday. By systematically investigating critics while claiming to restore
  justice department integrity, the administration is creating an environment in
  which political opposition becomes presumed as evidence of criminal behavior.
  This marks another example of evolution from Trump’s first term, when efforts
  to weaponize federal law enforcement were often chaotic and ultimately
  unsuccessful. The current approach appears more disciplined, with Patel’s book
  providing targets and Bondi’s working group providing bureaucratic cover.
