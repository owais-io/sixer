  Hello and welcome to The Long Wave. I’m Eromo Egbejule, the Guardian’s west
  Africa correspondent. This week, I spoke to Tems about her latest project: the
  Nigerian singer-songwriter and producer has been helping African women
  overcome many hurdles in the music industry. ‘The future of African music is
  female and connected’ In February, the singer Tems won the second of her two
  Grammy awards for the single Love Me Jeje, a milestone that made her arguably
  the most successful Nigerian woman in music since Sade Adu. “Dear God, thank
  you so much for putting me on this stage,” Tems said, flanked by her mother
  and members of her team. It was yet another win for the rising talent since
  her breakthrough five years ago on the track Essence with fellow Nigerian
  superstar Wizkid. As a newcomer in Nigeria’s music industry, Tems, born
  Temilade Openiyi, faced many challenges. Unable to afford beats for her songs,
  only a handful of people believed in her vision in those early days. Today,
  the 30-year-old is a household name, collaborating with megastars such as
  Beyoncé and Drake. She has also performed at festivals and on stages that many
  of her peers still covet – the 2023 NBA All-Star Game half-time show,
  Coachella in 2024, and at this summer’s Fifa Club World Cup final. Succeeding
  as a musician in Africa remains a tough endeavour and only a few make it to
  stardom. On that slope to success are many barriers, including lack of funding
  and infrastructure, that are even further compounded for women who
  additionally face misogyny. “There are some people who I looked up to in the
  industry but, surprisingly, they also wanted sex,” the singer Yemi Alade said
  in an interview in 2016. The Beninese-French singer Angélique Kidjo has also
  spoken of people discouraging her from playing the drums, with one person
  insisting “drums are not made for women to play”. Tems told the Guardian:
  “When I first started gaining a platform, it was incredibly empowering to have
  women I admired, like Rihanna, Adele and Beyoncé, connect with my music. Their
  recognition validated my journey and, in some cases, led to opportunities to
  collaborate. Now, I want to give other women that same platform.” This is why,
  in early August, Tems assembled 20 of her countrywomen in the industry to help
  them forge their own paths to success. *** Tackling imbalances Tems’s
  initiative isn’t the only one tackling these imbalances head-on. The
  Lagos-based nonprofit Audio Girl Africa, which describes itself as a
  “pan-African sisterhood building the future”, holds workshops and mentors
  female artists, A&amp;Rs, marketers, and other music business professionals.
  In Nairobi, the Santuri Electronic Music Academy, founded in 2021, has trained
  dozens of female producers and engineers. At the continental policy level, the
  African Union’s Afri’Talent cohort, launched in December in Ethiopia, supports
  women and youth in the arts, including music, as part of a drive to unlock
  $100bn for African creatives by 2030. Until now, no programme on this scale
  had been backed by an artist of Tems’s standing. The first edition of the
  singer’s Leading Vibe Initiative (LVI) was held in Lagos, Nigeria, this month
  to position African women as decision-makers and creators, not just performers
  or content add-ons. She and a roll call of stars were on the speaker roster,
  including the veteran rapper Sasha P, vocal coach Joyce Olong and
  producer-songwriter Bloody Civilian, who counts Black Panther: Wakanda Forever
  among her numerous production credits. “I wanted to spotlight the incredible
  women across the Nigerian music industry who have navigated their careers on
  their own terms … I wanted participants to hear from people with first-hand
  experience who could truly empathise with the struggles,” Tems told the
  Guardian. At LVI, there were workshops and masterclasses on long-term strategy
  and creative autonomy from industry-renowned A&amp;Rs and executives at the
  Africa divisions of Sony and Universal Music. Participants also got to use
  iZotope, audio software created for the programme, to boost their technical
  skills. “For many women, breaking through means having to work twice as hard
  to be taken seriously, while also shouldering expectations around how they
  should look, sound, or present themselves,” said Lola Ige, the head of
  marketing at Sony Music West Africa, who moderated a panel on image and team
  building. Pearl Ehanire, who attended the masterclasses and other sessions,
  said she came away not just with the right software but with renewed
  confidence and new collaborators. “One of the biggest challenges I’ve faced in
  my music journey is access, particularly to knowledge, mentorship, and the
  right gear … [Now] I feel so much more confident in my journey as a music
  producer,” Ehanire said. “I’ve also been able to connect with so many amazing
  female creatives in the industry … I’m unimaginably grateful for the
  experience.” Plans are under way to hold a second edition in Nairobi, Kenya in
  the coming weeks, and elsewhere around the world. And hopes are rising across
  the continent that the initiative becomes another catalyst for inclusivity in
  the creative sector. “The future of African music is female and connected,”
  the radio host and songwriter Klaire Onyeka, another participant, wrote on
  Instagram. “[I’m] excited to be part of such a purposeful community.” • To
