  Royal Mail has made a profit for the first time in three years, its owner said
  in its first results since its £3.6bn takeover by the Czech billionaire Daniel
  Křetínský. International Distribution Services (IDS), which owns Royal Mail,
  said the postal service made a pre-tax profit of £194m in its financial year
  ended in March, up from a loss of £143m last year, as parcel volumes
  increased. The IDS chief executive, Martin Seidenberg, said it had been a
  “year of change” for the group. The return to profit comes a year after Royal
  Mail’s parent company agreed to a takeover by EP Group, which is controlled by
  Křetínský. The group completed a drawn-out £3.6bn takeover of IDS in April
  after a UK government review under national security laws. Křetínský owns a
  collection of businesses including energy assets, and stakes in Sainsbury’s
  and the football club West Ham United. However, despite its improved financial
  performance, last month Royal Mail said it had missed its targets by
  delivering 75.9% of first class mail within one working day of collection. It
  is well behind the 93% target set by the regulator, Ofcom. Ofcom recently gave
  Royal Mail the green light to drop Saturday deliveries of second-class
  letters, and to provide services on alternate weekdays from Monday to Friday
  rather than every day as it attempts to cut costs and make the service more
  reliable. The regulator also lowered targets for first-class post to be
  delivered the next day from 93% to 90%, and for second-class within three days
  from 98.5% to 95%. The changes take effect from next April. IDS said it had
  started “detailed work” before changes to second-class deliveries. It added it
  would continue to invest in postal lockers, with the company increasing its
  out-of-home locations by almost 70% to about 24,000. “Thanks to the hard work
  of our people and our investment in transformation, Royal Mail returned to
  profit for the first time in three years, marking an important milestone in
  the company’s turnaround,” Seidenberg said. “With IDS’s acquisition by EP
  Group complete and universal service reform decided, now is the time for us to
  drive the business forward and capitalise on our momentum.” The group also
  reported that its parcel delivery business GLS made an adjusted operating
  profit of £286m, down £34m compared with the year prior, which it blamed on “a
  challenging macroeconomic and regulatory environment in Germany and Italy and
  foreign exchange movements”.
