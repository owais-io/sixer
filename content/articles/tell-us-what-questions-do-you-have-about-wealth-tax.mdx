  By now, ‘tax the rich’ is a familiar slogan. And it makes sense, a tax on the
  growth in extreme wealth held by individuals and corporations in the UK could
  generate significant funds. One study suggests a global levy on the top 0.5%
  could raise about $2.1tn – roughly 7% of national budgets – with the UK alone
  bringing in around $31bn a year. That revenue could be transformative if used
  to fund the NHS, education, affordable housing, climate resilience, and
  long-term care. So why hasn’t it happened? In a new video series on our It’s
  Complicated YouTube channel, we’re on a mission to untangle confusing everyday
  topics by speaking directly with experts and asking the questions people
  actually have. In an upcoming episode, we’re turning our attention to wealth
  tax. We want to hear from you. What have you always wondered about the
  inequalities in our tax system? Maybe you’re confused why governments are
  often reluctant to impose a wealth tax, or why wealthy individuals and
  corporations are paying a smaller proportion of their income in tax than most
  teachers and nurses, or why the poorest 10% of households in the UK pay more
  of their income in tax than the richest 10%? If you’re having trouble using
