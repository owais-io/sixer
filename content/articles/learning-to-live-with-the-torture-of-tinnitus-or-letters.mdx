  One night, I heard a dripping tap. I asked my husband to check all the taps –
  upstairs bathroom, downstairs toilet, the kitchen. He assured me there were no
  dripping taps. He refused to check again. We argued. I checked. I desperately
  wanted to find the source of the noise. Nothing. What was that sound? Where
  was it coming from? I tried to ignore it. Then I was told. My husband, a GP,
  explained – calmly, with all the understanding he could muster – that I had
  tinnitus, like Lara Williams (A moment that changed me: on the day of my first
  book deal, a mysterious hum overcame me, 6 August). How did I get it? Where
  had it come from? He couldn’t tell me. “It just comes,” he said. I hated him.
  I didn’t sleep at all that night, nor the night after. The noise was
  unbearable. On the third night, I remember standing on the landing, crying. I
  was filled with rage. Then my son, David, came to the rescue. He put his
  headphones on my head, and a beautiful sound replaced the racket in my ears.
  It was How Deep Is Your Love by the Bee Gees. Tears still streamed down, but I
  began to feel a sense of calm. I stopped hearing the awful noise. I listened
  to the Bee Gees, Puccini and Chopin. I listened myself to sleep. I taught
  myself relaxation techniques. But when the noise becomes unbearable, then I
  need all my techniques – music, poetry etc – to calm down and ignore the
  falling bombs, the dripping tap, the loud drums. It’s hard. But I can do it.
  And I want to tell people who suffer from this terrible condition: accept it.
  Forget the anger. Don’t ask why. Don’t think you’ve been punished. You
  haven’t. Just learn to cope with it as best as you can. Maria Ursi Amesbury
  Bristol • I have suffered with tinnitus for nearly 10 years, following an
  incident of uncontrolled loud music in a badly run venue. The resulting damage
  ended my musical performance and teaching career, and left me in a state of
  grief that will be with me until the day I die. While it is true to say that
  habituation does occur in time, it is no substitute for not damaging one’s
  hearing in the first place. Even though I am as habituated as I can ever
  expect to be, the tinnitus still dominates my life and activities. It impairs
  my sleep, and makes socialising difficult and listening to or making music
  impossible. I urge gig-goers, venues and musicians to take great care, because
  to wake up one day and realise that irreparable damage has been done to such a
  precious part of being human is devastating yet avoidable. I also encourage
  anyone affected to visit the Tinnitus UK website. Sue Parish Lancaster • Why
  has there been virtually no progress on “fixing” tinnitus? Lara Williams
  elucidates the desperation we all go through when acute tinnitus sets in. Her
  “acceptance” of the sensory handicap as the only path to coping with the
  condition mirrors my experience. However, that doesn’t always work. Other
  anxieties can derail our blocking. Then we have to build up the resilience all
  over again. It can be an exhausting process. Paul Woodin Hitchin,
  Hertfordshire • Tinnitus is exhausting, painful and isolating. At my first
  self‑help group, a gentle old lady told me she heard it as the angels urging
  her to carry on. Mine sounded more like a wasp trapped in a tin mug – but
  perhaps Lara Williams might find the angels version comforting? Ian Garner
  Oxenhope, West Yorkshire • I read with empathy Lara Williams’ article
  describing the onset of tinnitus. Sudden onset in adulthood must be very
  distressing. In my case it has been lifelong (I’m 76), and I only gradually
  became aware of it in my youth. She describes hearing something between an
  electronic hiss and the roar of the ocean; my symptoms are similar. I don’t
  remember a specific onset, except that in adolescence I once or twice asked if
  anyone else heard high-pitched sounds from the TV and no one did. I didn’t
  have access to the kind of professional help Williams consulted, but seemingly
  came to the same conclusion. It’s there, part of me that isn’t going away;
  fighting against myself is futile. Letting go of the idea that this is
  something that shouldn’t be happening works better. Should and shouldn’t have
  nothing to do with it. It just is. Williams’ analogy to snowfall is beautiful
  and illuminating. Paying full attention to the moment or engaging fully in
  activity helps to simply not notice the tinnitus, or at least not as much,
  depending on the perceived volume at the time. Or maybe, sometimes, it’s just
  forgetting to hear the tinnitus while listening to the silence. Bryan T Davis
