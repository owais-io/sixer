  When Cleonie Quayle’s daughter became addicted to ice and was incarcerated,
  her grandchildren were placed in her care and she had to stop full-time work.
  “I had to rethink my life,” she said. “I’ve always made things, and I thought,
  ‘Oh, well, I’ll make jewellery.’” She started selling earrings at markets and
  eventually developed her own business. On Wednesday evening, the Malyangapa
  Barkindji woman won a National Indigenous fashion award (Nifa) for her first
  piece of clothing: a dress made from hundreds of gold-tipped jacaranda seed
  pods, inspired by the resilience and recovery journey of her daughter, Chloe –
  AKA rapper Barkaa. Quayle was one of many First Nations artists and designers
  celebrated as part of the awards, across seven categories including fashion,
  traditional adornment and textile design. Quayle won this year’s wearable art
  award, with a $5,000 cash prize. Accepting the award with her daughter by her
  side, in a ceremony at Darwin’s Deckchair cinema, Quayle was moved to tears –
  and then laughter. “I’m really blessed to have such an amazing model to work
  with,” she said. Quayle’s dress, which she estimated took three months of work
  – including gathering seed pods with her daughter from streets and car parks
  in western Sydney – was originally made for Barkaa’s video clip We Up, an
  anthem of female empowerment. The night before the Nifa ceremony, the rapper
  wore a different version of her mum’s piece – a top – while performing her hit
  King Brown on the runway of Darwin Aboriginal art fair’s First Nations fashion
  showcase, Country to Couture. Quayle watched proudly from the front row. Sign
  up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every
  Saturday morning Quayle said the jacaranda seed pod was chosen as a symbol of
  her daughter’s journey. Incarcerated in Emu Plains correctional centre while
  she was pregnant, Chloe hoped to be admitted to a centre for mothers and
  babies called Jacaranda Cottage, but was denied; instead, Quayle took care of
  her grandson while her daughter was in custody. “Chloe decided there and then
  that she wasn’t going to go back to that life. She was going to be with her
  babies,” Quayle said in a prerecorded video played at the ceremony. “So that’s
  the symbolicness of the dress: it’s jacaranda for Jacaranda Cottage, and it’s
  gold, you know, to be about her empowerment. The blackness coz we’re
  blackfellas.” Speaking to Guardian Australia after the ceremony, Barkaa said:
  “I’m so proud to call this woman my mother. The reason why I got clean, and
  the reason why I found recovery and the reason why I believed in myself and
  thought I could create my own business, was because of my mother. “She’s won
  law awards and worked in law and family and criminology, but it’s beautiful to
  see her come back to what she loves, and something that she puts her whole
  heart into and that makes her happy.” The Nifas, run by Indigenous Fashion
  Projects in conjunction with the Darwin Aboriginal Art Fair, are now in their
  sixth year. Clair Helen Parker, winner of this year’s fashion designer award,
  said it was a timely boost of confidence after more than a decade of hard
  work. “Sometimes you’re doing it for so long and you just feel like, ‘Am I
  going anywhere?’ Those self-doubt thoughts that come through. And so winning
  this award just kind of gave me that push and said, ‘Oh, you are doing the
  right thing.’” Since graduating from Whitehouse Institute of Design in Sydney
  in 2016 as its first Aboriginal female graduate, the Tiwi woman has created
  gowns for the Logies and Oscars red carpets, presented collections at
  Australian fashion week, and in 2024 created her first online capsule. She did
  most of it alone, a one-woman operation. “I do everything – I reply to all the
  emails, I pack everything, I do it all,” Parker said. “Sometimes I almost felt
  like giving up, and now I’m going to put my award on the wall in front of my
  sewing [machine] and it’s just gonna drive my motivation.” Parker draws design
  inspiration from Larrakia country (Darwin), where she was raised. “When we had
  sad times, we’d always go out into the bush and spend time with family, and
  that would give us a lot – I guess it would help our mental health,” she said.
  “So I kind of want to emulate that in my designs.” 2025 National Indigenous
