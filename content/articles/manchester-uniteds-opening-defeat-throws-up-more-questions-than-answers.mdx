  Points the whole point? A great appeal of football is the myriad pub and
  parlour opinions any game conjures. In the wake of Manchester United’s 1-0
  defeat against Arsenal on Sunday, social media lit-up with differing takes
  from those of a United persuasion. The case for optimism featured United’s 22
  shots to Arsenal’s eight and the beginnings of what may flower into an
  on-field bromance between Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. The case for
  pessimism: a crisis at No 1, with Altay Bayindir’s timidness leading to
  Riccardo Calafiori’s winner and André Onana’s ongoing flakiness. Then there is
  the bottom line: United were defeated. As midfielder Casemiro said afterwards:
  “I’m not going to say that losing is OK; we have to win. Manchester United
  always has to win. I think we have shown good moments, and we have played much
  better, but we have to look for the victory.” Everything but the goal Within a
  few seconds of the game on Sunday, Mbeumo charged down the right wing and then
  picked out Cunha after hearing the yells of his fellow No 10. Here, then, was
  a glimpse of how the new boys may gel beyond the weekend, which would have
  been heartening to see for all United fans. Mbeumo’s skillset features a
  killer touch, a cut-throat running ability, a calibrated pass radar and an eye
  for a shot. Cunha has the same abilities as well as a tendency to purr past
  opponents, as he did in one game-breaking run during the first half. And
  operating as a No 9, the Brazilian also showed he can be a differing option in
  that position to Benjamin Sesko. Yet neither Mbeumo or Cunha scored, spurning
  a slew of chances. This has to be fixed. Sesko needs fast start Sesko arrived
  at Old Trafford on a £73.7m ticket of being a tall, awkward, skilful, fast No
  9 and, in a 25-minute debut on Sunday after coming on as a substitute, the
  Slovenian offered glimpses of those traits. But, as is the case with Mbeumo
  and Cunha, the heat is on the 22-year-old to tear up defences and stick the
  ball in the net. United managed a paltry 44 Premier League goals last season
  and if Ruben Amorim cannot get more out of his newly-established attack then
  the head coach will be the latest to have his career sucked into an Old
  Trafford-shaped black hole. Sesko needs to start at Fulham on Sunday and be
  allowed to show he has what it takes to lead the line for Amorim’s side.
  Managing expectations All No 1s are a few bad games away from pressure but in
  the fevered hothouse of United, scrutiny is a 24-7 occupation. Amorim has
  spent £200m-plus on Mbeumo, Cunha and Sesko, is in the market for a new No 6
  and goalkeeper, and has had since early November to implement his ideas. Oh,
  and there is no European football, meaning more time on the training ground.
  What, then, is a reasonable expectation from Amorim’s United this season? No
  one should expect them to mount a top-four challenge, but a return to
  continental competition seems a reasonable expectation via an upturn in
  performance, meaning discernible patterns of attractive and controlled
  front-foot play. The United results graph for last season read 11 wins and 18
  defeats for 42 points, and a goal difference of -10 and a 15th-place finish.
  This has to be reversed. Six appeal Amorim continuing to select Casemiro ahead
  of Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo is a red flag regarding the weakness of
  United’s midfield department. The player, himself, is content. “I am very
  happy here,” he told manutd.com. “My family is happy here. I enjoy every day
  at Carrington [the training base] and at Old Trafford. If people talk from the
  outside, that’s fine, it doesn’t interest me. I just want to focus on
  winning.” To have a man with five Champions Leagues on the CV is a boon for
  Amorim as he aims to pull off what proved a sisyphean task for David Moyes,
  Louis van Gaal, José Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjær and Erik ten Hag: to make
  United great again. And if a No 6 can be recruited before the close of the
  transfer window, then Casemiro can be eased back to the bench where his
  experience and professionalism can continue to influence teammates.
