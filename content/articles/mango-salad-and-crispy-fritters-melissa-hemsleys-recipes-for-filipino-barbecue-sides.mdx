  My mum is from Manila in the Philippines, but has spent more of her life in
  the UK. When I’m sad, stressed or out of sorts, it’s my mum’s Filipino food
  that I crave. As a whole, Filipino food has sometimes unfairly had a
  reputation for being overly sweet, overly meaty and deep-fried, but with more
  than 7,000 islands rich in culinary traditions, there are, of course,
  thousands of dishes to enjoy. Bringing it back to the UK, though, when we dust
  off the barbecue, picnic blankets and cool bags, there’s nothing better than
  incorporating these sweet, sour, spicy and salty flavours for parties (or
  fiestas as they’re called in the Philippines). And if you’re after a sweet,
  refreshing treat, look out for ube ice-cream, which is gaining popularity in
  UK. Ube is a sweet purple yam native to the Philippines. Sweet potato fritters
  with red onion and sweet chilli dipping vinegar (pictured top) My mum didn’t
  teach me how to cook so much as how not to waste, which is why fritters are
  something we make weekly to use up any leftover veg. My daughter adores sweet
  potato, but this would also be delicious with carrot and potato. The dipping
  vinegar is something we make in a big batch and use all week to brighten up
  leftovers such as fried rice, or to dress cabbage slaw or chicken salad. Prep
  15 min Cook 30 min Makes 20 small fritters For the fritters 400g sweet potato,
  unpeeled and grated 2 large eggs 4 tbsp flour – I used buckwheat, but plain
  flour works, too 1 medium red onion, peeled and finely diced Sea salt and
  black pepper Coconut oil or avocado oil, for frying For the dipping sauce 1
  small red onion, peeled and finely diced 2 tbsp maple syrup 6 tbsp apple cider
  vinegar 2 tbsp fish sauce, or vegan fish sauce 1 red chilli, deseeded and
  sliced in rings or half-moons In a bowl, mix the sweet potato, eggs, flour,
  red onion and some seasoning, then set aside for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, make
  the dipping sauce by combining all the ingredients in a second bowl. Put a
  tablespoon of oil in a large frying pan on a medium-high heat, then drop in a
  little of the sweet potato batter and taste it for seasoning. Working in
  batches so as not to overcrowd the pan, drop two tablespoons’ worth of batter
  per fritter into the pan and cook on a medium-high heat for three to five
  minutes, until golden brown. Flip the fritters over (they should turn easily),
  press down on the cooked side with a spatula, then continue frying for another
  few minutes. Transfer the cooked fritters to a large plate lined with kitchen
  paper, then scrape out any bits in the pan so they don’t burn. Repeat with the
  remaining batter. Be sure to space out the fritters when you fry them; if they
  are overcrowded, they might steam rather than go crispy-edged. Serve hot with
  the dipping sauce on the side. Grilled aubergine, mango and tomato salad This
  is inspired by ensalada talong (ensalada meaning salad and talong aubergine).
  I love this salad chunky and on the side of a barbecue or steamed whole fish,
  but I’ve also enjoyed it roughly blitzed as a dip for plantain crisps. Prep 10
  min Cook 25 min Serves 8 1 medium aubergine, or 2 Chinese aubergines 1 ripe
  mango, peeled 2 handfuls cherry tomatoes, or medium tomatoes 1 bunch spring
  onions, trimmed, or 1 small sweet red onion, peeled 1 handful fresh coriander,
  chopped, to garnish For the dressing 2 tsp tamari or soy sauce Juice of 2
  limes 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar 2 tsp maple syrup, or coconut sugar Salt and
  pepper Heat the grill to medium and pierce the aubergine with a fork half a
  dozen times. Grill the aubergine for four to six minutes (depending on its
  thickness), until the skin is charred, then rotate and repeat until it’s
  charred all over. Set aside to cool. Meanwhile, dice the mango, tomatoes and
  spring onions, and mix in a bowl. Add all the dressing ingredients and mix
  again to combine. Once the aubergine is cool enough to handle, halve it
  lengthways and scoop the flesh into the mango bowl. Mix, season to taste, and
  serve garnished with the chopped coriander. Melissa Hemsley is the author of
