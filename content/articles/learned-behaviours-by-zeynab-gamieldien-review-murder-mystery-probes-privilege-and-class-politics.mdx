  Interrogating your privilege can be a divisive, somewhat uncomfortable
  endeavour – but the way it underpins everyday lives makes for great fiction.
  It’s a topic that has been explored via familial relationships in Brit
  Bennett’s The Vanishing Half, through the employer-employee dynamic in Kiley
  Reid’s Such a Fun Age, and in a schoolgirl narrative in Alice Pung’s teen
  novel Laurinda. Australian author Zeynab Gamieldien’s second book, Learned
  Behaviours, also tackles the issue, via a murder mystery: a searing look at
  how the intersections of race, class and gender can affect the trajectory of a
  person’s life, even when they no longer seem consequential. It follows Zaid, a
  prospective barrister who has made considerable efforts to shed his past in a
  diverse outer part of Sydney known to locals as The Area, which he describes
  as a “broad collection of western Sydney suburbs with Canterbury-Bankstown at
  its heart”. He has travelled overseas, lived in London, drives a Mercedes, and
  works a job that sees him socialise with the wealthier and whiter north shore
  and eastern suburbs types on weekends. There he “assume[s] the role of
  informant” on the quirks of his past life; it’s a currency he trades off in
  his new world. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop
  culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning That past comes back
  to him in the form of Amira, the sister of his high school best friend, Hass,
  who killed himself after being arrested for the murder of a female friend in
  their final year of school. Amira has found Hass’s diary and asks Zaid to read
  it, convinced her brother might have been innocent. Her request draws Zaid
  back in time to confront painful memories, make rattling revelations and
  square up to his own role in his friend’s death. Told between his high-school
  past and the present, Learned Behaviours isn’t a typical murder mystery. Fans
  of true crime and meticulously plotted crime fiction might find the ending
  lacks the kind of detail that provides closure; they might even scoff at the
  possibility that the police bungled the investigation so spectacularly. But
  this book is not about a clean finish or plausibility (I could never imagine
  the boys I know from The Area keeping a diary, for example). In it, the
  intricacies of the murder investigation take a back seat to the bigger themes
  of belonging, upward social mobility and wrangling a past that weighs heavy on
  your present – not just in Zaid’s case, but in that of his father, Tapey, who
  is constantly dwelling on the injustices he experienced in District 6 in
  apartheid South Africa. Gamieldien has done an excellent job of interrogating
  privilege without being sententious or didactic. It’s in the cost of Zaid’s
  barrister training, which he feels more than his moneyed colleagues; it’s in
  the bills piling up in his father’s home, and Tapey’s reticence to seek
  compensation for the wrongs done against him; it’s in his sister Iman’s
  struggle to leave an abusive relationship in London and return home with a
  young child in tow. Despite appearances, Zaid knows he has not really “made
  it”; he’s perpetually on the outer edge of his colleagues’ orbit, lacking the
  fancy school connections that are traded for favours in the workplace, and the
  weekends away at coastal second homes. Like Gamieldien’s debut, The Scope of
  Permissibility – which explored the push-pull of faith and desire – Learned
  Behaviours explores social codes and what happens when they are broken. Zaid’s
  inability to swim is a motif, representing how the stark disparity between
  social classes is experienced on even the most mundane levels. Zaid does his
  best to rectify it, and the novel is littered with scenes where he plunges
  himself into bodies of water, hoping for a shift. Early on in the story, Zaid
  realises that “‘making it’ is not synonymous with movement”, and that social
  climbing does not ensure success or belonging. As he ventures back to The Area
  more frequently – to continue visiting his father, yes, but also to spend more
  time with Amira – Zaid begins to recognise that getting out of The Area
  doesn’t mean escaping it. Learned Behaviours is a pacy, compelling and
  immersive narrative that deftly tackles a weighty topic. It’s understated but
  sophisticated, with more than one tragedy at its heart: a murder, yes, but
  also a necessary reminder that some people can “afford missteps … requiring
  only a single step to get back on course”, while others need to tread more
  carefully, or risk being derailed for ever. Learned Behaviours by Zeynab
  Gamieldien is out through Ultimo Press, $34.99
