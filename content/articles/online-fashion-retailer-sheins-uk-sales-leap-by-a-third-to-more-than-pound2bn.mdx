  Shein, the online fast-fashion retailer founded in China, increased sales in
  the UK by about a third to more than £2bn last year, overtaking the British
  rival Boohoo and closing in on Asos. The company, which had been considering a
  £50bn float on the London Stock Exchange but is expected to list in Hong Kong,
  said profits rose 56% to £38.2m last year on which it paid £9.6m corporation
  tax, according to accounts filed at Companies House this week. Shein, which
  sells mainly fashion but has also moved into other products including toys and
  beauty, said it had benefited from the opening of two new offices in King’s
  Cross and Manchester, the launch of a pop-up shop in Liverpool and a Christmas
  bus tour across 12 cities in the UK. The strong trading figures are likely to
  increase pressure on the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, to tackle the “de minimis”
  rule that has underpinned the rise of the fast-growing online specialists
  Shein and Temu. Reeves pledged to review the rule, which allows overseas
  sellers to send goods valued at £135 or less direct to British shoppers
  without paying any customs duty, after criticism by major retail bosses
  including Simon Wolfson at Next and Simon Roberts at Sainsbury’s. Earlier this
  month, Graham Bell, the chief executive of B&amp;Q, said the rule was “killing
  the high street more than anything”. The rapid rise of Shein, which bought the
  Missguided online brand from Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group in 2023, has piled
  pressure on UK online fashion retailers including Asos and Boohoo as well as
  low-price high street specialists such as Primark. Fears of China’s retailers
  and manufacturers dumping goods in the UK have grown since the US in May
  revoked its own de minimis exception for Chinese-made goods, under which
  parcels with a value of less than $800 (£600) shipped to individuals had been
  exempt from import tax. It recently announced plans to scrap the tax break for
  items from all countries later this month. The EU said in February it would
  phase out its exemption on customs duties for low-value parcels. Founded by
  the entrepreneur Chris Xu, Shein is headquartered in Singapore and runs most
  of its operations from China but sells all its goods outside the country and
  has recently begun manufacturing in other countries including Turkey and
  Brazil. The retailer, which has almost trebled the number of its UK employees
  to 91 in the past year, reached a valuation of $100bn in an April 2022
  fundraising round, making it the third-most-valuable startup in the world.
  However, expectations of the valuation have been slashed in the past year amid
  changes to US import rules and concerns about conditions in its supply chain.
  The failure of Shein representatives to reassure a committee of UK MPs at a
  hearing earlier this year that its products did not include cotton produced in
  the Xinjiang region of China, which has been linked to forced Uyghur labour,
  prompted an MP to accuse one of “wilful ignorance”.
