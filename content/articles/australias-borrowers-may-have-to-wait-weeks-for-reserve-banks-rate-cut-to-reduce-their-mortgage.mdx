  reduce their mortgage

  Mortgage rates will slide after the Reserve Bank announced a third interest
  rate cut of the year – but borrowers with some major banks may have to wait
  weeks for relief. Lenders have lined up to reduce their rates by 0.25%, with
  20 banks – including each of the big four – announcing on Tuesday they will
  pass on the cuts but only two of them doing so immediately. The third rate cut
  of the year will deliver a borrower with a $750,000 mortgage a further $111
  off their monthly interest payments, once their lender passes it on, according
  to Canstar. Only two of the banks to announce a cut on Tuesday delivered it
  the same day, leaving many customers waiting until late August for relief.
  Mortgage holders at the four biggest banks are charged an additional $7.5m
  collectively in interest per day when mortgage rates remain 0.25% higher,
  Finder analysis has found. NAB said it would pass on the cut 13 days after the
  RBA’s move, longer than the 10 days it waited to hand down May’s cut. Westpac
  announced it would wait 14 days to pass on the 0.25% cut, while Commonwealth
  Bank and ANZ will wait 10 days, as each did in May. One first home buyer,
  Andrew Giraldi, watched his banks’ interest rate moves after the RBA’s
  announcements and was glad to see his lender, Macquarie, commit to passing on
  the rate cut within three days. “My good mate is still waiting for NAB,” he
  said. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The 28-year-old and his partner, Joanna,
  bought a flat in February with a 6.19% variable rate from Macquarie, which
  will on Friday fall to 5.44%. Each cut has saved them about $130 a month in
  repayments, with all three cuts amounting to nearly $400 saved each month
  compared with February. They have saved nearly $30 a week as Macquarie cuts
  rates within three days instead of 10. The couple made sacrifices to buy a
  home in Ryde, midway between Sydney’s CBD and Parramatta, even selling a car
  Giraldi had saved for and worked on for seven years. “Every dollar makes a
  difference,” Giraldi said. “That $30 could be worth double, triple that in the
  long run. “I think it would take a few quickly passed-down rate cuts to get
  the race car back, but it’s hopefully in my line of sights in the distant
  future.” RBA governor flags further cuts Variable rates have fallen by the
  same amount as the RBA’s cash rate since the beginning of the year, despite
  the delays. Complex systems and high numbers of customers contributed to
  delays in banks passing on interest rate changes, according to Sally Tindall,
  the data insights director at Canstar. “It is a little bit frustrating, for
  their variable-rate customers who really just want that relief as quickly as
  they can get it,” she said. If banks passed Tuesday’s rate cut on in full, the
  average rate for all variable owner-occupier loans would fall from its June
  level of 5.79% to 5.54%. CommBank and Westpac’s lowest variable rates fell to
  5.34%, while about 30 lenders will offer variable rates of 5.25% or lower by
  the end of August, Canstar estimated. Just one bank, Police Credit Union, was
  offering a 4.99% variable rate after the bank’s decision, which it has offered
  since July, though Tindall said more lenders could offer sub-5% variable rates
  by the end of August. “A variable rate that starts with a four is a fantastic
  marketing play, and so you might find that some lenders break that 5% barrier
  in order to attract new business,” she said. It would take one more rate cut
  to see a crowd of banks offer rates as low as 5% and two more for major banks
  to reach that level, Tindall said. The RBA governor on Tuesday flagged two or
  three more rate cuts were on the table if inflation continued to ease.
  Short-term fixed-rate loans have offered even lower rates than variable loans
  since September 2024, with 17 lenders offering a fixed rate under 5% ahead of
  Tuesday’s cut. The month leading up to the RBA’s decision saw 20 banks cut one
  or more of their fixed home-loan rates, Canstar’s database indicated. Low
  fixed rates may not be the best loan but instead a sign of better deals to
  come, according to Richard Brown, owner of Mortgage Choice Epping. “The banks
  are trying to front-run it by reducing their fixed rates … but what that tells
  most borrowers is that the variable rate’s just going to come down even more,”
  he said. CommBank and Westpac data indicates 99% of new loans since late 2024
  have been on variable rates, as borrowers bet on further declines. Easing
  interest rates have seen homebuyer loans rise almost $40bn from January to
  July while investor loans have jumped nearly $20bn, APRA data shows.
