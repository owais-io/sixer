  I’ve noticed that when I find a rare long word in the Guardian’s online game
  Wordiply, I’m no longer cheerfully insulted as “smarty pants”, but offered an
  anaemic “congratulations”. The only reason I played was to be called smarty
  pants. Is it offensive in some way? Have there been complaints? If smarty
  pants has been ruled out, how about another cheerful playground insult:
  “clever clogs”? Go on, cheer us up. Congratulations is as cheering as a damp
  handshake. Martin Harrington Kennington, Oxfordshire • Folklore has it that
  Satan renders blackberries inedible by peeing on them on Michaelmas Day, 29
  September. It looks as if age-related incontinence might be catching up with
  the poor old devil at last (Early ripening of berries in UK shows nature is
  under stress, say experts, 19 August). Richard Elliott Nottingham • Re Steven
  Julians’ concern that nowadays you can’t call a xenophobe a xenophobe
  (Letters, 18 August), perhaps the answer is to emulate the protester against
  Plasticine Action by calling a xenophobe a xylophone. Gwyneth Boswell Norwich
  • Carnival police never could keep the beat so it’s just as well that they are
  now commanded to maintain it (Pity the beat cops now they’re banned from
  dancing at the Notting Hill carnival, 19 August). Paul McGilchrist Cromer,
  Norfolk • I can see a curfew for the over-65s (Letters, 15 August) appealing
  to ministers, but if an exception is not made for Wetherspoon’s visits there
  will be a revolution. Keith Flett (aged 68) Tottenham, London • Have an
  opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today? Please email us your
  letter and it will be considered for publication in our letters section.
