  One afternoon in early March, three days after the disastrous showdown between
  Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House, there was a flurry of
  telephone activity at the Ukrainian embassy in London. JD Vance’s team was on
  the line and wanted to set up a call with Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine’s
  ambassador to the UK and formerly the commander in chief of the army. The US
  vice-president had been instrumental in provoking the confrontation between
  Trump and Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, from his perch on an adjacent sofa.
  Now, Vance and others in Trump’s orbit were apparently sounding out potential
  alternatives to the troublesome Zelenskyy. Vance’s team “tried various
  diplomatic and other channels” to get through to Zaluzhnyi, said one of three
  sources with knowledge of the efforts who spoke with the Guardian. Zaluzhnyi,
  after consultation with Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, refused to take the call.
  The episode was reflective of the political tightrope that Zaluzhnyi has
  walked since Zelenskyy dismissed him as army chief last February and
  dispatched him to London. On the one hand, accustomed to working within a
  strict military hierarchy, Zaluzhnyi remains loyal to the government he
  serves. On the other, many – both at home and abroad – see him as Ukraine’s
  natural next president, and are pushing him to launch a political campaign.
  This account is based on interviews with several people close to Zaluzhnyi, as
  well as political insiders, diplomats and others with direct knowledge of the
  described events. Most requested anonymity, given the sensitivity of the
  topic. Many of the details are being reported for the first time. No election
  is scheduled in Ukraine, with voting legally and technically impossible while
  the country is at war. Even Zelenskyy’s staunchest domestic opponents do not
  support holding a vote now, and since the Oval Office disaster, relations with
  Trump have also improved. Last week, the Ukrainian president was back at the
  White House in a more cordial atmosphere. But everyone in Ukraine knows that
  sooner or later, politics will return. And when that happens, polling suggests
  that Zaluzhnyi, who led the successful repelling of the Russian onslaught at
  the beginning of the war, is the only candidate who would pose a serious
  threat to Zelenskyy. Zaluzhnyi has never publicly declared any political
  ambitions, and declines almost all interview requests. His team carefully
  manages his public appearances in London to avoid events where awkward
  questions could be asked. But there has been a steady flow of political
  pilgrims to the Ukrainian embassy, located in a mansion near Holland Park,
  west London, to offer services, express support or try to divine whether the
  general has plans to run for office. Those visitors have included Ukrainian
  MPs, civil society activists, representatives of wealthy businesspeople and
  even the disgraced former Trump adviser Paul Manafort, who visited Zaluzhnyi
  to pitch his services as a political consultant in any future election
  campaign. Zaluzhnyi turned down the offer. Another frequent visitor has been
  Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy’s powerful chief of staff. In a meeting last
  November, said a knowledgable source, Yermak suggested to Zaluzhnyi that he
  should formally join the president’s political team, to present a united front
  before future elections. Zaluzhnyi declined, but also pledged loyalty, up to a
  point. He promised Yermak he would not criticise Zelenskyy in public while the
  war continued, said the source, and also gave assurances he would not give the
  presidential office any nasty surprises. “If I do decide I want to go into
  politics, you will hear it from me first, privately,” Zaluzhnyi told Yermak.
  So far, Zaluzhnyi has not communicated that message, although there is an
  increasing belief in Kyiv that he is readying a political run. The general is
  coy even privately with close associates about his plans, but many assume he
  is just biding his time before entering the fray. “He has chosen the smartest
  tactic,” said Volodymyr Fesenko, a Kyiv-based political analyst. “He will make
  the final decision only at the last moment, just before elections.” ***
  Zaluzhnyi was 48 when Zelenskyy promoted him to commander in chief in July
  2021, a move which came as a surprise to most of the army top brass, including
  the man himself. “Zaluzhnyi was a bold and ambitious commander, but he was
  also a bit of a goofball, better known for clowning around with his troops
  than disciplining them,” wrote journalist Simon Shuster in his biography of
  Zelenskyy. It was exactly this personable, unconventional streak that appealed
  to Zelenskyy, the former comedian and actor who had sensationally ascended to
  the presidency two years earlier. A few months after Zaluzhnyi’s appointment,
  Russia began massing troops across the border. The Biden administration warned
  publicly that Vladimir Putin could be planning a full-scale invasion of
  Ukraine. In the months between those first US warnings in October 2021 and the
  invasion in February 2022, Zaluzhnyi frequently pushed for more intensive
  preparations for a possible Russian attack. Zelenskyy, however, was unsure the
  invasion scare was real, and felt that even it was, excessive preparation
  would sow panic among the population and could give the Russians the excuse
  they were looking for to invade. At a meeting of Ukraine’s security council on
  22 February, Zaluzhnyi and the then defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, spoke
  in favour of introducing martial law, while Zelenskyy still worried about
  creating panic. In the end, the council voted to adopt lesser measures. Russia
  invaded two days later. These disagreements over the preparations for war,
  which mostly took place in private and were overshadowed by Zelenskyy’s heroic
  stand after the invasion began, could come back into focus if there is indeed
  an electoral battle between the two men. Once the invasion happened, Zelenskyy
  initially left military strategy to his commander, while he focused on
  marshalling international support for Kyiv. Zelenskyy became the international
  symbol of Ukrainian resilience; Zaluzhnyi achieved cult status inside the
  country as a war hero. As the conflict dragged on, however, there was
  increasing tension between the two men. Almost every strategy meeting ended in
  disagreement. There was also a growing uneasiness among the presidential team
  about Zaluzhnyi’s popularity, as shown by secret internal polling. He seemed
  to be developing an untouchable mythical status. By February last year,
  Zelenskyy had had enough. After months of speculation, he dismissed Zaluzhnyi
  and announced he was sending him to London as ambassador, claiming the army
  needed an injection of new ideas. “This is not about names, and even more so,
  not about politics,” the president said, explaining the decision at the time.
  Few believed him. But Zaluzhnyi took his new orders calmly. During a private
  meeting, the two men parted on a warm note, and Zaluzhnyi even posed for a
  photograph with Zelenskyy to prove there was no bad blood. It was the last
  time they had a sit-down meeting. When Zaluzhnyi arrived in London, the
  British establishment realised this new diplomatic relationship would requite
  delicate handling. Many senior officials had become close to Zaluzhnyi and his
  team during the war, but keeping him involved in military planning discussions
  might irritate the Zelenskyy administration, they realised, and show
  disrespect to Oleksandr Syrskyi, Zaluzhnyi’s replacement as army chief. “The
  decision was made that regardless of many warm personal connections, the
  relationship would be reset to a more traditional diplomatic relationship, led
  by the Foreign Office,” said a British defence official. For Zaluzhnyi, who
  had spent the first two years of the war in a prolonged state of
  adrenaline-fulled sleep deprivation, the new life in London was a strange
  transition. He posted selfies with his wife from tube platforms and walks
  along the Thames. The couple even made the occasional trip to the theatre,
  including a pre-Christmas visit to see the play Barcelona, starring Lily
  Collins. The unusually intense security sweep of the building before the
  performance led staff there to assume a member of the royal family would be
  visiting, said a source at the theatre. There was confusion when the secret
  VIP couple arrived and nobody recognised them. Back home, where Zaluzhnyi has
  the second-most recognisable face in the country, photographs from his new
  life have not always gone down well. A moody black-and-white photoshoot for
  Ukrainian Vogue recently launched a slew of sarcastic memes. But Zaluzhnyi has
  also stayed in touch with many army commanders, and follows combat activities
  from secure video screens in his office that beam live footage from the
  battlefield. “Valerii Fedorovych has left the war, but the war has not left
  Valerii Fedorovych,” said an associate, using Zaluzhnyi’s name and patronymic.
  In private conversations, Zaluzhnyi has not confirmed he plans to go into
  politics, but he has allowed himself to speculate on what kind of platform he
  could propose if he does make the decision. Those close to him say he sees
  Israel as a model, despite its current bloody actions in Gaza, viewing it as a
  small country surrounded by enemies and fully focused on defence. He would
  style himself as a tough, wartime leader who would promise “blood, sweat and
  tears” to the Ukrainian people in return for saving the nation, channelling
  Winston Churchill. In one private conversation, he said: “I don’t know if the
  Ukrainian people will be ready for that, ready for these tough policies.” ***
  After Trump humiliated Zelenskyy in the Oval Office in February, the Ukrainian
  president flew to London to strategise with Keir Starmer on how best to mend
  the relationship. The situation looked dire, and some in the US administration
  were openly discussing what mechanisms they might be able to use to replace
  the Ukrainian president. “I don’t know if we can ever work with Zelenskyy
  again,” said the Republican senator Lindsey Graham, publicly suggesting
  Zelenskyy should resign. Soon after, Vance’s office tried to place the call to
  Zaluzhnyi. For Zaluzhnyi, whatever bad blood there was with Zelenskyy, siding
  with the Trump team against his own president was not an option. He met
  Zelenskyy at the airport in London, and posted on his social media channels a
  photograph of the two men shaking hands on his social media channels. “The
  road ahead won’t be easy, but together, we will overcome every challenge,” he
  wrote. It was a demonstrative show of unity at what was one of Ukraine’s
  lowest moments since the start of the full-scale invasion. “A lot of his
  supporters didn’t understand why he did this,” said a source close to
  Zaluzhnyi. “But it was his principled position: Ukraine has been humiliated
  and we have to be united.” This cautiousness has started to frustrate some
  Zelenskyy opponents in Kyiv, who feel Zaluzhnyi offers their best chance of
  political change. “He’s a military guy, he understands taking orders and
  working within a structure, but he doesn’t understand how to go on manoeuvres
  politically,” said a former senior official, who hopes to persuade Zaluzhnyi
  to run. “A real leader should have taken the Vance call, he should be making
  moves. But how to convince him?” Another source, who knows Zaluzhnyi and is
  also a former senior official, said the general would be too wary of internal
  destabilisation to launch a political campaign against Zelenskyy. “I don’t
  believe in the battle of the two Zs, it would be a disaster for the country
  and I don’t think he is ready for that. So I think he would only stand if
  Zelenskyy can be persuaded to step aside,” said the source. Last month,
  Zaluzhnyi arrived in Kyiv, for a six-day summit of Ukrainian ambassadors. The
  envoys listened to speeches from Zelenskyy and military leaders, and visited
  areas close to the frontline in Zaporizhzhia region. For most of the
  diplomats, it was a rare a firsthand taste of the war to take back to their
  host countries. For Zaluzhnyi, it must have been a surreal experience to
  return to the front as part of a diplomatic junket. “He was friendly, but
  cautious,” said another ambassador who was present. “You could see he was wary
  of being too open with people he didn’t know personally; he doesn’t know who
  is on which side.” By chance, the summit meant Zaluzhnyi was in Kyiv during a
  wave of street protests against a government plan to neuter two
  anti-corruption bodies. The rallies spooked Zelenskyy’s team and led to a
  swift U-turn. Some hoped this could be the moment Zaluzhnyi broke publicly
  with Zelenskyy. “A lot of people were waiting for him to say something, but he
  was silent,” said Inna Sovsun, an opposition MP. After the summit, Zaluzhnyi
  stayed on for a week in Kyiv and took numerous meetings with various political
  and civic figures. Rumours swirled that he was finally sounding out members of
  a future political team. Those around him deny the discussions were about
  politics. “He has said many times that while the war is going on, we have to
  work to save the country and not think about elections, and that has not
  changed,” said Oksana Torop, a former BBC journalist now working as a media
  adviser to Zaluzhnyi. “He talks with lots of people about defence and
  security, but this is nothing to do with elections,” she added. Asked whether
  the presidential office views Zaluzhnyi as a political threat, the Zelenskyy
  aide Mykhailo Podolyak said: “Zaluzhnyi is seen by the president as a part of
  the team, as an ambassador in an important country … Anyway, there is no real
  political process at the moment.” What about when those political processes
  restart, whenever that may be? “I’m not ready to say what would happen then,
  and how different people might act,” said Podolyak. “It’s all very
  unpredictable.”
