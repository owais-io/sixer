  On a recent morning, as the late August sun began to beat down, a few dozen
  New Yorkers stood in the shade of one of the nearly 500 trees adorning
  Harlem’s Marcus Garvey Park, worrying a bit about hurting its feelings. We had
  already identified the species – bald cypress – thanks to its feathered leaves
  and “strong pyramidal shape”, measured its trunk’s circumference (17in; 43cm),
  and noted that its roots appeared normal, its leaves were healthy and its
  branches had suffered some damage from improper pruning. But now we were
  tasked with assigning the tree an overall grade – on a scale of “poor” to
  “excellent” – and no one seemed to want to say. “Don’t feel like you’re
  judging the trees,” said Sherlan Greaves, one of the New York City parks
  department staffers leading the training. “You’re doing this for the health of
  the tree.” “Good?” someone offered. “It’s definitely trying its best,” Greaves
  conceded. “It could be better. Between good and fair.” (When I checked back
  later, I saw that the volunteer who was recording our responses had generously
  gone with “good”.) This is the New York City Trees Count, a decennial census
  of the urban forest that makes this concrete jungle livable for 8.5 million
  people. First undertaken in 1995, the tree census has evolved from a low-tech
  effort by volunteers with clipboards and measuring tapes to quantify and
  classify the city’s street trees to 2015’s app-supported production of the
  Tree Map, an interactive database of the city’s approximately 666,000 street
  trees. An additional 150,000 landscaped park trees were added to the map from
  2017 to 2018, and it is these park trees that will be the focus of volunteer
  tree counters in 2025. (The city is actually home to more than 7m trees, but
  those on private property and in Central Park are outside the purview of the
  parks department, and those on the city’s 6,800 acres of forest are not
  included in the individual counts.) This year, the street trees will be
  counted and categorized by ground-level Lidar scanners mounted on cars –
  similar to the tech used by autonomous vehicles – which will provide the parks
  department with detailed scans showing the precise location of trees within
  the city’s busy streetscapes. The parks department considered using the Lidar
  technology to complete the whole project, but the data produced by driving the
  scanners through the parks “wasn’t great”, Jennifer Greenfeld, the deputy
  parks commissioner for environment and planning, said in an interview. Perhaps
  more importantly, she added: “We can’t let people not be part of this.”
  Indeed, the tree census has become something of an obsession for some New
  Yorkers, with certain “supercounter” volunteers logging more than 3,000 trees
  a piece in the last cycle. While none of these esteemed supercounters was
  present at the training event I attended, the attenders were a diverse group
  of tree enthusiasts. These included a New York native who was hoping to one
  day work for the parks department, an archivist and professor of library
  sciences who had taken a day off work to be there – “We’re all librarians
  today, we’re all categorizing,” she told me – and a project manager from
  Greenpoint who proudly displayed her “Citizen Pruner License”, which she had
  earned after completing an 11-hour training course. (The Trees Count has
  served as an important entry point for New Yorkers into caring for the city’s
  green spaces, according to Sam Bishop of Trees New York, the non-profit
  organization that trains Citizen Pruners to supplement the official seven-year
  pruning cycle of the parks department.) That training came in handy once we
  reached the top of the enormous outcrop of Manhattan schist, the sparkly black
  bedrock that erupts so exuberantly out of the ground at various points across
  the island and forms the center of Marcus Garvey Park. We began our survey by
  updating the record of a decidedly thorny honey locust that had been
  inaccurately recorded as a thornless in 2015. Insect holes, dangling branches
  and some strangled roots were duly recorded in the mapping app before we moved
  on to the next dot on the map: a black cherry we identified thanks to its
  distinctive “burnt cornflakes” bark. An ancient and huge tree of heaven –
  trunk circumference 107in – appeared in excellent health, despite the hundreds
  if not thousands of spotted lanternflies that clustered on its trunk in
  patches like an insalubrious arboreal skin rash. A few yards away, all that
  remained in the spot where the Tree Map said a black cherry should be was a
  giant stump, a tangle of girdling roots offering a silent explanation of its
  demise. Why does the city undertake such a laborious process to count its
  trees, instead of relying on technology or sampling? “We think about it every
  time we do it, like: ‘Why are we doing this?’” said Greenfeld. “We manage each
  tree individually and keep records individually, so it is really important for
  us to have a good handle on things individually.” The census offers a
  point-in-time picture of the diversity and health of the city’s trees across
  five boroughs and more than 1,700 parks. The data collected will help inform
  major initiatives of the parks department, including a plan to increase the
  city’s canopy cover from its current 22% to 30% by 2035. Trees, like most
  public goods in New York City, are not evenly distributed, and the census
  should also aid efforts to mitigate the disproportionate “heat burden” placed
  on neighborhoods where residents are more likely to be poor or people of
  color. It also offers a log of the progress the city has already made,
  including in the important task of increasing the diversity of the trees. The
  1995 tree census featured about 70 species of trees; the current map logs 541
  species. “We’ve learned our lessons from many years of different kinds of
  infestations, whether it was early chestnut blight or Dutch elm disease, that
  reliance on too few species makes you vulnerable to different kinds of
  disturbances and storms,” said Greenhold. Honey locusts remain the most common
  street tree in Manhattan and the Bronx, while the London plane, with its
  Pollock-esque bark patterns, dominates Brooklyn and Queens, and the callery
  pear takes the top spot in Staten Island. The London plane was supposedly
  “cherished” by the powerful and influential midcentury urban planner Robert
  Moses, though its reputation for near indestructibility took a hit after
  Hurricane Sandy revealed it to be sensitive to saltwater; the department now
  avoids planting them in areas where increased storm surge is predicted. But
  the city has been able to expand the variety of its trees by changing its
  purchasing practices and dealing directly with nurseries. This allows them to
  acquire trees such as the Kentucky coffeetree – an attractive shade tree that
  is “very resistant to a lot of urban pressures” but looks like a beleaguered
  “Charlie Brown tree” in its early years, Greenfeld said – that would otherwise
  not be commercially viable. I thought about the resilience that comes from
  diversity as our group reconvened at the end of the two-hour event, on another
  day when the US president threatened military action against the residents of
  cities that he baselessly smears as “blood-soaked” dystopias. Here were New
  Yorkers of all ages, ethnicities and walks of life, coming together to learn
  how to do something a bit nerdy and arcane before heading out to do it on our
  own time, for fun and for the common good. As we prepared to go our separate
  ways, a volunteer returned to the group and pulled out her phone to show off
  the Trees Count version of a celebrity spotting: pictures of an enormous Osage
  orange tree with a split trunk twisting skyward above a set of Marcus Garvey’s
  park benches, one of the city’s officially designated “great trees”. Everyone
  gathered around, ooh-ing and aah-ing.
