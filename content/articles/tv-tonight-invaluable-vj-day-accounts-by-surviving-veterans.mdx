  VJ Day 80: We Were There 9pm, BBC Two “We used to be called the forgotten army
  – and it was. They hardly mentioned Burma.” In Europe, the second world war
  may have ended in May 1945, but Japan wouldn’t surrender until August
  (celebrated in London, above). This invaluable documentary hears first-hand
  accounts from surviving veterans – most of them more than 100 years old –
  including former prisoners of war, soldiers who fought in Europe and were
  deployed to India and east Asia, and a woman who worked at Bletchley Park.
  Hollie Richardson George Clarke’s Kitchen v Garden 8pm, Channel 4 This
  slightly baffling series from the Amazing Spaces host features homeowners
  choosing to overhaul the inside or the outside of their properties (but, er,
  Channel 4 will revamp both anyway). First up are Gemma and Scott, who have
  £90,000 to spend, but differing ideas of how to spend it. Hannah J Davies
  Japan’s Master of Restoration 8pm, BBC Four The Mayuyama family are expert
  antique restorers who piece together shattered ceramics – and rarely share
  their secrets. But in the final episode of this peek into the world of Koji
  Mayuyama, AKA the “God Hand”, we see his small team travel to London to help
  fix one piece. HR Destination X 9pm, BBC One It may not have the same grip on
  the country as The Traitors – and can often feel like watching a bunch of
  headless chickens shouting out names of cities (despite them claiming to be
  “really smart, honestly!”) – but this travel game is still good fun. New
  contestants have shaken things up; now, Rob Brydon is making them get to know
  each other a little better to identify the group’s biggest threats. HR The
  Fortune Hotel 9pm, ITV1 Tensions rise and tempers fray as the guests continue
  to search for the hidden £250,000 without drawing suspicion. As one highly
  quotable couple (no spoilers) reasonably surmise: “If we keep the case too
  long, they’re going to know we’re real bad buggers …” Ali Catterall Amsterdam
  Narcos 9pm, Sky Documentaries “The police were more worried about knocking
  somebody off a bicycle than they [were] about selling drugs.” A colourful
  three-part documentary series that speaks to those who were inside Amsterdam’s
  rise to becoming the drug capital of Europe between the 70s and early 00s,
  including “the Godmother”, Thea Moear. HR Live sport Uefa Super Cup football:
  PSG v Tottenham Hotspur 7pm (8pm kick-off), TNT Sports 1. The Champions League
  winners play the Europa League winners in Udine, Italy.
