  Morning everyone. Israel faces more international condemnation this morning
  after an apparent double bombing raid on a Gaza hospital killed at least 20
  people, including some who were reportedly helping rescue people from the
  first attack. The Albanese government will face questions about the ballooning
  use of consultants despite promises to curb spending, the environment minister
  promises a major overhaul of the laws is coming this year, and a Victorian
  couple claim a TikTok ban has robbed them of their income. Australia
  ‘Blindsided’ | A man who lost his wife and two daughters in the 1996 Port
  Arthur massacre has warned that the Shooters party bill brought to the NSW
  parliament to allow more hunting in the state – and backed by the Labor
  government – will weaken national gun controls. Consultant boom | The federal
  government signed contracts worth almost $1bn with consultants last financial
  year – a 48% increase on the previous one – despite committing to slash their
  use. Degree cost | Students will pay $50,000 for arts degrees until at least
  2027, says one university vice-chancellor, despite the Albanese government
  labelling the controversial Morrison-era fees hike as a “failure”. TikTok
  battle | A Victorian couple is suing TikTok after their account was banned
  from the social media platform for allegedly competing in TikTok “live
  battles” against banned users. Environment pledge | A major overhaul of the
  federal environmental protection regime will be put to parliament this year,
  the minister, Murray Watt, has promised, as he warns further delays risk
  causing more environmental destruction and stalled investment. World Kim game
  | Donald Trump said after talks with South Korea’s leader that he wanted to
  meet North Korea’s Kim Jong-un and that he was open to further trade talks
  with Seoul even as he lobbed new criticisms at his ally. Democratic leaders
  across Illinois and Congress are condemning Trump’s reported plans to repeat
  his Washington DC move and send national guard troops to Chicago, denouncing
  what they call an unprecedented abuse of presidential power. Gaza attack |
  Israel bombed the main hospital in southern Gaza on Monday and then struck the
  same spot again as rescuers and journalists rushed to help the wounded,
  killing at least 20 people including five journalists, health officials said.
  The attack appears to fulfil many criteria of a war crime, our correspondent
  writes. Paedophile alarm | Millions of child predators are forming sprawling
  online communities on the dark web using the Tor network, where criminal
  behaviour escalates through the sharing of child sexual abuse material,
  grooming strategies and normalisation of exploitation, experts say. Mayo
  admission | The Mexican drug lord Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, co-founder of the
  Sinaloa cartel and whose life was among those fictionalised in Narcos, has
  admitted US federal racketeering charges as well as running a criminal
  enterprise more than a year after his arrest in Texas. Director’s cut | Woody
  Allen has denied claims that his participation in a Moscow film festival was
  “whitewashing” Russian atrocities, after condemnation of his appearance by
  Ukraine’s ministry of foreign affairs. Full Story Kmart faces legal action in
  Australia over potential forced labour links Nour Haydar speaks to senior
  reporter Ben Doherty about the legal action against Kmart and the warnings
  that Australia could become a dumping ground for products linked to forced
  labour. In-depth Senators David Pocock and Penny Allman-Payne will launch a
  Senate inquiry this week into the Aged Care Act amid concerns the changes to
  home care packages makes people more likely to enter residential care or end
  up in hospital. Kate Lyons hears from elderly people with experience of the
  changes and how some could be forced to choose between dinner or a shower. Not
  the news A show about a disabled rescue bull in regional Victoria sounds quite
  niche viewing. But Patrick Lenton writes today that Cooking For Seamus, in
  which celebrity chefs compete to feed the eponymous creature, is irresistible.
  Sport AFL | The Gold Coast Suns are one win away from clinching a first-ever
  finals appearance. But will they step up or will they bottle it like they did
  against Port at the weekend? Football | It’s the Alexander Isak derby this
  morning (sort of) as Newcastle host Liverpool in the Premier League. Follow it
