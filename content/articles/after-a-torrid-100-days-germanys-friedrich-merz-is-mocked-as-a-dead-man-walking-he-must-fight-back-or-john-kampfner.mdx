  The passing of the 100-day milestone for any world leader usually denotes the
  end of their honeymoon period. Friedrich Merz has not been able to enjoy even
  a single day of grace, beginning with the very moment he was supposed to be
  elected Germany’s chancellor but wasn’t. On 6 May, as Angela Merkel watched
  from the visitors’ balcony, the Bundestag voted and declined to approve its
  new leader. For a few hours, chaos ensued, until the second round of voting
  saw his chancellorship approved, so the swearing in could proceed. It was a
  symbolic act of defiance, and because it was a secret ballot, it wasn’t clear
  how many of the 18 dissenters came from Merz’s Christian Democrats (CDU) or
  from their new coalition partners, the Social Democrats (SPD). But it cast a
  shadow over the new administration from its inception: this is the government
  that nobody wanted – not least its protagonists. This is the verdict of most
  of the media and political class, the so-called Berlin bubble. Barely a day
  passes when Merz isn’t mocked as a dead man walking. He is trying to create a
  form of mainstream conservatism that is at once modernising – dealing with
  Germany’s lamentable embrace of digitisation, tackling bureaucracy, rebuilding
  infrastructure – and more culturally conservative. He is simultaneously
  accused of conceding too much to the left and of being in bed with the far
  right. He is denounced for being both vindictively punitive and emptily
  performative to migrants. This relentless drumbeat of negativity is the German
  equivalent of the dirge of “broken Britain”. Merz’s difficulties do not arise
  from a single source. They partly emanate from the way he is portrayed: the
  starched conservative, thin-skinned and wealthy (an attribute regarded as
  suspect in Germany). Some of this is unfair, some of it is not. He has handled
  himself with far more restraint and aplomb than originally predicted. Not that
  he has received much credit for it. The second problem is structural. To avoid
  political hegemony, every government must be a coalition. It must share power
  between parties but also between the federal centre in Berlin and the 16
  regions. During the first 75 years of the federal republic, compromise was
  regarded as virtuous. Now it is seen as a mark of weakness. Which brings us to
  the present day. Trumpism has come to town, and Germany’s political culture is
  being infected by the same populist impulses as everywhere else. New media
  outlets are blurring the lines between fact and fiction, destroying careers,
  and leading mainstream politicians to behave in new ways. Parliament has
  become more unruly, and in a country that has long been synonymous with
  deliberative politics, MPs and ministers take instantly to social media with
  instant judgments on breaking news. The first battle of the new hyperpolarised
  era was played out less than a month ago, just as parliament was going into
  recess. The issue was the proposed nomination to the constitutional court of
  Frauke Brosius-Gersdorf, a judge who holds more liberal views on abortion than
  is permitted under Germany’s restrictive legislation. She was demonised by the
  press and the political right, leading some spooked CDU MPs to disappear on
  holiday early, to deprive her of the necessary majority. Senior government
  officials pulled the vote at the last minute, rather than face an embarrassing
  defeat. Her decision to withdraw her candidacy last week led to much fury in
  the SPD and soul-searching in Merz’s team. Even some more traditionalist MPs
  appeared to rue the fact that they had been swayed by pressure from the far
  right, and that the coalition had been undermined. This confected scandal
  forms part of a wider strategy by the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) to
  split, weaken and eventually destroy the CDU, thereby becoming the largest
  party by the next election in 2029. Its members are open about their desire to
  make it impossible for Merz’s coalition to govern. To get anything through,
  Merz must agree it with the SPD. This leaves him vulnerable to the rightwing
  drumbeat that he is kowtowing to the “woke left”. This unnerves those on the
  right of the CDU, some of whom are urging Merz to abandon the so-called
  firewall that prohibits cooperation with the AfD. Any such break with this
  rule would give the German far right a potential route back to power for the
  first time since the end of the second world war. Meanwhile, the AfD’s share
  of the vote, according to Germany’s generally reliable pollsters, heads
  inexorably upwards. The party of the far right is on about 24%, three points
  above its already-impressive and alarming election result in March, and only
  two points below that of the CDU. The prospect of the AfD becoming Germany’s
  largest party is a dark scenario, but it is not inevitable. Two factors may
  yet work for the government. The first is the AfD’s tendency for infighting
  and overall incompetence. The other is the personal durability of the chief
  protagonists, Merz and his SPD deputy chancellor and finance minister, Lars
  Klingbeil. Two terms the coalition uses in much of its communications are: die
  politische Mitte (the centre ground) and handlungsfähig (capable of getting on
  with it). They don’t set the pulse racing, but that is deliberate. Merz’s
  approach is not dissimilar to that of Keir Starmer in the face of the threat
  of Reform UK: soldier on and demonstrate to voters that the day-to-day grind
  still matters and hope that it produces rewards. Merz’s ministers point to a
  long list of planned action and legislation, which includes huge investment in
  critical infrastructure and security (the defence ministry now has a
  department called “expansion”), tightening migration and speeding up
  procurement. A scrap with their SPD partners is likely over plans to cut
  welfare, particularly the minimum income guarantee, but some form of
  compromise is expected in the autumn. Both parties will fight hard over the
  detail, if only to reassure their bases that they are sticking to their
  principles. It will be messy, sometimes dramatic, but the coalition may yet
  work. Merz and Klingbeil get on reasonably well – in contrast to the personal
  feuds that were a hallmark of Olaf Scholz’s administration. They know their
  parties may be in the doldrums, but they also know they will suffer even more
  if this government fails to deliver. There is nothing like jeopardy to
  concentrate the mind, not just for 100 days, but for the next four years. John
