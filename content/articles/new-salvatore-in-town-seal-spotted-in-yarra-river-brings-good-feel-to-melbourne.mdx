  New Salvatore in town? Seal spotted in Yarra River brings good feel to
  Melbourne

  Recent sightings of a seal in the Yarra River have sparked excitement among
  Melbourne locals, and revived memories of “Salvatore” from the city’s
  prolonged Covid-19 lockdowns. Zaynab Malik, a resident of inner-city
  Melbourne, said she spotted the seal frolicking near Point Park along the
  River Esplanade in Docklands about 9.30am on Monday. “At first, I thought it
  was a dolphin! Because all I saw was [what looked like] this huge fin. He was
  zooming down the river and disappeared from view in under three minutes. I got
  pretty excited,” Malik told Guardian Australia. “I always thought Salvatore
  stayed around Abbotsford, so it was a lovely surprise to start the day.” Sign
  up: AU Breaking News email Another Melbourne local, Jesse Harrison, spotted
  the seal just after 3pm on the same day, further up the Yarra near Hoddle
  Bridge. “I have never seen him before,” Harrison said. “I wasn’t sure whether
  this was a common occurrence in the Yarra but … after a bit of Googling …
  figured I had probably seen Salvatore.” The name “Salvatore” came to be
  associated with seals seen in Melbourne’s rivers after a large male Australian
  fur seal was rescued when it became entangled in box tape in the Maribyrnong
  River in 2015. Mark Keenan, from Zoos Victoria’s Marine Response Unit, said
  Salvatore the First bore particular deep scars on his neck from that
  entanglement that made him easily identifiable. “We caught that animal and
  brought it into the zoo, removed the entanglement, and released the animal at
  Werribee South,” Keenan said. He was unsure who in the wildlife community
  first called this seal Salvatore, but the name stuck. Salvatore the First was
  regularly seen in Melbourne’s river systems for a couple of years after his
  rescue, getting very strong and fat thanks to being the only large predator in
  the waterways, before disappearing around 2019. The seal that appeared in the
  Yarra during Covid lockdowns was a different individual, but bore many
  similarities to Salvatore the First. Along with inheriting the name of his
  predecessor, Salvatore the Second was also an enormous adult male fur seal.
  Seals are independent foragers and can thrive in rivers where there is little
  competition for food, said Keenan, and there have been unconfirmed reports of
  seals travelling as far up the Yarra as Healesville. “Our biggest concern when
  we see seals in river systems is that obviously they tend to be highly
  populated and there are lots of risk factors that otherwise aren’t necessarily
  present in the ocean, including litter and boat traffic,” Keenan said. Male
  Australian fur seals usually live for about 10 years. The seal seen this week
  is unlikely to be either of the previously observed individuals, but that
  hasn’t stopped people finding joy in Salvatore the Third. Short videos of the
  seal captured by Malik and Harrison this week were reshared by @seally_friend,
  an Instagram account devoted to collating the exploits of Melbourne’s river
  seal. Tessa McDonnell, a Melbourne tattoo artist who began the @seally_friend
  account in 2021, told Guardian Australia she had often wondered whether
  sightings of Salvatore would bring people the same level of elation outside of
  lockdown, but said her inbox had been “going bananas” since resharing the
  videos. “The way people respond to his sighting is amazing,” McDonnell said.
  “When we were all confined to our homes and had little to focus on, the
  magical sighting was the escape everyone needed. Now we all have all shifted
  back into a sense of normalcy, the sighting of the seal perhaps harkens back
  to a time we had all sort of forgotten about, a bright star in a dark time.”
