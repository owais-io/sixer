  Bridget Phillipson: parents must do more about bad behaviour and attendance in
  schools

  Parents and caregivers “need to do more” to reverse post-Covid trends of poor
  attendance and behaviour in schools, the education secretary has said,
  announcing measures to support schools in England before the start of the new
  school year. Bridget Phillipson unveiled a UK government programme on Sunday
  targeting 800 schools attended by about 600,000 pupils, beginning with an
  initial wave of 21 schools that will serve as attendance and behaviour hubs.
  The struggling schools will have access to support from headteachers who have
  tackled the problems successfully in their own schools. The whole programme is
  expected to support 5,000 schools, including intensive support for 500.
  Phillipson said: “I am calling on parents, schools and families to join us in
  playing their part to get children in class and ready to learn for the start
  of the new school term. “We have already made progress with 5m more days in
  school this year, and are backing parents and supporting schools through our
  plan for change. “But we all need to do more, and when it comes to getting
  kids in and behaving – this includes mums, dads and carers too.” Data showed
  seven out of every 30 classroom minutes were lost to disruption, the
  Department for Education (DfE) said in a statement. A survey by the NASUWT
  teaching union this year found four in five of more than 5,800 members felt
  the number of pupils exhibiting violent and abusive behaviour at school had
  increased, and government figures show suspensions and exclusions in England
  rose to a record high in the 2023-24 school year. Overall absence rates
  declined in the autumn of 2024-25 compared with the previous year, but the
  number of “severely absent” pupils – those missing more than 50% of school
  days – increased from 142,000 to 148,000. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,
  Phillipson said she was particularly concerned about white working-class
  children, the demographic group with one of the highest overall absence and
  suspension rates. Newly released statistics from the national behaviour survey
  show that one in 10 white children on free school meals in England were
  suspended in the 2023-24 academic year. It was the highest suspension rate of
  any group except Gypsy, Roma and Traveller pupils, who are far fewer in
  number. Phillipson said: “For far too many white working-class children,
  opportunity is out of reach,” with statistics showing “one in 10 white
  children on free school meals were suspended last year, with suspension rates
  five times higher than their peers”. “These children are swimming upstream
  against a staggering, entrenched class divide that sees them
  disproportionately kicked out of education or not attending in the first
  place.” Persistent school absence or periods of suspension are directly linked
  to quality of life in adulthood: by the age of 24, children who were suspended
  at school were three times as likely as their peers to be on sickness
  benefits, and on average earned £10,000 a year less by the age of 28.
  Phillipson announced two attendance and behaviour ambassadors would support
  the new programme: Tom Bennett, who has previously advised the DfE on
  behaviour, and Jayne Lowe, a former pupil referral unit headteacher. The
  government’s schools white paper, expected to be published in the autumn, will
  set out further plans to tackle bad behaviour.
