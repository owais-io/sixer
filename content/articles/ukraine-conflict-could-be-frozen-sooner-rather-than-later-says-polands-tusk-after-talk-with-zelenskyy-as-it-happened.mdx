  … and on that note, it’s a wrap! The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, told
  reporters after a phone call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy, this morning that the Russian invasion of Ukraine could soon be
  “frozen” (11:16). His comments come as US president Donald Trump’s deadline
  for Russia to move on ending its invasion of Ukraine ends today, with a flurry
  of calls between global leaders as they consult on the next steps (9:56).
  Russian president Vladimir Putin spoke with Belarusian autocratic leader,
  Alexander Lukashenko, China’s Xi Jinping, and India’s Narendra Modi,
  debriefing them on his talks with the US special envoy Steve Witkoff in
  Moscow. Meanwhile, the US was reportedly looking into the logistics of
  organising a Trump-Putin summit next week, sounding the Italian prime
  minister, Giorgia Meloni, out about hosting the talks in Rome (15:26), and
  looking into alternative locations, including Hungary and the United Arab
  Emirates (13:47). In other news, The German government said it would not
  approve any exports of military equipment that could be used in the Gaza Strip
  to Israel, until further notice (12:34). The Israeli government’s latest plans
  for Gaza were also pointedly criticised by a number of other European
  governments, including Finland, the Netherlands, and the UK (12:39). The
  European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said that “the Israeli
  government’s decision to further extend its military operation in Gaza must be
  reconsidered.” And that’s all from me, Jakub Krupa, for today. Have a great
  weekend! If you have any tips, comments or suggestions, email me at
  jakub.krupa@theguardian.com. I am also on Bluesky at @jakubkrupa.bsky.social
  and on X at @jakubkrupa. The Kremlin’s readout of the Modi-Putin call also
  said the pair discussed US special envoy Steve Witkoff’s visit to Moscow, as
  well as trade, economic and investment cooperation. Meanwhile, the Russian
  president, Vladimir Putin, continues his round of calls with other leaders,
  speaking with India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, in the last hour. In a
  social media post, Modi said he spoke with his “friend” Putin and “thanked him
  for sharing the latest developments on Ukraine.” “We also reviewed the
  progress in our bilateral agenda, and reaffirmed our commitment to further
  deepen the India-Russia Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership,” he
  said. “I look forward to hosting President Putin in India later this year,” he
  added. Amid mouting speculations about where Trump and Putin could meet for
  their summit, the Italian press is reporting that US president spoke with the
  Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, sounding her out on hosting the
  meeting in Rome. Corriere della Sera reported that Meloni expressed her
  readiness to host the talks, and the idea was discussed further during a
  meeting of national security advisers. The paper said, however, that Russia
  rejected the suggestion, saying that Italy was “too aligned with Ukraine”. The
  report, also confirmed by La Reppublica, stressed a potential legal problem:
  as Putin is wanted on an international arrest warrant issued by the
  international criminal court, Italy would technically be obliged to arrest him
  the moment he lands there. The Vatican is reportedly also an option, as Pope
  Leo XIV repeatedly offered to host the talks, as did his predecessor, the late
  Pope Francis. Other reports suggested that Hungary and the United Arab
  Emirates are also among other potential locations being considered (13:47).
  Amid a flurry of phone calls today, Russia’s Vladimir Putin also spoke with
  Belarus’s Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarusian state news agency Belta
  reported. Putin has reportedly discussed his meeting with the US special envoy
  Steve Witkoff and the. US proposals for peace talks with Ukraine, according to
  Belta. He also informed the Belarusian president about his plans to meet with
  Trump, it said. The Russian state news agency Tass earlier said Putin had also
  spoken to the leaders of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan and briefed them on talks
  he held this week with Witkoff on the Ukraine war, Reuters noted. Separately,
  the EU has declined to comment on the German decision to halt military exports
  to Israel for use in Gaza, saying: “Decisions on arms sales are a national
  responsibility. We refer you to the German authorities for further details.”
  The EU has been criticised in many quarters for not taking action against
  Israel in the face of starvation and blockades of utilities and aid. Back to
  Gaza for a moment, the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen is
  the latest European leader to join in the condemnation of the Israeli plans
  for Gaza. She said that “the Israeli government’s decision to further extend
  its military operation in Gaza must be reconsidered.” “At the same time, there
  must be the release of all hostages, who are being held in inhumane
  conditions. And humanitarian aid must be given immediate and unhindered access
  to Gaza to deliver what is urgently needed on the ground”. She added: A
  ceasefire is needed now. Meanwhile, a Fox News reporter claimed that Hungary,
  Switzerland, Italy and the United Arab Emirates are being discussed as the
  potential venues for Trump-Putin summit, which could take place “at the end of
  next week”. Jacqui Heinrich, Fox News’s senior White House correspondent,
  reported in a post on X that Russia’s preference was for Hungary, but no
  decisions had been made. She added that the talks could also hit into a
  potential administrative problem, claiming that Ukraine’s Zelenskyy flagged
  that any territorial concessions would require a national referendum in
  Ukraine. Chinese president Xi Jinping held a phone call with Russian president
  Vladimir Putin on Friday, China’s state broadcaster CCTV reported. The pair
  reportedly spoke about Ukraine, with Xi saying that China will continue to
  promote peace talks, and noting that China was glad to see Russia and the US
  maintain contact, Reuters said. “China would like to see Russia and the United
  States maintain contact, improve their relations, and promote a political
  settlement of the Ukraine crisis,” state broadcaster CCTV quoted Xi as telling
  Putin, AFP reported. I will bring you all the latest on European reactions to
  the situation in Gaza here, but for more detailed coverage of the situation in
  the Israel-Gaza war, follow our special live blog: Several European
  governments have criticised the Israeli move this morning, with the UK prime
  minister, Keir Starmer, saying the Israeli government’s decision was “wrong”
  and urging them “to reconsider immediately”. In the last half hour, the Dutch
  government also condemned the latest Israeli plans, with the foreign minister,
  Caspar Veldkamp, saying it was “a wrong move”. “The plan of the Netanyahu
  government to intensify Israeli operations in Gaza is a wrong move. The [Gaza]
  humanitarian situation is catastrophic and demands immediate improvement. This
  decision in no way contributes to this and will also not help to get the
  hostages home,” Veldkamp said in a statement on X. He added: “The Dutch
  government has always been clear: Gaza belongs to the Palestinians. What is
  needed now is a ceasefire, much more humanitarian aid, Hamas releasing all
  hostages and a negotiated solution.” Meanwhile we are getting big news from
  Germany, as the chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has just announced that the German
  government will not approve any exports to Israel of military equipment that
  could be used in the Gaza Strip until further notice. The statement
  acknowledged Israel’s right to “defend itself from Hamas’s terror” and push
  for the release of the hostages and a ceasefire, but warned that “the even
  harsher military action by the Israeli army in the Gaza Strip, approved last
  night … makes it increasingly difficult.” “Under these circumstances, the
  German government will not authorise any exports of military equipment that
  could be used in the Gaza Strip until further notice,” it said. The statement
  stressed the German government’s “deep concern” about “the ongoing suffering
  of the civilian population in the Gaza Strip”, adding that “with the planned
  offensive, the Israeli government bears even greater responsibility than
  before for providing for their needs” by allowing aid deliveries. For what
  it’s worth, the Polish news website Onet reported yesterday, citing diplomatic
  sources, on what it believed were some of the proposals for freezing the
  conflict under discussion. It claimed that the US proposal included: A
  ceasefire, not a peace settlement. De facto recognition of the
  Russian-occupied territories by freezing the issue for 49 or 99 years. Removal
  of most sanctions imposed on Russia, including on energy. Onet claimed that,
  despite repeated Russian demands, the package did not include any provisions
  on blocking Ukraine’s future accession to Nato, or stopping further defensive
  military aid for Ukraine. The Guardian was not able to independently verify
  this report. In his readout from the call with Poland’s Tusk, Zelenskyy was
  notably less specific about the prospects of ending the war, saying only that
  the pair discussed “the available diplomatic opportunities” and stressed that
  “a reliable peace is essential for all”. He added they also discussed plans
  for joint defence production, support for Ukrainians resident in Poland, and
  prospects for Ukraine’s accession to the EU. “Donald and I agreed that the
  first negotiation cluster for Ukraine and Moldova should be opened
  simultaneously. Ukraine and Moldova began this path together and must continue
  along it together,” he said. The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, just told
  reporters that he spoke with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy,
  this morning and believes that the Russian invasion of Ukraine could soon be
  “frozen”. “There are certain signals, I also have an intuition – that perhaps
  a freezing of the conflict – I don’t want to say the end of the war, but a
  freezing of the conflict – could happen sooner rather than later.” He added:
  “There is hope for this. Today is the deadline for the ultimatum. President
  Zelenskyy is very cautious, but still optimistic. The Ukrainian side is very
  keen for Europe, including Poland, to take part in shaping this future
  ceasefire and, later, peace. We are also very keen on this, so that peace can
  prevail in our region, because that would also have a very positive impact on
  our security.” Irregular border crossings into the EU are down 18% in the
  first seven months of the year, but people taking illegal boat journeys across
  the Channel to the UK are up 25%, according to new statistics issued by the
  EU’s border agency. Irregular crossings toward the UK via the Channel rose by
  26% to 41,800 attempts, Frontex said on Friday. It attributed the surge to new
  tactics used by people smugglers. “This increase is attributed to favourable
  weather, the use of harder-to-detect ‘taxi boats’ that pickup people from
  various spots on the coast and more migrants per vessel. Smuggling networks
  remain active and agile, often disregarding migrants’ safety and putting their
  lives in serious danger. One emerging tactic is ‘simultaneous departures,’
  where multiple overcrowded boats launch at once. Many vessels are unseaworthy
  and prone to engine failure, leaving migrants stranded or forced to swim.
  French authorities respond quickly, often with Frontex support. But boats that
  remain afloat continue toward the UK. The average number of people per boat
  has risen to nearly 60, with some carrying almost 100.” Frontex said the
  number of people who entered the bloc through an irregular route fell to
  95,200 from January to August with the majority of primary routes, including
  those across the Mediterranean and those to the Canary Islands from West
  Africa and into eastern Europe through the western Balkans, seeing lower
  numbers. However it said “pressure remains high across all three Mediterranean
  routes.” Crossings on the east of the Mediterranean into Greece were down by
  16% to 26,200. However a new migratory route from Libya into Crete, denounced
  by the Greek prime minister last month, had emerged in recent months with
  around 10,000 crossings so far this year. The route, which in recent years has
  generated most heated political reaction, from Tunisia into Italy, recorded
  36,700 crossings an increase of 9% on 2024. Frontex data suggests smugglers
  have shifted operations with Libya, cited as the main departure point on the
  central Mediterranean route. Smuggling into Spain from Morocco and Algeria was
  up 11% with criminal gangs charging between €900 and €20,000 per journey, said
  Frontex. The West African route saw a drop of 46%, it said. The Finnish
  foreign minister, Elina Valtonen, said in the past hour that she hoped Trump
  will move ahead with sanctions on Russia. Speaking to Reuters this morning,
  she said: “I certainly hope that President Trump will move forward with those
  sanctions. What we do see – and suspect now as well – is that the reason that
  Russia has again shown some willingness to talk, is that the increased arms
  deliveries [to Ukraine] are definitely piling up the pressure on Russia to
  find a way out of the war.” Valtonen also argued that “the only strategy to
  end the war in Ukraine is to keep aiding Ukraine”. The US president Donald
  Trump’s original deadline for Russia to move on ending its invasion of Ukraine
  ends today. Asked if he was ready to follow through on his threats of
  sanctions and secondary tariffs, Trump told reporters last night: It’s going
  to be up to him. We’re going to see what he has to say. He then added he was
  “very disappointed” in Putin, but – in an apparent concession to the Kremlin –
  said he would be ready to meet the Russian leader, regardless of whether he
  meets with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy. That contradicted a New York Post
  report citing a White House official who said that Trump would only meet Putin
  if the Kremlin leader met Zelenskyy, something Putin has previously rejected.
  The Trump-Putin summit could take place as early as next week, with the United
  Arab Emirates floated as a potential place for the meeting. But before that
  happens, will Trump move on sanctions as promised to exert even more pressure
  on Russia? Let’s see. Elsewhere, I will be looking at the EU’s reactions on
  the latest in Israel and Gaza, and keep an eye on Trump’s plans to announce a
  peace deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan. I will bring you all the key
  updates here. It’s Friday 8 August 2025, it’s Jakub Krupa here, and this is
  Europe Live. Good morning.

However it said “pressure remains high across all three Mediterranean routes.” Crossings on the east of the Mediterranean into Greece were down by 16% to 26,200. However a new migratory route from Libya into Crete, denounced by the Greek prime minister last month, had emerged in recent months with around 10,000 crossings so far this year. The route, which in recent years has generated most heated political reaction, from Tunisia into Italy, recorded 36,700 crossings an increase of 9% on 2024. Frontex data suggests smugglers have shifted operations with Libya, cited as the main departure point on the central Mediterranean route. Smuggling into Spain from Morocco and Algeria was up 11% with criminal gangs charging between €900 and €20,000 per journey, said Frontex. The West African route saw a drop of 46%, it said.
