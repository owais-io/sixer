  Adjacent to a municipal government building in Beijing, a normally bustling
  restaurant is now eerily quiet, at lunchtime most of its seats are empty. The
  recent crackdown on civil servants frequenting restaurants – part of a
  government austerity drive intended to crack down on corruption – has likely
  affected business and caused liquor sales to plummet, admits one waitress who
  works in the opulent establishment. In May, China released updated regulations
  aimed at Communist party members and civil servants, banning them from lavish
  banquets and other visible trappings of extravagance. But with more than 40
  million people employed in the public sector, some analysts predict the new
  rules will probably hamper economic growth. The policy is “undermining the
  impact of other policies aimed at boosting domestic spending,” said Guo Shan,
  an economist at Hutong Research, an independent advisory firm based in Beijing
  and Shanghai. Guo predicts the drive could cause China’s retail sales growth
  to slow by around one percentage point in the second half of the year. The
  original guidelines were introduced in November 2013, a year after China’s
  leader, Xi Jinping, came into power, with the goal of cracking down on
  corruption one of his signature policies. The renewed regulations outline more
  specific guidelines on official travel – both domestic and international – as
  well as protocols for hosting receptions and rules governing the use of
  official vehicles. In June, local governments began figuring out how to
  implement the new guidance. Some civil servants in Shandong province have been
  reportedly ordered not to dine out in groups of more than three. Cadres in
  Anhui provinces have been instructed to be wary of social gatherings and to
  refrain from treating bosses or underlings to meals. The renewed push hints
  that previous anti-corruption drives were not completely effective, while the
  latest effort could cast a shadow over the Chinese economy, say analysts. “The
  latest anti-corruption drive will definitely harm the economy,” said Alfred
  Wu, a public policy expert at the National University of Singapore. There have
  already been reports of penalties for civil servants who overindulge. In June,
  two bank employees in Anhui province had their 3,000 yuan (£310) bonuses
  docked for attending a lunch paid for by a client. The lunch in question was a
  bowl of noodles that typically costs around six yuan in the local town. Baijiu
  – China’s national liquor with an alcohol content comparable to vodka – has
  long been a popular choice among Chinese officials. But the spirit has come
  under renewed scrutiny after the recent deaths of three local officials in
  separate provinces, who died of alcohol poisoning. Among the hardest-hit in
  the liquor industry is Kweichow Moutai– one of China’s most iconic and
  valuable brands. Known for its distinctive soy sauce-aroma style of baijiu,
  the brand has long been associated with official banquets. Since the revised
  regulations were introduced in May, the company’s share price has dropped
  nearly 9%, wiping out more than 170 billion yuan in market value by the end of
  July. The intensifying restrictions reflect a broader campaign to regulate the
  daily lives of civil servants. As the government grows increasingly concerned
  about national security, controls that previously only applied to senior
  bureaucrats who might have access to sensitive information, such as
  restrictions on international travel, now seem to be spreading lower down the
  ranks. An online notice circulating on Chinese social media platform Weibo –
  reportedly from Guangdong Province – outlines new requirements for teachers’
  overseas travel, even if they are travelling for their own holidays. It states
  that even junior personnel must now apply for permission for trips abroad,
  specifying that “foreign visits are exclusively for family-related purposes;
  personal leisure travel is not permitted.” In other regions, public sector
  workers must hand in their passports. “I really don’t understand why our
  county won’t allow ordinary teachers to travel abroad. My parents were already
  at the immigration office, but they weren’t allowed to apply for passports,”
  wrote one Weibo user, who said that their parents were teachers. Guo, the
  Hutong Research economist, said that Beijing was likely willing to bear the
  economic pain caused by the austerity policy. “Since this is a political
  drive, economic concerns are secondary. And there are still many other tools
  to boost the economy should Beijing decide to do so,” Guo said.
