  The House oversight committee on Tuesday issued subpoenas to Bill and Hillary
  Clinton as well as several former attorneys general and directors of the FBI,
  demanding “testimony related to horrific crimes perpetrated by Jeffrey
  Epstein”. The investigative committee’s Republican chair, James Comer, sent
  the subpoenas in response to two motions lawmakers approved on a bipartisan
  basis last month, as Congress navigated outrage among Donald Trump’s
  supporters over the justice department’s announcement that it would not
  release further details about Epstein, a disgraced financier who died in 2019
  while awaiting trial for sex trafficking. The subpoenas raise the possibility
  that more details will become public about Trump’s relationship with Epstein,
  which stretched for years but appeared to have petered out by the time Epstein
  was convicted of sexually abusing girls in 2008. Last month, the Wall Street
  Journal reported on the existence of a sexually suggestive sketch and lewd
  letter Trump sent to Epstein as a 50th birthday gift in 2003. The president
  and his allies have long flirted with conspiracy theories around Epstein’s
  death in federal custody, but the justice department upended those by
  concluding he died by suicide and a long-rumored list of his client did not
  exist. That prompted some Trump supporters to criticize the president for
  failing to make good on his pledge to bring full transparency to the case,
  which Democrats moved to capitalize on by pushing congressional Republicans
  into tricky votes intended to make the Epstein case files public. Shortly
  before House lawmakers left Washington DC for Congress’s August recess, the
  Republican congressman Scott Perry won an oversight subcommittee’s approval to
  compel depositions from the Clintons and the former top federal law
  enforcement officials in a bid to reveal more about Epstein’s activities.
  Democratic congresswoman Summer Lee also successfully pushed a motion to
  subpoena justice department files related to the case. In addition to the
  Clintons, the committee sent subpoenas to former attorneys general Jeff
  Sessions, Alberto Gonzales and William Barr, who served in George W Bush and
  Trump’s presidencies, and Merrick Garland, Loretta Lynch and Eric Holder, who
  served under Joe Biden and Barack Obama. Former FBI directors James Comey and
  Robert Mueller also received subpoenas. In the letter to Bill Clinton, Comer
  noted that the former president had flown four times on Epstein’s private jet,
  and repeated an allegation that he had “pressured” Vanity Fair not to publish
  sex trafficking claims regarding Epstein. The chair further says that Clinton
  was “allegedly close” with Ghislaine Maxwell, a British socialite serving a
  20-year prison sentence after being convicted on sex trafficking charges
  related to Epstein. “Given your past relationships with Mr. Epstein and Ms.
  Maxwell, the Committee believes that you have information regarding their
  activities that is relevant to the Committee’s investigation,” Comer wrote. In
  his letter to Hillary Clinton, Comer draws a more tenuous connect, writing:
  “Your family appears to have had a close relationship with both Jeffrey
  Epstein and his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell”. In addition to details
  about them, Comer notes that Clinton “may have knowledge of efforts by the
  federal government to combat international sex trafficking operations of the
  type run by Mr. Epstein”. Comer set Bill Clinton’s deposition date as 14
  October and Hillary’s as 9 October. Others who received subpoenas were given
  dates ranging from mid-August through early October, while US attorney general
  Pam Bondi has until 19 August to release documents related to the case. In
  addition to the subpoenas, Republican congressman Thomas Massie and Democrat
  Ro Khanna are collecting signatures for a discharge petition to force a vote
  on legislation compelling release of the Epstein files. That vote is not
  expected to happen until the House returns from recess in early September.
  Trump has authorized the justice department to request release of the
  transcripts from the federal grand juries that indicted Epstein and Maxwell,
  while last week, deputy attorney general Todd Blanche interviewed Maxwell in
  Florida in what the White House said was a bid to uncover new details about
  the case.
