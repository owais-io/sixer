  The Church of England has apologised unreservedly for its failings over a
  former priest who has been convicted of indecently assaulting young women who
  attended a groundbreaking evangelical church featuring rock music and rave
  culture. Christopher Brain was found guilty on 17 charges of indecent assault
  against women who attended the Nine O’Clock Service in Sheffield between 1986
  and 1995 after a trial that lasted more than seven weeks. The jury found him
  not guilty on a further 15 charges of indecent assault, and was unable to
  reach verdicts on a further four charges of indecent assault and one charge of
  rape. Brain, from Wilmslow, Cheshire, had denied all charges. In a statement,
  Pete Wilcox, the bishop of Sheffield, said: “What happened was an appalling
  abuse of power and leadership that should never have occurred. Where concerns
  were raised in the past and were not acted upon properly, that was a failing
  of the church. For those institutional failures I offer an unreserved
  apology.” He said he was deeply sorry for the harm that those assaulted by
  Brain had suffered, adding that the church was “committed to supporting those
  affected”. The C of E would order an independent review to examine its
  “safeguarding responses, culture and processes so that we can identify where
  lessons can be learned and strengthen best practice for the future”. The trial
  heard that the Nine O’Clock Service (NOS) had “presented itself to the outside
  world as a progressive force for good”. But, prosecutors said, NOS became a
  cult in which Brain abused his position to exert control over the lives of his
  female followers and ostracise them from friends and family. Some victims told
  police they felt “brainwashed” by Brain. The NOS was one of the first churches
  to offer services specifically designed to attract young people, with live
  music and an atmosphere more akin to a nightclub than traditional worship. It
  started at St Thomas’s church in Sheffield in 1986 but later moved to a
  leisure centre to accommodate its growing congregation, which reached up to
  600 people. The Church of England celebrated its success, and hoped its
  innovative model might be replicated in other churches to attract new
  congregations. The Right Rev David Lunn, the then bishop of Sheffield, told
  the BBC the NOS was a “new development in the way we understand the Christian
  religion”. Dazzled by Brain’s apparent star qualities, the C of E fast-tracked
  his ordination as a priest in 1991. The court heard that “large sums of money”
  were spent to obtain robes worn by the actor Robert De Niro in the film The
  Mission for Brain to wear in his ordination ceremony a year later. Young women
  from the NOS congregation were recruited to a “home base team” dedicated to
  looking after Brain, his wife and daughter. The group became known among NOS
  members as the “Lycra lovelies” or the “Lycra nuns” after witnesses reported
  seeing Brain surrounded by women in lingerie and tight clothing at his home,
  said Tim Clark KC, prosecuting. The women carried out household chores and
  some gave the priest massages, the prosecution said. In his evidence, Brain
  told the jury the massages were intended to relieve “tensions” on his body but
  could evolve into consensual “sensual touching”. That, he said, was “no big
  deal”. Brain rejected testimony that he had tried to control people by making
  them wear the same clothing or lose weight, or that he discouraged them from
  maintaining friendships. Brain told the court the women’s clothing was
  “completely normal for that era” and any touching was with “100% consent”. He
  said the NOS was “more like a group of musicians living together” than a
  traditional church, and was a “free, open, really caring, very fun
  environment”. He said in evidence that his “direct Yorkshire style” may have
  been misinterpreted as controlling and abusive. One woman who had been a
  member of the NOS under Brain described him as “a predator” who “picked off
  women he thought were vulnerable”, and that he created a “deeply
  psychologically abusive” atmosphere designed to keep his victims in line. The
  NOS collapsed in 1995 after women alleged they had been sexually abused by
  Brain. The priest admitted “improper sexual conduct with a number of women”
  and resigned his position. Survivors came forward again in 2021. Richard
  Scorer, who represented Brain’s victims, said the case “could and should have
  been prosecuted 30 years ago”. He added: “The C of E must now reckon with its
  role – this high-control religious cult operated on its watch.” He said there
  had been “clear warning signs” about Brain which were not acted upon. The C of
  E’s “failure to act enabled a predator to flourish under the guise of
  spiritual authority,” he added.
