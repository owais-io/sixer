  Robert Jenrick had been migration minister for just a few days in 2022 when he
  gave a broadcast interview that could easily have been given by a minister in
  the current government. “Suella Braverman [the former home secretary] and her
  predecessor, Priti Patel, were procuring more hotels,” he told Sky News. “What
  I have done in my short tenure is ramp that up and procure even more. Because
  November, historically, has been one of the highest months of the year for
  migrants illegally crossing the Channel.” He went on to add: “I would never
  demonise people coming to this country in pursuit of a better life. And I
  understand and appreciate our obligation to refugees.” It was a very different
  Jenrick who showed up in Epping last weekend at the site of prolonged protests
  outside the Bell hotel, which houses asylum seekers. “Great to be with
  peaceful, patriotic protesters in Epping today,” he posted on X. “People are
  right to be fed up of illegal migration. And the crime and billions being
  wasted because of it.” Jenrick’s inflammatory visit to Epping, where he was
  pictured close to a well-known far-right activist, showed why he is – in some
  ways – one of the most effective members of the shadow cabinet, but also the
  political risks of his sometimes controversial public appearances. Supporters
  argue that no one else in the shadow cabinet is so adept at seizing the
  political initiative. They point to his much-discussed recent social media
  videos, including one of him accosting fare dodgers on the London underground,
  as evidence of his success. And they add his appearance in Epping, where not
  even the Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has sought to go, shows he is one of a
  small number of Conservatives able to outmanoeuvre his populist rightwing
  opponents. “It’s incredibly difficult for us to get attention right now,” said
  one Conservative MP. “If all of the shadow cabinet were doing what Jenrick is
  doing, that would be great.” Another said: “There’s much noise around Reform
  right now. Any noise from a Tory perspective is good.” Others, however, are
  accusing him of rank hypocrisy. In an unusual personal attack on a
  Conservative politician, Reform published a series of X posts accusing him of
  having “boasted” about opening more asylum hotels while in government.
  Meanwhile, several Conservatives say they are uneasy about Jenrick’s tactics
  and accuse him of being more interested in lining up a leadership bid than
  helping his party. “It is hard to take him seriously,” said one Tory MP. “The
  reservation is that he’s not Nigel Farage, and he will never be Nigel Farage.”
  Another said: “The challenge for leadership hopefuls like Jenrick is that he
  presided over an immigration policy that increased the use of hotels, which is
  why Reform are now focusing their attacks on him. “We also have the likes of
  [fellow Conservative MPs] Danny Kruger, Nick Timothy and Katie Lam who advised
  successive prime ministers and home secretaries now behaving as though they
  are clean of the past and have the answers. It doesn’t fool anyone.” Jenrick’s
  difficulty in being taken seriously as a rightwing agitator, after years in
  government as a supporter of Rishi Sunak, mirrors the wider challenge facing
  the party in shaking off the legacy of 14 years in power. Record levels of
  legal migration, and tens of thousands of small boat crossings a year, have
  left the Conservatives as the least trusted party on immigration. Many of the
  party’s own MPs are concerned about exactly this. A recent Conservative social
  media post criticising the “freebies and perks” given to asylum seekers
  arriving in the UK was met with scorn by many of its own MPs. On a leaked Tory
  WhatsApp chat, MP Lewis Cocking said: “This makes us look silly as we gave
  them all this too, which is why we are in the mess we are in today.” Rob Ford,
  professor of political science at Manchester University, said: “Going big on
  the issue makes sense on the surface in that salience of it is high and
  Labour’s poll figures are bad too. “But it is and always has been Farage’s
  core issue. So their recent behaviour is very much ‘Nigel is right, don’t vote
  for him.’ “Jenrick showing up at that hotel may work as a campaign image for
  the coming Tory leadership contest but it also makes it more likely that
  whoever wins that contest takes over a ship headed rapidly to the seabed.”
  Some say that by attacking asylum seekers so aggressively, the party risks
  emboldening the far right and undermining the entire idea of granting asylum.
  A recent study published in the British Journal of Political Science found
  attacks by mainstream politicians on migration were far more powerful in
  changing public attitudes towards migrants than ones from the hard-right. The
  researchers found that “statements by mainstream politicians lead to more
  norm-erosion than similar statements by radical-right politicians”. Those
  concerns are shared by some anti-racism campaigners. Lewis Nielsen, a
  spokesperson for Stand Up to Racism, recently said: “Jenrick is fanning the
  flames of the far right by chasing Reform UK votes. He’s giving confidence to
  known fascists.” None of this troubles those close to Jenrick, however, who
  believe that even being pictured at the same rally as a former British
  National Party strategist can be turned to their advantage. “At this stage in
  the game, controversy is good,” said one Jenrick ally. “Making controversy on
  a point where we are saying what the public want us to say is more than a net
  benefit – much more.”
