  death threats and bootlegs

  When the gritty ABC two-parter Blue Murder aired in 1995 it became instantly
  notorious. Police corruption in Sydney was under intense scrutiny and the
  real-life gangster at the heart of the miniseries – Neddy Smith – was
  embroiled in court cases for some of the depicted murders, which meant the
  show was banned in New South Wales for six years. Even withstanding the
  gangland threats they were receiving, the actors knew Blue Murder would be
  huge. For its 30th anniversary, Guardian Australia speaks to some of its
  stars: Richard Roxburgh (as the crooked cop Roger Rogerson), Steve Bastoni
  (drug squad detective Michael Drury), and Lo Carmen (sex worker Sallie-Anne
  Huckstepp) – as well as detective-turned author Duncan McNab, who wrote two
  books about Rogerson’s reign. A love story Initially, one episode focused on
  Smith and the second on Drury. But soon the director, Michael Jenkins – who
  died in 2024 – had other ideas. Steve Bastoni: As we started the rehearsal
  process Jenkins became more intrigued by Rogerson, so Rogerson started to
  emerge as the lead character. From the actor’s vanity point of view, I was
  going: “Well, fucking hang on, this is MY episode.” Richard Roxburgh: Michael
  Jenkins said: “It’s a love story” [something Rogerson later took umbrage at].
  One’s a hitman and [the other’s] one of Australia’s most decorated police
  officers. Michael really loved the waltz of the two men and the strange
  darkness of it. Bastoni: Jenkins had said to me: “What do you think of Richard
  Roxburgh?” and I’d just finished working with him on Police Rescue – he had a
  guestie on it. I said: “Look, I’ve seen him on stage and he’s brilliant, but
  I’ve only seen a little bit of him on screen and I’m not sure that he could do
  it.” But Jenkins could see it. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of
  must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning
  Roxburgh: I believe my part was offered to Bryan Brown and he said no. I was a
  jobbing theatre actor but they took a punt and I started having a lot of
  chocolate milkshakes. We couldn’t afford to do a double chin on the ABC budget
  so I had to make my own. Inside the underworld The screenwriter, Ian David,
  partly based Blue Murder on Smith’s autobiography, Neddy, as well as
  conducting interviews. Episode one opens explosively, with Smith (Tony Martin)
  ambushed by cops then beaten with a phone book by Rogerson. Roxburgh: Tony’s
  an ox. He said: “Mate, just go for it.” There was a lot of trust between us.
  Duncan McNab: Tony’s portrayal of Neddy was extraordinary. He captured the
  coldness, the brutality and the physicality. I was in David Jones and Tony
  Martin’s coming up on an escalator. I did a double take: Fuck, what are you
  doing out of jail? It was utterly disturbing that everyone was captured so
  accurately … [underworld figure] Graham “Abo” Henry has never forgiven Peter
  Phelps [who played him]. His great complaint was not the fact that he was
  portrayed as a sex offender and a drug dealer. It was: “Mate, I’d never go out
  of the house in tracksuit pants.” Much of the action centres around Kings
  Cross in Sydney in the late 70s to mid-80s. Cue the dirty sax soundtrack. Lo
  Carmen: I moved to Kings Cross when I was 12. My dad, from working in piano
  bars and nightclubs, had quite a few dealings with the vice squad and I was
  brought up to know that if anything ever went wrong I should grab a bouncer
  from one of the strip clubs rather than the police. That was 1982 and the
  streets were lined with girls leaning in doorways who were always really sweet
  to me. That’s why I felt a camaraderie with Sallie-Anne, because she may well
  have been one of those girls that would be friendly to me on my way to and
  from school. In 1981 Huckstepp was interviewed by Ray Martin on 60 Minutes
  about Rogerson shooting her heroin dealer boyfriend Warren Lanfranchi,
  exposing the corruption in the NSW force. Carmen: I was given a videotape with
  news footage, a segment of the Ray Martin interview and a bit of a documentary
  that showed her walking in Kings Cross. I did feel in later years that I
  didn’t get as full a picture of her as I would have liked. I think she had a
  bigger sense of humour and was a lot sharper. My respect for her grew
  exponentially until I felt such a sense of injustice for her – that her
  incredible sacrifice in whistleblowing was not more widely recognised. She was
  still thought of in the public eye as having brought it on herself. McNab: It
  all goes back to the extraordinary bravery of Sallie-Anne Huckstepp, and also
  her mate, Lyn Woodward, who was poised to give damaging evidence about
  Rogerson before she disappeared in 1981, presumably murdered. Lyn was one of
  the forgotten heroes of all this. Recreating the truth The series was often
  shot on location – in the houses and places where the crimes had occurred. In
  episode two Drury is shot twice through his kitchen window. Bastoni: I got to
  spend quite a lot of time with Mick. The first thing he did when I went to his
  house, he walked me over to the sink, and he goes: “You want a cup of tea? … I
  got shot through this window.” I felt a big obligation to him. We kept in
  touch for quite a while afterwards. McNab: I was a journalist by the time Blue
  Murder came out but in that murky period it covers I was a detective. I was in
  internal affairs the morning Drury’s dying deposition arrived [it was thought
  Drury wouldn’t survive]. My boss just shook his head and said: “It couldn’t be
  Roger. He’s too good a bloke.” My thoughts at that point were: “Fuck, I’ve got
  to get out of here … but I might take a copy of the deposition when no one’s
  looking.” I was one of a couple of people who managed to drop a copy to the
  National Times. Rogerson was an enigma: both the charming neighbour who would
  play the organ in church and a calculating killer. Roxburgh: Michael’s most
  important note for me was “don’t blink”. I’d be sitting there with my eyes
  watering, then I’d watch it back on the split and realise, Oh, OK. Because as
  soon as you blink, you’re human. We were filming in Roger’s actual house. I
  always remember the weird experience of having a shower in his house with its
  pink tiles and looking down the drain, thinking: “He’s been in the nude in
  here, with blood washing down there.” Carmen: The actors were lovely and warm
  but could quickly become incredibly intimidating. It feels pretty realistic
  when somebody’s hands are around your throat and you’re being lifted off the
  ground, and just knowing that we were filming it in the actual place where
  Sallie-Anne had been murdered added a layer of truth. Roxburgh: Michael ran it
  like an anarchic military coup. We’d go out west and we’d take over a pub that
  had to open at six o’clock, and the stunties would be riding motorbikes
  through the bar. Bastoni: Michael liked it when actors cut each other off and
  talked over each other. No one was doing that at the time because you wanted
  to get clean sound. He was a real ground-breaker. A chequered legacy By the
  time the series was set to air, Smith was the principal witness at a NSW Icac
  inquiry and a royal commission into police corruption. He claimed that senior
  NSW detectives had given him a “green light” to commit crime from 1981.
  Bastoni: I was at the Saloon Bar in Camperdown during filming and someone
  sidled up, bought me a beer and said: “Michael Drury was a crook.” I said:
  “Internal affairs investigated him for over 10 years and found nothing on him,
  so why should I take your word for it?” He goes: “Well, a lot of people would
  be very disappointed if he wasn’t portrayed that way … Do you know how easy it
  would be for me to follow you into the toilet and put a bullet in your head?”
  Later I found out that this guy was a friend of Rogerson’s. I drove a 72
  Mercedes and from that moment on I’d actually check under the car. I was
  paranoid to the point where I had to go to a doctor and get some medication
  because I couldn’t sleep. Roxburgh: I got messages on my cell phone. It
  sounded like a pig squealing and being machine-gunned inside a wheat silo.
  McNab: It was Roger’s stock in trade to threaten people. When I wrote the
  first book I wrote to him in prison, wanting an interview, and I got a
  beautiful letter back. So I wrote the book and, a couple of weeks after it was
  published, I got a phone call in which he called me all manner of horrible
  names, and something along the lines of having me whacked. Years later, when
  he was in jail for the last one, his wife rings me and says: “Roger, would
  love you to visit him in jail.” I said: “Last time Roger and I spoke he
  threatened to kill me.” “Oh, that was only a joke.” Smith’s court proceedings
  meant the show was banned in NSW for six years, resulting in a demand for
  bootleg VHS tapes. Bastoni: The bootleg was sold in pubs all over Sydney as a
  two-pack VHS for about $400. Everyone wanted to see it. Richard Roxburgh and I
  once shared a beer at the Tatler Bar about 10 years later. He’d had a great
  career, worked with Baz Luhrmann and a bunch of people. He was hugging me and
  he goes: “That’s the best fucking thing we’ll ever do in our lives.” I wasn’t
  quite ready to hang up the cue but he saw it for what it was: something that
  would have far-reaching impact.
