  It’s Saturday. You’re free, or at least more free, to do whatever you want.
  You pick up your phone, hunting for something to read – at last, finally, you
  have time to read. You tap a few notifications while you wait to think of
  something deserving of this brief window. Suddenly it’s 2pm, you still haven’t
  read more than a few captions … Suddenly, it’s – wait: here’s something. Five
  things! Some of the best stories from around the Guardian’s global pages this
  week, in case you missed them. 1. Looks like medieval torture, hurts a lot,
  costs even more Men are paying thousands to get their legs broken and
  lengthened, in the quest to be taller. Ruth Michaelson, a journalist based in
  Istanbul, where many travel for the procedure, spoke to a few for whom the
  price is worth it. What’s involved? A very painful-sounding surgery based on a
  Soviet technique from 1951 – details, and some confronting pictures, are in
  the article. Then, daily physiotherapy to learn how to walk again, blood
  thinners, massages and a lot of painkillers. Do many people do it? There are
  few global statistics, but Michaelson notes an estimation by one Indian market
  research firm that the global limb lengthening industry will balloon by 2030
  to close to $13.4bn (US$8.6bn). How long will it take to read: about five
  minutes 2. The umpire who picked a side Why did Donald Trump thank John
  Roberts so effusively in his mammoth March speech? The Guardian’s chief US
  reporter, Ed Pilkington, has gone deep on the chief justice, now 70. Over the
  past 20 years, Roberts has painted himself as a modern institutionalist, but
  experts say he is emboldening Trump’s drive toward authoritarianism. View from
  a veteran: “The chief justice is presiding over the end of the rule of law in
  America,” says Michael Luttig, who served on a federal appeals court for 15
  years. View from a watchdog: “He has consistently shown hostility towards
  civil rights, trade unions and environmental protections, approaching the law
  with the rigidity of a rightwing ideologue,” says Lisa Graves, founder of a
  watchdog investigating rightwing groups that undermine democracy. View from
  the academy: “When district court orders are ignored, and the supreme court
  turns a blind eye, then the rule of law has already been sacrificed,” says
  Amrit Singh, director of NYU’s Rule of Law Lab. How long will it take to read:
  seven minutes 3. How do you stay focused when you have no food? Ahmed Kamal
  Junina is an assistant professor of applied linguistics and head of the
  English department at Al-Aqsa University in Gaza, where everywhere, as he
  writes, “starvation is avalanching, nearly unstoppable”. He explains how a
  day’s survival might come down to a few biscuits, or a single sachet of powder
  – and how, for many, the problem is even accessing money to pay for it (every
  bank is damaged, he notes; not a single functioning ATM is left). An act of
  resistance: He goes on to explain his need to keep working, even when he can
  barely stand. “This is not about ego. It is about refusing to disappear,” he
  writes. “To generate knowledge in the context of hunger is to think through
  pain. To teach students who have not eaten and still tell them their voices
  matter. To insist, against all odds, that Gaza still thinks, still questions,
  still creates.” How long will it take to read: a bit over three minutes What
  to watch: Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk, Sepideh Farsi’s documentary and
  “shattering memorial” to Palestinian photojournalist Fatma Hassona – showing
  at MIFF this weekend, for Melbourne readers, and hopefully available more
  widely soon. 4. ‘I’ve been stupid and I miss you’ A quarter of the adult
  population describe themselves as estranged from a relative, according to Karl
  Pillemer, a professor who has written a book on the subject. But after decades
  pass and rifts remain unhealed, what drives family members to repair their
  ruptured relationships? As Pillemer tells Deborah Linton, not all schisms can
  be bridged, especially in cases of deep, unresolved harm. But when the desire
  for reconnection is sincere – and mutual – “they can bring emotional closure,
  reduce regret and ease the grieving process for the one left behind”. *** “We
  picked up exactly where we left off. There was no animosity. It was guilt
  free. We haven’t had a harsh word since.” – Scott, who reconnected with his
  brother, Bruce, after a 15-year rift. Is there a common thread to really bad
  fallings out? Pillemer refers to the “volcanic event”, “where pressure has
  built up to a single trigger, the capstone in a history of conflict or
  communication problems”. Understanding what led to that, usually after some
  self-exploration, can help untangle things. How long will it take to read:
  About eight minutes 5. Desire laid bare in the consulting room On the matter
  of self-exploration: psychoanalyst Stephen Grosz ponders, in an extract from
  his new book, on what 40 years as a psychoanalyst has taught him about sex and
  desire. “When you were a small child – vulnerable, full of need – what did you
  learn about intimacy?” he asks. “In a way, our sex lives can be thought of as
  a solution to the problems given to us by our earliest fears, longings and
  animosities.” A life’s lesson: As a young man, Grosz thought the secret to
  happiness was in finding the “right” person, not realising, he says, “that
  each of us is responsible for our own happiness”. “I thought the many kinds of
  pain we suffer when we love another person – longing, anxiety, grief – were
  feelings to avoid, symptoms to be removed. I didn’t understand that pain is
  the finest instrument we possess for knowing what we desire.” How long will it
  take to read: A bit under nine minutes Further reading: If reading this made
  your own career feel slightly less fascinating, try Elle Hunt’s piece on ways
  to have more fun at work. For more on the tangles of love, it’s hard to go
  past Gillian Rose. Have a lovely weekend. Sign up If you would like to receive
