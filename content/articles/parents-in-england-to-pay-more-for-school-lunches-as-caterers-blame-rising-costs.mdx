  costs

  Parents across England are facing higher prices for school lunches as the new
  school year begins, with caterers blaming the government’s national insurance
  increase alongside rising food and energy costs. Lunch providers say increases
  in staffing costs, including employer national insurance contributions
  announced by the chancellor last year, have added “significant extra pressure”
  to their budgets. Food price inflation is also driving costs higher, pushing
  consumer prices above forecasts this summer. Prices for food and non-alcoholic
  drinks rose 4.9% in the year to July and are now 37% higher than five years
  ago, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. Letters sent
  to parents informing them of price rises acknowledged the strain on families
  but said changes were unavoidable if catering services were to remain viable.
  At Coleham primary in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, meals will rise by 10p a day to
  £2.60 from September 2025 because of “rising operational costs”. Bridge Hall
  primary in Stockport, Greater Manchester, said charges would rise by 8p to
  £2.73 – a 3.1% increase “in line with UK inflation”. Fernhurst Junior in
  Portsmouth confirmed a new daily rate of £2.86, and West Vale Academy in
  Halifax £2.60. Kingskerswell Church of England primary school in Newton Abbott
  raised costs to £2.75, up by 30p. Ministers have promised to widen eligibility
  for free meals from 2026 but schools have said they cannot wait that long.
  About a quarter of pupils in Englandcurrently qualify for free school meals,
  but campaigners say the government’s £2.61-a-meal funding is no longer
  sufficient, leaving schools to plug the gap. “All schools will be navigating
  the impact of rapidly rising food costs,” said Paul Whiteman, general
  secretary of the school leaders’ union the National Association of Head
  Teachers. “Sometimes school dinners are the only reliable nutritious meal a
  child will get that day, so for this to be of worse quality or more expensive
  is extremely concerning.” Judith Gregory, chair of LACA, which represents
  public and private sector caterers in schools, said they were “doing
  everything possible to shield families by streamlining menus, adapting recipes
  and finding efficiencies”. But Gregory said caterers’ efforts were not enough,
  and schools were having to raise costs for others to cover the funding
  shortfall. “Food inflation has driven up the cost of school meals by more than
  20% since 2020,” she said. “Without urgent action to raise funding to at least
  £3.45 per meal, schools will be forced to reduce options or introduce less
  costly ingredients, while families just above the free school meal threshold
  face higher charges.” Gregory said the recent increase in employer’s national
  insurance as well as annual pay increases for workers were adding “significant
  extra pressure” on top of already steep rises in food costs. Barbara Crowther,
  the children’s food campaign manager at Sustain, a group advocating for food
  and agriculture policies and practices that enhance health and welfare, said
  the “true cost of a healthy, sustainable school meal” was now closer to
  £3-£3.20, depending on the size of schools and catering operations.
  Campaigners argue that the higher charges will disproportionately affect
  low-income families, with many falling just below the threshold for free
  school meals. “School leaders are deeply worried,” said Whiteman. “They are
  seeing more families struggling and more children living in poverty – child
  hunger is a real concern. There is only so long schools can keep swallowing
  the increases. For many, putting up the cost of meals is now the only option.”
  The Department for Education said the government has taken “a historic step to
  tackle the stain of child poverty, offering free school meals to every child
  from a household that claims universal credit from the start of the 2026
  school year”. A spokesperson added: “The new entitlement will be fully funded
  and lift 100,000 children entirely out of poverty. To make sure meals are
  high-quality and nutritious, the government is working with experts to revise
  the school food standards, and we will continue to work closely with the
  sector to keep meal rates under review.” The Guardian was unable to reach
  schools for comment.
