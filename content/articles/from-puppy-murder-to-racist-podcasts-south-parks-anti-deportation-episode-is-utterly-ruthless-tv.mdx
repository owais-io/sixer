  Two weeks ago, South Park kicked off its 27th season with one of its angriest,
  most politically daring episodes. The animated sitcom, long a magnet for
  controversy, incurred the wrath of the current US administration for its
  brutal and graphic send-up of Donald Trump as a petty, micro-penised dictator,
  as well as parent company Paramount’s cowardly capitulations to him. Creators
  Matt Stone and Trey Parker received immediate backlash not only from online
  conservative fans (who make up a good portion of their audience) but the White
  House itself, which released a statement calling South Park hypocritical and
  irrelevant. That latter charge was especially poignant, given that Stone and
  Parker just inked a new deal with Paramount for five more seasons, plus
  streaming rights, to the tune of $1.5bn. Tensions have only risen in the two
  weeks since the premiere aired. During that time, the show released several
  stills from the follow-up episode, which widens its sights from Trump to his
  media mouthpieces and foot soldiers. Figures from both groups – rightwing
  activist Charlie Kirk and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) –
  boastfully shared these images on X, with the latter sarcastically thanking
  South Park for helping them in their recruiting efforts. (The show responded
  on X by asking DHS: “Wait, so we ARE relevant? #eatabagofdicks”.) All of this
  is to say that the new episode, titled Got a Nut, is coming in hot. And for
  the most part, it lives up to the hype. The episode follows two different
  stories: in one, the show’s resident bigot, Eric Cartman, is outraged to learn
  that fellow fourth grader Clyde has risen to prominence as a white nationalist
  podcaster who makes offensive claims about women, Jewish people, Black people
  and other minority groups to goad them into debating him in exploitative viral
  videos (“WOKE STUDENT TOTALLY PWNED”). Of course, Cartman isn’t angry on
  behalf of any of those groups; he’s mad that Clyde is ripping off his gimmick
  and reaping all the rewards. He decides to muscle in on the act, styling his
  hair after Kirk’s signature coif (“the stupidest haircut I’ve ever seen,” says
  one character), trolling college girls on social media and proclaiming himself
  a “master-debater”. The other storyline sees South Park Elementary’s kindly
  counsellor Mr Mackey out of a job thanks to government budget cuts. Desperate
  to find a new way to “make his nut”, he reluctantly joins Immigration and
  Customs Enforcement (ICE). Alongside his fellow masked goons – a collection of
  inexperienced, illiterate miscreants – and under the leadership of DHS
  secretary Kristi Noem, Mackey ends up taking part in violent raids at Dora the
  Explorer concerts and the literal gates of heaven, where he helps round up
  every Hispanic in sight (per Noem: “Only detain the brown ones! If it’s brown,
  it goes down!”). Both stories eventually intersect, as Clyde and Mackey are
  rewarded for their work with a trip to Mar-a-Lago. The country club is
  depicted as a gross, white trash version of bizarre 70s/80s US wish fulfilment
  drama Fantasy Island, with President Trump and vice-president JD Vance
  standing in for Ricardo Montalban and dwarf actor Herve Villechaize’s
  characters. Younger viewers may not get this reference, but they don’t need
  to: the visual of an ice-cream-suited Trump kicking around a dwarf version of
  Vance (his already big face puffed up to resemble the popular meme of him) is
  hilarious all on its own. Trump gets off easy here compared with Vance, but
  the show saves its harshest vitriol for Noem, who spends all her time
  viciously gunning down cute puppies (including the beloved Krypto from the new
  Superman movie) and struggling to keep her overly Botoxed face from melting
  off her skull. It’s a ruthless scouring of Noem, and you can feel Stone and
  Parker’s disdain for her in every frame. As per South Park tradition, the
  central characters come to realise the errors of their ways, with Mr Mackey
  delivering the episode’s moral straight down the lens: “If you’re doing
  something you don’t really believe in just to make your nut, you’re gonna find
  that you just get sadder and your nut just gets bigger, m’kay?” Herein lies
  the issue with the episode. Got a Nut posits that the individuals who serve as
  Trump’s most gung-ho operatives are acting entirely cynically, doing and
  saying things they know are wrong for an easy pay cheque. Certainly, that’s
  part of it (see the signing bonuses and sponsorship deals the episode
  highlights), but it is dangerous to underestimate how many of these people
  fully believe their own rhetoric. But of course, it would be silly to expect a
  half-hour episode of South Park to encapsulate every facet of Trump’s
  dystopia. Luckily, we’ve got plenty of episodes left to look forward to (48,
  minimum). Just as exciting will be the surefire backlash coming from Trump and
  his base, who are utterly incapable of not taking the bait. • This episode of
  South Park and all future episodes are available in the US on Thursdays on
  Paramount+, and in the UK on Fridays on Paramount+ UK
