  A Republican senator said that he doesn’t wear a seatbelt when he’s driving in
  Washington DC so he can act more swiftly if he gets carjacked, adding further
  fuel to repeated rhetoric by the Trump administration that crime is on the
  rise in the US – despite statistics indicating otherwise. Markwayne Mullin
  told Fox News on Wednesday that he avoids buckling up, violating local traffic
  ordinances, so he can “exit in a hurry”. “I’m not joking when I say this. I
  drive around in Washington DC in my Jeep and, yes, I do drive myself. And I
  don’t buckle up. And the reason why I don’t buckle up, and people can say
  whatever they want to, they can raise their eyebrows at me, again, is because
  of carjacking,” he said. While praising Donald Trump’s controversial
  deployment of national guard troops to the US capital and a federal takeover
  of the Metropolitan police department, Mullin said he wouldn’t wear a seatbelt
  in other cities controlled by Democrats. But he said he did wear a seatbelt in
  other jurisdictions. “If you look at car theft only, if Washington DC was a
  state, Washington DC would be three times higher than any other state,” Mullin
  said. “And we’re talking about a city. And we’re comparing it to full states.”
  Mullin’s comments come as a war of words over Washington DC’s crime rate
  continues between supporters and opponents of Trump’s order, which he casts as
  an effort to combat record-breaking levels of violent crime. “Murders in 2023
  reached the highest rate probably ever,” Trump said on Monday. “They say 25
  years, but they don’t know what that means because it just goes back 25
  years.” Trump also said: “The murder rate in Washington today is higher than
  that of Bogotá, Colombia; Mexico City; or some of the places that you hear
  about as being the worst places on Earth. It’s much higher.” Those stats align
  with a White House-provided graph unpacking 2024 homicides, revealing a
  homicide rate of 27.5 per 100,000 inhabitants in Washington – which puts the
  capital above cities like Bogotá, Colombia (15); Panama City, Panama (15); San
  José, Costa Rica (13); Mexico City, Mexico (10); Lima, Peru (7.7); and
  Brasília, Brazil (6.8). But official statistics tell a different story.
  Homicides dropped to 187 in 2024 from 274 a year earlier – the highest number
  since 1997. This year, there have been 100 homicides to 12 August, according
  to the New York Times, a slight decline from 112 at the same date last year.
  Compared with other capitals around the world, as also noted by the New York
  Times, Washington’s homicide rate is much lower, including in places such as
  Port-au-Prince, Haiti, with a rate of 67.2 per 100,000 people; Cape Town,
  South Africa, with 66.8; and Kingston, Jamaica, with 64.2. All have higher
  homicide rates, according to data compiled by the Igarapé Institute, a
  Brazilian thinktank, in 2023. Trump has claimed that “the number of car thefts
  has doubled over the past five years, and the number of carjackings has more
  than tripled”. The city’s dashboard shows carjackings rose for three years,
  from 2020, before declining in 2024. This year, through 9 August, there were
  188 carjackings, compared with 299 during the same time period in 2024, and
  compared with 607 in 2023, a police spokesperson told PolitiFact. Car theft
  also dropped 25% from 2023 to 2024. An analysis by the Washington Metropolitan
  police department, as reported by CNN, has also shown that overall crime in
  Washington has also decreased in 2025 – in line with the decline seen in other
  major US cities, such as New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.
