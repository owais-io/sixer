  Those who are acne-prone often have oilier skin, which leads some to believe
  that greasy foods such as pizza or burgers cause breakouts. “People think that
  eating greasy food increases oil on the skin, which leads to acne,” says Dr
  Rosalind Simpson, a medical dermatologist at the University of Nottingham.
  “But that’s a misconception. The oil on your skin – sebum from pores – is
  mostly influenced by hormones and genetics.” The primary cause of acne is an
  increase in androgens, or male sex hormones, which happens in men and women at
  puberty. This triggers an increase in production of sebum, and mixed with dead
  skin cells, this can block the pores. The oily environment allows bacteria
  (Propionibacterium acnes), which are naturally present on the skin, to thrive,
  leading to inflammation. Other hormone shifts, such as those caused by
  polycystic ovary syndrome or progesterone-only contraception, can also be to
  blame. Environmental factors do play a role, says Simpson. And though this
  doesn’t include greasy food consumption, it could include our stress levels
  and our diet in a wider sense. Acne has become more widespread over the past
  century. Some believe the rise could be linked to an increase in high
  glycaemic index foods, such as simple carbohydrates and sugary treats, though
  Simpson stresses that nothing is certain. “There’s emerging evidence that
  refined sugars may contribute,” she says, explaining that researchers are
  exploring how gut health is linked to skin health. If you’re dealing with
  acne, and self‑management with gentle, soap-free cleansers and moisturisers
  hasn’t helped, it’s best to consult a doctor early. “People try to change
  their diet to treat acne, but restrictive diets can be harmful, especially for
  teens, unless done under medical supervision,” says Simpson.
