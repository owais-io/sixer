  I am a playwright and PhD candidate, so I’ve wasted much of my life watching
  crap online. To give you an idea: during Covid, my housemate and I
  painstakingly ranked different performances of Chicago’s final electrifying
  dance number, The Hot Honey Rag. Regrettably, this article isn’t about
  critiquing toe-tapping murderesses vying for a comeback; it’s about what I
  find funny on the world wide web. These days, my algorithm mostly alerts me to
  red flags of narcissistic abuse, OnlyFans creators testing Instagram’s
  boundaries, and some harmless astrology. Sadly, none of the current content is
  particularly funny, but I’ve gone to great lengths scrolling through
  innumerable chat histories to a time when the internet still made me lol. 1.
  David Lynch interviews Cher Words fail when it comes to David Lynch and Cher.
  Sure, this clip is funny, but it’s Cher’s profound vulnerability (“I get very
  busy being Cher then I wonder who that is”) and David Lynch’s meditation on
  the colours of a traffic light that have compelled me to revisit this
  conversation time and time again. 2. Every lead girl in a period drama Last
  year I adapted Pride and Prejudice with Wendy Mocke for Queensland Theatre in
  something like six months. The pressure was on, and I had two crutches to get
  me through: hot yoga and this rather sharp takedown of the Regency period
  heroine cliche. 3. Real Housewives of Beverly Hills – Amsterdam fight I’ve
  watched this clip countless times, and many of the lines have become everyday
  parlance for me in much the same way we all reference Shakespeare without even
  knowing it. 4. Dame Edna on Parkinson Barry Humphries may have fallen into
  disrepute, but his megastar Dame Edna has an unassailable place in the
  pantheon of Australian talent. I want to take this opportunity to put my hand
  up to write on the free-to-air miniseries that will eventually get made and
  then nominated for a few Logies. I’ll save you the trouble of trawling through
  hours of content – this is Dame Edna’s funniest TV interview. 5. Alex Hines
  Sticking to the theme of megalomaniacal superstars, Alex Hines’s monstrous
  creation Juniper Wilde is surely due for another comeback. This must be from a
  show that has long since closed, but the line “I’m a shareholder; I have a
  right to finish” will live for eternity. 6. The sad tale of Mona Lott A friend
  gave me a weird side-eye look when I said I wanted to include this reel, but
  I’m doing it anyway. This presumably AI-generated dark fable had me in tears
  of laughter for reasons I’ll eventually unpack with my mental healthcare team.
  For the 0.05% of people who find this hysterically funny, we must have some
  serious in-yun (past life connection), and it’s now your job to seek me out
  IRL. 7. Elaine May at the AFI awards To paraphrase Stefon from SNL, this
  speech by Elaine May has got everything: wit, heart, the second page of a
  letter written by Einstein. Honestly, I rewatch this clip whenever I need to
  prepare an effortlessly amusing five-minute spiel for a friend’s wedding, an
  opening night speech or a first date. 8. Louis Hanson Louis Hanson specialises
  in cheeky, effervescent and digestible hot Melbourne boy content. Sometimes
  his comedic faux-naivety is all I can handle when I’m rotting on the couch too
  lazy to find something real to watch. 9. Hello, I’m Shelley Duvall The
  definition of comedy is a supercut of Shelley Duvall saying her own name again
  and again … I am only realising now how esoteric my sense of humour might
  appear to the good people who read the Guardian. 10. Situationships It’s funny
  because it’s true – but when you realise that he’s not actually joking, you
  can only laugh ruefully. Tears will do you no good in the face of the late
  capitalist technocracy where human connection is just another opportunity to
  create more content. Lewis Treston’s recent productions include IRL at La
  Boite, Hot Tub at Belvoir 25A, Follow Me Home at Australian Theatre for Young
  People, and Hubris and Humiliation at Sydney Theatre Company. His published
  work is available for purchase on Playlab.
