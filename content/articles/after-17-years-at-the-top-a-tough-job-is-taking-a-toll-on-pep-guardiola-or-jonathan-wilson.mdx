  Perhaps the most revealing aspect of the interview Pep Guardiola gave to GQ
  was how tired he sounded. The headlines that he was contemplating a 15-year
  break from the game didn’t entirely reflect what he said – “I don’t know how
  long I’ll stop for: a year, two years, three years, five, 10, 15, I don’t
  know. But I will leave after this spell with City because I need to stop and
  focus on myself, on my body” – but his weariness was clear. To an extent it is
  not a surprise. Jürgen Klopp was exhausted (and self-aware) enough after
  almost 15 seasons at Dortmund and Liverpool (plus seven at Mainz) to quit last
  summer. There were times last season, particularly in that four-month spell
  either side of Christmas when City’s form dipped alarmingly, that Guardiola
  seemed shattered. By his own admission, his decision last November to sign a
  contract extension to summer 2027 was motivated in part by guilt at the
  downturn. “The problems we had in the last month, I felt now was not the right
  time to leave,” he said. The problems got much worse. To which there can be
  two reactions. On the one hand, it is rare and admirable that a manager should
  feel such a sense of responsibility to his club. While many are sacked before
  they have a chance to resolve problems, there are also plenty happy enough to
  walk away with a pay-off and pass the crisis on to somebody else. But on the
  other hand, it probably is not a great sign if a manager with two years left
  on his contract is already looking forward to the extended holiday he is going
  to have when it is all over. But management is exhausting. It was striking in
  the interview that the element Guardiola picked out as most debilitating was
  having opposing fans chanting he was going to be sacked in the morning, the
  sort of mundane banter that it is easy to assume just washes off managers as
  experienced and successful as Guardiola. Beyond that, though, it is useful to
  be reminded just how tough a job management is and it may be getting even
  tougher. Over the course of his two autobiographies, it becomes clear how
  relentless Brian Clough found the grind of management: there was no time to
  enjoy a victory on Saturday, he said, before he was having to start thinking
  about the game on Wednesday. That was before the calendar was as packed as it
  is now and Clough was somebody quite happy to pop over to Mallorca for a
  holiday during the season, somebody who was noted even at the time for the
  infrequency of his appearances on the training pitch. Managers today have far
  more help than they used to. They have specialist coaches and analysts, and
  their job, at least at the top level, is focused largely on preparing the
  team. With one or two exceptions, transfers and long-term strategy is the
  responsibility of a sporting director. But still, it is an often thankless
  role where successes are quickly forgotten and a few bad weeks can lead to the
  sack. Guardiola, for all he may have disliked the banter from opposing fans,
  at least had enough credit in the bank not to fear that. And he is right;
  there is perhaps no other job somebody faces such unending scrutiny, such
  vocal criticism, from people who, frankly, know far less about it than they do
  (and, yes, that includes journalists, and no, that does not mean all criticism
  is necessarily misguided). Guardiola has spoken with a degree of enthusiasm
  about the challenge of rebuilding City. Given he has a naturally sarcastic
  tone, it is never entirely easy to tell, but that can probably be taken at
  face value. One of the problems for a manager who has been in a job for an
  extended time, particularly when they have been as successful as Guardiola, is
  finding new challenges. Building a team to win the league is invigorating,
  stimulating, exciting, setting it going again to win again less so. The
  comedian Stewart Lee wrote in his autobiography about how on long tours he
  would deliberately lose part of his audience because of the kick he got from
  winning it back; it is not to suggest Guardiola would have chosen to be in
  this position to say he may relish the challenge of restoring City to the
  title. There is another factor, which is that very few managers remain at the
  very highest level for much more than a decade. Sir Alex Ferguson is an
  obvious counter-example, 20 years separating his first title at Manchester
  United from his last, even after his successes with Aberdeen, but he is an
  outlier who skews expectations. Arrigo Sacchi’s peak lasted about four years.
  Even José Mourinho was probably already past his best when he won his last
  league title, at Chelsea in 2014-15, 12 years after his first, at Porto. Every
  game Guardiola has taken charge of since he was appointed at Barcelona in 2008
  has been dissected. For 17 years – less his year off in New York – opponents
  have been looking for ways to stymy his attacking plans and defensive
  vulnerabilities. Match footage has been pored over, data crunched. Part of
  Guardiola’s genius has been to keep evolving, to remain ahead of his pursuers.
  That has always happened, but never to the same extent as today. Teams have
  never been worked out so quickly; what might have taken a season 50 years ago
  now happens in a couple of weeks. To stay ahead is to adapt constantly and
  that is exhausting. There comes a point when the energy almost visibly leaves
  a manager, as it did with Mourinho, as it did with Arsène Wenger, and, unable
  to stay in front of the pack any longer, they lapse into self-parody.
  Guardiola is not there yet. Managerial arcs rarely end in a cliff edge; it is
  not that they are suddenly finished. But no career can go on for ever upwards.
  After 17 years at the top, as he begins to feel the toll, it may be that the
  descent has begun. Which may still be enough to win City another league title,
  but nothing lasts for ever.
