  Beast of War review – a gung-ho second world war movie, with a great white
  twist
sectionName: Film

bodyText: >-
  This year Australian shark movies have been particularly ravenous, swimming
  into different waters and taking a bite into other genres. Sean Byrne’s
  Dangerous Animals arrived in local cinemas in June, blending the creature
  feature and serial killer movies into one foul fishy stew, with Jai Courtney
  playing a psycho who feeds his victims to the sharks. And now we have Kiah
  Roache-Turner’s Beast of War, a second world war movie with a great white
  twist, which cheekily begins with a text insert declaring that it was
  “inspired by actual events”. That’s cheeky because this film doesn’t exactly
  aspire for social realism, which will come as no surprise to anyone familiar
  with Roache-Turner’s splatterific oeuvre (he cut his teeth helming monster
  movies about spiders, vampires and demons). Then again, one could argue – as
  many have – that all art is inspired by life. So perhaps it’s not too
  outrageous to connect this film to the sinking of HMAS Armidale, the
  aforementioned historical event in which an Australian corvette was attacked
  by Japanese bombers in 1942, resulting in the deaths of 100 of its 149 crew
  members. Just don’t go into Beast of War expecting a stock-standard war movie,
  or a stock-standard shark movie. Roache-Turner borrows from various genre
  playbooks but conjures a distinctive, gung-ho, atmosphere-oozing work that’s
  all his own. This blast of oceanic mayhem has a curious tone: not quite
  realistic, not exactly taking the piss. It’s led by a very entertaining lead
  performance from Mark Coles Smith (star of Mystery Road: Origin), who builds
  dramatic heft but also channels the spirit of midnight movies as Leo, a
  character who’s smart and principled but at any given moment may just punch a
  shark in the kisser. Leo is the only Indigenous soldier in a squadron of
  Australian troops that includes Will (Joel Nankervis), with whom he strikes up
  a friendship during military training. The training involves participating in
  drills and listening to a one-armed commander (Steve Le Marquand, having a
  good time) monologising about how he lost his arm “at the elbow” on the
  battlefield, while his mate “lost his head at the neck”. The plot really
  swings into gear when the ship carrying the troops across the Timor Sea is
  sunk by the Japanese. Leo and Will are among a small group of survivors, who
  huddle on drifting wreckage with limited resources and limited options.
  There’s a motor boat only metres away – but there’s also, in the words of one
  character, “a pissed-off 20-foot fish” swimming nearby. Like so many before
  him, Roache-Turner takes some inspiration from Jaws, doing a lot of cutting
  around the shark – though he’s not afraid to deploy vision of the gnarly
  chomper. The film is drawn to water from the start, including in an early
  flashback scene presented in milky reds and blues, which establishes a
  personal relationship between Leo and ravenous beasts of the sea. Another key
  part of Leo’s character is his sheer bloody Australianess. The shark disturbs
  him, but not as much as another man’s preference for Foster’s. “You dirty
  bastard!” he spits out. “VB all the way!” Cinematographer Mark Wareham (whose
  work includes Boy Swallows Universe, The Survivors and Cleverman) conjures an
  exciting visual flavour: a beautifully damp look with swirling milky colour
  schemes and stylishly askew angles. The presence of thick fog has a narrative
  purpose, but it also adds atmospheric richness, adding an extra air of
  unreality. The fog also helps to psychologically close in the environment and
  distract from the fact that much of Beast of War was obviously shot on sound
  stages. This smashingly well-paced and gung-ho film feels like it exists on
  the edge of consciousness – not quite reality, not entirely a nightmare, and
  certainly not a history lesson. Beast of War is showing at Melbourne
  international film festival now and will be released in Australian cinemas on
  9 October. International release dates have yet to be announced
