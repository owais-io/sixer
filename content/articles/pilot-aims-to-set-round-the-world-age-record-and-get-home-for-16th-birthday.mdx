  At 15 years and 10 months of age, Byron Waller can’t order a pint and has
  never driven a car, but on Wednesday afternoon he landed his small plane at an
  airport in Brighton, on England’s south coast. It was the 16th or so stop (he
  can’t quite remember) of a remarkable airborne odyssey that he hopes will make
  him the youngest supported pilot to fly around the world. The adventure began
  at his home in Brisbane, Australia, four weeks ago and has taken the teenager
  across the Indian Ocean and through the Middle East to Europe, from where he
  will venture around the other half of the globe back home. Though he is
  accompanied by an instructor – global aviation rules not easily permitting
  children to fly around the world on their own – Byron does all the flying of
  their tiny single-engined Sling TSi aircraft. They spend the flights – the
  longest of which so far was a 10-hour stretch from Singapore to Sri Lanka –
  chatting, calling family or occasionally listening to music, if he can get it
  to work, the teenager told the Guardian. What’s on the playlist? “Normally a
  good bit of Top Gun towards the start of the cruise, and then go into
  something else. I like to have it quiet for takeoff and landing, just so you
  can hear air traffic control and stuff.” It may not be how a typical teenager
  will spend September, but little about Byron’s life so far has been typical.
  Very unwell almost from birth, he spent his childhood in and out of hospital –
  “sometimes it was weekly, sometimes it was daily, sometimes it was monthly” –
  before finally being diagnosed with the bowel condition Crohn’s disease aged
  14. “It took a big toll on my life,” he said. “I missed birthday parties,
  missed school, missed, like, just normal school sports and all that sort of
  stuff.” Despite this, or perhaps because of it, he caught the flying bug
  young, thanks to a Scouts activity day that involved a trip in a small plane
  when he was just four. “That was the start of it, and from there it was like a
  fire lighting. It just kept sparking.” His had his first flying lesson at 13
  and obsessively loved it. “It was like a new beginning, really. It gave me
  motivation to keep going and get out of the hospital.” The following year,
  finally in remission, “I thought: how do I raise awareness for Crohn’s and the
  Queensland children’s hospital, which I’d spent most of my life in? And I
  thought I’d fly around Australia.” That mission having been completed last
  year, the world was next. What do his parents make of it? “Yeah, I had to
  persuade them a little bit. At first they were a bit worried, but they’ve seen
  how safe it actually is and how we’ve put in the correct strategies to make
  sure the trips are as safe as possible. They were a little bit worried, but
  now they’re fine with it.” They are all in constant contact, often during
  flights, he said, with his mother, Jeni Langdon, acting as his manager, fixer
  and publicist back home in Brisbane. Apart from the personal challenge, he
  hopes his story will inspire other young people. “People just don’t have the
  right motivation. They’re all on their devices. They just don’t have the
  motivation to overcome barriers. And I thought: why not try make a global
  mission of showing people that they can achieve their dreams, they can
  overcome their obstacles?” After a brief touchdown at the International Ayr
  Show in Glasgow this weekend, Byron’s next stop will be Iceland, then
  Greenland, then onwards. He hopes to land back home on 13 October, his
  birthday, where he is looking forward to seeing his family and his dog – and
  to turning 16, when he can finally apply for a recreational pilot’s licence,
  allowing him to fly a single-engine plane without supervision. “I might have a
  week off flying, and then I’ll get into it again,” he said.
