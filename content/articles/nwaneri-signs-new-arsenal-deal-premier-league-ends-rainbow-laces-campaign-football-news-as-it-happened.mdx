  Arsenal have tied down Ethan Nwaneri with a new and improved five-year
  contract, the 18-year-old winger rewarded for an impressive campaign last
  year. The Premier League has ended its partnership with Stonewall, bringing an
  end to the league’s Rainbow Laces campaign, which involved captains wearing
  rainbow armbands in an act of solidarity and support for members of the LGBT+
  communityty. Manchester City’s teenage central defender Vitor Reis has gone to
  another City Football Group club Girona on a season-long loan. A delegation
  from Crystal Palace spent this morning presenting its appeal to the court of
  arbitration for sport in Switzerland as the club attempt to be reinstated in
  the Europa League. A verdict is due on Monday. Aston Villa have completed the
  signing of Ivory Coast striker Evann Guessand from Nice. The 24-year-old
  frontman has been secured for a fee of £26m plus £4.3m in add-ons. Southampton
  have revealed that their teenage winger Tyler Dibling will not be in the squad
  for their Championship opener against Wrexham this weekend amid ongoing
  interest from Everton. The Albanian striker Armando Broja has left Chelsea and
  signed for Burnley in a permanent deal worth up to £15m. Barcelona have
  stripped Marc-André ter Stegen of the captaincy after a feud escalated between
  the Germany goalkeeper and the club over his injury status. Vitesse Arnhem
  have lost a last-ditch bid to get back their licence to play in the Dutch
  professional leagues, possibly signalling lights-out forever at one of the
  oldest football clubs in the Netherlands. And following its £50m glow-up,
  Manchester United’s training base at Carrington has been officially reopened
  for business. “We are confident the new facility will play an important role
  in building a winning culture at the club,” said Sir Jim Ratcliffe, throwing
  down the gauntlet to the gods of fate. Southampton: And if you’d like to see
  an example of Ben asking, instead of answering the tough questions – here’s
  his sit-down with the engaging and comparatively geriatric new Saints boss
  Will Still. Tomorrow’s matchday live blog: Ben Fisher might be the hardest
  working young tyro in football journalism but that won’t stop him from taking
  time out from writing match reports, interviewing players and managers from
  clubs the length and breadth of the country, calculating his astronomical
  mileage expenses and living on a staple diet of training ground sandwiches and
  service station pasties to answer your EFL-related questions in tomrrow’s
  blog. Send them here and he might just dignify you with an answer. WSL: While
  England’s Lionesses are enjoying a well-earned break after winning the Euros
  and the Women’s Super League isn’t due to kick off until September, it’s been
  quite a busy day in the sport. A quick reminder … Liverpool have announced the
  appointment of Gareth Taylor as their new head coach, marking his return to
  management in the Women’s Super League after being sacked by Manchester City
  in March. Manchester City have announced the signing of the former Liverpool,
  Charlton and Bristol City goalkeeper Eartha Cumings from Rosengård. And in
  something of a coup, WSL2 side Bristol City have signed the Wales veteran
  Sophie Ingle on a free transfer from Chelsea. Newcastle United: Having
  received more crushing knockbacks than a teenage me trying to find somebody to
  dance with during the slow set at a school disco during the late 1980s,
  Newcastle are hopeful of getting Yoane Wissa to sign on the dotted line at St
  James’ Park. Unlike many of the club’s previous transfer window targets, the
  Brentford striker actually wants to become a member of Eddie Howe’s squad and
  Sky Sports News are reporting that his representatives have flown into the UK
  to thrash out a deal. Burnley: The newly-promoted Premier League side have
  signed Armando Broja from Chelsea in a deal reported to be worth up to £15m.
  The Albanian striker, who spent last season on loan at Everton, for whom he
  made just 10 appearances in a campaign beset by injury, “I am really excited
  to be here as a Burnley player,” said the 23-year-old. “It’s a really positive
  time to be joining this club ahead of the start of the new Premier League
  season. I can’t wait to get going! I’m feeling good, I’m ready and I’m excited
  about the challenge of playing for this club. I can already feel the support
  from the Burnley fans – I can tell you all that I will be giving my all every
  time I pull on the famous Claret shirt.” Broja becomes the second Chelsea
  player to be signed by Burnley this week after Scott Parker’s side snapped up
  midfielder Lesley Ugochukwu on a permanent transfer. Dutch football: Vitesse
  Arnhem have lost a last-ditch bid to get back their licence to play in the
  Dutch professional leagues, possibly signalling an end to one of the oldest
  football clubs in the Netherlands. A Dutch court rejected an injunction
  request by Vitesse Arnhem that sought to halt a decision by the Netherlands’
  soccer association (KNVB) in July to withdraw its professional licence. In a
  statement on its website, the club said it was “deeply disappointed and
  distressed” by the decision. “We have done everything we can in the past
  period to meet the set conditions, in collaboration with the investors and
  other stakeholders,” said Michel Schaay, chairman of De Sterkhouders, a group
  of investors that sought to save the club. “The fact that this has been deemed
  insufficient is painful for us. Above all, for our supporters, employees, and
  the city of Arnhem.” The Central Netherlands District Court said in a
  statement that a judge ruled that the KNVB “did not violate the licensing
  regulations and could reasonably have reached this decision.” The judge who
  made the decision also said the ruling by the association’s licensing
  commission was “sufficiently reasoned.” Vitesse has been wrangling with the
  KNVB for years over its status. Last year, it was docked 18 points and
  relegated from the top-flight Eredivisie while under investigation for ties to
  sanctioned Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, the former owner of Chelsea. The
  club said today that it’s future is now unclear. Vitesse had been scheduled to
  play its first match of the new season in the second tier of the Dutch
  professional league on Saturday against Almere City. “The club is
  investigating the possibilities,” it said. “In the meantime, the leadership
  remains in talks with stakeholders to secure the continuation of soccer in
  Arnhem.” Sunderland: Regis Le Bris’s newly-promoted Premier League side are on
  the verge of making their 10th signing of an extremely busy transfer window
  after agreeing a deal to bring Arthur Masuaku to the Stadium of Light. The DR
  Congo international left-back who has previously played 105 times for West
  Ham, is a free agent after his contract with the Turkish side Besiktas expired
  in June. Championship: Tyler Dibling’s hopes of appearing in the next season
  of Welcome To Wrexham have suffered a hammer blow now that it’s been revealed
  he will not feature in Southampton’s opening game of the season against the
  newly promoted Championside. Saints boss Will Still has said the teenage
  winger will sit the game out amid ongoing interest from Everton. “There are a
  few players who are where they’re at in their career and making choices,” he
  said in his pre-match press conference. “Tyler won’t be there. Sam Edozie
  won’t be there and Joe Aribo won’t be in the squad either.” The trio of
  players are believed to have been training separately from their fellow
  Southampton players for the past week. Scottish Premiership: Best of the rest
  behind Celtic and Rangers in Scotland last season, Hibernian have signed
  Zambia international midfielder Miguel Chaiwa from Swiss Super League side
  Young Boys for an undisclosed fee. The 21-year-old has agreed a three-year
  deal, with the Easter Road club holding an option to extend the contract by a
  further campaign. “We’re pleased to bring Miguel to the club, he adds strength
  to our midfield options,” said Hibs manager David Gray. “He’s a young,
  athletic player that has a lot of potential. He’s keen to learn and develop,
  and we look forward to working with him and helping him to progress.” Evening
  all. Manchester United’s training ground has had a much publicised glow-up and
  Sir Jim Ratcliffe cut the ribbon this afternoon. The club’s minority owner
  promptly proceeded to tempt fate on an epic scale by describing it as a
  “world-class performance environment” as it reopened following a £50million
  refurb. United have called their Carrington base home since January 2000, when
  they left The Cliff, to move into a facility that cost £14.3m to build at the
  time. The training ground has undergone renovations over the past 25 years but
  had fallen behind many Premier League clubs, leading United to announce plans
  to turn it into a state-of-the-art complex last June. “Following a review of
  the facility last year, we made a quick decision to invest significantly in
  the creation of a world-class performance environment for staff and players to
  reflect our ambition and vision for Manchester United,” said Ratcliffe. “We
  are delighted with the outcome and are confident the new facility will play an
  important role in building a winning culture at the club.” This is the biggest
  upgrade to Carrington since it opened at the turn of the millennium, with
  United calling it a “leading-edge, high-performance training environment
  designed to inspire collaboration, innovation and excellence”. Given all that
  hyperbole, nothing less than a 14th place Premier League finish will suffice.
  That’s all from me. It’s time for Barry to see it home. Oliver Glasner,
  Crystal Palace’s manager, discusses the transfer speculation surrounding
  Eberechi Eze and Marc Guéhi. They face Liverpool in the Community Shield on
  Sunday. “He [Eze] will play on Sunday, Marc as well, Marc will captain the
  team. It’s part of success … then when you are Crystal Palace this is what
  happens, maybe bigger clubs are interested in your players. It’s normal that
  there are rumours. If you watch the training sessions they are 100% focused on
  Crystal Palace.” “People want to talk about Ethan Nwaneri; inside the club,
  outside the club. The buzz around the attacking midfielder as he tore his way
  through the youth ranks, having joined at nine, was palpable.” Here’s David
  Hytner on Nwaneri back in March. Arsenal have tied down Ethan Nwaneri with a
  new five-year contract, the 18-year-old rewarded for an impressive campaign
  last year. He scored nine goals in his 37 appearances, including 11 starts in
  the league. He told Arsenal’s website: “It means everything to me, I’m so
  happy to have got it done. This is where I feel at home, and where I’m going
  to develop the best. I’m ready.” Manchester City have announced the signing of
  goalkeeper Eartha Cumings from Rosengård. The 26-year-old previously played
  for Bristol City, Charlton and Liverpool, and won the Swedish league title
  last year, with Rosengård winning 25 of their 26 games and conceding just nine
  goals. Tidy. Manchester United have completed the revamp of their men’s
  first-team building at Carrington and it is looking very snazzy indeed. PA is
  reporting that the Premier League has ended its partnership with Stonewall,
  bringing an end to the league’s Rainbow Laces campaign, which involved
  captains wearing rainbow armbands. Ipswich’s Sam Morsy chose not to wear the
  armband last season, with religious reasons cited, while Crystal Palace’s Marc
  Guéhi wore an armband that had “I love Jesus” written on it. The England
  centre back avoided any formal action from the FA but was reminded of kit
  regulations prohibiting religious messages. A spokesperson from Stonewall told
  PA: “Rainbow Laces has helped improve LGBTQ+ inclusion, acceptance and
  participation in sport at all levels, whether player, participant or fan.
  “Rainbow Laces has helped to significantly shift the dial and while it can
  still prove difficult for elite players themselves to be openly LGBTQ+on the
  pitch, there are now some role models; at the grassroots level it is easier to
  participate and as a fan the LGBTQ+ community has increasingly felt more
  accepted. “Over the years, Rainbow Laces has benefited from a wide range of
  partners with a natural ebb and flow reflecting cultural and sporting changes.
  Alongside other sporting bodies the FA has been instrumental in advancing
  LGBTQ+ inclusion at the grassroots level and more recently the Women’s Super
  League has taken up the mantle as the women’s game has grown – enabling
  Rainbow Laces to reach more diverse audiences. “Increasingly, the younger
  generation – where one in 10 identify as LGBTQ+ – are focusing on fitness,
  health and mental wellbeing. Enabling LGBTQ+ inclusion and participation in
  sport remains vital; Rainbow Laces and its sporting partners will remain at
  the centre of those efforts in the years to come.” Will Unwin reports on
  Sheffield Wednesday and the turmoil at the club. Those at the King Power
  Stadium are due to show their disdain for the ownership by leaving their seats
  empty for the first five minutes and covering the area with a large
  anti-Chansiri banner. A plane is scheduled to fly overhead with a further
  message aimed at the owner. An aside: when did football fans start making the
  plane message a thing? Turns out that ‘Moyes Out’ in 2014 was not the
  beginning. Manchester City’s Vitor Reis is on the move, joining Girona on a
  season-long loan. As announced by City, the centre-back “will now link up with
  our sister CFG [City Football Group] club”. The 19-year-old signed for City in
  January and has made four appearances for the club. Afternoon, all. As
  promised, here’s John Brewin’s preview of Fulham, who have become a stable
  mid-table outfit. There is much talk of the growth of the Premier League’s
  middle class, and yet Fulham, who finished 11th last season, have received
  nothing like the same garlands as Brighton, Bournemouth and Brentford, the
  clubs immediately above them in the table. Righty, time to hand over to Taha.
  Thanks for reading. We’re nearly up to date with the Premier League previews.
  I’ll leave you with E before Taha Hashim adds today’s freshly-released
  offering when I hand over in five or so minutes. E is for Everton. Let’s get
  the brain engaged. Quite a few football questions in the Friday quiz. Surely
  you can beat my modest 9/15. Want to liven up that train journey to one of
  tomorrow’s Championship matches? Well, we have the perfect solution as our
  very own Ben Fisher is doing a Q&amp;A on the Championship in Saturday’s
  Matchday live feature. Ping your questions to: matchday.live@theguardian.com.
  A delegation from Crystal Palace has spent the morning presenting its appeal
  to the court of arbitration for sport in Switzerland as the club attempt to be
  reinstated in the Europa League. Uefa demoted Palace to the Conference League
  after they were deemed to have breached its regulations on multi-club
  ownership - a decision the club’s chair, Steve Parish, described as “one of
  the greatest injustices in the history of European football”. He was part of
  the Palace delegation that arrived at Cas headquarters in Lausanne early on
  Friday and is understood to have argued that Palace had been singled out by
  Uefa and that its rules had not been applied consistently. John Textor held
  shares in Palace and the French side Lyon, who also qualified for the Europa
  League, but he has since sold his 43% stake in the Premier League club to
  fellow US businessman Woody Johnson. Palace will continue to present their
  case this afternoon but a decision from Cas is not expected until Monday, with
  the FA Cup winners set to face Liverpool in the Community Shield at Wembley on
  Sunday. Nottingham Forest, who qualified for the Conference League after
  finishing seventh in the Premier League, are expected to be promoted to the
  Europa League if Palace’s appeal fails. More Premier League previews. Let’s
  check out C. C is for Chelsea… C is for Crystal Palace… Will Still was a
  fascinating appointment by Southampton back in May. Ben Fisher gets his chat
  on with the new Saints boss, who will bid to guide Southampton back to the
  top-flight following last season’s relegation. Liverpool Women have confirmed
  the appointment of Gareth Taylor as the club’s new head coach. The 52-year-old
  had previously enjoyed a five-year spell at Manchester City, winning the
  Women’s FA Cup and League Cup and just missing out on the WSL title in
  2023/24. Taylor told the club’s website: “I am delighted to have been
  appointed as Liverpool’s new head coach. Everyone in football knows about the
  history, size and potential of this club, and I am really looking forward to
  the task ahead. “Our aim is to create a team that supporters can be proud of,
  which plays good football and which will hopefully bring success along the
  way.” LFC Women managing director Andy O’Boyle said: “I’m absolutely delighted
  to welcome Gareth to the club. This has been a very detailed process and it
  was clear that Gareth was the outstanding candidate. He has a proven track
  record of building successful, identity-driven teams and his ability to
  develop players and help them reach the next level is second to none. “We have
  a very clear vision of how we will return LFC Women to the upper echelons of
  the game and this is a crucial step on that journey. We want our team playing
  with a clear identity as a Liverpool team, playing Liverpool football in front
  of passionate Liverpool fans. Gareth shares that vision and we believe he has
  the qualities and experience to deliver it.” A cheeky revelation from England
  women’s goalkeeper Hannah Hampton speaking on TalkSport in the last hour.
  During the Euro 2025 final shootout against Spain, Hampton revealed she’d seen
  that the Spanish goalkeeper, Cata Coll, had written notes about England’s
  penalty takers on her water bottle. But, if that was crafty, Hampton’s
  response took it to a new level: she chucked Coll’s bottle into the crowd!
  Just as clever was that the England camp cut off any chance of a reciprocal
  gesture by making sure Hampton’s notes were scrawled on her own arm. It’s the
  details! Here’s a nice read from Nick Ames. A few lines from new Aston Villa
  forward Evann Guessand following his move from Nice. Speaking on X, the Ivory
  Coast international said: “This club is special. History, pride, passion, the
  belief. “When I heard they wanted me I didn’t think twice. I am ready to give
  my all, every game, every minute.” Can’t argue with his PR skills. Guessand
  will hope to play a part when Villa host Newcastle in their Premier League
  opener next weekend. Here’s the fixture list for the opening weekend in the
  Championship. And what a way to kick off tonight. Ipswich are the title
  favourites at 3/1 while opponents Birmingham are third in the bookies’ lists
  at 7/1, just behind 11/2 Southampton. Friday 8 August 8pm Birmingham v Ipswich
  (all times BST) Saturday 9 August 12.30pm Charlton v Watford 12.30pm Coventry
  v Hull 12.30pm Southampton v Wrexham 3pm Middlesbrough v Swansea 3pm Norwich v
  Millwall 3pm Oxford v Portsmouth 3pm QPR v Preston 3pm Stoke v Derby 3pm West
  Brom v Blackburn 5.30pm Sheffield United v Bristol City Sunday 10 August
  4.30pm Leicester v Sheffield Wednesday More Premier League previews. And a
  busy category this one: the Letter B. B is for Bournemouth… B is for
  Brentford… B is for Brighton… B is for Burnley… Aston Villa have completed the
  signing of Ivory Coast striker Evann Guessand from Nice. The 24-year-old
  frontman has been secured for a fee of £26m plus £4.3m in add-ons. Between
  2020 and 2025, Guessand scored 19 goals in 89 League appearances for Nice.
  He’s played 10 times for the Ivory Coast, netting once. From the Villa
  website: “Guessand came through the ranks at the French club and enjoyed a
  2024-25 campaign where he scored 12 goals, helping Nice finish fourth in Ligue
  1. The Ivory Coast international, who is a versatile operator capable of
  playing across the front line, was also named Nice player of the season last
  term.” Boss Phil Parkinson has been reflecting on Wrexham’s journey as they
  prepare to play their first game in the second tier for 43 years when
  travelling to Southampton on Saturday. Parkinson is looking forward to running
  out as underdogs, a status the Red Dragons have rarely had since Hollywood
  stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney began their transformation of the club
  that has produced three consecutive promotions, taking them from the National
  League to the Championship. “It’s amazing that we’ll be running out at
  Southampton in front of a packed house, against a team that has spent a lot of
  time in the Premier League over the last few years,” said Parkinson. “When I
  look at my first game here, Solihull away in front of a couple of thousand
  people, and four years later we’re running out at Southampton. Sometimes you
  do have to step back and appreciate what we’ve done. “I don’t want us to fear
  it. I want us to go into every game ready to be positive. We’ve always been at
  our best when we’ve played in a positive way. We’re going to go into each game
  with that mindset and see where that takes us.” Back to the season previews
  and, in Sesame Street style, here’s the Letter A. A is for Arsenal... A is for
  Aston Villa… If you missed it yesterday, four English players and a Scot have
  been nominated for the men’s Ballon d’Or. They are: Jude Bellingham, Harry
  Kane, Cole Palmer and Scott McTominay. I was in Naples a month or so ago for a
  holiday and there were plenty of replica shirts of McTominay hung up around
  the place. But, my goodness, no current Napoli player comes anywhere near the
  absolute worshipping of Diego Maradona. Around every corner, there he is.
  Cardboard cutouts in shop windows, carousels filled with Maradona socks, his
  own fizzy drinks range and, of course, pop art murals of the Argentine legend
  liberally adorning walls all over the city. There’s one particular area
  located in the Quartieri Spagnoli where it’s a shrine to the No.10. Top tip:
  get the metro to Toledo and it’s a short walk. Surprisingly, there were
  posters for sale there of his 1986 handball against England. David Wall has
  emailed on the subject of Manchester United’s forward line. “With Manchester
  United signing Benjamin Sesko there seems to be an assumption that they’ll try
  to sell Rasmus Hojlund. Would that be a mistake? It seems very optimistic to
  assume that Sesko will adapt immediately to a new country and league, and
  especially without having had a pre-season to get to settle into the side. And
  it’s ridiculous to think that he could play every game. So they’re going to
  need more than one centre-forward in the squad, and of those they have
  (Hojlund, Zirkzee, Obi), Hojlund is the best. “But as well as needing cover
  for Sesko, it seems too soon to give up on Hojlund. He’s obviously talented,
  you can see that when he’s been on those scoring runs. And people like Alan
  Shearer on MotD have often highlighted how good his movement is, but that the
  service to him has been poor. He was brought in as a player to develop but the
  conditions around the club since then have hardly been conducive for that. If
  they were to sell him then it’s almost a sure thing that he’ll be banging in
  the goals within a few games wherever he moves to, given supportive conditions
  and where other players are actually looking to make opportunities for him. I
  know they need the money but it seems a very shortsighted move if they try to
  get it by selling Hojlund.” In this week’s Football Weekly Extra, the panel
  discuss whether Benjamin Sesko can have a big impact at Old Trafford. Max
  Rushden is joined by Barry Glendenning, Lars Sivertsen and Ben Fisher. Take a
  listen! This morning’s Rumour Mill has dropped. Manchester United’s Rasmus
  Højlund and Alejandro Garnacho feature in the outgoings while Newcastle’s
  search for a striker is now bleeping away over Molineux with a potential bid
  for Jørgen Strand Larsen. We’re over an hour into the blog and are yet to
  provide an Alexander Isak update. Inevitably, Liverpool boss Arne Slot was
  asked about the Newcastle striker in his morning press conference but
  channeled his Tim de Leede and played it back to the bowler. “As you know,
  from me and I think every manager works like this, you never talk about
  players that are not yours,” said Slot. “I can talk about Hugo [Ekitike], who
  we have signed and who has done really well until now. “We are very happy with
  the squad and have every reason to be happy because we won the league last
  season. OK, players left but we brought players in as well and youngsters are
  doing good.” This is a bit of a strange one. Barcelona have stripped
  Marc-André ter Stegen of the captaincy after a feud escalated between the
  Germany goalkeeper and the club over his injury status. Barca begin their La
  Liga title defence on 16 August at Mallorca. So what of Crystal Palace? The
  alphabet dictates that they’re No 8 in our list of Premier League pre-season
  team previews. We’ll drip feed these throughout the day but let’s mix up the
  order given that Palace are in action against Liverpool on Sunday. Ed Aarons
  runs the rule over the Eagles, noting that uncertainty over which European
  competition they’ll play in and a lack of summer recruitment has made for a
  less-than-ideal backdrop to the new season. Arne Slot has given fitness
  updates on two of his Liverpool players ahead of Sunday’s FA Community Shield
  showdown against Crystal Palace. Alexis Mac Allister picked up an injury at
  the end of last season and has been slowly phased back in, playing just under
  an hour against Athletic Club on Monday. Joe Gomez didn’t play any part in the
  double header against the Spaniards. Slot on Mac Allister: “He will be in the
  squad. He was out for two months I think, or longer because we didn’t play him
  in the last four games of the season. He trained with us since a week now,
  played 30 minutes, 45 minutes. “So that’s not a situation where you would
  start a player [and] play him for 90 minutes. Starting is possible but
  definitely not for 90 minutes.” Slot on Gomez: “Unfortunately he has a minor
  injury at the moment but he will be back with the team very soon.” Here’s Tom
  Garry with an exclusive: Bristol City have signed Sophie Ingle on a free
  transfer from Chelsea. That’s quite the coup for the WSL 2 club after the
  Welsh international, capped 142 times by her country and awarded an OBE in
  2023, won five WSL titles, three Women’s FA Cups and two League Cups during
  her time at Chelsea. Elsewhere, Liverpool are about to confirm the appointment
  of Gareth Taylor as new head coach. Some more transfer news. Bournemouth’s
  backline from last season continues to be ripped apart but the Cherries have
  one highly-rated replacement lined up. And there’s goalkeeper news at West
  Ham. Here’s Will Unwin on Benjamin Sesko’s move to Manchester United. The club
  will pay an initial £66.3m and the rest in potential add-ons for the
  22-year-old, who scored 13 times for RB Leipzig in the Bundesliga last season.
  Is the 6ft 5in striker the answer for the here and now? Is 13 goals in the
  German top-flight really that many? Newcastle wanted him too so the Slovenian
  is clearly highly regarded. Let us know your thoughts. Liverpool boss Arne
  Slot is currently chatting away amiably in his pre-FA Community Shield press
  conference. “A good challenge for us to start the season,” says Slot. He also
  lists Liverpool’s attacking options, stressing that Jeremie Frimpong can act
  as a right winger (and stand in for Mo Salah) as well as a right full-back and
  that Florian Wirtz could operate as a left-winger at times. More from Slot
  later. Notably, he doesn’t mention Darwin Núñez as part of Liverpool’s
  frontline and that’s because the Uruguayan is moving to Al-Hilal for £46.3m
  plus add-ons. Here, Andy Hunter looks at the striker’s hit-and-miss spell at
  Anfield. Let’s start with Ben Fisher’s preview of the new Championship season.
  Will your team be listed as an ‘automatic promotion contender’, a ‘playoff
  hopeful’ or a ‘relegation candidate’? Ben also lists three youngsters to
  watch. We seem to hear it every season that the Championship is the hardest
  league to get out of. That claim has merit, and perhaps even more so this year
  with Birmingham and Wrexham added to the mix as they continue their bid to
  speed through the leagues. As usual, the three relegated sides – Ipswich,
  Leicester and Southampton – will be expected to challenge, as will Sheffield
  United after racking up 90 points last season but still falling 10 short of
  automatic promotion. We’ll set the scene for opening weekend and, get this, it
  starts tonight with Birmingham v Ipswich, two of the sides most heavily tipped
  for promotion. Elsewhere, the transfer merry-go-round keeps spinning fast and
  Manchester United have continued to rebuild their forward line by agreeing a
  £73.3m deal with RB Leipzig to sign Benjamin Sesko. The striker is on his way
  to Manchester to undergo a medical before finalising the move. A central
  midfielder is also on Ruben Amorim’s wish list so brace yourselves for news of
  that, more plot twists involving Alexander Isak as well as Newcastle’s
  attempts to sign anyone at all. And don’t forget that on Sunday, we’ll get the
  chance to see some of Liverpool’s exotic new signings in action as the
  champions take on FA Cup winners Crystal Palace in the FA Community Shield.
  Right, let’s get this going!

Arsenal have tied down Ethan Nwaneri with a new and improved five-year contract, the 18-year-old winger rewarded for an impressive campaign last year. The Premier League has ended its partnership with Stonewall, bringing an end to the league’s Rainbow Laces campaign, which involved captains wearing rainbow armbands in an act of solidarity and support for members of the LGBT+ communityty. Manchester City’s teenage central defender Vitor Reis has gone to another City Football Group club Girona on a season-long loan. A delegation from Crystal Palace spent this morning presenting its appeal to the court of arbitration for sport in Switzerland as the club attempt to be reinstated in the Europa League. A verdict is due on Monday. Aston Villa have completed the signing of Ivory Coast striker Evann Guessand from Nice. The 24-year-old frontman has been secured for a fee of £26m plus £4.3m in add-ons. Southampton have revealed that their teenage winger Tyler Dibling will not be in the squad for their Championship opener against Wrexham this weekend amid ongoing interest from Everton. The Albanian striker Armando Broja has left Chelsea and signed for Burnley in a permanent deal worth up to £15m. Barcelona have stripped Marc-André ter Stegen of the captaincy after a feud escalated between the Germany goalkeeper and the club over his injury status. Vitesse Arnhem have lost a last-ditch bid to get back their licence to play in the Dutch professional leagues, possibly signalling lights-out forever at one of the oldest football clubs in the Netherlands. And following its £50m glow-up, Manchester United’s training base at Carrington has been officially reopened for business. “We are confident the new facility will play an important role in building a winning culture at the club,” said Sir Jim Ratcliffe, throwing down the gauntlet to the gods of fate. Southampton: And if you’d like to see an example of Ben asking, instead of answering the tough questions – here’s his sit-down with the engaging and comparatively geriatric new Saints boss Will Still. Tomorrow’s matchday live blog: Ben Fisher might be the hardest working young tyro in football journalism but that won’t stop him from taking time out from writing match reports, interviewing players and managers from clubs the length and breadth of the country, calculating his astronomical mileage expenses and living on a staple diet of training ground sandwiches and service station pasties to answer your EFL-related questions in tomrrow’s blog. Send them here and he might just dignify you with an answer. WSL: While England’s Lionesses are enjoying a well-earned break after winning the Euros and the Women’s Super League isn’t due to kick off until September, it’s been quite a busy day in the sport. A quick reminder … Liverpool have announced the appointment of Gareth Taylor as their new head coach, marking his return to management in the Women’s Super League after being sacked by Manchester City in March. Manchester City have announced the signing of the former Liverpool, Charlton and Bristol City goalkeeper Eartha Cumings from Rosengård. And in something of a coup, WSL2 side Bristol City have signed the Wales veteran Sophie Ingle on a free transfer from Chelsea. Newcastle United: Having received more crushing knockbacks than a teenage me trying to find somebody to dance with during the slow set at a school disco during the late 1980s, Newcastle are hopeful of getting Yoane Wissa to sign on the dotted line at St James’ Park. Unlike many of the club’s previous transfer window targets, the Brentford striker actually wants to become a member of Eddie Howe’s squad and Sky Sports News are reporting that his representatives have flown into the UK to thrash out a deal. Burnley: The newly-promoted Premier League side have signed Armando Broja from Chelsea in a deal reported to be worth up to £15m. The Albanian striker, who spent last season on loan at Everton, for whom he made just 10 appearances in a campaign beset by injury, “I am really excited to be here as a Burnley player,” said the 23-year-old. “It’s a really positive time to be joining this club ahead of the start of the new Premier League season. I can’t wait to get going! I’m feeling good, I’m ready and I’m excited about the challenge of playing for this club. I can already feel the support from the Burnley fans – I can tell you all that I will be giving my all every time I pull on the famous Claret shirt.” Broja becomes the second Chelsea player to be signed by Burnley this week after Scott Parker’s side snapped up midfielder Lesley Ugochukwu on a permanent transfer. Dutch football: Vitesse Arnhem have lost a last-ditch bid to get back their licence to play in the Dutch professional leagues, possibly signalling an end to one of the oldest football clubs in the Netherlands. A Dutch court rejected an injunction request by Vitesse Arnhem that sought to halt a decision by the Netherlands’ soccer association (KNVB) in July to withdraw its professional licence. In a statement on its website, the club said it was “deeply disappointed and distressed” by the decision. “We have done everything we can in the past period to meet the set conditions, in collaboration with the investors and other stakeholders,” said Michel Schaay, chairman of De Sterkhouders, a group of investors that sought to save the club. “The fact that this has been deemed insufficient is painful for us. Above all, for our supporters, employees, and the city of Arnhem.” The Central Netherlands District Court said in a statement that a judge ruled that the KNVB “did not violate the licensing regulations and could reasonably have reached this decision.” The judge who made the decision also said the ruling by the association’s licensing commission was “sufficiently reasoned.” Vitesse has been wrangling with the KNVB for years over its status. Last year, it was docked 18 points and relegated from the top-flight Eredivisie while under investigation for ties to sanctioned Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, the former owner of Chelsea. The club said today that it’s future is now unclear. Vitesse had been scheduled to play its first match of the new season in the second tier of the Dutch professional league on Saturday against Almere City. “The club is investigating the possibilities,” it said. “In the meantime, the leadership remains in talks with stakeholders to secure the continuation of soccer in Arnhem.” Sunderland: Regis Le Bris’s newly-promoted Premier League side are on the verge of making their 10th signing of an extremely busy transfer window after agreeing a deal to bring Arthur Masuaku to the Stadium of Light. The DR Congo international left-back who has previously played 105 times for West Ham, is a free agent after his contract with the Turkish side Besiktas expired in June. Championship: Tyler Dibling’s hopes of appearing in the next season of Welcome To Wrexham have suffered a hammer blow now that it’s been revealed he will not feature in Southampton’s opening game of the season against the newly promoted Championside. Saints boss Will Still has said the teenage winger will sit the game out amid ongoing interest from Everton. “There are a few players who are where they’re at in their career and making choices,” he said in his pre-match press conference. “Tyler won’t be there. Sam Edozie won’t be there and Joe Aribo won’t be in the squad either.” The trio of players are believed to have been training separately from their fellow Southampton players for the past week. Scottish Premiership: Best of the rest behind Celtic and Rangers in Scotland last season, Hibernian have signed Zambia international midfielder Miguel Chaiwa from Swiss Super League side Young Boys for an undisclosed fee. The 21-year-old has agreed a three-year deal, with the Easter Road club holding an option to extend the contract by a further campaign. “We’re pleased to bring Miguel to the club, he adds strength to our midfield options,” said Hibs manager David Gray. “He’s a young, athletic player that has a lot of potential. He’s keen to learn and develop, and we look forward to working with him and helping him to progress.” Evening all. Manchester United’s training ground has had a much publicised glow-up and Sir Jim Ratcliffe cut the ribbon this afternoon. The club’s minority owner promptly proceeded to tempt fate on an epic scale by describing it as a “world-class performance environment” as it reopened following a £50million refurb. United have called their Carrington base home since January 2000, when they left The Cliff, to move into a facility that cost £14.3m to build at the time. The training ground has undergone renovations over the past 25 years but had fallen behind many Premier League clubs, leading United to announce plans to turn it into a state-of-the-art complex last June. “Following a review of the facility last year, we made a quick decision to invest significantly in the creation of a world-class performance environment for staff and players to reflect our ambition and vision for Manchester United,” said Ratcliffe. “We are delighted with the outcome and are confident the new facility will play an important role in building a winning culture at the club.” This is the biggest upgrade to Carrington since it opened at the turn of the millennium, with United calling it a “leading-edge, high-performance training environment designed to inspire collaboration, innovation and excellence”. Given all that hyperbole, nothing less than a 14th place Premier League finish will suffice. That’s all from me. It’s time for Barry to see it home. Oliver Glasner, Crystal Palace’s manager, discusses the transfer speculation surrounding Eberechi Eze and Marc Guéhi. They face Liverpool in the Community Shield on Sunday. “He [Eze] will play on Sunday, Marc as well, Marc will captain the team. It’s part of success … then when you are Crystal Palace this is what happens, maybe bigger clubs are interested in your players. It’s normal that there are rumours. If you watch the training sessions they are 100% focused on Crystal Palace.” “People want to talk about Ethan Nwaneri; inside the club, outside the club. The buzz around the attacking midfielder as he tore his way through the youth ranks, having joined at nine, was palpable.” Here’s David Hytner on Nwaneri back in March. Arsenal have tied down Ethan Nwaneri with a new five-year contract, the 18-year-old rewarded for an impressive campaign last year. He scored nine goals in his 37 appearances, including 11 starts in the league. He told Arsenal’s website: “It means everything to me, I’m so happy to have got it done. This is where I feel at home, and where I’m going to develop the best. I’m ready.” Manchester City have announced the signing of goalkeeper Eartha Cumings from Rosengård. The 26-year-old previously played for Bristol City, Charlton and Liverpool, and won the Swedish league title last year, with Rosengård winning 25 of their 26 games and conceding just nine goals. Tidy. Manchester United have completed the revamp of their men’s first-team building at Carrington and it is looking very snazzy indeed. PA is reporting that the Premier League has ended its partnership with Stonewall, bringing an end to the league’s Rainbow Laces campaign, which involved captains wearing rainbow armbands. Ipswich’s Sam Morsy chose not to wear the armband last season, with religious reasons cited, while Crystal Palace’s Marc Guéhi wore an armband that had “I love Jesus” written on it. The England centre back avoided any formal action from the FA but was reminded of kit regulations prohibiting religious messages. A spokesperson from Stonewall told PA: “Rainbow Laces has helped improve LGBTQ+ inclusion, acceptance and participation in sport at all levels, whether player, participant or fan. “Rainbow Laces has helped to significantly shift the dial and while it can still prove difficult for elite players themselves to be openly LGBTQ+on the pitch, there are now some role models; at the grassroots level it is easier to participate and as a fan the LGBTQ+ community has increasingly felt more accepted. “Over the years, Rainbow Laces has benefited from a wide range of partners with a natural ebb and flow reflecting cultural and sporting changes. Alongside other sporting bodies the FA has been instrumental in advancing LGBTQ+ inclusion at the grassroots level and more recently the Women’s Super League has taken up the mantle as the women’s game has grown – enabling Rainbow Laces to reach more diverse audiences. “Increasingly, the younger generation – where one in 10 identify as LGBTQ+ – are focusing on fitness, health and mental wellbeing. Enabling LGBTQ+ inclusion and participation in sport remains vital; Rainbow Laces and its sporting partners will remain at the centre of those efforts in the years to come.” Will Unwin reports on Sheffield Wednesday and the turmoil at the club. Those at the King Power Stadium are due to show their disdain for the ownership by leaving their seats empty for the first five minutes and covering the area with a large anti-Chansiri banner. A plane is scheduled to fly overhead with a further message aimed at the owner. An aside: when did football fans start making the plane message a thing? Turns out that ‘Moyes Out’ in 2014 was not the beginning. Manchester City’s Vitor Reis is on the move, joining Girona on a season-long loan. As announced by City, the centre-back “will now link up with our sister CFG [City Football Group] club”. The 19-year-old signed for City in January and has made four appearances for the club. Afternoon, all. As promised, here’s John Brewin’s preview of Fulham, who have become a stable mid-table outfit. There is much talk of the growth of the Premier League’s middle class, and yet Fulham, who finished 11th last season, have received nothing like the same garlands as Brighton, Bournemouth and Brentford, the clubs immediately above them in the table. Righty, time to hand over to Taha. Thanks for reading. We’re nearly up to date with the Premier League previews. I’ll leave you with E before Taha Hashim adds today’s freshly-released offering when I hand over in five or so minutes. E is for Everton. Let’s get the brain engaged. Quite a few football questions in the Friday quiz. Surely you can beat my modest 9/15. Want to liven up that train journey to one of tomorrow’s Championship matches? Well, we have the perfect solution as our very own Ben Fisher is doing a Q&amp;A on the Championship in Saturday’s Matchday live feature. Ping your questions to: matchday.live@theguardian.com. A delegation from Crystal Palace has spent the morning presenting its appeal to the court of arbitration for sport in Switzerland as the club attempt to be reinstated in the Europa League. Uefa demoted Palace to the Conference League after they were deemed to have breached its regulations on multi-club ownership - a decision the club’s chair, Steve Parish, described as “one of the greatest injustices in the history of European football”. He was part of the Palace delegation that arrived at Cas headquarters in Lausanne early on Friday and is understood to have argued that Palace had been singled out by Uefa and that its rules had not been applied consistently. John Textor held shares in Palace and the French side Lyon, who also qualified for the Europa League, but he has since sold his 43% stake in the Premier League club to fellow US businessman Woody Johnson. Palace will continue to present their case this afternoon but a decision from Cas is not expected until Monday, with the FA Cup winners set to face Liverpool in the Community Shield at Wembley on Sunday. Nottingham Forest, who qualified for the Conference League after finishing seventh in the Premier League, are expected to be promoted to the Europa League if Palace’s appeal fails. More Premier League previews. Let’s check out C. C is for Chelsea… C is for Crystal Palace… Will Still was a fascinating appointment by Southampton back in May. Ben Fisher gets his chat on with the new Saints boss, who will bid to guide Southampton back to the top-flight following last season’s relegation. Liverpool Women have confirmed the appointment of Gareth Taylor as the club’s new head coach. The 52-year-old had previously enjoyed a five-year spell at Manchester City, winning the Women’s FA Cup and League Cup and just missing out on the WSL title in 2023/24. Taylor told the club’s website: “I am delighted to have been appointed as Liverpool’s new head coach. Everyone in football knows about the history, size and potential of this club, and I am really looking forward to the task ahead. “Our aim is to create a team that supporters can be proud of, which plays good football and which will hopefully bring success along the way.” LFC Women managing director Andy O’Boyle said: “I’m absolutely delighted to welcome Gareth to the club. This has been a very detailed process and it was clear that Gareth was the outstanding candidate. He has a proven track record of building successful, identity-driven teams and his ability to develop players and help them reach the next level is second to none. “We have a very clear vision of how we will return LFC Women to the upper echelons of the game and this is a crucial step on that journey. We want our team playing with a clear identity as a Liverpool team, playing Liverpool football in front of passionate Liverpool fans. Gareth shares that vision and we believe he has the qualities and experience to deliver it.” A cheeky revelation from England women’s goalkeeper Hannah Hampton speaking on TalkSport in the last hour. During the Euro 2025 final shootout against Spain, Hampton revealed she’d seen that the Spanish goalkeeper, Cata Coll, had written notes about England’s penalty takers on her water bottle. But, if that was crafty, Hampton’s response took it to a new level: she chucked Coll’s bottle into the crowd! Just as clever was that the England camp cut off any chance of a reciprocal gesture by making sure Hampton’s notes were scrawled on her own arm. It’s the details! Here’s a nice read from Nick Ames. A few lines from new Aston Villa forward Evann Guessand following his move from Nice. Speaking on X, the Ivory Coast international said: “This club is special. History, pride, passion, the belief. “When I heard they wanted me I didn’t think twice. I am ready to give my all, every game, every minute.” Can’t argue with his PR skills. Guessand will hope to play a part when Villa host Newcastle in their Premier League opener next weekend. Here’s the fixture list for the opening weekend in the Championship. And what a way to kick off tonight. Ipswich are the title favourites at 3/1 while opponents Birmingham are third in the bookies’ lists at 7/1, just behind 11/2 Southampton. Friday 8 August 8pm Birmingham v Ipswich (all times BST) Saturday 9 August 12.30pm Charlton v Watford 12.30pm Coventry v Hull 12.30pm Southampton v Wrexham 3pm Middlesbrough v Swansea 3pm Norwich v Millwall 3pm Oxford v Portsmouth 3pm QPR v Preston 3pm Stoke v Derby 3pm West Brom v Blackburn 5.30pm Sheffield United v Bristol City Sunday 10 August 4.30pm Leicester v Sheffield Wednesday More Premier League previews. And a busy category this one: the Letter B. B is for Bournemouth… B is for Brentford… B is for Brighton… B is for Burnley… Aston Villa have completed the signing of Ivory Coast striker Evann Guessand from Nice. The 24-year-old frontman has been secured for a fee of £26m plus £4.3m in add-ons. Between 2020 and 2025, Guessand scored 19 goals in 89 League appearances for Nice. He’s played 10 times for the Ivory Coast, netting once. From the Villa website: “Guessand came through the ranks at the French club and enjoyed a 2024-25 campaign where he scored 12 goals, helping Nice finish fourth in Ligue 1. The Ivory Coast international, who is a versatile operator capable of playing across the front line, was also named Nice player of the season last term.” Boss Phil Parkinson has been reflecting on Wrexham’s journey as they prepare to play their first game in the second tier for 43 years when travelling to Southampton on Saturday. Parkinson is looking forward to running out as underdogs, a status the Red Dragons have rarely had since Hollywood stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney began their transformation of the club that has produced three consecutive promotions, taking them from the National League to the Championship. “It’s amazing that we’ll be running out at Southampton in front of a packed house, against a team that has spent a lot of time in the Premier League over the last few years,” said Parkinson. “When I look at my first game here, Solihull away in front of a couple of thousand people, and four years later we’re running out at Southampton. Sometimes you do have to step back and appreciate what we’ve done. “I don’t want us to fear it. I want us to go into every game ready to be positive. We’ve always been at our best when we’ve played in a positive way. We’re going to go into each game with that mindset and see where that takes us.” Back to the season previews and, in Sesame Street style, here’s the Letter A. A is for Arsenal... A is for Aston Villa… If you missed it yesterday, four English players and a Scot have been nominated for the men’s Ballon d’Or. They are: Jude Bellingham, Harry Kane, Cole Palmer and Scott McTominay. I was in Naples a month or so ago for a holiday and there were plenty of replica shirts of McTominay hung up around the place. But, my goodness, no current Napoli player comes anywhere near the absolute worshipping of Diego Maradona. Around every corner, there he is. Cardboard cutouts in shop windows, carousels filled with Maradona socks, his own fizzy drinks range and, of course, pop art murals of the Argentine legend liberally adorning walls all over the city. There’s one particular area located in the Quartieri Spagnoli where it’s a shrine to the No.10. Top tip: get the metro to Toledo and it’s a short walk. Surprisingly, there were posters for sale there of his 1986 handball against England. David Wall has emailed on the subject of Manchester United’s forward line. “With Manchester United signing Benjamin Sesko there seems to be an assumption that they’ll try to sell Rasmus Hojlund. Would that be a mistake? It seems very optimistic to assume that Sesko will adapt immediately to a new country and league, and especially without having had a pre-season to get to settle into the side. And it’s ridiculous to think that he could play every game. So they’re going to need more than one centre-forward in the squad, and of those they have (Hojlund, Zirkzee, Obi), Hojlund is the best. “But as well as needing cover for Sesko, it seems too soon to give up on Hojlund. He’s obviously talented, you can see that when he’s been on those scoring runs. And people like Alan Shearer on MotD have often highlighted how good his movement is, but that the service to him has been poor. He was brought in as a player to develop but the conditions around the club since then have hardly been conducive for that. If they were to sell him then it’s almost a sure thing that he’ll be banging in the goals within a few games wherever he moves to, given supportive conditions and where other players are actually looking to make opportunities for him. I know they need the money but it seems a very shortsighted move if they try to get it by selling Hojlund.” In this week’s Football Weekly Extra, the panel discuss whether Benjamin Sesko can have a big impact at Old Trafford. Max Rushden is joined by Barry Glendenning, Lars Sivertsen and Ben Fisher. Take a listen! This morning’s Rumour Mill has dropped. Manchester United’s Rasmus Højlund and Alejandro Garnacho feature in the outgoings while Newcastle’s search for a striker is now bleeping away over Molineux with a potential bid for Jørgen Strand Larsen. We’re over an hour into the blog and are yet to provide an Alexander Isak update. Inevitably, Liverpool boss Arne Slot was asked about the Newcastle striker in his morning press conference but channeled his Tim de Leede and played it back to the bowler. “As you know, from me and I think every manager works like this, you never talk about players that are not yours,” said Slot. “I can talk about Hugo [Ekitike], who we have signed and who has done really well until now. “We are very happy with the squad and have every reason to be happy because we won the league last season. OK, players left but we brought players in as well and youngsters are doing good.” This is a bit of a strange one. Barcelona have stripped Marc-André ter Stegen of the captaincy after a feud escalated between the Germany goalkeeper and the club over his injury status. Barca begin their La Liga title defence on 16 August at Mallorca. So what of Crystal Palace? The alphabet dictates that they’re No 8 in our list of Premier League pre-season team previews. We’ll drip feed these throughout the day but let’s mix up the order given that Palace are in action against Liverpool on Sunday. Ed Aarons runs the rule over the Eagles, noting that uncertainty over which European competition they’ll play in and a lack of summer recruitment has made for a less-than-ideal backdrop to the new season. Arne Slot has given fitness updates on two of his Liverpool players ahead of Sunday’s FA Community Shield showdown against Crystal Palace. Alexis Mac Allister picked up an injury at the end of last season and has been slowly phased back in, playing just under an hour against Athletic Club on Monday. Joe Gomez didn’t play any part in the double header against the Spaniards. Slot on Mac Allister: “He will be in the squad. He was out for two months I think, or longer because we didn’t play him in the last four games of the season. He trained with us since a week now, played 30 minutes, 45 minutes. “So that’s not a situation where you would start a player [and] play him for 90 minutes. Starting is possible but definitely not for 90 minutes.” Slot on Gomez: “Unfortunately he has a minor injury at the moment but he will be back with the team very soon.” Here’s Tom Garry with an exclusive: Bristol City have signed Sophie Ingle on a free transfer from Chelsea. That’s quite the coup for the WSL 2 club after the Welsh international, capped 142 times by her country and awarded an OBE in 2023, won five WSL titles, three Women’s FA Cups and two League Cups during her time at Chelsea. Elsewhere, Liverpool are about to confirm the appointment of Gareth Taylor as new head coach. Some more transfer news. Bournemouth’s backline from last season continues to be ripped apart but the Cherries have one highly-rated replacement lined up. And there’s goalkeeper news at West Ham. Here’s Will Unwin on Benjamin Sesko’s move to Manchester United. The club will pay an initial £66.3m and the rest in potential add-ons for the 22-year-old, who scored 13 times for RB Leipzig in the Bundesliga last season. Is the 6ft 5in striker the answer for the here and now? Is 13 goals in the German top-flight really that many? Newcastle wanted him too so the Slovenian is clearly highly regarded. Let us know your thoughts. Liverpool boss Arne Slot is currently chatting away amiably in his pre-FA Community Shield press conference. “A good challenge for us to start the season,” says Slot. He also lists Liverpool’s attacking options, stressing that Jeremie Frimpong can act as a right winger (and stand in for Mo Salah) as well as a right full-back and that Florian Wirtz could operate as a left-winger at times. More from Slot later. Notably, he doesn’t mention Darwin Núñez as part of Liverpool’s frontline and that’s because the Uruguayan is moving to Al-Hilal for £46.3m plus add-ons. Here, Andy Hunter looks at the striker’s hit-and-miss spell at Anfield. Let’s start with Ben Fisher’s preview of the new Championship season. Will your team be listed as an ‘automatic promotion contender’, a ‘playoff hopeful’ or a ‘relegation candidate’? Ben also lists three youngsters to watch. We seem to hear it every season that the Championship is the hardest league to get out of. That claim has merit, and perhaps even more so this year with Birmingham and Wrexham added to the mix as they continue their bid to speed through the leagues. As usual, the three relegated sides – Ipswich, Leicester and Southampton – will be expected to challenge, as will Sheffield United after racking up 90 points last season but still falling 10 short of automatic promotion. We’ll set the scene for opening weekend and, get this, it starts tonight with Birmingham v Ipswich, two of the sides most heavily tipped for promotion. Elsewhere, the transfer merry-go-round keeps spinning fast and Manchester United have continued to rebuild their forward line by agreeing a £73.3m deal with RB Leipzig to sign Benjamin Sesko. The striker is on his way to Manchester to undergo a medical before finalising the move. A central midfielder is also on Ruben Amorim’s wish list so brace yourselves for news of that, more plot twists involving Alexander Isak as well as Newcastle’s attempts to sign anyone at all. And don’t forget that on Sunday, we’ll get the chance to see some of Liverpool’s exotic new signings in action as the champions take on FA Cup winners Crystal Palace in the FA Community Shield. Right, let’s get this going!
