  There is a painting that I think about often. The Madonna del Parto, a
  masterpiece painted by Piero della Francesca in about 1460, is housed in a
  dedicated museum in the Tuscan town of Monterchi. It depicts a heavily
  pregnant Virgin Mary flanked by two angels. To local women, this painting is
  considered a protector of fertility and the lives of pregnant women during
  birth. During the second world war, local women surrounded two men whom they
  had mistaken for Nazis intent on stealing it. In 1954, they led a protest
  against its proposed movement to Florence for an exhibition. I remember
  reading as a student that the women had lain down in the street to block its
  departure. I thought about those women again yesterday, as I walked around the
  Jenny Saville exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery, tracing the
  influence of the Renaissance on her work. Saville’s dialogue with great
  painters began when she was young and an art historian uncle took her to
  Venice. It has continued throughout her career, most notably in her motherhood
  pictures, which show her wrangling a baby, or both her babies, heavily
  influenced by Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. The ghosts of their Madonnas
  seem to linger in the sketch lines that swirl around Saville’s mother figure.
  One of her most famous works, the stunning, sculptural, charcoal and pastel
  Pietà I, is a result of her study of Michelangelo’s The Deposition. I’m
  worried I’ll lose you in my nerdiness, so back to the protesting women of
  Monterchi. In my early 20s, I marvelled that anybody could care so much about
  a Renaissance painting as to lie down in the street as these women had. Such
  art left me cold, and no doubt my personal lack of religion was a factor. I
  dismissed it as all geriatric-looking baby Jesuses, and people pointing and
  kneeling. I understood, academically, its importance – the dawn of
  perspective! I studied and analysed the Titians and the Michelangelos as
  required, even passed a Socratic oral examination in Italian about the works
  of Leonardo. Yet where I had the choice, I always veered towards the abstract
  and the contemporary. None of it spoke to me the way a Rothko or a Joan
  Mitchell did. I knew the problem was me: I just wasn’t getting it. That
  strange alchemy wherein some works of art fizz with resonance eluded me.
  Standing more than a decade later in Saville’s room of mother paintings, it
  seemed clear that my inability to “understand” certain paintings had been less
  about my irreligious upbringing and more about my lack of life experience.
  When I was 23, a man tried to kill me and the trauma of that seemed to partly
  manifest in a taste for the baroque (pretentious, yes, but we all work through
  our traumas using art, most commonly music. Consider this my death metal). I
  dragged my then boyfriend around Rome’s churches to look at Caravaggios; stood
  in front of Artemisia Gentileschi’s Judith Slaying Holofernes at the Uffizi
  and felt her rage. When I was younger, nothing felt more exposing than
  earnestness, so like many people in their 20s I hid my greenness behind an
  affected world-weary cynicism. But things happen in life. Significant,
  sometimes awful, things, and I think there’s also something about growing
  older that makes caring deeply and being open about it simply feel less
  embarrassing. As a young person, there was a closed-offness to the emotional
  complexity of certain experiences – not only death, but anything to do with
  pregnancy or motherhood. I didn’t want to go there. Then, around the time I
  started thinking about having a baby, I began looking at paintings of the
  Annunciation. The depiction of that moment when the young Virgin Mary is told
  by the angel Gabriel that she will have a child – lack of belief in virgin
  birth aside, the artistic distillation of that feeling, of how much life is
  about to change – became interesting to me almost overnight. Only more so once
  I found out I was pregnant. As a child, I had copied the angel from Fra
  Angelico’s Annunciation from a book of my mother’s, ignoring Mary entirely. As
  a woman standing in front of it in Florence, all I could focus on was the
  expression on her face. Seeing things in person helps, but so, I suspect, do
  hormones. This summer, a good friend discovered she was pregnant – it had
  happened so quickly that she was as shocked as I had been. I sent her an image
  of that painting, writing poetically that “she looks like she’s going to vom”.
  Perhaps I still have some way to go in my resistance to earnestness, but I
  wouldn’t return to my young, cynical self for anything. I’d rather be the
  person who, newly postpartum, wept at a Raphael Madonna, mortifying though it
  is. I didn’t cry at the Saville show, but I came close in front of Aleppo, her
  Pietà for the children of Syria, which seemed also to contain all the grief
  and the agony of the mothers of the Gazan children murdered by Israel. I
  understood that the women of Monterchi weren’t only acting to protect a
  masterpiece, but to protect, as they saw it, one another, and their babies.
  Being willing to be moved by art also means being willing to be moved by the
  pain of other people, even to put yourself at risk for them. To lie down, in
  other words, in the street. Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist.
  Her book Female, Nude – a novel about art, the body and female sexuality –
  will be published in 2026.
