  Vape sellers will have to pay for the disposal of the devices under plans
  announced by the government. Ministers said they would “end the UK’s throwaway
  culture” as they revealed measures to fund the recycling of electrical waste.
  Online vendors of electrical goods including microwaves and computers will
  have to contribute to the cost of recycling them at the end of their life,
  under a “polluter pays principle”. At the moment, UK companies cover the costs
  associated with the collection and processing of electrical waste, which
  ministers said placed them at a disadvantage compared with their online rivals
  based abroad. It is hoped the new measures will bring investment into
  recycling to stop these devices being fly-tipped into the countryside or
  littered on the street. Industry estimates by Material Focus, a non-profit
  aiming to improve electrical recycling in the UK, found more than 100,000
  tonnes of electricals such as irons and microwaves were binned across the UK
  each year. Levies placed on these online retailers would help improve the
  collection and treatment of waste items collected by local authorities or
  returned to retailers, and ensure there was increased investment in critical
  recycling infrastructure, the government said. Companies such as Amazon will
  have to register with the Environment Agency and report data on sales made by
  their overseas sellers in the UK, and this will be used to work out how much
  should be charged to finance the recycling of these objects. The circular
  economy minister, Mary Creagh, said: “We are committed to moving towards a
  circular economy in which we keep electricals from laptops to toasters in use
  for longer. “Ensuring online marketplaces pay their share for managing the
  cost of the electrical waste they generate will increase recycling and level
  the playing field for UK-based retailers, boosting growth and making the
  system fairer through our plan for change.” Electronics companies welcomed the
  change. Paula Coughlan, the chief sustainability officer at Currys, said: “We
  welcome this positive change that helps create a more level playing field for
  UK retailers. It is important that the responsibility to safely dispose of
  electronic waste is shared fairly, and we’re pleased the government has
  listened to us and other industry leaders. As well as making online
  marketplaces pay for the waste they create, we should be going further to set
  stretch targets and incentivise investment in cleaning it up too.” The
  government has introduced a new category for vapes to ensure the costs of
  their collection and treatment fall fairly on those who produce them.
  E-cigarettes, which have become more popular in recent years, contain valuable
  and critical materials such as lithium and copper. Material Focus has found
  the amount of rare earths thrown away in the past three years could have
  powered more than 16,000 electric vehicles. Scott Butler, the executive
  director of Material Focus, said: “We welcome the new vape category announced
  today, which provides a further opportunity to tighten up the environmental
  enforcement of vapes. By understanding how many vapes are being sold, [the
  government] can set targets to ensure that vape producers make their fair
  contribution to the costs of recycling these products.”
