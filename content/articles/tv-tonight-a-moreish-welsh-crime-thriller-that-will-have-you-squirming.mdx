  The Guest 9pm, BBC One A moreish Welsh crime thriller that will have you
  screaming at the screen. Ria (Gabrielle Creevy) is a cleaner who wants more
  from life; Fran (Eve Myles) is the enigmatic businesswoman who hires her.
  Suspicions are raised immediately when Fran seems keen to overstep the
  employer line and encourage Ria to make some big changes. Then a shocking
  accident happens and their relationship becomes twistier and darker. Hollie
  Richardson Panorama: The £170 Million Diamond Scam 8pm, BBC One An
  investigation into the mystery of the “vanishing” diamond dealer Vashi
  Domínguez. After securing £170m from investors for his luxury jewellery
  stores, his business went bust last year – and he was gone, along with the
  cash and most of the stock of diamonds. Richard Bilton unravels what was
  really happening. HR Disaster at Sea: The Piper Alpha Story 9pm, BBC Two A
  superb documentary series with the conclusion of intense inquiry testimonies
  from survivors of the fire on board a North Sea oil rig in 1988. As some
  families receive the worst possible news, attention turns to a search for
  answers and justice – a process that will not prove straightforward. Jack
  Seale I Am Martin Parr 9pm, BBC Four “I like to understand what people are
  like just by looking at them.” Martin Parr is one of Britain’s most beloved
  photographers, and his work and life are celebrated in Lee Shulman’s film that
  follows Parr on a road trip. Artist Grayson Perry, fellow photographer Bruce
  Gilden and others help to explain exactly how sharp his eye for the culture of
  British society is. HR Stacey Dooley Sleeps Over 9pm, U&amp;W Dooley’s take on
  the When Louis Met … format is both accessible and frequently eye-opening.
  This week, she meets Barrie Drewitt-Barlow, Britain’s first legally recognised
  gay dad, who is now a passionate advocate for paid surrogacy (which remains
  illegal in the UK). Hannah J Davies Elsbeth 9pm, Sky Witness This week’s guest
  murderer is St Denis Medical standout David Alan Grier, here dealing with
  adverse health outcomes as an imperious undertaker. But, when he bumps off his
  conspiracy theorist nephew, it brings him into the orbit of Elsbeth (Carrie
  Preston), the Columbo-style sleuth who relishes digging up the truth. Graeme
  Virtue
