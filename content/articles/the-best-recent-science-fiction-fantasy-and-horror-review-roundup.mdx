  Where the Axe Is Buried by Ray Nayler (W&amp;N, £20) The new from the
  award-winning author imagines a world in which some nations have undergone
  “rationalisation” by accepting AI governance; while in the Federation, under a
  brutally repressive regime, the human leader maintains his iron grip,
  downloading his mind into a new body when the old one begins to fail. Lilia
  was lucky to be allowed to leave the Federation for London, where she worked
  on a device to enable neural entanglement. This could be a powerful tool for
  changing – or controlling – society, and there are those who will stop at
  nothing to get their hands on it. At the heart of this story is a dissident
  book, The Forever Argument, asserting the necessity of opposition in any
  society: “It keeps us not only honest, but human. Without it, anyone is a
  monster.” Like the fictional text, this thought-provoking, fast-moving
  thriller is also a heartfelt call for resistance to oppressive regimes. The
  Phoenix Pencil Company by Allison King (4th Estate, £16.99) Monica, a talented
  coder in present-day America, worries about her beloved grandparents, now in
  their 90s. She decides to track down her grandmother Yun’s long-lost cousin
  Meng, who remained in China after Yun emigrated. Once close, the two women
  were divided by political history, like so many Chinese families in the
  mid-20th century. Monica is puzzled when her attempt to connect with Meng
  results only in the gift of a single wooden pencil, but Yun understands.
  Before it is too late, she must tell her story – and reveal to Monica the
  secret power possessed by the women of the family, once used to reclaim the
  words written with the pencils their company sold in wartime Shanghai. The
  gift brought hardship and heartbreak, the shame of being forced by government
  officials to betray the secrets of people who bought their pencils, but also
  chances to preserve precious letters and poems that would otherwise have been
  lost. This unusual idea provides the single shining thread of fantasy
  illuminating an absorbing family saga interwoven with reflections on the power
  of stories, and who has the right to decide what is preserved or permitted to
  remain secret. Hemlock &amp; Silver by T Kingfisher (Tor, £22) The latest from
  the Nettle &amp; Bone author is narrated by Anja, whose expertise is finding
  antidotes to poisons. She’s summoned by the king, who thinks his daughter Snow
  is being poisoned. Her symptoms don’t match any known illness, and there are
  no suspects or motive; the determinedly rational Anja eventually realises the
  solution will only be found through a magical mirror. There are echoes of
  classic fairytales in an original, highly entertaining story that slips easily
  between humour and horror, action and romance, and introduces a wonderfully
  sarcastic cat. Secret Lives of the Dead by Tim Lebbon (Titan, £9.99) It seems
  like a cool adventure to BB and Matt when Jodi suggests they break into a
  derelict old house in search of rumoured treasure. But a brutal killer has
  been following the same rumours, on the trail of a grotesque relic that might
  remove the curse put on his family generations ago; he’ll kill anyone who
  crosses his path. Tightly written and grippingly suspenseful, this
  fast-moving, violent tale is not for the faint of heart. The Course of the
  Heart by M John Harrison (Serpent’s Tail, £10.99) Three Cambridge students
  follow an occult master into an English meadow to perform a ritual that leaves
  them haunted for the rest of their lives. Beginning with echoes of Arthur
  Machen and MR James, the novel soon dispenses with genre standards, merging
  gritty realism with dreamy fantasy and eerie horror. A groundbreaking work,
  written with a painterly eye for light and shade, it has been a cult classic
  since its first publication in 1992; this reprint should reach a much wider
  audience.
