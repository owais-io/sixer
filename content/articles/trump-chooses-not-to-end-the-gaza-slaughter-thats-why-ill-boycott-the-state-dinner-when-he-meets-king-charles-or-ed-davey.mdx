  A mother holding a baby boy so thin from starvation you can see his skeleton.
  The lifeless bodies of children killed while queueing for water. Emaciated
  hostages, still held captive by Hamas almost two years after those appalling
  terror attacks. These images and countless more have horrified us all in
  recent months. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza must stop. The famine must end.
  The hostages must be returned home. There is one man, more than anyone else,
  who has the power to make it happen. One man who could pick up the phone to
  Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, and tell him to end the aid
  blockade that is causing suffering and starvation on such an appalling scale.
  One man who could use his influence on Qatar and other Gulf states to help
  secure the urgent release of Hamas’s hostages. Donald Trump could do those
  things today if he chose to. He has more power than anyone else finally to
  force a ceasefire and put Israel and Palestine on the path to a lasting peace
  with a two-state solution. But so far, he’s decided not to. Instead, he’s
  given Netanyahu his full support. Last week, when he was making his bogus
  boasts about ending six wars, Trump said Ukraine is “the only one left” –
  showing he doesn’t even see what’s happening in Gaza as a war he wants to
  stop. In three weeks’ time, Trump will touch down in the UK for his second
  state visit, which will include a state banquet at Windsor Castle hosted by
  King Charles. One of the great privileges of being the leader of my party is
  that my wife, Emily, and I are invited to attend state banquets. Receiving an
  invitation from the king is an enormous honour, and I take very seriously my
  duty to our sovereign. As a member of parliament, I have proudly sworn by
  almighty God that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty
  King Charles, his heirs and successors. To refuse an invitation like this goes
  against all of my instincts. But having thought and prayed long and hard about
  it with Emily, I have come to the conclusion that on this occasion I must
  refuse. This is not about the many other issues on which I profoundly disagree
  with President Trump. I think Keir Starmer is right to engage with him,
  although I do wish he were tougher with Trump on everything from tariffs to
  Vladimir Putin. Indeed, I argued last January that we should use the offer of
  a state visit – something Trump so desperately craves – as leverage to
  persuade him to do the right thing. I believe the US is an important ally, no
  matter who is in the White House, and I strongly believe in sitting down and
  negotiating with the president, no matter our disagreements. So what it comes
  down to now is this: I fear we could have a situation where Trump comes to our
  country, is honoured with a lavish dinner at one of our finest palaces, and
  nobody reminds him that he has the power to stop the horrifying starvation,
  death and captivities in Gaza. And no one uses this moment to demand that the
  US president pick up that phone to Netanyahu and the Qataris and do the right
  thing. I feel a responsibility to do whatever I can to ensure the people in
  Gaza are not forgotten during the pomp and ceremony, and to ensure the UK
  makes Trump’s personal responsibility for securing peace in Israel and
  Palestine an issue. Boycotting the state banquet is not something I ever
  wanted to do, but I believe it is the only way I can send a message to both
  Trump and Starmer that they cannot close their eyes and wish this away. Donald
  Trump must act now to end the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and get the
  hostages released. Ed Davey is leader of the Liberal Democrats
