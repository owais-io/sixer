  Donald Trump called on top Federal Reserve officials to seize control from its
  chair, Jerome Powell, if he fails to cut interest rates, stepping up his
  extraordinary attacks on the central bank’s independence. The US president
  called Powell “a stubborn MORON” in a series of critical social media posts on
  Friday, days after the Fed held rates steady for the fifth consecutive time.
  It comes as Trump faces heightened questions over the impact of his aggressive
  economic policy, and the White House presses forward with plans for a fresh
  wave of tariffs next week. Hours before the federal government released data
  which underlined a significant deterioration in the jobs market, Trump again
  broke with precedent to pin blame on the Fed – and urge it to change course.
  “Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell, a stubborn MORON, must substantially lower interest
  rates, NOW,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, his social network. “IF HE CONTINUES
  TO REFUSE, THE BOARD SHOULD ASSUME CONTROL, AND DO WHAT EVERYONE KNOWS HAS TO
  BE DONE!” The Fed chair does not unilaterally set interest rates, which are
  decided by its rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. Presidents
  typically respect its independence, leaving the central bank to make an
  objective decision – without political interference – about the best policy on
  interest rates for the US economy. “Too Little, Too Late. Jerome ‘Too Late’
  Powell is a disaster,” Trump wrote, minutes after Friday’s lackluster jobs
  report. “DROP THE RATE! The good news is that Tariffs are bringing Billions of
  Dollars into the USA!” Powell has repeatedly argued that the best approach for
  the Fed right now is to wait and see the impact of Trump’s aggressive tariff
  strategy before cutting rates. But Trump has increasingly used Powell, whom he
  appointed during his first term, as something of a piñata – repeatedly
  accusing him of damaging the US economy. Two members of the Fed’s rate-setting
  committee dissented from its other policymakers’ call to hold rates steady
  this week, and – to the president’s delight – published their reasons on
  Friday. “STRONG DISSENTS ON FED BOARD,” Trump wrote, claiming: “IT WILL ONLY
  GET STRONGER!” By Friday evening, however, Trump’s tone appeared to have
  changed as he told Newsmax during an interview that Powell will “most likely”
  stay in his position. Trump said he would remove Powell “in a heartbeat” and
  said the Fed’s interest rate was too high but added that others have said
  Powell’s removal would “disturb the market”. “He gets out in seven or eight
  months and I’ll put somebody else in,” Trump said. On Friday afternoon,
  another member of the committee abruptly resigned. Adriana D Kugler, whose
  term was set to expire in January, announced she would step down next week.
  She did not provide a reason for the move, and will return to Georgetown
  University as a professor in the fall. “I am especially honored to have served
  during a critical time in achieving our dual mandate of bringing down prices
  and keeping a strong and resilient labor market,” Kugler said in a statement.
  Her resignation creates a vacancy for the White House to fill. Reuters
