  Sellers of fake Botox jabs could be jailed for up to two years, the UK’s
  medicine watchdog has warned, as it increases efforts to track down those
  flouting the law. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency
  (MHRA) says it is cracking down on the trade of unlicensed botulinum toxin
  products after a spate of botulism cases across England thought to be linked
  to them. In total, 41 people are thought to have been affected by the
  potentially fatal condition between 4 June and 6 August 2025. Botulism affects
  the nervous system and can cause paralysis if left untreated, according to the
  NHS. The MHRA says it hopes to drive up awareness that anyone caught selling
  or supplying unlicensed botulinum toxin faces up to two years in prison and
  unlimited fines, as set out in the Human Medicines Regulations 2012, and is
  deploying more resources to crack down on those breaking the law. “Criminals
  are exploiting the popularity of cosmetic treatments by peddling dangerous,
  unlicensed products, putting profit before safety,” said Andy Morling, the
  head of the MHRA’s criminal enforcement unit. “Anyone involved in the supply
  of unlicensed botulinum toxin – whether through organised networks or informal
  sales from kitchen tables, hair salons or via social media – is breaking the
  law and endangering lives. The 41 individuals we’ve seen between June and
  August left seriously ill represent the devastating human cost of this trade.
  “We are working across the country to identify those responsible, seize
  illegal products, and bring cases to court. We use the full range of our
  enforcement powers and techniques to shut down these operations and bring
  offenders to justice.” The move follows previous warnings by the watchdog for
  consumers to take care when seeking cosmetic injections to ensure a qualified
  person is carrying them out and using the correct jabs. Earlier this month,
  ministers announced plans that will mean clinics will need to be licensed by
  their local authority to offer anti-wrinkle injections and fillers – and must
  meet strict standards to obtain such authorisation. The MHRA says that since
  May 2023, its criminal enforcement unit, working with Border Force, has seized
  more than 4,700 vials of unlicensed botulinum toxin, with most products
  originating in South Korea. Among the products seized is Innotox – a
  Botox-like medication that is not licensed for use in the UK, and is being
  sold illegally online. The situation is causing concern among experts, who say
  Innotox’s liquid formulation has resulted in some people attempting DIY
  injections – a risky approach they warn can lead to eyelid droops, infections,
  tissue damage and even botulism. Aenone Harper-Machin, a consultant plastic
  surgeon and spokesperson for the British Association of Plastic,
  Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons (Bapras), said she welcomed the MHRA’s
  “decisive action” against the illegal supply and use of unlicensed botulinum
  toxin products. “These recent cases of serious illness linked to illicit
  treatments highlight the urgent need to protect the public from unsafe,
  unregulated cosmetic procedures carried out by untrained individuals,” she
  said. “Botulinum toxin is a prescription-only medicine that should only be
  administered in a clinical environment by qualified healthcare professionals.
  When used improperly, it can cause devastating and even life-threatening
  complications,” Harper-Machin added. “At Bapras, we strongly support efforts
  to ensure that all aesthetic procedures are safe, evidence-based, and
  delivered by appropriately trained medical professionals. We urge anyone
  considering cosmetic treatment to verify their practitioner’s medical
  credentials and ensure treatments are carried out in regulated settings using
  licensed products.”
