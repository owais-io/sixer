  Time to wrap up… River Island’s rescue restructure has received approval from
  a high court judge, a move which will help stop the fashion retailer from
  falling into administration. The plan received approval from a high court
  judge on Friday after the majority of creditors gave their backing to the plan
  earlier this week. The bidding battle for NHS landlord Assura also intensified
  today. Its US suitor KKR lobbied the board to accept its offer, while the
  competition watchdog stepped up its investigation of Assura’s £1.7bn takeover
  by a rival UK healthcare investor. Assura is still recommending that its
  shareholders accept the PHP offer. Meanwhile, the chief economist at the Bank
  of England has warned that “persistent inflation” could slow the pace of
  future interest rate cuts. Huw Pill is one of four members of the monetary
  policy committee who voted against the rate cut to 4% this week. Profits at
  Jaguar Land Rover slumped in its quarter ended in June, as the British luxury
  carmaker has grappled with US trade tariffs and a slowdown in sales.
  Underlying pre-tax profit dropped by 49% to £351m in the quarter, with revenue
  falling by 9% to £6.6bn, thanks partly to a temporary pause in exports to the
  US and the planned wind down of older Jaguar models before the launch of new
  electric models next year. JLR said US tariffs had a “direct and material
  impact on profitability and cash flow in the period”, but that the “US-UK
  trade deal will significantly reduce the financial impact of US tariffs going
  forward”. The car maker, which is owned by the Indian group Tata Motors, said
  last month that it would axe up to 500 management jobs in the UK, impacting
  1.5% of its UK workforce. Chief executive Adrian Mardell said the results came
  amid “challenging global economic conditions”. We are grateful to the UK and
  US governments for delivering at speed the new UK-US trade deal, which will
  lessen the significant US tariff impact in subsequent quarters, as will, in
  due course, the EU-US trade deal announced on July 27.” River Island has
  secured approval for a restructure plan designed to stop the fashion retailer
  from falling into administration. The plan received approval from a high court
  judge on Friday after the majority of creditors gave their backing to the plan
  earlier this week. Ben Lewis, the retailer’s chief executive, said approval of
  the plan would enable the company to “align our store estate to our customers’
  needs. We are pleased that River Island’s restructuring plan has been approved
  by the High Court. We have a clear transformation strategy to ensure the
  long-term viability of the business, and this decision gives us a strong
  platform to deliver this. Recent improvements in our fashion offer and
  shopping experience are starting to show results, and the restructuring plan
  will enable us to align our store estate to our customers’ needs.” You can
  read the full story by my colleague Sarah Butler here: Huw Pill, chief
  economist at the Bank of England and one of four members of the monetary
  policy committee who voted against the interest rate cut this week, has warned
  “persistent inflation” could slow the pace of future rate cuts. Pill said in
  an online presentation to businesses: There’s still a little bit further
  downward to go with Bank Rate. I think the pace at which those downward moves
  perhaps go forward is a little bit less clear than the pace that we’ve seen
  over the last year. On Thursday, the Bank of England’s monetary policy
  committee (MPC) voted to cut the base rate by a quarter point to 4%, its
  lowest level for more than two years. It was one of the closest decisions
  since its independence more than 25 years ago, with the vote split 5-4. Pill
  was one of the MPC members who voted to keep rates unchanged. The latest
  official figures show that inflation rose to 3.6% in June, ahead of the Bank’s
  2% target. Pill said: There is some shift in the balance of risks on
  inflation. There is a risk of spillover into more persistent inflation. When
  inflation is high due to external forces, we need to be aware of the risk they
  might affect domestic price-setting. …Our mandate is that we will get
  inflation to 2%, that’s the target, on a sustainable rate. We will do whatever
  we need with the Bank rate to do that. They may be a bit lower than where we
  are but nothing is set. On Thursday, the Bank warned that rising food prices
  could dirve to inflation to 4% in September. The Competition and Markets
  Authority (CMA) has cleared Boeing’s $4.7bn (£3.5bn) deal to buy Spirit
  AeroSystems, the parts supplier it spun out nearly 20 years ago. The US plane
  manufacturer agreed to buy Spirit last year in an all-stock deal which valued
  it at $4.7bn. The total transaction value, including Spirit’s net debt, was
  $8.3bn. The CMA started to investigate the deal in June to determine whether
  it would affect competition in the UK. It has not yet released the full
  details behind its decision but it has said it has cleared the acquisition.
  The deal to bring Spirit back in-house marks a move away from Boeing
  outsourcing key components for its planes. Spirit was spun off from the
  business in 2005, but last year it still accounted for about 70% of all of its
  orders. Around 25% came from Boeing’s rival, Airbus. Turning to the world of
  healthcare, shares in the US pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly slumped by 14%
  last night, after disappointing results from its obesity pill. Eli Lilly said
  on Thursday that patients taking its pill orforglipron lost an average of
  12.4% of their body weight, at the lower end of expectations. People taking a
  placebo lost 0.9%. Shares in rival Novo Nordisk, the Danish drugmaker behind
  the Ozempic and Wegovy weight-loss drugs, are up 4% this morning. Elsewhere in
  the sector, FTSE 100 pharmaceutical company GSK said this morning that it will
  receive $370m as part of a US patent settlement between CureVac and BioNTech
  related to its Covid-19 jab. It will also receive a 1% royalty on future US
  sales of influenza, Covid-19 and related combination mRNA vaccine products by
  BioNTech and Pfizer. Shares in GSK are up about 1% this morning There has been
  another twist in the attempted takeover of the NHS landlord Assura: this
  morning the competition watchdog blocked the full integration of Primary
  Health Properties (PHP) with Assura, as it investigates the £1.79 bllion deal.
  A bidding war for the company between PHP and the private equity firm KKR had
  been going on since February – but in June Assura’s board recommended a cash
  offer from PHP which valued it at £1.79bn. But the Competition and Markets
  Authority (CMA) launched the first stage of its investigation into the deal
  last month, and has now served an initial enforcement order on the firms. KKR
  still argues that its bid for Assura is superior to the offer from Primary
  Health. The firm said it had met with Assura in recent days to lobby for its
  own cash takeover of the company. Assura owns a property portfolio worth about
  £3.1bn, including a number of NHS buildings such as doctors’ surgeries. Oil
  prices are headed for their worst week since June, as investors prepare for
  the possibility of talks between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, and as the
  latest round of US tariffs weigh on the global economic outlook. Brent crude
  futures are on track to fall by around 4% this week, currently trading at
  $66.36. West Texas Intermediate crude futures are on track to fall by about 6%
  compared with last week. Analysts think this is largely because of the impact
  that Trump’s latest tariffs will have on the global economy. This week, more
  than 60 countries were hit by sweeping “reciprocal” rates, which range from
  10% to 39%, 40% and 41% for Switzerland, Brazil and Syria. A widely expected
  meeting between the US president and the Russian leader is also affecting the
  market, with investors anticipating that eased sanctions on Russia could
  increase the oil supply. This week Trump increased tariffs on India, in a move
  he described as punishment for continuing to buy Russian oil. The UK’s blue
  chip FTSE 100 stock index has opened slightly higher this morning, up 0.26%.
  JD Sports is the strongest riser in the index, with its shares up 2.2%. It is
  followed by Glencore, with its shares up 1.9% after news this week that the
  miner decided to keep its primary listing in London, ditching a possible plan
  to move to New York. The mid-cap FTSE 250 index is not performing as well,
  down by about 0.1%. TBC Bank is the worst performer, with its shares falling
  by as much as 12% in early trading, though the Georgian bank reported a 5%
  rise in its profits for the second quarter, as well as a new buyback.
  Meanwhile, the pound is slipping against the US dollar this morning, even
  after the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee (MPC) voted to cut its
  key base rate by a quarter-point to 4% yesterday. The pound is down 0.13%
  against the dollar, although it is still above $1.34. While the Bank has cut
  rates, it was one of the closest decisions since its independence more than 25
  years ago with a 5-4 vote split. The market has lowered its expectations of
  another quarter cut point this year, in contrast to growing expectations that
  the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in the US next month. On Thursday,
  Donald Trump said he will nominate Stephen Miran to the Fed’s board of
  governors for four months, and reports suggest that current governor
  Christopher Waller is the favourite candidate to serve as the next Fed chair.
  Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, says both men are viewed
  as dovish, which should align with Trump’s ambition for lower rates. However,
  the US 2-year yield has barely reacted—reminding us (again) that rate cuts
  don’t always lower borrowing costs if they aren’t seen as credible or
  justified. Remember last September, when the Fed unexpectedly slashed rates by
  50bps? The 2-year yield jumped nearly 30bps over the following two months. For
  now, markets still expect the next cut to come in September, keeping the
  S&amp;P 500 near record highs despite trade uncertainty and policy
  inconsistency. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business,
  the financial markets and the world economy. Gold futures hit a record high on
  Friday after a Financial Times report that the United States has imposed
  tariffs on imports of one-kilo gold bars, a move that is expected to ramp up
  pressure on Switzerland, the biggest precious metal hubs in the world. The FT
  has seen a letter from the Customs Border Protection agency which said
  one-kilo and 100 ounce gold bars should be classified under a customs code
  subject to higher tariffs. One-kilo bars are the most popular form of the
  metal traded on Comex, the biggest gold futures market, and make up most of
  Switzerland’s bullion exports to the US. US gold futures rose by. 1.3% at
  $3,499.30, after hitting an all-time high of $3,534.10. Meanwhile, the price
  spread between New York futures and spot prices widened by about $100. It
  marks another blow for Switzerland, which Donald Trump has hit with a shock
  39% export tariff. Swiss companies, whose exports to the US account for about
  one-sixth of their total foreign sales, face one of the steepest tariff rates
  in Trump’s trade war regime. Only Laos, Myanmar and Syria had higher figures,
  at 40-41%. The EU and the UK have negotiated 15% and 10% respectively.
  Switzerland exported $61.5bn of gold to the US in the 12 months ending in
  June, the FT said. This would be subject to a further $24bn in levies under
  Switzerland’s 39% tariff rate, which came into effect on Thursday, according
  to the report. The agenda 9am BST: UN Food and Agricultural Organization Price
