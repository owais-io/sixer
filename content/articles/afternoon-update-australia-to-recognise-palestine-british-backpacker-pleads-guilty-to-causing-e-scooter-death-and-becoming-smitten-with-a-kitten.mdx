  Good afternoon. The Australian government will recognise a Palestinian state
  at the United Nations general assembly next month, Anthony Albanese has
  confirmed, saying a two-state solution was “humanity’s best hope to break the
  cycle of violence in the Middle East and to bring an end to the conflict,
  suffering and starvation in Gaza.” In a written statement, Albanese and Penny
  Wong claimed Benjamin Netanyahu’s government was “extinguishing the prospect
  of a two-state solution” in threatening to occupy Gaza and expand West Bank
  settlements. Albanese said he spoke to Netanyahu last week and told him “the
  situation in Gaza has gone beyond the world’s worst fears”, citing an
  unacceptable civilian death toll. More than 60,000 civilians have been killed
  during Israel’s campaign in Gaza, local health authorities report. Over the
  weekend, five Al Jazeera journalists, including prominent reporter Anas
  al-Sharif, were killed by an airstrike on a journalists’ tent outside al-Shifa
  hospital in Gaza, in what the Israel Defense Forces have admitted was a
  targeted assassination. The IDF claimed al-Sharif had “served as the head of a
  terrorist cell” for Hamas. Human rights advocates said Israel’s claim lacked
  evidence. Top news English backpacker pleads guilty to causing death of Perth
