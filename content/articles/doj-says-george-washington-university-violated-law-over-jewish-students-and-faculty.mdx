  Donald Trump’s administration says it has determined that George Washington
  University (GWU) has violated federal civil rights law, making it the latest
  higher educational institution to be targeted by the White House over last
  spring’s campus protests against Israeli military strikes in Gaza. In an
  announcement on Tuesday, the Trump-led justice department accused the
  Washington DC-based university of failing to take “meaningful action” to
  combat antisemitism during demonstrations there. A statement that GWU
  spokesperson Shannon McClendon provided to the Guardian on Tuesday said it
  “condemns antisemitism, which has absolutely no place on our campuses or in a
  civil and humane society. “Moreover, our actions clearly demonstrate our
  commitment to addressing antisemitic actions and promoting an inclusive campus
  environment by upholding a safe, respectful, and accountable environment,”
  McClendon’s statement said. “We have taken appropriate action under university
  policy and the law to hold individuals or organizations accountable, including
  during the encampment, and we do not tolerate behavior that threatens our
  community or undermines meaningful dialogue.” A statement from the justice
  department claimed that an investigation found that GWU was “deliberately
  indifferent to the hostile educational environment for Jewish,
  American-Israeli, and Israeli students and faculty” during the pro-Palestinian
  campus protests in April and May 2024. In a letter to GWU’s president, the
  justice department alleged finding “numerous incidents of Jewish students
  being harassed, abused, intimidated and assaulted by protesters” – and that
  the university “was deliberately indifferent to the complaints it received,
  the misconduct that occurred, and the harms that were suffered by its students
  and faculty” in violation of a provision of the US Civil Rights Act
  prohibiting programs that receive federal aid from discrimination on the basis
  of race, color or national origin. The justice department asserted that it had
  given GWU the “opportunity to resolve this matter through a voluntary
  resolution agreement” to “ensure immediate remediation of these issues and
  related reforms to prevent the recurrence of discrimination, harassment, and
  abuse”. The administration’s letter gave the university until 22 August to “to
  indicate whether GWU has interest in such a dialogue”. McClendon’s statement
  said GWU on Tuesday was reviewing the administration’s letter “to respond in a
  timely manner”. But McClendon’s statement did make it a point to say: “We have
  worked diligently with members of [GWU]’s Jewish community, as well as Jewish
  community organizations, city and federal authorities to protect the
  [university] community from antisemitism and we remain committed to working
  with them to ensure every student has the right to equal educational
  opportunities without fear of harassment or abuse.” As reported by Reuters,
  protesters who were part of the 2024 campus demonstrations last year –
  including the group Jewish Voice for Peace and other Jewish groups – have
  accused the US government of conflating their criticism of Israel’s
  government, the country’s military assaults in Gaza, and Zionism as
  antisemitism. Trump at the beginning of his second presidency in January
  nonetheless signed an executive order purporting to “combat antisemitism”. And
  in March, the administration warned at least 60 universities about possible
  action over alleged violations of federal civil rights laws related to
  antisemitism. In July, Columbia agreed to pay $200m as part of a settlement to
  resolve government investigations into allegations that the school violated
  federal anti-discrimination laws by failing to protect students from
  antisemitic harassment on campus. The agreement also reportedly restored more
  than $400m in research grants to the university. And on 6 August, the Trump
  administration suspended $584m in federal funding for the University of
  California, Los Angeles (UCLA) over similar allegations of civil rights
  violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action. The administration
  accused UCLA of “acting with deliberate indifference in creating a hostile
  educational environment for Jewish and Israeli students”. The UC system’s
  president has said that it has agreed to talks with the administration over
  the allegations against UCLA. In April, Democratic congressman Jerry Nadler of
  New York publicly condemned Trump linking antisemitism to his crackdown on US
  universities. Nadler said that the “president is weaponizing the real pain
  American Jews face to advance his desire to wield control over the
  truth-seeking academic institutions that stand as a bulwark against
  authoritarianism”.
