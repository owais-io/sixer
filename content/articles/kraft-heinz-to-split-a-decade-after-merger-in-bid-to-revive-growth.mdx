  Kraft Heinz, the US company behind kitchen staples such as Philadelphia cheese
  and Heinz tomato ketchup, has announced plans to split into two independent
  businesses a decade after it was created in a mega merger. The Chicago-based
  packaged food group said it would separate into two publicly traded companies
  through a tax-free spin-off to try to reduce complexity and improve financial
  performance after years of falling sales. The breakup will undo the 2015
  merger of Kraft and Heinz, engineered by the veteran US investor Warren
  Buffett and the Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital, creating a $45bn
  multinational two years after the pair took Heinz private. The names of the
  two new companies are yet to be determined. One of them – provisionally called
  Global Taste Elevation Co – will mostly focus on sauces, spreads and
  seasonings, with brands such as Heinz, Philadelphia and Kraft Mac &amp;
  Cheese, generating annual sales of more than $15bn (£11bn), based on 2024
  figures. Kraft Heinz is looking for a chief executive for this new business.
  The other, now known as North American Grocery Co and led by the Kraft Heinz
  chief executive, Carlos Abrams-Rivera, will concentrate on grocery staples
  such as Oscar Mayer meats, Lunchables boxed meals and Kraft Singles processed
  cheese, and will have annual sales of more than $10bn. Miguel Patricio, the
  executive chair of Kraft Heinz, said: “Kraft Heinz’s brands are iconic and
  beloved, but the complexity of our current structure makes it challenging to
  allocate capital effectively, prioritise initiatives and drive scale in our
  most promising areas.” Heinz was founded by by Henry J Heinz in Pittsburgh in
  1869 to specialise in sauces and condiments. Kraft grew out of a wholesale
  cheese delivery business set up in Chicago by James L Kraft in 1903. Three
  years before the merger, Kraft span off its snack division, which was renamed
  Mondelez International. Buffett later admitted that he had been “wrong in a
  couple of ways on Kraft Heinz”, saying he had “overpaid for Kraft”. The
  breakup is expected to be completed in the second half of next year. It comes
  after other big US companies broke themselves up this decade, including
  Kellogg Company, Warner Bros Discovery, Honeywell and General Electric. Like
  other packaged food makers, Kraft Heinz has been hit by high food ingredient
  costs, and a shift among consumers towards healthier, more affordable snacks
  and condiments. Its share price rose by 2.7% in pre-market trading, after
  losing more than a fifth of its value in the past 12 months. Russ Mould, the
  investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, said: “The demerger at Kellogg
  in 2023 unlocked some value and perhaps Kraft Heinz is looking to cook up
  something similar, after a 75% slump in the company’s share price since the
  merger between HJ Heinz and Kraft back in July 2015.”
