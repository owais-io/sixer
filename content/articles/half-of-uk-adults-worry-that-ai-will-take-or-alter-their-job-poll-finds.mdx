  Half of adults in the UK are concerned about the impact of artificial
  intelligence on their job, according to a poll, as union leaders call for a
  “step change” in the country’s approach to new technologies. Job losses or
  changes to terms and conditions were the biggest worries for the 51% of 2,600
  adults surveyed for the Trades Union Congress who said they were concerned
  about the technology. AI is a particular concern for workers aged between 25
  and 34, with nearly two-thirds (62%) of those surveyed reporting such worries.
  The TUC poll was released as a string of large employers – including BT,
  Amazon , and Microsoft – have said in recent months that advances in AI could
  lead them to cut jobs. Britain’s job market is slowing amid a cooling economy,
  with the UK’s official jobless rate at a four-year high of 4.7%, although most
  economists do not believe this is linked to an acceleration in investment in
  AI. The TUC believes AI technologies can benefit workers and help improve
  public services, but is calling on the government to involve workers and trade
  unions in AI as it is rolled out across workplaces, in order to protect jobs
  and provide training to people whose roles are replaced by AI. Half of those
  surveyed (50%) said they wanted a say in how AI is used in workplaces and
  across the wider economy, rather than leaving it to businesses, while only 17%
  of respondents opposed this. As part of its plan for AI, the TUC is calling
  for conditions to be attached to the billions of pounds of public money being
  spent on AI research and development, to ensure workers are not replaced by
  new technologies. In addition, it wants assurances that workers will receive a
  “digital dividend” of the productivity gains achieved through AI, by requiring
  companies to invest in workforce skills and training, by improving pay and
  conditions for employees and by empowering workers to shape companies’
  decision making, including workers on boards. The union body warns that
  without such guardrails, where workers are allowed to determine when and how
  AI is used, the increased use of new technologies could lead to “rampant
  inequality”, a deterioration in working conditions and greater social unrest.
  The UK’s social security and skills systems should also be strengthened, the
  TUC said, to help to retain and reskill workers whose jobs are put at risk by
  AI. The TUC’s assistant general secretary, Kate Bell, said: “AI could have
  transformative potential, and if developed properly, workers can benefit from
  the productivity gains this technology may bring.” She added: “The alternative
  is bleak. Left unmanaged and in the wrong hands, the AI revolution could
  entrench rampant inequality as jobs are degraded or displaced, and
  shareholders get richer.”
