  On a July evening in Alexandra, a small town in New Zealand’s South Island,
  the temperature is a chilly 3C. While most of the town is in quiet darkness,
  at Ice Inline Molyneux Park, the lights are on and the banter is abundant.
  It’s a social curling night, and the shouts of “sweeeep!” can be heard from
  the car park. Players from teams with names such as the “Plonkers”, “Too Dam
  Cold” and “Doome and Broom” gather on the outdoor ice rink, sweeping furiously
  as 11kg curling stones move across the ice. L-R: A collection of enamel badges
  from curling competitions and tournaments. Curling stones ready to be put away
  after a Thursday night social curling game in Alexandra. Crampit, or outdoor
  curling, is a sport that dates back to the 1500s in Scotland, where it was
  traditionally played on frozen lochs. Curling was brought to Central Otago in
  New Zealand by Scottish goldminers, and was a way to pass the time when the
  water was frozen and they couldn’t work. The first reported curling game in
  the region was held in 1878. In these rural communities, many people are
  involved with the sport. Players come from across Central Otago to play in
  Alexandra and also Naseby. They lead busy lives, mostly in agriculture. Ken
  Gillespie, a semi-retired sheep and beef farmer from Oturehua, says “often the
  only time you see these people is when you’re on the ice”. Ken Gillespie from
  the Rough Ridge Curling Club. Each curling club has its own colours or tartan,
  and players wear corresponding tam-o’-shanters (jimmy hats) as well as a
  matching woollen jumper. Many of these clubs have been around for more than
  100 years. An old skate hire hut next to the Centennial Ponds in Naseby.
  “There’s a lot of etiquette involved in it and the way you conduct yourself on
  the ice. It’s very, very competitive but there’s always a lot of respect on
  the ice,” says Gillespie, who’s been curling for more than 50 years. Swearing
  and the use of titles isn’t allowed, meaning that players must be referred to
  by their first names only. The Idaburn Trophy was held on the Centennial Ponds
  in Naseby. The Idaburn Trophy is a daylong curling tournament where teams are
  formed from curling clubs within the Naseby or Idaburn Curling Councils. The
  sport doesn’t have any umpires and instead each team is expected to keep
  score, politeness and good sportsmanship are prioritised, and the banter
  between teams is lighthearted. When someone throws a “good stone”, they will
  often head to the sidelines for a swig of beer or shot of whisky alongside
  their opponent. But Gillespie says he’s never seen anyone “under the weather
  on the ice”. Russell ‘Rusty’ Nevill wears his Poolburn Curling Club jimmy hat
  and jumper. “You only get a drink when you’re invited to by your skipper, or
  if your opposing team was playing very well, and the person you’re playing
  against was curling well, their skip will say you better take your mate
  (opponent) for a drink.” Brett Gare, a local haymaker who plays for Chatto
  Creek, says he loves curling for the “great camaraderie” as well as the
  opportunity to “meet a lot of new people”. Opponents Russell ‘Rusty’ Nevill
  (left) and Brett take a break for a shot of whisky and a catch up during the
  Jerry Sanders knockout tournament where teams from the Idaburn Curling Council
  play against each other for a 2.5 hour game of outdoor (crampit) curling. Ida
  Valley sheep farmer Russell “Rusty” Nevill plays for the Poolburn Curling
  Club, and his son, Jed Nevill, represented New Zealand in indoor curling at
  the Olympic Winter Youth Games in 2024. They are making sure the passion for
  the sport gets passed to the next generation. Bruce Kissel coaches Year 1
  students from The Terrace School through curling for the first time at the
  indoor curling rink at Ice Inline. Kissel introduces over a 1000 local
  schoolchildren to curling each year in Alexandra. Bruce Kissel was introduced
  to curling in the 1990s and has been playing ever since. For nearly two
  decades, Kissel has also been coaching children from local primary schools.
  Each season, about 1,500 children learn the basics of the sport. He hopes
  these programmes will pass the rules and love of the game on to young people
  “so that it is not lost through time”.
