  US president Donald Trump may meet with Russian leader Vladimir Putin as early
  as next week to discuss the war in Ukraine, White House officials have said.
  The development comes as senior administration officials have also warned that
  serious “impediments” remain to achieving a ceasefire. Secretary of state
  Marco Rubio said he was hopeful the progress could lead to a meeting between
  Putin and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy in future, but that he did not
  want to overstate progress made during US special envoy Steve Witkoff’s visit
  to Moscow. “What we have is a better understanding of the conditions under
  which Russia would be willing to end the war,” he said. The US would then need
  to compare that with “what the Ukrainians are willing to accept”. Here are
