  anxiety’

  News has never been more accessible – but for some, that’s exactly the
  problem. Flooded with information and relentless updates, more and more people
  around the world are tuning out. The reasons vary: for some it’s the sheer
  volume of news, for others the emotional toll of negative headlines or a
  distrust of the media itself. In online forums devoted to mindfulness and
  mental health, people discuss how to step back, from setting limits to cutting
  the news out entirely. “Now that I don’t watch the news, I just don’t have
  that anxiety. I don’t have dread,” said Mardette Burr, an Arizona retiree who
  says she stopped watching the news about eight years ago. “There were times
  that I’d be up at two or three o’clock in the morning upset about something
  that was going on in the world that I just didn’t have a lot of control over.”
  She’s not alone. Globally, news avoidance is at a record high, according to an
  annual survey by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism published
  in June. This year, 40% of respondents, surveyed across nearly 50 countries,
  said they sometimes or often avoid the news, up from 29% in 2017 and the joint
  highest figure recorded. The number was even higher in the US, at 42%, and in
  the UK, at 46%. Across markets, the top reason people gave for actively trying
  to avoid the news was that it negatively impacted their mood. Respondents also
  said they were worn out by the amount of news, that there is too much coverage
  of war and conflict, and that there’s nothing they can do with the
  information. Julian Burrett, a British marketing professional, said he’s
  intentionally unplugged from the news since the pandemic, after feeling almost
  addicted to constant negative updates. He’s deleted most media apps from his
  phone and avoids TV bulletins. Last year, he even started a small Reddit
  community, r/newsavoidance, to “consider the pros and cons, tips and tricks,
  and tools of avoiding news”. Others who spoke to the Guardian described varied
  approaches. One said he checks in on the news once a week to stay informed
  without being overwhelmed. Another said he has shunned the news for years,
  citing its effect on his mood and a broader distrust in the press. A Maryland
  man described feeling “enraged” by recent political developments, and tries to
  set boundaries by scanning headlines only. Studies suggest that increased
  exposure to news – particularly via television and social media, and
  especially coverage of tragic or distressing events – can take a toll on
  mental health. For decades, Roxane Cohen Silver has examined the consequences
  of consuming media about crises, from 9/11 and the Covid-19 pandemic to
  climate-related disasters and mass shootings. “With greater exposure, we see
  greater distress in people’s reports of their mental health. Greater anxiety,
  greater depression, greater post traumatic stress symptoms, acute stress
  symptoms,” said Silver, professor of psychology, medicine and public health at
  the University of California, Irvine. In recent years, her research has found
  political polarization to be a major stressor for people in the US. Similarly,
  political concerns topped the list last year in the American Psychological
  Association’s Stress in America poll, with the economy and spread of false
  news also ranking prominently. With the rise of smartphones and social media,
  opportunities for contact with distressing content have exploded, Silver
  noted. “There’s just ample opportunity to be exposed to news all the time,
  through either push notifications on people’s phones, or people can be
  consuming news across many different modes simultaneously,” she said. Viewing
  graphic imagery, in particular, is associated with psychological distress – a
  concern in an era when disturbing images of tragedies circulate freely beyond
  newsrooms’ control. A growing body of advice online promotes healthier ways to
  consume news. Much of it focuses on creating guardrails so people can be
  deliberate about finding information when they’re ready for it, instead of
  letting it reach them in a constant stream. This might include signing up for
  newsletters or summaries from trusted sources, turning off news alerts and
  limiting social media. “People can stay informed without doomscrolling,”
  Silver said. Applying learnings from her research to her own life, she reads
  news online, but skips videos, television and social media. “I don’t see any
  psychological or physical benefit from consumption of those kinds of images,”
  she said. “So if I’m reading a story and there is a video, I don’t click on
  it.” She suggests setting specific windows of time to read the news rather
  than staying immersed in that environment constantly, noting that it helps if
  people feel a sense of control over how much they’re being exposed. Benjamin
  Toff, director of the Minnesota Journalism Center at the University of
  Minnesota, studied the trend in his book Avoiding the News. He draws a key
  distinction between those who consistently avoid the news and those who simply
  limit their consumption – the latter, he says, is “perfectly healthy”. “We
  live in a world in which you can access news 24/7 and be inundated with
  information at all times. But that doesn’t mean you should,” he said. What
  worries him and his co-authors is when withdrawal turns into a cycle that
  deepens social divides, leaving some groups less likely to participate in
  political life. “The more you disengage, disconnect from the news, the harder
  it becomes to try to make sense of what’s happening on any given story,” he
  explained. The authors observed that consistent news avoidance tends to be
  more common among young people, women, and lower socioeconomic classes. “If
  you believe as we do, that normatively, we want people to be able to have the
  same opportunities to engage politically, to vote, to be vocal about the
  political issues that matter, then we think it’s a problem that people are
  disengaging from news,” Toff said.
