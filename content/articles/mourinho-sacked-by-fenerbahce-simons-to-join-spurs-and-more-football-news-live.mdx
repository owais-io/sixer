  David Moyes was asked about incoming transfers at Everton and whether this has
  been one of his hardest summers taking charge at a club. Here is what he had
  to say: I think it has. Since we beat Newcastle on the last game of the season
  I have been working on recruitment and found it a really difficult summer. We
  have had a lot of players who have chosen not to come and we have had to work
  really hard to get enough players in. Our squad numbers are small. But if
  things change before Monday then that would be good. But it is not all doom
  and gloom for Moyes, who is incredibly excited about what Jack Grealish can
  bring to his side this season: I’m really pleased because he is a real talent
  and someone we hope we can get back to the levels he has produced over many
  years. I hope he can build on it, continue get fitter and continue to keep
  playing regularly. West Ham have confirmed the signing of Mateus Fernandes
  from Southampton with a deal worth £38m plus £4m in add-ons. I’m very happy to
  be here. I’m very excited to play for West Ham. I think it’s a big step for
  me. It’s a big club, a massive club. The project, the stadium, the city,
  everything. I want to try to play football, enjoy football, not just run and
  try to score, but try to play good football. I think the most important thing
  is to try to give everything every day. The Rumour Mill continues to spin
  away. Dominic Booth has the latest on the latest whispers in the transfer
  universe. And of course, Howe is asked if Isak will remain a Newcastle player
  by the end of the window: It’s difficult for me to give you any sort of
  clarity on the future. I’ve said before, I don’t know what the future holds in
  that respect because I’m not involved with it myself. I’ve got no update and
  I’m just concentrating on bringing players into the club. The Newcastle
  manager was also asked about their Champions League draw. Howe’s side will be
  playing: Barcelona (home), Paris Saint-Germain (away), Benfica (home), Bayer
  Leverkusen (away), PSV Eindhoven (home), Marseille (away), Athletic Bilbao
  (home) and Union SG (away). Really interesting. Some great games. Exiting
  prospects. The group we had last time was very difficult, the games we have
  this time are tough and challenging. The Barcelona game is the one you
  instantly get drawn to, with the links with Sir Bobby and the history between
  the two clubs. Can we create more legacy to that fixture? Eddie Howe has
  naturally been asked about Nick Woltemade after reports that the German has
  flown into Tyneside for a medical ahead of his £70m move from Stuttgart:
  Positive signs. Things are moving and developing in a good way at the moment.
  Until it’s done I can’t confirm anything but fingers crossed. I don’t think
  that is going to be possible [for Woltemade to play against Leeds tomorrow]
  due to lots of reasons I don’t understand. The most important thing is we try
  to bring a centre-forward in that’s what we’ve been working hard to do all
  summer. Slot was also asked about Hugo Ekitike, Liverpool’s new striker, who
  has stormed to a strong start with two goals in two matches: He’s already made
  a big impact on the attacking part of our game so not only scoring goals but
  being part of buildup situations where he was someone that started the attack.
  The most important answer to what he can improve is his match fitness. I
  expect him to do a lot more without the ball than he already does because he’s
  already working hard. It’s completely normal because he has to adjust to a
  different league from a different playing style. Frankfurt wasn’t pressing as
  much as we try to do, and then coming to a different league, there’s a lot for
  him to handle. To adapt to the intensity levels without the ball, there are
  small steps to make for him. Despite two wins from two, Liverpool have
  struggled with set-pieces and will face a team on Sunday that thrive from
  dead-ball situations: The thing that stands out for [Arsenal], and in a
  negative way for us, is we’ve conceded four set pieces, including the Bilbao
  game and that’s one of their strengths. You can see how well they are managed
  by Mikel Arteta, they’ve been working together for five years and they can
  play almost every style there is. It [conceding from set-pieces] is a part we
  need to improve, which we were really good at last season so there’s no panic.
  Liverpool’s title defence continues on Sunday and Arne Slot was, of course,
  asked about Alexander Isak, who is doing his best to force a move to the
  defending champions from Newcastle. Eddie Howe’s side have spent most of the
  summer trying to sign a new striker to replace Callum Wilson and Isak, if they
  let him leave. After missing out on several targets, they finally seemed to
  have found their man in Nick Woltemade. Here is what Arne Slot said on the
  situation: If it’s true, Newcastle have signed a new No9 and that’s very nice
  for Eddie because Anthony Gordon is suspended and Isak has not been training.
  I said after Monday evening that I could make a substitute to impact the game
  and as always, we try to sign players who can help us. But there’s no reason,
  after the first two games to complain to think we need more. But if we can
  strength the squad, we will try to do that if it’s for the right money and the
  right player. Let’s see if we do something and if we can, what we can do.
  Slot’s side will host Arsenal at Anfield, their closest rivals to the title
  last season: There are a lot of similarities with both teams. The playing
  style of Arsenal hasn’t changed too much with the new signings coming in.
  Maybe they have a different No 9 than last season, Jesus is a real No 9 but he
  didn’t play as much, but the one they have now is different to Havertz or
  Trossard. Gyokeres is more of a target man so that’s maybe where there’s a
  small difference. Tottenham are poised to complete the £51.8m signing of Xavi
  Simons from RB Leipzig. Personal terms have been agreed with the attacking
  midfielder and a medical has taken place. Barring any last-minute hitches the
  deal will be a major boost for Thomas Frank, who has been hoping to add an
  attacking midfielder. Spurs have have missed out on Eberechi Eze, who joined
  Arsenal from Crystal Palace, and Nottingham Forest’s Morgan Gibbs-White.
  Chelsea were also interested in Simons but never made a bid for the
  22-year-old. There are no indications that the club will disrupt their London
  rivals by attempting a late swoop for the Netherlands international. More from
  Jacob Steinberg and David Hytner here. Mourinho joined Fenerbahce just over a
  year ago after a stint at Roma and was greeted by thousands of fans when he
  arrived in Istanbul, raising expectations of ending Galatasaray’s recent
  dominance. He was in charge for 62 matches at Fenerbahce where he won 37, lost
  11 and drew 14, making his win percentage 59.68%, his highest since his time
  at Real Madrid between 2010 and 2013 (71.91%). Fenerbahce have parted ways
  with José Mourinho after the Turkish club failed to qualify for the Champions
  League league phase. Mourinho’s side were beaten 1-0 by Benfica on Wednesday
  night in their playoff tie. In a statement released on social media, the club
  said: “We thank him for his efforts for our team until today and wish him
  success in his future career.” The former Chelsea, Manchester United and
  Tottenham manager is the second high-profile manager in Turkey to get the sack
  in the last day after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked by Besiktas less than
  one hour after they failed to qualify for the Conference League. It is Friday
  morning and yet another weekend of Premier League football awaits, this one
  the last before the first international break of the season. Here you will
  find all the latest lines as the managers take on the media in today’s press
  conferences. Deadline day is also fast approaching and clubs will be hoping to
  make those late adjustments to their squad to ensure they are as ready as
  possible for the long season ahead. We will also have of EFL, Scottish
  Premiership and European football news as it comes. Plus the latest on Thomas
  Tuchel’s England squad announcement for World Cup qualifiers at noon. As
  always, get in touch of you have any transfer wishes or weekend predictions.
