  We expect our doctors to be demi-gods – flawless, tireless, always right. But
  they are only human. Increasingly, they are stretched thin, working long
  hours, under immense pressure, and often with limited resources. Of course,
  better conditions would help, including more staff and improved systems. But
  even in the best-funded clinics with the most committed professionals,
  standards can still fall short; doctors, like the rest of us, are working with
  stone age minds. Despite years of training, human brains are not optimally
  equipped for the pace, pressure, and complexity of modern healthcare. Given
  that patient care is medicine’s core purpose, the question is who, or what, is
  best placed to deliver it? AI may still spark suspicion, but research
  increasingly shows how it could help fix some of the most persistent problems
  and overlooked failures – from misdiagnosis and error to unequal access to
  care. As patients, each of us will face at least one diagnostic error in our
  lifetimes. In England, conservative estimates suggest that about 5% of primary
  care visits result in a failure to properly diagnose, putting millions of
  patients in danger. In the US, diagnostic errors cause death or permanent
  injury to almost 800,000 people annually. Misdiagnosis is a greater risk if
  you’re among the one in 10 people worldwide with a rare disease. Modern
  medicine prides itself on being scientific, yet doctors don’t always practise
  what the evidence recommends. Studies show that evidence-based treatments are
  offered only about half the time to adults in the US. Doctors can also
  disagree about diagnoses. In a study of more than 12,000 radiology images,
  reviewers offering second opinions disagreed with the original assessment in
  about one in three cases – leading to a change in treatment nearly 20% of the
  time. As the work day wears on, quality slips further: inappropriate
  antibiotic prescriptions rise, while cancer screening rates fall. As alarming
  as this is, there are understandable reasons for these failures – and viewed
  from another angle, it’s remarkable that doctors get it right as often as they
  do. The realities of being human – distraction, multitasking, even our body
  clocks – take a toll. But burnout, depression and cognitive ageing don’t just
  wear doctors down; they raise the risk of clinical mistakes. Medical knowledge
  also moves faster than doctors can keep up. By graduation, half of what
  medical students learn is already outdated. It takes an average of 17 years
  for research to reach clinical practice, and with a new biomedical article
  published every 39 seconds, even skimming the abstracts would take about 22
  hours a day. There are more than 7,000 rare diseases, with 250 more identified
  each year. In contrast, AI devours medical data at lightning speed, 24/7, with
  no sleep and no bathroom breaks. Where doctors vary in unwanted ways, AI is
  consistent. And while these tools make errors too, it would be churlish to
  deny how impressive the latest models are, with some studies showing they
  vastly outperform human doctors in clinical reasoning, including for complex
  medical conditions. AI’s superpower is spotting patterns humans miss, and
  these tools are surprisingly good at recognising rare diseases – often better
  than doctors. For example, in one 2023 study researchers fed 50 clinical cases
  – including 10 rare conditions – into ChatGPT-4. It was asked to provide
  diagnoses in the form of ranked suggestions. It solved all of the common cases
  by the second suggestion, and got 90% of the rare conditions by the eighth –
  outperforming the human doctors used as comparators. Patients and their
  families are increasingly recognising these benefits. One child, Alex, saw 17
  doctors over three years for chronic pain – none could explain his symptoms.
  Desperate, his mother turned to ChatGPT, which suggested a rare condition
  called tethered cord syndrome. Doctors confirmed the diagnosis, and Alex is
  now receiving proper treatment. Then there’s the problem of access. Healthcare
  is upside down. Those most in need – the sickest, poorest, and most
  marginalised in society – are the ones most likely to be left behind. Packed
  schedules and poor public transport mean millions miss appointments. Parents
  and part-time workers, including those with gig economy jobs, often struggle
  to attend checkups. American Time Use Survey data shows patients sacrifice two
  hours for a 20-minute doctor’s visit. The problems are often worse for people
  with disabilities, who are about four times more likely to miss out on care in
  the UK due to issues with transport, costs and long waiting lists. Compared
  with men with no disability, disabled women are more than seven times more
  likely to have unmet needs due to the cost of care or medication. And yet we
  rarely question the idea of waiting in line at the doctor’s office in town
  because it’s simply the way things have always been done. AI could change
  that. Imagine a doctor in your pocket offering information when and where you
  need it. Under Labour’s 10-year plan, Wes Streeting, the health secretary, has
  announced that patients will soon be able to discuss their health concerns
  with AI via the NHS app. It’s a bold step – and one that could bring quicker,
  actionable clinical advice for millions. This will only work for those who can
  use it, of course. Internet access is improving globally, but there are still
  serious gaps: 2.5 billion people remain offline. In the UK, 8.5 million people
  lack basic digital skills, and 3.7 million families fall below the “minimum
  digital living standard”, meaning they have poor connectivity, outdated
  devices and limited support. Confidence is a barrier too: 21% of people in the
  UK say they feel left behind by technology. At the moment, AI healthcare
  research almost exclusively fixates on its flaws. Examining the technology’s
  potential for bias and errors is a crucially important task. But this
  orientation doesn’t take account of the creaking and sometimes unsafe systems
  we already rely on. Any fair assessment of AI must be weighed against the
  realities of what we’ve currently got – a system that too often can be
  frustrating, out of reach, or just plain wrong. • Charlotte Blease is a health
  researcher and the author of Dr Bot: Why Doctors Can Fail Us – and How AI
  Could Save Lives, published by Yale on 9 September. Further reading Deep
