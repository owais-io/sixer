  Rachel Reeves must intervene to assist British retailers by ending an imports
  tax break that favours Chinese online rivals and rethinking plans for higher
  levies on large stores, the boss of the DIY chain B&amp;Q has said. The
  outspoken plea comes as the government faces growing pressure over its
  management of the economy after the Bank of England said when it cut interest
  rates on Thursday that tax rises were contributing to rising inflation and
  unemployment. With a raft of major retailers including Poundland, River Island
  and Claire’s all expected to close large numbers of stores this year amid poor
  consumer confidence and increases in employers’ national insurance payments,
  the minimum wage, packaging taxes and business rates, Reeves faces rising
  calls to help consumer businesses, which are major employers in the UK.
  However, after a recent round of negative economic data on jobs, growth and
  price rises prompted a warning this week from the NIESR thinktank of a looming
  deficit of more than £40bn, fears are growing that ministers are preparing the
  ground for a fresh round of tax rises in this autumn’s budget. B&amp;Q’s
  Graham Bell suggested one area where the chancellor could really help British
  business would be to tackle the “de minimis” rule that has underpinned the
  rise of the fast-growing online specialists Shein and Temu. This rule, which
  allows overseas sellers to send goods valued at £135 or less direct to British
  shoppers without paying any customs duty, is “killing the high street more
  than anything”, said Bell, who ran the Screwfix chain before taking the reins
  at B&amp;Q in 2018. “This even put some of our suppliers out of business, not
  just the retailers,” he added. Bell also urged the government to reconsider
  plans to increase business rates on stores with a rateable value of more than
  £500,000 from next year. The move, intended to fund ongoing tax breaks for
  smaller retailers, has already been criticised by the bosses of big retailers
  including Sainsbury’s and Next. “They keep going on about the high street and
  if you look at what’s happening it is their [actions] that are knocking the
  high street,” Bell said. He said the national insurance and minimum wage rises
  from April this year had been “hugely costly” as minimum wage increases had
  prompted pay rises throughout the business to maintain differentials. The
  changes have partly driven a surge in use of self-checkouts, with more than
  80% of B&amp;Q sales now being rung up using them, compared with about 10%
  about three years ago. The chancellor said in April that she was considering
  changes to the de minimis tax break. No further action, such as a
  consultation, appears to have been taken on the matter since, but a government
  spokesperson said the chancellor’s review “is ongoing and will report in due
  course”. Fears of China’s retailers and manufacturers dumping goods in the UK
  have grown since the US in May revoked its own de minimis exception for
  Chinese-made goods, under which parcels with a value of less than $800 (£600)
  shipped to individuals had been exempt from import tax. It recently announced
  plans to scrap the tax break for items from all countries later this month.
  The EU said in February it would phase out its exemption on customs duties for
  low-value parcels. Bell, whose group runs dozens of stores and now has an
  online marketplace for home improvement gear that directly competes with the
  likes of Temu, said the overseas rivals were part of “a huge market that’s not
  going to go away” and the government “needs to do something to regulate it
  now, or it’s going to get out of hand”. He said the fear was not just of being
  undercut but that products sold on rival marketplaces may not go through the
  same safety checks as B&amp;Q products. “We go through lots of hoops, for our
  product passing quality control, sustainability, all our wood is Forest
  Stewardship Council,” he said, arguing that rival products “come in under the
  radar”. Shein and Temu have previously said they have systems to vet sellers
  and take down unsafe products. Bell said it was unclear how may B&amp;Q stores
  might be affected by the planned business rates changes but even small stores
  in expensive locations such as London could have to pay more alongside larger
  out-of-town sites in prime locations. While the CEO said he did not envisage
  closing or downsizing stores as a result of the tax change, he added: “It
  stops us investing maybe in our small stores that we’re going to do on the
  high street or investing in existing infrastructure.” Bell said the business
  would be “quite happy take our share” if the government focused additional
  business rates on warehouses, to target online sellers as the business rates
  adjustment was originally supposed to do.
