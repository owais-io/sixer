  The Suez crisis in 1956 was a humiliating moment of truth for the UK. Faced
  with implacable opposition from the US, Anthony Eden’s government was forced
  to abandon military action in Egypt. Capitulation to American pressure was a
  recognition of Britain’s diminished status on the world stage. The trade deal
  agreed between Washington and Brussels this week lacks the drama of troops
  being sent in to recapture one of the world’s key waterways, but it is the
  EU’s Suez moment all the same. What’s more, European politicians know as much.
  Donald Trump said the outcome was “great”, and for the US that was certainly
  the case, since the EU made all the concessions and got nothing in return.
  Most European goods exported to the US will face a 15% tariff, while the
  already small tariffs on US goods entering the EU will be eliminated
  altogether. European companies have been forced to accept higher costs as the
  price of access to the world’s biggest market. That’s by no means all. The EU
  has also committed itself to $600bn (£450bn) of US investments, $750bn in
  long-term fossil-fuel energy purchases and to buy more US military kit. Plans
  for an EU digital services tax that would affect US tech giants had already
  been dropped. As far as the financial markets were concerned, it was reason to
  feel relieved, since this one-sided peace pact removed the threat of a
  tit-for-tat trade war. It isn’t that economists think tariffs will be good for
  the global economy, but rather that they feared an even worse outcome. EU
  trade negotiators were of the same opinion. For Brussels, any deal was better
  than no deal. But appeasement always has its critics, and condemnation of the
  deal was swift in coming – particularly from France. François Bayrou, the
  prime minister, said it was a “dark day” for Europe. His predecessor, Michel
  Barnier, said the agreement was an admission of weakness. Posting on X, the
  entrepreneur and commentator Arnaud Bertrand said the terms of the agreement
  represented one of the most expensive imperial tributes in history. He added:
  “This does not even remotely resemble the type of agreements made by two equal
  sovereign powers. It rather looks like the type of unequal treaties that
  colonial powers used to impose in the 19th century – except this time, Europe
  is on the receiving end.” That’s a reasonable conclusion. The rationale behind
  ever-closer union within the bloc was that an EU armed with its own currency
  would be able to match the US, not just in terms of economic prowess but in
  geopolitical influence as well. The euro would be a rival to the dollar, and
  strong growth would give Europe political clout. Pooling sovereignty in areas
  such as trade would ensure that Europe punched above its weight. Things
  haven’t quite gone according to plan. Europe’s economic performance since
  monetary union has been dismal, and the gap with the US has widened rather
  than narrowed. Individual countries have had their scope for independent
  action systematically reduced, with restrictions on state aid, procurement and
  industrial policy. Handing the European Commission responsibility for
  negotiating trade deals hasn’t prevented Europe being steamrolled by the US.
  Indeed, the trade deal the EU has agreed with the US is actually less
  favourable than the one that Keir Starmer has signed up to for post-Brexit
  Britain. The US-EU agreement needs to be approved by EU countries, which could
  be a problem if the hostile French reaction is anything to go by. Many details
  remain unclear and some of the terms will prove hard, if not impossible, to
  enforce. There is no way, for instance, that the EU can force private
  companies in Europe to invest across the Atlantic. Moreover, the deal may
  prove to be a pyrrhic victory for Trump if, as looks increasingly likely,
  tariffs increase the cost of goods in the US. Coupled with the clampdown on
  migration, there is the clear risk that growth will slow and inflation will
  rise. Share prices on Wall Street are high in expectation that the good times
  will continue. They may not. But while there would be a tinge of schadenfreude
  in Europe were the bubble in US asset prices to burst, any joy in Trump’s
  misfortune would prove short-lived. Europe’s fortunes are tied to those of the
  US. First, it needs access to the American market because its economic model
  relies so heavily on exports. This is particularly true of Germany, which runs
  large and persistent trade surpluses. German carmakers can probably just about
  live with 15% tariffs, but they would have been ruined had Trump followed
  through on his threat to impose levies of 30%. Second, the EU needs the US to
  help it counter the perceived threat from Russia. It sees US energy as a
  substitute for Russian oil and gas, while the agreement to buy more American
  military goods is a way of tying the US more firmly into Nato. The contrast
  with China is stark. Beijing did not roll over when Trump imposed punitive
  tariffs earlier this year. Instead, it stood up to US bullying by announcing
  retaliatory measures of its own. The markets went into full panic mode, with
  China’s robust response triggering a sharp fall in US bond prices. Faced with
  a financial meltdown, Trump watered down his tariff plans. The EU’s surrender
  to Trump shows that China is now the only serious rival to American hegemony.
  Like Britain since Suez, the EU’s subservience to the US is plain for all to
  see. Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnist
