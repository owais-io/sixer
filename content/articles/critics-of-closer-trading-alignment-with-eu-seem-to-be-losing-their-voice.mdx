  Asked in 2020 whether the UK would accept aligning with EU business
  regulations, Michael Gove, the then Cabinet Office minister, said bluntly: “We
  will not trade away our sovereignty.” Sitting next to his Labour successor,
  Nick Thomas-Symonds, on Wednesday, the now editor of the Spectator was more
  circumspect. Asked if he accepted Thomas-Symonds’sargument that so-called
  dynamic alignment was good for the economy, Gove replied with a smile: “I will
  wait to see the details before making a definitive judgment.” Underpinning
  Gove’s response was not just the politeness of a host – Thomas-Symonds gave
  his speech at the Spectator’s premises – but a realisation that voters have
  moved on since 2025. Thomas-Symonds’s speech was the most assertively
  pro-European he has given since entering government last year as Keir
  Starmer’s chief European negotiator. The Cabinet Office minister said he
  wanted to sign a deal to export food and drink products to the EU without
  boundaries, something the government says would generate £5.1bn a year in
  economic benefits by 2040. Small businesses currently pay £200 for a licence
  every time they want to export a shipment of agricultural goods – costs that
  the government has promised to eliminate. But he also talked openly about the
  benefits of accepting EU standards for the foreseeable future, even if the UK
  now has no say in setting them. “We can then start reducing the checks on the
  Irish Sea, which is clearly of benefit to trade,” he argued. Most
  eye-catchingly, after months of being coy over the prospect of a youth
  mobility scheme with the EU, Thomas-Symonds embraced the possibility with open
  arms. “When you are providing those opportunities for young British people,
  I’m very excited about the scheme,” he said. “I think it’s going to be
  fantastic.” He insisted the debate had changed since Gove helped lead the
  successful Leave campaign. “Last week was GCSE results day – young people
  opening envelopes that helped decide the shape of their future,” he said.
  “Most of them weren’t even eight years old when the referendum happened. That
  era is gone.” If Gove’s silence on dynamic alignment was notable, the
  reluctance of Nigel Farage to get drawn into this debate has been even more
  so. In May, when Starmer announced his outline agreement with the EU, Farage
  was not even in the country. The Reform leader also failed to mention the
  issue during a press conference in Edinburgh on Wednesday. Instead, the party
  put out a statement from a spokesperson accusing the government of “cosying up
  to the EU and leaving us entangled in reams of retained EU law”. Labour
  officials are open about trying to draw Farage into a fight they believe he
  cannot win. “Since we signed our reset deal, Farage has sat there like a lemon
  and chucked out a few source quotes to his core audience,” said one. “It is
  about time he answered questions on his approach to EU relations.” Judging by
  his silence over the issue on Wednesday, Farage can read the polls as well as
  Thomas-Symonds. A survey by More in Common on Wednesday showed 54% of voters
  now believe that closer relations with the EU would be good for Britain, while
  only 18% of voters disagree. Voters are even willing to undermine British
  sovereignty to boost the economy, with 44% of voters saying the government
  should prioritise the economy, compared with 38% who say it should focus on
  sovereignty. Luke Tryl, the executive director of More in Common, said:
  “Rather than wanting politicians to re-litigate Brexit, most want the focus to
  be on practical discussions that work out how to balance the economic benefits
  of a closer relationship with protecting national control.” There are limits
  to Labour’s increasingly vocal desire to be closer to the EU, however.
  Thomas-Symonds would not contemplate re-entering the single market or the
  customs union. “It isn’t about revisiting the issues of the past, it’s about a
  ruthlessly pragmatic assessment of the national interest today,” he said.
  There are also limits to how successful an electoral strategy it could be.
  While voters do want to trade more closely with Britain’s European neighbours,
  they care about the issue far less than the one Farage has spent the last two
  days talking about: irregular migration. According to the latest figures from
  the pollster YouGov, 51% of voters put immigration among their top three
  priorities, compared with just 10% who list “Britain leaving the EU”.
