  ‘Natural’ has become a buzzword,” says Dr Rosalind Simpson, a consultant
  dermatologist and associate professor at the University of Nottingham. And
  when it’s on the label of beauty products, sellers often charge more. “There’s
  a trend where people assume that synthetically derived ingredients are
  harmful, and that if something’s labelled ‘natural’ it must be safer or better
  for your skin,” she says. But that’s often a misconception. For starters, not
  everything labelled “natural” is entirely sourced from nature. “I came across
  a crude study that looked at 100 skincare products on Amazon marketed as
  natural. Only 42% truly were,” Simpson adds. In fact, most “natural” skincare
  products contained at least two synthetic ingredients. Beyond this, just
  because something is sourced from natural ingredients doesn’t mean it’s gentle
  on every skin type. Though plant-based, ingredients including fragrances and
  essential oils such as cinnamon, tea tree, peppermint and linalool can cause
  irritation for some people. Lanolin, a moisturising agent derived from sheep’s
  wool, is another common allergen. Some synthetic ingredients, such as certain
  scents and colourings, can be just as irritating, but that isn’t always the
  case. “Some are scientifically developed to be more gentle on the skin and to
  have a reduced chance of causing potential reactions,” says Simpson. Her
  bottom line? Not all natural products are “good”, and not all synthetic ones
  are “bad”. It’s about finding what works for you. “Go with what your skin
  tolerates and what fits your budget.” If you have sensitive skin, she
  recommends looking for products with the lowest number of ingredients. And if
  you suspect you have had a reaction to a product – even months after you
  started using it – it’s always smart to take a break so you can see whether it
  is to blame.
