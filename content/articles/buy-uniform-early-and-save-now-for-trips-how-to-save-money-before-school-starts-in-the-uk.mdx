  Shop early To get your children’s uniforms sorted in time, and at a good
  price, you need to start early – you will avoid long queues and have plenty of
  choice of style, size and price point. There are typically two parts: the
  branded school jumper, cardigan or blazer that has to be bought from a
  supplier linked to the school, and the generic items – such as shirts,
  trousers and pinafores – that can be from any number of shops. Many of the big
  supermarkets have competitively priced clothes that fit in with most schools’
  requirements. Sainsbury’s Tu range has five white polo shirts starting at
  £7.50, and four sets of trousers from £14. Lidl has two pinafores for £6.99,
  and polo shirts at £1.75 each. If your child can wear a non-specific top,
  Marks &amp; Spencer has two black jumpers from £11 and two cardigans at £13.
  Prices usually increase as the sizes get bigger. Sizes for primary and
  secondary schoolchildren are all available. Guidelines from the Department for
  Education say schools should ensure their uniform is affordable, and branded
  items should be kept to a minimum. They should give “the highest priority to
  cost and value”, according to the guidelines. There are many ways to buy
  secondhand. Parents will often sell on, or give away, used uniforms. During
  the year, parents’ groups will hold “swap shops” or sales of secondhand
  clothes. Online, it is worth looking at Vinted and eBay, and local Facebook
  groups and marketplace. There is also a dedicated online school uniform
  marketplace, Uniformly. At the time of writing, Vinted had a bundle of seven
  used cardigans and two jumpers at £5. Facebook Marketplace had two dresses at
  £4. Label everything so that lost items can be returned. You can do this with
  a permanent marker (£1.60) or by ordering bespoke labels online (these cost £9
  for 30 at Petit Fernand or £15.95 for 56 at Mynametags.com). You may be able
  to get a grant to help with uniform costs. In Scotland, this starts at £120
  for primary school pupils and £150 for those at secondary school; it’s £125 in
  Wales and £42.90 in Northern Ireland. In England, it depends on whether your
  council offers them, but research from the advice site Money Wellness suggests
  just one in five authorities have the funds. Sort out travel Across the UK,
  your child may be eligible for free travel to school if they are aged under
  eight and the school is more than two miles away, or if they are over eight
  and it is more than three miles away. They may also qualify if they cannot
  walk to school safely, even with an adult, or because of special educational
  needs, disability or a mobility problem. It is up to your local authority to
  decide whether these criteria are met. “Free travel” could mean a pass for
  public transport, or travel in a dedicated school bus or taxi. In London, up
  to four children aged five to 10 can travel free when accompanied by an adult
  on the underground, Overground, Elizabeth line, DLR and trams and buses.
  Children between those ages can use a 5-10 Zip Oyster photocard to travel
  alone free on the tube, DLR, Overground and Elizabeth line. Older children can
  use a 11-15 Zip Oystercard to get child fares and free travel on buses and
  trams. Teenagers aged 16–18 who are in full-time education can get a 16+
  Oyster, which gives half-price tickets. Rail firms often offer discounts on
  season tickets for children travelling to school. Greater Anglia says pupils
  can save up to 57% between two stations during term times. Northern has
  Education Season Tickets, which are 40% less than its standard child prices
  for kids aged 11 and over. Exploit offers Many primary schools will provide
  the stationery that children need. Secondary schools usually expect each child
  to bring pens and rulers for everyday use, and items such as scientific
  calculators for maths. You may be sent a list of what is required. Most items
  can be bought in supermarkets or other high street shops, which often have
  deals at this time of year. Asda has four Bic Highlighter Grip Pens for half
  price at £1.98; Wilco has A5 notebooks at £2.09 and The Works has 10 pens for
  £1. For older children who need a computer, HP’s Student Store offers sixth
  formers up to 20% off its laptops and desktops and 40% off accessories and
  monitors. You will need an academic email address, or a proof of enrolment.
  Younger schoolchildren will usually just need a laptop with basic functions to
  do homework. Secondhand, refurbished laptops are available on Back Market,
  which offers a one-year warranty, and on well-known sites such as eBay.
  Parental controls can be set up on refurbished devices in the same way as on
  new machines. For musicians, Casio has reductions on some keyboards and pianos
  until the end of September. Save for school trips Many schoolchildren will
  have at least one trip during the year. This could be to a theme park or
  foreign travel for older ones. Costs vary widely and can have a significant
  impact on a household’s finances. Research from the insurer Zurich Municipal
  suggests one in seven parents have had to work overtime to afford a trip. It
  is worth trying to find out how much the trips will cost through the year and
  setting money aside every month in a dedicated pot on a banking app, or an
  easy-access savings account. Chase has a saver account with a 5% interest
  rate, while the saving app Chip has one with a 4.84% rate. Cut childcare costs
  The cost of wraparound childcare adds up quickly. Research from the children’s
  charity Coram puts the average bill for a week of an after-school club at £66
  a child. Households eligible for tax-free childcare can get up to £2,000 a
  year from the government to help with the cost. Parents set up an online
  account and for every £8 they pay in, the government pays in £2. Eligibility
  depends on how much you earn, and the age of your child. They must be under 11
  (they stop being eligible on 1 September after their 11th birthday). The
  childcare provider you choose must have signed up to the scheme. You may be
  able to get financial help if you are on universal credit. This could be up to
  85% of childcare costs. You need to be in paid work, or starting a new job,
  and the child must be with a registered childcare provider. Typically, you pay
  the costs and they are then refunded through universal credit.
