  An early-middle-aged woman with a bright smile and a nonthreateningly frumpy
  dress sense, Wang Zhenxi has an extremely specific set of skills. Part
  therapist, part spy, part master strategist, she helps spouses expunge pesky
  mistresses and lovers from their partners’ lives, hopefully restoring
  monogamous harmony in the process. She’s called a mistress dispeller, which
  sounds very awkward in English and yet that’s a perfectly apt description for
  the cleansing process that Ms Wang performs. Somehow, director Elizabeth Lo –
  who must have some killer persuasive skills of her own – managed to talk to
  Wang, her clients Mrs and Mr Li, and, amazingly, Mr Li’s mistress Fei Fei,
  into taking part in this film. Each corner of the love triangle gets to say
  their piece, and although the whole setup may seem a little strange what with
  the hiring of a professional relationship wrecker, ultimately the innate
  goodness and human vulnerability of these people shines through. The film
  effectively opens with Mrs Li, who may seem at first steely and sharp,
  especially judging by her aggressive badminton style, but we see her crying
  silently while she gets her hair done. She’s the one who brings Wang onboard,
  recommended by her younger brother, and soon her husband is all in as well,
  keen as he is to be rid of his troublesome, emotionally vulnerable mistress,
  but without breaking the poor thing’s heart. This is Fei Fei, a Becky with the
  good hair, to quote Beyoncé (and she does have stunning hair), and she is no
  fool. She has worked out that she has opted to have love dispensed in little
  crumbs once a month from a man who’s essentially not available because, deep
  down, she doesn’t believe she deserves anything better. If the film has a
  fault it’s that you don’t ever find out exactly why that is, or what makes
  these people tick on a deeper level. Nevertheless, Lo’s camerawork makes what
  must have been pretty spontaneous situations look elegantly composed, and
  there’s a precise balance here between humour and empathy that keeps the tone
  always on that anxious cusp between absurdity and sincerity. It’s easy to
  imagine that this could be turned into a streamer series, but as a stand-alone
  documentary about normal lives and the gossip around them, it’s just right. •
  Mistress Dispeller is at Bertha DocHouse, London, from 22 August
