  According to the Royal College of Nursing, incidents of violence against
  A&amp;E nurses have almost doubled over the last six years, often due to
  people being frustrated at waiting so long for care. Incidents include nurses
  being punched, spat at and pinned up against a wall. We would like to hear
  from NHS patients and what their experience has been like seeing or being the
  victim of violence during long waits in A&amp;E. What happened and was the
  incident reported? If the police were involved, what was the outcome? If
  you’re having trouble using the form click here. Read terms of service here
