  The government’s proposed levy on international student fees could cost
  universities in England more than £600m a year if it goes ahead, a study has
  found. The 6% surcharge on tuition fees paid by overseas students, floated in
  the Home Office’s recent immigration white paper, would particularly hit
  leading universities such as University College London (UCL) and the
  University of Manchester, based on the figures compiled by the Higher
  Education Policy Institute (Hepi). The policy would leave universities in a
  difficult decision over whether to pass on the cost of the levy to students or
  absorb some or all of it from the fees they charged, in effect cutting their
  income. Nick Hillman, Hepi’s director, said: “The proposed levy on
  international students comes up in just about every meeting I attend.
  University leaders are worried it will be yet another weight dragging them
  down in the struggle to remain globally competitive.” Based on annual fees
  from non-UK students totalling £10.3bn, the levy would bring in £621m. UCL
  would contribute £43m, Manchester £27m, Imperial College London £22m and the
  University of Oxford £17m. The levy will also hit universities that raise a
  high proportion of funds from international students, including the University
  of Hertfordshire and the University of the Arts London. The government has
  said the money raised by the levy would be used to fund “the higher education
  and skills system”, with further details to come in the autumn budget. While
  vice-chancellors are hoping the bulk of the funds will be re-invested in
  higher education, Hillman said it can’t be taken for granted. “The levy is
  designed to raise more money for the government’s educational priorities but
  it is not clear if all the money will come back out of the Treasury, nor how
  it will be spent if it does,” he said. “Threatening an expensive new tax on
  one of the country’s most successful sectors with only a rough idea of how the
  money will be used seems far from ideal. Currently, the levy is a shadow
  looming large over universities as they prepare for the next academic year.”
  The Home Office estimated the levy would initially lower student numbers by
  14,000 a year, although universities say that is likely to be an
  underestimate. Many universities have already seen lower income from
  international students following recent visa restrictions. Vivienne Stern, the
  chief executive of Universities UK, which represents vice-chancellors, said:
  “We would urge government to think carefully about the impact that a levy on
  international student fees will have on universities and the attractiveness of
  the UK as a study destination.”
