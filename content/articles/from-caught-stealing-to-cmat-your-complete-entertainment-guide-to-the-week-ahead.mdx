  Going out: Cinema Caught Stealing Out now Darren Aronofsky (The Whale, Black
  Swan) is back, with an adaptation of the first of Charlie Huston’s novels
  about former baseball player Hank Thompson, played here by Austin Butler, who
  is unwittingly drawn into the criminal underworld of 1990s New York when a
  cat-sitting job goes awry. The Roses Out now Having a bash at rerunning a
  classic, this new take on the Wars of the Roses draws on both the 1981 novel
  and the 1989 Kathleen Turner v Michael Douglas big-screen adaptation. Olivia
  Colman and Benedict Cumberbatch star as the wealthy couple whose divorce turns
  increasingly ugly, with darkly comic consequences. Young Mothers Out now
  Belgian brothers the Dardennes are noted for their humane, realist approach to
  telling ordinary people’s stories. Their latest focuses on young mothers
  Jessica, Perla, Julie, Naïma and Ariane and their children, and won the
  screenplay prize at Cannes this year. Dogtooth: 4k Restoration Out now Back in
  2009, Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos became internationally recognised with
  this shocking Oscar-nominated third feature. Since then he’s been continuously
  serving, with the likes of The Favourite and Poor Things, but this stunning
  black comedy of familial dysfunction, in which a couple keep their children
  intentionally ignorant of the outside world, is one of his very best.
  Catherine Bray * * * Going out: Gigs Tom Grennan 3 to 19 September; tour
  starts Bournemouth The perpetually topless Bradford-born singer-songwriter
  visits various arenas in support of recent fourth album, Everywhere I Went,
  Led Me to Where I Didn’t Want to Be. Continuing his penchant for big shouty
  pop songs full of big scary emotions, expect the show to act as a form of
  sweat-soaked catharsis. Michael Cragg Manchester Psych Fest Various venues,
  Manchester, 30 August Music’s glorious oddballs head to Manchester for this
  annual event. Headliners this year include Swedish experimentalists Goat and
  British post-rock firebrand Nadine Shah, while the lineup is fleshed out by
  Christopher Owens, WH Lung and Jadu Heart. MC John Etheridge Pizza Express
  Jazz Club, London, 1 to 3 September Eclectic and exciting British guitarist
  John Etheridge has worked with luminaries including swing-violin legend
  Stéphane Grappelli and classical guitarist John Williams – and with art-rock
  fusion pioneers Soft Machine, whose legacy he celebrates (Mon &amp; Tue).
  Etheridge’s Zappatistas group also pay affectionate tribute to the great Frank
  Zappa (Wed). John Fordham L’Heure Espagnole &amp; The Bear St Mary’s Church,
  Haddington, East Lothian, 4 September Lammermuir festival-goers get the first
  opportunity to see Scottish Opera’s double bill of comic one-acters by Ravel
  and Walton, before they reach Glasgow and Edinburgh later in the autumn. The
  contrasting tales of adultery and deception are staged by Jacopo Spirei and
  conducted by Alexandra Cravero. Andrew Clements * * * Going out: Art Mona
  Hatoum and Alberto Giacometti Barbican Level 2, London, 3 September to 11
  January Swiss sculptor Giacometti created surrealist objects that open up
  eerie spaces and voids in buildings and bodies. Palestinian artist Hatoum
  turned an endoscopy camera on herself in a startling inner self-portrait,
  among other unflinching works. They should make a good pair in this series
  comparing today’s artists with Giacometti’s masterpieces. Nadav Kander Flowers
  Gallery, London, 5 September to 11 October Poetic photographs that explore the
  edge of the invisible. Kander’s recent pictures dwell on the dark side of the
  Thames estuary and other landscapes in deep blues and blacks, greys and
  bronzes. Sky and water seem to become one in this uncanny shadow world.
  Victoria Crowe Dovecot Studios, Edinburgh, to 11 October Scottish artist
  Crowe, 80 this year, has spent decades portraying rural life and the moods of
  landscape. Her portraits of shepherd, and Crowe’s neighbour, Jenny Armstrong
  record a way of being that doesn’t seem contemporary at all, yet they were
  made in the 70s and 80s. These and other works heal your spirit. Vivienne
  Westwood Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, to 17 October 2026 From helping to
  invent the punk aesthetic with Malcolm McLaren, to drawing on the 18th-century
  rococo style, Westwood brilliantly blurred the line between fashion and art.
  This survey demonstrates that, showing relics of her first punk designs and
  her 1980s Witches Collection, decorated by the great graffiti artist Keith
  Haring. Jonathan Jones * * * Going out: Stage Deaf Republic Royal Court
  theatre, London, to 13 September A deaf boy is killed in occupied territory
  for disobeying orders he could not hear. The next day, the whole town wakes up
  deaf. Dead Centre and Zoe McWhinney’s production features deaf and hearing
  performers, puppetry, live cinema and poetry. Miriam Gillinson Fat Ham Swan
  theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, to 13 September Winner of the Pulitzer prize for
  drama, James Ijames’s comic tragedy is loosely inspired by Hamlet. The play is
  set during a family barbecue in North Carolina, where a Black queer man is
  visited by the ghost of his father. MG Elis and John: That Feels Significant 3
  September to 18 October; tour starts Norwich Shame wells. Cymru connecting.
  The Kia Sportage. If these words mean little to you, the live tour of Elis
  James and John Robins’s podcast may not seem such a hot ticket. But if you are
  invested in their decade-honed dynamic, a good time is guaranteed. Rachel
  Aroesti We Should Never Have Walked on the Moon Southbank Centre, London, 3 to
  6 September French dance collective (La)Horde joins forces with Rambert in a
  takeover of the Southbank, putting a cast of 50 dancers and DJs all over the
  site for audiences to explore. Includes choreography from Lucinda Childs, Oona
  Doherty and Rambert’s artistic director Benoit Swan Pouffer. Lyndsey Winship
  Staying in: Streaming Mitchell and Webb Are Not Helping Channel 4, 5
  September, 10pm Sketch shows are always risky but this one feels particularly
  high-stakes: after helming a modern classic in the 00s, David Mitchell and
  Robert Webb return with a new supporting cast (Lara Ricote, Kiell Smith-Bynoe,
  Stevie Martin) and – fingers crossed – some timely new ideas. The Paper Sky
  Max &amp; Now, 5 September, 9pm Hopes are high for this sort-of spin-off of
  The Office’s US version, which sees the team who documented life at Dunder
  Mifflin chronicle the fortunes of a struggling Toledo newspaper. The cast is
  certainly promising: Domhnall Gleeson stars alongside standup Alex Edelman and
  the always tremendous Tim Key. The Inheritance Channel 4, 31 August, 9pm The
  post-Traitors frenzy for machiavellian yet classy reality formats has been
  more miss than hit thus far (sorry, Destination X). Will The Inheritance –
  which sees 12 strangers attempt to convince each other that they alone deserve
  the fortune left by a glam benefactor (played by Elizabeth Hurley) – be
  dastardly enough to change that? The Guest BBC One &amp; iPlayer, 1 September,
  9pm When businesswoman Fran takes new cleaner Ria under her wing, her advice
  leads to a life-changing event for the younger woman. But who really pulls the
  strings in this complex new dynamic? Eve Myles and Gabrielle Creevy star in a
  twisty new Welsh drama from Matthew Barry (Men Up). RA Staying in: Games
  Everybody’s Golf Hot Shots Out 5 September; PC, PS5, Switch Namco’s classic
  family golf game returns with its signature blend of intuitive controls,
  cartoon-style visuals and silly ideas. There are 10 courses to play on and
  dynamic weather to test your rainy day skills, plus a crazy golf mode for less
  serious competitors. Hell Is Us Out 4 September; PC, PS5, Xbox A pitch-dark
  action adventure about the evil of war, which nevertheless features some
  intense combat as disillusioned soldier Rémi wanders a land torn apart by
  civil conflict. Dark Souls meets Elem Klimov’s cult film Come and See: an
  intriguing if disturbing prospect. Keith Stuart * * * Staying in: Albums CMAT
  – Euro-Country Out now Irish singer, songwriter and – if her raucous
  interviews are anything to go by – would-be comedian, Ciara Mary-Alice
  Thompson, AKA CMAT, returns with her third album. It’s full of immaculately
  crafted vignettes that take big themes – politics, self-worth, the
  oversaturation of Jamie Oliver – and turn them into festival-ready anthems.
  Blood Orange – Essex Honey Out now Inspired by a period of intense grief, this
  fifth album from musical polymath Dev Hynes focuses on the more indie-leaning
  feel of his early work. The Field is a beautiful guitar-lead hymn augmented by
  Caroline Polachek’s ghostly harmonies, while Lorde crops up on the folksy Mind
  Loaded. Sabrina Carpenter – Man’s Best Friend Out now A year after going
  stratospheric with the Grammy-winning Short n’ Sweet, Sabrina Carpenter
  returns with a dozen more tongue-in-cheek bops. Lead single Manchild, the
  country-tinged evisceration of an ex, has already gone to No 1 on both sides
  of the Atlantic. Wolf Alice – The Clearing Out now Written in London and
  recorded in LA with super-producer Greg Kurstin (Beck, Adele), The Clearing
  marks another sonic shift for the Mercury prize-winning quartet. Inspired by
  1970s classic rock, songs such as White Horses and lead single Bloom Baby
  Bloom showcase the band’s more playful side. MC * * * Staying in: Brain food
  Movement With Meklit Hadero Podcast Ethiopian-American singer Meklit hosts
  this wide-ranging series exploring the ways that migration informs artists’
  lives. Highlights include an interview with Syrian rapper and poet Omar
  Offendum on the changing identity of Little Syria in Manhattan. The Dream
  Radio Online Artist Tai Shani’s radio broadcast accompanies her large-scale
  installation currently on show in the Somerset House courtyard in London.
  Artists such as Brian Eno and Maxine Peake deliver moving monologues and sound
  pieces on their dreams for alternate futures. The Lost Neanderthals BBC Four,
  3 September, 8pm In 2015, the remains of a Neanderthal were discovered in the
  Mandarin Cave in southern France, prompting research into settlers who existed
  in the area 50,000 years ago. This fascinating film charts new findings. Ammar
  Kalia
