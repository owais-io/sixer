  Airbnb has apologised to a woman after an apartment host falsely claimed she
  had caused thousands of pounds’ worth of damage and used images she says were
  digitally manipulated to back up his allegations. The London-based academic
  was refunded almost £4,300, and an internal review of how the case was dealt
  with has been launched at the short-term accommodation rental company. The
  incident highlights how cheap and easily available artificial intelligence
  software is now being used to manipulate images to give false evidence of what
  has happened in consumer complaints, according to one security expert. The
  woman, who is based in London, had booked the one-bedroom apartment in New
  York’s Manhattan for two-and-a-half months earlier this year to stay in while
  she was studying, but she decided to leave early after feeling unsafe in the
  area. Shortly after she left, the host told Airbnb that she had caused more
  than £12,000 worth of damage, and submitted pictures of an apparently cracked
  coffee table as part of his case. His allegations included that she had
  stained a mattress with urine, and damaged a robot vacuum cleaner, a sofa, a
  microwave, a TV and an air conditioner. The woman denied any damage had been
  done to the apartment. She said she left it in good condition and had only two
  visitors during the seven weeks she stayed. A close examination of two
  pictures of the coffee table appears to show differences in the damage,
  leading the woman to believe they were digitally manipulated or generated by
  AI. She says the host was retaliating because she ended her tenancy early.
  Airbnb initially told her “after careful review of the photos”, she would have
  to reimburse the host a total of £5,314. She appealed against the decision. “I
  informed them that I can provide testimony from an eyewitness who was with me
  during checkout and can attest under oath to the condition in which the
  property was left: clean, undamaged, and in good order,” she says. “I also
  clearly demonstrated visual discrepancies in images of the same object (wooden
  table) provided by the host that show clear signs of fabrication.” She adds:
  “These inconsistencies are simply not possible in genuine, unedited
  photographs of the same object. This should have immediately raised red flags
  and discredited the host’s claims if the evidence had been reviewed with even
  basic scrutiny, but Airbnb not only failed to identify this obvious
  manipulation, they entirely ignored my explanations and clear evidence that
  the material was fabricated.” Five days after Guardian Money raised questions
  about the case with Airbnb, the woman was told it had accepted her appeal and
  credited her account with £500. When she then said she was not going to rebook
  with Airbnb again, the company offered an £854 refund – a fifth of the cost of
  her booking. She refused to accept this and was refunded the full cost
  (£4,269) of her booking, and a negative review that the host had placed on her
  profile was taken down. “My concern is for future customers who may become
  victims of similar fraudulent claims and do not have the means to push back so
  much or give into paying out of fear of escalation,” the woman says. “Given
  the ease with which such images can now be AI-generated and apparently
  accepted by Airbnb despite investigations, it should not be so easy for a host
  to get away with forging evidence in this way.” The man who complained about
  her is listed as a “superhost” on Airbnb, which the site says is someone who
  is experienced and highly rated. He did not respond to a request for comment.
  Airbnb said he had been warned for violating its terms and told he would be
  removed if there was another similar report. The company told him that it
  could not verify the images he submitted as part of his complaint. Airbnb
  apologised and said there would be a review into how her case was handled. “We
  take damage claims seriously – our specialist team reviews all available
  evidence to reach proportionate outcomes for both parties, and to help ensure
  a fair approach, decisions can be appealed.” Serpil Hall, the director of
  economic crime at the management consultants Baringa, said that manipulating
  images and videos was now “easier than ever”, and software to do so was cheap,
  widely available and required little skill to use. In one recent case an
  insurance company found there had been an increase in false claims on vehicles
  and home repairs using photos that had been manipulated. “Recently, many
  companies have decided images can’t be taken at face value any more [during
  disputes], and there is a need for forensic tools and fraud intelligence
  models to validate them.”
