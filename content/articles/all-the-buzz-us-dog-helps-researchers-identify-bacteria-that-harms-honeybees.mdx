  One dog in Michigan hasn’t been content with merely belonging to the species
  famously known as man’s best friend. She has strived to be bees’ best friend,
  too. Maple, a springer spaniel aged nine, is earning news headlines by helping
  Michigan State University (MSU) researchers identify bacteria that is harmful
  for bee colonies. As both the Michigan news outlet WILX and the Associated
  Press told it in reports published on Monday, Maple landed the role after
  spending seven years detecting human remains for a sheriff’s office. She had
  to retire from the sheriff’s office after suffering an injury on the job –
  leaving her handler, Sue Stejskal, in search of something to keep Maple busy.
  “She’s a very over-the-top, enthusiastic, sometimes hard-to-live with dog
  because of her energy level,” Stejskal, who has been training dogs for law
  enforcement and other uses for more than 25 years, said to the AP. Fortunately
  for Stejskal, MSU professor Meghan Milbrath was seeking out tools to screen
  and diagnose diseases that sicken honeybees, which her lab studies. A
  veterinarian who had taken part in a training about honeybees later put
  Stejksal and Milbrath in touch. And soon, the pair hatched a plan by which
  Stejskal taught Maple to apply her police canine detection methods in beehives
  to uncover American foulbrood – a bacterial disease that poses a deadly threat
  to honeybee larvae. The work Maple has since done for MSU’s Pollinator
  Performance Center has been crucial, with bees and other pollinators in a
  years-long decline stemming from diseases, insecticides, a lack of a diverse
  food supply and climate change driven by human emissions of greenhouse gases.
  “American foulbrood … harms … young developing bees, and when a hive gets
  infected, it actually basically leads to death,” Milbrath, an assistant
  professor in MSU’s entomology department, said to WILX. The consequences for
  beekeepers can be devastating, costing them the loss of infected honey crops
  and requiring them to burn affected equipment. “Beekeepers … have had to burn
  tens of thousands of dollars of equipment due to this disease,” Milbrath said
  to WILX. Maple carries out her duties in a distinctive, yellow protective
  suit. Her gear includes a veil for her head and four bootees worn on her paws
  to shield Maple in case she steps on a bee. “If a dog is going to be in an
  active bee yard, they need to wear the same personal protective equipment as
  people do,” Stejskal, an MSU graduate, told the AP. She said properly
  outfitting Maple has required “altering and testing” because one can’t simply
  go to a vendor like Amazon for the gear she needs, mainly because it isn’t
  sold with dogs in mind. About 465 bee species are native to Michigan alone.
  Among the goals of training Maple to spot American foulbrood for the
  Pollinator Performance Center was to create a guidebook with which other dogs
  could be similarly taught, WILX noted. Stejskal told the AP that the
  importance of Maple helping mitigate one risk confronting bees as much as
  possible was obvious. “It’s a cool project,” she said. Yet, she added, there
  was another benefit to Maple’s new calling. “I was over-the-moon excited
  because my dog would have joy in her life and would still be able to work,”
  Stejskal said. The Associated Press contributed reporting
