  Ninety minutes before kick-off, a couple of digivans poking fun at Wrexham
  completed another lap of St Mary’s, whizzing past with an LED billboard that
  read: “Who needs Hollywood?” with the letters of Southampton studded in the
  Californian hills. On this evidence the Welsh club – back at this level for
  the first time since 1982 after an extraordinary rise from non-league – are
  sure to be a fun addition to the Championship, but how they were given a
  galling reminder of the step up, Saints scoring twice in the final nine
  minutes to earn a comeback win and a first under Will Still. For Southampton,
  there was finally that winning feeling, with a first home league victory since
  November. Phil Parkinson was encouraged, despite the sour ending for the
  visitors. “I took a moment when the lads ran out for the warm-up and just
  reflected because where we’ve come from to be playing on a stage like this
  today was very special,” he said. “The new lads came in and did really well
  and so did the existing players – that gives us great heart for the season. It
  was a very proud day for the club, playing at this level and there were a lot
  of positives.” Two years ago, Southampton were operating four divisions higher
  than their opponents, ending 2022-23 against Liverpool while Wrexham signed
  off from the National League at Torquay. It is only four years since the
  journey to this point under the ownership of Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney
  began; they started 2021-22 at Solihull Moors in front of a crowd of 2,196,
  while Saints were beginning a 10th straight season in the top flight. Here
  they were as equals, duking it out on a pristine glossy surface a world away
  from Damson Park. Max Cleworth and Ryan Barnett – both on the pitch that day,
  the latter for Solihull – also started here. There were no A-listers present
  but the Saints owner, Dragan Solak, and the former Saints vice-chair Les Reed
  who is now a Wrexham adviser, were in attendance. Until the final minute of
  regular time it appeared Wrexham would start the season with a victory
  courtesy of a first-half penalty, awarded after Ronnie Edwards barged Kieffer
  Moore and converted by Josh Windass, one of seven Wrexham debutants, six of
  whom were in the starting lineup. Parkinson was adamant Edwards should have
  been sent off given he made no attempt to play the ball but the referee, James
  Bell, informed the Wrexham manager he felt there was a covering defender.
  Edwards somehow escaped without a booking. “It is a gamechanging moment if
  they go down to 10 men,” Parkinson said. Saints came close to levelling in
  first-half stoppage time, the busy 18-year-old Jay Robinson striking a post
  before Conor Coady prevented Adam Armstrong from firing in the rebound. Still,
  at 32 the youngest manager in the English Football League, rested hands on
  head trying to make sense of it all. Wrexham were accomplished, Windass
  striking the bar before opening the scoring, but gradually lost their grip on
  an entertaining game. The arrival of Mateus Fernandes, who has numerous
  top-flight admirers, on the hour helped the hosts. Moore’s departure with an
  ankle injury early in the second half also hampered Wrexham. Southampton
  dialled up the pressure. Wrexham missed chances to double their lead; Lewis
  O’Brien, their £3m record signing, was ushered off the ball when through on
  goal and the substitute Ryan Hardie, another new face, forced Gavin Bazunu
  into an instinctive left-handed save on 87 minutes. In between those episodes
  Parkinson enjoyed an amusing back and forth with the home fans after Sam
  Smith’s tug on Joshua Quarshie in the box went unpunished. Cleworth, on a
  booking, was fortunate to avoid being penalised for handling a Shea Charles
  shot within two minutes of the restart. Those chances whirled in Parkinson’s
  mind when the substitute Ryan Manning levelled, leathering a superb free-kick
  into the top corner from 25 yards. Manning was instrumental in the winner,
  too. He chested Charles’s raking diagonal pass, teeing up Damion Downs. The US
  forward – also a summer signing – fluffed his lines from a couple of yards out
  but the Southampton captain, Jack Stephens, was alive at the back post to
  apply the finish, the ball cannoning in off the underside of the bar. For
  Stephens, it was a cathartic moment, an outpouring of emotion and a timely
  retort to his critics. At a fans’ forum in the week, on the eve of a new era,
  the Southampton technical director, Johannes Spors, was forced to defend the
  decision to hand Stephens a fresh three-year contract. At the final whistle,
  Stephens kissed the captain’s armband and seemingly did some soul-searching,
  staring deep into the stands. Still said: “We know Stevo gets a fair bit of
  criticism – he’s made mistakes and he probably knows that better than anyone –
  but he’s a really good human being and deserves his goal.” Parkinson,
  meanwhile, stood deflated, hands on hips; his opposite number perhaps put it
  best. “Welcome to the Championship,” Still said. “It’s just crazy, isn’t it?”
