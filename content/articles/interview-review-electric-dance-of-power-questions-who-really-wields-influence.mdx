  Interview review – electric dance of power questions who really wields
  influence

  There’s something fascinating about the game of an interview: the push and
  pull of questions, the possibility of revelation or deceit. It is in this
  dance of power that Teunkie Van Der Sluijs’s adaptation of Theo Van Gogh’s
  2003 film finds its thrill – albeit in scattered flashes. Reimagined for a
  modern-day setting, with reference to viral content, curated online profiles
  and followers, the play asks what it means to be truthful in a world of
  pretence. Old-school political journalist Pierre (a commanding Robert Sean
  Leonard) begrudgingly arrives in Brooklyn to interview the social media and
  film star of the moment, Katya (Paten Hughes). Meanwhile, the place he
  actually wants to be, Washington DC, spins into a political frenzy over the
  impeachment of the US vice president. Before even meeting his interviewee,
  Pierre has dismissed Katya as a vacuous, fame-hungry influencer. But as the
  evening rolls on, he realises she may be sharper than he has given her credit
  for. It is a clash that sparks discussions about gender, celebrity and who
  really has influence. Sure, they’re knotty issues but it’s hardly new ground,
  and the script would benefit from a shot of something fresh. Leonard and
  Hughes make the stage into a battlefield; both are careful not to expose the
  wrong things. Their fast-paced spurs and spats are electric. The camera
  remains central to Van Der Sluijs’s contemporary direction. Screens are
  projected on to the back wall of Katya’s flat (a feat of architectural detail
  by Derek McLane), showing streams of likes for her content. She films herself
  talking directly to her fans, casually calling them “besties”. Trolls’ typed
  words pop up in Twitter-style captions, while the power of the lens is a
  constant fear. Even when the writing wobbles, the production maintains a state
  of uneasy, absorbing tension. • Interview is at Riverside Studios, London,
  until 27 September
