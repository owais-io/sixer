  It’s one of those topics that comes up over drinks or dinner at the moment:
  whether or not you think AI is going to steal your job. So far, I’ve felt
  relatively confident that while AI could no doubt have a fair crack at writing
  a newspaper opinion column, there is something I do as part of my work that AI
  cannot: reporting. Except now, it seems, AI is claiming to be doing that as
  well. Last week, it was revealed that at least six reputable publications have
  had to take down published articles because it turned out that they were
  probably pieces of fiction written by AI and then passed off by somebody as
  works of journalism under the name of Margaux Blanchard. One of these was a
  piece for Wired titled They Fell in Love Playing Minecraft. Then the Game
  Became Their Wedding Venue, which quoted a “digital celebrant” called Jessica
  Hu, who does not seem to actually exist. Another publication, called Dispatch,
  received a pitch from “Blanchard” about an ex-mining town called Gravemont
  that had been repurposed as a training ground for death investigation.
  Gravemont doesn’t exist either. When I get into social conversations on
  subjects like ChatGPT, I try to fight the red mist that descends on me. I hate
  ChatGPT. And I call it hatred because it provokes a physical reaction in me of
  something just below real anger. I don’t find it scary, or annoying, or
  confusing. I hate it. So I’ve been trying to get to the bottom of what it is
  exactly that I hate. There are decent reasons to rejoice at the advent of the
  AI age. It seems likely that it will have the capacity to revolutionise, for
  instance, scientific endeavour: a scientist friend of mine described how AI
  would speed up the process of coming up with and testing hypotheses in his
  field. Mundane work tasks will also take less time with the help of AI. But
  there are also plenty of reasons to chafe against it. There’s the
  well-documented environmental impact of using ChatGPT. But with respect to
  Earth, this isn’t the element that has me wringing my hands the most. It’s not
  even that people are actively buying into a piece of technology that is likely
  to make many of their own jobs obsolete, or the way that the AI overviews on,
  say, a Google search often blithely give you straight-up wrong information.
  Nor the fact that the people at the forefront of the AI revolution have the
  crashingly terrible vibes of your classic tech bro loser. Here’s the part I
  suspect may be too tragically reactionary of me: I am worried that a reliance
  on ChatGPT will erode people’s ability to use their brains. I do believe that
  the creative imagination in particular is a muscle, and one that is rewarding
  to exercise. Recently I was helping a seven-year-old work on her creative
  writing for school. She had to describe a forest, so I asked her to close her
  eyes and picture one, and tell me what she could see. Oh, we didn’t need to do
  that, she told me. We could just ask AI to make one. I heard secondhand about
  an editor asking ChatGPT for help restructuring an article. And again, call me
  a luddite, but I just thought: no! Some things are supposed to be difficult!
  It is good for the brain to have to rise to a task! I read about someone using
  ChatGPT to order from a restaurant menu. It is one of the small joys of life
  to select what food you want to eat at a restaurant. Why cede that to a
  machine when you don’t have to? But that’s not even the worst of it, in my
  view. The worst of it is the way ChatGPT seems to be creeping into people’s
  personal lives. Using ChatGPT to design a workout plan, to fix a problem in
  some coding or to summarise a dense document, fine, fine, fine. If you like.
  But when I hear about people using it to write a birthday card, a best man’s
  speech or a breakup text, a tiny part of my soul dies. And I don’t think this
  is the high and mighty position of someone who’s a writer by trade. None of
  these pieces of writing need to be perfectly expressed or grammatically
  flawless. They need to come from the heart and be real. At the root of my
  hatred of ChatGPT is that people’s willingness to use it in this way implies
  they are happy to turn meaningful interactions like these into something
  transactional: a task to be completed efficiently and moved on from. So much
  of the value of, say, receiving a letter, whether emailed or in the post,
  comes from knowing that somebody sat down and thought about what to say. A
  human being spent some of their precious time and mental effort on
  communicating with you. I am well aware that in 15 years’ time I may be
  wrapping up my seamlessly AI-optimised work day, turning to my AI-powered
  AutoSpouse and laughing at this article. How naive I was, worried about
  nothing! I love you, machine programmed to mimic love! I realise, too, that my
  hatred of ChatGPT might one day relegate me to the scrap heap in terms of
  future employment opportunities, for not knowing how to wrangle AI into doing
  things for me. Fine. I’ll go and live in the woods and be miserable. But I
  will be miserable in an analogue manner, and with my ability to think intact.
