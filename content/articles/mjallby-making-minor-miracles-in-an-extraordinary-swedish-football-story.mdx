  For Mjällby’s opponents, a trip to the far south of Sweden feels like a
  journey to the Earth’s end. “When teams come on here on the bus they drive and
  drive, through the farms, past the fishing harbours,” says Hasse Larsson.
  “They keep driving and then, when they can’t drive any further, they find our
  stadium.” They discover an institution whose heart and soul are rooted in
  Sölvesborg, a remote municipality of 14,000 inhabitants. Nowadays they find a
  club front and centre of an extraordinary story unfolding in Allsvenskan, the
  country’s top flight. Mjällby are four points clear at the top with 12 games
  left; they have lost once and, should they escape intact from a visit to the
  champions Malmö on Saturday, the unlikeliest of dreams will become vivid. “I
  couldn’t have imagined this, no way,” says Larsson, the sporting director, who
  has occupied a variety of roles since joining as a player in 1979. He spent
  nine seasons captaining a club that climbed from the bottom before yo-yoing
  between the divisions. “We’ve never been in this situation before, but here we
  are. We are a really good team now and we have a chance.” Establishing Mjällby
  at the top level has been viewed externally as a minor miracle. This is no
  story of a sugar daddy pumping money into obscure rural arrivistes; that
  would, in any case, be difficult given Sweden’s fan-controlled ownership
  model. “We don’t have the muscles to buy expensive players,” Larsson says. “If
  you’re to achieve something in this place, you have to work hard.” Larsson
  remembers growing up on the family’s farm, which he later took over, and
  slipping out to train despite his father’s insistence that work needed doing
  at home. Farming kept paying the bills when, in 2016, he took his current
  position at a club that had sunk to the third tier. Mjällby were financially
  stricken. “I did the job for three years without pay,” he says. “We had to
  start all over again and find people who could help us.” That year only a
  final-day victory at Prespa Birlik, in Malmö, spared them a further relegation
  and likely oblivion. Mjällby play a few yards from the sea in Hällevik, which
  has a population of less than 1,000, at the compact Strandvallen. The village
  bearing their name accommodates around 1,300. It would have been natural to
  seek answers further afield. But it is under Anders Torstensson, their
  straight-talking but gregarious manager, that their fortunes have soared.
  Torstensson had been a young player at Mjällby, reaching the first-team squad
  in 1985 but leaving without making an appearance before spending a decade in
  the military. He became a school headteacher and, simultaneously, took on
  various coaching roles locally in the early 2000s. “I’d never had any thoughts
  of a coaching career,” the 59-year-old Torstensson says of those early days.
  It was a path that led him back to Mjällby and an appointment as assistant
  coach in 2007. “This was an even smaller club back then,” he says. He was part
  of a promotion to Allsvenskan in 2010 and, for a few years, quit his day job
  to focus on the club. A first spell as manager resulted in 2013 but he left
  after a year, the club’s pecuniary woes starting to bite, and resumed his work
  as a principal. “We were in Allsvenskan but it was really a semi-professional
  club,” he says. “Most of the players had jobs on the side, we were training
  late afternoons, only me and my assistant were full-time. We had a goalkeeping
  coach two times a week; we had a kit man working full-time on his own
  business. We had a medic who worked full-time as a teacher. We didn’t have a
  gym. We had one meal together after Thursday training and the economic
  situation was really, really poor.” During a brief return in 2021 he steadied
  a ship that, having plumbed the depths, was back in the top flight but
  struggling. Life at the school remained rewarding but, two years later,
  Mjällby came back with an offer he could not refuse. They wanted him back for
  the long term. “I told them I’d barely been in professional football since
  2013 and everything had changed,” he says. “I said: ‘I’m not the best
  instructor, not the best coach, not the best tactically.’ And they replied:
  ‘Yeah, pretty much, but we don’t care because you win games.’ I recognised
  that, if I turned them down, my prospects in football would be over. I loved
  my job, but it felt like now or never.” Torstensson lauds the impact of his
  old friend Magnus Emeus, who became chair in 2016 and transformed the finances
  through smart budgeting. Like Larsson, he highlights the mentality honed in a
  place that, to supporters of Sweden’s bigger-city clubs, appears inhospitable
  to elite football. “There’s a saying that we’re the country cousins,” he says.
  “Perhaps people underestimated us for a few years. But now I can say for sure
  that everyone is really impressed with the cousins. We cherish the David
  against Goliath mentality. We’re a good team but we’re still a very small club
  and region, and proud of it. And that’s one thing that keeps us going.”
  Nonetheless he tells the tale of a friend’s school in Dalarna, 400 miles
  north, where children fight among themselves at breaktime to play as
  table-topping Mjällby. “So we’re making some noise, actually,” he says with a
  smile. For all Torstensson’s old-school manner, his team have made waves with
  a progressive style that eschews stereotypes of long balls and burly farm
  boys. They finished fifth last season and have kicked on. Mjällby’s squad
  mixes local heroes such as Jesper Gustavsson, the long-serving captain, with
  imaginatively unearthed unknowns such as the midfielder Elliot Stroud and the
  Pakistan defender Abdullah Iqbal, who joined from the Danish second-tier club
  B.93. Scouting is overseen by Arvid Franzen, who is based a six-hour drive
  away in Eskilstuna and works from 6.30am until 3pm as a postman. Franzen will
  join the club full-time later this year. The arrival last year of Karl Marius
  Aksum, a Norwegian who had no experience at professional level, as an
  assistant coach has transformed Mjällby’s attack. “He’s been a huge part in
  taking the next step,” Torstensson says. Mjällby have become a team that can
  dominate; Aksum’s innovations have complemented a staff that otherwise have
  the Sölvesborg region in their blood. There is the sense of a community taking
  huge strides through football. “It was always a family club, just like it is
  now,” Larsson says. In every close-knit group there are personal hardships and
  Mjällby is no exception. Larsson has recovered from a brain tumour and
  prostate cancer. “It was a hard time but I was 100% about coming back both to
  my family and to football, the two things I love most,” he says. “It took some
  time but that’s my way, I fight to the end.” Then, last August, Torstensson
  was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, a non-aggressive form of the
  condition. “They say you don’t die of it, you die with it,” he says. “So for
  now I can live my life as usual. I’ve accepted the diagnosis and try to leave
  it in the hospital. I’m aware things could change in six months, but if it
  does there are good treatments. “It was a tough one, telling my family, but
  after 24 hours I decided I had a choice between taking it from here or lying
  down and crying. In the end I only took one week off, and even then I was
  following the team. Then I came back at 100%, and I’m happy.” Last weekend,
  with no game scheduled, Torstensson visited a music festival with his wife. On
  Tuesday he was in Malmö to watch Saturday’s opponents contest a goalless draw
  in their Champions League qualifier with Copenhagen, inwardly hoping they feel
  the effects of a derby. He thinks his players have learned from the circus
  around an appearance in the cup final two years ago, when they lost 4-1 to
  Häcken; their league position has, he claims, never arisen in conversation
  with the squad. “I know we’re in a very good situation, but if you start
  thinking about that then it’s a very difficult path to walk,” he says. “I
  haven’t seen any signs from the group that they’re flying away.” Instead
  Mjällby work to the rhythms of this time-hewn, grounded locality. “It’s still
  the same old farts sitting on a bench and watching our open training
  sessions,” Torstensson says. “If we win it’s: ‘Hey, good game.’ If we lose:
  ‘It wasn’t good.’ Then you just say the same: ‘No, it wasn’t’ – and the
  discussion is over. Then we keep working to the next game.” Tradition,
  ambition and a dash of magic breed the feeling Mjällby are nowhere near the
  end of the road.
