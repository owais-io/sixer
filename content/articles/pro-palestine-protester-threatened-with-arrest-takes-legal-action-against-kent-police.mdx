  A protester who was threatened with arrest under the Terrorism Act for holding
  a Palestinian flag and having signs saying “Free Gaza” and “Israel is
  committing genocide” is taking legal action against the police force involved.
  Armed police told Laura Murton, 42, that her demonstration in Canterbury,
  Kent, last month expressed views supportive of Palestine Action, which had
  been banned under terrorism legislation earlier in July. Murton said neither
  of her signs mentioned Palestine Action. When asked directly whether she
  supported any proscribed organisations, she replied: “I do not.” Her
  solicitors have now issued a letter of claim on her behalf to the chief
  constable of Kent police in what was also said to be a move to remind other
  police forces of their responsibilities when it comes to peaceful protests by
  pro-Palestine demonstrators this weekend. Murton will be seeking damages and
  intends to donate any compensation to Palestinian causes, as well as an
  apology and details of what has happened to any information that the police
  recorded about her. Shamik Dutta from Bhatt Murphy, who is representing
  Murton, said: “The legal challenge is being brought because as matters stand
  our client has neither received any apology nor any acknowledgment that Kent
  police conduct has been unlawful. “She has had no indication that no further
  action will be taken against her in relation to her protest on 14 July 2025 or
  that no further action will be taken against her if she wishes to engage in a
  materially similar protest in the future.” In the encounter last month, which
  Murton filmed, one officer told her: “Mentioning freedom of Gaza, Israel,
  genocide, all of that all come under proscribed groups, which are terror
  groups that have been dictated by the government.” He went on to say that the
  phrase “free Gaza” was “supportive of Palestine Action”, adding that it was an
  offence “to express an opinion or belief that is supportive of a proscribed
  organisation, namely Palestine Action is an offence under section 12(1A) of
  the Terrorism Act”. The officer told her she had committed that offence. The
  officers said they would arrest Murton unless she provided her name and
  address, which she reluctantly agreed to do. Kent police were approached for
  comment.
