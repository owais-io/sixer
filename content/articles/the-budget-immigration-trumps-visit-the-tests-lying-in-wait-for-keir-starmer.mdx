  As Keir Starmer returns from his summer break in Europe, and Labour MPs head
  back to Westminster for the new parliamentary session, the government will be
  hoping to get on the front foot after a tumultuous few months. The recess has
  given ministers time to think, and to plan, but also the chance to study the
  polls. This week, YouGov put Labour on just 20% – the lowest level in more
  than five years – and eight points behind Nigel Farage’s Reform UK. Already
  bruised by internal rows, public criticism and a failure to get a grip of big
  issues such as the economy and migration, Starmer’s government desperately
  needs to reassert itself and gain some momentum. But there are lots of
  difficult moments ahead. The budget When Labour’s former shadow chancellor
  Anneliese Dodds told the Guardian at the start of the summer that the Treasury
  should consider a wealth tax to close the growing gap in the public finances,
  Rachel Reeves was unequivocal. “I think we’ve got the balance right in terms
  of how we tax those with the broadest shoulders,” she said, citing higher
  levies on private jets and second homes, and increased capital gains tax, as
  well as scrapping non-dom status. Yet the chancellor is now in a trickier
  predicament, with experts suggesting the government spending gap is on course
  to reach more than £40bn after a slowdown in economic growth and
  higher-than-expected inflation. With extra borrowing likely to spook financial
  markets and ministers already struggling to stay within departmental spending
  limits – and Reeves determined to stick to her own fiscal rules – the
  chancellor returns to work pondering which tax rises would be the least
  unpalatable option. Labour has already ruled out putting up income tax,
  national insurance or VAT – which could have potentially raked in billions –
  in order to stick to a manifesto pledge. The Treasury has spent the summer
  flying kites to test different options, including raising more money from
  inheritance tax and putting up capital gains tax on expensive homes. But
  wherever she lands, Reeves has a tough task explaining tax rises to the
  public. The chancellor is already considering delaying the budget until
  November to give her more time. Party discipline After a bruising few weeks
  during which angry Labour MPs fronted up to Downing Street over welfare cuts,
  forcing the government into a dramatic climbdown, and Starmer came under
  pressure from his own cabinet to immediately recognise Palestine as a state,
  both backbenchers and the government were in need of a break. “We’re all
  totally frazzled,” one No 10 adviser told the Guardian before recess. “We went
  straight from the election campaign into government and haven’t had a day off
  in months.” While the lack of announcements and press conferences over the
  summer alarmed some MPs, who feared it created space that was occupied by
  Farage, it also gave Downing Street an opportunity to reflect and reset.
  Starmer has used it to shake up his top team, including bringing in a new
  chief economic adviser to challenge Treasury thinking, and more internal
  changes are expected. The prime minister is also expected to reshuffle his
  junior ministers, to reward the rising stars of the 2024 intake and speed up
  delivery, as well as punishing those who plotted against the welfare plans and
  replacing his homelessness minister. Sources suggested, however, that the
  cabinet will remain intact for now. The political side of No 10, chastened by
  the welfare debacle, intends to put greater emphasis on the relationship with
  MPs, including making sure they get face time with Starmer himself. With more
  potentially divisive issues coming up – including Send reform and the
  government’s child poverty strategy – they are desperate to avoid further
  parliamentary battles. But Labour MPs are anxious about being squeezed by the
  new Jeremy Corbyn-led party on the left and Farage’s Reform UK on the right,
  and have shown themselves willing to flex their muscles. Trump state visit
  When Keir Starmer handed over a letter to Donald Trump in the Oval Office in
  February, with an invitation from the king for a second state visit, there was
  a muted response back home. While the US president remains unpopular in the
  UK, there is an understanding that it is in Britain’s interests to have a good
  relationship with the White House. So far, and despite the odds, Starmer has
  achieved that. Trump has even stated that he likes the prime minister “a lot”
  even though, with Starmer being a “liberal”, the two men have very different
  politics. Yet as both that meeting in Washington and Trump’s subsequent talks
  with Starmer at his Ayrshire golf course showed, any visit with Trump is also
  a diplomatic nightmare. Often played out in front of the world’s media, the US
  president has no qualms about dipping into sensitive domestic issues such as
  free speech, tax rises or his friendship with Farage. While he may well be on
  his best behaviour as he enjoys Charles and Camilla’s hospitality at Windsor
  Castle, it could easily go wrong elsewhere. If the whim takes him, Trump could
  unpick the economic deal already agreed with the UK or even decide to impose
  further tariffs. The two governments are already at odds on the Gaza crisis,
  with Starmer planning to formally recognise the Palestinian state at the UN,
  while Trump gives the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, cover.
  Starmer will also push for the US to (finally) offer firm security guarantees
  for Ukraine, after Trump’s talks with Vladimir Putin emboldened the Russian
  president. Starmer will be walking a diplomatic tightrope on multiple fronts.
  Brace, brace! Migration By Westminster standards, this was a quiet summer
  recess, yet while government ministers settled into their sun loungers, a
  vacuum emerged. It was quickly filled by Nigel Farage. Against a backdrop of
  rising small boat crossings and protests outside hotels that house asylum
  seekers, getting a grip on Britain’s borders is now one of the most pressing
  issues facing the government. While ministers blame the irregular migration
  crisis on the mess they inherited from the last Tory government, it is now
  Labour that is getting the blame. Starmer’s incremental approach – speeding up
  asylum processing, reviewing article 8 of the ECHR, striking a returns deal
  with the French – is not, thus far, satisfying the public clamour. To the
  discomfort of many on the left, polls show that immigration is now regarded as
  one of the most important issues facing the country. It doesn’t look likely to
  get any easier for the government, with further protests expected at asylum
  hotels after the court of appeal decision on the Bell hotel in Epping, and
  Reform intent on exploiting community tensions – and frustration with the
  government – to its political benefit. Labour will try to take the fight to
  Farage at its autumn conference, but it could backfire. And it only has a few
  months until next spring’s local elections – the party’s first big electoral
  test since it came to power – to show it can get on track.
