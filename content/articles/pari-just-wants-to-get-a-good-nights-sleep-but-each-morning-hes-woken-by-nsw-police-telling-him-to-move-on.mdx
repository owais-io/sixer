  Pari Nikau was woken by being hit in the face with a shovel. He had been
  sleeping in a shed on a rooftop near Sydney’s CBD and he thought he was safe.
  He remembers playing dead, then blackness. Hours later, he woke at St
  Vincent’s hospital, where his head was being stapled. Two weeks after the 16
  June assault, Nikau was told he was being discharged. “I said, ‘I don’t have
  money, I’m homeless’,” says Nikau, who does not qualify for housing assistance
  from the government as he is from New Zealand and is not an Australian
  citizen. “The hospital shouldn’t have let me out unless they knew I’d be cared
  for.” Sign up: AU Breaking News email Nikau briefly moved to a centre that
  provides accommodation and healthcare to homeless people, before losing that
  spot. Now Nikau is among a group of rough sleepers at Sydney’s Central station
  struggling with changing rules. Earlier this month, after a string of
  increasingly restrictive rules, they were told to move from a sheltered area
  between 6am until midnight. “I was in pain, I moved [to Central station]
  because I need to sleep,” Nikau says. “And every time I do, they come over and
  yell at me to move on. I’m over having to repack. I can’t start again.”
  ‘Inconveniencing passengers’ Since the latest change, Nikau and his friends
  have moved from the light rail stop to a partially covered area out of the way
  of passengers. They’re still woken at 6am but they can return once the morning
  peak hour is over. But there’s nowhere to sit, forcing them to huddle on the
  floor, exposed to the elements. Nikau still has his arm in a cast and is still
  recovering from multiple wounds. Amanda, who did not want her surname
  published, has been sleeping at the station for two-and-a-half years. She says
  Transport for NSW told her the rules had changed due to the “flow of
  commuters” and “inconveniencing passengers”. “This train station is publicly
  funded, so why aren’t we allowed to stay here?” Amanda says. Amanda still
  stays on the benches near the light rail stop – she has back problems and
  needs seating. She keeps her belongings tidy: a few suitcases, some backpacks
  covered in plastic sheeting. So far, she hasn’t been reprimanded, but she says
  the police treat them “like we’re children”. “They wake us up like it’s a
  school day,” she says. “How are we inconveniencing people when we’re not in
  the way of traffic? It’s ridiculous.” A NSW police spokesperson says officers
  can issue move on directions if a person is causing, or is likely to cause,
  inconvenience to other people on railway premises. “Failure to comply with a
  move on direction can result in a fine or removal from the premises. “Being
  homeless is not an offence and NSW police will continue to work with the
  community and help homeless people make contact with appropriate services if
  needed.” ‘Where are people supposed to go?’ Kylie Emery, who has been sleeping
  at Central station while grappling with complex trauma and PTSD, has been
  looking out for Nikau. She’s been recovering from the “worst flu of [her]
  life”. “We can’t use the benches because they say we’re disrupting commuters,
  so I’ve been sleeping in wet clothes in the pouring rain,” she says. Transport
  for NSW has recently begun confiscating or disposing of belongings left
  unattended. Last month, an unattributed poster warned homeless people at
  Central station to remove their belongings or they would be “disposed of”,
  which a spokesperson for Transport for NSW says was a directive from NSW
  police. “People looking for their items are referred to the station office
  where they are assisted,” they say. “If unattended belongings are moved, they
  are able to be collected. Sydney Trains will hold belongings for at least 24
  hours.” Stephen Devine, who has been staying near the light rail stop for the
  past few weeks, has been helping to guard his friends’ belongings. He says one
  elderly woman went to get hand surgery last Friday and stayed in hospital
  overnight. The next morning, all her things were taken. Although she was able
  to recover her things, he worried that if she had come back a day later her
  belongings would have been binned – something he says he has seen happen to
  other people. Nikau also found his items had been taken when he returned from
  the smoking area. After asking a number of people, he found his belongings
  next to some rubbish bins. Kira Levin, a solicitor at the Justice and Equity
  Centre, says police can only move people on in public areas in accordance with
  the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act, which covers instances
  where people are obstructing persons or traffic. She says authorised officers
  can also remove property if it’s unattended, but there’s also a specific
  protocol for homeless people in public spaces – which requires that notice be
  given. She says the poster was “not appropriate and not clear” as it didn’t
  specify who was giving the order. “Creating this confusion is really not
  helpful.” Levin says instead of police instructing the homeless people to move
  on, they should talk to them and find out “why there are a growing number of
  people sleeping there”. “Where are people supposed to go is my question,” she
  says. “There’s a limited number of places in Sydney where there’s shelter and
  CCTV.” A worsening problem According to a state government count, the number
  of rough sleepers has grown by nearly 70% in five years, from 1,314 in 2020 to
  2,192 in 2025. Levin says many have difficulty finding temporary accommodation
  or social housing, as they can lack identification, be unable to pay or may
  not be a permanent resident. “You need to engage with people in a way that’s
  trauma informed, explaining what’s happening, and giving options about where
  they’re supposed to go,” she says. The NSW minister for homelessness, Rose
  Jackson, says she is “absolutely concerned about the situation at Central
  station”. “No one should be forced to live rough. It’s not safe, it’s not
  dignified and we have a responsibility to do better,” she says. “We’ve already
  surged services in the area to connect people with support, accommodation and
  long-term housing pathways.” Jackson says the state government has provided
  the largest investment in homelessness services in NSW history, including a
  $6.6bn Building Homes for NSW program, focused on social housing and
  homelessness support. “We know the system hasn’t worked. But we are rebuilding
  it,” she says. “People experiencing homelessness are not problems to be
  managed.” For Nikau, all he wants is a place to rest and recuperate. “I’m
  constantly scared to sleep,” he says. “Where is the compassion? I don’t get
  the support a lot of other people do but I always want to help others. I’ll
  give someone my spare shoes. But people just ignore us.” With additional
