  Fires Which Burned Brightly by Sebastian Faulks review – a grief-infused
  puzzle of a memoir
sectionName: Books

bodyText: >-
  In this not-quite-a-memoir, the novelist Sebastian Faulks gives a fine-grained
  account of growing up in post-second world war England. In the home counties
  cottage he shares with his parents and older brother, olive oil does duty not
  in the kitchen but as a bathroom remedy for bunged-up ears. If you are lucky
  enough to have a telephone (the Faulks are), it will probably be a “party”
  line shared with the people next door. Holidays consist of an icy week in
  Bexhill-on-Sea or, a step up, the Isle of Wight (just as cold but with a nicer
  class of ice-cream). Then there are all those tight-lipped middle-aged men
  busying themselves mowing the lawn and going to work in mysterious “offices”.
  Not so long ago they were shooting down Germans or trying to survive the north
  African desert. Faulks’s own father is one of these heroes in hiding – a
  provincial solicitor in a failing practice who won the Military Cross for
  service in Tunisia. Another is Commander Sanderson, the headteacher of the
  prep school to which Faulks is dispatched at the age of eight. It is
  impossible not to feel freshly affronted by a system that routinely sent
  privileged boys away from home in order to make a certain kind of man of them.
  No surprise either that at this point Faulks retreats into the third person,
  as if the obscenity is still too raw to tell directly. “A hopeful, credulous
  little boy is being unpicked and discontinued. He’s like a creature in a
  science-fiction story that’s been sent back to have its factory settings
  altered.” Initially, it looks as though Faulks has emerged unscathed: he
  becomes head boy, wins scholarships to Wellington and then on to Cambridge.
  But something happens in his second year at university. Exactly what isn’t
  clear because, once again, he retreats into grammatical obscurity: “There were
  meetings with doctors, pills … panic attacks, agoraphobia, white nights of
  insomnia.” The only thing that helps him is listening on repeat to Procol
  Harum’s Fires (Which Burnt Brightly), a keening lament for youthful idealism.
  The rest of the book proceeds in this same puzzling way, hinting at depths
  that fail to take on a discernible shape. Instead, Faulks drops clues – for
  himself perhaps as much as for us – by recounting those many moments in life
  when he has found himself ambushed by grief. Sitting in the archives at the
  Imperial War Museum, researching the western front for the book that will
  become Birdsong, he stuffs a handkerchief in his mouth to stop himself from
  sobbing. Another time, reading from the novel in a Chicago bookshop, he breaks
  down completely, taking the audience with him. Later, this time on a plane and
  with no one looking, he tears up at Captain Corelli’s Mandolin, Louis de
  Bernières’ account of the Italian occupation of Cephalonia during the second
  world war. Frustratingly, Faulks doesn’t identify what exactly is being
  catalysed in him by these stories of catastrophic loss. Is it the realisation
  that it was young men like him who bore the brunt of industrialised warfare in
  the 20th century? Or does the trauma press more directly on the psychological
  wounds that opened up with that annihilation at the age of eight? Or perhaps
  another kind of generational trauma is in play: only at the very end of the
  book does Faulks reveal his beloved mother’s own terrible early years at the
  hands of an erratic father (a Somme survivor) and an alcoholic stepmother who
  treated her with “appalling cruelty”. In his foreword, Faulks warns that this
  is going to be a “mongrel” book. It started life as a series of “essays on the
  things that had meant the most to me” during a career that stretched back to
  the raffish Fleet Street of the 1970s. Faulks’s publishers, though, had other
  ideas, and asked him to scrap the “least autobiographical” parts and rearrange
  the remainder in a chronological sequence. The result is a text that reads
  like a tussle, with Faulks steering away from anything that reads as memoir,
  while an unseen editorial hand shoves him just as firmly towards it. • Fires
  Which Burned Brightly: A Life in Progress by Sebastian Faulks is published by
  Hutchinson Heinemann (£20). To support the Guardian, order your copy at
