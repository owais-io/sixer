  Caught Stealing Comic book author and novelist Charlie Huston adapts his own
  cult bestseller of the same title, Darren Aronofsky directs – and this comedy
  certainly signals a shift in tone after his last movie, body-image tragedy The
  Whale. Austin Butler stars as ex-baseball-player Hank Thompson who gets mixed
  up in the seedy underbelly of crime in 90s New York. • 29 August The Roses
  Benedict Cumberbatch and Olivia Colman star in this new version of the acrid
  satire of marital breakdown last filmed in 1989 as The War of the Roses with
  Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner and audiences will be keen to see if this
  new movie matches its predecessor’s devastating final shot. Certainly
  Cumberbatch and Colman look like an A-lister clash. • 29 August Young Mothers
  An amazing return to form for the Belgian veteran masters of classic
  social-realism the Dardenne brothers. The movie follows the lives of teen
  mothers and mothers-to-be at a state home – gentleness, compassion and love
  are the keynotes of this quietly outstanding movie. The straightforward
  assertion of hope through giving and asking for help is powerful. • 29 August
  Little Trouble Girls This elegant and mysterious debut picture from Slovenian
  director Urška Djukić reinvents the cliched idea of a Catholic girl’s sexual
  awakening: an all-girl teenage choir is under the thumb of a demanding and
  charismatic choirmaster, who isn’t above humiliating girls if they displease
  him in any way. • 29 August Spinal Tap II: The End Continues Before there was
  Ricky Gervais, before there was Steve Carell … there was the rock colossus
  Spinal Tap, whose 1980s comeback tour was famously the subject of a
  documentary, or … if you will … well, you know how it goes. Now a sequel
  reunites us with the band, in their mature and reflective silver years, still
  rocking hard and finding that sex-positivity has brought them back into
  fashion. What’s wrong with being sexy? • 12 September A Big Bold Beautiful
  Journey The Korean auteur with the nom de cinéma Kogonada (his actual name is
  as closely guarded as Elena Ferrante’s in the literary world) takes a big
  swing with this romantic drama about two strangers – played by Margot Robbie
  and Colin Farrell – who unite after an extraordinary journey. In the hands of
  anyone else it could be slushy, but Kogonada has a light and expert touch. •
  19 September One Battle After Another For movie-hipsters and superfans this is
  the big one. Director Paul Thomas Anderson returns with a movie inspired by
  Thomas Pynchon’s 1990 novel Vineland, another black comic riff on the war on
  drugs, the war on terror, the paranoid style of American politics and much
  else. Leonardo DiCaprio and Sean Penn star as two ex-revolutionaries trying to
  save the former’s daughter, played by Chase Infiniti. • 26 September Him A
  drama on classic underdog sports movie lines: Tyriq Withers plays Cameron, a
  promising but callow young American football player who gets the chance to
  train with the charismatic quarterback Isaiah White – a serious role for
  comedy veteran Marlon Wayans – and the experience is unnerving. Jordan Peele
  produces. • 3 October The Smashing Machine One of the Safdie brothers – Benny
  – goes solo directing this true-life sports movie, inspired by the 2002 HBO
  documentary of the same title, starring Dwayne Johnson as the humungous MMA
  fighter Mark Kerr and Emily Blunt as his wife, Dawn. The action will surely
  show that the hero is more than just a machine. • 3 October Urchin British
  actor Harris Dickinson makes a really impressive directorial debut with
  Urchin, a smart and compassionate picture about homelessness: engaging,
  humorous and sympathetically acted by Frank Dillane as Mike, a guy who has
  been on the streets for five years. Intelligent and heartbreakingly
  vulnerable. • 3 October Roofman Jeffrey Manchester was a former US army
  reserve soldier who became a pop-culture antihero in the 1990s for robbing
  branches of McDonald’s by breaking in through the roof – for which he was
  dubbed the “roofman” – and then waiting in the lavatories for opening time, at
  which point he would storm out and empty the cash registers. Channing Tatum
  plays Jeffrey and Derek Cianfrance directs. • 17 October Good Fortune In this
  trading-places comedy, Keanu Reeves brings his imitable unreadable deadpan
  style to the role of Gabriel, a “budget” angel who intervenes in the lives of
  lesser humans with mixed results. Writer-director Aziz Ansari stars as a
  stressed gig worker Arj, insecurely employed by Seth Rogen’s heartless
  plutocrat. Gabriel swaps their existences to show Arj that money isn’t
  everything. Or, actually, is it? • 17 October After the Hunt A #MeToo story of
  American academe from screenwriter Nora Garrett and director Luca Guadagnino.
  Julia Roberts stars as an Ivy League professor Alma Olsson who is put under
  pressure when her friend and colleague, played by Andrew Garfield, is accused
  of sexual assault. Ayo Edebiri plays Alma’s star pupil Maggie. • 22 October A
  House of Dynamite A big, brassy, real-time apocalypse scenario from action
  specialist Kathryn Bigelow, whose title may remind you of Sam Goldwyn’s
  apocryphal remark in 1945: “This atom bomb … it’s dynamite!” Idris Elba and
  Rebecca Ferguson star in a white-knuckle drama set in the White House as
  officials deal with what appears to be an incoming nuclear missile attack. •
  24 October Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere Playing a living icon is
  always tricky, and rock icon trickier still. Jeremy Allen White brings the
  blue-collar energy to take on the role of Bruce Springsteen, as he made his
  1982 album Nebraska. Stephen Graham plays Bruce’s father, Douglas, and Jeremy
  Strong is Springsteen’s manager and producer Jon Landau. • 24 October The
  Mastermind Possibly the most downbeat – and yet intriguing and hilarious –
  heist movie in history. Josh O’Connor stars as James, the art school dropout
  in 1960s Massachusetts who conceives a plan to rob the local art gallery with
  the help of tough guys that he has bizarrely recruited. Director Kelly
  Reichardt makes of him a rather Updikean figure who ends up on the run from
  the consequences of his own actions. • 24 October Bugonia The Onion joked that
  Greek auteur Yorgos Lanthimos now estimates he’s only three films away from
  hanging with Emma Stone outside work. His latest film brings him nearer to
  that goal. It’s a remake of the South Korean sci-fi comedy Save the Green
  Planet! in which Stone stars as the CEO of a drugs company who is kidnapped by
  two men who believe that she is a hostile alien. • 31 October The Running Man
  A dystopian thriller-satire on the classic theme of TV being evil, directed by
  Edgar Wright and based on the 1982 novel by Stephen King – last filmed in 1987
  with Arnold Schwarzenegger in the lead. Now the star is slightly less jacked:
  Glen Powell is Ben, a guy who takes part in a TV reality show in which he is
  chased across the world by guys out to kill him – and there’s a big cash prize
  if he can survive 30 days. • 7 November The Thing With Feathers A drama about
  grief, taken from the novella by Max Porter whose title modifies the Emily
  Dickinson quotation about hope. Benedict Cumberbatch plays a guy who, along
  with his two sons, has to deal with the terrible loss of his wife and their
  mother. Grief appears in the guise of a Ted Hughes-style crow. • 7 November
  The Choral An original screenplay by Alan Bennett has to be something to
  savour. Nicholas Hytner directs and Ralph Fiennes stars in the second notable
  choirmaster film of 2025: he is Dr Guthrie – who, in a small Yorkshire town in
  1916, where most of the menfolk are absent, has to recruit a choir of young
  boys and girls to sing Elgar’s The Dream of Gerontius. Their innocence and the
  beauty of the music make a fierce contrast to the war’s horror. • 7 November
  Train Dreams Based on the novella by Denis Johnson and directed by Clint
  Bentley (who recently made the much-loved Sing Sing), this is a drama about
  fragile masculinity. Joel Edgerton plays Robert, a railway worker whose life
  is secluded, vulnerable and lonely, as he spends so much time away from his
  wife but is poignantly aware of the beauty of the American landscape in which
  he finds himself. • 7 November Keeper Actor and film-maker Osgood Perkins had
  a breakthrough last year with his strange horror thriller Longlegs and now he
  returns with another scary movie. Tatiana Maslany and Rossif Sutherland play
  Liz and Malcolm, a couple who escape for a cosy romantic getaway at … uh, oh …
  a secluded cabin. When Malcolm has to return briefly to the city to sort out
  some business, Liz finds herself alone with a terrible evil. • 14 November
  Nuremberg It is the beefy, lairy role that Russell Crowe was surely born to
  play. He is the Nazis’ Luftwaffe commander Hermann Göring in this tense
  postwar psychological drama, and Rami Malek plays Douglas Kelley, the US army
  psychiatrist tasked with examining and questioning Göring to see if he was fit
  to stand trial at Nuremberg. An unsettling battle of wits ensues. • 14
  November Jay Kelly George Clooney is a Hollywood legend with old-school class
  who commands a lot of affection – and who could also use a hit. Perhaps this
  will be the one. The director and co-writer is Noah Baumbach, working with
  Emily Mortimer, and Clooney plays a superhandsome movie megastar of a certain
  age, with Adam Sandler as his agent, as they make a somewhat Fellini-esque
  journey across Europe surrounded by a carnival of fans. • 14 November Die, My
  Love Lynne Ramsay brings the gothic-realist steam heat to this ferocious and
  blazingly visual study of a woman, played by Jennifer Lawrence with the
  passionate commitment reminiscent of Gena Rowlands, and her descent into
  bipolar disorder as she is left alone all day with a new baby in a rambling
  Montana house. Robert Pattinson plays her husband and Sissy Spacek is her
  stressed mother-in-law. • 14 November Blue Moon Some fascinating casting here
  as Ethan Hawke plays the great lyricist Lorenz Hart, struggling with
  depression and alcoholism in 1943 (an era when these disorders were
  heartlessly described as being a maudlin drunk) and we see poor Hart at the
  opening night of Oklahoma!, which his former partner Richard Rodgers has
  written with a new collaborator: Oscar Hammerstein. He stumbles out early and
  we see him in the bar trying and failing to come to terms with what this
  obvious hit says about his own future. • 14 November Wicked: For Good The
  public and the pundits gave a thumbs up to the first part of this mighty
  screen adaptation of the stage musical Wicked (imagining the origin story of
  the Wicked Witch from The Wizard of Oz) and now in this second part we are
  reunited with Cynthia Erivo’s Elphaba and Ariana Grande’s Glinda – and also
  Jonathan Bailey’s hilarious Prince Fiyero. • 21 November Pillion It’s high
  time author Adam Mars-Jones had a presence in British cinema and here is an
  uproarious and tender adaptation of his novella Box Hill, a queer BDSM tale of
  biker romance and devotion with something of Alan Bennett, Tom of Finland and
  Wallace and Gromit. Alexander Skarsgård is the leather-clad alpha male Ray who
  likes the submissive style of Harry Melling’s sweet-natured Colin, and their
  relationship takes an unusual course. • 28 November Avatar: Fire and Ash James
  Cameron’s Avatar movies are sometimes set to be gigantically successful while
  leaving no trace in the collective memory. If this new one is going to do the
  same thing, it’s going to take its time about it – this weighs in at three
  hours and 12 minutes. Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldaña return as Jake and
  Neytiri, who must struggle for survival in a changing world. • 19 December
  Marty Supreme Here is the solo film from the other Safdie brother – Josh – and
  it’s another real-life sports movie, set in 1950s New York and starring
  Timothée Chalamet as the US ping pong champ Martin “Marty” Reisman, known as
  the Needle for his slight, feathery build. Safdie has tempted Gwyneth Paltrow
  away from her semi-retirement to play Marty’s love interest. • 26 December
