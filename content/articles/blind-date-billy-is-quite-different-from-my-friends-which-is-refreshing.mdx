  Billy on Phoebe What were you hoping for? To meet someone different who I may
  never have met through friends or apps. First impressions? Phoebe was
  immediately very welcoming and easy to talk to. What did you talk about?
  Travelling, studying, living at home in adulthood, and surviving our previous
  jobs in the public sector. We also found out we grew up close to each other,
  and she has been working for the university where I did my PhD – small world.
  Most awkward moment? Probably asking for the bill. We didn’t want to look like
  dine and dashers. Good table manners? Faultless. She was much more on top of
  keeping our waters filled, which felt a bit ungentlemanly on my part. Best
  thing about Phoebe? She is so down-to-earth and easy to chat with. Would you
  introduce Phoebe to your friends? I’d be happy to. But I think I’d be doing so
  as a friend (spoiler alert). Describe Phoebe in three words Warm, cultured,
  adventurous. What do you think Phoebe made of you? I think we got on well, so
  I hope she found me good company. Did you go on somewhere? Just a quick wander
  back to the station. And … did you kiss? We didn’t, just a hug by the
  barriers. I don’t think either of us were feeling that sort of vibe from the
  evening. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? I
  would’ve ordered some of the non-alcoholic wine Phoebe was drinking; it looked
  intriguing. Marks out of 10? 7.5. I had a great time, but I don’t think there
  was any romantic spark. Would you meet again? I don’t think another date is on
  the cards, but I’d be up for a catchup at some point. Phoebe on Billy What
  were you hoping for? A south London accent. First impressions? South London,
  no accent. What did you talk about? Feeling 16 again, karaoke, hope for a new
  left wing, favourite books. I also learned that budgies can argue like
  siblings – Billy has two: Egg and Yolky. Most awkward moment? My lateness …
  very unlike me. Good table manners? I was glad he was up for trying the golden
  beetroot. Best thing about Billy? His contentment – something I often lack.
  Would you introduce Billy to your friends? Billy is quite different from my
  friends, which was refreshing, but I’m not sure they have much in common.
  Describe Billy in three words Sweet, optimistic, and genuine. What do you
  think Billy made of you? Maybe a bit chaotic, and more spontaneous than I
  really am. (I’m not sure anyone is ever their true self on a first date.) Did
  you go on somewhere? No. And … did you kiss? We did not. If you could change
  one thing about the evening, what would it be? I wish we had sat outside.
  Marks out of 10? Overall, 7.5. I hadn’t expected to have such a nice evening
  with a total stranger. Would you meet again? No, I think we are looking for
  different things – and maybe different people. Phoebe and Billy ate at
  Brunswick House, London SW8. Fancy a blind date? Email
