  Sheer joy. That’s how it felt watching England’s Lionesses romping gleefully
  across the pitch after their victory in Basel – not just because they won but
  because of the way they did it, with an exuberance and a resilience and an
  obvious love of playing together that makes them irresistible to watch. That
  65,000 people came out in the drizzle for their homecoming parade down the
  Mall was testament not just to the deserved new popularity of women’s football
  but also to the longing for a national event that, even if only briefly, made
  us feel cheerful, expansive, as if all things were possible. So it’s
  interesting that for her summer beach reading Rachel Reeves picked Abundance,
  the American journalists Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson’s blueprint for the
  more permanent rebuilding of hope and joy. It’s a pro-growth, techno-optimist
  rallying cry for progressives to reinvent themselves as purveyors of plenty
  and good times in contrast to the right’s crabby, mean-spirited “scarcity
  mindset” – which revolves around the belief that there isn’t enough good stuff
  to go round and therefore the priority is snatching it back off immigrants or
  the poor or whatever bewildered former ally Donald Trump accuses of ripping
  America off. Klein and Thompson argue convincingly that for decades western
  consumers have been fobbed off with an abundance of stuff we fleetingly want –
  fast fashion, cheap flights, more streamed content than anyone has time to
  watch – but a paucity of stuff we actually need, such as affordable homes near
  where the good jobs are, or cheap green energy. Where the authors will divide
  the room, however, is by claiming that’s partly down to years of liberal
  politicians attaching well-meaning strings to public building projects, from
  environmental protections to procurement rules to US zoning laws for housing,
  which although noble in intent collectively make it impossible to build. It
  was Reeves’s jolting recent description of red tape as a “boot on the neck” of
  business that first made me wonder if she’d read the fervently deregulatory
  Abundance. Though it focuses on the California housing crisis, there are
  enough relatable stories – the nimby neighbours fighting affordable homes
  because they’d prefer more car parking, or the decades wasted failing to build
  a high-speed rail link between Los Angeles and San Francisco – for it to have
  done the rounds at Westminster and among Australian progressives too. Like all
  snappy bestsellers, it’s sometimes glib. Klein and Thompson talk a great game
  about facing up to reality – if you can’t have speedy housebuilding and
  generous protection for bat and newt habitats, say, which do you want most? –
  yet place enormous faith in the magical ability of still-unproven technologies
  to solve problems without creating new ones. Their vision of a utopia
  involving driverless cars, lab-grown meat and bounteous vegetable crops from
  so-called vertical farms (essentially giant greenhouses powered by renewable
  energy) would sound more convincing if it weren’t for horror stories about
  autonomous driving or the struggle to make vertical farming remotely viable in
  Britain. But there’s something undeniably appealing at its heart. Plenty is an
  innately American idea, at home in the land of bottomless refills and vast
  open skies and permanently reaching after more, bigger, better. But from a
  British left perspective, what’s interesting is its relationship with
  altruism. Scarcity makes people selfish, anxious, distrusting of others and
  prone to hoarding whatever they’ve got: think of shoppers fighting over loo
  rolls in lockdown. But in times of abundance, we relax, becoming more
  generous. Klein and Thompson’s proposals for a 21st-century era of plenty –
  build lots of affordable housing and prioritise super-cheap clean energy to
  lower household bills and unleash industrial innovation – aren’t exactly
  revelatory to a Labour government already committed to most of this (though in
  Britain some might add the need to reform an electricity market where prices
  are still artificially pegged to gas). What Labour hasn’t yet nailed, however,
  is the emotional framing that turns rather worthy but dull-sounding
  infrastructure projects into the genuinely exciting makings of a better life.
  Somewhere in abundance theory are the glimmerings of a story that brings
  together otherwise disparate policies and people. What Ed Miliband and Angela
  Rayner, the two natural abundance politicians on the cabinet’s soft left,
  share with those on the technocratic right like chief AI cheerleader Peter
  Kyle, is mostly a mindset: an ebullience, an enthusiasm, and a refusal to see
  everything as hopeless that matters to progressive parties, because they’re in
  the business of hope. Never more so, arguably, than when the right is deep in
  the business of doom. Nigel Farage’s great appeal to his followers used to be
  the fact that he liked a drink and a laugh; that he was so obviously enjoying
  himself. But lately his party has begun to sound bitter, nihilistic, oddly
  hysterical. Claiming that Britain is on the verge of societal collapse plays
  well on X, already awash with nonsense about no-go zones in Birmingham and
  civil war in Europe, but perhaps less well in daylight. Britain has big
  problems, many of them deep seated. But it’s still a country where people wash
  their cars in suburban driveways on a Sunday afternoon, not a post-apocalyptic
  wasteland where we’re all one step away from barbecuing rats for supper.
  There’s undeniably a market for politicians wallowing angrily in dreams of a
  better yesterday. But I suspect there’s still a bigger one, out there in the
  rain, waiting to catch sight of a better tomorrow. Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian
