  London-based Nothing’s latest gadget is a set of over-ear headphones that
  throws out the dull design norms of noise-cancelling cans for an
  attention-attracting look that is a cross between a 1980s Walkman and Doctor
  Who’s Cybermen. The large, semi-transparent cans are certainly a statement
  piece on your head, with an outer design covered in details, dot-matrix print
  and physical buttons, but sadly stopping short of the flashing LEDs of the
  company’s phones. The unconventional design has a rather more conventional
  price, costing £299 and landing the Headphone 1 in competition with the very
  best noise-cancelling headphones from Bose, Sony, Sennheiser and myriad
  others. The eye-catching transparent plastic ovals protrude from smooth
  aluminium squircles to form the ear cups, which are attached to the headband
  by black steel arms that rotate and tilt to adjust the fit. The headphones are
  relatively heavy at 329g, but have a well-judged clamping force that keeps
  them secure on your head without too much pressure. The ear cushions are slim
  and quite comfortable, if a bit sweaty on warmer days. But the padding on the
  headband is a little too thin and can create a sore spot on your head after a
  few hours of listening. The right ear cup has five buttons and two ports
  dotted around it. The power switch, USB-C and headphones ports are in the
  bottom edge, with a dedicated Bluetooth pairing button hidden on the inside
  edge. A rolling button controls volume and presses in for play and pause or to
  switch noise-cancelling modes. Below the roller is a paddle that rocks left
  and right to skip track, fast-forward or rewind. A final button on the outside
  of the ear cup activates the phone’s voice assistant, but can be customised to
  other functions such as controlling noise cancelling. It is really nice to
  have multiple tactile buttons compared with the various touch or single-button
  controls plaguing most headphones. The battery lasts 30 to 35 hours with noise
  cancelling, or up to 80 hours with it off, which is in line with the
  competition and long enough for a week of commuting or any flight. A full
  charge takes two hours. The headphones support Bluetooth 5.3 and can connect
  to two devices simultaneously. They also have a standard 3.5mm headphones
  socket and can play audio over USB-C, which is handy for wired listening with
  a phone. Specifications Weight: 329g Dimensions: 189.3 x 173.9 x 78mm Drivers:
  40mm Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.3 with multipoint, 3.5mm, USB-C charging and
  audio Bluetooth codecs: SBC, AAC, LDAC Rated battery life: 35 hours ANC on
  Sound by KEF, noise cancelling by Nothing Nothing partnered with the storied
  British speaker maker KEF for the audio tuning of the Headphone 1, resulting
  in some great-sounding headphones. They have a fairly bassy profile, with
  plenty of punch in the low end without drowning out the mids and high tones.
  They produce a relatively wide soundstage with solid detail and separation of
  tones. But they sound best with noise cancelling turned off. Switch it on and
  they sound narrower and a bit muted in some more complex tracks, lacking a bit
  of punch here and there. They won’t trouble the very best in the market for
  high-end nuance but they sound good for general listening across a range of
  genres. The noise cancelling is similar: reasonably effective but some way
  behind the best in class. It can handle rumbles and other lower end tones
  reasonably well. But it really struggles with higher tones such as voices,
  which are clearly audible even with noise cancelling set to maximum, making
  them a poor choice for trying to focus in an office or cafe. The transparency
  mode sounds clear and natural but is a bit too loud, increasing the volume of
  world around you unnecessarily. It is great for awareness, but can overwhelm
  the music. Call quality is good, coming through nice and clear in quiet or
  noisy street environments. The excellent Nothing X app on Android or iPhone
  handles settings, updates and has a full equaliser. It can be used to turn on
  some good spatial audio with or without head tracking to add a bit of space
  and realism for movies. Sustainability The headphones are generally repairable
  with replacement ear cushions available from customer service, but they are
  not made with any recycled materials. Price The Nothing Headphone 1 cost £299
  (€299/$299/A$549) and come in white or black. For comparison, the Sony
  WH-1000XM6 cost £399, the Bose QuietComfort Ultra cost £350, the Sonos Ace
  cost £399, the Beats Studio Pro cost £350, the Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless
  cost £199 and the Fairbuds XL cost £219. Verdict The Nothing Headphones 1
  stand out above the very samey-looking crowd of noise-cancelling headphones.
  But that overt design draws more attention on the street than I would like,
  particularly in white as tested. They do sound pretty good, but their
  noise-cancelling performance falls short of rivals’ at this price. As does the
  comfort with the headband lacking enough padding for really long listening
  sessions. Solid battery life, great connectivity and a quality app make the
  headphones easy to live with. It is nice to have multiple physical buttons for
  the playback and other controls too. At £300 or equivalent you can easily get
  a better combination of sound, noise cancelling and comfort from leading
  rivals. That means, even more so than with the company’s phones, you have to
  really want something to make you look different to choose these headphones.
  Pros: standout design, great button controls, good sound, noise cancelling,
  good app for Android and iPhone, good spatial audio, 3.5mm and USB-C audio,
  Bluetooth multipoint, decent case. Cons: headband padding a bit thin,
  relatively heavy, do not fold up for travel, average noise cancelling, attract
  quite a lot of attention, expensive.
