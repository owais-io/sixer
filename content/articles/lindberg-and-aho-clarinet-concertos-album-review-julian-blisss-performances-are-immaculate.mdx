  Lindberg & Aho: Clarinet Concertos album review – Julian Bliss’s performances
  are immaculate

  Composed just a few years apart, these impressive Finnish clarinet concertos
  were inspired by the playing of two of the finest clarinettists of our time,
  both Nordic. Magnus Lindberg’s concerto was composed in 2002 for his friend
  Kari Kriikku, while Kalevi Aho’s work was commissioned for the Swedish player
  Martin Fröst, who gave the first performance in London in 2006. In some
  respects, the two pieces are strikingly similar; both are cast in five
  movements, and both make enormous demands on the soloist, which include
  multiphonics, passage-work that requires fearsomely accurate articulation, and
  sustained passages in the highest, most treacherous register of their
  instruments. Both works are wonderfully approachable, though Aho’s work is the
  less adventurous, his orchestral writing more motoric, his gestures more
  rhetorical and fundamentally tonal than Lindberg’s, in which references to
  earlier clarinet solos, from Debussy to Gershwin, are cunningly secreted.
  Julian Bliss’s performances of both works, with Taavi Oramo (a clarinettist
  himself) conducting the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, are absolutely
  immaculate. It’s clear from the opening moments of the Lindberg concerto that
  the most extreme technical demands hold no terrors for him, and he matches
  that virtuosity with a velvety smooth tone in the lyrical passages in both
  works. Perhaps Kriikku’s recording of the Lindberg has a shade more intensity
  than Bliss’s, but it’s a close-run thing. Stream it on Apple Music (above) or
  on Spotify
