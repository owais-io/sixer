  In the week before her murder, Fernanda Soledad Yramain lay awake at night
  listening as a motorbike circled the house where she was hiding. “She kept
  saying ‘it’s him’,” remembers Daniella Viscarra, Soledad’s sister-in-law with
  whom she had sought refuge in the Tucumán countryside. “She was scared all of
  the time.” A month earlier, in September 2024, 29-year-old Soledad had ended a
  relationship with her boyfriend, Francisco Timoteo Saldaño. They had been
  together since she was 14 and he was 35, and shared three children. In the
  final year of their relationship, Saldaño had turned violent. “She started
  coming round with bruises on her arms, crying. He held a knife to her throat
  and said he would kill her,” says Sandra Yramain, Soledad’s aunt. Together,
  Sandra and Soledad went to the police station to request protection. “They
  said that ‘these things take time’,” Sandra says. “But nobody ever called.”
  Over the ensuing week, Soledad returned to the police station three more
  times. “She was certain he would kill her,” says Daniella. “So she kept
  trying.” Less than a day after her fourth – and final – visit to beg the
  police to protect her, Saldaño stabbed Soledad to death with a butcher’s
  knife, before killing himself. “Soledad did everything she was meant to do,”
  says Sandra. “But, because the police did not care, she was cut in half.”
  While Argentina was once celebrated as a bastion for women’s rights in Latin
  America, now, amid a rise in populism under far-right leader Javier Milei,
  protections for women are quickly being eroded. Women’s rights groups warn
  that more women like Soledad could die as a result. Soon after taking power in
  December 2023, Milei dissolved the undersecretariat for protection against
  gender violence and closed the ministry of women. “For the first time in
  nearly 40 years, Argentina has no dedicated institution to prevent, punish and
  eradicate gender-based violence,” says Mariela Belski, executive director of
  Amnesty International Argentina. The administration has also slashed funding
  for programmes aimed at combating gender violence. The Acompañar programme,
  which provided financial and psychological assistance for victims of
  gender-based violence, has been drastically defunded, while the 144 emergency
  hotline lost 42% of its staff by July 2024. “The government is turning its
  back on women facing violence,” says Belski. In November, Argentina was the
  only country to vote against a UN general assembly resolution to prevent and
  eliminate violence against women and girls. Two months later, Milei’s
  administration went further, pledging to strike the aggravating factor of
  femicide, defined as when a woman dies at the hands of a man on the basis of
  her gender, from the penal code – a move that drew swift condemnation from
  human rights groups. Belski says removing the legal definition would “weaken
  the state’s ability to prevent and punish such crimes”. Now, human rights
  experts warn that Milei’s rhetoric is gaining traction nationwide. In Tucumán,
  a conservative province, lawyers and advocates say that legal protections for
  women are already being dismantled. “Tucumán is one of the places where the
  situation is worsening,” says Myriam Bregman, a socialist leader. “It follows
  the political line of the national government, of cutting women’s rights
  protection programmes, which were already very scarce.” Soledad Deza, the
  Tucumán lawyer supporting Yramain’s family and the president of Fundación
  Mujeres Por Mujeres (Women for Women Foundation), shared data showing a sharp
  drop in court-issued protection orders since Milei took office. Between
  January and September 2024, according to information obtained from the
  authorities by Deza and shared with the Guardian, family courts in Tucumán
  issued 4,856 protection orders, while criminal courts issued 754. By
  comparison, across the whole of 2023, those figures were 7,549 and 2,448
  respectively. Deza says that women in the province have struggled to access
  support because of funding cuts, and that the justice system is failing to
  investigate their reports. Law enforcement agencies have also been slow to
  respond, says Sofia Quiroga, of international women’s rights organisation
  Equality Now. “Worryingly, the police in Tucumán have stopped investigating
  why protection orders are needed in the first place,” she says. Luciana Belén
  Gramaglio, a feminist lawyer from Tucumán, says that the provincial government
  had embraced, “the regressive and stifling policies promoted by Milei”. At the
  start of 2025, she says, the Tucumán government reduced the number of
  prosecutorial offices dedicated to investigating cases of gender-based
  violence and sexual abuse from seven to four. Gramaglio suggests almost half
  of the cases that enter the judicial system are linked to violence against
  women. “How then, is the reduction in prosecutorial offices justified?” The
  weekend that Soledad was killed, two other women in the Tucumán province were
  murdered; both cases officially classified as femicides. Official data from
  the National Ombudsman’s office found that 295 cases of femicide were reported
  nationally between 1 January and 31 December 2024, or one every 30 hours. The
  MuMaLá women’s organisation reported a 15% increase in femicides in the first
  four months of 2025, compared with the same period a year earlier. Lawyers and
  advocates also warn of a growing narrative that women are fabricating claims
  of gender-based violence. In 2024, senator Carolina Losada, with the support
  of national justice minister Mariano Cúneo Libarona, introduced a bill to
  increase penalties for false accusations of gender-based violence. “The
  credibility of the victims is being challenged by the narratives of the Milei
  administration. These narratives have unlocked a whole spectrum of hatred and
  obstacles,” says Deza. “This is simply an indirect threat, to discourage women
  from reporting crimes.” Mariela Labozzetta, head of the specialised
  prosecutorial unit on violence against women, says that despite funding cuts,
  the justice system and the public prosecutor’s offices across Argentina
  continue to function. But, she adds that “to prevent the risks faced by
  victims from worsening, support programmes are necessary, and these have been
  eliminated”. Deza says that because Argentina “has stripped away gender
  violence prevention programmes” women are left with little recourse but to
  remain “hypervigilant”. She has filed a complaint against the police in
  Tucumán regarding Soledad’s case, and hopes that the criminal justice system
  investigates why her calls for help went unanswered. The Tucumán state and
  police did not reply to requests for comment, nor did the Milei
  administration. For Soledad’s family, the government’s proposal to eliminate
  femicide from the penal code came as a fresh shock. “I only hope that her
  death was not in vain,” says Sandra. “And that no other woman is killed
  because the authorities didn’t take control.”
