  Charlie Woods carded his second recorded hole-in-one after firing an ace on
  Sunday during the third and final round of the Junior Players Championship at
  Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. Starting the round on the back nine, Woods was
  even-par through 11 holes on Sunday before he covered the par-three third with
  one shot from 177 yards out at TPC Sawgrass. Woods’s first ace came while he
  played with his famous father, Tiger, at the 2024 PNC Championship last
  December. The 16-year-old made that shot with a 7-iron to on the par-three,
  176-yard fourth hole at the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club. Charlie is slowly catching
  up with his father, who has 10 recorded holes-in-one. The Junior Players is
  one of the most prestigious junior tournaments in the US. Charlie has had a
  strong season so far, he qualified for the US Junior Amateur in July and
  finished tied for ninth at this month’s Junior PGA, although that result meant
  he missed qualifying for the Junior Ryder Cup.
