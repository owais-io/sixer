webTitle: TNT Sports secures live rights to England’s Ashes series in Australia

  England’s attempt to regain the Ashes this winter will be broadcast live in
  the UK by TNT Sports. After agreeing a one-year deal with Cricket Australia
  over the weekend TNT now has the rights for all of England’s winter tours, as
  the broadcaster had deals in place to cover both white-ball series in New
  Zealand and Sri Lanka either side of the Ashes. TNT’s predecessor, BT Sport,
  bought the rights for the past two Ashes tours so the new deal may be
  inauspicious for Ben Stokes’s side as their viewers have not seen England win
  a single game. England have lost 13 of the past 15 Tests they have played in
  Australia, which shows the size of the task for the touring side this winter.
  TNT has increasingly become the home of England’s winter cricket deals in
  recent years and has long-term rights in place with New Zealand, West Indies
  and Pakistan, as well as securing a late deal to cover England’s five-Test
  series in India last winter. Unlike that tour, in which the former England
  players Alastair Cook and Steven Finn provided commentary from a studio in the
  Netherlands, TNT is planning to send a team to Australia, although it will
  also use coverage from the host broadcaster. TNT’s dominance follows a
  decision from Sky Sports to pull back from winter tours due to cost-cutting
  and its focus on covering Premier League football – it will broadcast 215
  matches live this season. Sky still has the rights to International Cricket
  Council events, such as the men’s and women’s World Cup and T20 World Cup, but
  its only contract for bilateral series is with Cricket South Africa. TNT’s new
  Cricket Australia deal also includes men’s white-ball series against South
  Africa and India, and a multiformat women’s series against India. Todd
  Greenberg, the Cricket Australia chief executive, said: “We’re pleased to
  extend our longstanding partnership with TNT Sports and that they will again
  be instrumental in showcasing the Australian summer of cricket to UK
  audiences.” England will be hoping to win the Ashes for the first time since
  Cook’s side defeated Australia 3-2 at home in 2015. The tourists have not won
  a Test in Australia since Andrew Strauss’s side triumphed in Sydney in January
  2011, which sealed a 3-1 series win, their first down under since 1987. • This
  article was amended on 5 August 2025. The caption in a previous version said
  that Joe Root was England’s Test captain in 2015. It was in fact Alastair
  Cook.
