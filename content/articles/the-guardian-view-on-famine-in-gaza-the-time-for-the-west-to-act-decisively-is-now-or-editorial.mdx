  The symbolism of Palestinian statehood matters. For months, the Israeli prime
  minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his far-right coalition allies have cruelly
  laboured to make Gaza an uninhabitable hellscape. In the West Bank, the
  relentless expansion of Israeli settlements is likewise intended to foreclose,
  for ever, the possibility of a viable, independent Palestinian state. Mr
  Netanyahu’s approach to calls for a two-state solution in the Middle East has
  been to systematically work to ensure it never happens. Sir Keir Starmer has
  thus sent a welcome signal by declaring that, in the absence of a ceasefire
  and a revived peace process, Britain will move to formally recognise
  Palestine. Against a backdrop of images of starvation in Gaza that recall the
  20th-century horror of Biafra or Ethiopia, Sir Keir’s intervention (and that
  of the French president, Emmanuel Macron) gestures to the necessity of
  creating a different future to the one envisioned by Israel’s extremist
  government. But the urgent imperative is not to build a state; it is to save a
  population on the brink of social and physical collapse. On Tuesday, the
  United Nations food security agency confirmed that “the worst-case scenario of
  famine is unfolding in the Gaza Strip”. The four Gaza Humanitarian Foundation
  distribution sites, touted by Israel as an alternative to blocked UN aid, are
  both hideously inadequate and lethally dangerous to access. Close to 100,000
  women and children are in urgent need of treatment for malnutrition, while one
  in three Palestinians in Gaza are going for days without eating. Seeking to
  massage international opinion, Israel has resumed its past tactic of
  introducing partial mitigations and temporarily easing barriers to the
  delivery of aid. But in a ravaged landscape, where social cohesion and order
  has broken down, Gaza’s starvation crisis is much too advanced to be resolved
  by “humanitarian pauses” to the military onslaught. Similarly, airdropping aid
  may salve the consciences of western countries, but it will provide minimal
  food and has proved dangerous as well as inefficient in the past. The
  existential reality is plain. Unless Israel agrees to end the war, and stands
  back to allow a vast and sustained injection of UN aid, thousands of
  Palestinians will die either directly or indirectly as a result of a
  human-made famine. The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine (Unrwa),
  scandalously banned from operating on spurious grounds by Israel, has the
  equivalent of 6,000 trucks of food and medicine ready to cross into Gaza.
  Along with other aid organisations, it must be empowered to use its experience
  and expertise to bring the territory back from the brink. Diplomatic gestures
  towards Palestinian statehood will do little to force that outcome, as Mr
  Netanyahu’s dismissive response to Sir Keir’s declaration swiftly underlined.
  Sanctions might, though, by potentially ratcheting up pressure on Mr Netanyahu
  as more tangible effects of Israel’s moral isolation hit home. The European
  Union, which is Israel’s largest export destination, has cards to play.
  Britain could move to pause preferential trade access, and expand current
  restrictions on arms sales. As Israel’s response to the horrific massacre of 7
  October 2023 has become shockingly disproportionate, its allies in the west
  have done far too little to influence the course of events. This week, in
  Europe at least, the mood has begun to shift. But if Gaza is to be saved,
  decisive action is required.
