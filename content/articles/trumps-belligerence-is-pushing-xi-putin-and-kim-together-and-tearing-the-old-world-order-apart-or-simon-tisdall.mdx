  Donald Trump’s first reaction to the disconcerting spectacle of China’s Xi
  Jinping, Russia’s Vladimir Putin and North Korea’s Kim Jong-un marching
  side-by-side at a huge military parade in Beijing was, predictably, all about
  him. This show of solidarity and strength, he complained, was nothing less
  than an attempt to “conspire” against the United States. Trump likes military
  parades – his own, that is. Even more, he likes to be on the podium, at the
  centre of attention. He casts himself as world number one. The images coming
  out of the Chinese capital this week challenged him on all three counts. This
  puncturing of Trump’s insecure ego, and the striking feebleness of his
  response, will greatly gratify Xi. Trump’s behaviour towards China since
  taking office in January has been aggressive, vindictive and patronising by
  turns. His punitive trade tariffs, in particular, have caused unprecedented
  disruption. Though the worst of the levies are paused until November, they
  help explain Xi’s repeated insistence China is a proud nation that will not be
  bullied. At the same time, Trump has talked vaguely about offering a
  face-to-face summit, as if bestowing a great gift. Parading the Beijing
  triumvirate was Xi’s pointed riposte. Even by Red Square standards, the
  Chinese president’s ostentatious display of military might was impressive. The
  pageantry, anthems, immaculately synchronised, goose-stepping soldiers, tanks,
  artillery pieces – and even the release of 80,000 bewildered doves – all spoke
  to China’s rapid advance towards global military parity with Washington. Most
  worrying for the US navy patrolling the western Pacific was the unveiling of
  hypersonic, nuclear-capable, long-range missiles and underwater drones. China
  was “unstoppable,” Xi declared. In marking the end of the second world war,
  “humanity is again faced with the choice of peace or war, dialogue or
  confrontation, win-win or zero-sum,” he said. This, too, was an unmistakeable
  warning aimed at Trump. Whether he heeds it is another matter entirely. For
  all the trumpets and bayonets, Xi’s overall purpose in orchestrating this
  grand political and diplomatic, as well as martial, performance was to project
  China’s future global leadership role, as envisioned and shaped by himself.
  This is what Xi has been working towards ever since he rose to the top of the
  Communist party pile in 2012. He has centralised control to a greater degree
  than any leader since Mao Zedong, whose often disastrous leadership he
  reveres. Criticism of Xi’s missteps – and there have been many, over economic
  management, jobs, a property crisis and corruption – has brought ever tighter
  restrictions on corporate, media and personal freedoms. As a surveillance
  state, China is unquestionably world number one. Xi’s foreign policy, notably
  towards Taiwan and across the South China Sea region, is fiercely
  expansionist. By gathering dozens of national leaders, first at last weekend’s
  biggest-ever annual conference of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)
  – a potential Eurasian EU equivalent – and then in Beijing, Xi set down a
  marker whose significance will reverberate far beyond the White House. By
  their presence, the leaders of Turkey, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Iran and
  many other actual or would-be rising powers kowtowed to Chinese power. Even
  India’s leader, Narendra Modi, alienated by Trump’s tariffs, played along,
  minimising longstanding rivalries with China. The SCO’s joint declaration in
  effect endorsed a new, emerging global security and economic order that
  challenges the post-1945 settlement, directed and dominated by Beijing. It was
  the latest, triumphalist assertion of Xi’s vision of China as pre-eminent
  21st-century power. Little wonder Trump was put out. Yet who would seriously
  disagree that it is his foolish, provocative antagonising of friends and foes
  alike with his refurbished, multifaceted brand of neo-imperial US overreach
  that has induced so many countries to throw in their lot with China? That
  said, the assumption that the Beijing alliance, with the Xi-Putin-Kim
  triumvirate at its heart, can hold together long-term, and find constructive,
  nonmilitary ways to cooperate, is highly questionable. Putin needs Xi’s help
  right now with Ukraine, but Russia has a historical, visceral fear of Chinese
  expansionism. North Korea’s Kim – whose regionally destabilising behaviour and
  perpetual impecuniousness worry Beijing – likewise fears Chinese domination.
  Or look it another way: both Putin and Xi are in their 70s. They will not be
  in charge for ever. Their rule is highly personalised. Absent them, in both
  countries, vacuums beckon. The potential for explosions of dissent, currently
  repressed, is massive. Theirs is a three-way partnership of expediency,
  lacking ideological, intellectual or moral underpinning. They are united in
  opposition to American hegemony, to a western-dominated financial system based
  on the dollar, to what they regard as noisome universal standards of human and
  civil rights. They are all antidemocratic authoritarians to their very marrow.
  In other words, like hard-right populist demagogues in the US and Europe, they
  know what they don’t like. Whether they know how to replace that which they
  would destroy, whether they have any viable, credible idea of alternative
  global structures that reaches beyond mere national self-interest and
  political, personal advantage is doubtful. Given the choice, many
  middle-ranking countries might well drift back into the US orbit, if it were
  led by a more rational, less confrontational president. In 1945, when the UN
  and the present world order came into being, a shared determination, primarily
  among western powers, that the catastrophes of two world wars should never be
  repeated, was central to their decision-making, however imperfect. Any similar
  sense of altruism is wholly absent today from the pragmatic, performative
  calculations of the Beijing triumvirate. All of which, it must be said, bodes
  ill for the world. Looking at Xi, Putin and Kim, plus the
  isolationist-nihilist Trump, biblical scholars might be forgiven for recalling
  the four horsemen of the apocalypse: conquest, war, famine and death. No
  prizes for which one is which. Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs
