  Five of England’s European Championship-winning squad have been nominated for
  this year’s women’s Ballon d’Or, including three Arsenal players who claimed a
  club and country double of European titles this summer. Leah Williamson,
  Alessia Russo and Chloe Kelly all shared Champions League and Euros triumphs,
  and are joined on the nominees list by Lucy Bronze and Hannah Hampton, who
  both won domestic trebles with Chelsea and clinched back-to-back European
  titles with victory over Spain in Basel last month. For the men’s Ballon d’Or,
  four English players have been nominated, with Jude Bellingham, Harry Kane,
  Cole Palmer and Declan Rice all on the list alongside Scotland’s Scott
  McTominay, who has been recognised after his widely lauded contribution to
  Napoli’s Serie A triumph. The Arsenal and England full-back Myles Lewis-Skelly
  made the young players’ list. Sarina Wiegman, the Lionesses’ coach, has been
  nominated for the women’s Johan Cruyff Trophy, for the best coach, alongside
  Arsenal’s Renée Slegers and Chelsea’s Sonia Bompastor. Nigeria’s Justine
  Madugu and Brazil’s Arthur Elias have also been nominated after their triumphs
  in their respective continental competitions. The 19-year-old England striker,
  Michelle Agyemang, is nominated for the young player award – the Kopa Trophy.
  Her two late equalisers in the knockout stages of Euro 2025 were instrumental
  in England reaching the final. The Chelsea youngster Wieke Kaptein is also on
  that five-player list. Hampton, who saved two penalties in the Euro 2025
  final, is also nominated for the Yashin Trophy for goalkeepers, along with
  Arsenal’s Daphne van Domselaar. Seven Arsenal players are among the women’s
  Ballon d’Or prize list, after their Champions League final victory over
  Barcelona in Lisbon, with Spain’s Mariona Caldentey, Australia’s Steph Catley,
  the USA’s Emily Fox and Norway’s Frida Maanum joining Williamson, Russo and
  Kelly. Chelsea have two further representatives in Sandy Baltimore and Johanna
  Rytting Kaneryd, while the Scotland and Real Madrid midfielder, Caroline Weir,
  has also made the list, alongside Brazil’s Marta and last year’s winner,
  Aitana Bonmatí of Spain. As expected, the men’s Ballon d’Or list also includes
  big-name nominees such as Kylian Mbappé, Mohamed Salah and Vinícius Júnior,
  along with Manchester City’s Erling Haaland and the new Arsenal signing Viktor
  Gyökeres. Arne Slot and Enzo Maresca are among five nominees for the men’s
  coach prize. Chelsea and Liverpool have both been nominated for men’s club of
  the year, while Arsenal and Chelsea are in the running for the women’s club of
  the year.
