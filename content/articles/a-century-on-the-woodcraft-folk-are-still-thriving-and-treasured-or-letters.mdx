  Phineas Harper’s article reminded me of how much the Woodcraft Folk influenced
  my life (Like Jeremy Corbyn and Sophie Ellis-Bextor, I grew up in Woodcraft
  Folk. Here’s how it changes children’s lives, 16 August). In the early 1950s
  my parents actively sought a socialist children’s organisation. We lived in
  Clapham and the nearest Woodcraft group met in a co-op hall in Balham. The
  group was called Sunrise Elfins and the leader was Ada, the wife of national
  organiser Henry Fair. In 1952, aged six, I went on my first of many summer
  camps. The camp was at Westward Ho! and was hit by a hurricane that was
  reported on the Daily Mirror’s front page. In 1959 I went to Czechoslovakia in
  a 10-strong delegation. One of my lasting memories was visiting Lidice, a
  village razed to the ground in reprisal for the assassination of an SS
  official, Reinhard Heydrich. As a leader, I ran groups and took them to camps
  abroad. On one occasion, there was no female leader available to help me take
  my Venturer group to a camp in Aarhus, Denmark. Esmé Goldberg, the campaigner
  against apartheid, was suggested to me. So I met the South African political
  prisoner Denis Goldberg’s wife and then Denis himself, after he was released.
  In 1984 I met my wife, Jenny Brooks, in the international camp in
  Loughborough. I also participated in CND’s Aldermaston marches with the folk.
  One hundred years of first-class work with young people deserves national
  recognition. Come on, Royal Mail, how about a set of stamps? Come on, Royal
  Mint, how about a coin? Andrew Moncrieff Dronfield, Derbyshire • I was
  delighted to read Phineas Harper’s article. As he says, the Woodcraft Folk was
  founded in south London – Woolwich, to be precise – with the earliest
  activities taking place in Peckham. Most of the work on developing the
  organisation was the work of Joe Reeves, who was the education secretary for
  the Royal Arsenal Cooperative Society – one of the largest retail co-ops; RACS
  covered most of south London and quite a bit of Kent and Surrey. It was also
  highly political, with a background of the earliest known co-ops in what was a
  heavily industrialised area. Reeves’s job with the RACS was what we would
  describe today as a community worker. He went on to be elected as Labour MP
  for Greenwich in the 1945 intake. We have a lot to thank Joe for, both in his
  work with the RACS and then for his later work in parliament. I could go on
  about all of it for hours. Mary Mills London • My wife and I loved reading the
  article on the Woodcraft Folk by Phineas Harper. Woodcraft Folk met at the
  local Methodist church in Birmingham, where I was the minister. Our three sons
  loved Woodcraft. Its leaders, Ted and Olive Palser and their daughter Kate,
  were the salt of the earth. We loved the anti-militaristic stance and it was
  way ahead of its time in terms of its commitment to caring for the
  environment. Best of all were the annual camps. We all took our turn in
  preparing meals. Facilities were basic and the wide games challenging. A
  favourite memory of mine is bivouacking on a deserted beach on Anglesey with
  inner-city children fighting off creepy-crawlies. Although Woodcraft is not a
  religious organisation, the group meeting at the church was one of the most
  caring and supportive of our activities. We have wonderful memories and
  commend it wholeheartedly to youngsters today. Rev Clive R Fowle Nuneaton,
  Warwickshire • Phineas Harper’s very interesting article on the Woodcraft Folk
  celebrates the organisation’s socialist ideals, while taking a couple of
  subtle swipes at the Scouts. But he fails to acknowledge an important point:
  Harold Wilson was a devoted scout. Perhaps he saw a nice little definition of
  socialism in the scout motto: “A scout is a brother to his fellow scouts and a
  friend to all.” While he is not the most celebrated of prime ministers, it is
  worth remembering that his government created the Open University – a powerful
  tool for addressing inequality and lack of opportunity. Anthony Claff Hamburg,
  Germany • Yes there is a militaristic tinge to the Scouts, as Phineas Harper
  hints in his grateful appreciation of the impact his membership of the
  Woodcraft Folk has had on him. However, in spite of certain cringe-making
  activities (saluting the flag, marching to bugles etc, when I joined in the
  late 1940s) my membership of the Scouts has had a similarly profound effect on
  me. The rhyme we learned to help us remember the (then) scout law (Trusty,
  loyal, helpful; brotherly courteous, kind; obedient, smiling, thrifty; clean
  in body and mind) is as useful a guide to good living as any I know (though
  now with reservations about unquestioning obedience). Along with the example
  of my first scoutmaster (as they were then called), Leo Moreland, this has
  been more useful to me than a lifetime’s church sermons. Peter Wrigley
