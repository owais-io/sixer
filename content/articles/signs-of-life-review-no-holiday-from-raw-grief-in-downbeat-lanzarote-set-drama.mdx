  Is it possible to recover after the worst imaginable tragedy? Or are there
  some things that you just can’t get over? These are the themes of this muted
  British drama about raw grief from actor turned director Joseph Millson. It
  stars Sarah-Jane Potts as Anne, a woman in her 40s travelling alone in
  Lanzarote. Dressed head to toe in black, and unsmiling, Anne stands out from
  the other holidaymakers. And she doesn’t talk; there is a page in the notebook
  she uses to communicate with the words: “I’m not deaf. I just don’t speak.”
  From the start, it seems obvious that Anne is selectively mute – she has
  stopped talking, and there is a terrible reason for this. “The bereaved cannot
  communicate with the unbereaved,” wrote Iris Murdoch. This is true for Anne,
  whose holiday read is Murdoch’s The Sea, The Sea. In her interactions with
  other people, she is remote, unengaged, or impatient and irritated. It’s a big
  ask for an actor to perform in silence, but Potts’s big, brown, intelligent
  eyes speak volumes. But for a film, it’s not quite enough. There are no
  flashbacks; instead, the audience gathers crumbs about this terrible thing
  that happened to Anne – a photograph in her wallet, a business card. By chance
  she is thrown together with Bill, a big Irish man sympathetically played by
  David Ganly. Socially clumsy and good-hearted, Bill is also on holiday, a trip
  he planned as a treat for the kids after a messy divorce. Where Anne doesn’t
  talk, Bill can’t stop, and there are awkward, funny moments as he blathers on.
  It’s an interesting idea but the script struggles to navigate the complexity
  of Anne’s grief and in the end it doesn’t fully hang together. • Signs of Life
  is in UK and Irish cinemas from 5 September.
