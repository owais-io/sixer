  Becky Manawatu described her debut, 2022’s Auē, as “a breath in”. Its
  follow-up, Kataraina, she has called “a breath out”. It continues that first
  novel’s themes of intergenerational trauma and violence within a largely Māori
  community based around the town of Kaikourā, on the east coast of New
  Zealand’s South Island. Auē won multiple awards in New Zealand and became an
  international bestseller; while Kataraina fleshes out its backstory, it can
  also be read as a thrillingly immersive standalone. The main focus of this new
  novel is a minor character from Auē, Aunty Kat, the maternal aunt of brothers
  Ari and Taukiri whose story was covered in the previous book. Almost erased by
  domestic abuse in Auē, here she is accorded her full name, Kataraina Te Au,
  and a narrative that swings back and forth from her birth in 1981 to the
  present: early January 2020. Kataraina, the only surviving sibling of three,
  with a brother dead through gang warfare and a sister believed drowned, has
  been in a coma in hospital following a beating from her partner, Stuart
  Johnson. Stuart was then shot dead by Beth, the young daughter of Kat’s
  childhood friend, neighbour, and – most recently – lover, Tom Aiken. This
  episode formed the dramatic climax of Auē. Since the killing of Stuart, a
  stretch of water on his property, owned (or rather appropriated) by his family
  for decades and known locally as Johnson’s Swamp, is fast increasing in shape
  and size, for no logical reason. “The land had been septic,” according to Tom.
  “Johnsons spent more than a bloody century draining it. Like, man, let it be.
  All around was humped and hollowed, except this bit in the middle that seemed
  to, well, seemed – excuse this poetry shit again – to slip into chaos. It’s
  hard to describe, but just looking at the ground made you feel confused, like
  you were looking at something you shouldn’t be looking at.” This “septic”
  aspect colours the history of the swamp and its part in the various incidents
  that shape Kataraina’s story and that of her whānau (family). The ugly reality
  of coercive control thrums through the generations, from the unspoken violence
  meted out to Katarina’s beloved Nanny Liz by her husband, Jack, to Kat’s own
  situation with Stuart. Yet Nanny Liz is also an emblem of resistance to Kat.
  Aged 15, sneaking out to meet a married Pakehā (white New Zealander) – her
  fisher father’s boss – Kataraina borrows a coat from her grandmother as
  psychological protection: “Nanny Liz’s faux-fur jacket watched like a cat”.
  Each of the book’s chapter headings refers to Stuart’s death, suspended
  through history: “many years after the girl shot the man”, “one day before the
  girl shoots the man” and so on, until “the moment the girl shot the man”. It
  is interweaved with the much older tale of a young Māori woman’s encounter
  with a British mercenary at the swamp while gathering spearmint, a cataclysmic
  event that echoes through each chapter. It is relayed polyphonically, as if
  occurring simultaneously in the past and the present, with information given
  incrementally. “Our ancestor once lived close to the house where he was shot.
  She was at the river when a man approached her with some peaches from a can,
  but then he attacked her.” The woman fights back. This incident is integral to
  Tom’s assertion that the swamp contains “something you shouldn’t be looking
  at”, as a group of environmental scientists in the present day investigate its
  mysterious swelling. The land is viewed, to some extent, as tapu (sacred).
  Cairo, one of the scientists, recalls how her friendship with colleague Hana
  came about: “over a cigarette on a beach, which Hana … had only brought with
  her because she fantasised about smoking a tobacco pipe or cigarillo in
  Ōkarito, like Kerewin. Turned out they’d both read The Bone People before
  going there; art informed their work, whakapapa informed their work.” This
  exchange (whakapapa is essential to Māori genealogy and ties together history,
  culture, identity and the land) is crucial to the context of the book and to
  New Zealand (Aotearoa in Maōri) literature more generally. Kerewin is the
  chief protagonist of Keri Hulme’s 1984 Booker prize-winning novel The Bone
  People: Manawatu is, like Hulme and also Cairo and Hana, of Māori heritage.
  Her writing is often compared to Hulme, both in its subject matter and its
  free-associative structure. Manawatu’s blend of myth, legend and direct
  ancestry is unforced; when the swamp finally disgorges its secrets, the
  corporeal fuses with the supernatural. A taniwha or female water spirit, by
  turns malignant and benign, rises to the surface along with actual human
  remains. Vengeance seethes and simmers. Yet this is far from an unearthly or
  fey novel, but one rooted in materiality: food and laughter, fear and sex. “We
  burst from the trees, we were always bursting from the trees,” reflect two of
  the characters. An unstoppable life force dominates Kataraina: both the person
  and the novel. • Kataraina by Becky Manawatu is published by Scribe (£12.99).
