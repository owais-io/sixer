webTitle: Pre-budget lift for Rachel Reeves as UK business confidence rises

  Confidence among UK businesses has grown despite anxiety about the state of
  the economy, in a rare slice of positive news for the chancellor, Rachel
  Reeves, in the run-up to her autumn budget. An August poll of UK companies by
  Lloyds Bank showed that improved sentiment among manufacturers and retailers
  helped push overall optimism within UK plc up by two percentage points, with
  54% of companies now feeling confident in the current environment. It marked
  the fourth consecutive monthly increase in overall business sentiment,
  according to the Lloyds business barometer, driven by a growing number of
  businesses – roughly 63% – feeling strong about their own trading prospects.
  On that measurement alone, confidence reached its highest level since 2014.
  About half of all businesses now expect to hire more staff in the coming year
  despite growing costs. The survey found 38% of companies are expecting to have
  to raise wages by 3% or more, with the vast majority – 83% – saying that
  higher employment-related costs would have a limited impact on hiring plans.
  Overall optimism across the private sector comes despite jitters over the
  state of the economy, with levels of positive sentiment falling for the first
  time since the drop seen in April, when Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff
  announcements prompted fears over the future of global trade. Economic
  confidence fell three points to 44% this month, Lloyds said, although that
  remained above the longer-term average of 19%. However, the fact that business
  confidence continues to rise amid the economic gloom will be a rare piece of
  good news for the chancellor, given fears that a fresh round of tax increases
  – meant to bolster the public finances – could knock confidence and investment
  across the private sector as companies try to recoup and offset costs. Reeves
  is expected to announce a date for her autumn budget within days. “This
  continued upward trend in business confidence suggests UK firms remain
  optimistic about their own trading prospects while there is a modest cooling
  of confidence in the wider UK economy,” Hann-Ju Ho, a senior economist at
  Lloyds Bank’s commercial banking arm, said. “Firms are focusing on what they
  can control, with many looking to pursue growth opportunities, including
  entering new markets and adopting new technologies. “Wage expectations have
  seen a notable shift this month, but it remains to be seen whether this
  signals the start of a sustained trend or a temporary uplift, as they have
  been broadly stable in recent months.”
