  At least nine people, including five children, have been killed in an Israeli
  strike while fetching water in al-Mawasi, an area of southern Gaza which
  Israel has designated as a safe zone, health officials said. A doctor from
  al-Nasser hospital shared a picture of the children’s bodies in the hospital,
  as well as a picture of water jugs left in a pool of blood at the site of the
  attack on Tuesday. The attack came shortly after the Israel Defense Forces
  encouraged people to leave Gaza City for al-Mawasi, before Israel’s looming
  invasion of Gaza City. The Israeli military has sought to displace people from
  the city before its offensive and has promised that southern Gaza would be
  able to accommodate them, despite experts disagreeing with the suggestion. “We
  wish to remind you that in al-Mawasi, enhanced services will be provided with
  an emphasis on access to medical care, water and food,” the Israeli military’s
  Arabic-language spokesperson Avichay Adraee said in a post on X on Tuesday
  afternoon. Israel continued to push ahead with its operation and began the
  mobilisation of tens of thousands of reservists on Tuesday. At least 60,000
  reservists will be called up, with the service of an additional 20,000 to be
  extended as the Israeli military slowly ramps up its military activity in Gaza
  City, which it has described as the last stronghold of Hamas. Israel has said
  that the operation, known as Gideon’s Chariots II, to take over Gaza City will
  involve five divisions from the country’s standing army and could extend into
  next year. Already Israel has pushed into the western parts of Gaza City,
  levelling the once prosperous neighbourhood of Zeitoun and declaring the
  entire city a “dangerous combat zone” last week. It has intensified its
  strikes, claiming to have killed the spokesperson of Hamas’s armed wing, Abu
  Obeida, in a strike on an apartment building in Gaza City on Saturday. The
  Israeli strikes and gunfire killed at least 76 people across the Gaza Strip in
  the last 24 hours, Gaza health authorities said. On Monday, the world’s
  leading association of genocide scholars said Israel’s actions in Gaza meet
  the legal definition of the crime. Aid groups have warned that an invasion of
  Gaza City and the forced displacement of about 1 million people could have
  devastating humanitarian consequences. The population of the city has swelled
  over the course of the last 23 months as it became a refuge for hundreds of
  thousands of Palestinians displaced from the near 80% of Gaza that is under
  evacuation order. The city is already gripped by famine created by Israeli
  restrictions on aid entering Gaza, which experts say will worsen even in the
  absence of a military operation. Thirteen people, including three children,
  died from malnutrition on Tuesday, bringing the total number of people who
  have starved to death over the last 23 months to 361 – the majority of whom
  have died since July. Israel is seeking to forcibly displace Gaza City’s
  residents before its operation and has tried to entice Palestinians to
  southern Gaza, which already is packed with other displaced people. The head
  of the Red Cross, Mirjana Spoljaric Egger, said on Saturday that there is no
  safe way to conduct a mass evacuation of Gaza City and that no other part of
  Gaza had the capacity to absorb such mass displacement. Earlier in August, the
  UN human rights office spokesperson Thameen al-Kheetan said that Palestinians
  in al-Mawasi had “little or no access to essential services and supplies,
  including food, water, electricity and tents”. Many residents of Gaza City
  have refused to leave, suspicious of what awaits them in southern Gaza after
  Israel has attacked so-called humanitarian zones in the past. The Gaza City
  operation, pushed forward by the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu,
  under pressure from far-right members of his ruling coalition, faces stiff
  opposition at home. Tens of thousands of Israelis have marched across the
  country in protest against the war, which they say is aimless and endangers
  the lives of the remaining hostages in Gaza. Israeli media has reported
  internal opposition between the country’s cabinet and the military chief of
  staff. According to Israeli media’s retelling of a security cabinet meeting on
  Sunday, the Israeli military chief urged the government to take a ceasefire
  deal instead of pressing on with the Gaza City operation, which he said could
  harm the lives of hostages in Gaza. Hamas had accepted a ceasefire proposal
  two weeks prior that resembled an earlier US draft which Israel had approved
  in prior rounds of negotiations. Israel has yet to respond to the proposal,
  baffling mediators. Israel’s planned military operation in Gaza City as well
  as its continued systematic starving of the territory’s population has
  prompted a wave of global condemnation. On Tuesday, Belgium announced it would
  join a growing list of European countries in recognising Palestine as a state.
  It also announced it would ban goods from Israeli settlements in the West Bank
  and designate Hamas leaders, violent Israeli settlers and two far-right
  Israeli ministers as persona non grata. “This is not about sanctioning the
  Israeli people but about ensuring that their government respects international
  and humanitarian law and taking action to try to change the situation on the
  ground,” the Belgian foreign minister, Maxime Prévot, said in a post on X. He
  added that the EU should suspend its trade pact with Israel to further
  pressure it. The move further increases the growing international isolation of
  Israel as its war in Gaza and subsequent famine grinds on. At least 63,633
  Palestinians have been killed in Gaza over the last 23 months. Israel launched
  the war in Gaza after Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and took
  251 hostages on 7 October 2023.
