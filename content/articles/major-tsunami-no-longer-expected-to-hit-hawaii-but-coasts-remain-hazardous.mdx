  A major tsunami was not expected to strike Hawaii, a Pacific monitoring agency
  has said, after the initial waves hit the islands following a powerful
  magnitude-8.8 earthquake struck off Russia’s eastern coast. The Pacific
  Tsunami Warning Center, operated by the US National Weather Service, said in
  an update that “based on all available data”, a major tsunami was not expected
  to hit the state of Hawaii, although it warned all coasts could remain “a
  hazard to swimmers and boaters”, including people near the shore, due to sea
  level changes, powerful waves and strong currents. Hawaii’s emergency
  management agency said evacuation orders had been lifted and there were no
  reports of major damage. The tsunami warning for the state had been downgraded
  on Wednesday morning to a tsunami advisory. The highest recorded waves in
  Hawaii reached up to 1.8 metres (6ft). Tsunami warning sirens had sounded on
  Tuesday evening local time in Honolulu as the emergency department called for
  the evacuation of some coastal areas in preparation. The US Coast Guard
  advised all boats to leave the port ahead of the tsunami’s arrival and
  airports were briefly shut before being reopened. The first waves hit the
  islands shortly after 8pm local time, with a gauge at Hanalei recording a wave
  height of a metre (3ft) above normal sea level. The Haleiwa gauge, on Oahu’s
  North Shore, recorded a tsunami amplitude of 1.2 metres (4ft) above normal sea
  level. Later readings reported waves as high as 1.7 metres above normal sea
  level. The height of tsunami waves is only one factor in their
  destructiveness, with much depending on their speed and volume of moving
  water, as well as the shape of the shoreline. The massive quake struck early
  on Wednesday morning in Russia, generating tsunami waves of up to 4 metres on
  the country’s east coast, damaging buildings and prompting evacuation warnings
  in the region and across most of Japan’s east coast, officials said. The US
  tsunami warning system issued a warning of “hazardous tsunami waves” and a
  watch was also in effect for the US island territory of Guam and other islands
  of Micronesia. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said on Wednesday morning
  that there was no further tsunami threat to Guam, Rota, Tinian or Saipan and
  Japan’s Meteorological Agency downgraded its tsunami warnings to advisories.
  Parts of California’s coast remained under tsunami warnings and advisories on
  Wednesday morning, according to the National Tsunami Warning Center. The
  center states that tsunami warnings “mean that a tsunami with significant
  inundation is expected or occurring”. “Warnings indicate that widespread
  dangerous coastal flooding accompanied by powerful currents are possible and
  may continue for several hours after the initial wave arrival,” it adds. The
  US National Weather Service in Los Angeles reported early on Wednesday a
  “rapid and damaging surge” at the Port San Luis gauge, “going from low to high
  tide in just a few minutes”. Crescent City, California, saw waves as high as
  8ft, in line with the area’s highest tides but not high enough to cause
  flooding or other damage in the city’s downtown, officials told the San
  Francisco Chronicle. “It was a long night for all of us,” said Eric Wier, the
  city manager of Crescent City, which has endured dozens of tsunamis over the
  last century. “We were fortunate this time. There was significant tsunami
  surges. We’re still dealing with those now, but it did stay within the banks
  of Elk Creek.” Officials with the National Weather Service advised residents
  to be “cautious of dangerous currents” through the day. Tsunami advisories
  were also in effect for parts of the coastal areas of Oregon, Washington,
  Alaska and Canada’s British Columbia. On Tuesday night in Hawaii, the state’s
  governor, Josh Green, said that data from Midway Atoll, between Japan and
  Hawaii, measured tsunami waves from peak to trough of almost 6ft. Green said
  Black Hawk helicopters were activated and high-water vehicles were ready to go
  in case authorities need to rescue people. “But please do not put yourself in
  harm’s way,” he added. The governor said officials observed water receding by
  as much as 30ft at one Oahu harbor, before waves arrived. Cars jammed streets
  and highways in Honolulu as the tsunami alerts coincided with the Tuesday
  afternoon rush hour. Warning sirens blared as people moved to higher ground.
  Hawaii schools cancelled after-school and evening activities. There were long
  lines at gas stations near downtown Honolulu, with standstill traffic even in
  areas away from the shoreline. An up-to-date map of tsunami warnings,
  advisories and watches can be found on a map at the US tsunami warning
  system’s website. The Associated Press contributed reporting
