  What Happened at Hiroshima review – this rushed, flimsy look at a
  world-changing atrocity isn’t good enough

  Last year, the documentary Atomic People told the stories of some of the
  survivors of the nuclear bombs dropped in 1945 on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Most
  of them nonagenarians, some in their hundreds, they described with unfaltering
  clarity their experiences of being caught in the blast. They talked of people
  coming towards them with organs spilling forth, skin peeling off, one carrying
  a baby “burned black as stone”, and of lives lived thereafter with knowledge
  that threatened to corrode them from the inside. Some of the estimated 78,000
  who died instantly, out of a population of 350,000, left what looked like
  shadows against the buildings. Others were vaporised without even that tiny
  trace. Thousands more would die of radiation sickness by the end of the year,
  and then would begin the long tail of deaths from cancer caused by direct
  exposure and mutations passed down to later generations. Survivors were known
  as “hibakusha”, discouraged from speaking about their awful experiences, and
  were to varying degrees shunned thereafter, finding it difficult to marry and
  to find employment as people feared to let them “taint” their families or face
  the horror they embodied. It was a harrowing, strangely ethereal and delicate
  90 minutes of film, as interviewees remembered what their cities were like
  before the bombs, before the silver shimmer of the B-29 they all recall was
  first glimpsed against the clear blue sky. They closed their eyes and the very
  earliest days of childhood lived again. The documentary did not mark any
  particular anniversary – simply the fact that time was running out for these
  people, silenced for so long, to tell their stories, allowing them to
  function, in so far as is ever possible, as the warnings from history they
  want to pass on. The half-hour of What Happened at Hiroshima, marking the 80th
  anniversary of the bombings, feels, by contrast, like a rushed, crass thing –
  a duty done, a commissioning box ticked and a presenter, the journalist Jordan
  Dunbar, required to try to make up for its slightness by emoting instead. For
  many, perhaps, this will be the appropriate mode of delivery. I, however –
  ancient, intolerant, embittered on top of natural cynicism and reserve – still
  feel it as an unnecessary intrusion into a piece. Detachment and stoicism is
  what allows others’ stories to be thrown into the sharp, stark relief they
  deserve. Anything else, I think, pulls focus and does a disservice to the
  viewer and, more importantly, the subjects. The 30-minute run time is simply
  too short for such a topic. Take off the introductory few minutes (where they
  tell you what you’re going to tell you) and the last (where they tell you what
  they’ve told you) and there is precious little time left to tell anything at
  all. We skim the preceding history (the Tripartite Pact, 1940! Pearl Harbor,
  1941! The B-29 was called the Enola Gay!), then take in a few memories from
  the quartet of survivors interviewed. We watch Dunbar, visibly moved, in a
  museum dedicated to the bombings, the room filled with a panoramic photograph
  of the cities’ devastation. Then we take a brief look at the Cuban missile
  crisis and estimates of how many nuclear missiles are hunkered and bunkered
  round the world today – in case we thought the threat had receded. We’re left
  with just enough time for a furrowed brow and a bathetic comment that the
  people in charge may not be listening to survivors’ stories. When this
  generation is gone, asks Dunbar, will our leaders really understand what it
  means to push the button? This is where my patience really ran out. To descend
  to this level of asininity after the quiet dignity and appalling suffering
  recounted by contributors representing such a colossal, profound,
  world-changing event simply won’t do. I’m going to be charitable and assume
  that this is not going to be our national broadcaster’s only contribution
  towards marking the 80th anniversary of one of the worst atrocities in human
  history, of the dawn of a new age whose darkness and horrors have somehow had
  to have been accommodated within all of us since, wearing callouses on our
  souls. I’m going to assume there is something more fitting coming along.
  Perhaps this programme was intended for a younger, more tender demographic
  than mine and I am judging it by entirely the wrong criteria. I hope so. But I
  also hope that we can always distinguish between the need to reach and educate
  new audiences and the impulse to do so by pandering to them. What Happened at
  Hiroshima aired on BBC One and is available on iPlayer.
