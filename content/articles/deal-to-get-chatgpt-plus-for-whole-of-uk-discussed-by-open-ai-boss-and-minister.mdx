  The boss of the firm behind ChatGPT and the UK technology secretary discussed
  a multibillion-pound deal to give the entire country premium access to the AI
  tool, the Guardian has learned. Sam Altman, a co-founder of OpenAI, talked to
  Peter Kyle about a potential agreement to give UK residents access to its
  advanced product. According to two sources with direct knowledge of the
  meeting, the idea was floated as part of a broader discussion in San Francisco
  about opportunities for collaboration between OpenAI and the UK. Those close
  to the discussion say Kyle never really took the idea seriously, not least
  because it could have cost as much as £2bn. But the talks show the enthusiasm
  with which the technology secretary has embraced the artificial intelligence
  sector, despite concerns over the accuracy of some chatbot responses and
  implications for privacy and copyright. OpenAI offers free and subscription
  versions of ChatGPT. The paid version, ChatGPT Plus, costs $20 a month and
  gives users faster response times and priority access to new features. Kyle
  dined with Altman in March and April, according to transparency data released
  by the UK government. In July, Kyle signed an agreement with OpenAI to use AI
  in the UK’s public services. The non-binding deal could give OpenAI access to
  government data and lead to its software being used in education, defence,
  security and the justice system. Kyle has been a vocal champion of AI within
  government and has also embraced its use in his own role. In March, it emerged
  that he had asked ChatGPT for advice on a range of work-related questions,
  including why British businesses were not adopting AI and what podcasts he
  should appear on. The minister told PoliticsHome in January: “ChatGPT is
  fantastically good, and where there are things that you really struggle to
  understand in depth, ChatGPT can be a very good tutor for it.” The UK is one
  of OpenAI’s top five markets for paid ChatGPT subscriptions. An OpenAI
  spokesperson said: “Millions of Brits are already using ChatGPT every day for
  free. In July, we signed an MoU [a memorandum of understanding] with the
  government to explore how we can best support the growth of AI in the UK, for
  the UK. “In line with the government’s vision of using this technology to
  unlock economic opportunity for everyday people, our shared goal is to
  democratise access to AI. The more people who can use it, the more widely its
  benefits will spread.” The company has been in talks with several governments
  in recent months and has agreed a deal with the United Arab Emirates to
  “enable ChatGPT nationwide” and use the technology in public sectors including
  transport, healthcare and education. The UK government has been keen to
  attract AI investment from the US, having struck deals with OpenAI’s rivals
  Google and Anthropic earlier this year. Kyle has said that if a new UN
  security council were to be set up in a decade, technological clout –
  particularly in AI – would be a major factor in determining the most powerful
  countries. He told the Rest is Politics podcast in the spring: “I want us to
  be at the very forefront of [AI] because those countries will get to shape how
  it goes, how it is used and deployed.” Like other generative AI tools, ChatGPT
  can produce text, images, videos and music after receiving prompts by users.
  It does this by drawing on existing books, photos, footage and songs. This has
  raised questions about whether it amounts to copyright infringement, and the
  technology has also faced criticism for giving false information and bad
  advice. Ministers have come under fire from artists such as Elton John and Tom
  Stoppard over planned changes to copyright law that would allow AI companies
  to train their models using copyrighted work without permission unless the
  owner opts out. The changes, which the government is reviewing and consulting
  on, have led to claims from creatives that the Labour government has grown too
  close to big tech. UKAI, a trade body representing the UK’s artificial
  intelligence industry, has argued repeatedly that the government’s approach is
  focused too narrowly on big tech at the expense of smaller players. A
  government spokesperson said: “We don’t recognise these claims. We are working
  with OpenAI and other leading AI companies to explore investment in UK
  infrastructure, improve public services and rigorously test the security of
  new technology before it is made public.” The science and technology
  department said it had not taken forward any proposal to give UK residents
  access to ChatGPT Plus or discussed it with other departments.
