  The Indian government has secured the repatriation of ancient gem relics
  linked to the Buddha’s remains, two months after it halted their auction in
  Hong Kong. In a post on X, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, said the
  return of the Piprahwa gems after 127 years was “a joyous day for our cultural
  heritage”. Sotheby’s postponed the sale of the gems in May after the Indian
  culture ministry threatened to take legal action against the auction house in
  Indian and Hong Kong courts and through international bodies “for violations
  of cultural heritage laws”. Many Buddhists believe the gems are imbued with
  the presence of the Buddha and should be treated as corporeal remains. The
  ministry said the precious artefacts would be formally unveiled during a
  special ceremony and placed on public display. The purchase of the gems was
  secured through a public-private partnership between the Indian government and
  Godrej Industries Group, it added. Modi wrote: “It would make every Indian
  proud that the sacred Piprahwa relics of Bhagwan Buddha have come home after
  127 long years. These sacred relics highlight India’s close association with
  Bhagwan Buddha and his noble teachings. It also illustrates our commitment to
  preserving and protecting different aspects of our glorious culture.” The gems
  were sold by three descendants of William Claxton Peppé, a British colonial
  landowner who in 1898 excavated the gems on his estate in northern India.
  Their decision to auction the gems was met with an international outcry from
  Buddhist leaders, academics and devotees. The 334 precious stones, which were
  expected to sell at auction for about HK$100m (£9.7m), include amethysts,
  coral, garnets, pearls, rock crystals, shells and gold, either worked into
  pendants, beads and other ornaments or in their natural form. The gems were
  originally buried in a dome-shaped funerary monument called a stupa in
  Piprahwa, in present-day Uttar Pradesh, India, in about 240-200BC when they
  were mixed with some of the cremated remains of the Buddha, who died in
  approximately 480BC. The British crown claimed Peppé’s find under the 1878
  Indian Treasure Trove Act, with the bones and ash presented to the Buddhist
  monarch King Chulalongkorn of Siam. Most of the 1,800 gems went to what is now
  the Indian Museum in Kolkata, while Peppé was permitted to retain
  approximately a fifth of them. In a statement, Sotheby’s said it was delighted
  to have facilitated the historic return of the gems to India. “This completes
  our active search over the past two months to identify the best possible
  custodian for the gems. Today is the culmination of our close collaboration
  with the Peppé family, the government of India and the newly-announced owners
  of the gems – the Godrej Industries Group. Now concluded, this sale will see
  the permanent return of the Piprahwa Gems to India where they will be on
  public display for years to come,” it said. Pirojsha Godrej, the executive
  vice-chair of Godrej Industries Group, said: “We are deeply honoured to
  contribute to this historic moment. The Piprahwa gems are not just artefacts,
  they are timeless symbols of peace, compassion and the shared heritage of
  humanity.” Chris Peppé, one of the former owners and the great-grandson of
  William Claxton Peppé, said his family shared Modi’s excitement at the
  repatriation of the gems. “We are happy that the true significance of the
  Piprahwa discovery has finally received the public recognition it always
  deserved and that the gems will be available for the public to see,” he added.

  Peppé was the grandson of William Claxton Peppé; however, he is a
  great-grandson.
