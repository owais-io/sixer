  UK firefighters have warned that 2025 is on track to beat the national record
  for wildfires, with frontline staff “pushed to their limits”. On Wednesday, a
  major incident was declared in the North York Moors national park, with 20
  fire engines deployed to tackle at least 5 sq km of moorland that has been
  burning since Monday. It follows a similar major incident over the weekend
  tackled by Dorset and Wiltshire fire service and a blaze at Arthur’s Seat in
  Edinburgh. In England and Wales alone, crews have already tackled 856
  wildfires this year, the National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) said – a third
  higher than the record-breaking totals seen in 2022 and six times the number
  recorded last year – warning that hot and dry weather means the figures will
  likely only increase. The NFCC warned members of the public not to use
  barbecues in open countryside, parks and moorland areas. In addition, the
  organisation advised people not to discard cigarettes, matches or glass
  bottles, as they can ignite dry vegetation. The NFCC chair, Phil Garrigan,
  said firefighters were “already being pushed to their limits” with recent
  major incidents “showing just how demanding and dangerous these events can
  be”. “Each wildfire can take days – sometimes weeks – to bring under control,
  tying up crews and specialist equipment and placing huge strain on other vital
  fire and rescue work. There’s a real human toll on our firefighters too who
  are undertaking the most arduous work in the toughest conditions. “We are
  already seeing more wildfires at this point in the year than in 2022 – which
  itself was a record year – and that is deeply concerning. This is against a
  backdrop of sustained cuts in funding and reducing firefighter numbers – with
  11,000 fewer firefighters in England now than there were 10 years ago,
  alongside a 20% increase in demand over the same period. Climate change is
  fuelling more frequent and intense extreme weather events, and wildfires are
  no longer a seasonal threat; they are a persistent and growing risk to life,
  property, and the environment.” He called for “long-term, sustained investment
  so that fire and rescue services have the people, resources, and equipment
  they need to protect our communities, no matter how many fronts they are
  fighting on”. Researchers say the sea surrounding the Yorkshire coast is
  likely to break temperature records in 2025. Temperatures are 2C higher than
  in the 1980s, putting at risk some species that are a key part of the food
  chain. Prof Rodney Forster, of the University of Hull, told the BBC the North
  Sea “appears to be a bit of a hot spot, warming faster than anywhere else and
  we don’t know yet why that is”.
