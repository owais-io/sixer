  Thames Water has agreed a payment plan with the water regulator for fines it
  owes worth £123m, as it races to secure funding to avoid temporary
  nationalisation. The water company, which serves 16 million customers across
  London and the south-east, is trying to pull together a deal to avoid
  collapse. Earlier this month, the government approved the appointment of
  insolvency advisers FTI Consulting to consult on plans for Thames Water to be
  placed into a special administration regime. The debt-laden utility company
  was hit with a record £104m fine by Ofwat in May over environmental breaches
  involving sewage spills, after failing to operate and manage its treatment
  works and wastewater networks effectively. At the same time, a further £18.2m
  fine was levied on Thames for breaking dividend rules, the first penalty of
  its kind in the water industry. Ofwat said the company had paid out cash to
  investors despite having fallen short in its services to customers and its
  environmental record. The penalties were originally due to be paid by 20
  August but the regulator has given the company some breathing space to pay the
  fines. Ofwat had previously told Thames that the penaltieshad to be “paid by
  the company and its investors, and not by customers”. The regulator has
  approved Thames’s request for a payment plan, which will result in it paying
  £24.5m, or 20% of the penalties, by the end of September, with the rest to be
  paid later. The company will pay the remainder on the earliest of three
  possible dates, which would be either 30 days after the implementation of a
  restructuring plan, or if Thames enters an SAR the balance would be due 30
  days after the end of that process. The final deadline for payment of the fine
  will be 31 March 2030. Lynn Parker, the senior director of enforcement at
  Ofwat, said: “This payment plan continues to hold Thames Water to account for
  their failures but also recognises the ongoing equity raise and
  recapitalisation process.” Thames said in a statement it “continues to work
  closely with stakeholders to secure a market-led recapitalisation which
  delivers for customers and the environment as soon as practicable”. The
  company confirmed the penalties “will not be funded by customer bills”.
