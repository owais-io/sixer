  Signing a goalkeeper with a reputation as lofty as Gianluigi Donnarumma would
  usually register as a powerful statement of intent but Manchester City’s
  addition of Italy’s Euro 2020 hero, the keeper whose saves guided Paris
  Saint-Germain to a first Champions League last season, has been met with a
  rather mixed reaction. City’s troubled start to the season adds confusion, so
  too Pep Guardiola’s case history with goalkeepers. Ederson was beloved by City
  fans for being a maverick and played a key role in the team’s serial title
  wins. Just 32, relatively young for players in his position, a dalliance with
  a move to Saudi Arabia last year and the interest of Fenerbahce – the club he
  has joined – hastened his exit. That Stefan Ortega, a lesser keeper, was
  turned to last season by Guardiola suggested terminal frustrations from
  someone for whom Ederson’s mix of ball-playing ability and acrobatic saves was
  once ideal. James Trafford’s summer return to City from Burnley for a not
  inconsiderable fee of £27m also foretold the Brazilian’s exit. Trafford’s
  struggles so far, in defeats to Tottenham and Brighton, appear to have forced
  City’s hand into doing a deal because it could be done rather than it making
  complete sense. Manchester United are understood to have been a competitor for
  Donnarumma’s signature, even a favoured destination. Instead, to meet their
  own keeping problem, they have signed Belgium’s Senne Lammens. The demands of
  Donnarumma’s representatives, led by Enzo Raiola, who took his cousin Mino
  Raiola’s client list when the super agent died in 2022, were beyond the wage
  limits United were prepared to go to. The same went for Aston Villa’s Emiliano
  Martínez. In a reverse of United stealing in to land Alexis Sánchez in 2018,
  or United returning for Cristiano Ronaldo in 2021 when he seemed set for
  Eastlands, City snapped up a goalkeeper whose high wages no longer fitted the
  PSG structure either. Hugo Viana is the sporting director at City now, Txiki
  Begiristain, so long Guardiola’s guiding hand, having stepped down, and the
  club’s business has taken on a different hue. Guardiola has so far struggled
  to assimilate the four signings made in January, let alone the seven players
  coming in this summer, including three goalkeepers, Marcus Bettinelli
  completing the trio. The question is whether Donnarumma was bought for club or
  manager; Guardiola’s long-term future is nebulous despite his contract
  extension to 2027, a summer interview with GQ magazine making mention of his
  fatigue and the heavy pressures of the City job. Roll back to 2016, the summer
  of Guardiola’s arrival, and almost his first move was to replace the popular
  Joe Hart with the ill-fated Claudio Bravo, the Chilean bought from Barcelona
  and whose ball-playing ability was favoured over the then England No 1’s
  chest-beating heroism and reflex saves. The Bravo experiment, which failed
  once he appeared unable to make regulation saves, was discontinued. Willy
  Caballero, a veteran, played instead of Hart, who was loaned to Torino and
  subsequently lost his way until a late-career revival at Celtic. The doubts on
  Donnarumma centre on his lack of ball-playing ability, a facet so important to
  Guardiola. Statistics show he was nowhere near as involved in his team’s
  buildups last season as, for example, David Raya at Arsenal or Alisson at
  Liverpool, the latter the gold standard, pairing traditional save-making with
  contributions to overall play. Alisson averaged 31.7 passes per 90 minutes in
  the Premier League, compared to Donnarumma, 23.4 in Ligue 1, with an average
  of six long passes from the Italian to Ederson’s 9.4. At PSG, Luis Enrique,
  Guardiola’s former teammate, of a similar philosophy, has been happy to forge
  on with Lucas Chevalier, signed from Lille, another modish hybrid of
  keeper/playmaker. What have seemed since Hart’s demise to be the
  non-negotiables of any goalkeeper playing for Guardiola are likely to be
  bucked by the new arrival. Perhaps it signals a change in approach from a
  coach unafraid to innovate, who has talked about the more physical, aggressive
  game his teams must now deal with. Despite some downturns, Donnarumma has
  proved himself a brilliant goalkeeper in the traditional sense, at 26, with
  much ahead of him. Though Guardiola, perhaps his time at Barcelona with Lionel
  Messi aside, has always bent teams to his own, exacting specifications rather
  than star players.
