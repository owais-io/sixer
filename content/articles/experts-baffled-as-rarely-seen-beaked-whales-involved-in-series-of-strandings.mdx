  A series of strandings of one of the world’s deepest dwelling and most rarely
  seen types of whale in the last few days has left experts baffled over why
  they might have appeared in such numbers. Beaked whales are used to deep ocean
  waters and are so rarely seen that some species have only ever been identified
  through dead specimens. But on 26 and 27 July there were reports from western
  Ireland, Orkney in Scotland and the Netherlands of these whales being
  stranded, raising concerns that human actions could be implicated in the
  animals’ deaths. “When you see these divers in the shallow North Sea, you know
  that it’s going to be a grim end,” said Dr Jeroen Hoekendijk, a marine
  scientist and photographer who attended the scene of the Netherlands stranding
  on 26 July. A male and a female were beached between Heemskerk and Wijk aan
  Zee, north of The Hague, where the sloping shores of the southern North Sea
  are a notorious black spot for whale strandings. “When SOS Dolfijn [the Dutch
  cetacean rescue team] arrived on the scene the two whales were thrashing
  wildly in the surf,” said Hoekendijk. “They were obviously animals in
  distress.” Although the whales were kept cool and wet with hoses, the male
  died soon after being found, and the second animal, a female, was euthanised
  to save it from further stress. On 27 July two True’s beaked whales, a mother
  and calf, were found stranded in North Mayo, Ireland, according to Dr Simon
  Berrow of Irish Whale and Dolphin Group. The female died and the calf swam
  off, but is “unlikely to survive”, Berrow said. On the same weekend in Papa
  Westray, Orkney, four northern bottlenose whales, also a species of beaked
  whale, were found dead, said Dr Andrew Brownlow of the University of Glasgow.
  Brownlow and his colleagues from the Scottish Marine Stranding Scheme (SMASS)
  also attended last year’s mass stranding of 77 pilot whales on Sanday, Orkney.
  “July is a particularly bad month for strandings,” he told BBC Scotland. There
  may be natural reasons for these incidents – there was a suggestion that the
  2024 Sanday event was caused by the pilot whales being pursued by a pod of
  orcas. But the human-induced climate emergency is also causing warming waters
  that alter feeding habits throughout the marine food chain. And with seismic
  surveys for oil and naval sonar exercises also implicated in other beaked
  whale strandings (these types of underwater disturbance can cause diving
  whales to surface too quickly, thereby suffering decompression sickness) the
  impact of increased military activity is also a possible reason for these
  strandings. Whereas other cetaceans – whales, dolphins or porpoises – can
  sometimes be refloated, beaked whales, possibly 100 miles (160km) or more from
  their natural environment, are already too stressed. “They will not survive
  any attempt at a return since the animals won’t be able to feed,” said
  Hoekendijk. Reporting on initial findings from the weekend, Brownlow said: “We
  found extensive liver pathology in the bottlenoses, possibly consistent with
  acute starvation.” He added that there may have been “anthropogenic noise
  disturbance”. SMASS and the University of Utrecht’s strandings investigation
  team were quickly on the scenes, and were able to remove the carcasses for
  immediate necropsy. Their prompt action is especially important because
  evidence of any sonic disturbance that may have led to the whales’ stranding
  can only be detected from swift examination of hair cells in the animal’s
  inner ear. Once these have started to degrade, analysis becomes impossible.
  Despite being large animals – up to 13 metres long – beaked whales, so called
  for their prominent snouts or beaks, are among the least known of all
  cetaceans. Diving so deep in the dark ocean, they rely on echo-location to
  navigate and to find their food. They live in a world of sound, which is why
  anthropogenic or human-created noise pollution has such a serious effect on
  them. They also hold the record for the deepest and the longest dives of any
  animal. Cuvier’s beaked whales, bearing satellite tags, have been tracked off
  the coast of California at up to 3,000 metres in depth.
