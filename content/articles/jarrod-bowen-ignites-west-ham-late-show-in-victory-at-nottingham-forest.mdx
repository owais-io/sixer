  Just where would West Ham be without Jarrod Bowen? Five days since confronting
  angry supporters after Graham Potter’s side succumbed to a third successive
  defeat, Bowen’s clever first-time finish, with full time looming, was the
  catalyst for West Ham’s first win of the season. Goals by Lucas Paquetá,
  poised to stay after West Ham dismissed an inquiry from Aston Villa, and
  Callum Wilson, the former from the penalty spot, ensured an eerily comfortable
  finish. By the end, as Bowen was serenaded by the delighted supporters in the
  away end, it was hard to remember which of these teams was supposed to be
  engulfed by crisis. If discussions in the coming days dictate the future of
  Nuno Espírito Santo at Nottingham Forest, then the international break will
  surely bring a little respite for Potter. For Forest – in front of the
  watching owner, Evangelos Marinakis, this was a dreadful performance and a
  pathetic, and untimely, collapse. Bowen could have made it 4-0 deep into added
  time but Matz Sels prevented the England forward from inflicting further
  damage. “It is a really pleasing day for us because with the results we’ve had
  it is very easy to be negative and lose trust and confidence,” Potter said.
  “This is the world we’re in, you get written off in your job after a week,
  which is ridiculous.” The day after Forest supporters hastily booked flights
  and hotels following the hotly anticipated release of their Europa League
  fixtures, this match fell flat and West Ham fashioned the best chances.
  Wilson, who arrived on a free this summer, impressed off the bench, forcing
  Sels to tip over a deflected strike within a few minutes of replacing Niclas
  Füllkrug and he later tested the Forest goalkeeper from an awkward angle after
  showing strength in the box. Marinakis has spent more than £160m on 10
  signings this window after the arrival of the goalkeeper John Victor, with
  another, the left-back Cuiabano, also from Botafogo, poised to join before the
  transfer deadline on Monday. Forest’s most recent arrival, Nicolò Savona, was
  paraded on the pitch before kick-off but while five began on the bench only
  one of their summer additions, Dan Ndoye, started. James McAtee replaced
  Ndoye, who struggled, approaching the hour while Igor Jesus later replaced
  Chris Wood, something of a like‑for‑like change. Nuno waited until the
  penultimate minute of normal time to introduce the forwards Arnaud Kalimuendo
  and Omari Hutchinson. For so long this was a contest punctuated by misplaced
  passes and unforced errors, the West Ham debutant Mateus Fernandes, a £42m
  signing from Southampton, one of few players to make a positive impression
  before Bowen, with six minutes of regular time to play, produced another
  moment to remember. Until then it seemed West Ham would take heart from not
  only avoiding the ignominy of a fourth defeat in a row courtesy of a
  disciplined display but also a welcome first clean sheet. Bowen’s goal, which
  stemmed from an El Hadji Malick Diouf throw‑in down the left, gave West Ham
  the leg‑up that prompted Forest to crumble. An on-the-turn Bowen squeezed his
  shot in at Sels’s near post and raced towards the away fans, sliding on his
  knees and then kissing the West Ham badge. Paquetá went ballistic, losing his
  footing after booting one of the balls behind the goal as his teammates mobbed
  Bowen. Then it was Paquetá’s turn, the Brazil midfielder sending Sels the
  wrong way after Crysencio Summerville, on as a substitute, was tripped in the
  box by Ibrahim Sangaré, who had been a target for West Ham. Paquetá celebrated
  by pretending to throw away a mobile phone – presumably a call from Villa –
  before beating his chest and kissing the irons on his shirt. The defender
  Nayef Aguerd, who has made it clear he wishes to leave West Ham, was
  conspicuous by his absence. Things quickly spiralled for Forest, who struggled
  to test Mads Hermansen at the other end. Chris Wood sent a tame header at the
  West Ham goalkeeper a minute into the second half but it was a listless
  display. Nothing came off for Morgan Gibbs-White and Elliot Anderson, whose
  consistent performances were rewarded with an England call-up, was also
  outfoxed in midfield. Wilson capped the scoring, glancing in Diouf’s cross
  unmarked after eluding Murillo and Sels prevented Bowen making things uglier.
  Those talks with Marinakis promise to be interesting. Might this result now
  give the conversation a different twist? “It doesn’t help,” Nuno said. “It was
  shocking today. Everybody at Forest, we are very sad and upset, but there is
  no connection between [these] things. We will try to separate it and move
  forward in the right direction.”
