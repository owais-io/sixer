  “You will feel a little pressure.” My doctor had instructed me to lower my
  boxers, bend forward and place my elbows on the table. As with most men over
  50, it was time for my annual digital rectal exam, or DRE: those riveting
  moments when the doctor takes a “look” at the prostate gland, which is just
  below the bladder and in front of the rectum. Its position makes the
  examination difficult. The physician inserts a well-lubricated finger into the
  patient’s rectum to feel for abnormalities such as lumps, nodules or areas of
  hardness. As uncomfortable as the procedure can be, in my experience, it
  rarely lasts for more than 10 seconds. As always, she said everything looked
  fine. In my rush to pull my boxers up and change the subject, I didn’t bother
  to ask any more questions. At the time, I was clueless that as men age, the
  prostate becomes increasingly susceptible to cancer. In the rare event the
  disease tops the news cycle, it’s because of high-profile diagnoses, such as
  for former US president Joe Biden in May, Nelson Mandela, Robert De Niro and
  the Chicago Cubs hall of famer Ryne Sandberg, who died in late July. Even so,
  important details of the illness often go unreported. I – like many others –
  typically dismissed the topic with a yawn, being of the uninformed but
  persistent impression that it’s “the best cancer to have”. All I knew was that
  prostate cancer tends to move slowly and can be successfully treated when
  detected early. Now I am a prostate cancer survivor, whose prostatectomy in
  2020 almost came too late. I didn’t know that in the US, prostate cancer is
  the second leading cause of cancer death in men. One in eight will be
  diagnosed with it. One in 44 will die from it. Being uninformed about those
  details and testing options could have killed me. *** “Prostate cancer has
  been called the Silent Epidemic,” said Dr Samuel L Washington, a urologic
  surgeon who specializes in oncology at the University of California in San
  Francisco. Even with an active lifestyle, healthy nutritional regimen and
  digital screenings, cancer can sneak in undetected. “Many men with prostate
  cancer won’t experience any outward signs or symptoms until the disease is
  advanced, which is why testing is so critical,” said Dr Clifford Gluck, a
  urologist and Founder of Dr Gluck’s Wellness Center in Massachusetts. “If not
  caught early, it can break free of the prostate and run unchecked through the
  body, with a particular penchant for bone.” Once prostate cancer has spread to
  other parts of the body, the five-year relative survival rate is only 37%. “In
  2023, only about 38% of men between 50 and 64 were screened for the disease,”
  said Washington. “Sadly, a lack of screening remains one of many factors
  leading to increased rates of men presenting with more advanced disease over
  the last decade. The more advanced the cancer, the harder it is to treat.”
  Before my 62nd year, I routinely postponed my annual physical, assuming I was
  bulletproof. I was athletic and ate a plant-based diet. My life was free of
  processed foods, recreational drugs, tobacco, asbestos and weapons-grade
  plutonium. I experienced no symptoms indicative of prostate cancer, such as
  erectile dysfunction or urinary issues that reportedly led to the former
  president’s diagnosis. Then, after a couple of cross-country moves with my
  family, I no longer had a primary physician. Dismissing my claims of
  invincibility, my wife handed me a list of internists. I booked a physical,
  and my new doctor ordered my first-ever PSA (prostate-specific antigen) test.
  PSA is a protein produced by the prostate. Normal and cancerous prostate cells
  produce it, but cancerous ones tend to produce more. That said, an elevated
  PSA level is not always indicative of cancer. Generally, a normal, or
  non-elevated score for men over 60 is under four; for men under 59, under
  two-and-a-half; and for younger men, under one. But “PSA levels differ for
  each person,” said Dr Ash Tewari, professor and chairperson of the department
  of urology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. “While scores below
  four are preferred, it is most important to understand whether a PSA level is
  changing from year to year.” Variables such as family history, overall health,
  nutrition and race can have an effect. “At the very least, I urge patients to
  have the conversation with their doctor,” he said. Mine was a harrowing 17. My
  doctor called, speaking with a breathless urgency that made me feel I might
  not live to the end of the conversation. “It’s almost certain,” he said, “that
  you have prostate cancer.” The PSA test is a common, though imperfect,
  screening test for prostate cancer recommended by many urologists and primary
  care physicians for men starting at age 50. It is also one of the only ways to
  catch prostate cancer early. I asked my two previous primary care physicians
  why they had never ordered one, and they argued that the test sets off too
  many false alarms and causes undue stress; elevated PSA levels can be
  symptomatic of issues other than cancer, such as an infection. Also, I had
  never asked for one. (They must have confused my BA in English with a medical
  degree.) After hearing I had been diagnosed with prostate cancer, one
  conceded: “In hindsight, a PSA test would have been a good idea.” Their
  reluctance is not unusual. Many doctors in the US shy away from prescribing
  the test because of the uncertainty of what an elevated score means, how
  patients react to that uncertainty and risks associated with subsequent
  exploratory procedures like biopsies. A PSA test can correctly indicate that
  prostate cancer is present, as it did for me. But it can also result in a
  false positive, suggesting cancer is present when it isn’t (6 to 7% per
  screening round); a false negative, or not picking up that cancer is present
  (according to the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 15%
  of people with a normal PSA test result may have prostate cancer); or catch
  slow-growing cancers that might never have caused issues. The latter is called
  overdiagnosis, and treatment can expose “a person unnecessarily to potential
  complications”, according to the National Cancer Institute: these include
  urine leakage, increased urination, loose stools or rectal bleeding, and loss
  of erections or decreased erections. Current estimates suggest that 20%–40% of
  screen-detected prostate cancers may never have caused harm, with risk varying
  by age, PSA levels, and Gleason Score. “There are risks to the test,” said Dr
  Nancy L Keating, MD, MPH, professor of healthcare policy &amp; medicine at
  Harvard Medical School. The PSA test has a C rating from the US Preventive
  Services Task Force (USPSTF). For context, an A rating means the USPSTF
  strongly recommends the test. A C means doctors may offer it, “but that
  patients should make an individual decision about screening after discussing
  potential benefits and harms with their doctor”, said Keating. “There appears
  to be a modest benefit to screening for some men,” said Keating. “But most
  prostate cancers are not likely to be deadly, and many men will experience the
  harms of screening, such as anxiety and unnecessary biopsies, and treatments
  like radiation or removal of the prostate that can lead to incontinence and
  erectile dysfunction, without experiencing benefits,” said Keating, who thinks
  it is important for patients to understand the test’s limitations. In one 2024
  study that followed more than 400,000 men aged 50-69, one invitation to do a
  PSA test produced a small mortality benefit. “The small reduction in prostate
  cancer deaths by using the test to screen healthy men does not outweigh the
  potential harms,” Professor Richard Martin, lead author of the study and
  cancer research scientist at the University of Bristol in the UK, said at the
  time. “This results in some men going on to have invasive treatment that they
  don’t need, many years earlier than without screening, and the test is also
  failing to spot some cancers that do need to be treated.” Regret following a
  prostate biopsy isn’t rare – even when no cancer is found. A 2024 multicenter
  cohort study reported that about 5% of men regretted undergoing the procedure,
  often due to pain, bleeding, or unexpected psychological distress. In
  qualitative studies, men who believed they had been overdiagnosed and
  unnecessarily treated reported lasting regret, uncertainty, and emotional
  distress – even years after treatment. Men more susceptible to prostate
  cancer, and therefore more likely to benefit from a PSA test, include African
  American men, men with a family history of prostate cancer, and those with
  genetic mutations such as BRCA1 or BRCA2, according to the American Cancer
  Society. Gluck noted that the PSA test has a low USPSTF grade “primarily due
  to concerns about side-effects from surgery or radiation treatments”. But
  advances in technology, treatment and surgical techniques – such as
  high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), a non-invasive treatment that uses
  targeted sound waves to destroy prostate cancer while preserving urinary and
  sexual function – make screening a “far more favorable proposition” now, he
  said. *** My PSA score definitely spiked my anxiety, despite knowing I might
  only have an infection. The only way to determine what it meant was an MRI and
  a prostate biopsy. I dreaded the biopsy, which was to a digital exam what a
  root canal is to flossing. My urologist explained that there were some risks,
  such as infection and false negatives, but for me, confirming whether I had
  cancer far outweighed them. Nothing about these processes counted as pleasant.
  For the MRI, I was ensconced in the machine for about 40 minutes. A week after
  that, the doctor inserted an ultrasonic probe into my rectum to guide him as
  he extracted 12 small samples of my prostate. The biopsy redefined my concept
  of vulnerability, but although it seemed like hours, it took less than 20
  minutes – and anticipating the pain was worse than the actual pain. After a
  few days of mild tenderness, I was back to normal. For all of the worry and
  discomfort, if the biopsy revealed no trace of cancer, I would have uncorked
  the champagne. Unfortunately, my results showed a high Gleason score – which
  measures how different cancer cells look under a microscope compared with
  normal cells – consistent with aggressive prostate cancer. But I was relieved
  to hear that the disease hadn’t spread beyond the prostate membrane. Had I
  waited another two or three months, according to my post-operation pathology
  report, it probably would have. Six weeks after the biopsy, I underwent a
  radical robotic nerve-sparing prostatectomy, a roughly five-hour operation to
  remove the prostate using minimally invasive tools. Finding data on success
  rates was frustrating given the myriad factors that can affect the outcome,
  which include Gleason scores, age, health, obesity, comorbidities and whether
  or not the cancer has metastasized beyond the prostate. I banked on my fitness
  and the skill of my surgeon as deciding factors to undergo the operation. My
  greatest fears were long-term incontinence or erectile dysfunction, but I was
  fortunate not to suffer either. As lucky as I was, earlier testing and
  detection would have afforded me more treatment options. “The benefits of
  early detection can’t be overstated, which is why I advise men between 50 and
  70 years of age to have a PSA discussion annually,” said Tewari. “PSA
  screening combined with imaging is an important approach to effectively screen
  for prostate cancer.” It took moving across the country, my wife’s diligence
  and a doctor who routinely prescribed PSA tests for my cancer to be diagnosed.
  It was a complicated road, and experts’ divergence on the effectiveness of
  screening show just how difficult it can be for a layperson to make these
  kinds of medical decisions. It’s not ideal to rely on a testing option that at
  best results in an estimated 10 out of 1,000 people avoiding death from
  prostate cancer, with treatment options that can result in incontinence and
  sexual dysfunction. But taking the test when I did had a dramatic impact. It
  saved my life. At the very least, I wish I’d had an earlier opportunity for a
  detailed discussion with my doctor. Given what I know now, I would have
  preferred screening and early detection, because for me, there is no such
  thing as the best type of cancer. Ed Manning is a 67-year-old technology
