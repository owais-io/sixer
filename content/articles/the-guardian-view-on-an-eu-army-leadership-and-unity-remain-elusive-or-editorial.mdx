  The Guardian view on an EU army: leadership and unity remain elusive |

  The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, called for the creation of a
  European army earlier this year, suggesting that, this time, the continent
  might finally be serious. Defence budgets are rising. Threats are mounting.
  The US is distracted. Surely now is the moment. Except, of course, it isn’t.
  For all the political soundbites that rattle sabres with increasing
  confidence, Europe is probably no closer to fielding a unified military force
  than it was when the French rejected the European Defence Community in 1954.
  The problem is not one of capacity. Europe, including the UK, collectively
  boasts about 1.5m active military personnel, and some of the world’s most
  successful defence firms. The problem, as ever, is politics. Or more
  precisely: who leads? Germany, claiming a Zeitenwende (turning point), and
  asking the EU to exempt military investment from budget rules, might be the
  frontrunner. Poland is spending more as a share of GDP than anyone. The French
  would like to think they would be at the front of any queue. But their
  Gaullist, unilateral instincts run deep. Italy has industrial knowhow but
  lacks the economic heft. Post-Brexit, the UK is building bridges with the EU’s
  military powers but it still sees itself as Nato’s keystone. And the Baltic
  states? They want no European project that might scare off Washington. Even
  defining a European army is difficult. Would it be a single force under the EU
  flag, combining the 27 national armed forces of the EU members into one common
  force? Or something looser, to keep Irish and Austrian neutrality intact?
  Could it be a smaller European intervention force? Or a joint effort by
  regional groupings in a new hat? The short answer is no one can agree on
  anything but disagreement. Squabbling might not be the best response to an
  increasingly assertive, hawkish and unpredictable Russian giant. Moscow’s
  full-scale invasion of Ukraine made territorial defence a pressing concern.
  Suddenly, Europe remembered why armies exist. Brussels pins its hopes of an
  industrial renaissance on a five-year rearmament plan that is meant to reduce
  reliance on US contractors. European firms like Rheinmetall and MBDA are
  scaling up, but the economies of scale found in the US military industrial
  complex elude the continent. Everyone wants to protect their local champion.
  No wonder the bloc has appointed a commissioner for defence whose role is
  about overseeing the companies making drones, shells and missiles – not the
  armed forces per se. A Gallup poll in 45 countries last year showed deep
  ambivalence toward war among Europeans. Four of the five least willing to
  fight were in the EU – including Spain, Germany, and Italy, where only 14%
  said they’d take up arms. Even in frontline states like Poland and Lithuania,
  fewer than half were willing to fight. This pacifist mood reflects an EU
  integration designed to make war between member states unthinkable. The irony
  is that the European army is seen as a symbol of independence from the US –
  while quietly relying on American satellites, command structures and
  munitions. Many European countries have upped defence spending, but they are
  not ready to go it alone. An integrated force would demand pooled sovereignty,
  unified command and a level of political consensus that don’t currently exist.
  That may change. But for now, Europe continues to depend on Washington’s
  capricious leadership – even as it dreams of “strategic autonomy”.
