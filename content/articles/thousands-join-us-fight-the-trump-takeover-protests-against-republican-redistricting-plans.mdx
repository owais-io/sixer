  Thousands gathered in cities and towns across 34 states on Saturday for a
  national day of protest against Republican redistricting plans in Texas and
  elsewhere. “Fight the Trump Takeover” was anchored in Austin, Texas, with
  other sites spread nationwide. In Austin alone, more than 5,000 protestors
  gathered at the city’s capitol in a show of defiance. Videos and photos on
  social media showed protestors holding various signs that read: “Abbott is a
  vote thief,” referring to the state’s Republican governor and “Fight the Trump
  takeover.” Others chanted in a rally, yelling: “Shame on Abbott” and “The
  people, united, will never be divided.” Speakers at the rally in Austin
  included the 95-year-old labor activist Dolores Huerta, Texas congressman Greg
  Casar and former congressman Beto O’Rourke. “Texas House Democrats are
  blocking a redistricting vote in the Texas House right now to Stop the Trump
  Takeover,” a website for the protests says. “But Trump has made it clear that
  he’s not stopping at Texas. He’s targeting Missouri, Ohio, Florida and every
  state he can twist to help him steal Congress.” The protests came as Texas
  Republicans are considering a mid-decade redistricting plan at Donald Trump’s
  request that would add five additional Republican House seats to the red
  state. In response Democratic lawmakers have left the state in protest,
  depriving the statehouse of a quorum needed to move its plans ahead. “Though
  this fight started in Texas, it doesn’t end here,” Drucilla Tigner, executive
  director of Texas For All, said in a statement. “This isn’t just about
  redistricting or one state’s politics. It’s about the future of our
  democracy.” Before the rally, O’Rourke wrote on X: “Thanks to everyone who has
  joined us in this fight for Texas, we’ve been able to donate over $1 MILLION
  to the Texas Legislative Black Caucus, the Texas House Democratic Caucus, and
  the Mexican American Legislative Caucus during the special session.” On
  Thursday, the Democratic governor of California, Gavin Newsom, announced
  Democrats there would move ahead with a plan to redistrict the blue state in
  response to Texas’s effort. But, Newsom said, the plan for new California maps
  would only take effect if Texas or other red states pushed ahead with their
  own plans for partisan redistricting. Texas Democrats said on Thursday that
  they would return to the state after a nearly two-week absence if certain
  conditions were met, including Republicans ending their special session and
  California introducing its new map that would add five Democratic seats to
  offset Texas’s proposal. “The incredible support we’re seeing – not just back
  home in Texas, but from Democrats, Republicans and independents across the
  country – proves this fight is bigger than any one state,” said congressman
  Gene Wu, chair of the Texas house Democrats. “We’re defending our entire
  country from the Trump takeover, and I’m honored to stand with every patriotic
  American who refuses to let extremists rig the system.” Major left-leaning
  organizations including Indivisible and MoveOn helped organize and support the
  protests, as is the Democratic National Committee. “Trump knows the only way
  he can hold the majority after his budget betrayal is by changing the rules in
  the middle of the game to avoid accountability for ripping healthcare and food
  away from millions of Americans,” the DNC chair, Ken Martin, told NBC News.
  Organizers used an approach they have honed in the second Trump administration
  – holding protests in places big and small to show that dissent against the
  administration exists in all corners of the country. Saturday’s protests also
  took place across the country, including in Washington DC where hundreds
  staged a demonstration outside the White House, carrying signs and banners
  that read: “No Kings in America Since 1776” and “Not Normal, Not American”. An
  April day of protest called “Hands Off” drew people to more than 1,000 sites.
  In June, as Trump held a military parade in Washington, millions turned out to
  more than 2,000 sites nationwide for “No Kings” protests. Other days of action
  themed around labor and immigrants rights and voting rights also brought out
  tens of thousands of people on weekdays. Planning is under way for another
  mass day of protest set for Labor Day, on 1 September.
