  A group of English-speaking hackers linked to the Marks &amp; Spencer
  cyber-attack has claimed responsibility for an attack on Jaguar Land Rover. A
  channel on the Telegram platform posted a screenshot of what appeared to be
  the carmaker’s internal IT systems, as well as a news article detailing the
  hack. The name of the Telegram channel is a combination of three English
  language speaking, or western-based, hacking groups known as Scattered Spider,
  Lapsus$ and ShinyHunters. Scattered Spider, a collective of teenage and
  twentysomething hackers, has been blamed for attacks this year on British
  retailers M&amp;S, Co-op and Harrods. Four people including three teenagers
  were arrested at UK addresses in July as part of an investigation into the
  retail cyber-attacks. Britain’s biggest carmaker halted production at key
  sites on Monday after admitting its manufacturing and retailing activities had
  been “severely disrupted” by a cyber-incident. It said there was no evidence
  that any customer data had been taken but had “proactively” shut down its
  systems and taken “immediate action to mitigate” the impact. JLR did not give
  more details about who was behind the incident, when it was discovered or how
  long it would take to recover from it. Car industry sources said the incident
  had severely affected its suppliers, which normally make regular deliveries of
  parts to its factories. These suppliers could lose tens of millions of pounds
  in sales because of the halt in production, they added. Aiden Sinnott, a
  security researcher at a UK cybersecurity firm, said one of the personas on
  the Telegram group, Rey, shared the same name as a member of Hellcat, the
  ransomware gang that claimed to have extracted data from JLR earlier this
  year. Sinnott said Hellcat fitted the same mould as Scattered Spider and
  ShinyHunters. “They speak English and they are keen on using social media
  channels,” he said, adding that Lapsus$ shared similar tactics and
  demographics as the Scattered Spider collective. The cyber-attack at JLR comes
  amid disruption from the impact of US tariffs and declining sales. The
  carmaker reported that underlying pre-tax profits fell by 49% to £351m in the
  three months to June, which included a period when the company temporarily
  paused exports to the US. In 2023 an 18-year-old from Oxford and part of the
  Lapsus$ hacking group, Arion Kurtaj, who is autistic, was sentenced to an
  indefinite hospital order after stealing 90 clips of the unreleased Grand
  Theft Auto 6 game as part of a hacking spree. Describing ShinyHunters and
  Scattered Spider, Sinnott said: “Consolidating them into a group is difficult
  because they are essentially individuals operating online, communicating via
  platforms like Telegram, who might sometimes work together.” Sinnott said
  Scattered Spider was an “umbrella term for a kind of demographic” of hackers
  in their late teens or early 20s who are native English speaking and “don’t
  really fit into a box as a structure hierarchy”. Traditionally, groups that
  deploy ransomware – malicious software that locks up a target’s IT systems –
  are linked to eastern Europe and former Soviet Union countries including
  Russia. The ShinyHunters group also has French links. Sebastien Raoult, a
  French man in his early 20s, was sentenced to three years in prison in the US
  last year for his activities as a ShinyHunters member. The Telegraph first
  reported the activity on the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters group. A spokesperson
  for the National Crime Agency said: “We are aware of an incident impacting
  Jaguar Land Rover and are working with partners to better understand its
  impact.” The carmaker, which is headquartered in Coventry, employs 32,800
  people in the UK across 17 different sites. JLR has been contacted for
  comment.
