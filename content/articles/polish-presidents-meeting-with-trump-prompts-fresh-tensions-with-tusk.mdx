  Poland’s conservative nationalist president is due to meet Donald Trump at the
  White House in a visit that has prompted fresh tensions with the nation’s
  pro-European government led by Donald Tusk. Backed by the populist rightwing
  opposition Law and Justice party, which ruled Poland between 2015 and 2023,
  Karol Nawrocki unexpectedly won Poland’s presidential election after running a
  campaign under a Trumpesque slogan of “Poland first, Poles first”. The
  historian turned politician had met the US president before the election,
  securing his highly prized endorsement and presenting himself as someone who
  could safeguard Poland’s interests with the conservative US administration.
  When he won, Trump posted on Truth Social: “Such a great win in Poland by
  Karol Nawrocki. He will be a great president!” Nawrocki’s visit to the White
  House on Wednesday will be his first overseas trip since taking office last
  month, and the first serious test of his foreign policy credentials. He hosted
  a summit in Warsaw last week involving the leaders of Denmark, Estonia,
  Latvia, Lithuania and Ukraine, and spoke with other EU leaders by phone to
  prepare for the meeting, as he wants Poland to play a broader role in
  representing the region’s interests. His chief foreign policy adviser, Marcin
  Przydacz, told reporters on Tuesday that talks would “primarily concern
  security issues”, as he stressed that Poland – Nato’s top spender, for which
  it gets regular praise from Trump – wanted to “maintain the best possible
  relations with the Americans”. Nawrocki will also present Trump with the
  Polish view on the Ukraine war and his talks with the Russian president,
  Vladimir Putin, in Alaska, “pointing to the causes of this aggression and
  identifying the aggressor, the Russian Federation”, Przydacz said. But the
  visit has exacerbated tensions with Tusk, the centrist prime minister who was
  formerly president of the European Council. Nawrocki, a fierce critic of Tusk
  who has pledged to continue supporting Kyiv but opposes Ukraine’s membership
  in Nato and pushed for tightening the benefits paid out to Ukrainian refugees
  in Poland, signalled his intention to pursue a foreign policy independently of
  the government. Shortly before the Alaska summit between Trump and Putin, he
  joined a leaders’ phone call with the US president sidelining Tusk, who had
  previously represented Poland in similar discussions. Presidential aides said
  Nawrocki had got involved at Trump’s personal invitation. The move locked Tusk
  out of a prestigious call, reducing his role to participating in preparatory
  and debriefing calls with other European leaders instead. Poland subsequently
  skipped the high-level Zelenskyy-Trump meeting altogether, sending no
  representative to join the Ukrainian president and a group of European leaders
  at the White House, with both camps trading blame for the absence. The Polish
  president is also expected to stress to Trump the importance of keeping US
  forces in the region, with approximately 10,000 troops stationed in Poland and
  reports that the number may be under review. The meeting comes amid growing
  frustration on both sides of the Atlantic with what is seen as Russian
  attempts to obstruct efforts to end the war, with Trump repeating on Tuesday
  night he was “very disappointed” in Putin. Just hours before Trump and
  Nawrocki were to meet, Poland was forced to scramble its own and allied
  aircraft to monitor its airspace during another major night attack on Ukraine,
  with more than 500 strikes across the country. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy, who will take part in a meeting with Nordic and Baltic countries in
  Denmark on Wednesday, said Putin was “demonstrating his impunity”. The turf
  war between the Polish president and prime minister was brought back to the
  spotlight before the White House visit, after ministers repeatedly asked
  Nawrocki to toe the government’s line in his talks with Trump. The president’s
  aides responded by insisting the visit could instead be an opportunity for “a
  new opening” in relations, which they argued had been damaged by Tusk and his
  ministers’ past critical comments on Trump. As the row deepened, a one-page
  memo outlining the government’s advice for the president was leaked to the
  media. Presidential aides publicly ridiculed the document, describing it as
  “resembling a college essay”, and rejected the ministerial insistence on
  following their instructions as “impertinent”. Nawrocki also did not invite
  any government officials to join his delegation, breaking with a tradition
  that a junior minister would sit in the president’s meetings overseas.
  Przydacz said he would instead send a memo to inform the government of any
  developments. Despite Nawrocki’s meeting with Trump on Wednesday, Tusk said he
  would be representing Poland during a hybrid meeting of the “coalition of the
  willing” on Thursday. The internal divisions could weaken the country’s
  influential role in shaping Europe’s response to Russia’s full-scale invasion
  of Ukraine, after it welcomed more than a million Ukrainian refugees and
  turned into a major logistics hub for military and humanitarian aid deliveries
  for the war-torn neighbour.
