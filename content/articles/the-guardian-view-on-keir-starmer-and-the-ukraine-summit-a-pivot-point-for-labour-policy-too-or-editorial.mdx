  The Guardian view on Keir Starmer and the Ukraine summit: a pivot point for
  Labour policy too | Editorial

  The aim of Thursday’s Downing Street meeting between Sir Keir Starmer and
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy could not have been clearer. It was to send a strong
  visual political message to President Trump on the eve of his Alaska talks
  with Vladimir Putin. Neither the prime minister nor Ukraine’s president spoke
  publicly. The Ukraine leader was greeted with a hug and a handshake. The two
  men then talked in private by a vase of sunflowers, Ukraine’s national flower.
  So much is at stake in Ukraine and so great is the urgency that European
  leaders have moved fast and determinedly this week – not something one can
  often say. The aim is to remind Mr Trump that Europe stands with Ukraine
  against Russia. The solidarity has been well choreographed – and tightly
  scripted. No leader has said anything that might provoke Mr Trump. Whether the
  US president will take any notice, let alone serious notice, is something
  else. That will only become clear in and after Alaska. Whatever the outcome,
  this is a pivotal moment not just for Europe but for Sir Keir’s foreign policy
  approach – and his domestic policies too. In the year and more since he became
  prime minister, Sir Keir has been faced with huge global challenges in
  Ukraine, the Middle East, and in relations with the United States. These have
  occupied an enormous amount of his focus. They have been issues which play to
  his strengths. But, judging by the opinion polls, it has not impressed the
  public. The Alaska summit will shed some light on whether this effort has been
  worth it in terms of Ukraine’s independence and the threat from Russia. But it
  will also be pivotal because the government is currently being so heavily
  stress-tested at home on major issues ranging from the economy to migration
  and the welfare state. Foreign and domestic policy may once have been
  conveniently – if not wholly – separable problems. In the interconnected,
  technologically driven world of today, the two things are umbilically
  connected. In his national security strategy, published in June, Sir Keir
  acknowledged this. He called ours “an era of radical uncertainty”. It must, he
  said, be navigated with “agility, speed and a clear-eyed sense of the national
  interest”. This meant, he continued, that foreign policy must answer to “the
  concerns of working people”. Wars drive up their bills. Cyber-attacks
  undermine their public services. Criminals smuggle illegal migrants across
  borders. Higher living standards must therefore become a national security
  goal. The need, he concluded, is “to bring foreign and domestic policy
  together”. This may sound sensible. The problem is that it has not been done,
  let alone with political agility. Policies do not become unified just because
  someone, even the prime minister, decrees that they should be. A government
  has to choose how best to unify them. This is where Sir Keir is currently
  failing. When he says the overriding European security need is to invest in
  collective defence, he is right. But the current consequence for the working
  people whose interests Sir Keir places at the centre of his strategy is that
  their bills are higher and their welfare and spending programmes are reined in
  to help pay for it. This either-or approach is proving disastrous. It has
  prepared a path for Reform UK’s closed-door, Britain-first promises. This has
  to change. Sir Keir needs to start changing either-or into its alternative –
  and prioritise both defence and higher living standards.
