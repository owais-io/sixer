  The writer Matthew Barry and director Ashley Way gave us one of the highlights
  of 2023’s television output in Men Up, a witty, moving, compassionate treat of
  a drama about the development of the drug that would become known as Viagra
  and the group of Welshmen who were among its first guinea pigs. Their new
  offering is a more straightforward one, and if it doesn’t achieve the same
  success Men Up did, they can hardly be condemned for having set their bar so
  high. The Guest is a fast, furious, preposterous thriller of the kind that you
  can only pull off if everyone involved in its creation and consumption
  approaches it without an ounce of cynicism. Barry, Way and the high-calibre
  cast hold up their end of the bargain, delivering bags of propulsive plot.
  Viewers must hold up theirs via uncritical acceptance of the multiple twists,
  and bring along enough metaphorical or actual popcorn for the ride. Thus will
  happiness ensue as we embark on the tale of young have-not Ria (Gabrielle
  Creevy, in a really fine performance that does much to prevent the whole thing
  flying off the rails). She is working as a cleaner for various horrible people
  who fire her as soon as someone cheaper comes along (“If you’re going to be
  funny about it, let’s just call it a day, shall we?”), supporting Lee (Sion
  Daniel Young), the deadbeat boyfriend she has had since school, and stealing
  food so she can pay their rent on a grim illegal sublet while he complains
  about the lack of jobs. Into this unrewarding life arrives Fran (Eve Myles), a
  rich, self-made businesswoman and apparent fairy godmother. She offers Ria a
  four-day-a-week cleaning job at her luxurious mansion for decent wages and
  gives her inspirational speeches, which stir the longings and ambitions in Ria
  that have lain dormant since her mother died while Ria was still at school. Of
  course, Fran could be all benevolence, but a glimpse of a shadowy figure in
  the supposedly empty guesthouse, and the ominous strings scoring every scene
  Fran is in, tell the astute watcher otherwise, even before the aged gardener,
  Derek (Clive Russell), tells her to get out of there while she still can. It’s
  probably his memory going, though. It’s almost certainly nothing to do with
  the permanently locked room in the mansion, the imports Mr Fran is constantly
  sourcing abroad and sending home, or Fran having an affair with Derek’s son.
  Nor dropping hints about domestic violence or insisting that her childlessness
  is a happy choice she made so that she and her unsettling husband could
  concentrate on the business. Soon, Fran is offering her more money, more
  responsibility, more inspirational speeches, more clothes from her wardrobe,
  giving her pills from her stash and installing Ria in the guesthouse. She also
  encourages her protege to join dating apps to see what improvements Ria can
  make on the boyfriend situation now that Fran has shown her what she’s truly
  worth. A guy called Mike Rice (Joseph Ollman) seems nice! Not that Ria is a
  sap. She has an instinct for self-preservation (quietly whipping out her phone
  to record Fran and her lover shagging in the kitchen, though this may just be
  a reminder to double-Dettol the place rather than as future blackmail
  material) and enough smarts to keep her from being the kind of heroine you
  find yourself shouting at in frustration. With a sense of glorious
  inevitability, we move into a world of broken banisters and bodies, Instagram
  clues, police suspicions, hidden diaries, rolls of ready cash and more, while
  Fran and Ria’s relationship grows more twisted, more intense. The question of
  quite how dangerous it is to know each of them becomes more pressing. Oh, I
  almost forgot (I’m sorry – there is a lot going on)! What of the previous
  cleaner, Anna, who was also promoted to Fran’s assistant, given a makeover,
  supplied with lots of pills and installed in the guesthouse? Why would anyone
  give that cushy number up? I’m sure there is not a reasonable explanation, and
  you will be too if you’ve gone into this with the right attitude, as
  recommended above. All four ridiculous, well-played, well-paced episodes slip
  down a treat. There’s nothing hugely earth-shattering or innovative here –
  apart from the sheer volume of plot contained therein – but you will have fun.
  That much I promise you. • The Guest aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now in
  the UK and will be on Netflix in Australia on 24 September.
