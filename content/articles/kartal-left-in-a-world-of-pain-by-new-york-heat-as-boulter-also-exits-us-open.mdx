  Sonay Kartal vowed to come back stronger after her 6-3, 1-6, 6-1 defeat by the
  18th seed Beatriz Haddad Maia in the first round of the US Open after
  struggling with excruciating full-body cramps in warm conditions on Tuesday
  afternoon in New York. For much of her main‑draw debut at the US Open, Kartal
  battled admirably, showing her problem‑solving abilities by recovering from a
  tough opening set to force a decider. But towards the end of the second set
  Kartal began to struggle physically and by early in the final set she was
  cramping all over her body. The match took another turn deep in the final set
  as Haddad Maia also began to struggle, culminating in the Brazilian patting
  serves into the court and throwing in an underarm serve in a dramatic final
  game. “It’s frustrating,” Kartal said. “You can see her at the other end and
  she had a calf thing or a hamstring or something went. So it made it even
  tougher. But I think at that point you’re just in so much pain, you go into
  the dark places to try and get through. I wasn’t thinking about her or
  anything. I was just thinking: ‘I’m going to finish the match. I’m not going
  to call it quits.’” Asked exactly where she was cramping, Kartal said: “Where
  wasn’t I feeling it? We had calves, we had quads, we had hamstrings, and we
  had the fingers [clamped down] on the tennis racket. You feel helpless on
  court. My body didn’t let me finish it how I wanted to feel it.” Katie
  Boulter, meanwhile, stressed the need get to the bottom of her serving issues
  after her difficult run of form continued with a 6-4, 6-4 defeat against the
  27th seed Marta Kostyuk. “I’ve reached a point now that something needs to
  change,” Boulter said. “It’s not that I haven’t been doing anything to change
  it, but something different needs to happen for me to be able to mentally step
  up to the line and be ready. I feel like I’m doing a decent job on ball three
  considering the serves that I’m putting in the court.” Boulter has lost six of
  her past seven matches, dating back to a torrid second-round defeat at
  Wimbledon against Solana Sierra, a lucky loser. Boulter, who struck eight
  double faults with many occurring on key points, said considerable effort has
  already gone into her serve. “In terms of rhythm, how long I’ve struggled with
  it, I’ve had multiple shoulder injuries. I’ve had multiple arm injuries. I’m
  not a clean slate going into my career. I’ve had multiple things that have
  changed over time, my service motion, my service action, everything because of
  that. So, of course I have to adapt, and that’s one of the biggest things in
  tennis, so I need to get better at that.” The tough losses continued for
  British players as Fran Jones, a qualifier, was defeated 6-0, 7-5 by Eva Lys
  and despite putting up a strong fight, Billy Harris was beaten 6-4, 7-6 (8),
  6-4 by the 25th seed, Felix Auger Aliassime. On a day during which Iga Swiatek
  continued her tremendous recent form with a ruthless first-round win, the
  tournament favourite was most satisfied with developments away from the court.
  Moments after she departed Arthur Ashe Stadium with her 6-1, 6-2 win against
  Emiliana Arango, before they could discuss her performance at length, members
  of Swiatek’s team told her that Taylor Swift, her favourite artist, had
  announced her engagement to Travis Kelce. “She posted when I finished,”
  Swiatek said, smiling. “Maybe that’s not a coincidence. I don’t know.” The
  subject of Swift took up nearly half of Swiatek’s post-match press conference
  and, when a journalist attempted to change the subject to tennis, Swiatek
  jokingly pretended to stand up and leave. Those scenes are relevant to her
  success on court. Not only is Swiatek playing quality tennis, she appears to
  be relaxed and in a positive frame of mind away from it. Her victories at
  Wimbledon and Cincinnati imbued her with confidence going into the final grand
  slam tournament of the season. “Every year is kind of tough, because New York
  is just so loud, you know, and it’s hard to find that balance off the court,”
  Swiatek said. “But I’ve got to say I’m probably good at it compared to other
  players, so I’m really trying to be in my bubble. “The comfort level, it’s
  hard to describe, because the tournament is so long. You basically are here
  for three weeks. So obviously it’s not going to be the same every day. I feel
  pretty happy with my performance in Cincinnati and trying to get, you know,
  some confidence from that. There are a lot of positive vibes in the team, so
  it’s all good.” Swiatek was joined in the second round by another tournament
  favourite at Flushing Meadows as Jannik Sinner, the men’s top seed, defeated
  Vit Kopriva 6-1, 6-1, 6-2 to advance with ease. Sinner’s last competitive
  appearance turned into a painful afternoon as he was forced to retire in the
  first set of the Cincinnati Open final against his great rival Carlos Alcaraz
  because of illness. After resting for a week, the world No 1 looked in fine
  form at the beginning of his title defence.
