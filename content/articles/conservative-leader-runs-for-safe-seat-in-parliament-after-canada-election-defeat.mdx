  Canada’s federal conservative leader will have a second chance of winning a
  seat in parliament when residents of a rural Alberta district cast their
  ballots in a closely watched byelection on Monday. Pierre Poilievre’s bid to
  take the safe seat of Battle River-Crowfoot comes four months after the
  Conservatives’ defeat in April’s federal election, in which the party leader
  lost the riding he had held for more than 20 years. It was an unexpected blow
  for the 45-year-old career politician who, before the election was upended by
  Donald Trump’s threats to annex Canada, had been widely expected to become the
  country’s next prime minister. Despite Poilievre’s defeat, the Conservatives
  did, however, win enough seats to form the largest official opposition in
  Canadian history at the expense of other opposition parties. But without a
  seat in the House of Commons, Poilievre has been unable to serve as leader of
  the official opposition, hampering his ability to attack the Liberal
  government of prime minister Mark Carney. Conservative MP Damien Kurek, a
  three-time lawmaker, took Battle River-Crowfoot with nearly 83% of the vote in
  April, but stood down in June to allow Poilievre to run. Because of the
  federal implications of the vote, the byelection has been overshadowed by a
  protest movement calling for electoral reform, plunging what might have been a
  routine vote into chaos and uncertainty. Members of the Longest Ballot
  Committee have coaxed 203 candidates to add their names the roster, in protest
  of what they see as poorly structured electoral rules. For the first time,
  Elections Canada will be requiring voters to fill out a blank ballot with the
  name of their preferred candidate, instead of printing thousands of metre-long
  ballots. Elections Canada says votes will be counted even if the voter
  misspells the candidate’s name. The Longest Ballot Committee did something
  similar in April, when it put 90 candidates on the list in Poilievre’s
  Ottawa-area riding, dramatically slowing down the vote count. “If I were one
  of the 53,684 people in Battle River-Crowfoot who voted for Mr Kurek, I would
  be angry right now. I would be wondering why someone who had received my vote
  in three elections would suddenly abandon his position as a member of
  Parliament for a job as a lobbyist,” Barry Rueger, who is among the 214
  candidates contesting the vote, wrote in a piece for the Globe and Mail. “And
  I’d be wondering how a candidate who had just been defeated in his own riding
  in Ontario was supposed to understand my needs, and fill the role of a rural
  Alberta MP.”
