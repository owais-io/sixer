  The University of Melbourne (UoM) breached Victoria’s Privacy and Data
  Protection Act when it used its wifi network to surveil students and staff
  holding a pro-Palestine protest last May, which could have resulted in a
  “significant breach of trust”, the state’s deputy information commissioner has
  found. The investigation, released on Wednesday, was prompted by media reports
  alleging UoM digitally tracked people at the sit-in to uncover potential
  misconduct. The deputy commissioner found the university used a combination of
  wifi location data, student card photographs and CCTV footage to identify 22
  students who failed to comply with orders to leave the university’s Arts West
  building on 20 May. The investigation found the university did not give
  adequate notice or justification for how the data would be used. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email It took less than a day for the university to authorise
  the use of data for surveillance purposes and only “superficial” consideration
  was given to privacy protection, the report found. The UoM used analysis of
  wifi location data, CCTV footage, and a review of 10 staff members’ email
  accounts to identify staff involved in the protest, the report found. As a
  result, three staff members received formal written warnings. Misconduct
  proceedings were brought against 20 of the students, with 19 receiving a
  “reprimand and caution”. The deputy commissioner found the UoM had not
  contravened information privacy principles (IPPs) in the state’s Privacy and
  Data Protection Act with its CCTV footage use. But it found the UoM had
  breached two IPPs by failing to adequately inform students and staff about how
  their personal information had been used, and because using wifi location data
  to identify individuals in a misconduct investigation was an unauthorised
  reason. It also found that the university’s accessing of staff email accounts
  for disciplinary proceedings “fell below the standard” expected. “The
  university failed to obtain a social licence for the use of this technology,”
  the report found. “Because the collection and use of the data involved the
  surveillance of students and staff, and surveillance by its nature is
  antithetical to human rights, the breach was serious.” The deputy commissioner
  did not issue a compliance notice because of the remedial steps taken by the
  UoM during the investigation, including developing a new surveillance policy
  and amending its terms of use and associated policies. The chief operating
  officer of the UoM, Katerina Kapobassis, said the university acknowledged it
  could have provided “clearer active notice” to students and staff about its
  use of wifi location data. “However, we maintain that the use of Wi-Fi
  location data in student misconduct cases was reasonable and proportionate in
  the circumstances, given the overriding need to keep our community safe and
  conduct our core activities of teaching, learning and research,” she said.
  “The university takes its privacy obligations seriously and has cooperated
  openly and responsively to the deputy commissioner in the conduct of her
  investigation. “The university has already completed a number of actions that
  are proposed in the final report, and all others are progressing.” The
  investigation also found the university’s wifi terms of use, IT policies and
  privacy statements were “poorly presented, contained misleading headings and
  titles, and contained information that made the purpose of collection and use
  unclear”. “The extent of the impact on the individuals whose Wi-Fi location
  data was used to determine their physical whereabouts was significant,” the
  report found. “Each was subjected to a form of surveillance … They are likely
  to have experienced a significant breach of trust. “The deputy commissioner
  remains concerned by the university’s practices … and will continue to seek
  evidence and assurance that it has completed the actions it has agreed to.”
  The Unimelb for Palestine group welcomed the investigation’s findings, which
  it said exposed the “deep structural failures in how the university governs
  data, communicates … and respects fundamental human rights”. The group said it
  found the decision not to issue a compliance notice “deeply disappointing”.
  “The report does not undo the harm the university has inflicted – through both
  its past mishandling of misconduct proceedings against Mahmoud’s Hall [Arts
  West] protesters, and its ongoing efforts to expel and suspend other student
  protesters based on unauthorised and unlawfully obtained data,” the group
  said. “So-called liberal institutions – including the UoM - have acted
  exceptionally to suppress solidarity with Palestine amidst a genocide.” In
  April, the Human Rights Law Centre, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty
  International wrote to the UoM’s vice chancellor, citing serious concerns over
  its wifi policy, which they said permitted the surveillance of all users
  without suspicion of wrongdoing or misuse of the network. Principal lawyer
  Berndaette Zaydan is appealing the suspensions and expulsions of UoM student
  protestors and said she would use the findings to strengthen their legal
  fight. The UoM branch president of the National Tertiary Education Union,
  David Gonzalez, said the deputy commissioner had reinforced what staff had
  been saying “all along”, that “they were misusing this information, and it was
  wrong”. “There was never an expectation that we would be tracked using Wi-Fi
  previously,” Gonzalez, who sat in on disciplinary proceedings with staff as a
  result of the protest, said. “A large amount of my members are very concerned
  with their privacy. This is validating for a lot of people who felt gaslit …
  It’s just an erosion of trust.”
