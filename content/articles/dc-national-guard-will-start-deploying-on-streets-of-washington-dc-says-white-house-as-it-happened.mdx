  Our live coverage is ending now. In the meantime, you can find all of our live
  US politics coverage here. Here is a summary of the key developments from
  today: The DC national guard will begin deploying on the city’s streets
  Tuesday night, the White House confirmed to the Guardian, a day after Donald
  Trump ordered their arrival and took control of the city’s police force,
  calling Washington DC a “lawless” city, despite official crime statistics
  saying otherwise. A White House official told the Washington Post that the
  national guard is expected to “begin being on the streets starting tonight”.
  Defense officials said a small number of the roughly 800 guard members planned
  for the mission had already been mobilized by Tuesday afternoon, with more
  expected to arrive in the coming days. About 850 officers and agents took part
  in a “massive law enforcement surge” across Washington DC on Monday night and
  made nearly two dozen arrests, the White House has said. The show of force
  came after Donald Trump announced he was sending the national guard into the
  capital and putting city police under federal control, even though the violent
  crime rate is at a 30-year low. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt told
  reporters on Tuesday: “As part of the president’s massive law enforcement
  surge, last night approximately 850 officers and agents were surged across the
  city. They made a total of 23 arrests, including multiple other contacts.” A
  federal judge ordered the Trump administration to immediately improve
  conditions at a New York City immigration holding facility, acting on mounting
  complaints from detainees that the cells are overcrowded, unsanitary and
  inhumane. Judge Lewis A Kaplan issued a temporary restraining order requiring
  US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) to limit capacity, ensure
  cleanliness and provide sleeping mats, beds, toiletries and access to
  attorneys for migrants held in holding rooms at 26 Federal Plaza, a government
  building in lower Manhattan. The Texas Senate approved a GOP-drawn
  congressional map that would give Republicans five more House seats ahead of
  the 2026 midterms. But since House Democrats continue to break quorum, the
  legislation isn’t going anywhere. Speaker Dustin Burrows said today that the
  House will adjourn until Friday 15 August, at which point the legislature will
  attempt to reach quorum one more time. If this fails they will move to end
  this month’s first special session days early, and Texas governor Greg Abbott
  will immediately call a second. California governor Gavin Newsom says the
  state will draw new electoral maps after Donald Trump “missed” a deadline on
  Tuesday night in an ongoing redistricting battle between Democratic and
  Republican states. Several states have waded into the redistricting wars,
  where Newsom and other Democratic state leaders had threatened to draw
  retaliatory maps if Texas were to move ahead with its redistricting scheme.
  The Trump administration is evidently extending its control of cultural
  representation at the Smithsonian, the world’s largest museum and research
  complex. In a letter posted on the White House website, the administration
  told the Smithsonian that it plans a wide review of exhibitions, materials and
  operations ahead of the US’s 250th anniversary celebrations in 2026. The press
  secretary Karoline Leavitt characterised Friday’s upcoming meeting between
  Trump and Vladimir Putin as a “listening exercise” for the president,
  confirming that Volodymyr Zelenskyy would not be in attendance, but the
  president has hopes for a trilateral meeting in the future. Zelenskyy said
  today that Ukraine could not agree to a Russian proposal to give up more of
  his country’s territory in exchange for a ceasefire, because Moscow would use
  it as a springboard to start a future war. Speaking to journalists a day
  before a virtual meeting with US and European leaders, Zelenskyy said he
  believed Putin wanted to dominate his country because he “does not want a
  sovereign Ukraine”. The latest inflation data released today showed that the
  Consumer Price Index held steady at 2.7 percent. “Core” inflation – which
  leaves out volatile goods like food and energy to track how prices are
  increasing – rose by 0.3 percent. This marks a 3.1 percent increase over the
  course of a year – and the highest level in five months. In response, Donald
  Trump wasted no time calling out Jerome Powell on social media, continuing his
  long-running campaign against the chair of the Federal Reserve. “The damage he
  has done by always being Too Late is incalculable,” the president wrote. He
  also said that he was considering allowing a lawsuit – focused on Powell’s
  renovation of the fed’s headquarters– to proceed. The New York Times reports
  that national guard troops have left the area of the Washington Monument,
  about two hours after they arrived. “We just did a presence patrol to be
  amongst the people, to be seen,” master Sgt Cory Boroff told reporter Nicholas
  Bogel-Burroughs. Boroff said he did not know where the troops would be headed
  next. The US government’s gross national debt has climbed past $37tn, a record
  milestone that points to the rapid growth of federal borrowing and the
  mounting cost burden for taxpayers. According to the treasury department’s
  latest report, released today, the debt reached this level years earlier than
  expected. In January 2020, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
  projected that gross federal debt would not top $37tn until after fiscal year
  2030. The faster-than-anticipated increase stems largely from the economic
  fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic, which shut down much of the country’s
  economy. In response, the federal government took on massive borrowing to
  stabilize the economy and aid recovery efforts. The treasury department’s
  report comes just weeks after the CBO estimated that Trump’s new tax bill will
  add $3.4tn to the national debt over the next decade. Reuters is reporting
  that the Trump administration’s flagship Golden Dome missile defense system
  will include four layers – one satellite-based and three on land – with 11
  short-range batteries located across the continental US, Alaska and Hawaii. A
  US government slide presentation on the project showed slides tagged “Go Fast,
  Think Big!”. They were presented to 3,000 defense contractors in Huntsville,
  Alabama, last week and reveal the unprecedented complexity of the system,
  which faces an ambitious 2028 deadline set by Donald Trump. The system is
  estimated to cost $175bn, but the slides show uncertainties still loom over
  the basic architecture of the project because the number of launchers,
  interceptors, ground stations, and missile sites needed for the system has yet
  to be determined. “They have a lot of money, but they don’t have a target of
  what it costs yet,” a US official told the news wire. So far Congress has
  appropriated $25bn for Golden Dome in Trump’s tax-and-spend bill passed in
  July. Another $45.3bn is earmarked for Golden Dome in his 2026 presidential
  budget request. California governor Gavin Newsom kept taking a jab at
  President Donald Trump on X today, announcing a “BIG PRESS CONFERENCE” this
  week with “POWERFUL DEMS AND GAVIN NEWSOM” as the ongoing redistricting battle
  between Democratic and Republican states ensues. “DONALD ‘TACO’ TRUMP, AS MANY
  CALL HIM, ‘MISSED’ THE DEADLINE!!!”, Newsom’s office wrote on X. “CALIFORNIA
  WILL NOW DRAW NEW, MORE ‘BEAUTIFUL MAPS,’ THEY WILL BE HISTORIC AS THEY WILL
  END THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY (DEMS TAKE BACK THE HOUSE!)”. “BIG PRESS CONFERENCE
  THIS WEEK WITH POWERFUL DEMS AND GAVIN NEWSOM — YOUR FAVORITE GOVERNOR — THAT
  WILL BE DEVASTATING FOR ‘MAGA.’ THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER! —
  GN,” reads the post on the social media platform. The post follows a series of
  snarky, all-caps tweets meant to mimic Trump’s social media style. Newsom was
  mocking Trump’s moniker, “TACO”, short for “Trump Always Chickens Out”,
  prompted by his flip-flopping deadlines. The DC national guard will begin
  deploying on the city’s streets Tuesday night, the White House confirmed to
  the Guardian, a day after Donald Trump ordered their arrival and took control
  of the city’s police force, calling Washington DC a “lawless” city, despite
  official crime statistics saying otherwise. A White House official told the
  Washington Post that the national guard is expected to “begin being on the
  streets starting tonight”. Defense officials said a small number of the
  roughly 800 guard members planned for the mission had already been mobilized
  by Tuesday afternoon, with more expected to arrive in the coming days. The New
  York Times reports that about a dozen national guard members have appeared in
  five military vehicles across from the Washington Monument. Earlier today, DC
  mayor Muriel Bowser said she expected members of the national guard to be
  deployed on federal property in the nation’s capital. “My expectation, though
  it can change, is that they will deploy the guard on federal properties, that
  includes parks, monuments, federal buildings,” Bowser said on a community chat
  on X. Following the increase in tariffs by the US on Brazilian imports (from
  10% to 50% earlier this month), Brazil’s president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva
  announced that his government will provide 30 billion reais ($5.55bn) in
  credit to support exporters affected by the steeper levies. In an interview
  with local news outlet BandNews, Lula said this initial package will also
  include support through government purchases. Some Brazilian products,
  including orange juice and aircraft, were exempted from the recent US tariff
  increase. This boost comes as Lula has remained in the public eye for his
  fierce criticism of Donald Trump’s tariffs, which the Brazilian president sees
  as a political move interfering with Brazil’s sovereignty, especially since
  the tariffs are linked to ongoing legal proceedings against former Brazilian
  president Jair Bolsonaro, often described as the “Trump of the tropics”.
  Donald Trump’s administration has significantly changed a key US government
  report on human rights worldwide, dramatically softening criticism of some
  countries that have been strong partners of the Republican president, such as
  El Salvador and Israel, which rights groups say have well-established
  histories of abuses. Instead, the US state department sounded an alarm about
  what it said was the erosion of freedom of speech in Europe and ramped up
  criticism of Brazil and South Africa – both of which Washington has clashed
  with over a host of issues. Criticism of governments over their treatment of
  LGBTQ+ rights, which appeared in Biden administration editions of the report,
  appeared to have been largely omitted. Washington referred to Russia’s
  invasion of Ukraine mainly as the “Russia-Ukraine war”. The report’s section
  on Israel was much shorter than last year’s edition and contained no mention
  of the severe humanitarian crisis or death toll in Gaza. About 61,000 people
  have died, according to the Gaza health ministry, as a result of Israel’s
  military operations in response to an attack by Hamas in October 2023. The
  report was delayed for months as Trump appointees altered an earlier state
  department draft dramatically to bring it in line with “America First” values,
  according to government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. The
  report introduced new categories such as “Life”, “Liberty” and “Security of
  the Person”. Read the full story here: The Georgia Bureau of Investigation
  confirmed today that the man who opened fire at the Centers for Disease
  Control and Prevention (CDC) headquarters last week, killing a police officer,
  died by suicide. The shooter “died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound”, the
  bureau’s director, Chris Hosey, said at a news conference today. “Evidence in
  this event indicates that the shooter had recently verbalized thoughts of
  suicide, which even led to law enforcement being contacted several weeks prior
  to the incident,” Hosey said. The shooter has been identified by authorities
  as 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White. He had blamed the Covid-19 vaccine for
  making him depressed and suicidal, which has led the union representing CDC
  employees to demand that the federal government condemn vaccine
  misinformation. About 850 officers and agents took part in a “massive law
  enforcement surge” across Washington DC on Monday night and made nearly two
  dozen arrests, the White House has said. The show of force came after Donald
  Trump announced he was sending the national guard into the capital and putting
  city police under federal control, even though the violent crime rate is at a
  30-year low. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday: “As
  part of the president’s massive law enforcement surge, last night
  approximately 850 officers and agents were surged across the city. They made a
  total of 23 arrests, including multiple other contacts.” The arrests consisted
  of homicide, firearms offences, possession with intent to distribute
  narcotics, fare evasion, lewd acts and stalking, Leavitt added. “A total of
  six illegal handguns were seized off of District of Columbia’s streets as part
  of last night’s effort.” Read the full story here: A federal judge ordered the
  Trump administration to immediately improve conditions at a New York City
  immigration holding facility, acting on mounting complaints from detainees
  that the cells are overcrowded, unsanitary and inhumane. Judge Lewis A Kaplan
  issued a temporary restraining order requiring US Immigration and Customs
  Enforcement (Ice) to limit capacity, ensure cleanliness and provide sleeping
  mats, beds, toiletries and access to attorneys for migrants held in holding
  rooms at 26 Federal Plaza, a government building in lower Manhattan. The order
  follows a lawsuit filed last week by civil rights groups, including the
  American Civil Liberties Union and Make the Road New York, alleging that
  conditions in the holding rooms were “crowded, squalid and punitive”. In court
  filings, detainees said they were forced to sleep on the floor, sometimes in
  rooms with up to 100 people, without mattresses or padding, and were denied
  soap, toothbrushes, and other hygiene products. The Trump administration
  sanctioned an armed group accused of illegally trading minerals in eastern
  Congo, as Washington seeks to lead peace efforts in the region while securing
  US access to its mineral resources. A senior US government official told the
  AP that the state and treasury departments are targeting the Codeco armed
  group, which controlled the key coltan mining site of Rubaya from 2022 until
  early 2024. “During this period, Codeco generated revenue by overseeing mining
  operations, collecting illegal fees and taxes for miners and engaging in
  mineral smuggling. It also imposed forced labor and executed civilians in
  mining areas under its control,” the official said. The sanctions also target
  the Congolese mining company CDMC, accused of selling minerals sourced and
  smuggled from mines near Rubaya, as well as two Hong Kong exporters, East Rise
  and Star Dragon, that purchased minerals from the area. Mexico has transferred
  a group of imprisoned cartel members to the United States, amid growing
  pressure from the Trump administration to dismantle the country’s powerful
  drug organizations, the Wall Street Journal reported. The group, sent on
  Tuesday, was roughly the same size as the 29 prisoners transferred in
  February. WSJ reports: The group sent Tuesday included members of top criminal
  organizations facing drug charges in the US who are being sent to locations
  including Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia, San Diego and
  New York, one of the people said. Terry Cole, the Drug Enforcement
  Administration chief overseeing the federal takeover of DC police, said in an
  interview that, starting tonight, federal agents will be “embedded with the
  Metropolitan police department”. “You will see federal agents working hand in
  hand on patrol with the Metropolitan Police Department, you will also see an
  increase of activity, patrol activity in certain sectors to go after the
  violent criminal offenders that are the drivers of this crime,” Cole said in
  an interview with Fox News. Earlier today, Texas Senate Democrats staged a
  walkout in protest of the chamber’s proposed congressional redistricting map,
  which was moving forward to the Texas House. Despite the senators’ absence,
  the Republican-controlled Senate approved the map in a 19-2 vote. But it
  cannot win final approval while the quorum is broken. Texas House Democrats
  have been out of state for weeks to block Republican lawmakers from conducting
  business. Senate Democrats are challenging governor Greg Abbott’s decision to
  prioritize redistricting over urgent flood relief for the state’s affected
  communities. “This special session is about one thing: flood relief,” said
  Texas state senator Roland Gutierrez. “Greg Abbott tried to sneak in a rigged
  mid-decade redistricting beneath voters’ noses. Let’s be clear, the governor
  can provide this relief anytime he wants. But Abbott is holding it hostage so
  that he has an excuse to do Trump’s bidding.” “Texas has a long tradition of
  independence. But when Donald Trump tells Greg Abbott to roll over and fetch
  him five seats, he does it like a good lapdog,” Gutierrez added. “This
  governor has failed to uphold Texas values, defend the people of Texas, or
  make the lives of its citizens better in any meaningful way.” Democratic
  senators Judith Zaffirini and Chuy Hinojosa did not participate in today’s
  walkout and stayed in the chamber, according to the Dallas Morning News.
  Democratic representative Adam Smith, of the state of Washington, said it is
  “pretty clear” President Trump “wants his own domestic police force” after the
  president seized control of DC’s Metropolitan police department. “Look, this
  president is trampling on basic freedoms of the American people to a degree
  we, I don’t think we’ve ever seen,” Smith said on CNN. “You see that with what
  the ICE agents are doing, in terms of picking people up off the streets with
  no evidence, no due process, locking people up.” “This is happening all across
  the country,” Smith added. “Look, it’s pretty clear the president wants his
  own domestic police force, and step by step, he’s trying to create it, and we
  should be deeply alarmed by that, regardless of how you feel about crime in
  Washington DC, or any other city.” National guard troops began to arrive at
  their headquarters in Washington DC on Tuesday, after Donald Trump announced
  yesterday that he was deploying them to the nation’s capital and putting city
  police under federal control, even though the violent crime rate is at a
  30-year low. Leading Democrats have called the move a “distraction” from the
  president’s economic agenda and the plague of the Epstein files. Earlier, the
  DC mayor Muriel Bowser met with attorney general Pam Bondi, after saying that
  her office intends to comply with federal law enforcement, as Bondi will now
  oversee the DC police for the next 30 days. On social media, Bondi described
  the meeting as “productive”, saying the pair agreed there is “nothing more
  important” than keeping residents and tourists “safe from deadly crime”.
  Meanwhile in the White House briefing room today, press secretary Karoline
  Leavitt said the president’s DC police takeover was “just the beginning”,
  saying that the massive surge in law enforcement resulted in 23 arrests
  yesterday. She added that if individuals living in homeless encampments refuse
  to accept places in shelters or addiction facilities they would be subject to
  fines or jail time. Leavitt added that the administration is still considering
  moving the homeless population out of the city. Beyond Washington, the press
  secretary characterised Friday’s upcoming meeting between Trump and Vladimir
  Putin as a “listening exercise” for the president, confirming that Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy would not be in attendance, but the president has hopes for a
  trilateral meeting in the future. For his part, Zelenskyy said today that
  Ukraine could not agree to a Russian proposal to give up more of his country’s
  territory in exchange for a ceasefire, because Moscow would use it as a
  springboard to start a future war. Speaking to journalists a day before a
  virtual meeting with US and European leaders, Zelenskyy said he believed Putin
  wanted to dominate his country because he “does not want a sovereign Ukraine”.
  Closer to home, the Texas Sentate approved a GOP-drawn congressional map, that
  would give Republicans five more House seats ahead of the 2026 midterms. But
  since House Democrats continue to break quorum, the legislation isn’t going
  anywhere. Speaker Dustin Burrows said today that the House will adjourn until
  Friday 15 August, at which point the legislature will attempt to reach quorum
  one more time. If this fails they will move to end this month’s first special
  session days early, and Texas governor Greg Abbott will immediately call a
  second. When it comes to the economy, the latest inflation data released today
  showed that the Consumer Price Index held steady at 2.7 percent. “Core”
  inflation – which leaves out volatile goods like food and energy to track how
  prices are increasing – rose by 0.3 percent. This marks a 3.1 percent increase
  over the course of a year – and the highest level in five months. In response,
  Donald Trump wasted no time calling out Jerome Powell on social media,
  continuing his long-running campaign against the chair of the Federal Reserve.
  “The damage he has done by always being Too Late is incalculable,” the
  president wrote. He also said that he was considering allowing a lawsuit –
  focused on Powell’s renovation of the fed’s headquarters– to proceed. The New
  York Times is reporting that investigators have uncovered evidence that Russia
  is “at least in part” responsible for a recent hack of the computer system of
  the federal court system. According to the Times’s sources, this breach
  includes highly sensitive records that could contain information with names
  and details of people charged with national security crimes. The Times also
  reports that it’s not immediately clear what specific Russian entity might be
  responsible for the hack. Just a quick post here to sum up the latest analysis
  from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which breaks down the financial
  impact of Donald Trump’s domestic policy bill that became law last month. The
  topline: the CBO estimates that the poorest 10% of Americans can expect to
  lose around $1200 per year due to the restrictions and cut backs in the
  legislation – namely when it comes to Medicaid and Snap benefits. By contrast,
  the richest 10% of Americans can expect to gain around $13,600 each year, due
  to the extension of the president’s 2017 tax cuts. In response to
  Congressional Democratic leadership’s request for analysis on the distribution
  of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a letter from the CBO’s director noted that
  while, on average, American households can expect to see an increase in
  resources, this will not be evenly distributed. He writes: Resources will
  decrease for households toward the bottom of the income distribution, whereas
  resources will increase for households in the middle and toward the top of the
  income distribution. The Trump administration is evidently extending its
  control of cultural representation at the Smithsonian, the world’s largest
  museum and research complex. In a letter obtained by the Wall Street Journal,
  the White House told the Smithsonian that it plans a wide review of
  exhibitions, materials and operations ahead of the US’s 250th anniversary
  celebrations in 2026. The letter to Lonnie Bunch, the secretary of the
  Smithsonian Institution, from Trump administration officials said the White
  House wants the museums’ program to reflect “unity, progress, and enduring
  values that define the American story” in keeping with an executive order
  issued in March that ordered the elimination of “improper, divisive or
  anti-American ideology” from the Smithsonian and its museums. Donald Trump’s
  order from March, titled Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History, said
  the president “aims to ensure that the Smithsonian is an institution that
  sparks children’s imagination, celebrates American history and ingenuity,
  serves as a symbol to the world of American greatness, and makes America
  proud”. But Monday’s letter to the institution, according to the Journal,
  places the institution under curatorial scrutiny ranging from public-facing
  exhibition text and online content to internal curatorial processes,
  exhibition planning, the use of collections and artist grants. Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy has said Ukraine could not agree to a Russian proposal to give up
  more of his country’s territory in exchange for a ceasefire because Moscow
  would use what it gained as a springboard to start a future war. The Ukrainian
  president said he did not believe that Donald Trump supported Russia’s
  demands, and he expressed hope the US leader would act as an honest mediator
  when he meets Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday. He added there was no sign
  that Russia was preparing to implement a ceasefire, as reports emerged that
  small sabotage groups had pierced Ukrainian defences in the eastern Donbas,
  advancing about six miles in three days. Zelenskyy also warned that Russia was
  planning new offensives on three parts of the frontline. Speaking to
  journalists in the run-up to the Trump-Putin summit, and a day before a
  virtual meeting with US and European leaders, Zelenskyy said he believed Putin
  wanted to dominate his country because he “does not want a sovereign Ukraine”.
  Read more on the lead-up to both meetings here The Texas Sentate has passed a
  GOP-drawn congressional map, that would give Republicans five more House seats
  ahead of the 2026 midterms. The map passed 19-2 along party lines. Nine Senate
  Democrats left the floor in solidarity with their House colleagues – who broke
  quorum again earlier today in protest of the map. The legislation can’t
  advance without the absent Democrats in the lower chamber. Speaker Dustin
  Burrows said today that the House will adjourn until Friday 15 August, at
  which point the legislature will attempt to reach quorum one more time. If
  this fails they will move to end this month’s first special session days
  early, and Texas governor Greg Abbott will immediately call a second. “I’ll
  call special after special until the Texas first agenda is passed,” Abbott
  said in a post on X. The White House heralded today’s Consumer Price Index
  report as an clear picture of inflation remaining stable. But another notable
  exchange in the press briefing was a reporter’s question about why the public
  should trust the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ inflation data report, given the
  administration undermining the jobs data released earlier this month. This led
  to the firing of former commissioner Erika McEntarfer, and yesterday’s
  announcement that the president is nominating EJ Antoni, chief economist at
  the conservative Heritage Foundation, to replace her. Antoni is a longtime
  critic of the BLS. “The jobs data has had massive revisions,” Leavitt said,
  referring to the routine practice of issuing revisions to provide a more
  accurate picture of data. “We want to ensure that all of the data, the
  inflation data, the jobs data, any data point that is coming out of the BLS,
  is trustworthy and is accurate”. When asked in today’s press briefing, the
  White House offered little clarity on administration’s view of Benjamin
  Netanyahu’s Gaza City takeover. This is, of course, an incredibly complex and
  complicated situation. The administration has made our goal clear. We want to
  see this conflict end. We want to see the hostages released…the President and
  his national security team has given extensive effort and time in doing that.
  Speaking about what will happen to the homeless population in Washington DC,
  Leavitt cites city codes which would give individuals the “option to leave
  their encampment, to be taken to a homeless shelter to be offered addiction or
  mental health services”. If they refuse, Leavitt says, they will be
  “susceptible to fines or to jail time”. Leavitt also says that the
  administration is still considering moving the homeless population out of the
  city. Karoline Leavitt offers a limited preface to the president’s meeting
  with Russian president Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday. But she notes that
  Trump sees the meeting as a “listening exercise” because only one party is
  present. Leavitt also answered a question about why Ukrainian president
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy was not included in Friday’s meeting, despite calls from
  European leaders. She underscored that Putin called for this meeting, and “the
  goal of this meeting for the president is to walk away with a better
  understanding of how we can end this war”. Leavitt also reaffirmed Trump’s
  hopes for a trilateral meeting in the future. Leavitt is talking about the
  perception of crime in Washington DC. She is referring to polling that shows
  an increase in residents feeling that crime is a serious problem in the city.
  However, violent crime is on the decline at the moment, and reached a 30-year
  low last year. Leavitt is now addressing the president’s federal takeover of
  DC police, and the deployment of National Guard troops to the city. This is
  only the beginning. Over the course of the next month, the Trump
  administration will relentlessly pursue and arrest every violent criminal in
  the district who breaks the law undermines public safety and endangers law
  abiding Americans. Soon, we can expect the White House press secretary
  Karoline Leavitt to hold a briefing. We’ll bring you the latest as that gets
  going. Attorney general Pam Bondi said that her meeting with DC mayor Muriel
  Bowser was “productive” in a statement on X. “We agreed that there is nothing
  more important than keeping residents and tourists in Washington, D.C. safe
  from deadly crime,” she wrote. However, violent crime in the capital hit a
  record 30-year low in 2024. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton asked a local
  judge on Tuesday to consider jailing Beto O’Rourke, saying the former
  congressman was openly defying a judicial order blocking the former
  congressman and his political group from fundraising and paying the costs of
  Democrats who left the state to stop Republicans from passing a new
  congressional map. Tarrant County District Judge Megan Fahey granted a request
  from Paxton last week halting O’Rourke and a group aligned with him, Powered
  by People, from fundraising. In his Tuesday, filing, Paxton said O’Rourke had
  continued to fundraise after Fahey’s ruling, pointing to a tweet soliciting
  donations on ActBlue and requests to donate during a rally in Fort Worth last
  week. Paxton requested O’Rourke be fined $500 for each instance in which he
  defied the court’s order and “be confined to jail unless and until he
  demonstrates a willingness to abide by the Court’s orders pending the outcome
  of this lawsuit.” A US appeals court has rejected a bid by a group of unions
  to block the Trump administration’s government downsizing team, the
  “department of government efficiency” (Doge), from accessing sensitive data on
  Americans. The Virginia-based fourth US circuit court of appeals in a 2-1
  decision said the unions were unlikely to prevail on claims that Doge would
  violate federal privacy laws by accessing data at the US Department of
  Education, treasury department, and Office of Personnel Management. The court
  refused to block Doge access to the agencies’ computer systems and data such
  as social security numbers and individuals’ citizenship status pending the
  outcome of the case. The decision reverses a temporary injunction issued by a
  federal judge in Maryland, which had been paused by the appeals court in
  April. The agencies involved in the case and the unions that sued, which
  include the American Federation of Teachers and the National Federation of
  Federal Employees, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The
  4th circuit today said the unions that sued along with a group of military
  veterans had not shown how they would be injured by Doge accessing agencies’
  computer systems. They also probably lacked legal standing to sue because that
  access is not a “final agency action” that can form the basis of a lawsuit,
  the court said. A dissenting judge said it was prudent to temporarily block
  access to the data while the case plays out, and that the standard his
  colleagues had imposed on the plaintiffs was too high. Per my last post, in
  the letter sent to university George Washington University president Ellen
  Granberg today, assistant attorney general Harmeet Dhillon said the justice
  department found members of the university community engaged in “antisemitic,
  disruptive protests”, including by establishing an encampment at University
  Yard. Dhillon said these efforts were meant to “frighten, intimidate, and
  deny” Jewish, Israeli, and American Israeli students access to the university
  environment. “The Department finds that despite actual notice of the abuses
  occurring on its campus, GWU was deliberately indifferent to the complaints it
  received, the misconduct that occurred, and the harms that were suffered,”
  Dhillon’s letter said. Dhillon said the justice department intends to proceed
  with enforcement, but is offering the university the opportunity to resolve
  the matter through a voluntary resolution agreement. The university has until
  22 August to indicate whether it has “interest in such a dialogue”, according
  to the letter. GWU is the latest university to be targeted by the Trump
  administration, which has threatened to cut federal funds for universities
  over pro-Palestinian protests as the US continues to defend its ally Israel’s
  military assault in Gaza. Protesters, including some Jewish groups, say the
  Trump administration wrongly equates their criticism of Israel’s military
  assault in Gaza and its occupation of Palestinian territories with
  antisemitism, and advocacy for Palestinian rights with support for extremism.
  Elsewhere in DC, the Trump administration has said it has found George
  Washington University had violated federal civil rights law regarding Jewish,
  American-Israeli and Israeli students and faculty and will seek “immediate
  remediation” from the school. In a statement, the US Department of Justice
  said GWU had acted “deliberately indifferent to the hostile educational
  environment for Jewish, American-Israeli, and Israeli students and faculty”.
  Representatives for the university could not be immediately reached for
  comment. As my colleague Alice Speri reported last week, the White House is
  reportedly negotiating with several other universities over similar claims,
  with about 60 institutions, including Columbia, Harvard and Brown, under
  investigation over alleged antisemitism. Several have had federal funding cut
  or threatened. Mayor Muriel Bowser is now meeting with attorney general Pam
  Bondi at the justice department headquarters, a DC official confirms to the
  Guardian. Bowser noted in her press conference yesterday that her office
  intends to comply with federal law enforcement, as Bondi will now oversee the
  DC police for the next 30 days. National guard troops began to arrive at their
  headquarters in Washington DC on Tuesday as Democratic mayors warned Donald
  Trump against expanding his law and order power grab in other major cities.
  The US president announced on Monday that he was sending the national guard
  into the nation’s capital and putting city police under federal control, even
  though the violent crime rate is at a 30-year low. Stephen Miller, an
  influential White House deputy chief of staff, stepped up the rhetoric on
  Tuesday, tweeting without evidence: “Crime stats in big blue cities are fake.
  The real rates of crime, chaos &amp; dysfunction are orders of magnitude
  higher. Everyone who lives in these areas knows this. They program their
  entire lives around it. Democrats are trying to unravel civilization. Pres
  Trump will save it.” Trump took command of the Washington DC police department
  and deployed the national guard under laws and constitutional powers that give
  the federal government more sway over the nation’s capital than other cities.
  But Democrats raised concerns that Washington DC could be a blueprint for
  similar strongarm tactics elsewhere. We’re getting an update that Stephen
  Miran – Donald Trump’s nomination for the vacant seat on the Federal Reserve
  board – arrived at the White House. It also looks like he appeared on CNBC as
  short while ago. This comes as the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the
  latest Consumer Price Index report earlier today. In Miran’s interview he said
  that there “continues to be no evidence whatsoever of tariff-induced
  inflation”. The latest numbers show that core inflation, which excludes the
  volatile energy and food industries, went up 3.1% over the last month – a
  higher pace than what was seen in June. European Union leaders made a rallying
  call to defend Ukraine’s freedom to decide its own future in advance of their
  virtual summit with Donald Trump. With the exception of Hungary, all EU
  leaders signed a joint statement, with Kaja Kallas, the EU foreign policy
  chief, also calling for the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to
  attend the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska on Friday. Trump insists his meeting
  with Putin is a “feel-out” to gauge the Russian leader’s willingness to
  compromise, but European leaders fear Trump will be lured into a joint
  declaration with Moscow that involves irretrievable concessions before
  substantive talks between Ukraine and Russia. The EU leaders said: “Meaningful
  negotiations can only take place in the context of a ceasefire or reduction of
  hostilities,” adding: “We share the conviction that a diplomatic solution must
  protect Ukraine’s and Europe’s vital security interests. “A Ukraine capable of
  defending itself effectively is an integral part of any future security
  guarantees.” They added that EU nations were ready to contribute further to
  security guarantees. Our colleagues are bringing you the latest developments
  here As Donald Trump begins his federal takeover of DC police, and deploys
  National Guard troops, among some of the most ardent members of the
  president’s base, this move is both a long-time coming and an opening to renew
  the push to repeal the DC Home Rule Act of 1973. One lawmaker who has been
  particularly vocal is Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah. On Monday, Lee
  posted a video on X pushing his legislation that would strip DC of it’s
  limited powers of self-governance, and for Congress to reassume complete
  control of the city. Online, Lee has wasted no time espousing how the BOWSER
  Act – a bill he introduced earlier this year – will grant Americans a “capital
  city that they can be proud of, not one that they’re afraid of”. This effort
  is, however, unlikely to move forward. It would need 60 votes in the Senate,
  and require several Democrats to pass. Donald Trump has posted on Truth Social
  following the release of the Consumer Price Index report, which shows an
  increase in prices throughout the US. “Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell must NOW lower
  the rate,” Trump wrote. “The damage he has done by always being Too Late is
  incalculable. Fortunately, the economy is sooo good that we’ve blown through
  Powell and the complacent Board”. Trump added that he was considering allowing
  a lawsuit – focused on Powell’s renovation of the fed’s headquarters– to
  proceed. “Three Billion Dollars for a job that should have been a $50 Million
  Dollar fix up. Not good!,” the president said. A newly appointed official at
  the US Department of Labor hired by the Trump administration has a recent
  history of racist, sexually graphic, and conspiratorial posts on social media.
  Jessico Bowman announced last week that she was appointed deputy chief of
  staff of the Bureau of International Labor Affairs at the labor department.
  According to the bureau’s website, its job is to lead “the US Department of
  Labor’s efforts to ensure that workers around the world are treated fairly and
  are able to share in the benefits of the global economy”. Bowman has deleted
  her account on X and Facebook accounts since announcing her hiring. In posts
  seen by the Guardian, Bowman falsely claimed on X in June 2024 that the
  January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol was “a Democrat plot”, adding: “there
  was a war game simulation and a transition integrity project that planned this
  out. They thought Trump would win. They stole the election and then created
  violence and gas lit, jailed us, without due process, and or financially
  drained us into a silent acceptance.” Bowman had previously worked as national
  secretary for the Republican Liberty Caucus, a libertarian-leaning political
  action organization. Her posts include several sexually graphic posts about
  Kamala Harris during the 2024 election, including claiming Harris had “hawk
  tuah experience” and “hawk tuah’d her way to the White House”, tying the
  presidential candidate to a viral video referencing oral sex. Read more about
  the new Trump labor official’s social media history here The House Oversight
  Committee – which is one of two congressional committees that oversees the
  legislative functions of DC – will hold a hearing in September with DC mayor
  Muriel Bowser, DC attorney general Brian Schwalb, and council chair Phil
  Mendelson. That’s according to a statement from chairman James Comer, a
  Republican congressman from Kentucky. Comer praised Donald Trump’s “bold and
  necessary action to crack down on crime and restore law and order” in the
  nation’s capital. This hearing would likely come towards the end of the 30-day
  period, where the DC police are under federal control. In order to extend the
  president’s takeover, a joint resolution in Congress is required. The Consumer
  Price Index for July stayed at 2.7 percent, which is a little lower than the
  2.8 percent forecast. It’s a 0.2 percent increase month-over-month. However,
  “Core” inflation – which leaves out volatile goods like food and energy to
  track how prices are increasing – rose by 0.3 percent. This marks a 3.1
  percent increase over the course of a year – and the highest level in five
  months. The report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggests that some
  tariff-related costs are being passed on to consumers, as Americans start to
  feel their effects. Leading Democrats are lambasting Donald Trump’s decision
  to federalise the DC Metropolitan police department (MPD) and deployment of
  800 National Guard troops to the city. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer
  wrote on X that Trump’s actions are a “political ploy” and an “attempted
  distraction” from the president’s “other scandals”, seemingly referring to the
  ongoing Epstein files saga that plagues the administration. Schumer went on to
  write: If he actually cared about the people of DC, he’d demand the House
  finally release the billion dollars of DC’s funding they’ve been sitting on
  for months. Meanwhile, speaker emerita Nancy Pelosi offered a similar
  criticism, but also citing the president’s inaction during the January 6
  attack. Donald Trump delayed deploying the National Guard on January 6th when
  our Capitol was under violent attack and lives were at stake. Now, he’s
  activating the DC Guard to distract from his incompetent mishandling of
  tariffs, health care, education and immigration — just to name a few blunders.
  Illinois governor JB Pritzker, who has frequently been the subject of Trump’s
  ire (the president even repeatedly referred to Pritzker as “incompetent”
  during yesterday’s press conference), snapped back on social media. He wrote
  that Donald Trump has “no authority to take over Chicago” and even goaded the
  president: “By the way, where are the Epstein files?” Other leading voices in
  the party like Pete Buttigieg – former transportation secretary – doubled down
  in a video posted online. Buttigieg said that Trump was only taking over the
  police department “to solve his own political problems” and get his base
  “thinking and talking about something other than his refusal to open up the
  Epstein files, because he’s mixed up in them”. Later on, we’ll hear from the
  Trump administration for the second day in a row. The president won’t make an
  appearance, but press secretary Karoline Leavitt will hold a White House
  briefing at 1pm ET. Defense secretary Pete Hegseth says he’s proud to be part
  of the Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches, an archconservative network
  of Christian congregations. Hegseth recently made headlines when he shared a
  CNN video on social media about CREC, showing its pastors arguing women should
  not have the right to vote. AP reports: Pastor Doug Wilson, a CREC co-founder,
  leads Christ Church in Moscow, Idaho, the network’s flagship location. Jovial
  and media-friendly, Wilson is no stranger to stirring controversy with his
  church’s hard-line theology and its embrace of patriarchy and Christian
  nationalism. Wilson told The Associated Press on Monday he was grateful
  Hegseth shared the video. He noted Hegseth’s post was labeled with Christ
  Church’s motto: “All of Christ for All of Life.” “He was, in effect, reposting
  it and saying, ‘Amen,’ at some level,” Wilson said. Hegseth, among President
  Donald Trump’s most controversial Cabinet picks, attends Pilgrim Hill Reformed
  Fellowship, a CREC member church in a suburb outside Nashville, Tennessee. His
  pastor, Brooks Potteiger, prayed at a service Hegseth hosted at the Pentagon.
  CREC recently opened a new outpost in the nation’s capital, Christ Church DC,
  with Hegseth attending its first Sunday service. Pentagon chief spokesman Sean
  Parnell confirmed Hegseth’s CREC affiliation and told the AP that Hegseth
  “very much appreciates many of Wilson’s writings and teachings.” Meanwhile,
  the European Union was unable to say when a joint statement on tariffs with
  the United States will be ready nor when it expects the White House to issue
  an executive order on European car import duties, a European Commission
  spokesperson said on Tuesday. “It is an agreement that we believe is strong
  and the best we could have ... Of course, we expect the US to take further
  steps that are part of this agreement but I don’t believe at this stage we can
  put a timeline on these engagements,” the spokesperson said. European Union
  leaders appealed on Tuesday to US president Donald Trump to defend their
  security interests at a key summit with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin
  later this week over the war in Ukraine. Putin appeared to be on the verge of
  making a key territorial grab ahead of Friday’s summit, potentially to use as
  leverage in any peace negotiations, AP reported. The Europeans are desperate
  to exert some influence over the meeting from which they have been sidelined.
  It remains unclear whether even Ukraine will take part. Trump has said that he
  wants to see whether Putin is serious about ending the war, now in its fourth
  year. But Trump has disappointed US allies in Europe by saying that Ukraine
  will have to give up some Russian-held territory. He also said that Russia
  must accept land swaps, although it remains unclear what Putin might be
  expected to surrender. Texas Democrats once again stymied a Republican effort
  to redraw the state’s congressional maps at the behest of Donald Trump, and
  Gavin Newsom, the California governor, urged the president to stand down and
  defuse the redistricting arms race that has spread across the country. Enough
  Texas Democrats remained outside of the state on Monday to deny the
  Republican-led state legislature the quorum necessary to proceed with Trump’s
  desired congressional map. Dozens of Democratic state lawmakers left the state
  last week, taking refuge in blue states such as Illinois and New York. They
  have spent the last week working to raise awareness and rally support for
  their efforts to block the Republican redistricting plan. The standoff has
  widened the redistricting wars, with Newsom and other Democratic state leaders
  threatening to draw retaliatory maps if Texas moves ahead with its
  redistricting scheme. In a letter to Trump on Monday, Newsom said the
  president was “playing with fire” and warned that California was prepared to
  consider new boundaries to “neutralize” any gains Republicans hope to achieve
  in Texas. “This attempt to rig congressional maps to hold onto power before a
  single vote is cast in the 2026 election is an affront to American democracy,”
  Newsom wrote. The governor said he would prefer to leave the matter of
  congressional map-making to independent commissions, not partisan legislative
  bodies and emphasized that he would “happily” stand down if other states
  abandoned their redistricting effort. But, Newsom said: “California cannot
  stand idly by as this power grab unfolds.” In a snarky, all-caps tweet meant
  to mimic Trump’s social media style, Newsom’s office summarized the letter:
  “DONALD TRUMP, IF YOU DO NOT STAND DOWN, WE WILL BE FORCED TO LEAD AN EFFORT
  TO REDRAW THE MAPS IN CA TO OFFSET THE RIGGING OF MAPS IN RED STATES. BUT IF
  THE OTHER STATES CALL OFF THEIR REDISTRICTING EFFORTS, WE WILL DO THE SAME.
  THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER!” The White House did not
  immediately respond to a request for comment. But when asked, Trump has
  defended the Texas plan, arguing that he is “entitled to five more seats”
  because he won the state’s popular vote in the 2024 presidential election. The
  argument, however, is flawed – a popular vote win does not necessarily mean a
  president’s party is awarded more congressional seats. Donald Trump has
  announced he is nominating EJ Antoni, the chief economist at the conservative
  Heritage Foundation, as the next commissioner of the Bureau of Labor
  Statistics. “Our Economy is booming, and E.J. will ensure that the Numbers
  released are HONEST and ACCURATE,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. The
  nomination comes after Trump fired the BLS commissioner, Erika McEntarfer,
  earlier this month following the release of a weak jobs report which he
  claimed, without evidence, had been “rigged”. Antoni, a longtime critic of the
  agency, had previously voiced concerns about revisions to the BLS jobs data.
  “There are better ways to collect, process, and disseminate data – that is the
  task for the next BLS commissioner, and only consistent delivery of accurate
  data in a timely manner will rebuild the trust that has been lost over the
  last several years,” Antoni posted on X earlier this month. The Senate will
  have to confirm his nomination to lead the BLS, an independent agency under
  the labor department. The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that former
  White House adviser and rightwing provocateur Steve Bannon had advocated for
  Antoni’s nomination. The Trump administration is evaluating plans to create a
  “Domestic Civil Disturbance Quick Reaction Force” composed of hundreds of
  national guard troops tasked with rapidly deploying into US cities facing
  protests or unrest, the Washington Post reported on Tuesday citing internal
  Pentagon documents. Donald Trump has confirmed that he and Vladimir Putin will
  discuss “land swapping” when they meet on Friday in Alaska for a high-stakes
  summit on the Ukraine war. But the US president expressed frustration with
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy for putting conditions on such a potential agreement.
  During a news conference at the White House on Monday, Trump said he was
  frustrated with Zelenskyy’s insistence that Ukraine would need to hold a
  national referendum on any peace deal that stipulated recognising Russian
  control over territory that it has occupied during the war. “I was a little
  bothered by the fact that Zelenskyy was saying I have to get constitutional
  approval,” Trump said. “He has approval to go to war and kill everybody but he
  needs approval to do a land swap. Because there will be some land swapping
  going on. I know that through Russia and through conversations with
  everybody.” European diplomats have been taken aback by the lack of clarity on
  the US side about the territories Putin is demanding from Ukraine and the
  terms of a ceasefire. The discrepancies within the US reporting back on what
  Russia is seeking has alarmed European diplomats and only added to a fear that
  Trump, inflating his personal relationship with Putin, could make damaging
  concessions. Describing his vision for a peace deal between Russia and
  Ukraine, Trump said an agreement would include “good stuff, not bad stuff,
  also some bad stuff for both”. “We’re going to change the lines, the battle
  lines,” he added. Donald Trump has once again delayed implementing sweeping
  tariffs on China, announcing another 90-day pause just hours before the last
  agreement between the world’s two largest economies was due to expire. On
  Monday, Trump signed an executive order extending the deadline for higher
  tariffs on China until 10 November, officials confirmed to Reuters. Chinese
  officials said earlier in the day they hoped the United States would strive
  for “positive” trade outcomes on Monday, as the 90-day detente reached between
  the two countries in May was due to expire. China’s commerce ministry, in a
  statement on early Tuesday, said it will suspend additional tariffs on US
  goods for 90 more days, after Trump signed an executive order extending the
  tariff truce. China will maintain its tariffs on US goods at 10%, the
  statement said, and take action to address non-tariff barriers facing American
  products. China will also postpone for 90 days the addition of US firms it had
  targeted in April to trade and investment restriction lists. Hello and welcome
  to the US politics live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you the
  latest news lines over the next few hours. We start with news that Donald
  Trump has ordered the national guard to Washington DC and seized control of
  the city’s police force, in a move described as “unsettling and unprecedented”
  by DC’s mayor. The US president’s move was swiftly condemned as a “disgusting,
  dangerous and derogatory” assault on the political independence of a racially
  diverse city. The federal takeover is expected to be in effect for 30 days,
  the White House confirmed to the Guardian. Speaking at a White House press
  conference on Monday, Trump said he was taking “a historic action to rescue
  our nation’s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam, and squalor and worse.
  This is liberation day in DC and we’re going to take our capital back.” He
  described Washington DC as “one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the
  world”, claiming its murder rate is higher than Bogotá or Mexico City, even
  though violent crime is at a 30-year low. The defense secretary, Pete Hegseth,
  who was among officials joining Trump on the podium, said 800 national guard
  troops would take to the streets of Washington over the coming week. “They
  will be strong, they will be tough and they will stand with their law
  enforcement partners,” he said. Later Muriel Bowser, the mayor of DC, who has
  pursued a non-confrontational relationship with Trump, described the
  intervention as “unsettling and unprecedented” but declined to criticise the
  president directly. “I’ve said before, and I’ll repeat, that I believe that
  the president’s view of DC is shaped by his Covid-era experience during his
  first term,” she told reporters. “It is true that those were more challenging
  times related to some issues. It is also true that we experienced a crime
  spike post-Covid but we worked quickly to put laws in place and tactics that
  got violent offenders off our streets, and gave our police officers more
  tools.” Read the full story here: In other developments: President Donald
  Trump has nominated conservative economist EJ Antoni to head the Bureau of
  Labor Statistics, the agency that is responsible for collecting and publishing
  the country’s employment and inflation figures. The nomination comes after
  Trump fired the BLS commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, earlier this month
  following the release of a weak jobs report which he claimed had been
  “rigged”. Trump has once again delayed implementing sweeping tariffs on China,
  announcing another 90-day pause just hours before the last agreement between
  the world’s two largest economies was due to expire. On Monday, Trump signed
  an executive order extending the deadline for higher tariffs on China until 10
  November. A federal judge in San Francisco on Monday began hearing evidence
  and arguments on whether the Trump administration violated federal law when it
  deployed national guard soldiers and US marines to Los Angeles after protests
  over immigration raids this summer. The Trump administration federalized
  California national guard members and sent them to the second-largest US city
  over the objections of the California governor, Gavin Newsom, and city
  leaders. Trump previewed his Friday meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska,
  claiming he will know “probably in the first two minutes” whether a peace deal
  can be made. Trump confirmed that while Volodymyr Zelenskyy wouldn’t be a part
  of the summit, he would call him first as soon as he saw a “fair deal” for a
  ceasefire emerge. He also didn’t rule out the possibility of a future trading
  relationship with Russia. A federal judge rejected on Monday a request from
  the justice department to unseal the grand jury transcripts relating to the
  criminal investigation of Ghislaine Maxwell – Jeffrey Epstein’s former
  girlfriend, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking. The judge
  wrote that the transcripts could not be released publicly – “casually or
  promiscuously” – as Trump’s government had pushed for because it would risk
  “unraveling the foundations of secrecy upon which the grand jury is premised”.

Our live coverage is ending now. In the meantime, you can find all of our live US politics coverage here. Here is a summary of the key developments from today: The DC national guard will begin deploying on the city’s streets Tuesday night, the White House confirmed to the Guardian, a day after Donald Trump ordered their arrival and took control of the city’s police force, calling Washington DC a “lawless” city, despite official crime statistics saying otherwise. A White House official told the Washington Post that the national guard is expected to “begin being on the streets starting tonight”. Defense officials said a small number of the roughly 800 guard members planned for the mission had already been mobilized by Tuesday afternoon, with more expected to arrive in the coming days. About 850 officers and agents took part in a “massive law enforcement surge” across Washington DC on Monday night and made nearly two dozen arrests, the White House has said. The show of force came after Donald Trump announced he was sending the national guard into the capital and putting city police under federal control, even though the violent crime rate is at a 30-year low. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday: “As part of the president’s massive law enforcement surge, last night approximately 850 officers and agents were surged across the city. They made a total of 23 arrests, including multiple other contacts.” A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to immediately improve conditions at a New York City immigration holding facility, acting on mounting complaints from detainees that the cells are overcrowded, unsanitary and inhumane. Judge Lewis A Kaplan issued a temporary restraining order requiring US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) to limit capacity, ensure cleanliness and provide sleeping mats, beds, toiletries and access to attorneys for migrants held in holding rooms at 26 Federal Plaza, a government building in lower Manhattan. The Texas Senate approved a GOP-drawn congressional map that would give Republicans five more House seats ahead of the 2026 midterms. But since House Democrats continue to break quorum, the legislation isn’t going anywhere. Speaker Dustin Burrows said today that the House will adjourn until Friday 15 August, at which point the legislature will attempt to reach quorum one more time. If this fails they will move to end this month’s first special session days early, and Texas governor Greg Abbott will immediately call a second. California governor Gavin Newsom says the state will draw new electoral maps after Donald Trump “missed” a deadline on Tuesday night in an ongoing redistricting battle between Democratic and Republican states. Several states have waded into the redistricting wars, where Newsom and other Democratic state leaders had threatened to draw retaliatory maps if Texas were to move ahead with its redistricting scheme. The Trump administration is evidently extending its control of cultural representation at the Smithsonian, the world’s largest museum and research complex. In a letter posted on the White House website, the administration told the Smithsonian that it plans a wide review of exhibitions, materials and operations ahead of the US’s 250th anniversary celebrations in 2026. The press secretary Karoline Leavitt characterised Friday’s upcoming meeting between Trump and Vladimir Putin as a “listening exercise” for the president, confirming that Volodymyr Zelenskyy would not be in attendance, but the president has hopes for a trilateral meeting in the future. Zelenskyy said today that Ukraine could not agree to a Russian proposal to give up more of his country’s territory in exchange for a ceasefire, because Moscow would use it as a springboard to start a future war. Speaking to journalists a day before a virtual meeting with US and European leaders, Zelenskyy said he believed Putin wanted to dominate his country because he “does not want a sovereign Ukraine”. The latest inflation data released today showed that the Consumer Price Index held steady at 2.7 percent. “Core” inflation – which leaves out volatile goods like food and energy to track how prices are increasing – rose by 0.3 percent. This marks a 3.1 percent increase over the course of a year – and the highest level in five months. In response, Donald Trump wasted no time calling out Jerome Powell on social media, continuing his long-running campaign against the chair of the Federal Reserve. “The damage he has done by always being Too Late is incalculable,” the president wrote. He also said that he was considering allowing a lawsuit – focused on Powell’s renovation of the fed’s headquarters– to proceed. The New York Times reports that national guard troops have left the area of the Washington Monument, about two hours after they arrived. “We just did a presence patrol to be amongst the people, to be seen,” master Sgt Cory Boroff told reporter Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs. Boroff said he did not know where the troops would be headed next. The US government’s gross national debt has climbed past $37tn, a record milestone that points to the rapid growth of federal borrowing and the mounting cost burden for taxpayers. According to the treasury department’s latest report, released today, the debt reached this level years earlier than expected. In January 2020, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that gross federal debt would not top $37tn until after fiscal year 2030. The faster-than-anticipated increase stems largely from the economic fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic, which shut down much of the country’s economy. In response, the federal government took on massive borrowing to stabilize the economy and aid recovery efforts. The treasury department’s report comes just weeks after the CBO estimated that Trump’s new tax bill will add $3.4tn to the national debt over the next decade. Reuters is reporting that the Trump administration’s flagship Golden Dome missile defense system will include four layers – one satellite-based and three on land – with 11 short-range batteries located across the continental US, Alaska and Hawaii. A US government slide presentation on the project showed slides tagged “Go Fast, Think Big!”. They were presented to 3,000 defense contractors in Huntsville, Alabama, last week and reveal the unprecedented complexity of the system, which faces an ambitious 2028 deadline set by Donald Trump. The system is estimated to cost $175bn, but the slides show uncertainties still loom over the basic architecture of the project because the number of launchers, interceptors, ground stations, and missile sites needed for the system has yet to be determined. “They have a lot of money, but they don’t have a target of what it costs yet,” a US official told the news wire. So far Congress has appropriated $25bn for Golden Dome in Trump’s tax-and-spend bill passed in July. Another $45.3bn is earmarked for Golden Dome in his 2026 presidential budget request. California governor Gavin Newsom kept taking a jab at President Donald Trump on X today, announcing a “BIG PRESS CONFERENCE” this week with “POWERFUL DEMS AND GAVIN NEWSOM” as the ongoing redistricting battle between Democratic and Republican states ensues. “DONALD ‘TACO’ TRUMP, AS MANY CALL HIM, ‘MISSED’ THE DEADLINE!!!”, Newsom’s office wrote on X. “CALIFORNIA WILL NOW DRAW NEW, MORE ‘BEAUTIFUL MAPS,’ THEY WILL BE HISTORIC AS THEY WILL END THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY (DEMS TAKE BACK THE HOUSE!)”. “BIG PRESS CONFERENCE THIS WEEK WITH POWERFUL DEMS AND GAVIN NEWSOM — YOUR FAVORITE GOVERNOR — THAT WILL BE DEVASTATING FOR ‘MAGA.’ THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER! — GN,” reads the post on the social media platform. The post follows a series of snarky, all-caps tweets meant to mimic Trump’s social media style. Newsom was mocking Trump’s moniker, “TACO”, short for “Trump Always Chickens Out”, prompted by his flip-flopping deadlines. The DC national guard will begin deploying on the city’s streets Tuesday night, the White House confirmed to the Guardian, a day after Donald Trump ordered their arrival and took control of the city’s police force, calling Washington DC a “lawless” city, despite official crime statistics saying otherwise. A White House official told the Washington Post that the national guard is expected to “begin being on the streets starting tonight”. Defense officials said a small number of the roughly 800 guard members planned for the mission had already been mobilized by Tuesday afternoon, with more expected to arrive in the coming days. The New York Times reports that about a dozen national guard members have appeared in five military vehicles across from the Washington Monument. Earlier today, DC mayor Muriel Bowser said she expected members of the national guard to be deployed on federal property in the nation’s capital. “My expectation, though it can change, is that they will deploy the guard on federal properties, that includes parks, monuments, federal buildings,” Bowser said on a community chat on X. Following the increase in tariffs by the US on Brazilian imports (from 10% to 50% earlier this month), Brazil’s president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva announced that his government will provide 30 billion reais ($5.55bn) in credit to support exporters affected by the steeper levies. In an interview with local news outlet BandNews, Lula said this initial package will also include support through government purchases. Some Brazilian products, including orange juice and aircraft, were exempted from the recent US tariff increase. This boost comes as Lula has remained in the public eye for his fierce criticism of Donald Trump’s tariffs, which the Brazilian president sees as a political move interfering with Brazil’s sovereignty, especially since the tariffs are linked to ongoing legal proceedings against former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, often described as the “Trump of the tropics”. Donald Trump’s administration has significantly changed a key US government report on human rights worldwide, dramatically softening criticism of some countries that have been strong partners of the Republican president, such as El Salvador and Israel, which rights groups say have well-established histories of abuses. Instead, the US state department sounded an alarm about what it said was the erosion of freedom of speech in Europe and ramped up criticism of Brazil and South Africa – both of which Washington has clashed with over a host of issues. Criticism of governments over their treatment of LGBTQ+ rights, which appeared in Biden administration editions of the report, appeared to have been largely omitted. Washington referred to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine mainly as the “Russia-Ukraine war”. The report’s section on Israel was much shorter than last year’s edition and contained no mention of the severe humanitarian crisis or death toll in Gaza. About 61,000 people have died, according to the Gaza health ministry, as a result of Israel’s military operations in response to an attack by Hamas in October 2023. The report was delayed for months as Trump appointees altered an earlier state department draft dramatically to bring it in line with “America First” values, according to government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. The report introduced new categories such as “Life”, “Liberty” and “Security of the Person”. Read the full story here: The Georgia Bureau of Investigation confirmed today that the man who opened fire at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) headquarters last week, killing a police officer, died by suicide. The shooter “died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound”, the bureau’s director, Chris Hosey, said at a news conference today. “Evidence in this event indicates that the shooter had recently verbalized thoughts of suicide, which even led to law enforcement being contacted several weeks prior to the incident,” Hosey said. The shooter has been identified by authorities as 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White. He had blamed the Covid-19 vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal, which has led the union representing CDC employees to demand that the federal government condemn vaccine misinformation. About 850 officers and agents took part in a “massive law enforcement surge” across Washington DC on Monday night and made nearly two dozen arrests, the White House has said. The show of force came after Donald Trump announced he was sending the national guard into the capital and putting city police under federal control, even though the violent crime rate is at a 30-year low. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday: “As part of the president’s massive law enforcement surge, last night approximately 850 officers and agents were surged across the city. They made a total of 23 arrests, including multiple other contacts.” The arrests consisted of homicide, firearms offences, possession with intent to distribute narcotics, fare evasion, lewd acts and stalking, Leavitt added. “A total of six illegal handguns were seized off of District of Columbia’s streets as part of last night’s effort.” Read the full story here: A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to immediately improve conditions at a New York City immigration holding facility, acting on mounting complaints from detainees that the cells are overcrowded, unsanitary and inhumane. Judge Lewis A Kaplan issued a temporary restraining order requiring US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) to limit capacity, ensure cleanliness and provide sleeping mats, beds, toiletries and access to attorneys for migrants held in holding rooms at 26 Federal Plaza, a government building in lower Manhattan. The order follows a lawsuit filed last week by civil rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union and Make the Road New York, alleging that conditions in the holding rooms were “crowded, squalid and punitive”. In court filings, detainees said they were forced to sleep on the floor, sometimes in rooms with up to 100 people, without mattresses or padding, and were denied soap, toothbrushes, and other hygiene products. The Trump administration sanctioned an armed group accused of illegally trading minerals in eastern Congo, as Washington seeks to lead peace efforts in the region while securing US access to its mineral resources. A senior US government official told the AP that the state and treasury departments are targeting the Codeco armed group, which controlled the key coltan mining site of Rubaya from 2022 until early 2024. “During this period, Codeco generated revenue by overseeing mining operations, collecting illegal fees and taxes for miners and engaging in mineral smuggling. It also imposed forced labor and executed civilians in mining areas under its control,” the official said. The sanctions also target the Congolese mining company CDMC, accused of selling minerals sourced and smuggled from mines near Rubaya, as well as two Hong Kong exporters, East Rise and Star Dragon, that purchased minerals from the area. Mexico has transferred a group of imprisoned cartel members to the United States, amid growing pressure from the Trump administration to dismantle the country’s powerful drug organizations, the Wall Street Journal reported. The group, sent on Tuesday, was roughly the same size as the 29 prisoners transferred in February. WSJ reports: The group sent Tuesday included members of top criminal organizations facing drug charges in the US who are being sent to locations including Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia, San Diego and New York, one of the people said. Terry Cole, the Drug Enforcement Administration chief overseeing the federal takeover of DC police, said in an interview that, starting tonight, federal agents will be “embedded with the Metropolitan police department”. “You will see federal agents working hand in hand on patrol with the Metropolitan Police Department, you will also see an increase of activity, patrol activity in certain sectors to go after the violent criminal offenders that are the drivers of this crime,” Cole said in an interview with Fox News. Earlier today, Texas Senate Democrats staged a walkout in protest of the chamber’s proposed congressional redistricting map, which was moving forward to the Texas House. Despite the senators’ absence, the Republican-controlled Senate approved the map in a 19-2 vote. But it cannot win final approval while the quorum is broken. Texas House Democrats have been out of state for weeks to block Republican lawmakers from conducting business. Senate Democrats are challenging governor Greg Abbott’s decision to prioritize redistricting over urgent flood relief for the state’s affected communities. “This special session is about one thing: flood relief,” said Texas state senator Roland Gutierrez. “Greg Abbott tried to sneak in a rigged mid-decade redistricting beneath voters’ noses. Let’s be clear, the governor can provide this relief anytime he wants. But Abbott is holding it hostage so that he has an excuse to do Trump’s bidding.” “Texas has a long tradition of independence. But when Donald Trump tells Greg Abbott to roll over and fetch him five seats, he does it like a good lapdog,” Gutierrez added. “This governor has failed to uphold Texas values, defend the people of Texas, or make the lives of its citizens better in any meaningful way.” Democratic senators Judith Zaffirini and Chuy Hinojosa did not participate in today’s walkout and stayed in the chamber, according to the Dallas Morning News. Democratic representative Adam Smith, of the state of Washington, said it is “pretty clear” President Trump “wants his own domestic police force” after the president seized control of DC’s Metropolitan police department. “Look, this president is trampling on basic freedoms of the American people to a degree we, I don’t think we’ve ever seen,” Smith said on CNN. “You see that with what the ICE agents are doing, in terms of picking people up off the streets with no evidence, no due process, locking people up.” “This is happening all across the country,” Smith added. “Look, it’s pretty clear the president wants his own domestic police force, and step by step, he’s trying to create it, and we should be deeply alarmed by that, regardless of how you feel about crime in Washington DC, or any other city.” National guard troops began to arrive at their headquarters in Washington DC on Tuesday, after Donald Trump announced yesterday that he was deploying them to the nation’s capital and putting city police under federal control, even though the violent crime rate is at a 30-year low. Leading Democrats have called the move a “distraction” from the president’s economic agenda and the plague of the Epstein files. Earlier, the DC mayor Muriel Bowser met with attorney general Pam Bondi, after saying that her office intends to comply with federal law enforcement, as Bondi will now oversee the DC police for the next 30 days. On social media, Bondi described the meeting as “productive”, saying the pair agreed there is “nothing more important” than keeping residents and tourists “safe from deadly crime”. Meanwhile in the White House briefing room today, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president’s DC police takeover was “just the beginning”, saying that the massive surge in law enforcement resulted in 23 arrests yesterday. She added that if individuals living in homeless encampments refuse to accept places in shelters or addiction facilities they would be subject to fines or jail time. Leavitt added that the administration is still considering moving the homeless population out of the city. Beyond Washington, the press secretary characterised Friday’s upcoming meeting between Trump and Vladimir Putin as a “listening exercise” for the president, confirming that Volodymyr Zelenskyy would not be in attendance, but the president has hopes for a trilateral meeting in the future. For his part, Zelenskyy said today that Ukraine could not agree to a Russian proposal to give up more of his country’s territory in exchange for a ceasefire, because Moscow would use it as a springboard to start a future war. Speaking to journalists a day before a virtual meeting with US and European leaders, Zelenskyy said he believed Putin wanted to dominate his country because he “does not want a sovereign Ukraine”. Closer to home, the Texas Sentate approved a GOP-drawn congressional map, that would give Republicans five more House seats ahead of the 2026 midterms. But since House Democrats continue to break quorum, the legislation isn’t going anywhere. Speaker Dustin Burrows said today that the House will adjourn until Friday 15 August, at which point the legislature will attempt to reach quorum one more time. If this fails they will move to end this month’s first special session days early, and Texas governor Greg Abbott will immediately call a second. When it comes to the economy, the latest inflation data released today showed that the Consumer Price Index held steady at 2.7 percent. “Core” inflation – which leaves out volatile goods like food and energy to track how prices are increasing – rose by 0.3 percent. This marks a 3.1 percent increase over the course of a year – and the highest level in five months. In response, Donald Trump wasted no time calling out Jerome Powell on social media, continuing his long-running campaign against the chair of the Federal Reserve. “The damage he has done by always being Too Late is incalculable,” the president wrote. He also said that he was considering allowing a lawsuit – focused on Powell’s renovation of the fed’s headquarters– to proceed. The New York Times is reporting that investigators have uncovered evidence that Russia is “at least in part” responsible for a recent hack of the computer system of the federal court system. According to the Times’s sources, this breach includes highly sensitive records that could contain information with names and details of people charged with national security crimes. The Times also reports that it’s not immediately clear what specific Russian entity might be responsible for the hack. Just a quick post here to sum up the latest analysis from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which breaks down the financial impact of Donald Trump’s domestic policy bill that became law last month. The topline: the CBO estimates that the poorest 10% of Americans can expect to lose around $1200 per year due to the restrictions and cut backs in the legislation – namely when it comes to Medicaid and Snap benefits. By contrast, the richest 10% of Americans can expect to gain around $13,600 each year, due to the extension of the president’s 2017 tax cuts. In response to Congressional Democratic leadership’s request for analysis on the distribution of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a letter from the CBO’s director noted that while, on average, American households can expect to see an increase in resources, this will not be evenly distributed. He writes: Resources will decrease for households toward the bottom of the income distribution, whereas resources will increase for households in the middle and toward the top of the income distribution. The Trump administration is evidently extending its control of cultural representation at the Smithsonian, the world’s largest museum and research complex. In a letter obtained by the Wall Street Journal, the White House told the Smithsonian that it plans a wide review of exhibitions, materials and operations ahead of the US’s 250th anniversary celebrations in 2026. The letter to Lonnie Bunch, the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, from Trump administration officials said the White House wants the museums’ program to reflect “unity, progress, and enduring values that define the American story” in keeping with an executive order issued in March that ordered the elimination of “improper, divisive or anti-American ideology” from the Smithsonian and its museums. Donald Trump’s order from March, titled Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History, said the president “aims to ensure that the Smithsonian is an institution that sparks children’s imagination, celebrates American history and ingenuity, serves as a symbol to the world of American greatness, and makes America proud”. But Monday’s letter to the institution, according to the Journal, places the institution under curatorial scrutiny ranging from public-facing exhibition text and online content to internal curatorial processes, exhibition planning, the use of collections and artist grants. Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said Ukraine could not agree to a Russian proposal to give up more of his country’s territory in exchange for a ceasefire because Moscow would use what it gained as a springboard to start a future war. The Ukrainian president said he did not believe that Donald Trump supported Russia’s demands, and he expressed hope the US leader would act as an honest mediator when he meets Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday. He added there was no sign that Russia was preparing to implement a ceasefire, as reports emerged that small sabotage groups had pierced Ukrainian defences in the eastern Donbas, advancing about six miles in three days. Zelenskyy also warned that Russia was planning new offensives on three parts of the frontline. Speaking to journalists in the run-up to the Trump-Putin summit, and a day before a virtual meeting with US and European leaders, Zelenskyy said he believed Putin wanted to dominate his country because he “does not want a sovereign Ukraine”. Read more on the lead-up to both meetings here The Texas Sentate has passed a GOP-drawn congressional map, that would give Republicans five more House seats ahead of the 2026 midterms. The map passed 19-2 along party lines. Nine Senate Democrats left the floor in solidarity with their House colleagues – who broke quorum again earlier today in protest of the map. The legislation can’t advance without the absent Democrats in the lower chamber. Speaker Dustin Burrows said today that the House will adjourn until Friday 15 August, at which point the legislature will attempt to reach quorum one more time. If this fails they will move to end this month’s first special session days early, and Texas governor Greg Abbott will immediately call a second. “I’ll call special after special until the Texas first agenda is passed,” Abbott said in a post on X. The White House heralded today’s Consumer Price Index report as an clear picture of inflation remaining stable. But another notable exchange in the press briefing was a reporter’s question about why the public should trust the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ inflation data report, given the administration undermining the jobs data released earlier this month. This led to the firing of former commissioner Erika McEntarfer, and yesterday’s announcement that the president is nominating EJ Antoni, chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, to replace her. Antoni is a longtime critic of the BLS. “The jobs data has had massive revisions,” Leavitt said, referring to the routine practice of issuing revisions to provide a more accurate picture of data. “We want to ensure that all of the data, the inflation data, the jobs data, any data point that is coming out of the BLS, is trustworthy and is accurate”. When asked in today’s press briefing, the White House offered little clarity on administration’s view of Benjamin Netanyahu’s Gaza City takeover. This is, of course, an incredibly complex and complicated situation. The administration has made our goal clear. We want to see this conflict end. We want to see the hostages released…the President and his national security team has given extensive effort and time in doing that. Speaking about what will happen to the homeless population in Washington DC, Leavitt cites city codes which would give individuals the “option to leave their encampment, to be taken to a homeless shelter to be offered addiction or mental health services”. If they refuse, Leavitt says, they will be “susceptible to fines or to jail time”. Leavitt also says that the administration is still considering moving the homeless population out of the city. Karoline Leavitt offers a limited preface to the president’s meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday. But she notes that Trump sees the meeting as a “listening exercise” because only one party is present. Leavitt also answered a question about why Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy was not included in Friday’s meeting, despite calls from European leaders. She underscored that Putin called for this meeting, and “the goal of this meeting for the president is to walk away with a better understanding of how we can end this war”. Leavitt also reaffirmed Trump’s hopes for a trilateral meeting in the future. Leavitt is talking about the perception of crime in Washington DC. She is referring to polling that shows an increase in residents feeling that crime is a serious problem in the city. However, violent crime is on the decline at the moment, and reached a 30-year low last year. Leavitt is now addressing the president’s federal takeover of DC police, and the deployment of National Guard troops to the city. This is only the beginning. Over the course of the next month, the Trump administration will relentlessly pursue and arrest every violent criminal in the district who breaks the law undermines public safety and endangers law abiding Americans. Soon, we can expect the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt to hold a briefing. We’ll bring you the latest as that gets going. Attorney general Pam Bondi said that her meeting with DC mayor Muriel Bowser was “productive” in a statement on X. “We agreed that there is nothing more important than keeping residents and tourists in Washington, D.C. safe from deadly crime,” she wrote. However, violent crime in the capital hit a record 30-year low in 2024. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton asked a local judge on Tuesday to consider jailing Beto O’Rourke, saying the former congressman was openly defying a judicial order blocking the former congressman and his political group from fundraising and paying the costs of Democrats who left the state to stop Republicans from passing a new congressional map. Tarrant County District Judge Megan Fahey granted a request from Paxton last week halting O’Rourke and a group aligned with him, Powered by People, from fundraising. In his Tuesday, filing, Paxton said O’Rourke had continued to fundraise after Fahey’s ruling, pointing to a tweet soliciting donations on ActBlue and requests to donate during a rally in Fort Worth last week. Paxton requested O’Rourke be fined $500 for each instance in which he defied the court’s order and “be confined to jail unless and until he demonstrates a willingness to abide by the Court’s orders pending the outcome of this lawsuit.” A US appeals court has rejected a bid by a group of unions to block the Trump administration’s government downsizing team, the “department of government efficiency” (Doge), from accessing sensitive data on Americans. The Virginia-based fourth US circuit court of appeals in a 2-1 decision said the unions were unlikely to prevail on claims that Doge would violate federal privacy laws by accessing data at the US Department of Education, treasury department, and Office of Personnel Management. The court refused to block Doge access to the agencies’ computer systems and data such as social security numbers and individuals’ citizenship status pending the outcome of the case. The decision reverses a temporary injunction issued by a federal judge in Maryland, which had been paused by the appeals court in April. The agencies involved in the case and the unions that sued, which include the American Federation of Teachers and the National Federation of Federal Employees, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The 4th circuit today said the unions that sued along with a group of military veterans had not shown how they would be injured by Doge accessing agencies’ computer systems. They also probably lacked legal standing to sue because that access is not a “final agency action” that can form the basis of a lawsuit, the court said. A dissenting judge said it was prudent to temporarily block access to the data while the case plays out, and that the standard his colleagues had imposed on the plaintiffs was too high. Per my last post, in the letter sent to university George Washington University president Ellen Granberg today, assistant attorney general Harmeet Dhillon said the justice department found members of the university community engaged in “antisemitic, disruptive protests”, including by establishing an encampment at University Yard. Dhillon said these efforts were meant to “frighten, intimidate, and deny” Jewish, Israeli, and American Israeli students access to the university environment. “The Department finds that despite actual notice of the abuses occurring on its campus, GWU was deliberately indifferent to the complaints it received, the misconduct that occurred, and the harms that were suffered,” Dhillon’s letter said. Dhillon said the justice department intends to proceed with enforcement, but is offering the university the opportunity to resolve the matter through a voluntary resolution agreement. The university has until 22 August to indicate whether it has “interest in such a dialogue”, according to the letter. GWU is the latest university to be targeted by the Trump administration, which has threatened to cut federal funds for universities over pro-Palestinian protests as the US continues to defend its ally Israel’s military assault in Gaza. Protesters, including some Jewish groups, say the Trump administration wrongly equates their criticism of Israel’s military assault in Gaza and its occupation of Palestinian territories with antisemitism, and advocacy for Palestinian rights with support for extremism. Elsewhere in DC, the Trump administration has said it has found George Washington University had violated federal civil rights law regarding Jewish, American-Israeli and Israeli students and faculty and will seek “immediate remediation” from the school. In a statement, the US Department of Justice said GWU had acted “deliberately indifferent to the hostile educational environment for Jewish, American-Israeli, and Israeli students and faculty”. Representatives for the university could not be immediately reached for comment. As my colleague Alice Speri reported last week, the White House is reportedly negotiating with several other universities over similar claims, with about 60 institutions, including Columbia, Harvard and Brown, under investigation over alleged antisemitism. Several have had federal funding cut or threatened. Mayor Muriel Bowser is now meeting with attorney general Pam Bondi at the justice department headquarters, a DC official confirms to the Guardian. Bowser noted in her press conference yesterday that her office intends to comply with federal law enforcement, as Bondi will now oversee the DC police for the next 30 days. National guard troops began to arrive at their headquarters in Washington DC on Tuesday as Democratic mayors warned Donald Trump against expanding his law and order power grab in other major cities. The US president announced on Monday that he was sending the national guard into the nation’s capital and putting city police under federal control, even though the violent crime rate is at a 30-year low. Stephen Miller, an influential White House deputy chief of staff, stepped up the rhetoric on Tuesday, tweeting without evidence: “Crime stats in big blue cities are fake. The real rates of crime, chaos &amp; dysfunction are orders of magnitude higher. Everyone who lives in these areas knows this. They program their entire lives around it. Democrats are trying to unravel civilization. Pres Trump will save it.” Trump took command of the Washington DC police department and deployed the national guard under laws and constitutional powers that give the federal government more sway over the nation’s capital than other cities. But Democrats raised concerns that Washington DC could be a blueprint for similar strongarm tactics elsewhere. We’re getting an update that Stephen Miran – Donald Trump’s nomination for the vacant seat on the Federal Reserve board – arrived at the White House. It also looks like he appeared on CNBC as short while ago. This comes as the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the latest Consumer Price Index report earlier today. In Miran’s interview he said that there “continues to be no evidence whatsoever of tariff-induced inflation”. The latest numbers show that core inflation, which excludes the volatile energy and food industries, went up 3.1% over the last month – a higher pace than what was seen in June. European Union leaders made a rallying call to defend Ukraine’s freedom to decide its own future in advance of their virtual summit with Donald Trump. With the exception of Hungary, all EU leaders signed a joint statement, with Kaja Kallas, the EU foreign policy chief, also calling for the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to attend the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska on Friday. Trump insists his meeting with Putin is a “feel-out” to gauge the Russian leader’s willingness to compromise, but European leaders fear Trump will be lured into a joint declaration with Moscow that involves irretrievable concessions before substantive talks between Ukraine and Russia. The EU leaders said: “Meaningful negotiations can only take place in the context of a ceasefire or reduction of hostilities,” adding: “We share the conviction that a diplomatic solution must protect Ukraine’s and Europe’s vital security interests. “A Ukraine capable of defending itself effectively is an integral part of any future security guarantees.” They added that EU nations were ready to contribute further to security guarantees. Our colleagues are bringing you the latest developments here As Donald Trump begins his federal takeover of DC police, and deploys National Guard troops, among some of the most ardent members of the president’s base, this move is both a long-time coming and an opening to renew the push to repeal the DC Home Rule Act of 1973. One lawmaker who has been particularly vocal is Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah. On Monday, Lee posted a video on X pushing his legislation that would strip DC of it’s limited powers of self-governance, and for Congress to reassume complete control of the city. Online, Lee has wasted no time espousing how the BOWSER Act – a bill he introduced earlier this year – will grant Americans a “capital city that they can be proud of, not one that they’re afraid of”. This effort is, however, unlikely to move forward. It would need 60 votes in the Senate, and require several Democrats to pass. Donald Trump has posted on Truth Social following the release of the Consumer Price Index report, which shows an increase in prices throughout the US. “Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell must NOW lower the rate,” Trump wrote. “The damage he has done by always being Too Late is incalculable. Fortunately, the economy is sooo good that we’ve blown through Powell and the complacent Board”. Trump added that he was considering allowing a lawsuit – focused on Powell’s renovation of the fed’s headquarters– to proceed. “Three Billion Dollars for a job that should have been a $50 Million Dollar fix up. Not good!,” the president said. A newly appointed official at the US Department of Labor hired by the Trump administration has a recent history of racist, sexually graphic, and conspiratorial posts on social media. Jessico Bowman announced last week that she was appointed deputy chief of staff of the Bureau of International Labor Affairs at the labor department. According to the bureau’s website, its job is to lead “the US Department of Labor’s efforts to ensure that workers around the world are treated fairly and are able to share in the benefits of the global economy”. Bowman has deleted her account on X and Facebook accounts since announcing her hiring. In posts seen by the Guardian, Bowman falsely claimed on X in June 2024 that the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol was “a Democrat plot”, adding: “there was a war game simulation and a transition integrity project that planned this out. They thought Trump would win. They stole the election and then created violence and gas lit, jailed us, without due process, and or financially drained us into a silent acceptance.” Bowman had previously worked as national secretary for the Republican Liberty Caucus, a libertarian-leaning political action organization. Her posts include several sexually graphic posts about Kamala Harris during the 2024 election, including claiming Harris had “hawk tuah experience” and “hawk tuah’d her way to the White House”, tying the presidential candidate to a viral video referencing oral sex. Read more about the new Trump labor official’s social media history here The House Oversight Committee – which is one of two congressional committees that oversees the legislative functions of DC – will hold a hearing in September with DC mayor Muriel Bowser, DC attorney general Brian Schwalb, and council chair Phil Mendelson. That’s according to a statement from chairman James Comer, a Republican congressman from Kentucky. Comer praised Donald Trump’s “bold and necessary action to crack down on crime and restore law and order” in the nation’s capital. This hearing would likely come towards the end of the 30-day period, where the DC police are under federal control. In order to extend the president’s takeover, a joint resolution in Congress is required. The Consumer Price Index for July stayed at 2.7 percent, which is a little lower than the 2.8 percent forecast. It’s a 0.2 percent increase month-over-month. However, “Core” inflation – which leaves out volatile goods like food and energy to track how prices are increasing – rose by 0.3 percent. This marks a 3.1 percent increase over the course of a year – and the highest level in five months. The report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggests that some tariff-related costs are being passed on to consumers, as Americans start to feel their effects. Leading Democrats are lambasting Donald Trump’s decision to federalise the DC Metropolitan police department (MPD) and deployment of 800 National Guard troops to the city. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer wrote on X that Trump’s actions are a “political ploy” and an “attempted distraction” from the president’s “other scandals”, seemingly referring to the ongoing Epstein files saga that plagues the administration. Schumer went on to write: If he actually cared about the people of DC, he’d demand the House finally release the billion dollars of DC’s funding they’ve been sitting on for months. Meanwhile, speaker emerita Nancy Pelosi offered a similar criticism, but also citing the president’s inaction during the January 6 attack. Donald Trump delayed deploying the National Guard on January 6th when our Capitol was under violent attack and lives were at stake. Now, he’s activating the DC Guard to distract from his incompetent mishandling of tariffs, health care, education and immigration — just to name a few blunders. Illinois governor JB Pritzker, who has frequently been the subject of Trump’s ire (the president even repeatedly referred to Pritzker as “incompetent” during yesterday’s press conference), snapped back on social media. He wrote that Donald Trump has “no authority to take over Chicago” and even goaded the president: “By the way, where are the Epstein files?” Other leading voices in the party like Pete Buttigieg – former transportation secretary – doubled down in a video posted online. Buttigieg said that Trump was only taking over the police department “to solve his own political problems” and get his base “thinking and talking about something other than his refusal to open up the Epstein files, because he’s mixed up in them”. Later on, we’ll hear from the Trump administration for the second day in a row. The president won’t make an appearance, but press secretary Karoline Leavitt will hold a White House briefing at 1pm ET. Defense secretary Pete Hegseth says he’s proud to be part of the Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches, an archconservative network of Christian congregations. Hegseth recently made headlines when he shared a CNN video on social media about CREC, showing its pastors arguing women should not have the right to vote. AP reports: Pastor Doug Wilson, a CREC co-founder, leads Christ Church in Moscow, Idaho, the network’s flagship location. Jovial and media-friendly, Wilson is no stranger to stirring controversy with his church’s hard-line theology and its embrace of patriarchy and Christian nationalism. Wilson told The Associated Press on Monday he was grateful Hegseth shared the video. He noted Hegseth’s post was labeled with Christ Church’s motto: “All of Christ for All of Life.” “He was, in effect, reposting it and saying, ‘Amen,’ at some level,” Wilson said. Hegseth, among President Donald Trump’s most controversial Cabinet picks, attends Pilgrim Hill Reformed Fellowship, a CREC member church in a suburb outside Nashville, Tennessee. His pastor, Brooks Potteiger, prayed at a service Hegseth hosted at the Pentagon. CREC recently opened a new outpost in the nation’s capital, Christ Church DC, with Hegseth attending its first Sunday service. Pentagon chief spokesman Sean Parnell confirmed Hegseth’s CREC affiliation and told the AP that Hegseth “very much appreciates many of Wilson’s writings and teachings.” Meanwhile, the European Union was unable to say when a joint statement on tariffs with the United States will be ready nor when it expects the White House to issue an executive order on European car import duties, a European Commission spokesperson said on Tuesday. “It is an agreement that we believe is strong and the best we could have ... Of course, we expect the US to take further steps that are part of this agreement but I don’t believe at this stage we can put a timeline on these engagements,” the spokesperson said. European Union leaders appealed on Tuesday to US president Donald Trump to defend their security interests at a key summit with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin later this week over the war in Ukraine. Putin appeared to be on the verge of making a key territorial grab ahead of Friday’s summit, potentially to use as leverage in any peace negotiations, AP reported. The Europeans are desperate to exert some influence over the meeting from which they have been sidelined. It remains unclear whether even Ukraine will take part. Trump has said that he wants to see whether Putin is serious about ending the war, now in its fourth year. But Trump has disappointed US allies in Europe by saying that Ukraine will have to give up some Russian-held territory. He also said that Russia must accept land swaps, although it remains unclear what Putin might be expected to surrender. Texas Democrats once again stymied a Republican effort to redraw the state’s congressional maps at the behest of Donald Trump, and Gavin Newsom, the California governor, urged the president to stand down and defuse the redistricting arms race that has spread across the country. Enough Texas Democrats remained outside of the state on Monday to deny the Republican-led state legislature the quorum necessary to proceed with Trump’s desired congressional map. Dozens of Democratic state lawmakers left the state last week, taking refuge in blue states such as Illinois and New York. They have spent the last week working to raise awareness and rally support for their efforts to block the Republican redistricting plan. The standoff has widened the redistricting wars, with Newsom and other Democratic state leaders threatening to draw retaliatory maps if Texas moves ahead with its redistricting scheme. In a letter to Trump on Monday, Newsom said the president was “playing with fire” and warned that California was prepared to consider new boundaries to “neutralize” any gains Republicans hope to achieve in Texas. “This attempt to rig congressional maps to hold onto power before a single vote is cast in the 2026 election is an affront to American democracy,” Newsom wrote. The governor said he would prefer to leave the matter of congressional map-making to independent commissions, not partisan legislative bodies and emphasized that he would “happily” stand down if other states abandoned their redistricting effort. But, Newsom said: “California cannot stand idly by as this power grab unfolds.” In a snarky, all-caps tweet meant to mimic Trump’s social media style, Newsom’s office summarized the letter: “DONALD TRUMP, IF YOU DO NOT STAND DOWN, WE WILL BE FORCED TO LEAD AN EFFORT TO REDRAW THE MAPS IN CA TO OFFSET THE RIGGING OF MAPS IN RED STATES. BUT IF THE OTHER STATES CALL OFF THEIR REDISTRICTING EFFORTS, WE WILL DO THE SAME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER!” The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But when asked, Trump has defended the Texas plan, arguing that he is “entitled to five more seats” because he won the state’s popular vote in the 2024 presidential election. The argument, however, is flawed – a popular vote win does not necessarily mean a president’s party is awarded more congressional seats. Donald Trump has announced he is nominating EJ Antoni, the chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, as the next commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. “Our Economy is booming, and E.J. will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. The nomination comes after Trump fired the BLS commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, earlier this month following the release of a weak jobs report which he claimed, without evidence, had been “rigged”. Antoni, a longtime critic of the agency, had previously voiced concerns about revisions to the BLS jobs data. “There are better ways to collect, process, and disseminate data – that is the task for the next BLS commissioner, and only consistent delivery of accurate data in a timely manner will rebuild the trust that has been lost over the last several years,” Antoni posted on X earlier this month. The Senate will have to confirm his nomination to lead the BLS, an independent agency under the labor department. The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that former White House adviser and rightwing provocateur Steve Bannon had advocated for Antoni’s nomination. The Trump administration is evaluating plans to create a “Domestic Civil Disturbance Quick Reaction Force” composed of hundreds of national guard troops tasked with rapidly deploying into US cities facing protests or unrest, the Washington Post reported on Tuesday citing internal Pentagon documents. Donald Trump has confirmed that he and Vladimir Putin will discuss “land swapping” when they meet on Friday in Alaska for a high-stakes summit on the Ukraine war. But the US president expressed frustration with Volodymyr Zelenskyy for putting conditions on such a potential agreement. During a news conference at the White House on Monday, Trump said he was frustrated with Zelenskyy’s insistence that Ukraine would need to hold a national referendum on any peace deal that stipulated recognising Russian control over territory that it has occupied during the war. “I was a little bothered by the fact that Zelenskyy was saying I have to get constitutional approval,” Trump said. “He has approval to go to war and kill everybody but he needs approval to do a land swap. Because there will be some land swapping going on. I know that through Russia and through conversations with everybody.” European diplomats have been taken aback by the lack of clarity on the US side about the territories Putin is demanding from Ukraine and the terms of a ceasefire. The discrepancies within the US reporting back on what Russia is seeking has alarmed European diplomats and only added to a fear that Trump, inflating his personal relationship with Putin, could make damaging concessions. Describing his vision for a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, Trump said an agreement would include “good stuff, not bad stuff, also some bad stuff for both”. “We’re going to change the lines, the battle lines,” he added. Donald Trump has once again delayed implementing sweeping tariffs on China, announcing another 90-day pause just hours before the last agreement between the world’s two largest economies was due to expire. On Monday, Trump signed an executive order extending the deadline for higher tariffs on China until 10 November, officials confirmed to Reuters. Chinese officials said earlier in the day they hoped the United States would strive for “positive” trade outcomes on Monday, as the 90-day detente reached between the two countries in May was due to expire. China’s commerce ministry, in a statement on early Tuesday, said it will suspend additional tariffs on US goods for 90 more days, after Trump signed an executive order extending the tariff truce. China will maintain its tariffs on US goods at 10%, the statement said, and take action to address non-tariff barriers facing American products. China will also postpone for 90 days the addition of US firms it had targeted in April to trade and investment restriction lists. Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you the latest news lines over the next few hours. We start with news that Donald Trump has ordered the national guard to Washington DC and seized control of the city’s police force, in a move described as “unsettling and unprecedented” by DC’s mayor. The US president’s move was swiftly condemned as a “disgusting, dangerous and derogatory” assault on the political independence of a racially diverse city. The federal takeover is expected to be in effect for 30 days, the White House confirmed to the Guardian. Speaking at a White House press conference on Monday, Trump said he was taking “a historic action to rescue our nation’s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam, and squalor and worse. This is liberation day in DC and we’re going to take our capital back.” He described Washington DC as “one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the world”, claiming its murder rate is higher than Bogotá or Mexico City, even though violent crime is at a 30-year low. The defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, who was among officials joining Trump on the podium, said 800 national guard troops would take to the streets of Washington over the coming week. “They will be strong, they will be tough and they will stand with their law enforcement partners,” he said. Later Muriel Bowser, the mayor of DC, who has pursued a non-confrontational relationship with Trump, described the intervention as “unsettling and unprecedented” but declined to criticise the president directly. “I’ve said before, and I’ll repeat, that I believe that the president’s view of DC is shaped by his Covid-era experience during his first term,” she told reporters. “It is true that those were more challenging times related to some issues. It is also true that we experienced a crime spike post-Covid but we worked quickly to put laws in place and tactics that got violent offenders off our streets, and gave our police officers more tools.” Read the full story here: In other developments: President Donald Trump has nominated conservative economist EJ Antoni to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the agency that is responsible for collecting and publishing the country’s employment and inflation figures.

On Monday, Trump signed an executive order extending the deadline for higher tariffs on China until 10 November. A federal judge in San Francisco on Monday began hearing evidence and arguments on whether the Trump administration violated federal law when it deployed national guard soldiers and US marines to Los Angeles after protests over immigration raids this summer. The Trump administration federalized California national guard members and sent them to the second-largest US city over the objections of the California governor, Gavin Newsom, and city leaders. Trump previewed his Friday meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, claiming he will know “probably in the first two minutes” whether a peace deal can be made. Trump confirmed that while Volodymyr Zelenskyy wouldn’t be a part of the summit, he would call him first as soon as he saw a “fair deal” for a ceasefire emerge. He also didn’t rule out the possibility of a future trading relationship with Russia. A federal judge rejected on Monday a request from the justice department to unseal the grand jury transcripts relating to the criminal investigation of Ghislaine Maxwell – Jeffrey Epstein’s former girlfriend, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking. The judge wrote that the transcripts could not be released publicly – “casually or promiscuously” – as Trump’s government had pushed for because it would risk “unraveling the foundations of secrecy upon which the grand jury is premised”.
