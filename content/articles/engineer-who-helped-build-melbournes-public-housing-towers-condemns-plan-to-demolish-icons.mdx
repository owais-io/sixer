  An engineer who helped build Melbourne’s public housing towers in the 1960s
  has condemned the Victorian government’s plan to demolish them, saying it is
  expensive, unnecessary and environmentally irresponsible. Gerry Noonan, who
  worked on most of the city’s 44 towers, told a Victorian parliamentary inquiry
  into their redevelopment they should be refurbished and upgraded instead –
  citing the financial cost and carbon impact of demolition and rebuilding. “It
  would be sinful to knock those buildings down. They’re icons,” he told the
  inquiry on Wednesday. The government has claimed the towers are outdated,
  unsafe and energy-inefficient, but Noonan characterised those problems as
  minor and fixable. “I live in a house that was built 155 years ago, as do a
  lot of people in Melbourne, probably even longer than that. You get the odd
  problem, but it’s not a big deal, certainly not to knock the whole building
  down over it,” he said. Under the state government’s plan, announced by the
  then premier Daniel Andrews in September 2023, all 44 towers will be
  demolished and redeveloped by 2051, starting with three occupied towers in
  Flemington and North Melbourne and two unoccupied redbrick towers in Carlton.
  While there will be 10% increased social housing across the sites, only the
  towers in Carlton will return as public housing, thanks to federal funding.
  The rest will be managed by community housing providers, which advocates have
  previously warned the inquiry could lead to higher rents and weaker tenant
  protections. Much of Wednesday’s hearing was focused on the condition of the
  towers, with the minister overseeing the redevelopment, Harriet Shing, telling
  the inquiry despite spending $110m on maintenance each year, the government
  was “swimming against a very strong current of deterioration”. “We want to
  make sure that the housing that we are providing for people is not degraded to
  the point where we have to act with undue haste in a way that doesn’t give
  people choices, because we left it for too long,” Shing said. She described
  the redevelopment as a “very staged, very careful and considered process” that
  will take place over 30 years. She said so far, 88% of residents in the first
  stage had agreed to relocate. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Peta McCammon,
  the department’s secretary, said many towers had failed key standards
  including accessibility, sustainability, ventilation, noise and private open
  space. She said they would be unsafe in the event of fire or earthquake. While
  she conceded some issues could be fixed, she said the cost would “far exceed
  the benefit” and residents would still need to relocate. The department’s
  presentation said pipe walls in some larger towers had eroded from 2mm to as
  thin as 0.2mm, with 52 temporary patches applied in just the past three
  months. About 3,000 units were estimated to be at risk due to failing sewer
  stacks, with Martin McCurry, the asset manager at Homes Victoria, telling the
  inquiry about 20km of sewers “need to be replaced”. He also stressed another
  major concern was concrete spalling, which occurs when concrete surfaces start
  to break away. McCurry said this can become “concrete cancer”, which causes
  the corrosion of the steel reinforcement and weakens the structural integrity
  of the building. “If you’ve got a structure which has durability issues, then
  is it prudent to continue, invest in a structure that has got a remaining life
  of a minimum number of years?” he asked. But Noonan described “concrete
  cancer” as a “piece of cake” to repair. He also rejected the claim that modern
  amenities, such as air conditioning, were required in all units. “In
  Melbourne, you get 10 hot days a year, for God’s sake. You don’t need air
  conditioning,” he said. Noonan also pointed to a report by architecture firm
  of OFFICE, which released a proposal last year to retain and upgrade the
  Flemington estate and build five new mid-rises on existing car parks, saving
  the government $364m. Simon Newport from Homes Victoria, however, said the
  report failed to take into account the need to relocate residents during
  works. Newport confirmed condition reports and cost-benefit analyses had been
  completed but he could not provide them to the committee, as the government
  had asserted executive privilege over the documents. The inquiry heard that
  government has made public just 12 of 146 documents, despite the Greens’
  attempt to compel their publication through the parliament.
