  Ben Stokes paid tribute to the bravery of Chris Woakes as a series during
  which players battled at various stages through broken feet and shattered
  fingers ended with a one‑armed man at the crease, his other arm in a sling,
  enduring obvious agony as England fell seven runs short of victory. Stokes
  said: “That never-say-die, never-back-down attitude we’ve installed in the
  group nearly paid off. It was never going to be a question for him to go out
  there. He was in a lot of discomfort even running between the wickets. “But
  we’ve had Rishabh Pant go out to bat with a broken foot, we’ve had Shoaib
  Bashir bowling, batting and fielding with a broken finger and then we had
  Chris go out there and try and get his team over the line with a quite
  recently dislocated shoulder. “Before he went out I didn’t get a chance to
  give him a tap on the back and say: ‘Go well.’ Coming off it’s obvious what
  would have been said, just: ‘Great effort, unbelievable.’ He just shrugged his
  shoulder and said: ‘I wouldn’t do anything else.’” Stokes, who was ruled out
  of the game with a shoulder injury of his own, pinpointed when Woakes went
  down on the opening day as the moment that decided the match – “It took, I
  don’t know, half a second for a shoulder to pop out and everything just
  completely changed for us there” – but the captain admitted that the six
  catches England dropped during India’s second innings had not helped. “You
  could say those chances we put down did cost us, but back to Headingley where
  we chased down those runs, India dropped quite a few chances and that probably
  did contribute to us winning. Maybe if we did hold on to those chances, things
  could have been a little bit different.” Though the game ended in defeat in
  the adversity of playing most of it a man down, Stokes felt certain players
  demonstrated previously unknown courage. “Some guys will leave this series
  having found out a lot more about themselves,” he said. “In particular, with
  Woakesy going down early on, the responsibility that fell on Gus Atkinson,
  Josh Tongue and Jamie Overton’s shoulders – their roles completely changed
  from why they were selected, the impact we thought they would have on the
  game. They had to dig deep. I think a couple of guys have found out more about
  themselves in a very, very positive way. “They took that responsibility on
  without adding pressure to themselves. They did that in a way of pride – one
  of the boys has gone down and we’re going to have to take on that workload.
  Some people would shy away from that and be worried about what it means for
  them. They showed a lot of courage, a lot of heart. They can be very proud of
  the way they threw themselves into that.” After an appropriately, brutally
  tense conclusion on its 25th day the series will be remembered as a classic,
  with Stokes admitting the final scoreline of 2-2 was “probably fair”. He said:
  “There’s that disappointment and frustration, not to have got the result that
  gives us the series win, but this series has been fantastic to be a part of.
  “It’s been full of ups and downs, ebbs and flows, throughout every game. India
  have been in control, we’ve been in control, it’s gone back to them and then
  it’s come back to us. To be a part of it has been pretty special. “There is
  still that disappointment, but for the wider game, and we want to constantly
  be promoting the game, this series has been great.” At the end of his first
  series as India’s captain, to which he contributed 754 runs and four
  centuries, Shubman Gill said its – and his own – vacillating fortunes had
  demonstrated “how the game of life works”. He said: “There are moments like
  this where you feel the journey is worth it. There’ve been a lot of highs and
  lows and that’s kind of expected in sport. “Every time you go into bat you
  want to perform, you want to score a century, but that’s not how the game of
  life works. You should be able to navigate through the highs and lows of life
  and stay balanced. I want to stay balanced whether we’ve won the match, lost
  the match, I’ve done well or not well. “This morning summarised what this
  team’s all about. The way Brook and Root were going [on Sunday], not many
  teams in the world would have given themselves a chance, but this team
  believes that whenever we have an opening we can get through that opening.
  “That’s what we were saying once Brook was out – this was our opening and you
  never know.”
