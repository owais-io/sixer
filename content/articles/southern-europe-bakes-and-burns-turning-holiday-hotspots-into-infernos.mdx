  Somehow, the heat hits harder when you’re on holiday. Tourists who hoped to
  idle on Croatian beaches this week will have instead singed their feet on
  scorching sand. Families on a break in Madrid will have choked on smoke from a
  deadly wildfire that ripped through a suburb of the Spanish capital. Visitors
  to Mount Vesuvius in Italy will have been turned away from the trails as
  firefighters battled blazes on the volcano’s slopes. And then there are
  campers in south-west France, where 40% of selected weather stations recorded
  heat above 40C on Monday, who may have wished they had stayed home. Fierce
  heat is scorching southern Europe for the second time this summer, breaking
  temperature records and fuelling wildfires that have forced thousands of
  people across several countries to flee their homes. The heatwave, which has
  been made longer and stronger by the blanket of fossil fuel pollution that
  smothers the Earth, has struck during the holiday season when
  tourist-dependent economies in the Mediterranean and the Balkans are most
  exposed to variations in weather. For locals and visitors alike, the formerly
  Instagram-friendly views now seem apocalyptic. Firefighters are tackling
  fierce blazes in countries from Portugal to Turkey, and the infernos are known
  to have killed people in France, Spain, Albania, Montenegro and Greece. Across
  the continent, black smoke is darkening blood-red skies. “We are being cooked
  alive,” said Alexandre Favaios, the mayor of Vila Real, in northern Portugal.
  “This cannot continue.” Wildfires in Europe burned more than 400,000 hectares
  in the first seven months of 2025, according to data published by EU fire
  scientists on Tuesday. Although it is not the worst the continent has seen for
  this time of year, the burned area is 87% greater than the average over the
  last two decades. In the coming week, the scientists warned, “extreme to very
  extreme conditions” for fire weather will persist. They project “particularly
  severe” risks in much of southern Europe, as well as high anomalies in parts
  of the Nordics. “We are at extreme risk of forest fires,” the Spanish prime
  minister Pedro Sánchez warned on Tuesday. “Please be very cautious.” Feeling
  the heat I have felt the fear that wildfires can instil in an absent-minded
  tourist. At a Portuguese friend’s wedding in 2022, by a lake in the rural
  centre of the country, a nearby forest fire forced us to head indoors early so
  helicopters could fill buckets with fresh water to battle the blaze. The next
  day, as we lounged in the outdoor pool of a holiday home, white soot rained
  down on us like snow. The hot ashes had been lifted up by plumes of smoke that
  grew redder and redder as the fire came closer. After some fretting among the
  group, one friend with a newborn baby decided it was time to leave, so we fled
  to the coast. We drove past locals, mostly retired, who stood outside their
  homes and watched in horror as flames drew near. Wildfires kill hundreds of
  people around the world each year – a death toll far lower than that from
  floods, which kill thousands, and from heatwaves, which kill hundreds of
  thousands. But factor in the smoke and the human cost rises rapidly. The
  latest research estimates that the air pollution spewed by wildfires kills a
  staggering 1.5 million people globally each year. There are economic costs,
  too. As southern Europe bakes and burns each summer, tourists who cannot
  travel out of season are starting to abandon traditional holiday destinations
  in favour of “coolcations” farther north that beat the heat. Even that
  strategy will have led to some disappointment this summer. At the start of the
  month, a heatwave hit cool Nordic countries and sent temperatures north of the
  Arctic Circle to a staggering 32-33C. “Truly unprecedented” was how one
  meteorologist described the heatwave. The upshot is that flight shame might
  not be what keeps people from holidaying far from home as the planet heats up.
  Instead, it could be the rising cost of travel as Europe’s once-stable climate
  violently breaks down. This is an edited version of the This is Europe
  newsletter. If you want to read the complete version every Wednesday, please
