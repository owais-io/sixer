  In biblical rain nine months ago, a 4-0 hammering by Tottenham left Manchester
  City tactically shredded and Pep Guardiola devastated at a silenced Etihad
  Stadium 48 hours after he had agreed a fresh two-year contract with the club,
  the manager saying: “I cannot leave.” When Tottenham return to the scene of
  last November’s rout for Saturday’s early kick-off, Guardiola will send out a
  revamped side intent on wiping away the memory of that difficult day, and
  proving he was prudent to extend his tenure. The Spurs reverse was the last of
  a run of five consecutive defeats that featured two other league losses, to
  Bournemouth and Brighton. This was no blip but rather the start of a slump
  that would feature one victory in 13 games in all competitions. The sequence
  all but ended City’s title defence, dumped them out of the Carabao Cup – also
  against Spurs – and included Champions League losses to Sporting and Juventus
  that indicated City European challenge would founder, as it did via a 6-3
  aggregate playoff defeat to Real Madrid. Spurs’ league victory against City
  was the result of them racing with pace on the counterattack. The hosts’
  sluggish rearguard was unable to contain, while James Maddison, who scored
  twice, and Dejan Kulusevski, Son Heung-min, Pedro Porro and Brennan Johnson,
  who each registered once for Ange Postecoglou’s team. “It’s just another
  opportunity – revenge makes no sense,” Guardiola said about Saturday’s
  challenge. “Spurs have always been a tough opponent for us. “What happened is
  in the past. I remember that moment after the international break and we
  already came from two or three bad results and the dynamics started to be not
  good. It’s a new season and new vibes and hopefully it will be like last
  season when we created a lot in the first 20 minutes.” City will almost
  certainly again be without Rodri in the starting lineup as the Spaniard
  continues his recovery from a setback following his return from the knee
  injury that ruled him out for most of the previous campaign. His absence is a
  blow for Guardiola but, then again, his counterpart has his own headaches.
  Thomas Frank arrives in Manchester without Kulusevski and Maddison, both of
  whom are injured, plus, possibly for the same reason, Destiny Udogie and Yves
  Bissouma, who both missed last weekend’s 3-0 win over Burnley. The Dane must
  also revive flatlining morale after Eberechi Eze’s decision to spurn Spurs in
  favour of Arsenal. Guardiola, who may retain James Trafford in goal as Ederson
  continues to consider his future at the club, is in no doubt of Frank’s
  managerial acumen. “Thomas will do a big job like he has at Brentford,” he
  insisted. “He’s a top-class manager [able to utilise] different scenarios and
  different alternatives regarding how they can play. I saw it and suffered it
  when he was at Brentford.” City’s tilt at claiming a fifth title in six
  seasons, and seventh overall of Guardiola’s tenure, began with the opening day
  4-0 humbling of Wolves. Tijjani Reijnders, a summer addition, impressed in an
  all-round goalscoring display that suggested the Dutch midfielder could be key
  to City’s evolution after Kevin De Bruyne’s departure. Along Spurs’ right,
  where Kulusevski ran riot in November, Guardiola can combat any alternative
  threat with the speed and defensive qualities of Rayan Aït-Nouri, another
  summer signing. Then there is Rayan Cherki, another recruit who may well
  provide the X factor that is the hallmark of Guardiola’s best sides. Arriving
  from Lyon, Cherki, who can operate as a No 10 or wide forward, has artistry,
  an ability to score – as he also did at Wolves – and a spiky persona. Erling
  Haaland scored twice at Molineux, suggesting the Norwegian is back to his
  best, yet Frank can be encouraged by his toothlessness in last year’s
  devastating loss. He can study, too, how City crumpled at the Club World Cup
  only two competitive outings ago. Then, in early July, Al-Hilal dumped them
  out of the last 16 as, once more, Guardiola’s high defensive line was exposed
  and his team’s shape disintegrated. Al-Hilal are no leviathan of world
  football and the alarm sounded louder as City’s fragility came on the back of
  a 5-2 trouncing of a continental aristocrat in the shape of Juventus. That,
  too, took place at Orlando’s Camping World Stadium, where afterwards Guardiola
  hailed a return to form of his players. “Everybody gave an incredible
  performance. It has been a long time since we had a performance like this on
  and off the ball,” the Catalan said. “The players were committed and we are
  happy to beat a top side. In the previous two games we won but were miles
  away. I’m really pleased because the players have to realise [and did today]
  what we have to do to get back to what we were the last decade”. That all
  disappeared against Al-Hilal, so the suspicion remains that City are not yet
  who they once were. “I don’t know,” Guardiola says when asked if City are
  back. “I like a lot of things that I’m seeing in training and behaviour. I
  would like to be a magician to know what’s going to happen, but I don’t know.”
