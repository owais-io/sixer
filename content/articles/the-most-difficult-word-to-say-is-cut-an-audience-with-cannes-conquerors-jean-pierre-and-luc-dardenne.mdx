  Earlier this year, the Cannes film festival saw a triumphant new appearance
  from European cinema’s kings of social realism and social conscience. The
  Dardenne brothers, Jean-Pierre and Luc, now 74 and 71, presented a movie that
  is one of their very best: Jeunes Mères or Young Mothers, a deeply
  compassionate, intelligent drama about a home for teen mothers or
  mothers-to-be in the directors’ home town of Liège in Belgium. These young
  women are faced with the existential question: is it sensible to give their
  infants up for adoption, or a fundamental loss of moral courage? The Dardennes
  have become known for intensely naturalist performances and handheld
  camerawork, radical simplicity and clarity. They have won the Cannes Palme
  d’Or twice, firstly for their drama Rosetta in 1999, about a young woman who
  must look after her troubled mother in a trailer park – starring the then
  nonprofessional teenager Émilie Dequenne – and secondly the terrifying,
  faintly Greeneian drama L’Enfant or The Child, from 2005, with Jérémie Renier
  as a petty criminal who gives his own baby away to a “private adoption” broker
  and then desperately tries to get it back. A string of other awards followed
  and with the imminent UK release of Young Mothers, which has incidentally
  earned them yet another prize at Cannes for their bulging silverware cabinet –
  for best screenplay – I logged on for a Zoom chat with the legendary brothers
  who, despite their films’ seriousness, are always infectiously genial, like
  cheerful academics. So how did Young Mothers come about, I ask? Luc replies:
  “We went in to research a maternity home with the idea of one character. Then
  we saw the life there, the five or six young mothers. And this was new for us,
  to envisage a whole group. We were attracted by it. We didn’t want to do a
  choral ensemble piece. We wanted each to have their story. And we decided that
  there would be light at the end of each tunnel. Sometimes a fragile, feeble
  light. But we didn’t want failure.” And the directing? I pointed out to them
  Martin Scorsese’s memory of seeing for the first time a movie by Michael
  Powell and Emeric Pressburger and wondering which of them shouts “Action!” and
  “Cut!” The thought makes both brothers giggle. “Sometimes it is my brother who
  says ‘Cut!’,” says Luc, laughing, “… and sometimes it is I!” “The most
  difficult word to say is ‘Cut!’,” interjects Jean-Pierre, laughing as well,
  and Luc adds: “Sometimes it can be our assistant who says it.” Having
  rehearsed extensively and intimately with the actors, the Dardennes are often
  positioned away from the camera, watching on the monitor and the
  responsibility for the cut will be devolved to this assistant. As for the
  actors: often, the Dardennes have worked with nonprofessionals, such as
  Dequenne and Renier, who then developed professional careers; and sometimes
  they worked with established A-listers such as Marion Cotillard, who got a
  best actress Oscar nomination for her performance in the Dardennes’ workplace
  drama Two Days, One Night. Are the big names directed differently to the
  amateurs? “In terms of this rehearsal, it’s the same for all,” says Luc. “It’s
  then that we find a movement for the camera and start adding detail. Where it
  differs is how we talk to each actor. A professional will have their technique
  and they will know how to use it. They will naturally use their technique.
  They have to learn, to some extent, to forget it. You will have a situation
  where you tell an actor: OK, you light up a cigarette, you drink a coffee and
  read the newspaper. A professional will do it quite sleekly, but those little
  actions might completely overwhelm a nonprofessional.” Jean-Pierre says that
  improvisation is not what they do: “We rehearse a lot, we rehearse four to
  five weeks, but we leave some sort of leeway because the actors don’t have
  marks on the floors. No scene is ever exactly the same. The key is
  imprecision.” He adds, grinning: “What is the Italian word? Sfumatura! Hazy
  nuance and shade.” This approach is most important in working with children
  and teens who are so important to the Dardennes’ films, such the radicalised
  schoolkid in Young Ahmed from 2019, and the exploited refugees in Tori and
  Lokita from 2022. Luc says: “There is something of themselves that is always
  there. And we want that. If they just want to look down, they will look down
  and they are resisting the camera. Our model is Abbas Kiarostami. It’s how he
  directs. He lets them be.” I raise the sad and painful subject of Dequenne, an
  iconic actor for the Dardennes who gave a luminous performance at the age of
  17 in Rosetta and died of cancer in March at the age of 43. Jean-Pierre says
  soberly: “It is very hard for us to talk about Émilie. Our very first memory
  that we will always cherish is when we first shot with her with the whole
  crew. On the very first day, we felt that the crew was drawn to her. Émilie
  bound us together and even she wasn’t aware of it. And then she went on to
  have a very varied and accomplished career and … all too short a life.” The
  political and social dimensions of the Dardennes’ films are often discussed,
  but less so their fierce, almost eerily spiritual elements; they are gritty
  parables of good and evil, with an almost Catholic emphasis on mother and
  child. Luc approaches the subject warily: “I would call it spiritual realism.
  We work from a social situation. But we don’t push it forward. It’s as if God
  is disappearing and it’s art’s responsibility to show, to lead, to guide. But
  never making a sermon.” Then there is the question of who guided the brothers
  themselves to work together in film? In school, says Jean-Pierre, there was a
  teacher who introduced them to cinema; he does not dwell on fact that the
  teacher was a priest: “He had a cine club and showed us many films: Bresson,
  Godard, Truffaut, Bergman, Bertolucci, Ken Loach. This triggered something.
  But at 17, we still didn’t think, oh one day we will make films together.” The
  vital moment came as they were working as assistants to the French theatre and
  cinema director Armand Gatti, who one day simply left these twentysomethings
  in charge while he went off to Germany to direct a play. The Dardennes picked
  up the clunky, but serviceable Sony Portapak cameras and made rough-and-ready
  documentaries in wobbly black and white. But it is at the end of our
  conversation that Jean-Pierre and Luc reveal their most compelling influence:
  their formidable mother, Marie-Josée. Luc says: “Our mother was a singer in
  the village. An operetta singer, singing in the Walloon dialect. And that she
  did for 20 years. She liked to sing for us. She sat us all down in front of
  her on the couch. She did a performance – I like to say she was our first
  actress!” The Dardennes also have two sisters: Marie-Claire, a theatrical
  props maker, and Bernadette, a nurse. During their childhood, the Dardenne
  brothers’ great passion, like so many other teen boys of that era, was for
  their tape recorder. Luc used it to record radio commentaries on the local
  football team he loved, Standard Liège, and the cheeky brothers sneakily
  recorded family conversations by hiding the device under the dinner table and
  playing it back afterwards – an early example of documentary realism. And
  their father, Lucien, was he influential? Luc replies: “He was very severe. He
  was in the resistance during the war and afterwards an industrial designer in
  steelworks. He painted a little in his youth.” Finally, I ask if they may ever
  make films separately, as the Coen brothers do? The question makes Luc laugh:
  “No! But our only disagreement – and you have to have one – is that I have an
  idea for a film but he doesn’t like it. He doesn’t want it. He’s scared
  because it’s a historical thing. It’s about the Spanish Inquisition. But …”
  Luc shrugs and Jean-Pierre shrugs as well, amiably. I point out that Robert
  Bresson made historical work. “When Bresson does a historical film it’s not
  his best …” says Jean-Pierre quickly. “But his Trial of Joan of Arc is very
  powerful,” replies Luc. Perhaps the Dardennes’ film about the Spanish
  Inquisition will never get made. Their togetherness is of paramount
  importance. As Luc puts it: “It’s good to be together to resist criticism – to
  face the critics together.” • Young Mothers is in UK cinemas from 29 August
