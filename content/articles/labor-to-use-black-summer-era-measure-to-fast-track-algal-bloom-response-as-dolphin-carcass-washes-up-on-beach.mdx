  Scientists have called for urgent funding for recovery measures for species
  affected by a catastrophic algal bloom off South Australia as images emerged
  of a dead dolphin that washed up on a beach in Adelaide. The call comes in
  response to an Albanese government announcement that it would fast-track an
  expert assessment of the impact of the crisis on marine life, similar to a
  step taken after the black summer bushfire crisis. The South Australian
  National Parks and Wildlife Service collected the deceased adult common
  dolphin on Wednesday morning from Henley beach, with a necropsy to determine
  the cause of death – including any potential links to the toxic algal bloom
  that has killed tens of thousands of marine animals. The dolphin death was not
  the first to be recorded since the bloom began in March. Others have been
  recorded at Grange beach, west of the city, and at Carrickalinga, about an
  hour’s drive south of Adelaide. But experts have told Guardian Australia that
  while the effects of the algae were not fully understood, mammals were not
  believed to be at immediate risk of death from the algal bloom because they do
  not have gills. The environment minister, Murray Watt, and opposition leader,
  Sussan Ley, both visited Adelaide on Wednesday to see the impacts of the
  bloom. Following calls by the scientist-led Biodiversity Council and
  conservation groups, Watt said the government had asked the threatened species
  scientific committee to consider whether any marine species require assessment
  for potential listing as a nationally threatened species as a result of the
  algal bloom. • Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s
  Clear Air column as a free newsletter The approach is similar to that adopted
  by Ley as environment minister in the aftermath of the black summer fires in
  2019-20. As the minister during that crisis, Ley also oversaw an additional
  $200m in funding for wildlife recovery and emergency measures. The
  Biodiversity Council chief executive, James Trezise, said similarly urgent
  funding for recovery and emergency interventions for species would be needed
  on top of the $28m state and federal package already announced to help
  communities deal with the crisis. “We saw the federal government mobilise
  hundreds of millions of dollars for wildlife recovery during the black summer
  fires,” he said. “We need to see the same urgency in responding to this
  wildlife crisis alongside supporting impacted businesses. “We don’t know the
  full-scale impacts yet, but significant investment in species and habitat
  recovery will be needed.” Citizen scientists tracking the effects of the algal
  bloom on marine life have recorded more than 26,000 dead sea creatures from
  more than 450 species. While mainly fishes, rays and molluscs, records also
  include mammals and birds such as little penguins and dolphins. Humane World
  for Animals (formerly Humane Society International) and the Australian Marine
  Conservation Society wrote to Watt in July urging immediate conservation
  intervention for three species they considered most at risk: the great white
  shark, already a nationally listed threatened species, the coastal stingaree
  and the pygmy thornback skate. “These and other vulnerable species are found
  in exactly the waters hit hardest by the bloom, and already under pressure
  from fishing and habitat loss,” said Lawrence Chlebeck, a marine biologist
  with Humane World for Animals. “Without urgent targeted conservation action,
  we risk losing them for ever.” Dr Michael Bossley, a marine biologist who is
  based in Adelaide and specialises in dolphins, said dead dolphins did wash up
  in the area from time to time, and so far the bloom had not had any pronounced
  impact on the numbers reported. “It doesn’t seem as if [the algal bloom]
  causes any fatalities to marine mammals. So, dolphins, seals and so forth – as
  far as we can tell – don’t get killed directly, like fish do.” While still not
  well understood, the harmful algae – known as Karenia mikimotoi – was thought
  to produce a reactive oxygen that caused gill cell damage in fish, which meant
  they could not breathe. Bossley said there had been a concern that animals
  such as dolphins could face food shortages with so many fish dying. But he
  said the dolphin that washed up on Wednesday appeared to be in good condition;
  not emaciated. A spokesperson for the SA environment department said: “Marine
  mammals such as whales, dolphins and seals are not believed to be at immediate
  risk from the algal bloom as it is believed only animals with gills are at
  immediate direct risk.” Guardian Australia has sought comment from Watt. •
