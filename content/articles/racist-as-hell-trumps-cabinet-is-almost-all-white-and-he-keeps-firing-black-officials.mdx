  A day after Donald Trump announced that he was firing Lisa Cook, the first
  Black woman to serve on the board of governors of the Federal Reserve, the
  White House proudly released a photo. It showed Trump, his cabinet and other
  officials giving a thumbs-up. Of the 24 people in the Oval Office, only one
  was Black. For those who have studied the US president’s long and troubling
  history of racism, the two events were more than mere coincidence. They were
  indicative of a man who has recently brought white nationalist perspectives
  from the margins back to the mainstream. Trump has vehemently denied that he
  is a racist, pointing to a modest increase in support among African American
  voters in last year’s election, when his opponent was a Black woman. But
  critics suggest that his effort to oust Cook fits a pattern of purging diverse
  voices from the higher ranks of leadership. “He chose to fire her out of all
  the governors because she’s a Black woman,” said LaTosha Brown, co-founder of
  the organisation Black Voters Matter. “His goal is to get control of the
  Federal Reserve and for that to no longer be an autonomous, independent body.
  But what he does recognise is that in America everything is about race. It is
  as lethal as a nuclear bomb.” Cook taught economics and international
  relations at Michigan State University, and was previously on the faculty of
  Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government. She was a Marshall scholar
  who received degrees from Oxford University and Spelman College, a
  historically Black women’s college in Atlanta. Cook dedicated much of her
  scholarship to examining how racial discrimination and targeted violence
  created barriers to economic advancement for African Americans. She also
  advised the Nigerian and Rwandan governments on banking reforms and economic
  development. In 2022 she was confirmed to the Fed’s board of governors by the
  Senate in a party-line vote. Republicans argued that she was unqualified and
  found her research overly focused on race; Democrats brushed off such
  critiques as unfounded. On Monday, Trump said he fired Cook after the director
  of a housing regulatory agency, whom the president appointed, alleged that she
  committed mortgage fraud. She refused to resign and filed a lawsuit claiming
  that Trump has no power to remove her from office. Trump’s order aligned with
  his effort to expand his power across once independent parts of the federal
  government and broader economy and culture. It also marked another potential
  high-profile removal of a Black leader from the federal government amid
  Trump’s broader crusade against diversity and inclusion policies. Brown
  observed: “He knows that racism and sexism is a very effective tool to cast
  doubt and that’s the pathway. Lisa Cook isn’t even the chair of the board. So
  why would you pick her? “He picked her because he is betting that, in an
  industry that is probably 90% or more white male, his odds of removing her are
  greater than the odds for removing others from the board. That in itself is
  rooted in the history and how insidious racism is built into the fabric of how
  we see people of colour in this country.” Over the past seven months Trump has
  targeted other prominent Black leaders. He fired Gen Charles Q Brown Jr, chair
  of the joint chiefs of staff, the second Black man to serve in the position.
  Brown had delivered speeches about racial discrimination and issued policies
  that promoted diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes in the
  military. The president dismissed Carla Hayden, the first Black person to
  serve as librarian of Congress, after a conservative advocacy organisation
  accused her of being a “radical”. He ousted Gwynne Wilcox, the first Black
  woman to sit on the National Labor Relations Board, which hears private-sector
  labour disputes. Trump’s critics argue that his life and career have given
  succour to white supremacists. In 1973 he and his father were sued for housing
  discrimination in New York; in 1989 he took out full-page ads in several
  newspapers calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, Black and
  Latino youths who were later exonerated. Trump broke through in national
  politics with the “birther” conspiracy theory, falsely claiming that Barack
  Obama was not born in the US and therefore ineligible to be president. After a
  2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Trump said there
  were “very fine people on both sides”. He has reportedly described Haiti and
  African nations as “shithole countries”, has called Covid-19 the “Chinese
  virus” and “kung flu”, and, on the campaign trail last year, said immigrants
  were “poisoning the blood of our country”, echoing the rhetoric of Adolf
  Hitler. Since returning to the White House, Trump has imposed a travel ban on
  many of the world’s poorest countries even as the US granted refugee status to
  about 50 white South Africans, claiming they were victims of racial
  persecution and “white genocide”. He issued executive orders to curb DEI
  initiatives in the federal government and even sought to blame DEI for an air
  crash. He is seeking to purge “divisive, race-centered ideology” from
  Smithsonian Institution museums, suggesting that there is too much focus on
  “how bad Slavery was”. The attempt to fire Cook is the most dubious move yet,
  prompting an outcry from Democrats and civil rights groups, who pointed to her
  gender and race as vital factors. Congresswoman Nanette Barragán of California
  posted on the X social media platform: “If you haven’t noticed yet – this is a
  disturbing pattern for Trump. Fire or drive out smart, competent women, in
  particular women of color, from high ranking positions and fill many of these
  positions with white men.” Derrick Johnson, president and chief executive of
  the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), said:
  “Dr Cook’s credentials outshine Trump’s entire cabinet. This president simply
  cannot stomach Black excellence when it reveals his failures, particularly
  those in positions of power. In reality, this is about bending the Federal
  Reserve to Trump’s will, and he’s using racism as a tool to do it.” But
  Trump’s actions are being cheered on by white nationalists. Far-right groups
  such as the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys have been quoted as saying that they
  no longer need to take to the streets to demonstrate because the president has
  so comprehensively adopted their talking points and embraced their agenda.
  Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist, observed: “When you have white
  supremacists who are holding key roles in government and you have leaders in
  this country who come and play footsie to their drumbeat they don’t have to
  resist because what they want is laid out for them in the form of a buffet.”
  Trump has been quick to point to Black allies when politically expedient, such
  as Tim Scott, the South Carolina senator, the representative Byron Donalds of
  Florida and Alveda King, a niece of the civil rights leader Martin Luther
  King. But critics note there is no guarantee this will translate to policies
  that address racial injustice. Nor has it manifested in significant
  representation at the heart of government. Towards the end of the first Trump
  presidency, the Washington Post identified 59 people who had held cabinet
  positions or served in top White House jobs. Only seven were people of colour
  and only one – the housing secretary, Ben Carson – was Black. In his second
  term, Trump has picked only one Black person to serve in his cabinet: Scott
  Turner, the secretary of housing and urban development. Joe Biden, by
  contrast, appointed the most diverse cabinet in history with more women and
  people of colour than any that had come before. Seawright said: “We went from
  generational progress to generational rollback, and what this president and
  this administration has done in seven months could take 70 years at least to
  replenish. It should be a friendly reminder for all people, but particularly
  African Americans, that all progress is not permanent.” Trump’s cabinet
  includes Pete Hegseth, a former Fox News host with no experience of running a
  major organisation, at the Pentagon; Robert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine sceptic,
  at the health department; and Linda McMahon, a former professional wrestling
  executive, at the education department. The White House deputy chief of staff,
  Stephen Miller, has associated with white nationalist thinkers and groups and
  is the architect of his hardline immigration policy. Rashad Robinson, a civil
  rights leader and former president of the group Color of Change, added: “We
  live in a very diverse country, a country with many different types of people
  that come from many different backgrounds, and the president exhibits his
  values by who he puts in office. “This is not simply that Donald Trump has put
  only one Black person in his cabinet. It’s that Donald Trump has gone out of
  his way to find some of the most unqualified and ill-equipped people to put in
  those jobs as a way to actually avoid having to put Black people in his
  cabinet.” For Brown, the voting rights activist, Trump’s cabinet picks
  demonstrate that he is “as racist as hell”. She added: “Quite frankly, I’m
  glad he doesn’t have a whole lot of Black people in his cabinet because that
  would be deeply embarrassing to me. Who would work in that mess?”
