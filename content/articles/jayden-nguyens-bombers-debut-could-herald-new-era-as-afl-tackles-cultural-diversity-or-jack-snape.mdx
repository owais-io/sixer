  The first AFL men’s player with a Vietnamese background, Essendon’s Jayden
  Nguyen, held his own against Sydney star Tom Papley on Saturday. Despite the
  Bombers’ 14-point defeat, Nguyen’s appearance was an important milestone for a
  game still struggling to come to terms with its place within multicultural
  Australia. The 19-year-old, whose parents arrived in Australia in the 1980s,
  said he hoped he had made others proud. “I’m pretty rapt with the support I’ve
  got over the past few days from the Vietnamese community, and the Asian
  community in general,” Nguyen said after the match. “I just feel like it helps
  push me and makes me feel proud about myself.” Quang Huynh, a
  Vietnamese-Australian working in Aussie rules, watched Nguyen’s debut with
  interest. “Jayden’s great for the community, just seeing, hearing his story
  and his journey,” said Huynh, who works at the Western Bulldogs Community
  Foundation. “Hopefully this opens up the opportunity for more Vietnamese boys
  and girls to play.” The AFL will shortly launch a cultural diversity action
  plan which, as well as highlighting the game’s geographic regions of priority,
  has a broad goal to increase participation and engagement within
  non-traditional football communities. Despite the potential power of the AFL
  as an inclusive force, it remains to some a source of hate and division. The
  AFL issued an apology to Swans champion Adam Goodes in 2019 for failing to
  support him in a period he was targeted by repeated booing and the behaviour
  of abusive fans on social media remains a blight on the game. Last year a
  University of South Australia and University Technology Sydney survey found
  50% of AFL match-goers had witnessed racist “barracking” such as name-calling,
  compared to 36% of NRL fans and 27% of those at the A-Leagues. Supporters in
  all sports reported the situation had worsened in recent years. These
  experiences highlight the importance of the AFL’s new action plan, due to be
  launched in coming weeks. In it, chief executive Andrew Dillon writes “while
  significant progress has been made in making our game more inclusive, we
  recognise there is still work to do.” The plan is designed to take the game to
  new audiences, but Huynh’s work at the Western Bulldogs Community Foundation
  sees the AFL from the opposite perspective. Their imperative is not to grow
  participation, it is to leverage the power of Australian rules to bring
  together people new to the country or those still on its periphery. As a
  multicultural community engagement coordinator, Huynh helps run a health
  program in languages including Vietnamese and Hindi, which has included
  attending matches with hundreds of AFL novices. “We give our participants a
  beanie, a scarf, and we catch the train with them there,” Huynh said. “We get
  off at Southern Cross station and we walk to gate seven at Marvel, and you can
  feel the excitement because you have people looking around and you see that
  everyone’s cheering. For someone who’s newly arrived or been here for a while,
  that sense of, ‘We have something in common, we support the Bulldogs,’ it’s a
  really great thing.” The AFL’s action plan promises to introduce new school
  and community programs in 21 targeted local government areas around the
  country, including five in western Sydney. The plan is light, only eight
  pages, but sets out the guiding principles for the code’s efforts in this
  space, including co-design, intersectionality and an appreciation that for
  some communities progress “will be a long journey”. This week staff
  responsible for the work met in western Sydney for an education and training
  workshop, and the first programs – including a multicultural one in Dandenong
  and another with the Chinese community in Perth – have already begun. “By
  continuing to listen, learn, and evolve, we can build on the foundations
  already in place to create an environment where all cultures feel respected
  and represented,” Dillon said. The workshop coincides with a historic week for
  Asian-Australian followers of the game. In addition to the debut of Nguyen
  last Saturday, Hindi commentary was provided by Fox Footy for the Western
  Bulldogs v GWS Giants clash last Thursday. Mandarin will be heard on coverage
  of the Brisbane v Sydney match this Saturday. Barney Yu Xia, a payroll officer
  by day, will sit behind the mic alongside Agnes Yao Lu, having been involved
  in community broadcasting and in-language coverage of football. He moved to
  Australia from Hefei in China in 2012 to study media, but wasn’t drawn to AFL
  until he met another Melburnian in a public toilet in Cairns in 2015. “We were
  washing our hands, and he said, ‘Where were you from?’ I said ‘I’m from
  Melbourne’ and he was like ‘Okay … Melbourne. Western Bulldogs? I was like, ‘I
  have no idea’,” he said. “But I thought that people living in Melbourne should
  understand Australian rules. That’s how I got into it, and then I started to
  like it.”
