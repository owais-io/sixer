  CHEERS, SON’S CRYING Due in no small part to their peerless work in the field
  of curing the ills of struggling and out-of-sorts opponents in need of a
  fillip, few Spurs fans would be sorry to see the back of Dr Tottenham if he
  ever decides to leave their club. But on Sunday in Seoul, during a pre-season
  friendly between the Bigger Vase champions and Newcastle, there was scarcely a
  dry eye in the house as Tottenham and their South Korean supporters’ branch
  bade an emotional farewell to a player who, over the past decade, has to all
  intents and purposes become Mr Tottenham. Substituted after 65 minutes of the
  1-1 draw, an emotional Son Heung-min received warm hugs and a guard of honour
  from both his teammates and the players of Newcastle before retiring to the
  substitutes’ bench for a little weep. After 10 years of service, one of the
  most popular, high-performance and low-maintenance players to ever grace the
  Premier League is off to ply his trade in MLS with LAFC and an English
  football landscape so often synonymous with spittle-flecked and snarling rage
  will be considerably poorer for the absence of his trademark beatific beam. “I
  didn’t think I was going to cry at first but after hearing a few words from my
  teammates, leaving the club I’ve spent so much time with felt really tough,”
  he sobbed. “I felt really, really happy playing this match. Thanks to my fans,
  my teammates and also my opponents, I’ve had an unforgettable day. My career
  is not over yet, and I want to continue to bring joy. I know I have more
  things I want to accomplish as a football player.” In his 454 appearances for
  Spurs, the man they call Son accomplished plenty. He scored 173 goals and
  provided 101 assists but such metrics don’t come even close to measuring his
  contribution to the club’s cause. On the pitch a graceful, lightning fast
  predator with the cold eye of an assassin, Son lifted Tottenham’s first trophy
  in 16 years last season and at other points during his time in north London,
  won a Puskás Award and shared a golden boot. In arguably his greatest act of
  personal selflessness for the benefit of the greater Tottenham Hotspur good,
  he also made a complete dog’s breakfast of that one-on-one with Manchester
  City goalkeeper Stefan Ortega to deny Arsenal the title two seasons ago. Off
  the pitch, it has long been apparent that Son is that rare breed of elite
  footballer who few people, except perhaps Arsenal fans in whose collective
  side he has been a constant thorn, has a bad word to say about. Among those
  shedding salty tears in Seoul was Ben Davies, the similarly long-serving Spurs
  player who is so close to the departing South Korean that – try saying this
  without slurring after a skinful – his son is Son’s godson. “I saw my good
  friend Ben Davies cry,” said Son in the post-match interview. “Seeing him
  tearing up with his eyes going all red made me feel sorry and thankful at the
  same time. A mixture of feelings really but as the godfather of his son, I
  need to strive for more, to make my godson proud.” While Son’s rigid adherence
  to his duties as a moral guardian are to be commended, Football Daily is
  prepared to wager that as long as he remembers to pony up the obligatory
  readies each and every birthday, Davies Jr is unlikely to give two hoots
  whether or not he ever kicks a football again. “Sonny is Tottenham and
  Tottenham is Sonny,” declared James Maddison before the friendly, a game in
  which the midfielder was carried off the field on a stretcher after suffering
  a bad case of knee-knack. “It’s weird to think about Tottenham Hotspur without
  Son.” For those who continue to pass in and out of the gates of the Spurs
  training complex, it will also be weird not to see the small gaggle of South
  Koreans who regularly convene on the Enfield outskirts hoping to get a smile,
  a kind word or a selfie as Son comes and goes from training. Exceedingly rare
  were the days, by all accounts, when the subject of their unbridled adoration
  failed to oblige them. QUOTE OF THE DAY We didn’t want to finish [our USA USA
  USA tour] in this way. Our performance wasn’t the best and we were a little
  bit lazy today. We want to avoid that because with laziness you can pay at any
  moment. [The squad’s quality] is improving. But it’s not the place it needs to
  be. It was crystal clear we needed more competition... hopefully we can get
  one or two players more” – Bruno Fernandes warms up for the new season with a
  familiarly downbeat refrain about Manchester United after a 2-2 draw with
  similarly underpowered Everton in Atlanta. They did win the Premier League
  Summer Series, mind. So cheer up, Bruno. FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS If ever the
  Ineos Grenadiers’ head carer needed evidence that he wasn’t involved in any
  performance enhancement shenanigans (Friday’s News, Bits and Bobs, full email
  edition), working at Manchester United last year should prove it beyond
  reasonable doubt” – Jim Hearson. I see Norwich have signed midfielder Mirko
  Topic. Does he come with a hazelnut in every biting tackle?” – Darian Boyd. If
  you have any, please send letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. Today’s winner
