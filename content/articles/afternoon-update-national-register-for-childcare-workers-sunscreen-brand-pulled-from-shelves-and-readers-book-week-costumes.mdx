  Good afternoon. Childcare workers will be put on a national register in a
  sweeping safety overhaul of the sector that includes a CCTV trial at hundreds
  of centres, mobile phone bans and mandatory staff training. Federal, state and
  territory education ministers met in Sydney on Friday and agreed to major
  changes in the childcare and early education sectors. The federal education
  minister, Jason Clare, said the CCTV trial would begin in October or November
  and run at 300 centres across the country. The trial will consider who holds
  the data and how the data is stored. The safety training regime for childcare
  employees will be rolled out early next year. “Is it everything that we need
  to do? No, of course it’s not – but it’s the next thing that we must do,”
  Clare said. The commonwealth will put $189m towards the reforms, and work will
  begin immediately. Top news Australian doctors subjected to vexatious
