  “I think the world has just changed,” Noel Clarke told the judge while giving
  evidence in his libel case against the Guardian. “I think we can all agree
  that things that were acceptable 10, 20 years ago are just no longer
  acceptable.” While the actor also vehemently denied many of the claims against
  him, that, in essence, was one of the arguments he presented to the court. He
  was the victim. Twenty-six witnesses who gave testimony against him over the
  course of a five-week trial, including women who described all manner of
  bullying, and professional and sexual misconduct, painted a very different
  picture. In Friday’s high court ruling, the judge who presided over the case,
  Mrs Justice Steyn, came down clearly in favour of Clarke’s accusers. The
  Guardian ran two defences: that the articles about Clarke’s sexual misconduct
  were true, and that their publication was in the public interest. Steyn found
  overwhelmingly in favour of the Guardian on both counts. In contrast, she
  found Clarke was “not a credible or reliable witness”, concluding that he was
  “untruthful about most of the allegations, in his efforts to salvage his
  career”. Clarke’s claims of conspiracy In his legal action over the Guardian’s
  articles accusing him of sexual misconduct, the former Doctor Who actor
  decried a “blanket [modern] lens” being cast on past actions. Dance moves at
  the Notting Hill carnival would be considered “assault” in other cultures, he
  said, and anyone his age who went to university would know that “uni lads and
  things, people get crazy and the things that happened back in those days would
  not be acceptable now”. It was a theme echoed by Philip Williams in closing
  submissions, in which Clarke’s barrister highlighted the Benny Hill and Little
  Britain series as productions that would now be considered “inappropriate” as
  he said Clarke had been a victim of “historical revisionism”. But
  inappropriate sexual comments – or “banter” as Clarke sometimes referred to
  them – was just one of the accusations he faced in the Guardian’s reporting
  and defence of the case. Others included bullying, taking and sharing explicit
  videos and photographs without consent and unwanted sexual contact. Attempting
  to rebut the accusations, Clarke, the first witness on the stand, ran a
  variety of arguments, which included flat denial that most events ever took
  place and that his female accusers had consensually participated in and/or
  initiated behaviour he was being blamed for. Clarke also alleged a conspiracy
  between people who had grudges against him, who had either collaborated with
  the Guardian’s journalists or duped them, saying his nine-year-old son had
  made “a little chart” showing the connections between his accusers. In her
  judgment, Steyn unequivocally dismissed such claims. She found the evidence of
  sexual misconduct made by the women who gave evidence in court – and even one
  who was unable to – to be true. Clarke’s conspiracy claim, the judge
  concluded, was “born of necessity, in the face of the large body of witnesses
  giving evidence against him”. The notion that Guardian journalists had engaged
  in a conspiracy, she ruled, was “unfounded and meritless”. During his
  testimony, he at times laughed off accusations but also wept and showed
  flashes of anger towards the Guardian for having “smashed my life”. He
  appeared ruffled when he noticed that one of his accusers, the Gangs of London
  actor Jing Lusi, was watching him give evidence, and questioned whether it was
  allowed (it was). Clarke spent more than three-and-a-half days in the witness
  box, longer than all of the other witnesses his legal team called on his
  behalf combined. This was partly because they were mostly character witnesses
  who could not directly contradict the accusations against him. The most
  notable exception was the testimony of the actor Louise Dylan, who said that
  an allegation that Clarke had groped her at a wrap party was untrue. The
  allegation, by Clarke’s former creative partner Davie Fairbanks, had never
  been reported by the Guardian in any of the published articles. It was brought
  into the libel claim by the Guardian’s inclusion of it in its amended defence
  as an example of behaviour by Clarke that supported the meaning of the
  articles. The judge accepted that Clarke did not grope Dylan, but found
  Fairbanks to be a credible witness who honestly believed the incident that he
  recounted, but initially misdescribed the location of the incident. Other
  witnesses called by Clarke’s legal team were limited to attesting that they
  had never personally seen him engage in inappropriate behaviour or, following
  in the footsteps of his evidence, casting aspersions on the character of his
  accusers. His wife, Iris, claimed that Gina Powell, a film producer and
  documentary maker who worked for her husband from 2014 to 2017, was a liar who
  was “infatuated by him”. She said of Fairbanks: “Not that I have anything
  against it, but he smokes a lot of weed. He is self-destructive.” She was
  unrestrained in her anger at his accusers and the Guardian, sarcastically
  referring to its staff in court as “our lovely people in the back there”.
  Philip Dore, a childhood friend of Clarke who worked for his production
  company Unstoppable from 2014 to 2015, told the court he saw Powell “grope”
  Clarke, who wrote and produced the Kidulthood trilogy, at a film premiere.
  Gavin Millar KC, representing the Guardian, challenged the use of the word
  “grope” in light of Dore describing it variously as “friendly” and Powell
  “having playfully touched his arse” but the witness insisted it was accurate.
  Clarke’s eight witnesses (excluding himself) were done and dusted within
  two-and-a-half days. Another six who were anticipated to give oral evidence
  did not do so. One of them was Arnold Oceng, who appeared in Clarke’s films
  Brotherhood and Adulthood. When he could not be traced, a witness summons was
  issued and Steyn warned that he could face contempt of court proceedings if he
  did not show, but to no avail. ‘Shock and shame’: the testimony of the women
  The trial then moved on to the Guardian’s two defences: that the allegations
  in the articles were true and that they were in the public interest. The 29
  “truth” witnesses included 21 key witnesses who said they had experienced
  misconduct by Clarke themselves or directly witnessed it. They were mostly
  women, some of whom were granted anonymity and two of whom – Powell and Naome
  Morris – gave evidence from behind a screen. Much of the evidence spoke to the
  specific allegations contained in the Guardian’s reporting but there were also
  accusations never previously published. One of the witnesses, Imogen*, said
  she was a “wide-eyed” 20-year-old actor and huge Doctor Who fan when she met a
  “sexually threatening” Clarke for dinner at Soho House in central London in
  July 2014. She said she told Clarke she was 17 in the hope it would deter him
  from talking about sex. It did not work; he suggested they go to his flat to
  have sex and that he could take photos of it. Also not previously published
  was the allegation by Penelope* that Clarke got an erection when filming a sex
  scene with her and touched her with his penis at the entry to her vagina. In
  her witness statement, she said: “When he first took down his trousers and
  pants, I felt his penis land on my pubic area. I tried to move myself up in
  the bed slightly so there would be distance between our genitals, but then his
  penis was touching me in between my legs right at the entry of my vagina. “He
  was so close that I recall being worried in case he moved in further or
  ejaculated.” Some witnesses were asked by Philip Williams, representing
  Clarke, why they had not told anyone about their allegations when they
  happened. Penelope said it was because she felt “shock and shame”. Williams
  also questioned several women about why they would not just leave situations
  they were uncomfortable with, whether filming sex scenes or being
  propositioned in a restaurant, and why in some cases they kept working with
  Clarke or stayed in contact with him afterwards. In response, they pointed to
  the sexual politics of the industry and the importance, as women, of not
  making enemies. Powell, who faced questioning from Williams about her sexual
  history and experience, and Johannah Whyte, an actor and digital content
  creator, whose stage name is Jahannah James, both claimed Clarke kept naked
  photos of women he had sex with as “collateral” in case they ever wanted to
  speak out about him or tell his wife. In her witness statement, Powell said
  that in a car on the way to a meeting, Clarke “grabbed me in the genitals,
  through my dress and underwear” and then told her she did not “deserve” to go
  into the meeting and should wait outside. When Williams asked her why she did
  not email Clarke afterwards to say that he had gone too far, Powell said she
  was in shock. “It felt like I was trying to leave an abusive relationship,”
  she said. Powell, Whyte and Lusi all told the court that Clarke used the
  example of Adam Deacon, his former mentee, who was convicted in 2015 of
  harassing Clarke, as a cautionary tale of what happened to those who crossed
  him. Imogen said: “It was pre-#MeToo. It was pre women standing up for
  themselves. I have never seen a woman stand up for themselves and it go
  successfully. At the end of the day, the industry is so fickle, it can turn in
  an instant. There is an element where everybody is scared of stuff like this
  and [that’s] why I had never spoke up about it. I was not in the Guardian
  article, I chickened out, I was too frightened.” It emerged that Imogen had
  been sent a legal letter by solicitors for Clarke last year, only two months
  before the pre-trial hearings were due to begin, which Millar said threatened
  her with prosecution for circulating allegations about him. Millar argued it
  was “witness intimidation” but this was denied by Clarke, who said he was just
  trying to get her to switch sides. “It is not uncommon for people to play for
  one football team and then play for another football team,” he said. “It
  happens. You get transferred and that was the intention.” Fairbanks provided
  the most dramatic moment of the trial. He said he had found a cache of 15
  pictures of Ivy* on his hard drive that, he claimed, Clarke had sent him. Ivy
  told the court she had never seen the images previously and believed they were
  taken without consent. The judge found that Ivy’s answer was an honest one but
  that she probably knew and consented to Clarke taking those photographs.
  Williams described it as an “ambush” and accused Fairbanks of seeking to
  pervert the course of justice. When Clarke was recalled to address this
  specific issue he denied sending the photos to Fairbanks, whom he accused of
  stealing them. Clarke said the photos were consensual, he took them for
  “aesthetic” reasons and eventually would have deleted them if they had not
  been stolen by Fairbanks. During testy exchanges with Millar, Clarke initially
  said Fairbanks had “all levels of access [to his devices]”, sometimes posting
  on Twitter, now X, for him, but when Millar asked if this was appropriate
  given that he stored naked pictures on his laptop in a folder that was not
  password-protected, Clarke said Fairbanks only had access for “emergencies”.
  While cross-examining Fairbanks, Williams initially suggested he had stolen
  the photos with the idea of weaponising them. But given they had still been
  friends when they were allegedly stolen, Clarke said Fairbanks had initially
  taken them “for his own sexual and perverse gratification” and only after they
  fell out decided to retain them for use against him. The Guardian in the
  spotlight After Clarke’s second time on the stand, it was the turn of the
  Guardian’s journalists, including Lucy Osborne and Sirin Kale, who wrote the
  story together, the Guardian’s head of investigations, Paul Lewis, who oversaw
  it, and the editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, who ultimately signed off on it.
  The deputy editor, Owen Gibson, and the head of audio, Nicole Jackson, also
  gave evidence. They faced questions about the deletion of Signal messages
  journalists had exchanged relating to the investigation, which had already
  formed the basis of an unsuccessful attempt to strike out the Guardian’s
  defence before trial. Dismissing that application, Steyn had found that the
  claim made by Williams that, in deleting the messages, the Guardian had
  fabricated evidence and perverted the course of justice was “a grave
  allegation [that] should not have been made and publicly aired without
  foundation”. She found the deletions were in accordance with the Guardian’s
  data minimisation policy, but that did not stop Williams revisiting the issue
  during the trial, accusing Lewis of trying to “hide the evidence”. Lewis
  responded that the messages in question were “micro-level chats, informal
  chats” between journalists which were never customarily retained, unlike other
  documents that were material to the investigation. Williams also questioned
  the credibility of the sources for the Guardian’s reporting, including through
  the lens of race. Clarke’s barrister suggested to Kale that she was assigned
  to the story because she was a woman of colour and said that none of the
  defence witnesses who gave evidence in court were black. Kale replied that
  some of the journalistic sources were black women and women of colour but some
  “felt it was more difficult to speak publicly about such matters, given that
  Mr Clarke was also a very successful black man”. Williams asked Osborne if she
  was aware that Ieva Sabliauskaite, who alleged that Clarke took a picture of
  her underwear while she was dancing and attempted to show it to their
  colleagues, was wearing a mini-dress at the time. Osborne replied: “Sorry, but
  I do not think it makes any difference whether she was wearing a short skirt
  or not.” Similarly, he said Osborne should have taken account of the fact that
  Sabliauskaite was “heavily intoxicated”, to which the journalist replied: “I
  do not think it matters either way if she was drunk or not drunk. He took a
  photograph, according to the allegation, and then showed it to people the next
  day.” In his closing submissions, for the fifth time in the trial, Williams
  reached for his favourite analogy: that the Guardian’s story had “more holes
  than a colander” and went so far as to describe its journalists as “rogue”.
  Millar said the idea that the truth witnesses “were all doing a thing as
  serious as lying to the high court … is frankly inconceivable”. Steyn agreed
  with that assessment. “Mr Clarke’s case that more than 20 witnesses – none of
  whom are parties or have a stake in this case, as he does – have come to court
  to lie is inherently implausible,” she said. *Not their real names
