  ‘It’s a disaster’: drought measure to suck water from River Wharfe met with
  anger

  With its pebble beach and shallow areas for paddling, the River Wharfe at
  Ilkley has long been a popular swimming location in the pretty Yorkshire town.
  But plagued by sewage and agricultural runoff, the river has been designated
  as “poor” quality, and a sign has been put up warning people against bathing
  in it. And now, the health of the river has been put further at risk with
  emergency drought plans by Yorkshire Water to suck water from it to top up its
  reservoirs. A drive by campaigners and wild swimmers led it in 2021 to be the
  first in the country to get designated bathing status – meaning the government
  tests it for the harmful E coli and intestinal enterococci bacteria. Yorkshire
  went into drought in mid-June, with locals banned from using hosepipes from
  early July. Reservoir levels continue to drop, despite recent rain. They
  dropped to 62.9% on Monday from 66.1% the previous week, well below the
  average of 87.8% for August. To top them up, the company has applied for an
  emergency drought order to extract additional water from the river, and to
  reduce the amount it releases into the river from Grimwith reservoir. On
  Friday, this was approved by the Environment Agency (EA). The government
  quango admitted that “the issuing of this permit will mean a reduced amount of
  water in the designated bathing water”. Prof Becky Malby, from the Ilkley
  Clean River Group, said: “The less water in the river, the more that pollution
  is concentrated from agriculture and from sewage, which means the oxygen
  levels will be low. When it’s warm and the river is in such low flow, the
  water heats up. This means that the fish in the river will overheat, suffocate
  and die. It’s a disaster for the environment.” Rivers have been bearing the
  brunt of this year’s drought, with Southern Water having applied to take
  enough water from a rare chalk stream to take it below its ecologically safe
  level. The musician turned water campaigner Feargal Sharkey also raised the
  alarm after his local river was drastically reduced in volume by the EA.
  Yorkshire Water has been criticised for a slow response to plummeting
  reservoir levels and failing to build enough of them; there has been no major
  reservoir built in England in more than 30 years. The company has also been
  widely criticised for allowing sewage to spill into nearby rivers, including
  the Wharfe. Despite these failings, the chief executive of the company has
  managed to retain a high income. The Guardian recently revealed the boss of
  Yorkshire Water, Nicola Shaw, has received £1.3m in previously undisclosed
  extra pay since 2023 through an offshore parent company, on top of her large
  salary and bonuses. Though nearby fish farms, campsites and private septic
  tanks cause some pollution into the Wharfe, the two main causes are sewage
  pollution and agricultural runoff. Recent sampling by the EA found nitrates
  and phosphates from farming in the river, and also found that after heavy rain
  the presence of harmful bacteria from animal faeces increases, which means
  runoff from farms is having an impact as well as the sewage outflows in the
  area. After public pressure, Yorkshire Water is building new sewers around the
  river to clean it up. The draining of the river will have dire consequences
  for it, says the ecologist Prof Rick Battarbee. “It’s a serious issue,” he
  said, “especially for fish potentially trapped in pockets of poor quality
  water. The river will also have reduced capacity to dilute treated effluent
  that is continually discharged into the river from sewage treatment works
  downstream, which means that nutrient pollution becomes more severe and faecal
  bacteria concentrations will be higher.” He pointed out the bathing site is
  “ironically situated just 4km or so downstream of the Lobwood abstraction
  point. The site has failed to achieve safe bathing status each of the four
  years since designation – taking more water out of the river will not help
  this year’s compliance statistics.” Campaigners have said that the company,
  and the government, should have been much faster to encourage the public to
  conserve water at the first signs of drought, and to ensure pipes were
  properly maintained so they did not leak water. Malby said: “It is shocking
  that Yorkshire Water can be allowed to leak 260m litres a day but has been
  granted a permit to extract 120m litres a day from our river which is already
  so low is it endangering our wildlife. There has been no national campaign to
  reduce water usage, no plan to conserve and protect water when Yorkshire Water
  and the regulators have seen this coming for years. Water extraction would not
  be needed if we had effective plans to store and manage water, and our water
  pipes were properly maintained. We see no plans from government, water
  companies and regulators to address this shocking negligence.” The chief
  executive of River Action, James Wallace, added: “Allowing such a nationally
  significant stretch of river to bear the cost of poor long-term planning sets
  a worrying precedent. Water companies have had decades to prepare for climate
  change. The science has long warned us of hotter summers, shifting rainfall
  and severe droughts. Yet not a single new reservoir has been built since
  privatisation in 1989. Instead, billions have flowed out in dividends, while
  chief executives pocket vast bonuses.” Claire Barrow, Environment Agency
  Yorkshire’s drought manager, said: “Despite recent rainfall in Yorkshire, this
  has not been enough to refill rivers and reservoirs, and water supplies
  continue to decline. This permit will allow Yorkshire Water’s reservoir stocks
  to remain for longer, so it protects that level of public supply. We only
  issue a permit if we are content that there are clear plans in place to
  mitigate any impact on the environment, along with strong evidence from
  Yorkshire Water of their ongoing commitment to reduce leaks and improve water
  efficiency.” Dave Kaye, the director of water at Yorkshire Water, said: “The
  application and implementation process of the drought permit is tightly
  regulated, and clear conditions are outlined as to when it’s possible to use
  the permit. Specialist independent consultants have already assessed the
  environmental risks of implementing a drought permit. These have been agreed
  by the Environment Agency as part of this process. Once implemented, we will
  continue to monitor the permit to ensure any environmental impacts on the
  downstream ecology are mitigated.”
