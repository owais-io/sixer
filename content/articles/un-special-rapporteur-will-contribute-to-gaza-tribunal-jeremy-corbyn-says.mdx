  A UN special rapporteur will contribute to a two-day “tribunal” being held by
  Jeremy Corbyn into Britain’s “role in war crimes perpetrated in Gaza”, the
  former Labour leader has said. Corbyn, who is campaigning for a new political
  entity with the working title Your Party, said the event would take place in
  early September. His private member’s bill for an official inquiry into UK
  involvement in the Israel-Gaza war was blocked by the government at its second
  reading in July. Instead, the Peace and Justice Project, founded by Corbyn, is
  holding a two-day event called the “Gaza tribunal”. A website dedicated to the
  event says it will “examine Britain’s role in war crimes perpetrated in Gaza”
  by “hearing from experts and witnesses”, and “establish the full scale of our
  government’s complicity in the genocide against the Palestinian people”. On
  Saturday, Corbyn told an audience at the Edinburgh festival fringe that
  Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian
  territories, would be offering her views to the hearings. He told the event
  that his “tribunal” would seek answers on the use of the RAF Akrotiri airbase
  around the war in Gaza, as well as other issues. Corbyn, interviewed on stage
  by the musician Calum Baird, said: “What we’ve done through the Peace and
  Justice Project is set up a two-day open public inquiry on 4 and 5 September
  in Church House in Westminster. “We’ve invited people to make submissions –
  lawyers and others and voices from Gaza and the West Bank and other places –
  in order to put forward their view on the policy. And Francesca Albanese has
  agreed to take part and put forward her view on the legality of it.” He said
  Albanese was “very keen to support it and get involved”, comparing his event
  to the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war. Last month, 22 NGOs, including
  Action Aid, supported Corbyn’s call for an inquiry and said they would
  consider setting up an independent “tribunal” if the bill was blocked by the
  government, which it eventually was.
