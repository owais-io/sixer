  Lisa Ridzén’s debut, which has been a runaway success in her Swedish homeland
  and elsewhere, demonstrates how sometimes the simplest storytelling can be the
  most effective. This is a novel with no clever structural devices or burden of
  symbolism and a setting so limited geographically that the reader ends up
  knowing precisely where everything is. It is narrated by Bo, a former
  timbermill worker who has reached the age when people worry about him, and has
  a network of carers calling in three times a day. One of Ridzén’s inspirations
  was the team journal kept by the carers looking after her dying grandfather;
  very movingly, bulletins from the journal of Bo’s carers punctuate his
  narrative, the alternative perspective like a chill breeze through a briefly
  opened door. Bo lives in the Swedish far north, surrounded by the sort of
  woods, lakes and meadows that are a paradise for dogs but a constant worry for
  the adult children of old men who persist in living somewhere so remote. His
  adored wife, Frederika, no longer knows who he is and has been taken away to a
  dementia care home, imposing on Bo a kind of living bereavement. His one close
  friend, Ture, a man local gossips have down as a “confirmed bachelor”, has
  also reached the stage of being cared for around the clock, but the two old
  men enjoy regular catch-ups on their geriatric-friendly mobiles. His other
  great love is a dog, Sixten, an elkhound who needs far more exercise than Bo
  can now possibly give him, but is a constant presence at his side or on his
  bed. Bo also has a fiftysomething son called Hans, a divorced conservative and
  worrier, and a student granddaughter, Ellinor. The plot, such as it is,
  involves Bo becoming ever frailer and Hans threatening to have Sixten rehomed,
  now that walking a dog in rugged terrain has become too perilous for a man
  prone to falling over. However, almost from the first page, Bo’s first-person,
  present-tense narrative is enriched by repeated dreamlike digressions. These
  take us out of the grim present realities of adult nappies, phlegm cups and
  frozen ready meals into stories of a country boyhood overshadowed by a cruel
  and brutal father, the happy marriage into which young Bo escaped, the
  adorable little boy Hans was before he somehow turned into an overweight,
  fretful bully, and Bo’s long friendship and regular fishing trips with the
  ambiguous Ture. Bo is haunted by a peculiarly male anger – the scarring,
  remembered rages of his father and his own bursts of rage at his increasing
  lack of independence that somehow stops him telling Hans what he really feels.
  As Bo’s end draws near, he faces the twin challenges of keeping his beloved
  Sixten at his side and overcoming his masculine conditioning so as not to die
  with love unexpressed. Another element, hinted at in the title, is the steady
  parade of seasonal changes all about his little house, as the year moves from
  the glories of May, through the pale nights of midsummer, to golden autumn and
  the arrival of bitter cold. The sense of place is conjured deftly – Ridzén is
  describing the landscape on her doorstep near Östersund – but just as
  evocative are the many mentions of Swedish food, from the tinned fishballs and
  microwaved stew served by the carers, which are evidently inferior to the
  fiskbullar and lingonberry-enhanced roasts once made by Frederika, to the
  superior almond tarts, or mazariner, served by Ture, all of which had me
  googling recipes to try at home. At a couple of slightly awkward points,
  translator Alice Menzies has the characters talk a northern English,
  presumably as an equivalent for northern Swedish dialect, but there was really
  no need. Anyone anywhere who has worried for a crumbling parent, or worried
  about the crumble in themselves, or simply worried that their dog understood
  them better than their family, will identify with Ridzén’s novel and take it
  to heart. Notes from an Exhibition by Patrick Gale (Headline Publishing Group,
  £10.99). To support the Guardian, order your copy at guardianbookshop.com.
