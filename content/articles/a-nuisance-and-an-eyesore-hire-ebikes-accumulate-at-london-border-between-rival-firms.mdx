  ‘A nuisance and an eyesore’: hire ebikes accumulate at London border between
  rival firms

  Scattered across pavements, propped against trees and toppled over in bushes,
  dozens of electric Lime bikes have begun to dominate a 200-metre stretch of
  road just south of Chiswick Bridge. This is the point where the motors on the
  hired bikes abruptly stop functioning as they cross the boundary between
  Richmond and Hounslow, a frontline in what residents describe as a turf war
  between rival companies. While ebikes for hire have become an increasingly
  popular mode of transport in London, fractured regulation means customers can
  ride them through some boroughs with ease but find that in others they cannot
  ride or park them. This has led to bikes accumulating on either side of
  Chiswick Bridge as customers are forced to dismount and abandon their
  transportation. The comedian Dara Ó Briain said in a post on X this week it
  had turned the bridge into “Checkpoint Charlie”. He posted: “Hounslow council
  have banned Lime bikes, and licensed Forest and Voi; neighbouring Richmond has
  licensed Lime and banned the others. So every bridge is Checkpoint Charlie,
  with loads of Lime bikes parked on one side and loads of Forest and Voi on the
  other. Top work everyone!” Thomas Letch, who works for a sports recruitment
  company in Richmond, said he needed two subscriptions to cycle hire companies
  to get to work. “It’s a sort of turf wars with ebikes,” said Letch, who had
  arrived on a Forest bike, crossed the bridge by foot and was unlocking a Lime
  bike for the final leg of his journey to work. “The first day I didn’t know
  [the change] had happened, so you cycle over and the electricity just stopped,
  so to get home it becomes a much harder cycle back.” The situation has arisen
  after Lime lost its contract to operate in Hounslow early this month. The
  council required the company to geofence the borough so that its bikes could
  not be parked there and so their electrical functions would not work for
  anyone cycling through, making the heavy bikes hard to pedal. Max Spiers, 25,
  a student who docked a Lime bike on the side of the pavement as he headed to a
  gym in Hounslow, said he had noticed bikes being abandoned by the bridge
  immediately after the council’s decision. “If they’re banning it in Hounslow
  they might as well ban it everywhere,” he said. “I think they just need to
  agree on the same rules for everyone or its only going to get worse.”
  Hounslow’s decision disappointed Lime, which defended its record and said its
  service connected local residents with the rest of the city, and neighbouring
  Richmond council. “Local authorities should be working to make active travel
  options easier, not more complicated,” said Alexander Ehmann, the chair of
  Richmond council’s transport and air quality committee. “Hounslow’s recent
  decision seems to have underestimated the impact on riders to and from
  neighbouring boroughs, including Richmond.” Many local residents were
  concerned about the lack of parking enforcement for the bikes. While there
  were designated bays for bikes on the Hounslow side, Lime bikes in Richmond
  were left scattered around the pavement. Cynthia Brace, a retiree who walks
  past the line of abandoned Lime bikes on her way to her twice-weekly yoga
  sessions, said she was frustrated by the situation. “It’s a nuisance and an
  eyesore. They’re left everywhere and get in your way. I don’t know who’s
  supposed to be picking them,” Brace said. “Look at the way they’re left, there
  should be a place to park them properly.” When announcing its decision to
  issue contracts only to Lime’s rivals Forest and Voi, Hounslow council said it
  was looking into enforcing better parking of hired ebikes, after complaints
  about how they are left when users finish with them. A council spokesperson
  said the issue of bikes being left also came up in other areas where bikes
  could not operate in another borough. “We recognise that a borough-by-borough
  approach can be confusing for users and we continue to work closely with
  Transport for London and neighbouring boroughs to make the case to the
  Department for Transport for a pan-London approach,” they said. A spokesperson
  for Lime said that after Hounslow’s decision it was deploying more teams to
  redistribute bikes left near Chiswick Bridge and that it hoped a solution
  could be found. “Lime operates across London, so it’s important people are
  able to cycle through Hounslow on their way to other parts of London. We’ve
  already been contacted by many riders who are angry at the disruption this has
  caused to their journey,” the spokesperson said. Alex Berwin, the head of
  policy at Forest, said the issue highlighted the need for pan-London
  regulation. “We need a single regulatory framework, one enforcement model and
  one operational rulebook across the capital, whilst ensuring services support
  the local needs of each borough,” Berwin said. “This will get more people
  moving in ways that promote healthier, sustainable lifestyles and ease
  congestion.”
