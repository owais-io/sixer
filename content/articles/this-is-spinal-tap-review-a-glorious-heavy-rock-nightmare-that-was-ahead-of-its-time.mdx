  This was the big bang moment for cringe comedy and spoof mockumentary, and it
  was an American classic whose every superb gag came to be savoured and
  replayed through its massive 1980s popularity on home video, securing their
  international treasure status. Now it is rereleased in anticipation of the
  forthcoming sequel, prising open the chrysalis doors for the band to emerge
  once more into our lives. The film is about the glorious nightmare of
  Britain’s heavy rock colossus Spinal Tap, and the horrendous contrast between
  their mythic pomp and their declining commercial prestige; it is a tragicomic
  and comically influential disconnect, flavoured with ironic self-awareness and
  poignant vulnerability. When lead vocalist David St Hubbins, secretly
  devastated by the thought of the band splitting up, says: “What does the end
  feel like? It’s like saying when you try to extrapolate the end of the
  universe, you say, if the universe is indeed infinite, then how … what does
  that mean?” Similarly, Tim in TV’s The Office, devastated by the apparent end
  to his relationship with Dawn, says: “Life isn’t about endings, is it? It’s a
  series of moments … if you turn the camera off, it’s not an ending, is it?”
  Michael McKean plays lead vocalist St Hubbins, who sports a Jaggeresque pout
  and sneer on stage; Christopher Guest is sub-Jimmy Page lead guitarist Nigel
  Tufnel, while Harry Shearer is the easygoing, pipe-smoking bassist Derek
  Smalls who, like Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts, is maybe more of a jazz
  guy at heart. These fictional monsters, in their ascent to legendary status,
  have long since transcended conventional comparisons, but I like to think they
  have been collectively inspired by lesser-known British rockers Foghat, once
  very big in the US. Our story begins in 1982, as Tap, beginning their long
  slide from relevance, embark on an ill-advised US tour to promote their new
  album Smell the Glove, from which the record company, embarrassed by its
  contractual commitment to the band, is planning to dissociate itself on the
  pretext of its grotesquely sexist cover artwork. Cancellations and disasters
  follow, and there is a resurgence of Nigel’s longstanding antipathy to David’s
  Yoko-style girlfriend Jeanine (June Chadwick), whose new conceptual ideas for
  the band are conceived with exquisite satirical cruelty. The band’s formidable
  manager Ian (Tony Hendra) displays various mean streaks of homophobia and
  antisemitism and wields a cricket bat when he needs to – like Led Zeppelin’s
  Peter Grant – to get tough with promoters. But Ian quits, so does Nigel and
  soon Tap are looking into the abyss. There are blue-chip cameos from Bruno
  Kirby as the Sinatra-loving limo driver, Billy Crystal and Dana Carvey as the
  “mime-waiters”, Patrick Macnee as company chief Sir Denis Eton-Hogg, Anjelica
  Huston as the builder of the tiny Stonehenge and Fred Willard as the air force
  lieutenant who welcomes the band to their gig playing the base’s “at ease”
  weekend. This Is Spinal Tap is shrewd and ahead of its time in seeing how a
  certain strain of white rock appeared to be utterly innocent of its debt to
  black music as well as seeing how a hilariously juvenilised masculinity was so
  often at its heart, with musicians believing that they had armadillos in their
  trousers. It is a story about failure, the kind of failure that reveals
  red-pill truths about the music business that success can’t. Many Tap fans
  will have been masochistically hoping that the band could have produced their
  planned Jack the Ripper musical on Broadway or London’s West End: (“You’re a
  naughty one – saucy Jack! You’re a haughty one – saucy Jack!”). Well, Tap
  survived to see heavy rock accepted as part of the Spotify mainstream-rainbow
  of tastes and styles and the late Ozzy Osbourne almost sanctified. And perhaps
  the film’s satirical creatures, and the paradoxical affection they inspired,
  have thus been overtaken by events. The film’s superb improvisational
  lightness, musical pastiche and lethally observed humour are still a joy. •
  This Is Spinal Tap is in cinemas from 24 August.
