  With reference to the ongoing starvation in Gaza and the Ethiopian famine of
  1984, Gaby Hinsliff writes: “Except this time it’s no natural disaster” (There
  is a dangerous disconnect: on Gaza, politics no longer speaks for the people,
  24 July). But the starvation of Tigrayans in northern Ethiopia in the 1980s
  was as man-made as that of Gaza. The Ethiopian government of the time blocked
  food from reaching Tigray to starve it into submission. The earlier government
  of Emperor Haile Selassie did likewise, and also persuaded its ally, the
  British government, to bomb Tigray in 1943. Today, the starvation, and the
  rape and killing of Tigrayans, continues as the Pretoria agreement, which was
  supposed to bring peace after the most recent war on Tigray, in which 600,000
  Tigrayans perished (2020-22), has not been fully implemented. Many Tigrayans
  are still unable to return to their ancestral homes in western Tigray as it is
  occupied by hostile forces from other Ethiopian regions and from neighbouring
  Eritrea. Across the world, starvation remains an effective tool of war. Gail
