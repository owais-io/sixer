  A so-called “missing minute” of CCTV footage, a key ingredient of conspiracy
  theories surrounding the prison death of the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, has
  been found, contradicting the assertion of Pam Bondi, the attorney general,
  that it was recorded over. The video was in a cache of material, including
  33,000 pages of records relating to the disgraced financier and former Donald
  Trump associate, released late on Tuesday by the US House oversight committee.
  The panel has been looking into Epstein’s August 2019 death at Manhattan’s
  Metropolitan correctional center. In July, the same month as a government
  review confirmed Epstein died by suicide, the FBI released hours of
  surveillance footage taken from outside Epstein’s jail cell on the night he
  died. Observers quickly realized from time stamps that a block of one minute,
  from 11.59pm to midnight on 10 August, was not there. Epstein was found
  unresponsive in his cell at 6.30am. Conspiracy theorists leapt on the
  development as “proof” there was something suspicious about Epstein’s death,
  fuelled by Bondi’s insistence at the time that the prison’s CCTV system was
  routinely reset every 24 hours. That, she told a cabinet meeting on 8 July,
  meant every night’s footage would feature a “missing” minute. But CBS reported
  later that month that there was no blackout in the recording, and that the
  justice department, bureau of prisons, and the FBI had a full version
  including the previously unaccounted for 60 seconds. The revelation was
  supported by Tuesday night’s congressional release that included the footage
  among two hours of previously unseen video. It reveals nothing out of the
  ordinary, with a handful of guards working outside the cell. Other images not
  seen before, according to CBS, include Epstein being escorted by guards
  through the facility to make a phone call. There was no immediate response on
  Wednesday from Bondi’s office or the FBI. Most of the files released on
  Tuesday and posted online to Google Drive contain information already publicly
  known or available. Many are image files of court documents relating to
  Epstein and his former girlfriend and accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, who was
  sentenced to a 20-year prison term in 2022 for sex-trafficking crimes. Maxwell
  met with justice department officials at least twice in recent weeks and is,
  according to critics, pressing the Trump administration for a pardon. Also
  featured in Tuesday’s release are what appears to be body-cam footage from
  police searches and police interviews. An estimated 97% of the material is not
  new. The release came as Trump faces renewed scrutiny over his relationship
  with Epstein, a longtime friend who was part of the president’s wealthy
  network of associates in Palm Beach, Florida, and New York. A number of
  Republicans joined Democrats in demanding more transparency from the Trump
  administration over the case, and the release of all documents related to it,
  amplified by this week’s return of lawmakers to Washington DC after the summer
  recess. The controversy has caused a rare split in Republican ranks with many
  still fiercely loyal to Trump, and others critical of what they see as the
  administration’s secretive approach. Congressman Thomas Massie, a Kentucky
  Republican, joined Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, in filing a discharge
  petition in the House this week that would force the release of all of the
  Epstein files. The House speaker, Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, has
  insisted his party is committed to transparency and justice, but has called
  Massie’s efforts to secure the records “meaningless” and urged colleagues not
  to support them. Massie hit back on Tuesday, telling Fox News Digital: “He is
  afraid of President Donald Trump. Mike Johnson’s speakership just hangs on
  that thread.” A number of Epstein’s victims were joining other survivors of
  sexual abuse at a rally and press conference in Washington DC on Wednesday to
  demand justice, some speaking publicly for the first time.
