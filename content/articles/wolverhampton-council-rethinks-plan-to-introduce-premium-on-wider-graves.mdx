  A council has decided against introducing a premium on wider burial plots in
  Wolverhampton following condemnation that it was a “fat tax”. Danescourt
  cemetery in Tettenhall had planned to charge an extra 20% to families whose
  loved ones need a 6ft-wide plot, as opposed to a standard 5ft grave.
  Wolverhampton council previously said the higher charge was in response to an
  increase in obesity levels in the Midlands city, where a third of people are
  obese, compared with the national average of just over a quarter. Councillors
  had approved the charges in May after consultation with local funeral
  parlours, but backed down on Thursday. Wolverhampton city council said: “No
  formal decision was ever taken on plans to charge more for larger burial
  plots. This is a common practice taken by councils around the country, where
  higher charges cover the costs of providing a larger plot. “However, while
  under consideration, we have decided not to proceed with the plans.” The
  council previously said it had contacted 25 funeral directors before
  introducing the measure, with only one of them posing an objection. Local
  authorities in Telford, Birmingham, Walsall, Coventry and Staffordshire have
  implemented charges for wider coffins. One of the first councils to introduce
  higher fees for larger graves was Houghton Regis town council, Bedfordshire,
  in 2009. A survey by the National Society of Allied and Independent Funeral
  Directors of its members across the UK found a quarter of local authorities
  charged extra for wider burial plots. There was also concern in Wolverhampton
  for couples who wanted to be buried together, but where one was already buried
  in a standard plot while the other needed to be buried in a larger grave.
  Prior to Wolverhampton council backing down over the contentious proposals,
  funeral director Ross Hickton told the BBC the charge was a “fat tax” and that
  it was “not really acceptable or fair”, adding: “You know people have paid
  into the system their entire life, paid their council tax to Wolverhampton
  council, and for them to be told [the grave is] 20% more because of the size
  of their loved one, it’s not really acceptable or fair.” Matthew Crawley, the
  chief executive at the Institute of Cemetery and Crematorium Management, said
  the charge seemed reasonable. “You have a finite amount of space to work with;
  therefore if you need to eat into a grave next door, say, then that needs to
  be accounted for,” he said. “You also have to account for the idea that
  digging the grave itself will also need extra equipment to keep it safe.” In
  January, the National Association of Funeral Directors said the width of the
  average coffin had increased in the past decade from between 18 and 20 inches
  to between 20 and 24 inches. Wolverhampton resident Rosemarie McLaren had said
  she felt the plan was “discrimination, it’s not acceptable”. She told the BBC:
  “Someone like me who’s a bit bigger, is going to be charged [more] because I’m
  fat.”
