  Queensland authorities should consider using influencers – and fewer
  politicians – to better communicate with people during natural disasters, says
  a study that found there was a “critical need” to modernise emergency
  messaging to counter misinformation on social media. Disaster briefings have
  become a rite of passage for political leaders in Queensland, and are often
  viewed as a test of leadership. Griffith University researcher Dr Susan
  Grantham, in a paper published in The Communication Review this month,
  analysed government messaging, including press conferences and social media
  posts, from two recent natural disasters: Tropical Cyclone Jasper in 2023, and
  Tropical Cyclone Kirrily in 2024. Grantham’s analysis of the public
  communication found the reliance on political figures at disaster briefings
  during Kirrily “diluted critical safety messages, shifting the focus toward
  visibility rather than actionable advice”. “The briefings often became
  cluttered with political messaging, detracting from the delivery of critical
  safety information,” Grantham said. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “This
  imbalance risks public disengagement and reduced compliance with directives.
  “Excessive political involvement in crisis communication can erode trust and
  clarity, with broader governance commentary overshadowing immediate safety
  concerns.” At the same time, Grantham found there was no government content on
  TikTok during TC Jasper, and very limited content on the platform during TC
  Kirrily. The absence of official information allowed user-generated content to
  dominate. In some cases, that content included potentially dangerous messages,
  or misleading posts that contradicted formal advice. The lack of “informal,
  engaging” content – as opposed to the highly structured and technical nature
  of the public briefings – meant the government risked not reaching younger
  people, or losing control of the message. “While traditional briefings
  effectively conveyed authority, the absence of government content on TikTok
  during TC Jasper and the limited presence during TC Kirrily (only two videos
  from the Premier) highlighted a missed opportunity to modernise crisis
  communication. “The absence of consistent official government presence allowed
  misguided information and risky behaviours to dominate. “Government agencies
  must establish a presence on platforms like TikTok to guide narratives and
  counter misinformation in real-time. “There is a critical need for an
  integrated crisis communication strategy that balances the authoritative depth
  of traditional media briefings with the immediacy and participatory potential
  of platforms like TikTok.” Grantham’s study found the prominence of
  “user-generated content” on platforms like TikTok meant two local accounts
  with large followings became “key communicators” during crisis preparations.
  Grantham suggested governments “should consider formal partnerships with
  trusted influencers” who could amplify offical messages on platforms like
  TikTok for younger demographics. “This approach would ensure that accurate,
  actionable information reaches a broader audience while counteracting the
  spread of misleading information,” she said. At press conferences during
  preparations for TC Jasper and TC Alfred, authorities spoke about the influx
  of new residents to Queensland the importance of information reaching people
  who had not experienced a cyclone before. Grantham said the rapid population
  growth would include many people for whom TikTok was a primary source of
  information. “Therefore, there is a strong chance they are relying on social
  media platforms to obtain information, and based on the trending TikTok data
  analysed in this study, this could have devastating effects. “For instance,
  one video was posted by a woman who identified as a health worker and
  questioned what she needed to do as an essential worker based on the text
  message alert she had received. This TikTok from the data exemplifies the
  confusion that can be felt by those experiencing disaster events for the first
  time.”
