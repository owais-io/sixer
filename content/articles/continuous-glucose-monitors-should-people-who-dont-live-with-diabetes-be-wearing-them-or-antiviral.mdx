  People living with diabetes have applauded public figures such as Este Haim
  for speaking out about living with the condition and visibly wearing
  continuous glucose monitors (CGM) in public. But another more concerning trend
  has emerged that has seen celebrities, elite athletes and influencers who
  don’t live with diabetes sporting the wearable device, which offers near
  real-time measurements of an individual’s blood sugar. A video Gwyneth Paltrow
  posted on Instagram in May starts with the actor turned wellness influencer
  stretching with a CGM conspicuously on her arm before she proceeds to make
  grain-free almond and coconut pancakes with a strawberry compote. Many in the
  comments questioned her use of a CGM, with some saying she risked stoking a
  “dangerous trend” given many diabetes sufferers struggle to get access to
  them. Other influencers have directly promoted CGMs to people who don’t live
  with diabetes, claiming it can help people manage their metabolism, and
  thereby improve energy, mood and sleep. Dr Fiona Willer, the president of
  Dietitians Australia, worries about the proliferation of the devices and
  questions whether some people may have “fallen down a wellness rabbit hole”.
  What is glucose? Glucose, the sugar in our blood, is “there to help fuel all
  of our cells – our muscle cells, brain cells, all of them – and so we do need
  sugar in our blood. It’s a bit like the petrol in a car,” Willer says. “Any
  form of carbohydrate that we eat, whether that’s lollies or wholegrain bread,
  is turned into glucose, which makes its way into our bloodstream.” The body
  can also recycle glucose from the stored energy of food we’ve already eaten,
  Willer says. Those with diabetes need to monitor their glucose levels because
  their bodies have trouble making or using insulin – the hormone created by the
  pancreas that helps move glucose from our bloodstream into the body’s cells to
  make energy. The blood glucose of people who don’t have regulation issues
  still fluctuates across the day, going up and down depending on what we eat,
  physical activity level, as well as things such as whether we’re ill or going
  through puberty, Willer says. “For people who don’t have diabetes, that
  fluctuation will occur within a tighter range, while for people who do have
  diabetes, their blood glucose levels stray outside of what we would call the
  reference range.” What do CGMs do? People with diabetes previously had to use
  a finger prick test to measure their blood glucose levels. The CGM is a
  relatively new device that uses a sensor to measure glucose via the fluid
  between cells every few minutes and then sends the reading to a receiver or
  smartphone app. For people with diabetes, the reading can then help them
  manage their glucose levels by influencing how they eat or using some
  glucose-modifying drugs such as insulin. Clinical endocrinologist Prof Jenny
  Gunton says CGMs can “hugely improve the quality of life” for people living
  with type 1 diabetes, as well as pregnant women who have gestational diabetes
  and people with type 2 diabetes on insulin. What about people who don’t have
  diabetes? Gunton, who heads the Centre for Diabetes, Obesity and Endocrinology
  Research at the Westmead Institute for Medical Research, says outside of these
  groups, wearing a CGM can be useful to understand blood glucose levels after
  various foods and exercise, but warns that “like any device that gives lots of
  information, CGMs can sometimes increase anxiety and stress”. They are also
  expensive. For people who aren’t eligible for a government subsidy, it can
  cost more than $100 for a sensor that lasts just 14 days. Should people
  without diabetes use them? A study led by the University of the Sunshine Coast
  in 2022 found CGMs provide little benefit for healthy athletes without
  diabetes. Separately, researchers who analysed the available evidence of the
  utility of CMGs among people not living with diabetes in 2024 said that due to
  the lack of evidence, “we urge for the commercial claims suggesting the
  utility of the device in [this population] to be labelled as misleading”.
  Willer welcomes people trying to understand how their body works, but says any
  idea of a “magic number” for glucose levels for someone who doesn’t have
  insulin resistance or diabetes is “completely imaginary”. She also says it
  could lead people to becoming unnecessarily restrictive with their diet and
  trying to control their body in a way that is not necessarily healthy. “It’s a
  bit like calorie counting, in that it’s one metric that can give people the
  impression that it kind of wraps everything up together, that it is an
  indicator for everything. But just like calorie counting, it is actually
  hugely reductionistic, and it means that we lose so much context about why we
  eat, when we eat, the sorts of things we eat, and how food functions in our
  social and cultural experiences as well.” Willer recommends for people who are
  interested in living a healthier lifestyle and want an individual approach to
  speak to a health expert rather than buy a product online. “Even if they have
  purchased a CGM, a dietitian or another health professional will help
  understand, to help them interpret what’s going on with their numbers against
  their actual behaviours.” • Natasha May is Guardian Australia’s health
