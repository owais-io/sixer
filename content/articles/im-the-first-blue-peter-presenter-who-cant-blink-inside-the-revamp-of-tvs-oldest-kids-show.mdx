  There’s only one thing more surreal than making a Blue Peter “Here’s one I
  made earlier” creation and that is doing one with the help of CBBC’s star
  puppet Hacker T Dog. On the new set of the world’s longest-running children’s
  TV show, its first non-human presenter is helping me craft an insect hotel
  using a tin can, glue and some “chenille stems”. The latter is the rebranded
  name for pipe cleaners, although that might have passed you by. “It’s not
  catching on like ‘innocent men’ did,” quips Hacker, referring to the hilarious
  fourth wall-breaking viral clip of him and his former CBBC continuity co-star
  Lauren Layfield corpsing. My bug hotel efforts may be at the Premier Inn end
  of the insect accommodation market but Hacker is encouraging. He’s
  surprisingly useful for someone lacking opposable thumbs – and whose paws his
  puppet master Phil Fletcher (who also does Hacker’s voice) has to operate
  using sticks, while watching the action on a monitor below the desk. In a
  genius move, Fletcher’s quick-witted canine has been hired as Blue Peter’s new
  presenter to bring his comedic chaos and legions of fans to the show as part
  of an attempt to update it to appeal to a new generation of kids. Hacker says
  he’s “proud” to join Blue Peter, pointing out he’s the first presenter who
  “can’t blink”. In addition to assisting the other presenters with the makes
  and delivering his trademark one-liners, he says he will be doing some red
  carpet “showbusiness junkets … I’m dead good at them”. But unlike his intrepid
  co-hosts, “I’m not climbing Nelson’s Column, cocker”. His arrival is part of a
  revamp of Blue Peter that sees it move to a new central Manchester location
  with a cosy, “apartment style” set. It now lives in an airy, refurbished
  Victorian market hall that Hacker reckons has an “Ikea showroom” vibe –
  appropriate from a presenter who can be packed flat. The changes are a
  strategy to target the TikTok generation and signal a more relaxed era for the
  67-year-old show. The large studio fostered by the show’s late legendary
  editor Biddy Baxter is replaced with smaller, zoned filming areas and a social
  media filming backdrop. With its bright colours, exposed brick walls, upcycled
  furniture and industrial-style shelving and greenery, Blue Peter’s new set is
  Mancunian-loft-development-meets-Monica’s-apartment-in-Friends. Presenter
  Shini Muthukrishnan thinks it, “feels so homely.” Co-host Joel Mawhinney says
  it “feels a lot more like an apartment where we’re all just having fun”. Which
  is a lot better than the old studio: “It was actually quite jarring for some
  kids, because if they’re online and watching other shows, they don’t really
  see that any more.” Another part of the revamp is a lot more controversial –
  Blue Peter living up to its catchphrase “Here’s one I made earlier” and no
  longer being filmed live. There was an outcry when that was announced, with
  some saying viral moments such as the infamous 1969 episode involving Lulu the
  pooing elephant would be lost. But, speaking to some ex-Blue Peter hosts who
  have been assembled for my behind-the-scenes tour of the new set (Blue Peter’s
  like a wholesome Hotel California; you never really leave), Konnie Huq points
  out Lulu’s scene was actually pre-recorded: “The majority of the shows were
  live, but … ‘as live’ is the same thing. You’ll still get all of that, because
  it’s not ever going to be a show that isn’t ‘as live’.” In fact, Mawhinney
  reckons, “we might get actually more viral moments” because the presenters
  will be more “relaxed” and “some of the best stuff” happens in rehearsals,
  which will now be filmed. It might not be live any more but episodes can be
  updated close to transmission to reflect topical events, which can also be
  covered in films for the programme’s YouTube channel, explains show editor
  Ellen Evans, adding: “We’ve noticed a real shift. More and more kids are
  watching stuff on demand.” On average, 1.8 million under-16s watched Blue
  Peter each week last year, up 13%, with almost half of them watching on
  iPlayer. Its YouTube channel hit 40m views, up 400% year-on-year. Although
  viewers can still watch it on CBBC at 5pm on Fridays, the vibe now is “digital
  first” and individual elements, such as the “makes”, will also become box sets
  on iPlayer and YouTube. Current presenter Abby Cook reckons the changes are
  “positive, because it’s meeting kids where they are … instead of making them
  be there at five o’clock on a Friday, it’s going: ‘You can have Blue Peter
  whenever, whatever.’” Other changes include filming out and about more across
  the UK and making the speed of the show “more dynamic … much more in tune with
  what else kids are consuming elsewhere”, says Evans. The former presenters
  back the moves: Anthea Turner argues Blue Peter has “always grown with its
  audience” and “the genie’s out of the bottle and we have to go with it”. Radzi
  Chinyanganya thinks TV is at an “inflection point” and “if you don’t adapt you
  die”, but wonders what the loss of a training ground for live presenting
  skills might mean for the future of the industry. Part of Blue Peter’s success
  is down to the fact it has “kept evolving” and been “ahead of the times”, with
  its appeals, inclusivity and environmentalism, argues Diane-Louise Jordan.
  Some viewers just dislike change she explains: when she joined the show in
  1990 as the first black presenter from a working-class background, there were,
  appallingly, “sackloads of awful mail … saying I was going to bring the
  programme down – it was going to never be the same. “People don’t think they
  like change when they see something that’s a bit different. Within a few
  weeks, everything had settled down.” For those wondering if the clock is
  TikToking for the beloved BBC brand, Evans is already planning events for its
  70th birthday in 2028 and says, reassuringly, the new elements will
  “future-proof” Blue Peter for generations to come. The new series of Blue
  Peter airs at 5pm, Friday 5 September on CBBC and BBC iPlayer
