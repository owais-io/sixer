  In late 2020, the actor and comedian Eva Victor decamped from New York to
  their cousin’s house in rural Maine with a surprise window of time and an
  urgent subject. Covid had shut down production on Billions, Showtime’s soapy
  finance drama on which Victor scored their first regular acting gig. Moonlight
  director Barry Jenkins, a fan of Victor’s short comedy videos on social media,
  had DM-ed to offer encouragement and a request: send a script when you’re
  ready. That year, everything felt incomprehensibly big – global pandemic,
  political upheaval, social fracturing. But alone in wintry Maine, Victor
  turned far inwards, towards a quiet personal trauma. “It’s like a stone gets
  shoved into the river of your life. There’s a lot of pain in trying to remove
  it and you can’t,” says Victorrecalling a comparison made by her friend and
  co-star Naomi Ackie. “You just have to find a way for the water to move around
  it. It’s so unfair that someone threw a stone into your life. It’s hard to
  wrap your head around any of it.” The stone was sexual assault, and the film –
  Victor’s directorial debut, produced by Jenkins – is Sorry, Baby, a remarkably
  sharp portrait of healing that quietly upends the prevailing script on sexual
  violence in the long wake of #MeToo. The film wowed audiences at Sundance and
  Cannes and garnered word-of-mouth buzz in the US when it was released in June,
  acclaimed for its welcome reimagining of what critic Parul Sehgal memorably
  termed the “trauma plot”: trauma as a flattening explanation and defining
  event. “I think we often paint people as victims,” says Victor. “In that way
  we make them tragic figures and try to look away from them. Or we make them
  just one thing, and people are complicated.” Sorry, Baby presents trauma as an
  idiosyncratic, fickle, mutable thing, as opposed to the blunt, annihilating
  force that animates numerous films and TV shows loosely grouped under the
  #MeToo umbrella, from the black heart of Emerald Fennell’s Promising Young
  Woman to the deadening shock of Zoë Kravitz’s Blink Twice. Victor plays Agnes,
  a twentysomething English academic in a small New England town who, about 25
  minutes into the film, experiences something awful. She goes to the home of
  her thesis supervisor, Preston Decker (Louis Cancelmi), after he changes the
  location of their meeting at the last minute. The camera lingers outside the
  house, the darkening sky saying all you need to know. “I wanted the film to
  talk about what happens after this kind of violence,” says Victor. “I didn’t
  want to show it.” Afterwards Agnes drives home in mute horror, and tells her
  best friend Lydie (Ackie) what happened in jumbled, detached details. Neither
  say the word rape, but they both know; Lydie confirms: “Yeah, that’s the
  thing.” The rest of the film, which proceeds in one chapter per year, builds
  on principles that feel true to life: that processing is non-linear and
  inconsistent; that the self is multifaceted and mutable; that life goes on in
  a whole variety of tones; that trauma can shape a person but not define them.
  “Ultimately we’re all just afraid,” says Victor. “We don’t want it to be
  possible that it could happen to someone like us. So we make it seem as if
  they are particular people who it’s meant to happen to.” In conversation,
  Victor is much like their film: warm, chatty, at turns wise and childlike,
  their long sleeves covering their hands. We discuss the demise of a
  particularly excellent sandwich shop in Brooklyn, where Victor lived until
  relocating to Los Angeles last year. They now live in the same city as their
  best friend – fittingly, as the most important fact about Agnes, at least to
  the viewer, is her close friendship with Lydie. We first meet the pair four
  years after the assault, during a heady reunion marked by the half-finished
  thoughts and tangled limbs of intimate, platonic love. The trauma is tacitly
  acknowledged, shown clearly in the gulf between how Lydie’s life galloped –
  city, marriage, baby – while Agnes’s crawled. “I really wanted to give them a
  fighting chance at being whole people,” says Victor of the first chapter. “If
  Agnes and Lydie can be these full people who we love, it’s harder to look away
  from them later on when a bad thing happens. It’s harder to paint Agnes as
  something, or to categorise her.” The friendship also provides the canvas for
  comedy, and Sorry, Baby is – crucially – funny, its characters often speaking
  in stilted, off-the-cuff blurts. Victor walks a tonal tightrope between
  deadpan and earnest, the result of years spent working on a comedy career.
  Raised in San Francisco, they studied acting and playwriting at Northwestern
  University in Illinois and were active in the school’s improv scene. A few
  days after graduating in 2016, they moved to New York with aspirations to work
  on a late-night chatshow. They landed, instead, at the feminist satirical
  website Reductress, cranking out four to five posts a day (“insane”) and
  poking fun at the girlbossing cliches of the time. (“Get it, bitch! This woman
  got in the shower.”) For a few years, they lived the aspiring comic’s life in
  New York: standup sets, acting gigs and part-time jobs, including one fitting
  customers at a bridal shop. (“I was very bad at it,” says Victor, but “it
  taught me a lot about gender, and how euphoric it can be for some women to
  feel like women and how dysphoric it can feel for others.”) There were many
  unsuccessful auditions, scripts that “just weren’t landing. I was wanting to
  make things, but I felt as if no one was letting me. And I was like, ‘That’s
  not fair, I’m just going to do it.’” Victor started posting short videos to
  what was then Twitter, in which they played arch, spiralling characters – a
  woman explaining to her boyfriend why they’re going to straight pride, a woman
  who definitely didn’t kill her husband. Many went viral. Jenkins messaged, and
  Victor took another crack at screenwriting, although not, they say, intending
  to speak to anything bigger than themselves, nor against a certain trauma
  trope. They drew from the interiority in Kelly Reichardt’s Certain Women, the
  understatement in Andrew Haigh’s 45 Years, the beauty of Wong Kar-wai’s In the
  Mood for Love. And they watched Michaela Coel’s “completely transcendent”
  BBC-HBO series I May Destroy You – perhaps the closest antecedent to Sorry,
  Baby in terms of treating trauma as a thread, rather than the whole cloth.
  “You see someone doing something so truthfully, and you wonder: ‘What’s my
  version of that?’” says Victor. After reading a first draft of the script in
  2021, Jenkins encouraged Victor to direct. Having worked with first-time
  film-makers on two searing debuts – Charlotte Wells’s Aftersun and Raven
  Jackson’s All Dirt Roads Taste of Salt – Jenkins and his producing partners
  Adele Romanski and Mark Ceryak put Victor in an ad-hoc directing bootcamp,
  practising certain shots and shadowing Jane Schoenbrun on the set of their
  acclaimed film I Saw the TV Glow, before filming for Sorry, Baby commenced in
  Massachusetts in 2024. Although years in the making, Sorry, Baby’s smallness,
  its bracing but uncynical honesty, feels of the moment. The collective
  momentum of the #MeToo movement has dissipated; backlash (and, often, hellish
  litigation) has engulfed many women who spoke up; catharsis did not lead to
  material change. Agnes and Lydie are pessimistic about the chances of
  accountability, and understandably wary of the criminal justice system. All
  Agnes has – all anyone has – is herself, her life, her friends. Victor still
  bristles at any larger movement critique; many times during this press tour,
  they’ve been asked some version of: What does this say about the #MeToo
  movement? “And I’m like, ‘Well, by the way, what are we even talking about?’”
  they laugh. “All I know is this one version of this story, all I want to talk
  about is this attempt at healing.” Victor is also reticent on the inspiration
  for that experience; making movies may be the opposite speed of social media
  posts, but virality taught Victor “how little I want people to know about my
  personal life”. They have maintained a privacy line throughout interviews for
  the film. “I say it’s a very personal story, which is true. And I say it is
  narrative fiction, in which I find a lot of comfort and joy, because I got to
  make Agnes and build a world around her that supports the exact story I want
  to tell.” And that story is not just trauma – it’s professional success, grief
  about friends entering a different life-stage, ambivalence about getting
  older, and the loneliness of being on your own timeline. Agnes, in these
  chapters, is “very much in process,” says Victor. “As we all are.” • Sorry,
