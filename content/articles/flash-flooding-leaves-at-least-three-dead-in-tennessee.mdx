  Flash flooding and torrential rain has cost at least three lives in Tennessee
  on Wednesday and caused havoc on the roads around Chattanooga, as the county
  mayor declared a state of emergency. A tree uprooted from saturated ground and
  fell on a family in their car early on Wednesday morning, in East Ridge, on
  the outskirts of Chattanooga, killing a child and two adults, according to
  authorities in the area. Almost seven inches of rain was dumped on the
  Hamilton county area on Tuesday night, closing an interstate highway and
  prompting the county mayor, Weston Wamp, to announce a state of emergency that
  remained in effect on Wednesday morning. A man was also missing after
  emergency officials saw him being swept away by floodwaters in the Chattanooga
  area on Tuesday night but were unable to reach him despite searching for him
  with a rescue boat. Chattanooga’s mayor, Tim Kelly, said on morning TV in
  Tennessee that “we have got more rain coming” and warned the public not to
  drive into floodwaters. People became stranded in their cars and homes
  overnight after the flash flooding hit. Fire department responders rescued
  several people from vehicles that were in danger of being swept away as
  floodwaters swamped roads. “Firefighters spent hours checking sunken cars for
  any trapped people. This was a large coordinated response effort by city,
  county and state agencies as flash flooding caused dangerous situations in
  Chattanooga,” the fire department said and NBC reported. Sheriffs deputies
  rescued some residents trapped in their homes in the East Ridge area as the
  waters rose, helping people into inflatable rescue boats.
