  Earlier this summer, Republican lawmakers gathered around Donald Trump and
  applauded as he sat before a desk outside the White House and put his
  signature on what he calls his “one, big, beautiful bill”. But there were few
  claps for Mike Flood this week when the Republican congressman appeared before
  an auditorium of his Nebraska constituents to extol the tax and spending
  legislation’s benefits – just boos and jeers. “From where I sit, there’s been
  a lot of misinformation out there about the bill,” Flood said, as the audience
  – some of whom had been encouraged to attend by local Democrats – howled. “If
  you are able to work, and you’re able-bodied, you have to work. If you choose
  not to work, you do not get free healthcare,” Flood later said, diving into
  the bill’s controversial imposition of work requirements for many enrollees of
  Medicaid, the healthcare program for poor and disabled Americans. The heckling
  only intensified. Trump’s bill is looming large over senators and
  representative of both parties as they disperse across the country for
  Congress’s August recess. Signed by Trump on the Fourth of July holiday, the
  sprawling piece of legislation extends lower tax rates enacted during his
  first term, creates new exemptions aimed at working-class voters, and funds
  his plans for mass deportations of immigrants. Republicans see it as the
  epitome of the president’s “promises made, promises kept” mantra, while for
  Democrats, it presents an opportunity to return from the political wilderness
  voters banished them to in last year’s elections. Central to their pitch is
  the bill’s cuts to Medicaid and other safety net programs, its enactment of
  tax provisions from which the wealthy are expected to see the most benefit,
  and its overall price tag, which is expected to rise to $3.4tn over the next
  10 years. Democrats also plan to campaign on what the bill does not do. The
  Republicans who wrote it declined to use the opportunity to extend subsidies
  for premiums paid by people who receive insurance through the Affordable Care
  Act (ACA) – meaning millions of Americans may find healthcare unaffordable
  when they expire at the end of the year. “Between the Medicaid cuts and the
  ACA cuts, our hospitals are looking at a real phenomenon of people walking
  into their ERs with no insurance,” the Democratic senator Elissa Slotkin said
  this week during a town hall in Michigan – a state Trump won last year. “When
  you get that letter, when it arrives in your post box, I want you to
  understand that that increase to your private insurance is because of the cuts
  that Donald Trump has decided to make just in the past month here, OK. There
  is a cause and effect.” Republicans, only a handful of whom have held town
  halls since the recess began, argue that it is Democrats who will be facing
  tough questions back home for their unanimous rejection of the bill. Voters
  will be won over by the legislation’s tax relief for tips, overtime and
  interest on American cars, larger deductions for taxpayers aged 65 and up, and
  expansion of immigration enforcement, the party believes, while Medicaid and
  Snap will ultimately benefit because the measure, they claim, weeds out
  “waste, fraud and abuse” through stricter work requirements and eligibility
  checks. “Republicans are putting working-class Americans first. The one big
  beautiful bill set that image in concrete for the 2026 midterms, putting
  Republicans on offense and giving voters a clear, commonsense contrast,” the
  National Republican Congressional Committee said in a memo. The group has
  named 26 House districts where it believes Republicans can win, while its
  adversary, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), is
  targeting 35 seats. The main battle next year will be for control of the House
  of Representatives, which the GOP controls by a margin that is expected to
  shrink to just three seats once recently created vacancies are filled.
  Democrats see reasons to believe their strategy of campaigning against the
  bill is sound. Recent polls from KFF and Quinnipiac University show that the
  legislation is unpopular, while Trump is seeing his own approval ratings
  slump. The GOP is also grappling from the messy fallout caused by Trump
  supporters’ demands for the release of files related to the sex trafficker
  Jeffrey Epstein. Yet some in the party say making their case will be tricky
  because of how the measure is written. While it mandates the largest cuts in
  history to Medicaid and to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
  (Snap), those mostly go into effect only after election day next year.
  “Mission number one for us as Democrats is to be educating voters on the
  actual impacts of the bill and continuing to call out the Republicans that if
  it was so important to make these cuts to Medicaid and other programs that are
  happening basically in two years, why aren’t they doing it now? Why don’t they
  make it now?” said Jane Kleeb, a vice-chair of the Democratic National
  Committee (DNC) and the party’s leader in Nebraska, where the House seat
  around Omaha is expected to be the site of a fervid race to replace the
  retiring Republican Don Bacon. “We all know the answer, right, because they
  want to win some of these races in ’26.” Brian Jackson, the Democratic party
  chair in Ingham county, Michigan, said he was not concerned about the bill’s
  timing undermining their case against Tom Barrett, a first-term Republican
  congressman. In an interview, he described an atmosphere of uncertainty in the
  swing district created by the looming benefit cuts, Trump’s tariffs and his
  administration’s freeze of research funding, which has affected the local
  Michigan State University. “The concern goes back to the overall culture of
  fear and unknown, and that just is horrible for the economy, it’s horrible for
  jobs, the auto industry. So, you know, Medicaid is just one of many symptoms
  of an out-of-touch Washington and how it impacts people’s day-to-day lives,”
  he said. In California’s Kern county, Democrats are gearing up for a campaign
  against David Valadao, a Republican congressman and resilient opponent whose
  district has one of the highest rates of Medicaid enrollment in the nation.
  Though he voted for Trump’s bill after giving mixed messages about its cuts to
  Medicaid, the local Democratic party chair, Christian Romo, warned that their
  delayed impact could frustrate the party’s efforts. “This is going to
  devastate this community,” Romo said. But with the provisions not taking
  effect until after the election, “will people actually feel the implications
  of that? No. So will they remember that Valadao voted yes on that bill? You
  know, it’s up in the air, and we’ll have to see.” Top congressional Democrats
  argue that even if the cuts themselves are delayed, voters will feel their
  disruptions coming. “Companies are making decisions because they know there’s
  going to be less revenue as a result of a trillion dollars in cuts to
  Medicaid, the largest Medicaid cut in history of this country,” said Pete
  Aguilar, the House Democratic caucus chair. “So, healthcare premiums will
  rise, that will happen early, insurers will make these decisions as well, and
  hospitals are going to have to face difficult decisions on what their future
  looks like.” Christopher Nicholas, a veteran Republican political consultant
  based in Pennsylvania, where the DCCC is looking to oust four Republicans,
  warned that Democrats can’t count on just the Medicaid cuts to get them back
  to the majority. “As America continues to stratify, self-select into separate
  neighborhoods and communities, you’re going to have a lot of those represented
  by Republicans that don’t have as much exposure to the Medicaid program, and
  you’re going to have lots of them represented by Democrats in more urban areas
  that have more exposure to the Medicaid program,” he said. “I think Democrats
  are way out of over their skis, thinking that that alone will get them to the
  promised land next year.”
