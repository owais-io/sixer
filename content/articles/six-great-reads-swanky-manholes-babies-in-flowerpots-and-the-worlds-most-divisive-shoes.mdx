  ‘I don’t expect to live a normal life’: how a Leeds teenager woke up with a
  Chinese bounty on her head “It was Christmas Eve 2024 and 19-year-old Chloe
  Cheung was lying in bed at home in Leeds when she found out the Chinese
  authorities had put a bounty on her head. As she scrolled through Instagram
  looking at festive songs, a stream of messages from old school friends started
  coming into her phone. Look at the news, they told her.” Tom Levitt, writing
  for our Rights and Freedom series, spoke to Cheung to hear her extraordinary
  story and why the reward for her capture will follow her “for ever”. Read more
  The world’s swankiest manhole covers? A thrilling tour of the new embankments
  concealing London’s £4.6bn super sewer A sewer isn’t necessarily the first
  thing you think of when you think of great architecture, but Oliver Wainwright
  was excited to discover the new series of Thames-side embankments build in the
  city to to tackle 18m tonnes of rising excrement. Join him on a “stink tower”
  tour of the UK capital. Read more ‘A radical act’: the rich history behind the
  centuries-long tradition of Black family reunions Large-scale, often outdoor,
  family reunions are an important tradition for many Black families in the
  United States. Reporter Adria R Walker traced the history of the tradition,
  which can be traced back to the immediate period post emancipation and why,
  it’s as important as ever today. Read more ‘We popped the baby in a
  flowerpot!’ Anne Geddes on the beloved photos that made her famous It’s almost
  30 years since the photographer created Down in the Garden, a series of
  photographs of babies in and around flora and fauna, some of which will appear
  in her first ever retrospective in Germany. The Australian told Morwenna
  Ferrier about the practicalities of photographing twin babies in an upturned
  cabbage and why her signature work would be difficult to make in the age of
  AI. Read more Ugly, mortifying – and addictive? Tim Dowling’s week in the
  world’s most divisive shoes “The overwhelming sensation, however, is one of
  horrifying self-consciousness – these are very weird-looking shoes. No one
  comments as I walk down a busy shopping street, and after a while I begin to
  hope no one has noticed – after all, I don’t tend to notice other people’s
  shoes when I’m out and about. Then I look down and think: yeah, but I would
  notice these.” Twenty years after they first hit the shelves, five-fingered
  shoes are having a big fashion moment. But, asked an intrepid Tim Dowling,
  what is it like to wear them in public? Read more From the World Cup logo to
  new club crests, football designs are losing an edge Logo design for sport has
  produced some of the most memorable graphic design in history, notably US
  designer Lance Wyman’s work for the 1968 Olympics and 1970 World Cup (above)
  in Mexico. Pablo Maurer spoke to Wyman and contemporary designer Matthew Wolff
  about the art of sporting graphics – and why today’s logos and badges may have
  lost the spark that made them so special. Read more
