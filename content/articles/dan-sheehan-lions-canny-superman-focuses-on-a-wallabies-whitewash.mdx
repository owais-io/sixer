  Dan Sheehan freely admits that his Superman dive for the British &amp; Irish
  Lions’ first try in Melbourne last week was not out of the playbook. It was an
  instinctive finish to avoid getting “melted”, putting the Lions on the board
  in Melbourne and taking the hooker’s remarkable season tally to 17 in 19
  games. It has been eclipsed by the furore over Jac Morgan’s late clearout, but
  there is debate over whether Sheehan’s try was legal. He acknowledges the
  controversy but sees no problem with his crucial score all the while admitting
  some sympathy with Wallaby defenders. The debate centres on the lawbook’s
  insistence that players cannot jump to avoid a tackle. After he was rebuffed
  by Australia with a tap and go not long before, Sheehan was given another
  chance in the 15th minute and dived over his opposite number, Dave Porecki. As
  he was in the act of scoring, the referee, Andrea Piardi, awarded the try. A
  World Rugby clarification issued in 2022 states that: “A ball carrier may dive
  with the ball in order to score a try, and we all agree that should be
  allowed. From an equity perspective, if they do so, a defender may attempt to
  make a safe and legal tackle on that player.” In other words, Australia
  defenders were permitted to tackle Sheehan when he was airborne but because
  Porecki and James Slipper had both gone low they were left floundering. The
  Wallabies’ head coach, Joe Schmidt, questioned how his players could have
  tackled Sheehan safely but stopped short of claiming the try should have been
  disallowed. “I can see all the controversy about it, but I did know that you
  can dive in the air if you score,” said Sheehan. “I’m not sure actually if I
  missed the line would it be a penalty or not? I feel like I was at full
  stretch and landed over the line so why not? It would have been a penalty as
  well probably if they actually caught me high. It’s a tough job in
  professional rugby. “It was not the play. The play was trying to get as close
  to the line as possible for the second phase. I just thought in my head I got
  melted in the first one and didn’t get much out of it, that there has to be a
  bit of an opportunity over the top. “I took the first [tap and go] and I got
  absolutely melted trying to go low. Usually, one lad goes low and someone
  maybe is high and I just got both shoulders melted low and I didn’t really get
  much out of it. Then the second one I just thought: ‘If I have a dive here …’
  I didn’t know if they had anyone in the back. It was just a throw and hope and
  I slipped through.” Sheehan’s try-scoring performance in Melbourne was key to
  the Lions wrapping up the series and backed up pre-match claims by fellow
  front-rower Jamie George that the Irishman is the best hooker, if not one of
  the best players, in the world. Sheehan has hit it off with George, as well as
  Luke Cowan-Dickie, and has conceded it will be a strange feeling renewing
  rivalries in next year’s Six Nations. “I didn’t know anyone well on a personal
  level before coming into the squad,” added Sheehan. “I’ve really enjoyed
  getting to know Dickie [Luke Cowan-Dickie] and Jamie George on the back of it.
  Two people I’ve obviously come up against a few times, but also looked up to
  when I was in my school days. It’s been really nice to get to know them. “And
  then there’s a few lads your own age that you’ve sort of come up through
  age-grades like Ollie Chessum, Ben Earl who have been a great craic around it.
  Seeing different sides of people where you’re not hating them all the time.
  It’s pretty, not surprising, you’re growing up hating these lads and then all
  of a sudden, you’re like, everyone’s a pretty good fella.” Sheehan picks out
  the post-match celebrations after Saturday’s series-clinching victory as the
  highlight of his tour but after a prearranged day off for the squad on Monday,
  the switch was flicked on Tuesday as the Lions set about preparing to complete
  a 3-0 whitewash over the Wallabies in Sydney on Saturday. “It’s different if
  the series was in the balance but I think we’ve always been pretty clear on
  our goals,” he said. “At the start of the campaign, [the goal] was to go
  unbeaten overseas and win the series 3-0. There’s a lot of people who’ve put a
  lot of effort into travelling out for this game and a lot of our families will
  be here, so there’s plenty of motivation on the line and I can only imagine
  what the Australians are feeling now as well. We need to make sure that we
  show up. We are searching for an 80-minute performance this week and we have
  the ability to do it.”
