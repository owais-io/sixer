  Britain is in danger of going bankrupt. It may happen slowly or quickly, but
  since Labour took office this possibility has increasingly been promoted and
  discussed in the press, by opposition parties and in the City of London. What
  exact form will this bankruptcy take? The prophets of doom tend to be vague
  about the timescale, but more certain about the cause of the coming meltdown:
  the state spending too much, generally on people who have little. “Rip up the
  benefits system and start again,” was the headline of a column by the usually
  measured Matthew Parris in the Times this week. The welfare state, he wrote,
  is “in danger of toppling the whole economy”. Unsustainable numbers of
  claimants are “joining the bandwagon as it careers towards the abyss”. Such
  warnings appear to be given credibility by worried bulletins from the Office
  for Budget Responsibility (OBR), a Conservative-Lib Dem creation intended to
  build confidence in Britain’s fiscal position but in practice more often doing
  the opposite. “The UK’s public finances have emerged from a series of major
  global economic shocks in a relatively vulnerable position,” said the OBR last
  month. “Underlying public debt is now at its highest level since the early
  1960s and is projected to rise further … An ageing population and rising costs
  of healthcare and other age-related expenditures are … projected to push …
  debt above 270% of GDP by the early 2070s.” Already, a sustained rise in the
  cost of government borrowing, disappointing economic growth and tax revenues,
  and a little-questioned push to increase defence spending are all worsening
  the situation. This autumn, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, will probably have
  to produce a budget in an atmosphere of acute financial anxiety, and possibly
  outright panic. Labour chancellors have been here depressingly often before:
  in 1931, during the Great Depression that helped destroy Ramsay MacDonald’s
  government; in 1976, when confidence collapsed in the finances of Jim
  Callaghan’s administration and the UK had to get a loan from the International
  Monetary Fund; and in 2008, when Gordon Brown’s chancellor, Alistair Darling,
  warned that economic circumstances were “arguably the worst they’ve been in 60
  years”. On each occasion, the financial thunderclouds built up during late
  summer. With parliament not sitting, leaving a void for speculative news to
  fill, and many voters approaching the end of holidays and beginning to think
  about autumn belt-tightening, in August Britain may be particularly receptive
  to bleak forecasts about government borrowing. Yet far less attention is paid
  to the doom-mongers’ political assumptions. When journalists, economists and
  politicians say sternly that Britain “can’t afford” certain things, they
  rarely mean nuclear weapons that will probably never be used, or bailouts for
  reckless banks, or the rapidly growing grant for a royal family that already
  has highly profitable estates. When sweeping austerity is called for, the most
  entrenched establishment interests are usually exempt. Nor do these supposed
  tellers of hard financial truths often consider whether the UK can afford low
  taxes on the rich, by international and historic standards, or the
  deterioration in public services already caused by cuts, with all its damaging
  consequences for productivity, social relations and public health. The
  surprise at the angry, run-down state of the country still expressed by many
  commentators – from the Financial Times to the Daily Telegraph – suggests a
  determination not to see austerity, social divisions and political upheaval as
  in any way connected. It’s a sign of the enduring influence of Thatcherism
  that so many people can look at our ever harsher society and economy and still
  conclude that the solution is not more government support for citizens, but
  less. Thus, a panic about the size of the state is created yet again. What can
  the government do to stop it – assuming it actually wants to? In 1931, 1976
  and 2010, Labour responded to fiscal crises in what is revealingly regarded,
  across mainstream politics, as the conventional way: by proposing cuts. There
  remains a puritanical side to the party – perhaps partly a legacy of its
  origins in tightly run cooperative societies – that enjoys trying to prove
  that Labour governments are more frugal than Tory ones. When Labour has an
  expansive, confident leader, such as Tony Blair in the 1990s, spending
  restraint can make the party look measured and responsible: being careful now
  in order to spend more later. But under less persuasive leadership, cuts can
  become a trap. Some voters will always believe that Labour is profligate in
  office – and others that it is never generous enough. The party lost all three
  general elections after MacDonald, Callaghan and Brown’s governments chose
  cuts. Tentative Labour governments can be too influenced by pro-austerity
  interests. After the 1976 crisis had subsided, and the Callaghan
  administration had enacted sharp spending reductions, his chancellor, Denis
  Healey, discovered that the government debt forecasts he had been given by
  Treasury officials had been far too pessimistic. “The figures were billions
  out,” he told me decades later. “The big problem they have in the Treasury is
  getting governments to control spending. So any excuse they can find for
  getting spending cut, they will take.” Now, the scale of the government’s
  problems seems less open to interpretation. This week, the respected National
  Institute of Social and Economic Research warned that “the chancellor cannot
  simultaneously meet her fiscal rules, fulfil spending commitments and uphold
  manifesto promises to avoid tax rises for working people. At least one of
  these will need to be dropped.” Global financial markets, which have become
  even more interconnected and powerful since Labour’s last fiscal crisis in
  office, and which are operated by people who won’t bear the brunt of British
  public spending cuts, will scrutinise the budget with their customary
  coldness. Yet somehow Labour needs to break free of the argument, almost a
  century old now, that its more progressive policies and poorer people’s living
  standards are the first things that should be sacrificed in hard times.
  Perhaps one way is to highlight austerity advocates, past and present, such as
  George Osborne and Kemi Badenoch. Can the country really afford more of that
  kind of haughty, socially disastrous politics, Labour could ask. But then it
  would have to set out an alternative: a centre-left politics that can survive
  financial crises – or avoid them altogether. After so many fearful retreats,
  that work has barely begun. Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist
