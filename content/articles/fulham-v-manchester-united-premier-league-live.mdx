  What’s at stake (realistically). Man United are 18th in the table with nul
  points, so they can either stay there if they lose today, go 16th or 17th if
  they draw, or leap to somewhere between fifth and ninth with a win. Fulham,
  currently 14th, can slip a place or two if they lose, stay 14th if they draw,
  or soar to fifth with a win. All to play for! Now, the view from Fulham. “I
  ought to be full of optimism,” says Richard Hirst. “The first home game of a
  new season, shiny new grass, shiny new kit, shiny new players (ah, OK, better
  scrub that one).” Ha. “But it’s Man Utd and, like The Great Escape, we’ve all
  seen this movie too many times and know the ending; spoiler alert, United win
  1-0 with a deflected goal in the third minute of stoppage time. But what’s
  life for if you can’t dream, so COYW.” An email! “You made a good point in
  your thoughts* about United’s defeat last week, Tim,” says Karen Asad,
  generously. “I honestly can’t fathom how Amorim can’t find a place for Mainoo.
  He is young and has already proven top-class. Isn’t it the coach’s job to
  teach players how to play in his system? Like what Liverpool did with
  Gravenberch last season. Top coaches do it all the time; it’s part of the job.
  “Casemiro &amp; Fernandes? Really? Nobody serious thinks United will go places
  with that midfield. “If Amorim doesn’t work out, United are in deep deep
  trouble after investing so much for his system.” With you on the elderly
  midfield, not so sure about the investment – Cunha and Mbeumo are good enough
  to slot into the 4-2-3-1 that the next manager will surely bring in, Sesko is
  promising, and only Dorgu would be a square peg. A bigger worry would be who
  on earth would go on the left wing, which has borne the brunt of Amorim’s
  purge. *The piece was my attempt to make sense of the performance against
  Arsenal, which appeared in United Writing, the Substack newsletter I founded
  with Rob Smyth. And in Everton’s spanking new stadium … a resounding home win!
  “Grealish,” says Tom Bassam, “was outstanding.” Meanwhile, in South London …
  Palace and Forest have re-enacted their result from May. Scott Murray has the
  details. Fulham (4-2-3-1) Leno; Tete, Andersen, Bassey, Castagne; Lukic,
  Berge; Sessegnon, King, Iwobi; Muniz. Subs: Lecomte, Cuenca, Robinson, Reed,
  Cairney, Traore, Wilson, Smith Rowe, Jimenez. Man United (3-4-3) Altay; Yoro,
  De Ligt, Shaw; Amad, Casemiro, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha, Mount. Subs:
  Onana, Fredericson, Maguire, Heaven, Dalot, Ugarte, Mainoo, Mount, Zirkzee,
  Sesko. Marco Silva is more proactive, even though Fulham’s first result was a
  decent one (1-1 at Brighton). Rodrigo Muniz, who secured that point with a
  last-ditch equaliser after coming on as a sub, dislodges Raul Jimenez. Ryan
  Sessegnon replaces Harry Wilson on the right wing, and at the back Jorge
  Cuenca gives way to Timothy Castagne. The exciting Josh King, only 18,
  continues to edge out Emile Smith Rowe as the No 10. Andreas Pereira is left
  out of the squad, as is Rasmus Højlund (again) for United, and possibly for
  the same reason – they seem to be on their way out. Ruben Amorim makes only
  one change to United’s starting XI, replacing his right wing-back, Diogo
  Dalot, with the more attacking Amad. That means two surprises: Benjamin Sesko
  has to wait a bit longer for his first start, as Amorim persists with a false
  nine (probably Matheus Cunha); and Altay Bayindir is retained in goal after
  his expensive howler against Arsenal, even though André Onana has had another
  week to regain full fitness. Afternoon everyone and welcome to a game that
  ought to be a mismatch. A club that has spent £200m this summer is paying a
  visit to a club that has spent £500,000. And yet, on paper, it’s too close to
  call. Fulham have continuity on their side. Marco Silva, who took over as
  their manager in summer 2021, is now the third longest-serving manager in the
  Premier League. (Pep Guardiola and Mikel Arteta are the only PL bosses to
  survive from the BC era – before Covid.) Manchester United are more about
  chaos. A swathe of redundancies, a number of players banned from squad
  training, a whole new forward line, a whole new team of chief this and chief
  that, and a manager who has yet to prove himself in English football. Still,
  Ruben Amorim has discovered the secret that has eluded everyone else: how to
  stay in a top job while losing left, right and centre. “We are playing a great
  side,” Silva said on Friday. Is he sure about that? Amorim’s United, well
  though they played in losing to Arsenal last Sunday, have been comically bad
  at coping with mid-table teams. In 14 league games last season against clubs
  that finished between 7th and 17th, they won two, drew two and lost ten,
  making a grand total of eight points out of 42. To be fair, one of the wins
  did come at Craven Cottage – a jammy 1-0 conjured up by the persistence of
  Lisandro Martinez and a friendly deflection. Fulham soon took their revenge by
  going to Old Trafford in the FA Cup and winning on penalties. Opta’s
  prediction machine gives Fulham a 30pc chance of winning today, United 44. The
  prediction pundits see it as closer than that: Chris Sutton and Paul Merson
  have both gone for a 1-1 draw, while Harry Redknapp says 2-1 to United.
  Kick-off is at 4.30pm (BST) and I’ll be back soon with the teams.
