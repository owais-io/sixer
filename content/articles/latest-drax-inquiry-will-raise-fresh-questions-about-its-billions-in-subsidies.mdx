  The financial watchdog’s decision to investigate the sustainability claims
  made by the owners of the Drax power plant came as little surprise to
  Britain’s energy industry. For years, the former coal generator has faced a
  torrent of criticism for collecting billions of pounds in renewable energy
  subsidies in exchange for burning wood pellets – shipped thousands of miles
  from North America – at its vast power plant in North Yorkshire. Drax faces
  allegations that it may have mislead investors, and the government, over the
  sustainability of its wood sources. In its investigation the Financial Conduct
  Authority (FCA) will effectively follow in the footsteps of the industry
  regulator, Ofgem, as well as the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts
  Committee in scrutinising whether the company’s green claims stack up. Drax is
  a relic of Britain’s coal-rich industrial past. Built after the 1960s
  discovery of the Selby coalfield and opened in 1974, it burned coal for almost
  50 years. It expanded to become Britain’s biggest power plant, generating
  enough electricity to power about 4m homes from almost 4 gigawatts of
  capacity. But as coal fell out of favour and Britain began turning to
  renewable power, Drax started converting its coal-burning units to run on
  biomass in 2013 – aided by a lucrative stream of subsidies. The latest
  controversy circling the government’s support for biomass is expected to raise
  fresh questions over the decision to extend its subsidies by almost £2bn by
  the end of the decade. The government has also granted permission for Drax to
  fit carbon capture technology to biomass plant, in a project that could cost
  billpayers an estimated £40bn. Industry sources have suggested that although
  there are growing concerns over the sustainability of burning biomass there
  are likely to be deeper concerns over the viability of the government’s green
  energy targets if biomass is ruled unsustainable and struck from the energy
  system. In 2024, biomass and bioenergy more broadly made up 15% of the UK’s
  electricity generation, and was considered a low carbon alternative to fossil
  fuels. In this year alone, the FTSE 250 company collected the equivalent of
  £2m in subsidies every day for its biomass power generation, at a cost of £10
  a year for every household in Britain. In total, the company is estimated to
  have earned over £7bn from energy bills since it began converting its
  coal-burning units to run on biomass. Whether biomass should be considered a
  form of renewable energy has sparked debate across Europe. Drax – Britain’s
  biggest single source of carbon emissions – has argued that burning waste wood
  offers a steady source of carbon-neutral energy because forests absorb
  emissions from the atmosphere as new trees regrow. These claims have been
  fiercely opposed by green groups and climate scientists who fear that power
  plants are emitting carbon dioxide faster than it can be absorbed, creating a
  carbon debt which could accelerate global heating. They have also questioned
  the sustainability credentials of Drax’s wood sources. The concerns came to a
  head in late 2022 when a BBC documentary revealed that a company owned by Drax
  was not relying solely on waste wood for its biomass pellets. It showed that a
  Canadian subsidiary was involved with the logging of natural woodland to
  produce biomass pellets, despite the company’s claim to avoid any damage to
  “carbon-locking” forests. In the aftermath of the documentary, one of the
  company’s top lobbyists, Rowaa Ahmar, claimed to have warned senior executives
  that the company was “misleading the public, government and its regulator”
  about its sustainability credentials. Ahmar made the allegations as part of an
  employment tribunal in which she claimed to have been unfairly dismissed for
  blowing the whistle on the company’s handling of the crisis. Drax denied her
  claims, and reached a settlement with Ahmar a week after the case opened. The
  company later paid a £25m fine after a subsequent investigation by the energy
  regulator, Ofgem, found that it had inadequate data for the sustainability of
  the wood it imported to burn in 2021 and 2022. It ordered a full, independent
  audit of its supply chain for 2023. “This is another controversy for biomass,”
  said to Frankie Mayo, an analyst at Ember, following news that the FCA would
  carry out an investigation into the company. The climate thinktank has found
  that Drax is the country’s biggest emitter of carbon dioxide despite earning
  £869m in public subsidies last year for generating electricity from its wood
  burning power plant. “It’s right that the UK’s largest emitter faces
  additional scrutiny. Power from Drax is more expensive than from gas, it’s
  more polluting than coal, and more dependent on imports than oil,” Mayo said.
  “The idea of sustainable biomass at this scale has been pushed beyond
  believability for most people. Future plans for biomass power reflect this:
  the government has decided to cut Drax’s massive subsidies in half from 2027.”
  The government did not respond to questions over whether it would move ahead
  with plans to extend subsidies for the Drax power plant. Drax said the company
  would cooperate with the FCA as part of its investigation.
