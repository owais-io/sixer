  The former British prime minister Harold Macmillan once said there was no
  problem in the Middle East because a problem had a solution. Keir Starmer is
  the latest incumbent in No 10 to try to prove Macmillan wrong, with a plan
  that has been described by Downing Street as a “pathway to peace” for Gaza and
  the wider region. The record of Britain’s previous interventions do not augur
  well. The Balfour declaration of November 1917 The famous commitment drafted
  by the then British foreign secretary, Sir Arthur James Balfour, to “view with
  favour the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people”, was
  integrated into Britain’s UN mandate over Palestine between 1923 and 1948 and
  paved the way for the birth of Israel. But the declaration contained a key
  qualification: nothing should be done to prejudice the “civil and religious
  rights” of Palestine’s “existing non-Jewish communities”. Britain afforded
  Israel de facto recognition on 30 January 1949, in the last stages of the
  first Arab-Israeli war, and de jure recognition on 27 April 1950. For many
  Palestinians, the second part of the Balfour promise is yet to be made good.
  Suez crisis of 1956 and its aftermath In the Arab nationalism of the Egyptian
  president Gamal Abdel Nasser, Britain saw a destabilising force that might
  subvert pro-western states such as Jordan. For Israel, Nasser was a threat for
  allowing Palestinian militants permission to launch attacks against it from
  the Gaza Strip, then controlled by Egypt. Matters were brought to a head when
  Egypt nationalised the Suez Canal Company on 26 July 1956. Under a secret
  agreement, Israel agreed to attack Sinai, the Egyptian peninsula between its
  western border and the canal. British and French forces would then intervene
  to “separate the combatants”, seizing control of the canal zone. The
  Anglo-French element was a debacle. The Israeli part of the plan went well.
  Israeli forces captured Sinai in its entirety, destroying three Egyptian
  divisions. From then on Israel was considered to be a major fighting force by
  the west. Britain exported arms to it from the 1960s in the belief that a
  strong Israel would reduce the chance of further war in the region. UN
  security council resolution 242 In the aftermath of the six-day war in 1967
  between Israel and a coalition of Arab states, primarily Egypt, Syria and
  Jordan, Britain played a key role in drafting United Nations security council
  resolution 242. It embodies the principle that has guided most of the peace
  plans that have followed – the exchange of land for peace. The resolution
  called for the “withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied
  in the recent conflict”, such as Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, as
  well as “respect for and acknowledgment of the sovereignty, territorial
  integrity and political independence of every state in the area and their
  right to live in peace within secure and recognised boundaries free from
  threats or acts of force”. It would come to be criticised for being vague and
  for its depiction of the Palestinian people as lacking national rights,
  describing their cause as the “refugee problem”. Venice declaration of 1980
  Britain’s role as a key player was overtaken by the US in 1978 when its then
  president, Jimmy Carter, brought the Egyptian leader Anwar Sadat and the
  Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin together at Camp David. The plan sought
  to set up a “self-governing authority” in the West Bank and Gaza, leading to
  eventual “final status” talks. The agreement included only a token gesture to
  Palestinian aspirations for self-determination. No Palestinians were involved
  in the negotiations and the plan did not include any mention of a Palestinian
  state. The European and British perspective was voiced in the Venice
  declaration of 1980 issued by the then European Economic Community. “The
  Palestinian people … must be placed in a position, by an appropriate process
  defined within the framework of the comprehensive peace settlement, to
  exercise fully its right to self-determination,” it said. It further added
  that the Palestine Liberation Organisation must be involved. This was
  controversial as the PLO was at this stage calling for Israel’s destruction.
  It prompted criticism from the US. But even under the solidly pro-Israel
  leadership of Margaret Thatcher and John Major, British policy was to avoid
  straying too far from the European consensus. Major in 1995 became the first
  western leader to meet Yasser Arafat inside the Palestinian Authority’s area
  of control, which had been established through the Oslo accords overseen by
  the US president, Bill Clinton. ‘War on terror’ The second intifada, an
  uprising against Israeli occupation from 2000 to 2005, took place in the wake
  of Clinton’s failed Camp David summit, which was meant to broker a final
  agreement on the peace process. The intifada overlapped with the “war on
  terror” that followed the 9/11 attacks. Tony Blair used his close relationship
  with the then US president, George W Bush, to issue the 2003 roadmap peace
  plan that would resolve all issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by 2005
  through implementation of a two-state solution. It failed. After leaving
  Downing Street, Blair was appointed as the envoy of the Quartet on the Middle
  East. The quartet consisted of the UN, the EU, the US and Russia. Blair sought
  to develop the Palestinian economy and improve governance but struggled to
  make headway. He resigned after nearly eight years in the role, with
  Palestinians criticising what they saw as his closeness to Israel, including
  his decision to deliver a eulogy at the funeral of the former Israeli prime
  minister Ariel Sharon. Britain’s policy under the succeeding prime ministers –
  Gordon Brown, David Cameron, Theresa May, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi
  Sunak – has been criticised for reciting the mantra that a two-state solution
  is the only way forward without expending energy or political capital on the
  goal.
