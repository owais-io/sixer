  summer

  On a sunny weekday in Norfolk, the lunchtime rush is getting under way at the
  White Horse in Brancaster Staithe. On the large terrace at the back of the pub
  overlooking the coast, families and groups of holidaymakers are tucking in to
  local lobsters, plates of crab and fish and chips. “This is our Christmas,”
  says James Nye, the managing director of Anglian Country Inns, the hospitality
  business started by his father, Cliff, 30 years ago which owns the White Horse
  and nine other venues across Norfolk and Hertfordshire, stressing the
  importance of the key summer season. “We’ve had a strong start to the year
  with three months of sunshine,” he says. “But I think that has masked the
  challenges the sector is facing. When the rain comes you can see how overheads
  have gone up.” Nye reels off a list of soaring costs facing the White Horse
  that will resonate with pubs, cafes, restaurants and hotels across the UK,
  underlining additional pressures facing the sector this summer season. “Since
  April we have had a lot of increase in overheads, pretty much across the
  board. We’ve got food price inflation, the big one is labour, with the NICs
  [employer national insurance contributions] and national minimum wage, and
  everything is getting more expensive,” he says. Nye says his business, like
  many others, has been unable to absorb all the extra costs and passed some on
  to customers. But he and others are aware they have to tread a fine line at a
  time when many households are watching their spending. Holidaymakers Brian and
  Ann Hart, visiting from neighbouring Suffolk, are enjoying a glass of prosecco
  while waiting to check in to their room at the White Horse. They have found
  accommodation and meals in North Norfolk “definitely more expensive” than
  during their last visit, says Brian. “We would still come away, but maybe only
  a couple of times a year now because of the cost,” adds Ann. Tax rises and
  extra employment costs announced in last October’s budget came into force in
  April, raising employer national insurance contributions (NICs) and lowering
  the threshold at which contributions are due. The minimum wage was also raised
  by 6.7% to £12.21 an hour. These measures are ultimately expected to raise
  £25bn a year, which the government has said is needed to restore crumbling
  public services. However, the trade body UKHospitality, which represents
  thousands of restaurants, hotels, pubs, cafes and nightclubs, has warned the
  changes will cost the industry an extra £1bn, forcing some to cut jobs or
  slash investment, while others are struggling to stay afloat. “This is the
  toughest trading environment I’ve ever experienced in 30 years in the sector,”
  says Kate Nicholls, the chair of UKHospitality, calling it even tougher than
  the pandemic. “It is that perfect storm of soaring costs, a cost of living
  crisis happening at the same time, which means you can’t pass all of those
  costs on to customers, and a really intense squeeze on margins. Coming on the
  back of closures and losses during Covid, businesses are really lacking in
  resilience.” Hospitality has shed 84,000 jobs since last October’s budget,
  according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), making it
  the worst affected sector. UKHospitality predicts this figure could hit
  200,000 by the time the financial year ends in March 2026. Meanwhile, warnings
  from the sector now appear to be becoming reality. The Italian casual dining
  chain Gusto and the Thai restaurant chain Busaba both collapsed into
  administration in recent days. Seven of Gusto’s 13 sites were bought in a
  pre-pack administration resulting in 200 job losses, while Busaba was also
  bought in a pre-pack deal, saving about 240 jobs at seven sites across London
  and Essex. Nye also knows several pub operators who have had to call last
  orders for the final time, amid industry warnings that one pub will close down
  every day this year across Britain. Anglian Country Inns employs about 100
  people at the White Horse, a third of whom are seasonal staff, and a further
  400 across the rest of the business. Nye says they have worked hard to retain
  staff by treating them well, but amid current pressures they are trying to
  make teams more efficient in a bid to cut costs. They have 5% fewer full-time
  staff than last year and have hired fewer seasonal workers than in the past.
  This reduction in seasonal hiring is being repeated across the sector, and job
  postings for temporary hospitality jobs are 25% lower than this time last
  year, according to figures from the Recruitment and Employment Confederation
  (REC). The knock-on effect is a cut in job opportunities for students or those
  looking for flexible work, who have traditionally relied on hospitality jobs
  to get their first taste of employment. It has resulted in a summer of
  disappointment and frustration for 19-year-old Jeremy Nunn from Hertfordshire,
  who planned to work in hospitality over the summer after finishing his first
  year studying history and French at the University of Leeds. Despite sending
  off about 100 applications for seasonal roles, he still hasn’t found a job.
  “It’s a bit disheartening when you spend a lot of time on applications and
  then send them off online, it can feel like shouting into the void,” he says.
  “On most of my applications I’ve received nothing back.” A few miles down the
  road from Brancaster in fashionable Burnham Market – nicknamed Chelsea-on-sea
  – the ice-cream van is doing a roaring trade and visitors are browsing in the
  town’s boutique and homeware shops. The final customers are finishing their
  coffees and paying their bills after eating lunch at Socius, an award-winning
  restaurant known for its small plates featuring locally sourced produce,
  opened in 2018 by the husband and wife team of Dan and Natalie Lawrence. Dan
  Lawrence says challenging times are forcing kitchens to get creative. “We have
  to be smarter, cleverer and try to make better profit to cover those costs,”
  he says, sitting next to the counter where his staff are preparing ingredients
  for the evening’s dinner service. “We change our menu every week, sometimes
  throughout the week, so we have close conversations with suppliers and they
  tell us what’s good, what they’ve got plenty of, what’s a good price or what
  not to go anywhere near.” Lawrence believes, like many others in hospitality,
  that the government could do more to help businesses struggling with high
  costs, such as the temporary reduction in value added tax (VAT) from 20% to 5%
  introduced by the then chancellor Rishi Sunak to kickstart hospitality after
  the first national Covid lockdown. For now, Labour ministers have announced
  plans to “breathe new life into the high street” by overhauling planning and
  licensing rules, to make it easier for new hospitality venues to open in empty
  premises, as well making it easier for restaurants and pubs to get permission
  to allow customers to dine alfresco or enjoy a pint on the pavement. While
  many in the industry would welcome such a move, others found it “galling” at a
  time of higher taxes and costs, says Jonathan Lawson, the chief executive of
  Butcombe Group, which runs 120 pubs and inns across the UK and Channel
  Islands, many of which are in rural locations. “Most in the industry would
  say, because of the pain the government inflicted on the hospitality sector,
  why would new businesses choose to actually be starting up in some of those
  locations?” he asks. Lawson says Butcombe Group has grown well since the
  pandemic, partly through diversifying its business, including opening its pubs
  earlier for breakfast, while promoting its venues as places for couples to
  celebrate their weddings. “In hospitality, our job is to provide what
  customers want,” he says. “Hospitality is the third-highest employer in the
  UK, it can drive growth, it wants to invest. It’s almost in spite of the
  government, rather than because of it.” Back in Norfolk, the sun is still
  shining, but Nye worries what will happen when the summer ends and the
  visitors leave. “Our big fear is what happens when trade dies down, when the
  season gets a bit quieter. Carrying those extra overheads is going to really
  hurt us,” he says.
