  Now that the window has slammed shut, deal sheets either filed or torn up,
  there’s more than a few players left in limbo by the Premier League’s
  record-breaking summer transfer window. What now for Emi Martínez, who keeps
  waving goodbye to Aston Villa and yet remains on the books, denied a dream
  move to Manchester United because Senne Lammens was the cheaper, younger
  option. A move to Turkey? The World Cup winner is said not to fancy it. The
  Turkish window rolls on but there is a Champions League deadline this week to
  meet to for its qualified clubs, with Galatasaray the most likely destination.
  In any case, no bid came from United, who were also the preference for
  Gianluigi Donnarumma. In both cases wages were the issue for United. The Euro
  2020 winner instead headed to Manchester City to learn how to play like Pep
  Guardiola asks – with Ederson heading to Fenerbahce. Most deals tend to have
  knock-ons, and the collapse of Marc Guéhi’s move from Crystal Palace to
  Liverpool had ramifications for Joe Gomez, who was poised for a move to Milan.
  Instead, he is likely to be Virgil van Dijk’s partner for the
  foreseeable/until the January window, when Guéhi comes in. Guéhi recorded a
  soft-focus farewell video, shots of Wembley and his “last” goal for Palace at
  Villa on Sunday. That’s leaked on to the internet and “Skipper” as it terms
  him, can always get it recut. Other players staying on: Ademola Lookman staged
  an Isak/Wissa-style protest but remains at Atalanta, rather than switching to
  Bayern Munich. Awkward. The Welsh wing wizard Harry Wilson was set for Leeds
  but stays at Fulham, a collapse that happened concurrently with Tyrique George
  staying at Chelsea. Talking of which: Raheem Sterling. Still at Chelsea,
  contracted until 2027, on very high wages of the type BlueCo, the owners, no
  longer pay. And highly unlikely to get a game. For family reasons he is not
  willing to move to Saudi Arabia, the USA or various other destinations, and a
  loan to Fulham did not happen. He’s only 30. Axel Disasi is in a similar boat:
  no move to Aston Villa, West Ham or Crystal Palace so he remains at Chelsea.
  At least Ben Chilwell got off to Strasbourg, who just happen to be BlueCo’s
  other club, and now have a rather big squad considering their fairly medium
  ambitions in Ligue 1. Julio Enciso has just joined Strasbourg from Brighton,
  who also loaned Facundo Buonanotte, another South American talent to, er,
  Chelsea. Will Osula was the new hero of Tyneside just a week ago after scoring
  against Liverpool but he almost ended up loaned to Eintracht Frankfurt, only
  for that deal to also not happen. Manchester United’s bomb squad is much
  reduced after the shelling of Antony, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and
  Rasmus Højlund. Which leaves poor old Tyrell Malacia, who was supposed to head
  to Elche in La Liga but remains a United player. Perhaps he might convince
  Ruben Amorim he is an option in centre midfield, a position of weakness where
  United are said to have moved for Conor Gallagher, only for Atlético Madrid to
  shut that down.
