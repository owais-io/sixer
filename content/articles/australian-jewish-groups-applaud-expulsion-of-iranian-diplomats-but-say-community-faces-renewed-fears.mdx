  Australian Jewish groups have applauded the government’s “entirely
  appropriate” move to expel the Iranian ambassador in light of Iran’s alleged
  connections to antisemitic attacks in Australia – but say the “horrendous”
  news has renewed fears among the already traumatised community. Responding to
  news the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps will be listed as a terrorist
  organisation in Australia, Jewish community members said the action was
  welcome but overdue. Benjamin Klein, a board member of Melbourne’s Adass
  Israel synagogue, said Tuesday’s “horrendous” news had caused “general fear”
  among members of his congregation. “It’s very concerning. Your mind boggles to
  think ‘Why would they? What else do they have up their sleeve?’ It should be
  taken notice of,” Klein said. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “It’s traumatic
  and quite stressful for the community. It makes people more fearful.” The
  synagogue was was set alight in December, causing significant damage to the
  building. The arson attack was later declared a terrorist incident and singled
  out on Tuesday – along with an October arson attack on Lewis’s Continental
  Kitchen in Bondi – by Anthony Albanese, who said “credible evidence”
  determined the incidents were directed by Iran. Iranian diplomats posted to
  Australia were not involved, the chief of the Australian Security and
  Intelligence Organisation (Asio), Mike Burgess, said. Israel’s embassy in
  Canberra welcomed the decision, saying it was warranted. “This is a step we
  have long advocated for … A strong and important move,” a spokesperson said.
  The embassy later posted on social media: “Australia has taken a principled
  stand, others should consider following suit.” The president of the Executive
  Council of Australian Jewry – Australia’s peak Jewish Group – Daniel Aghion,
  said it was “entirely appropriate” for the IRGC to be proscribed a terrorist
  organisation. “These attacks instigated by the Iranian regime are an attack on
  our nation and our sovereignty. As Australians, we are outraged that a foreign
  actor perpetrated acts of terror on our soil. Foremost, these were attacks
  that deliberately targeted Jewish Australians, destroyed a sacred house of
  worship, caused millions of dollars of damage, and terrified our community,”
  he said in a statement in which he also thanked the Australian federal police,
  Asio and state police forces. “For many years, we have warned of the threat
  posed by the Iranian regime … It has consistently shown a willingness and
  capability to finance and orchestrate terror all over the world,” Aghion said.
  “Israel’s enemies are Australia’s enemies.” The Jewish Council of Australia’s
  Sarah Schwartz said the group was “shocked” to learn of Iran’s involvement in
  the attacks, and urged caution around politicising the crimes. “These attacks
  have instilled fear in the Jewish community. The Jewish Council reaffirms our
  solidarity with Adass congregants and all impacted by the attacks. “The fact
  that a foreign government appears to be responsible shows how irresponsible it
  was for the attacks to be used to demonise the anti-genocide protest movement.
  We call on politicians and the media to exercise caution and to avoid
  politicisation of these attacks in a way that could further harm the Jewish
  community.” The president of the Zionist Federation of Australia, Jeremy
  Leibler, said the organisation was “deeply disturbed” by the “chilling
  revelations”. He welcomed the government’s “decisive” action and said it sent
  “a powerful and principled message that terrorism, foreign interference, and
  hate have no place in Australia”. The president of the NSW Jewish Board of
  Deputies (ECAJ’s state body), David Ossip, labelled the alleged Iranian
  involvement in the attacks “chilling and deeply concerning”. “It is difficult
  to overstate the significance of this unprecedented news,” Ossip said. “These
  incidents were nothing less than an attack on Australia by a foreign state,
  primarily targeting the Jewish community and designed to unravel our social
  cohesion by legitimising and normalising attacks on the Jewish community.”
  Ossip said despite Australia’s Jewish community enduring “a summer of terror”,
  it had been gaslit by some quarters. “Those who sought to downplay the threat
  against the Jewish community or dismiss the campaign of terror targeting our
  community as a criminal con-job or hoax owe the Jewish community an apology.”
  He added that the Iranian-Australian community in Australia – “most of whom
  despise the despotic Iranian regime” – should not be held responsible for
  Iran’s actions. The Australian Iranian Community Alliance said the moment
  marked a “historic turning point” in Australia’s approach to the Islamic
  Republic. “Let us be clear: this is not a diplomatic disagreement with a
  sovereign nation. This is a countermeasure against a transnational criminal
  enterprise that has hijacked a country, plundered its resources, destabilised
  a region, and targeted innocent lives globally – including here in Australia,”
  the AICA vice-president, Suren Edgar, said. Klein said the Adass community had
  been well-supported by the Victorian police, including through weekly meetings
  at which the synagogue’s leaders had repeatedly raised the possibility of
  Iran’s involvement in the attack. “They have managed to piece it together.
  [The government’s] strong stance is quite significant and we applaud it, we’re
  very grateful.”
