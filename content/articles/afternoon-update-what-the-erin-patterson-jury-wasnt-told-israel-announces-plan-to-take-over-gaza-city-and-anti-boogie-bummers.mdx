  Good afternoon. New material and claims that were not allowed to be heard by
  the jury in Erin Patterson’s triple murder trial have now been made public,
  after an interim suppression order was lifted. One argument heard in court,
  but ruled inadmissible by the trial judge, involved police suspicions that
  Patterson might have previously used rat poison in an alleged attempt to kill
  her estranged husband, Simon. The pre-trial hearings also heard that Simon had
  told his father, Don, and other family members of his suspicions before the
  fatal beef wellington lunch in July 2023, but that “he thought he was the only
  person she was targeting, and that [his relatives] would be safe”. Meanwhile,
  the Victorian supreme court has released redacted footage of Patterson’s
  interview with police, conducted a week after the fatal lunch, in which she
  told police she did not own a dehydrator nor ever foraged for mushrooms –
  evidence she later admitted in court were lies. This interview was played to
  the jury during the trial but has not been released publicly until now. Top
