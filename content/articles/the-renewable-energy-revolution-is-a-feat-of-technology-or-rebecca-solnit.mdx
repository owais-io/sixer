  I know progressives are supposed to be technophobes, but there is one
  technology we probably love more than anyone else (except the engineers who
  created it): renewable energy. It is nothing less than astonishing and
  unbelievable that we have achieved so much progress in so little time. At the
  turn of the century, sun and wind in the form of solar panels and wind
  turbines were expensive, primitive, utterly inadequate solutions to power our
  machines at scale, which is why early climate activism focused a lot on
  minimizing consumption on the assumption we had no real alternative to burning
  fossil fuels, but maybe we could burn less. This era did all too well in
  convincing people that if we did what the climate needs of us, we would be
  entering an era of austerity and renunciation, and it helped power the fossil
  fuel industry’s weaponization of climate footprints to make people think
  personal virtue in whittling down our consumption was the key thing. There’s
  nothing wrong with being modest in your consumption, but the key thing to
  saving the planet is whittling down the fossil fuel industry and use of fossil
  fuels to almost nothing by making the energy transition to renewables and an
  electrified world. And that’s a transformation that has to be collective and
  not just individual. Other stuff is great – changing our diets, especially to
  reduce beef consumption and food waste, protecting natural systems that
  sequester carbon, better urban design and better public transit, getting rid
  of fast fashion, excessive use of plastic, and other wasteful climate-harming
  forms of consumption – all matter. But the majority of climate change comes
  from burning fossil fuels, and we know exactly how to transition away from
  that and the transition is underway – not nearly fast enough, not nearly
  supported enough by most governments around the world, actively undermined by
  the Trump administration and many fossil fuel corporations and states. But
  still, it is underway. And, arguably, unstoppable. Because it’s just a better
  way to do everything. One thing that’s been striking in recent years, and
  maybe visible in recent years because there is now an alternative, is the
  admission that fossil fuel is a wasteful and poisonous way to produce energy.
  That’s the case whether it’s to move a vehicle or cook a dinner. Oil, coal,
  and gas are distributed unevenly around the world and just moving the fuel to
  the sites where it will be used is hugely energy inefficient. About 40% of
  global shipping is just moving fossil fuel around, and more fuel is moved on
  trains and trucks. But also, fossil fuel is extracted, shipped, and refined
  for one purpose: to be burned, and in the future coming fast, burning is going
  to look like a primitive way to operate machines. As the Rocky Mountain
  Institute explains it: “Today, most energy is wasted along the way. Out of the
  606 EJ [exajoules] of primary energy that entered the global energy system in
  2019, some 33% (196 EJ) was lost on the supply side due to energy production
  and transportation losses before it ever reached a consumer. Another 30% (183
  EJ) was lost on the demand side turning final energy into useful energy. That
  means that of the 606 EJ we put into our energy system per annum, only 227 EJ
  ended up providing useful energy, like heating a home or moving a truck. That
  is only 37% efficient overall.” That’s the old system, and it’s dirty, toxic
  to human health and the environment – and our politics – as well as the main
  driver of climate chaos. And wasteful. The new system, on the other hand, is
  far cleaner, and the fact that sun and wind are so widely available means that
  the corrosive politics of producer nations and their manipulations of
  dependent consumer nations could become a thing of the past. I know someone is
  about to pipe up with an objection about battery materials and there are two
  answers to that. One is that the race is on, with promising results, to
  produce batteries with more commonly available and widely distributed
  materials. The other is that batteries are not like fossil fuel, which you
  incessantly burn up and have to replace; they are largely recyclable, and once
  the necessary material is gathered, it can be reused and extraction can wind
  down. But also the scale of materials needed for renewables is dwarfed by the
  materials to keep the fires burning in the fossil fuel economy (and the people
  who complain about extraction sometimes seem to forget about the monumental
  scale of fossil fuel extraction and all the forms of damage it generates, from
  Alberta to Nigeria to the Amazon). And renewables are now adequate to meet
  almost all our needs, as experts like Australia’s Saul Griffiths and
  California’s Mark Z Jacobson have mapped out. Simply because it’s cheaper,
  better and ultimately more reliable, the transition is inevitable – but if we
  do it fast, we stabilize the climate and limit the destruction, and if we
  don’t, we don’t. Almost no one has summed up how huge the shifts are since the
  year 2000, but the Rocky Mountain Institute has done that for the last decade,
  during which, they tell us: “clean-tech costs have fallen by up to 80%, while
  investment is up nearly tenfold and solar generation has risen twelvefold.
  Electricity has become the largest source of useful energy, and the deep force
  of efficiency has reduced energy demand by a fifth.” Estimates for the future
  price of solar have almost always been overestimates; estimates for the
  implementation of solar have been underestimates. Another hangover from early
  in the millennium is the idea that renewables are expensive. They were.
  They’re not anymore. There are costs involved in building new systems, of
  course, but solar power is now the cheapest way to produce electricity in most
  of the world, and there’s no sign that the plummet in costs is stopping. As
  Hannah Ritchie at Our World in Data said in 2021 of renewable energy: “In
  2009, it was more than three times as expensive as coal. Now the script has
  flipped, and a new solar plant is almost three times cheaper than a new coal
  one. The price of electricity from solar declined by 89% between 2009 and
  2019.” But even cheap is a misnomer: wind and sun are free and inexhaustible;
  you just need devices to collect the energy and transform it into electricity
  (and transmission lines to distribute it). Free energy! We need to get people
  to recognize that is what’s on offer, along with energy independence – the
  real version, whereby if we do it right, we could build cooperatives, local
  (and hyperlocal or just autonomous individual) energy systems, thereby
  undermining predatory for-profit utilities companies as well as the fossil
  fuel industry. Renewable energy could be energy justice and energy democracy,
  as well as clean energy. An energy revolution is underway in this century,
  though it’s unfolded in ways slow enough and technical enough for most people
  not to notice (and I assume it’s nowhere near finished). It is astonishing – a
  powerful solution to the climate crisis and the depredations of the fossil
  fuel industry and for-profit utilities. Making it more visible would make more
  people more enthused about it as a solution, a promise, a possibility we can,
  should, must pursue swiftly and wholeheartedly. Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian
  US columnist. She is the author of No Straight Road Takes You There and
  Orwell’s Roses
