  to seize control of Gaza City

  Displaced repeatedly. Forced to live in tent camps or amid the ruins of their
  homes. Stricken by hunger and deprived of medical supplies. Now, 22 months
  into the war, around 1 million Palestinians are bracing for another
  catastrophe after the Israeli security cabinet’s decision to take control of
  Gaza City. Such an offensive would force them toward the south of the
  territory, and an uncertain future. “Since this morning, after hearing the
  news of evacuation of Gaza City, I have been feeling anxious and afraid,” said
  Umm Ibrahim Banat, a 55-year-old mother originally from northern Gaza, who has
  already been displaced four times. “Where will we go with the children and the
  elderly? I swear we are exhausted from displacement, starvation, and being
  driven from one place to another.” “Now,” she said, “We are the walking dead.”
  After a 10-hour overnight meeting, the Israeli prime minister Benjamin
  Netanyahu’s office announced on Friday that his security cabinet had approved
  a plan to take over Gaza City, marking another escalation of Israel’s
  offensive that has killed at least 61,000 Palestinians, most of them
  civilians. According to Israel’s Channel 12 the plan, which would mean sending
  ground troops into the territory, could displace tens of thousands of people
  and further disrupt efforts to deliver food to the territory and force
  approximately 1 million Palestinians in Gaza City and other areas into
  evacuation areas in the southern part of the strip. “Gaza has been completely
  destroyed – what more can they do?”, said Banat, whose daughter Maryam was
  killed with her husband and children. “We have lost the best of our youth; our
  territory is a huge prison besieged by land, sea and air; the destruction has
  become unbearable; diseases are spreading, tents stretch as far as the eye can
  see, water is contaminated, prices are insane, hospitals are in ruins, our
  lives are utterly tragic! What more do they want?” The timing of another
  Israeli major ground operation is unclear since it is likely to require
  mobilising thousands of troops. However, according to sources familiar with
  the details of the meeting, the evacuation of Gaza City is scheduled to be
  completed by 7 October. It is unclear how many people still reside in the
  city, which was Gaza’s largest centre of population before the war. In the
  opening weeks of the conflict in 2023, hundreds of thousands fled under
  evacuation orders in the opening weeks of the conflict, but many returned
  during a ceasefire at the start of this year. Although residents of Gaza City
  say they have not yet received an evacuation order, many are already preparing
  to leave once again, hoping to find a safe place to live in the south. “If we
  are ordered to evacuate, I will leave everything and go, fearing for my family
  and children,” says Abu Nasser Mushtaha, 35, a father of four and a resident
  of Gaza’s Rimal neighbourhood. “The cost of staying would be too high. I have
  already lost enough; my mother was killed at the beginning of the war when the
  Israeli occupation bombed a neighbouring house.” “I have already started
  making a financial plan to reduce expenses and planning to move only the
  essential items, said Mushtaha, before concluding: “This will, without a
  doubt, be the end of Gaza’s people.” Palestinians, at least 90% of whom have
  already been displaced at least once by the war and of whom nearly one in 10
  have been injured in Israeli attacks, are braced for further misery. There is
  little remaining of the healthcare system, and aid agencies such as the UN
  have been largely shut out by Israel. The war has already forced thousands to
  find refuge in cities such as Khan Younis and Rafah. Now, with both reduced to
  little more than rubble, it is unclear where civilians escaping the new
  offensive can hope to live. For this reason, while thousands are already
  planning yet another flight, just as many are determined to remain in Gaza
  City – even if it means risking their lives. “How can all these people be
  emptied into the south, which is already overcrowded?” asked Hossam al-Saqa,
  46, a father of two from Gaza City. “We are staying in our homes and on our
  land, holding on to them. I will not leave, even if all the weapons are
  pointed at my head.” “I see Netanyahu’s and Israel’s propaganda as nothing
  more than media fireworks meant to intimidate and spread fear among the
  people,” he said. “This will not scare us, for God is with us, and He is
  stronger than everyone.” Al-Saqa, like others in Gaza City, said he saw the
  occupation plan as an attempt to pressure Hamas into accepting surrender after
  talks mediated by the US, Egypt and Qatar appeared to have broken down last
  month. “This is our land where we grew up since childhood, and we will not
  give it up easily,” said Ibrahim Abu al-Husni, 47, who lost his eldest son,
  who was 23, during the war. “I will not leave this city.” “I will live here,”
  he said, And I will die here.”
