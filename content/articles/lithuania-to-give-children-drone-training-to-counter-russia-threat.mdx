  Children in Lithuania are to be taught how to build and operate drones as part
  of the small Baltic country’s efforts to build capacity to deal with any
  future threat from Russia. In a joint initiative by the defence and education
  ministries, the government said on Tuesday it hoped to teach more than 22,000
  people, including schoolchildren, drone skills as part of an attempt to
  “expand civil resistance training”. The programme would be adapted to
  different age groups, with third- and fourth-grade students of between eight
  and 10 years old learning to build and pilot simple drones, the government
  said. Secondary school students will design and manufacture drone parts and
  learn how to build and fly advanced drones. Like its neighbours Estonia and
  Latvia, Lithuania, a country of 2.8 million people that borders the Russian
  exclave of Kaliningrad and Moscow’s ally Belarus, has been on high alert for
  war ever since Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The perception
  of a Russian threat in the Baltic states was underlined on Wednesday by the
  expulsion of a Russian diplomat from Estonia. Estonia’s foreign minister,
  Margus Tsahkna, said it was due to “ongoing interference” in the state’s
  affairs. “The diplomat in question has been directly and actively involved in
  undermining the constitutional order and legal system of Estonia … The Russian
  embassy’s ongoing interference in the internal affairs of the Republic of
  Estonia must end,” Tsahkna said. In Lithuania, the government plans to spend
  €3.3m (£2.9m) on specialist equipment including indoor and outdoor
  first-person-view drones, control and video transmission systems and a mobile
  app for training on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The defence minister,
  Dovilė Šakalienė, said: “We plan that 15,500 adults and 7,000 children will
  acquire drone control skills by 2028. In September we will open drone control
  centres in Jonava, Tauragė and Kėdainiai, and we will open six more drone
  training centres in other regions of Lithuania by 2028.” The training will be
  conducted by the Lithuanian riflemen’s union in conjunction with the
  Lithuanian non-formal education agency, which will train children in primary
  and secondary schools. Tomas Godliauskas, Lithuania’s vice-minister of
  national defence, said the training would take the form of extracurricular
  courses which would deepen children’s “technical literacy”. “The youngest
  participants will engage in simple drone construction and piloting through
  games and experiments. Secondary students will learn programming basics
  alongside indoor drone piloting and construction, while upper secondary
  students will design 3D drone parts and construct FPV drones,” he said.
  Lithuania has been increasing its focus on drone technology, with UAVs
  extensively used for counter-drone capabilities over its borders after two
  incidents in July when two suspected Russian drones crossed from Belarus into
  Lithuanian territory. In Russia the training of children in drones has been
  controversial, with revelations last month over the alleged systematic
  involvement of children in the design and testing of the technology using
  video games.
