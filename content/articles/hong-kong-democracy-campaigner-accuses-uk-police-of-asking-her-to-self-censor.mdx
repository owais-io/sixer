  ‘self-censor’

  A former Hong Kong politician and prominent democracy campaigner has accused
  British police of asking her to “self-censor” and “retreat from public life”
  after officers asked her to agree to avoid public gatherings. The request,
  outlined in a signed “memorandum of understanding” seen by the Guardian, has
  alarmed exiled dissidents who fear it may embolden attempts to silence
  criticism of Chinese and Hong Kong officials worldwide. Carmen Lau, who moved
  to the UK in 2021, was asked to sign the formal agreement in March by Thames
  Valley police after her neighbours were posted letters offering a £100,000
  bounty for information on her movements or for her being taken to authorities.
  Thames Valley police requested Lau “cease any activity that is likely to put
  you at risk” and “avoid attending public gatherings” such as protests. Lau is
  wanted by Hong Kong authorities for allegedly contravening the territory’s
  national security law, which grants sweeping extraterritorial powers to
  prosecute acts or comments made anywhere in the world that it deems criminal.
  She also works with the Hong Kong Democracy Council, a Washington-based
  organisation dedicated to “raising international support for the advancement
  of its democracy and human rights”. Tony Chung, a democracy activist who was
  jailed under Hong Kong’s national security law but now lives in the UK, was
  also the subject of near-identical letters requesting British citizens inform
  on him. While Hong Kong authorities have denied sending the letters, the UK
  foreign and home secretaries believe they are an example of “transnational
  repression” and have called on “Chinese and Hong Kong authorities to end the
  deliberate targeting of opposition voices”. On Friday, David Lammy and Yvette
  Cooper vowed to protect the “rights and freedoms” of exiled activists in the
  UK. But Lau believes detailed instructions from Thames Valley police in March,
  days after the letters were discovered, only amplified foreign attempts to
  silence her. The bounty letter, which is cited in the memorandum of
  understanding, states that Lau is wanted due to the political content of her
  speeches and social media posts that have criticised Hong Kong authorities.
  Lau regularly gives speeches criticising the Chinese government’s targeting of
  dissidents, including at demonstrations in London. She said the force
  “essentially told me to self-censor”, adding she felt she had no option but to
  agree to the request when uniformed officers came to her house, but has not
  stopped campaigning. “It is alarming that, instead of safeguarding my right to
  speak and gather freely in the UK, the response shifts responsibility on to me
  to limit my basic freedoms in the face of China’s transnational repression,”
  Lau said. “In effect, this mirrors the very outcome the Chinese and Hong Kong
  authorities are seeking: silencing dissent through fear and isolation. A truly
  democratic response should centre on protecting the rights of those targeted,
  not advising them to retreat from public life.” Thames Valley police said:
  “While we do not comment on individual cases, we will inform residents if
  there is any assessed threat to their wellbeing. “As part of our routine
  approach to prevention, we also provide guidance on steps individuals can
  consider to enhance their personal safety. “It is ultimately the choice of the
  individual whether or not they follow this advice.” Melbourne-based Kevin Yam,
  who was the subject of almost identical bounty letters and is also wanted for
  his criticism of Hong Kong authorities, said the request was starkly different
  to the approach taken by Australian police, which “always treated me as the
  victim in the situation”. “I am dismayed by the UK authorities’ tepid
  responses to the letter dropping campaign against Carmen Lau and Tony Chung,
  to the point that I believe it has emboldened the perpetrators to try their
  luck in another country, namely Australia,” Yam said. The bounty letters are
  being separately investigated by the Metropolitan police’s counter-terrorism
  unit. In a statement, the force said it was “alive to any attempts from across
  borders to target or threaten individuals who are in the UK and we continue to
  work extremely closely with our intelligence and security partners in the UK
  and abroad”. In Australia, letters targeting Yam and another former Hong Kong
  politician, Ted Hui, are being investigated by the national counter foreign
  influence taskforce, led by the national domestic intelligence agency and
  police force. Hui said the memorandum of understanding was “deeply concerning”
  and “makes it sound as if Carmen is the troublemaker and that the
  responsibility for her rests solely on her own self-censorship”. On Saturday,
  Hong Kong’s national security police issued arrest warrants for 19 activists
  based overseas, accusing them of breaching its national security law. The
  activists are also subject to bounties. Lammy and Cooper’s criticism of the
  warrants as “transnational repression” was dismissed by the Chinese embassy in
  the UK, which said the remarks constituted a “gross interference” in China’s
  internal affairs and the rule of law in Hong Kong.
