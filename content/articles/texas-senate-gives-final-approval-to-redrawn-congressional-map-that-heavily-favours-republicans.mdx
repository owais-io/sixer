  The Texas senate has given final approval to a redrawn congressional map that
  gives Republicans a chance to pick up as many as five congressional seats,
  fulfilling a brazen political request from Donald Trump to shore up the GOP’s
  standing before next year’s midterm elections. It will now be sent to governor
  Greg Abbott, a Republican, who is expected to quickly sign it into law,
  however Democrats have vowed to challenge it in court. The Texas house of
  representatives approved the map on Wednesday on an 88-52 party-line vote,
  before the senate approved it early on Saturday. The effort by Trump and
  Texas’ Republican-majority Legislature prompted state Democrats to hold a
  two-week walkout and kicked off a wave of redistricting efforts across the
  country. Democrats had prepared for a final show of resistance, with plans to
  push the senate vote into the early morning hours in a last-ditch attempt to
  delay passage. Senator Carol Alvarado revealed her filibuster plans to delay
  its final passage, in a post on social media. “Republicans think they can walk
  all over us. Today I’m going to kick back,” Alvarado’s post read. “I’ve
  submitted my intention to filibuster the new congressional maps. Going to be a
  long night.” But the planned filibuster was thwarted by a procedural motion by
  Republicans. It now heads to the governor for final approval. Alvarado’s delay
  tactics were the latest chapter in a weeks-long showdown that has roiled the
  Texas Legislature, marked by a Democratic walkout and threats of arrest from
  Republicans. Democrats had already delayed the bill’s passage during hours of
  debate, pressing senator Phil King, the measure’s sponsor, on the proposal’s
  legality, with many alleging that the redrawn districts violated the Voting
  Rights Act by diluting voters’ influence based on race – an accusation King
  vehemently denied. “I had two goals in mind: that all maps would be legal and
  would be better for Republican congressional candidates in Texas,” said King,
  a Republican. “There is extreme risk the Republican majority will be lost” in
  the US House if the map does not pass, King said. The vote comes after
  California Democrats set a special election for November in which they will
  ask voters to approve a new congressional map in their state. That map would
  add up to five seats for Democrats, a move designed to offset the new map in
  Texas. California governor Gavin Newsom launched that effort after Texas began
  its push to redraw its maps. Republicans currently hold 25 of Texas’s 38
  congressional districts. Under the redrawn map, they would be favored in 30
  districts. Abbott called a special session last month to draw new maps after
  Trump requested that he do so. The new map eliminates Democratic-held
  districts in Austin, Houston and the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex and replaces
  them with Republican ones. It also tweaks the lines of two districts currently
  held by Democrats in south Texas to make them more friendly to Republicans.
  Swift lawsuits are expected challenging the new districts under the Voting
  Rights Act amid allegations the new lines make it harder for voters of color
  to elect their preferred candidates. Lawmakers passed the maps after Democrats
  in the Texas house of representatives left the state for two weeks, denying
  Republicans the necessary quorum to conduct legislative business. The
  Democrats returned to the state on Monday after California Democrats began
  moving ahead with a plan to redraw their state’s congressional map. Even after
  Democrats returned to Austin, protests continued at the state capitol this
  week as Republicans pushed the new map through. The efforts were galvanized by
  Nicole Collier, a Democratic state representative from Fort Worth who refused
  to sign a “permission slip” necessary to leave the house floor. Collier
  refused and remained confined to the house floor and her office until
  Wednesday. The Texas push set off an unusual mid-decade redistricting battle
  before next year’s midterm elections, in which Republicans are expected to
  lose seats in the US House. Republicans currently have a three-seat majority
  and the president’s party typically performs poorly in a midterm election.
  Republicans are also expected to redraw the maps in Florida, Ohio, Missouri
  and potentially Indiana. With the Associated Press
