  “Basically, there’s summat wrong with me. I’m like … a psychopath. Genuinely!”
  A teenage girl with the face of an angel is confiding in Mr Wilson, one of the
  student managers. He listens solemnly, but his mouth twitches with the
  beginnings of a smile. “I’m going to start by disagreeing with you,” he says
  with all the seriousness he can muster. “You’re not a psychopath.” The girl in
  the sky-blue hoodie relaxes and rewards him with a broad smile. Welcome back
  to Thornhill Community academy on the outskirts of Dewsbury for Educating
  Yorkshire Part 2, where once again the 900 pupils – witty, sensitive, smart,
  vulnerable and endlessly engaging – are the standout stars of the series. Much
  has changed in schools since Channel 4 last filmed at Thornhill more than a
  decade ago. TikTok, vapes, Andrew Tate, gender-questioning, anxiety, mobile
  phones and high levels of school absence are now everyday issues across the
  sector. And of course there was Covid – the biggest disruptor to education
  since the second world war. Negotiating these challenges is Matthew Burton,
  42, the inspirational English teacher from the last series who moved the
  entire nation with his efforts to help Musharaf, a year 11 student, overcome
  his stammer. He is now headteacher. A decade on he strides around Thornhill in
  his new hi-vis gilet, with the words “Work hard, be nice” emblazoned on his
  back, his warmth, humour and enthusiasm undimmed. “Nobody goes into teaching
  for life to be easy, because schools aren’t,” he said in an interview with the
  Guardian. “There’s lots of complexities to being in schools and being a
  teacher, but also, it’s such a unique profession. “You genuinely get the
  chance 99 times out of a 100 to go home at the end of the day having done
  something positive for somebody, and there aren’t that many professions where
  you get that opportunity.” Mr Burton has allowed the cameras back into his
  now-famous secondary school because there’s a teacher recruitment crisis in
  education and he wants to help. He wants everyone to know what a great
  profession it is and how brilliant it is to work with young people. “Some of
  the stuff around schools and education can be really challenging as a teacher
  to read and it doesn’t always align with my thinking,” he says. “It is a
  fantastic, fantastic profession. “These are the remarkable and amazing young
  people who you’re working with. This is what it’s about – speaking on behalf
  of the profession, demonstrating some of the challenges but also some of the
  absolutely fantastic things that happen in schools.” So what has changed since
  the first series was broadcast in 2013? “One of the biggest changes has been
  how much technology has advanced,” he says promptly. “Children are going round
  with mobile phones in their pockets which are incredibly powerful computers
  that can effectively do pretty much anything you want them to.” In one
  episode, where pupils are discussing screen time, it emerges that some
  children are on their mobile phone for more than 15 hours a day, despite a
  school-wide ban. “If it’s seen, heard or used it’s confiscated, and that’s the
  bottom line,” says Burton. In other scenes a boy is found hiding a vape down
  his trousers, AI proves a growing challenge and teachers find themselves
  dealing with the long tail of Covid, supporting growing numbers of pupils with
  mental health issues and special educational needs. Episode one features Riley
  in year 8, who’s blond, bright and getting in trouble. “What happens in my
  head, it’s just a mess,” he says, wide-eyed. His mum thinks he has attention
  deficit hyperactive disorder; the school wonders if it’s his diet and
  experiments with reducing his sugar. Riley just wants to know why he can’t sit
  still. Then there’s Amy, also year 8, who goes to school only for the hash
  browns (“sent from the heavens above”) and her friends. But the stresses and
  strains of teenage friendship sometimes prove too much for her. She has
  developed tics and often wanders into the student manager’s office. “In my
  friendship group I want everyone to be happy,” she says sadly after being
  blanked by one of her mates. “One of the things that always impresses me about
  students is how aware of their emotions they are and how emotionally literate
  they are and vulnerable when they need that support,” said 42-year-old Burton,
  now a father to three children. “I don’t think we’ve ever had a generation of
  young people who will be as open about wanting and needing that support and
  that help.” But it’s hard. Times have changed, even since the last series and
  life for many children has become more challenging. “The world’s different,
  isn’t it?” says Burton. “It’s a very complex place to be in, a very complex
  time to live.” • Educating Yorkshire Part 2 is on Channel 4 on Sunday at 8pm
