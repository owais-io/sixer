  Rachel Reeves will need to raise taxes to close a government spending gap that
  is on course to reach more than £40bn after a slowdown in economic growth and
  higher-than-expected inflation, according to a leading thinktank. In a blow to
  Labour’s hopes of balancing the books without breaking manifesto commitments
  ruling out personal tax rises, the National Institute of Economic and Social
  Research (NIESR) said a number of factors would knock off course the
  chancellor’s plans to stay within Whitehall spending limits. These factors
  included headwinds from Donald Trump’s tariff war, higher debt interest
  payments and U-turns on welfare spending cuts. NIESR said “moderate but
  sustained” tax rises would be needed in the autumn budget for Reeves to
  overcome a deficit of £41.2bn and then restore a near £10bn buffer in the
  current budget, forcing the Treasury to raise more than £51bn from taxes,
  secure extra borrowing or use severe cost-cutting measures to find extra
  savings. With extra borrowing likely to spook financial markets and ministers
  already struggling to stay within departmental spending limits, the thinktank
  said tax rises would be the most likely option. A rise of 5p in the pound on
  the basic and higher rate of income tax would fill the budget gap, NIESR said,
  though it recommended a broader review of tax rates and an overhaul of
  Reeves’s budget rules as a way to balance the books and bring greater
  stability to the public finances. Stephen Millard, a senior economist at
  NIESR, said: “We think the current budget deficit will be around £40bn, or
  £41.2bn to be precise. It means if the chancellor wants to maintain a buffer
  of £9.9bn then she will have to find £51.1bn, either in extra taxes or lower
  spending or both, annually, by 2029-30.” He said NIESR recommended a bigger
  buffer. “To do that requires a moderate but sustained increase in taxes.” Last
  month the chancellor warned ministers that taxes would have to rise after the
  government scrapped restrictions on welfare payments, without indicating which
  taxes would be affected. There is already a long queue of claims by public
  sector workers for higher wage rises, adding to already rising pressures on
  the public purse that includes higher spending on immigration and the courts
  system to defence and education. Backbench Labour MPs, emboldened after
  successful campaigns against cuts to winter fuel allowance and disability
  support payments, are expected to challenge the Labour leadership if manifesto
  spending pledges are scrapped in the budget to reduce the deficit. NIESR said
  its updated analysis from the spring meant it expected the Bank of England to
  reduce the cost of borrowing from 4.25% to 3.75% by the end of the year, but
  the cuts will arrive too late to boost growth. Speculation has mounted over
  which taxes Reeves will raise, with current favourites an extension to the
  freeze on income tax bands and a cut to the current cash Isa limit. NIESR said
  a freeze on tax thresholds, bringing more households into higher tax bands,
  would raise about £8bn while a rise in income tax to 25p for the basic rate
  and 45p for the standard rate would close the gap entirely. David Aikman, the
  NIESR director, said: “It will be crucial for the chancellor to restore market
  confidence by demonstrating fiscal discipline. This will require a determined
  attempt to rebuild the fiscal buffer and that will inevitably involve gradual
  but sustained tax increases or spending cuts.” A projection by the Office for
  Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government independent forecaster, to
  coincide with the chancellor’s spring statement in March showed the deficit
  falling in the 2025-26 financial year. However, official figures have shown
  public finances already beginning to veer off track since April. Across the
  first three months of fiscal year 2025-2026, the budget deficit was £44.5bn,
  £5bn higher than the OBR’s forecast. A Conservative spokesperson, Mel Stride,
  blamed the government for mismanaging the economy and “always reaching for the
  tax rise lever because they don’t understand the economy”. He said:
  “Businesses are closing, unemployment is up, inflation has doubled and the
  economy is shrinking. And Labour are refusing to rule out more damaging tax
  rises on investment.”
