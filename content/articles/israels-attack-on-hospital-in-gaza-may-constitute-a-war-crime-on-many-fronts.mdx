  Israel’s twin strike on the Nasser hospital in Gaza, which killed five
  journalists including staff working for the Associated Press, Reuters, NBC and
  Al Jazeera, is a potential violation of international law writ large. The
  attack targeted a civilian building, specifically a hospital, in a reckless
  double-tap strike that killed civilians, with rescue workers and journalists
  among them. All categories that should be protected under international law.
  While the Israel Defense Forces, which have killed about 200 journalists
  already in the Gaza war, immediately attempted to suggest the killing of
  civilians had been in error, the reality is that it appears to be policy and
  not a mistake. What is striking about this incident is that each individual
  element – the targeting of a working hospital, of journalists and rescue
  workers, of civilian injured already under treatment – would be expected to
  draw accusations of a war crime in its own right. Taken together it points to
  something far darker, a “horrific” incident in the words of the British
  foreign secretary, David Lammy. As well as the 20 killed in the strikes,
  another 50 were injured according to the head of the World Health
  Organization, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, including patients who were
  already critically ill. “While people in Gaza are being starved, their already
  limited access to health care is being further crippled by repeated attacks,”
  Ghebreyesus said on X. “We cannot say it loudly enough: STOP attacks on health
  care. Ceasefire now!” Explicitly linking the issues, the UN human rights
  office spokesperson, Ravina Shamdasani, said in a statement: “The killing of
  journalists in Gaza should shock the world – not into stunned silence but into
  action, demanding accountability and justice. Journalists are not a target.
  Hospitals are not a target.” It has been well documented how Israel has
  targeted hospitals and medical staff, who have been killed, wounded and
  abducted, on multiple occasions. But the reckless double-tap strike, where the
  IDF attacks a location for a second time as rescue workers and other civilians
  arrive, say critics, is an increasingly common tactic. A joint investigation
  in July by the Israeli +972 Magazine and Local Call reported that the IDF now
  routinely carried out additional attacks in the area of an initial bombing,
  sometimes intentionally killing paramedics and others involved in rescue
  efforts. “If there’s a strike on a senior commander, another one will be
  carried out afterward to ensure rescue efforts don’t take place,” said one of
  +972’s sources who it said was present in an Israeli attack planning cell.
  “First responders, rescue teams – they kill them. They strike again, on top of
  them.” While the IDF said it had launched an investigation into the attack,
  adding that its forces “in no way direct strikes at journalists”, Israeli
  officials’ own public remarks reveal that to be a lie. The claim is directly
  contradicted by Israel’s own statement after the killing of Anas al-Sharif, a
  well-known Al Jazeera journalist, and four colleagues – again in the grounds
  of a hospital – earlier this month when it claimed without providing credible
  evidence that Sharif was targeted as a member of a Hamas cell. As the
  Committee to Protect Journalists said in a statement after Sharif’s killing by
  Israel: “The IDF have made unsubstantiated claims that many of the journalists
  they deliberately killed in Gaza were terrorists, including four Al Jazeera
  staff – Hamza al-Dahdouh, Ismail al-Ghoul, Rami al-Refee, and Hossam Shabat.
  CPJ classifies such cases as murder.” Indeed, before Sharif’s death, the CPJ
  publicly warned that his life was in danger after credible threats were made
  by a named Israeli military spokesperson. “We are deeply alarmed by the
  repeated threats made by Israeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee against Al
  Jazeera’s Gaza correspondent Anas al-Sharif and call on the international
  community to protect him,” said the CPJ regional director Sara Qudah. “This is
  not the first time Sharif has been targeted by the Israeli military, but the
  danger to his life is now acute. Israel has killed at least six Al Jazeera
  journalists in Gaza during this war. These latest unfounded accusations
  represent an effort to manufacture consent to kill Sharif.” And it is
  significant that Israel has killed journalists in the vicinity of hospitals.
  Since the beginning of the war, journalists have often stayed near hospitals
  in the hope they might provide a slight degree of protection, and because they
  often have at least some electricity where media can charge phones and
  equipment. For some senior UN figures, the only conclusion to be drawn from
  these attacks is that Israel is killing the world’s only available witnesses
  to the starvation it has visited on Gaza through its policies. Among them on
  Monday was the head of the UN’s agency for Palestinians, Philippe Lazzarini,
  as he condemned the “shocking” global inaction over Gaza, accusing Israel of
  “silencing the last remaining voices reporting about children dying silently
  amid famine”. That sentiment was echoed in the strongest terms by the
  emergency coordinator for Médecins Sans Frontières in Gaza, Jerome Grimaud,
  mourning the death of the journalist Mariam Dagga, who had worked with the
  humanitarian organisation. “For the past 22 months, we have watched as
  healthcare facilities have been levelled, journalists silenced, and healthcare
  workers buried beneath the rubble by the Israeli forces. As Israel continues
  to shun international law, the only witnesses of their genocidal campaign are
  deliberately being targeted. It must stop now.”
