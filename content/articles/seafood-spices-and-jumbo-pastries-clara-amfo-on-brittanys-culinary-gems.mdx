  I’ve spent a lot of my life going at an incredibly fast pace. Living in a big
  city and working as a broadcaster, I’m always rushing from one thing to the
  next. So when I was invited to explore the local culinary delights of
  Brittany, it was a great excuse to slow everything down and travel there with
  Brittany Ferries. I don’t think I’ve been on a ferry since a year 7 trip to
  France. But it was really refreshing to move at a slower pace and actually
  enjoy the journey. I also found it fascinating to be part of this
  micro-community of sorts; a floating vessel of people in the middle of the
  sea. We had an evening crossing from Portsmouth, which meant dinner in Le
  Littoral, one of the Saint-Malo ship’s restaurants, and afterwards, an early
  night in my cute cabin. I slept so well. When I woke up in the morning, I
  decided to go for a dawn walk along the top deck. The French tricolour was
  flying, the sun was breaking and as we pulled into Saint-Malo port, a
  lighthouse framing the scene, it looked just like a postcard. It was such a
  lovely moment – and something I’d have completely missed had I flown. But
  first, croissants … When I’m on holiday, I’m definitely a curious person. My
  first thought is always, what’s the best gallery here; where can I get a great
  coffee or what’s the local delicacy I’ve got to try? When I was in New
  Orleans, I was obsessed with finding the best beignets, or in Ghana, it was
  all about the best jollof. So, after docking, I quickly zoned in on a local
  bakery and had a pain au chocolat – which cost about €1 – and was so
  delicious, plus double the size of British ones. I also wanted to try oysters
  from Cancale, a pretty town to the east of Saint-Malo, which is known as the
  oyster capital of Brittany. There, a lovely guy called Olivier showed me how
  to properly shuck an oyster. After putting on a protective chain mail glove,
  he explained there’s a certain rhythm to oyster shucking. A couple of
  incisions and a few cracks later, and the shell opened to reveal the oyster.
  Enjoying oysters on the sea steps after a lesson in shucking Olivier presented
  them beautifully on a platter, with a wedge of lemon, and I took a little
  moment to myself to sit on the sea steps and enjoy the oysters while taking in
  the views. The whole point of going on this trip was to try things that are
  out of my comfort zone. Oyster shucking was never on my to-do list, but now
  I’m able to say that I’ve done it. And at the end, I loved chucking the shells
  in a pile so they could be washed back into the sea – giving them back to the
  ocean. One of my favourite books is Joanne Harris’s Chocolat, which meant it
  was very easy to romanticise the whole trip. One afternoon, I hired a bike and
  as I was riding alongside the picturesque Ille-et-Rance canal, I thought: “Am
  I her? Am I Joanne Harris now?” It was very cute. Cycling through Brittany;
  Maison du Beurre Bordier, an artisan butter store Visiting Maison du Beurre
  Bordier in Saint-Malo definitely had that same Chocolat-vibe. An artisan
  butter store, I got to try out eight different types, including chilli,
  raspberry, smoked salt and even seaweed, which were all banging. And the
  bread! So fresh and still warm. Bread and butter is such a simple meal, but
  it’s just the best. Julie, one of the artisans, showed me the best method of
  eating butter, and it’s not a thin spread like you’d think; it’s more of a
  full, top-of-a-thumb-sized chunk that you angle on. “I am just butter,” she
  laughed. “If you cut me I’d probably bleed butter from my veins.” As with
  Olivier, I just loved her passion. Spice girl I also got to visit Épices
  Rœllinger, a brilliant spice shop. When you first enter, it’s like walking
  into an old-fashioned curiosity shop. I could smell the cinnamon, flavoured
  salts, pepper, nutmeg, even fresh vanilla pods – it was intoxicating. I loved
  the design of the red labels on the spice jars, all laid out perfectly, and
  the owner, Daniel, filled me in on the history of the shop. I bought some
  spices to take home with me: nutmeg (needed for a good rum punch), Cajun
  spice, and a special mix called Poudre Retour des Indes, which Daniel said is
  good on fish or chicken. I used them immediately when back in the UK, and need
  to be careful not to finish them before the end of summer! Savouring the
  smells at Épices Rœllinger; tasting mead From chatting with local producers
  and trying their food, I really picked up on the feeling that everyone I met
  was vehemently proud of where they were from and what they could produce –
  whether that’s oysters, bread, butter or mead, which I also tried. Sea for
  miles: a view from the return journey to Portsmouth I’ve definitely been
  inspired to search out these types of food experiences on my future travels –
  it’s a great way to get under the skin of a new place. And travelling by ferry
  made the whole trip more relaxed and enjoyable – it was a good reminder to
  take my time and savour both the journey and the flavours. Where to stay
  Brittany Ferries offers a range of accommodation from charming gîtes and chic
  hotels to villas with their own pool. The Oceania offers stylish rooms and a
  spa in easy reach of Saint-Malo’s Intra-Muros (walled city). Don’t miss the
  new roof terrace where you can enjoy sundowners and a panoramic view of the
  port. Or, halfway between Dinard and Dinan, the Manoir de Rigourdaine is a
  former Breton farmhouse with bright rooms and river views – a great base for
  exploring. Sail into holiday mode before you even arrive. Book a Brittany
  Ferries Holiday with ferry and accommodation and save up to 30% on your
