  The boss of Chevron, one of the world’s biggest oil and gas companies, which
  reported earnings of $9bn in the last six months, has had a few gripes about
  Australia that he wanted to get off his chest. In an “exclusive” interview
  with The Australian last weekend, the company’s chief executive, Mike Wirth,
  argued he wanted Australia to be more like the US and the Middle East – and if
  it was, it would be in a better position to compete for fossil fuel investment
  dollars. Wirth revealed he had come from a private meeting with the deputy
  prime minister, Richard Marles, where he reportedly laid out why he thought
  Australia should be more like the US or the Middle East. The page-one lead
  story came with a picture of Wirth perched on a leather couch and staring
  imperiously down the lens. Sign up: AU Breaking News email When readers got to
  the bottom of the story that continued on page two, there was a disclosure
  that the reporter, Perry Williams, The Australian’s chief business
  correspondent, had “travelled to Melbourne as a guest of Chevron”. There were
  no other voices canvassed in the 950-word story, no mention of the climate
  crisis or the company’s record on greenhouse emissions. Trump’s America
  Perhaps it could be said in one sentence – such as this one – why Australia
  might not want to be like one of the Middle East’s authoritarian petrostates.
  But why might the US be a better place for the company to drill for oil and
  gas than Australia? What is it, exactly, that Australia should be aspiring to?
  Under Donald Trump, the Environmental Protection Agency has been making life
  easier for companies such as Chevron by cutting regulation. This is how the
  EPA’s administrator, Lee Zeldin, described the “greatest day of deregulation
  our nation has seen” when some of the changes were outlined in March. “We are
  driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion to
  drive down cost of living for American families, unleash American energy,
  bring auto jobs back to the US and more,” Zeldin said. There are some very
  strong Tony Abbott-era climate science denial vibes right there. Trump has
  previously described global heating as a hoax and is pulling the US out of the
  landmark Paris climate agreement. His administration also wants to rescind the
  so-called “endangerment finding” – an Obama-era ruling that gives the US
  government authority to limit greenhouse gas emissions because of the climate
  crisis. An online portal that held two decades of climate assessments has also
  been yanked by the Trump administration. To try to justify all these
  rollbacks, the US Department of Energy last week released a report it had
  commissioned from a set of scientists known for their contrarian views on
  climate change. Climate scientists have counted what they say are more than
  100 false or misleading claims in the report. So, apparently Australia should
  aspire to be more like a country that is in the process of cleansing itself of
  any scientific facts its president doesn’t like. Rising costs? Wirth
  reportedly complained the company’s costs had gone up in Australia because of
  legal challenges to projects from environment groups, rules that mean
  contractors have to be paid the same as employees if they are doing the same
  job and changes to the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax. Chevron has never paid
  PRRT, but will be liable for payments this year, the company has said, after
  changes brought in by Labor. It might be worth mentioning that when Chevron
  spoke to a Senate inquiry last year about changes to the PRRT, the company
  said: “Our view on the proposed changes, as outlined in the bill, is that they
  are proportionate and will not curtail future investment.” Alex Hillman, lead
  analyst at the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, said
  Chevron’s problems were not that Australia was “uncompetitive” but that its
  business model was facing “increasing headwinds”. “The biggest obstacle for
  fossil fuel companies like Chevron is not government regulation, but that
  renewables are increasingly out-competing LNG on cost and offering real energy
  security for emerging markets,” he said. As well as getting the page one
  treatment, and an endorsement in the paper’s editorial, Chevron also got to
  defend its failing Gorgon carbon capture project in a lead story in the
  paper’s business section on Monday. That story also came with the disclosure
  that the reporter had “travelled to Melbourne as a guest of Chevron”. Carbon
  majors What is there to say about Chevron’s climate record that didn’t make it
  into The Australian’s reporting? In Australia, Chevron’s LNG plant at Gorgon
  in Western Australia is the biggest-emitting project in the country and has
  received the equivalent of millions of dollars in tradable carbon credits
  under the government’s safeguard mechanism. Chevron is known as a “carbon
  major” because of the greenhouse gas emissions that come from its current and
  historical operations. According to a database of historical emissions,
  Chevron has been responsible for the release of more greenhouse gases than any
  other independently owned entity (there are three entities that have emitted
  more than Chevron since the 1850s – Saudi Aramco, China and the former Soviet
  Union). Chevron has targets to lower the emissions intensity of its oil and
  gas – that is, reducing the amount of CO2 and methane released during
  extraction and refining. But a fossil fuel company can still meet an
  emissions-intensity target (for which it could claim, as Chevron does, that it
  is producing “lower carbon” energy) while its overall emissions from the
  extraction, transport, refinement and ultimate burning of its products are
  going up. Groups advocating for climate action have consistently criticised
  Chevron for its climate targets and its stated goal to “grow our oil and gas
  business”. A report from Oil Change International said Chevron was
  “dangerously out of step with climate goals”. The company itself claims its
  future business strategy can still exist in a future where demand for fossil
  fuels declines and governments try to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions
  by 2050. • Graham Readfearn is Guardian Australia’s environment and climate
