  The Albanese government has announced major changes to the NDIS in an effort
  to return the scheme back its “original intent” and curb its exponential
  growth. Here’s what’s been announced and what it will mean for Australians
  accessing the scheme. What NDIS changes has the federal government announced?
  The health minister, Mark Butler, announced major changes to the scheme at the
  National Press Club on Wednesday. As foreshadowed by the Albanese government
  after the release of the NDIS review in late 2023, the federal government will
  establish “foundational supports” with the help of states and territories to
  offer more disability support outside the NDIS. The idea is that if the NDIS
  is not the only “port in the storm”, as Butler put it, not as many Australians
  with less severe disabilities will need to access it because other programs
  will be able to meet their needs. The concept was agreed upon by the states
  and territories back in a 2023 national cabinet meeting, but has lacked any
  real detail until now. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Butler said the first
  nationally consistent foundational supports system would be a new program,
  called Thriving Kids, designed to divert children with mild to moderate levels
  of developmental delay and autism from the NDIS. What exactly is the Thriving
  Kids program? The federal government will put $2bn towards Thriving Kids, a
  funding commitment that will be collectively matched by all states and
  territories. Details of what the program will deliver are still scant but are
  expected to be worked out over the next few months with the agreement of the
  states and territories. Butler flagged changes to Medicare to offer
  bulk-billed checks for children at three years old to detect developmental
  delays. Children who require additional support could then access things like
  occupational, speech or psychosocial therapies through new Medicare allied
  health items (subsidised appointments). In an opinion piece for the Nine
  outlets, Butler said trained practitioners were already facilitating
  play-based developmental activities in early childhood centres and schools
  around the country. The minister said the program will begin to roll out from
  mid-2026, with plans for it to be fully realised by mid-2027. But there is
  genuine concern from disability representative groups about that timing. The
  Children and Young People with Disability Australia’s chief executive, Skye
  Kakoschke-Moore, said: “the government can’t seriously expect to set up a
  fully functional system to replace NDIS supports in under a year”. When will
  access to the NDIS change – and how? The government has indicated that access
  changes will begin from mid-2027, when Thriving Kids is intended to be fully
  rolled out. But Butler emphasised that children on the NDIS with mild to
  moderate levels of developmental delay and autism would not be removed from
  the scheme before alternative support is available. “I want to reassure
  parents, there is no way I’m going to let children slip between two stools,”
  Butler told ABC radio. “If you’re on the NDIS now, if you enter the NDIS
  before 2027, your child will be entitled to remain on the NDIS subject to all
  of those usual arrangements.” Under existing arrangements, children on a full
  NDIS plan under the age of nine are typically re-assessed every 12–24 months.
  As part of changes to the NDIS Act, all participants now receive an impairment
  notice from the NDIA, the agency that administers the NDIS. This determines
  their primary impairment, rather than their disability diagnosis. Impairment
  categories include, intellectual, cognitive, sensory, neurological, physical
  and psychosocial. The government intends to roll out a new way of delivering
  plan budgets from September. The new framework will give participants funding
  for supports based on impairment needs, offering ongoing payments within a
  specified period rather than an upfront lump sum. What else will the
  government change about the NDIS? The government has described the Thriving
  Kids program as the “first piece of work” to give shape to the foundational
  supports concept – but flagged there were others on the way. Butler said the
  next cohort the government would look at, based on the NDIS review’s findings,
  would include adults with more severe and complex mental illness. Other
  cohorts identified by the review include teens and young adults with
  disability who cannot access the NDIS and are preparing for key life
  transition points, such as school, employment and living independently.
