  Bayern Munich have agreed a deal to sign Nicolas Jackson on loan from Chelsea.
  Bayern are paying a €15m (£13m) loan fee for the striker with a €65m (£56m)
  option to buy, while there is a sell-on clause. Chelsea have also announced
  the sale of Christopher Nkunku for £36m to Milan. The 24-year-old Jackson is
  out of favour at Chelsea after the arrivals of Liam Delap and João Pedro. He
  joined from Villarreal in 2023 for £32m and scored 24 goals in 65 Premier
  League appearances. Jackson opened his Chelsea account against Luton before
  scoring a hat-trick in a 4-1 win at Tottenham in his first season with the
  club. He scored 14 goals in 35 league matches and formed a good relationship
  with Cole Palmer. Last September Jackson signed a two-year contract extension,
  with his deal running until 2033. He made key contributions during Chelsea’s
  Conference League success, scoring twice in the semi-final first leg win at
  Djurgården and once in the final against Real Betis. Discipline was a problem
  for the Senegal international, however: he was sent off for a deliberate elbow
  in a Premier League match against Newcastle in May and also in the Club World
  Cup group-stage defeat by Flamengo a month later for a reckless foul after
  coming on as a substitute. Jackson returned from suspension to replace Pedro
  in the semi-final win against Fluminense but was an unused substitute in
  Chelsea’s 3-0 final triumph over Paris Saint-Germain. Jackson was suspended
  for Chelsea’s opening game of the 2025-26 season against Crystal Palace and
  was left out of the squad for the 5-1 win at West Ham despite being fit and
  available for selection.
