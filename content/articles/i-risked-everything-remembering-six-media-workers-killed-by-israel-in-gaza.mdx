  Journalists have been prominent among casualties since the war in Gaza was
  triggered by Hamas’s incursion into Israel in October 2023. Some were working
  for well-known international media, others were employed by local news
  organisations. Several were high-profile veterans, but many were newcomers to
  the profession. The Committee to Protect Journalists, an independent
  non-profit organisation based in the US that promotes press freedom worldwide,
  says at least 186 journalists and media workers have been killed in Gaza, the
  West Bank, Israel and Lebanon since the war began, making it the deadliest
  period for journalists since it began gathering data in 1992. Most have been
  Palestinians in Gaza, where more than 60,000 people, mostly civilians, have
  been killed in Israel’s continuing offensive. Others put the toll higher. The
  CPJ accuses Israel of directly targeting and killing 20 journalists and media
  workers. Any deliberate attack on a civilian could constitute a war crime,
  experts say. Israel, which has refused to let international media into Gaza,
  denies the accusation. Journalists and media workers killed in Gaza Anas
  al-Sharif Anas al-Sharif was killed in a tent for journalists outside al-Shifa
  hospital in Gaza City on Sunday night. Seven people were killed in the attack,
  including another Al Jazeera correspondent, Mohammed Qreiqeh and the camera
  operators Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal and Moamen Aliwa, according to the
  Qatar-based broadcaster. Sharif, 28, is one of the most high-profile media
  casualties of the war in Gaza so far, reaching huge audiences with his reports
  for Al Jazeera and with more than 500,000 followers on X. His father was
  killed by an Israeli strike on the family home in Jabaliya refugee camp in
  Gaza City in December 2023. Sharif said at the time that he would continue to
  report and refused to leave northern Gaza. In a July broadcast he cried on air
  as a woman behind him collapsed from hunger. “I am talking about slow death of
  those people,” he said. His final post on X read: “Relentless bombardment …
  For two hours, the Israeli aggression has intensified on Gaza City.” He leaves
  a wife and two young children. The Israeli military, citing “intelligence and
  documents from Gaza, including rosters, terrorist training lists and salary
  records”, said Sharif was “a Hamas operative integrated into Al Jazeera”.
  Ismail Abu Hatab Ismail Abu Hatab, 32, was killed in an Israeli airstrike on
  al-Baqa cafe on the seashore in Gaza City in June, along with 33 other people.
  The photographer and film-maker, a graduate of Gaza’s University College of
  Applied Sciences, had sustained serious injuries to his leg in a November 2024
  attack on his office in the al-Ghifari tower in Gaza City but had made a slow,
  painful recovery. He had worked for numerous international media
  organisations, exhibited in the US and Spain, and launched a platform to bring
  art by Palestinians in Gaza to an international audience. He had also curated
  an exhibition in Los Angeles which portrayed life in Gaza during the war. “I
  have seen so much death. The mass graves and the final farewells, these things
  affect me deeply,” he told an Indian reporter in October 2024. “How can one
  group of people decide the fate of another and kill them in this way?” . The
  Israeli military said the strike on the cafe had targeted a meeting of Hamas
  commanders. Fatma Hassouna Fatma Hassouna, 25, a photographer and film-maker,
  was killed in an Israeli airstrike that hit her home in northern Gaza in
  April, just months before her wedding. Six members of her family, including
  her pregnant sister, were also killed. Hassouna, who graduated shortly before
  the war with a degree in multimedia, had spent 18 months documenting
  airstrikes, the endless displacement and the killing of 11 family members. Her
  work was published by the Guardian and other international outlets, and
  received much attention on social media. “If I die, I want a loud death,” she
  had written. “I don’t want to be just breaking news, or a number in a group, I
  want a death that the world will hear, an impact that will remain through
  time, and a timeless image that cannot be buried by time or place.” A film
  made with Hassouna was accepted for screening by the Cannes film festival the
  day before she was killed. The Israeli military said its attack had targeted a
  Hamas member involved in attacks on its soldiers and civilians. Hassan Aslih
  Hassan Aslih, 37, was being treated for injuries from a previous Israeli
  strike when he was killed in a drone attack on the emergency department of
  Nasser hospital in Khan Younis in southern Gaza in May. Israel has accused the
  photographer, who had a vast following on social media, of taking part in the
  7 October 2023 attack. Aslih documented the attack and followed fighters into
  Israel, taking photographs that were published worldwide. He denied Israel’s
  allegations. Hossam Shabat Hossam Shabat, 23, was killed in March, shortly
  after Israel definitively ended a two-month ceasefire with a wave of
  airstrikes. A correspondent for the Al Jazeera Mubasher channel, he died in an
  airstrike on his car in the ruined northern town of Beit Lahiya as he was
  conducting interviews. He was also a contributor to the US-based Drop Site
  News. Friends described an enthusiastic and brave reporter, who “touched
  people’s pain with his camera and his voice”. The Israeli military said it had
  “eliminated [a] terrorist” who had been a Hamas sniper, and cited documents
  soldiers had found in Gaza as evidence for the accusation. Hours after he was
  killed, Shabat’s team posted a message on X that he had written to be
  published in the event of his death. “I documented the horrors in northern
  Gaza minute by minute … Each day was a battle for survival,” he wrote. “I
  fulfilled my duty as a journalist. I risked everything to report the truth,
  and now, I am finally at rest – something I haven’t known in the past 18
  months.” Hamza al-Dahdouh Hamza al-Dahdouh, 27, a journalist for Al Jazeera,
  was killed along with a freelance cameraman working for Agence France-Presse
  in an Israeli drone strike on their car in southern Gaza in January 2024. The
  eldest son of the well-known Al Jazeera bureau chief in Gaza, Wael al-Dahdouh,
  his mother, brother, sister and nephew had been killed in an Israeli airstrike
  just weeks before. His father described his son as “kind, generous,
  ambitious”. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who was in Doha at the
  time, called the death an “unimaginable loss”. The Israeli military claimed
  Dahdouh had been targeted “as a terrorist operating an aircraft that posed a
  threat to IDF troops”, a reference to a small drone the reporter used to
  gather footage.
