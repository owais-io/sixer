  A senior official appointed to the defense department led a thinktank that
  promoted fake news about the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang, according
  to InSight Crime, a non-profit analyzing organized crime. Joseph Humire was
  appointed this summer to be the head of policy focusing on the western
  hemisphere within the office of the under secretary of defense for policy. He
  was previously the executive director of a conservative thinktank focused on
  global security. Humire’s appointment comes as the Trump administration is
  ramping up its aggressive strategy against organized crime in Latin America
  and the Venezuelan government, which it accuses of working with TdA. Under
  Humire’s leadership, the Center for a Secure Free Society thinktank published
  the “TdA Activity Monitor”, tracking alleged crimes by accused members of the
  gang throughout the US. According to InSight Crime, at least five event
  entries in the tracker appeared to have been “completely fabricated”. InSight
  Crime found zero basis for the false entries, with local police departments
  telling researchers the purported crimes were nonexistent. InSight Crime
  analyzed more than 90 of the entries, finding many relied on unverified
  sources. “Some incidents are included multiple times, inflating the gang’s
  perceived presence and activities,” researchers found. The monitor is no
  longer available online following InSight Crime’s reporting. [*See footnote].
  “The TdA Monitor is an aggregator, not a primary source of information about
  Tren de Aragua’s activities,” a statement from the Center for a Secure Free
  Society said, adding that it “reflects the media reporting”. The Department of
  Defense declined to comment. Humire has spoken publicly about alleged Tren de
  Aragua crimes on Fox News and other conservative outlets. He has also promoted
  the idea that the Venezuelan government is directing the gang’s crimes around
  the world, despite doubts from the intelligence community. Humire authored a
  report in December 2024 for the conservative Heritage Foundation, writing that
  Tren de Aragua “is a perfect proxy and tool of asymmetric warfare” by the
  Venezuelan government to “destabilize democratic countries”. In March, Humire
  made similar claims before Congress. But US intelligence agencies have cast
  doubt on the theory that the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, directs the
  gang, according to an intelligence memo whose release angered top officials,
  who then reportedly ordered a rewrite. TdA has been a major focus of the Trump
  administration, which designated the group as a terrorist organization earlier
  this year. Members of the gang have been implicated in violent crimes across
  the hemisphere but organized crime experts say descriptions of the group have
  exaggerated its scale, reach and structure. Despite skepticism from US
  intelligence agencies, Trump officials have repeatedly said the Venezuelan
  government, under Maduro, is working with Tren de Aragua to “infiltrate” the
  US. The accusation was used to justify the Alien Enemies Act invocation in
  March, leading to the expulsion of hundreds of Venezuelans accused of being
  gang members to a Salvadorian prison. Humire’s appointment to the defense
  department comes as the administration turns up the pressure on Venezuela.
  Last week, Trump directed the Pentagon to use military force on some drug
  cartels – a significant escalation in the “war on drugs” – and the justice
  department doubled a bounty on Maduro to $50m. The justice department has
  accused top Venezuelan officials of running the “Cartel of the Suns” to
  traffic drugs to the US. The state department recently declared the Cartel of
  the Suns to be a terrorist organization, but experts also say this claim may
  be overstated. Rather than a hierarchical organization trafficking drugs under
  Maduro’s orders, InSight Crime explains it is more a “network of networks”
  within the military. The Trump administration has increased the US’s
  involvement in Latin America through threats of tariffs and military
  intervention, alleged backroom deals and prisoner swaps. Rightwing leaders
  have cozied up to Trump, including El Salvador’s authoritarian Nayib Bukele.
  An analysis by the Guardian and the Quincy Institute shows Latin American
  leaders have spent millions of dollars hiring lobbyists to influence the White
  House. • This footnote was added on 26 August 2025: After publication the
  Center for a Secure Free Society contacted the Guardian to say that it
  restored access to its monitor, and that the incorrect entries discovered by
  InSight Crime had been removed.
