  The director of Russia’s notorious Taganrog prison, where officials are
  accused of overseeing the systematic torture and starvation of hundreds of
  Ukrainian detainees, has been notified by authorities in Kyiv that he is
  suspected of having committed a war crime. Ukraine’s national police service
  and its chief war crimes prosecutor announced on Thursday that Aleksandr
  Shtoda, head of the Sizo 2 pre-trial detention centre in Taganrog, had been
  formally placed under investigation. Shtoda was identified by the Viktoriia
  Project, an investigation by the Guardian and other reporting partners into
  the death in Russian captivity of the journalist Viktoriia Roshchyna, who was
  seized while working undercover in the occupied territories and transferred to
  Taganrog, where she spent nearly nine months. She was last seen alive on 8
  September 2024, and her body was repatriated earlier this year. Ukrainian
  investigators are still working to identify exactly where and how she died,
  although her remains showed numerous signs of torture. The announcement comes
  before Roshchyna’s funeral in Kyiv on Friday, and follows a decision by the
  Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to posthumously award her the Order
  of Freedom. Shtoda took over as head the prison, which lies near the border
  with occupied Ukraine, in October 2022, having previously worked there in
  management roles. After Russia’s full-scale invasion, Sizo 2 was transformed
  from a facility holding juvenile inmates and mothers with babies to a torture
  centre for prisoners of war. In a statement, Ukraine’s national police service
  alleged: “During the period of the suspect’s leadership in Sizo No 2 in
  Taganrog, Rostov region, a system of repressive treatment of illegally
  detained Ukrainian citizens, including civilians, was organised.” They said
  their investigation, with operational support from other agencies including
  the intelligence services at the defence ministry, had found Roshchyna was
  “subjected to systematic torture, humiliation, threats, severe restrictions on
  access to medical care, drinking water and food, and was deprived of the
  opportunity to sleep or sit during the day”. They also found she “was
  subjected to physical punishment and psychological pressure” to cooperate by
  her captors at Taganrog. Police claimed Shtoda “personally gave orders to his
  subordinates to apply physical and moral pressure” to Roshchyna. “Being aware
  of her civilian status and the protection guaranteed by international
  humanitarian law, he deliberately violated the norms of the Geneva convention
  and other international treaties.” They concluded: “The actions of the
  defendant were qualified as a war crime in accordance with international
  standards.” The police statement was accompanied by photographs of Shtoda,
  although by convention did not refer to him by name. He was named in a video
  statement released on the same day by the prosecutor in charge of Roshchyna’s
  case, Yurii Bielousov, who said: “By his actions, Aleksandr Shtoda committed a
  war crime in the form of ill-treatment of a civilian, for which he is liable
  under part 1 of article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine, which provides
  for punishment in the form of imprisonment for up to 12 years. The
  investigation into this crime is ongoing and will identify all those involved
  in its commission.” A notice of suspicion is a formal document issued by law
  enforcement or a prosecutor to inform a person that they are officially
  suspected of committing a crime, and marks the beginning of the pre-trial
  investigation phase. Prosecutors may subsequently charge the individual, and a
  judge will then decide whether to proceed to trial. Those not physically in
  Ukraine can be prosecuted in absentia. Reporters Without Borders, which
  campaigns to protect journalists, welcomed the announcement as a “first step
  towards justice”. They added: “It is time for all those responsible for her
  death to be identified and held accountable. Their silence is unbearable.”
  Shtoda has been approached for comment.
