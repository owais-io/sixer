  Doctors have found a bullet fragment lodged perilously close to the carotid
  artery in the neck of a 10-year-old boy who narrowly survived the mass
  shooting in Minneapolis last week after a friend shielded him from the
  gunfire. Fifth-grader Weston Halsne recounted running under a pew and covering
  his head while shots fired by the alleged shooter, Robin Westman, came through
  the stained-glass windows during the shooting at Annunciation Catholic school
  last Wednesday. He described how his friend Victor Greenawalt had jumped on
  top of him to shield him. After the shooting, the boy told reporters: “I think
  I got, like, gunpowder on my neck.” His father, Grant Halsne, has now told NBC
  News that it was in fact not gunpowder, but a piece of bullet, adding that a
  doctor described the boy’s survival as a “miracle”. “If it [the bullet
  fragment] went any further, he would’ve died,” Halsne told the outlet. His son
  is expected to have the fragment removed later this week and is expected to
  make a full recovery. An aunt, Allison Hawes, confirmed that her nephew “will
  need surgery to remove a bullet fragment that is lodged in his neck,
  dangerously close to his carotid artery”. Hawes wrote on a fundraising page:
  “You’ve been amazed by his quick wit, awed by his persistence, and charmed by
  his earnestness. “If you’ve been watching the news, you’ve seen his
  grief-stricken face and heard, despite his shock, Weston’s account of the
  horrific details during the mass at Annunciation Church. And in spite of
  everything, this 10-year-old boy was able to express appreciation for his
  friends and pray for their recovery.” Weston last week described how he first
  heard the gunfire. “I was like two seats away from the stained glass windows,”
  Weston said. “So, they were like, the shots were like right next to me.” The
  suspect, who was found dead at the rear of the church with an apparent
  self-inflicted gunshot wound, fired around 120 shots from three different
  guns, according to Minneapolis police. Police on Sunday revised the number of
  people injured in the shooting from 18 to 21 on Sunday. Fletcher Merkel,
  eight, and Harper Moyski, 10, were killed. Most of the injured were children.
  Greenawalt’s uncle, Mike Kelly, said his nephew’s “selfless acts” helped spare
  the lives of his friends. “But he and his sister were injured in the process,”
  Kelly wrote on a fundraising site. Others injured include Genevieve Bisek, 11,
  who was shot in the neck. She is listed as “satisfactory”. Her family, who
  have also launched a fundraising page, said her “medical journey is
  uncertain”. Sophia Forchas, 12, was listed as in critical condition; Lydia
  Kaiser in “very serious condition”; David Haeg, six, is being treated in a
  hospital pediatric intensive care unit; and Astoria Safe, 10, was grazed on
  the forehead. She told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that she had helped pull
  two kids next to her down when the bullets started flying. “I had two buddies
  side by side, and I just pushed their heads down to make sure they were safe,”
  she said. “I thought it was fireworks, it was just crazy. And the smell was
  terrible.” Officials have said they are trying “to determine some type of
  motive” for this shooting. Minneapolis police chief Brian O’Hara told ABC News
  the suspect “clearly had a deranged obsession with previous mass shooters”.
  “Ultimately this person committed this act with the intention of causing as
  much terror, as much trauma, as much carnage as possible for their own
  personal notoriety,” O’Hara said. The survivor accounts come as a political
  debate rages over the motives for shooting, with figures on the right pointing
  to the shooter’s transgender identity, and the left to identify gun control.
  On Sunday, Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar accused White House official
  Sebastian Gorka on Sunday of wanting “to deflect from the reality” after Gorka
  said Westman had a clear “ideological” motive for targeting the Catholic
  school. “That’s what terrorism is,” Gorka said, prompting Omar to respond:
  “These people are all over the place because they want to deflect from the
  reality … which is that, there was, someone who came into that school, through
  the window, and assassinated two beautiful angels, as they prayed.” Omar
  called for call for a ban on assault weapons and increased mental health
  services. “This is not the moment to point fingers,” she said.
