  My friend Len Doyal, who has died aged 80, was for many years a senior
  lecturer in medical ethics at St Bartholomew’s and the Royal London Hospital
  Medical School, where his academic programme, Ethics and Law Applied to
  Medicine and Dentistry, was much praised for the way it integrated law and
  ethics with clinical practice. He was appointed professor of medical ethics
  and law there in 1996 and became the first non-medical honorary consultant in
  a British hospital. Much in demand as a bridge between ethics and hands-on
  medicine, he became a longstanding member of the BMA ethics committee, before
  retiring in 2000. Len was born in the US, in Atlanta, Georgia, to Thomas, who
  was director of transportation for the state of Georgia, and Muriel (nee
  Pendley), a homemaker. After completing a degree in philosophy at Georgia
  State University he won a Fulbright scholarship to further study the subject
  under Karl Popper at the London School of Economics. It was a momentous
  journey from the Jim Crow South to the court of a legendary figure in the
  philosophy of science, but sadly he found many of Popper’s ideas almost as
  problematic as those that he had left behind. Not wishing to return to the US,
  in 1968 Len found refuge in teaching philosophy at Middlesex Polytechnic (now
  University) and there met Lesley Coates, a fellow academic whom he married in
  1973. Over the years, as Lesley rose to be a professor of health studies, they
  also cooperated academically, writing joint articles and books, including
  Living With HIV and Dying With Aids (2013). Their house in Finsbury Park,
  north London, was a convivial meeting point for feminist and leftwing groups
  and it was there that I first met Len at the founding of the journal Critical
  Social Policy. Our book, A Theory of Human Need (1991), was awarded both the
  Isaac Deutscher and Gunnar Myrdal prizes. Working through those ideas together
  in the 1980s was a joy and a useful antidote to the prevailing Thatcherite
  tide. Among his other books were Clinical Ethics: Theory and Practice (2011)
  and Informed Consent in Medical Research (2000), the latter of which he
  co-edited. After 22 years at Middlesex Polytechnic, Len moved to teach medical
  ethics at Barts and the Royal London Hospital Medical School, where he was
  consistently popular with students, who elected him staff president of the
  student union for five consecutive years. He was always willing to engage
  positively and sensitively with those who disagreed with him, yet his
  determination to explore the most basic of ethical dilemmas did sometimes
  cause upset. The most notable of his controversial positions was his argument
  that non-voluntary euthanasia should be legal under certain limited
  circumstances. In his spare time Len played the guitar and loved the American
  canon of popular music from the 60s onwards. He is survived by Lesley, their
  children, Daniel and Hannah, and four grandchildren.
