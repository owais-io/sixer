  Here for its hundred-year anniversary is a restored version of Sergei
  Eisenstein’s pioneering silent classic from 1925, itself commissioned for the
  20-year anniversary of the events it showed and reimagined. It is in
  black-and-white of course, apart from the vivid red flag flown from the
  battleship’s mast. This rerelease is accompanied by a soundtrack composed by
  Pet Shop Boys in 2005; it is a fervent, continuous score but not, for me, one
  that engages fully with the drama’s light-and-shade. It also perhaps reopens
  the debate about when and how a silent-movie musical accompaniment should be
  content to fall silent in favour of discreet ambient background sound. The
  subject is a 1905 anti-Tsarist mutiny on an Imperial Russian Navy battleship
  in the Black Sea near Ukraine. It is an uprising of sailors demoralised by
  losses in the Russo-Japanese war, resentful of the officers’ arrogance and
  incompetence, electrified by news of revolutionary enthusiasms on land, and
  finally triggered by the maggot-infested meat they were expected to eat. In
  real life, the mutineers fired on the Odesa theatre where military top brass
  were discussing how to suppress the rebellion and the mutineers later found
  that another craft sent to attack them itself underwent a mutiny in fraternal
  support. Eisenstein shows this, but also boldly invents an entire fictional
  sequence in which the Potemkin docks at Odesa (it didn’t) to display on the
  quayside the martyred body of their leader Vakulinchuk, played by Aleksandr
  Antonov (who, as he lies in state, rather resembles Joseph Stalin, who had
  assumed power a year before the film’s release). The passionately supportive
  citizenry is shown swarming down the Odesa steps to greet them, cheering
  wildly – only to be fired on and massacred: from above by Cossacks and by
  cavalry from below. Through this, Eisenstein audaciously created from nothing
  a foundation myth of injustice and resistance. And for the century that came
  afterwards, Potemkin was an inspirational template for epic movies, action
  movies, war movies, period movies and thrillers. With wonderful confidence and
  flair, Eisenstein moves between wide shot and closeup, the panoramic scene and
  the telling detail; the vivid, sweaty faces are startling. It all comes
  together in the masterly Odesa steps scene, with that tense, Hitchcockian
  moment as the baby carriage begins to roll heartstoppingly down the steps.
  Hitchcock, though, would perhaps not have dared withhold from us, as
  Eisenstein does, the facts about what exactly happens to the baby. Was it all
  right? Or is that a bourgeois individualist question to ask? And then there
  are the piercingly important individual images. Eisenstein repeatedly
  emphasises the spectacles of the ship’s doctor inspecting the rotten meat and
  airily pronouncing it more or less sound; these are not maggots, he says, but
  mere larvae, which can be washed off. His spectacles ironically symbolise his
  inability to see the truth, and there is a sickening echo when we see the
  blood-spattered spectacles of the woman shot in the face on the steps: she has
  certainly seen the truth. Perhaps as much as anything, Battleship Potemkin
  shows how Eisenstein saw warfare and military humiliation as vital
  revolutionary conditions. “Russian prisoners in Japan are better fed than we
  are!” shouts one maggot-maddened sailor. The original audience for Potemkin
  would have remembered how Russia’s suffering on the eastern front in 1917 was
  to contribute to the October revolutions. The army, or in this case the navy,
  instils in its rank and file learned habits of disciplined aggression and
  obedience that, in the right conditions and at the right moment, can be
  appropriated and rerouted into revolutionary fervour. The Potemkin brought the
  unquarantined spore of outrage into Odesa, revolution making a kind of
  landfall. • Battleship Potemkin is in UK and Irish cinemas from 22 August and
  on Blu-ray and CD on 5 September.
