  It was, in the end, an off-the-cuff remark from Donald Trump that moved the
  dial. “I’m not going to take a position,” the US president said when asked in
  Scotland about pressure on Keir Starmer to recognise a Palestinian state. “I
  don’t mind him taking a position. I’m looking for getting people [in Gaza] fed
  right now.” Within 36 hours, after an emergency meeting of his cabinet, the
  prime minister had set out a plan to revive fading hopes of a two-state
  solution – and recognise Palestine by the end of September. It is a historic
  shift in the position of the UK government and its efforts to bring peace to a
  region it ruled through an international mandate from 1922 to 1948. David
  Lammy, the foreign secretary, told a UN conference on Monday that “Britain
  bears a special burden of responsibility”. Under the new policy – which the
  Guardian understands was largely drafted by Jonathan Powell, the national
  security adviser – the UK will recognise Palestine unless Israel meets certain
  conditions including agreeing a ceasefire in Gaza and reviving the prospect of
  a two-state solution. In private, senior government figures agree that this
  commitment can lead only to recognition. “The reality is unless the Netanyahu
  government falls in the next six to eight weeks or makes an 180 degree U-turn,
  the only outcome of this is the UK recognising the state of Palestine,” one
  government source said. If Israel does meet the conditions, it will have
  embarked on a path towards Palestinian statehood itself. Ministers stress that
  recognition was a Labour manifesto promise and therefore always something they
  were committed to doing before the next election. But over the past fortnight,
  Starmer came under heavy pressure on the domestic and international stage to
  move faster amid a global outcry over the horrific scenes of starvation in
  Gaza caused by Israel’s blockade on aid. Emmanuel Macron, the French
  president, had for months been lobbying the UK and other countries to join a
  push for Palestinian recognition at a high-level UN conference in New York,
  which had been due to take place in June but was postponed by the outbreak of
  war between Israel and Iran. Three weeks ago, the UN conference was
  rescheduled for 28 and 29 July as its joint hosts, France and Saudi Arabia,
  sought to keep momentum building. Four days before foreign ministers were due
  to gather in New York, Macron announced that France intended to recognise a
  Palestinian state at the UN general assembly in September. Meanwhile in the
  UK, ministers’ horror at the deteriorating situation in Gaza was mounting.
  There was a growing realisation inside government that the prospect of a
  two-state solution was fast diminishing and at risk of being buried for good
  by Netanyahu. In an unusual intervention on 22 July, Wes Streeting, the health
  secretary, told the Commons that he supported recognising “the state of
  Palestine while there is a state of Palestine left to recognise”. The Guardian
  revealed the extent of cabinet pressure that week – Streeting, Shabana
  Mahmood, the justice secretary, and Hilary Benn, the Northern Ireland
  secretary, had all pushed for Palestinian statehood during cabinet meetings.
  Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, and Yvette Cooper, the home
  secretary, believed the UK should act alongside France. An open letter on 25
  July backing recognition was signed by more than 200 MPs, including more than
  a third of Labour ones. That Friday evening, Starmer, who had just concluded a
  call with Macron and the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, bid for time.
  Downing Street was preparing for a high-stakes summit with Trump, who was en
  route to Scotland on Air Force One for a private visit to his golf resorts.
  “There was a concern within No 10 that we needed to make sure that any
  decision with regards to recognition would not have a negative impact on that
  US relationship,” a government source said. At about the same time, it was
  decided that Lammy would attend the French-Saudi UN summit, rather than send a
  more junior representative. With Lammy en route to New York, Starmer and his
  wife, Victoria, arrived in Turnberry on Monday morning and were greeted by
  Trump on the steps of his resort. In an impromptu back and forth with
  reporters outside, Trump reacted to the suggestion that the UK could recognise
  Palestine with a rhetorical shrug. “That was a green light,” the same source
  said. Trump also, for the first time, acknowledged that there was “real
  starvation” in Gaza and dismissed denials from Netanyahu, urging him to let
  “every ounce of food” in. After the meeting, No 10 sources emphasised the
  significance of the president’s language. Having returned to London from
  Scotland, Starmer spoke to Netanyahu before the cabinet meeting on Tuesday to
  inform him of his intention to recognise Palestine unless Israel met his
  conditions. Then Starmer and Lammy – dialling in from New York – presented
  ministers with the policy over the course of a 90-minute cabinet meeting
  before announcing it publicly. The decision to make statehood conditional on
  Israel’s actions quickly came under fire from all sides. The Green party and
  Jeremy Corbyn attacked ministers for turning Palestinians’ right to
  recognition into a “bargaining chip”. Emily Damari, a British citizen who was
  held hostage by Hamas for more than 15 months, accused Starmer of “moral
  failure” and “rewarding terror”. A group of 40 peers warned that ministers
  risked breaking international law because Palestine has no defined borders or
  single functioning government. Even government figures concede that the policy
  – which ministers have struggled to communicate on the airwaves – is
  convoluted, but they argue that the semantics won’t matter once the UK
  recognises a Palestinian state alongside several of its allies next month.
  Crucially, Trump’s indifferent stance appears to be holding. Asked by
  reporters on his way home from Scotland about Starmer’s move, the president
  was more critical: “We never did discuss it,” he said. “You’re rewarding Hamas
  if you do that. I don’t think they should be rewarded”. He left his criticism
  there. Trump reserved harsher words for Canada’s move towards recognition –
  saying it “will make it very hard for us to make a trade deal” – but later
  conceded that it was “not a dealbreaker”. “I didn’t like what they said, but
  you know that’s their opinion,” he told reporters on Thursday. The US looks
  increasingly isolated as more of its allies prepare to join the push in
  September. Australia, New Zealand, Finland and Portugal all signed a letter in
  support of recognition at the UN summit. A parallel joint statement from Arab
  countries including Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Egypt condemning Hamas and calling
  on it to lay down arms is seen as highly significant. But there is little hope
  for a ceasefire while Hamas torpedoes talks and the humanitarian situation in
  Gaza remains dire as Israel maintains its blockade. UK officials say that
  while David Cameron was foreign secretary, the aim was for 200 trucks of aid
  to enter Gaza through Jordan every day. They are now expecting just 150 trucks
  to enter this entire week. Over the coming days, ministers’ focus will be on
  efforts to get more aid into the territory and transport severely injured
  children to the UK for treatment. Meanwhile, all eyes were on Trump’s envoy
  Steve Witkoff as he visited US-funded aid delivery points in Gaza on Friday.
  “If the government got the American president into a place where he’s at least
  not against [recognition], that’s quite a shift,” said Emily Thornberry, the
  chair of the foreign affairs committee. “If we’re going to get the
  international community to agree to a plan, there’s no way we’re going to get
  anywhere without Trump’s buy-in.”
