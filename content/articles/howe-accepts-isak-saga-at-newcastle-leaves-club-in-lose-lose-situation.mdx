  Eddie Howe has acknowledged that Alexander Isak’s standoff with Newcastle has
  left the club in a “lose-lose situation” and described it as a “sad moment”.
  Isak will again not be involved at St James’ Park on Monday night when
  Newcastle face Liverpool, the side the Sweden striker has been agitating to
  join all summer. Howe said he has not spoken to Isak this week, meaning the
  pair have had no contact since the events of Tuesday night, when a player
  currently training alone posted an Instagram message in which he spoke of
  “broken promises”, a “loss of trust” and a relationship that “could not
  continue”. “I don’t think we can come out of this winning in any situation,”
  said Howe, well aware that, come 2 September, Isak will either remain in the
  north-east against his wishes or will have departed amid considerable
  acrimony. “I think it’s a lose-lose situation, to a degree, for us.” Newcastle
  responded to Isak’s Instagram post with a statement of their own, emphasising
  an intention to keep someone with three years remaining on his contract, but
  possibly leaving the door to a potential deal with Liverpool slightly ajar.
  Nonetheless, for Isak to end up at Anfield in this transfer window, Howe would
  need to sign two new strikers and Newcastle to be paid a fee somewhere between
  their £150m asking fee and the £110m bid Liverpool have already seen rejected.
  “It’s a sad moment,” reflected Howe as he anxiously awaited developments in
  Newcastle’s pursuit of Brentford’s Yoane Wissa, Wolves’s Jørgen Strand Larsen
  and Atlético Madrid’s Alexander Sørloth. “These things being made public
  doesn’t reflect well on us, or Alex. It’s been an unfortunate few months that
  looks like it will come to an end pretty quickly.” Not that Newcastle’s
  manager seems remotely clear on how, precisely, the saga will be resolved.
  “I’m not a fortune teller,” he added. “I’ve got no way of knowing what will
  happen in the next few days. But he’s contracted to us, he’s our player.” Howe
  weighed his words carefully as he struck a decidedly conciliatory tone. “If
  Alex decided to come back and play for us, the players would welcome him
  back,” he said. “Alex is an outstanding player and a very, very good person, a
  good character, a good lad. He wants to succeed in his career. “Things can
  change. A player might not be in a great place one days and a few days later
  they are there and ready to play. That’s the beauty of human beings, we can
  all change our feelings and emotions quite quickly.” Not that Howe will
  welcome Isak back on any terms. “I 100% want him in a Newcastle shirt. But if
  Alex is to play for Newcastle again, he has to be totally committed.” With
  both Newcastle’s Saudi Arabian owners and Isak desperate to avoid losing face,
  the manager finds himself walking a diplomatic tightrope. “This has been an
  unfortunate situation but there are always two sides to every story,” he said,
  pointedly. “There’s more than even I will know, because there are
  conversations that have taken place far away from me and my knowledge of
  them.” Howe did concede he had held meetings with Isak in the spring but,
  perhaps tellingly, he would not be drawn as to whether he knew then that the
  25-year-old was anxious to move on. “Me and Alex had conversations towards the
  end of last season. I am not going to deny that,” Howe said. “But individual
  conversations are best off remaining private.” The 47-year-old also claimed he
  personally was not at loggerheads with Isak. “There are no issues between us,”
  Howe said. “I haven’t seen him this week, but when I do see him, we speak as
  normal. It’s difficult on both sides. It’s far from ideal. But we’re fine.”
  Isak’s seemingly shattered relationship with Newcastle’s supporters could
  prove harder to mend. “I believe it can be fixed,” countered Howe. “I believe
  supporters always react to how a player plays and what he gives to the team.”
