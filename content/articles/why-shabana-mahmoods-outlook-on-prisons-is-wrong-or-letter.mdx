  Shabana Mahmood’s tenure as justice secretary is more problematic than your
  profile suggests (Shabana Mahmood: justice secretary and rising star of the
  Labour party, 16 August). First, she has endorsed yet another prison-building
  programme, a policy that has failed so dismally for the past 200 years. If the
  answer to the current crisis is more prisons, then she, like her predecessors,
  is asking the wrong question. Second, she has said prisons should be regarded
  as being of “national importance”. Why should they be seen as more important
  than developing welfare-oriented, radical alternatives to custody, or
  abolishing the structural inequalities that are central to who is criminalised
  and imprisoned? Third, the profile mentions that her plans include chemical
  castration for sex offenders. There are significant human rights issues
  concerning this policy. It is also a short-term expedient and does not address
  the widespread, systemic nature of violence against women and girls, including
  sexual violence. And she has approved using pepper spray to incapacitate
  children in young offender institutions. Finally, she has “taken inspiration”
  from claims that Texas has reduced its prison population. The reasons for this
  are more complicated than the profile recognises. Furthermore, prisoners in
  solitary confinement are held in cages smaller than telephone booths and have
  no toilet or sink. There were over 14,000 deaths in state custody in Texas
  between 2005 and 2024, disproportionately involving Hispanic and Black people,
  with over 11,000 occurring in penal institutions. Deborah Coles Executive
