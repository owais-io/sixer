  heatwave decimates coral reefs

  The Western Australian Greens and the state’s peak conservation body have
  condemned the extension of a research partnership between the Western
  Australian Museum and Woodside, as the state reels from a record-breaking
  marine heatwave that has killed corals over a 1,500km stretch of ocean. The
  five-year continuation of the “longstanding collaboration”, in which the gas
  giant supports the museum’s biodiversity research along the WA coastline,
  would allow for further targeted research along the Gascoyne coast, according
  to announcements. In a post on its LinkedIn page, the museum wrote that “to
  mark the milestone” Woodside was supporting free general admission to the WA
  Maritime Museum on Sunday 17 August for the “Woodside Energy Open Day” and the
  event would feature “family-friendly activities all about marine science” as
  part of National Science Week. The new deal – which extends the 28-year
  partnership – and the open day have been promoted in front-page advertisements
  in WA media this week. Sign up: AU Breaking News email It has prompted fury
  from climate advocates and the WA Greens as it coincides with the release of
  research about the extent of the damage caused by a record-breaking,
  climate-change fuelled marine heatwave to the state’s coral reefs. The
  heatwave, which started to build off the north-west WA coast in August 2024,
  has been called “the most severe coral bleaching on record for Western
  Australian coral reefs”. It killed coral throughout an area that stretches
  1,500km, according to a group of scientists from state and federal government
  departments, agencies and universities who worked on this week’s report. The
  WA Greens fossil fuels and climate action spokesperson, Sophie McNeill, wrote
  to the museum on Tuesday seeking a briefing from its director, Alec Coles,
  “because it seems like they [the museum] don’t understand the relationship
  between fossil fuel companies and the devastating impacts of climate change we
  are seeing right now on our marine environment”. “It is so inappropriate that
  the WA Museum has chosen to continue its partnership with one of the world’s
  largest fossil fuel companies as our world heritage listed coral reefs are
  literally dying in front of our eyes,” McNeill said. “As one of the state’s
  biggest polluters, Woodside should not be allowed anywhere near marine science
  in Western Australia given they are responsible for the current devastation we
  are seeing along our coastline that is so universally loved by all.” McNeill
  expressed concern that children visiting museums to learn about oceans were
  being exposed to branding from “the very same fossil fuel giant that is
  contributing to the death of our coral reefs”. “It is deeply alarming that our
  precious institutions here in WA are so deeply captured, just like the WA
  Labor government, by fossil fuel companies like Woodside,” she said. In a
  statement, a spokesperson from WA Museum described it as “independent,
  science-led, and committed to the people and the environment of Western
  Australia”. The spokesperson added that WA Museum relies on “a diverse range
  of funding sources – including government, competitive research grants,
  philanthropic contributions, and corporate support”. They continued that
  “engaging constructively and transparently with industry” allowed WA Museum to
  expand knowledge of WA’s ecosystems, “foster dialogue between sectors” and
  “ensure that decisions about environmental impact are informed by the best
  available science”. The Conservation Council of WA said the museum, as a state
  government institution, should reject the extended sponsorship arrangement.
  “If there is funding required the government should show some leadership and
  actually put up the money and ensure that important research is still
  continuing,” the executive director, Matt Roberts, said. “So that we’re not
  relying on the very industry that is causing our marine systems to be on the
  brink of collapse to fund the research into that collapse.” Roberts said the
  council was organising a “requiem for our reefs” at the Maritime Museum on
  Sunday to highlight the “devastating impact of Woodside’s emissions on WA’s
  coral reef system, and calling for public support to stop Australia’s biggest
  polluter from drilling for new gas under the pristine Scott Reef in the Browse
  Basin”. Paul Gamblin, the chief executive of the Australian Marine
  Conservation Society, questioned Woodside’s motives, asking “What do they seek
  to gain from it?” “Particularly given the very clear evidence of the marine
  environment coming under increasing stress, one might imagine we’re going to
  see more of this kind of sponsorship and public relations.” The spokesperson
  for the WA Museum said “Woodside neither directs the research, nor
  participates in it [and] the Museum retains all intellectual property
  generated, other than that vested in Traditional Owners”. Woodside referred
  back to the company statement released last week, which said the ongoing
  collaboration had “led to the discovery and description of numerous new
  species, and significantly increased understanding of the marine environment
  of Western Australia”. The chief executive, Meg O’Neill, said last week “this
  renewed collaboration reaffirms Woodside’s commitment to responsible
  environmental management and the ongoing discovery of WA’s unique marine
  biodiversity”.
