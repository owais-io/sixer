  Whether you’re grabbing a satisfying street food snack, sampling traditional
  Hungarian fare or sipping a wine crafted just beyond the city reaches, one of
  the best ways to enjoy Budapest is through your tastebuds. The culinary scene
  reflects the essence of the Hungarian capital, with its combination of
  old-world grandeur and modern, pulsing energy. Among the art nouveau spires
  are opulent 19th-century coffee houses, that really have to be seen to be
  believed. Think high ceilings, intricate panelling, chandeliers and golden
  flourishes, where the literati once debated over coffee and sweet treats.
  Markets and traditional restaurants serve hearty Hungarian dishes, while a new
  generation of experimental chefs give their take on local ingredients in
  Michelin-starred restaurants. Budapest is just a two-and-a-half-hour flight
  with British Airways from London. It’s the perfect excuse to plan a city break
  and discover the gastronomic delights of one of Europe’s most magical cities.
  The taste of tradition Weaving together influences from east and west, from
  the Ottoman empire and Austria, Hungarian cuisine is a reflection of the
  country’s complex history. Rich, homespun dishes are the cornerstone of it
  all, often flavoured with Hungary’s favourite spice – paprika – and featuring
  rich meats, seasonal vegetables, cheeses and fresh breads. Any gourmet tour of
  Budapest should take in the signature dish, goulash. This warming stew
  consists of slow-cooked beef and vegetables, with the unmistakable smokiness
  of sweet paprika. And there are stews for all seasons, from summery lecsó
  (vegetable stew made with peppers, tomatoes, onions and paprika), to creamy
  chicken paprikash, with sour cream stirred into the gravy – a perfect winter
  warmer. Don’t miss halászlé, a fiery fisherman’s soup served up in eateries
  around the Danube and Tisza river regions. Sundays are reserved for
  breadcrumbed and fried chicken, pork or turkey with potatoes and cucumber
  salad. Sumptuous street food Eating on the go is all part of the adventure in
  Budapest. There are plenty of markets where you can refuel, from the vast,
  19th-century Great Market Hall, where stalls serve street food on the third
  floor, to contemporary, colourful Lehel Market. One of the best snacks to try
  is the humble deep-fried, cheese-topped flatbread known as lángos, slathered
  with sour cream and garlic. Don’t miss kürtőskalács, a sweet, cylindrical
  chimney cake, wrapped around a spit to give it that distinctive shape and
  baked over an open fire. These tasty, truncated treats are coated in
  caramelised sugar as they cook, resulting in a golden-brown crust. For meaty
  snacks, try Budapest’s beloved kolbász (sausage), best washed down with a
  local beer. You’ll also find hurka (liver sausage) and véres hurka (blood
  sausage) at street vendors around the city, usually served with mashed potato
  and sauerkraut. Budapest’s cafe culture Budapest has a strong cafe culture,
  with traditional coffee houses offering a glimpse into the city’s glamorous
  past. Often adorned with dazzling frescoes and chandeliers, they form quite
  the backdrop for Hungarian coffee and decadent desserts. Don’t leave without
  trying somlói galuska, a layered sponge cake or Hungarian trifle filled with
  chocolate sauce, walnuts, and whipped cream, or dobos torte, a multi-layered
  chocolate and buttercream sponge topped with caramel brittle. Prefer something
  a little lighter? Try rétes (strudel), a flaky pastry that comes in a variety
  of sweet fillings including steamed apple and sour cherry. Fine-dining
  delights While traditional Hungarian dishes hold a special place, Budapest’s
  culinary scene is far from being stuck in its ways. The city is experiencing a
  dynamic trend towards innovative fine dining, driven by a new generation of
  Hungarian chefs pushing boundaries with imaginative takes on classic Hungarian
  gastronomy. The city is home to seven Michelin-starred restaurants – from
  Babel with its central European influence and wine pairing focus to the modern
  European Costes – and a liberal sprinkling of intimate dining venues that
  combine rich Hungarian flavours with the best of international cuisine. Expect
  sophisticated flavour combinations, artistic presentations, and contemporary
  twists on classic ingredients, showcasing the city’s evolving style and
  increasingly refined palate. Wonderful wines The perfect pairing for Hungarian
  cuisine is one of the country’s award-winning wines, and Budapest is well
  stocked with vintages from vineyards just beyond the city limits. Hungary’s
  rich winemaking tradition stretches back to Roman times, while the diverse
  range of indigenous grape varietals and fertile landscape make for some
  exceptional vintages. Try the country’s most famous wine, the sweet and
  complex white Tokaji, or combine a rich meat dish with one of the country’s
  full-bodied reds such as those from the Eger and Villány regions. For
  something a little different, Unicum is a traditional Hungarian liqueur made
  from more than 40 herbs and spices, blended and aged in oak casks for at least
  six months. From hearty traditional dishes and delicious street food to
  elegant fine dining and opulent cafes, Budapest offers a feast for the senses.
  And it’s easy to reach with British Airways. Find out more and book your
  Budapest trip at ba.com. When you fly with British Airways, you’ll enjoy a
  generous hand-baggage allowance and best of British service. You’ll also be
  able to book an ATOL-protected holiday package with British Airways Holidays,
  with the option of low deposits and flexible payments
