  What is “Brand Beckham”? I don’t mean to question the very idea of a celebrity
  brand – far from it. In fact, part of the reason that celeb-watching phrases
  like “the brand” and “controlling the narrative” have gone completely
  mainstream is because of David and Victoria Beckham. So ubiquitous is the
  professionalisation of celebrity these days, and so media-literate is the
  public, that it’s hard to remember just how revolutionary the Beckhams were in
  British culture back in the day. Twenty-five years ago, nobody except some
  rarefied elite publicist wanged on about narratives. But now everyone knows
  how to read an influencer. Almost all celebrities are regarded primarily as
  people who are selling something. Furthermore, people act like mis-selling a
  lifestyle is worse than several major financial crimes. Anyway, back to the
  brand. What is the Beckham brand? Not their many specific product brands, nor
  the many other ones to which they lend their images for advertising. The thing
  I’m talking about is more like a movie star’s screen persona. The unifying
  characteristic, the theme that permeates all their roles, the magic that fans
  go back for. In the case of the Beckhams, the brand is really their family.
  Two became six. In the more distant past, this meant Victoria and David
  selling news of their pregnancies to OK! magazine, then selling the first baby
  photos and so on. In the age of Instagram, as their children have grown up, it
  has meant constantly tending this idyllic image by posting private family
  moments, having everyone show up en masse for the launch of each other’s
  football seasons/fashion shows/face primers/food lines/50th birthday
  marathons, and dutifully sending daily public messages of love, support and
  thanks to each other across social media platforms where others can see them.
  Whether it’s family or business – and sometimes it isn’t entirely clear where
  the dividing line is – it’s all very much the family business. As distilled in
  David’s Netflix documentary – self-commissioned, naturally – the message is
  that no matter what triumph or disaster comes their way, the Beckham family
  are about each other. Any adversity is folded into their story and ends up
  being repurposed into (lucrative) triumph because this is a family that sticks
  together, and which draws its strength from that. It’s aspirational and
  sometimes charming. It has worked. So what happens when a gaping hole is blown
  in the idyll? In some of the most eye-popping showbiz news of the summer, it
  has emerged beyond all doubt that one of the family – firstborn Brooklyn –
  wants nothing to do with the others. If the idea of a feud was plausibly
  deniable back when Brooklyn and his wife, Nicola Peltz, got married three
  years ago, it was harder to maintain when the pair didn’t show up for any of
  David’s 50th birthday celebrations this May. It is now impossible, following
  Brooklyn and Nicola’s decision to post to Instagram huge numbers of photos of
  their very recent wedding vow renewal ceremony. (Vow renewals: another part of
  modern celeb culture that didn’t really happen before they happened in
  magazine buy-ups or on social media.) Details of the lavish big day? The
  ceremony was officiated by Nicola’s billionaire father, Nelson, and she wore
  her mother’s wedding dress. Oh, and not a single member of the Beckham family
  was there, and it’s said they only found out about it by reading it online.
  Questions abound, from various sides of the fence. To a list of occupations
  which already includes footballer, photographer, model, monograph author and
  chef, is Brooklyn adding hostage? How can the Beckhams bear the pain of
  rejection? Or do people really cut themselves off from highly functional
  families? One of Nicola’s friends who attended the ceremony posted in praise
  of having “the guts to walk away” from “a toxic family”. Victoria’s own
  self-commissioned Netflix documentary was due to come out this autumn
  (executive producer: David Beckham). How on earth is it going to spin this?
  Anything other than four hours of open-heart soul-searching is going to look a
  bit “Tractor production up in Volgograd!” The cautionary sadness is that these
  questions can’t really be considered invasive because they relate to a show
  the Beckhams have eagerly invited us to watch at every possible moment. The
  family has so assiduously cultivated the public engagement with their internal
  dynamics, choosing daily to live out loud across social media. For better –
  but now, for worse. It feels a little much to slap the adjective
  “Shakespearean” on a story which involves a guy who once included the worst
  picture ever taken of an elephant in a coffee-table book of his own
  photography (launch party held at Christie’s London). But there is certainly a
  tragic irony that social media, which the Beckhams have hitherto controlled so
  masterfully – has been the place that exposed their schisms. They were undone
  by omission, given that one of the other things our first family have embodied
  is a complete shift in showbiz journalism. So much entertainment coverage now
  comes from parsing who is or isn’t tagged in Instagram posts, who has stopped
  following who, who omitted to like this or that. And anyone can do this. It’s
  a form of mass Kremlinology. At the peak of their tabloid fame – or the first
  peak, perhaps we should say now – it became commonplace to suggest that in the
  modern era, the Beckhams were our real royal family. They seemed a reaction
  against all that old blood, that nepo privilege, that public repression of
  private truth. But now? Well, perhaps some of the plotlines are converging.
  Perhaps the House of Windsor and the House of Beckham are not so different
  after all. Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist Do you have an opinion on the
