  Fabergé, the jeweller famed for its imperial Russian Easter eggs, has been
  sold to a technology investor in a $50m (£37m) deal. Gemfields, which mines
  coloured gemstones in Africa, has agreed to sell Fabergé to SMG Capital, a US
  investment company controlled by the tech backer Sergei Mosunov. The
  struggling miner, which bought Fabergé in 2013 for $142m from the private
  equity company Pallinghurst, put the company up for sale in December, when
  political unrest in Mozambique prompted it to temporarily freeze operations at
  its ruby mine. Fabergé, which was founded in 1842 and taken over and
  transformed by Peter Carl Fabergé in 1882, is one of the most renowned
  jewellers in the world but has come under pressure amid a downturn in the
  luxury goods market. It made revenues of $13.4m in 2024, down from $15.7m the
  previous year. Sean Gilbertson, the chief executive of Gemfields, described
  the deal as “the end of an era”. He said: “Fabergé has played a key role in
  raising the profile of the coloured gemstones mined by Gemfields and we will
  certainly miss its marketing leverage and star power.” Mosunov, a venture
  capitalist and startup investor, said it was a “great honour … to become the
  custodian of such an outstanding and globally recognised brand”. Mosunov is a
  Russian national based in the UK. “Fabergé’s unique heritage, with ties to
  Russia, England, France and the USA, opens significant opportunities for
  further strengthening its position in the global luxury market and expanding
  its international presence,” he said. Fabergé is best known for the ornate
  eggs it made for the Russian royal family before the 1917 revolution. The
  jeweller began making Imperial Easter eggs when tsar Alexander III first
  commissioned them as a present for his wife, tsarina Maria Feodorovna, in
  1885. There are 50 Imperial Easter eggs in collections around the world.
  During the Russian revolution, the Bolsheviks seized the Fabergé workshops and
  closed down production. The family fled across Europe to Germany, Finland and
  Switzerland. The brand was revived under various iterations over the course of
  the 20th century, and was sold for $180m in 1984. Three years later it
  acquired the Elizabeth Arden brand for $700m. In 1989, the consumer goods
  group Unilever then bought Fabergé for $1.55bn. The brand was relaunched by
  the Fabergé family in 2009. While Fabergé is best known for its
  multimillion-pound Easter eggs, with a collection valued as high as £52m when
  auctioned in 2004, it has a number of other highly valued collector ranges, as
  well as lines of jewellery and watches. This spring the Castle Howard Fabergé
  range was put up for auction, an array of animal models carved from stones
  such as topaz and nephrite. Gemfields said it would use proceeds from the sale
  to help fund its mining operations in Mozambique and Zambia. Shares in the
  miner, which is dual listed on London’s junior stock market and Johannesburg’s
  exchange, have fallen by about 70% from their peak in 2023, as the miner has
  struggled against oversupply in the emerald market. In June the company told
  investors that the opening of a new mine in Mozambique had been delayed
  because of problems around illegal mining and work permits.
