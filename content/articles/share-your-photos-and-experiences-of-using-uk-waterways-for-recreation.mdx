  There are hundreds more waterways being used for swimming and boating in
  England than recorded by the government, data has revealed. A wide-ranging
  analysis of the ways that England’s waterways are used for recreation by the
  government has found 3,347 “water recreation locations” in rivers, lakes and
  seas around the country. These are places where people take part in activities
  including swimming, rowing and paddleboarding. The Environment Agency had
  previously identified 342. Campaigners have been pushing for more rivers and
  lakes to be designated as bathing waters in order to put pressure on water
  companies and the government to clean up England’s waterways. We’d like to
  hear from people about the different water recreation locations you visit and
  the activities you take part in around England and also other parts of the UK.
