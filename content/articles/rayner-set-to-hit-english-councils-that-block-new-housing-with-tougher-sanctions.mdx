  Angela Rayner is poised to introduce tougher sanctions on councils in England
  that block local housing developments. Councils could be forced to approve new
  housing developments – overturning locally agreed plans – under stricter rules
  or risk handing over control of their planning departments to Whitehall
  officials. Rayner, who has come under pressure this week for adding to her
  constituency residence and grace-and-favour home in London with the purchase
  of an £800,000 apartment near Brighton, already has considerable powers to
  overrule councils that block housing developments but is believed to be
  frustrated with continuing delays in the system. It is understood that before
  the end of the year the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government
  (MHCLG) will reduce the number of times a council can have planning appeals
  overturned before sanctions are imposed by central government. Hundreds of
  councils are expected to fall foul of the new rules after Rayner established
  new building targets to achieve the government’s aim of 1.5m new homes by the
  end of the parliament. The plan is already behind schedule according to
  building industry analysts after a slow start to the year by the major
  housebuilding firms. Rayner is expected to force more councils to rewrite
  their local plans to include higher housing targets or be stripped of local
  decision-making powers. An MHCLG spokesperson said: “The government is taking
  decisive action to deliver 1.5m homes through our plan for change, with major
  planning reforms and a landmark planning and infrastructure bill already
  introduced to drive housebuilding to its highest level in 40 years. “We are
  exploring plans to go further by making it easier to intervene where councils
  consistently make poor-quality decisions about planning applications and
  prevent the delivery of the homes and infrastructure we need. This will help
  to get Britain building again and restore the dream of home ownership.”
  Planning bodies say housebuilders have a surplus of planning approvals and the
  only barrier to an increase in housing starts is the economic slowdown and the
  reluctance of developers to jeopardise high prices by flooding the market with
  new homes. However, pressure is mounting from developers in many areas,
  especially in commuter belts around major cities, that want to build private
  housing estates with few amenities or public transport links, which are often
  banned under local plans. Last week Horsham district council in Surrey said it
  would challenge in a judicial review a decision by planning inspectors to
  approve housebuilding on a golf course, overturning a council decision
  blocking the plan. The council said the plans were “unsustainable” and lacked
  travel options other than by car. Within days of the judicial review
  announcement, Homes England announced a separate application to build 3,000
  homes in the district, which Horsham said posed “significant implications for
  our district and its communities”. It is pursuing the legal action against
  building on a golf course with the support of Active Travel England, “on the
  basis that the government-appointed planning inspector made significant legal
  errors”. Horsham has an existing local plan that was devised in consultation
  with the Environment Agency, which put restrictions on the number of new homes
  because of a shortage of drinking water. Local authorities are also under
  pressure to reduce emissions to meet net zero targets and integrate new
  developments into local plans. Rayner is expected to cut the percentage of
  appeals that are allowed to be overturned before a local plan must be revised
  from 10% to 5% after a consultation with planning bodies during the spring and
  summer. The Royal Town Planning Institute and the Town and Country Planning
  Association have objected to the move. The RTPI said planning departments were
  facing a combination of low staffing levels and high demand and needed more
  support from central government. Robbie Calvert, the head of policy at the
  RTPI, said: “We need to ensure that councils receive the effective investment
  necessary to achieve quality decisions in a timely manner.” Hugh Ellis, the
  director of policy at the TCPA, said councils were having their carefully
  crafted local plans ripped up by the department to the detriment of the local
  environment. In May, Wiltshire councils’s planning manager, Kenny Green, said
  there was a “very real risk of the authority entering special measures – which
  means the council cannot determine applications” after 7% of its applications
  were overturned. Green said the council was also close to missing its housing
  provision target of 3,525 homes a year, a number that was nearly doubled last
  year by the housing minister. Councils must demonstrate under local plans how
  they will increase supply over the next five years. The National Planning
  Policy Framework said planning applications should be granted where there was
  no up-to-date development plan, unless certain policy protections “provide a
  strong reason for refusing the development”. This year plans for new homes on
  flood plains in Kent and Somerset had been given the go-ahead by planning
  inspectors after appeals, against the advice of local planning officers. Last
  year research by the Home Builders Federation found that councils, mostly in
  southern England, had spent more than £50m on external legal advice on
  planning appeals over the previous three years.
