  Allotments were originally “allotted” to the landless poor of the 18th century
  to give them dignity, a means of eating and reprieve from the daily grind of
  land or industrial work (The one change that worked: I gave up my allotment –
  and accepted who I really am, 18 August). They were a necessity during the two
  world wars, after which Britain had never been leaner, fitter or taller.
  Today, we are not as hungry as our ancestors were and life is convenient.
  However, we are in the throes of obesity, diabetes and mental health crises,
  we stand on the edge of food supply catastrophe (for example, the tomato
  crisis of early 2023) and climate change is heavily affecting farmers. I had
  three children under three and I took on an allotment in my village when war
  in Ukraine broke out because I wanted to learn, and I wanted to be less
  reliant on a fragile food system that supplies tasteless fruit and vegetables.
  I knew little about growing, but quickly came to see that vegetable growing is
  hard work. Nothing looked like it did in the fancy seed catalogues, nothing
  grew exactly as I thought it would, beasts and pests ate everything and the
  vegetables were often tougher than supermarket imports, but they were sweeter
  too. I wrote about the experience in my second book My Family and Other
  Seedlings . My children are a little older now, but we still work at it
  together. We often fail, but we have lost so much of what our ancestors knew
  about growing food that I can’t help but feel that through failure comes
  understanding. It doesn’t have to be perfect and, frankly, having a go is
  probably more climate-friendly than recycling. Lalage Snow Rimpton, Somerset •
  I too know the relief of admitting that you are not green-fingered and should
  probably not be left in charge of a garden or allotment. I’ve found that I can
  still live out that fantasy by joining a community garden (though not while
  also carrying a baby in a sling). It’s perfect for me – I get to be muddy and
  enjoy the unique satisfaction of eating something I grew, but if I can’t go
  for a couple of weeks, everything is fine. Weeding’s always better when you’re
  with someone to talk to. For me, being part of a group takes away all my
  gardening shame and brings me only joy. I recommend it. Laurie Nettle London •
  Nicola Slawson shouldn’t beat herself up for leaving her allotment. Here in
  Hanwell, west London, as in most areas, unbribable plot inspectors frequently
  issue “non-cultivation” notices, but always offer the option of downsizing
  from a 10-pole plot to a five- or even 2.5-pole one. It is also true that some
  crops – peas and parsnips, for example – can be hard to bring to harvest, but
  any five-year-old can manage tomatoes and runner beans. The benefits of
  exercise and the joyous consumption of fresh fruit and veg are delights
  indeed, and I do hope that Nicola will once again slip on her boots and head
  for the oasis of tranquillity that may be found in the heart of even the
  meanest city. Stephen Pound Chair, Framfield Allotment Association • Have an
