  US immigration authorities have deported dozens of Russian asylum seekers to
  Moscow, including a serviceman wanted for desertion who has since been
  detained, the Guardian can reveal. At least two deportation flights operated
  by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) departed from the agency’s major
  detention hub in Alexandria, Louisiana and landed in Cairo, Egypt, where the
  asylum seekers were transferred to flights bound for Moscow with the
  cooperation of Egyptian and Russian authorities, according to interviews with
  passengers and human rights campaigners. The first flight departed in mid-June
  and carried about 30 Russian citizens. The most recent, on 27 August,
  transported approximately 50 people. “We were shackled and handcuffed, then
  forced on to an Ice plane to Cairo,” said one asylum seeker deported last
  week, who, like others, asked to remain anonymous to speak freely. They said
  their documents were confiscated and that, after a two-hour stopover in Egypt,
  local authorities ordered them to board a flight to Moscow. On arrival in
  Moscow, passengers were subjected to “filtration”: interrogations by Russia’s
  federal security services. Those without criminal convictions were released.
  The exact number of Russians deported, and how many of them had applied for
  political asylum, remains unclear owing to the opaque and chaotic nature of US
  deportation practices. Among those deported on 27 August was Andrei Vovchenko,
  a 25-year-old former Russian serviceman who deserted his post in October 2022.
  He was wanted for desertion, according to an official defence ministry notice
  sent to his family. The charges against him carry a sentence of up to 10 years
  in prison. The Guardian was unable to reach Vovchenko, but witnesses who were
  on the same flight said he was detained immediately on arrival in Moscow. “He
  begged not to be put on the plane to Moscow, but Egyptian police restrained
  him and tied him up,” said another person who was on the same deportation
  flight. “They tied him to his seat, and he cried the entire way from Egypt to
  Moscow.” The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not immediately
  respond to requests for comment and has not issued any official statement.
  Russia’s coordination with Egyptian security forces raises questions over
  whether US immigration authorities were aware that Russian citizens would
  ultimately be returned to Moscow. “Unfortunately, our worst fears are coming
  true,” said Vladimir Osechkin, a Russian human rights activist who operates
  the site Gulagu.net. “People in need of protection, fleeing Putin’s war and
  dictatorship, FSB torture and repression, have ended up in US prisons, dressed
  in orange jumpsuits and shackled during transfers like criminals. Some of them
  have been handed over to the FSB and other security services. This is cruel
  and shameful,” Osechkin said. “We appeal to the US authorities to halt these
  deportations and conduct a thorough review,” he added. On Wednesday, the
  leading Russian opposition figures Yulia Navalnaya, Vladimir Kara-Murza and
  Ilya Yashin issued a joint statement calling on the Canadian prime minister,
  Mark Carney, to grant asylum to Russians facing deportation from the US.
  “People who fled Kremlin repression and Putin’s prisons are ending up in
  American prisons. This appears profoundly unjust. Worse still, US courts are
  increasingly issuing denials of asylum claims and granting the executive
  branch the authority to deport our compatriots back to Russia – where, as a
  rule, this means immediate arrest by Putin’s security services,” they wrote in
  a letter published by the Globe and Mail. “We ask that Canada adopt a decision
  to grant asylum to those Russian citizens whose opposition and anti-war
  activities are beyond doubt, and who are subject to deportation orders by the
  US authorities,” the letter added. Donald Trump campaigned on a platform of
  mass deportation and his administration has reshaped immigration enforcement
  across the country. At least 195,000 people have been deported by Ice under
  Trump so far, according to a tally by the Guardian. Russia has seen a sharp
  rise in asylum applications to the US since its invasion of Ukraine, as many
  Russians seek to leave the country and avoid being drafted into the military.
  More than 8,300 Russian nationals have applied for asylum in the US since the
  start of the full-scale invasion, according to DHS data aggregated by the
  Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (Trac), a group that monitors
  immigration data. About 85% of Russians who applied for asylum were granted it
  in 2024, according to Trac. During much of Joe Biden’s term as US president,
  Russian dissidents and other asylum seekers were typically granted entry into
  the US on parole while their cases moved through the system. But starting in
  2023, that practice shifted: many applicants instead ended up in long-term
  detention, in some cases for more than a year, for reasons that remain
  unclear. The practice intensified significantly under Trump. There have been
  widespread reports from asylum seekers of human rights abuses in US detention
  since Trump’s inauguration. Several Russian nationals who were later deported
  said they had endured repeated instances of inhumane treatment while in US
  custody. One man, who applied for asylum on political grounds in May 2024,
  said he was soon detained and sent to Adams County Detention Center in
  Natchez, Mississippi. He described overcrowded, unsanitary conditions and a
  rapid decline in his health. “I weighed 93kg before they placed me in a
  detention centre. A month and a half later, I weighed 69kg,” said the man, who
  was deported to Russia in June. “I called my relatives, telling them: I’m
  probably going to die.” He said he had entered the US legally through the
  Mexican border and had been invited to an interview by immigration officials,
  but was instead taken into custody and placed in detention. He said conditions
  had grown harsher in the days before deportation. “A group of Ice officials
  came in with guns. They shouted that anyone who resisted would face violence,”
  he said. He recalled being shackled for hours, denied consistent medical care
  and given no information about his legal status or when he might appear before
  a judge. “It felt like we were being treated as criminals, not as people
  asking for protection from Russia,” he added. Trump has vowed to step up
  deportations in the coming weeks and months, leaving many Russians still in
  the asylum process in the US living in fear. “My husband was supposed to be
  deported on the flight last week but his lawyer managed to prevent that from
  happening,” said the wife of one asylum seeker, who added that her husband
  faced extremism charges in Russia for taking part in anti-government protests.
  “I can’t even imagine what would have happened to him if he had been sent
  back,” she added.
