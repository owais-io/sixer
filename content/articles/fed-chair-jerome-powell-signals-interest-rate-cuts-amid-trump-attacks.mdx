  The Federal Reserve is gearing up to resume cuts to interest rates, its chair,
  Jerome Powell, has signaled, as he warned that Donald Trump’s tariffs and
  immigration crackdown had roiled the global economy and hit the US workforce.
  For months, Powell has ignored demands from the president to cut interest
  rates and defied Trump’s calls to resign. But as the president ramps up his
  extraordinary attack on the Fed’s independence, Powell suggested on Friday
  that central bank officials are considering a rate cut. “With policy in
  restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks
  may warrant adjusting our policy stance,” Powell said in a closely scrutinized
  speech at a Jackson Hole symposium in Wyoming on Friday, highlighting a
  “challenging” dichotomy of risks: that Trump’s tariffs might increase
  inflation, while his immigration policies knock the US labor market. Wall
  Street rose sharply after the address, with the benchmark S&amp;P 500 gaining
  1.5% as the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 1.9% to close at a record
  high. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite reversed several days of declines to
  advance 1.9%. Trump, meanwhile, continues to encroach on the Fed’s
  independence and demand that it rapidly cuts rates. The president called on a
  Fed governor, Lisa Cook, to resign after one of his allies, the US Federal
  Housing Finance Agency head, Bill Pulte, alleged that she had committed
  mortgage fraud. After Cook said she had “no intention of being bullied” into
  stepping down, Trump told reporters in Washington on Friday: “I’ll fire her if
  she doesn’t resign.” Since Trump started his second term and overhauled the US
  trade system, Powell – who is usually reserved about making direct comments on
  executive branch policies – has been more outspoken about the impact of
  Trump’s tariffs. “This year, the economy has faced new challenges.
  Significantly higher tariffs across our trading partners are remaking the
  global system,” Powell said in his speech on Friday. “Tighter immigration
  policy has led to an abrupt slowdown in labor force growth.” Changes to tax,
  spending and regulation may also affect the economy, Powell added, tacitly
  underlining the erratic nature of government by Trump. “There is significant
  uncertainty about where all of these policies will eventually settle and what
  their lasting effects on the economy will be,” he said. Recent government data
  shows that US labor growth stalled this summer. While new jobs are still being
  added to the economy each month, Powell noted that it was “a curious kind of
  balance” where both the supply and demand for workers have been slowing. “This
  unusual situation suggests that downside risks to employment are rising. And
  if those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply
  higher layoffs and rising unemployment,” he said. Cutting rates could help
  boost the labor market, but it can also make inflation worse. Powell pointed
  out that Trump’s tariffs have “begun to push prices up in some categories of
  goods”. “The effects of tariffs on consumer prices are now clearly visible. We
  expect those effects to accumulate over coming months, with high uncertainty
  about timing and amounts,” Powell said. It is unclear whether tariffs will
  cause lasting inflation, meaning prices will continue to go up at higher
  paces, or if it will mean a one-time shift in the price level. At five
  consecutive meetings, the Fed has left rates unchanged, despite the
  president’s calls for rapid cuts. Before moving, most policymakers wanted more
  clarity on the economic impact of his policies, including sweeping tariffs on
  imports, and deportations. At the Fed’s last meeting, in July, when it again
  opted to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged, two governors opposed
  the decision – the first time multiple governors have voted against the
  majority since 1993. After the meeting, official employment data showed that
  jobs growth stalled this summer – prompting Trump to fire the federal official
  in charge of labor statistics – as inflation continued to rise. A parade of
  those aspiring to replace Powell next year – believed to include the two
  governors who called for rate cuts at the last Fed meeting, Christopher Waller
  and Michelle Bowman, and Kevin Hassett, the director of Trump’s national
  economic council – will be interviewed in the coming weeks.
