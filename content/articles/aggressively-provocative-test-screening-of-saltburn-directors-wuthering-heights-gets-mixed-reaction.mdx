  Heights gets mixed reaction

  Equal parts intrigue and scepticism had already dogged the forthcoming
  adaptation of Wuthering Heights from Emerald Fennell – whose first two films,
  Promising Young Woman and Saltburn, displayed a love of mordant and explicit
  envelope-pushing. As reported by World of Reel, a first test screening for the
  film, which stars Margot Robbie and Saltburn’s Jacob Elordi, took place
  earlier this week in Dallas, and audience reaction was “mixed”. One attender
  described the film as “aggressively provocative and tonally abrasive” and
  suggested it strongly recalled the “stylised depravity” of Saltburn with
  scenes of “clinical masturbation”, a bondage-tinged sexual encounter involving
  horse reins and less conventional romance or emotional complexity than many
  aficionados of Emily Brontë’s novel might expect. The film reportedly opens
  with a public hanging in which the “condemned man ejaculates mid-execution”.
  The crowd react orgiastically, and a nun “fondles the corpse’s visible
  erection”. Other signature Fennell shots include lingering takes of
  “suggestive textures” such as egg yolks, bread dough and slug trails. Test
  screenings offer production companies an early opportunity to gauge mainstream
  reactions to forthcoming releases. Studios show unfinished versions of films
  to the public, who usually promise confidentiality. The majority of final
  versions of movies differ from versions trialled in this way, with the endings
  of films a particularly common alteration. Films whose conclusions were
  changed following audience feedback include Titanic, 28 Days Later, Blade
  Runner, Pretty Woman and Sunset Boulevard. Earlier this year the film’s
  casting director, Kharmel Cochrane, defended her choices after many suggested
  Robbie was too old to play the role of Catherine Earnshaw, as well as
  questioning Elordi’s ethnicity, since Heathcliff, the foundling with whom she
  falls in love, is generally perceived to have a Romany or Gypsy background.
  Most big and small screen adaptations of the novel have ignored this, with the
  character having been played by actors including Ralph Fiennes, Tom Hardy and
  Timothy Dalton. Andrea Arnold’s 2011 adaptation cast a mixed race actor, James
  Howson, in the role. Speaking at the Sands film festival in Scotland, Cochrane
  said there was “no need to be accurate” as the source material is “just a
  book”. She continued: “There’s definitely going to be some English Lit fans
  that are not going to be happy. Wait until you see the set design, because
  that is even more shocking. And there may or may not be a dog collar in it.”
  The film, which is scheduled for release on Valentine’s Day 2026, will be
  Robbie’s first major role since Barbie and Fennell’s first film since Saltburn
  became an audience sensation in 2023, although it underperformed with awards
  bodies. World of Reel quotes another attender of the Dallas screening as
  saying that despite strong leading performances, Fennell’s take on their
  characters is sufficiently “cold and unlikable” that engagement with their
  fates is made difficult.
