  Taylor Swift wrote today’s headlines when she was only 17 with her country hit
  Love Story: “Baby, just say yes!” Now, at 35, she has announced her engagement
  to Travis Kelce, her American football player partner of two years, who got
  down on one knee and popped the question. “Your English teacher and your gym
  teacher are getting married,” she captioned the subsequently staged engagement
  photos of them in a rose garden. It’s gaudy, it’s cringe, it’s gleefully too
  much – some even say it makes the Bezos wedding look classy. But it’s perfect
  and it made me cry. When the pop star who has soundtracked your entire adult
  love life gets engaged, it’s discombobulating. Especially when they are
  similar in age. Over two decades, Swift has gifted a song for every crush,
  relationship, situationship, and heartbreak. (I even once plagiarised All Too
  Well lyrics in a very embarrassing email to an ex-boyfriend; he never did
  reply to my calling him “so casually cruel in the name of being honest”.) But
  marriage is new territory. Similarly to when a mate tells me they’re getting
  married, my delight over the news has been chased by bittersweet pangs of
  change and reflection: what role does Swift’s music play in our romantic lives
  now? She was there for those first flutters and disappointments: a teenager
  singing out loud the kind of heart-on-sleeve confessions that we kept safely
  hidden in our diaries (including ones way beyond teenhood). On the one hand,
  you could slot yourself into the lyrics of the story she’s telling: “Please
  don’t be in love with someone else,” she hoped in Enchanted. But then, you
  could go and find out exactly who she is writing about: “Don’t you think I was
  too young to be messed with?” she asked in Dear John, presumed by many to be
  about her musician ex John Mayer, which Swift never confirmed or denied. This
  triggered a global obsession with her relationships, but it has never stopped
  her writing about them, thank God. Weirdly, she makes dating famous people
  juicy and relatable. When we reached our 20s, ready to bite back at bad boys,
  the Red album was the ultimate bible of breakup bangers. Who didn’t fall to
  the floor screaming “OH!” when I Knew You Were Trouble came on? But she was at
  her most vulnerable, too, in All Too Well – a power ballad that even now
  pierces me with the pain of life after short-lived loves. The next album,
  1989, was more upbeat but just as scathing: I’m not ashamed to say that,
  during the peak of Blank Space, I clinked my drained wine glass at a dinner,
  stood up and announced: “Boys only want love if it’s torture”. Then Swift fell
  in love. Her 2017 album Reputation might have been vengeful, but the industry
  was the target, because her new boyfriend Joe Alwyn was actually nice! A
  classically handsome actor (“What can I say? You’re gorgeous”) who scratched
  her English thesp itch and was happy to shelter with her away from the
  bullshit (“He built a fire just to keep me warm”). Only someone totally lost
  in a cloud of sparkly love could then seriously release saccharine odes Me!
  and London Boy. They stayed together for six years and during that time she
  turned to writing more fictional songs, sometimes with Alwyn, on lockdown
  albums Folklore and Evermore. Look, I was happy for Swift and enjoyed ditties
  about the heiress Rebekah Harkness, former owner of Swift’s mansion, having a
  marvellous time ruining everything … but when she and Alwyn called it quits
  and she quickly started dating the 1975’s Matty Healy, I was ready for the
  real-life dramas she essayed between her and Healy in last year’s The Tortured
  Poets Department. This time, though, the breakup with Alwyn hit differently:
  Swift was talking about the end of a long-term relationship in her 30s. “I’m
  pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free,” she sings in So Long,
  London (the couple lived near Hampstead Heath). It’s a haunting line: not even
  a superstar such as Swift is immune from the pressures of the biological clock
  and milestones put on women. Perhaps that realisation is why her relationship
  with Kelce feels properly joyful. Kelce declared that he fancied her on his
  podcast. They met up, fell in love and are now engaged. They don’t try to hide
  how besotted they are. “No one’s ever had me, not like you,” she swoons in So
  High School, a song about Kelce on TTPD sister album The Anthology. Marrying
  the jock feels like a full circle moment for the self-styled outsider teenager
  who sang: “She wears high heels, I wear sneakers / She’s cheer captain and I’m
  on the bleachers.” Where does she go from here? Swift has promised that her
  forthcoming 12th studio album, The Life of a Showgirl, will be a set of poppy
  bangers about her life on the Eras tour – which, a few months in, Kelce became
  part of. Beyond that, perhaps Swift will connect with maturing fans by writing
  about the real love story: meeting at a time when they, like the rest of us,
  don’t have time to waste on red flags and maybes. She would be writing on new
  ground: secure and settled. And those songs would be welcome. In the closing
  song of her 1989 album, You Are in Love, she sings: “I understand now why they
  lost their minds and fought the wars / And why I’ve spent my whole life trying
  to put it into words.” She has done this for millions of women and always will
  – even if she ends up starting a family and opening a Christmas tree farm,
  going back to her childhood roots. And, for those who might need it in the
  next decade, there’s always the possibility of a killer divorce album. •
