  The ancient Aztecs aren’t usually grouped with today’s self-help gurus. But
  their philosophy, preserved in early post-conquest records, offers
  surprisingly sharp tools for modern life. Unlike stoicism or Buddhism, which
  emphasize internal reflection as the path to a better life, the Aztecs
  believed that you should start with your surroundings, your relationships,
  your body and speech. In their view, wisdom begins outside. Here are 10
  lessons from their “outward path”, starting with those that clarify life
  goals. 1 You aren’t really after happiness, you just think you are The pursuit
  of happiness is written into the US Declaration of Independence. Aristotle
  wrote volumes about its role as the chief aim of our life more than 2,000
  years before that. While it’s a staple notion in our culture, the Aztecs took
  a more realistic approach. “Happiness”, when it’s not some complicated idea
  that’s drifted from our ordinary meaning, is fleeting and tends to be followed
  by its opposite: pain or at least fatigue. That means “happiness” isn’t a
  suitable goal in life, though it at first looks plausible. What you truly want
  is something richer, and they likened it to rootedness: being firmly grounded
  in your body, mind, society and nature. We make sacrifices for our friends and
  our children, after all, and we think our lives are better for it. That’s
  exactly the Aztec point. 2 The things that make life worth living also make it
  fragile A second idea, which finds some expression in stoicism and Buddhism,
  is that you’re after a life that is invulnerable. It’s the notion that if
  you’re a good person, none of the things that matter in your life can be
  affected by life’s unpredictable events, even by tragedies. The Aztecs
  wouldn’t agree. The best things in life, such as love, integrity and justice,
  also expose you to pain. Emiliano Zapata, the people’s revolutionary in Mexico
  who was fluent in Nahuatl and loyal to his people, died young because he
  refused to betray his values. Aztec ethics embrace this tension: that meaning
  arises from choices that involve risk. A well-rooted life accepts heartbreak
  as part of the price of significance. 3 The wise don’t think for themselves
  It’s tempting to think that if you were just smart enough, you’d have all the
  answers. We tend to valorize the “lone wolf” individual who knows better than
  the crowd. But for the Aztecs, you shouldn’t need to “go it alone” if you live
  in a healthy community of friends and family. Ideally, good thinking is done
  in good groups. The Aztecs held structured group deliberations, where even the
  young had a voice, though experience carried weight. They would advise that
  you could build your own “decision circle” and vet your goals with people who
  challenge and support you. If you’re thinking alone, you’re probably not
  thinking at your best. 4 Great courage comes from small things The stories of
  Aztec heroism during the colonial period are legion. For example, it turns out
  that Cortés had a son, named Martín, with a Native woman. And though Martín
  should have been treated well, he was left bereft of political protection some
  time after his (in)famous father died. Local authorities captured him and
  forced him to endure brutal torture in an attempt to provoke a false
  confession. Martín never gave in. While such feats of endurance are partly
  grounded in a person’s innate personality, Martín may well have learned some
  of the ways the Aztecs instilled courage through repeated small hardships.
  They didn’t optimize for ease. They taught their children to sweep before
  dawn, to carry heavy logs, and to stay up late. But in these many small feats,
  they also taught them how to sing while they worked and to manage their
  outlook. Courage starts small and grows strong. 5 Social vulnerability builds
  lifelong stability We live in a world under the constant gaze of others. Yet,
  if you want to live your life, and not the life “they” tell you to lead, you
  will have to learn to ignore “them”. Similarly, if you want to live well, to
  preserve the value of your own self-worth, then you need to learn what is of
  real value. One father is documented as he proudly recounts doing humble, hard
  work to raise his son, never stealing even a grain. You can build this skill
  through strategic vulnerability. Try doing something mildly embarrassing.
  Speak the truth when it’s awkward. Let your social mask slip. That’s how you
  can try to gain some distance from “their” gaze. 6 Willpower isn’t one thing,
  it’s three A paradox I noticed in graduate school was that I had no problem
  putting in hours of tedious study, but I would cave on my dieting goals if
  someone put a cookie in front of me. The Aztecs took an approach that solves
  this paradox. Willpower comes in three forms: Drive (high-intensity action),
  Durability (consistent effort), and Discipline (resistance to temptation). You
  need different tools for different challenges. Running into a flooded basement
  is not the same as resisting late-night cake. You need to train all three. 7
  When on the path, it’s easier to stay on the path Consistent action begets
  more consistent action. Aztec students swept daily before sunrise and kept
  their rooms clean. Today, it might be spending 15 minutes each day on a
  foreign language or making your bed. Whatever it is, hook your new effort to
  an existing habit to build yet more consistent actions. 8 You need to practice
  cravings to stop them The Aztecs fasted not to shame their bodies but to train
  them. Fasting was paired with feasting and used to practice discipline, the
  kind of willpower that opposes temptation. The goal was a higher-level
  awareness of your reactions. For example, you might notice that hunger comes
  in waves, rather than building infinitely. Craving, like emotion, can be
  ridden out if you know what to expect and why you endure. 9 What crosses your
  lips pre-frames your mind The Aztecs emphasized “right speech” as a way of
  aligning outer habits with inner values. Words, once spoken, nudge your mind
  into specific frames of thought. So they trained children to speak
  deliberately, truthfully, humbly, and to avoid gossip. Modern psychologists
  like Robert Cialdini have come to similar conclusions. What you say out loud
  subtly rewires how you think. So be careful: your words communicate thoughts
  and calibrate your expectations. 10 Why the wise follow the outward path The
  Aztecs believed wisdom starts not with introspection but with habit, ritual
  and environment. Clean your space. Speak with care. Eat with intention. Build
  habits that train your body and attune your mind. As you do, your inner world
  comes into alignment. You don’t need to solve your soul before setting your
  house in order. In fact, the outer path might just be the way to reach your
  inner peace. Sebastian Purcell is an associate professor of philosophy at
  Suny-Cortland in New York, where he researches ethics, Aztec philosophy and
  mathematical logic. He is the author of Discourses of the Elders: the Aztec
  Huehuetlatolli, a First English Translation and most recently, The Outward
  Path: The Wisdom of the Aztecs
