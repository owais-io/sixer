  The death of a man in France that was livestreamed on online platform Kick has
  sparked a police investigation and calls for regulators to examine what
  happened and how it was allowed to be beamed out live on the internet. What is
  Kick, what happened, and what could happen next? What happened? Raphaël
  Graven, 46, from southern France and known online as Jean Pormanove, had built
  a profile on Kick, where he had reportedly gained over a million followers. He
  died during an extended live stream on the platform this week. Leading up to
  his death, he was allegedly physically assaulted and humiliated by
  co-streamers as viewers watched. Excerpts of hours-long videos, which the
  Guardian has seen, appear to show Graven being hit, insulted, strangled, and
  shot at with a paintball gun. His channel has since been removed, and the
  co-streamers have been banned while Kick investigates. A lawyer for one of the
  co-streamers told local media that Graven had cardiovascular problems and the
  scenes “are just staged, they follow a script”. An autopsy has been ordered,
  and there is a police investigation into Graven’s death. What is Kick? Kick is
  a livestreaming platform similar to Twitch where people often watch people
  playing video games or doing other activities. It was founded in Melbourne in
  2022 by billionaires Ed Craven and Bijan Tehrani. Craven founded one of the
  world’s biggest cryptocurrency casinos, Stake.com, and Kick grew its user base
  by luring Twitch streamers who had been sponsored by Stake on Twitch before
  the Amazon-owned company banned gambling advertising. Kick states that content
  creators keep 95% of the revenue from their streams. Kick has a reputation of
  having a lighter approach to content moderation than Twitch, but has community
  guidelines that do not permit “content that depicts or incites abhorrent
  violence including significant harm, suffering or death”. The platform also
  states it does not permit content which involves displays of serious and
  significant self-harm. Earlier this year, the company also announced it would
  only allow gambling streams from sites that use ID verification, to prevent
  minors from being exposed to such content. Why was the channel not banned? A
  spokesperson for Kick did not say why the Jean Pormanove channel had not been
  banned prior to Graven’s death. “We are urgently reviewing the circumstances
  and engaging with relevant stakeholders to investigate the situation,” the
  spokesperson said. “Kick’s community guidelines are designed to protect
  creators, and we remain committed to upholding these standards across our
  platform.” What has Kick said about the death? The company has said it is
  cooperating with the investigation, and it was saddened about Graven’s death.
  “We are deeply saddened by the loss of Jean Pormanove and extend our
  condolences to his family, friends and community.” Will Kick face any
  repercussions? In France, the country’s junior minister for AI and digital
  technology, Clara Chappaz, said the death and the violence Graven allegedly
  suffered “are absolutely horrific” and said a judicial investigation was under
  way. The matter was also referred to the digital regulator Arcom, as well as
  France’s portal for reporting concerns about internet content. Given Kick is
  an Australian company, there may also be local implications. A spokesperson
  for the eSafety commissioner said it was a “tragic case” that underscores “how
  the creation of more extreme content … can have devastating, real-world
  consequences”. The spokesperson said “platforms like Kick need to be doing
  more to enforce their own terms of use and minimise harmful content and
  conduct in streams to protect all users of the service”. Given the chat
  functionality in Kick, the platform could come under the Australian
  government’s under-16s social media ban from December, the spokesperson said.
  Separate from that, industry codes and standards in effect also currently
  require companies like Kick to have systems to safeguard Australians from
  content, including that which depicts crime or violence without justification.
  “This includes requirements to enforce their terms of use prohibiting such
  material, and to deal with user reports appropriately and promptly,” the
  spokesperson said. “eSafety will use the full range of our enforcement powers
  as appropriate where there is non-compliance, which can include seeking
  penalties of up to A$49.5m.” Other codes aimed at addressing children’s access
  to high-impact violence are under consideration. Has this happened on other
  services before? There have been multiple incidents of people’s deaths being
  livestreamed on the internet. In 2016, a Chicago man was shot and killed while
  livestreaming on Facebook. The Christchurch massacre in 2019 was livestreamed
  on Facebook for 17 minutes. In 2020, a Mississippi man killed himself during a
  live stream on Facebook. Following Christchurch, Meta implemented changes to
  detect such content and remove it, and prevent it being spread. The company
  trained its artificial intelligence to detect and block any future attempt to
  livestream a shooting spree with “police/military body cams footage,” and
  other violent material. • In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is
  13 11 14. In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116
  123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie. In the US, you can call
  or text the 988 Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline at 988 or chat at
  988lifeline.org. Other international helplines can be found at befrienders.org
