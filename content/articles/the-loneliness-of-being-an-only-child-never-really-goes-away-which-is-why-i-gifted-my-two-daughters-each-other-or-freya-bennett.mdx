  I recently stumbled across a letter I wrote to Santa when I was six years old.
  Deep in a box of crumpled photos and loose negatives, my earnest
  correspondence to the big man requested nothing but a sibling. I wrote sister
  in every possible iteration: half-sister, adopted sister, stepsister, foster
  sister and, underneath, just in case Santa couldn’t grant that particular
  wish, I added the same options for brother. If Santa somehow turned out to be
  real and started granting wishes to tired mums in their late 30s, my wish
  would probably remain the same: I’d rewrite history and add a sibling. A
  lovely one, preferably, but I’ll take what I can get. Because honestly? Being
  an only child sucks. My parents split up when I was one. It was the right
  call, as are most divorces, however it meant the experience of a full sibling
  was off the table at an early age. I spent my early years with my single mum;
  we were a great team and I was very comfortable with things as they were.
  Until I started noticing friends acquiring siblings. What fun my friends had
  with their siblings! An inbuilt playmate! A co-conspirator against the enemy
  that is parents! Someone to blame when things got broken! Someone to confide
  in when things got tough! I was sold. My poor mother had to deal with my
  begging and pleading for a sibling, which unbeknownst to me was her wish too.
  Circumstances weren’t on our side and, after years of trying to convince her
  to conjure a sibling out of thin air, I set my sights on my dad and
  stepmother. I moved in with them at age 12 to attend a high school in the
  city. With my stepmum being younger than my dad, the chance of a baby
  half-sibling seemed much higher and I wasted no breath in regularly asking for
  one. Deep in their PhDs, however, my wish was not to be granted and my teenage
  years crept by without a sibling in sight. To add to the loneliness of being
  an only child, I had no cousins I was close with. Either by distance, age or
  having little in common, it was just me and a bunch of adults. When you’re a
  kid trying to figure out the world without other kids messing up beside you,
  it can feel like you’re doing it all wrong. All the focus lands on you and
  that attention could be utterly mortifying. Nowhere was this more
  excruciatingly clear than the summer I got my second-ever period during a
  Christmas trip to visit my grandparents in Sydney. Having not yet braved
  tampons, I told everyone I’d just skip swimming for the week. But with four
  adults and no other kids to absorb their attention, it was decided: I would
  learn to use a tampon. Much to my dismay, my grandpa was sent out to buy mini
  tampons and, as suggested by my stepmum, a small jar of Vaseline “to help
  things along”. The process was explained in painful detail by my stepmum, with
  well-meaning interjections from my grandmother. When I was finally sent off to
  the bathroom to give it a go, I was acutely aware of the four adults waiting
  just outside the door, eager for news of my success. While the tampon incident
  of 2002 was indeed a success, that summer made me painfully aware of how
  different I was from families with multiple kids running around. While I’m
  sure there are mortifying moments in bigger families, at least there’s comfort
  in knowing you aren’t the only one experiencing toe-curling embarrassment. At
  the risk of someone pulling out a tiny violin, at 38 my yearning for a sibling
  has only deepened. The loneliness of being an adult only child is an
  interesting catch-22 in a time when only-child families are surging and I find
  myself biting my tongue lest I make someone feel bad for not giving their
  child a sibling. No one should be made to feel bad for not having more kids,
  especially not in this economy (or this climate), but it does add a layer to
  the loneliness of being an only child: feeling like you can’t actually talk
  about it (I know, I know – tiny violin). So while I’ll never experience the
  delight of completely unhinged sibling fights that are resolved two seconds
  later, or the joy of being an aunty to kids I adore that I can hand back, I
  have gifted my daughters each other. Twenty months into my experience of
  parenting siblings and I’m already relishing the “But she spat on me first!”
  and the “But I’m not even touching her” (said by a seven-year-old whose toe is
  a millimetre from angry screaming toddler’s face). And somehow, watching them
  navigate this ridiculous, messy relationship is quietly healing my childhood
  loneliness. • Freya Bennett is a writer based on Dja Dja Wurrung Country and
