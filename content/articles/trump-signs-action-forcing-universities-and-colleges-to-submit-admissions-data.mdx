  Donald Trump signed an executive action on Thursday forcing colleges and
  universities to submit data to prove they do not consider race in admissions,
  as the White House intensifies its scrutiny of higher education institutions
  that receive federal funding. The Trump administration is accusing colleges of
  using personal statements and other proxies in order to consider race, despite
  a 2023 supreme court ruling reversing affirmative action, as part of its wider
  attack on diversity-, inclusion- and equality-related initiatives at American
  institutions. “Although the Supreme Court of the United States has
  definitively held that consideration of race in higher education admissions
  violates students’ civil rights,” the presidential memorandum reads, “the
  persistent lack of available data – paired with the rampant use of ‘diversity
  statements’ and other overt and hidden racial proxies – continues to raise
  concerns about whether race is actually used in practice.” In the memorandum,
  Trump directs the education secretary, Linda McMahon, to require that higher
  education institutions submit “the data necessary to verify that their
  admissions do not involve unlawful discrimination”. McMahon is to overhaul the
  US higher education database, expand the scope of required admissions
  reporting and increase accuracy checks to help provide additional
  “transparency”. In 2023, the conservative-majority US supreme court ruled
  against the use of affirmative action in admissions, drastically changing the
  way universities can ensure the diversity of the student body. It allowed only
  limited use, in that colleges may still consider how race has shaped students’
  lives if applicants share that information in their admissions essays.
  Conservative activists welcomed the ruling, arguing that affirmative action
  policies discriminate against white students. But it was heavily criticized by
  those who argue that race-conscious policies create more equal opportunities
  for students from marginalized groups, including students of color and those
  from low-income backgrounds, disadvantaged by historical discrimination in the
  higher education system, given the country’s history. The action appears to
  codify for all universities the recent settlement agreements the
  administration negotiated with Ivy League universities Brown and Columbia,
  restoring their federal research funding in return for the institutions
  adopting measures including the release of admissions data, with the
  institutions required to demonstrate that hiring and admissions are
  “merit-based” and not based on considerations of diversity and race. The
  universities agreed to give the government data on the race, grade point
  average and standardized test scores of applicants, admitted students and
  enrolled students. The schools also agreed to an audit by the government and
  to release admissions statistics to the public.
