  On Wednesday, one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded hit a
  sparsely populated region in far-east Russia. It triggered a tsunami that
  started crossing the ocean at hundreds of miles an hour. What followed was a
  race against time: early-warning systems went into alert mode as waves fanned
  out towards the coastlines of Japan, Hawaii and the US west coast. The damage
  appears to have been minor so far and this is, in part, thanks to a global and
  highly successful disaster response effort. More than 3 million people were
  successfully told to evacuate their homes. At the centre of this remarkable
  response was the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre (PTWC), based in Hawaii.
  Founded in 1949, it was monitoring tsunamis across the entire ocean by the
  1960s. A small team of experts identified the size and depth of the
  earthquake, and a tsunami warning was triggered straight away. The whole thing
  worked like clockwork – their speed and accuracy may have saved thousands of
  lives, with temporary evacuees now allowed to return home. But this type of
  work could be under threat. The PTWC is part of a US government agency that
  has faced cuts from the Trump administration. The 8.8-magnitude earthquake hit
  off Russia’s Kamchatka peninsula on Wednesday morning. The rupture happened
  along hundreds of miles of a fault line where the Pacific plate is sinking
  below the North American plate. This is one of the largest faults on Earth –
  it is called a megathrust fault – and parts of it are underwater, which means
  there is always a tsunami risk. The earthquake was 30 miles (47km) beneath sea
  level and sent shock waves at a range of 200 miles. Tsunamis travel across the
  ocean at about 500mph, the speed of a jumbo jet, so some communities had just
  few minutes’ warning – while those on the other side of the ocean had a few
  hours. Unlike in the movies, when it is typically one massive wave, tsunamis
  are often several waves that will continue to travel around the world for
  days. What has the damage been and where? The epicentre was near the Russian
  city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, which has a population of 180,000 people.
  Residents fled inland as ports flooded, while 200 miles north, the
  Klyuchevskoy volcano erupted, with lava descending its western slope. Maximum
  tsunami wave heights of 4 metres (13ft) were observed in Kamchatka. Some
  buildings on the coastal area of Severo-Kurilsk in Russia were swept away,
  according to local officials. The Kremlin has said alert systems “worked well”
  in the earthquake response and there were no casualties. The tsunami prompted
  warnings and evacuations across the Pacific, including in Japan, the US west
  coast, Hawaii, Canada, Chile, Ecuador and New Zealand. Nevertheless, the
  height of the waves turned out to be lower than initially feared. In Hawaii
  the highest recorded waves reached 1.8 metres, in California there were surges
  of just over a metre, and in Japan waves also topped a metre in some coastal
  areas. How good was the warning system? Local authorities were clear about how
  to evacuate and gave specific locations across more than a dozen nations. In
  Hawaii, for example, tsunami warning sirens blared. Evacuations were ordered
  for some coastal areas as the Honolulu department of emergency management
  announced: “Take action. Destructive tsunami waves expected.” People received
  alerts on their phones. All islands activated emergency operating centres,
  shelters opened, and people in coastal areas were told to go to higher ground.
  Similar warnings were issued elsewhere. In Japan, almost 2 million people had
  been ordered to higher ground. Local media reported one fatality of a woman
  killed while driving her car off a cliff as she tried to escape. In Chile,
  authorities conducted what the interior ministry said was “perhaps the most
  massive evacuation ever carried out in our country” involving 1.4 million
  people. Ilan Kelman, professor of disasters and health at University College
  London, says: “It looks like it’s been very effective. People had that
  long-term education, and that long-term readiness to know what to do.” He
  estimates that this preparedness saved thousands of lives. At this time of
  year there is a lot of tourist activity along many Pacific coastlines, and
  visitors are often unfamiliar with local warning systems or evacuation zones.
  This can make evacuations more challenging. “It appears from places where the
  tsunami wave has hit, numerous lives were saved by drawing on that past
  experience,” says Kelman, notably the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, which killed
  more than 200,000 people. At the time there was no regional tsunami early
  warning system in place, and the Indian Ocean was not considered a high-risk
  area. Some warnings were sent by fax and email, and did not reach people in
  time. The 2004 tsunami was also significantly more severe – some waves
  exceeded 30 metres in height; whereas so far waves from this latest tsunami
  appear to have reached a maximum of 5 metres in Russia, says Kelman. In most
  places, waves were less than a metre high, and in many places effects were
  negligible so the disaster that was anticipated did not arrive. This is
  another important factor in why damage has been limited. What improvements can
  be made? Several international centres send out automatic messages for
  earthquakes, depending on the location. The Indian Ocean tsunami warning
  system was set up after 2004. Kelman says: “It was never done before then
  because it was always too expensive, there were always other priorities, but
  suddenly it became a priority … It has been tested several times with mixed
  results, so we have to improve it.” There is no effective equivalent for the
  Atlantic Ocean. The main centre to identify this earthquake was the PTWC.
  “They were on it right away,” says Kelman. “Knowing the size of the earthquake
  and the depth of the earthquake and the type of the earthquake meant that
  there was a significant chance of a major tsunami. They issued tsunami
  warnings and got the messages out there, which were then disseminated by
  national governments and local authorities.” However, the PTWC sits within a
  US government agency targeted by Elon Musk-led cuts earlier this year. Kelman
  says this tsunami shows how needed it is. He says: “We would hope that if the
  cuts did affect them, they will be reversed and that the people who have saved
  lives today will also get more support for appropriate resources. “It appears
  that they were nonetheless exceptionally effective, and we owe them so many
  thanks for issuing appropriate messages and saving many lives.” • This article
  was amended on 21 August 2025. An earlier version said waves in Japan remained
  under half a metre; in fact, some waves reached over a metre in height.
