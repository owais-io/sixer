  When I moved to Brooklyn in 2005, I noticed people building restaurants and
  bars that looked like 1950s diner-style restaurants, with soda fountains and
  lunch counters. I’m from Canada and I don’t think there’s a period that
  Canadians look back on with such nostalgia. I grew up on Vancouver Island
  watching old US movies and thinking, as I looked across the water towards
  America, that they showed what the country must look like. But our idea of
  those times is not firsthand, and I got really curious about that, and the
  fact that those days were not better for most people, only a few. That false,
  nostalgic feeling has become dangerous, with Trump’s “make America great
  again” rhetoric. In 2013, I started to drive around smaller towns in
  Pennsylvania to look at places that remain from the 50s. There are towns where
  maybe the mine closed, or the highway moved, and so – unlike the diners in New
  York, which keep getting renovated and extended – these places stayed as they
  were. It feels like the past and the present are somehow taking place at the
  same time. It’s really beautiful. In 2015, I started an Instagram account
  called American Squares, which is more about nostalgia than it is nostalgic.
  When I look at these prefabricated diners that rolled off assembly lines, so
  beautiful in their details, I think about how the people who invented them
  would be shocked that we’re looking back now in this way. They were trying to
  get to the moon: they were future-oriented people. I first came across this
  particular hot dog joint in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, called the Very Best, in
  around 2016. I noticed that it had a lovely Vitrolite storefront and a great
  typographic sign. It had closed the year before, having originally opened in
  1921. But then a local took it on, restored it beautifully and reopened it in
  September 2019. When I passed by again in 2021, the owner was following social
  distancing guidelines, which is why it was so quiet. I’m often looking to give
  a sense of time and place to my photos, and one clue is the image of Hall and
  Oates on the jukebox. Daryl Hall is from Pottstown and John Oates grew up in
  the same county. The vintage arcade game Centipede was developed by Atari and
  co-designed by Dona Bailey – one of only a few female game programmers in the
  industry at the time. It was one of the first arcade games with a significant
  female player base. I was working on a series that eventually became my book
  Lunch Poems, in which this image appears. I focused on communal settings, or
  “third spaces” outside of home and work. We lost those spaces for a period
  during the pandemic and we all suffered for it in ways we maybe haven’t fully
  acknowledged yet. The Very Best was a beloved third space in this town, where
  you could stop and chat, where everyone was super-friendly. There was at one
  time a waitress who had worked there for 44 years. But I chose to photograph
  this business empty. What photographers leave out of the frame often
  influences the final meaning as much as what we include. There is a
  conspicuous absence of people in the pictures in this series and that’s a
  construct, a metaphor for having been kept apart by the pandemic, driven to
  despair and divided by politics. I wanted to show the separateness and the
  emptiness. When we look at these pictures we might ask, “What happened here?”
  or “What will happen next?” The Lunch Poems photographs paint an almost
  postapocalyptic scene. Not all the pictures in the book were made during the
  pandemic, but that was the prism through which I began to look at the finished
  images, and it shaped the editing process. I frame my photographs carefully to
  explore what I want to communicate. For this series, if a space was crowded, I
  waited for people to leave. Or I arrived just as it was opening or closing. I
  do wonder whether that was always responsible, as I’m guessing the business
  owner doesn’t want their restaurant to be captured as melancholic and empty.
  But rather than an actual place as it is in reality, I’m photographing an idea
  I’m thinking about, and that I hope others may understand and reflect upon.
