  The Tottenham chair, Daniel Levy, believes he will get credit for his time in
  charge only when he leaves and is confident that Thomas Frank can help the
  club to “compete at the highest level”. In a rare interview, Levy described
  the construction of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium as his greatest achievement
  and hit back at fans who have blamed him for the club’s failure to win more
  trophies. “It’s one of those situations when I’m not here I’m sure I’ll get
  the credit,” Levy told Gary Neville on his Overlap podcast. “This stadium is a
  symbol of Tottenham Hotspur on the global map. It’s fantastic for the local
  community – the employment we’re creating because of this stadium. The fact
  that other clubs are now trying to copy what we’re doing, that should be a
  sign that maybe we did do something bold and something right.” The Europa
  League triumph last season was Spurs’ first trophy since 2008 and came just
  before the end of a Premier League campaign when they finished 17th after a
  record 22 defeats. Levy sacked Ange Postecoglou 16 days after the win against
  Manchester United in the final in Bilbao and he is hopeful that Frank can help
  the club to challenge for trophies on a more consistent basis. “Whenever you
  appoint a coach, you always believe it’s right,” Levy said. “You need a lot of
  ingredients for it to be right. Thomas is a highly intelligent individual, a
  fantastic way about him in terms of communication. “He will be great at
  developing young players and older players and making them better. He gets the
  style of football we want to play. We haven’t said to him: ‘You’ve got to win
  the league this year.’ We just want to compete at the highest level.” Levy was
  critical of the Premier League for the time it has taken to conclude the case
  involving alleged breaches of the league’s regulations by Manchester City. The
  club, who deny wrongdoing, were charged in February 2023 with more than 130
  breaches . “It would be really unfair of me to talk about another club in the
  Premier League,” he said. “All I would say is that it’s going through a
  process which has gone on for far too long. It needs to be brought, for the
  good of the game, to a conclusion one way or another.”
