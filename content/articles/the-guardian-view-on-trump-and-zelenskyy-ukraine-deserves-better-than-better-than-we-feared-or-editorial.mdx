  The Guardian view on Trump and Zelenskyy: Ukraine deserves better than 'better
  than we feared' | Editorial

  The verdict on Donald Trump’s meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other
  European leaders on Monday depends entirely upon the metric used. The great
  fear was that this might prove a disaster along the lines of the US
  president’s dressing down of the Ukrainian leader in February – a scenario so
  plausible that Sir Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron, Friedrich Merz and other key
  European leaders dropped everything to dash to the White House themselves in
  support. Following his red carpet welcome for Vladimir Putin in Alaska on
  Friday, Mr Trump reportedly backed the idea that Ukraine should hand over the
  Donbas to achieve a peace deal. Even if one were naive enough to think that
  the Kremlin would see that as an end to conflict, rather than a staging post
  for a later offensive, it would not be a “land swap” but a land grab that
  Ukraine – for good reason – could not stomach. Kyiv would be handing over
  territory that Moscow has spent years attempting but failing to seize. On the
  basis of those meetings’ precedents, there was cause for some relief after the
  Washington talks: it could have been much worse. Yet judged by the standards
  of conventional diplomacy, let alone Ukraine’s needs, it was alarming. Last
  month, Mr Trump threatened tough sanctions against Russia. En route to Alaska,
  he warned that there would be “very severe consequences” if there wasn’t a
  ceasefire that day. Yet on Monday, with Ukrainian civilians under intense
  Russian attack, he said there was no need to stop the fighting while a deal is
  agreed. Never mind the administration’s weak grasp of detail, lack of
  competence and general inconsistency. Never mind the failure to apply itself
  to the kind of committed, diligent diplomacy required for peace. The record
  shows that Ukraine and its European allies repeatedly exert every effort –
  from a new suit to arms purchases – to draw Mr Trump towards their position.
  Yet his compass needle always seems to swing back towards Mr Putin. Mr Trump
  should be standing with a democracy, alongside traditional allies, against a
  war criminal. But at best, he wants to be a mediator. The Kremlin has yet to
  confirm that the Russian leader will meet Mr Zelenskyy, as Mr Trump said he
  would. Mr Trump has said that the US will “help out” Europe with security
  guarantees and “coordinate” any such effort. But there is still no sign that
  this administration will provide the kind of backing that might make allies
  willing to put boots on the ground, or to persist with them if tested by
  Russia. Arguably the most important takeaway from Monday was the ability of
  European leaders of very different political persuasions – including Italy’s
  Giorgia Meloni – to coordinate effectively. That’s good news, but there’s a
  difference between fending off the worst case scenario and being able to
  establish a concrete plan for the future. Despite Russian advances in recent
  weeks – spurred by the prospect of talks – this war is costing Moscow dearly
  too. Mr Putin could yet conclude that it is not in his interests to continue.
  But even if Mr Trump can be held to his latest position, it remains far short
  of what is necessary. Ukraine urgently needs action to secure the future of
  thousands of children kidnapped by Russia, the promise of justice in the
  future, and above all, a ceasefire, before more lives are lost. Do you have an
