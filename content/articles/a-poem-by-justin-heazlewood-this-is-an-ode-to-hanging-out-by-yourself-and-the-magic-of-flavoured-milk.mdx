  13 Ways to Drink Chocolate Milk by Justin Heazlewood 1 The word Lisa is etched
  into a tree and I feel ill. 2 If I had a straw I would breathe some life into
  my milk. 3 She says hello, he ignores me and no one is drinking chocolate
  milk. 4 It’s too sweet like melted soap. 5 Another boy drinking my brand. 4°
  of refrigeration. 6 The chocolate milk doesn’t know that I’m preoccupied with
  listening to blackbirds. 7 He’s got plain milk and a tennis ball. It could be
  an apple. 8 My chocolate milk and I did not guess that girl would finish her
  tea and have a limp. 9 This milk is unnatural. The corners don’t fit my hand.
  10 My chocolate milk has faded since I bought it. 11 All I want is someone to
  agree with me that it’s cold, so I can throw my milk away. 12 I can look at my
  chocolate milk on the internet. 13 If I drank my chocolate milk and no one
  cared, did I really want it in the first place? Cigarettes and chocolate milk
  / these are just a couple of my cravings. Rufus Wainwright, 2001. I have no
  recollection of writing this poem but that’s a good thing. It’s often the way,
  when you’ve been writing songs and stories and scripts for 30 years. After a
  while you think “Did I write that?’” With diary entries, you can visualise a
  place and time. Poems exist in the fourth dimension. They’re a bridge between
  the subconscious and waking life. Half-asleep genius. Chocolate Milk is an
  outlier in my poetry shoebox. It’s not like the other poems. Most of them tend
  to be quite angsty. Anyone who knows anything about my well-documented
  childhood might appreciate that I have a lifetime of processing to do. This
  verse is an ode to hanging out by yourself. It’s about people watching and
  inner monologues and the gorgeousness and magic of flavoured milk. Big M,
  Nippy’s, Frosty Boy thickshakes – they were my jam. In 1998 there was a
  novelty brand called Gary. The labelling had “Shake Gary well” and “Open Gary
  other end”. The kids at Hellyer College thought it was funny. I used to think
  it was a Tasmania-only thing but I was looking back through one of my old
  Juice magazines and noticed a full-page ad for Gary. It resembles a scene from
  the music video for Blur’s Coffee and TV. I stopped drinking chocolate milk
  when I moved to non-dairy in 2015. Chocolate Milk is dedicated to Paul’s Just
  Natural Chocolate, Honey &amp; Malt. I really like this piece as it’s playful
  and random, like me. I can see myself sitting there, wherever I was at the
  time. Australian Poetry Month runs throughout August and includes festivals,
  events, workshops and a commissioned poem of the day brought to you by Red
  Room Poetry. Find out more here
