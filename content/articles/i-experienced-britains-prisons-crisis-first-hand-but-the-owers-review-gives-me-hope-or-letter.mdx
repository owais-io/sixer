  Anne Owers’ damning review of the prison capacity crisis should serve as a
  watershed moment for criminal justice policy in this country (Prison system
  was days from collapse three times under Sunak, review finds, 5 August). As
  someone who spent time in prison in 2017, and having now worked for a prison
  charity for four years, I have witnessed first-hand the “permacrisis” she
  describes. The review contains many revelations as to the state of the system.
  The worst in my eyes is the testimony of prison staff who said that, rather
  than “developing relationships with prisoners to help them progress … they
  were in the office, checking and re-checking release dates”. This perfectly
  sums up the problem: when capacity pressures force us to treat people as mere
  numbers to be shuffled around the system, we abandon any pretence of
  rehabilitation. But the review shows there is hope. The 90% reduction in youth
  custody over two decades proves that community-based prevention works. The
  youth justice system’s multi-agency approach, involving health, education,
  social services and families, has achieved what our adult system cannot:
  actually reducing offending. Prison reform campaigners are often accused of
  being “soft on crime”. But there is nothing soft about wanting a system that
  actually works – one that makes communities safer rather than simply
  warehousing problems. The current system fails victims, fails offenders, and
  fails taxpayers. Dame Anne has given us a roadmap out of this crisis. The
  question is whether our political leaders have the courage to follow it. James
