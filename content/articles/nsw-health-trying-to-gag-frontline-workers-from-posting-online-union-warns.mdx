  The doctors’ union is warning a New South Wales Health social media policy
  being drafted will gag frontline health workers speaking up publicly for
  patient care in Australia, as the government agency insists it is an update to
  an existing policy. According to the “final draft” document, social media
  subject to the rules includes “internal communication tools” such as Microsoft
  Teams, and instant messaging software applications including WhatsApp, as well
  as social media networking sites and forums for discussion. NSW Health’s
  social media guidelines, published on their website, includes an FAQ which
  states “there is no such thing as ‘private’ social media … remember that any
  content you believe to be confidential can be copied or recorded and posted by
  someone else”. The final draft document states “staff should report any
  concerns about their own use of social media or that of a colleague, to their
  manager”. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Under the principles for personal
  use of social media, it instructs that staff must not “engage in any activity
  that may adversely affect … public trust in their employing agency”. The union
  has seen a growing number of cases where NSW Health is “using internal
  policies to intimidate, silence or discipline medical staff who speak out
  publicly”, Dr Nicholas Spooner, the president of the NSW branch of the
  Australian Salaried Medical Officers Federation, said. “The latest staff
  communications policy is a clear attempt to gag frontline voices.” The state’s
  psychiatrists threatened to resign in December and the public doctors’ strike
  in April saw many workers take to social media to speak out about workforce
  issues compromising patient care in Australia. Asmof councillor Dr Ian Korbell
  said the health ministry wants frontline workers to be compliant employees who
  do their job and do not have any role in advocacy “but doctors actually have a
  responsibility to advocate for their patients”. “As a psychiatrist, I advocate
  for change in the mental health sector, which, in my view, in New South Wales
  is underperforming at a really poor level, and I think the only way for those
  changes to happen is actually to … put this to the people, because the people
  are the only thing that changes politicians’ minds. “The idea that advocacy
  for improvements in the system is a bad thing, but putting up with an
  inadequate service is a good thing, seems ill-informed.” Korbell said the
  inclusion of internal messaging as part of the policy was “Orwellian” with
  frontline healthcare workers needing to be able to debrief and let off steam.
  NSW Health states its core values are collaboration, openness, respect and
  empowerment but “the problem is that the actual culture isn’t like that”,
  Korbell said. A NSW Health spokesperson said the agency was updating its
  existing social media guidance for staff in line with the “use of social media
  in a private capacity” guidance published by the Office of the Public Service
  Commission in March. The agency said it was consulting with NSW Health staff,
  health agencies and unions on this new draft, which is “yet to be finalised
  and published”. “NSW Health is committed to fostering an environment of
  respect and inclusivity, and support the responsible and respectful use of
  social media,” a spokesperson said. “This includes the right of all
  individuals to express their views, support causes or engage in public
  discussions, including advocating in relation to their roles and health
  services,” the spokesperson said. The document encourages staff “to raise
  concerns or complaints through internal channels rather than social media”. Dr
  Fahad Khan, a junior doctor speaking as an Asmof delegate for the
  south-western Sydney local health district, said issues of working conditions
  have been raised internally for years and the strike was taken for the first
  time since 1998 because none of the existing channels had worked. Khan said
  the policy also seems aimed at stifling the many healthcare workers who have
  been vocal on social media about the humanitarian situation in Gaza.
  Separately, the peak body for general practitioners has expressed concern
  about the growing number of GPs who have reported being subjected to frivolous
  or vexatious complaints to the health regulator about social media posts
  opposing Israel’s war in Gaza. Khan said the draft policy being proposed by
  NSW Health “sounds very different to the current policy” with “extra focus on
  protecting the reputation of the governmental organisation.” Khan and Korbell
  both highlighted that frontline healthcare workers are often needing to speak
  out to correct misinformation put out by the government. Khan gave as an
  example as when, during the strike, the government had to acknowledge the
  claim that chemotherapy appointments had been cancelled was incorrect after
  doctors challenged them. Dr Anthony Brown, the chief executive of Health
  Consumers NSW, said the public need to know about the safety of public
  services in order to be able to know they can trust those services as well as
  for the accountability of how their tax dollars are being spent. “We need to
  know that they’re effective, and they’re safe places to go.”
