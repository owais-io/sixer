  A rare first edition of JRR Tolkien’s The Hobbit that was found during a house
  clearance has sold at auction for £43,000. Bought by a private collector in
  the UK, the book is one of 1,500 original copies of the seminal fantasy novel
  that were published in 1937. Of those, only “a few hundred are believed to
  still remain”, according to the auction house Auctioneum, which discovered the
  novel without a dust cover on a bookcase at a home in Bristol. Bidders from
  around the world drove the price up by more than four times what the auction
  house expected. Caitlin Riley, Auctioneum’s rare books specialist, said: “It’s
  a wonderful result for a very special book.” Riley added: “Nobody knew it was
  there. It was just a run-of-the-mill bookcase. It was clearly an early Hobbit
  at first glance, so I just pulled it out and began to flick through it, never
  expecting it to be a true first edition.” The copy is bound in light green
  cloth and features black-and-white illustrations by Tolkien, who created his
  Middle-earth universe while a professor at the University of Oxford. The book
  was passed down in the family library of Hubert Priestley, a botanist
  connected to the university and the brother of the Antarctic explorer and
  geologist, Sir Raymond Edward Priestley. It is likely the men knew each other,
  according to Auctioneum, which said Priestley and Tolkien shared mutual
  correspondence with his fellow author CS Lewis, who was also at Oxford. The
  Hobbit, which was followed by The Lord of the Rings, has sold more than 100m
  copies and was adapted into a film trilogy in the 2010s. A first edition of
  The Hobbit with a handwritten note by Tolkien in Elvish, a family of fictional
  languages, sold for £137,000 at Sotheby’s in 2015.
