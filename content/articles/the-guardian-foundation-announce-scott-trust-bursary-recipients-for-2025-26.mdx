  Esmat Jeraj, Interim executive director, The Guardian Foundation, said: “I am
  delighted to congratulate and welcome Claudia, George, Miatta, Rosie, Joe and
  Leyla as this year’s bursary cohort. Their talent, drive and perspectives
  embody the very spirit of the scheme. For decades, the Scott Trust Bursary has
  championed underrepresented voices and helped open doors that too often remain
  closed, with alumni now thriving in newsrooms around the world. I have every
  confidence this year’s recipients will build on that legacy, inspiring and
  strengthening journalism in the years to come.” For the last 37 years, the
  bursary scheme has assisted 146 students from backgrounds underrepresented in
  the media, offering funding and experience at a level unmatched by any other
  UK journalism scholarship. To date, 70% of Scott Trust Bursary alumni still
  work in journalism. In 2023, the Foundation added three new bursaries reserved
  specifically for Black aspiring journalists in the UK. These are funded by the
  Scott Trust and form part of a decade-long programme of restorative justice in
  response to independent research into the Guardian’s historical connections to
  transatlantic slavery. The findings identified links between John Edward
  Taylor and the associates who funded the Manchester Guardian’s creation, and
  slavery. The Scott Trust Bursary is a key part of The Guardian Foundation’s
  work to facilitate voice and agency with those who face barriers entering
  careers in journalism. It offers tuition fees, living expenses, mentoring and
  work placements at the Guardian. Many recipients have gone on to successful
  careers in the industry, working for news outlets such as the Guardian, BBC,
  New York Times, Financial Times and the Daily Mirror. The scheme’s alumni
  include Gary Younge, Randeep Ramesh, Samira Ahmed, Tariq Panja, Simon Murphy,
  Pippa Crerar, Lanre Bakare and more. The application process for the 2026-27
  Scott Trust Bursary will commence early next year. You can read more about the
