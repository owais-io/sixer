  As a general rule, it is almost always best to sleep on things before making
  important decisions or reacting to provocations. So why, at close to midnight
  on Tuesday, did Newcastle rush out a seemingly kneejerk response to Alexander
  Isak’s incendiary Instagram post claiming that, amid broken promises, his
  relationship with the club was over? In a statement reflecting an appreciably
  tougher tone than at any time during this summer saga, Newcastle insisted no
  promises had been broken and that their intention is to keep Isak. The message
  was that the Sweden striker’s attempt to force a move to Liverpool had failed
  and he would need to end his one-man strike before being welcomed back to
  first-team training. The only problem is that while you can lead a horse to
  water it sometimes really is impossible to make them drink. Even if – and
  right now it looks a pretty big if – Isak stops training alone and agrees to
  rejoin Newcastle’s first-team fold, how can Eddie Howe ever trust him again?
  Howe’s high-intensity, hard‑pressing approach is extremely demanding and, if
  Isak is anything less than fully engaged, he will prove detrimental to the
  team. Yes, Isak is supremely gifted, but the standard in the Premier League
  and Champions League is so high that even he is not capable of drifting
  through games and scoring goals out of nothing. Howe has already acknowledged
  that Isak’s behaviour in skipping Newcastle’s pre-season tour of south-east
  Asia disrupted dressing‑room morale. Does he really want a player, however
  talented, polluting behind‑the‑scenes atmosphere with his grievances? Given
  Newcastle fans have taken to chanting about “one greedy bastard”, maintaining
  his personal security in the face of intense supporter anger may not be
  exactly straightforward, either. Moreover, Isak knows that with every poor
  performance the price tag around his neck will drop. Given that Liverpool have
  shown no indication of pursuing alternative strikers, they could end up
  playing a slightly longer game and waiting until Newcastle are desperate to
  offload their No 14 in January. In reality it will be a major surprise if this
  saga endures that long. Indeed a careful reading of Newcastle’s statement
  conveys a hint that maybe it is part of a haggling manoeuvre as the club’s
  Saudi Arabian owners aim to extract the maximum possible price from their
  Anfield counterparts. As the former Newcastle and Liverpool manager Rafael
  Benítez used to say: “All football is a lie.” In their statement on Tuesday
  night Newcastle said: “We have been clear that the conditions for a sale this
  summer have not transpired. We do not foresee these conditions being met.” The
  conditions in question refer to the need for Newcastle to sign two strikers to
  not merely replace Isak but also Callum Wilson, who is now at West Ham. There
  is a theory that Isak’s withering social media outburst reflected his
  frustration at the club’s unwillingness to pay Brentford’s £50m-£60m asking
  fee for Yoane Wissa to fill at least one of those slots. In an uncanny
  parallel, Wissa has also absented himself from first-team involvement at his
  club as he attempts to seal a longed‑for move to St James’ Park. The
  ostensibly weird thing about the proposed Wissa deal is that the Saudis want
  £150m for Isak but have offered Brentford £40m for the DR Congo forward.
  Statistics can be deceptive but in this case they seem pretty compelling. Last
  season Wissa scored 19 goals in 35 Premier League appearances. Significantly,
  none were penalties. Isak, meanwhile, scored 23 times in 34 league appearances
  for a much stronger side. Four of his goals were also penalties. There is a
  reasonable case for claiming that Isak’s all-round game is superior to
  Wissa’s, but Brentford watchers demur, making the point that Wissa is also a
  pretty useful attacking threat from wide on the left. The big difference is
  that Wissa is three years older than Isak. Perhaps more importantly, while
  three years remain on Isak’s contract with Newcastle, there is only one year
  left on Wissa’s with Brentford. Newcastle’s £40m offer for Wissa, made on
  Wednesday afternoon, was swiftly rejected by Brentford but the hope of the
  club’s Saudi owners will be that a deal will eventually be done. They also
  know that keeping Isak for another year could prove rather pointless given
  that he is clearly not committed to Howe’s cause and next summer’s price for a
  then 26-year-old with two years left on his contract is going to be nowhere
  near £150m. Despite appearances to the contrary, the prospect of such a
  dwindling profit margin means it is still eminently possible to envisage Isak
  waking up as a Liverpool player on 2 September. Similarly, Jørgen Strand
  Larsen or Gonçalo Ramos could join Wissa on Tyneside by the time the transfer
  window has shut. And should that all transpire, what’s for sure is that
  Newcastle’s dressing room would be an infinitely healthier, happier place.
