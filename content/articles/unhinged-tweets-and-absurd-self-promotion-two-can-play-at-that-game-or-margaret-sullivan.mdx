  Just when you thought Donald Trump was parody-proof, Gavin Newsom comes along
  to prove you wrong. Unhinged all-caps tweets with nonsensical punctuation?
  Insulting nicknames for political enemies? Self-promotional merchandise for
  sale? This will all sound familiar unless you have been living in a bubble for
  the past decade. But if the description conjures an orange-toned Republican in
  a golf cart – a wannabe dictator in a red tie down to his hefty thighs – your
  system needs an update. Because it turns out that Trump is not the only one
  who can play that game. The California governor has spent the last few weeks
  mercilessly trolling Trump and his Maga followers by flipping the script. His
  press office is blasting out long, illogical social media posts, depicting
  Newsom as a muscular Adonis ready to save the world and suggesting his image
  should be carved in stone on Mount Rushmore or grace the cover of Time
  magazine wearing a crown and a grin. It’s been a master class in flipping the
  script – and maybe in political gamesmanship, too. With his social media
  profile soaring and political coffers filling up, these moves could even help
  Newsom gain access to the very White House that Trump has tackily transformed
  into a miniature Mar-a-Lago. Newsom’s counterpunching has earned the approval
  of everyone from the former president Barack Obama to Steve Bannon, the
  disreputable architect of some of Trump’s worst moves. “He’s no Trump but …
  he’s at least getting up there,” Bannon told Politico. “He looks like the only
  person in the Democratic party who is organizing a fight that they feel they
  can win.” Obama endorsed the more serious side of what Newsom is up to –
  praising as “smart, measured, responsible” the governor’s plan to counter the
  recent Republican gerrymandering of Texas congressional districts with a
  redistricting measure in California to benefit Democrats. But Newsom’s
  newfound prominence isn’t pleasing everyone. The pro-Trump commenters on Fox
  News are disapproving, as if they haven’t spent a decade cheering the same
  techniques. Sean Hannity, the network’s chief Trump whisperer, trashed the
  trolling as a “performative confrontational style” that only works with “the
  loony radical base”. If that sounds familiar, so did the all-caps response
  from Newsom’s press office: “FOX HATES THAT I AM AMERICA’S FAVORITE GOVERNOR
  (‘RATINGS KING’) SAVING AMERICA – WHILE TRUMP CAN’T EVEN CONQUER THE ‘BIG’
  STAIRS ON AIR FORCE ONE ANY MORE!!! … FOX IS LOSING IT BECAUSE WHEN I TYPE,
  AMERICA NOW WINS!!! THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER.” And Trump
  himself is clearly triggered. Weeks ago, he suggested Newsom should be
  arrested. More recently he dusted off an old nickname: “Newscum”. But here,
  too, Newsom’s team punched back, posting a simple diss – three snowflake
  emojis. The script-switching is clever, and often downright funny; the humor
  is effective partly because Newsom’s real-life persona stands in stark
  contrast to Trump’s. Newsom is the California pretty boy – he looks like he
  eats only kale and quinoa, with an occasional helping of asparagus. His
  politics are progressive, if not sharply defined, and he is married to a woman
  of career accomplishment, Jennifer Siebel Newsom. She’s a documentary
  film-maker and actor, who (cover your ears, woke-fearing Magaworld!) has
  updated the role of first lady with a more gender neutral title: “First
  Partner.” The Democrats’ old aspiration, expressed by Michelle Obama, was
  “when they go low, we go high”. Too often that has translated into passivity
  and ineptitude. But since the low-high approach has failed – the Democrats are
  powerless on the national level – Newsom’s moves are energizing. It’s too bad,
  of course, that insults and absurd memes have become the American way. But at
  least Newsom, and his social media team, are awfully good at it. As for where
  it all leads, maybe the answer is nowhere. Newsom’s counterpunch may be just
  another distraction as the nation falls into authoritarianism right before our
  eyes. The historian and author Garrett Graff wrote this week in his Doomsday
  Scenario newsletter that we’re already there: “The United States, just months
  before its 250th birthday as the world’s leading democracy, has tipped over
  the edge into authoritarianism and fascism … faster than I imagined possible.”
  Can strong leadership and a decisive, blue-wave vote in 2026’s midterms and
  2028’s presidential election yank America back up? If so, radical change is
  necessary. Newsom’s approach – if combined with a strong, clear message of
  economic populism – could be a part of that. It could end up being not just
  funny but crucially important. Given where things stand, it’s worth a try.
