  August is peak flying time, and airports are on many minds. The government has
  signalled its support for colossal expansions, whose extra flights would bust
  its carbon pledges. The excuse is that supertechnology will magic away the
  extra CO2 pumped into the atmosphere, though it must know that clean, green
  flying is still futurology. Here’s the pity of it: until now this government
  has rightly boasted of its green credentials, making massive investments in
  sustainable energy and retro-insulating cold homes. Expanding air travel is
  not on any green agenda. Heathrow has just submitted proposals for a £50bn
  third runway, as approved by Labour in 2009 and the Tories who voted it
  through parliament in 2018. Covid applied the brakes but now Heathrow is back
  with gold-plated, “shovel-ready” plans. Its owners, including Qatar, Singapore
  and Saudi Arabia, expect the planning bill to prevent newts or judicial
  reviews blocking the runway. Their pitch to an investment-hungry government is
  that expanding Europe’s busiest airport would create 100,000 new jobs,
  propelling growth with 750 extra daily flights. Flying gets a green light from
  the transport secretary, Heidi Alexander: she agreed to double the size of
  Luton airport, favours Gatwick’s second runway for 100,000 more flights and
  gives Stansted’s expansion a fair wind. These allow a 70% increase in flights
  above 2018 levels, and cancel out all the carbon savings from the government’s
  clean power plan. Rachel Reeves promised to be “Britain’s first green
  chancellor”, but her plans live or die on growth, so billions in private
  investment is hard to resist. But beyond construction, the growth-potential
  claims for extra flights look highly dubious. The promised global
  “connectivity” imagines business people zipping into Britain with briefcases
  full of contracts. But that’s not who these extra flyers will be. Most will be
  frequent flyers flying more frequently, not for business but for leisure,
  according to the New Economics Foundation and Possible, the climate campaign.
  National Travel and Civil Aviation Authority passenger surveys show only one
  in 14 UK passengers are business travellers. The pandemic showed that meeting
  online saves money and time; business travel has already peaked. Would extra
  flights bring in tourist income? No, 70% of flights are British tourists off
  abroad to spend vastly more than foreigners spend here. Of extra flights in 20
  years, 83% were taken by already frequent flyers, mostly for leisure. Growth
  will not be from more families taking an annual holiday: half the population
  doesn’t fly in any year, while just 15% consume 70% of flights. Nearly a third
  are “ultra-frequent flyers” taking six or more journeys a year. Instead of
  these heaviest users paying more for their pollution, airlines reward frequent
  flyers. The Flying Fair report from the New Economics Foundation suggests
  imposing a high levy on those flying six or more times a year, not added to
  ticket prices but raised in tax returns. That makes the cost of their
  excessive air travel highly visible, and could raise £6bn a year, while
  cutting aviation CO2 by 28%. Newly nationalised trains would gain from
  disincentivising flight. But UK prices are a bizarre deterrent. I’m planning
  to go to Edinburgh next week – a train journey I love. Checking prices, I
  found a £29.99 flight each way, while LNER costs £181.69 return. France has
  banned domestic flights where trains can do the journey in less than two and a
  half hours and so should we: start by banning airlines charging less than
  rail. Switch the 39m domestic journeys being made annually by plane to train.
  The good news is the extra potential capacity in the Channel tunnel, which
  could be realised with a little investment. Twelve trains an hour run each
  way, but the tunnel could run 2.5 times more, and prices would fall. That’s
  where investment should go, instead of to airports, as new European routes
  open up. Yes, it takes longer. It means adding train time to the concept of a
  holiday. But if it were cheaper, what luxury it would be compared with the
  hell of holiday airports and flights that don’t land you in city centres.
  Climate damage is the real cost of avoidable flying. The chancellor says:
  “Expansion must be delivered in line with UK’s legal, environmental and
  climate obligations.” But the Climate Change Committee (CCC), the government’s
  statutory adviser, warns that airport expansion would breach UK carbon budgets
  for net zero emissions by 2050. The aviation industry and government claim
  that wonder technology will deliver carbon-free flying with electric planes,
  sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) and carbon capture. None is anywhere near
  available, says the CCC, which expects 17% SAFs by 2040. It advises no extra
  flying before 2030, and only 2% more by 2035, to allow time for new technology
  to be developed. Let’s hope clean flight arrives soon, but it’s not here yet:
  currently, suppliers must only guarantee that SAFs comprises 2% of the total.
  Here’s the honesty test for those claiming carbon-neutral flight is imminent:
  agree to no extra flying until it arrives. The government’s mood music is all
  pro-flying, not urging climate-conscious travel. To change habits and
  attitudes, it should start by banning frequent flyer bonuses. Why allow
  private jets? Seat for seat they are 30 times more polluting, paying less tax
  as a proportion of ticket price, as was exposed by Possible’s Jetting away
  with it report. The government’s airport policy will reveal its seriousness on
  the climate crisis. Politically, it shows whether Labour is sufficiently
  alarmed by serious threats from the left, from Greens, Liberal Democrats and
  Jeremy Corbyn revivalists pledged to invest in trains, not airports. But
  refusing airport expansion allows Tories and Faragistes to add those lost
  foreign billions to their dishonest tally of net zero costs. A YouGov poll
  found that 61% of people regard airport expansion as the wrong priority,
  alongside mayors Andy Burnham and Sadiq Khan. But the Treasury’s dilemma is
  obvious: climate or cash? Its answer should also be clear: just call a
  moratorium until green flying arrives. Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist
