  Anti-racism demonstrators turned out in large numbers on Saturday outside a
  London hotel where asylum seekers are being housed to counter-protest against
  those opposed to it being used as Home Office accommodation. Both groups of
  protesters gathered near the Thistle City Barbican hotel in Islington, north
  London. Police later said that a number of arrests had been made after
  scuffles broke out. The Metropolitan police wrote on X that officers had
  cleared a junction where counter-protesters had assembled in breach of the
  conditions in place. “There have been nine arrests so far, with seven for
  breaching Public Order Act conditions,” the force said. The police said the
  anti-hotel protest was organised by a number of people under the banner
  “Thistle Barbican needs to go – locals say no”, but it has since been endorsed
  by groups from outside the area. Online groups that have voiced support for
  the protest include Patriots of Britain and Together for the Children. One
  speaker at the anti-hotel protest, which had a turnout of about 100 people,
  claimed counter-protesters had been paid by “the Labour government and the
  trade unions” to attend. Some of those who had gathered across the road from
  the hotel wore Mega (Make England great again) hats and one man was heard
  chanting “Get these scum off our streets” towards the hotel. Directly outside
  the hotel, hundreds of people attended a counter-protest organised by Stand Up
  to Racism and supported by the former Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn, who
  is the MP for Islington North, located on the other side of the borough. They
  far outnumbered the anti-hotel protesters. Some people in the hotel could be
  seen watching the demonstration from their windows. Sarah Bailey, 63, who is
  retired, held a sign that said: “To everyone in the hotel, you are valued,
  wanted [and] welcome. She said: “I know somebody that has connections with
  this hotel. I thought it was so important, because I realised they would be
  looking out of the windows, that we send a positive sign saying you are all
  these three things. “I think it’s so important to show people that have come
  here seeking safety and protection that they are welcome and to stand up to
  those who scare and bully them.” Pat Prendergast, 21, said: “I want people to
  feel safe. I think the [anti-hotel protesters] over there are making people
  feel unsafe. I want to stand up in solidarity and say that, you know, we want
  people here.” A separate group of masked protesters, dressed in black and
  chanting “we are anti-fascist”, appeared from a sidestreet and marched towards
  the anti-hotel demonstration. Manchester was the scene of further clashes
  between rival protesters later on Saturday. Demonstrators calling for mass
  “remigration” gathered in the city centre for a march organised by the
  far-right Britain First group, which was confronted by anti-racism groups. The
  groups clashed briefly at the start of the protest before being split up
  police, according to an AFP journalist at the scene. “Send them back, don’t
  let them in – just stop them coming in, we’ve got hotels full of immigrants
  and we’ve got our own homeless people in the streets begging for food but
  nowhere to live,” said protester Brendan O’Reilly, 66. Counter-protester Judy,
  a 60-year-old retired nurse, told AFP she was there “because I don’t want to
  see people full of hate on the streets of Manchester”. She added: “Do they
  want them all to go back or is it just people with brown skin? I suspect it’s
  just people with brown skin that they want to remigrate.”
