  If you grew up using a conventional toothbrush – essentially a stick with
  bristles on the end – you may be surprised to learn just how long the electric
  toothbrush has been around. The first was designed in the late 1930s, but that
  model was a long way from the sleek, feature-packed and Bluetooth-enabled
  beasts you can buy today. There are now dozens of ultra-advanced versions on
  the market, but which ones are worth your cash? For the past two months, my
  teeth have become figurative guinea pigs to help you find the answer to that
  question. I put a bunch of electric toothbrushes from Oral-B, Philips, Suri,
  Ordo, Silk’n, Foreo and more through their paces to separate the best from the
  rest. Here are my conclusions. *** At a glance Best electric toothbrush
  overall: Spotlight Sonic Pro From £104.97 at Spotlight Oral Care Best value

  Amazon Best electric toothbrush for sustainability: Suri 2.0 £105 at Suri Best
  premium electric toothbrush: Philips Sonicare Smart 9400 £222.97 at Amazon
  Best oscillating toothbrush: Oral-B iO3 £65 at Boots *** Why you should trust
  me As well as having the physical qualities required to test electric
  toothbrushes (my own teeth and a reliable toothpaste budget), I’ve been
  testing electronics – phones, drones and everything in between – for more than
  a decade. Also – and I’ll put this delicately to prevent you from closing the
  page in justified disgust – as someone who has to wear a retainer every night
  after Invisalign treatment, the toothbrushes weren’t short of nasties to clean
  during testing. They’ve seen things, man. How I tested I doubt many people
  include the four minutes spent brushing their teeth as a highlight of even the
  most tedious day, so spare a thought for the months when it became my life’s
  obsessive focus. Fortunately, and purely by chance, this coincided with a
  dentist’s visit in which I appeared to have undergone a Damascene conversion
  to good oral hygiene, so it did have its upside. Anyway, the process was
  actually pretty simple: brush, brush and brush again, taking note of
  mouthfeel, grip, cleanliness, the features that appealed and those little
  things that made me irrationally grumpy. I used plaque-disclosing tablets,
  which turn your teeth a charming shade of pink and blue to reveal areas where
  plaque resides. Even the cheapest brushes did a good job of removing the blue,
  though, even if they didn’t feel as clean, so this test proved unhelpful.
  Ultimately, while each of the 21 brushes I tested was leagues ahead of manual
  toothbrushes, I ordered them based on performance, features, feel, stamina and
  – perhaps most importantly, given how close the final results were – value for
  money. A quick note on that: toothbrush recommended retail prices (RRPs) are
  often what you’d call “aspirational”. They’re frequently on offer, and even
  £500 models regularly go on sale for less than half price. It’s worth clicking
  through and checking what today’s price is on the off-chance. *** The best
  electric toothbrushes in 2025 *** Best electric toothbrush overall: Spotlight
  Sonic Pro £104.97 at Spotlight Oral Care From £112.50 at Amazon The Spotlight
  Sonic Pro is a great all-rounder, with excellent features and a price that
  doesn’t verge on ridiculous. Founded by two sibling dentists, Spotlight has
  only two electric toothbrushes for adults at the moment, and the Pro model
  tested here delivers on every metric that counts. Why we love it First of all,
  the Spotlight Sonic Pro performs an impressive clean. Its four modes range
  from 30,000 (gentle) to 50,000 (polish) brush strokes a minute (BPM). That
  makes it the second most powerful sonic brush I tested, and the two that
  delivered more have RRPs starting at £400. While not completely necessary for
  a healthy mouth, such speeds help provide that “fresh from the hygienist”
  feeling, even when your teeth are crying out for a thorough clean after a day
  mainlining soft drinks. It also packs a pressure sensor to make sure you’re
  not brushing too hard and potentially damaging your gums, and there are four
  lights just below the head to show how far you are into your two-minute
  brushing cycle. Flip the heads over and you’ll find a tongue cleaner, plus it
  comes with a handy travel case too. While this doesn’t charge the brush, the
  magnetic USB-C charging base is pretty compact, and a single charge can last
  up to 70 days, which is above average for an electric toothbrush. Even at the
  higher speeds I was using it at, it didn’t show any signs of slowing down
  during the testing period, so that feels accurate. If you can do without the
  pressure sensor, progress lights, tongue cleaner and polish setting, you’re
  likely to be just as happy with the non-Pro version and can save a few quid.
  It’s a shame that … modes aren’t labelled on the brush itself, even if you can
  easily feel the difference. Type: sonic Modes: four (gentle, clean, white and
  polish) Power: 50,000 BPM Pressure sensor: yes Battery life: up to 70 days
  App: no *** Best value electric toothbrush: Icy Bear Next-Generation sonic
  toothbrush £64.99 at Amazon There were three strong contenders in the £50-65
  price bracket that I was considering for the best-value pick (the £59.99 Ordo
  Sonic+ and the £50 Silk’n SonicSmile Plus were the others), but I ultimately
  chose the £65 Icy Bear because it was the only one to come with a pressure
  sensor. In fact, this was the cheapest toothbrush I reviewed that had one. Why
  we love it Oddly, the pressure sensor isn’t pitched as the main selling point,
  which is instead, rather confusingly, fingerprint recognition. This isn’t some
  kind of added dental security – it’s to prevent it from being activated in
  luggage without needing an extra case, and it works pretty well (with a
  perfectly angled edge and a lot of effort, I was able to turn it on without
  skin contact – but it’s not something you’ll do by accident). Otherwise, it
  ticks all the boxes. The top of the handle glows white when in use, and
  flashes ominously if you’re pushing too hard, and there are a generous five
  brushing modes. At its maximum power, it hits a very respectable 40,000 BPM
  for a solid clean, too. It’s a shame that … there’s no charging stand, and
  you’ll need to open up a flap on the base for USB-C charging. Type: sonic
  Modes: five (clean, whiten, polish, massage and sensitive) Power: 40,000 BPM
  Pressure sensor: yes Battery life: up to 45 days App: no *** Best electric
  toothbrush for sustainability: Suri 2.0 £105 at Suri £105 at Boots The
  original Suri toothbrush was not only solid, but also the only real choice for
  the climate-conscious in an industry that doesn’t seem to have taken much
  notice of the climate emergency. Unfortunately, it had a couple of issues that
  held it back: it lacked a pressure sensor, and the spring-pin charging system
  broke no fewer than three times on me. Both of these problems have been fixed
  in Suri 2.0, making it an easy recommendation. Why we love it In short, you no
  longer need to feel like you’re missing out by opting for a green option. The
  Suri 2.0’s slim design is lightweight and better suited for trips away than
  ever, thanks to a new travel lock and plant-based head cover. Meanwhile, its
  unreliable spring-pin charger has been replaced by a wireless version (both in
  the bundled case and stand), and its new pressure sensor vibrates three times
  and pauses the brush if you push too hard. All of this builds on what made the
  original so good: its eco-friendly credentials. The company has been working
  with ClimatePartner to offset 100% of its emissions (including transport and
  manufacturing), and it provides a postage-paid compostable bag to send the
  used heads back for recycling. These heads (three for £14.99, or cheaper on a
  subscription), incidentally, are cornstarch, with the bristles made of castor
  oil. It’s a shame that … it’s a little lacking in the power department, with
  its 33,000 BPM vibration frequency feeling noticeably less thorough than its
  rivals. Type: sonic Modes: two (clean and polish) Power: 33,000 BPM Pressure
  sensor: yes Battery life: 1+ month App: no *** Best premium electric
  toothbrush: Philips Sonicare Smart 9400 £399.99 at John Lewis £222.97 at
  Amazon If you have a toothbrush budget most people could only dream of, then
  the Philips Sonicare Smart 9400 is the one to go for. I also tested the
  DiamondClean 9900, which retails for slightly more than the Amazon price, but
  I actually slightly prefer the way this one charges. Why we love it When I
  took the Sonicare 9400 out of the box, I thought they’d packed the wrong
  charger. It turns out that the handy rinse glass included in the package is
  how it charges. You rest the charging puck underneath it, and the toothbrush
  charges through the glass when not in use. What a time to be alive. With up to
  62,000 motions a minute, it’s the joint most powerful sonic brush I tested
  (tying with the aforementioned DiamondClean 9900), and you can really feel the
  results after use. It has four modes – clean (with three intensities), deep
  clean, gum health and white – feels comfortable in the hand, and comes with a
  charging case if you don’t want to take the magical glass charger on the road.
  It also connects to a rather excellent app to track your brushing habits.
  Unlike with the DiamondClean 9900, where it’s the only way to cycle between
  modes, you don’t have to use it. But if you do, you’ll receive guidance on
  your brushing, showing the areas you’ve missed and giving you the option to
  spend a bit longer on them if needed. It can be connected with Apple Health
  for iPhone data nerds, and it’ll even automatically reorder brush heads for
  you if you want, so you’re never caught short. It’s a shame that … it misses
  out on the sensitive mode of the DiamondClean 9900, so those with tooth pain
  may want to look elsewhere. Battery life is also rather stingy, thanks to the
  Bluetooth. Type: sonic Modes: four (clean, deep clean+, gum health and white+)
  Power: 62,000 BPM Pressure sensor: yes Battery life: up to 14 days App: yes
  *** Best oscillating toothbrush: Oral-B iO3 £65 at Boots £65 at Amazon This
  oscillating toothbrush (which moves the bristles in a circular motion, rather
  than vibrating like most other brushes here – see the buying guide below for
  more information) isn’t technically the best one you can buy, as you can
  probably tell from the fact that Oral-B’s iO line goes all the way up to the
  iO10. But because they all use the same motor and brush, and thus offer
  similar performance, this is the one I recommend: it jettisons unnecessary
  extras (like a connected app and screen) in order to simply deliver the
  features you need for a great clean. Why we love it It boasts three modes –
  daily clean, sensitive and whiten – and its round heads are small enough to
  get into tight areas. Most importantly, its pressure sensor won’t only tell
  you when you’re applying too much pressure, but also when you’re applying too
  little, via an easy-to-understand white/green/red lighting system in a ring at
  the top of the handle. While it has fewer modes than the higher-numbered iOs,
  it delivers the same dentist-fresh-feeling performance, while retailing for a
  fraction of their optimistic RRPs. It’s a shame that … at £15 for two,
  replacement heads are a touch on the pricey side. And, like all the Oral-B
  brushes I tested, it made me oddly dribbly during the brushing, so stay near
  the sink. Type: oscillating Modes: three (daily clean, whitening and
  sensitive) Power: not disclosed Pressure sensor: yes Battery life: up to 18
  days App: no *** The best of the rest *** Foreo Issa 3 £44.50 at Foreo £48.95
  at Amazon Best for: sensitive teeth It may look like something more at home on
  the shelves of Ann Summers, but the Foreo Issa 3 is doing something a bit
  different, which makes it ideal for those with extra sensitive gnashers, or
  those loth to give up their manual toothbrush. The medical-grade silicone and
  PBT polymer bristles are designed for scrubbing away at your teeth like a
  traditional manual toothbrush as hard as you like, rather than purely relying
  on the sometimes overpowering buzz of the motor. The sonic vibrations are
  still present here – with 16 intensities – but they’re significantly more
  gentle than the other models, as they’re designed to be supplemented by
  traditional brushing motions. Foreo reckons that said bristles are up to
  10,000 times more hygienic than their nylon counterparts, which means the head
  needs replacing only every six months. The company also says the brush will go
  for an entire year on a single charge. Naturally, it’s been impossible to
  emulate that much use during the testing period, but it’s certainly shown no
  signs of slowing down, and given a charge takes only two hours, it won’t be a
  big hardship if it falls a little short. It didn’t make the final cut because
  … for me, it simply didn’t remove plaque as effectively in two minutes as its
  more traditional rivals, even with the added push of manual scrubbing. Type:
  sonic hybrid; modes: one (with 16 intensity levels); power: 11,000 BPM;
  pressure sensor: no; battery life: up to 365 days; app: no *** Coulax C8
  £19.99 at Amazon Best for: if money is tight I thought the cheap and cheerful
  £18.50 Superdrug ProCare model would be the most affordable model on test, but
  this bestseller from Amazon comes with a surprising number of features. For
  less than £20, you get a toothbrush with five settings, up to 40,000 BPM and
  eight(!) brush heads in the box. While my mouth didn’t feel as fresh as with
  more expensive models, bluntly, it didn’t feel like a quarter of the
  performance for a quarter of the price. It didn’t make the final cut because …
  while I had no issues with my test unit, Amazon’s AI analysis of its customer
  reviews found that “some customers report that it turns on randomly, doesn’t
  charge, and doesn’t retain any charge”. So there may be an element of getting
  what you pay for. Type: sonic; modes: five (white, clean, sensitive, polish
  and massage); power: 40,000 BPM; pressure sensor: no; battery life: up to 120
  days; app: no *** Oral-B iO9 £200 at Boots £200 at Oral-B Best for: if money
  is no object With a crazy £500+ RRP, you may wonder what kind of black magic
  the Oral-B iO9 offers your daily brush. The answer is lots, but not enough to
  justify its price, hence the inclusion here. It comes with a whopping seven
  cleaning modes (daily clean, sensitive, gum care, intense, whiten, super
  sensitive and tongue clean), a colour screen to cycle through them, and
  built-in 3D teeth tracking that can detect 16 mouth zones to indicate how your
  technique is in the connected app. It charges quickly too – just three hours
  via the magnetic charging stand or the bundled snazzy charging case and
  proprietary cable with a plug. There is a middle ground between this and the
  recommended iO3 above, with the Oral-B iO6 offering a black-and-white screen
  and a connected app, albeit with slower charging, a non-charging case, weaker
  position tracking and fewer modes. If an app is important to you, but your
  money-to-sense ratio is still intact, that’s probably the one to go for. It
  didn’t make the final cut because … at RRP, it costs half a grand! You could
  buy 25 Coulax C8s for that. Type: oscillating; modes: seven (daily clean,
  sensitive, gum care, intense, whiten, super sensitive, tongue clean); power:
  not disclosed; pressure sensor: yes; battery life: up to 14 days; app: yes ***
  Silk’n SonicYou £89 at Boots £49 at Amazon Best for: battery life Toothbrush
  battery life varies wildly because it depends on a host of factors: how often
  you brush, how long you spend doing so, and which modes you use. As such,
  plenty of people may find that manufacturers inadvertently (or, cynically,
  advertently) oversell their stamina. Still, if battery life is the be-all and
  end-all for you, you should give the Silk’n SonicYou a look. Although it is
  not as good as that of the Foreo, the manufacturer suggests you’ll get up to
  300 days’ use with it, if you use the sensitive (30,000 strokes a minute)
  setting twice a day for a total of four minutes. That’ll obviously go down
  faster if you brush more often, for longer, or use the 37,000-stroke-a-minute
  whitening mode, but given most of the brushes I was testing were rated in the
  14- to 90-day area, it’s still a stamina champion. It certainly didn’t need
  charging while I was using it. Infrequent charging can be a curse if you’re
  dealing with a bespoke charger that you can’t find when the time comes, but
  thankfully you just need to pop open the base and connect a common-or-garden
  USB-C cable to top it up. It didn’t make the final cut because … battery life
  is often directly linked to the power of the brush, and while 37,000 BPM is
  nothing to be sneezed at, you can get more power if you’re prepared to charge
  more often. Type: sonic; modes: three (sensitive, clean and white); power:
  37,000 BPM; Pressure sensor: no; battery life: up to 300 days; app: no ***
  Whites Beaconsfield sonic LED toothbrush £49.99 at Superdrug £49.99 at Amazon
  Best for: whitening While many toothbrushes (including this one) have a
  built-in whitening setting that adds time or alternates speeds to remove
  surface stains, the Whites Beaconsfield sonic LED toothbrush – with its
  terrifying picture of a toothy strawberry on the box – goes the extra mile by
  including blue light whitening technology. The company says this can whiten
  teeth by an average of 2.5 shades in three days. A week’s use did indeed
  appear to make my teeth appear slightly lighter in before-and-after shots,
  although you shouldn’t expect miracles. All the same, combining this with
  whitening toothpaste and other products could really make a difference in the
  long run. It didn’t make the final cut because … other toothbrushes offer a
  cleaner-feeling mouth. And that blue light makes for a shorter, two-week
  battery life. Type: sonic modes: four (clean, white, polish and gum care);
  power: 39,600 RPM (vibration frequency); pressure sensor: no; battery life: 15
  days; app: no *** Philips One Rechargeable toothbrush From £29.99 at Philips
  Battery toothbrush £29.99 at Superdrug From £19.29 at Amazon Best for: travel
  While most electric toothbrushes include a travel case for hygiene (and to
  prevent them from buzzing in your bag), you might not want to take an
  expensive electric toothbrush with you everywhere – especially if it has its
  own bespoke charger. The Philips One is cheap, cheerful and compact, and it
  will last for 90 days with a single AAA battery. For a tenner more, you can
  get a version with a built-in battery that’s chargeable via USB-C, but you’ll
  get only 30 days out of that. It didn’t make the final cut because … 13,000
  movements a minute is fine for a few days’ travelling, but you’ll want more
  power for day-to-day brushing. Type: sonic; modes: one; power: 13,000 BPM;
  pressure sensor: no; battery life: up to 90 days (AAA) or 30 days (USB); app:
  no *** What you need to know *** Are electric toothbrushes better than manual
  ones? Generally speaking, yes. Without them, “it’s harder to get the same
  result”, says Caitlin Miller, head of hygiene and therapy at Bupa Dental Care
  UK. “To get the same level of cleaning found with an electric toothbrush,
  you’d have to spend a lot longer than two minutes brushing with a manual.” The
  reasons are threefold, she explains: manual dexterity, people are more likely
  to use their expensive electric device properly and sheer power. “You don’t
  have to really do anything with it, and it does a better job,” Miller says.
  “That’s not to say that they suit everybody. There are people who can do a
  perfectly good job with a manual toothbrush, but for most of my patients, I
  will see improvements when people go on to an electric toothbrush.” How do you
  use an electric toothbrush? “You want to hold your toothbrush at a 45-degree
  angle – half on the gum, half on the tooth. You should just be holding it
  horizontally, sweeping across the tooth and gum margins,” says Miller, adding
  that you should move slowly, allocating a couple of seconds for each tooth.
  “You don’t move it up and down, you don’t need to move it round and round.
  That’s the beauty of the electric toothbrush: you can be pretty lazy with it
  and it still does a good job.” But a common mistake is to press too hard,
  which is why some of the brushes in our guide come with pressure sensors –
  something actively recommended by Miller. “If you’ve got too much pressure,
  you’re essentially dampening the vibrations and bristles.” How often do you
  need to charge an electric toothbrush? This varies hugely between
  toothbrushes, and depends on how often you brush and the settings you use. The
  only certainty is that you need to charge them more often than a manual
  toothbrush – which is to say “at all”. According to Miller, plenty of patients
  fall back on inferior manual brushing because of this. “The number of people
  who say, ‘Oh, I do have an electric toothbrush, but I always forget to charge
  it, and then it takes three days, so I just use my manual toothbrush,’” she
  laments. “Keeping it charged is quite important.” The good news is that
  batteries now tend to be lithium-ion, meaning they charge quickly, and they
  last a decent amount of time, too. The ones I tested had manufacturer-quoted
  battery lives of between 14 and 365 days, which is an enormous gulf. Plenty of
  factors play into this, including power, connectivity and the size of the
  battery itself, but it’s also worth bearing in mind how this is measured.
  Generally, a manufacturer counts a day as four minutes of brushing over two
  sessions, but it might be more or less, so read the small print. You may
  instinctively be drawn to brushes with longer battery ratings, but convenience
  is also a factor. A proprietary charger might be more of a faff than a USB-C
  one, or a charging dock that sits neatly on the sink, especially if months go
  between charges and you forget where your cable lives. You may also want to
  charge more often than required. Anecdotally, I can easily feel the difference
  in strength between a toothbrush approaching the end of its battery and the
  same model fresh off the charger. How often do you need to replace your
  toothbrush head? As for replacing the heads, Miller suggests you do this every
  three months – or earlier if it looks splayed or frayed because its cleaning
  performance will suffer. “You can see it under a microscope: it gets really
  worn on top.” Beyond an electric toothbrush, Miller stresses the importance of
  cleaning between the teeth, and she has a clear order of preference:
  interdental brushes, then floss and finally water flossers. “If I’ve got
  patients who won’t use anything often, if I can get them on a water flosser,
  then that’s better than nothing,” she says. The different types of electric
  toothbrush: oscillating v sonic toothbrushes There are two main types of
  toothbrushes on the market: oscillating and sonic – with the latter seemingly
  dominating at the moment. “They work differently, but they’re both doing a
  similar sort of thing,” says Miller. In short, an oscillating toothbrush moves
  the bristles back and forth in a circular motion, while sonic brushes use
  vibrations to move the bristles in two directions to loosen plaque. The latter
  is measured in brush strokes per minute (BPM) and my selection was rated
  between 11,000 and 62,000 BPM. Miller says some of her clients find the sonic
  brushes a bit “ticklish” at first, but this is something you can get used to
  over time. Which is better? A systematic review and meta-analysis of 38
  comparison studies published in the International Journal of Dental Hygiene
  found a “small but clinically relevant advantage” for oscillating brushes. But
  it added that it’s “unlikely that dental care professionals in routine
  examination would be able to detect [the] small differences” between the two,
  meaning that personal preference should ultimately rule supreme. *** Alan

If you grew up using a conventional toothbrush – essentially a stick with bristles on the end – you may be surprised to learn just how long the electric toothbrush has been around. The first was designed in the late 1930s, but that model was a long way from the sleek, feature-packed and Bluetooth-enabled beasts you can buy today. There are now dozens of ultra-advanced versions on the market, but which ones are worth your cash? For the past two months, my teeth have become figurative guinea pigs to help you find the answer to that question. I put a bunch of electric toothbrushes from Oral-B, Philips, Suri, Ordo, Silk’n, Foreo and more through their paces to separate the best from the rest. Here are my conclusions. *** At a glance Best electric toothbrush overall: Spotlight Sonic Pro From £104.97 at Spotlight Oral Care Best value electric toothbrush: Icy Bear Next-Generation sonic toothbrush £64.99 at Amazon Best electric toothbrush for sustainability: Suri 2.0 £105 at Suri Best premium electric toothbrush: Philips Sonicare Smart 9400 £222.97 at Amazon Best oscillating toothbrush: Oral-B iO3 £65 at Boots *** Why you should trust me As well as having the physical qualities required to test electric toothbrushes (my own teeth and a reliable toothpaste budget), I’ve been testing electronics – phones, drones and everything in between – for more than a decade. Also – and I’ll put this delicately to prevent you from closing the page in justified disgust – as someone who has to wear a retainer every night after Invisalign treatment, the toothbrushes weren’t short of nasties to clean during testing. They’ve seen things, man. How I tested I doubt many people include the four minutes spent brushing their teeth as a highlight of even the most tedious day, so spare a thought for the months when it became my life’s obsessive focus. Fortunately, and purely by chance, this coincided with a dentist’s visit in which I appeared to have undergone a Damascene conversion to good oral hygiene, so it did have its upside. Anyway, the process was actually pretty simple: brush, brush and brush again, taking note of mouthfeel, grip, cleanliness, the features that appealed and those little things that made me irrationally grumpy. I used plaque-disclosing tablets, which turn your teeth a charming shade of pink and blue to reveal areas where plaque resides. Even the cheapest brushes did a good job of removing the blue, though, even if they didn’t feel as clean, so this test proved unhelpful. Ultimately, while each of the 21 brushes I tested was leagues ahead of manual toothbrushes, I ordered them based on performance, features, feel, stamina and – perhaps most importantly, given how close the final results were – value for money. A quick note on that: toothbrush recommended retail prices (RRPs) are often what you’d call “aspirational”. They’re frequently on offer, and even £500 models regularly go on sale for less than half price. It’s worth clicking through and checking what today’s price is on the off-chance. *** The best electric toothbrushes in 2025 *** Best electric toothbrush overall: Spotlight Sonic Pro £104.97 at Spotlight Oral Care From £112.50 at Amazon The Spotlight Sonic Pro is a great all-rounder, with excellent features and a price that doesn’t verge on ridiculous. Founded by two sibling dentists, Spotlight has only two electric toothbrushes for adults at the moment, and the Pro model tested here delivers on every metric that counts. Why we love it First of all, the Spotlight Sonic Pro performs an impressive clean. Its four modes range from 30,000 (gentle) to 50,000 (polish) brush strokes a minute (BPM). That makes it the second most powerful sonic brush I tested, and the two that delivered more have RRPs starting at £400. While not completely necessary for a healthy mouth, such speeds help provide that “fresh from the hygienist” feeling, even when your teeth are crying out for a thorough clean after a day mainlining soft drinks. It also packs a pressure sensor to make sure you’re not brushing too hard and potentially damaging your gums, and there are four lights just below the head to show how far you are into your two-minute brushing cycle. Flip the heads over and you’ll find a tongue cleaner, plus it comes with a handy travel case too. While this doesn’t charge the brush, the magnetic USB-C charging base is pretty compact, and a single charge can last up to 70 days, which is above average for an electric toothbrush. Even at the higher speeds I was using it at, it didn’t show any signs of slowing down during the testing period, so that feels accurate. If you can do without the pressure sensor, progress lights, tongue cleaner and polish setting, you’re likely to be just as happy with the non-Pro version and can save a few quid. It’s a shame that … modes aren’t labelled on the brush itself, even if you can easily feel the difference. Type: sonic Modes: four (gentle, clean, white and polish) Power: 50,000 BPM Pressure sensor: yes Battery life: up to 70 days App: no *** Best value electric toothbrush: Icy Bear Next-Generation sonic toothbrush £64.99 at Amazon There were three strong contenders in the £50-65 price bracket that I was considering for the best-value pick (the £59.99 Ordo Sonic+ and the £50 Silk’n SonicSmile Plus were the others), but I ultimately chose the £65 Icy Bear because it was the only one to come with a pressure sensor. In fact, this was the cheapest toothbrush I reviewed that had one. Why we love it Oddly, the pressure sensor isn’t pitched as the main selling point, which is instead, rather confusingly, fingerprint recognition. This isn’t some kind of added dental security – it’s to prevent it from being activated in luggage without needing an extra case, and it works pretty well (with a perfectly angled edge and a lot of effort, I was able to turn it on without skin contact – but it’s not something you’ll do by accident). Otherwise, it ticks all the boxes. The top of the handle glows white when in use, and flashes ominously if you’re pushing too hard, and there are a generous five brushing modes. At its maximum power, it hits a very respectable 40,000 BPM for a solid clean, too. It’s a shame that … there’s no charging stand, and you’ll need to open up a flap on the base for USB-C charging. Type: sonic Modes: five (clean, whiten, polish, massage and sensitive) Power: 40,000 BPM Pressure sensor: yes Battery life: up to 45 days App: no *** Best electric toothbrush for sustainability: Suri 2.0 £105 at Suri £105 at Boots The original Suri toothbrush was not only solid, but also the only real choice for the climate-conscious in an industry that doesn’t seem to have taken much notice of the climate emergency. Unfortunately, it had a couple of issues that held it back: it lacked a pressure sensor, and the spring-pin charging system broke no fewer than three times on me. Both of these problems have been fixed in Suri 2.0, making it an easy recommendation. Why we love it In short, you no longer need to feel like you’re missing out by opting for a green option. The Suri 2.0’s slim design is lightweight and better suited for trips away than ever, thanks to a new travel lock and plant-based head cover. Meanwhile, its unreliable spring-pin charger has been replaced by a wireless version (both in the bundled case and stand), and its new pressure sensor vibrates three times and pauses the brush if you push too hard. All of this builds on what made the original so good: its eco-friendly credentials. The company has been working with ClimatePartner to offset 100% of its emissions (including transport and manufacturing), and it provides a postage-paid compostable bag to send the used heads back for recycling. These heads (three for £14.99, or cheaper on a subscription), incidentally, are cornstarch, with the bristles made of castor oil. It’s a shame that … it’s a little lacking in the power department, with its 33,000 BPM vibration frequency feeling noticeably less thorough than its rivals. Type: sonic Modes: two (clean and polish) Power: 33,000 BPM Pressure sensor: yes Battery life: 1+ month App: no *** Best premium electric toothbrush: Philips Sonicare Smart 9400 £399.99 at John Lewis £222.97 at Amazon If you have a toothbrush budget most people could only dream of, then the Philips Sonicare Smart 9400 is the one to go for. I also tested the DiamondClean 9900, which retails for slightly more than the Amazon price, but I actually slightly prefer the way this one charges. Why we love it When I took the Sonicare 9400 out of the box, I thought they’d packed the wrong charger. It turns out that the handy rinse glass included in the package is how it charges. You rest the charging puck underneath it, and the toothbrush charges through the glass when not in use. What a time to be alive. With up to 62,000 motions a minute, it’s the joint most powerful sonic brush I tested (tying with the aforementioned DiamondClean 9900), and you can really feel the results after use. It has four modes – clean (with three intensities), deep clean, gum health and white – feels comfortable in the hand, and comes with a charging case if you don’t want to take the magical glass charger on the road. It also connects to a rather excellent app to track your brushing habits. Unlike with the DiamondClean 9900, where it’s the only way to cycle between modes, you don’t have to use it. But if you do, you’ll receive guidance on your brushing, showing the areas you’ve missed and giving you the option to spend a bit longer on them if needed. It can be connected with Apple Health for iPhone data nerds, and it’ll even automatically reorder brush heads for you if you want, so you’re never caught short. It’s a shame that … it misses out on the sensitive mode of the DiamondClean 9900, so those with tooth pain may want to look elsewhere. Battery life is also rather stingy, thanks to the Bluetooth. Type: sonic Modes: four (clean, deep clean+, gum health and white+) Power: 62,000 BPM Pressure sensor: yes Battery life: up to 14 days App: yes *** Best oscillating toothbrush: Oral-B iO3 £65 at Boots £65 at Amazon This oscillating toothbrush (which moves the bristles in a circular motion, rather than vibrating like most other brushes here – see the buying guide below for more information) isn’t technically the best one you can buy, as you can probably tell from the fact that Oral-B’s iO line goes all the way up to the iO10. But because they all use the same motor and brush, and thus offer similar performance, this is the one I recommend: it jettisons unnecessary extras (like a connected app and screen) in order to simply deliver the features you need for a great clean. Why we love it It boasts three modes – daily clean, sensitive and whiten – and its round heads are small enough to get into tight areas. Most importantly, its pressure sensor won’t only tell you when you’re applying too much pressure, but also when you’re applying too little, via an easy-to-understand white/green/red lighting system in a ring at the top of the handle. While it has fewer modes than the higher-numbered iOs, it delivers the same dentist-fresh-feeling performance, while retailing for a fraction of their optimistic RRPs. It’s a shame that … at £15 for two, replacement heads are a touch on the pricey side. And, like all the Oral-B brushes I tested, it made me oddly dribbly during the brushing, so stay near the sink. Type: oscillating Modes: three (daily clean, whitening and sensitive) Power: not disclosed Pressure sensor: yes Battery life: up to 18 days App: no *** The best of the rest *** Foreo Issa 3 £44.50 at Foreo £48.95 at Amazon Best for: sensitive teeth It may look like something more at home on the shelves of Ann Summers, but the Foreo Issa 3 is doing something a bit different, which makes it ideal for those with extra sensitive gnashers, or those loth to give up their manual toothbrush. The medical-grade silicone and PBT polymer bristles are designed for scrubbing away at your teeth like a traditional manual toothbrush as hard as you like, rather than purely relying on the sometimes overpowering buzz of the motor. The sonic vibrations are still present here – with 16 intensities – but they’re significantly more gentle than the other models, as they’re designed to be supplemented by traditional brushing motions. Foreo reckons that said bristles are up to 10,000 times more hygienic than their nylon counterparts, which means the head needs replacing only every six months. The company also says the brush will go for an entire year on a single charge. Naturally, it’s been impossible to emulate that much use during the testing period, but it’s certainly shown no signs of slowing down, and given a charge takes only two hours, it won’t be a big hardship if it falls a little short. It didn’t make the final cut because … for me, it simply didn’t remove plaque as effectively in two minutes as its more traditional rivals, even with the added push of manual scrubbing. Type: sonic hybrid; modes: one (with 16 intensity levels); power: 11,000 BPM; pressure sensor: no; battery life: up to 365 days; app: no *** Coulax C8 £19.99 at Amazon Best for: if money is tight I thought the cheap and cheerful £18.50 Superdrug ProCare model would be the most affordable model on test, but this bestseller from Amazon comes with a surprising number of features. For less than £20, you get a toothbrush with five settings, up to 40,000 BPM and eight(!) brush heads in the box. While my mouth didn’t feel as fresh as with more expensive models, bluntly, it didn’t feel like a quarter of the performance for a quarter of the price. It didn’t make the final cut because … while I had no issues with my test unit, Amazon’s AI analysis of its customer reviews found that “some customers report that it turns on randomly, doesn’t charge, and doesn’t retain any charge”. So there may be an element of getting what you pay for. Type: sonic; modes: five (white, clean, sensitive, polish and massage); power: 40,000 BPM; pressure sensor: no; battery life: up to 120 days; app: no *** Oral-B iO9 £200 at Boots £200 at Oral-B Best for: if money is no object With a crazy £500+ RRP, you may wonder what kind of black magic the Oral-B iO9 offers your daily brush. The answer is lots, but not enough to justify its price, hence the inclusion here. It comes with a whopping seven cleaning modes (daily clean, sensitive, gum care, intense, whiten, super sensitive and tongue clean), a colour screen to cycle through them, and built-in 3D teeth tracking that can detect 16 mouth zones to indicate how your technique is in the connected app. It charges quickly too – just three hours via the magnetic charging stand or the bundled snazzy charging case and proprietary cable with a plug. There is a middle ground between this and the recommended iO3 above, with the Oral-B iO6 offering a black-and-white screen and a connected app, albeit with slower charging, a non-charging case, weaker position tracking and fewer modes. If an app is important to you, but your money-to-sense ratio is still intact, that’s probably the one to go for. It didn’t make the final cut because … at RRP, it costs half a grand! You could buy 25 Coulax C8s for that. Type: oscillating; modes: seven (daily clean, sensitive, gum care, intense, whiten, super sensitive, tongue clean); power: not disclosed; pressure sensor: yes; battery life: up to 14 days; app: yes *** Silk’n SonicYou £89 at Boots £49 at Amazon Best for: battery life Toothbrush battery life varies wildly because it depends on a host of factors: how often you brush, how long you spend doing so, and which modes you use. As such, plenty of people may find that manufacturers inadvertently (or, cynically, advertently) oversell their stamina. Still, if battery life is the be-all and end-all for you, you should give the Silk’n SonicYou a look. Although it is not as good as that of the Foreo, the manufacturer suggests you’ll get up to 300 days’ use with it, if you use the sensitive (30,000 strokes a minute) setting twice a day for a total of four minutes. That’ll obviously go down faster if you brush more often, for longer, or use the 37,000-stroke-a-minute whitening mode, but given most of the brushes I was testing were rated in the 14- to 90-day area, it’s still a stamina champion. It certainly didn’t need charging while I was using it. Infrequent charging can be a curse if you’re dealing with a bespoke charger that you can’t find when the time comes, but thankfully you just need to pop open the base and connect a common-or-garden USB-C cable to top it up. It didn’t make the final cut because … battery life is often directly linked to the power of the brush, and while 37,000 BPM is nothing to be sneezed at, you can get more power if you’re prepared to charge more often. Type: sonic; modes: three (sensitive, clean and white); power: 37,000 BPM; Pressure sensor: no; battery life: up to 300 days; app: no *** Whites Beaconsfield sonic LED toothbrush £49.99 at Superdrug £49.99 at Amazon Best for: whitening While many toothbrushes (including this one) have a built-in whitening setting that adds time or alternates speeds to remove surface stains, the Whites Beaconsfield sonic LED toothbrush – with its terrifying picture of a toothy strawberry on the box – goes the extra mile by including blue light whitening technology. The company says this can whiten teeth by an average of 2.5 shades in three days. A week’s use did indeed appear to make my teeth appear slightly lighter in before-and-after shots, although you shouldn’t expect miracles. All the same, combining this with whitening toothpaste and other products could really make a difference in the long run. It didn’t make the final cut because … other toothbrushes offer a cleaner-feeling mouth. And that blue light makes for a shorter, two-week battery life. Type: sonic modes: four (clean, white, polish and gum care); power: 39,600 RPM (vibration frequency); pressure sensor: no; battery life: 15 days; app: no *** Philips One Rechargeable toothbrush From £29.99 at Philips Battery toothbrush £29.99 at Superdrug From £19.29 at Amazon Best for: travel While most electric toothbrushes include a travel case for hygiene (and to prevent them from buzzing in your bag), you might not want to take an expensive electric toothbrush with you everywhere – especially if it has its own bespoke charger. The Philips One is cheap, cheerful and compact, and it will last for 90 days with a single AAA battery. For a tenner more, you can get a version with a built-in battery that’s chargeable via USB-C, but you’ll get only 30 days out of that. It didn’t make the final cut because … 13,000 movements a minute is fine for a few days’ travelling, but you’ll want more power for day-to-day brushing. Type: sonic; modes: one; power: 13,000 BPM; pressure sensor: no; battery life: up to 90 days (AAA) or 30 days (USB); app: no *** What you need to know *** Are electric toothbrushes better than manual ones? Generally speaking, yes. Without them, “it’s harder to get the same result”, says Caitlin Miller, head of hygiene and therapy at Bupa Dental Care UK. “To get the same level of cleaning found with an electric toothbrush, you’d have to spend a lot longer than two minutes brushing with a manual.” The reasons are threefold, she explains: manual dexterity, people are more likely to use their expensive electric device properly and sheer power. “You don’t have to really do anything with it, and it does a better job,” Miller says. “That’s not to say that they suit everybody. There are people who can do a perfectly good job with a manual toothbrush, but for most of my patients, I will see improvements when people go on to an electric toothbrush.” How do you use an electric toothbrush? “You want to hold your toothbrush at a 45-degree angle – half on the gum, half on the tooth. You should just be holding it horizontally, sweeping across the tooth and gum margins,” says Miller, adding that you should move slowly, allocating a couple of seconds for each tooth. “You don’t move it up and down, you don’t need to move it round and round. That’s the beauty of the electric toothbrush: you can be pretty lazy with it and it still does a good job.” But a common mistake is to press too hard, which is why some of the brushes in our guide come with pressure sensors – something actively recommended by Miller. “If you’ve got too much pressure, you’re essentially dampening the vibrations and bristles.” How often do you need to charge an electric toothbrush? This varies hugely between toothbrushes, and depends on how often you brush and the settings you use. The only certainty is that you need to charge them more often than a manual toothbrush – which is to say “at all”. According to Miller, plenty of patients fall back on inferior manual brushing because of this. “The number of people who say, ‘Oh, I do have an electric toothbrush, but I always forget to charge it, and then it takes three days, so I just use my manual toothbrush,’” she laments. “Keeping it charged is quite important.” The good news is that batteries now tend to be lithium-ion, meaning they charge quickly, and they last a decent amount of time, too. The ones I tested had manufacturer-quoted battery lives of between 14 and 365 days, which is an enormous gulf. Plenty of factors play into this, including power, connectivity and the size of the battery itself, but it’s also worth bearing in mind how this is measured. Generally, a manufacturer counts a day as four minutes of brushing over two sessions, but it might be more or less, so read the small print. You may instinctively be drawn to brushes with longer battery ratings, but convenience is also a factor. A proprietary charger might be more of a faff than a USB-C one, or a charging dock that sits neatly on the sink, especially if months go between charges and you forget where your cable lives. You may also want to charge more often than required. Anecdotally, I can easily feel the difference in strength between a toothbrush approaching the end of its battery and the same model fresh off the charger. How often do you need to replace your toothbrush head? As for replacing the heads, Miller suggests you do this every three months – or earlier if it looks splayed or frayed because its cleaning performance will suffer. “You can see it under a microscope: it gets really worn on top.” Beyond an electric toothbrush, Miller stresses the importance of cleaning between the teeth, and she has a clear order of preference: interdental brushes, then floss and finally water flossers. “If I’ve got patients who won’t use anything often, if I can get them on a water flosser, then that’s better than nothing,” she says. The different types of electric toothbrush: oscillating v sonic toothbrushes There are two main types of toothbrushes on the market: oscillating and sonic – with the latter seemingly dominating at the moment. “They work differently, but they’re both doing a similar sort of thing,” says Miller. In short, an oscillating toothbrush moves the bristles back and forth in a circular motion, while sonic brushes use vibrations to move the bristles in two directions to loosen plaque. The latter is measured in brush strokes per minute (BPM) and my selection was rated between 11,000 and 62,000 BPM. Miller says some of her clients find the sonic brushes a bit “ticklish” at first, but this is something you can get used to over time. Which is better? A systematic review and meta-analysis of 38 comparison studies published in the International Journal of Dental Hygiene found a “small but clinically relevant advantage” for oscillating brushes. But it added that it’s “unlikely that dental care professionals in routine examination would be able to detect [the] small differences” between the two, meaning that personal preference should ultimately rule supreme. *** Alan Martin is a writer who has been putting products – including phones, gaming devices and wearables – through their paces for more than a decade.
