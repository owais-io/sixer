  Keely Hogkinson admits she is excited and relieved to be putting 375 days of
  tears, frustration and injuries behind her when she races for the first time
  since winning the Olympic 800m gold medal on Saturday. The 23-year-old
  acknowledges that she does not have much time to get her sharpness back before
  next month’s World Championships in Tokyo. But she struck an optimistic note
  on the eve of the Diamond League meeting in Silesia, Poland, as she readied
  herself to race again. “It’s been a long time – over a year since Paris,” she
  said. “It wasn’t my plan to start this late. But I am just super happy to get
  back on the start line. I’ve missed it a lot. This is what I train to do. So I
  can’t wait to get out there and give it my absolute best and let’s see what
  happens.” Hodgkinson has been battling hamstring issues, which flared shortly
  after the Olympics and then returned on the eve of the Keely Klassic in
  February, where she had been intending to break the world indoor 800m record.
  She had hoped to return for last month’s London Diamond League, but had to
  wait until she was 100% ready again. “It’s been upsetting at times,” she said.
  “Missing London was hardest for me because I just wanted to be there in front
  of my home crowd. Yes, it has been frustrating but it makes the good times
  sweeter and it makes it even better to be here now.” The plan is test her
  fitness in Poland against a decent field that includes Oratile Nowe of
  Botswana, who posted the season’s best time of 1:57.49, as well as Gabriela
  Gajanova, the Slovakian who finished runner-up to Hodgkinson in the 2024
  European Championships. If all goes well, she will run again four days later
  at the Diamond League in Lausanne. “I’ve come out ready to go, so I am just
  excited to put something together. It’s been a frustrating year. Back in June
  I was not able to do anything and coming off the back of winning the Olympics
  last year it was not ideal at all that I just couldn’t get on the start line.
  “Tomorrow is just a stepping stone on the way to Tokyo,” she added. “And I’m
  looking forward to getting out there and just being competitive again.”
