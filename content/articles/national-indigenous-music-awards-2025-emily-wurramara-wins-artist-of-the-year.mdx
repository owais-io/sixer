  Emily Wurramara expressed solidarity with the people of Palestine and “all
  Indigenous peoples around the world” experiencing oppression as she accepted
  the artist of the year award at the 21st National Indigenous Music awards at
  the Nimas in Garramilla/Darwin on Saturday night. “There’s nothing like coming
  back home and being here and playing for mob and playing for the people,” the
  Garramilla-born Warnindhilyagwa singer said. “Because the music is about the
  people. The music is freedom. Free Palestine, free Congo and free all
  Indigenous peoples around the world from their oppressors. It always was,
  always will be Indigenous land.” Speaking to Guardian Australia after the
  ceremony, Wurramara said: “I’ve been very vocal about it online … advocating
  for [Palestinians] and Indigenous people all across the world - it’s our
  fight.” Wurramara also picked up film clip of the year for Lordy Lordy, shot
  on Larrakia country, directed by Claudia Sangiorgi Dalimore and featuring the
  Northern Territory’s Red Flag Dancers and members of Wurramara’s family. Lordy
  Lordy was written during Australia’s voice to parliament referendum. “This
  song is a reminder that our people always have a voice, and always will,” the
  singer said. Malyangapa Barkindji rapper Barkaa, who won artist of the year at
  the 2024 Nimas, won album of the year for Big Tidda, her second EP, edging out
  fellow nominees Wurramara, 3%, King Stingray and Yolŋu funk outfit Andrew
  Gurruwiwi Band. The singer told Guardian the EP is “for my tiddas - it’s for
  my sisters, it’s for the black matriarchy, it’s for black women. It’s a
  dedication to my mother, to my daughter, to my nieces, to my big sisters”.
  “The Nimas are such a special night, because it’s celebrating Black unity;
  celebrating all our brothers and sisters and countrymen from across this
  country, and just being able to come together. And you know, when one of us
  wins, we all win.” Andrew Gurruwiwi Band, hailing from Yirrkala in north-east
  Arnhem Land, won best new talent and song of the year for their
  reggae-inflected protest song Once Upon A Time, addressing colonisation, the
  frontier wars and the Yolŋu fight for land rights. For the second year in a
  row, the community clip of the year, recognising young talent, was awarded to
  Bulman school and community in the NT, for their video Crocodile Style, in
  which local kids rap in English and Dalabon about the story of Korlomomo
  (crocodile) and Berrerdberred (rainbow bee eater) and how humans came to have
  fire. Jessica Mauboy, the Garramilla/Darwin-born, Kuku Yalanji and Wakaman
  singer and actor, was inducted into the Nimas hall of fame as part of this
  year’s ceremony, joining the likes of Warumpi Band’s Sammy Butcher, Yothu
  Yindi and the late Gurrumul. The award recognises Mauboy’s success as a
  recording artist and her impact on Australian music. From her breakthrough on
  Australian Idol in 2006, she has blazed a trail with six Top 10 albums, 16 Top
  20 singles – including chart-topping hits Burn and Little Things – and 31 Aria
  nominations. Last week she launched her new single, While I Got Time,
  co-written with PJ Harding – the first release on her independent imprint
  Jamally, following her exit from Warner Music Australia. Mauboy took to the
  stage to perform the new song, joining a lineup that included Barkaa, country
  star Troy Cassar-Daley, Donovan, psych-rockers Velvet Trip, gospel and blues
  vocalist Kankawa Nagarra, Eleanor Jawurlngali &amp; Mick Turner, and best new
  talent nominees Miss Kaninna and Drifting Clouds. Reflecting on her 21-year
  career, Mauboy said: “From humble beginnings in Darwin to the international
  stages, music has been my voice, my escape and my connection to the people all
  over the world. “This hall of fame induction is not just about my
  achievements, but also about the message that I can send to young dreamers
  everywhere. I want every aspiring artist to know that their dreams are valid
  and attainable. No voice is too small, and every story is worth telling.”
