  Mary Burgess should take inspiration from previous letter campaigns in her
  search for ways of storing seven years’ of Feast magazines (Letters, 15
  August). She could create microdots of the magazines and store them in a 35mm
  film canister, which would fit neatly in a spice rack. Or she could make her
  favourite recipes into one or more handy wallcharts. Janet Fraser Twickenham,
  London • Might the king’s portrait have had more takers if it had shown him
  not as a Ruritanian monarch but more in character as a gardener (Over 46,000
  public bodies spurned offer of free King Charles portrait, 13 August)? In the
  age of Trump, we are lucky to have him and Keir Starmer, even though their
  earnest character is out of sync with social media. Jenny Tillyard Seaford,
  East Sussex • Your report (UK rights watchdog warns against ‘heavy-handed’
  policing of Gaza protests, 15 August) says: “The Home Office said the issues
  the EHRC had raised were an operational matter for the police. The Met
  referred the query to the Home Office.” Franz Kafka is alive, well and running
  the country. John Lowery London • “Did you enjoy the holiday?” I asked my
  middle son after a wet camping trip to Wales. “What holiday?” he replied. I
  asked then which part he had enjoyed most and he said “the launderette in
  Beaumaris” (Letters, 15 August). Alison Leighton Stony Stratford,
  Buckinghamshire • In Saturday’s paper there was a correction of a mistake in
  “The most Guardian crossword ever”. Of course there was. Peter Reid Plymouth •
