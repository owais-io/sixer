  The US office of special counsel, an independent federal agency, confirmed to
  NBC News on Saturday that it is investigating former Department of Justice
  prosecutor Jack Smith for possible violations of the Hatch Act. Smith led
  investigations into Donald Trump’s part in January 6 US Capitol riot and
  alleged mishandling of classified documents. The confirmation of an
  investigation comes after Arkansas senator Tom Cotton, a Republican, requested
  last week that Smith, 56, be investigated for “unprecedented interference in
  the 2024 election”. The Hatch Act, a federal law passed in 1939, limits
  certain political activities of federal employees. Trump, along with other
  prominent Republican lawmakers, has argued that Smith’s investigations into
  Trump amounted to illegal political activity. Smith was appointed as special
  counsel by then attorney general Merrick Garland in 2022 – three days after
  Trump announced his bid for a second term – to investigate potential
  interference with the 2020 election and the handling of classified documents.
  However, the US office of special counsel, the federal agency investigating
  Smith, is different from the type of justice department-appointed special
  counsel position that was held by Smith. As an independent federal agency, it
  lacks the power to bring criminal charges, but can instead seek disciplinary
  action for a federal government employee or refer its findings to the justice
  department for investigation. In a series of social media posts on Wednesday,
  Cotton said that Smith’s legal actions “were nothing more than a tool for the
  Biden and Harris campaigns. This isn’t just unethical, it is very likely
  illegal campaign activity from a public office.” Cotton said Smith “pushed for
  an out-of-the-ordinary, rushed trial for President Trump, with jury selection
  to begin just two weeks before the Iowa caucuses. No other case of this
  magnitude and complexity would come to trial this quickly.” Smith ultimately
  brought two criminal indictments against Trump in 2023 but resigned in January
  this year before either came to trial. His resignation came soon after the
  justice department asked a federal appeals court to reverse a judge’s order,
  blocking the release of his investigative report focused on Trump’s alleged
  efforts to undo the 2020 presidential election. A second Smith-authored
  report, into Trump’s handling of classified documents, was also blocked from
  publication.
