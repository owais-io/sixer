  Doctors have raised the alarm about high levels of vaping among children
  worldwide, saying they are convinced e-cigarettes are causing irreversible
  harm to their health. Cardiologists, researchers and health experts said they
  were “extremely concerned” about the harmful effects of e-cigarettes on
  millions of teenagers and young people, including exposure to toxins and
  carcinogens – some of which are still unknown. Nicotine levels in e-cigarettes
  can be very high, raising the risk of addiction and injury to the developing
  brains of adolescents. Children are also risking long-term cardiovascular
  effects as a result of vaping at school and college, experts say. Speaking at
  the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) annual congress in Madrid, the
  world’s largest heart conference, Prof Maja-Lisa Løchen, a senior cardiologist
  at the University hospital of North Norway, said she was concerned that
  millions of children could face ill health in future. She said: “I worry that
  vaping may be causing irreversible harm to children’s brains and hearts. Of
  course we have to wait for long-term data, but I am concerned. It increases
  your blood pressure, your heart rate, and we know that the arteries become
  more stiff.” Vaping stresses children’s cardiovascular systems, Løchen said.
  Their heart rate rises and their blood vessels constrict, which can stiffen
  arteries in the heart over time. Repeatedly vaping can lead to high blood
  pressure, which in turn increases the risk of developing an irregular heart
  rhythm, stroke and even a heart attack. Løchen cited a study published last
  year in the New England Journal of Medicine that suggested vaping increases
  the risk of stroke by almost a third (32%). When e-cigarettes heat liquids to
  higher temperatures, they can also release larger amounts of harmful chemicals
  that can flow into the lungs, enter the bloodstream and seep into the heart.
  The liquids in e-cigarettes can release known carcinogens such as formaldehyde
  and acetaldehyde when heated, research suggests. These and other chemicals can
  damage blood vessels, drive inflammation and contribute to cardiovascular
  disease risk. “There is an additional risk of vaping in children [compared
  with adults] when it comes to effects on the body,” Løchen said. “Because we
  know that the nicotine and other elements in e-cigarettes have a very harmful
  effect on developing brains. Not only in the foetus, but during childhood and
  into your 20s. So that is something we are extremely concerned about.” When
  children quit vaping, some experience nicotine withdrawal that can increase
  heart rate and blood pressure, Løchen told reporters after she gave a
  presentation on e-cigarettes in Madrid. “We also know that when children and
  young people start vaping, they may become dependent on the nicotine and it
  can become a gateway to smoking. I’m very worried – and convinced – that
  children and adolescents that are starting to vape now are at increased risk
  of irreversible harm to their health.” Also speaking in Madrid, Prof Susanna
  Price, a consultant cardiologist at Royal Brompton hospital in London and the
  chair of the ESC advocacy committee, said: “We are seeing an increase in
  children vaping but what we don’t yet know is what that translates to in
  long-term cardiovascular risk because they haven’t been around long enough. “I
  think there is a push to suggest that vaping is safe but we don’t know that.
  It’s my concern that we’re going to replace one highly addictive substance
  with another one that may have a similar profile with respect to
  cardiovascular risk.” Dr Charmaine Griffiths, the chief executive of the
  British Heart Foundation, said: “Vaping is not risk-free and no child or
  teenager should be picking up an e-cigarette.” She said governments must take
  action to tackle concerning levels of youth vaping. “Making vaping less
  appealing to young people and creating a smoke-free generation cannot come a
  moment too soon.” Data on the long-term health effects is limited because
  vapes are relatively new and evolving. It could be years before further
  effects become apparent. In the meantime, Løchen is in favour of a global ban
  on sales of e-cigarettes. “I think based on what we know now about the
  detrimental and harmful effects of e-cigarettes, I think there should be a ban
  on sales of e-cigarettes worldwide,” she said. “There have been around for 15,
  20 years now, we have the data. We know they are not harmless.”
