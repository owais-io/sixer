  Angela Rayner has acknowledged for the first time that she had not paid enough
  stamp duty when she bought an £800,000 flat in Hove earlier this summer. But
  how was the mistake made, and what does it mean for her political future? We
  look at six questions that remain outstanding regarding the deputy prime
  minister’s finances and position in the cabinet. Why did she not pay enough
  tax on her Hove flat? When she bought the £800,000 property in May, she paid
  the standard rate of stamp duty, estimated to be £30,000, rather than the
  higher rate for second homes, which would have been as much as £70,000. She
  says the reason she did so was that she had in January put her stake in her
  constituency home in Greater Manchester into a trust, with her children as the
  beneficiaries. Because she had then removed her name from the deed of the
  house, she was advised that she no longer counted as the owner of the property
  and therefore could classify the Hove flat as her only dwelling. Tax experts
  say, however, that stamp duty law is more complicated than that. If the terms
  of the trust were such that she or her children could live in the Greater
  Manchester property for the rest of their lives, it still would be likely to
  count as her main home for tax reasons. Where is Rayner’s main home?
  Ashton-under-Lyne. The deputy prime minister counts her constituency home as
  her primary property for council tax reasons. It is where her children live
  and it is where she lives when she is in the constituency. She said in her
  statement: “It remains my family home, as it has been for over a decade. It
  contains the majority of my possessions and it is where I am registered for
  most official and financial purposes ranging from credit cards to the dentist
  to the electoral roll. But most importantly, it is where my children live and
  have gone to school and now college, and where I regularly live while caring
  for them.” Rayner has another property she spends time in too – a
  grace-and-favour apartment in Admiralty House on Whitehall. She neither owns
  this nor pays council tax on it. This is one reason some have accused Rayner
  of hypocrisy. For almost everything, Rayner counts the Ashton home as her main
  property. For stamp duty reasons only, the Hove flat took precedence. Where
  did she get the money for the Hove flat? Rayner says she sold her stake in the
  Greater Manchester home to the trust in January 2025, which gave her the money
  to buy the Hove flat, which she owns with a mortgage. The trust was set up in
  2020 using a payment that was granted after a “deeply personal and distressing
  incident involving my son as a premature baby”. A spokesperson confirmed on
  Wednesday that the cash used to buy the Hove flat originally came from that
  payout. The trust now holds equity in the Ashton house instead. What are her
  family arrangements? Rayner has two sons with her ex-husband, Mark, and one
  from an earlier relationship when she was 16. She and Mark divorced in 2023
  and the two decided to “nest” – moving in and out of the house in turn while
  their children remained in it. At that point, the pair put the house partly in
  the trust, with them and the law firm Shoosmiths as trustees. In January,
  Rayner says, she sold her remaining part of the Ashton house to the trust,
  removing her name from the deeds in the process. In May, she used the money to
  buy the Hove flat, where she spent part of her summer holiday. Why did she not
  say more about this before? Rayner says she was under a court order not to
  divulge details of the trust and so felt unable to go into detail about her
  personal finance arrangements. The deputy prime minister said she was released
  from that order on Tuesday night, prompting the full statement on Wednesday.
  What does her political future look like now? Rayner has previously had a
  turbulent relationship with the prime minister, Keir Starmer, who once tried
  to sack her during a reshuffle while in opposition. More recently the pair
  have become much closer and Starmer gave his deputy his full backing in an
  interview this week. “Angela is an incredible person [and] deputy prime
  minister,” he told BBC Radio 5 Live. But he has a reputation for ruthlessness,
  especially if he feels he has not been told the full truth about a minister’s
  circumstances. The Conservatives are likely to be in full cry after the
  revelations about her tax arrangements, not least because Labour is gearing up
  to increase property taxes in the budget. Rayner’s future now depends on
  whether Starmer decides he can withstand such an onslaught.
