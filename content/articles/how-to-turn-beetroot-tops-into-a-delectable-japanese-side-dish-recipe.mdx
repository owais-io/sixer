  The ohitashi method is such an elegant way to enhance the natural flavours of
  leafy greens, while also reducing food waste. This traditional Japanese
  technique involves blanching and chilling leafy greens, then steeping them in
  a simple seasoned broth that imparts a wonderful and rounded savoury umami
  flavour. Most recipes for such greens use just the leafy part, but with
  ohitashi the stems are cooked first. Beetroot leaf ohitashi Ohitashi is a
  wonderful way to prepare vegetables in advance, because the vegetables need to
  steep in a delicious broth for at least a few hours and up to five days,
  soaking up the marinade as they age. You can make ohitashi-style vegetables
  with just about any leafy greens: spinach, kale, chard, radish leaves, turnip
  tops or nettles. Cooking greens quickly, then blanching them in iced water, is
  a classic chef’s trick that helps maintain their bright colour by halting the
  cooking process and preserving the chlorophyll. I cool blanched vegetables
  very quickly using a large tray of very cold water cooled with ice blocks (to
  save on ice) and prevent a loss of nutrients (and flavour!), which can happen
  when vegetables are steeped for an extended period. Normally, to make the
  dashi/broth for ohitashi, a piece of kelp or kombu is infused in cold water
  for several hours, or brought to a boil then taken off the heat. I’ve
  suggested using other seaweed varieties such as wakame, hijiki or even seaweed
  salad mix, if you have it. And rather than discarding the seaweed, I keep it
  in the broth, which is why I’ve reduced the amount used so it isn’t
  overpowering; after all, seaweed is an acquired taste, so if you’re not used
  to it, consider removing it after steeping or using less. Alternatively
  flavour the water with miso. 2g dried kelp (kombu), or other seaweed (sea
  spaghetti, wakame, seaweed salad mix), or 1-2 tbsp miso, to taste 1-2 tbsp
  mirin, or rice-wine, white-wine or cider vinegar 1-2 tbsp light soy sauce, to
  taste 1 bunch beetroot leaves (about 250g), including the stalks, or other
  leafy greens (chard, kale, turnip tops), washed Toasted sesame seeds, to serve
  If you have some seaweed, first make a broth by pouring 120ml water into a
  glass jar or bowl, add the kombu and leave to soak for at least one hour, and
  ideally for five hours or overnight in the fridge. (If you want to speed up
  this process, bring the water and seaweed to a boil, then take off the heat
  and leave to cool). If you don’t have seaweed, stir miso to taste into 120ml
  water. Either way, once infused, add the mirin and light soy sauce to taste,
  bring to a boil, then turn off the heat. Meanwhile, bring a large pan of water
  (or steamer) to a boil and have ready a bowl of iced water. Hold the bunch of
  greens stalk down in the boiling water (or steamer), keeping the leaves out of
  the water, cook for 60-90 seconds, then gently drop in the leaves, too, and
  cook for a further 30-60 seconds, until they are vivid and bright green. Lift
  out into the ice bath to cool, then, once cold, transfer the leaves to a clean
  towel and dab to soak up any excess water. Keep the greens whole in all their
  glory or chop them into 5cm pieces for ease of eating. Lay them in a suitable
  container, cover with the broth, seal and refrigerate for at least a few hours
  and up to five days. To serve, arrange the greens on a plate, drizzle over a
  little broth and a sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds.
