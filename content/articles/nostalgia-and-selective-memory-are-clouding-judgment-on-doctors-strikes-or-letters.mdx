  I write in response to Prof David Cameron (Letters, 28 July). I also trained
  as a doctor during the 80s and early 90s and experienced the long working
  hours of that time. It is easy to fall into the trap of nostalgia and
  selective memory as we become older and detached from the frontline. I was
  looked after by the hospitals in which I worked, which were less managed than
  they are today. I worked in a close team, led by a consultant to whom I was
  responsible, and who was responsible for me. I spoke to no managers. I was
  provided accommodation, hot food day and night, and other privileges. I speak
  to many young doctors in my current workplace and see the conditions in which
  they work. They are isolated and harassed by managers, who are in turn
  harassed by a target-driven culture. Their training is politicised and diluted
  by the physician assistant programme. They cannot get hot food after 4pm or at
  weekends, they pay for parking, they are ripped off by hospital accommodation
  services and see their pay eroded by below-inflation awards over many years.
  Small wonder they are angry. Pay is the quickest way by which they can obtain
  some redress for the deterioration in working conditions which they have
  suffered. Dr Robin Hollands Consultant, Shrewsbury • As a foundation year 1
  (FY1) doctor who has nearly completed my first year of medical training, I
  have been deeply disheartened by the discourse around the resident doctor
  strikes. The British Medical Association (BMA) has failed to properly advocate
  for changes that will improve the working lives of doctors and the media has
  unsurprisingly been intensely critical of the BMA’s current objectives. It was
  exceptionally generous for the government to provide us with a 22% pay rise
  last year, but the BMA’s current demands for a further 29% are totally
  unrealistic and appear tone deaf to the many other public sector workers who
  have received much less. It is therefore not surprising that many media
  outlets have agreed that we are “greedy”. Despite this, I believe the strikes
  are a representation of a much deeper dissatisfaction with the current state
  of affairs for resident doctors and this needs to be addressed. Resident
  doctors across the country are often working extensive hours on understaffed,
  dysfunctional hospital wards, with now ever-diminishing prospects of career
  progression. The latest BMA figures that 52% of FY2 doctors have no secure
  employment from August is deeply shocking and is a failure of the system that
  may threaten the future of the NHS. It is time that both the BMA and the
  government woke up to the reality that there will be a severe doctor
  unemployment crisis unless urgent action is taken. This is the real problem
  that needs to be addressed. Pay restoration should absolutely remain a
  long-term goal, but there is little point improving my current resident doctor
  salary if there are no future pathways for resident doctors in the NHS. Dr
