  Bundee Aki has revealed his wife gave birth to their daughter in the back of a
  car in New Zealand on the same day as the first Lions Test victory against
  Australia in Brisbane. Aki is yet to meet his fifth child, Aine, and said
  reuniting with his family is his top priority after helping the Lions to wrap
  up the series. Aki was a second-half replacement in the first Test, coming off
  the bench after 57 minutes and all the while coping with the drama unfolding
  in Auckland. Aine is Aki’s fifth child – all five have names beginning with A
  – and Aki’s remarkable revelation details the sacrifices made by the touring
  side, who first got together for a training camp in Portugal in early June. “I
  want to enjoy my break, my family time,” Aki said. “I haven’t seen my family
  for eight weeks. I have a newborn child who I haven’t met yet. She was born
  when we were playing in Brisbane, so I haven’t met her. Her name is Aine, so
  I’m looking forward to going and meeting my newborn child and we’ll go from
  there. “Credit to my wife [Kayla]. She’s a powerful woman, a strong woman. I
  have to say it to her. If you only knew the story of what happened, it’s a
  funny story in itself. It was a good day. I was in the hotel. I knew we were
  overdue. The missus calls me and she’s like: ‘Water hasn’t broke but I’m going
  to the hospital, I’m feeling contractions.’ I go: ‘Yeah, fair enough.’ She
  goes to the hospital, we’re getting ready for the team meeting pre-match, and
  then she calls me and says she’s on the way to the hospital, so I said: ‘Fine,
  be safe.’ “Five minutes later, she sends a photo, her water broke. I was like:
  ‘Cool, OK, are you almost there?’ This is like 30 or 40 minutes away from the
  hospital, so I said: ‘You’ll be all right, Mum is there.’ Ten minutes later,
  she video-calls me and I was like: ‘Shit, what’s going on?’ I saw a baby on
  the video call, so she had it in the car on the way to the hospital. They’re
  both strong and healthy, so happy days. I knew it was good juju so I knew we
  were going to have a good day.” Aki went on to start the second and third
  Tests, struggling in appalling conditions on Saturday night in Sydney. After
  being part of the side that lost against South Africa four years ago, however,
  the 35-year-old was happy to settle for series success even if the targeted
  whitewash slipped by. “We’ll take the positive out of it,” he said. “We won
  the series and that’s all we got here for. We would have loved a clean sweep
  but it didn’t happen. Only so many people can say they’ve been on two tours or
  have won a series.”
