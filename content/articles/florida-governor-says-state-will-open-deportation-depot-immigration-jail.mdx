  Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, said on Thursday that the state
  will open a second immigration jail, as a federal judge weighs whether to
  close the controversial existing facility in the Everglades known as
  “Alligator Alcatraz”. DeSantis painted the forthcoming detention center at the
  shuttered Baker correctional institution in Sanderson as supplementary to the
  remote tented camp. He also said the facility would hold up to 1,300
  undocumented immigrants awaiting deportation. “We need additional capacity
  beyond what we’re already doing down in south Florida. There’s a massive part
  here at Baker that isn’t being used. [It’s] ready-made infrastructure,”
  DeSantis announced during a press conference at the disused jail 50 miles
  north of Gainesville. Baker was closed in 2021 after numerous reports of
  excessive violence and abuse of inmates by guards. The governor gave no
  timeline for its opening, but said the facility, which he said would be called
  “the deportation depot”, would be operational soon. “We’re not rushing to do
  it right this day, but they’re doing what they need to do to get it done with
  all deliberate speed,” he said. “It’s a priority for the people of this state,
  it’s a priority for the people of this country.” The development came on the
  heels of district court judge Kathleen Williams hearing final arguments in
  Miami on Wednesday in a lawsuit filed by an alliance of environmental groups
  seeking to close Alligator Alcatraz. The six-week old facility has been beset
  by allegations of “inhumane” conditions including detainees held in cages in
  excessive heat, broken toilets and air conditioning, inadequate food, and a
  claim this week that a respiratory virus was running rampant. Williams last
  week issued a two-week restraining order halting new construction at the
  Everglades detention facility, while allowing operations there to continue.
  She said she would decide whether to renew it before its 21 August expiration.
  In a statement, the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the plaintiffs
  claiming the camp was causing irreversible destruction to the ecologically
  sensitive wetlands, said it was “optimistic” that the Alligator Alcatraz
  facility would be closed while the lawsuit proceeds. “We’re feeling hopeful
  that the strong case we’ve made over the last few days will move the court to
  pump the brakes on this dangerous detention center,” said attorney Elise
  Bennett, the group’s Florida and Caribbean director. DeSantis made no mention
  of the lawsuit on Thursday, but confirmed the state’s emergency management
  department, which operates Alligator Alcatraz on behalf of the Immigration and
  Customs Enforcement agency (Ice) using a range of private contractors, was
  working in haste to have the camp at Baker opened. “We’re taking yet another
  step in supporting the important mission that President Trump was elected to
  implement, securing the border and enforcing immigration laws, and removing
  illegal aliens,” he said. DeSantis highlighted a number of other steps his
  administration had taken, including banning so-called sanctuary cities for
  undocumented immigrants and forcing state law enforcement agencies to support
  or participate in Ice actions. “We have done more on this than any other state
  by a country mile,” he said. DeSantis said he had originally looked at opening
  an immigration jail at Camp Blanding, a joint military training base west of
  Jacksonville, but his staff had concluded that Baker was a better option
  because it was a “one-stop shop” close to Lake City airport and its longer
  runway. “The reason is not to house people indefinitely; we want to process
  and return illegal aliens to their home country. That is the name of the
  game,” he said.
