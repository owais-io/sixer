  For those who find the idea of burning their deceased friend’s body
  distasteful (‘The delivery man arrived with the ashes in a gift bag’ – why are
  so many people opting out of traditional funerals?, 23 July), an alternative
  to direct cremation is a green burial, which costs more but not excessively
  so. Here, the grave is not permanent, and everything that goes in it has to be
  biodegradable – this rules out embalming. Coffins must be made of cardboard or
  untreated wood – woven willow is becoming very popular. No permanent memorial
  is allowed, but usually a wooden plaque can be added, which will last for
  several years if oiled. Natural wildflowers can often be planted, but vases
  cannot be used. Woodland burial sites often have a pavilion that can be used
  for a parting ceremony. A grave will presumably last for several years before
  being reused – long enough for friends and relatives to visit, until memory
  fades. Tim Gossling Cambridge • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the
  Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it will be considered for
