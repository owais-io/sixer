  South Carolina Republican Nancy Mace is facing criticism for posting an online
  image of a man she falsely described as a campus shooter after the state
  university issued a “credible report” alert of a shooter in the library on
  Sunday. School officials at the university of South Carolina had issued a
  warning of an active shooter at the university’s Columbia campus at around
  6.30pm, later describing the suspect as “a white male with black pants,
  approximately 6 feet tall and still in the area”. Students and faculty staff
  were advised to “evacuate the area or seek safe shelter and barricade yourself
  in a safe area as necessary until further notice. Defend yourself if you
  encounter the suspect.” Subsequent messages stated that there was no evidence
  of a threat but not before the congresswoman posted a now deleted post warning
  of a “white male”, wearing “black shorts, grey tshirt, backpack” that she
  called “the alleged shooter”, along with the picture of a man with what turned
  out be an umbrella. Mace’s wrong identification of the man with an umbrella
  brought commentary from figures from both sides of the debate over guns and
  gun safety. Fred Guttenberg, a gun control activist whose 14-year-old daughter
  was killed in the Parkland high school shooting, said: “Now would be an
  appropriate time to talk about how to appropriately punish you for this false
  post that could have gotten someone killed … everything about you and your
  messaging is the problem. Seek help as I firmly believe you are in need.” Matt
  Walsh, a rightwing commentator posted sarcastically: “Really grateful for
  Nancy Mace. She bravely alerted the public to the dangers of a guy carrying an
  umbrella.” Mace later backtracked posting: “Real, or a hoax, or a mistake, now
  would be an appropriate time to talk about hardened security at schools of all
  grades, colleges and universities. This was a terrifying experience for
  students on campus and their families. Many are confused after being told
  there was an active shooter. Some are even afraid to return.” Mace, who has a
  child at the university, later added: “As the mom of a student at USC, tonight
  was terrifying. “Frantically calling my child to see if they were at the
  library or barricaded somewhere else on campus, making sure they and their
  roommates were safe, your heart just drops to the ground, for a minute you
  can’t breathe,” Mace wrote, adding: “South Carolina first!” University
  officials confirmed to a local news outlet that “a couple of students” were
  treated by EMS for minor injuries that occurred during evacuation and there
  were no confirmed reports of shots fired. The incident points to the pervasive
  anxiety on school and college campuses. As of 25 July, there have been 33
  school shootings in the US this year, with 19 on college campuses, and 14 were
  on K-12 school grounds. The incidents left 15 people dead and at least 41
  other victims injured, according to a CNN analysis. A study last year by the
  American Psychological Association’s Journal of Threat Assessment and
  Management found that in 40% of cases of 1,000 shooter warnings in pre-K
  schools between 2018 and 2022 it was difficult to determine if the threat was
  real or a joke.
