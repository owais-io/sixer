  The sportscar maker Lotus has confirmed it will cut 550 jobs in the UK as part
  of wider restructuring plans that will deliver a fresh blow to Britain’s
  automotive industry. Lotus, which has been struggling with a drop in sales and
  cash shortages, said it was necessary to cut 42% of its 1,300-strong UK
  workforce to “secure a sustainable future”, amid uncertainty sparked by
  factors including Donald Trump’s trade war. The company, which is owned by the
  Chinese automotive group Geely, insisted that it was committed to the UK and
  would continue to manufacture vehicles at its plant in Hethel, Norfolk. The
  factory has not built any cars since mid-May, having paused production to
  manage inventories and supply chain issues caused by the US tariffs on car
  imports from countries including the UK. Trump initially slapped British-made
  cars with a 27.5% tariff, with the UK government later striking a deal that
  will see the levy cut to 10% for a maximum of 100,000 cars a year, close to
  total UK vehicle exports last year. A spokesperson for Lotus said on Thursday
  that production was due to start again in early September. “Following a review
  of Lotus Cars business objectives, in line with the current market conditions,
  the company has announced a restructuring proposal, which anticipates a
  reduction of up to 550 roles across the business in the UK,” the company said
  in a statement. “We believe this is necessary in order to secure a sustainable
  future for the company in today’s rapidly evolving automotive environment,
  which is seeing uncertainty with rapid changes in global policies including
  tariffs.” Lotus said it was looking at how it could share more resources
  across the wider group and that the restructuring plans were “vital” to
  boosting competitiveness. It added that it was “fully committed to the UK”.
  “Norfolk will remain the home of the Lotus sportscar, motorsports and
  engineering consulting operations,” Lotus said, adding that it was also
  looking at how to diversify its business, including through third-party
  manufacturing, meaning it could build cars for other brands. The announcement
  comes eight years after Geely – which also owns the London Electric Vehicle
  Company, the maker of London black cabs – took majority control of the British
  company in 2017. Lotus can trace its roots back to 1948, when it was founded
  by the car engineer Colin Chapman before gaining a reputation as a leader in
  lightweight British sportscars. Geely, which is owned by the billionaire Li
  Shufu, has stakes in a range of car companies, from the UK’s Aston Martin to
  Germany’s Mercedes-Benz and Sweden’s Volvo. In China, Geely makes vehicles
  under its own name, as well as under the Lynk &amp; Co and Zeekr brands.
