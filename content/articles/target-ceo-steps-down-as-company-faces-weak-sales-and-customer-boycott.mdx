  $The CEO of Target is stepping down, as the embattled retail giant seeks to
  turn around its fortunes amid an ongoing customer boycott over its scaling
  back of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Brian Cornell will
  be replaced next year by Michael Fiddelke, Target’s chief operating officer,
  the company said on Wednesday. Cornell helped re-energize the company when he
  became CEO in 2014, but has struggled to turn around weak sales in a more
  competitive retail landscape since the Covid pandemic. Sales at Target, which
  has almost 2,000 stores across the US, fell more than expected in the first
  quarter of 2025, and the retailer warned earlier this year that sales will
  continue to slip through the rest of the year. Target said people were scaling
  back spending over worries about the impact of tariffs and the state of the
  economy. The company also said customer boycotts affected sales. The company
  scaled back many DEI initiatives in January after they came under attack by
  conservative activists and the White House. The retreat created a backlash,
  and a poll in February found that Americans had changed their shopping habits
  and abandoned some stores in response to corporations shifting their policies
  to align with the Trump administration. The Guardian reported in July that
  many Black Americans were boycotting stores including Target and Amazon, and
  earlier this year more than 250,000 people signed a pledge to boycott Target
  after the Rev Jamal Bryant, pastor of New Birth Baptist church in Georgia,
  called for a 40-day “Target Fast” that started at the beginning of the Lenten
  season. The company had previously come under fire in 2024 after it reduced
  its collection of LGBTQ+-themed merchandise for Pride month, in response to
  rightwing criticism. Target reported a 21% drop in net income in second
  quarter of this year. Sales were down slightly and the company reported a 1.9%
  dip in comparable sales – those from established physical stores and online
  channels. The company has seen flat or declining comparable sales in eight out
  of the past 10 quarters including the latest period.
