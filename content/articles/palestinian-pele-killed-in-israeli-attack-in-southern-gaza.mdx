  A footballer known as the “Palestinian Pelé” has been killed in an Israeli
  attack in southern Gaza, according to the Palestine Football Association
  (PFA). Suleiman al-Obeid was killed on Wednesday when Israeli forces attacked
  civilians waiting for humanitarian aid, the PFA said. ‘‘During his long
  career, al-Obeid, 41, scored more than 100 goals, making him one of the
  brightest stars of Palestinian football,” it said. Born in Gaza on 24 March
  1984, Obeid began his footballing career with Khadamat al-Shati, later playing
  for Markaz Shabab al-Am’ari in the occupied West Bank, and Gaza Sport. A
  fixture in the Palestinian national side after his debut in 2007, Obeid gained
  24 caps and scored twice, the PFA said, most memorably with a scissor-kick
  against Yemen during the 2010 West Asian Football Federation championship. His
  talent on the pitch earned him the nickname of “the Palestinian Pelé” – a nod
  to the legendary Brazilian widely hailed as one of the greatest players of all
  time. His death adds to a growing toll of athletes lost in Gaza since the war
  began, with at least 662 sportspeople and their relatives reported to have
  been killed. “The number of footballers killed or who died from starvation has
  reached 421, including 103 children,” the PFA said. Obeid is survived by his
  wife and five children. According to the PFA, 288 sports facilities have been
  damaged or reduced to rubble across Gaza and the West Bank, from stadiums and
  training grounds to gyms and clubhouses. The vast majority, 268, were in Gaza,
  while 20 were in the West Bank, with about half serving football directly.
  Among the sites hit was the PFA’s headquarters in Gaza, struck during an
  Israeli air raid. More than 1,300 Palestinians are reported to have been
  killed in the vicinity of aid distribution points managed by the Gaza
  Humanitarian Foundation since the US- and Israeli-backed logistic group’s
  launch in late May.
