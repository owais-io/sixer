  It all began when Meri, a TikTok influencer from Turkey, mocked the makeup of
  Turkish women living in Germany. They were, she claimed, instantly
  recognisable by their bronzer, thick blush, false eyelashes and plumped lips.
  And the look favoured by the diaspora, she added, waspishly, had “nothing to
  do with how real Turkish women look”. Reaction from the diaspora was swift and
  stinging. “You’re just jealous because we live in Germany,” one said. “If we
  stop coming (to Turkey from Germany), your economy will collapse.” Soon a
  full-blown social media feud had erupted, with insults and mutual mockery
  flowing. And, although it started with makeup, the row has gone far deeper,
  exposing old and bitter rifts over gender, class, politics, nationalism and
  economic power. “It was soon clear a proxy war had broken out: a symbolic
  conflict actually dealing with something else, something deeper – which
  offered insights into Turkish society,” wrote the prominent Turkish German
  writer Hatice Akyün in Stern magazine. Turks make up the largest single ethnic
  minority in Germany – 1.54 million in addition to 1.4 million German citizens
  who are of Turkish descent – as well as forming the biggest Turkish diaspora.
  Most Turkish Germans trace their ancestry to the Gastarbeiter (guest worker)
  movement of the 1960s and 70s, when West Germany invited Turkish people, many
  of them from poor rural villages in Anatolia, to help fill a labour gap. Akyün
  said educated elite women in Turkish cities still tended to look down on the
  daughters and granddaughters of the guest workers. She noted that the party of
  Turkey’s authoritarian president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, had come to rely on
  Germany’s Turks as part of its base, with more than 60% of the electorate
  living in Europe’s top economy voting for AKP even as it cracks down on media
  freedom and locks up its opponents. One such dissident, Can Dündar, a Turkish
  journalist living in exile in Germany, sees the social media spat as a useful
  barometer of longstanding as well as current tensions. “It’s obvious this is
  about a lot more than style and taste – it’s an old conflict,” he said in the
  weekly newspaper Die Zeit. The guest workers who had unexpectedly stayed in
  Germany and brought their families over “don’t fit in the classic categories
  ‘German’ or ‘Turkish’. They’ve spent four generations trying to make
  themselves understood in Germany as well as in Turkey and suffer because
  they’re not really understood in either,” Dündar said. Many of the comments
  directed at the diaspora have a classist overtone: “They clean toilets and
  spend their money on makeup,” wrote one commenter denouncing the Almancı, a
  derogatory word for Turkish Germans. The journalist Ayşe Yıldız said the spat
  also had a racist component, noting that in some cases Turkish German women
  were being dismissively called ‘Afghans’or ‘Arabs’ – intended as an insult
  targeting their darker complexions highlighted by dramatic makeup. “It’s a way
  of denying their cultural identity,” she wrote in Berlin’s Tageszeitung.
  Sexism is also in the mix, Yıldız said, with crass judgments about appearance
  reflecting “internalised misogyny” in both groups and often attracting men to
  the online chats who liberally shared their views on the attractiveness of the
  women. The Turkish German writer Çiğdem Toprak said the tendency of Turkish
  Germans to opt for heavy cosmetics was a form of “resistance” against
  marginalisation, and in some cases against strong social and sexual control by
  their families. “Their makeup is a statement drawn with strong contours: I am
  here,” she said on the online platform Aposto. At the same time, said Akyün,
  liberal Turkish women felt increasingly under threat and might well envy the
  freedoms in Germany. “Growing numbers of Turks are applying for asylum in
  Germany to escape the hand of the president,” she said. In 2024, Germany
  received nearly 30,000 asylum applications from Turkey, putting it in third
  place among asylum seekers after Syria and Afghanistan, on top of the skilled
  labourers who arrived to work. Naika Foroutan, a professor for integration
  research at Berlin’s Humboldt University, said there had been a global trend
  toward “ethnisation” among younger migrants in recent years, partly driven by
  the rising far right and widening anti-Muslim sentiment. They had watched
  their parents fight to fit into German society only to feel rejected. “So they
  try another strategy: to make themselves more visible and recognisable as of
  Turkish origin, Muslim or Arab,” she told the Stuttgarter Zeitung. “Youth
  culture is now very much influenced by the desire not to be ‘Alman’ [German],”
  she said. “Instead, young people with a migration background today consciously
  present themselves as ‘foreigners’ – and do so with confidence.”
