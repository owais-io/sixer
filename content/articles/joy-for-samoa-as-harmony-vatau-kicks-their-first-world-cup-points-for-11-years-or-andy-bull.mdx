  You can keep the 92 points England scored. Let’s talk about Samoa’s three.
  It’s been 11 years since Samoa recorded a point in a World Cup match. They
  didn’t qualify for the tournaments in 2017 or 2021, and they were whitewashed
  73-0 by Australia in the first round of this one on the opening weekend. So
  Franklin’s Gardens fell awfully quiet when the team won a scrum penalty just
  inside England’s half in the 42nd minute, 32m out, and straight in front of
  the posts. Everyone knew what was at stake in that next moment, and it was a
  hell of a lot more than cutting three points off England’s lead. Their coach,
  Ramsey Tomokino, was expecting them to tap-and-go, they had prepared for it in
  the week, but on the pitch their captain, Sui Pauarasia, turned to her young
  fly half, Harmony Vatau, and said: “You got this?” instead. “She’s a pretty
  shy player,” Pauarasia said afterwards, “but she looked back at me and
  nodded.” The team were so surprised by it that no one thought to bring on a
  kicking tee, and the players had to scream at the water-carriers waiting on
  the sidelines to get it on quickly because the shot clock was already ticking.
  The ball flew straight and true, right between the uprights. The place
  erupted. In the stands, the handful of fans who had travelled around the world
  to be here started screaming and shouting in celebration, the Samoa team broke
  out dancing as they ran back to their half. “Just to see the jubilation on the
  face of Harmony and the girls was heartwarming,” Tomokino said. He really
  wanted the team to score a try, something they haven’t managed in three games
  against England across the last two and a half decades, but the looks on
  players’ faces told you that they were thrilled just to have their first
  points. Samoa had Glory. She was playing prop forward. And they had Faith. She
  was packing down at hooker. Now they had hope, too. What they didn’t have was
  any time, or money. And it takes both to play like the Red Roses do. It takes
  time and money to scrum like that, to run through the endless drills, and pay
  for the coaches, analysts, and strength and conditioning coaches who help them
  learn how to do it. It takes time and money to learn their set-piece routines,
  time and money to develop the team cohesion which underpins their intricate
  attacking patterns and defensive plays they use. It takes time and money to
  learn to kick the ball like Helena Rowland, or to throw it in the wet like
  Lucy Packer, or handle it like Jade Shekells and Megan Jones. Samoa are
  amateurs – their squad includes a property manager, a primary school teacher
  and a police officer – and the only reason they’re out there playing is for
  the love of representing their country. Most of them have to play rugby league
  if they want to make a living out of sport. There isn’t any cash in Samoan
  men’s rugby, let alone the women’s game. The governing body has been on the
  edge of bankruptcy ever since the pandemic. It has been living off its
  overdraft ever since, a situation, World Rugby argues, that is largely down to
  a serial mismanagement of distributed funds. It had to cancel the men’s
  European tour last autumn because it couldn’t afford it. There have been times
  when the Samoan women have considered themselves lucky to get paid anything at
  all. The £1,500 appearance fee paid to each of the England players in this
  match would cover what the entire Samoa squad has received in full for playing
  in some recent tournaments. A lot of them had to set up crowdfunding pages to
  help cover the shortfall in earnings they’re suffering while they are playing
  over here, so they would have enough to cover their domestic bills. More than
  once, Tomokino has had to pay operational expenses out of his own pocket. “Our
  girls have worked really hard to be here,” he said. “To walk off the bus and
  be applauded like that, we’ve never had that, we’ve never had the opportunity
  to play in front of 14,000 like we did tonight, and our girls deserve it.” He
  broke down crying as he spoke. “I know there was a worry that England’s score
  could get to triple figures, and I know people have been talking about whether
  that is good for the game or not, but I think what’s good for the game is that
  we’re here and we’re getting better.” All they want is a fair shot, just like
  the one they took to score those three points. “We’ve been longing to be part
  of a professional competition for some time,” Tomokino said. “I know if we get
  given these same opportunities we will be a far stronger team. I long for the
  day where the competition for the women is like it is for the men, the sooner
  we can get to there, the better.”
