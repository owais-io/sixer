  France will sue the Australian streaming platform Kick for alleged negligence
  after a user died during a livestream, a government minister has said. The
  platform has come under scrutiny in France after a 46-year-old Frenchman died
  earlier this month during a 12-day livestreaming marathon on his channel,
  which specialised in him enduring abuse or humiliation dished out by other
  participants. “Kick did not do everything possible to stop the broadcast of
  dangerous content,” said the digital affairs minister, Clara Chappaz, accusing
  the platform of breaking a 2004 law regulating online content. A postmortem
  found that the man, Raphael Graven, known online as Jean Pormanove or JP, was
  not killed by trauma or by someone else. In a separate announcement on
  Tuesday, the Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said France had opened an
  investigation into the platform to examine whether Kick had knowingly
  broadcast “videos of deliberate attacks on personal integrity”. Investigators
  will also look at whether the streaming platform complies with the EU Digital
  Services Act on content moderation. Offenders risk up to 10 years in prison
  and a fine of up to €1m (£864,000). Kick did not immediately respond to a
  request for comment about Tuesday’s statement from the Paris prosecutor. After
  Graven’s death, Kick Français said it would cooperate with authorities and was
  reviewing its French content. “Our priority is to protect creators and ensure
  a safer environment on Kick,” it wrote on X. “All co-streamers who
  participated in this live broadcast have been banned pending the ongoing
  investigation.” Kick is a livestreaming platform registered in Australia that
  shares revenue with its content creators.
