  At a time when Novak Djokovic could really benefit from some straightforward
  wins to ease through the early rounds of his final grand slam tournament of
  the year, nothing has come easily in New York. But under the bright lights on
  Friday night, Djokovic held off an impressive Cameron Norrie to reach the
  fourth round of the US Open with a 6-4, 6-7 (4), 6-2, 6-3 win in his best
  performance of the tournament so far. The victory makes Djokovic, 38, the
  oldest man to reach the last 16 of the US Open in 34 years – since Jimmy
  Connors in 1991. He also ties Roger Federer for the most grand slam fourth
  round appearances in history with 69 appearances. “These kind of matches and
  performances always give me hope that I can go far, challenge the best players
  in the world,” Djokovic said. Norrie faced an unenviable challenge in his
  first ever appearance inside Arthur Ashe Stadium. Djokovic may be vulnerable
  in New York given his six-week absence from the tour and some tepid form in
  his earlier matches, but the 24-time grand slam champion has proven a
  nightmare match-up for Norrie over the Briton’s career. Djokovic had won each
  of their previous six meetings, losing just two sets. For a while, Djokovic
  seemed to be strolling to an effortless early win as he broke serve early on
  and moved towards securing the opening set, but at 5-3 the Serb began to
  struggle with his movement and he repeatedly stretched out his lower back. He
  swiftly called the trainer, taking an off-court medical time out at 5-4. “In
  terms of how I’m feeling, it really goes up and down, to be honest,” Djokovic
  said. “It’s frustrating for me, honestly, that I’m not able to feel 100%
  always like I have for 20-plus years. But I guess the circumstances are quite
  different and I have to get used to the fact that every match there’s
  something that might happen, as it has been the case this year in pretty much
  every slam.” Although he returned to close out the set, continuing his
  excellent early serving form, Djokovic did not look happy. His numerous pauses
  eventually led Norrie to speak with the umpire about his time between points.
  “I don’t think it was a tactic, but I would have liked to see the umpire be a
  bit more assertive. It changed nothing for the match,” Norrie said. “Just
  three or four times I had to wait for him on my serve, and partly I think
  maybe he was kind of stretching … But it was nothing to do with Novak. I was
  just asking the umpire what’s the rule every time I have to wait for him. No,
  it was not really anything there.” Through those disruptions, Norrie tried
  hard to put the Serb under pressure. He played far more offensive tennis than
  usual and as a consequence of his courage he put together his best stretch of
  tennis against Djokovic, forcing a tie-break and performing strongly under
  pressure to level the match. Norrie’s forehand, often underpowered against the
  best players, was spectacular in the middle of the match. Faced with a genuine
  challenge, Djokovic responded solidly. His serving was supreme in the final
  sets, ending with 18 aces, and he smothered Norrie’s game with relentless
  depth while dictating play. It was a quality match from both players, allowing
  Djokovic to head into the second week hopeful that he is finding his rhythm
  and form. Norrie, meanwhile, leaves New York having continued his excellent
  form throughout this summer as he attempts to re-establish himself among the
  best players in the world. “I think always when I play these top players like
  Rafa in the past or Novak, I feel it’s like a different kind of level, playing
  against them and I always play so, so well straight after these tournaments,
  obviously you’re getting a lot of reps in,” Norrie said. “To play against
  these top guys and to see what they can bring point in and point out, it’s
  definitely a different level. So I can take a lot of confidence in this, as
  well, for sure.”
