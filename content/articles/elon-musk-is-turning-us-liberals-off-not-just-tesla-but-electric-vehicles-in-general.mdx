  US liberals have become so disgusted with Tesla since Elon Musk’s rightward
  turn that they are now not only far less likely to purchase the car brand but
  also less willing to buy any type of electric car, new research has found. The
  popularity of Tesla among liberal-minded Americans has plummeted since Musk,
  Tesla’s chief executive and the world’s richest person, allied himself with
  Donald Trump and helped propel the president to election victory last year.
  While liberals reported mostly positive intentions around buying an electric
  car in August 2023, their overall support for EVs eroded in the wake of a
  collapse in their opinion of Teslas, according to the new study, which polled
  Americans on an array of environmental actions. By the latest poll, taken in
  March as Musk was gutting the federal workforce in his role as Trump’s top
  adviser after delivering what appeared to be a Nazi salute, the intention to
  buy any EV among liberals slipped into negative territory. “The suspicion is
  that Elon Musk became so synonymous with EVs in the US that perceptions of him
  affected the entire class of vehicles,” said Alexandra Flores, a psychologist
  at Williams College and lead author of the study, published in Humanities and
  Social Sciences Communications. “This made them way less appealing to liberals
  – he really dragged down perceptions of EVs in general. It’s definitely
  unusual to have a chief executive have an impact on a whole class of products
  like this.” Opposition to Musk over his alliance with Trump, which has since
  ruptured in acrimony, caused many liberal Tesla owners in the US and Europe to
  express embarrassment with their vehicles. Some have even adorned their cars
  with anti-Musk stickers that feature slogans such as “Anti Elon Tesla Club” or
  “I Bought This Before Elon Went Crazy.” However, the new study found that
  Musk’s rightwing shift has not made conservative Americans more likely to buy
  a Tesla or any electric car, despite separate polling showing that Republican
  voters now have a more favorable view of the car company than they once did.
  Views on Musk are also sharply divided between conservatives and liberals.
  Even as liberals dramatically changed their views of Tesla, and to a lesser
  extent EVs, most conservatives remain skeptical of both and have been
  consistently unwilling to consider buying an electric car in the past two
  years of polling. While buying an electric vehicle was the most politically
  polarized environmental action when the researchers’ polling began, more so
  than installing solar panels or even eating less red meat, Democrats and
  Republicans are now more in line than they were following Musk’s political
  foray. “We thought that liberals would be pretty stable because EVs are so
  historically associated with the green movement and that Musk’s rightward turn
  would bring conservatives on board,” said Flores. “But the opposite happened –
  over time conservatives remained relatively steady in their lack of interest
  in EVs and Tesla, while liberals’ attitudes really dropped. They are now
  equally unlikely to buy an EV as they are a Tesla.” Flores said that EVs’
  association with climate-friendly politics may be more influential for
  conservatives than liberals when it comes to purchasing decisions. “The
  attitude among conservatives to Tesla may be slightly less negative than
  before but that didn’t translate into the part of psychology of how they
  intended to behave,” she said. “That strong link to liberalism is too much for
  them to be budged on. It’s more foundational to them than if they like or
  don’t like Elon Musk.” Musk has recently admitted that Tesla faces a “rough
  few quarters” ahead amid stuttering sales figures for the company in the US.
  Last week, Tesla announced sales for the second quarter of 2025 were 12% down
  on the same period last year, amid consumer concerns over tariffs, Tesla’s
  lineup and the imminent removal of tax credits, as well as Musk’s own image.
  In California, Tesla’s heartland, the situation is particularly stark, with
  the company posting a seventh consecutive quarter of declines in new vehicle
  registrations. Overall EV sales in the US dipped in the three months to July,
  year-on-year, and the shift to electric models is likely to be slowed further
  by a Republican spending bill, signed by Trump, that axes a key incentive for
  buyers to opt for an EV. From September, a tax credit of up to $7,500 for an
  electric car purchase will be deleted, with dealers expecting a rush of people
  to take advantage of the subsidy before it expires. “You can’t deny there are
  people who say they won’t buy a Tesla but the company’s numbers aren’t too
  surprising,” said Erin Keating, executive analyst at Cox Automotive. “They
  have had two major products that are major sellers, they haven’t changed them
  in years and there is now a big influx of new and more exciting electric
  products out there. “I’m not sure you can attribute any falloff in EV sales to
  Elon, maybe him being on both sides of the coin will free EVs from being a
  political lightning rod,” Keating said, adding that total market share for EVs
  may not break 10% this year, as previously forecast. “The removal of the tax
  credits may slow things down, it will hurt consumers’ perception of whether
  they can afford an EV or not,” she said. “But EVs aren’t going away – adoption
  may stagnate but it won’t go off a cliff. We’ve invested too much into it and
  there are too many good products on the market now.” Transportation is the
  largest contributor to planet-heating pollution in the US and any slowdown in
  EV adoption would hinder attempts to address the climate crisis. “One of the
  more troubling implications of our study is what this means for the climate,”
  said Flores. “It is possible, though, that Musk’s shadow over EVs starts to
  fade, even if opinions about Tesla don’t recover. That pride in driving a
  climate-friendly vehicle may rebound among liberals.” • This article was

  version stated.
