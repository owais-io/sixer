  Pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland have overcome the obstacles
  placed in their way by the Covid pandemic to a striking degree. The cohort who
  received their GCSE results on Thursday did not take Sats at the end of
  primary school. Their crucial transition to secondary education was disrupted,
  with students missing chunks of formal learning and experiences such as school
  trips. This year’s strong results should thus be celebrated as a triumph over
  adversity. Teachers deserve enormous credit for stewarding these pupils
  through what is always a demanding set of tests. Like last week’s A-levels,
  however, these results also give rise to concerns. Chief among these are the
  widening attainment gaps between richer and poorer areas, and between
  better-off and disadvantaged pupils. Predictably, the poorest children have
  suffered the worst effects from Covid disruption. On some metrics, including
  school attendance, decades of progress have unravelled. The number of
  candidates passing compulsory resits of maths and English has also declined –
  a situation rightly described by one exam board chief, Jill Duffy, as a
  crisis. Rectifying the unjust situation whereby there is no pupil premium
  after year 11 would be a good start. Bridget Phillipson has already announced
  the expansion of a scheme offering dedicated support and mentoring to schools
  in England that are “stuck”. But while pupils in the north-east and north-west
  continue to score lower grades on average than those in and around London,
  this is not a simple tale of north and south. Comparing pre- and post-pandemic
  outcomes, a new report from the Institute for Government (IfG) highlights
  complexities that require fresh approaches. While councils have lost most of
  the power they once had over schools, the significant attainment gap between
  the least and most successful local authority areas points to some highly
  localised, place-specific effects. Multiple attempts to boost results in towns
  such as Blackpool have failed. New thinking and resources will be needed to
  achieve turnarounds. Another issue is understanding what kinds of schools
  serve disadvantaged pupils best. Schools with a mix of social backgrounds and
  abilities are the long-established preference of progressives. But the
  evidence from the IfG is complex: it finds examples both of disadvantaged
  pupils benefiting from socially mixed settings, and of them doing better in
  primary schools where they are clustered – perhaps because teachers there are
  more focused on their needs. Some London boroughs, meanwhile, are a law unto
  themselves, outperforming other areas by wide margins despite high levels of
  disadvantage (evidence suggests Birmingham and Manchester may be on similar
  trajectories). While the gap between boys’ and girls’ results shrank slightly
  this year, differences between ethnic groups are significant yet hard to
  summarise. When disadvantaged schools are compared, those with higher
  proportions of pupils with English as an additional language do better.
  Overall, the results give cause for reassurance about young people’s
  resilience. But relief that some of the worst predictions about the pandemic
  have not come true must not obscure the fact that more than 40% of pupils
  missed the crucial grade 4 in maths and English. There are other problems with
  GCSEs, and exams and assessment in general. But too-rigid rules around resits,
  and the wider question of how to improve post-16 options, are the most
  pressing.
