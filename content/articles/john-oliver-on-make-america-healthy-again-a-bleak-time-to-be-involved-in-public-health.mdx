  On the latest episode of Last Week Tonight, John Oliver delved into the “Make
  America healthy again” (Maha) movement, a “big tent” group that’s “not just
  Republicans”. Many within the loose Maha movement are parents interested in
  feeding their children healthy food. “People have found themselves in Maha for
  all sorts of reasons, and there are areas where it has legitimate concerns,”
  Oliver said on Sunday evening. He pointed to numerous former episodes that
  overlapped with Maha concerns, from plastic to sugar to biases in medicine,
  and confirmed that experts agree with health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr’s
  central claim that American children are getting sicker; a child in the US is
  15% to 20% more likely to have a chronic condition in 2023 than in 2011. “So
  for some, especially experts in diet and nutrition, suddenly seeing the Maha
  movement bring attention to issues they’re passionate about has been
  validating if also bittersweet,” said Oliver before a clip of renowned
  nutritionist Dr Marion Nestle admit that seeing Kennedy appointed health and
  human services secretary was “the first time I’ve heard anybody at that level
  of government talk about these things … I can’t get over it. And it’s hard to
  put that together with some of the other things he’s saying. “It is bizarre to
  have someone you virulently disagree with in most respects echo your opinions
  in another,” Oliver confirmed. “It would be like if Kim Jong-un came out and
  said, ‘Wirecutter has too many articles now, and if you’re looking at
  Wirecutter for like ketchup, you need to reassess how you make decisions.’ It
  would be weird.’ “Unfortunately, some of ‘the other things’ RFK is saying
  could now have massive consequences given the position that he’s in,” he
  continued. “Because even when he and his movement can be right about
  identifying a problem, their solutions can range from the superficial to the
  outright dangerous.” Oliver punctured some of the movement’s claimed
  victories, such as the banning of certain artificial food dyes. Given that
  there is literature to support that synthetic food dyes can impact
  neurobehavior in some children, and the fact that there is no real need for
  them, Oliver didn’t oppose removing dyes from foods. But experts say such
  moves “won’t actually move the needle” when it comes to Americans’ health.
  “Making a big deal out of narrow wins is part and parcel of this movement,” he
  explained, pointing to the influencer and Kennedy acolyte Vani Hari, also
  known as the Food Babe, who markets her own line of protein shakes in videos
  calling out obscure ingredients in normal milkshakes. “You might be thinking,
  well, who cares if some of Maha’s boosters can be wobbly on the science or are
  hawking products, as long as RFK Jr is putting reliable people in charge at
  the top,” said Oliver. “But I’d argue he isn’t.” The host then looked at the
  brother and sister duo of Calley and Casey Means, top advisers for RFK Jr. The
  former claimed on the Joe Rogan podcast that he convinced Kennedy to join
  Trump’s campaign after a revelatory meeting at a sweat tent. “I would rather
  be anywhere on earth than in a sweat tent with RFK,” Oliver joked. “I’d rather
  be in a dumpster full of glass and cockroaches. I’d rather be in a flight
  where half the passengers are babies and half are Mel Gibsons.” Oliver also
  mocked a Casey Means podcast appearance in which she drank a “liver smoothie”
  and winced. “I think we as a society have collectively lost our grasp of what
  smoothies are supposed to be,” he said. “Because there should not be meat in
  there, as that is definitionally no longer a smoothie. It’s hospital food for
  a terminally ill hyena.” Both Meanses promote the idea of “metabolic health”
  or, to quote their book, “Good Energy”, to the point that Calley Means said
  that cancer, dementia, and genetic diseases are not random, but “all tied
  essentially to food”. “I don’t think it’s quite that simple,” said Oliver.
  “Most medical experts will tell you that it’s not that health outcomes can’t
  be impacted by personal behaviors or diet, but health is complex, and its
  components are personal, environmental and systemic, on top of which sometimes
  – and this is a technical term – shit just happens, and it’s out of your
  control.” While the Meanses come down hard on processed foods, there are other
  areas where they are “worryingly lax”, said Oliver. Casey doesn’t favor
  restrictions on selling raw milk, which can contain carry dangerous pathogens
  such as salmonella, E coli and listeria, and has entertained bogus ideas on
  vaccines causing autism. Calley Means said on Rogan’s podcast that “if you
  were metabolically healthy, you did not die of Covid.” If one is to take the
  Meanses at their word, they just want Americans to eat healthier, but their
  work with Kennedy is not accomplishing that goal. The new administration has
  cut $1bn in federal funding for schools and food banks to buy food from local
  suppliers, and its made cuts to Snap food assistance eligibility, meaning
  there are fewer recipients of free breakfast and lunch at school. “Which I
  guess is one way to accomplish Maha’s goals – kids can’t eat any food dyes if
  they’re not eating anything,” said Oliver. “And that is the thing: whatever
  cosmetic gain Maha has won since Trump took office have been more than offset
  in massive losses elsewhere.” Oliver also looked ahead to potentially even
  worse losses ahead. The Department of Health and Human Services under Kennedy
  has already begun scaling back and defunding mRNA vaccine research, in what
  one public health expert called “the most dangerous public health decision I
  have ever seen made by a government body”. And in June, Kennedy fired everyone
  from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which decides on
  immunization standards. He has since appointed seven new members, only one of
  whom is recognized as a vaccine expert, the rest being, as Oliver put it, “a
  real who’s-uh-oh of crackpots”. “This is a bleak time to be involved in public
  health,” he summarized, as the administration is “taking a buzzsaw to so many
  of Maha’s stated priorities”. “It is maddening that for the first time in
  recent memory, there’s been a genuine groundswell of support for a cleaner,
  healthier, less corporately controlled America, but it’s taken this fucking
  form,” he added. “Because for the final time: it is absolutely legitimate to
  want Americans to be healthier, and there are clearly legitimate problems when
  it comes to America’s health. But these just aren’t the solutions.” Instead,
  the administration is “shredding the social safety net”, said Oliver, while
  “elevating voices that push the responsibility for healthcare down to the
  individual”. “In its current form, Maha is not about making America healthy
  again,” he concluded. “At best, it is about laundering the reputation of an
  administration that is doing the exact opposite.”
