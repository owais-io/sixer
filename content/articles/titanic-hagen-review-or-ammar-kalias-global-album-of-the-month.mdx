  In just five years, Guatemalan cellist Mabe Fratti has become one of
  experimental music’s biggest names. In addition to her spellbinding solo
  releases, she is an eager collaborator, working with the likes of Efterklang,
  the improv quartet Amor Muere – which she co-founded in her adopted home of
  Mexico City – and with her romantic partner, guitarist Hector Tosta, as
  Titanic. On the latter’s superb 2023 debut, Vidrio, they pioneered a
  genre-agnosticism that veered from squealing free-jazz saxophone to hammering
  drum grooves and aggressively processed cello, always anchored in Fratti’s
  soaring falsetto. It heralded the arrival of a group who embraced
  experimentation as much as earwormy melodies. On Hagen, the duo double down on
  their convictions, complementing their unusual arrangements with a newfound
  pop shimmer. Opener Lágrima del Sol sets the tone: sparse hand claps and
  shards of distorted guitar mark the rhythm for Fratti’s lilting nursery rhyme
  melody, then clattering drums burst through. When the song feels on the verge
  of falling apart, it suddenly takes on shades of 80s synth-pop, with Fratti
  singing softly over Phil Collins-worthy toms and twinkling keys. This kind of
  joyous surprise recurs throughout the record. Escarbo Dimensiones develops
  from a minimal arrangement of drums, bass and atonal vocals into soft funk
  that nods to Sade. La Dueña slips from distorted cello and cymbal washes into
  a dramatic synth ballad that channels Kate Bush’s yearning vocals; La Trampa
  Sale erupts from a trudging beat into an arena-sized, reverb-laden chorus.
  Cathartic moments of darkness temper their pop side: Gotera wrangles
  thundering metal blastbeats beneath Fratti’s elongated melodies; Gallina
  Degollada delivers unrelenting, menacing drums and growling bass. This
  startling balance underscores Hagen’s remarkable achievement: a reimagining of
  pop music that revels in lingering unease, challenging yet infectious. Also
  out this month Colombian musician Lucrecia Dalt releases A Danger to Ourselves
  (RVNG Intl), an intimate collection of longing vocal melodies accompanied by
  sparse drum loops and textural harmony. It’s downtempo and full of strange
  instrumental flourishes that draw the listener in. Moroccan producer Guedra
  Guedra’s latest album, Mutant (Smugglers Way), continues his exploration of
  north African rhythms, weaving dabke and gnawa percussive patterns into
  electronic drum programming and synth melody, creating a propulsive dancefloor
  explosion. West African percussion ensemble Balimaya Project’s debut
  collaboration with Colombian group Discos Pacífico All Stars, Calima (Jazz
  Re:freshed), is a fascinating fusion of African and Latin traditions,
  meandering from highlife to rumba, talking drum and Latin jazz horns, all held
  together by a relentless sense of groove.
