  After an unusual August of geopolitical summitry, the reality is sinking in
  that Europe is on its own in defending Ukraine’s sovereignty and hence its own
  security against Russian aggression and cannot count on much support from the
  United States. The sense of strategic loneliness in an increasingly brutal
  global power contest follows a summer of submission in which the EU accepted a
  manifestly unbalanced trade deal imposed by Donald Trump and pledged
  improbably large investments in the US while European Nato members promised to
  boost their defence spending to an aspirational 5% of gross domestic product –
  all to appease Trump in hopes of keeping the US engaged in European security.
  To be sure, it could have been worse. By accompanying the Ukrainian president,
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to the White House last week, the leaders of Britain,
  France, Germany, Italy, Finland and the European Commission displayed their
  unity in rejecting Vladimir Putin’s demands for territorial concessions to end
  the war, which Trump had come close to echoing. They managed to mitigate some
  of the political damage caused by Trump’s red-carpet welcome for the Russian
  president in Alaska and secured a vague pledge from Trump that the US would
  provide some support to a European-led security force for Ukraine in case of a
  ceasefire agreement. However, Trump once again ruled out Nato membership for
  Kyiv and dropped the demand that Russia accept an immediate ceasefire in
  Ukraine without securing any reciprocal concession from Putin, and he let
  another self-declared deadline for tougher sanctions against Moscow slip by
  without any action. Nor did he give any assurance that Europe would have a
  seat in any future peace negotiations. Moreover, his Treasury secretary said
  the US would charge a 10% mark-up on all European purchases of American
  weaponry for Ukraine – in effect a war tax on its own allies. The White House
  made clear any US support for a reassurance force being mustered by the UK and
  France for Ukraine would not involve “boots on the ground”. Trump hinted
  Washington might provide air power but the Pentagon’s policy chief told
  European military chiefs that US assistance would be very limited. It’s not
  clear how far the Europeans will be able to rely on crucial US intelligence
  sharing, let alone US backup if European forces were to come under attack in
  Ukraine. Washington is reported to have stopped sharing intelligence about its
  Ukraine-Russia negotiations even with its closest Five Eyes allies – the UK,
  Canada, Australia and New Zealand – on the orders of Trump’s intelligence
  coordinator, Tulsi Gabbard. That means European governments weighing up
  whether to commit ground troops, air forces, anti-missile defences, naval
  units or trainers to support postwar Ukraine cannot be sure that the US may
  not suddenly blind them, withholding vital intelligence, surveillance and
  reconnaissance if Russia were to begin another military buildup or resume
  hostilities. Europe’s de facto leadership group also faces political and
  economic challenges at home as it struggles to boost military and financial
  support to Kyiv and put together a credible plan for postwar security
  “guarantees”. Impressive as it was, the White House show of European unity and
  resolve is already fraying. The Italian deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini,
  has derided President Emmanuel Macron’s call to put European forces in
  Ukraine. The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, is under fire within his own
  coalition for suggesting that Berlin would contribute troops to the
  reassurance force being put together by the “coalition of the willing”. There
  were also questions about the absence of Poland, a resolute supporter and
  neighbour of Ukraine and the strongest central European state, from the Oval
  Office summit, apparently due to a standoff between the pro-EU prime minister,
  Donald Tusk, and the new pro-Trump president, Karol Nawrocki. Warsaw has said
  it won’t contribute troops to a European force because it needs them to defend
  its own borders with Russia and Belarus. Meanwhile, awkward choices loom over
  Turkey’s participation in any European-led security force. Ankara, which
  controls access to the Black Sea, is likely to seek political concessions from
  the EU, including access to EU-funded rearmament projects as a trade-off for
  committing its forces. This all raises the fundamental question of whether a
  European-led coalition of states can really provide credible security
  guarantees for Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. What would be the defined
  mission and the rules of engagement for a reassurance force, with what US or
  Nato backup in case it came under Russian attack? Do the key European states
  with uncertain US backing have the political will and staying power to deter
  Putin, whose aim is precisely to push the US out of European security and
  divide the Europeans among themselves? Memories of European peacekeeping
  failures in Bosnia in the 1990s and of the pusillanimous European response to
  Russia’s 2014 seizure of Crimea from Ukraine are not encouraging. The European
  Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has made clear most of the burden
  will continue to fall on Ukraine itself, which “must become a steel porcupine,
  indigestible for potential invaders”. Strengthening Ukraine with arms, trade
  benefits and financial support is by far the most useful contribution the
  Europeans can make. With Putin showing no sign of ending the war or engaging
  in serious peace negotiations, and Trump reluctant to exert any real pressure
  on Russia, the Europeans’ ability to secure any ceasefire seems unlikely to be
  put to the test. That’s just as well, since we are still far from having a
  credible political and military capability to deter Russia without dependable
  US support. Paul Taylor is a senior visiting fellow at the European Policy
