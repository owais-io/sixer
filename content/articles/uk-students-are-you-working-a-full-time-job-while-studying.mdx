  A report released last week from the Higher Education Policy Institute found
  that students in the UK today need to work more than 20 hours a week to meet a
  “basic standard of living”. A similar study carried out last year by the same
  organisation found a record 56% of full-time undergraduates had paid
  employment while studying, with many working and studying an average 56-hours
  a week. This has come amid a rise in the cost of living, particularly housing,
  and experts have warned that those juggling the heavy combined workload are
  more at risk of dropping out. Are you a full-time student who also works a
  full-time job or a significant amount of hours? Why do you need to do this?
  What has been the impact of this on your studies and your own physical and
  mental health? If you’re having trouble using the form click here. Read terms
