  Everything is in decline, argues the geographer Samuel Miller McDonald.
  Democracy and free speech are in freefall. Inequality is soaring, with the 1%
  scooping up ever-larger shares of global wealth. These days, the US has a Gini
  coefficient – the most common international measurement of inequality – on a
  par with slave-owning Ancient Rome. Maternal mortality rates for American
  millennials are three times higher than those of their parents’ generation –
  and this in the world’s richest society. Global life expectancy is falling.
  So, too, are food standards. Outside a few bourgeois sourdough enclaves, real
  bread has vanished. In its place we get mass-produced, spongy, tasteless
  “pseudo-bread” – as Guy Debord lamented in The Encyclopedia of Nuisances. In
  an earlier age, there would have been bread riots. Now? Just muted
  indigestion. What accounts for our complacency? False consciousness, claims
  McDonald in this sparky polemic against the myth of progress. We have been
  hoodwinked by elite propaganda. The “progress narratives” of the ruling
  classes assure us that history only moves forward, that we should trust the
  system and surrender agency to our betters. Even when protests have erupted,
  they have mostly sought modest tweaks rather than revolution. But progress,
  argues McDonald, is a false prophet. History hasn’t followed a tidy upward
  arc. Moreover, what counts as progress has often produced huge collateral
  damage, including ecological devastation. There was a time when human beings
  had a “commensalistic” relationship with nature, turning on veneration rather
  than exploitation. Embracing egalitarianism, most primitive societies didn’t
  have hierarchies of class or gender. Then, around 3000BCE, the “parasitic”
  economy emerged. Mesopotamians were the first to behave as though nature was
  no longer to be communed with but subdued. Religion took the place of animism,
  preaching dominion over the Earth. For McDonald the Epic of Gilgamesh is the
  first piece of progress propaganda: in it, the eponymous hero kills the forest
  guardian, tames the wild, and builds a city, filling it with bread and beer to
  the unbridled joy of his acolytes. The Book of Genesis follows suit. God
  commands Adam and Eve to “subdue” the Earth and tame every living thing.
  Later, Christianity – by then a far cry from Jesus’s radicalism – proved
  useful to Constantine, who saw in monotheism a handy formula: one god, one
  empire, one emperor. Fast-forward a millennium, and capitalism picks up the
  baton. Progress, now secularised, means capital formation: wealth siphoned
  from the masses to the enlightened few, who return to us the bric-a-brac of
  modernity – antibiotics and air fryers and suchlike. The logic of extraction
  remains unchanged; nature and proletariat alike suffer. McDonald’s book is a
  satisfying corrective to the smugness of thinkers such as Steven Pinker, who
  insist that conditions only ever improve. Yet he oversells his case with
  sweeping judgments. His account of religion, for instance, amounts to little
  more than a crude reprise of Marx: it’s all opium for the masses, a tool to
  pacify resentment. But that’s far too simple. From the Peasants’ Revolt to the
  Taiping Rebellion, Christianity has supplied radicals with a script for
  inverting power structures. Equally damaging is McDonald’s uncritical
  endorsement of David Graeber and David Wengrow’s vigorously contested claim
  that Enlightenment ideas came from Indigenous America – specifically from the
  Wendat diplomat Kondiaronk – a theory historians such as David A Bell have
  dismissed as fantasy. On the latter’s account, the French nobleman Baron de
  Lahontan wasn’t so much lifting his ideas from Kondiaronk as putting his own
  progressive views into the mouth of a naïf – a common literary device in the
  early modern period. Readers may find all the doom-mongering a bit much.
  Indeed, there’s a whiff of the swivel-eyed prophet about McDonald. And like
  all doomsayers, he is sure that the end-times are nigh. “Climate change and
  ecological collapse,” we are told, “are very likely to cause political
  fragmentation that nullifies legal and cultural precedents like [slavery]
  abolition … If market economies continue, there is little reason to assume
  they will not return to trade in indentured human beings.” Very likely? The
  confidence is grating and ignores the simple fact that we no longer live in a
  labour-intensive economy. If anything, AI is making the return of slavery
  less, not more, likely. McDonald’s dismissal of the possibility of mass
  investment in nuclear energy in a “neoliberal” world has already aged poorly,
  with enormous sums being poured into small modular reactors this year. All of
  which goes to show that the predictions business is a tough one: things can
  just as easily go the other way. • Progress: A History of Humanity’s Worst
  Idea by Samuel Miller McDonald is published by HarperCollins (£22). To support
