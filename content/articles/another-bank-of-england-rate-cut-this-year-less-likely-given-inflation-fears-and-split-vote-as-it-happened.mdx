  Time to wrap up… The Bank of England has warned that soaring food prices could
  drive inflation to 4% as it voted for a fifth cut in interest rates in a year,
  amid mounting concerns over the strength of the UK economy. In one of its
  closest decisions since its independence more than 25 years ago, the Bank’s
  monetary policy committee (MPC) voted by 5-4 to cut its key base rate by a
  quarter point to 4%. Taking borrowing costs to the lowest level since March
  2023, a cut was widely expected in financial markets. However, the decision
  was a close call, with the rate-setting panel for the first time in history
  holding two votes before reaching its verdict. Andrew Bailey, the Bank’s
  governor, said: “We’ve cut interest rates today, but it was a finely balanced
  decision. Interest rates are still on a downward path, but any future rate
  cuts will need to be made gradually and carefully.” The odds of another rate
  cut this year have fallen following the split vote, and the Bank’s concern
  about inflation this year. Here’s what it means for borrowers and savers:
  Elsewhere…dozens of countries face higher levies on their exports to the US
  now that Donald Trump’s latest wave of country-specific tariffs has come into
  force. The sweeping “reciprocal” rates announced by the White House a week ago
  – just before a previous 1 August deadline was due to elapse – were in place
  as of a minute past midnight Washington time on Thursday. Just before
  midnight, Trump claimed on social media that billions of dollars would start
  flowing into the US as a result of the tariffs. However, while the customs
  duties make countries’ exports more expensive and less competitive, they are
  payable on import and usually passed on to the customer. “The only thing that
  can stop America’s greatness would be a radical left court that wants to see
  our country fail,” the president wrote in capital letters, referencing an
  ongoing case in the US court of appeals which is considering whether he
  exceeded his authority in imposing the “reciprocal” tariffs. Toyota has warned
  it faces a 1.4tn yen (£7.1bn) hit from Donald Trump’s trade tariffs, as the
  Japanese company reported a drop in net profit and cut its guidance for next
  year. The biggest carmaker in the world said it expected to make an operating
  profit of 3.2tn yen in its financial year to March 2026, down 16% on previous
  guidance of 3.8tn yen. While in the UK property market, house prices rose at
  the fastest monthly rate this year in July as mortgage rates eased and banks
  offered bigger home loans, according to the lender Halifax. Andrew Hunter,
  associate director and senior economist at Moody’s Analytics, agrees that UK
  interest rates could fall more gradually than had been expected: “The Bank of
  England cut interest rates by 25 basis points on Thursday as expected, but the
  tone of the announcement was more hawkish than most had anticipated. Four of
  the nine members of the Monetary Policy Committee voted to keep rates
  unchanged, while the BoE raised its forecasts for inflation and warned that
  the upside risks to the medium-term inflation outlook have increased. Although
  we expect inflation to remain above 3% over the second half of this year,
  weaker economic growth and the loosening labour market should convince the BoE
  to continue cutting rates by 25 bps per quarter, with the next move coming in
  November. But the August announcement highlights the risk that continued
  concerns over inflation could see rates being cut even more gradually’’ Here’s
  a breakdown about what today’s interest rate could could mean for you:
  Professor Costas Milas, of the Management School at University of Liverpool,
  explains that higher public sector pay rises could unnsettle the Bank’s
  forecasts: I still see another cut in interest rates by 25 basis points later
  this year. However, I am a bit worried about the conditioning assumptions in
  the Monetary Policy Report. The BoE continues to pay attention to private
  sector wages, when, in fact, as I have shown in an LSE Business Review blog
  public sector wage growth drives private sector wage growth even higher. It is
  therefore important for the government not to agree to the wage demands of
  resident doctors (and nurses) as these wage demands will create additional
  inflationary pressures by lifting private wages much higher than what the BoE
  currently predicts! Economists at Investec say their confidence that the Bank
  of England will cut interest rates again in November has “diminished”. They
  told clients: For this to play out, the burden of proof has shifted: for the
  MPC to stick to the once-per-quarter pace of 25bp rate cuts, there will need
  to be evidence that disinflation in the service sector is continuing, not just
  that the jobs market is loosening. Markets have reacted accordingly, with
  short-term rate expectations and sterling pushing higher. As of yesterday, it
  was priced as a near-certainty that the Bank rate would end 2025 at 3.75%.
  Now, the market is less sure, and 2y yields are 5bps higher at the time of
  writing. GBP [the pound], meanwhile, has strengthened by 0.5% against the US
  dollar and 0.6% against the euro at present. This seems an eminently
  justifiable reaction to us. The chances of another cut to UK interest rates
  this year, to 3.75%, have fallen today, following the Bank of England’s
  warning that inflation will rise higher than expected this year. The closeness
  of this week’s vote to cut rates, with four out of nine policymakers wanting
  to hold rates at 4.25%, also appears to make further cuts in 2025 less likely.
  The money markets are now indicating that the next cut is not full priced in
  until February 2026. This morning, before the Bank’s decision to cut rates to
  4% at noon, the City was expecting one cut today and a second by December.
  Capital Economics have told clients that the Bank appears “in no rush to cut
  again soon”. Ruth Gregory, their deputy chief UK economist, says: Although the
  Bank of England cut interest rates today by 25 basis points (bps), from 4.25%
  to 4.00%, it showed some signs that it may cut rates slower and/or not as far
  as our forecast of a decline to 3.00% in 2026. We are sticking to our view
  that interest rates will fall further than most expect. But we’ve become a bit
  less confident in our forecast that the next 25bps rate cut will happen in
  November. The money markets are now predicting two more rate cuts by the end
  of 2026, which would bring rate down to 3.5%. Investors will have noted
  governor Andrew Bailey’s warning against cutting rates ‘too quickly’.
  Economics professor Jonathan Haskel, a former MPC policymaker, suggests the
  Bank’s concerns about inflation signal fewer future cuts than the market
  expecting Derek Halpenny, head of research for global markets at MUFG, says
  the Bank appears more concerned about the risks to inflation: “Based on the
  voting composition in this MPC meeting (5-4 versus 5-2-2 in May) and other
  elements of today’s announcement this is obviously a more hawkish policy
  announcement and we have seen some of the expectations for a Nov rate cut
  taken out of the market. Yesterday, the implied Nov pricing assuming a cut
  today was about 18bps.... that’s dropped to about 12bps now. It’s clear that
  the pick-up in the estimate of inflation peaking at 4.0% has made some
  uncomfortable with the idea of continued steady easing. Over in the US, there
  are new signs that America’s jobs market is weakening. Recurring applications
  for unemployment benefits have surged to the highest since November 2021, the
  latest data shows. Continuing claims, which are a proxy for the number of
  people receiving benefits, rose by 38,000 to 1.97 million in the week ended
  July 26, according to US Department of Labor. More Americans filed new claims
  for unemployment support too – the number of initial claims rose by 7,000 last
  week to 226,000. A reduction in interest rates by the Bank of England should
  rank as a joyful summer gift to borrowers weighed down by the high cost
  mortgages and loans. Yet the latest quarter-point cut to the cost of
  borrowing, from 4.25% to 4%, is laced with so many warnings, any celebration
  will be muted. Most prominently, the Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC)
  said in its latest assessment of the UK’s economic outlook that inflation is
  on course to peak at a higher rate in the second half of this year than
  previously forecast. Price spikes in food and energy prices and the higher
  cost of business services will push the consumer prices index to 4% in
  September, it said, before falling only slowly to an average of 3% in a year’s
  time. The MPC made clear that workers who sought to outrun this fresh
  inflationary surge with higher wage claims would be likely to persuade the
  committee to bring its policy of slow and steady credit loosening to a
  grinding halt…. My inbox continues to groan under the weight of reaction to
  the Bank of England’s interest rate decision. And I spy ING explaining that
  the Bank of England has sounded considerably more hawkish than expected in
  today’s minutes. ING says: The Bank has included a new line in its statement,
  stating that “the restrictiveness of monetary policy has fallen as Bank Rate
  has been reduced”. A statement of the obvious, perhaps, but markets have taken
  it as a cue to price a higher end point for this easing cycle. There are now
  barely two cuts priced by next summer, and no further moves this year.
  Policymakers are evidently becoming wary about echoes of 2022, where a spike
  in food and energy prices prompted a much longer-lasting episode of higher
  inflation. Despite that, ING are sticking with their forecast that the Bank
  cuts rates again in November and twice more next year. But it could rethink,
  if inflation rises more than expected or the recent falls in private-sector
  employment start to ease off. The press conference wraps up with Andrew Bailey
  saying he “strongly supports” the current government’s focus on growth and
  productivity, and its predecessor’s focus on this too. Bailey says it is
  critically important for lots of reasons to lift the potential growth rate of
  the economy, which means productivity growth. Q: Won’t the UK public be
  confused that you have cut interest rates today, give the Bank’s concerns
  about inflation? And won’t your forecast that inflation will hit 4% lead to
  higher wage demands, my colleague Phillip Inman asks. Deputy governor Dave
  Ramsden replies that the underlying disinflation process is continuing, as
  wages have risen by less than expected since May. He adds that the Bank thinks
  policy is still restrictive, even though it has cut interest rates today.
  Rates are much, much lower in the euro area, he adds [at just 2%]. Bank of
  England’s governor Andrew Bailey has told reporters it is important to
  consider price stability when setting the minimum wage. Bailey explained: “I
  think it’s important that inflation - price stability, actually - and the
  benefits of that for the cost of living feature in the set of issues ... that
  are taken into account in considering that judgment.” Earlier this week, the
  Low Pay Commission estimated that the national living wage would need to rise
  by 4.1%, to £12.71, to prevent it falling below two-thirds of median earnings.
  A decision has not been made yet, though, so Bailey won’t comment on what
  should happen. Q: What does today’s historic second vote on interest rates say
  about the Monetary Policy Committee? [Reminder: the committee split 4-4-1,
  with four policymaker voting to hold rates, four voting for a quarter-point
  cut, and one for a half-point cut]. Andrew Bailey says there is a provision
  for him to have a casting vote if there is a split. But as the balance on the
  commitee was clearly towards a cut, it was better to have a second vote.
  Bailey says: Even though we had two votes… what really matters is the decision
  and the outcome. And that’s clear. Q: What impact will today’s tariffs from
  Donald Trump have on the UK economy? Bailey replies that there is an “enormous
  amount of news coming from the world economy” (can confirm!), leading to high
  uncertainty. Tariff levels are “settling” at higher levels than we’ve seen for
  a long time, the BoE governor adds [the highest since the 1930s in the US].
  But ultimately, he adds, domestic factors are the primary driver for UK
  inflation. Q: How worried are you about Donald Trump’s constant attacks on
  Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, and his sacking of the head of the Bureau
  of Labor Statistics? The Bank of England governor handles this hand grenade of
  a question carefully. Andrew Bailey says he doesn’t comment on events in the
  US, or the policies of the US administration. But he then explains that Powell
  is a friend, who he works very closely with, adding: He is a man of the upmost
  integrity. I know him very well. He is a man of the upmost integrity. Bailey
  adds that he respects Powell “very much”. [Trump, though, has nicknamed Powell
  “Too Late” for his reluctance to cut US interest rates, describing him as a
  “stubborn MORON”, among other insults]. Q: Are your interest rate cuts
  actually having an impact on the economy, or are we still seeing the impact of
  the earlier rise in interest rates? Andrew Bailey replies that the UK’s
  savings rate has been higher than the Bank expected (perhaps due to the
  increase in rates during 2022 and 2023??). And on investment, Bailey says many
  firms have told him that uncertainty is higher than normal, deterring them
  from making important, irreversable decisions. Asked about the pressures on
  workers’ pay, deputy governor Clare Lombardelli explains that the Bank is
  forecasting a slowdown in wage growth, and higher inflation [a combination
  that squeezes real wages]. Q: Why have you raised your outlook for GDP this
  year despite firms’ concerns that higher employment taxes are hurting growth,
  and trade uncertainty is hurting investment? Bailey says that improved outlook
  is due to data releases since the Bank’s last forecasts in May, adding that
  it’s not a very big change either. Q: The UK government’s borrowing costs have
  gone up even though you cut interest rates – do markets doubt your commitment
  to tackling inflation, or is it concerns about the government spending plans?
  Bailey replies that other governments’ borrowing costs have moved in a smiliar
  way; he doesn’t think there’s a specifically UK story here. Deputy governor
  Dave Ramsden weighs in too, saying there is a global focus on long-term fiscal
  sustainability. Q: The minutes of your meeting show that one member of the
  committee was worried about an increased risk of recession – do other members
  share this concern? [This member was Alan Taylor, who initially voted for a
  half-point cut, triggering a second round of voting]. Andrew Bailey replies
  that the Monetary Policy Committee didn’t spend time discussing this
  explicitly. Bailey says his vote, for a quarter-point cut, was not motivated
  by recession risks. Q: Are UK interest rates definitely still on a downward
  path? “Yes,” BoE governor Andrew Bailey replies. He explains that he still
  believes the path of rates is downwards. But, he then explains there is
  “genuine uncertainty now about the course of that direction of rates”. Bailey
  adds: I’ll be honest with you, the point I was making is that I think that the
  path has become more uncertain, because of what we are seeing. He adds that
  the Bank is jugging the upside risks to inflation, against the downside risks
  that the UK hits its inflation target due to weaker economic activity. Deputy
  governor Clare Lombardelli says the Bank expects food prices to keep rising.
  The short-term forecast is for food inflation to reach “5.5% this side of
  Christmas” before falling back, as cost pressures fade, she tells reporters at
  the Bank. Q: How much impact is government policy having on the forecast rise
  in inflation to 4%, my colleague Richard Partingon asks. Has the government
  made your task harder? Governor Andrew Bailey says there are many
  contributions pushing up inflation. Some are global, such as energy. A “good
  part” of the food inflation story is due to commodity prices, including those
  not produced in the UK such as coffee and cocoa, he says. But there is also an
  element of “domestically administered price effects”, such as higher water
  bills, vehicle excise duty, and the packaging tax in the food industry, he
  adds. Bailey suggests that those two areas are both ‘under half’ of the
  overall impact. Deputy governor Clare Lombardelli, who opposed today’s rate
  cut, is also attending today’s press conference, and fields the first
  question. Q: What is your threshold for voting for a rate cut this year?
  Lombardelli says she’ll present her reasoning in future, probably when she
  appears before the Treasury committee in September. She also points us to the
  minutes of this week’s decision. Those minutes explain that the four
  policymakers who wanted to hold rates were concerned about “the risk of
  greater inflation persistence from structural changes in goods and labour
  markets”. They also argued that “a slower loosening of policy would reduce the
  risk of inflation not meeting the target sustainably.” “We will do what it
  take to return inflation to our 2% target,” declares Andrew Bailey, channeling
  former European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi’s pledge to protect the euro
  back in 2012. Andrew Bailey then says there are good reasons not to expect the
  rise in inflation to persist. He says the Bank expects a gradual normalisation
  of pay growth to feed through to slower price rises in the services sector.
  But he also says the Bank must be very careful that higher food and energy
  prices don’t lead to second round effects (ie, leading to higher wage growth,
  which then fuels inflation….) The Bank of England is holding a press
  conference now to explain today’s interest rate decision. Governor Andrew
  Bailey starts by talking about the “substantial disinflation” seen in the UK
  over the last two and a half years, with wage and price pressures abating in
  recent months. That has allowed today’s cut in interest rates, to 4%, he says.
  The picture is more complex, though, Bailey adds – pointing to the rise in
  inflation to 3.6% in June, due to increases in energy, food and ‘administered
  prices’. He warns: We think inflation will increase to around 4% in September.
  Our job is to ensure that inflation falls back to the 2% target once these
  temporary factors have passed, as we expect to see. So, it remains important
  that we do not cut Bank rate too quickly or by too much. Reaction to today’s
  interest rate decision, and the deep split at the Bank, is flooding in. Here’s
  Steve Ryder, senior portfolio manager at Aviva Investors: As widely expected
  today the BOE delivered a 25bps rate cut to 4%. However, the surprise came
  from the vote split, which was originally a three-way split and then required
  a 2nd vote to agree a majority with the committee settling on a 5-4 vote to
  lower rates. This was far closer than we were expecting despite recent
  comments suggesting that elevated inflation is proving to be a concern for
  many of the MPC. The four who voted against today’s cuts do still see the case
  for further rate cuts, we would agree with this and still see slow and gradual
  normalisation as our base case, although the risks are becoming more balanced.
  Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Miton Investors, says: “The
  base rate is at a level we’ve not seen for well over two years, but the voting
  by the committee only just got the cut through. “The question now may be
  whether this cut has come too late. Growth has been weak for some time, the
  jobs market is under pressure from higher employment costs, tax rises are on
  the horizon, consumer spending is lacklustre, and confidence is low. Also, the
  cut is priced into Gilts so government borrowing costs won’t now be falling.
  “Now we are on the path to lower rates, it’s all about future policy, and the
  inflation versus growth challenge hasn’t gone away. From this vote it’s not
  clear that economic growth will be a focus.” Here’s Luke Bartholomew, deputy
  chief economist, at Aberdeen: “An interest rate cut today was almost
  universally expected, except it seems at the Bank of England itself where the
  voting patterns reveals a very close decision, which required a second round
  of voting before a majority could be found. The tight decision reflects the
  conflicting forces facing policymakers, with inflation proving stronger than
  expected but activity growth remaining weak. It will be difficult for the Bank
  to give clear guidance about the likely path of rates from here given the
  messy data and divided MPC. But in the end, we expect the weakness of growth
  to win out, and for the Bank to cut rates again later this year, and then
  through next year as well.” Simon Gammon, managing partner at Knight Frank
  Finance, said: “Today’s rate cut sends a clear signal that the Bank of England
  is now more focused on slowing growth and rising unemployment rather than the
  threat posed by inflation. The split vote – with members supporting everything
  from a hold to a 50 basis point cut – underlines how finely balanced the
  decision was. But the direction of travel is clear. Borrowers now believe
  mortgage rates are more likely to fall than rise, and that’s lifting sentiment
  across the market. If current trends persist, we could see sub-3.5% mortgage
  rates by Christmas.” The pound has jumped, as the City digest today’s interest
  rate decision. Sterling is up three quarters of a cent against the US dollar,
  to $1.3425. That suggests traders believe it may take the Bank longer to cut
  interest rates again, given the close split on the MPC. Looking at the latest
  money market pricing, another next rate cut is only fully priced in by next
  February, previously it was expected by December. Bad news for households: the
  Bank of England has revised up its forecast for inflation this year. CPI
  inflation is now expected to peak at 4.0% in September, the Bank says, up from
  a previous prediction of a peak of 3.7% later this year. That would be double
  its inflation target of 2%. The Bank says: Inflation is expected to fall back
  thereafter towards the 2% target, although the Committee remains alert to the
  risk that this temporary increase in inflation could put additional upward
  pressure on the wage and price-setting process. Overall, the MPC judges that
  the upside risks around medium-term inflationary pressures have moved slightly
  higher since May. That split of views means the Monetary Policy Committee had
  to hold two rate votes for the first time in its history, Reuters reports. The
  Bank of England was split almost down the middle on today’s interest rate
  decision! Five members of its rate-setting committee – governor Andrew Bailey,
  deputy governor Sarah Breeden, Swati Dhingra, deputy governor Dave Ramsden and
  Alan Taylor – voted to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4%. That
  was a narrow majority. BUT! Taylor actually wanted a deeper cut of half a
  percentage point – which would have cut rates to 3.75%. So in the first round
  of voting, the committee was split 4-4-1. This, unusually, required a second
  vote! And in this second round, Taylor threw his hat in with the quarter-point
  cutters, to outvote the four members – Megan Greene, deputy governor Clare
  Lombardelli, Catherine L Mann and chief economist Huw Pill – who voted to
  maintain Bank Rate at 4.25%. Newsflash: The Bank of England has cut UK
  interest rates to 4%, despite recent increases in inflation, in an attempt to
  support the economy. The Bank’s monetary policy committee has voted to cut
  rates by a quarter of one percentage point, down from 4.25%, in line with City
  forecasts. But it’s a split decision! The monetary policy committee voted by a
  majority of 5–4 to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4%, rather
  than maintaining it at 4.25%, in an unprecedented second vote! It brings Bank
  Rate down to its lowest level since March 2023, and is the fifth cut in a
  year. The cut follows several signs that the UK economy is struggling;
  unemployment rose in the last quarter, construction output slumped in July,
  and GDP shrank in April and May. Donald Trump’s trade wars are also a threat
  to economic growth, as tariffs risk disrupting global trade. The Bank’s
  mandate is to keep inflation to 2% in the medium term, but it has lowered
  borrowing costs despite inflation rising to 3.6% in June. Excitement is
  building in the City of London as investors await the Bank of England’s
  interest rate decision, due at noon. It will be a shock if the BoE doesn’t
  lower interest rates, from 4.25% to 4%, today. But there’s plenty more to
  watch out for, including The vote split. Are policymakers united about today’s
  decision, or are the dissenters pushing to hold rates or make a steeper cut?
  The Bank’s economic forecasts. The Bank will release its latest monetary
  policy report at noon too, which will include its latest projections for
  growth and inflation Trade war worries. Will the Bank voice concerns about
  Donald Trump’s tariffs? The decision will be released at 12pm on the dot.
  There are nine policymakers on the Bank’s monetary policy committee, who have
  a range of views about the the appropriate stance of monetary policy (lower
  interest rates stimulate borrowing, and growth, while higher rates squeeze
  inflation). The Irish government is to publish a plan to diversify its economy
  in the wake of Donald Trump’s punitive tariffs on imports from the EU and
  almost 70 other trading partners around the world. The deputy prime minister
  Simon Harris has said he would publish the national strategy later this month.
  He said: “We must also look for other opportunities to diversify markets for
  Irish business. While we want to continue to do business with the US and
  indeed want to grow business. It is important that we take every opportunity
  to identify new markets. This month we will publish Ireland’s new Market
  Diversification Action Plan.” The Irish government has been criticised in some
  quarters for not building up contingencies in its export-driven economy that
  could soften the blow of a sudden shock such as the US presidents decision to
  impose 15% tariffs on all imports from the EU. Ireland is also bracing itself
  for a new assault on pharmaceutical exports next week. Although the US and the
  EU agreed that any tariffs would not go beyond 15%, Ireland, whose exports are
  driven by pharmaceutical sales to the US, remains nervous that other barriers
  could be erected by Trump to force US multinationals to divert investment to
  the US. Trump singled out China and Ireland’s pharma sectors during an
  interview on CNBC earlier this week. “In many ways, the EU and the US are
  inter-dependent when it comes to pharma. In the very first instance, it’s
  vital that the US keeps its agreement in terms of a tariff rate of no higher
  than 15% on the pharma industry,” said Harris on Thursday. He added: “But
  actually, in the time ahead, it’s important that we seek to further improve
  that. US pharma companies need to have a base in the European Union — and
  Ireland has been a very constructive, very good home for those businesses.
  They’ve done very well in Ireland.” The German car industry has called on the
  US to speedily deliver on its promise to reduce the tariff on cars from 27.5%
  to the 15% ceiling agreed at Donald Trump’s golf course 10 days ago. EU
  manufacturers have found themselves in the same boat as the UK industry which
  had to wait before the agreement struck between Trump and prime minister Keir
  Starmer on a 10% rate came into force. Hildegard Müller, president of the
  German car industry federation, the VDA, said the EU-US deal had “brought no
  clarity or improvement” to the industry. She said: “The sectoral tariffs on
  cars and automotive parts of 27.5 percent, which have been in effect since
  April and May, respectively, remain in place and place a significant burden on
  German automakers and automotive suppliers, as well as on transatlantic trade.
  “It is important that the promised agreement is reached now and the relief
  measures are implemented promptly. The US must now suspend the so-called
  Section 232 and withdraw the sectoral tariffs for the European and thus also
  the German automotive industry. The EU Commission and the German Federal
  Government must vigorously advocate for this.” Other sectors including the
  wine and spirits industry have also called on the White House to act fast to
  reduce the current 15% tariff now applying to alcohol exports. However this is
  unlikely to be settled for weeks, if not months, as the EU and the US continue
  to negotiate carve outs for the sector. Although the EU was hoping for a zero
  for zero tariff rate on alcohol sales in both directions, a small tariff that
  applied to wine and spirits before Trump was elected is still likely to apply
  after the 15% ceiling is unapplied. This is because a reduction to zero would
  require Trump to get approval from congress. Pr-Trump tariffs on alcohol which
  range from 0.5% on Sherry to 1.8% on sparkling wine will apply even if the
  EU-US agree to eliminate the extra tariff. Japan’s government cut its growth
  forecast for this fiscal year, a sign that US tariffs could be threatenening
  its recovery. Japan’s Cabinet Office is now predicting that Japan’s gross
  domestic product will grow by 0.7% in fiscal year 2025, down from the 1.2%
  previously predicted. News site Nippon.com reports that the cut “reflects
  downside risks from high tariffs imposed by the administration of US President
  Donald Trump”. There have been protests outside the Bank of England this
  morning, calling for a windfall tax on bank profits. Demonstrators from
  campaign groups including Positive Money, Tax Justice UK, Equality Trust and
  Green New Deal Rising gathered outside the UK central bank. They handed a
  giant cheque for £11.3bn to people wearing masks of Rachel Reeves and Keir
  Starmer, in a bed made of money alongside others dressed as lobbyists from
  Britain’s biggest banks. The £11.3bn figures is the amount Positive Money
  estimate a windfall tax would generate this year from the UK’s four biggest
  banks, based on their results for the first half of 2025. Hannah Dewhirst,
  head of campaigns at Positive Money, rejects claims that a bank windfall tax
  would hurt growth or the UK’s international competitiveness: “We have
  specifically designed this windfall tax to only target banks’ domestic retail
  operations, which mitigates the risk of them threatening to move their global
  or investment banking operations elsewhere, and best captures the profits
  they’ve made directly at the expense of the UK public. “As for concerns that
  increasing taxes on banks will stunt economic growth, the British public are
  well aware that gains for the financial sector categorically do not ‘trickle
  down’ to the rest of us.” In the energ sector, renewable energy developers
  will begin submitting their bids to win a government-backed subsidy contract
  in what will be a make or break auction for the UK’s plan to build a clean
  electricity system by 2030, my colleague Jillian Ambrose writes. The
  government opened the 7th allocation round for subsidy contracts today, which
  will give energy companies a little under three weeks to submit their sealed
  bids for the subsidy they would need to move ahead with their projects. A
  record number of offshore wind farms are expected to compete for a 20-year
  contract which guarantees a fixed price for the electricity generated after
  the government scrapped a requirement for developers to have planning
  permission in place before the auction. This should help offshore wind
  developers meet the government’s election promise to quadruple the UK’s
  offshore wind resources by 2030. Energy secretary Ed Miliband said: “Last
  year’s auction round secured funding for the largest floating offshore wind
  project in the world, as well as a record number of solar projects. “This
  year, we want to build on that success as we continue our mission to make
  Britain a clean energy superpower - ending our reliance on volatile global gas
  prices so we can bring household bills down for good. “We’re doing that by
  reforming the auction process to deliver better value for taxpayers while
  giving industry the certainty it needs to invest and build here in Britain,
  revitalising industrial heartlands, driving economic growth, and creating
  thousands of jobs through our Plan for Change.” Over in Moscow, share prices
  have jumped after a Kremlin aide announced that Vladimir Putin and President
  Donald Trump will meet soon. Yuri Ushakov, a former Russian ambassador to the
  US, declared that the two sides “essentially reached” an agreement to hold a
  meeting between the two presidents “in the coming days.” “We are now beginning
  concrete preparations together with our American colleagues,” he added in
  televised comments. Russia’s stock market index rose 4.5% after Ushakov’s
  comments, Reuters reports. John Denton, secretary general of the International
  Chamber of Commerce, is concerned that the new US tariffs will make it more
  complicated to export goods to America. Denton says: “From a business
  perspective it’s not just the effective tariff rate that matters — it’s the
  operational disruption and uncertainty the new measures risk creating. “The
  new U.S. regime brings an enormous increase in bureaucratic complexity for
  anyone looking to export to the American market. Even multinational companies
  with sophisticated trade compliance functions are struggling to understand
  what tariff rate will apply to shipments given the complex web of measures now
  in place — as well as continued uncertainty about how core provisions will be
  enforced. “We strongly encourage the administration to provide clearer
  guidance on implementation — particularly to ensure that small businesses
  aren’t damaged by red-tape alone. There is also relief that the world is not
  facing a full-blown global trade war, despite the flurry of tariffs imposed by
  Donald Trump. That’s because most countries have either cut deals, or chosen
  not to retaliate. Denton explains: “Most governments have shown remarkable
  restraint, avoiding tit-for-tat retaliation. The vast majority of global trade
  continues to be conducted on core WTO rules. And we are seeing positive signs
  of trade liberalization in several economies — from unilateral tariff cuts to
  new bilateral and regional trade deals. “The challenge now is to turn that
  positive momentum into a serious push to revitalize the global trading system
  in a way that can create genuine prosperity and opportunity for businesses,
  workers and consumers.” If the Bank of England lowers interest rates at noon
  today, it will be the fifth cut in a year. That easing cycle follows a steady
  increase in borrowing costs through 2022 and 2023, as the Bank tried to dampen
  down inflation. However, many people with longer-dated fixed-rate mortgages
  won’t yet have felt the impact of those rate rises, if they haven’t had to
  remortgage since rates started rising. Amanda Bryden, head of mortgages at
  Halifax, explained this morning: “The second half of this year will also see a
  notable rise in homeowners coming to the end of fixed-rate deals taken out
  during the pandemic-era property boom; a period marked by ultra-low interest
  rates and soaring house prices. While most borrowers coming to the end of
  five-year fixed-rate mortgage deals will see their monthly repayments rise,
  the extent of this will vary across households. Those coming off a two year
  fixed-rate are very likely to see their monthly payments come down, as they
  originally locked in rates during the peak that followed the 2022 mini-budget.
  We’re unlikely to see a significant impact on house prices, but it may
  influence market dynamics if prospective home movers choose to delay plans as
  a result of tighter budgets.” Halifax also reported that average house prices
  increased by 0.4% in July, the highest monthly increase since the start of the
  year. The average property price is now £298,237 compared to £297,157 last
  month The wide-ranging tariffs imposed by Donald Trump mean US consumers are
  facing the highest tariff rate since the Great Depression. The Budget Lab at
  Yale calculated last Friday that the new “reciprocal” tariffs which took
  effect today will lift the overall US average effective tariff rate to around
  18%, the highest since the mid-1930s. This chart shows the latest tariffs: The
  high tariff rates in the 1930s were caused by the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act,
  protectionist legislation intended to support US industries which triggered a
  major trade war, worsened the economic downturn and prolonged the Great
  Depression. Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, says: The Bank of
  England is jostling with US tariffs to steal the limelight on Thursday. US
  tariff rates came into force at midnight, and the average US tariff rate is
  now over 15%, the highest level for a century. This is the backdrop to today’s
  Bank of England meeting, where the market is convinced that the BOE will cut
  rates to the lowest level in 2 years. Professor Costas Milas, of the
  University of Liverpool’s management school, predicts that UK interest rates
  will be cut today, and further in the months ahead, telling us: Trump’s trade
  wars have now taken concrete shape. I expect these to add approximately 0.5
  percentage points to UK inflation by mid-2026, followed, nevertheless, by a
  rapid inflation retreat as UK growth takes a material hit. Based on my recent
  estimates for the LSE Business Review blog, the Bank’s policymakers will
  almost certainly respond by cutting Base Rate by 0.25 percentage points today
  [from 4.25% to 4%]. From here onwards, I expect another cut of 0.25 percentage
  points before the end of 2025 and Base Rate ending up at 3.25 per cent by
  mid-2026. Assuming no further Trump related uncertainty shocks (a brave
  assumption indeed!), Base Rate could end up to 2.75 per cent by mid-2027.
  Intriguingly, shipping giant A. P. Moller-Maersk has raised its financial
  outlook for this year despite Trump’s trade wars. In its latest results,
  Maersk has lifted its forecast for global container market volume growth up to
  between 2% and 4%, from a previous forecast of between -1% and 4%. Maersk said
  it was lifting the guidance “given the more resilient market demand outside of
  North America”, while cautioning that “disruption in the Red Sea is still
  expected to last for the full year”. Vincent Clerc, CEO of Maersk, said the
  company had a strong first half of 2025, adding: Even with market volatility
  and historical uncertainty in global trade, demand remained resilient, and
  we’ve continued to respond with speed and flexibility. As our customers
  navigate these complex challenges, we remain committed to helping them build
  stronger and more adaptable supply chains— making sure they are ready to not
  just weather disruption, but to grow through it. Clerc also told Bloombert TV
  that conditions in the US were subdued owing to the uncertainty from trade
  tariffs, but that a boom in Chinese manufacturing was fueling very strong
  levels of demand. Donald Trump’s plan to impose 100% tariffs on semiconductors
  would be “devastating” for the Philippines, an industry leader has warned
  today. The president of the Philippine semiconductor industry Dan Lachica said
  that around 70% of the country’s electronic exports are semiconductors,
  Reuters reports. Last night, Donald Trump declared that hefty tariffs will
  soon be imposed on semiconductor imports, although there will be carveouts for
  firms investing in their US chip-making operations. During a meeting with
  Apple’s Tim Cook, Trump declared: “We’ll be putting a tariff of approximately
  100% on chips and semiconductors. But if you’re building in the United States
  of America, there’s no charge.” Shares in Apple rose 2.8% in afterhours
  trading, suggesting traders believe it will be insulated from this tariff as
  it has now pledged to invest a total of $600bn in its US manufacturing. Shares
  in chipmakers Invel and Nvidia also rose in afterhours trading. Analysts at
  Swiss Bank UBS argue that the potential damage from semiconductor tariffs
  appears manageable, and that they will not derail the opportunities in the
  artificial intelligence space. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS
  Global Wealth Management, told clients: “While we continue to expect near-term
  volatility, long-term investors underallocated to our Transformational
  Innovation Opportunities can consider using market dips to add exposure to
  these structural growth stories.” India’s stock market has fallen today as
  traders digest the additional 25% tariff announced by the US on Wednesday. The
  benchmark Sensex index has dropped by 0.5%. India’s foreign ministry has
  described Trump’s decision to impose an extra 25% on its exports to the US as
  “extremely unfortunate.” The ministry added that “India will take all
  necessary steps to protect its national interests.” Yesterday, the White House
  announced it was placing an additional 25% tariff on imports from India,
  bringing total tariffs up to 50%, in retaliation for the country’s purchase of
  oil from Russia, “The U.S. tariff hike lacks logic,” Dammu Ravi, secretary of
  economic relations in India’s foreign ministry, told reporters, adding: “So
  this is a temporary aberration, a temporary problem that the country will
  face, but in course of time, we are confident that the world will find
  solutions.” Indian prime minister Narendra Modi has commented too, saying he
  will not compromise the interests of the country’s farmers . Modi told a
  function in New Delhi: “For us, our farmers’ welfare is supreme. India will
  never compromise on the wellbeing of its farmers, dairy (sector) and
  fishermen. And I know personally I will have to pay a heavy price for it.” New
  trade data today has shown that Chinese manufacturers have been taking
  advantage of the trade war truce between Washington and Beijing. China’s
  exports rose 7.2% year-on-year in July, customs data showed on Thursday,
  faster than expected, and also quicker than the 5.8% growth recorded in June.
  Imports grew 4.1%. The pick-up in trade comes after the US and China agreed to
  extend their truce in June, following talks in London. That pause is due to
  end next week. Switzerland could turn to the head of Fifa to help them cut a
  US trade deal, after failing to persuade Donald Trump not to add a 39% tariff
  to its goods. The Federal Council of Switzerland has announced it will hold an
  extraordinary meeting this afternoon after its delegation to the U.S. returned
  empty-handed. The meeting will be held after Swiss president Karin
  Keller-Sutter left Washington empty-handed on Wednesday, without persuading US
  officials to lower the Swiss tariff. There is now pressure to get Fifa
  president Gianni Infantino onto the pitch – as the Swiss-Italian football
  administrator has a notably good relationship with Trump. Swiss national
  councillor Roland Rino Büchel has told the Financial Times that economy
  minister Guy Parmelin should speak to Infantino, saying: “It is definitely
  time to bring in Gianni Infantino now without further delay to help open
  doors. If Parmelin picked up the phone and asked Infantino for help I would
  well imagine he would do it.” Japanese carmaker Toyota has warned that US
  tariffs could cost it almost $10bn this year, a sign of the impact of Trump’s
  trade war. Toyota, the world’s biggest automaker, has cut its operating profit
  forecast for the current financial year to ¥3.2tn (£16bn) down from a previous
  outlook of ¥3.8tn (£19.3bn). Toyota also predicted it would suffer a ¥1.4
  trillion ($9.5 billion) hit to its bottomline from the year. Under the trade
  agreement between Tokyo and Washington, Japanese auto exports into the US
  should face a 15% tariff, down from 27.5% previously, but the change has not
  yet come into effect. Donald Trump hailed the new tariffs which kicked in at
  5am UK time, or just after midnight on the US east coast. The US president
  repeated his claim that money was now “flowing” into the US, even though it is
  US importers who will stump up these new levies on goods from overseas.
  Writing on his Truth Social site, Trump says: IT’S MIDNIGHT!!! BILLIONS OF
  DOLLARS IN TARIFFS ARE NOW FLOWING INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA! Trump
  also challenged the US courts not to block him, saying: RECIPROCAL TARIFFS
  TAKE EFFECT AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES
  THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL
  THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP
  AMERICA’S GREATNESS WOULD BE A RADICAL LEFT COURT THAT WANTS TO SEE OUR
  COUNTRY FAIL! Dozens of countries face higher taxes on their exports to the US
  now that Donald Trump’s latest wave of country-specific tariffs has come into
  force. The sweeping “reciprocal” levies announced by the White House a week
  ago – just before a previous 1 August deadline was due to elapse – were in
  place as of a minute past midnight Washington time on Thursday. Key details of
  Trump’s latest tariffs include: The rates range from 41% on Syria, 40% on Laos
  and Myanmar and 39% on Switzerland to 10% for the UK. The levies will be on
  top of the usual tariffs applying to US-bound goods. Brazil’s “reciprocal”
  rate is 10%, for example, but its total levy is 50% after Trump added a 40%
  levy over the prosecution of ex-president Jair Bolsonaro. India’s 25% tariff
  rate could rise to a total of 50% after Trump imposed an additional charge for
  buying oil from Russia. The European Union is the only US trading partner
  where its baseline rate – set at 15% after a framework deal – will include
  previous tariffs. It means, for example, cheeses that are normally hit with
  import duties of 14.9% will be taxed at 15% and not 29.9%. Trump first
  unveiled the raft of country-specific rates on 2 April, which he called
  “liberation day”, claiming the world had long been ripping off the US. On
  Wednesday, meanwhile, Trump said he would impose a 100% tariff on computer
  chips – likely raising the cost of electronics and household goods – but that
  US-produced chips would be exempt. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling
  coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. With the UK
  economy looking weak, but inflation rumbling away, and a trade war raging,
  these are tricky times to be a central banker. And at noon today, the Bank of
  England will reveal whether its policymakers have decided to lower borrowing
  costs, or leave them unchanged – and, significantly, whether they all agreed
  on the decision! The City is widely expecting a quarter-point cut in interest
  rates, to bring Bank rate down from 4.25% to 4%. Some of the nine members of
  the BoE’s monetary policy committee may push for a deeper cut, fearing that
  rising unemployment and weakening economic activity is flashing the alarm. On
  the other side of the table, though, hawkish MPC members may point to
  inflation - which rose to 3.6% in June - as a reason to leave rates on hold.
  Guillermo Felices, global investment strategist at PGIM Fixed Income, says a
  25 basis point (quarter-point) cut is “almost a done deal”, adding: We expect
  a further 50bps of rate cuts over the 3 following meetings, as the Monetary
  Policy Committee begins to put more weight on the weak labour market. There
  are MPC members that already see a greater urgency to cut rates, as indicated
  by the 6-3 vote split to hold at the last meeting. The Bank also has to weigh
  up the impact of Donald Trump’s trade war. The UK’s trade deal with the US
  means the direct impact from tariffs is relatively limited, but there is the
  global situation to consider too. Earlier this morning, the latest wave of
  country-specific tariffs came into force, a week after Trump announced them.
  Switzerland failed to reach a last-minute deal to lower its rate from 39%.

Time to wrap up… The Bank of England has warned that soaring food prices could drive inflation to 4% as it voted for a fifth cut in interest rates in a year, amid mounting concerns over the strength of the UK economy. In one of its closest decisions since its independence more than 25 years ago, the Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) voted by 5-4 to cut its key base rate by a quarter point to 4%. Taking borrowing costs to the lowest level since March 2023, a cut was widely expected in financial markets. However, the decision was a close call, with the rate-setting panel for the first time in history holding two votes before reaching its verdict. Andrew Bailey, the Bank’s governor, said: “We’ve cut interest rates today, but it was a finely balanced decision. Interest rates are still on a downward path, but any future rate cuts will need to be made gradually and carefully.” The odds of another rate cut this year have fallen following the split vote, and the Bank’s concern about inflation this year. Here’s what it means for borrowers and savers: Elsewhere…dozens of countries face higher levies on their exports to the US now that Donald Trump’s latest wave of country-specific tariffs has come into force. The sweeping “reciprocal” rates announced by the White House a week ago – just before a previous 1 August deadline was due to elapse – were in place as of a minute past midnight Washington time on Thursday. Just before midnight, Trump claimed on social media that billions of dollars would start flowing into the US as a result of the tariffs. However, while the customs duties make countries’ exports more expensive and less competitive, they are payable on import and usually passed on to the customer. “The only thing that can stop America’s greatness would be a radical left court that wants to see our country fail,” the president wrote in capital letters, referencing an ongoing case in the US court of appeals which is considering whether he exceeded his authority in imposing the “reciprocal” tariffs. Toyota has warned it faces a 1.4tn yen (£7.1bn) hit from Donald Trump’s trade tariffs, as the Japanese company reported a drop in net profit and cut its guidance for next year. The biggest carmaker in the world said it expected to make an operating profit of 3.2tn yen in its financial year to March 2026, down 16% on previous guidance of 3.8tn yen. While in the UK property market, house prices rose at the fastest monthly rate this year in July as mortgage rates eased and banks offered bigger home loans, according to the lender Halifax. Andrew Hunter, associate director and senior economist at Moody’s Analytics, agrees that UK interest rates could fall more gradually than had been expected: “The Bank of England cut interest rates by 25 basis points on Thursday as expected, but the tone of the announcement was more hawkish than most had anticipated. Four of the nine members of the Monetary Policy Committee voted to keep rates unchanged, while the BoE raised its forecasts for inflation and warned that the upside risks to the medium-term inflation outlook have increased. Although we expect inflation to remain above 3% over the second half of this year, weaker economic growth and the loosening labour market should convince the BoE to continue cutting rates by 25 bps per quarter, with the next move coming in November. But the August announcement highlights the risk that continued concerns over inflation could see rates being cut even more gradually’’ Here’s a breakdown about what today’s interest rate could could mean for you: Professor Costas Milas, of the Management School at University of Liverpool, explains that higher public sector pay rises could unnsettle the Bank’s forecasts: I still see another cut in interest rates by 25 basis points later this year. However, I am a bit worried about the conditioning assumptions in the Monetary Policy Report. The BoE continues to pay attention to private sector wages, when, in fact, as I have shown in an LSE Business Review blog public sector wage growth drives private sector wage growth even higher. It is therefore important for the government not to agree to the wage demands of resident doctors (and nurses) as these wage demands will create additional inflationary pressures by lifting private wages much higher than what the BoE currently predicts! Economists at Investec say their confidence that the Bank of England will cut interest rates again in November has “diminished”. They told clients: For this to play out, the burden of proof has shifted: for the MPC to stick to the once-per-quarter pace of 25bp rate cuts, there will need to be evidence that disinflation in the service sector is continuing, not just that the jobs market is loosening. Markets have reacted accordingly, with short-term rate expectations and sterling pushing higher. As of yesterday, it was priced as a near-certainty that the Bank rate would end 2025 at 3.75%. Now, the market is less sure, and 2y yields are 5bps higher at the time of writing. GBP [the pound], meanwhile, has strengthened by 0.5% against the US dollar and 0.6% against the euro at present. This seems an eminently justifiable reaction to us. The chances of another cut to UK interest rates this year, to 3.75%, have fallen today, following the Bank of England’s warning that inflation will rise higher than expected this year. The closeness of this week’s vote to cut rates, with four out of nine policymakers wanting to hold rates at 4.25%, also appears to make further cuts in 2025 less likely. The money markets are now indicating that the next cut is not full priced in until February 2026. This morning, before the Bank’s decision to cut rates to 4% at noon, the City was expecting one cut today and a second by December. Capital Economics have told clients that the Bank appears “in no rush to cut again soon”. Ruth Gregory, their deputy chief UK economist, says: Although the Bank of England cut interest rates today by 25 basis points (bps), from 4.25% to 4.00%, it showed some signs that it may cut rates slower and/or not as far as our forecast of a decline to 3.00% in 2026. We are sticking to our view that interest rates will fall further than most expect. But we’ve become a bit less confident in our forecast that the next 25bps rate cut will happen in November. The money markets are now predicting two more rate cuts by the end of 2026, which would bring rate down to 3.5%. Investors will have noted governor Andrew Bailey’s warning against cutting rates ‘too quickly’. Economics professor Jonathan Haskel, a former MPC policymaker, suggests the Bank’s concerns about inflation signal fewer future cuts than the market expecting Derek Halpenny, head of research for global markets at MUFG, says the Bank appears more concerned about the risks to inflation: “Based on the voting composition in this MPC meeting (5-4 versus 5-2-2 in May) and other elements of today’s announcement this is obviously a more hawkish policy announcement and we have seen some of the expectations for a Nov rate cut taken out of the market. Yesterday, the implied Nov pricing assuming a cut today was about 18bps.... that’s dropped to about 12bps now. It’s clear that the pick-up in the estimate of inflation peaking at 4.0% has made some uncomfortable with the idea of continued steady easing. Over in the US, there are new signs that America’s jobs market is weakening. Recurring applications for unemployment benefits have surged to the highest since November 2021, the latest data shows. Continuing claims, which are a proxy for the number of people receiving benefits, rose by 38,000 to 1.97 million in the week ended July 26, according to US Department of Labor. More Americans filed new claims for unemployment support too – the number of initial claims rose by 7,000 last week to 226,000. A reduction in interest rates by the Bank of England should rank as a joyful summer gift to borrowers weighed down by the high cost mortgages and loans. Yet the latest quarter-point cut to the cost of borrowing, from 4.25% to 4%, is laced with so many warnings, any celebration will be muted. Most prominently, the Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) said in its latest assessment of the UK’s economic outlook that inflation is on course to peak at a higher rate in the second half of this year than previously forecast. Price spikes in food and energy prices and the higher cost of business services will push the consumer prices index to 4% in September, it said, before falling only slowly to an average of 3% in a year’s time. The MPC made clear that workers who sought to outrun this fresh inflationary surge with higher wage claims would be likely to persuade the committee to bring its policy of slow and steady credit loosening to a grinding halt…. My inbox continues to groan under the weight of reaction to the Bank of England’s interest rate decision. And I spy ING explaining that the Bank of England has sounded considerably more hawkish than expected in today’s minutes. ING says: The Bank has included a new line in its statement, stating that “the restrictiveness of monetary policy has fallen as Bank Rate has been reduced”. A statement of the obvious, perhaps, but markets have taken it as a cue to price a higher end point for this easing cycle. There are now barely two cuts priced by next summer, and no further moves this year. Policymakers are evidently becoming wary about echoes of 2022, where a spike in food and energy prices prompted a much longer-lasting episode of higher inflation. Despite that, ING are sticking with their forecast that the Bank cuts rates again in November and twice more next year. But it could rethink, if inflation rises more than expected or the recent falls in private-sector employment start to ease off. The press conference wraps up with Andrew Bailey saying he “strongly supports” the current government’s focus on growth and productivity, and its predecessor’s focus on this too. Bailey says it is critically important for lots of reasons to lift the potential growth rate of the economy, which means productivity growth. Q: Won’t the UK public be confused that you have cut interest rates today, give the Bank’s concerns about inflation? And won’t your forecast that inflation will hit 4% lead to higher wage demands, my colleague Phillip Inman asks. Deputy governor Dave Ramsden replies that the underlying disinflation process is continuing, as wages have risen by less than expected since May. He adds that the Bank thinks policy is still restrictive, even though it has cut interest rates today. Rates are much, much lower in the euro area, he adds [at just 2%]. Bank of England’s governor Andrew Bailey has told reporters it is important to consider price stability when setting the minimum wage. Bailey explained: “I think it’s important that inflation - price stability, actually - and the benefits of that for the cost of living feature in the set of issues ... that are taken into account in considering that judgment.” Earlier this week, the Low Pay Commission estimated that the national living wage would need to rise by 4.1%, to £12.71, to prevent it falling below two-thirds of median earnings. A decision has not been made yet, though, so Bailey won’t comment on what should happen. Q: What does today’s historic second vote on interest rates say about the Monetary Policy Committee? [Reminder: the committee split 4-4-1, with four policymaker voting to hold rates, four voting for a quarter-point cut, and one for a half-point cut]. Andrew Bailey says there is a provision for him to have a casting vote if there is a split. But as the balance on the commitee was clearly towards a cut, it was better to have a second vote. Bailey says: Even though we had two votes… what really matters is the decision and the outcome. And that’s clear. Q: What impact will today’s tariffs from Donald Trump have on the UK economy? Bailey replies that there is an “enormous amount of news coming from the world economy” (can confirm!), leading to high uncertainty. Tariff levels are “settling” at higher levels than we’ve seen for a long time, the BoE governor adds [the highest since the 1930s in the US]. But ultimately, he adds, domestic factors are the primary driver for UK inflation. Q: How worried are you about Donald Trump’s constant attacks on Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, and his sacking of the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics? The Bank of England governor handles this hand grenade of a question carefully. Andrew Bailey says he doesn’t comment on events in the US, or the policies of the US administration. But he then explains that Powell is a friend, who he works very closely with, adding: He is a man of the upmost integrity. I know him very well. He is a man of the upmost integrity. Bailey adds that he respects Powell “very much”. [Trump, though, has nicknamed Powell “Too Late” for his reluctance to cut US interest rates, describing him as a “stubborn MORON”, among other insults]. Q: Are your interest rate cuts actually having an impact on the economy, or are we still seeing the impact of the earlier rise in interest rates? Andrew Bailey replies that the UK’s savings rate has been higher than the Bank expected (perhaps due to the increase in rates during 2022 and 2023??). And on investment, Bailey says many firms have told him that uncertainty is higher than normal, deterring them from making important, irreversable decisions. Asked about the pressures on workers’ pay, deputy governor Clare Lombardelli explains that the Bank is forecasting a slowdown in wage growth, and higher inflation [a combination that squeezes real wages]. Q: Why have you raised your outlook for GDP this year despite firms’ concerns that higher employment taxes are hurting growth, and trade uncertainty is hurting investment? Bailey says that improved outlook is due to data releases since the Bank’s last forecasts in May, adding that it’s not a very big change either. Q: The UK government’s borrowing costs have gone up even though you cut interest rates – do markets doubt your commitment to tackling inflation, or is it concerns about the government spending plans? Bailey replies that other governments’ borrowing costs have moved in a smiliar way; he doesn’t think there’s a specifically UK story here. Deputy governor Dave Ramsden weighs in too, saying there is a global focus on long-term fiscal sustainability. Q: The minutes of your meeting show that one member of the committee was worried about an increased risk of recession – do other members share this concern? [This member was Alan Taylor, who initially voted for a half-point cut, triggering a second round of voting]. Andrew Bailey replies that the Monetary Policy Committee didn’t spend time discussing this explicitly. Bailey says his vote, for a quarter-point cut, was not motivated by recession risks. Q: Are UK interest rates definitely still on a downward path? “Yes,” BoE governor Andrew Bailey replies. He explains that he still believes the path of rates is downwards. But, he then explains there is “genuine uncertainty now about the course of that direction of rates”. Bailey adds: I’ll be honest with you, the point I was making is that I think that the path has become more uncertain, because of what we are seeing. He adds that the Bank is jugging the upside risks to inflation, against the downside risks that the UK hits its inflation target due to weaker economic activity. Deputy governor Clare Lombardelli says the Bank expects food prices to keep rising. The short-term forecast is for food inflation to reach “5.5% this side of Christmas” before falling back, as cost pressures fade, she tells reporters at the Bank. Q: How much impact is government policy having on the forecast rise in inflation to 4%, my colleague Richard Partingon asks. Has the government made your task harder? Governor Andrew Bailey says there are many contributions pushing up inflation. Some are global, such as energy. A “good part” of the food inflation story is due to commodity prices, including those not produced in the UK such as coffee and cocoa, he says. But there is also an element of “domestically administered price effects”, such as higher water bills, vehicle excise duty, and the packaging tax in the food industry, he adds. Bailey suggests that those two areas are both ‘under half’ of the overall impact. Deputy governor Clare Lombardelli, who opposed today’s rate cut, is also attending today’s press conference, and fields the first question. Q: What is your threshold for voting for a rate cut this year? Lombardelli says she’ll present her reasoning in future, probably when she appears before the Treasury committee in September. She also points us to the minutes of this week’s decision. Those minutes explain that the four policymakers who wanted to hold rates were concerned about “the risk of greater inflation persistence from structural changes in goods and labour markets”. They also argued that “a slower loosening of policy would reduce the risk of inflation not meeting the target sustainably.” “We will do what it take to return inflation to our 2% target,” declares Andrew Bailey, channeling former European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi’s pledge to protect the euro back in 2012. Andrew Bailey then says there are good reasons not to expect the rise in inflation to persist. He says the Bank expects a gradual normalisation of pay growth to feed through to slower price rises in the services sector. But he also says the Bank must be very careful that higher food and energy prices don’t lead to second round effects (ie, leading to higher wage growth, which then fuels inflation….) The Bank of England is holding a press conference now to explain today’s interest rate decision. Governor Andrew Bailey starts by talking about the “substantial disinflation” seen in the UK over the last two and a half years, with wage and price pressures abating in recent months. That has allowed today’s cut in interest rates, to 4%, he says. The picture is more complex, though, Bailey adds – pointing to the rise in inflation to 3.6% in June, due to increases in energy, food and ‘administered prices’. He warns: We think inflation will increase to around 4% in September. Our job is to ensure that inflation falls back to the 2% target once these temporary factors have passed, as we expect to see. So, it remains important that we do not cut Bank rate too quickly or by too much. Reaction to today’s interest rate decision, and the deep split at the Bank, is flooding in. Here’s Steve Ryder, senior portfolio manager at Aviva Investors: As widely expected today the BOE delivered a 25bps rate cut to 4%. However, the surprise came from the vote split, which was originally a three-way split and then required a 2nd vote to agree a majority with the committee settling on a 5-4 vote to lower rates. This was far closer than we were expecting despite recent comments suggesting that elevated inflation is proving to be a concern for many of the MPC. The four who voted against today’s cuts do still see the case for further rate cuts, we would agree with this and still see slow and gradual normalisation as our base case, although the risks are becoming more balanced. Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Miton Investors, says: “The base rate is at a level we’ve not seen for well over two years, but the voting by the committee only just got the cut through. “The question now may be whether this cut has come too late. Growth has been weak for some time, the jobs market is under pressure from higher employment costs, tax rises are on the horizon, consumer spending is lacklustre, and confidence is low. Also, the cut is priced into Gilts so government borrowing costs won’t now be falling. “Now we are on the path to lower rates, it’s all about future policy, and the inflation versus growth challenge hasn’t gone away. From this vote it’s not clear that economic growth will be a focus.” Here’s Luke Bartholomew, deputy chief economist, at Aberdeen: “An interest rate cut today was almost universally expected, except it seems at the Bank of England itself where the voting patterns reveals a very close decision, which required a second round of voting before a majority could be found. The tight decision reflects the conflicting forces facing policymakers, with inflation proving stronger than expected but activity growth remaining weak. It will be difficult for the Bank to give clear guidance about the likely path of rates from here given the messy data and divided MPC. But in the end, we expect the weakness of growth to win out, and for the Bank to cut rates again later this year, and then through next year as well.” Simon Gammon, managing partner at Knight Frank Finance, said: “Today’s rate cut sends a clear signal that the Bank of England is now more focused on slowing growth and rising unemployment rather than the threat posed by inflation. The split vote – with members supporting everything from a hold to a 50 basis point cut – underlines how finely balanced the decision was. But the direction of travel is clear. Borrowers now believe mortgage rates are more likely to fall than rise, and that’s lifting sentiment across the market. If current trends persist, we could see sub-3.5% mortgage rates by Christmas.” The pound has jumped, as the City digest today’s interest rate decision. Sterling is up three quarters of a cent against the US dollar, to $1.3425. That suggests traders believe it may take the Bank longer to cut interest rates again, given the close split on the MPC. Looking at the latest money market pricing, another next rate cut is only fully priced in by next February, previously it was expected by December. Bad news for households: the Bank of England has revised up its forecast for inflation this year. CPI inflation is now expected to peak at 4.0% in September, the Bank says, up from a previous prediction of a peak of 3.7% later this year. That would be double its inflation target of 2%. The Bank says: Inflation is expected to fall back thereafter towards the 2% target, although the Committee remains alert to the risk that this temporary increase in inflation could put additional upward pressure on the wage and price-setting process. Overall, the MPC judges that the upside risks around medium-term inflationary pressures have moved slightly higher since May. That split of views means the Monetary Policy Committee had to hold two rate votes for the first time in its history, Reuters reports. The Bank of England was split almost down the middle on today’s interest rate decision! Five members of its rate-setting committee – governor Andrew Bailey, deputy governor Sarah Breeden, Swati Dhingra, deputy governor Dave Ramsden and Alan Taylor – voted to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4%. That was a narrow majority. BUT! Taylor actually wanted a deeper cut of half a percentage point – which would have cut rates to 3.75%. So in the first round of voting, the committee was split 4-4-1. This, unusually, required a second vote! And in this second round, Taylor threw his hat in with the quarter-point cutters, to outvote the four members – Megan Greene, deputy governor Clare Lombardelli, Catherine L Mann and chief economist Huw Pill – who voted to maintain Bank Rate at 4.25%. Newsflash: The Bank of England has cut UK interest rates to 4%, despite recent increases in inflation, in an attempt to support the economy. The Bank’s monetary policy committee has voted to cut rates by a quarter of one percentage point, down from 4.25%, in line with City forecasts. But it’s a split decision! The monetary policy committee voted by a majority of 5–4 to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 4%, rather than maintaining it at 4.25%, in an unprecedented second vote! It brings Bank Rate down to its lowest level since March 2023, and is the fifth cut in a year. The cut follows several signs that the UK economy is struggling; unemployment rose in the last quarter, construction output slumped in July, and GDP shrank in April and May. Donald Trump’s trade wars are also a threat to economic growth, as tariffs risk disrupting global trade. The Bank’s mandate is to keep inflation to 2% in the medium term, but it has lowered borrowing costs despite inflation rising to 3.6% in June. Excitement is building in the City of London as investors await the Bank of England’s interest rate decision, due at noon. It will be a shock if the BoE doesn’t lower interest rates, from 4.25% to 4%, today. But there’s plenty more to watch out for, including The vote split. Are policymakers united about today’s decision, or are the dissenters pushing to hold rates or make a steeper cut? The Bank’s economic forecasts. The Bank will release its latest monetary policy report at noon too, which will include its latest projections for growth and inflation Trade war worries. Will the Bank voice concerns about Donald Trump’s tariffs? The decision will be released at 12pm on the dot. There are nine policymakers on the Bank’s monetary policy committee, who have a range of views about the the appropriate stance of monetary policy (lower interest rates stimulate borrowing, and growth, while higher rates squeeze inflation). The Irish government is to publish a plan to diversify its economy in the wake of Donald Trump’s punitive tariffs on imports from the EU and almost 70 other trading partners around the world. The deputy prime minister Simon Harris has said he would publish the national strategy later this month. He said: “We must also look for other opportunities to diversify markets for Irish business. While we want to continue to do business with the US and indeed want to grow business. It is important that we take every opportunity to identify new markets. This month we will publish Ireland’s new Market Diversification Action Plan.” The Irish government has been criticised in some quarters for not building up contingencies in its export-driven economy that could soften the blow of a sudden shock such as the US presidents decision to impose 15% tariffs on all imports from the EU. Ireland is also bracing itself for a new assault on pharmaceutical exports next week. Although the US and the EU agreed that any tariffs would not go beyond 15%, Ireland, whose exports are driven by pharmaceutical sales to the US, remains nervous that other barriers could be erected by Trump to force US multinationals to divert investment to the US. Trump singled out China and Ireland’s pharma sectors during an interview on CNBC earlier this week. “In many ways, the EU and the US are inter-dependent when it comes to pharma. In the very first instance, it’s vital that the US keeps its agreement in terms of a tariff rate of no higher than 15% on the pharma industry,” said Harris on Thursday. He added: “But actually, in the time ahead, it’s important that we seek to further improve that. US pharma companies need to have a base in the European Union — and Ireland has been a very constructive, very good home for those businesses. They’ve done very well in Ireland.” The German car industry has called on the US to speedily deliver on its promise to reduce the tariff on cars from 27.5% to the 15% ceiling agreed at Donald Trump’s golf course 10 days ago. EU manufacturers have found themselves in the same boat as the UK industry which had to wait before the agreement struck between Trump and prime minister Keir Starmer on a 10% rate came into force. Hildegard Müller, president of the German car industry federation, the VDA, said the EU-US deal had “brought no clarity or improvement” to the industry. She said: “The sectoral tariffs on cars and automotive parts of 27.5 percent, which have been in effect since April and May, respectively, remain in place and place a significant burden on German automakers and automotive suppliers, as well as on transatlantic trade. “It is important that the promised agreement is reached now and the relief measures are implemented promptly. The US must now suspend the so-called Section 232 and withdraw the sectoral tariffs for the European and thus also the German automotive industry. The EU Commission and the German Federal Government must vigorously advocate for this.” Other sectors including the wine and spirits industry have also called on the White House to act fast to reduce the current 15% tariff now applying to alcohol exports. However this is unlikely to be settled for weeks, if not months, as the EU and the US continue to negotiate carve outs for the sector. Although the EU was hoping for a zero for zero tariff rate on alcohol sales in both directions, a small tariff that applied to wine and spirits before Trump was elected is still likely to apply after the 15% ceiling is unapplied. This is because a reduction to zero would require Trump to get approval from congress. Pr-Trump tariffs on alcohol which range from 0.5% on Sherry to 1.8% on sparkling wine will apply even if the EU-US agree to eliminate the extra tariff. Japan’s government cut its growth forecast for this fiscal year, a sign that US tariffs could be threatenening its recovery. Japan’s Cabinet Office is now predicting that Japan’s gross domestic product will grow by 0.7% in fiscal year 2025, down from the 1.2% previously predicted. News site Nippon.com reports that the cut “reflects downside risks from high tariffs imposed by the administration of US President Donald Trump”. There have been protests outside the Bank of England this morning, calling for a windfall tax on bank profits. Demonstrators from campaign groups including Positive Money, Tax Justice UK, Equality Trust and Green New Deal Rising gathered outside the UK central bank. They handed a giant cheque for £11.3bn to people wearing masks of Rachel Reeves and Keir Starmer, in a bed made of money alongside others dressed as lobbyists from Britain’s biggest banks. The £11.3bn figures is the amount Positive Money estimate a windfall tax would generate this year from the UK’s four biggest banks, based on their results for the first half of 2025. Hannah Dewhirst, head of campaigns at Positive Money, rejects claims that a bank windfall tax would hurt growth or the UK’s international competitiveness: “We have specifically designed this windfall tax to only target banks’ domestic retail operations, which mitigates the risk of them threatening to move their global or investment banking operations elsewhere, and best captures the profits they’ve made directly at the expense of the UK public. “As for concerns that increasing taxes on banks will stunt economic growth, the British public are well aware that gains for the financial sector categorically do not ‘trickle down’ to the rest of us.” In the energ sector, renewable energy developers will begin submitting their bids to win a government-backed subsidy contract in what will be a make or break auction for the UK’s plan to build a clean electricity system by 2030, my colleague Jillian Ambrose writes. The government opened the 7th allocation round for subsidy contracts today, which will give energy companies a little under three weeks to submit their sealed bids for the subsidy they would need to move ahead with their projects. A record number of offshore wind farms are expected to compete for a 20-year contract which guarantees a fixed price for the electricity generated after the government scrapped a requirement for developers to have planning permission in place before the auction. This should help offshore wind developers meet the government’s election promise to quadruple the UK’s offshore wind resources by 2030. Energy secretary Ed Miliband said: “Last year’s auction round secured funding for the largest floating offshore wind project in the world, as well as a record number of solar projects. “This year, we want to build on that success as we continue our mission to make Britain a clean energy superpower - ending our reliance on volatile global gas prices so we can bring household bills down for good. “We’re doing that by reforming the auction process to deliver better value for taxpayers while giving industry the certainty it needs to invest and build here in Britain, revitalising industrial heartlands, driving economic growth, and creating thousands of jobs through our Plan for Change.” Over in Moscow, share prices have jumped after a Kremlin aide announced that Vladimir Putin and President Donald Trump will meet soon. Yuri Ushakov, a former Russian ambassador to the US, declared that the two sides “essentially reached” an agreement to hold a meeting between the two presidents “in the coming days.” “We are now beginning concrete preparations together with our American colleagues,” he added in televised comments. Russia’s stock market index rose 4.5% after Ushakov’s comments, Reuters reports. John Denton, secretary general of the International Chamber of Commerce, is concerned that the new US tariffs will make it more complicated to export goods to America. Denton says: “From a business perspective it’s not just the effective tariff rate that matters — it’s the operational disruption and uncertainty the new measures risk creating. “The new U.S. regime brings an enormous increase in bureaucratic complexity for anyone looking to export to the American market. Even multinational companies with sophisticated trade compliance functions are struggling to understand what tariff rate will apply to shipments given the complex web of measures now in place — as well as continued uncertainty about how core provisions will be enforced. “We strongly encourage the administration to provide clearer guidance on implementation — particularly to ensure that small businesses aren’t damaged by red-tape alone. There is also relief that the world is not facing a full-blown global trade war, despite the flurry of tariffs imposed by Donald Trump. That’s because most countries have either cut deals, or chosen not to retaliate. Denton explains: “Most governments have shown remarkable restraint, avoiding tit-for-tat retaliation. The vast majority of global trade continues to be conducted on core WTO rules. And we are seeing positive signs of trade liberalization in several economies — from unilateral tariff cuts to new bilateral and regional trade deals. “The challenge now is to turn that positive momentum into a serious push to revitalize the global trading system in a way that can create genuine prosperity and opportunity for businesses, workers and consumers.” If the Bank of England lowers interest rates at noon today, it will be the fifth cut in a year. That easing cycle follows a steady increase in borrowing costs through 2022 and 2023, as the Bank tried to dampen down inflation. However, many people with longer-dated fixed-rate mortgages won’t yet have felt the impact of those rate rises, if they haven’t had to remortgage since rates started rising. Amanda Bryden, head of mortgages at Halifax, explained this morning: “The second half of this year will also see a notable rise in homeowners coming to the end of fixed-rate deals taken out during the pandemic-era property boom; a period marked by ultra-low interest rates and soaring house prices. While most borrowers coming to the end of five-year fixed-rate mortgage deals will see their monthly repayments rise, the extent of this will vary across households. Those coming off a two year fixed-rate are very likely to see their monthly payments come down, as they originally locked in rates during the peak that followed the 2022 mini-budget. We’re unlikely to see a significant impact on house prices, but it may influence market dynamics if prospective home movers choose to delay plans as a result of tighter budgets.” Halifax also reported that average house prices increased by 0.4% in July, the highest monthly increase since the start of the year. The average property price is now £298,237 compared to £297,157 last month The wide-ranging tariffs imposed by Donald Trump mean US consumers are facing the highest tariff rate since the Great Depression. The Budget Lab at Yale calculated last Friday that the new “reciprocal” tariffs which took effect today will lift the overall US average effective tariff rate to around 18%, the highest since the mid-1930s. This chart shows the latest tariffs: The high tariff rates in the 1930s were caused by the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act, protectionist legislation intended to support US industries which triggered a major trade war, worsened the economic downturn and prolonged the Great Depression. Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, says: The Bank of England is jostling with US tariffs to steal the limelight on Thursday. US tariff rates came into force at midnight, and the average US tariff rate is now over 15%, the highest level for a century. This is the backdrop to today’s Bank of England meeting, where the market is convinced that the BOE will cut rates to the lowest level in 2 years. Professor Costas Milas, of the University of Liverpool’s management school, predicts that UK interest rates will be cut today, and further in the months ahead, telling us: Trump’s trade wars have now taken concrete shape. I expect these to add approximately 0.5 percentage points to UK inflation by mid-2026, followed, nevertheless, by a rapid inflation retreat as UK growth takes a material hit. Based on my recent estimates for the LSE Business Review blog, the Bank’s policymakers will almost certainly respond by cutting Base Rate by 0.25 percentage points today [from 4.25% to 4%]. From here onwards, I expect another cut of 0.25 percentage points before the end of 2025 and Base Rate ending up at 3.25 per cent by mid-2026. Assuming no further Trump related uncertainty shocks (a brave assumption indeed!), Base Rate could end up to 2.75 per cent by mid-2027. Intriguingly, shipping giant A. P. Moller-Maersk has raised its financial outlook for this year despite Trump’s trade wars. In its latest results, Maersk has lifted its forecast for global container market volume growth up to between 2% and 4%, from a previous forecast of between -1% and 4%. Maersk said it was lifting the guidance “given the more resilient market demand outside of North America”, while cautioning that “disruption in the Red Sea is still expected to last for the full year”. Vincent Clerc, CEO of Maersk, said the company had a strong first half of 2025, adding: Even with market volatility and historical uncertainty in global trade, demand remained resilient, and we’ve continued to respond with speed and flexibility. As our customers navigate these complex challenges, we remain committed to helping them build stronger and more adaptable supply chains— making sure they are ready to not just weather disruption, but to grow through it. Clerc also told Bloombert TV that conditions in the US were subdued owing to the uncertainty from trade tariffs, but that a boom in Chinese manufacturing was fueling very strong levels of demand. Donald Trump’s plan to impose 100% tariffs on semiconductors would be “devastating” for the Philippines, an industry leader has warned today. The president of the Philippine semiconductor industry Dan Lachica said that around 70% of the country’s electronic exports are semiconductors, Reuters reports. Last night, Donald Trump declared that hefty tariffs will soon be imposed on semiconductor imports, although there will be carveouts for firms investing in their US chip-making operations. During a meeting with Apple’s Tim Cook, Trump declared: “We’ll be putting a tariff of approximately 100% on chips and semiconductors. But if you’re building in the United States of America, there’s no charge.” Shares in Apple rose 2.8% in afterhours trading, suggesting traders believe it will be insulated from this tariff as it has now pledged to invest a total of $600bn in its US manufacturing. Shares in chipmakers Invel and Nvidia also rose in afterhours trading. Analysts at Swiss Bank UBS argue that the potential damage from semiconductor tariffs appears manageable, and that they will not derail the opportunities in the artificial intelligence space. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, told clients: “While we continue to expect near-term volatility, long-term investors underallocated to our Transformational Innovation Opportunities can consider using market dips to add exposure to these structural growth stories.” India’s stock market has fallen today as traders digest the additional 25% tariff announced by the US on Wednesday. The benchmark Sensex index has dropped by 0.5%. India’s foreign ministry has described Trump’s decision to impose an extra 25% on its exports to the US as “extremely unfortunate.” The ministry added that “India will take all necessary steps to protect its national interests.” Yesterday, the White House announced it was placing an additional 25% tariff on imports from India, bringing total tariffs up to 50%, in retaliation for the country’s purchase of oil from Russia, “The U.S. tariff hike lacks logic,” Dammu Ravi, secretary of economic relations in India’s foreign ministry, told reporters, adding: “So this is a temporary aberration, a temporary problem that the country will face, but in course of time, we are confident that the world will find solutions.” Indian prime minister Narendra Modi has commented too, saying he will not compromise the interests of the country’s farmers . Modi told a function in New Delhi: “For us, our farmers’ welfare is supreme. India will never compromise on the wellbeing of its farmers, dairy (sector) and fishermen. And I know personally I will have to pay a heavy price for it.” New trade data today has shown that Chinese manufacturers have been taking advantage of the trade war truce between Washington and Beijing. China’s exports rose 7.2% year-on-year in July, customs data showed on Thursday, faster than expected, and also quicker than the 5.8% growth recorded in June. Imports grew 4.1%. The pick-up in trade comes after the US and China agreed to extend their truce in June, following talks in London. That pause is due to end next week. Switzerland could turn to the head of Fifa to help them cut a US trade deal, after failing to persuade Donald Trump not to add a 39% tariff to its goods. The Federal Council of Switzerland has announced it will hold an extraordinary meeting this afternoon after its delegation to the U.S. returned empty-handed. The meeting will be held after Swiss president Karin Keller-Sutter left Washington empty-handed on Wednesday, without persuading US officials to lower the Swiss tariff. There is now pressure to get Fifa president Gianni Infantino onto the pitch – as the Swiss-Italian football administrator has a notably good relationship with Trump. Swiss national councillor Roland Rino Büchel has told the Financial Times that economy minister Guy Parmelin should speak to Infantino, saying: “It is definitely time to bring in Gianni Infantino now without further delay to help open doors. If Parmelin picked up the phone and asked Infantino for help I would well imagine he would do it.” Japanese carmaker Toyota has warned that US tariffs could cost it almost $10bn this year, a sign of the impact of Trump’s trade war. Toyota, the world’s biggest automaker, has cut its operating profit forecast for the current financial year to ¥3.2tn (£16bn) down from a previous outlook of ¥3.8tn (£19.3bn). Toyota also predicted it would suffer a ¥1.4 trillion ($9.5 billion) hit to its bottomline from the year. Under the trade agreement between Tokyo and Washington, Japanese auto exports into the US should face a 15% tariff, down from 27.5% previously, but the change has not yet come into effect. Donald Trump hailed the new tariffs which kicked in at 5am UK time, or just after midnight on the US east coast. The US president repeated his claim that money was now “flowing” into the US, even though it is US importers who will stump up these new levies on goods from overseas. Writing on his Truth Social site, Trump says: IT’S MIDNIGHT!!! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TARIFFS ARE NOW FLOWING INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA! Trump also challenged the US courts not to block him, saying: RECIPROCAL TARIFFS TAKE EFFECT AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP AMERICA’S GREATNESS WOULD BE A RADICAL LEFT COURT THAT WANTS TO SEE OUR COUNTRY FAIL! Dozens of countries face higher taxes on their exports to the US now that Donald Trump’s latest wave of country-specific tariffs has come into force. The sweeping “reciprocal” levies announced by the White House a week ago – just before a previous 1 August deadline was due to elapse – were in place as of a minute past midnight Washington time on Thursday. Key details of Trump’s latest tariffs include: The rates range from 41% on Syria, 40% on Laos and Myanmar and 39% on Switzerland to 10% for the UK. The levies will be on top of the usual tariffs applying to US-bound goods. Brazil’s “reciprocal” rate is 10%, for example, but its total levy is 50% after Trump added a 40% levy over the prosecution of ex-president Jair Bolsonaro. India’s 25% tariff rate could rise to a total of 50% after Trump imposed an additional charge for buying oil from Russia. The European Union is the only US trading partner where its baseline rate – set at 15% after a framework deal – will include previous tariffs. It means, for example, cheeses that are normally hit with import duties of 14.9% will be taxed at 15% and not 29.9%. Trump first unveiled the raft of country-specific rates on 2 April, which he called “liberation day”, claiming the world had long been ripping off the US. On Wednesday, meanwhile, Trump said he would impose a 100% tariff on computer chips – likely raising the cost of electronics and household goods – but that US-produced chips would be exempt. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. With the UK economy looking weak, but inflation rumbling away, and a trade war raging, these are tricky times to be a central banker. And at noon today, the Bank of England will reveal whether its policymakers have decided to lower borrowing costs, or leave them unchanged – and, significantly, whether they all agreed on the decision! The City is widely expecting a quarter-point cut in interest rates, to bring Bank rate down from 4.25% to 4%. Some of the nine members of the BoE’s monetary policy committee may push for a deeper cut, fearing that rising unemployment and weakening economic activity is flashing the alarm. On the other side of the table, though, hawkish MPC members may point to inflation - which rose to 3.6% in June - as a reason to leave rates on hold. Guillermo Felices, global investment strategist at PGIM Fixed Income, says a 25 basis point (quarter-point) cut is “almost a done deal”, adding: We expect a further 50bps of rate cuts over the 3 following meetings, as the Monetary Policy Committee begins to put more weight on the weak labour market. There are MPC members that already see a greater urgency to cut rates, as indicated by the 6-3 vote split to hold at the last meeting. The Bank also has to weigh up the impact of Donald Trump’s trade war. The UK’s trade deal with the US means the direct impact from tariffs is relatively limited, but there is the global situation to consider too. Earlier this morning, the latest wave of country-specific tariffs came into force, a week after Trump announced them. Switzerland failed to reach a last-minute deal to lower its rate from 39%. Swiss president Karin Keller-Sutter reportedly left Washington empty-handed last night, following a meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
