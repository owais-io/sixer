  A moment that changed me: I resolved to reduce my screen time – and it was a
  big mistake

  I unlocked my iPhone screen at the precise moment that my weekly screen time
  notification appeared – accidentally dismissing it before I could take a
  screenshot – and promptly erupted into a rage. I had spent an excruciating
  week resolutely not looking at my phone, part of a month-long effort to
  whittle my daily screen time down from more than four hours a day to less than
  an hour, with the hope of improving my mental wellbeing (and possibly carving
  out a career as an inspirational speaker). But my efforts felt futile without
  being able to post evidence online about how offline I had become. I
  frantically Googled how to retrieve notifications (you cannot) and – briefly –
  considered re-creating my screen time report in Photoshop. Over the past
  decade or two, my efforts at self-improvement have taken various forms: the
  year where I read 105 books; the period during which I gave up all forms of
  sugar including, misguidedly, fruit; and a dalliance with shamanism that, I’m
  sorry to say, included interpretive dance. Some might suggest I would be
  better off learning to cook, or drive, or type with more than one finger, but
  they can’t reach me because I no longer look at my phone. “Project Screen
  Time” began after I listened to a podcast in which a comedian claimed that you
  shouldn’t look at social media within two hours of waking up, because it
  messes with your dopamine, or something. This is my favourite kind of advice:
  uncited, from the mouth of a layperson who can’t remember how they acquired
  it. But I gave up opening Instagram first thing in the morning and … it
  worked. Miraculously, choosing not to sandblast my brain with pictures of
  other people’s abs before I was fully conscious did improve my mood. Even
  better, I found that if I didn’t look at my socials first thing, I could often
  resist until after lunch. As is typically the case when I embark on a new
  regime, this brief moment of clarity quickly became a frenzy. I traded one
  obsession (looking at my phone) for another (not looking at it). In my second
  week, I was down to two hours of screen time a day. By my third, it was an
  hour and a half – and I became determined to get it below 60 minutes. Part of
  me was impressed that I could appear normal while quietly (nobly?) wielding
  this superpower. However, I was unable to keep my gift a secret. I soon began
  boring friends, acquaintances and service workers with tales of my herculean
  discipline. Before long, my quest was disrupting my day in new ways. I
  resented having to open Maps on my phone, so I found myself getting lost while
  cycling to appointments. If I wanted to show someone a picture or a meme, I
  would ask to Google it on their phone, rather than my own. I refused to order
  Ubers after nights out (the painstaking process of watching a cab crawl
  towards my location while the minutes of screen time racked up was torturous)
  and instead offered to transfer the money (later, on my laptop) to whoever
  did. I became increasingly frustrated that my screen time wasn’t lower. I
  would get to 2pm having barely glanced at my phone and yet the data would
  claim I had used it for 36 minutes. I began to think conspiratorially. My
  screen time was displayed in a graph split into blue (social), turquoise
  (entertainment) and orange (productivity and finance). But the vast majority
  of the chart was made up of undelineated grey. What was the grey?! Eventually,
  screen time was added to the list of subjects (including the music and lore of
  Taylor Swift and my attraction to Ron DeSantis) that I was forbidden from
  discussing at home. My lowest point arrived as I was showing a friend my
  weekly stats, which gives you a breakdown of how long you’ve spent on each
  app. He queried why “Settings” was my third most-used application – and I had
  to admit it was because that was how I compulsively checked my screen time. My
  tantrum over being unable to memorialise my lowest-ever screen report (51
  minutes a day!) was a wake-up call; reducing my screen time had become its own
  form of phone addiction. Rather than escaping the need to seek validation from
  strangers online, I had happened upon a new way to earn their approval. But
  all was not lost. The realisation nudged me towards acceptance that I will
  probably never be a moderate person; I can’t rely on any form of
  self-regulation (my latest regime – skincare – revolves around an LED mask
  that automatically switches off after 10 minutes, otherwise I fear I would be
  wearing it to the office like a DayGlo Hannibal Lecter). In the end, I stopped
  trying to recapture my screen-time report, instead screenshotting the less
  aesthetic chart in my settings to post online. Within minutes, DMs flooded in
  from people congratulating me on my self-restraint and asking how I had
  managed to quit my phone. I replied to them all, dopamine flooding my brain’s
  starved reward centre. That day, my screen time was three hours and 36
  minutes. • Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article? If you
