  Wildfires raging across Spain have killed a third person as intense heat
  continues across vast swathes of Europe, forcing overwhelmed governments to
  call in support from their neighbours. The European Commission said it was
  sending water-bombing planes to Spain as it struggled to contain deadly
  blazes, with countries across the Balkans also receiving firefighting support.
  A volunteer firefighter died after battling a blaze in Castile and León,
  authorities said on Thursday, after the death of a fellow volunteer in the
  same region on Tuesday. A man died on the outskirts of Madrid on Monday as he
  tried to save horses from a burning stable. “Death strikes us again with the
  loss of a second volunteer who has lost their life in León,” Spain’s prime
  minister, Pedro Sánchez, said on Thursday. He thanked the “heroes” protecting
  people from fires and said “the threat remains extreme”. In Patras, Greece’s
  third-largest city, firefighters pushed back a wildfire that had burned
  through the outskirts of the port and forced the evacuation of a children’s
  hospital and a retirement home. Local media reported that a 19-year-old man
  who had allegedly confessed to starting the blaze was among a number of
  arrests made in connection to it. The Greek fire service spokesperson,
  Vasilios Vathrakoyannis, said the general situation had improved on all fronts
  after an all-night battle, but that a very high fire risk was still predicted
  for most areas of the country. “Today is expected to be a very difficult day,”
  he said. Spain said it had deployed 1,000 military personnel and 50 aerial
  resources to tackle the fires, having become the fifth country in a week to
  activate the EU’s civil protection mechanism to fight the fires. The European
  Commission announced that two planes stationed in France were expected to be
  deployed in Spain on Thursday. Greece is expected to receive two Swedish
  helicopters stationed in Bulgaria under the mechanism, which it activated on
  Tuesday, while Bulgaria, Albania and Montenegro – where a soldier died
  fighting a fire near the capital – have also received support from
  firefighters from several EU countries. The EU’s civil protection mechanism,
  which coordinates responses during wars and other crises, has been activated
  16 times during the current fire season. The number of activations in 2025 is
  already the same as the figure for the whole of the 2024 fire season, the
  commission said. Wildfires have burned more than 500,000 hectares in Europe so
  far this year, according to official data, an increase of 134% compared with
  the average over the past two decades. France experienced its largest wildfire
  since 1949 last week. The two Spanish firefighters who died were using brush
  cutters to slow the spread of a fire when they were engulfed by the flames on
  Tuesday afternoon, according to the Spanish daily El País. The fire is poised
  to become one of the largest in the country’s history. Strong and variable
  winds spread flames that trapped the two men, the newspaper reported. One man
  died within a few hours, while the other, who suffered 85% burns, died after a
  day in hospital. Six people remain in hospital in the region with burns and
  serious injuries, local media reported. The deadly fires come as southern
  Europe suffers intense heat that has broken temperature records across the
  continent – made worse by fossil fuel pollution that traps sunlight and heats
  the planet – and which has dried out vegetation. “It’s obvious that climate
  change is exacerbating the severity of fires,” said Eduardo Rojas Briales, a
  forestry researcher at the Polytechnic University of Valencia and former
  deputy director general of the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization. “But
  it’s not responsible to wait for greenhouse gas emissions to drop … as the
  sole approach to addressing the problem.” He called for additional policies
  such as ensuring dead plant material is kept at manageable levels, creating
  gaps in vegetation, for instance through reversing rural abandonment, and
  using prescribed burning. “There is no alternative but to build landscapes …
  that are truly resilient to fires,” he said. A report published on Thursday by
  XDI, a climate risk analysis group, found that the climate crisis has doubled
  the risk of infrastructure damage from forest fires in France, Italy, Greece,
  Romania and Bulgaria since 1990. It predicted risk would increase further
  still in future. “We’re all asking ourselves, how much worse can it get?” said
  Karl Mallon, XDI’s head of science and technology. “According to our latest
  analysis, a lot.”
