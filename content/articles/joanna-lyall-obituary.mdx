  During her long journalistic career, my friend Joanna Lyall, who has died aged
  76, challenged preconceptions about what people with cancer needed to know
  about their illness. She also raised awareness about health and social issues
  such as bereavement, child carers and living with chronic illness. In the mid
  1980s, when she proposed a book to enable people with cancer to make informed
  decisions about their care, patient-focused information was limited. In Living
  With Cancer (1987), which we co-authored, Joanna dug deep into the emotional,
  social and financial challenges, and told the human story of cancer through
  patient experiences with her trademark compassion. Born in Pimlico, central
  London, to Joan (nee Kenny) and Robert Lyall, an advertising executive, Joanna
  attended Our Lady of Sion Convent, in Bayswater, and later studied English and
  French at University College Dublin. After working for the Kensington Post and
  the Western Daily Press in Bristol, Joanna joined General Practitioner (GP) in
  1977, before turning freelance in 1980. By subsequently writing for both
  healthcare users, in newspapers such as the Guardian and Sunday Times, and
  care providers in GP, Nursing Times and the Health Service Journal, Joanna
  took her message about the need for jargon-free communication, shared decision
  making, and both specialist and community-based care, to a wide audience.
  Joanna had strong French roots; an aunt was in the French Resistance during
  the second world war, and an uncle helped run an escape line across occupied
  France. Another uncle, Desmond Knox-Leet, co-founded Diptyque, which Joanna
  saw grow from a small shop in Paris in the 1960s to a global luxury perfume
  brand. From 2010 to 2020, Joanna was honorary secretary of the Pugin Society
  and, through her writing, highlighted the significance of Pugin in
  19th-century architecture and design. Her genuine interest in other people’s
  lives led her into obituary writing for the Guardian and the British Medical
  Journal. When diagnosed with pancreatic cancer earlier this year, Joanna
  refused to ask: “Why me?” and said she didn’t feel “shortchanged in the
  longevity stakes”. Like many of the people she had interviewed nearly four
  decades earlier, her request was for effective symptom control and her
  long-held belief in the importance of good palliative care proved justified.
  Joanna was a much loved friend to a large circle of people. She is survived by
  her brother, Michael, her nieces, Alexandra and Katharine, her great-niece,
  Julia, and great-nephews, George and László.
