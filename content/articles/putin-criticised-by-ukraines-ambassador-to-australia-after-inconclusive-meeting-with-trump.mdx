  Vladimir Putin remains determined to “revive the Soviet Union” by “destroying
  democracy next door”, Ukraine’s ambassador to Australia has said in the wake
  of the Russian president’s inconclusive meeting with the US president, Donald
  Trump. Putin and Trump met for nearly three hours in Alaska, emerging to tell
  reporters that “great progress” had been made on a deal to end Russia’s war on
  Ukraine but that there was no peace agreement. “There’s no deal until there’s
  a deal,” Trump said, saying he would brief Nato leaders and Ukraine’s
  president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on the meeting. Putin, through an interpreter,
  said while he agreed Ukraine’s security should be guaranteed insisted the
  “root causes” of the conflict must be resolved. Speaking to the ABC in the
  wake of the meeting, Ukraine’s ambassador to Australia Vasyl Myroshnychenko
  said the root cause of the conflict from Putin’s perspective was a sovereign,
  independent and democratic Ukraine. “When Putin talks about the ‘root cause of
  war’, it’s an independent Ukraine on the map of Europe. That’s the only cause
  of war for Russia. “He planned to take over Kyiv in several days, the entire
  Ukraine in several weeks … he is pursuing his ambition of destroying democracy
  next door.” Putin had given no indication he was prepared to withdraw from his
  irredentist ambitions, Myroshnychenko said. “Putin is just out there on his
  mission to revive the Soviet Union, to revive the Russian empire, and it can’t
  be revived without Ukraine. Just overnight, as we speak, Russians have
  attacked many Ukrainian cities, sent many drones. So we don’t really see any
  indication of him ending his war.” Sign up: AU Breaking News email
  Myroshnychenko said while it was a positive step that the meeting had taken
  place, a bilateral discussion – with only the US and Russia at the table –
  could not broker a sustainable peace. “We welcome America’s involvement in
  this to make sure this war can end, but we understand it can’t end without
  Ukraine involved, without Europe involved … we can’t discuss the security of
  Europe without Europe at the table.” In Anchorage, Alaska, Trump and Putin’s
  planned one-on-one meeting was replaced by a three-on-three meeting that also
  included US secretary of state Marco Rubio and Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff on
  the American side. Alongside Putin was Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei
  Lavrov, and foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov, a former ambassador to the US.
  After the meeting, the two presidents addressed reporters but took no
  questions. The Russian president spoke first, urging both countries to “turn
  the page” on their fraught relationship and “go back to cooperation”. He said
  he and Trump had worked out “an understanding” but no final agreement and
  urged European leaders to “not throw a wrench in the works” and to “not use
  backroom dealings” to undermine the progress that had been made. “I have every
  reason to believe that moving down this path we can come – and the sooner the
  better – to the end of the conflict in Ukraine.” But Putin also insisted that
  the “root causes” of the conflict must be resolved. Those “root causes” have
  previously included demands for Ukraine’s formal renunciation of Nato
  membership as well as its “denazification” – an ill-defined set of demands
  that include the removal of Zelenskyy as president. The US president, who
  spoke more briefly than Putin, described the meeting as “extremely
  productive”. Trump warned: “There’s no deal until there’s a deal. I will call
  up Nato … I’ll, of course, call up [Ukraine’s] president Zelenskyy and tell
  him about today’s meeting. It’s ultimately up to them.” The chair of the
  Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations, Kateryna Argyrou, said Putin
  went to Alaska with “nothing to offer except more war”. “No ceasefire, no
  retreat from his maximalist demands … even as discussions were taking place,
  Russian missiles and drones were raining down on Ukrainian cities and towns.”
  Argyrou said Putin only wanted Ukraine’s surrender, not peace. “His recycled
  propaganda about ‘root causes’ is simply code for denying Ukraine’s right to
  exist as a sovereign, independent nation – a denial made real through the
  devastation Ukrainians face every day. “There can be no lasting peace until
  Russia faces the truth: Ukraine is a sovereign nation.” Argyrou urged
  Australia to “stay united” with allies in backing Ukraine’s defence and
  enforcing sanctions against Russian figures.
