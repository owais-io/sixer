  Turbo Tufan strikes again. It’s almost becoming predictable. Every time Tufan
  Erginbilgiç, chief executive of Rolls-Royce, sets “midterm” financial targets,
  the aero-engine maker beats them, or looks set to do so, in no time. Back in
  February, Erginbilgiç was able to declare that the 2027 targets for operating
  profits would be hit two years early, so he set new ambitions for 2028. Six
  months on, even the refreshed numbers look conservative. After a strong
  first-half, Rolls now thinks it will make £3.1bn-£3.2bn of operating profit
  over the whole of 2025, or about £300m more than previously advertised. At the
  current rate of rapid progress, it looks a short hop to £3.6bn-£3.9bn in 2028.
  The shares rose 8% and touched £11 for the first time. Three years ago the
  price was about £1. A business that required a £2bn rescue rights issue in the
  pre-vaccine depths of the pandemic in 2020, is now the fifth largest company
  in the FTSE 100 index and valued at £90bn. Naturally, Erginbilgiç’s
  share-based “golden hello” has followed in lock-step. To lure him from the
  private equity sector, he got £7.5m-worth of Rolls shares when they were 91p
  in January 2023. That package is now worth a cool £90m, albeit locked up in
  tranches until 2027 and 2028 (a reassuring detail from the point of view of
  shareholders). The story of how it has been done is well known by now, even if
  the pace continues to surprise. Erginbilgiç reorganised Rolls’ top management,
  removed a layer of costs, culled wasteful sidelines and, critically, invested
  in the reliability of the engines to allow a “win-win” renegotiation of
  contracts with airlines. Rolls, a company famed for years for falling short on
  cash generation, is now churning out the stuff. Meanwhile, markets everywhere
  are helpful. Demand for civil engines has fully recovered from the pandemic.
  The Aukus submarine partnership, where Rolls supplies the propulsion systems,
  underpinned the defence side even before Nato governments pledged to spend
  more on heavy equipment. Even the unloved power systems division has been
  knocked into shape in time for the age of datacentres that require backup
  generators. So the next question is whether the news can get any better. Can
  Erginbilgiç possibly maintain the pace? Well, there are two reasons to take
  seriously his talk about “substantial growth prospects beyond the midterm”.
  One is the bet on small modular reactors, or SMRs. It is still early days but
  the UK has ordered three and the Czech Republic six, so we will eventually
  discover whether these scaled-down nuclear plants can be built on time and on
  budget. If the answer is yes, then possibilities open up. Like the Czechs, the
  rest of eastern and central Europe probably wants a cost-efficient alternative
  to Russian gas. Power-hungry “hyperscale” datacentres in the US represent
  another set of potential customers. The SMR unit will be “profitable and
  cashflow positive by 2030”, said Erginbilgiç. Before that date, we may be
  asking what the operation would be worth as a spunoff, separately listed
  company – Rolls has a 62% stake at the moment. The other potential biggie is
  engines for narrow-body aircraft. Rolls is currently exclusively widebody, but
  its UltraFan development engine is intended to be capable of being adapted for
  both markets. The enormous costs mean Rolls would need a partner (the City’s
  guess is Pratt &amp; Whitney), a committed airline customer and would probably
  demand government support. But the narrow market is much larger than the wide
  one – it could be genuinely transformative for Rolls. A cynical view says
  something always goes wrong at Rolls sooner or later, which was the experience
  over a couple of decades of false dawns. If there is a difference this time,
  it is that the company is finally producing heaps of cash, which is the real
  measure of success in its business. Don’t mess it up: the UK engineering
  sector needs a reliable world-leader.
