  Dubai is on everyone’s lips. One side of social media salivates over its
  curated opulence. The other sneers at a city that has become a byword for
  excess. Barely a week goes by without the British press telling the story of
  somebody moving to Dubai for lower taxes or, conversely, that the “Dubai dream
  is dead”. The city-state benefits from this discourse-fuelled soft power. It
  strikes both the haves and have-notes. Dubai fever is democratic. The city is
  an El Dorado of the east for remittance-sending strivers, sun-seeking expats
  and scammers. For many, it represents an unsettling post-western horizon. A
  version of the future that is already here. Rows of supercars overlooking
  glittering marinas. Toothy-grinned influencers, crypto bros and aspiring
  entrepreneurs crowding the same clubs. Labubus dangling from designer
  handbags. We’re enamoured of this cliche of Dubai, a historyless slab of a
  place, where the right price can buy you anything and anyone. But behind this
  binary view is another way of looking at Dubai – a place that is much more
  interesting and unusual than is often understood. The city’s past and present
  is often reduced to the 2 sq km of downtown Dubai, where visitors congregate.
  This is the centre of luxury, where records are made to be broken. It is a
  panorama of lavish hotels and flashy restaurants, with the Burj Khalifa, the
  world’s tallest building, providing an apt backdrop. This image may be a
  defining one, but it says very little about the mundane joys and pains of life
  in Dubai. I remember visiting an industrial district to attend a poetry
  reading organised by a collective of young Dubai-based Filipinos. Their work
  grappled with the oddities of second-generation life. What does belonging mean
  when it isn’t enshrined by citizenship? How do you build a foundation on
  shifting sands? These locals spoke from within an intensely stratified society
  in which identities are both fixed and surprisingly porous. Dubai is the
  natural habitat of the “third culture kid”. Everywhere, you overhear the
  chameleonic lilt of international school accents. As a Londoner, I speak to
  Dubai-raised Somalis and recognise the bruised tenderness with which they
  describe their city. You don’t get to choose your home town. The heart is
  ungovernable. Today expats make up 85% of Dubai’s population. Through their
  businesses, schools, cultural centres and social clubs, various diasporas
  assert their presence. The city hosts the largest Malayali community outside
  India. Iranian art dealers rub shoulders with Afghan handymen. A Lebanese
  property developer shares little more than a language with the underpaid north
  African waiter taking their order. A decade-deep, Sudanese middle class
  thrives in the very country that is inflaming Sudan’s continuing civil war.
  Dubai is home to generations of immigrants who have sought shelter and
  opportunity. Their children face the challenge of reclamation. It has also
  long been a transit hub, connecting travellers to motherlands that weren’t
  properly served by European or North American airlines. (Emirates, the
  flag-carrier airline, savvily capitalised on this, furiously expanding
  throughout the 1990s and 2000s.) For many, Dubai came to represent hazy
  layovers and family reunions. Sheer necessity introduced outsiders to the
  city. Others, including me, visited extended family members who resided in the
  emirate. The Dubai we encountered was one of polyglot haggling, stuffed
  suitcases and relentless change. Each layover, each summer, revealed a
  dramatically transformed city, with towering additions to its skyline. This
  was the city as pure id, a glittering “urban spectacle” as the scholar Yasser
  Elsheshtawy put it. Coining the term “Dubaization”, Elsheshtawy named the
  hyperreal extravagance of the city’s urban landscape, an aggressive,
  cash-flush development model that has become a global blueprint. Dubai leads,
  often to where we would rather not follow. Later, as an adult, my trips to the
  city were defined by work. For a brief spell I lived in Al Raffa, a bustling
  old neighbourhood. The Dubai I found this time embraced its jostling
  contradictions. In the Deira district, I shared a platter of Tamil food with a
  Nigerian film-maker, who recommended a local Ethiopian hairdresser. At a
  rooftop bar crammed with rowdy South Africans, I met a Somali-American flight
  attendant recovering from a nervous breakdown. We laughed at the absurdity of
  seeking stability in a place as transient as Dubai. On another trip, an
  Ethiopian millennial detailed the humiliations she endured when renewing her
  residency visa. She had lived in Dubai for most of her life, and had no
  intention of leaving. I had been aware of the other Dubai, the metropolis
  behind the myth, but these conversations still disarmed me. The city is
  attracting a different class of newcomers, those who had never expected to
  settle there. Dubai has always been a cosmopolitan place – Baloch traders have
  settled there for centuries, seafaring Emiratis spoke Hindi and the Indian
  rupee was a local currency well into the 1960s. And there’s nothing new about
  Britons flocking to a part of the world, the Persian Gulf, that was shaped by
  British imperialism. As a sheikhdom, Dubai was one of the Trucial States, part
  of Britain’s informal empire in the Persian Gulf from the early 19th century
  to 1971. No amount of historical amnesia will change that. The British expat
  is a stock character of the 20th-century oil boom, with British people working
  as engineers, administrators, technicians and educators. The “Jumeirah Jane”
  stereotype was born in that era, a term referring to the leisurely wives of
  expats who spent their afternoons by the pool. Repelled by Britain’s broken
  social contract, many of today’s young professionals idealise the tax-free
  plushness of Dubai life. (It’s worth noting that the confectionery craze Dubai
  chocolate was invented by a British-Egyptian woman based in the city.) In my
  own circles, Dubai became a refuge for working-class graduates who felt
  disproportionately victimised by years of austerity. Their careers flourished
  in the Gulf, and their passports guarded them against the worst forms of
  exploitation. For once, they had the upper hand. But the west has a habit of
  hoarding complexity for itself. The rest of the world is rendered
  one-dimensional, a vulgar composite of tropes. This lack of curiosity extends
  even to the migrant labourer, the quintessential symbol of abjection in the
  Gulf. We live in a time where domestic workers in the United Arab Emirates
  chronicle their daily lives on TikTok, responding to the comments of
  interested viewers. For those who are looking, there has never been greater
  access to the hopes and struggles of low-wage migrants. Contemporary Gulf
  literature breathes life into stories often reduced to statistics. The
  children of the city’s labourers are now writing about their parents’
  struggles. Dubai Puzha by Krishnadas, Tania Malik’s Hope You Are Satisfied and
  Deepak Unnikrishnan’s Temporary People depict the modern Gulf metropolis with
  humanity and humour. Dubai-set Malayalam dramas and films portray migrants
  scrimping and saving, finding camaraderie along the way. Cinema continues to
  take a sweeping view of the migrant experience, with films such as Deira
  Diaries (2021) tracing four decades in the life of a Keralan expat. Such
  narratives peel away the person from the occupation. Migrant workers become
  more than objects of pity. Prickly, lovelorn, shrewd, pragmatic; we are
  increasingly exposed to their inner lives. When it comes to the Singapores,
  Dubais and Shenzhens of the world, a certain kind of inattentiveness plagues
  those opining from the west. It’s easier to tell half the story, to bat away
  complexity. Peer into the crush of glass and sweat, dreams and desperation.
  Dubai is a funhouse mirror. You’ll see what you want to see. Momtaza Mehri is
