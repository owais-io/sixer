  The figures in Jean-François Millet’s 1859 painting The Angelus, a French icon
  that’s come to the UK on loan from the Musée d’Orsay in Paris, seem extremely
  odd on close inspection. Their faces are obscure, their bodies intriguing
  under their shapeless work clothes. What age are they? How are they related?
  The man is quite young, his top shirt button loose, although his legs are as
  stiff as a doll’s, inside thick, rough-cut trousers. It’s harder to tell the
  woman’s age because she stands in profile, a breeze pressing her heavy skirt
  against her legs, as she clasps her hands. They might be a married couple or,
  as this painting’s unlikely fan Salvador Dalí claimed, mother and son. Their
  physicality is intense. The phallic prongs of a thick wooden potato fork and
  wheelbarrow shafts add to the feeling that, now the working day is done and
  they’re saying their prayers, they can finally get to bed. But if they’re
  mother and son? I refer you to Dr Dalí. I think there’s a reason Millet makes
  The Angelus not so much a religious as an erotic landscape. It was the climax
  of his love affair with the French peasantry. Millet made it his life’s work
  to portray the rural poor – a class that had been denied full humanity. He
  depicts lives of backbreaking toil but wants you to see that, behind the hoe,
  is a human being with a mind, a body, desires. Landscape artists often can’t
  draw the human figure for toffee: that means you, Constable and Turner. But
  Millet foregrounds the body in stark existential moments of sweaty action.
  Work that in reality must have been repetitive and mindless becomes full of
  heroic drama. In The Winnower, a man throws grains in the air in a golden mist
  to separate the wheat from the chaff. Painted at the time of the 1848
  revolutions, when liberal and socialist risings were shaking the wheat from
  the chaff across Europe, the winnower is, you realise, wearing a reddish-pink
  bandana, a white shirt and has a blue handkerchief – the colours of the
  tricolour flag that the first French Revolution invented. Millet’s a
  revolutionary and his people have plenty to rebel against. In The Sower, a man
  is sowing seeds in a deep gully: it looks as if he has descended into hell.
  This pit looks completely barren yet here he is, sowing seeds anyway, the
  symbolism as hard to ignore as the arses of the two cows that loom against the
  stormy sky above him. His act may be that of a political campaigner, sowing
  seeds of change, yet it’s also an image of artistic creativity. The character
  could be Millet himself, creating something beautiful out of the brutal
  realities of rural toil. His autobiography is compacted into this small show.
  Millet was a country boy from Normandy. His painting The Well at Gruchy
  captures the world he grew up in – a woman fills pots of water from a
  stone-roofed well that appears to be centuries old. Life is slow there, in
  Gruchy, and history a massive, immobile presence. The Faggot Gatherers, which
  Millet was working on up to 1875, looks like a riposte to the impressionists’
  emphasis on modernity and middle-class pleasures on boulevards and in cafes.
  Women lug bundles of sticks through Stygian winter gloom in a scene that could
  just as easily have been in the 1370s as the 1870s. He found one fan looking
  desperately for soul in the world. Vincent van Gogh wanted to emulate Millet
  as a peasant painter. You see their deep connection in Millet’s drawing A Man
  Ploughing and Another Sowing. As the broken-looking sower stumbles in the
  foreground and a ploughman hunches behind him, a flock of black crows rise
  into the sky – like the birds Van Gogh would see over the wheatfield near the
  end of his life. Yet for all his brooding compassion, you can’t miss Millet’s
  turbulent sexuality. The two athletic men in his painting The Wood Sawyers
  look as if they are cutting up a giant penis. Then again, the slices of trunk
  also resemble freshly butchered meat – another one for Dalí. More
  conventionally sexualised are Millet’s portraits of shepherdesses and
  milkmaids. His painting The Goose Girl at Gruchy may be as much a memory of
  adolescent longings as a painting from life. Van Gogh in a frenzied letter
  claims Millet’s women are as sexy as Zola’s – you can see how he got to this
  and how much Millet’s fascination with the silent passions of country people
  has in common with Thomas Hardy’s novels. It all comes together in The
  Angelus, which you keep coming back to after scanning his other works. The
  scene it immortalises is ancient, the lives these people lived largely lost to
  history. Millet freezes them like statues. They grow like grass from the hard
  earth that can’t wait to take them back. • Millet: Life on the Land is at the
  National Gallery, London, from 7 August to 19 October
