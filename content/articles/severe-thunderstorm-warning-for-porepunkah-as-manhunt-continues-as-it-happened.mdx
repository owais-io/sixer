  What we learned, Friday 29 August Thanks for staying with us this week. We are
  wrapping up the live blog here. This is what made the news today: Blizzards
  and destructive winds will batter Victoria’s north-east, including the town of
  Porepunkah, home to alleged cop killer Dezi Freeman. The manhunt for Freeman
  has continued, with 450 police deployed to Porepunkah. Federal government
  minister Murray Watt said parliament will “obviously” consider censuring Bob
  Katter for threatening to punch a journalist. Katter’s son, Robbie Katter, has
  accused the journalist of failing to read social cues when referencing
  Katter’s Lebanese heritage, which he said had a “deeply personal dimension”.
  The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and the Victorian premier, Jacinta
  Allan, have been heckled over their climate change policies at the News Corp
  bush summit in Ballarat. Comedian and radio presenter Dave Hughes has been
  hospitalised with five broken ribs and a punctured lung after participating in
  the AFL Legends Game, a charity match raising funds for prostate cancer
  research. Guardian Australia reporters will keep you updated on the Porepunkah
  manhunt and the rest of the country’s breaking news over the weekend before
  parliament resumes next week. Australian shares edge lower to finish wild
  earning season The Australian share market has edged modestly lower on the
  last day of a volatile month of company earnings results. The benchmark ASX200
  index on Friday slipped slightly to 8,973 points, after spending a week below
  the 9,000-point record it broke last Thursday. It has risen about 3% in the
  last month after valuations of major companies swung wildly on the release of
  financial results for the year to June. Medical manufacturer CSL lost nearly a
  third of its value on the day its results were released, while building
  materials company James Hardie lost nearly a fifth of its market
  capitalisation. Woolworths dropped 15% when it reported its earnings on
  Wednesday, which AAP reported was its worst single-day selloff since 1994.
  Daniel Andrews and Bob Carr invited to China’s military parade The Chinese
  government has invited former Labor premiers Daniel Andrews and Bob Carr to
  attend a Tiananmen Square military celebration next week. Carr and Andrews
  were the only Australian invitations mentioned by China’s assistant foreign
  minister, Hong Lei, before next week’s commemoration of the country’s victory
  against Japan at the end of the second world war. Xi Jinping is expected to
  address the military parade, with Russia’s Vladimir Putin, North Korea’s Kim
  Jong-un, Indonesia’s Prabowo Subianto and the president of Iran among the 26
  world leaders expected to attend. Serving heads of state and prime ministers
  from south, south-east and central Asia, eastern Europe, Cuba, the Congo and
  Zimbabwe are expected to join them, according to Hong’s statement, circulated
  by China’s foreign affairs ministry. Carr and Andrews were among a string of
  former politicians invited, including former prime ministers of New Zealand,
  Japan, Greece and Italy. Read more about the parade here: Bradman’s baggy
  green snapped up by museum A historic baggy green cap worn by Sir Donald
  Bradman has found a new home at one Australia’s most prominent museums, AAP
  reports. The cap, worn during the 1946-47 Ashes series, has been bought by the
  National Museum of Australia for $438,500, with the federal government
  contributing half the cost. Bradman wore the cap when he captained Australia
  in the series, the first to be played against England after the second world
  war. The cap is just one of 11 of Bradman’s baggy greens known to exist. A
  second is located in the Australian Sports Museum, while the locations of the
  other nine remain private. The cap sits alongside other Bradman memorabilia in
  the museum’s most recently opened Landmarks gallery, which features pieces
  from defining moments in our nation’s history. Blizzards and ‘destruction’
  forecast for Victoria’s weekend weather Blizzards have been forecast for parts
  of Victoria, and residents have been warned to prepare for power outages and
  “destruction” as damaging winds are expected to lash the south-eastern states
  into the weekend. Destructive winds, with gusts reaching up to 130km/h, are
  expected to push further into the eastern states on Saturday, bringing
  showers, hail and isolated thunderstorms. Snowfall as low as 600-metre
  elevation is expected in the state on Saturday, along with strong winds.
  Meanwhile, blizzard conditions have been forecast for the alpine areas above
  1,200 metres. Snow showers and possible small hail was forecast for Friday and
  early Saturday morning at Mount Hotham. It comes after a week of severe
  weather in Victoria’s high country that has added complications to the search
  for suspected gunman Dezi Freeman in Porepunkah. Winds of up to 113km/h had
  already been recorded at Mount Hotham on Friday. Read more here: Labor defends
  axing Indigenous affairs hearing with extra estimates days Just circling back
  to an earlier post about the axing of a stand-alone Indigenous affairs hearing
  from the upcoming block of Senate estimates hearings. A stand-alone hearing
  earmarked for 13 October has been wiped from the schedule, with scrutiny of
  Indigenous matters to instead occur over the other days of hearings from 7-10
  October. The opposition claims the change means there will be less clear air
  to grill the government’s record on Indigenous affairs, including the Closing
  the Gap targets. While defending the decision, a government spokesperson
  pointed out it had agreed to an extra three days of senate estimates hearings
  later this year to allow for more scrutiny of its entire agenda. The hearings
  are scheduled for the first week of December. Here’s the government’s
  statement in full: The Government has agreed to add three extra days of Senate
  estimates at the end of the year, to allow for additional scrutiny. In this
  round of supplementary budget estimates, Indigenous issues will be a part of
  every day of estimates. Closing the Gap is a whole of government
  responsibility. It’s the responsibility of every Secretary and Minister to
  improve outcomes for First Nations Australians. Albanese government minister
  Murray Watt says Bob Katter could still face a formal censure in parliament
  next week after the independent MP threatened to punch a journalist. Watt did
  not commit the government to pursuing a censure motion against Katter but said
  he personally condemned the veteran Queensland politician’s outburst. He told
  the ABC: I’m not going to pre-empt the parliamentary processes, [censure] will
  obviously be considered, but Bob Katter has prided himself on being a
  colourful character, you can be a colourful character without threatening
  people … It is completely unacceptable for any human being, let alone a
  politician, who should be setting a higher standard. Allegra Spender, the
  independent Sydney MP, said her focus was more on public statements of
  condemnation, and she hadn’t considered censuring Katter, speaking on the
  ABC’s Afternoon Briefing. Katter’s son, Robbie Katter, appeared on the ABC
  earlier, where he defended his father and said a censure motion would be
  celebrated by north Queenslanders. He said: Most people in regional and North
  Queensland would see that as an endorsement. A lot of things that come out of
  Canberra and Brisbane we are not a big fan of, so personally I would see it as
  an endorsement. Watt rejects criticism of Tasmania windfarm approval The
  environment minister has dismissed Bob Brown’s warnings of major protests over
  the approval of a large windfarm project on Robbins Island in north-west
  Tasmania. Environmental advocates have warned the project could threaten local
  native wildlife, including the orange-bellied parrot, the Tasmanian devil and
  the Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle. You can read about the decision here: The
  environment minister, Murray Watt, said the conditions attached to the
  development would safeguard against those “unacceptable impacts”. He told the
  ABC: The surest way to ensure we end up with a more critically endangered
  species in this country is if we fail to deliver the renewable energy and
  emissions reductions needed … If we take a really hardline view about this we
  will not have renewable projects anywhere in the country. Among the project’s
  critics is former Greens leader Bob Brown, who has warned of major protests
  against the development. Watt dismissed suggestions of public uprising: We
  often see predictions from the Greens and their supporters like Bob Brown that
  don’t turn out to be truthful … and Brown has a history of opposing major
  economic development across the country. The Queensland state politician
  Robbie Katter has defended his father for threatening to punch a journalist,
  saying the reporter “did not get the signals”. Bob Katter has attracted
  criticism from across the political spectrum for his behaviour, but his son
  Robbie said there were personal reasons for his father getting upset. He told
  the ABC: I know for a fact there are some deeply personal, deep personal
  dimension to that line of questioning that goes back to his family. I’ve known
  that since a kid. … There is a deeply personal dimension that I won’t share on
  national TV. The younger Katter said it had been clear his father was growing
  agitated and suggested the reporter, Nine’s Josh Bavas, was being
  “provocative”: There are personal touch points that [we] usually agree on that
  we don’t go there. Perhaps the journalist in question did not get the signals.
  … We should be able to stand up for ourselves and say at some point that is
  not acceptable. At what point is that person responsible for their actions?
  They have to take some cues as well. Pushing back at suggestions Bob Katter
  was too old for parliament, Robbie said some serving politicians were “too
  young” and had a “deficit of life experience”. The Bureau of Meteorology has
  issued an emergency warning for severe thunderstorms in Victoria’s northeast,
  including the town of Porepunkah, where the manhunt for Dezi Freeman
  continues. Damaging and destructive winds are expected to batter the
  north-east and east Gippsland, with the worst of the storms expected to hit
  Falls Creek and Mount Hotham, just south of the locked-down town. Winds and
  storms will last for the next several hours across the state’s north-east, the
  bureau said, after previously warning snow showers could hit the region. The
  search for Freeman now involves 450 police officers, as temperatures begin to
  fall and the sun sets. Lending rises at the fastest rate in three years
  Private credit growth surged by nearly $20bn in July, or 0.7% in the previous
  month, the fastest pace of increase since 2022. New Reserve Bank data shows
  lending has accelerated since the RBA cut interest rates a second time, with
  the annual pace of increase climbing to 7.2%, well above the last decade’s
  average. UBS analysis indicated business lending saw the biggest increase,
  while personal credit picked up, and housing credit maintained its faster
  growth of recent months. Private deposits have also increased 7.2% annually,
  including a 9.4% increase in household savings, while spending has picked up
  at the same time, which UBS analysts said was a sign of “solid” household
  income growth. They warned that rising borrowing for house prices and personal
  spending could put upward pressure on inflation as construction resources
  become stretched and homeowners cash in on their rising wealth, writing in a
  note: We see an increasing likelihood that the strength in asset prices,
  especially housing, and borrowing (also personal credit is picking up to fund
  consumption), will probably result in inflation facing upward pressure. And
  that’s it from me, the wonderful Luca Ittimani is here to take you through the
  rest of the afternoon’s news! Pill testing clinic to reopen in Queensland
  Queensland’s pill testing clinic is to reopen next month, thanks to private
  funding. In April 2024, the former Labor government opened the first of two
  clinics at Bowen Hills. A second was later opened on the Gold Coast. A year
  later, the new LNP government closed both, against the advice of health
  bodies, including the Australian Medical Association. It has subsequently
  refused to release a report on the trial service. Former operator The Loop
  Australia announced on Friday morning that it will reopen its doors from
  Friday, 5 September, and continue to operate every Friday from 2-6pm. The
  Greens MP Michael Berkman said the return of pill testing was “a massive win
  for common sense and for our health professionals”. You can’t stop people
  taking drugs just by saying no, by locking up kids or slapping them with huge
  fines. In their first year, these clinics identified 120 lethal substances and
  kickstarted hundreds of conversations and referrals with health professionals.
  Opposition says Indigenous hearings could have examined why four Closing the
  Gap targets going backwards Continuing on from that last post: in the Senate
  on Thursday, the opposition attempted to reinstate the separate hearings only
  for Labor and the Greens to vote it down. The manager of opposition business
  in the senate, Jonno Duniam, accused Labor and the Greens of breaking a
  17-year-old convention in order to avoid scrutiny. Senate estimates hearings
  are a critical forum for senators to question the spending of taxpayer funds
  and hold the government to account. Yet, rather than opening themselves to
  that accountability, Labor and the Greens have conspired to shut them down.
  The shadow minister for Indigenous Australians, Kerrynne Liddle, said the
  opposition would have used the hearings to examine why four of the Closing the
  Gap targets were going backwards. In a statement, a government spokesperson
  said under the new format, Indigenous affairs would be examined on each day of
  hearings, rather than just one. They said: Closing the Gap is a whole of
  government responsibility. It’s the responsibility of every Secretary and
  Minister to improve outcomes for First Nations Australians. The next round of
  estimates will be on 7-10 October. Labor accused of avoiding scrutiny on
  Indigenous affairs after stand-alone hearing axed The opposition has accused
  the Albanese government of avoiding scrutiny of its Indigenous affairs agenda
  after axing a traditional stand-alone estimates hearing on the topic. Hearings
  on Indigenous matters have typically been held in a stand-alone spot in each
  Senate estimates block, providing a window of clear air for opposition and
  crossbenchers to grill government ministers and senior public servants on
  issues such as Closing the Gap targets. On the other days of an estimates
  week, the eight committees run hearings at the same time, generating a flood
  of evidence that can be difficult for even the most diligent politician,
  staffer (or journalist) to keep across. But in a surprise move, Labor this
  week won support for a condensed schedule for October’s rounds of estimates,
  which involves folding Indigenous affairs into the other packed days of
  hearings. A stand-alone hearing on the Murray Darling-Basin plan – which is
  also typically allocated its own window – has also been absorbed into the new
  schedule. That’s all from me, thanks for sticking with us. Natasha May will be
  your guide for the rest of today’s news. Take care, and have a good weekend.
  Penny Wong condemns Russian strikes on Kyiv The foreign affairs minister,
  Penny Wong, condemned Russian strikes on Kyiv yesterday after the Ukrainian
  city came under heavy attack. At least 21 people were killed, and the strikes
  damaged the city’s British Council and EU offices. Four children were among
  the dead. Wong said in a statement: Russia’s strikes on homes, civilian
  infrastructure and diplomatic premises are reprehensible. The people of
  Ukraine have the right to live in peace, free from fear and aggression.
  Australia again calls on Russia to end its illegal and immoral war. The Sydney
  marathon is this weekend: what time does it start, which roads will be closed,
  and what is the route? A record 35,000 runners and upwards of 300,000
  spectators are to converge on a new 42.195km marathon course that shows off
  Sydney on Sunday. It’s the first time the city will be part of the exclusive
  club of “major” world marathons, alongside Tokyo, Boston, London, Berlin,
  Chicago and New York – and runners are in for a treat. Here’s a list of
  need-to-know info and best practices for Sunday, whether you’re running
  yourself or cheering someone on: Manhunt remains ‘number one priority’ as
  Victoria police plan to deploy ‘large resource’ at weekend’s anti-immigration
  protest, Bush says Bush says the police’s “number one priority” is the hunt
  for Freeman, but that this weekend’s planned anti-immigration “March for
  Australia” protests will also add to the demand on the force. Bush said: I
  would like to say, here and now, that the number one priority for the Victoria
  police is the hunt for this [alleged] murderer. And we’re pouring in over 450
  resources to that. And every other resource we have. We’re also conscious that
  the Victoria police have many other demands. And that includes the protest
  activity this weekend. Our mission there will be to deploy a large resource …
  to ensure that those people that are out protesting peacefully are kept safe.
  So that, too, is a priority. And we will resource it. And we will resource the
  other demands. But I want to go back to my original point: the number one
  priority for the Victoria police is to find the person who [allegedly]
  murdered our officers. Mike Bush confirms Dezi Freeman’s partner was arrested
  overnight. She was interviewed and released pending further inquiries. Bush
  said today: People were interviewed totally and specifically in relation to
  the homicide investigation. Those searches have been completed. The interviews
  have been conducted. Those people have been released. There may or may not be
  charges that follow. Police chief says locals in Porepunkah have been
  ‘fantastic’ during search for Freeman Mike Bush said police had received
  “helpful” lines of inquiry as they continue the manhunt for Freeman. He said:
  The locals have been fantastic. There are certain lines of inquiry that are
  coming in from the public that are being assessed. They’re all helpful. So we
  encourage members of the public to tell us everything they think they need to
  tell us … Police chief again appeals to suspect to turn himself in Mike Bush
  took a moment to address Freeman directly should he be listening to the press
  conference this afternoon: In fact, if that person is listening, it really is
  time to lay down your firearms and give yourself up. So that we can all bring
  this to a safe conclusion. More than 450 police officers involved in hunt for
  Dezi Freeman The chief commissioner of Victoria police, Mike Bush, said more
  than 450 police officers are involved in search for Dezi Freeman. Bush said
  the ongoing manhunt was part of a “very professional and coordinated
  operation”. Bush said during a press conference: We have over 450 police
  officers dedicated to this task. Some are involved in search, some are
  involved in investigations, some are involved in supporting and many are
  involved in community reassurance. New Zealand’s house prices are finally
  falling. Could this happen elsewhere? Three years ago, New Zealanders would
  have it found it almost impossible to imagine the country’s sky-high house
  prices falling. The market was deemed one of the least affordable in the
  world, with house prices nearly nine times the average income and supply
  dismally low. Desperate first home buyers were being squeezed out of the
  market by cashed-up investors. Some of those in low paid or no work were
  thrust into homelessness and waitlists for social housing ballooned. In
  mid-2021 the crisis reached fever pitch, with the national average house price
  exceeding NZ$1m. But now, those prices are trending downwards. Read more: Nine
  Entertainment is considering legal action against Bob Katter after the
  independent MP called Nine’s Queensland reporter Josh Bavas a racist and
  threatened to punch him at a press conference. The Brisbane outburst came
  after Katter expressed support for anti-immigration “March for Australia”
  protests planned for the weekend. Bavas asked: “You’ve got Lebanese heritage
  yourself … ”, before Katter cut him off. The member for Kennedy walked up to
  the Channel Nine reporter and shook his fist at him. “Don’t say that, because
  you’re a racist. You’re a racist. You cannot say what you just said without
  being identified as a racist … this man is a racist,” Katter said. The
  exchange was filmed. Nine executives were discussing taking defamation action
  against Katter, sources said. The company has demanded an apology from Katter.

  As Porepunkah braces for wild weather, the roadblock near the property where
  alleged gunman Dezi Freeman was living has been set up again. This is the
  third afternoon in a row that police have blocked off this part of the area.
  There is low cloud cover, and the helicopter, which usually flies overhead, is
  not around. It is unclear if they are currently searching in the area. Battin
  condemns planned anti-immigration ‘March for Australia’ rallies The Victorian
  opposition leader, Brad Battin, has put out a statement with his spokesperson
  for multicultural affairs, Evan Mulholland, condemning the anti-immigration
  “March for Australia” rallies planned for this weekend. The duo said they were
  particularly concerned about the “anti-Indian sentiment in some of the
  promotional material for the events published by the anonymous organisers”.
  Battin said: We condemn these rallies and the abhorrent messaging associated
  with them. Victoria is a proudly multicultural and multifaith state, and the
  Liberals and Nationals will always stand with all Victorians, no matter their
  background. Our state has been built on the contributions of generations of
  migrants who have made Victoria their home, and we are stronger for it. Any
  attempt to incite hatred or division against any community is completely
  unacceptable. Battin told ABC Radio Melbourne yesterday he had told his MPs
  they shouldn’t attend the rally. Windfarm project likely to face criticism
  from green groups and scientists Despite the conditions, the Robbins Island
  windfarm approval decision is likely to face criticism from environmentalists
  and scientists who have said the area should be a no-go zone site due to its
  environmental importance. Watt said the windfarm had the potential to reduce
  greenhouse gas emissions by 3.4m tonnes a year, equivalent to taking more than
  1m cars off the road each year. He said: There will obviously be some people
  who support [the decision and] some people who criticise it … The reality is
  we need more renewable energy being built in Australia to tackle the climate
  change challenge that we have. The key to that is that, in the approvals
  process, we put in place strong environmental protections to avoid and reduce
  environmental damage. That’s what I believe we’ve done with this decision.
  Watt said construction of the farm was not expected to commence until 2031. He
  said the project would support up to 350 direct jobs in construction and up to
  50 ongoing operational jobs. You can read more about the windfarm proposal
  from a recent story here: The federal environment minister, Murray Watt, has
  given the green light to the Robbins Island windfarm, a contentious and
  long-proposed development in north-west Tasmania that could lead to 100
  turbines being built in an area environmentalists say is a haven for migratory
  shorebirds and threatened species. Watt said he had approved the construction
  of the windfarm proposed by the renewable energy company Acen Australia, a
  bridge between the nearly 10,000 hectare island and the Tasmanian mainland
  wharf and four quarries. A decision on the windfarm had been repeatedly
  delayed. Watt said his approval came with strict conditions to protect the
  critically endangered orange-bellied parrot, endangered Tasmanian wedge-tailed
  eagle, protected migratory shorebirds and the Tasmanian devil. The conditions
  include a requirement the company: Conduct comprehensive parrot surveys for
  three years before construction. Provide funding for a Tasmanian government
  parrot conservation program. Develop and implement a bird and bat management
  plan to “evaluate, mitigate and manage the risk of turbine collision for
  threatened birds”. Watt said the plan may need to include “curtailment or
  shutdown of all or some turbines” at certain times. Install barriers to avoid
  Tasmanian devils from the mainland crossing to the island and potentially
  affecting the local disease-free population. Not build turbines within 1km of
  a wedge-tailed eagle nest. Heckling forces Jacinta Allan to stop midway
  through speech at bush summit The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has been
  forced to stop midway through her speech a the News Corp bush summit in
  Ballarat this morning due to loud booing and heckling from the crowd,
  including one man telling her to “fuck off”. She told the crowd: I could just
  request, I know there’s differences of views. One of the things that makes me
  proud of living in regional Victoria is I turn up and we turn up and listen
  and respect one another, and I simply ask, [that] I can conclude my remarks.
  But her pleas to “show the best of country Victoria” to those tuning in online
  were largely ignored. The loudest boos came as the premier spoke about her
  government’s support for renewable energy projects. During a Q and A segment,
  the Herald Sun’s Tom Minear was forced to repeatedly ask the crowd to quieten
  down. Asked whether there needed to be better consultation with landowners,
  Allan replied: One of the challenges we have in this discussion is there’s a
  lot of loud voices, but there’s also a lot of people who want the information.
  Out of respect to people who are seeking the information, they deserve to hear
  that, not just from politicians but from experts and advisers. One of the
  things that we need to do differently is better engage with landowners, and
  it’s why, whether it’s through the support that landowners can receive in
  hosting transmission lines on their property, whether it’s the compensation
  arrangements that are being made available. This is one of the challenges that
  we can have to work through these issues together. Allan appeared at the event
  immediately after prime minister, Anthony Albanese, who was also jeered by the
  crowd. Comedian and radio presenter Dave Hughes has been hospitalised with
  five broken ribs and a punctured lung after participating in the AFL Legends
  Game, a charity match raising funds for prostate cancer research. Hughes
  called in to Melbourne radio stations on Friday morning from his hospital bed,
  confirming he was severely injured and on strong painkillers but making light
  of his situation. He told Fox FM: I knew that when I slowed down, this was
  going to happen, but I didn’t realise to this extent. I was groaning in the
  morning. My wife said, we’ve got to go to the hospital. I said, I can’t get
  out of bed, can they come here? Reportedly the oldest person on the field,
  Hughes was playing for the Victorian team against the All Stars. He believed
  on-field collisions from Andrew Embley and Mitch Robinson were responsible for
  his injuries. He told Triple M: At half-time, I was coming off the ground and
  I was like, ‘I feel like I have a punctured lung’, and I was joking, but no, I
  do. Asked “who got you?”, Hughes said: Andrew Embley. Hodgey [Luke Hodge]
  kicked it to me, I dropped a chest mark – it was the lights, there’s too many
  lights at that ground – and Embley came in from the side. It was the first
  collision, and from that moment I was struggling. [Daniel] Gorringe slammed me
  in the ruck. Butler says any report of foiled potential hijacking plan ‘sends
  shivers down the spine’ Health minister Mark Butler said any report of a
  potential hijacking plan “sends shivers down the spine of every Australian”
  after the Australian reported yesterday on an allegedly foiled plot to take
  control of a commercial jet. Butler said he couldn’t comment on the specifics
  of the case, which is before the courts, but said there is no threat to the
  public. He spoke to Channel 7’s Sunrise this morning, saying: Obviously, any
  report of a potential hijacking sends shivers down the spine of every
  Australian, particularly Australians who fly. But I want to be very cautious
  about this. As you’ve reported … this alleged hijacker is in custody, so
  there’s no threat to the Australian community. But there’s a suppression order
  on this for very good reason. Investigations are still under way by our
  intelligence and security agencies, so we don’t want to speculate about other
  aspects of this issue. We want to let our agencies do their work and that will
  all come out in due course and be prosecuted in the normal way. Prime minister
  Anthony Albanese and Victorian premier Jacinta Allan have been heckled at the
  News Corp bush summit in Ballarat this morning, with participants strongly
  criticising and interrupting both leaders over their environmental and climate
  change policies. Albanese, responding to the heckling, said “I won’t bullshit
  people” as he backed in his government’s climate change and clean energy
  policies. The PM said: I understand some people have a different view, but
  what I won’t do is come and, out of convenience, say what is convenient and
  people want to hear. Albanese noted it was the former Morrison Coalition
  government that had adopted a net zero target. The crowd in Ballarat booed,
  laughed and jeered as Albanese talked about coal-fired power stations not
  stacking up economically. To loud opposition from the crowd, Albanese said:
  There hasn’t been a new coal fired power station started this century. That’s
  the truth. There’s been no regulation stopping that… It hasn’t happened
  because the market has determined it doesn’t stack up. The News Corp moderator
  at several points tried to calm the crowd, saying “please, audience” and
  “we’ll have to stop if you keep going”. Albanese had been criticised by the
  Greens for attending a separate bush summit event earlier in the week, calling
  it “climate disinformation spreader News Corp’s bush summit” and claiming the
  events “give a platform to some of the country’s most extreme and disturbing
  anti-net zero, anti-climate action rhetoric”. Star Entertainment Group posts
  $471m full-year loss Star Entertainment Group says it lost $471m last
  financial year and its soft trading conditions continued in July, AAP reports.
  The embattled casino group also disclosed on Friday it had $189m in available
  cash as of Monday, $45m less than it had as of 30 June, although that’s partly
  because it paid $16m in back taxes during that time. Star said it brought in
  $92.1m in revenue and incurred a $7.4m operating loss in July, slightly ahead
  of its June quarter average. “There remains material uncertainly regarding the
  group’s ability to continue as a going concern,” the company said, citing six
  items that are critical to its financial outlook. Among them is a looming
  money-laundering penalty from Austrac, Australia’s financial watchdog, which
  has proposed a fine of $400m; Star’s ability to restore its casino licenses;
  and completing a $300m investment from Bally’s and pub baron Bruce Mathieson.
  Victoria police set up designated area due to planned far-right protest
  Victoria police will set up a designated area across Melbourne’s CBD as they
  prepare for “violence” at a rightwing protest on Sunday. Supt Troy Papworth,
  from the north-west metro specialist operations unit at Victoria police, told
  ABC Radio Melbourne the entire CBD up to the Shrine of Remembrance will be
  declared a designated area under the Control of Weapons Act. This means
  officers can randomly stop and search anyone or their vehicle without a
  warrant or reasonable grounds. The designated area has been declared due to
  concern around some rightwing figures attending the protest near Flinders
  Street to “cause violence and mayhem”, Papworth said: In a week where we’ve
  lost two police officers … we are having to respond to protest intended to
  cause violence in the city. He says another planned pro-Palestine rally is
  also organised for the State Library. Organisers have been communicating with
  police and say they will avoid Flinders Street, but Papworth says he remains
  concerned there could be confrontation between the two groups. NSW police
  charged a man on Thursday over the alleged kidnapping and murder of a Sydney
  woman in April. Police said they responded to a home in the suburb of
  Bankstown in western Sydney on 17 April, where they were told a group of
  people had forced their way into a home before allegedly kidnapping the woman,
  45, and assaulting an eight-year-old boy with a baseball bat. The group, armed
  with a firearm, then allegedly forced the woman into an SUV. Later that day,
  emergency services responded to reports of a car fire, where they discovered
  the body of the woman inside. Police claim the woman and children were
  targeted over her partner’s alleged involvement with an organised crime group
  in Victoria. A man, 29, was arrested yesterday and charged with murder and
  wounding a person with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. He was refused
  bail and will appear before court later today. Police will alleged the
  29-year-old facilitated the alleged kidnapping and murder of the woman. PM
  downplays speculation over purpose of Marles’s US trip Anthony Albanese
  downplayed reports that Richard Marles’s much-debated trip to America was
  about locking in a meeting with Donald Trump. Albanese told Channel Nine: That
  wasn’t his job and it wasn’t his issue and I don’t think it was – I don’t know
  whether that was raised or not, but that’s not the reason why he goes. We have
  office-to-office communication and Ambassador Rudd is responsible for those
  issues. The prime minister wouldn’t say whether a meeting had finally been
  confirmed, only saying “when you see it on your screens, you’ll know it’s
  confirmed”. I’ll be certainly with President Trump a number of times between
  now and the end of the year. It’s summit season, which sounds glamorous but
  isn’t. You spend more time on a plane than you do on the land. And so we have
  a range of meetings, whether it’s the UN general assembly, Asean, Apec. So
  we’ll be running into each other regularly. And we’re just trying to finalise
  the Quad meeting as well. Bob Katter needs to ‘have a look at himself’, prime
  minister says Albanese also criticised Bob Katter’s explosive press conference
  yesterday where he threatened to punch a journalist who asked about his
  Lebanese heritage. He told Channel Nine: Bob Katter I like, but Bob Katter
  needs to have a look at that footage. Have a look at himself, frankly, and
  recognise that that’s just not what we expect of any Australian, let alone
  someone who’s in public office. You’re speaking to someone called Albanese.
  We’ve got a Senate leader called Wong. Migration enriches. Except for the
  First Australians, we’re all either migrants or descendants of them. Prime
  minister says government has offered ‘every support’ required in hunt for Dezi
  Freeman Anthony Albanese says federal authorities will give Victoria “every
  support that is required” to assist in the manhunt for Dezi Freeman in the
  Victorian high country. On Channel Nine’s Today show earlier, he confirmed the
  AFP’s elite tactical unit had joined the operation: What’s occurred here is
  that we have offered the premier, Jacinta Allan, every support that is
  required. This guy clearly is dangerous. He’s on the run and we want him
  caught and we want people who are traumatised in that northeast community of
  Victoria to feel safe again. The prime minister again paid tribute to the
  police officers killed, saying “it’s devastated as well the entire police
  family”. The police have a bond and it’s a reminder of all of us that the men
  and women who put on blue to defend us and to look after safety in our local
  communities take a risk each and every day. So, they are heroes, Detective
  Thompson and Senior Constable De Waart are heroes. And we also give our
  thoughts to those who have been injured during this incident. Police have
  taken two people into custody last night as part of their investigation into
  the fatal shooting of two police officers and serious injury to a third during
  the execution of a search warrant in Porepunkah this week. In a statement they
  said: Fugitive squad detectives, along with Special Operations Group members,
  attended a Porepunkah address about 8.40pm. A 42-year-old woman and
  15-year-old boy were safely arrested at the address and taken into custody.
  The Porepunkah pair were interviewed and released pending further enquiries.
  The arrests form part of the ongoing investigation into the deaths of
  Detective Leading Senior Constable Neal Thompson and Senior Constable Vadim De
  Waart, who were killed in the line of duty. A third officer, a 56-year-old
  male detective leading senior constable, remains in hospital after being shot
  in the lower body. The officers were part of a group of 10 members who were
  attacked while executing a search warrant at a Rayner Track property shortly
  after 10.30am on Tuesday, 26 August. Extensive searches remain ongoing for the
  offender Desmond Filby, also known as Desmond Freeman, whose location remains
  unknown. We urge the public in and around the township of Porepunkah to remain
  vigilant and report any sightings or suspicious behaviour by calling Triple
  Zero (000). Detectives from Crime Command, including the homicide squad and
  fugitive squad, are investigating the incident. Anyone with information is
  urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or submit a confidential
  report online at www.crimestoppersvic.com.au N0-fly zone extended in
  Porepunkah Victoria police have just extended the no-fly zone around
  Porepunkah until 11.30pm Sunday. This includes aircraft and drones, and has
  been put in place both for safety reasons as it’s believed Dezi Freeman is
  heavily armed, as well as “potential implications associated with the suspect
  tracking police movements based off media coverage”. Littleproud says net zero
  not the only way to address climate change David Littleproud, the Nationals
  leader, addressed some in his party’s opposition to net zero on RN Breakfast
  earlier this morning, saying while he believes in climate change Australia
  would be better served by other methods to address it. He told RN Breakfast: I
  don’t think that net zero is the only way to address climate change. I believe
  in climate change. I believe that man has made a contribution to that. But
  it’s a pure old debate to say that if you don’t believe in net zero, you don’t
  believe in climate change. What you can do is be sensible about reducing
  emissions, how you do it in a uniquely Australian way, and making sure that
  you do that in an affordable way for Australians. And we’re not going to run
  away from that. Littleproud would not say what he believes the emissions
  target for 2035 should be, adding that any conversation round climate change
  should take into account the impact on everyday Australians: What I’m saying
  is, we need to think logically about the opportunities that Australia has to
  reduce emissions, but not at any cost. Read more here: Byron shire council
  will boycott companies operating in illegal Israeli settlements in Gaza and
  Palestinian territories after the council voted in favour of the motion on
  Thursday. The original motion was co-sponsored by Greens councillor Elia Hauge
  and included the list of companies that were included in a report earlier this
  year by the UN’s special rapporteur, Francesca Albanese, which was titled From
  Economy of Occupation to Economy of Genocide, as well as a UN list from 2023.
  A second motion, put by Labor councillor Asren Pugh and carried, referred to
  the 2023 list only. Among the companies to be boycotted are Airbnb, Expedia,
  Tripadvisor and Booking.com, Hauge confirmed. In a statement, she said:
  Ethical procurement is core council business. People here don’t want their
  rates funding companies that demolish homes, displace families, or profit from
  killing civilians. This is good governance – and good conscience. Subhi Awad
  from Northern Rivers Friends of Palestine said: Our community, and communities
  across this country, do not want our money going to bombing hospitals and
  killing kids. This isn’t about division or anything else, it’s about basic
  human decency. Byron council has previously divested from fossil fuels,
  nuclear power, weapons, tobacco, and gambling, according to the statement.
  More from Porepunkah this morning While police continued to raid properties
  overnight, the helicopter is out this morning flying low over the town of
  porepunkah. The roadblock near Dezi Freeman’s old property that police have
  set up the last two afternoons has been removed. There is now just a large
  sign telling people Mount Buffalo national park is closed. Nine journalist’s
  question was not ‘personally derogatory to Bob Katter’, Littleproud says
  Littleproud went on to say he didn’t believe the journalist had asked any
  question that was offensive, telling RN Breakfast: I mean, this is all about
  show now rather than substance. And I don’t think from what I saw of the
  transcript, the journalist asked any question that was personally derogatory
  to Bob Katter, but that’s a matter for him. I think the journalist did
  everything he did professionally, and I just think that we don’t need to get
  to that sort of level of puerile behaviour of a federal member of parliament.
  Nationals leader David Littleproud said he would like independent MP Bob
  Katter to apologise after threatening to punch a journalist yesterday, but he
  “doubts” he will, adding such comments were not “becoming” of lawmakers in
  parliament. Littleproud spoke to RN Breakfast after the incident, which came
  after a journalist commented on Katter’s heritage while asking about his
  support for an anti-immigration marches planned this weekend. Littleproud said
  this morning: Look, I don’t think that’s becoming. It doesn’t matter who you
  are or how iconic you think you are. We’ve been given a privileged place in
  parliament to go and to actually debate ideas with intellect. And we’ve got to
  be better than that. And, you know, yeah, Bob wears the big hat and it all
  seems all great and bravado. But I mean, I get questions that I don’t like to
  answer. But when you put yourself into the public sphere and you have that
  privilege of sitting in that great building of parliament facing the most
  sacred building, you’ve got to live up to your responsibility. And I don’t
  think that sort of behaviour is appropriate for a federal member of
  parliament. Expelled ambassador says allegations against Iran ‘baseless’
  during Sydney airport exit Iran’s former ambassador to Australia – now persona
  non grata – denied allegations his government was behind two antisemitic arson
  attacks in Australia, describing the accusations as “baseless” as he left the
  country. Ahmad Sadeghi faced media questioning at Sydney airport before
  boarding a flight out of Australia yesterday. On Tuesday, the prime minister,
  Anthony Albanese, said Iran’s paramilitary Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps
  (IRGC) was ultimately behind two antisemitic arson attacks last year: one on
  the Lewis Continental Kitchen in Bondi and another on the Adass Israel
  synagogue in Melbourne. There were no injuries in either attack. The federal
  government has expelled Sadeghi – the first such expulsion since the second
  world war – and will move to prescribe the IRGC as a terrorist organisation.
  There was no accusation current Iranian diplomats or embassy staff were
  involved. Read more here: Neighbours of raided property say they saw flashing
  lights Two neighbours on the street said they did not hear anything while the
  raid was conducted but one said he saw flashing lights. They said they did not
  know the neighbours. It’s at least the third raid on a property within the
  area in 24 hours. Police raid Porepunkah property overnight Guardian Australia
  confirmed a raid took place on a property in Chandler Court last night in
  Porepunkah. The house was quiet this morning, but some residents appeared to
  be at home – with a note on the door saying private. Victoria police have not
  commented on the matter yet. Gina Rinehart can be served a subpoena to produce
  documents, court finds A court has ordered Gina Rinehart can be served a
  subpoena after Ben Roberts-Smith lost his appeal against Fairfax Media. The
  federal court on Thursday ordered that Rinehart can be served a subpoena by a
  solicitor for Nine newspapers – formerly Fairfax Media – to oblige her to
  produce documents. It is not known what the documents contain. The order said
  that the original service of the subpoena in July should be dispensed with. In
  May, former SAS soldier Roberts-Smith lost his appeal against a defamation
  case ruling, with three justices of the federal court agreeing he was not
  defamed by Nine newspapers and journalists Nick McKenzie and Chris Masters
  when they published reports in 2018 which claimed he had committed war crimes.
  Rinehart criticised what she called the “relentless attack” on Roberts-Smith,
  arguing it weakened the nation and a defence force “already struggling with
  inadequate numbers to defend us”. Australia’s richest person, who has donated
  to a fund designed to support the legal costs of former SAS soldiers, has
  declined to say whether she personally funded Roberts-Smith’s legal costs.----
  Queensland nurses union reaches ‘bargaining consensus’ with state government
  Queensland’s nurses union says it has reached a “bargaining consensus” with
  the state government after months of industrial action over a new enterprise
  bargaining agreement. Queensland Nurses and Midwives’ Union secretary, Sarah
  Beaman, said the government had presented a new offer which the union has
  agreed to take to members. “We’ve secured an offer that better respects the
  work nurses and midwives do every day across Queensland Health,” Beaman said.
  The offer adds double-time overtime for all shift workers, in line with
  male-dominated frontline professions, Beaman said. The state government
  describes this as a nation-first. It is based on a longstanding government pay
  offer of an 11% increase over three years. It also includes a new pay point
  for RNs and midwives, raising the earning potential for more than 23% of
  nurses and midwives, Beaman said. Existing rights and entitlements are also
  protected, among other changes, she said. The health minister, Tim Nicholls,
  said Queensland health and the unions had reached “a consensus focused on
  attracting, retaining, valuing and respecting nurses and midwives”. “The
  Crisafulli government’s proposal will ensure nurses and midwives on the health
  frontline in public hospitals get ahead and stay ahead on wages, conditions,
  penalty rates and cost-of-living,” Nicholls said. The offer will be put to
  members of the union in coming months. Negotiations have been under way since
  January and industrial action has been under way since July, the union’s first
  since 2002. The parties have conducted more than 150 hours of bargaining and
  13 “intensive conciliation sessions”. Read more here: Good morning, Nick
  Visser here to take over for Martin Farrer. Let’s get rolling. Australia will
  send its first ever rover to the moon in a partnership with Nasa, which the
  federal government says will be the furthest any Australian space project has
  travelled. The rover, called Roo-ver, will be sent to the moon by 2030 with a
  Nasa payload capable of analysing its surface and collecting data to assist
  with future space exploration trips. Its mission will help global efforts to
  determine whether a human presence in space could be sustainable, the
  government said. The moon rover was created by a consortium of around 20
  Australian organisations in partnership with the Australian Space Agency. The
  federal government will invest $42m in the project to send Roo-ver to the
  moon. The science minister, Tim Ayres, said: This is one of the most
  specialised robotics and advanced manufacturing projects in the country. It’s
  accelerating the development of Australia’s advanced technical capabilities
  and deepening local manufacturing expertise. The search for gunman Dezi
  Freeman will enter its fourth day today, with the weather again expected to
  create a major hurdle for the manhunt. Yesterday, the Bureau of Meteorology
  released a severe weather warning that included parts of the alpine region. It
  also warned of snow for lower areas. It could also bring the risk of blizzards
  about elevated alpine areas on Friday and early Saturday … As the strong winds
  combine with snow. The bureau said there would be snow showers in areas above
  1000m, before moving lower to 600m. Porepunkah is at 280m but the slopes of Mt
  Buffalo rise sharply from the town with the summit at 1723m so show does seem
  likely to affect the manhunt. Yesterday, the search was affected by low cloud
  cover and near-constant rain. The bushland Freeman has disappeared into is
  thick and dangerous – filled with sheer cliffs, granite tors and, locals say,
  plenty of old mine shafts. The police presence in the area is large, with
  detectives raiding homes, a helicopter often searching around the hills, and
  police creating roadblocks. We will bring you updates from the scene and
  situation as they come. Stay with us. Police raid house in Porepunkah Police
  reportedly raided a house in Porepunkah last night. The Herald Sun reported
  that local residents saw police arrive at a property in Francis Street and
  remove “five or six” people. There were no reports of any arrests. Police
  issued an emergency alert to people in the town warning them to avoid the
  area. Earlier, Freeman’s estranged extended family issued a statement to Seven
  News in which they said that he had “detached himself” from the family
  “decades ago”. They also said that they were “devastated” about the death of
  the two police officers allegedly shot dead by Freeman. Seven News said a
  family member who wanted to remain anonymous said: The family are actively
  assisting police with their investigation and are providing details of our
  knowledge of the area and property,” the family member said. We are
  devastated, heartbroken and sickened by the loss of two police officers.
  Decades ago, Dezi detached himself from us in both name and ideology. We stand
  with the brave members of the Victoria Police and the families of the murdered
  officers. Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I’m Martin Farrer
  with the best overnight stories and then Nick Visser will guide you through
  the day. Poor weather is expected to hamper the search for suspected
  Porepunkah gunman Dezi Freeman as the manhunt enters its fourth day today.
  There was also a reported police raid on a property in Porepunkah last night.
  More coming. Australia will send its first ever rover to the moon in a
  partnership with Nasa, which the federal government says will be the furthest
  any Australian space project has travelled. More to follow.

What we learned, Friday 29 August Thanks for staying with us this week. We are wrapping up the live blog here. This is what made the news today: Blizzards and destructive winds will batter Victoria’s north-east, including the town of Porepunkah, home to alleged cop killer Dezi Freeman. The manhunt for Freeman has continued, with 450 police deployed to Porepunkah. Federal government minister Murray Watt said parliament will “obviously” consider censuring Bob Katter for threatening to punch a journalist. Katter’s son, Robbie Katter, has accused the journalist of failing to read social cues when referencing Katter’s Lebanese heritage, which he said had a “deeply personal dimension”. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and the Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, have been heckled over their climate change policies at the News Corp bush summit in Ballarat. Comedian and radio presenter Dave Hughes has been hospitalised with five broken ribs and a punctured lung after participating in the AFL Legends Game, a charity match raising funds for prostate cancer research. Guardian Australia reporters will keep you updated on the Porepunkah manhunt and the rest of the country’s breaking news over the weekend before parliament resumes next week. Australian shares edge lower to finish wild earning season The Australian share market has edged modestly lower on the last day of a volatile month of company earnings results. The benchmark ASX200 index on Friday slipped slightly to 8,973 points, after spending a week below the 9,000-point record it broke last Thursday. It has risen about 3% in the last month after valuations of major companies swung wildly on the release of financial results for the year to June. Medical manufacturer CSL lost nearly a third of its value on the day its results were released, while building materials company James Hardie lost nearly a fifth of its market capitalisation. Woolworths dropped 15% when it reported its earnings on Wednesday, which AAP reported was its worst single-day selloff since 1994. Daniel Andrews and Bob Carr invited to China’s military parade The Chinese government has invited former Labor premiers Daniel Andrews and Bob Carr to attend a Tiananmen Square military celebration next week. Carr and Andrews were the only Australian invitations mentioned by China’s assistant foreign minister, Hong Lei, before next week’s commemoration of the country’s victory against Japan at the end of the second world war. Xi Jinping is expected to address the military parade, with Russia’s Vladimir Putin, North Korea’s Kim Jong-un, Indonesia’s Prabowo Subianto and the president of Iran among the 26 world leaders expected to attend. Serving heads of state and prime ministers from south, south-east and central Asia, eastern Europe, Cuba, the Congo and Zimbabwe are expected to join them, according to Hong’s statement, circulated by China’s foreign affairs ministry. Carr and Andrews were among a string of former politicians invited, including former prime ministers of New Zealand, Japan, Greece and Italy. Read more about the parade here: Bradman’s baggy green snapped up by museum A historic baggy green cap worn by Sir Donald Bradman has found a new home at one Australia’s most prominent museums, AAP reports. The cap, worn during the 1946-47 Ashes series, has been bought by the National Museum of Australia for $438,500, with the federal government contributing half the cost. Bradman wore the cap when he captained Australia in the series, the first to be played against England after the second world war. The cap is just one of 11 of Bradman’s baggy greens known to exist. A second is located in the Australian Sports Museum, while the locations of the other nine remain private. The cap sits alongside other Bradman memorabilia in the museum’s most recently opened Landmarks gallery, which features pieces from defining moments in our nation’s history. Blizzards and ‘destruction’ forecast for Victoria’s weekend weather Blizzards have been forecast for parts of Victoria, and residents have been warned to prepare for power outages and “destruction” as damaging winds are expected to lash the south-eastern states into the weekend. Destructive winds, with gusts reaching up to 130km/h, are expected to push further into the eastern states on Saturday, bringing showers, hail and isolated thunderstorms. Snowfall as low as 600-metre elevation is expected in the state on Saturday, along with strong winds. Meanwhile, blizzard conditions have been forecast for the alpine areas above 1,200 metres. Snow showers and possible small hail was forecast for Friday and early Saturday morning at Mount Hotham. It comes after a week of severe weather in Victoria’s high country that has added complications to the search for suspected gunman Dezi Freeman in Porepunkah. Winds of up to 113km/h had already been recorded at Mount Hotham on Friday.

A stand-alone hearing earmarked for 13 October has been wiped from the schedule, with scrutiny of Indigenous matters to instead occur over the other days of hearings from 7-10 October. The opposition claims the change means there will be less clear air to grill the government’s record on Indigenous affairs, including the Closing the Gap targets. While defending the decision, a government spokesperson pointed out it had agreed to an extra three days of senate estimates hearings later this year to allow for more scrutiny of its entire agenda. The hearings are scheduled for the first week of December. Here’s the government’s statement in full: The Government has agreed to add three extra days of Senate estimates at the end of the year, to allow for additional scrutiny. In this round of supplementary budget estimates, Indigenous issues will be a part of every day of estimates. Closing the Gap is a whole of government responsibility. It’s the responsibility of every Secretary and Minister to improve outcomes for First Nations Australians. Albanese government minister Murray Watt says Bob Katter could still face a formal censure in parliament next week after the independent MP threatened to punch a journalist. Watt did not commit the government to pursuing a censure motion against Katter but said he personally condemned the veteran Queensland politician’s outburst. He told the ABC: I’m not going to pre-empt the parliamentary processes, [censure] will obviously be considered, but Bob Katter has prided himself on being a colourful character, you can be a colourful character without threatening people … It is completely unacceptable for any human being, let alone a politician, who should be setting a higher standard. Allegra Spender, the independent Sydney MP, said her focus was more on public statements of condemnation, and she hadn’t considered censuring Katter, speaking on the ABC’s Afternoon Briefing. Katter’s son, Robbie Katter, appeared on the ABC earlier, where he defended his father and said a censure motion would be celebrated by north Queenslanders. He said: Most people in regional and North Queensland would see that as an endorsement. A lot of things that come out of Canberra and Brisbane we are not a big fan of, so personally I would see it as an endorsement. Watt rejects criticism of Tasmania windfarm approval The environment minister has dismissed Bob Brown’s warnings of major protests over the approval of a large windfarm project on Robbins Island in north-west Tasmania. Environmental advocates have warned the project could threaten local native wildlife, including the orange-bellied parrot, the Tasmanian devil and the Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle. You can read about the decision here: The environment minister, Murray Watt, said the conditions attached to the development would safeguard against those “unacceptable impacts”. He told the ABC: The surest way to ensure we end up with a more critically endangered species in this country is if we fail to deliver the renewable energy and emissions reductions needed … If we take a really hardline view about this we will not have renewable projects anywhere in the country. Among the project’s critics is former Greens leader Bob Brown, who has warned of major protests against the development. Watt dismissed suggestions of public uprising: We often see predictions from the Greens and their supporters like Bob Brown that don’t turn out to be truthful … and Brown has a history of opposing major economic development across the country. The Queensland state politician Robbie Katter has defended his father for threatening to punch a journalist, saying the reporter “did not get the signals”. Bob Katter has attracted criticism from across the political spectrum for his behaviour, but his son Robbie said there were personal reasons for his father getting upset. He told the ABC: I know for a fact there are some deeply personal, deep personal dimension to that line of questioning that goes back to his family. I’ve known that since a kid. … There is a deeply personal dimension that I won’t share on national TV. The younger Katter said it had been clear his father was growing agitated and suggested the reporter, Nine’s Josh Bavas, was being “provocative”: There are personal touch points that [we] usually agree on that we don’t go there. Perhaps the journalist in question did not get the signals. … We should be able to stand up for ourselves and say at some point that is not acceptable. At what point is that person responsible for their actions? They have to take some cues as well. Pushing back at suggestions Bob Katter was too old for parliament, Robbie said some serving politicians were “too young” and had a “deficit of life experience”. The Bureau of Meteorology has issued an emergency warning for severe thunderstorms in Victoria’s northeast, including the town of Porepunkah, where the manhunt for Dezi Freeman continues. Damaging and destructive winds are expected to batter the north-east and east Gippsland, with the worst of the storms expected to hit Falls Creek and Mount Hotham, just south of the locked-down town. Winds and storms will last for the next several hours across the state’s north-east, the bureau said, after previously warning snow showers could hit the region. The search for Freeman now involves 450 police officers, as temperatures begin to fall and the sun sets. Lending rises at the fastest rate in three years Private credit growth surged by nearly $20bn in July, or 0.7% in the previous month, the fastest pace of increase since 2022. New Reserve Bank data shows lending has accelerated since the RBA cut interest rates a second time, with the annual pace of increase climbing to 7.2%, well above the last decade’s average. UBS analysis indicated business lending saw the biggest increase, while personal credit picked up, and housing credit maintained its faster growth of recent months. Private deposits have also increased 7.2% annually, including a 9.4% increase in household savings, while spending has picked up at the same time, which UBS analysts said was a sign of “solid” household income growth. They warned that rising borrowing for house prices and personal spending could put upward pressure on inflation as construction resources become stretched and homeowners cash in on their rising wealth, writing in a note: We see an increasing likelihood that the strength in asset prices, especially housing, and borrowing (also personal credit is picking up to fund consumption), will probably result in inflation facing upward pressure. And that’s it from me, the wonderful Luca Ittimani is here to take you through the rest of the afternoon’s news! Pill testing clinic to reopen in Queensland Queensland’s pill testing clinic is to reopen next month, thanks to private funding. In April 2024, the former Labor government opened the first of two clinics at Bowen Hills. A second was later opened on the Gold Coast. A year later, the new LNP government closed both, against the advice of health bodies, including the Australian Medical Association. It has subsequently refused to release a report on the trial service. Former operator The Loop Australia announced on Friday morning that it will reopen its doors from Friday, 5 September, and continue to operate every Friday from 2-6pm. The Greens MP Michael Berkman said the return of pill testing was “a massive win for common sense and for our health professionals”. You can’t stop people taking drugs just by saying no, by locking up kids or slapping them with huge fines. In their first year, these clinics identified 120 lethal substances and kickstarted hundreds of conversations and referrals with health professionals. Opposition says Indigenous hearings could have examined why four Closing the Gap targets going backwards Continuing on from that last post: in the Senate on Thursday, the opposition attempted to reinstate the separate hearings only for Labor and the Greens to vote it down. The manager of opposition business in the senate, Jonno Duniam, accused Labor and the Greens of breaking a 17-year-old convention in order to avoid scrutiny. Senate estimates hearings are a critical forum for senators to question the spending of taxpayer funds and hold the government to account. Yet, rather than opening themselves to that accountability, Labor and the Greens have conspired to shut them down. The shadow minister for Indigenous Australians, Kerrynne Liddle, said the opposition would have used the hearings to examine why four of the Closing the Gap targets were going backwards. In a statement, a government spokesperson said under the new format, Indigenous affairs would be examined on each day of hearings, rather than just one. They said: Closing the Gap is a whole of government responsibility. It’s the responsibility of every Secretary and Minister to improve outcomes for First Nations Australians. The next round of estimates will be on 7-10 October. Labor accused of avoiding scrutiny on Indigenous affairs after stand-alone hearing axed The opposition has accused the Albanese government of avoiding scrutiny of its Indigenous affairs agenda after axing a traditional stand-alone estimates hearing on the topic. Hearings on Indigenous matters have typically been held in a stand-alone spot in each Senate estimates block, providing a window of clear air for opposition and crossbenchers to grill government ministers and senior public servants on issues such as Closing the Gap targets. On the other days of an estimates week, the eight committees run hearings at the same time, generating a flood of evidence that can be difficult for even the most diligent politician, staffer (or journalist) to keep across. But in a surprise move, Labor this week won support for a condensed schedule for October’s rounds of estimates, which involves folding Indigenous affairs into the other packed days of hearings. A stand-alone hearing on the Murray Darling-Basin plan – which is also typically allocated its own window – has also been absorbed into the new schedule. That’s all from me, thanks for sticking with us. Natasha May will be your guide for the rest of today’s news. Take care, and have a good weekend. Penny Wong condemns Russian strikes on Kyiv The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, condemned Russian strikes on Kyiv yesterday after the Ukrainian city came under heavy attack. At least 21 people were killed, and the strikes damaged the city’s British Council and EU offices. Four children were among the dead. Wong said in a statement: Russia’s strikes on homes, civilian infrastructure and diplomatic premises are reprehensible. The people of Ukraine have the right to live in peace, free from fear and aggression. Australia again calls on Russia to end its illegal and immoral war. The Sydney marathon is this weekend: what time does it start, which roads will be closed, and what is the route? A record 35,000 runners and upwards of 300,000 spectators are to converge on a new 42.195km marathon course that shows off Sydney on Sunday. It’s the first time the city will be part of the exclusive club of “major” world marathons, alongside Tokyo, Boston, London, Berlin, Chicago and New York – and runners are in for a treat. Here’s a list of need-to-know info and best practices for Sunday, whether you’re running yourself or cheering someone on: Manhunt remains ‘number one priority’ as Victoria police plan to deploy ‘large resource’ at weekend’s anti-immigration protest, Bush says Bush says the police’s “number one priority” is the hunt for Freeman, but that this weekend’s planned anti-immigration “March for Australia” protests will also add to the demand on the force. Bush said: I would like to say, here and now, that the number one priority for the Victoria police is the hunt for this [alleged] murderer. And we’re pouring in over 450 resources to that. And every other resource we have. We’re also conscious that the Victoria police have many other demands. And that includes the protest activity this weekend. Our mission there will be to deploy a large resource … to ensure that those people that are out protesting peacefully are kept safe. So that, too, is a priority. And we will resource it. And we will resource the other demands. But I want to go back to my original point: the number one priority for the Victoria police is to find the person who [allegedly] murdered our officers. Mike Bush confirms Dezi Freeman’s partner was arrested overnight. She was interviewed and released pending further inquiries. Bush said today: People were interviewed totally and specifically in relation to the homicide investigation. Those searches have been completed. The interviews have been conducted. Those people have been released. There may or may not be charges that follow. Police chief says locals in Porepunkah have been ‘fantastic’ during search for Freeman Mike Bush said police had received “helpful” lines of inquiry as they continue the manhunt for Freeman. He said: The locals have been fantastic. There are certain lines of inquiry that are coming in from the public that are being assessed. They’re all helpful. So we encourage members of the public to tell us everything they think they need to tell us … Police chief again appeals to suspect to turn himself in Mike Bush took a moment to address Freeman directly should he be listening to the press conference this afternoon: In fact, if that person is listening, it really is time to lay down your firearms and give yourself up. So that we can all bring this to a safe conclusion. More than 450 police officers involved in hunt for Dezi Freeman The chief commissioner of Victoria police, Mike Bush, said more than 450 police officers are involved in search for Dezi Freeman. Bush said the ongoing manhunt was part of a “very professional and coordinated operation”. Bush said during a press conference: We have over 450 police officers dedicated to this task. Some are involved in search, some are involved in investigations, some are involved in supporting and many are involved in community reassurance. New Zealand’s house prices are finally falling. Could this happen elsewhere? Three years ago, New Zealanders would have it found it almost impossible to imagine the country’s sky-high house prices falling. The market was deemed one of the least affordable in the world, with house prices nearly nine times the average income and supply dismally low. Desperate first home buyers were being squeezed out of the market by cashed-up investors. Some of those in low paid or no work were thrust into homelessness and waitlists for social housing ballooned. In mid-2021 the crisis reached fever pitch, with the national average house price exceeding NZ$1m. But now, those prices are trending downwards.

The Brisbane outburst came after Katter expressed support for anti-immigration “March for Australia” protests planned for the weekend. Bavas asked: “You’ve got Lebanese heritage yourself … ”, before Katter cut him off. The member for Kennedy walked up to the Channel Nine reporter and shook his fist at him. “Don’t say that, because you’re a racist. You’re a racist. You cannot say what you just said without being identified as a racist … this man is a racist,” Katter said. The exchange was filmed. Nine executives were discussing taking defamation action against Katter, sources said. The company has demanded an apology from Katter.

This is the third afternoon in a row that police have blocked off this part of the area. There is low cloud cover, and the helicopter, which usually flies overhead, is not around. It is unclear if they are currently searching in the area. Battin condemns planned anti-immigration ‘March for Australia’ rallies The Victorian opposition leader, Brad Battin, has put out a statement with his spokesperson for multicultural affairs, Evan Mulholland, condemning the anti-immigration “March for Australia” rallies planned for this weekend. The duo said they were particularly concerned about the “anti-Indian sentiment in some of the promotional material for the events published by the anonymous organisers”. Battin said: We condemn these rallies and the abhorrent messaging associated with them. Victoria is a proudly multicultural and multifaith state, and the Liberals and Nationals will always stand with all Victorians, no matter their background. Our state has been built on the contributions of generations of migrants who have made Victoria their home, and we are stronger for it. Any attempt to incite hatred or division against any community is completely unacceptable. Battin told ABC Radio Melbourne yesterday he had told his MPs they shouldn’t attend the rally. Windfarm project likely to face criticism from green groups and scientists Despite the conditions, the Robbins Island windfarm approval decision is likely to face criticism from environmentalists and scientists who have said the area should be a no-go zone site due to its environmental importance. Watt said the windfarm had the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 3.4m tonnes a year, equivalent to taking more than 1m cars off the road each year. He said: There will obviously be some people who support [the decision and] some people who criticise it … The reality is we need more renewable energy being built in Australia to tackle the climate change challenge that we have. The key to that is that, in the approvals process, we put in place strong environmental protections to avoid and reduce environmental damage. That’s what I believe we’ve done with this decision. Watt said construction of the farm was not expected to commence until 2031. He said the project would support up to 350 direct jobs in construction and up to 50 ongoing operational jobs. You can read more about the windfarm proposal from a recent story here: The federal environment minister, Murray Watt, has given the green light to the Robbins Island windfarm, a contentious and long-proposed development in north-west Tasmania that could lead to 100 turbines being built in an area environmentalists say is a haven for migratory shorebirds and threatened species. Watt said he had approved the construction of the windfarm proposed by the renewable energy company Acen Australia, a bridge between the nearly 10,000 hectare island and the Tasmanian mainland wharf and four quarries. A decision on the windfarm had been repeatedly delayed. Watt said his approval came with strict conditions to protect the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot, endangered Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle, protected migratory shorebirds and the Tasmanian devil. The conditions include a requirement the company: Conduct comprehensive parrot surveys for three years before construction. Provide funding for a Tasmanian government parrot conservation program. Develop and implement a bird and bat management plan to “evaluate, mitigate and manage the risk of turbine collision for threatened birds”. Watt said the plan may need to include “curtailment or shutdown of all or some turbines” at certain times. Install barriers to avoid Tasmanian devils from the mainland crossing to the island and potentially affecting the local disease-free population. Not build turbines within 1km of a wedge-tailed eagle nest. Heckling forces Jacinta Allan to stop midway through speech at bush summit The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has been forced to stop midway through her speech a the News Corp bush summit in Ballarat this morning due to loud booing and heckling from the crowd, including one man telling her to “fuck off”. She told the crowd: I could just request, I know there’s differences of views. One of the things that makes me proud of living in regional Victoria is I turn up and we turn up and listen and respect one another, and I simply ask, [that] I can conclude my remarks. But her pleas to “show the best of country Victoria” to those tuning in online were largely ignored. The loudest boos came as the premier spoke about her government’s support for renewable energy projects. During a Q and A segment, the Herald Sun’s Tom Minear was forced to repeatedly ask the crowd to quieten down. Asked whether there needed to be better consultation with landowners, Allan replied: One of the challenges we have in this discussion is there’s a lot of loud voices, but there’s also a lot of people who want the information. Out of respect to people who are seeking the information, they deserve to hear that, not just from politicians but from experts and advisers. One of the things that we need to do differently is better engage with landowners, and it’s why, whether it’s through the support that landowners can receive in hosting transmission lines on their property, whether it’s the compensation arrangements that are being made available. This is one of the challenges that we can have to work through these issues together. Allan appeared at the event immediately after prime minister, Anthony Albanese, who was also jeered by the crowd. Comedian and radio presenter Dave Hughes has been hospitalised with five broken ribs and a punctured lung after participating in the AFL Legends Game, a charity match raising funds for prostate cancer research. Hughes called in to Melbourne radio stations on Friday morning from his hospital bed, confirming he was severely injured and on strong painkillers but making light of his situation. He told Fox FM: I knew that when I slowed down, this was going to happen, but I didn’t realise to this extent. I was groaning in the morning. My wife said, we’ve got to go to the hospital. I said, I can’t get out of bed, can they come here? Reportedly the oldest person on the field, Hughes was playing for the Victorian team against the All Stars. He believed on-field collisions from Andrew Embley and Mitch Robinson were responsible for his injuries. He told Triple M: At half-time, I was coming off the ground and I was like, ‘I feel like I have a punctured lung’, and I was joking, but no, I do. Asked “who got you?”, Hughes said: Andrew Embley. Hodgey [Luke Hodge] kicked it to me, I dropped a chest mark – it was the lights, there’s too many lights at that ground – and Embley came in from the side. It was the first collision, and from that moment I was struggling. [Daniel] Gorringe slammed me in the ruck. Butler says any report of foiled potential hijacking plan ‘sends shivers down the spine’ Health minister Mark Butler said any report of a potential hijacking plan “sends shivers down the spine of every Australian” after the Australian reported yesterday on an allegedly foiled plot to take control of a commercial jet. Butler said he couldn’t comment on the specifics of the case, which is before the courts, but said there is no threat to the public. He spoke to Channel 7’s Sunrise this morning, saying: Obviously, any report of a potential hijacking sends shivers down the spine of every Australian, particularly Australians who fly. But I want to be very cautious about this. As you’ve reported … this alleged hijacker is in custody, so there’s no threat to the Australian community. But there’s a suppression order on this for very good reason. Investigations are still under way by our intelligence and security agencies, so we don’t want to speculate about other aspects of this issue. We want to let our agencies do their work and that will all come out in due course and be prosecuted in the normal way. Prime minister Anthony Albanese and Victorian premier Jacinta Allan have been heckled at the News Corp bush summit in Ballarat this morning, with participants strongly criticising and interrupting both leaders over their environmental and climate change policies. Albanese, responding to the heckling, said “I won’t bullshit people” as he backed in his government’s climate change and clean energy policies. The PM said: I understand some people have a different view, but what I won’t do is come and, out of convenience, say what is convenient and people want to hear. Albanese noted it was the former Morrison Coalition government that had adopted a net zero target. The crowd in Ballarat booed, laughed and jeered as Albanese talked about coal-fired power stations not stacking up economically. To loud opposition from the crowd, Albanese said: There hasn’t been a new coal fired power station started this century. That’s the truth. There’s been no regulation stopping that… It hasn’t happened because the market has determined it doesn’t stack up. The News Corp moderator at several points tried to calm the crowd, saying “please, audience” and “we’ll have to stop if you keep going”. Albanese had been criticised by the Greens for attending a separate bush summit event earlier in the week, calling it “climate disinformation spreader News Corp’s bush summit” and claiming the events “give a platform to some of the country’s most extreme and disturbing anti-net zero, anti-climate action rhetoric”. Star Entertainment Group posts $471m full-year loss Star Entertainment Group says it lost $471m last financial year and its soft trading conditions continued in July, AAP reports. The embattled casino group also disclosed on Friday it had $189m in available cash as of Monday, $45m less than it had as of 30 June, although that’s partly because it paid $16m in back taxes during that time. Star said it brought in $92.1m in revenue and incurred a $7.4m operating loss in July, slightly ahead of its June quarter average. “There remains material uncertainly regarding the group’s ability to continue as a going concern,” the company said, citing six items that are critical to its financial outlook. Among them is a looming money-laundering penalty from Austrac, Australia’s financial watchdog, which has proposed a fine of $400m; Star’s ability to restore its casino licenses; and completing a $300m investment from Bally’s and pub baron Bruce Mathieson. Victoria police set up designated area due to planned far-right protest Victoria police will set up a designated area across Melbourne’s CBD as they prepare for “violence” at a rightwing protest on Sunday. Supt Troy Papworth, from the north-west metro specialist operations unit at Victoria police, told ABC Radio Melbourne the entire CBD up to the Shrine of Remembrance will be declared a designated area under the Control of Weapons Act. This means officers can randomly stop and search anyone or their vehicle without a warrant or reasonable grounds. The designated area has been declared due to concern around some rightwing figures attending the protest near Flinders Street to “cause violence and mayhem”, Papworth said: In a week where we’ve lost two police officers … we are having to respond to protest intended to cause violence in the city. He says another planned pro-Palestine rally is also organised for the State Library. Organisers have been communicating with police and say they will avoid Flinders Street, but Papworth says he remains concerned there could be confrontation between the two groups. NSW police charged a man on Thursday over the alleged kidnapping and murder of a Sydney woman in April. Police said they responded to a home in the suburb of Bankstown in western Sydney on 17 April, where they were told a group of people had forced their way into a home before allegedly kidnapping the woman, 45, and assaulting an eight-year-old boy with a baseball bat. The group, armed with a firearm, then allegedly forced the woman into an SUV. Later that day, emergency services responded to reports of a car fire, where they discovered the body of the woman inside. Police claim the woman and children were targeted over her partner’s alleged involvement with an organised crime group in Victoria. A man, 29, was arrested yesterday and charged with murder and wounding a person with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. He was refused bail and will appear before court later today. Police will alleged the 29-year-old facilitated the alleged kidnapping and murder of the woman. PM downplays speculation over purpose of Marles’s US trip Anthony Albanese downplayed reports that Richard Marles’s much-debated trip to America was about locking in a meeting with Donald Trump. Albanese told Channel Nine: That wasn’t his job and it wasn’t his issue and I don’t think it was – I don’t know whether that was raised or not, but that’s not the reason why he goes. We have office-to-office communication and Ambassador Rudd is responsible for those issues. The prime minister wouldn’t say whether a meeting had finally been confirmed, only saying “when you see it on your screens, you’ll know it’s confirmed”. I’ll be certainly with President Trump a number of times between now and the end of the year. It’s summit season, which sounds glamorous but isn’t. You spend more time on a plane than you do on the land. And so we have a range of meetings, whether it’s the UN general assembly, Asean, Apec. So we’ll be running into each other regularly. And we’re just trying to finalise the Quad meeting as well. Bob Katter needs to ‘have a look at himself’, prime minister says Albanese also criticised Bob Katter’s explosive press conference yesterday where he threatened to punch a journalist who asked about his Lebanese heritage. He told Channel Nine: Bob Katter I like, but Bob Katter needs to have a look at that footage. Have a look at himself, frankly, and recognise that that’s just not what we expect of any Australian, let alone someone who’s in public office. You’re speaking to someone called Albanese. We’ve got a Senate leader called Wong. Migration enriches. Except for the First Australians, we’re all either migrants or descendants of them. Prime minister says government has offered ‘every support’ required in hunt for Dezi Freeman Anthony Albanese says federal authorities will give Victoria “every support that is required” to assist in the manhunt for Dezi Freeman in the Victorian high country. On Channel Nine’s Today show earlier, he confirmed the AFP’s elite tactical unit had joined the operation: What’s occurred here is that we have offered the premier, Jacinta Allan, every support that is required. This guy clearly is dangerous. He’s on the run and we want him caught and we want people who are traumatised in that northeast community of Victoria to feel safe again. The prime minister again paid tribute to the police officers killed, saying “it’s devastated as well the entire police family”. The police have a bond and it’s a reminder of all of us that the men and women who put on blue to defend us and to look after safety in our local communities take a risk each and every day. So, they are heroes, Detective Thompson and Senior Constable De Waart are heroes. And we also give our thoughts to those who have been injured during this incident. Police have taken two people into custody last night as part of their investigation into the fatal shooting of two police officers and serious injury to a third during the execution of a search warrant in Porepunkah this week. In a statement they said: Fugitive squad detectives, along with Special Operations Group members, attended a Porepunkah address about 8.40pm. A 42-year-old woman and 15-year-old boy were safely arrested at the address and taken into custody. The Porepunkah pair were interviewed and released pending further enquiries. The arrests form part of the ongoing investigation into the deaths of Detective Leading Senior Constable Neal Thompson and Senior Constable Vadim De Waart, who were killed in the line of duty. A third officer, a 56-year-old male detective leading senior constable, remains in hospital after being shot in the lower body. The officers were part of a group of 10 members who were attacked while executing a search warrant at a Rayner Track property shortly after 10.30am on Tuesday, 26 August. Extensive searches remain ongoing for the offender Desmond Filby, also known as Desmond Freeman, whose location remains unknown. We urge the public in and around the township of Porepunkah to remain vigilant and report any sightings or suspicious behaviour by calling Triple Zero (000). Detectives from Crime Command, including the homicide squad and fugitive squad, are investigating the incident. Anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or submit a confidential report online at www.crimestoppersvic.com.au N0-fly zone extended in Porepunkah Victoria police have just extended the no-fly zone around Porepunkah until 11.30pm Sunday. This includes aircraft and drones, and has been put in place both for safety reasons as it’s believed Dezi Freeman is heavily armed, as well as “potential implications associated with the suspect tracking police movements based off media coverage”. Littleproud says net zero not the only way to address climate change David Littleproud, the Nationals leader, addressed some in his party’s opposition to net zero on RN Breakfast earlier this morning, saying while he believes in climate change Australia would be better served by other methods to address it. He told RN Breakfast: I don’t think that net zero is the only way to address climate change. I believe in climate change. I believe that man has made a contribution to that. But it’s a pure old debate to say that if you don’t believe in net zero, you don’t believe in climate change. What you can do is be sensible about reducing emissions, how you do it in a uniquely Australian way, and making sure that you do that in an affordable way for Australians. And we’re not going to run away from that. Littleproud would not say what he believes the emissions target for 2035 should be, adding that any conversation round climate change should take into account the impact on everyday Australians: What I’m saying is, we need to think logically about the opportunities that Australia has to reduce emissions, but not at any cost.

The original motion was co-sponsored by Greens councillor Elia Hauge and included the list of companies that were included in a report earlier this year by the UN’s special rapporteur, Francesca Albanese, which was titled From Economy of Occupation to Economy of Genocide, as well as a UN list from 2023. A second motion, put by Labor councillor Asren Pugh and carried, referred to the 2023 list only. Among the companies to be boycotted are Airbnb, Expedia, Tripadvisor and Booking.com, Hauge confirmed. In a statement, she said: Ethical procurement is core council business. People here don’t want their rates funding companies that demolish homes, displace families, or profit from killing civilians. This is good governance – and good conscience. Subhi Awad from Northern Rivers Friends of Palestine said: Our community, and communities across this country, do not want our money going to bombing hospitals and killing kids. This isn’t about division or anything else, it’s about basic human decency. Byron council has previously divested from fossil fuels, nuclear power, weapons, tobacco, and gambling, according to the statement. More from Porepunkah this morning While police continued to raid properties overnight, the helicopter is out this morning flying low over the town of porepunkah. The roadblock near Dezi Freeman’s old property that police have set up the last two afternoons has been removed. There is now just a large sign telling people Mount Buffalo national park is closed. Nine journalist’s question was not ‘personally derogatory to Bob Katter’, Littleproud says Littleproud went on to say he didn’t believe the journalist had asked any question that was offensive, telling RN Breakfast: I mean, this is all about show now rather than substance. And I don’t think from what I saw of the transcript, the journalist asked any question that was personally derogatory to Bob Katter, but that’s a matter for him. I think the journalist did everything he did professionally, and I just think that we don’t need to get to that sort of level of puerile behaviour of a federal member of parliament. Nationals leader David Littleproud said he would like independent MP Bob Katter to apologise after threatening to punch a journalist yesterday, but he “doubts” he will, adding such comments were not “becoming” of lawmakers in parliament. Littleproud spoke to RN Breakfast after the incident, which came after a journalist commented on Katter’s heritage while asking about his support for an anti-immigration marches planned this weekend. Littleproud said this morning: Look, I don’t think that’s becoming. It doesn’t matter who you are or how iconic you think you are. We’ve been given a privileged place in parliament to go and to actually debate ideas with intellect. And we’ve got to be better than that. And, you know, yeah, Bob wears the big hat and it all seems all great and bravado. But I mean, I get questions that I don’t like to answer. But when you put yourself into the public sphere and you have that privilege of sitting in that great building of parliament facing the most sacred building, you’ve got to live up to your responsibility. And I don’t think that sort of behaviour is appropriate for a federal member of parliament. Expelled ambassador says allegations against Iran ‘baseless’ during Sydney airport exit Iran’s former ambassador to Australia – now persona non grata – denied allegations his government was behind two antisemitic arson attacks in Australia, describing the accusations as “baseless” as he left the country. Ahmad Sadeghi faced media questioning at Sydney airport before boarding a flight out of Australia yesterday. On Tuesday, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said Iran’s paramilitary Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) was ultimately behind two antisemitic arson attacks last year: one on the Lewis Continental Kitchen in Bondi and another on the Adass Israel synagogue in Melbourne. There were no injuries in either attack. The federal government has expelled Sadeghi – the first such expulsion since the second world war – and will move to prescribe the IRGC as a terrorist organisation. There was no accusation current Iranian diplomats or embassy staff were involved.

They said they did not know the neighbours. It’s at least the third raid on a property within the area in 24 hours. Police raid Porepunkah property overnight Guardian Australia confirmed a raid took place on a property in Chandler Court last night in Porepunkah. The house was quiet this morning, but some residents appeared to be at home – with a note on the door saying private. Victoria police have not commented on the matter yet. Gina Rinehart can be served a subpoena to produce documents, court finds A court has ordered Gina Rinehart can be served a subpoena after Ben Roberts-Smith lost his appeal against Fairfax Media. The federal court on Thursday ordered that Rinehart can be served a subpoena by a solicitor for Nine newspapers – formerly Fairfax Media – to oblige her to produce documents. It is not known what the documents contain. The order said that the original service of the subpoena in July should be dispensed with. In May, former SAS soldier Roberts-Smith lost his appeal against a defamation case ruling, with three justices of the federal court agreeing he was not defamed by Nine newspapers and journalists Nick McKenzie and Chris Masters when they published reports in 2018 which claimed he had committed war crimes. Rinehart criticised what she called the “relentless attack” on Roberts-Smith, arguing it weakened the nation and a defence force “already struggling with inadequate numbers to defend us”. Australia’s richest person, who has donated to a fund designed to support the legal costs of former SAS soldiers, has declined to say whether she personally funded Roberts-Smith’s legal costs.---- Queensland nurses union reaches ‘bargaining consensus’ with state government Queensland’s nurses union says it has reached a “bargaining consensus” with the state government after months of industrial action over a new enterprise bargaining agreement. Queensland Nurses and Midwives’ Union secretary, Sarah Beaman, said the government had presented a new offer which the union has agreed to take to members. “We’ve secured an offer that better respects the work nurses and midwives do every day across Queensland Health,” Beaman said. The offer adds double-time overtime for all shift workers, in line with male-dominated frontline professions, Beaman said. The state government describes this as a nation-first. It is based on a longstanding government pay offer of an 11% increase over three years. It also includes a new pay point for RNs and midwives, raising the earning potential for more than 23% of nurses and midwives, Beaman said. Existing rights and entitlements are also protected, among other changes, she said. The health minister, Tim Nicholls, said Queensland health and the unions had reached “a consensus focused on attracting, retaining, valuing and respecting nurses and midwives”. “The Crisafulli government’s proposal will ensure nurses and midwives on the health frontline in public hospitals get ahead and stay ahead on wages, conditions, penalty rates and cost-of-living,” Nicholls said. The offer will be put to members of the union in coming months. Negotiations have been under way since January and industrial action has been under way since July, the union’s first since 2002. The parties have conducted more than 150 hours of bargaining and 13 “intensive conciliation sessions”. Read more here: Good morning, Nick Visser here to take over for Martin Farrer. Let’s get rolling. Australia will send its first ever rover to the moon in a partnership with Nasa, which the federal government says will be the furthest any Australian space project has travelled. The rover, called Roo-ver, will be sent to the moon by 2030 with a Nasa payload capable of analysing its surface and collecting data to assist with future space exploration trips. Its mission will help global efforts to determine whether a human presence in space could be sustainable, the government said. The moon rover was created by a consortium of around 20 Australian organisations in partnership with the Australian Space Agency. The federal government will invest $42m in the project to send Roo-ver to the moon. The science minister, Tim Ayres, said: This is one of the most specialised robotics and advanced manufacturing projects in the country. It’s accelerating the development of Australia’s advanced technical capabilities and deepening local manufacturing expertise. The search for gunman Dezi Freeman will enter its fourth day today, with the weather again expected to create a major hurdle for the manhunt. Yesterday, the Bureau of Meteorology released a severe weather warning that included parts of the alpine region. It also warned of snow for lower areas. It could also bring the risk of blizzards about elevated alpine areas on Friday and early Saturday … As the strong winds combine with snow. The bureau said there would be snow showers in areas above 1000m, before moving lower to 600m. Porepunkah is at 280m but the slopes of Mt Buffalo rise sharply from the town with the summit at 1723m so show does seem likely to affect the manhunt. Yesterday, the search was affected by low cloud cover and near-constant rain. The bushland Freeman has disappeared into is thick and dangerous – filled with sheer cliffs, granite tors and, locals say, plenty of old mine shafts. The police presence in the area is large, with detectives raiding homes, a helicopter often searching around the hills, and police creating roadblocks. We will bring you updates from the scene and situation as they come. Stay with us. Police raid house in Porepunkah Police reportedly raided a house in Porepunkah last night. The Herald Sun reported that local residents saw police arrive at a property in Francis Street and remove “five or six” people. There were no reports of any arrests. Police issued an emergency alert to people in the town warning them to avoid the area. Earlier, Freeman’s estranged extended family issued a statement to Seven News in which they said that he had “detached himself” from the family “decades ago”. They also said that they were “devastated” about the death of the two police officers allegedly shot dead by Freeman. Seven News said a family member who wanted to remain anonymous said: The family are actively assisting police with their investigation and are providing details of our knowledge of the area and property,” the family member said. We are devastated, heartbroken and sickened by the loss of two police officers. Decades ago, Dezi detached himself from us in both name and ideology. We stand with the brave members of the Victoria Police and the families of the murdered officers. Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I’m Martin Farrer with the best overnight stories and then Nick Visser will guide you through the day. Poor weather is expected to hamper the search for suspected Porepunkah gunman Dezi Freeman as the manhunt enters its fourth day today. There was also a reported police raid on a property in Porepunkah last night. More coming. Australia will send its first ever rover to the moon in a partnership with Nasa, which the federal government says will be the furthest any Australian space project has travelled. More to follow.
