  In most of America’s largest cities, crime, especially violent crime, is down.
  But the fear of crime is increasing. Donald Trump has made a career out of
  ignoring the reality of crime rates and of stoking that fear. Well before he
  entered politics and throughout his political career, he has talked about city
  life as life in a proverbial jungle. In 2022, he talked frequently about the “
  blood-soaked streets of our once-great cities” and said: “Cities are rotting,
  and they are indeed cesspools of blood.” And he never strays far from that
  playbook. On 11 August, the president returned to his demagogic
  characterizations of America’s urban areas when he deployed national guard and
  federal law enforcement agents to the streets of Washington DC. He said the
  city was awash in “crime, bloodshed, bedlam, and squalor”. He claimed that
  “crime is out of control in the District of Columbia”. In fact, violent crime
  in the District of Columbia is the lowest it has been in more than three
  decades. But Trump didn’t just ignore the data. He leaned into a different
  problem in Washington: fear of crime. Referring to Washingtonians who like to
  jog, the president said: “People tell me they can’t run any more. They’re just
  afraid.” And he was not content to target just the nation’s capital. “You look
  at Chicago,” he said, “how bad it is. You look at Los Angeles, how bad it is.
  We have other cities in a very bad – New York is a problem. And then you have,
  of course, Baltimore and Oakland. We don’t even mention that any more. They’re
  so far gone. We’re not going to let it happen.” Never mind that, like
  Washington, as CNN reports, Chicago, Baltimore and other cities also have had
  “substantial declines in 2024, 2025 or both”. So far, Democratic political
  leaders have repeated those statistics as if that in itself will carry the
  day. In so doing, they are repeating a mistake made by Joe Biden when he asked
  people to focus on economic statistics that showed declines in the rate of
  inflation rather than their lived reality. Unfortunately, the statistics
  matter much less than the fear of crime. That fear is a real problem, and
  Democrats need to acknowledge and respond to it. Let’s start with the District
  of Columbia. A Washington Post-Schar School poll conducted in mid-August found
  that 31% of Washingtonians said crime was an “‘extremely serious’ or a ‘very
  serious’” problem in the District. Last year, the same poll found that number
  to be 65%. Some of this decline can be attributed to the fact that residents
  of the city overwhelmingly oppose what the president has done and don’t want
  to be seen as lending it legitimacy. But however you measure it, fear of crime
  is not just a District of Columbia problem. In New York City, 75% of residents
  say that crime is a serious problem. As an essay posted on Vital City puts it:
  “Whatever crime statistics show, most of us are worried that it could happen
  to us. That feeling is nebulous and hard to overcome … We the people say crime
  is a serious problem, and most of us will continue, for now, to look over our
  shoulders and worry when someone we love leaves home.” National surveys
  suggest that “Americans’ fear of crime is at a 30-year high”. Other survey
  evidence highlights the fact that “73% say crime has ‘some’ or ‘major’ impact
  on how they live their lives”. Among Black and Hispanic Americans, that number
  is even higher. Not surprisingly, many Americans now favor long prison
  sentences for convicted criminals. Explanations vary for the paradox that as
  crime rates fall, fear of crime persists. Crime stories often dominate local
  news coverage, and the more gruesome the crime, the greater the coverage. That
  is why fear of crime is driven not by a dispassionate examination of data but
  by the power of individual stories of victimization. That pattern is
  intensified by social media. Studies have shown that social media usage stokes
  crime fear. Demographics also matter. Crime fears are greater among older
  people, and, as the population ages, those fears increase. Fear of crime is
  also associated with a generalized sense of disorderliness in our communities
  and the world. And, as the economist and criminal justice scholar John Roman
  argues, because “our collective tolerance for disorder is declining”, our fear
  of crime is increasing. Of course, it doesn’t help that Trump uses the bully
  pulpit and his public visibility to emphasize and exaggerate the crime problem
  as part of his authoritarian project. But blaming Trump for the fear of crime
  problem is not any more of a winning political strategy than reciting the
  latest data on falling crime rates. Democrats can’t and shouldn’t run away
  from either the crime problem or the fear of crime problem. They will have no
  credibility in offering responses to the former until they establish
  credibility on the latter. They would be well-advised to tackle the fear
  problem openly and to embrace responses, like investing in programs that
  repair public spaces and revitalize neighborhoods, while also being clear that
  people who fear crime have reason to want to see more police on the street.
  Trump knows the potency of the fear of the crime problem. That’s why he
  boasted that after his deployment of national guard in Washington, DC, “People
  are feeling safe already … They’re not afraid any more.” But we don’t need the
  national guard to do what local police can do when they are well-trained,
  responsive to the needs of all communities and well-resourced. The best
  long-term response to the president’s agenda for American cities is to make
  sure that the people who live there have more confidence in their safety and
  less fear of crime. Austin Sarat, William Nelson Cromwell professor of
  jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College, is the author or
  editor of more than 100 books, including Gruesome Spectacles: Botched
  Executions and America’s Death Penalty
