  hot homes

  Lower-income householders, minority ethnic people and those with young
  children are more likely to live in homes at risk from dangerous overheating,
  research has found. The UK has baked in multiple heatwaves this summer, with
  many people sweltering in dangerously hot homes that were not designed to
  withstand extreme temperatures. June was the hottest on record and in general
  this summer England was an average of 1.58C above average temperatures. Hot
  homes are dangerous for health; cardiovascular and respiratory issues, sleep
  disturbance, mental health problems and heat exhaustion all correlate with
  high temperatures in the home. Health risks spike when temperatures inside are
  above 25C, and there is a link between overheating homes and the risk of
  death, particularly for elderly people. An analysis of housing stock by the
  Resolution Foundation has found nearly half (48%) of the poorest fifth of
  English households have homes liable to get too hot – three times as many as
  among the richest fifth (17%). Owning your own home reduces the risk of
  overheating; two-thirds of socially renting households face the highest risk
  of their homes getting too hot compared with 55% of private rented homes and
  17% of those that are owner occupied. Additionally, six in 10 of those with
  young children, and almost half of minority ethnic households also face the
  highest risk of their homes getting too hot. Overall, the research found a
  fifth of homes in England overheat in current summer temperatures, while
  one-third (32%) have attributes that put them at high risk of overheating in
  the future. Small flats, small homes and those that are overcrowded are all at
  risk of getting too hot, as are those in areas such as London that suffer from
  an urban heat island effect. More than half (53%) of homes in London are at
  risk of overheating, compared with 31% of those outside the capital. Experts
  have called for the government to update its upcoming future homes standard to
  include provisions for overheating homes. The regulations are due to be
  published this autumn, to come into force from 2027, but the focus has been
  mainly on how to keep draughty homes warm in winter, rather than to keep them
  cool in summer. “The way we are building new housing is not adequate to the
  climate change we are already seeing, never mind the even hotter weather
  that’s coming,” said Simon McWhirter, the chief executive of the UK Green
  Building Council. Zachary Leather, an economist at the Resolution Foundation,
  said: “With the sweltering temperatures parts of the UK have seen recently set
  to become more common, we face a greater risk of overheating at home. But this
  risk is not spread equally – lower-income families, social renters, those with
  children and ethnic-minority households are more likely to live in homes at
  risk of overheating.” The thinktank used data from a government study that
  placed hundreds of sensors in people’s homes to determine which types of
  houses were most at risk of overheating. The figures were then combined with
  the latest data on who lives in these homes – small flats, small homes and
  overcrowded properties – to identify those at the highest risk of overheating
  as the UK’s temperature rises. It also analysed the dangers people face at
  work from extreme heat. One in four UK workers work in occupations where they
  are at risk of heat stress. There is an inequality aspect to this, too; those
  in the top third income bracket have a lower than average risk. Older workers
  are more likely to face heat stress at work; 31% of those in jobs liable to
  cause heat stress are aged over 50. The research also found that office
  workers in more deprived areas were less likely to have air conditioning in
  their workplaces. The researchers suggested “learning from countries that have
  long had higher temperatures, including legal rights for maximum workplace
  temperatures, and better adapted buildings”. Measures that can keep homes
  cooler in summer include good ventilation to create through airflow that cools
  rooms, with well-designed windows and external shutters, and reflective paint
  on roofs or outside surfaces. Street trees are a simple and cost effective way
  to keep homes cool, the UK Green Building Council has said. It advocates a
  3:30:300 approach: you should be able to see three trees from your dwelling;
  you should have 30% tree canopy cover within your neighbourhood; and you
  should be no more than 300 metres from a biodiverse green space or park. A
  government spokesperson said: “We know the importance of keeping homes cool in
  hot weather. That’s why building regulations require new homes to be built to
  reduce the risk of overheating and through the future homes standard
  consultation we are exploring how to further improve protections. This is
  alongside considering the use of air-air heat pumps to keep existing homes
  cool under the boiler upgrade scheme.”
