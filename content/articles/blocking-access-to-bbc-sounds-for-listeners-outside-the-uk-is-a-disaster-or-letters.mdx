  I am writing to express my deep frustration at the BBC’s recent decision to
  block international access to its BBC Sounds platform. Since 21 July,
  listeners outside the UK have been cut off from a vast archive of cultural and
  educational programming – material that, until now, represented the BBC’s
  global public service mission. As a primary school teacher and an English
  language educator based outside the UK, I feel this decision as a personal and
  professional loss. For years, I have used BBC Sounds to access authentic,
  native-level English content that helped me improve my listening skills and
  bring real-world language into my classroom. It was an extraordinary free tool
  – one that supported both lifelong learning and international cultural
  exchange. Now, the only way for non-UK users to continue accessing these
  resources is to use a VPN and invent a UK postcode – effectively forcing us to
  lie. Is this truly in line with the BBC’s values? The BBC has long been a
  trusted global institution. This decision damages that trust. It reduces
  cultural access, harms language learners, educators and researchers, and
  undermines the very values the BBC claims to uphold. Surely there must be a
  more respectful way to manage licensing restrictions than simply turning away
  the world. Andrés Simón Gil Gil Almendralejo, Spain
