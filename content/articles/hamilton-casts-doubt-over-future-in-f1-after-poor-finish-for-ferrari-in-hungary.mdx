  Lewis Hamilton gave a remarkably downbeat response, prompting questions about
  his future in Formula One, after he managed only 12th place in the Hungarian
  Grand Prix, won by McLaren’s Lando Norris, the former world champion
  suggesting he was in no little turmoil and that he would “hopefully” return
  when F1 resumes after the summer break. Having qualified in 12th place in
  Budapest, describing the performance as “absolutely useless” and stating that
  Ferrari should find another driver, he appeared equally unimpressed with his
  drive to 12th place in the race on Sunday. Afterwards he gave a dejected reply
  when asked about his comments from Saturday. “When you have a feeling, you
  have a feeling,” he said. “There is a lot going on in the background that is
  not great.” He did not elucidate on whether the issues were personal, or
  related to his career and Ferrari, but when asked if he was disillusioned with
  racing said: “No, I still love it, I still love the team.” He was, however,
  unusually unengaged after the race at the Hungaroring. He gave monosyllabic
  answers to questions and when asked why, said: “I have got nothing else to
  say.” He leaves the paddock on tenterhooks with the summer break beginning and
  the next round not until the Dutch GP on 31 August, about which he was
  similarly cryptic. He was “very much” looking forward to the break, but when
  asked if he would be driving at the next round, was less equivocal: “I look
  forward to coming back … Hopefully I will be back, yeah.” His Ferrari team
  principal, Fred Vasseur, maintained that his driver was just disheartened by a
  tough weekend. “I don’t need to motivate him, honestly, he’s frustrated, but
  not demotivated,” he said. “I can perfectly understand the situation. He’s
  demanding. But that’s why he’s a seven-time world champion. “He’s demanding
  with the team, with the car, with the engineers, with the mechanics, with
  myself but first of all, he’s very demanding with himself. I can understand
  the frustration from Lewis. This is normal. He will come back.” Hamilton’s
  former team principal at Mercedes, Toto Wolff, also felt he would bounce back.
  “Lewis is wearing his heart on his sleeve. It was very raw what he said [on
  Saturday], he was hard on himself,” Wolff said. “We have seen it before when
  he felt he had not met his own expectations. He’s been that emotionally
  transparent since he was a young adult. “Lewis has unfinished business in
  Formula One. You ask me if he still has it? He definitely has it.”
