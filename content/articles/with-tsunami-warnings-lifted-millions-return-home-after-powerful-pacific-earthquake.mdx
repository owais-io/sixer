  Tsunami warnings were lifted across the Pacific rim on Wednesday, allowing
  millions of temporary evacuees to return home after one of the strongest
  earthquakes ever recorded hit off the coast Russia. The 8.8-magnitude quake
  rattled Russia’s sparsely populated Kamchatka peninsula, triggering tsunami
  warnings and evacuations from Japan to the United States to Ecuador. Storm
  surges of up to four metres (12 feet) were predicted for some parts of the
  Pacific, after the shallow quake struck on Wednesday morning. The tsunamis
  caused widespread disruption. Peru closed 65 of its 121 Pacific ports and
  authorities on Maui cancelled flights to and from the Hawaiian island. But
  fears of a catastrophe were not realised, with country after country lifting
  or downgrading warnings and telling coastal residents they could return. In
  Japan, almost two million people had been ordered to higher ground, before the
  warnings were downgraded or rescinded. The Fukushima nuclear plant in
  northeast Japan – destroyed by a huge quake and tsunami in 2011 – was
  temporarily evacuated. The only reported fatality was a woman killed while
  driving her car off a cliff in Japan as she tried to escape, local media
  reported. In Chile, authorities conducted what the interior ministry said was
  “perhaps the most massive evacuation ever carried out in our country” – with
  1.4 million people ordered to high ground. Chilean authorities reported no
  damage or victims and registered waves of just 60 centimeters (two feet) on
  the country’s north coast. In the Galápagos Islands, where waves of up to
  three meters were expected, there was relief as the Ecuadoran navy’s
  oceanographic institute said the danger had passed. Locals reported the sea
  level falling and then rising suddenly, a phenomenon which is commonly seen
  with the arrival of a tsunami. But only a surge of just over a metre was
  reported, causing no damage. “Everything is calm, I’m going back to work. The
  restaurants are reopening and the places tourists visit are also open again,”
  said 38-year-old Santa Cruz resident Isabel Grijalva. Earlier national parks
  were closed, schools were shuttered, loudspeakers blared warnings and tourists
  were spirited off sightseeing boats and on to the safety of land. The worst
  damage was seen in Russia, where a tsunami crashed through the port of
  Severo-Kurilsk and submerged the local fishing plant, officials said. Russian
  state television footage showed buildings and debris swept into the sea. The
  surge of water reached as far as the town’s second world war monument about
  400 meters from the shoreline, said mayor Alexander Ovsyannikov. The initial
  quake also caused limited damage and only light injuries, despite being the
  strongest since 2011, when 15,000 people were killed in Japan. Russian
  scientists reported that the Klyuchevskoy volcano erupted shortly after the
  earthquake. “Red-hot lava is observed flowing down the western slope. There is
  a powerful glow above the volcano and explosions,” said Russia’s Geophysical
  Survey. Wednesday’s quake was the strongest in the Kamchatka region since
  1952, the regional seismic monitoring service said, warning of aftershocks of
  up to 7.5 magnitude. The US Geological Survey said the quake was one of the 10
  strongest tremors recorded since 1900. It was followed by dozens of
  aftershocks that further shook the Russian Far East, including one of 6.9
  magnitude. The USGS said there was a 59% chance of an aftershock of more than
  7.0 magnitude in the next week. With AFP
