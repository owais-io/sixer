  This concludes our live coverage of the second Trump administration for the
  day, but we will be back at it on Thursday morning. Here are the latest
  developments: The leadership of the US Centers for Disease Control and
  Prevention was thrown into chaos after the health department announced the
  Senate-confirmed CDC director, Susan Monarez, was no longer in charge, but her
  lawyers said she refused to resign and had not been fired. First it was
  independent advisory committees and career experts. Then it was the dismissal
  of seasoned scientists. Now, Robert F Kennedy Jr and HHS have set their sights
  on “weaponizing public health for political gain” and “putting millions of
  American lives at risk”, lawyers for Monarez said in a statement. “When CDC
  Director Susan Monarez refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless
  directives and fire dedicated health experts, she chose protecting the public
  over serving a political agenda. For that, she has been targeted. Dr. Monarez
  has neither resigned nor received notification from the White House that she
  has been fired, and as a person of integrity and devoted to science, she will
  not resign.” At least three CDC senior officials resigned after Monarez was
  ousted. One squarely blamed Robert F Kennedy Jr’s leadership. “I am not able
  to serve in this role any longer because of the ongoing weaponization of
  public health,” Dr Demetre Daskalakis, who resigned as director of the
  National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases told colleagues.
  Public health experts are sounding the alarm about the chaos at the CDC, as at
  least three senior leaders resigned following the ouster of the apparent
  ouster of the CDC director. As a Senate-confirmed official, only the president
  has the authority to fire her, and, for once, Donald Trump has been strangely
  silent as this drams unfolded. But the White House press office issued a
  statement saying that Monarez had been removed, not by Trump but by “the White
  House”. While differences over vaccines appear to have been central to the
  rift between the ousted CDC director, Susan Monarez, and Robert F Kennedy Jr,
  the health secretary, Monarez also stood out from her bosses by mourning for
  the officer who died defending the agency’s campus in Atlanta from a gunman
  who was driven by misinformation about the Covid-19 vaccine. While Monarez
  publicly mourned David Rose, who, as our colleague George Chidi wrote, was
  murdered by a lie, others in the CDC were distressed that Kennedy said little,
  and Trump nothing about the attack on their campus. The confusion over whether
  or not Susan Monarez is still the director of the Centers for Disease Control
  and Prevention, after the health department said she was not, and her lawyers
  said she has not resigned or been fired, partly stems from the fact that
  Monarez was confirmed by the Senate last month. As a Senate-confirmed
  official, only the president has the authority to fire her, and, for once,
  Donald Trump has been strangely silent as this drama unfolded on Wednesday
  night. But the White House press office has just issued a statement saying
  that Monarez has been removed, not by Trump but by “the White House”. “As her
  attorney’s statement makes abundantly clear, Susan Monarez is not aligned with
  the President’s agenda of Making America Healthy Again” the White House deputy
  press secretary, Kush Desai, said in a statement to the Guardian. “Since Susan
  Monarez refused to resign despite informing HHS leadership of her intent to do
  so, the White House has terminated Monarez from her position with the CDC.” As
  Aaron Fritschner, an aide to Don Beyer, a Democratic congressman, observed:
  “Don’t think ‘the White House’ has the power to terminate the Director of the
  CDC. The President does, but they didn’t say that he did, which is curious.”
  Public health experts are sounding the alarm about the chaos at the CDC, as at
  least three senior leaders resigned following the apparent ouster of the CDC
  director. “What’s happening at the CDC should frighten every American
  Regardless of whether you are MAGA, MAHA, neither, or don’t give a damn about
  labels or politics. It’s unclear whether the CDC director—confirmed just weeks
  ago—has been fired or not. Absolute shitshow,” Dr Craig Spencer, an emergency
  medicine doctor and professor at Brown University School of Public Health
  posted. “And incredible career professionals resigned tonight, sounding a
  massive alarm,” he added. “This is pure chaos that leaves the country
  unprepared. Imagine cases of Ebola in the U.S. right now? We would be an
  absolute mess.” “RFK, Jr is increasingly becoming a liability for the White
  House,” Dr Jonathan Reiner, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at George
  Washington University, observed. “I doubt the president feels good about RFK’s
  incessant attack on his COVID vaccine triumph and he’s likely not going to be
  pleased that the HHS Sec is usurping the role of the President in
  hiring/firing senate confirmed officials.” “There is a wholesale destruction
  of leadership at the CDC. The newly confirmed Director is out,” Dr Ashish Jha,
  the Biden administration’s coronavirus response coordinator, wrote. “Most of
  the top leaders who run key centers have resigned en masse. Total implosion.
  All because of [Secretary Kennedy’s] leadership. What a complete disaster.” Dr
  Demetre Daskalakis, who resigned on Wednesday from his position as the
  director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at
  the CDC, just posted his full, blistering resignation letter on Instagram. In
  the letter, the veteran public health official blames the views and erratic
  leadership of Robert F Kennedy Jr, the health secretary, for making it
  impossible for him to continue. “I am unable to serve in an environment that
  treats CDC as a tool to generate policies and materials that do not reflect
  scientific reality and are designed to hurt rather than to improve the
  public’s health. The recent change in the adult and children’s immunization
  schedule threaten the lives of the youngest Americans and pregnant people,”
  Daskalakis wrote, in reference to the decision in May, for the CDC to remove
  its recommendation of the Covid-19 vaccine for healthy children and pregnant
  women. He added that the data to support this change was never shared with the
  CDC and that a public information sheet on the change, “written to support the
  Secretary’s directive” was circulated by the health department “without input
  from CDC subject matter experts”. Daskalakis also called out Kennedy’s
  fondness for “social media posts announcing major policy changes” without
  consulting CDC experts in advance. “Having to retrofit analyses and policy
  actions to match inadequately thought-out announcements in poorly scripted
  videos or page long X posts should not be how organizations responsible for
  the health of people should function,” he wrote. “The intentional eroding of
  trust in low-risk vaccines favoring natural infection and unproven remedies
  will bring us to a pre-vaccine era where only the strong will survive and many
  if not all will suffer,” he added. “I believe in nutrition and exercise. I
  believe in making our food supply healthier, and I also believe in using
  vaccines to prevent death and disability. Eugenics plays prominently in the
  rhetoric being generated and is derivative of a legacy that good medicine and
  science should continue to shun.” “The recent shooting at CDC is not why I am
  resigning,” Daskalakis wrote, drawing attention to the gunman who fired
  hundreds of rounds into CDC buildings who was motivated by unfounded theories
  about injuries from the Covid-19 vaccine that Kennedy has promoted. “My
  grandfather, who I am named after, stood up to fascist forces in Greece and
  lost his life doing so. I am resigning to make him and his legacy proud. I am
  resigning because of the cowardice of a leader that cannot admit that HIS and
  his minions’ words over decades created an environment where violence like
  this can occur. I reject his and his colleagues’ thoughts and prayers, and
  advise they direct those to people that they have not actively harmed,”
  Daskalakis wrote. “For decades, I have been a trusted voice for the LGBTQ
  community when it comes to critical health topics,” the doctor, who formerly
  led HIV/AIDS prevention at the CDC, and once dressed in drag to administer
  meningitis vaccines, added. “I must also cite the recklessness of the
  administration in their efforts to erase transgender populations, cease
  critical domestic and international HIV programming, and terminate key
  research to support equity as part of my decision.” Susan Monarez was removed
  from her position as director of the Centers for Disease Control and
  Prevention on Wednesday without being told why she was fired, her lawyers said
  in a statement. “First it was independent advisory committees and career
  experts. Then it was the dismissal of seasoned scientists. Now, Secretary
  Kennedy and HHS have set their sights on weaponizing public health for
  political gain and putting millions of American lives at risk”, her lawyers,
  Mark Zaid and Abbe David Lowell, said in a statement posted on social media.
  “When CDC Director Susan Monarez refused to rubber-stamp unscientific,
  reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts, she chose protecting
  the public over serving a political agenda. For that, she has been targeted.
  Dr. Monarez has neither resigned nor received notification from the White
  House that she has been fired, and as a person of integrity and devoted to
  science, she will not resign.” “This is not about one official,” the lawyers
  added. “It is about the systematic dismantling of public health institutions,
  the silencing of experts, and the dangerous politicization of science. The
  attack on Dr. Monarez is a warning to every American: our evidence-based
  systems are being undermined from within.” The Department of Health and Human
  Services offered no explanation when it announced in an unsigned social media
  post that Monarez, who was confirmed by the Senate as CDC director and sworn
  in by Kennedy just last month, was no longer in charge of the public health
  agency. Sources “who spoke anonymously for fear of retribution”, told the New
  York Times reports that Monarez had objected to sweeping changes to the panel
  of experts who advise the agency on vaccine policy made by Donald Trump’s
  anti-vaccine health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. An administration official
  also told the Times that Kennedy had summoned Monarez to his office on Monday
  and demanded that she resign. After she refused to do so, she called Dr Bill
  Cassidy, the Republican chairman of the Senate health committee. Kennedy then
  accused Monarez of “being a leaker” and said that she would be fired. Hours
  before Monarez left the agency, Kennedy hailed decisions by the Food and Drug
  Administration on Wednesday revoking the emergency use authorization for the
  Covid-19 vaccines manufactured by Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax that CDC experts
  estimate saved 3.2 million lives in the United States. Vaccines from the three
  manufacturers are now authorized by the FDA only for people who are 65 and
  older, or younger people with an underlying medical condition that puts them
  at risk for severe disease. Even those that qualify for the vaccines will only
  be able to get them in the US if the advisory panel, reshaped by Kennedy to
  include Covid vaccine opponents, votes to approve them. Inside Medicine, a
  newsletter written by Jeremy Faust, a public health researcher and emergency
  medicine physician, just published the full text of email statements three CDC
  leaders who resigned on Wednesday sent to their colleagues to explain their
  reasons for leaving the US public health agency after its new director
  abruptly departed. The most explosive charge came from Dr Demetre Daskalakis,
  who stepped down as the director of the National Center for Immunization and
  Respiratory Diseases. “I am not able to serve in this role any longer because
  of the ongoing weaponizing of public health. You are the best team I have ever
  worked with, and you continue to shine despite this dark cloud over the agency
  and our profession,” Daskalakis wrote. “Please take care of yourself and your
  teams and make the right decisions for yourselves.” “For the good of the
  nation and the world, the science at CDC should never be censored or subject
  to political pauses or interpretations,” Dr Deb Houry, the agency’s chief
  medical officer, wrote. “Vaccines save lives – this is an indisputable,
  well-established, scientific fact. Informed consent and shared decision-making
  must focus not only on the risks but also on the true, life-saving benefits
  that vaccines provide to individuals and communities. It is, of course,
  important to question, analyze, and review research and surveillance, but this
  must be done by experts with the right skills and experience, without bias,
  and considering the full weight of scientific evidence. Recently, the
  overstating of risks and the rise of misinformation have cost lives, as
  demonstrated by the highest number of US measles cases in 30 years and the
  violent attack on our agency.” Houry’s statement seemed like a clear response
  to recent statements and actions to limit access to vaccines by the
  anti-vaccine health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr. Dr Daniel Jernigan, who
  resigned as director of the premiere US center for the study of emerging and
  zoonotic infectious diseases, told colleagues: “I believe strongly in the
  mission of public health and the leadership that CDC has given for almost 80
  years; however, given the current context in the Department, I feel it is best
  for me to offer my resignation.” Jernigan, whose center included the CDC’s
  Immunization Safety Office, testified to Congress last year that the CDC
  estimates that the vaccination of children born between 1994 and 2021 “will
  prevent 472 million illnesses and 29.8 million hospitalizations, help avoid
  1,052,000 deaths, and save nearly $2.2 trillion in total societal costs”. He
  also pointed to research that, as of November 2022, Covid-19 vaccines had
  “saved more than 3.2 million lives in the United States, prevented more than
  18.5 million hospitalizations, and averted over $1.15 trillion in healthcare
  costs”. “I am not able to serve in this role any longer because of the ongoing
  weaponization of public health,” Dr Demetre Daskalakis, who resigned on
  Wednesday from his position as the director of the National Center for
  Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC told colleagues in an email
  obtained by STAT, a health news site. Those concerns were echoed by another
  departing CDC leader, Dr Deb Houry, the chief medical officer, who wrote that
  “ongoing changes prevent me from continuing in my job as a leader of the
  agency” adding that science should “never be censored or subject to political
  interpretations”. The two CDC leaders, and their colleague Daniel Jernigan,
  who ran the Center for Emerging Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, quit the agency
  after the abrupt departure of Susan Monarez, the Senate-confirmed director of
  the CDC. US officials announced on Wednesday the departure of the director of
  the nation’s top public health agency, after less than one month in the job.
  “Susan Monarez is no longer director of the Centers for Disease Control and
  Prevention. We thank her for her dedicated service to the American people,”
  the US Department of Health and Human Services wrote in a statement posted on
  social media. HHS officials did not explain why Monarez is no longer with the
  agency. Before the announcement was made, Monarez told the Associated Press:
  “I can’t comment.” Three senior officials at the Centers for Disease Control
  and Prevention resigned on Wednesday after the new CDC director Susan Monarez,
  abruptly left the agency. Shortly after the US Department of Health and Human
  Services, HHS, announced on social media that Monarez “is no longer director
  of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention”, at least three CDC leaders
  resigned: Dr Debra Houry, the chief medical officer; Dr Daniel Jernigan, the
  director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases;
  and Dr Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization
  and Respiratory Diseases. There was no immediate explanation for why any of
  the senior leaders have left the top US public health agency. Monarez was
  sworn in just four weeks ago.
