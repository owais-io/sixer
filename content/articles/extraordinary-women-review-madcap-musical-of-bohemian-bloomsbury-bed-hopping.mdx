  Compton Mackenzie’s lesbian novel was published in the same year as two other
  canonical queer tomes that eclipsed it: Virginia Woolf’s Orlando and Radclyffe
  Hall’s The Well of Loneliness. Here, it is adapted into an arch musical comedy
  by Sarah Travis (score) and Richard Stirling (lyrics). It feels befitting of
  Mackenzie’s rather madcap interwar story featuring a Bloomsbury-style group of
  lesbians on the fictional island of Sirene. Under the nifty direction of Paul
  Foster, we follow their romantic shenanigans, sparked by the seductive central
  figure of Rosalba (Amy Ellen Richardson, magnetic), a Swiss Italian aristocrat
  – and inveterate womaniser. There is the British writer, Aurora (Caroline
  Sheen), who is Rosalba’s longsuffering lover, alongside experimental French
  singer Cleo (Sophie Louise Dann, very funny), who is in a relationship with
  Russian Olga (Monique Young), but might secretly be seeing Rosalba. She, in
  turn, sends romantic signals to anyone within reach, including wealthy
  American composer Olimpia (Amira Matthews) and young Lulu (Jasmine Kerr), who
  has been banished to this island after falling for a man beneath her station.
  More love interests keep developing, it seems, and you slightly lose track,
  but that is the point: this group is so bohemian that it just likes to
  bed-hop. Overseeing the love-struck and lovelorn are ancient Greek
  goddess-like figures, including Sappho, who offer slightly laboured commentary
  on the mortal intrigues. But on the whole it is silly, entertaining and
  excellently performed. There is live music and songs which range from romantic
  whimsy to satirising the avant garde, while the art deco costumes by Carla Joy
  Evans bear a detailed fidelity to the era. An adaptation of Orlando was staged
  in this venue recently and this feels in keeping with that bohemian vibe. But
  it is a less serious work, tongue firmly in its cheek, with actors playing two
  parts and quick costume changes conjuring sense of chaotic mischief. What
  really makes it is the cast; Richardson has more than a touch of Marlene
  Dietrich in her swagger and rakishness. Dann is brilliantly OTT as Cleo while
  Jack Butterworth single-handedly plays all the male parts, from a Scottish
  waiter wounded in the Great War to a foppish friend and an errant fiance. None
  of it quite has a point, its radicalism no doubt more potent in 1928 when the
  book was published. Still, it is certainly worth a revival in this comic vein
  for the sheer fun of it. • At Jermyn Street theatre, London, until 10 August.
