  comedy

  Margaret Qualley’s Chandler-esque private eye Honey O’Donahue is actually not
  that good at her job. That’s one of the many running jokes in Ethan Coen’s
  comic sun-blasted noirish caper Honey Don’t!, in which the titular gumshoe
  even tries to talk a potential client (Billy Eichner, a hoot) out of hiring
  her. Having Honey expose his cheating partner would just be wasting his money,
  she insists. Turns out, she’s right. It’s not that Honey is incapable. She’s
  got all the right instincts, and can typically sniff out the scoundrels in her
  midst. Her brow almost always stays furrowed, especially when she’s in a room
  with men, as if she’s got a resting interrogator face. But she’s rarely
  committed to the assignment, or just too easily distracted by curious subplots
  and hot lesbians to get the job done. The same can be said of Honey Don’t! as
  a whole. The movie is just as liable to amble along on detours or be seduced
  by something or someone on the margins. That’s not necessarily a bad thing.
  It’s kind of integral to the whole vibe. This is Ethan Coen’s second outing –
  after last year’s Drive-Away Dolls – without his brother Joel. The duo is of
  course responsible for The Big Lebowski and No Country For Old Men, among so
  many more sinister classics and larks. But lately they have been taking a
  break, with Coen tagging in his wife Tricia Cooke as co-writer, and
  co-conspirator. Cooke, by the way, identifies as a lesbian. She and Coen have
  a special arrangement as far as their marriage goes, and a very distinct
  sensibility when it comes to their two trashy queered-up takes on B-movie
  genre fare (with a third potentially on the way to round out a loose trilogy).
  Both Drive-Away Dolls and Honey, Don’t! can feel like they’re cruising,
  leisurely if not mischievously, mostly taking in the scenery populated with
  deliciously kooky characters, who run into or away from each other while
  bodies pile up in spurts of hilariously nasty violence, without necessarily
  adding up to much. Gone is the remarkable tension we get in Coen Brothers
  movies that lived between its meticulous artistry and low-brow humour, which
  usually ended up serving each other beautifully. There are times when these
  Coen-Cooke collaborations whiff in that direction. But the fascinating and
  frustrating tension that sticks can be found in the intention when it comes to
  storytelling choices and the slackness in which it all unfolds. But about that
  scenery. It tends to be loaded. Drive-Away Dolls (its original title,
  Drive-Away Dykes, didn’t make it across the finish line) was about two women
  from Philly (played by Qualley and Geraldine Viswanathan) on a pre-Y2K road
  trip to Florida, the red state’s politics only faintly intruding on their
  sexual misadventures. In Honey Don’t!, which is not a period piece, Coen and
  Cooke head to Bakersfield, a Republican nook in California. In the opening
  credits, the film-makers’ names – along with their collaborators – are painted
  into the setting, appearing on vintage signage in the town’s rundown auto
  shops and dives, as if they’re taking up residence in this unattended
  wasteland. While so much about Honey Don’t! feels like amusing digressions,
  the locale, in a movie where a vulnerable population is preyed on by a crooked
  evangelical reverend, is undeniably a choice. Chris Evans plays the Reverend,
  Drew Devlin, the actor laying the smarm on thick as he puts up a futile fight
  against his boy scout charm and dreamy grin. His reverend is a shameless
  narcissist who works dungeon sex into his preaching about pathways to the
  lord, while also using his church as front for his side hustle as
  Bakersfield’s drug kingpin. Qualley’s Honey stumbles into Drew’s orbit when
  she’s snooping around after a troubled would-be client who happened to be a
  member of his congregation is killed in a suspicious car accident. He
  naturally brings out the dickish-ness in her private dick. Actually most men
  do, whether they’re slimy, hopeless or refusing to accept that her being a
  lesbian is a real thing while they keep plying her with advances. On the
  flipside, Honey lets her shoulders down around women, especially those that
  set off her gaydar, like Aubrey Plaza’s cop MG, who she wastes no time
  bedding, and Lera Abova’s alluring femme fatale (so femme she actually might
  be French!) who moseys around town on a Vespa. These characters and more don’t
  so much connect (to each other or some overarching plot) as they brush past
  each other. But Honey’s time with them makes it all worthwhile, because
  Qualley is such a commanding force. She slinks into every scene, all
  husky-voiced and quippy, her character often calling out the tropes in
  everyone and everything while only flirting with becoming one herself. It’s
  hard to stay mad at a movie for refusing to add things up, or resolve its
  mysteries in any traditionally satisfying ways, when getting lost with Qualley
  can be such a pleasure. Besides, following narrative threads through to the
  finish is just playing it too straight for this movie; what with it’s
  delightful disdain for anything that might even remotely be associated with
  hetero. Honey Don’t! is out in US cinemas 22 August, Australia on 28 August
  and in the UK on 5 September
