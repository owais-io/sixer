  She is called the Weeping Woman, but that is an understatement. She grinds her
  teeth on a handkerchief that’s like a jagged white-and-blue spearhead while
  her fingers claw at her face, tearing the flesh to expose her skull. Her chin
  is two grenades, her eyes are filled with horror – black silhouettes of planes
  are held in her transfixed eyeballs. They are the German bombers that attacked
  the Basque town Guernica on 26 April 1937. Picasso’s Weeping Woman was bought
  from him by the British surrealist Roland Penrose in November 1937, fresh off
  the easel. Fifty years later, his son gave it in lieu of tax to the Tate
  Gallery. Now it is about to star in a Tate Modern exhibition that showcases
  the museum’s Picasso collection, enhanced with terrific loans from the Musée
  Picasso in Paris. Weeping Woman is a hair-raising example of Picasso’s feel
  for drama. Tate Modern’s blockbuster, called Theatre Picasso, is “staged”
  rather than curated, by the contemporary film artist Wu Tsang and writer
  Enrique Fuenteblanca in a series of cabaret and theatre-like spaces they hope
  will give visitors “a rhythmic experience”. Picasso, says Tsang, anticipated
  “the fluid relationship that artists have today with performance”. He
  certainly loved a good show. Picasso’s passion for drama included a spectacle
  that ended in real bloodshed – bullfighting. The corridas fuelled some of his
  greatest art. Guernica evolved from visceral, densely compacted paintings he
  did in the 1930s of dying matadors, horses gored by bulls and the artist’s
  alter ego, the man-bull Minotaur. Yet he was equally at home at the ballet,
  creating sets and costumes for the production Parade in 1917 with Jean Cocteau
  and Erik Satie, and going on to collaborate with Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes.
  His first marriage in 1918 was to a dancer in the company, Olga Khokhlova – it
  was disastrous, and the artist’s treatment of women has in recent years been
  heavily scrutinised. The most gossipy exhibit in Theatre Picasso suggests he
  was an opera fan, too: in a clip from a movie shot by Man Ray, the stocky
  painter drags up as the opera heroine Carmen. “It’s a bit of a gem to me to
  see him with the mantilla and the cigar,” says Tsang. But it was his later
  fierce rejection of the world of ballet and high-society elegance that
  produced the greatest Picasso in the Tate collection. The Three Dancers,
  painted in 1925, is violent, apocalyptic and has never calmed down. It’s a
  drama we don’t fully understand but whose brutal denouement we watch like a
  stunned audience. It’s like a stage set, a room with a view, except beyond the
  windows, which are weirdly opaque, is only a blue Mediterranean sky of hard
  pigment suggesting unbreathable air. Life is a theatre, this painting
  suggests, where we move among fake furniture in an illusory set with no
  freedom or space. The people in The Three Dancers unleash themselves in
  Dionysian frenzy. The woman in the centre flings her arms in the air as she
  raises her head to the sky: she is dancing to hot jazz, surely, in 1925, the
  year The Great Gatsby was published. But this dance is lethal. You can feel it
  get faster and madder. On the left, a woman gyrates even more ecstatically,
  twisting over so there seems to be a round hole showing dead sky where her
  heart should be. Her face has the empty nose socket and eyes of a skull. On
  the right, a male dancer has a partly brown, partly white body, suggesting the
  multiculturalism of jazz, more embraced in 1920s France than the
  segregationist US – Josephine Baker first performed in Paris in October that
  year. The Three Dancers is one of Picasso’s crucial revolutionary works. He
  regarded it as better than Guernica and kept it with him until 1965, when he
  sold it directly to the Tate. With its flattened space and overlapping,
  hard-to-read images, the piece helped to revive cubism, an artistic experiment
  that seemed to be have ended by 1914, at the outbreak of the first world war.
  The movement, undertaken by Picasso and Georges Braque from 1907, had asked
  fundamental questions: what is the fabric of reality, and can art see it? By
  1913, when Picasso collaged and drew Bottle of Vieux Marc, Glass, Guitar and
  Newspaper, he and Braque used real things in their art, inventing the
  appropriation of found materials as an artistic technique. Then came the war.
  Picasso stepped back from this dizzying demolition of art as Europeans then
  knew it. Some people even blamed the war on the chaos of cubism. By 1918,
  Picasso participated in the “Call to Order” movement that hoped to restore
  civilisation with a more traditionalist art. Seated Woman in a Chemise from
  1923 is a captivating example of this quieter phase of his work: when Picasso
  chose to draw or paint “properly”, he could do so better than anyone. As he
  justifiably claimed, he was born with the talent of Raphael and had to learn
  to paint like a child. The fuse that set Picasso back on a revolutionary road
  came in 1924, when a younger group of artists, the surrealists, published
  their manifesto declaring that all creativity comes from the unconscious and
  erotic compulsion. The Three Dancers’ jazz age cocktail of cubism and the
  surrealist cult of desire liberated Picasso to create his most pungent
  artworks, including The Acrobat, a wondrous painting of an impossible body,
  and the rampant sculpture Cock (the bird, but it’s truly cocky). The early
  1930s was also when he pursued sex as a Sadeian theatre and discovered
  cubism’s most shocking use – to show all a lover’s orifices at the same time.
  A dazzling work from this era is his 1936 print Faun Revealing a Sleeping
  Woman, in which he changes into a mythic creature looking at his lover with
  unabashed voyeurism. Picasso’s scandalous theatre of sex and death gave him
  the imaginative power to do what few other artists managed: make art that
  fought fascism. The year he painted Weeping Woman, there were bombers in his
  eyes. In his loft in a 17th-century building on Rue des Grands Augustins,
  Paris, he planned and executed the gut-wrenching Guernica, which he finished
  by early June and unveiled in July in the Spanish Pavilion at the Paris
  international exhibition. Picasso is certainly theatrical, but his true genre
  is tragedy. The Weeping Woman cannot stop herself seeing those murderous
  planes. The nightmare is turning her skin green, as if she rots. Yet a
  honeybee sucks from a tear: out of this paralysed rage, some hope might come,
  if people act. The Weeping Woman is often identified with his lover Dora Maar,
  but why are her fingers so chunky? They look more like Picasso’s. Just as he
  could imagine himself as Carmen, Picasso is the woman weeping, merging with
  Maar in grief for the murdered of Guernica and those yet to die in the age of
  total war. When I look at Guernica now I see Gaza, I see Ukraine. When I look
  at Picasso’s satirical strip The Dream and Lie of Franco, I see today’s
  far-right populists and new-style dictators. Picasso lived in a time of
  emergency and so, it seems, do we. He was far from a perfect human being in
  his private life. But he was ultimately a political artist who acted in
  history. On that stage he was on the side of the angels – and of the Weeping
  Woman. Scene setters: works from the Tate exhibition Bust of a Woman, 1909
  Picasso was making sculpture for the first time, carving raw wooden images
  that pay homage to African art, when he painted this early cubist “portrait”.
  This woman has rough-hewn wooden body parts and a featureless face, as the
  artist takes apart the European belief that pictures must be clear, legible
  perspective windows on the world. Bottle of Vieux Marc, Glass, Guitar and
  Newspaper, 1913 For a cubist painting, this is easy to make sense of: the
  guitar body is a white silhouette, part of the glass is sketched beside it,
  and the bottle recognisable by “Vieux” on its label. But why did he paste in
  such an old (1883) sheet from Le Figaro? Perhaps it mourns a bohemian cafe
  lifestyle that was already old. The Three Dancers, 1925 Picasso signed this
  painting in 1965 when he sold it to the Tate – he’d kept it until then. He
  also revealed: “While I was painting this picture, an old friend of mine,
  Ramon Pichot, died and I have always felt that it should be called The Death
  of Pichot rather than The Three Dancers.” Pichot’s profile is the silhouette
  on the right of this jazz-age nightmare. The Acrobat, 1930 Picasso was
  fascinated by circus folk. These performers star in his early Rose Period
  paintings, holding horses, balancing on balls or gathering in a family group
  with a clown as its patriarch. Here, he purifies what it means to be an
  acrobat: this character is all arms and legs, with no torso, as it contorts
  inconceivably. The closed eyes tell us it’s a dream – this is a surrealist
  vision. Nude Woman in a Red Armchair, 1932 Cubism was often seen as ugly in
  its distortions of the human figure, but here Picasso uses it to glorify his
  lover Marie Thérèse-Walter, composing her face from two different views,
  full-on and in half-moon profile. He suggests she has got two personalities:
  one daylit, the other nocturnal, mysterious. Cock, 1932, cast 1952 Picasso was
  a brilliant sculptor in a casually magical way, as this incredibly alive,
  spiky creation illustrates. Perhaps it is now in his three-dimensional
  creations, from a bull’s head made from bike parts to a baboon incorporating
  his son’s toy car, that the infectious fun of his creativity and playfulness
  can be felt most. Weeping Woman, 1937 It was in the 1930s that Britain woke up
  to Picasso, and to modern art, of which he was the recognised leader. A
  generation galvanised by the Spanish civil war and angered by appeasement of
  Hitler responded to Picasso’s protest art. In 1939, Guernica was shown at the
  Whitechapel Gallery, while Weeping Woman came here permanently in the year it
  was painted. Theatre Picasso is at Tate Modern, London, from 17 September to
  12 April.
