  The number of asylum seekers being housed in hotels has risen by 8% to 32,059
  in a year, according to Home Office data. The data also shows that the
  government is processing asylum applications much more quickly, with 71,000
  cases awaiting approval, relating to 91,000 people, compared with 134,000 two
  years ago. The figures come amid growing clamour from councils to block hotels
  being used to house asylum seekers through legal action, after a court ruled
  that more than 100 applicants staying in Essex should be removed. The high
  court judgment has led to ministers bracing for further legal challenges from
  across the country and pressure on the government to find other places to
  house people. The latest Home Office figures, published on Thursday as part of
  the usual quarterly immigration statistics, cover Labour’s first year in
  office. There were 32,059 asylum seekers in UK hotels by the end of June, up
  from 29,585 at the same point a year earlier, when the Conservatives were
  still in power, but down slightly on the 32,345 figure at the end of March.
  The latest number is still below the peak of 56,042 asylum seekers in hotels
  at the end of September 2023 under the Tories. For the first time in four
  years, the asylum applications backlog has fallen below 100,000 people. It is
  now just over 70,000 cases, relating to almost 91,000 people – down by 18%
  from a year earlier and its lowest since September 2021. In the year ending
  June 2025, the Home Office forcibly removed 9,100 people – up a quarter on the
  previous year. More than half were foreign national offenders who were being
  deported at the end of sentences. Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the
  Refugee Council, said: “Bringing the asylum system back from the brink of
  collapse is a genuine achievement in the government’s first year. The increase
  in asylum decisions means refugees can begin to rebuild their lives sooner,
  and the use of costly hotels can be ended faster.” Yvette Cooper, the home
  secretary, said: “The action we have taken in the last 12 months – increasing
  returns of failed asylum seekers by over 30%, cutting asylum costs by 11%,
  reducing the backlog by 18% and our forthcoming plans to overhaul the failing
  asylum appeal system – are crucial steps to restoring order, and putting an
  end to the chaotic use of asylum hotels that we inherited from the previous
  government.” On Tuesday, the Conservative-run authority in Epping Forest won a
  temporary high court injunction to remove people from the Bell hotel. About
  140 asylum seekers must leave the hotel by 12 September after the high court
  imposed a temporary injunction against them staying there. The Labour-run
  Wirral and Tamworth councils are among more than 10 that are reportedly
  considering legal challenges to close hotels housing asylum seekers in their
  area. On Tuesday, Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, named three
  Conservative councils that were considering legal action in efforts to shut
  down asylum hotels in their areas. Asked how many Tory councils were
  considering legal action, he told BBC Breakfast: “There are certainly a number
  who are actively considering it. Broxbourne, which is next door to Epping, is
  one of them. I think Reigate and Banstead is another, Hillingdon is yet a
  third. “So, I think there are many up and down the country who are looking at
  this following the Epping ruling.” Whitehall sources said the government was
  expected to appeal against the Epping ruling. Charles Falconer, a Labour peer
  who served as justice secretary under Tony Blair and was previously Starmer’s
  shadow attorney general, urged ministers to appeal. He told the BBC Radio 4
  Today programme the judgment “causes great problems” because it “gives rise to
  the expectation that some asylum hotels can be closed” but without indicating
  which ones. “I very strongly urge the government – I don’t know what they’re
  going to do – to appeal and get some certainty, first of all on which should
  be closed … and which shouldn’t, secondly to deal with the question of a
  reasonable timescale in relation to this, and thirdly to deal with this very
  troublesome issue: namely, do demonstrations outside these hostels lead it to
  it being more likely that they will be closed,” he said. The Democratic
  Unionist party (DUP) is also seeking to remove asylum seekers from hotels in
  Northern Ireland after the landmark ruling in England. Antrim &amp;
  Newtownabbey borough council has launched an enforcement investigation into
  the use of the Chimney Corner in Mallusk to house asylum seekers after a
  complaint by the DUP Stormont assembly member Trevor Clarke. The party – the
  second-biggest in Northern Ireland – would also lodge complaints about the
  other two hotels that house asylum seekers in two other council areas, Clarke
  said. Wednesday’s high court ruling that the Bell hotel in Essex cannot be
  used to house asylum seekers because of a breach of planning rules paved the
  way for similar legal challenges, Clarke said. “Housing asylum seekers in
  hotels without first securing a ‘change of use’ through the proper planning
  process (from hotel to hostel or immigration centre accommodation) constitutes
  a breach of planning regulations. No one is above the law, not even government
  departments. If the Home Office or its contractors wish to place large numbers
  of illegal immigrants into our communities, they must follow the same planning
  rules as everyone else.” The other hotels that house asylum seekers in
  Northern Ireland were in the Causeway Coast and Glens and the Ards and North
  Down council areas, the Irish News reported. Home Office spending on asylum in
  the UK stood at £4.76bn in 2024-25, down 12% from a record £5.38bn in 2023-24,
  government figures show. The total covers all Home Office costs related to
  asylum, including direct cash support and accommodation, plus wider staffing
  and other migration and borders activity. Asylum seekers and their families
  can be housed in temporary accommodation, known as contingency accommodation,
  if they are awaiting assessment of their claim or have had a claim approved
  and there is not enough longer-term accommodation available. When there is not
  enough housing, the Home Office, which has a legal obligation to provide
  accommodation to asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute, can move
  people to alternatives such as hotels and large sites, such as former military
  bases.
