  Jess Cartner-Morley on fashion: Forget date night – I’d much rather dress up
  to party with my friends

  It is strange that we talk about date-night dressing so much when we all know
  that the most fun nights to outfit-plan are really nights out with friends.
  Well, not actually strange at all, just the patriarchy doing what it does, I
  guess, and making it feel as if the world as seen from a male point of view –
  in this case, the view of a frock from the other side of a restaurant table on
  date night – is automatically the point of view that matters. In a fashion
  context, it just makes no sense. I mean, I accept that I’m generalising wildly
  here, and I don’t for a moment claim to speak for everyone. But my own
  experience, which I would wager is a fairly common one, is that it is an
  evening out with friends when I’m going to get maximum appreciation for the
  fashion content of my outfit. Men just want you to look … nice? Which is fine,
  but there’s a lot more to style than that. Like I say, I am generalising, and
  not all dates are boy-girl anyway, but still: for many women, dressing up for
  friends is one of life’s under-appreciated joys. On a friends night, you can
  be wildly overdressed for pizza and your pals will appreciate your look for
  what it is: enthusiasm for their company. Or you can turn up in your work
  clothes because you had to run straight from the office, and they won’t give a
  toss and just be thrilled to see you. You can wear your new leather trousers
  and know you will get the chance to tell, at great length, the triumphant
  story of how you tracked them down on Vinted. You can wear totally impractical
  shoes and nobody will roll their eyes when it means you have to get an Uber to
  a bar a quarter of a mile away. Fashion is a love language in female
  friendship. It is woven into the fabric of camaraderie between women. There is
  no place on earth where you will be more generously complimented than in front
  of the mirrors of the ladies’ loos, after everyone involved has had a few
  spicy margs. I’m not being sexist – it might well be that the same goes for
  men, but I don’t hang out by the urinals so I can’t speak to that. What I can
  tell you is that chat about clothes is, first and foremost, a delivery
  mechanism for support and cheerleading, woman to woman. Wear something bold,
  and you will get flowers for your originality; wear something low-key, and you
  will be lauded for your subtle good taste. Style is a channel of
  communication. Some features will always get a mention, when women talk about
  clothes. For instance: dresses and skirts that have pockets. Responding “it
  has pockets!” when another woman remarks upon what you are wearing is
  shorthand for “I enjoy fashion even though I have more important things to
  think about, and I think I recognise you as a kindred spirit”. See also:
  responding to an admiring comment about a pretty pair of shoes by saying they
  are “surprisingly comfy” and playing down your snazzy dress by revealing,
  without being asked, that it is 10 years old and from Zara. But the love
  language of fashion between the girls isn’t just about solidarity, it is about
  joy. It is about clothes that are chosen not because they make you look taller
  or thinner, but because they make you smile. Which are, of course, the clothes
  that make you truly beautiful. It is about outfits that get captured in
  selfies, that you treasure not because of what you were wearing but because of
  the good time you had, and so are knitted into core memories. Nights out with
  friends, with pals who know your silly side as well as your smart side, who
  might rib you for wearing double leopard-print but would defend to the hilt
  your right to do so if anyone said a word against it, are the nights that are
  the most fun to get dressed for. Date night does not have a monopoly on love.
  Model: Amaka at Milk. Hair and makeup: Sophie Higginson using Bumble &amp;
  Bumble and Refy. Cherry earrings, £14, bag, £46, and heels, £44, all River
  Island. Top, £45.99, and trousers, £27.99, both Zara
