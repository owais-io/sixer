  Newly installed river barriers held back record levels of flooding and
  prevented widespread damage in Alaska’s capital city on Wednesday, after an
  ice dam at the nearby Mendenhall Glacier released a huge surge of rainwater
  and snowmelt, officials said. Water pooled on several streets and in some
  yards in Juneau after the Mendenhall River crested earlier in the day, and
  high water was expected to persist for hours. But many residents in the flood
  zone had evacuated before peak water levels, and there were no damage reports
  similar to the past two summers, when about 300 homes were flooded. The
  temporary barriers “really have protected our community”, Juneau city manager
  Katie Koester told a news conference. “If it weren’t for them, we would have
  hundreds and hundreds of flooded homes.” On Tuesday morning, authorities
  confirmed that water had started escaping the ice dam, with flooding expected
  into Wednesday. Some Juneau residents in the flood zone had already evacuated
  as officials intensified their warnings on Tuesday, saying: “Don’t wait,
  Evacuate TONIGHT.” The National Weather Service (NWS) office in Juneau said in
  an X post late on Tuesday that local hydrologists had adjusted their
  Mendenhall flooding forecast, anticipating that the river would crest at over
  16ft on Wednesday morning. Nicole Ferrin, with the NWS, said during a briefing
  on Tuesday that the flood warning was issued after “a lot of analysis” but the
  calculations were complicated by rainfall causing significant rising of the
  lake and river and confirmed that a sub-glacial release had occurred. “This
  will be a new record based on all of the information we have,” Ferrin said,
  according to the Juneau Empire. City officials responded to concerns from
  property owners this year by working with state, federal and tribal entities
  to install a temporary levee along roughly 2.5 miles (4km) of riverbank in an
  attempt to prevent widespread flooding. The 10,000 “Hesco” barriers are
  essentially giant, reinforced sandbags intended to protect more than 460
  properties, said emergency manager Ryan O’Shaughnessy. Some water did seep
  into yards through drains that had been installed under the barriers. In other
  spots, trees floating down the river struck and damaged the barriers,
  officials said. But the fortified wall largely held. The Mendenhall Glacier
  fills a large valley north of Juneau, creating an ice dam for a meltwater lake
  that fills Suicide Basin. Since 2011, outburst floods from the depression have
  been pouring into Mendenhall Lake and rushing down the river toward Juneau
  each year. But the annual Mendenhall glacial lake outburst flood is judged to
  be intensifying as a result of climate change. The National Oceanic and
  Atmospheric Association (Noaa), said in a statement that Alaska had warmed
  twice as fast as the rest of the US over the last several decades. Over the
  last century, Alaska’s average annual temperature has risen 3.1F and the
  overall trend continues to increase, according to data from Noaa’s National
  Centers for Environmental Information. Scientists have attributed the retreat,
  melting and thinning of glaciers over the last century to Earth’s warming
  climate. Alaska’s glaciers are among the fastest-melting glaciers on Earth and
  have been in steep decline since the late 1980s, according to the Alaska
  Climate Science Center. On the record amounts of water that threatened Juneau,
  Rick Thoman, Alaska climate specialist at the Alaska Center for Climate
  Assessment and Policy, told Climate.gov, Noaa reported: “Without climate
  change, there is no reason to think that this would be happening on the
  Mendenhall Glacier, then in the lake, and downriver.” An outburst in August
  2023 sent record amounts of water into Mendenhall Lake and down Mendenhall
  River toward Juneau, inundating areas that had not experienced flooding
  before, the NWS office in Juneau said at the time, causing significant
  erosion. The Mendenhall Glacier is about 12 miles from Juneau and considered a
  popular tourist attraction. Juneau lies 800 miles (1,300km) from Anchorage,
  where Donald Trump and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, are due to meet
  on Friday to discuss the war in Ukraine. Flooding from the glacier has become
  an annual concern for almost 15 years, and in recent years has swept away
  houses and swamped hundreds of homes. It is blamed on the retreat of a smaller
  glacier near Mendenhall Glacier – a casualty of the heating climate – and left
  a basin that fills with rainwater and snowmelt each spring and summer. When
  the water creates enough pressure, it forces its way under or around the ice
  dam created by the blue-ice Mendenhall glacier. The Mendenhall was originally
  named Sitaantaagu (“the Glacier Behind the Town”) or Aak’wtaaksit (“the
  Glacier Behind the Little Lake”) by the Tlingit Indians, but later called Auke
  (Auk) Glacier, for the Auk Kwaan band of Tlingit Indians, by naturalist John
  Muir. It was renamed in 1892 for Thomas Corwin Mendenhall, who had helped
  determine the boundary between Canada and Alaska. It is considered a relic of
  the little ice age that lasted until the mid-18th century and is now receding
  at about 100-150ft (30-45 meters) a year. The Associated Press contributed
