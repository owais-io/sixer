  A sixth MP has now left Keir Starmer’s government since Labour won power in
  2024. Here is a rundown of those who have left since Labour came to power on 4
  July 2024. Rushanara Ali The homelessness minister resigned after it emerged
  tenants of a property she owns who had not had their lease renewed because she
  planned to sell the property had seen the same property back up for let with a
  substantial rent increase shortly afterwards. Her spokesperson said the
  property had been put up for sale, and the tenants offered the chance to stay
  until that process ended. But Ali said she stepped down to avoid “becoming a
  distraction” from the government’s work. Vicky Foxcroft The Labour whip,
  responsible for ensuring discipline among the party’s MPs, herself resigned
  because she could not support the government’s welfare plans. Foxcroft, a
  shadow disability minister before the general election, said she would not be
  able to vote for cuts to disability payments. Anneliese Dodds The
  international development minister quit over Starmer’s decision to almost
  halve the international aid budget to pay for an increase in defence spending.
  Dodds had worked closely with the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell in
  the past and her presence by Starmer’s side had been seen by some as an
  indication he would not turn his back entirely on the left of the party.
  Andrew Gwynne Sacked as a health minister and suspended from the party after
  it emerged he had sent messages in which he said he hoped a pensioner who did
  not support him would die before the next set of elections, and made racist
  and sexist comments – including some about Angela Rayner and Diane Abbott.
  Tulip Siddiq The anti-corruption minister resigned over claims that her family
  ties to her aunt Sheikh Hasina – the ousted prime minister of Bangladesh
  accused of corruption – were harming the government. While an investigation
  found no evidence Siddiq had broken any rules, it was suggested she could have
  been more alive to the reputational risks. She resigned, saying that to stay
  would have been a “distraction from the work of the government”. Louise Haigh
  Haigh resigned after it emerged she had pleaded guilty to a fraud offence
  after wrongly reporting a mobile phone stolen to the police. Haigh was told to
  resign by No 10 for a possible breach of the ministerial code. Haigh said the
  offence was spent and sources said she had declared the conviction to Starmer
  upon becoming a shadow minister in 2020. But a No 10 source said they did not
  believe she had been fully transparent and that her departure was more to do
  with that than with the original offence. • This article was amended on 8
  August 2025. An earlier version of the main image misidentified the MP Oliver
  Ryan as Andrew Gwynne.
