  ‘He made me so happy I forgot about my spots’ Michael Palin Along with Spike
  Milligan, Peter Sellers lit up my teenage years. I knew that Connie Francis
  would never return my love, but Spike and Peter delivered something almost as
  good – and that was deep, satisfying and highly contagious laughter. Laughter
  that made me so happy I forgot about my spots. Spike was the imaginative
  genius who wrote The Goon Show but it was Sellers who brought me to tears with
  his gallery of unforgettable characters: Major Bloodnok, Bluebottle, Henry
  Crun, Hercules Grytpype-Thynne. He was my hero long before I knew what he
  looked like. On my first day at Oxford university, I made a lifetime
  friendship founded on a mutual adoration of the album Songs for Swingin
  Sellers (with a pair of legs swinging from a branch on the cover). Sellers was
  not just a man of many voices, he was a gifted actor, and each voice came with
  a character. The more I heard him the more I wanted to be like him. He showed
  me there was something far more important than sport and girls and modern
  history class, and that was making people laugh. ‘His funniness was just
  magically there’ Woody Allen All I can say about Peter was that apart from all
  his character skills and voices and technical brilliance, he had a built-in
  funny quality and made you laugh the minute he appeared on screen. It’s
  nothing you can learn and very few even successful comics have it. I’m sure
  there was nothing he could do to produce it or understand it himself. It was
  just magically there, that funniness. ‘I remember thinking: “Is it possible to
  die from laughing?”’ Sanjeev Bhaskar When I was a kid, my parents and their
  friends would have these dinner parties, for want of a better term, where the
  children were all fed first and then shoved into a room with the telly. One
  night, a film called The Party came on the TV, the one where Sellers plays an
  Indian actor. I watched it and I remember thinking: “Is it possible to die
  from laughing?” Because I was laughing so much I was in pain. It’s a
  controversial film now but I still love it, in the same way that I always
  defend It Ain’t Half Hot Mum. We’re living in a time where people strip things
  of context, and either celebrate or denigrate things. But for me his
  performance was so funny and it was so deftly done. Given its time, I don’t
  find anything offensive about it. I think, crucially, he wasn’t trying to be
  offensive. He had already played an Indian character in The Millionairess with
  Sophia Loren and that was why I suggested their song title, Goodness Gracious
  Me, for our sketch show, because it’s reclaiming it. It sounds more grand than
  it really was, but we were trying to suggest a changing of the guard. But
  again, I wasn’t offended as a child and I’m not offended as an adult. I think
  it’s of its time. You wouldn’t do that now – you’d find a good Asian actor to
  play the part – but I always had an affection for him. I think of the 10 years
  after The Ladykillers (1955) as peak Sellers, until Dr Strangelove (1964) – a
  work of genius. That period includes the first two Pink Panther films, The
  Pink Panther (1963) and A Shot in the Dark (1964), which is, I think, my
  favourite Clouseau. His brilliance until then is to do with the precision of
  his performances in terms of character, of vocalising and comic timing. Maybe
  he was trying to prove himself – his Fred Kite in I’m All Right Jack is a
  performance without ego. Then he suddenly became a global star, and I think
  that status meant he became less precise in his performances – until we get to
  Being There which was him back to his best: a really precise, detailed
  performance. There is a lot that has been written and said about Sellers and
  what always stuck with me was that his big fear was if you stripped away his
  characters you wouldn’t find anything there. Blake Edwards said he had the
  best working times ever with him – and the worst. So I think that he was
  obviously a complicated person but when you look at it in terms of sheer
  talent, he was blessed. I don’t think there’s ever been a better comic actor.
  ‘I met him for dinner – it was like going to meet the queen’ Lesley-Anne Down
  My father, like the rest of the country, absolutely adored The Goon Show, and
  I grew up listening to it. When I did The Pink Panther Strikes Again in 1976,
  I was working with an icon – I mean, not even human, he was like a god. The
  first time I met him was in Munich. The publicist on the movie said Peter
  wants to have dinner with you, and I remember they were really tense about it.
  They said: don’t do this, and don’t say that, and, you know, just be a certain
  way. It was like going to meet the queen. It made me very tense as well, but
  within five minutes we just hit it off. Obviously I was a bit younger than he
  was, he was my dad’s age, but we got on exceptionally well. And unlike any
  amount of men that I have worked with or come into contact with on both sides
  of the camera, he was a total gentleman for the entire shoot. And it was a
  very long shoot. Today it would have taken about three weeks, but because it
  was Peter it was 14 weeks. He’d just be laughing and playing jokes and tricks
  all day long, sometimes we never actually got a shot completed. We hung out
  basically day and night for 14 weeks. The crew was huge. It must have cost a
  fortune but everyone was on board with it, it was like being at a comedy show.
  Everybody laughing, everybody having fun. I mean, it really was an amazing
  experience. He didn’t sleep very much, he liked to stay up all night and end
  up in the clubs. He loved [vocal ensemble] The Manhattan Transfer, which at
  the time was a great sound. He smoked a bit of dope, too. I don’t think Peter
  really liked himself particularly, but a lot of comedians are that way.
  They’re depressed and they cover it up with laughter. He was always searching
  for happiness, and people didn’t take tremendous care of themselves back then.
  Nobody said, I’ve got to go to the gym or the treadmill; people just ate and
  drank what they wanted and did what they wanted. I knew there was a side of
  Peter that could be difficult or disruptive. I had been told about it, but I
  don’t remember any of that. I think there was one day that Peter and Blake
  [Edwards] were sitting in their chairs on set, and they were a little bit
  tense and not talking to each other. I don’t know what that was about, I
  wasn’t privy to it. But that was the only time that I ever saw anything. I
  didn’t see Peter being cross or upset or nasty or anything. I only saw his
  funny, jolly, kind side. We got on like a house on fire. He was a genius.
  Seriously, what a career. ‘When he did films for directors that knew enough to
  give him freedom, the results were great’ Christopher Guest I met Peter
  Sellers once. The cast of Beyond the Fringe stayed with my family in New York,
  and I had the effrontery to ask Jonathan Miller if I could be his assistant.
  So I went to London and worked on his BBC film of Alice in Wonderland. We were
  doing some recording at Shepperton studios, and Sellers stopped by. It’s hard
  to believe I did this, as I was 19, but I thought it was a good idea to start
  doing a voice that I thought he should hear. He didn’t say anything: he just
  looked at me and nodded. I had seen everything he’d done, heard most of what
  he’d done; he was a very important person for me in the beginning of my
  career. I guess I fancied that I could do the same thing, like doing different
  voices. You see, I can do a voice, but Sellers was embedded in those
  characters, and that commitment made it very different. Obviously he was
  funny, but he did something that no one else was doing. His early films are
  fantastic, including the ones where he has smaller parts. Obviously the
  Kubrick stuff is surreal in many ways, he was given the freedom to do what he
  did. People just didn’t work that way and when he did films for directors that
  knew enough to let him do that, the results were great. Blake Edwards is not a
  great comedy director but he was smart enough to let Sellers take off and do
  what he did. This is a little embarrassing, but I remember when he had his
  first big heart attack in the 60s. I heard about it on the radio. I remember
  getting extremely upset and actually praying. I had never prayed in my life,
  and I haven’t since. But I thought, please, to just whoever, I prayed that he
  would not die. ‘If he was on, it would be like a raging bushfire’ Geoffrey
  Rush I remember seeing Tom Thumb when I was seven – a studio picture, but
  Sellers was still a Goon. At that stage, he hadn’t decided to make a jump for
  film stardom. Because at the time, being a Goon was a privileged position. He
  had a 10-year contract, he and Spike were absurdists and were jazz guys. They
  put that into their comedy. When I played him [in 2004’s The Life and Death of
  Peter Sellers], I researched the role for the picture, and I found a copy of
  almost every Sellers film that existed. You can see the sense of adventure
  that he had with the early films: Carlton-Browne of the FO, I’m All Right
  Jack, The Mouse That Roared. I asked everyone if they’d met him. My publicist
  in the US was a young man who once had to go around to his house and shift
  some furniture. He said Sellers was very brusque and had no truck with some
  nobody from some agency. I found that quite interesting. I also met Marty Baum
  at [talent agency] CAA who handled a lot of Sellers’ contracts in the 70s.
  Marty said: a lot of people thought Sellers was complicated, a mess and
  whatever, but I only ever saw an erudite, very polite, very articulate, very
  intelligent gentleman opposite me at my desk. These are the some of the mosaic
  bits that we put together to make a biographical film. We wanted to take on
  the complexity of egomania, super talent, genius. Sellers would have been
  around so many buzzy, brilliant actors in his career, but unlike him they all
  didn’t know how to define themselves. People often asked me how I related to
  him; and I would say: I went in every day and every day in front of the mirror
  I played somebody else. I think there would be some psychic wear and tear from
  that. There was something in his personality that was very self-regarding but
  I would imagine he could have been absolutely hilarious to be with. If he was
  on, it would have been like a raging bushfire. And ultimately, when he gets to
  Being There (1979), that performance is as subtle as the greatest Chekhovian
  performance in a theatre. The thing I remember is his little round dark eyes
  being so childlike, his skin being so pink and papery from being hidden away
  from the world. I regard that as the work of a truly great performer. ‘I heard
  The Goons and it was like a curtain had been drawn back’ Michael McKean We had
  never heard of Peter Sellers in the US until a flurry in the early 60s. All of
  a sudden we had Tom Thumb, The Mouse That Roared, The Naked Truth, Two Way
  Stretch and I’m All Right Jack, which I didn’t quite understand because, at
  12, I wasn’t a union member. He was just a brilliant actor and, of course, in
  The Mouse That Roared he played three really distinct characters. I found the
  whole thing thrilling. And then I had a friend who said, “Hey, have you ever
  heard of The Goon Show?” I think they were on WQXR and, my God, it was like a
  curtain had been drawn back. It was very well crafted anarchy and lunacy. And
  later he was so brilliant in Lolita and Dr Strangelove; there was a kind of an
  anarchic quality to what he was doing, but it was never out of control. It was
  being done by an artist, clearly, and not a clown. I was aware that a lot of
  the people who made me laugh or who thrilled me as actors were British; Alec
  Guinness, Stan Laurel and Boris Karloff. So anyway, I had my eyes wide open
  for good stuff, no matter who was purveying it. I must have seen Dr
  Strangelove a dozen times and in one viewing I just concentrated on Sellers
  and watched the small work he was doing as Group Captain Lionel Mandrake. What
  I love about his work is the little stuff. I didn’t really hear about his
  private life until well afterwards. And still it is, to me, less interesting
  than his work. I remember reading Being There and then two years later seeing
  the film and I’m thinking: he gets this character better than the writer Jerzy
  Kosinski did. Sellers took this character and made his simplicity so
  complicated. I think that’s what’s so great about that performance. He was
  never a stick figure, and he was never just there for the comedy. ‘I was
  knocked out by the sheer exuberance and the talent’ Paul Merton I was slightly
  too young for The Goons when they were being broadcast, so the biggest impact
  on me was the 50th anniversary Last Goon Show of All in 1972, which was
  released as an LP. I was so knocked out by the sheer exuberance and the
  talent, and I used to listen to the records and practice until I could do the
  same impressions. I just loved the sort of films Sellers was in, things like
  I’m All Right Jack and The Wrong Arm of the Law, which is absolutely
  astonishing. So I became a bit of a Peter Sellers obsessive. My favourite film
  of his is one that’s quite obscure, The Magic Christian, which is normally
  mentioned as “other disappointments”. But what other film has both Michael
  Aspel and Roman Polanski in it? The thing about Sellers is that he made more
  bad films than any other major star. You can look at his career in simplistic
  terms as being before the heart attack and after. He had the good fortune to
  be living half an hour from the planet’s best heart hospital in Los Angeles,
  otherwise we would have been talking about him in the same breath as someone
  like James Dean. Graham Stark, who knew Sellers longer than most people, said
  that after the heart attack, he became a completely different person. The
  string of films he made in Britain have all got merit, but things got awkward
  after he went to Hollywood. In the UK, he was a big fish in a small pond, and
  he could bend people to his will, but he couldn’t do that in Hollywood. One of
  the reasons he never won an Oscar was that he just really upset people in the
  US. He was nominated for Dr Strangelove but he lost to Rex Harrison in My Fair
  Lady; what a kick in the teeth that must have been. He’d made so many enemies
  in Hollywood at that point. He wasn’t kissing anybody’s arse. In the past
  three years, I’ve been watching his films in sequence, and Being There comes
  as like a great beacon of joy towards the end of a miserable run of movies. It
  shows that he hadn’t lost his talent, he had just been in so many awful films.
  On Being There, he didn’t have any arguments with anybody, he admired the
  director, Hal Ashby, there were no tantrums. It was clearly a film that he
  wanted to do and that one still stands up, particularly in the age of Trump,
  where somebody can be misunderstood as a potential presidential candidate. ‘He
  could be eccentric, unpredictable and maddening’ Dick Clement My generation
  viewed listening to The Goon Show as a holy ritual. In school we imitated all
  the voices. Our parents could not understand our obsession, a generational
  thing. I worked only once with Peter on a forgettable movie: The Prisoner of
  Zenda. He played two parts, but I think he got bored. Blake Edwards, who
  directed him in The Pink Panther said that it was vital to capture him at the
  right moment, rather like the “magic hour” that film crews call dawn or dusk.
  On location in Vienna, Ian la Frenais and I quickly discovered that he was
  nostalgic about the old days. The Goons of course, but he liked to delve even
  further back to his time on the music hall circuit, long before fame. He
  thought ventriloquists, “vents” for short, were especially crazy. One called
  Jimmy Tattersall used several dummies in his act, and the climax involved a
  life-sized old lady operated by remote control, who appeared from the wings
  while he was singing My Old Dutch. On numerous occasions the old lady
  malfunctioned, took a savage left turn and ended in the orchestra pit. Peter
  loved that story. He could be eccentric, unpredictable and maddening, but
  there was never any doubt of his extraordinary talent. ‘He was like a musician
  nailing every beat’ Stephen Wight Peter Sellers was a chameleon, one I learned
  a lot about playing his role in the original stage production of The
  Ladykillers. These days we associate physical transformation with huge weight
  loss or gain. Getting ripped for a role so our performer can be an action
  hero. Sellers saw physical transformation beyond the “outer” and embodied his
  choices with wondrous results. Some were subtle, some were extreme, but always
  believable and real. In The Pink Panther Strikes Again there is this wonderful
  taut and uptight nature to Clouseau which creates a tension and fragility that
  provides such a glorious platform from the comedy to spring from or break
  into. The juxtaposition of his arrogant, savoir faire vocal performance paired
  with the chaotic and clownish physicality of character is amazing. His mastery
  of “playing it straight” yet just on the edge of complete absurdism is nothing
  short of genius. The scene in which he arrives at the house to interrogate the
  staff is theatrical farce at its best captured on film. Sellers is like a
  dancer waltzing between characters and objects, like a musician nailing every
  beat and flowing with the rhythm of it all. The scene crackles with a sense of
  everyone on the verge of corpsing. He was funny as hell and made it look
  effortless. Sellers achieved something every actor strives for but thinks
  probably doesn’t exist … perfection. • A Peter Sellers season runs at the BFI
  Southbank, London, from 2-30 August, and Two Way Stretch and Heavens Above are

He was never a stick figure, and he was never just there for the comedy. ‘I was knocked out by the sheer exuberance and the talent’ Paul Merton I was slightly too young for The Goons when they were being broadcast, so the biggest impact on me was the 50th anniversary Last Goon Show of All in 1972, which was released as an LP. I was so knocked out by the sheer exuberance and the talent, and I used to listen to the records and practice until I could do the same impressions. I just loved the sort of films Sellers was in, things like I’m All Right Jack and The Wrong Arm of the Law, which is absolutely astonishing. So I became a bit of a Peter Sellers obsessive. My favourite film of his is one that’s quite obscure, The Magic Christian, which is normally mentioned as “other disappointments”. But what other film has both Michael Aspel and Roman Polanski in it? The thing about Sellers is that he made more bad films than any other major star. You can look at his career in simplistic terms as being before the heart attack and after. He had the good fortune to be living half an hour from the planet’s best heart hospital in Los Angeles, otherwise we would have been talking about him in the same breath as someone like James Dean. Graham Stark, who knew Sellers longer than most people, said that after the heart attack, he became a completely different person. The string of films he made in Britain have all got merit, but things got awkward after he went to Hollywood. In the UK, he was a big fish in a small pond, and he could bend people to his will, but he couldn’t do that in Hollywood. One of the reasons he never won an Oscar was that he just really upset people in the US. He was nominated for Dr Strangelove but he lost to Rex Harrison in My Fair Lady; what a kick in the teeth that must have been. He’d made so many enemies in Hollywood at that point. He wasn’t kissing anybody’s arse. In the past three years, I’ve been watching his films in sequence, and Being There comes as like a great beacon of joy towards the end of a miserable run of movies. It shows that he hadn’t lost his talent, he had just been in so many awful films. On Being There, he didn’t have any arguments with anybody, he admired the director, Hal Ashby, there were no tantrums. It was clearly a film that he wanted to do and that one still stands up, particularly in the age of Trump, where somebody can be misunderstood as a potential presidential candidate. ‘He could be eccentric, unpredictable and maddening’ Dick Clement My generation viewed listening to The Goon Show as a holy ritual. In school we imitated all the voices. Our parents could not understand our obsession, a generational thing. I worked only once with Peter on a forgettable movie: The Prisoner of Zenda. He played two parts, but I think he got bored. Blake Edwards, who directed him in The Pink Panther said that it was vital to capture him at the right moment, rather like the “magic hour” that film crews call dawn or dusk. On location in Vienna, Ian la Frenais and I quickly discovered that he was nostalgic about the old days. The Goons of course, but he liked to delve even further back to his time on the music hall circuit, long before fame. He thought ventriloquists, “vents” for short, were especially crazy. One called Jimmy Tattersall used several dummies in his act, and the climax involved a life-sized old lady operated by remote control, who appeared from the wings while he was singing My Old Dutch. On numerous occasions the old lady malfunctioned, took a savage left turn and ended in the orchestra pit. Peter loved that story. He could be eccentric, unpredictable and maddening, but there was never any doubt of his extraordinary talent. ‘He was like a musician nailing every beat’ Stephen Wight Peter Sellers was a chameleon, one I learned a lot about playing his role in the original stage production of The Ladykillers. These days we associate physical transformation with huge weight loss or gain. Getting ripped for a role so our performer can be an action hero. Sellers saw physical transformation beyond the “outer” and embodied his choices with wondrous results. Some were subtle, some were extreme, but always believable and real. In The Pink Panther Strikes Again there is this wonderful taut and uptight nature to Clouseau which creates a tension and fragility that provides such a glorious platform from the comedy to spring from or break into. The juxtaposition of his arrogant, savoir faire vocal performance paired with the chaotic and clownish physicality of character is amazing. His mastery of “playing it straight” yet just on the edge of complete absurdism is nothing short of genius. The scene in which he arrives at the house to interrogate the staff is theatrical farce at its best captured on film. Sellers is like a dancer waltzing between characters and objects, like a musician nailing every beat and flowing with the rhythm of it all. The scene crackles with a sense of everyone on the verge of corpsing. He was funny as hell and made it look effortless. Sellers achieved something every actor strives for but thinks probably doesn’t exist … perfection. • A Peter Sellers season runs at the BFI Southbank, London, from 2-30 August, and Two Way Stretch and Heavens Above are released on 4 August on Blu-ray
