  It is probably best not to ask too many questions. I mean, you could imagine
  Lou Doyle and Trevor White wanted their show to be about achieving the
  impossible and alighted on the phrase “pigs might fly” to encapsulate their
  vision. That would explain a scenario in which two animals leave their pigsty,
  disguise themselves as human beings, get past the check-in desks and gain
  employment as part of the cabin crew on a budget airline. These pigs really do
  fly. But that would be to seek a rationale for a show that does everything it
  can to defy logic. The pair may equally be the “flamin’ hot crash fetishists”
  described in the fringe programme. They certainly have a perverse interest in
  high-altitude accidents and emergency landings, even if they also have snouts
  and tails. No, it is more fruitful to take Pigs Fly Easy Ryan as you find it:
  messy, exuberant and daft, complete with cabaret aesthetics, shoogly
  acrobatics and feverish monologues, not to mention cross-dressing and
  undressing. Directed by Kendra A Miller for Nonstop, Pigs Fly Easy Ryan is
  staged with such devil-may-care gusto it gives you neither time nor
  inclination to figure out the method in their madness. There is a bit of a
  theme bubbling up between the in-flight announcements: something about the
  irresponsibility of flying during a climate emergency and the obscenity of
  waste generated in the name of affordable luxury. The show is the theatrical
  equivalent of a plastic waste dump, a place where the world’s excesses wash
  up, noisily and disordered, powering a manic, apocalyptic physical comedy.
  Hard to say whether they are angered or turned on by the evils of trash
  culture but, as they take joyful dives down the blow-up evacuation slide in
  this 2025 Untapped award winner, it is easy to enjoy the bumps and jolts of
  their turbulent flight. At the Underbelly Cowgate, Edinburgh, until 24 August
