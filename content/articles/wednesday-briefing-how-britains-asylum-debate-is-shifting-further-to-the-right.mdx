  Good morning. The late Ambalavaner Sivanandan, a leading voice in Britain’s
  anti-racist struggle, remarked: “What Enoch Powell says today, the
  Conservative party says tomorrow, and the Labour party legislates on the day
  after.” It has been 50 years since Sivanandan made that observation, yet his
  point – that far-right rhetoric can creep into the mainstream and harden into
  government policy – feels as relevant now as ever before. All eyes were on
  Nigel Farage, leader of Reform, at a press conference yesterday morning as he
  launched “Operation Restoring Justice”: a five-year plan to detain and deport
  hundreds of thousands of undocumented migrants. This radical proposal, which
  would shred the postwar consensus on universal human rights, is pitched as a
  deterrent to people seeking asylum in the UK. Farage stood alongside former
  party chair Zia Yusuf as they pledged to deport up to 600,000 people during
  the lifetime of a first Reform parliament. My first instinct as a journalist
  was to ask whether such a plan would even work, but this conference represents
  something much bigger than that. The real question is how much this rhetoric
  shifts the Overton window on the right to seek asylum in the UK, and whether
  we are heading towards a two-tier system of human rights. One for us, and
  another for those we choose to call outsiders. To better understand this
  extraordinary moment in British politics, I spoke to the Guardian political
  correspondent Aletha Adu, who attended the Reform conference. That’s after the
  headlines. Five big stories Gaza | The UN has demanded that Israel’s
  investigations into unlawful killings in Gaza yield results and ensure
  accountability. US news | Donald Trump imposed 50% tariffs on most US imports
  from India, making good on a threat to punish one of the world’s largest
  economies over its purchases of discounted Russian oil UK news | This summer
  is set to be the warmest on record for the UK, the Met Office has said, after
  the country experienced four heatwaves. France | One of France’s most popular
  actors, Dany Boon, will have a starring role in court when a fake Irish
  aristocrat goes on trial accused of cheating him out of millions of euros. Art

  in Amsterdam, a portrait by an Italian master has been spotted on the website
  of an estate agent advertising a house for sale in Argentina. In depth: Us v
  Them Nigel Farage did not hold back, setting out a maximalist and radical
  vision at yesterday’s event at London Oxford airport. Warning of a “genuine
  threat to public order” without action on illegal migration, he vowed to: •
  Take Britain out of the European convention on human rights, the 1951 refugee
  convention, the UN convention against torture, and the Council of Europe
  anti-trafficking convention. • Detain undocumented migrants indefinitely in
  camps, with new accommodation for 24,000 people built on “surplus” military
  bases. • Deport people to countries including Afghanistan and Eritrea, even
  where they risk torture or death – with the party pledging to pay regimes,
  including the Taliban in Afghanistan, to take them back. • Detain and deport
  women and children alongside men. • Impose a lifetime ban on re-entry for
  anyone deported, and criminalise re-entry after deportation or the deliberate
  destruction of identity documents, carrying a sentence of up to five years in
  prison. “I haven’t seen anything like this,” Aletha Adu tells me straight off
  the back of attending the press conference. Despite the wide-ranging plan,
  with huge national and international implications, journalists like Aletha
  were only given a four-page document. “There’s little to no detail at all. It
  was chaos. There were lots of cheers to him for deflecting questions around
  whether he would sleep at night after sending people back to countries where
  they could be tortured or persecuted.” Supporters remained silent when Farage
  was not able to answer the simplest of questions, such as what military bases
  he would use, she adds. But coming up short on the detail has never been an
  obstacle for Farage. “He is able to force the biggest party to react to his
  framing. And that is forcing a lot of the public to also have a bigger rethink
  on their views on British politics,” Aletha said. *** Dominating the agenda
  Summer recess is normally a time for MPs of all parties to rest and recharge,
  before returning to the brutal business of politics in the autumn. But Farage
  has taken a notably different approach. He kicked off the summer going on tour
  decrying “lawless” Britain and launching his campaign to get a grip on crime;
  by promising to spend £17bn on new prisons built on military bases, 30,000
  more police officers a year, and to rent cells for notorious murderers and
  others in El Salvador. He bridged crime and migration by insisting the two are
  intrinsically linked. Flanked by Reform’s senior female figures, Sarah Pochin,
  the MP for Runcorn, and Andrea Jenkyns, the mayor of Greater Lincolnshire, he
  argued that migrants from countries with “medieval” views on women pose a
  danger to women and girls in Britain. The debate was further inflamed by
  reports that an asylum seeker allegedly assaulted a teenage girl in Essex,
  sparking protests outside the hotel where he was housed and at sites elsewhere
  in the country. At every point this summer, Farage and Reform were on the
  front foot, while the government was left defending the policy of housing
  asylum seekers in hotels, a system largely inherited from the Conservatives.
  “Reform have been using a lot of rallies and media appearances to frame Keir
  Starmer’s government as mishandling the ‘small boats crisis’. They have been
  saying Labour have lost control of the borders. They have been using this time
  during recess to position themselves as the hard line alternative to both the
  Tories and Labour,” Aletha said. “It’s definitely piled the pressure on the
  Labour government to sharpen their own messaging and we saw that on Tuesday’s
  front pages,” which splashed the announcement that the UK government was
  preparing to send 100 small boat migrants back to France. If you look back at
  Britain’s chequered history with asylum seekers, sitting governments have
  often reacted to the threat of the populist right. In the early 2000s, Tony
  Blair’s government introduced a crackdown that hoped to challenge rising
  support for far-right parties across Europe. In 2002, his government removed
  asylum seekers’ right to work and pledged to halve the number of claims. When
  those policies left people destitute, a then up-and-coming human rights
  barrister challenged the new rules in court in 2003, describing them as
  “inhumane”. His name? Keir Starmer. *** A challenge to human rights Many of
  our most fundamental human rights, among them the right to be recognised as a
  person before the law, freedom from torture, and protection against arbitrary
  arrest, detention or exile, were established in the aftermath of the second
  world war. Their universality was historic: they applied to everyone,
  regardless of background. Reform now vows to take a sledgehammer to those laws
  and conventions. Farage’s plan to deport hundreds of thousands of asylum
  seekers, including women and children, and to withdraw the UK from human
  rights frameworks has, unsurprisingly, provoked a torrent of condemnation.
  Kolbassia Haoussou, director of survivor leadership at Freedom from Torture,
  described the plan as “a gift to repressive regimes” and warned Britain would
  be abandoning one of humanity’s “clearest moral lines”. “This is not who we
  are as a country,” he said. The Liberal Democrats and the Greens have also
  criticised the plan on ethical grounds. The Liberal Democrats’ deputy leader
  Daisy Cooper condemned Reform’s mass deportation plan for “ripping up” human
  rights and involving potential payments to autocratic regimes. The Green party
  MP Ellie Chowns denounced Farage’s “inflammatory” rhetoric as designed to whip
  up public anger and said the proposals were “unworkable”. *** Ball is in
  Labour’s court Parliament is set to return within the next few weeks and
  Labour will do so in an uncomfortable position. It has to respond to the
  agenda that Reform has set. “The prime minister’s spokesperson did not rule
  out paying the Taliban to take back asylum seekers. This scary rhetoric shows
  this is a government under pressure to prove to [certain] voters… that they
  can also be tough when it comes to dealing with asylum seekers and dealing
  with this ‘small boat crisis’,” Aletha said. She adds that Reform’s aim is for
  Keir Starmer to return after summer recess feeling as though he has lost the
  country, despite only being one year in power. “Labour are not setting the
  tone at the moment, they are being pushed and pulled in all sorts of
  directions and it’s not really feasible when you are actually in charge.
  You’re supposed to be leading the agenda, not necessarily reacting to it.” Is
  there any chance that Labour will return this autumn making the case for
  immigration? Aletha suggests that is extremely unlikely. “I have asked them
  previously about opening more safe routes to make sure people don’t need to
  make this horrible crossing to get to this country and it’s completely off the
  table. They said, ‘we have enough safe routes’.” She adds it also does not
  seem possible “given the level of anger coming from people politically aligned
  on the hard right”. It is particularly striking that for some voters, even the
  extreme policy that Reform is advocating may not be enough. “I spoke to a
  Reform insider at the press conference who told me, ‘Even I’m scared about
  interacting with some of our supporters. They’re always angry. Nothing we say
  is good enough.’” I suspect No 10 will be watching closely to see how Farage’s
  plan lands with the public. It comes on the heels of a striking poll showing
  that 45% of respondents support halting all immigration and deporting those
  who have arrived in recent years. The danger for Labour is clear: Farage might
  shift the country even further to the right. The danger for the rest of us is
  that even Reform may not be able to handle the demands and response their
  rhetoric goes on to spark. What else we’ve been reading Notting Hill carnival
  is celebrated for its big sound systems and colourful parades. I loved this
  intimate photo essay capturing some of the quieter moments. Phoebe This story
  of how students and a leftwing activist built a workers’ cooperative in Hull
  that grew into a multimillion-pound charitable social enterprise is
  fascinating. Aamna This is a troubling insight into the work of the Revenge
  Porn Helpline where desperate callers are reassured by the amazing people who
  pick up these calls. Phoebe I was moved by Hurricane Katrina survivors’
  reflection on the storm 20 years on, against a backdrop of severe cuts to
  disaster relief under the Trump administration. Aamna Last week was the
  feature about how public toilets disappeared and now this week it’s the night
  clubs. Staggeringly one in four have gone since 2020, leaving young people
  with nowhere to go. Phoebe Sport Cycling | Britain’s Ben Turner outfoxed
  Belgian Jasper Philipsen in a sprint finish to win stage four of the Vuelta a
  España, with Frenchman David Gaudu taking the leader’s red jersey from Jonas
  Vingegaard. Football | Kobbie Mainoo wants to leave Manchester United after
  being squeezed to the margins by Ruben Amorim. The midfielder has not played a
  minute of the team’s two games this season. Formula One | Sergio Pérez and
  Valtteri Bottas will be back on the Formula One starting grid next season
  after Cadillac announced the signing of the veteran drivers as the team’s
  debut pairing. The front pages Lead story in the Guardian is “Farage accused
  of ‘ugly’ populism over plans for mass deportations”. The Express has “Farage:
  ‘I will deport 600,000 illegal migrants’”. “Finally, a politician who gets it”
  – that’s the Mail while the Telegraph’s headline should be allowed to sink in:
  “Taliban to give Farage deal on migrants”. More on that in the i paper:
  “Farage’s promise to ‘deport ‘600,000’ migrants involves deals with Taliban
  and Iran’s Ayatollah”. “Farage: end the scourge” is the Metro’s version. The
  Mirror pushes back with “Britain is better than this”. The Times throwing it
  back on the government makes for a strangely understated headline: “Labour bid
  to head off small boats hits trouble”. Splash in the Financial Times is “US
  offers air and command back-up for Ukraine force”. Today in Focus Missing in
  the Amazon: the protector and the poacher – episode three Revisited: Bruno
  Pereira was considered one of the great Indigenous protectors of his
  generation. And this made him an enemy of a man called Amarildo da Costa de
  Oliveira, also known as Pelado. The Guardian’s Latin America correspondent,
  Tom Phillips, reports on the story of the two men and what happened when their
  paths collided Cartoon of the day | Ella Baron The Upside A bit of good news
  to remind you that the world’s not all bad In 2020 the Japanese-owned ship MV
  Wakashio ran aground off the coast of Mauritius spewing oil into pristine
  waters. It was the biggest ecological disaster to hit the island, ruining the
  local fishing industry that people had depended on for generations. Realising
  the extent of the damage, a group of women decided they would have to learn to
  farm the land in order to feed their families. They were soon training in
  agro-ecology, permaculture and beekeeping. This year they have grown a tonne
  of organic fruit and vegetables. Not only are they able to feed their loved
  ones but they are selling the surplus to support their families, many of whom
  are still struggling financially. “I’ve found something that keeps me going,
  and every day we’re getting food to take home,” says Marie Claire Robinson.
