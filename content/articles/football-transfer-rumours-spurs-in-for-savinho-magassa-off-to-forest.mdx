  It’s been at least 13 minutes since Chelsea bought a player they don’t need
  and withdrawal symptoms are biting hard. As such, they’ve begun talks with RB
  Leipzig, the idea being to swap Christopher Nkunku and cash for Xavi Simons.
  Though presumably the deal wouldn’t actually be a swap, rather 793 separate
  deals payable over 32,321 years with the players valued at knockdown prices of
  £9,065m and £19,324m, respectively. Nor will that be it. No squad is complete
  without someone who scores few and creates fewer, so Enzo Maresca is also keen
  to add Alejandro Garnacho to his squad. Leipzig, meanwhile, would like to
  acquire Harvey Elliott from Liverpool, who reportedly rejected a move to
  Nottingham Forest as he does not think they suit his playing style – they
  must’ve expected him to start rather than hang about as sub. Rather, he is
  said to favour a move to Serie A instead: the golden era of Harvelissimo may
  be just a few short weeks away. Chelsea are, though, also looking to sell –
  most particularly Nicolas Jackson. Newcastle, having been rejected by Benjamin
  Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Hugo Ekitike, Ian Ormondroyd, Liam Delap, Ian Olney, João
  Pedro, Bill Brewer, Jan Stewer, Peter Gurney and Peter Davey, seem most
  interested in the striker who can not strike; the player seemingly prefers
  Alloa Athletic, San Marino Academy and Wormwood Scrubs Reserves. But if all
  else fails and given how much the Gallowgate loves a No 9, the romantic thrill
  of following Hughie Gallagher, Wor Jackie, Supermac, Coley, Sir Les and Alan
  Shearer means he’ll instead accept whatever he can find that isn’t that, but
  if that’s all he can find, then that’s what he’ll do. Similarly, Randal Kolo
  Muani, another centre-forward target, would rather join Juventus, where he
  spent the second half of last season on loan, while Liverpool are keeping an
  eye on Yoane Wissa, whom they might take should they fail to relieve Newcastle
  of Alexander Isak. Quite why and how all these players have failed to be
  dazzled by Eddie Howe remains a mystery, but here we are. In other striker
  news, Ruben Amorim has packed Rasmus Højlund’s bags, put his house on the
  market and booked him a one-way to ticket Anywhere But Here; Højlund retains
  every confidence he will soon be Manchester United’s first choice. However,
  should his manager remain unseduced by his preference for wrestling defenders
  to scoring goals, Milan are interested; they’d like a loan with an option to
  buy, whereas United just want shot of the shot-shy. They are, though,
  considering taking Dominic Calvert-Lewin on a free transfer. The
  out-of-contract player has reportedly dismissed his agent to negotiate his own
  deal, which makes sense if you consider how much spare time he has, while 13
  seconds of persistence appears to have worn down Jack Grealish – he’s agreed
  to join Everton on loan from Manchester City, who are also trying to shift
  Savinho to Spurs. Otherwise, Régis Le Bris appears to be the only person in
  England who has heard of Lloyd Kelly. He fancies bringing the 26-year-old
  defender – who recently joined Juventus on a loan-with-an-obligation-to-buy
  deal from Newcastle – to Sunderland, should the clubs be able to strike a
  deal. And finally for today to Nottingham, where Forest have made an offer for
  Monaco midfielder Soungoutou Magassa; they also hold an interest in Kostas
  Tsimikas, left out of Liverpool’s Community Shield squad. The absence of
  Harvelissimo is a factor not believed to be a factor operative in their
  decision-making process.
