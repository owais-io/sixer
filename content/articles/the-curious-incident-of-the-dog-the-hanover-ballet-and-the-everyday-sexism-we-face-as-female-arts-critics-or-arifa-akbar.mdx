  Remember the international outrage over a lurid incident involving a female
  dance critic, a male choreographer and a deposit of his pet dachshund’s
  excrement? In February 2023 the German choreographer Marco Goecke cornered
  Wiebke Hüster in the foyer of the Hanover State Opera during the interval of a
  show. Goecke, who was then artistic director of the venue, brought out a bag
  of dog poo from his pocket and pushed it into the journalist’s face. The
  reason? Hüster had written a negative review of his Netherlands-based show, In
  the Dutch Mountains, which had appeared in the newspaper Frankfurter
  Allgemeine Zeitung (Faz) on the night of his hundekot attack. The incident
  sparked column inches of conversation in Germany on critical culture, with a
  ripple effect further afield: in the Netherlands, theatre critics condemned it
  as an act of violence against freedom of expression; in the US, the American
  Theatre Critics Association did the same, with a blaze of accompanying
  newspaper headlines across Europe. Goecke lost his job and became a
  professional persona non grata. Good, I thought, as a critic who has been
  approached by some angry men myself in theatre auditoriums, though never with
  this level of repellently visceral aggression. The reaction was indubitable
  proof of the culture industry’s zero tolerance towards assault in Germany,
  right? Especially in a case involving a man attacking a woman in this publicly
  shaming way. Wrong. In May 2024, Goecke was appointed ballet director at
  Theater Basel for the upcoming 2025-26 season. He had remained in the doghouse
  for just over a year despite all the hand-wringing in Germany. What does this
  say about the position of critics in general, and female reviewers in
  particular, given the misogynistic undertones in Goecke’s act, which seemed
  like a calculated aim to humiliate and degrade? Reflecting on the episode in a
  new BBC Radio 4 documentary about the state of culture criticism in our
  fast-changing world of AI, algorithms and influencer-critics, Hüster spoke to
  me about her lack of surprise at Goecke’s rehabilitation. She had always
  assumed he would find work again. From a highly experienced critic who has
  been on the scene for several decades, what does that say about gender
  dynamics in the arts? Shockingly, in the moments after the attack she felt
  grateful it had not been worse, despite her sense of violation. “I thought:
  ‘It’s bad – but it’s not a knife in your ribs,’” she said, and went on to
  describe the hate burning off her attacker, as if he bore an “absolute sincere
  wish to do me real harm”. Hüster’s vocabulary couldn’t sound more gendered,
  with Goecke’s behaviour akin to that of a stalker, not an artistic director.
  She herself puts the intensity of his reaction partly down to the fact that
  she was a woman doing a critical takedown – in one of Europe’s most
  influential papers. But in Germany she is far from the only female critic in
  the field. A Berlin theatre critic tells me there are far more female culture
  reviewers now than was previously the case. Hüster has seen this change too.
  The trend appears the same for UK criticism. And yet I fear that the optics of
  gender parity – or at least progress – are deceptive when set against the
  cold, hard facts. A survey conducted in 2019 by the five-year Women in Theatre
  research project, whose partners include the Writers’ Guild, WOW (Women of the
  World) and Equity, among others, found that only 10% of the reviewing corps
  for drama were female. Subsequent reports in 2021 and 2023 corroborated this
  finding. This figure surprises and dismays me. It goes against the
  often-assumed pace of progress. So much so that Arts Council England’s
  national council governing body has just approved a year-long taskforce to
  investigate the underrepresentation of and discrimination against women in the
  arts as a result of the Women in Theatre research project. Are we going
  backwards? Putting Hüster’s appalling experience aside, you could argue that
  the clashes between artists and critics nowadays are not half as fractious as
  they were a few decades ago, when criticism really was a macho sport with
  full-out eruptions of physical violence. This newspaper’s Michael Billington
  was at the receiving end of a blow himself. That this no longer happens is a
  sign of progress, isn’t it? Well, it’s about optics again, because the punches
  are now thrown on social media, and so often, as findings reveal time and
  again, women are subjected to more vociferous attacks and pile-ons than their
  male counterparts. There were murmurs from some corners that Hüster’s review
  was unnecessarily harsh. I wonder if this judgment was cast because female
  critics are held to a different standard, however unconsciously – and whether
  we are expected to be less combative, more balanced? Hüster concedes that her
  review came with colourful language and humour. So what? It is just this kind
  of combative spirit that was espoused by William Blake in his idea that
  “opposition is true friendship”, that is, learning that occurs in the rich
  tension sparked between opposite viewpoints. Hüster also spoke to me of
  adhering to her own boundaries, never venturing into commentary that was
  personal or related to appearance. I hope male writers or directors have their
  boundaries too, especially if they approach a female critic to contest a
  review in person. I have had this several times, and have felt threatened by
  it. It’s a lonely job, as Hüster pointed out to me (and all the more so for
  the 10% of UK-based theatre critics who are female), but it really shouldn’t
  be a dangerous one. Where does all of this leave the female critic? Where
  Hüster is, I suppose. Whatever the implications of Goecke’s comeback, it is
  business as usual for her. “I have not changed because of that incident,” she
  said. “No, that would be awful.” Indeed. Arifa Akbar is the Guardian’s chief
  theatre critic. She presents No Criticism, a two-part documentary broadcast on
  BBC Radio 4, on 12 and 19 August Do you have an opinion on the issues raised
