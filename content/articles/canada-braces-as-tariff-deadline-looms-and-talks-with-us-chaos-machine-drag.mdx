  After months of tariff threats from the US and escalating trade tensions that
  have sowed anger in Canada and fractured a once-close alliance, the country is
  now fast approaching a 1 August deadline to reach a deal with the Trump
  administration – which has shown no signs of backing down. And observers are
  keeping a close eye on negotiations this week to determine whether too large a
  chasm has grown between the countries, resulting in what could be an explosive
  end to what was decades of free-flowing trade. Canada is also in a highly
  vulnerable position, as it has closely intertwined its economy with the US’s,
  and is extremely reliant on a low-barrier trade environment, said William
  Huggins, an assistant professor in economics at McMaster University in
  Ontario. “Canada has tried to negotiate sort of forcefully from a position of
  not acquiescing to every demand, but by the same token, has also realised it’s
  not in the strongest position to do so … We’ve had to navigate carefully,”
  said Huggins. The Canadian public is also anxiously awaiting the deadline to
  strike up a deal. Economists and political scientists say the country’s prime
  minister, Mark Carney, was elected on the belief that he’s the right person to
  be at the helm of negotiations and lead Canada through a tenuous period with
  their southern neighbour. His successes or failures in this arena could affect
  public perception – as he has characterised his government as being the most
  adept in the crisis around its sovereignty due to the tariffs and Donald
  Trump’s persistent claims that he’d like to make Canada the 51st state.
  “[Carney] is in a situation where he doesn’t hold all the cards and whoever we
  put in was going to have to figure out a way through this … [His] ability to
  plan is severely limited by the chaos machine that is operating south of the
  border,” said Dennis Pilon, the chair of the politics department at York
  University in Ontario. On Monday, Carney said at a news conference on Prince
  Edward Island that the trade negotiations are at an “intense pace” and that
  they are “complex”. But he projected tentative optimism, stating that the
  negotiations are “tough” because the government is standing up for Canadian
  interests. “There is a landing zone that’s possible but we have to get there.
  We’ll see what happens,” he told reporters. But Trump spoke of the
  negotiations flippantly when asked by reporters outside the White House last
  Friday. “We haven’t really had a lot of luck with Canada … Canada could be one
  where there’s just a tariff, not really a negotiation,” he said. So far, much
  of the talks have happened behind closed doors. There was a glimpse into what
  could be the dynamic between Carney and Trump when the prime minister had his
  first meeting with the president in the Oval Office in early May. There were
  positive tones in both initially offering praise for each other, but the
  encounter quickly grew tense as Trump repeated his annexation claims, which
  were subsequently rebuffed by Carney. Since March, Trump has imposed several
  tariffs on Canadian goods and energy resources. There is a 25% tariff on all
  goods, excluding potash and energy products. But there’s separately a 10%
  tariff on energy resources, including potash. Additionally, there’s a further
  50% tariff on steel and aluminum imports and a 25% tariff on autos and auto
  parts. At this stage, the tariffs have seemingly not delivered a significant
  blow to Canada’s economy, but that could change quickly. The Royal Bank of
  Canada noted in its June forecast that nearly 90% of Canadian goods are exempt
  from tariffs under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the free
  trade deal that replaced Nafta in 2020 and which provides a degree of
  insulation. In an assessment published by the Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) on
  Tuesday, it reported that energy exports have not been significantly affected
  by the tariffs, as most exports are compliant under the USMCA, and are
  therefore exempt from tariffs. Some of the insulation so far from tariffs
  could be from opening Canada up to other markets. TD said that in the past
  four months, Canadian businesses rapidly moved to reorient supply chains and
  export to non-US markets. Now about 30% of exports go outside the US – a level
  not seen since the pandemic, when TD notes there was disorientation in trade.
  But TD also warned that the negative effects of the tariffs might be beginning
  to emerge. It said that Canadian exports to the US are “generally
  underperforming” in tariff-targeted industries, particularly steel and
  automaking. Canada’s auto exports fell to levels not seen since late 2022,
  following the April imposition of tariffs. Automakers have also “slashed”
  production in response, it said. Andrea Lawlor, an associate professor of
  political science at McMaster University, said that while there haven’t been
  many layoffs or a complete reorientation of production lines yet, industries
  targeted by tariffs are preparing to do so. Lawlor also said that Carney has
  been prudent in his negotiation strategy so far, and right in waiting for
  deals to be brokered between the US and other nations, as they were this month
  with Japan and the EU, to help inform Canada’s strategy. And despite concerns
  about marred relationships with First Nations people, pushing forward
  controversial infrastructure legislation and his quick scrapping of Canada’s
  digital services tax – which many, including top former diplomats, viewed as
  fawning capitulation toward Trump – the prime minister is still enjoying
  fairly positive polling in his term’s infancy. Abacus Data reported at the end
  of June that 52% of Canadians surveyed approve of the Carney government. The
  research firm states it shows that his post-election honeymoon period is “far
  from over”. Lawlor said the best outcome for Carney in the negotiations is a
  favourable trade deal – however, there has been signalling from Carney, in his
  discussion of “tough” talks so far, that Canadians may have to accept a
  baseline of tariffs. “Many Canadians just simply will not be satisfied if that
  is the outcome,” she said. But due to Carney facing limited criticism of his
  interactions with the Americans so far, Lawlor said she believes the prime
  minister will not face extreme negative blowback if he doesn’t trounce tariffs
  for good this week. But he will be more vulnerable if the tariffs start to
  place downward pressure on multiple industries, she said. As Canadians are
  waiting and watching for the Friday deal deadline, the real fears are around
  the cementing of a new world order and whether long-term business and consumer
  decisions need to be made in response, said Preetika Joshi, an assistant
  professor at McGill University in Quebec that specialises in taxation. “If you
  were a business owner and you knew Trump is going to be in power for only
  three, four years, would you necessarily make big, significant changes in your
  supply chain … or would you just wait it out?” she said. But given some grim
  messaging from those close to Carney – Canadians might be facing tough
  decisions. Dominic LeBlanc, the federal minister responsible for Canada-US
  trade, said last week there’s a lot of work ahead of them and minimised the 1
  August deadline. “We’re going to continue to work toward the 1 August
  deadline,” said LeBlanc to reporters in Washington. “But all of these
  deadlines are with the understanding that we’ll take the time necessary to get
  the best deal,” he said. Deal or no deal, the negotiations might reveal that
  there isn’t a best-case scenario, said Joshi. “What we were used to before
  Trump, where there were very little tariffs, that reality is slightly over,”
  she said. “We’ll have to wait and see … but the reality is that there are
  going to be some tariffs.”
