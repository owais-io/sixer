  gun to threaten film studio

  Oscar-winning film director Martin Scorsese threatened to buy a gun when in a
  rage at a film studio, according to a new docuseries about his life. After
  suggested edits to his 1976 movie Taxi Driver, which starred Robert De Niro,
  he flew into such a fury that he began threatening to take the law into his
  own hands. “Marty was very upset,” says Steven Spielberg. “We get a call at
  the office: ‘Steve, Steve, it’s Marty. Can you come over to the house? They
  want me to cut all the blood spurting, they want me to cut the guy who loses
  his hand.’” “He was going crazy,” adds fellow director Brian De Palma. “I
  mean, the story is he wanted to kill the head of the studio.” Scorsese himself
  claims that his plans were slightly less extreme, even if he did claim at the
  time that he had every intention of buying a weapon. “I don’t know. I was
  angry. I said I was going to threaten them, or maybe just shoot or something.
  I had no idea,” he says. Instead, the director’s actual plan involved a
  different sort of crime. “What I wanted to do – and not with a gun – I would
  go in, find out where the rough cut is and break the windows and take it
  back,” he explains. “They’re going to destroy the film anyway, so let me
  destroy it. I’ll destroy it. But before destroying it, I’m going to steal it.
  “Spielberg said: ‘Marty stop that! Marty, you can’t do it!’ And the more they
  said no, the more I said I was going to do it.” The scenes come from an Apple
  TV+ documentary series, Mr Scorsese, which looks at the director’s life and
  work drawing on access to his private archives. It features interviews with
  family, friends and colleagues including De Niro, Daniel Day-Lewis, Sharon
  Stone, Margot Robbie and Mick Jagger. It was not the first time that the
  director uttered violent threats during the production of Taxi Driver. He also
  infamously appeared in the movie as a passenger who planned to murder his wife
  after discovering her infidelity, performing a calm monologue strewn with
  racist language and threats of gun-related violence. Ultimately, a compromise
  to the editing crisis was struck, meaning that Taxi Driver was able to retain
  controversial blood-soaked scenes. In the words of Spielberg: “It saved the
  movie because he didn’t have to cut any of the violence. He just had to take
  the colour red down to a colour brown.”
