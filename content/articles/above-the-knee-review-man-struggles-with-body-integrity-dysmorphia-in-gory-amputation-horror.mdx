  Above the Knee review – man struggles with body integrity dysmorphia in gory
  amputation horror

  Norwegian director Viljar Bøe has been hacking out an interesting niche for
  himself in the horror genre, specialising in a variety grounded more in
  psychology than supernatural jiggery pokery. For example, Good Boy from 2022
  revolved around a man and his “dog” (who is obviously a guy in a dog costume)
  acting like a mutt at all times. Similarly, his new feature features a
  character called Amir (Freddy Singh) with a psychological fixation that’s so
  unusual he feels he must keep it a secret from his girlfriend and all
  acquaintances: he has body integrity dysphoria (BID), which in his case means
  he has an overwhelming desire to amputate his left leg even though there’s
  nothing physically wrong with it. Amir lives with his super-nice, cheerful
  girlfriend Kim (Julie Abrahamsen) in hyper-tolerant, Scandi-socialist
  quasi-utopia Norway, so when he drunkenly tries to self-amputate, everyone
  just assumes it was a suicide attempt and showers him with understanding and
  support. His old friend Jonas (Viggo Solomon) even offers him an office job,
  but Amir is so obsessed with his leg he constantly haunts the chainsaw aisle
  at his local DIY shop. After seeing an interview on TV with Rikke (Louise
  Waage Anda), a young woman who is open about her own BID (she wants to be
  blind), Amir seeks her out for advice. Soon, the two of them are having a sort
  of platonic affair, with Amir storing his cache of paintings depicting himself
  as an amputee that he doesn’t dare let Kim see. In back and forward flashes we
  get quick glimpses of gore-smeared rocks and pools of blood, promising horror
  to come. Plus, Bøe keeps putting a day-by-day countdown on screen, auguring
  the approach of the moment when the “accident” will happen, so we know things
  will go stump-shaped in some way. But while the will-he-won’t-he mystery gets
  resolved, some viewers may be left wanting a little more explanation about why
  Amir feels this way about his body. It doesn’t help that Singh, while
  physically imposing and a co-creator of the film’s story, is a bit limited as
  an actor apart from the scenes where he performs pain or anger. Amir’s lumpish
  demeanour and utter self-absorption rather undermines sympathy for him and
  make one wonder why poor, good-natured Kim and Jonas put up with him in the
  first place. But this is still a film that lingers in the mind long after it
  is over – not just because of the gore but because of the subtler questions it
  raises about identity and community. • Above the Knee is on digital platforms
  from 9 September.
