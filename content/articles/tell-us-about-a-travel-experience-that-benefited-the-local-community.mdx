  When tourism genuinely involves local communities it’s a win for all parties –
  guests enjoy more authentic experiences while the livelihoods of those they
  are visiting are boosted. We’d love to hear about initiatives you’ve sampled
  that support grassroots projects and communities – perhaps it was through a
  homestay programme, a community-run pub or cafe, or an indigenous tour guide
  keen to provide an insight into local culture. Tell us about where you went
  and those involved. The best tip of the week, chosen by Tom Hall of Lonely
  Planet wins a £200 voucher to stay at a Coolstays property – the company has
  more than 3,000 worldwide. The best tips will appear in the Guardian Travel
  section and website. Keep your tip to about 100 words If you have a relevant
  photo, do send it in – but it’s your words we will be judging for the
  competition. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK resident to
  enter this competition. The competition closes on Monday 8 September at 10am
  GMT/BST Have a look at our past winners and other tips Read the terms and
  conditions here If you’re having trouble using the form click here. Read terms
