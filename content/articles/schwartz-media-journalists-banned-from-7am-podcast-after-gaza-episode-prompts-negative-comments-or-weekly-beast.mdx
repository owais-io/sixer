  Schwartz Media, publisher of the Saturday Paper, the Monthly and the Quarterly
  Essay, recently sold its 7am podcast to Solstice Media, with the promise its
  stable of journalists would still appear on the popular show. But just a month
  out from the deal, the Schwartz journalists have been told they can no longer
  talk on the podcast. The first episode published by the new owners was about
  Palestinians who were killed as they waited for aid, and a later Gaza-related
  episode interviewed the executive officer at the Jewish Council of Australia,
  Sarah Schwartz (no relation). All appeared well as Schwartz journalists
  continued to make appearances on the podcast in July. But some listener
  comments critical of Schwartz’s coverage of the Israel-Gaza war were posted on
  7am’s social media pages. Following the discovery of the public comments,
  writers were told by Schwartz they can no longer go on the podcast and talk
  about their reporting – a big loss to the podcast, which has always showcased
  the insights of the stable. Some of the posts Weekly Beast saw included: “So
  glad you’re moving away from them. Report on Palestine please”; “Night and
  fucking day” and “so glad you guys have gone independent and are now going to
  cover the genocide properly”. Schwartz Media’s chief executive and
  editor-in-chief, Erik Jensen, confirmed the direction to the writers and told
  Weekly Beast the decision had nothing to do with the journalism on 7am, “which
  continues to be excellent”. “It was made in response to offensive material
  that was left unmoderated on the show’s socials.” Solstice Media is rapidly
  expanding, this week buying up travel magazine Australian Traveller to add to
  its stable of South Australian and Queensland editions of InDaily, SA Life and
  the New Daily. Marks’ strategy underwhelms It will come as no surprise to
  anyone that the ABC’s purpose is to produce content across TV, radio and
  online. But each managing director delivers his or her own “new strategic
  direction”: this week was Hugh Marks’ turn. His big reveal? “We must be a
  content-led organisation.” Top of the agenda at an all-staff town hall was a
  set of “refreshed ABC values”, complete with colour-coded charts with four
  unique emojis: Aim High, Think Differently, Take Ownership and Deliver
  Together. “In living these values, we always demonstrate respect, honesty and
  a commitment to diversity and inclusion.” Some of the journalists in the room
  or on Zoom rolled their eyes at the corporate jargon; others were so
  bamboozled by the buzzwords, they tuned out. But to be fair to Marks, the
  presentation was far from former MD Michelle Guthrie’s Google style of
  management, which included a session in which attendees were asked to sit in a
  ring, select a plastic toy from the centre of the group that most represented
  how they felt and speak “through” it. There was some joy at Ultimo, however,
  and it was the recent success of Triple J’s Hottest 100 of Australian Songs, a
  journey through 50 years of Australian music. The event saw 3.13m live stream
  starts on Triple J and Double J on Saturday, in addition to those listening to
  the countdown on broadcast. There were over 50m views across Triple J’s
  TikTok, Instagram and YouTube channels and more than 1.3m reads of ABC
  articles. Marks was delighted. He said he lives in Paddington and he could
  hear the Hottest 100 parties as he walked around. He suggested TV should be
  involved next time. The audio chief, Ben Latimer, said the Hottest 100 was an
  “incredible example of what we do well” and signalled the ABC will do more
  projects like it in the future. But back to the ABC values. Marks said: “When
  we do make mistakes, let’s own them quickly” in what was interpreted as a nod
  to the disastrous decision to sack broadcaster Antoinette Lattouf. Later,
  during questions, Marks conceded management failed and processes were not
  followed in that case. The direction to aim for quality and “break more
  stories” irked reporters, who told Weekly Beast there isn’t a day they aren’t
  focused on that very task. Uhlmann takes on China threat Two years after the
  Nine newspapers published the controversial Red Alert series – in which an
  expert panel asserted Australia faced “the threat of war with China within
  three years” – Chris Uhlmann is presenting a Sky News program which appears to
  have a similar theme. The “exclusive one-hour special event” is called The War
  Cabinet and asks: is Australia ready for war? “Set in an immersive war cabinet
  environment, Uhlmann convenes a distinguished panel of former ministers,
  military leaders, and defence specialists to investigate if Australia is ready
  to defend itself and support our allies in a time of growing tensions in our
  region and across the world,” the blurb says. Former ministers Alexander
  Downer and Joel Fitzgibbon and the former secretary of the Department of Home
  Affairs Michael Pezzullo have been assembled to discuss, among other things,
  China’s increasing militarisation. Back in 2023, Paul Keating was so incensed
  by the Red Alert series he called it “the most egregious and provocative news
  presentation of any newspaper I have witnessed in over 50 years of active
  public life”. The former Nine and ABC political correspondent even has two
  alumni from the Red Alert series: the executive director of the Australian
  Strategic Policy Institute, Peter Jennings, and the retired major general Mick
  Ryan. AJN’s serious error The Australian Jewish News published a correction
  and apology on its social media pages this week after a news alert incorrectly
  named a reporter from The Australian in connection with an arson arrest.
  Instead of reporting the correct name of a man police had alleged was linked
  to the Adass Israel Synagogue arson, the AJN named young journalist Mohammad
  Alfares, who had written the report. “Earlier today, we published a breaking
  news alert on our social media channels about an arrest connected to the Adass
  Israel Synagogue arson,” AJN said. “In taking the information from an update
  from The Australian’s website, we made a grievous error in wrongly taking the
  name of The Australian’s journalist, Mohammad Alfares, and including it in the
  post as the arrested party. “The post was removed as soon as we realised our
  mistake. We sincerely regret this error and the upset that it has caused for
  Mr Alfares and The Australian.” ABC staff concerned over Gaza reporters We
  told you last week that ABC Middle East correspondent Matt Doran had warned
  that Palestinian journalists working with Australia’s national broadcaster
  barely had the strength to hold a camera due to starvation. His report came on
  the same day as a joint statement from BBC News, Reuters, AFP and AP which
  said “it is essential that adequate food supplies reach the people” in Gaza
  and urged Israeli authorities to allow journalists in and out of the region.
  At the aforementioned ABC town hall on Tuesday, the news director, Justin
  Stevens, was asked by journalists why the ABC didn’t join the other news
  organisations in making that statement. He replied the ABC wasn’t aware of it
  at the time but would be looking for opportunities to do so. Following the
  robust questioning at the meeting, a statement was issued by Stevens on
  Thursday that said the ABC is “deeply concerned” about the health and safety
  of stringers in Palestine. “We’re now seeing the effects of food shortages on
  journalists we work with, which our correspondents have reported on: The
  hunger crisis inside Gaza will affect the news you see about the war. “The ABC
  calls on Israel to again allow international journalists to report
  independently from Gaza, to allow all journalists to move in and out of Gaza
  and to ensure journalists in Gaza are safe.” Royal resident In May the
  Norwegian royal house announced Princess Ingrid Alexandra will move to
  Australia to study at the University of Sydney, where she will live on campus
  while studying for a bachelor of arts. The 21-year-old is second in line to
  Norway’s throne after her father, the crown prince and heir apparent. The
  Murdoch press wasted no time publishing paparazzi shots of her before the
  university semester had even begun. The Daily Telegraph framed Alexandra in an
  editorial as an anti-Meghan Markle figure, a “truly normal and relatable
  royal”. The shot of the princess carrying a bottle of wine made the front page
  on Friday with the headline “Heir to the throne of Norway kicks up her heels
  in Sydney”. At news.com.au, the angle was the same: her “tipple of choice was
  a $16 Italian prosecco”. “She rocked the classic Aussie winter uniform – a
  minimalist navy cardigan and low-waisted, white baggy jeans,” their piece
  said. “Her long brown hair was styled in an effortless middle part, and she
  classed up the look with a pair of gold hoop earrings.” Which was a better
  description than the one offered by the Daily Mail: “Her mousy blonde locks
  were tucked behind her ears and fell voluminously around her shoulders.”
