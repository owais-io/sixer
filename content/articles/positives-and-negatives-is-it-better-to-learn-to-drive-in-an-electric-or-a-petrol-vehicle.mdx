  Positives and negatives: is it better to learn to drive in an electric or a
  petrol vehicle?

  Not long ago, the choice was between manual and automatic. One, demanding
  mastery of gear stick, accelerator and clutch – greater control at the risk of
  stalling – the other offering a simpler ride. These days the debate has moved
  on. The majority of new cars are automatic and an increasing share are
  electric. New data from the Electric Vehicle Council shows sales of electric
  vehicles continue to climb in Australia, with 12% of new sales between January
  and June being battery electric or plug-in hybrids – up from 9.6% in the same
  period last year. As a new generation approaches their Ls and Ps, a new
  dilemma arises – is it better to learn in an electric or a petrol vehicle?
  What do the rules say about learning in an EV? There are now 350,000 electric
  cars on Australian roads, says the Electric Vehicle Council’s chief executive,
  Julie Delvecchio. Of those, about 43% are driven in outer suburban Sydney,
  Melbourne and Brisbane – often households with solar panels, off-street
  parking and longer commutes – and 18% in the regions, she says. “Given that
  the future of driving is electric, it just makes sense that we’d be teaching
  our kids on the cars that they’ll be actually using in the years ahead.” In
  most states, learners can drive any light car, so long as they are supervised
  by someone with a full Australian driver’s licence. Once on their probationary
  licence – in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia – young
  drivers are banned from getting behind the wheel of anything classed as a
  high-powered vehicle. The restriction applies to any vehicle with a
  power-to-weight ratio higher than 130 kilowatts per tonne, which rules out
  some popular electric models like Tesla’s Model Y, according to EV Central.
  When it comes to motorcycles, many states still require learners to start with
  a petrol vehicle, says Dr Chris Jones, president of the Australian Electric
  Vehicle Association. “If you’re going to learn how to ride a motorcycle and
  you want to get your open bike license – which means unrestricted
  power-to-weight – you do need to do that on a petrol bike with gears and a
  clutch. You can’t do that on an EV motorcycle,” he says. Can I sit my test in
  an EV? Students can take their test in an electric car, according to state and
  territory transport departments. However, restrictions on the use of driver
  support systems vary, so it’s worth checking the rules for your state or
  territory beforehand. For example, in NSW driver support features such as
  self-parking, speed assist and cruise control must be turned off during the
  driving test, while in Queensland they can still be used. Some jurisdictions
  require the car to have a centre-mounted park brake – electric or lever – to
  be accessible from the front passenger seat. What are the pros and cons? Tarik
  Menzies from No Yelling Driving School, who manages a fleet of driving
  instructors across Queensland and Victoria, says occasionally parents will
  request their child learns in a petrol car. For some it’s about manual
  transmission, he says, a feature rarely found in electric vehicles. “They
  think their child learning manual is a useful skill – like doing maths without
  the calculator.” Learning in a manual is increasingly uncommon, however.
  Transport for NSW data shows in 2024 the number of manual driving tests
  (28,392) was a tenth of the amount of automatic tests (289,426). Others are
  not yet ready for the change in technology, Menzies says – even though when it
  comes to automatic cars, there’s very little difference between learning in an
  electric versus a petrol car. Kathryn Collier, who manages METEC Driver
  Training, says there’s a couple of small differences for learners to be aware
  of. Electric cars often have better torque and can be quicker off the mark,
  she says. “Also be aware that your car may well be silent. So be extra
  vigilant in looking out for vulnerable road users like pedestrians and
  cyclists because they won’t hear you.” The road safety organisation, which
  provides school driver programs for more than 80 schools in Melbourne and
  Victoria, has a range of vehicles for students to learn in, including a Nissan
  Leaf, to give young people the experience of driving an electric vehicle. So
  which one is better to learn in? Parents switching to a shiny new electric car
  might be tempted to hold on to their older model for their teenagers to learn
  in. But Collier recommends young drivers learn in “the safest car you can
  afford”, ideally one with a five-star Ancap rating. “A lot of young people
  tend to get the hand-me-down vehicles from other members of the family,” she
  says. “We would argue that the most vulnerable driver should really be in the
  safest car possible.” Jones says the learning process is a good opportunity to
  share tips about the “non-driving bits” of driving an EV – how to use a public
  charger, charging etiquette and scheduling your home charging to make the most
  of cheap energy. “In our experience learner drivers (and drivers generally)
  adapt pretty quickly when it comes to EVs”, the Electric Vehicle Council’s
  Julie Delvecchio says. “Often, once they get in an EV … they never want to go
  back to petrol and diesel, because it’s so smooth, so quiet and easy to
  drive.” Regardless of what car they learn in, Menzies says learning to drive
  is an empowering experience for most young people. “We see the joy that it
  brings, as well as the disappointment when they fail.” “In our culture,
  getting your licence is somewhat of a rite of passage for the young person
  becoming a big person.”
