  Donald Trump has ruled out sending US troops to Ukraine to enforce a potential
  peace deal with Vladimir Putin, tempering a promise to provide Kyiv with
  security guarantees that European allies had called a significant breakthrough
  towards halting the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine. Asked during a phone
  interview with Fox News whether he could assure listeners – including many
  members of his Maga base who support an isolationist America-first foreign
  policy – that the US would not put troops on the ground in Ukraine, Trump
  said: “You have my assurance, and I’m president.” He did, however, say
  Washington may be willing to provide air support to Ukraine in order to
  backstop a deal, in what would still be a remarkable shift in his
  administration’s policy on the conflict. “There’ll be some form of security.
  It can’t be Nato,” he said, ruling out Ukraine’s admission to the
  transatlantic bloc. “They’re willing to put people on the ground. We’re
  willing to help them with things, especially, probably, if you could talk
  about by air.” The White House spokesperson, Karoline Leavitt, said Putin and
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy had both expressed “a willingness to sit down with each
  other”. She added: “I understand accommodations for that meeting are under
  way.” Bloomberg reported that Hungary has expressed interest in hosting such a
  meeting. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, had proposed Geneva, with the
  Swiss foreign minister promising “immunity” to Putin despite an indictment by
  the international criminal court. Russia has said it views the deployment of
  troops from Nato countries to Ukraine as a red line in negotiations. Trump
  dismissed that concern on Tuesday and said he was still optimistic about the
  potential to reach a deal with Putin. Nato’s secretary general, Mark Rutte,
  had described Trump’s pledge on Monday to provide security guarantees to
  ensure Russia would abide by a peace deal as a significant breakthrough, as
  Zelenskyy and European leaders convened at the White House for an
  extraordinary summit. In a press conference during the summit, Trump declined
  to say whether US troops could be deployed to Ukraine in what could provide a
  “tripwire” to prevent Russia from resuming the conflict in the future.
  European leaders held fresh talks on Tuesday after their White House meeting
  with Zelenskyy amid uncertainty over Putin’s readiness to meet the Ukrainian
  president. Sources close to the talks told Agence France-Presse that Putin had
  proposed meeting with Zelenskyy in Moscow, hostile territory for a Ukrainian
  president who has reportedly survived a number of Kremlin assassination plots.
  Zelenskyy was said to have declined the invitation. It is unclear if or when
  the two leaders will meet. Putin is scheduled to attend a Shanghai Cooperation
  Organization security bloc meeting in Tianjin, China, at the end of August,
  complicating plans to hold a bilateral summit in the coming two weeks. The
  European “coalition of the willing” first met virtually, co-chaired by Keir
  Starmer and Emmanuel Macron, before joining a video conference hosted by the
  European Council president, António Costa. Europe’s flurry of diplomacy is
  aimed at pushing Trump to take a tougher line with Putin, days after their
  friendly summit in Alaska. Trump, along with several European leaders in
  Washington on Monday, said Putin had agreed to face-to-face talks with
  Zelenskyy in the coming weeks in an attempt to end the three-and-a-half-year
  war in Ukraine. Moscow, however, has yet to confirm that any such meeting –
  which would be the first between the two leaders since the invasion – is in
  the works. The Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov has said only that Putin and Trump
  discussed the idea of “raising the level of representatives” in Ukraine talks.
  In remarks late on Monday, Ushakov did not clarify what that would entail and
  made no mention of a possible trilateral meeting with Trump and Zelenskyy. On
  Tuesday, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, told state TV that any
  meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents would have to be prepared
  “very thoroughly”. In his interview with Fox News on Tuesday, Trump conceded
  it was possible that Putin did not want to make a deal. “We’re going to find
  out about President Putin in the next couple of weeks … It’s possible that he
  doesn’t want to make a deal,” the US president said, adding that Putin would
  face a “rough situation” if that were the case. At the heart of Tuesday’s
  talks among European allies was the question of what security guarantees could
  be offered to Ukraine. On Monday, Zelenskyy described security guarantees as
  “a key issue, a starting point towards ending the war” and he appreciated
  Trump’s indication that the US was ready to be part of that guarantee.
  Zelenskyy said those guarantees would be “formalised in some way in the next
  week or 10 days”, which could prove to be a long time when it comes to
  diplomacy involving Trump’s White House. In a social media post late on
  Monday, Trump said the White House talks included plans for European countries
  to provide security assurances to Ukraine with the US acting as “coordinator”.
  Britain and several European allies have floated the idea of a “reassurance
  force” that could be sent to Ukraine under a future peace deal to deter
  renewed Russian aggression. Their plans would need firm US backing and Trump
  has been resistant to deploying US troops as guarantors of any settlement.
  Moscow issued a statement on Monday evening rejecting any prospect of Nato
  personnel being deployed in Ukraine. “We reaffirm our categorical opposition
  to any scenarios involving the stationing of a Nato contingent in Ukraine,”
  Russia’s foreign ministry said. Other proposals for security guarantees
  include western allies offering Ukraine article 5-style protection, similar to
  Nato’s collective defence pledge that treats an attack on one member as an
  attack on all. In a statement after Monday’s White House meeting, Italy’s
  prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, said that while Ukraine would not be joining
  Nato, western allies would commit to “a collective security clause that would
  allow Ukraine to benefit from the support of all its partners, including the
  United States, ready to take action if it is attacked again”. Zelenskyy has
  made clear that Ukraine would reject any deal limiting the size of its armed
  forces, insisting that “a strong Ukrainian army” must be part of the country’s
  security guarantees. These proposals run counter to the conditions Putin has
  previously outlined as acceptable for ending the war. While western leaders
  adopted an upbeat, congratulatory tone toward Trump at the White House, the
  gulf between Russia’s demands and Ukraine’s willingness to concede remains
  vast. There remains widespread confusion over what exactly Trump proposed and
  what, if anything, Putin agreed to during the Alaska summit. Some fear Trump
  may have overstated the outcome and misjudged Moscow’s willingness to
  compromise. Monday’s White House meeting shed little light on Putin’s
  territorial terms. The Russian leader has demanded Ukraine’s withdrawal from
  Donetsk and Luhansk, but Zelenskyy has set a firm red line against ceding land
  beyond the present occupation or legitimising Moscow’s control. Some observers
  say that for all the diplomatic manoeuvring, there has been little real
  movement towards ending the war. “Nothing had happened in Anchorage on Aug.
  15th. Nothing happened yesterday in Washington DC,” Gérard Araud, the former
  French ambassador to the US, wrote on X. “Putin, Zelenskyy and the European
  leaders were all relieved: they had avoided Trump taking unwelcome decisions.
  It was the triumph of empty vagueness and meaningless commitments.”
