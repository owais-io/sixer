  A controversial Buddhist organisation, at the centre of an alleged Chinese
  espionage case in Australia, has raised concerns about Beijing keeping tabs on
  Chinese diaspora overseas. Guan Yin Citta Dharma Door is an international
  Buddhist organisation with multiple chapters in Australia. This month, a
  Chinese-born woman was charged with reckless foreign interference, accused of
  spying on the group’s Australian branches and its members on behalf of the
  Chinese Communist party’s intelligence organs. Australian police have said the
  investigation is ongoing and more people could be charged. Guan Yin Citta
  practises Mahayana Buddhism, the most common type of Buddhism in China. But
  the organisation is controversial. News reports have detailed unusual and
  fringe beliefs the group promotes, and the history of its late founder, Master
  Jun Hong Lu, who died in 2021. It has been banned in China, and people warned
  to steer clear of it. How big is the group? The organisation claims to have 10
  million members worldwide, with 5 million in China, but the Chinese government
  says it is just 50,000. State media has accused it of being a cult with “evil
  theories”, and officials have vowed to crack down on it with “an iron fist”.
  In 2016, a Henan province follower was jailed for five years for printing
  100,000 copies of an “unauthorised” Guan Yin Citta journal. Before his death,
  Lu had been banned from entering China. Why is the Chinese government opposed
  to it? It has been criticised by Buddhist groups in China, Hong Kong and
  Malaysia for allegedly distorting teachings, and Master Lu of abusing Buddhist
  scriptures and mantras and “using the illusion of supernatural powers to
  mislead believers”, according to a 2015 letter by 16 Malaysian Buddhist
  groups. Nevertheless, Guan Yin Citta is legal in Australia, and while the
  controversies around the organisation muddy the waters a little, allegations
  of surveillance support claims about the CCP’s intolerance of religious groups
  outside its direct control. Sign up: AU Breaking News email John Fitzgerald, a
  historian of China, says that under the increasingly authoritarian rule of Xi
  Jinping, all things that could threaten the party in any way are seen as
  equivalent. “There’s almost no calibration any longer,” Fitzgerald told the
  Guardian. “Anything that threatens the august and unrivalled authority of the
  party, no matter how trivial, is treated as a grave threat.” Fitzgerald says
  the CCP looks at religion as a cultural signifier of ethnicity, something that
  has to be managed inside both China and diaspora communities who could
  influence the domestic population. How are religions restricted within China?
  Under the strict political rule of the Communist party, China is officially an
  atheist state. The government officially recognises Buddhism, along with
  Catholicism, Islam, Protestantism and Taoism, but the practise of those
  religions is strictly policed. Buddhism, Taoism and some folk religions are
  generally treated less harshly than Islam and Christianity, analysts have
  noted, but believers across all religions have faced repression and
  persecution by the CCP – most notably the Muslim population in Xinjiang, and
  Tibetan Buddhists. “The CCP leaders know that it is not easy to completely
  eradicate these religions out of China. (There are even CCP members who are
  secretly following these religions),” says Julie Yu-Wen Chen, a professor of
  Chinese Studies at the University of Helsinki. “The best strategy is to
  sinicise them to make them suitable for the Chinese society and then to
  control and monitor the practices on the ground.” How does China use religion
  to monitor groups overseas? The CCP will often use suitably sinicised
  practises for its soft diplomacy. Much of it is driven by China’s state
  administration for religious affairs, and the Buddhist Association of China,
  which seek to work with Buddhists globally in pursuit of the CCP’s goals,
  often hosting international Buddhism conferences and making targeted foreign
  investments through Xi’s flagship overseas investment regime, the belt and
  road initiative. “They recognise religion as subversive,” Fitzgerald says.
  “They’re not going to allow that subversion to happen in China or anything
  like that. But they will take full advantage of it in any other community.” As
  China’s security apparatus expands, reaching across the world with
  extraterritorial security laws, extensive espionage and infiltration networks,
  and rising rates of transnational repression, it has become an unavoidable
  national security issue for other countries like Australia. Religious groups
  and practitioners, dissidents, lawyers and journalists are among those
  frequently targeted. Foreign interference has affected bilateral relations.
  Last week Australia joined other nations in condemning China’s persecution of
  exiled Hong Kong pro-democracy activists. Meanwhile, across the world, Uyghurs
  have been harassed, surveilled and deported en masse to Xinjiang, and nations
  reacted with alarm to revelations of a network of secret overseas Chinese
  police stations. “There’s far greater awareness now in Australia of the
  implications of this thing for national security,” Fitzgerald says. Additional
