  Asylum seekers are being targeted – and so are those who help them. It’s a

  In today’s social media age, one version of events spreads like wildfire. So
  it is fast becoming accepted in the national conversation that all men risking
  life and limb to cross the Channel in flimsy vessels are dangerous people who
  are likely to abuse women and girls. The leader of the opposition, Kemi
  Badenoch, went so far as to say that, because of rising numbers coming in
  small boats, women had “stopped jogging in the park because there are men
  lurking in bushes”. As the political rhetoric has become more toxic, and
  especially this week, the real-world consequences for those inside the hotels
  and for organisations like my own and many others in the charity and statutory
  sector become more dire. The plight of the asylum seekers themselves must stay
  front and centre. On the street they have faced verbal abuse and hostility.
  Shouts of “Go home, scumbag” and more hate-filled language are not uncommon. I
  met an African man in his 60s living in the north-east recently who in May,
  not long after the prime minister told the country “we risk becoming an island
  of strangers”, was set upon by a group of men and suffered a broken arm. He
  was so terrified he didn’t want to leave his accommodation for weeks on end.
  But the threats are not just aimed at them; also being targeted are those who
  seek to help them. Thinking about personal safety at work has become part and
  parcel of the job. I am now even being advised to consider my own home
  security. This was unimaginable nearly five years ago, when I started my role.
  At the Refugee Council we work in communities with refugees including on some
  allotments, where they love to grow food. In one northern town, well before
  the riots last summer that saw asylum seekers burned out of a Rotherham hotel,
  ours was the only allotment patch that was firebombed one night. We now tell
  staff not to wear their lanyards, so they’re not visible when out and about as
  they’ve had abusive comments. We aren’t alone. Far-right influencers are
  targeting the refugee sector, posting pictures of chief executives and naming
  them. Leaders in recent weeks have had to come to terms with a new normal
  whereby they have to think about their and their staff’s safety both on and
  offline. Some of the organisations targeted are small and community-rooted
  without the capability and infrastructure of larger organisations to put in
  place sophisticated risk assessments and security procedures. And then there
  are the lone individuals who want to threaten and scare us. I know of leaders
  not just in the charity sector but also in the statutory sector who have
  received threatening handwritten messages saying they and their families
  aren’t safe. Those who have worked with refugees for decades tell me they have
  never known a time when the hostility has been so strong and the environment
  so toxic. And it ripples out so that support which would be in place is
  withdrawn. I’ve been told about food banks that did provide assistance to any
  person who needed it turning away people they believe to be “foreigners” with
  no right to be in the UK. Hidden from public view, the poisoned political
  environment on asylum is having consequences not seen before. The narrative
  that refugees and migrants are the root of all our problems means that they
  and those who work with them are firmly in the line of fire, seen as
  legitimate daily targets of hate. It is not too late, however, to pull back
  from the brink. There is a role for government: to try to neutralise the
  toxicity by not only focusing on fixing the dysfunctional and costly asylum
  system, but also by articulating a pride in Britain that celebrates our
  diversity and integration story. One that saw Mo Farah, himself a victim of
  trafficking who was given safety in our country, proudly wrap himself in the
  union jack every time he won one of his Olympic gold medals. We have a choice.
  As a nation, we can drift further into a world of division and hate. Or we can
  celebrate British values of fairness, tolerance and compassion, and focus on
  the importance of a shared community that so many Britons believe in. The
  direction of travel our prime minister and his government choose to take feels
  more important than it has ever been in the seven decades of the Refugee
  Council’s history. We look to our political leaders to do far more to bring an
  end to the division and hate and say clearly: this is not who we are. Enver
