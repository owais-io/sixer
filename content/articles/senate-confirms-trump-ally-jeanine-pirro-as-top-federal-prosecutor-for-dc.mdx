  The US Senate has confirmed Jeanine Pirro – a former Fox News host and staunch
  Donald Trump ally who boosted lies that he lost the 2020 presidential race
  because of electoral fraudsters – as the top federal prosecutor for the
  nation’s capital. Pirro – a former New York state district attorney and county
  judge who joined Fox News in 2011 – was confirmed on Saturday in a 50-45 vote
  along party lines. In a statement issued by Pirro after the vote, the
  Republican said she was “blessed” to have been confirmed as the US attorney
  for Washington DC. “Get ready for a real crime fighter,” said Pirro’s
  statement, which called the US attorney’s office she had been confirmed to
  lead the largest in the country. Before her media career, Pirro spent over a
  decade as a Republican district attorney in Westchester county, New York, and
  also served as a county judge. She hosted her own Fox show Justice with Judge
  Jeanine. And more recently, she became a co-host on the Fox show The Five.
  Pirro used her time at Fox News in part to publicly support the baseless
  claims that Trump lost his first presidency to Joe Biden in 2020 because of
  voter fraud. In 2021, she was among several Fox News hosts named in the
  defamation lawsuit against Fox News by Dominion Voting Systems, which accused
  the network of knowingly airing false claims about the company’s voting
  machines after the previous year’s election. Fox ultimately settled the
  lawsuit for $787.5m and has acknowledged that the fraud claims were false.
  Pirro has been serving as the interim US attorney since May, when her fellow
  Republican Trump nominated her to the post months into his second presidency.
  She was nominated after Trump withdrew the nomination of conservative activist
  Ed Martin, his first choice for the role. A key Republican senator, North
  Carolina’s Thom Tillis, had said he would not support Martin’s nomination. In
  announcing Pirro’s nomination in May, Trump praised her record, and said that
  she was a “powerful crusader for victims of crime” and someone who “excelled
  in all ways”. “Jeanine is incredibly well qualified for this position,” the
  president added. The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, on Saturday published a
  statement exalting Pirro as “a warrior for law and order”. At the end of his
  first presidency, Trump pardoned Pirro’s former husband, Albert Pirro Jr,
  after he had been convicted in 2000 on federal charges of fraud and tax
  evasion. Pirro is one of a number of Trump loyalists with ties to Fox who have
  joined the president’s administration. Other prominent ones include her fellow
  ex-Fox News host Pete Hegseth, the embattled defense secretary, and the former
  Fox Business personality Sean Duffy, the embattled transportation secretary.
  In June, US senator Adam Schiff accused Pirro of “blind obedience to Donald
  Trump is nearly unrivaled among his ardent supporters”. “For an important
  prosecutorial position like this one, the country has a right to demand a
  serious and principled public servant,” Schiff said. “Jeanine Pirro is not
  it.” Despite Pirro’s confirmation, the US Senate left Washington DC on
  Saturday night for its monthlong August recess without a deal to advance
  dozens of Trump nominees despite days of contentious, bipartisan negotiations.
  An irate Trump went on social media and told Senate Democratic leader Chuck
  Schumer to “GO TO HELL!”
