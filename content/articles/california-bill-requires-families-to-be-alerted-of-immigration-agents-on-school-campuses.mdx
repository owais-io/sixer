  California lawmakers have passed a bill requiring schools to alert families
  and teachers when immigration enforcement authorities are on campuses as the
  Trump administration continues its aggressive mass deportation campaign. Under
  the bill, K-12 schools, state universities and community colleges must notify
  students, faculty and staff, “similar to early warning systems in place for
  other campus emergencies”, according to a statement from state senator Sasha
  Renée Pérez, who authored the legislation. It now heads to Gavin Newsom, who
  has until 12 October to sign it into law. The legislation would take effect
  immediately if signed and remain in effect until 2031. “With students
  returning to school, this legislation is more important than ever,” Pérez, the
  chair of the senate education committee, said in a statement. “In the face of
  mass deportations, raids and immigration enforcement authorities showing up at
  schools, the Safe Act can help inform and empower school communities to make
  the best decisions about their safety and their family’s safety,” she said.
  The bill comes as the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown has thrown
  communities into turmoil, and immigration agents have arrested people outside
  schools and in shopping centers. State lawmakers passed a slate of proposals
  in response to the crackdown on Tuesday, and advanced bills banning
  immigration authorities from entering nonpublic areas of school or hospital
  grounds without a warrant. “Students cannot learn unless they feel safe,”
  Democratic assemblymember Al Muratsuchi said. “For decades we had a bipartisan
  agreement to keep educational institutions, schools, campuses, free from
  immigration enforcement activities.” The legislation was backed by Tony
  Thurmond, the state superintendent of public instruction, who oversees
  California’s public school system. “Our immigrant families are living in fear
  and our time to act is limited. The school year has begun, and now is the time
  to make decisive efforts to protect our communities and maintain schools as a
  safe place for learning,” Thurmond said. Other Democratic-led states
  introduced legislation this year aimed at protecting immigrants in their
  homes, at work and during police encounters amid Trump’s mass deportation
  plans. As the school year began at Los Angeles unified last month, officials
  urged immigration authorities not to conduct enforcement activity near
  campuses during the school day. The school district, which is the country’s
  second-largest, includes approximately 30,000 immigrant students, an estimated
  quarter of whom are without legal status, according to the teachers’ union. In
  August, federal immigration agents detained a 15-year-old boy at gunpoint
  outside a Los Angeles high school, a case that has drawn widespread outrage in
  the city.
