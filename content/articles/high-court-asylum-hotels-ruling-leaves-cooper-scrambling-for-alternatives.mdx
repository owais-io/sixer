  Yvette Cooper, thanks to Tuesday’s high court ruling, is facing potentially
  explosive decisions over where to house asylum seekers if courts rule that
  they must leave hotels. The Home Office, usually under Conservative ministers,
  has been struggling for five years to find an alternative to hotels so they
  can house a growing number of asylum seekers reaching these shores. Labour has
  said that it expects to empty the 200-odd hotels housing asylum seekers by
  2029. Ministers may be forced to rip up that plan and move at a rapid pace
  because of the ruling’s implications. If councils take to the high court to
  complain about the use of a hotel for housing asylum seekers – and many will
  be under immense political pressure from the public to do so – it could force
  officials to find alternative housing for thousands of people. Legal sources
  believe that there will be similar grounds to launch applications for interim
  injunctions from a number of councils. This case has centred on an alleged
  breach of planning laws by owners of the Bell hotel, who it was claimed did
  not get permission to switch use from a hotel to hostel-style accommodation.
  Other hotel owners are thought to be in similar positions to Somani Hotels
  Limited, which originally housed families in the Bell, but faced a legal
  challenge after the asylum seekers were switched to single men. Ominously for
  the government, the Reform UK deputy leader, Richard Tice, said his party
  would look at pursuing similar cases regarding hotels within the 10 council
  areas it controls, which include both North and West Northamptonshire
  councils, Doncaster, and Kent and Staffordshire county councils. And the high
  court rulings can require a rapid response. Epping’s application for an
  interim injunction was launched on 12 August. By 4pm on 12 September, all
  asylum seekers will have to be removed from the Bell hotel. There may yet be a
  lifeline for the government. They could convince the court of appeal to
  overturn the decision. The fact that the Home Office was not allowed to
  intervene in a case that was directly related to the home secretary’s duties
  to house asylum seekers could well be seized upon by government lawyers. If
  they fail to overturn the decision, they will face the same dilemma as
  successive Tory home secretaries going back to Priti Patel, who promised and
  failed to find alternatives to hotels to house asylum seekers. The number of
  asylum hotels soared to 400 under successive Tory home secretaries because of
  a shortage of housing, a growing backlog in asylum applications, and a failure
  to establish large accommodation sites in buildings such as disused military
  barracks. Since coming to power, Labour has increased the speed at which
  applications are processed, and used more “dispersal accommodation” such as
  flats and housing in the community. Questions will no doubt be asked inside
  the department as to why it took the Home Office until Monday to try to
  intervene in the case. If it had done so last week, when the case came to
  court, it would have stood a better chance of preventing the injunction. The
  political implications of the ruling will continue to unsettle Cooper and No
  10. The government has been caught flat-footed on an immigration-related
  issue, as it struggles with soaring numbers of small boats crossing the
  Channel. Anti-asylum seeker protesters will see this as a victory in response
  to their demonstrations across the country this summer. Reform UK and its
  leader, Nigel Farage, now leading in most polls, will be buoyed up by the
  prospect of further embarrassment for the government.
