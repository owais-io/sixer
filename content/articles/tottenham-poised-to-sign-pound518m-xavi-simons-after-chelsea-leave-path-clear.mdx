  Tottenham are poised to complete the £51.8m signing of Xavi Simons from RB
  Leipzig. Personal terms have been agreed with the attacking midfielder and a
  medical has taken place. Barring any last-minute hitches the deal will be a
  major boost for Thomas Frank, who has been looking to add an attacking
  midfielder. Spurs have lost James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski to injury and
  have missed out on Eberechi Eze, who joined Arsenal from Crystal Palace, and
  Nottingham Forest’s Morgan Gibbs-White, who signed a new contract. Chelsea
  were also interested in Simons but never made a bid for the 22-year-old. There
  are no indications that the club will disrupt their London rivals by
  attempting a late swoop for the Netherlands international. Chelsea are well
  stocked in attacking midfield, despite agreeing a £36m deal for Christopher
  Nkunku to join Milan. They have focused on a £40m deal for the Manchester
  United winger Alejandro Garnacho and have targets beyond Simons, including
  Barcelona’s Fermín López. Spurs have been able to take advantage of Chelsea
  not firming up their interest. The north London club properly entered the race
  on Wednesday and have moved quickly to agree terms with Leipzig, who are in a
  hurry to finalise a deal so they can move for Liverpool’s Harvey Elliott.
  Jürgen Klopp, the Red Bull head of global soccer and Elliott’s former manager
  at Liverpool, is a significant part of that proposed transfer. Chelsea
  explored offloading a player to Leipzig as part of any deal for Simons but
  that did not appeal to the Bundesliga club and Simons flew to London on
  Wednesday to discuss a transfer with Spurs. He contract is expected to run to
  2032. Simons, who can play in the middle or on the flanks, has been clear
  about his desire to leave this summer. He came through Barcelona’s academy
  before spells at PSV and Paris Saint-Germain, who sold him to Leipzig last
  January. Wolves are in talks over a deal to sign Tolu Arokodare from Genk. The
  Nigeria striker scored 17 goals in the Belgian Pro League last season and is
  understood to be available for between £15m and £20m. Arokodare is open to
  moving to the Premier League and has emerged as an option for Wolves after
  their pursuit of Getafe’s Christantus Uche stalled over personal terms. West
  Ham have completed the £38m signing of Mateus Fernandes from Southampton. The
  midfielder has joined on a five-year deal and hands Graham Potter a major
  boost after a dreadful start to the season. West Ham have been desperate for
  midfield reinforcements and are also poised to announce the £17.2m signing of
  Soungoutou Magassa from Monaco. Magassa, 21, has agreed a six-year deal.
  Nottingham Forest and Eintracht Frankfurt were interested in Magassa. The
  France Under-21 international has opted for West Ham, who are expected to fail
  with an attempt to sign Ibrahim Sangaré on loan. Forest indicated they would
  let Sangare go on loan only if West Ham did not sign Magassa. Potter could
  look to add a third midfielder. West Ham are monitoring Feyernoord’s Quinten
  Timber, who has been targeted by Bayer Leverkusen. They also want a goalkeeper
  on loan but have turned down the chance to sign Manchester United’s André
  Onana. Potter is interested in bringing in a striker. West Ham are open to
  selling Nayef Aguerd. The Morocco centre-back has interest from Sunderland and
  Marseille
