  A 20-year-old Palestinian woman suffering from severe malnutrition who was
  evacuated from Gaza to Italy this week has died, a hospital in Pisa has said.
  The woman, named by Italian media as Marah Abu Zuhri, arrived in Pisa on an
  Italian government humanitarian flight on Wednesday night. Zuhri had come to
  Italy with her mother on one of three Italian air force flights that arrived
  this week with a total of 31 critical patients suffering from serious
  congenital diseases, wounds or amputations, the Italian foreign ministry said
  at the time. According to the University hospital of Pisa she had a “very
  complex clinical picture” and was “in a profound state of organic wasting”,
  doctors said in a statement. On Friday, after undergoing tests and starting
  treatment, she had a sudden respiratory crisis and cardiac arrest, and died.
  The hospital did not elaborate on her condition, but Italian news agencies
  reporting health facility sources said that she was suffering from severe
  malnutrition. More than 180 children and young people from Gaza have been
  brought to Italy since the war began between Israel and Hamas. According to
  the UN World Food Programme, one-third of the Palestinian population in Gaza
  goes for days without eating, and half a million are on the brink of
  starvation, it said in July. “The worst-case scenario of famine is currently
  playing out in the Gaza Strip,” the Integrated Food Security Phase
  Classification (IPC) said last month, calling for an urgent ceasefire to
  alleviate “widespread starvation”. According to the UN Office for the
  Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) another five people died last week
  due to malnutrition and starvation, bringing the total number of
  malnutrition-related deaths to 227, including 103 children, since October
  2023. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, claimed last month:
  “There is no policy of starvation in Gaza, and there is no starvation in
  Gaza.” However, even Donald Trump, Netanyahu’s key international ally, when
  asked if he agreed with the Israeli PM, said: “I don’t know … those children
  look very hungry … that’s real starvation stuff.” Thousands of sick children
  in Gaza need urgent medical evacuation, according to OCHA. Olga Cherevko, a
  spokesperson for the agency, recalled the moment she recognised a young girl
  requiring treatment in a Gaza hospital that she had met a year earlier, once
  again suffering from malnourishment. “I remembered her long eyelashes,” the
  veteran humanitarian told UN News, describing seven-year-old Janah, whom she
  came across at Gaza City’s Patient Friendly hospital on Tuesday. “The first
  time I met her was in the IMC Field Hospital in southern Gaza in April 2024.
  Back then, she was severely malnourished and was getting treatment. And she
  gradually became better and was released eventually and went home.” However,
  Janah was now back in hospital “because the malnutrition became aggravated and
  the condition that she has also is not properly diagnosed and cannot be
  properly diagnosed”. The girl was on a list of people to be medically
  evacuated for treatment outside Gaza. The most recent evacuations took place
  on Wednesday when the World Health Organization supported the transfer of 32
  children and six adults to Italy, Belgium and Turkey, but more than 14,800
  patients are still waiting. Cherevko stressed the importance of ensuring that
  evacuations continue to save as many lives as possible. She pointed out that
  for children and adults with pre-existing conditions, their situation becomes
  worse with malnutrition. “It wouldn’t be this way if they had proper
  nutrition, because these conditions existed before the starvation crisis and
  they weren’t getting as sick as they are now,” she said. On Saturday the
  Israeli military announced it was preparing to relocate Palestinians as it
  launches a new offensive to seize control of northern Gaza City in a plan that
  has raised international alarm.
