  In early September, a jury trial will begin in North Texas for a 32-year-old
  activist named Raunaq Alam. He is accused of spray-painting “Fuck Israel” on
  the wall of a non-denominational church in Euless, a small city roughly 20
  minutes from Fort Worth. But it’s not the graffiti accusation that’s most
  troubling for Alam and his attorney. Using a hate-crimes statute, Tarrant
  county has enhanced its criminal mischief charges against Alam so he now faces
  between two and 10 years in prison. The county’s argument – and the charges –
  are the same for two other activists, who will face trial separately at later
  dates. For Alam, the official indictment argues the activist has “bias or
  prejudice against a group identified by national origin and/or ancestry and/or
  religion, namely, the state of Israel or Jewish faith”. Attorneys and experts
  interviewed by the Guardian say this is a legally questionable move that
  conflates the state of Israel with Judaism and infringes on the right to free
  speech. After all, the alleged graffiti specifically named “Israel”, not
  Israelis, and Israel is not a person, nor one of the protected classes that
  hate-crime laws ostensibly exist to protect. What’s more, the church wall that
  was allegedly defaced does not belong to a synagogue. In a motion to quash the
  hate-crimes enhancement, Alam’s attorney, Adwoa Asante, points out that
  Texas’s criminal code “provides clear guidelines as to which protected classes
  can be used in the prosecution of hate crimes”. “Nowhere in the statute does
  it cite governmental entities such as states as part of protected persons or
  group,” Asante wrote. “If citizens and persons within the United States are
  allowed to say and express ‘Fuck America’, why would the condemnation of a
  foreign country garner more enhanced prosecution from the state of Texas?”
  County prosecutors did not respond to questions from the Guardian. Yasmin
  Nair, a writer and researcher who has studied and critiqued hate-crimes
  legislation, says these charges show how these statutes can be used by
  powerful entities to suppress speech deemed unpopular. “The notion of a hate
  crime has been fitted over these very expansive definitions of antisemitism,”
  Nair said. “Now, hate-crime laws can be used to fulfill a rather different
  agenda, that’s not even entirely a domestic agenda. Even thinking of
  critiquing what’s happening in Gaza is considered antisemitic.” Alam said he
  has been outspoken about human rights issues since his high-school days in
  Texas. Most recently, his work has centered on the plight of the Palestinian
  people who are enduring man-made starvation and a brutal Israeli military
  assault that has killed tens of thousands of civilians, many of them women and
  children. Some experts have said Israel is carrying out a genocide. “We don’t
  know if he’s guilty of this offense or not,” Asante said. “It’s simply a
  matter of how far the government is going to silence and to repress anybody
  that opposes the genocide of Palestinians, so much so that they’re expanding
  what it means to engage in a hate crime.” Alam adds that anyone who knows him
  knows he’s not a hateful person. “I’ve always spoken out in favor of people
  that are oppressed,” he said. “It’s something that’s just truly embedded in my
  core. When I see people that are treated unfairly, I believe it’s my duty to
  use my voice for those people that don’t have a voice to speak or that don’t
  have a platform to speak.” At this point, Alam has been arrested multiple
  times as the charges against him have changed. He says he lost his job when
  police, accompanied by the FBI, showed up to arrest him for the first time in
  March 2024. They also talked to his co-workers. The goal, his attorney
  believes, was “reputational damage”. “And it worked, because he lost his job.”
  At first, Alam was facing a misdemeanor for the alleged graffiti, and the
  county even offered a deal for probation. It was ultimately revoked, and
  sometime between his original arrest in March 2024 and last fall, the county
  decided to elevate the graffiti charge to the felony level and use the
  hate-crime statute to seek a prison term of up to 10 years. The prosecutors
  now claim the damage caused more than $750, even though the original arrest
  records claim the damage was under $200. Mark Streiff, a defense attorney who
  often works in Tarrant county, said he thought Alam has a good chance of
  getting a fair trial, “at least from a jury standpoint”. But Alam’s
  prosecutor, Lloyd Whelchel, typically tries high-profile cases such as capital
  murders. To Streiff and the other defense attorneys, assigning Whelchel for
  this case – and adding the hate-crime charges at the same time – seems
  political, though not wholly surprising. Recently, Tarrant county became a
  precursor for Texas’s broader redistricting efforts. “I like to joke around
  and call it Tyrant county,” said Streiff, who is concerned free speech is
  being eroded in Texas. He recently represented Carolyn Rodriguez, a well-known
  local police watcher who was found guilty of hindering a meeting by disorderly
  conduct after shouting an expletive at the judge who played a significant role
  in the county’s redistricting efforts. Rodriguez and Streiff are appealing
  against the conviction. Streiff points out that Texas has a spotty history
  with hate-crimes legislation. For instance, the perpetrator behind the 2019
  attack of Muhlaysia Booker, a transgender woman living in Dallas, was not
  charged with a hate crime because gender identity is not protected under the
  state’s hate-crime statute. The attacker, Edward Thomas, was convicted of
  misdemeanor assault and sentenced to 300 days in jail. Booker was murdered a
  year later by a different person. Alison Grinter Allen, a longtime defense
  attorney in north Texas, is representing Afsheen Khan, a 23-year old woman
  whom the county also plans to try for hate-crime charges related to the
  graffiti allegation. Grinter Allen agrees with Streiff that the charges reek
  of politics: the Tarrant county prosecutor “wants to shine the boots of a
  president and a regime that everybody knows is on the wrong side of history”,
  she said. At the state level, the Texas legislature almost unanimously passed
  a bill requiring public school districts, open-enrollment charter schools and
  colleges and universities to use a controversial definition and working
  examples of “antisemitism” in student disciplinary hearings. Those examples
  include “denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, eg by
  claiming the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavor”; “applying
  double standards by requiring of it (Israel) a behavior not expected or
  demanded of any other democratic nation”; and “holding Jews collectively
  responsible for the actions of the state of Israel”. “It may surprise some of
  you to learn that Jewish communities do not uniformly support this bill,”
  state congressman Jon Rosenthal, a Democrat, said. “I would suggest that if we
  really wanted to address religious discrimination, religious persecution, in
  bullying, that we would be crafting a law to go after any form of religious
  persecution.” Khan, Grinter Allen’s client, says her mental health “has
  definitely deteriorated” over the prospect of prison time. “Journalists and
  people that are standing up [to genocide], they are for sure being targeted,
  especially those who look like me.” But in many ways, she considers herself
  fortunate. “It could be worse,” she said. “I mean, I’m looking at what’s going
  on in Palestine, how there are political prisoners over there that have been
  suffering for years and years now.” Alam also wants as much focus as possible
  to remain on Gaza and the tens of thousands of people who have been killed
  there by Israeli soldiers. “I have so much love and compassion for people, and
  that’s the main reason why I’m so outspoken,” he said. “That’s why I’m an
  activist: because I care so much about people, and I care so much about
  injustice. So the people around me, they support me. And I guess they just
  want to see me get through this.”
