  The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) denied requests for three
  Kentucky counties affected by severe storms last spring, and deemed the state
  ineligible for hazard mitigation grants that would help prepare for future
  disasters . Fema officials claimed the areas did not suffer enough damage to
  merit federal support, in a letter issued to the governor on Tuesday. But the
  move is just the latest in a series of denials from the agency, as the Trump
  administration seeks to shift the burden of responding to and recovering from
  disasters on to states. Last week, Fema also rejected Maryland’s request for
  disaster assistance after near-record-level flooding in May destroyed hundreds
  of homes and businesses and tore into roads and public infrastructure, leaving
  close to $16m in damages. “Our communities need help recovering from a massive
  storm,” Maryland’s governor, Wes Moore, said in a video about the denial of
  his disaster assistance request, adding that he “saw the devastation up
  close”. He acknowledged that there were specific criteria to qualify for the
  designations that were met. “It is an insult to Marylanders and the
  communities still suffering in the aftermath of this storm.” Fema, which is
  responsible for an on-the-ground response during large-scale emergencies along
  with coordinating resource deployment, funding recovery and supporting efforts
  to mitigate risks, has been left critically under-resourced and unprepared for
  the escalating and compounding catastrophes wreaking havoc across the US with
  greater intensity and frequency. Trump has called for dismantling the agency,
  part of the US Department of Homeland Security, and has already begun to cut
  funding in key areas. “We want to wean off of Fema, and we want to bring it
  back to the state level,” the president said, speaking from the Oval Office in
  June, noting his plans to promptly “give out less money” to states in
  recovery. Fema has also terminated a multibillion-dollar grant program funding
  infrastructure upgrades that build resiliency, a move challenged in court by a
  group of 20 states earlier this month. Many of these states also filed
  lawsuits against the administration in May over directives that would link
  funding for emergency preparedness to immigration enforcement cooperation.
  “This administration is abandoning states and local communities that rely on
  federal funding to protect their residents and, in the event of disaster, save
  lives,” said the Massachusetts attorney general, Andrea Campbell, in a
  statement about the elimination of Fema’s building resilient infrastructure
  and communities program, which was approved and funded by Congress. But even
  amid growing criticism and demands for increases in federal funding, the Trump
  administration has continued pushing for less reliance on federal support. As
  the climate crisis fuels an increasing number of more costly catastrophes and
  creates overlapping layers of risk, concerns are rising that states and
  counties will not be able to prepare or respond. Greater reliance on local
  resources could also leave severe recovery gaps. Many emergency management
  departments are small and their structures are highly variable from agency to
  agency, according to a new study from the Department of Energy that surveyed
  local preparedness. The study, which surveyed more than 1,600 directors of
  state and local emergency management agencies between August 2024 and March
  2025, found the understaffed and overworked offices were debilitated by
  funding shortages and lacking in a clear mission. With the future of the
  agency in question, for now, the governors in states that were denied
  designations are appealing and hoping for a different outcome. Kentucky’s
  governor, Andy Beshear, said he was “disappointed in the decision”, but added
  that the state appreciates the assistance provided to some counties more
  devastated by the historic flooding, landslides and a major tornado outbreak
  in April and May. The harm in the three counties left out of the designations,
  the agency said, was not severe enough to merit inclusion. “We are actively
  comparing damage assessments,” Beshear said, “and we plan to appeal.”
