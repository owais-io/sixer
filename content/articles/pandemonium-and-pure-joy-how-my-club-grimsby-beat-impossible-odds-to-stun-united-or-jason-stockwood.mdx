  Some nights you know, even as they’re happening, will stay with you for ever.
  Wednesday night at Blundell Park was one of them. A full house, the world’s
  media watching, and Grimsby Town delivering the sort of performance that will
  be told and retold in pubs, workplaces and playgrounds for decades. The pitch
  looked perfect under the lights. The performance was even better. When
  Manchester United’s manager, Ruben Amorim, admitted afterwards that “the best
  team won”, it felt like a moment of truth. For once, the cameras weren’t
  pointing at the Premier League’s aristocrats but at a small port town on the
  Humber. For once, the headlines belonged to us. I caught the train into town,
  something I rarely do now. I needed to be early for media duties. My wife
  drove later with the kids and a few friends. I don’t think I’ve been more
  popular than I was this week, with United in town. From the first whistle
  there was belief. When Charles Vernam opened the scoring in the 22nd minute,
  it felt like the roof came off. Tyrell Warren, once a United player, made it
  2–0 after André Onana’s error. United looked stunned. Of course they came
  back. Bryan Mbeumo pulled one back with 15 minutes to play. Harry Maguire
  headed an equaliser in the 89th minute. For a moment it felt inevitable, like
  the story would end the way it usually does. But we held on and deservedly
  took one of the biggest clubs in the world to penalties. And those penalties
  went on and on. Ten each, then 11. Finally, Mbeumo hit the bar. Twelve-eleven
  to Grimsby. Pandemonium. United beaten by a club from League Two. A pitch
  invasion. The collective joy that only football can deliver. The romance of
  the cup is a cliche, but nights like this prove why it matters. David and
  Goliath. The underdog upsetting the natural order. A squad whose wage bill
  could be covered by one opposition player’s pay packet. And yet heart,
  organisation and bravery found a way. It’s easy to be cynical about modern
  football. The billions in the Premier League. The sense that money dictates
  everything. But this was a reminder of why we keep showing up. It was for the
  fans who trudge home in the rain after another defeat but come back the next
  week. For the kids who kick a ball on a patch of grass between housing
  estates. For everyone who believes football is still about belonging, not
  balance sheets. And for one glorious night, every seat was full, everyone
  dared to hope the impossible could happen. It did, and the world had to pay
  attention. That’s the real victory. Not just the penalties, or the headlines,
  or the memes about Amorim being “sacked in the morning”. It’s knowing we
  reminded ourselves of who we are. That we showed, even against impossible
  odds, that belief can change the script. So yes, Manchester United will
  recover. Their season will roll on. But here, in Great Grimsby, it’s a night
  we’ll never forget. To paraphrase a famous Norwegian commentator: Mick
  Hucknall. James Nesbitt. Rachel Riley. Usain Bolt. Stormzy. Rory McIlroy. Some
  blokes from Guildford. Your boys took one hell of a beating. Jason Stockwood
  is the co-owner of Grimsby Town
