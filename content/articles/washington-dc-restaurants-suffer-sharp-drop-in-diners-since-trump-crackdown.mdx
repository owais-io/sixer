  The number of people eating at restaurants in Washington DC has plummeted
  since Donald Trump deployed federal troops to the city, according to data, as
  the president’s purported crackdown on crime continues. Research by Open Table
  found that restaurant attendance was down every day last week compared with
  2024, with the number of diners dipping by 31% on Wednesday, two days after
  Trump ordered the national guard to patrol Washington. Trump announced the
  move on 11 August, claiming that Washington had been “overtaken by violent
  gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged out
  maniacs and homeless people”. His claims contradicted official statistics
  which show that violent crime in the capital is at a 30-year low. Data from
  Open Table shows that the number of people making online reservations dropped
  by 16% on Monday compared with the previous year. The number fell by 27% on
  Tuesday and 31% on Wednesday, as military vehicles and armed troops were
  deployed to the city. Metropolitan Washington Summer Restaurant week in 2024
  was from 12 to 18 August. The 2025 edition of the event, during which diners
  are generally offered premium experiences at more affordable prices than
  usual, began on Monday. The data did not immediately make clear to what extent
  that may have factored into the year-to-year drop. On Friday, Democrats
  introduced a joint resolution to end what they described as “egregious attacks
  on DC home rule”, stating that Trump was overreaching in his actions in
  Washington. The Democratic US congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland issued a
  statement saying Trump’s decision to send the military into the nation’s
  capital was meant to distract the public from the president’s “close
  friendship” with the late convicted sex offender and disgraced financier
  Jeffrey Epstein. Raskin’s statement also alluded to broken promises from the
  Trump administration to fully divulge all files pertaining to the prosecutions
  of Epstein and his associate, the convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell.
  “The only emergency here is a lawless president experiencing a growing public
  relations emergency because of his … stubborn refusal to release the Epstein
  file despite his promise to do so,” Raskin’s statement said. Other Democrats
  echoed the sentiment that Trump’s move was an attempt to distract from
  criticism over Epstein and an economy that was struggling amid the passage of
  his congressional agenda bill, which included a historic $1tn cut to Medicaid.
  “What’s happening here in Washington DC is just a stunt. Donald Trump didn’t
  like the fact that the walls were closing in on him, that his own base was
  questioning why he wouldn’t release the Epstein files, why he was protecting
  very powerful people,” Chris Murphy, the US senator from Connecticut, told NBC
  on Sunday. “He didn’t want to talk any more about the fact that our healthcare
  system is about to collapse because of the cuts that they have made, that
  premiums are going to go up by 75% on Americans. And so true to form, he just
  decided to create a new news cycle.” Murphy added: “He’s just trying to
  distract from the stories he doesn’t want Americans to be talking about.”
