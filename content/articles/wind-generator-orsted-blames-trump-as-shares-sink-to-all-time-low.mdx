  Europe’s largest wind power company has blamed Donald Trump for derailing its
  business model, after it announced a $9bn (£6.7bn) fundraising and its market
  value plunged by almost a third. The share price for Denmark’s Ørsted tumbled
  to an all-time low after it told investors on Monday that the “extraordinary
  situation” facing the industry meant it would need to tap shareholders to
  cover the costs of its plans. It said “recent material developments in the US”
  meant it was unable to raise the money required by selling a stake in its new
  project off the eastern seaboard of the US, as planned. The company behind
  some of the world’s biggest offshore windfarms typically covers its costs by
  selling a stake in each project once work is under way. However, the
  president’s hardline stance against wind has slashed the values of its US
  projects. While the Biden administration was supportive of the burgeoning
  offshore sector, Trump sent shivers through the industry by ordering a review
  of offshore wind permitting and leasing on his first day back in the White
  House in January. The review dealt a blow to an industry still reeling from an
  increase in costs driven by supply chain problems following the coronavirus
  pandemic, and fast-rising interest rates that have made building new projects
  far more expensive. Trump has a long-held dislike of offshore windfarms that
  dates back at least 14 years to a spat over North Sea wind turbines that were
  visible from one of his golf courses in Scotland. He has recently claimed that
  windfarms should not be allowed because they generate “the worst form of
  energy, the most expensive form of energy” and also “kill the birds”. These
  claims have been refuted by experts. Within months of Trump’s return to power,
  his administration issued a stop-work order to a project spearheaded by the
  Norwegian wind developer Equinor. The order was a shock to many industry
  commentators who had believed that projects that had already secured their
  approvals would be safe from the industry review. Ørsted is planning to
  complete the Sunrise Wind project off the coast of New York and the Revolution
  Wind project off Rhode Island. It said the plans to raise more than $9bn would
  strengthen its capital structure and provide “financial robustness” while it
  moves ahead with global plans to build enough offshore windfarms to power more
  than 8m homes within the next two years. The fundraising will be backed by the
  Danish government, which owns half of Ørsted. However, the plans have sparked
  concerns in the market, which caused its share price to slump to 220.5 kroner
  (£25.58) on Monday morning, below its 2016 flotation price of 235 kroner.
  Rasmus Errboe, the chief executive, said: “Ørsted and our industry are in an
  extraordinary situation with the adverse market development in the US on top
  of the past years’ macroeconomic and supply chain challenges.” He added: “The
  rights issue will reinforce our ability to realise the full value potential of
  our existing portfolio and capture future value-creating opportunities in
  offshore wind.”
