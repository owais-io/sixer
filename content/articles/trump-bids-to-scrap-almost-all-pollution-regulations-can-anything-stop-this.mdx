  The Trump administration is attempting to unmake virtually all climate US
  regulations in one fell swoop. At an Indiana truck dealership on Tuesday, the
  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) unveiled a proposal to rescind the
  16-year-old landmark legal finding which allows the agency to limit
  planet-heating pollution from cars and trucks, power plants and other
  industrial sources. “The proposal would, if finalized, amount to the largest
  deregulatory action in the history of the United States,” said the EPA
  administrator, Lee Zeldin. The agency’s primary argument for reversing the
  so-called “endangerment finding” claims the Clean Air Act gives the EPA the
  authority to regulate only emissions that locally threaten health. Department
  of Energy officials also laid out another justification for the move, which
  experts say relies heavily on climate denialism. Once the proposal is
  published in the Federal Register, the EPA will open a public comment period.
  Once it finalizes the rule, it will face an array of legal challenges. But if
  the rollback prevails, it would leave the EPA without any authority to
  regulate greenhouse gas pollution amid ever-compounding evidence that a swift
  reduction in these emissions is needed to avert catastrophic global warming.
  “The importance of the endangerment finding can’t be overstated,” said the
  renowned climate scientist Michael Mann. “It’s been the primary tool that we
  have had to actually regulate carbon emissions and meet our obligations under
  various global agreements to address the climate crisis.” What is the
  administration doing? The endangerment finding, enshrined in 2009, found that
  greenhouse gases pose a threat to human health. It followed a 2007 supreme
  court ruling which found such gases were pollutants covered by the Clean Air
  Act. The finding has long been a target for elimination by climate deniers.
  Democratic administrations used it and “twisted the law, ignored precedent,
  and warped science to achieve their preferred ends and stick American families
  with hundreds of billions of dollars in hidden taxes every single year”,
  according to Zeldin. The proposed undoing of the finding followed Trump’s
  January executive order on “Unleashing American Energy”, which directed the
  agency to submit a report “on the legality and continuing applicability” of
  the endangerment finding. It comes as part of Trump’s “drill, baby, drill”
  agenda, which aims to boost already booming fossil-fuel production. Along with
  the scrapping of the endangerment finding, the EPA said it will kill off
  regulations limiting pollution coming from cars and will stymie a rule that
  curbs the amount of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, spewing from oil and gas
  drilling operations. Officials have laid out an array of legal justifications
  for the rollback. The main one rests on the idea that the Clean Air Act
  provides authority to regulate “air pollution that endangers public health or
  welfare through local or regional exposure” – but not emissions that warm the
  planet. Zealan Hoover, former senior adviser to the EPA administrator, said
  that argument does not pass muster. “The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to
  regulate any air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger
  public health or welfare,” he said. “The Trump administration is staking out
  the extreme position that climate pollution does not harm the physical or
  financial health of Americans. That flies in the face of decades of scientific
  research and the firsthand experience of millions facing sea level rise,
  extreme heat, floods and fires.” The EPA is also using the so-called “major
  questions doctrine” as an argument for the rollback, said Michael Gerrard, a
  professor of environmental and energy law at Columbia Law School and faculty
  chair of Columbia’s Earth Institute. Embraced by conservative justices, it
  says congressional authorization is needed for action on issues of broad
  importance and societal impact. “They’re saying that, regardless of what the
  text of the Clean Air Act may say, the endangerment finding is so economically
  and politically significant that the EPA can’t issue it without explicit
  congressional authorization,” said Gerrard. In a 150-page report also
  published on Tuesday, the Department of Energy (DoE) also laid out a separate
  argument for the move, which attempts to undercut the scientific consensus on
  the climate crisis. Experts say it relies on misleading scientific claims,
  such as the idea that carbon is beneficial for agriculture, which downplays
  research suggesting climate-driven extreme weather damages crop yields, and
  the debunked idea that extreme cold is more dangerous than extreme heat.
  Reached for comment, a Department of Energy spokesperson, Ben Dietderich,
  said: “This report critically assesses many areas of ongoing scientific
  inquiry that are frequently assigned high levels of confidence – not by the
  scientists themselves but by the political bodies involved, such as the United
  Nations or previous presidential administrations.” The UN and the US have
  regularly convened top scientists to produce scientific climate reports, which
  warn that urgent action to curb emissions is needed. Last week, the secretary
  general of the UN, António Guterres, gave a speech in which he said the world
  is on the brink of a breakthrough in the climate fight and fossil fuels are
  running out of road. What could the impact of the Trump administration’s move
  be? In its proposal, the EPA claimed eliminating US carbon pollution “would
  not have a scientifically measurable impact” on the global climate or on
  public health. But by warming the planet and increasing the likelihood of
  extreme weather events like wildfires and floods, greenhouse gas emissions
  pose grave threats to society, said Mann. “It isn’t remotely credible to argue
  that carbon pollution isn’t a major, if not the greatest, threat now to human
  health,” he said. With the proposed change, “the EPA is telling us in no
  uncertain terms that US efforts to address climate change are over”, said
  Abigail Dillen, president of the environmental legal non-profit Earthjustice.
  “For the industries that contribute most to climate change, the message is:
  pollute more,” she said. “For everyone feeling the pain of climate disasters,
  the message is: you’re on your own.” Though the rollback aims to create a
  regulatory environment friendly to fossil fuels, it could, ironically, also
  threaten oil companies’ attempts to fend off lawsuits aiming to hold them
  accountable for the climate crisis. To fight some challenges by cities and
  states, companies have argued that because the EPA regulates greenhouse gases
  under the Clean Air Act, those suits should be void. Throwing out EPA’s
  ability to regulate those emissions could leave energy companies open to
  further challenges. “I know that industry groups have been asking the Trump
  folks not to reverse the endangerment finding,” Jeff Holmstead, of the oil and
  gas law firm Bracewell, told E&amp;E News in February. What happens next?
  Zeldin’s proposed rulemaking on the endangerment finding initiated a 45-day
  comment period, when the public will be able to weigh in on the proposed
  change. “EPA will then have to respond to the comments, make any necessary
  changes, and issue the rule in final form,” said Gerrard, of Columbia. The
  final rule is expected to be met with an onslaught of lawsuits, which will go
  to the DC federal appeals court. The losers of those cases – either the
  government or the challengers – are expected to take them to the supreme
  court. Shaun Goho, legal director at the pollution-focused nonprofit Clean Air
  Task Force, said the proposal was “unlawful”. “Greenhouse gas emissions
  endanger public health and the climate, and the Clean Air Act mandates that
  EPA regulates harmful air pollution,” he said. Some experts are confident the
  challenges will be successful. But Gerrard says he is not so sure. “The US
  supreme court, with its 6-3 conservative majority, has issued a series of
  decisions in the past three years cutting back on federal environmental
  regulations,” he said. “So I’m concerned.” Asked about experts concerns about
  the health-harming impacts of greenhouse gases, the EPA said its proposal “is
  primarily legal and procedural”. “The endangerment finding is the legal
  prerequisite used by the Obama and Biden administrations to regulate emissions
  from new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines,” a spokesperson said.
  “Absent this finding, EPA would lack statutory authority under [the Clean Air
  Act] to prescribe standards for greenhouse gas emissions.” The spokesperson
  said “many of the predictions made and assumptions used” for the endangerment
  finding “did not materialize”. However, scientists have in recent decades
  produced many new findings showing greenhouse gases are dangerous.
