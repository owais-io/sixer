  Dark Hearts 9pm, BBC Four It’s a second season of this French war drama set in
  2016 Iraq from director Ziad Doueiri (of the Oscar-nominated The Insult). We
  get a sombre start as Group 45 toast goodbye to Olivier, but the action picks
  up when an intelligence agent comes to help the rescue mission for Sab.
  However, an attack on the French consulate means all negotiations go out the
  window. Hollie Richardson Bettany Hughes’ Lost Worlds: The Nabataeans 8.10pm,
  Channel 4 Have you ever heard of the Nabataeans? This ancient civilisation
  located in what we now regard as the Middle East has drifted out of universal
  consciousness, but in terms of power and influence they once went toe-to-toe
  with the Romans. In this new series, Bettany Hughes uncovers their spectacular
  hidden history. Phil Harrison The Count of Monte Cristo 9pm, U&amp;Drama The
  heavy-handed adaptation of the classic epic continues with Edmond (Sam
  Claflin) fizzing with vengefulness as he finally comes face-to-face with his
  old enemies – and invites them to one hell of an awkward dinner party.
  Meanwhile, he also sits down with the love of his life – who doesn’t seem to
  recognise him. HR We Want the Funk 9.10pm, BBC Two Part concert film and part
  cultural history documentary, this feature from Emmy-winning director Stanley
  Nelson Jr takes us on a syncopated voyage through the musical genre of funk.
  First stop? Berry Gordy’s front parlour, where Black music is about to break
  free from Motown’s respectability politics and take to dancing in the streets.
  Ellen E Jones One Night 9.30pm, ITV1 Simone’s (Nicole da Silva)
  not-so-fictional novel One Night is about to be a smash hit, and old friend
  Hat (Yael Stone) has clocked that the story is based on secrets from their
  real lives. As a furious Hat tries to get the book pulled, a journalist is
  trying to track down the “anonymous” author. HR The Football Interview
  11.40pm, BBC One Defender Marc Guéhi, who may or may not still be a Crystal
  Palace player by the time this conversation airs, meets Kelly Somers. In
  addition to being a silky footballer, Guéhi is a thoughtful man – it will be
  interesting to hear the background to his decision to augment his rainbow
  armband with a religious message last season. Phil Harrison Film choice Shaft,
  11.30pm, BBC Two In one way, the lead character in Gordon Parks’s 1971 film is
  in a direct Hollywood lineage from Philip Marlowe and Sam Spade – a cynical
  private eye who plays both sides of the law but has a moral compass. However,
  that Richard Roundtree’s sexy, sardonic John Shaft is Black makes him
  groundbreaking – a representation of racial confidence rarely seen on screen
  before. This slick, funky movie doesn’t have any pretensions to high art,
  though, as Shaft is hired by a Harlem gangster to find his missing daughter,
  crossing fists with mobsters and militants. Simon Wardell Live sport Premier
  League Football: Man City v Tottenham, 11am, TNT Sport 1 Followed by Arsenal v
  Leeds at 5pm on Sky Sports Main Event. Women’s Rugby World Cup: Scotland v
  Wales, 2.15pm, BBC One In Salford. Ireland v Japan is on Sunday at 11.45am on
  BBC Two. Men’s Cycling: Vuelta a España, 3.15pm, TNT Sports 1 Stage one is in
  Italy – a route from Torino-Venaria Reale to Novara.
