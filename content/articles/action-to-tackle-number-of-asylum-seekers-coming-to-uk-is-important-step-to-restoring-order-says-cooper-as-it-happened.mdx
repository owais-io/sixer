  This live blog will be closing shortly. Thank you for reading the updates and
  commenting below the line. You can keep up to date with the Guardian’s UK
  politics coverage here. Here is a summary from today’s blog: The number of
  asylum seekers being housed in hotels has risen by 8% to 32,059 in a year,
  according to Home Office data. The figures come amid growing clamour from
  councils to block hotels being used to house asylum seekers through legal
  action, after a court ruled that more than 100 applicants staying in Essex
  should be removed. The latest Home Office figures, published on Thursday as
  part of the usual quarterly immigration statistics, cover Labour’s first year
  in office. For the first time in four years, the asylum applications backlog
  has fallen below 100,000 people. It is now just over 70,000 cases, relating to
  almost 91,000 people – down by 18% from a year earlier and its lowest since
  September 2021. The Refugee Council said it welcomed “initial progress” in
  reducing the asylum backlog but said there were still “far too many people in
  hotels. Everyone agrees that hotels are the wrong answer – they cost the
  taxpayer billions, trap people in limbo and are flashpoints in communities”.
  In the year ending June 2025, the Home Office forcibly removed 9,100 people –
  up a quarter on the previous year. More than half were foreign national
  offenders who were being deported at the end of sentences. The home secretary
  said the government’s action to tackle the number of asylum seekers coming to
  the UK had been an important step to “restoring order”. Responding to the new
  immigration statistics, Yvette Cooper said Labour had overseen increased
  numbers of returns of asylum seekers not granted asylum and pointed to the
  reduced spending on asylum. Kemi Badenoch has written to Conservative council
  leaders “encouraging” them to follow Epping Forest district council’s
  footsteps by launching bids to shut these hotels, if their “legal advice
  supports it”. Labour dismissed Badenoch’s letter as “desperate and
  hypocritical nonsense”, but several of its own local authorities have already
  suggested they too, could mount legal action against hotels in their areas.
  Charles Falconer, a Labour peer who served as justice secretary under Tony
  Blair and was previously Keir Starmer’s shadow attorney general, urged
  ministers to appeal against the court decision to close the Bell hotel in
  Epping. He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme the judgment “causes great
  problems” because it “gives rise to the expectation that some asylum hotels
  can be closed” but without indicating which ones. There has been an 80% drop
  in the number of visas granted for nurses over the past 12 months, according
  to Home Office figures. For work-related visas, 182,553 visas were granted in
  the year to June, which represents a 36% drop on the previous year. The
  government said the 80% fall in visas for nurses may be due to “the end of the
  centrally supported nurse international recruitment programme and changes in
  demand for international staff”. Responding to Thursday’s immigration figures
  showing a rise over the past year in the number of asylum seekers housed in
  hotels, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson Lisa Smart said the
  Conservatives had “trashed our immigration system and let numbers spiral”, but
  now “this Labour government is failing to get a grip on the crisis”. Nigel
  Farage responded to the Home Office figures by saying the public was right to
  be angry with the government and their predecessors over the rise in asylum
  seekers being housed in hotels by the government. People have “every right to
  engage in protest”, the shadow home secretary has said, amid concerns a high
  court ruling could trigger a wave of demonstrations outside asylum hotels.
  Chris Philp named three Conservative-led councils which are considering taking
  legal action against hoteliers whose property is being used to house asylum
  seekers. Philp said that the Conservatives were wrong to have used so many
  hotels to house asylum seekers while they were in government. Asked whether
  the number of hotels in use had been a mistake, Philp told the BBC Radio 4
  Today programme: “Yes it was. We wanted to get it down. And we did get it
  down. In the last nine months we halved the number of asylum hotels and had
  that trend continued by now there would be no asylum hotels.” The UK’s
  “broken” immigration system is spilling over into tensions in communities in
  Northern Ireland, a Stormont minister has said. Education minister Paul Givan
  made the comments as unionist politicians have asked for further
  investigations into the legal planning status of hotels in the region housing
  asylum seekers. The charity Safe Passage International has described the
  government as “working to shut down family reunion even further” due to its
  new scheme from France, part of the recent “one in, one out” deal, excluding
  unaccompanied children. Responding to Thursday’s Home Office figures, Donna
  Covey, chief executive at Safe Passage International said: “Over 5000 children
  have crossed the Channel in the year ending June 2025, over half of those
  children have had to make this dangerous journey alone.” The UK government
  borrowed less than expected in July, official figures show, in a boost to the
  chancellor, Rachel Reeves, as she faces pressure ahead of her autumn budget.
  Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed public sector net
  borrowing – the difference between public spending and income – fell to
  £1.1bn, down by £2.3bn from the same month a year earlier. Speaking on GCSE
  results day for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, education minister
  Catherine McKinnell said the government is “tackling” the barriers to better
  grades after she was asked why white working-class children are “doing so
  badly”. McKinnell said the question was a “really profound” one and that
  underachievement in that demographic “has persisted over many years”. There
  has been an overall rise in grades among 16-year-olds taking GCSEs and the gap
  between boys and girls has narrowed to its smallest level since 2016. Labour
  more than doubled their donations in 2024, according to newly published
  figures, but still made a loss after spending a record amount on the general
  election campaign. The party’s annual accounts for last year, which were
  published alongside those of every significant UK political party, show it
  managed to attract nearly £40m in donations last year, up from £16.5m in the
  previous year. But the party’s huge election spending sapped it of money,
  leading to an overall deficit of £3.8m. The Electoral Commission has
  previously reported Labour spent a record £30m on fighting the general
  election – ahead of the Conservatives, who spent £24m. The deputy prime
  minister, Angela Rayner, has been hit with a legal challenge after she
  overruled a local council to approve a hyperscale datacentre on green belt
  land by the M25 in Buckinghamshire. Campaigners bringing the action are
  complaining that no environmental impact assessment was made for the 90MW
  datacentre, which was approved as part of the Labour government’s push to turn
  the UK into an AI powerhouse by trebling computing capacity to meet rising
  demand amid what it terms “a global race” as AI usage takes off. England will
  sell off more than eight times as many council homes in 2025-26 as were
  constructed the previous year, research has found. Right to buy is depleting
  council housing stock more quickly than public housing can be replaced,
  forcing people to spend more money on private market rents and obtain less
  secure tenancies, a report from the thinktank Common Wealth finds. Stella
  Creasy and Richard Tice are pushing for Labour to allow a Brexit scrutiny
  committee to be formed in parliament, after the Guardian revealed
  environmental protections had been eroded since the UK left the EU. The Labour
  and Reform UK MPs argue that there is no scrutiny or accountability over how
  Brexit is being implemented. Creasy, the MP for Walthamstow and chair of the
  Labour Movement for Europe, said the UK needed a “salvage operation” to clear
  up the environmental and regulatory havoc caused by Brexit. The UK’s business
  activity posted its biggest growth in a year this month, led by a solid upturn
  in the service sector, according to a closely watched survey. The ‘flash’
  reading from the S&amp;P Global PMI survey showed improvement across the
  private sector, despite employment remaining a weak spot, with companies
  cutting hiring for an eleventh month. The number of young people not in
  education, employment or training (known as Neets) has increased, figures
  show. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said there was an increase in
  the number of Neets aged 16 to 24 in the three months to June to 948,000, up
  from 923,000 in January to March. Ireland’s premier and deputy premier have
  welcomed clarity on the EU-US trade deal, which sees the US commit to capping
  tariffs on pharma goods at 15%. Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the trade
  agreement represented a “significant win” for the EU while Tanaiste Simon
  Harris said it offered an “important shield” for Irish exporters. Construction
  work has begun on a “landmark” windfarm in the south of Scotland that will
  generate enough electricity to power about 335,000 homes. The Sanquhar II
  community windfarm will become the UK’s fourth largest onshore windfarm when
  it becomes operational in August 2026, according to developers CWP Energy. The
  SNP government has been accused of a “national scandal” after it was revealed
  that hundreds of NHS buildings are more than 70 years old. A Scottish Liberal
  Democrat freedom of information request to all of Scotland’s health boards
  found the NHS still relies on 597 buildings that were built seven decades ago.
  In December, it was reported that NHS Scotland’s maintenance backlog was more
  than £1.3bn. Retired women effectively go more than four months every year
  without getting a pension because of a gender gap, according to research by
  the Trades Union Congress (TUC). It estimated women were losing the equivalent
  of £7,600 a year on average. The union organisation said compared with men,
  retired women effectively stop receiving pension income from today. The
  government has revived the pension commission, which will bring together
  unions, employer and independent experts to look into the causes of the gap.
  England will sell off more than eight times as many council homes in 2025-26
  as were constructed the previous year, research has found. Right to buy is
  depleting council housing stock more quickly than public housing can be
  replaced, forcing people to spend more money on private market rents and
  obtain less secure tenancies, a report from the thinktank Common Wealth finds.
  Its analysis of government data in England found that 38,170 social homes and
  2,850 council homes were constructed by the government in 2023-24. In 2024-25,
  2,260 council homes were built. There were 13,966 sell-offs of council houses
  through right to buy in 2023-24 and 8,656 in 2024-25. It is estimated that
  18,500 council homes will be sold off in 2025-26 – more than eight times more
  than the number built in 2024-25. The report concludes that if the government
  wants to increase the supply of social rental housing quickly, it must invest
  in buying back and restoring homes sold off under right to buy, alongside more
  council housebuilding. Adam Peggs, the report’s author, said: We need to pull
  every effective lever we can find to expand public housing. Council housing
  gave people secure, low-cost homes in the past. With the right framework, it
  can give people high-quality, genuinely affordable homes, with real democratic
  voice in the future too. But we need to build the political will to make it
  happen. Every day of delay is another day families languish in squalid
  temporary accommodation. The government has the tools to turn this emergency
  around – and more quickly than they might admit – they just need to use them.
  The report, published on Thursday, also calls for expanded “right of first
  refusal” powers, enabling local authorities to be the preferred buyer when
  ex-social homes and private rental homes enter the market. Ireland’s premier
  and deputy premier have welcomed clarity on the EU-US trade deal, which sees
  the US commit to capping tariffs on pharma goods at 15%. Taoiseach Micheál
  Martin said the trade agreement represented a “significant win” for the EU
  while Tanaiste Simon Harris said it offered an “important shield” for Irish
  exporters. The EU struck a trade deal with the US on 27 July, five days before
  Donald Trump said a 30% tariff would kick in for the bloc. The deal sees 15%
  tariffs on most EU goods including cars, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals
  entering the US. There are “zero for zero” tariffs on a number of products
  including aircrafts and aircraft parts, some agricultural goods and certain
  chemicals – as well as EU purchases of US energy worth $750bn over three
  years. The PA news agency reports that in the aftermath of the deal, it was
  not clear whether 15% would remain the rate for the pharma sector or be
  increased. The EU-US statement published on Thursday said that as of 1
  September, the US will apply a maximum tariff rate of 15% on generic
  pharmaceuticals, their ingredients and chemical precursors. Irish premier
  Micheál Martin said the statement brought “greater clarity and certainty” to
  what the EU-US agreement would mean in practice. He said: This is especially
  important for enterprises that either import from or export to the US. Given
  the scale of the pharmaceutical and semiconductor sectors in Ireland, it is
  important that the joint statement confirms that 15% is a ceiling that will
  apply to EU exports in these areas in all circumstances, including when the
  current US section 232 investigations are concluded. While I have been clear
  all along that I do not support tariffs, this is a significant win for the EU.
  Given the significance of the airline sector to Ireland, a specific carve-out
  for aircraft and aircraft parts is also welcome. There are areas where further
  work remains to be done, including a potential carve-out for med-tech products
  and spirits. I hope this will be advanced as quickly as possible. We will
  continue to advocate for these sectors given their significant importance to
  our domestic economy. The deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, has been hit
  with a legal challenge after she overruled a local council to approve a
  hyperscale datacentre on green belt land by the M25 in Buckinghamshire.
  Campaigners bringing the action are complaining that no environmental impact
  assessment was made for the 90MW datacentre, which was approved as part of the
  Labour government’s push to turn the UK into an AI powerhouse by trebling
  computing capacity to meet rising demand amid what it terms “a global race” as
  AI usage takes off. The home counties datacentre is relatively small compared
  with one planned in north Lincolnshire that will have about 10 times the
  capacity, and is dwarfed by one planned by Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg in
  Louisiana, which will be more than 50 times larger as he seeks to achieve
  digital “superintelligence”. But Foxglove, the tech equity campaign group
  bringing the legal challenge alongside the environmental charity Global Action
  Plan, said the energy demand could push up local electricity prices and said
  it was “baffling” that the government had not carried out an environmental
  assessment. Oliver Hayes, the head of campaigns at Global Action Plan, said
  Rayner’s “lack of meaningful scrutiny” was a worrying signal as more
  datacentres were planned around the UK. “Are the societal benefits of chatbots
  and deepfakes really worth sacrificing progress towards a safe climate and
  dependable water supply?” he said. “The government must reconsider its rash
  decision or risk an embarrassing reality check in court.” An ageing
  population, a funding squeeze and a recruitment crisis have taken England’s
  adult social care system to breaking point. In this episode of Politics Weekly
  UK, recorded and first published in March, John Harris visited Greater
  Manchester to find out what a day in the life of a care worker looked like and
  whether it was too late to save this vital service: Stella Creasy and Richard
  Tice are pushing for Labour to allow a Brexit scrutiny committee to be formed
  in parliament, after the Guardian revealed environmental protections had been
  eroded since the UK left the EU. The Labour and Reform UK MPs argue that there
  is no scrutiny or accountability over how Brexit is being implemented. Creasy,
  the MP for Walthamstow and chair of the Labour Movement for Europe, said the
  UK needed a “salvage operation” to clear up the environmental and regulatory
  havoc caused by Brexit. The analysis by the Guardian and the Institute for
  European Environmental Policy (IEEP) has found that since Brexit the EU has
  brought forward 28 new, revised or upgraded pieces of environmental
  legislation that the UK has not adopted, and the UK has actively chosen to
  regress by changing four different pieces of legislation including on
  protected habitats, pesticides and fisheries. Creasy said the prime minister,
  Keir Starmer, needed to move more quickly to repair relations with the EU and
  realign on environmental law. “I am working with Richard Tice as well as other
  Brexit sceptics on restoring some sort of European scrutiny committee in
  parliament so we can decide if and when we want to diverge rather than it all
  being passive,” she said. Creasy said: We don’t have a body in parliament that
  knows both UK and EU law and can forge a way forward. This data from the
  Guardian and IEEP makes the case for having a scrutiny committee looking at if
  we diverge, and if we strengthen or weaken environmental protections. MPs
  aren’t scrutinising this at all at the moment; they don’t even know about
  what’s going on. One major issue is the planning and infrastructure bill,
  which overrides the EU’s habitats directive and allows rare habitats such as
  chalk streams to be destroyed if developers pay a nature restoration levy to
  government. Chris Hinchliff, the MP for North East Hertfordshire, had the
  Labour whip removed for proposing amendments to the bill, including one to
  protect chalk streams from harmful development. Creasy said she supported
  Hinchliff and that the UK should not be regressing from EU law. There has been
  an 80% drop in the number of visas granted for nurses over the past 12 months,
  according to Home Office figures. For work-related visas, 182,553 visas were
  granted in the year to June, which represents a 36% drop on the previous year.
  The government said the 80% fall in visas for nurses may be due to “the end of
  the centrally supported nurse international recruitment programme and changes
  in demand for international staff”. The UK’s “broken” immigration system is
  spilling over into tensions in communities in Northern Ireland, a Stormont
  minister has said. Education minister Paul Givan made the comments as unionist
  politicians have asked for further investigations into the legal planning
  status of hotels in the region housing asylum seekers. Earlier this week
  Antrim and Newtownabbey Council said an enforcement investigation has begun
  into the legal planning status of the Chimney Corner Hotel in Co Antrim being
  used to house asylum seekers. It comes after Epping Forest district council
  was granted a temporary injunction by the high court on Tuesday which blocks
  asylum seekers from being housed at the Bell hotel in the Essex town. Unionist
  politicians have further raised concerns about the status of hotels within the
  Causeway Coast and Glens and Ards and North Down borough council areas. An
  asylum seeker staying at a hotel that has been the flashpoint for anti-migrant
  protests has described being called a “scumbag” and treated like a criminal by
  local people. Dozens of residents of Epping’s Bell hotel face an uncertain
  future after a court ruled on Tuesday that it cannot be used to house asylum
  seekers because of a breach of planning rules. The verdict came after weeks of
  violent protests outside the hotel by far-right activists sparked when an
  asylum seeker resident was charged with sexually assaulting a 14-year-old
  girl. Khador Mohamed, 24, from Somalia, says residents were locked in their
  rooms during the protests. When they are allowed to venture outside they are
  insulted, he says. “People call you scumbags sometimes and they throw cans of
  soda at you.” He adds: “I wasn’t expecting this in England. I thought it would
  be friendlier.” Mohamed says local attitudes changed sharply after the charge
  against the resident. “Now we’re seen as criminals. Before that we were just
  normal people,” he said. He claims one woman shielded her children behind her
  when she saw Mohamed on the street. “It was a painful thing to happen to me –
  now we’re seen as rapist, paedophiles and thieves,” he says. He adds: “I am
  sorry for what happened, but there is nothing much I can do. We are not all
  the same.” The government is adding an extra year, and an extra £45m, to its
  scheme in England to help people find work, writes the Guardian’s senior
  economics correspondent, Richard Partington. You can read his feature on youth
  unemployment here: Labour more than doubled their donations in 2024, according
  to newly published figures, but still made a loss after spending a record
  amount on the general election campaign. The party’s annual accounts for last
  year, which were published alongside those of every significant UK political
  party, show it managed to attract nearly £40m in donations last year, up from
  £16.5m in the previous year. But the party’s huge election spending sapped it
  of money, leading to an overall deficit of £3.8m. The Electoral Commission has
  previously reported Labour spent a record £30m on fighting the general
  election – ahead of the Conservatives, who spent £24m. The Tories’ accounts
  meanwhile paint a bleak picture for the party, with donations having fallen by
  around a fifth last year, unusually for an election year. Reform in contrast
  saw their income rocket more than 800% as donations and membership fees
  flooded in. The party brought in £10.8mn in 2024, compared with £1.4mn in the
  previous year. The UK’s business activity posted its biggest growth in a year
  this month, led by a solid upturn in the service sector, according to a
  closely watched survey. The ‘flash’ reading from the S&amp;P Global PMI survey
  showed improvement across the private sector, despite employment remaining a
  weak spot, with companies cutting hiring for an eleventh month. The headline
  index rose to 53.0 in August from 51.5 in July, indicating faster expansion in
  business activity. Input cost inflation edged up to its highest since May.
  Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market
  Intelligence, said: The flash UK PMI survey for August indicated that the pace
  of economic growth has continued to accelerate over the summer after a
  sluggish spring, the rate of expansion now at a one-year high. The services
  sector has led the expansion, but manufacturing also showed further signs of
  stabilising. He cautioned that order books show that demand remains “uneven
  and fragile”. Companies report concerns over the impact of recent government
  policy changes, as well as unease emanating from broader geopolitical
  uncertainty. Goods exports are still falling especially sharply. Payroll
  numbers also continue to be cut at an aggressive rate by historical standards
  as firms cite weak order books and concerns over rising staff costs due to the
  policies announced in the autumn budget, which also contributed to persistent
  inflation pressures. While the rise in business activity signalled by the PMI
  alongside the uplift in inflation to 3.8% in July lower the chances of further
  rate cuts this year, more data are required to assess both the sustainability
  of robust economic growth as well as the stickiness of the upturn in price
  pressures. Among a divided Bank of England rate setting committee, the
  perceived need for any future rate cuts will be very much data dependent. The
  SNP government has been accused of a “national scandal” after it was revealed
  that hundreds of NHS buildings are more than 70 years old, reports the PA news
  agency. A Scottish Liberal Democrat freedom of information request to all of
  Scotland’s health boards found the NHS still relies on 597 buildings that were
  built seven decades ago. Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said:
  These figures show that the Scottish NHS is still relying on hundreds of
  buildings which are almost as old as the health service itself. While there
  will be many old buildings which have undergone the appropriate modernisation,
  the scale of the NHS’s maintenance backlog suggests that many of them have not
  kept pace with where health boards would like them to be. It is a national
  scandal that millions across the country are being treated in old and
  crumbling buildings that are no longer fit for purpose. The findings show 121
  of the buildings are located in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board
  area, where there are also 210 buildings up to 50 years old. In NHS Lothian,
  104 buildings are more than 70 years old, as are 97 in NHS Grampian and 93 in
  NHS Tayside. Across Scotland, there are also at least 18 buildings which are
  both more than 70 years old and require high-risk repairs. In December, it was
  reported that NHS Scotland’s maintenance backlog was more than £1.3bn, reports
  the PA news agency. In NHS Ayrshire and Arran, 30 buildings are more than 80
  years old – predating the founding of the NHS in 1948. Cole-Hamilton said: The
  SNP have constantly delayed and paused new building projects. In budget
  negotiations, Liberal Democrats secured commitments to advance the new
  Edinburgh eye hospital, as well as replacements for the Belford hospital in
  Fort William and the Gilbert Bain in Shetland. But there are many more
  projects like these which have been neglected by the SNP for too long. Making
  sure people can get swift access to local health care in safe buildings should
  be a top priority for every political party. That’s what you get with the
  Scottish Liberal Democrats. I don’t believe the SNP can say the same. A
  Scottish government spokesperson said: We are providing £139m additional
  investment this year in NHS infrastructure to increase core capital funding
  for boards and support priority improvements and replacements in Scotland’s
  NHS estate. Historic real-terms cuts to our block grant from the UK government
  have put pressure on our capital budget, but despite this we have delivered
  various new healthcare facilities across the country. This includes new
  national treatment centres in Fife, Highland and at the Golden Jubilee, as
  well as new community hospitals in Aviemore and Skye. We are already working
  with all health boards to develop a whole-system NHS infrastructure plan which
  will meet the needs of the NHS across the whole of Scotland, supporting
  continued safe operation of existing facilities and informing longer-term
  investment priorities. Pupils in England who were thought to have been among
  the worst affected by Covid have bounced back in their GCSE results with more
  achieving top grades despite the disruption of the pandemic. There had been
  fears that this cohort, who were in the final year of primary when the
  pandemic hit in 2020, cancelling their key stage 2 tests and disrupting their
  transition to secondary school, would be severely impacted going forward in
  their education. However, the results published on Thursday showed 23% of
  entries for English 16-year-olds were awarded grades 7 or above, up from 22.6%
  last year, with boys improving their performance, though a higher proportion
  of girls continue to achieve top grades overall. For pupils in Northern
  Ireland, the proportion getting grades 7 and above rose by a full percentage
  point to 31.4%, while the percentage getting grades 4 or above went up to
  63.8%. In Wales, pupils getting the top three grades rose to 20.1%, up from
  19.8% in 2024, and those getting a 4 or better edged up by 0.3 percentage
  points to 63.8% this year. Jill Duffy, the chair of Joint Council for
  Qualifications board of directors and chief executive of the OCR exam board,
  paid tribute to pupils’ resilience: Looking at these results, it is hard not
  to be impressed by students’ breadth of skills and knowledge. These students
  have shown resilience and determination throughout their school years; they
  now have the chance to thrive in their next endeavours, whether that is in
  education, training or apprenticeships. Responding to this morning’s
  immigration figures showing a rise over the past year in the number of asylum
  seekers housed in hotels, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson Lisa
  Smart said: The asylum backlog has been far too large for far too long. The
  Conservatives trashed our immigration system and let numbers spiral. Now this
  Labour government is failing to get a grip on the crisis. The government
  urgently needs to stop dangerous Channel crossings and speed up asylum
  processing to bring down the backlog and end hotel use once and for all. Nigel
  Farage said the public is right to be angry with the government and their
  predecessors over the rise in asylum seekers being housed in hotels by the
  government, reports the PA news agency. Responding today’s Home Office
  figures, the Reform UK leader said: Under Labour we now have record numbers
  claiming asylum. The vast majority should never qualify and most will cost the
  taxpayer a huge sum of money. Our streets are becoming more dangerous yet this
  disaster gets worse. The public are right to be very angry with both Labour
  and the Tories for what they have done to us. The charity Safe Passage
  International has described the government as “working to shut down family
  reunion even further” due to its new scheme from France, part of the recent
  “one in, one out” deal, excluding unaccompanied children. Responding to
  today’s Home Office figures, Donna Covey, chief executive at Safe Passage
  International said: Over 5000 children have crossed the Channel in the year
  ending June 2025, over half of those children have had to make this dangerous
  journey alone. We work with unaccompanied children in Northern France who are
  simply trying to reach family, often the only family they have left. But with
  the UK’s limited family reunion rules, and a long, arduous process, they often
  turn to smugglers, at risk of exploitation, to reach family in the UK. This
  government says it’s aiming to stop Channel crossing yet it’s working to shut
  down family reunion even further, which will only push more refugee families
  into taking dangerous journeys to reunite in safety. The new scheme from
  France, part of the recent ‘one in, one out’ deal, offers a limited pathway
  for a few refugees in France, but it excludes unaccompanied children. The
  government must urgently rectify this, so children who have fled war and
  persecution, and are alone without family to care for them, can reach
  protection in the UK safely. The best way to save lives in the Channel, stop
  the smugglers trade and protect refugees is to open safe routes. The home
  secretary has said the government’s action to tackle the number of asylum
  seekers coming to the UK had been an important step to “restoring order”.
  Responding to new immigration statistics, Yvette Cooper said Labour had
  overseen increased numbers of returns of asylum seekers not granted asylum and
  pointed to the reduced spending on asylum. According to the PA news agency,
  Cooper said: We inherited a broken immigration and asylum system that the
  previous government left in chaos. Since coming to office we have strengthened
  Britain’s visa and immigration controls, cut asylum costs and sharply
  increased enforcement and returns, as today’s figures show. The action we have
  taken in the last 12 months – increasing returns of failed asylum seekers by
  over 30%, cutting asylum costs by 11%, reducing the backlog by 18% and our
  forthcoming plans to overhaul the failing asylum appeal system – are crucial
  steps to restoring order and putting an end to the chaotic use of asylum
  hotels that we inherited from the previous government. At the same time, we
  are bringing legal migration back under control, with a 48% reduction in work
  visas this year – and further stronger visa controls and higher skill
  requirements introduced through our white paper expected to bring those
  overall numbers down further. As we roll out further reforms, including the
  new pilot with France, new counter terror powers to strengthen border security
  and new asylum reforms later this year (including reforms to speed up the
  persistent delays in the appeals system), we will continue to take the serious
  steps required to restore order, control and fairness to the system, and to
  continue building the foundations of a new and stronger approach. Figures
  published by the Home Office on Thursday showed that the number of quarterly
  enforced returns of people who do not have a right to stay in the UK rose
  slightly from 2,314 in January-March 2025 to 2,323 in April-June 2025. A total
  of 9,072 enforced returns took place in the year to June, up 25% from 7,253 in
  the previous year and the highest figure for a 12-month period since the year
  to December 2018 (9,236). The Home Office is responsible for returning people
  to their country of origin if they do not have a legal right to remain in the
  UK. There are three types of returns: enforced returns, which are carried out
  directly by the Home Office; voluntary returns, who are people who were facing
  deportation but left of their own accord, sometimes with support from the Home
  Office; and port returns, who are people refused entry to the UK and who have
  subsequently departed. The Refugee Council said it welcomed “initial progress”
  in reducing the asylum backlog. Responding to the government’s quarterly
  asylum and immigration statistics released today, the refugee charity said the
  data “show[ed] mixed progress in the first year against the government’s
  manifesto pledge to ‘restore order to the asylum system so that it operates
  swiftly, firmly, and fairly’”. The charity noted that for the first time in
  four years, the asylum applications backlog fell below 100,000 people. It now
  stands at just over 70,000 cases, relating to almost 91,000 people – down by
  18% from a year earlier and its lowest since September 2021, it added. Enver
  Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: Bringing the asylum
  system back from the brink of collapse is a genuine achievement in the
  government’s first year. The increase in asylum decisions means refugees can
  begin to rebuild their lives sooner, and the use of costly hotels can be ended
  faster. However, this good work is being put at risk by poor-quality decisions
  – right now nearly half of appeals are successful. These mistakes have
  life-changing consequences for the people we work with, who have fled
  persecution in countries like Sudan and Afghanistan. There’s also still far
  too many people in hotels. Everyone agrees that hotels are the wrong answer –
  they cost the taxpayer billions, trap people in limbo and are flashpoints in
  communities. Getting decisions right first time is vital so refugees who need
  protection can move out of hotels and start rebuilding in safety, while those
  who don’t have the right to stay can return with dignity and respect.
  Alongside faster, better decisions we also need safe and legal routes, so
  people escaping conflict can reach the UK without taking dangerous journeys.
  Schemes for Ukraine, Syria and Afghanistan have shown what’s possible; that
  same lifeline must now be extended to others. Construction work has begun on a
  “landmark” windfarm in the south of Scotland that will generate enough
  electricity to power about 335,000 homes. The Sanquhar II community windfarm
  will become the UK’s fourth largest onshore windfarm when it becomes
  operational in August 2026, according to developers CWP Energy. The 44-turbine
  farm, which is being built in Dumfries and Galloway and east Ayrshire, will
  create more than £800m in local investment over its 40-year operational life.
  It is also expected to generate hundreds of jobs during the building phase,
  with the company saying “almost 50%” of the workforce will be sourced locally.
  The development was paused in 2023 over “tax decisions” by the previous UK
  government, but the company said it was made possible last month by the
  current UK government dropping its plans for “zonal energy pricing”. According
  to the PA news agency, Rod Wood, director of CWP Energy, said: Onshore wind is
  one of the cheapest forms of homegrown electricity, delivering consumers and
  businesses excellent value for money. We’re delighted that after nearly 10
  years of careful planning, ground has been broken and the construction of
  Sanquhar II is now under way. The project brings with it an investment of an
  immediate £400m into the Scottish economy, creating long-term jobs, and paying
  local authority rates, taxes and community benefits. We’re grateful to the
  Scottish government for backing Sanquhar II and to the UK government for
  creating confidence in the renewables sector. James Ian Robinson, senior sales
  director for the UK and Ireland at Vestas, which is providing the project’s
  EnVentus platforms and V162 turbines, described it as an “important step”
  towards greater UK energy security: Construction is now under way on what will
  become the UK’s fourth largest onshore wind project, and we’re honoured to
  contribute to this landmark development. Sanquhar II marks another important
  step toward greater energy security through homegrown power generation in the
  UK. CWP Energy said the farm, which has been nearly 10 years in the planning,
  will offset 540,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide every year. Scottish secretary
  Ian Murray said he welcomed the development, which he said “demonstrates
  Scotland’s vital role in delivering the UK government’s clean power mission”.
  He added: Reformed national pricing will ensure the benefits of clean power
  are felt by communities and consumers in every part of the country, while
  giving businesses the stability and certainty they need to continue investing
  to upgrade our infrastructure to boost our national energy security, helping
  to create thousands of skilled jobs, and boosting the economy. Huw Jones,
  chair of Jones Bros Civil Engineering UK, set out the positive impact the
  construction phase of the development will have on the local economy.
  “Currently on site, we are averaging 100 personnel per day, with the
  expectation for this to rise to 200,” he said, adding: We are utilising local
  contractors and suppliers where we can, and almost 50% of our workforce are
  from the local area, with many others utilising the accommodation facilities
  within the surrounding towns and villages. The number of young people not in
  education, employment or training (known as Neets) has increased, figures
  show. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said there was an increase in
  the number of Neets aged 16 to 24 in the three months to June to 948,000, up
  from 923,000 in January to March. The PA news agency reports that TUC general
  secretary Paul Nowak said: This is yet another toxic Tory legacy this
  government has to fix. Under the Conservatives, too many were failed with
  hundreds of thousands of young people stuck out of work, education or
  training. This has damaging consequences for young people’s prospects – and
  for the country as a whole too. With the youth guarantee, stronger employment
  rights, an industrial strategy and apprenticeship reforms, the government has
  made a positive start in turning this around. Iona Ledwidge, chief executive
  of youth charity Resurgo, said: These new figures represent a growing mountain
  of untapped talent and are a clear signal that the government needs to speed
  up its work to support young people into work or education. More than half of
  these young people have never had a job. Joblessness is a bottomless pit – the
  further you go into it, the harder it is to climb out. But we’ve seen
  thousands climb out and thrive. Sustained, tailored coaching in the right
  skills is the ladder. Despite a good month for the public finances, the
  Treasury won’t be putting in any champagne orders, writes the Guardian’s
  senior economics writer, Phillip Inman. You can read his analysis, on why
  radical tax reform may be only way for chancellor Rachel Reeves to balance the
  books, at the link below: Retired women effectively go more than four months
  every year without getting a pension because of a gender gap, according to
  research by the Trades Union Congress (TUC). The PA news agency reports that
  the TUC estimated women were losing the equivalent of £7,600 a year on
  average. The union organisation said compared with men, retired women
  effectively stop receiving pension income from today. The income gap between
  men and women in retirement is now 36.5%, according to research from the
  Prospect union. The government has revived the pension commission, which will
  bring together unions, employer and independent experts to look into the
  causes of the gap. TUC general secretary Paul Nowak said: Everyone deserves
  dignity and security in retirement, but too many retired women have been left
  without enough to get by. We must make sure that these inequalities are
  addressed for future generations. That’s why reviving the pensions commission
  – bringing together unions, employers and independent experts – is a vital
  step forward. We now have a chance to make sure everyone, including women,
  receive the decent retirement income that all workers need. A government
  spokesperson said: We’re determined to close the gender pensions gap, and the
  new state pension has already reduced historic inequalities faced by women and
  low earners. Alongside this, the pensions commission will tackle barriers to
  close the gender pensions gap in private pensions to ensure women have the
  dignity and security they deserve in retirement. Minister Catherine McKinnell
  has said it is “really important” to manage asylum accommodation while also
  speeding up the claims process. The education minister told Sky News this
  morning, before Thursday’s Home Office data release: We inherited a terrible
  mess from the last government when it comes to the immigration system and
  particularly the processing of asylum claims – massive backlog. She added: [I]
  absolutely recognise the concerns that local communities have and we want to
  work with local communities to find solutions. Pressed on the speed of
  government efforts to close asylum hotels, McKinnell said: What we’ve done is
  doubled the number of asylum claims that have been processed. So, that is
  reducing the number of people who are requiring this accommodation, but also
  returning people that shouldn’t be here. We’re also committed to ending the
  use of asylum hotels by the end of this parliament. So, it will take some time
  to clean up the situation that we’ve inherited, but, you know, it’s really
  important that we continue to both manage the accommodation that people are
  currently in and also speed up the process. The backlogs are totally
  unacceptable, not only for the amount of time that people are wasting, but
  that people are just not being returned that shouldn’t be here as well. People
  have “every right to engage in protest”, the shadow home secretary has said,
  amid concerns a high court ruling could trigger a wave of demonstrations
  outside asylum hotels. Chris Philp named three Conservative-led councils which
  are considering taking legal action against hoteliers whose property is being
  used to house asylum seekers. His party’s leader Kemi Badenoch has written to
  Conservative council leaders “encouraging” them to follow Epping Forest
  district council’s footsteps by launching bids to shut these hotels, if their
  “legal advice supports it”. Philp told BBC Breakfast on Thursday that Borough
  of Broxbourne council in Hertfordshire, Reigate and Banstead borough council
  in Surrey, and Hillingdon council in London were each considering taking
  similar legal action. “So, I think there are many up and down the country who
  are looking at this following the Epping ruling,” he said. Philp added: I
  think these councils are, you know, sick and tired of having these asylum
  hotels housing predominantly young men who entered the country illegally in
  their communities. They want to see them closing down and that is why I think
  they’re rightly looking at legal action. According to the PA news agency, when
  asked whether there was a “risk” the high court’s decision “will encourage
  more protests and problems in communities outside these hotels”, Philp told
  BBC Breakfast: People are understandably angry about the government, the
  Labour government’s failings, the border crisis they’re presiding over. They
  do have the right to peacefully protest – I do stress the word ‘peacefully’.
  Peaceful protest is lawful, it is every citizen’s right to do that. Of course,
  if it isn’t peaceful, that is wrong and that should be dealt with by the
  police, but where protest is peaceful, people have every right to engage in
  protest. He had earlier claimed that “reporting says hundreds of charges have
  been laid against illegal immigrants being accommodated in these hotels”. A
  total of 32,059 asylum seekers were being housed temporarily in UK hotels at
  the end of Labour’s first year in government, up 8% on the same point 12
  months ago, Home Office data released today shows, reports the PA news agency.
  The latest data, published on Thursday as part of the usual quarterly
  immigration statistics, cover Labour’s first year in office. They show the
  number of asylum seekers in UK hotels by the end of June was up from 29,585 at
  the same point a year earlier, when the Conservatives were still in power but
  down slightly on the 32,345 figure at the end of March. The latest number is
  still below the peak of 56,042 asylum seekers in hotels at the end of
  September 2023 under the Tories. Figures for hotels published by the Home
  Office on Thursday date back to December 2022. Government spending on asylum
  in the UK stood at £4.76bn in 2024/25, down 12% from a record £5.38bn in
  2023/24. The total covers all Home Office costs related to asylum, including
  direct cash support and accommodation, plus wider staffing and other migration
  and borders activity. It does not include costs relating to the interception
  of migrants who travel to the UK across the English Channel in small boats.
  The UK government borrowed less than expected in July, official figures show,
  in a boost to the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, as she faces pressure ahead of
  her autumn budget. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS)
  showed public sector net borrowing – the difference between public spending
  and income – fell to £1.1bn, down by £2.3bn from the same month a year
  earlier. The reading was below City predictions for a deficit of £2.6bn and
  forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) of £2.1bn. Borrowing
  over the first four months of the financial year so far was £60bn. While
  matching the OBR’s forecasts, it was £6.7bn higher than in the same period a
  year earlier, and the third highest April-to-July borrowing since monthly
  records began. Despite the better-than-expected July figure, economists warned
  the chancellor would still face a tough autumn budget because the OBR was
  likely to slash its growth forecasts for the UK economy, while Labour’s
  welfare U-turns would add to borrowing. Alex Kerr, UK economist at the
  consultancy Capital Economics, said Reeves would probably need to raise
  between £17bn and £27bn to maintain headroom of £9.9bn against her
  self-imposed fiscal rules. “Ultimately, today’s release does little to
  brighten the gloomy outlook ahead of the budget later this year,” he said.
  Ministers are understood to be exploring options to raise more money from
  inheritances and property taxation, the Guardian has revealed. Earlier this
  month the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) thinktank
  warned the shortfall in the public finances could reach more than £40bn.
  Martin Beck, chief economist at WPI Strategy, said the latest figures would
  offer Reeves some relief. “Talk of a huge ‘black hole’ in the public finances
  is looking overstated, but the outlook is still uncomfortably tight,” he said.
  Charles Falconer, a Labour peer who served as justice secretary under Tony
  Blair and was previously Keir Starmer’s shadow attorney general, urged
  ministers to appeal against the court decision to close the asylum hotel in
  Epping. He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme the judgment “causes great
  problems” because it “gives rise to the expectation that some asylum hotels
  can be closed” but without indicating which ones. He said: I very strongly
  urge the government – I don’t know what they’re going to do – to appeal and
  get some certainty, first of all on which should be closed … and which
  shouldn’t. Secondly, to deal with the question of a reasonable timescale in
  relation to this, and thirdly, to deal with this very troublesome issue:
  namely do demonstrations outside these hostels lead it to it being more likely
  that they will be closed? Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said that
  the Conservatives were wrong to have used so many hotels to house asylum
  seekers while they were in government. Asked whether the number of hotels in
  use had been a mistake, Philp told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: Yes it
  was. We wanted to get it down. And we did get it down. In the last nine months
  we halved the number of asylum hotels and had that trend continued by now
  there would be no asylum hotels. Catherine McKinell, an education minister,
  said the government was committed to ending the use of asylum hotels by the
  end of this parliament. Asked where asylum seekers would be housed instead,
  she told Times Radio: That’s a big question. And one that I think we need to
  work very closely with local authorities and local communities to tackle.
  Education minister Catherine McKinnell has said the government is “tackling”
  the barriers to better grades after she was asked why white working-class
  children are “doing so badly”, reports the PA news agency. McKinnell said the
  question was a “really profound” one and that underachievement in that
  demographic “has persisted over many years”. She told Times Radio: We’ve seen
  there have been some improvements in our school system in the last decade,
  there have been over 30 years improvements in our school system. But this
  challenge has persisted, which is why we are very focused on tackling child
  poverty in the early years. We’re extending free school meals to [an]
  additional half a million children. We’re investing in free breakfast clubs to
  make sure that children get that really good start to the day, both from a
  socialised perspective, but also food. So, we are tackling what we see are the
  barriers that are holding young people back, and also making sure that they
  want to be in school as well. Students receiving their GCSE results in
  England, Wales and Northern Ireland on Thursday will have “support available”,
  McKinell added. McKinnell told Times Radio: I think whatever the outcome for
  these young people, they have worked incredibly hard, as have the schools, as
  have the teachers. So, it really is a day to recognise that and to celebrate,
  and also to mark how important it is that this is a springboard into whatever
  comes next. So, for young people who are awaiting their results, whatever the
  outcome, there’ll be support available, whether it’s to go on to an
  apprenticeship, to A-levels, to T-levels, to vocational qualifications. It’s a
  very exciting day for an awful lot of young people, their families and their
  schools. You can keep up to date with the latest via the Guardian’s GCSE
  results live blog: Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick has echoed Kemi
  Badenoch’s views, saying the country is “in a mess”. He told the Daily
  Express: Every patriotic council, whether Conservative, Reform, whatever,
  should follow Epping’s lead and seek an injunction. Tuesday’s high court
  decision has also caused a potential headache for the Home Office, which has a
  legal duty to house destitute asylum seekers while their claims are being
  dealt with. If planning laws prevent the government from using hotels,
  ministers will face a scramble to find alternative accommodation, potentially
  in the private rented sector. Kemi Badenoch has called for more Conservative
  councils to launch legal challenges over hotels housing asylum seekers as the
  government faces a potential revolt from its own local authorities. In a
  letter to Tory councils, Badenoch said she was “encouraging” them to “take the
  same steps” as Epping council “if your legal advice supports it”, reports the
  PA news agency. Epping secured a temporary injunction from the high court on
  Tuesday, blocking the use of the Essex town’s Bell hotel as accommodation for
  asylum seekers on planning grounds. Labour dismissed Badenoch’s letter as
  “desperate and hypocritical nonsense”, but several of its own local
  authorities have already suggested they too, could mount legal action against
  hotels in their areas. The decision has prompted councils controlled by
  Labour, the Conservatives and Reform UK to investigate whether they could
  pursue a similar course of action. These include Labour-run Tamworth and
  Wirral councils, Tory-run Broxbourne and East Lindsey councils and Reform’s
  Staffordshire and West Northamptonshire councils. Patrick Harley, the leader
  of Conservative-run Dudley council, told the Daily Mail it was looking at
  taking legal action, a verdict echoed by Richard Biggs, the Tory leader of
  Reigate and Banstead council. But Labour’s Newcastle city council and Brighton
  and Hove city council have both ruled out legal action. In her letter,
  Badenoch praised Epping council’s legal challenge and told Tory councils she
  would “back you to take similar action to protect your community”. But she
  added that the situation would “depend on individual circumstances of the
  case” and suggested Tory councils could pursue “other planning enforcement
  options”. Badenoch also accused Labour of “trying to ram through such asylum
  hotels without consultation and proper process”, saying the government had
  reopened the Bell hotel as asylum accommodation after the Conservatives had
  closed it. The hotel had previously been used as asylum accommodation briefly
  in 2020 and then between 2022 and 2024 under the previous Conservative
  government. According to the PA news agency, a Labour spokesperson said
  Badenoch’s letter was a “pathetic stunt” and “desperate and hypocritical
  nonsense from the architects of the broken asylum system”, saying there were
  now “20,000 fewer asylum seekers in hotels than at their peak under the
  Tories”. The letter comes ahead of the publication on Thursday of figures
  showing how many asylum seekers were being temporarily housed in hotels at the
  end of June this year. We’ll have more on this soon. Meanwhile, students in
  England, Wales and Northern Ireland will receive their GCSE results today.
  Education minister Catherine McKinnell is on the morning media rounds for the
  government, while the shadow home secretary, Chris Philp is doing the same for
  the Conservatives. In other developments: The UK government borrowed less than
  expected in July, official figures show, in a boost to the chancellor, Rachel
  Reeves, as she faces pressure ahead of her autumn budget. Figures from the
  Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed public sector net borrowing – the
  difference between public spending and income – fell to £1.1bn, down by £2.3bn
  from the same month a year earlier. Stella Creasy and Richard Tice are pushing
  for Labour to allow a Brexit scrutiny committee to be formed in parliament,
  after the Guardian revealed environmental protections had been eroded since
  the UK left the EU. The Labour and Reform UK MPs argue that there is no
  scrutiny or accountability over how Brexit is being implemented. The deputy
  prime minister, Angela Rayner, has been hit with a legal challenge after she
  overruled a local council to approve a hyperscale datacentre on green belt
  land by the M25 in Buckinghamshire. Campaigners bringing the action are
  complaining that no environmental impact assessment was made for the 90MW
  datacentre, which was approved as part of the Labour government’s push to turn
  the UK into an AI powerhouse by trebling computing capacity to meet rising
  demand amid what it terms “a global race” as AI usage takes off. England will
  sell off more than eight times as many council homes in 2025-26 as were
  constructed the previous year, research has found. Right to buy is depleting
  council housing stock more quickly than public housing can be replaced,
  forcing people to spend more money on private market rents and obtain less
  secure tenancies, a report from the thinktank Common Wealth finds.

This live blog will be closing shortly. Thank you for reading the updates and commenting below the line. You can keep up to date with the Guardian’s UK politics coverage here. Here is a summary from today’s blog: The number of asylum seekers being housed in hotels has risen by 8% to 32,059 in a year, according to Home Office data. The figures come amid growing clamour from councils to block hotels being used to house asylum seekers through legal action, after a court ruled that more than 100 applicants staying in Essex should be removed. The latest Home Office figures, published on Thursday as part of the usual quarterly immigration statistics, cover Labour’s first year in office. For the first time in four years, the asylum applications backlog has fallen below 100,000 people. It is now just over 70,000 cases, relating to almost 91,000 people – down by 18% from a year earlier and its lowest since September 2021. The Refugee Council said it welcomed “initial progress” in reducing the asylum backlog but said there were still “far too many people in hotels. Everyone agrees that hotels are the wrong answer – they cost the taxpayer billions, trap people in limbo and are flashpoints in communities”. In the year ending June 2025, the Home Office forcibly removed 9,100 people – up a quarter on the previous year. More than half were foreign national offenders who were being deported at the end of sentences. The home secretary said the government’s action to tackle the number of asylum seekers coming to the UK had been an important step to “restoring order”. Responding to the new immigration statistics, Yvette Cooper said Labour had overseen increased numbers of returns of asylum seekers not granted asylum and pointed to the reduced spending on asylum. Kemi Badenoch has written to Conservative council leaders “encouraging” them to follow Epping Forest district council’s footsteps by launching bids to shut these hotels, if their “legal advice supports it”. Labour dismissed Badenoch’s letter as “desperate and hypocritical nonsense”, but several of its own local authorities have already suggested they too, could mount legal action against hotels in their areas. Charles Falconer, a Labour peer who served as justice secretary under Tony Blair and was previously Keir Starmer’s shadow attorney general, urged ministers to appeal against the court decision to close the Bell hotel in Epping. He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme the judgment “causes great problems” because it “gives rise to the expectation that some asylum hotels can be closed” but without indicating which ones. There has been an 80% drop in the number of visas granted for nurses over the past 12 months, according to Home Office figures. For work-related visas, 182,553 visas were granted in the year to June, which represents a 36% drop on the previous year. The government said the 80% fall in visas for nurses may be due to “the end of the centrally supported nurse international recruitment programme and changes in demand for international staff”. Responding to Thursday’s immigration figures showing a rise over the past year in the number of asylum seekers housed in hotels, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson Lisa Smart said the Conservatives had “trashed our immigration system and let numbers spiral”, but now “this Labour government is failing to get a grip on the crisis”. Nigel Farage responded to the Home Office figures by saying the public was right to be angry with the government and their predecessors over the rise in asylum seekers being housed in hotels by the government. People have “every right to engage in protest”, the shadow home secretary has said, amid concerns a high court ruling could trigger a wave of demonstrations outside asylum hotels. Chris Philp named three Conservative-led councils which are considering taking legal action against hoteliers whose property is being used to house asylum seekers. Philp said that the Conservatives were wrong to have used so many hotels to house asylum seekers while they were in government. Asked whether the number of hotels in use had been a mistake, Philp told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: “Yes it was. We wanted to get it down. And we did get it down. In the last nine months we halved the number of asylum hotels and had that trend continued by now there would be no asylum hotels.” The UK’s “broken” immigration system is spilling over into tensions in communities in Northern Ireland, a Stormont minister has said. Education minister Paul Givan made the comments as unionist politicians have asked for further investigations into the legal planning status of hotels in the region housing asylum seekers. The charity Safe Passage International has described the government as “working to shut down family reunion even further” due to its new scheme from France, part of the recent “one in, one out” deal, excluding unaccompanied children. Responding to Thursday’s Home Office figures, Donna Covey, chief executive at Safe Passage International said: “Over 5000 children have crossed the Channel in the year ending June 2025, over half of those children have had to make this dangerous journey alone.” The UK government borrowed less than expected in July, official figures show, in a boost to the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, as she faces pressure ahead of her autumn budget. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed public sector net borrowing – the difference between public spending and income – fell to £1.1bn, down by £2.3bn from the same month a year earlier. Speaking on GCSE results day for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, education minister Catherine McKinnell said the government is “tackling” the barriers to better grades after she was asked why white working-class children are “doing so badly”. McKinnell said the question was a “really profound” one and that underachievement in that demographic “has persisted over many years”. There has been an overall rise in grades among 16-year-olds taking GCSEs and the gap between boys and girls has narrowed to its smallest level since 2016. Labour more than doubled their donations in 2024, according to newly published figures, but still made a loss after spending a record amount on the general election campaign. The party’s annual accounts for last year, which were published alongside those of every significant UK political party, show it managed to attract nearly £40m in donations last year, up from £16.5m in the previous year. But the party’s huge election spending sapped it of money, leading to an overall deficit of £3.8m. The Electoral Commission has previously reported Labour spent a record £30m on fighting the general election – ahead of the Conservatives, who spent £24m. The deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, has been hit with a legal challenge after she overruled a local council to approve a hyperscale datacentre on green belt land by the M25 in Buckinghamshire. Campaigners bringing the action are complaining that no environmental impact assessment was made for the 90MW datacentre, which was approved as part of the Labour government’s push to turn the UK into an AI powerhouse by trebling computing capacity to meet rising demand amid what it terms “a global race” as AI usage takes off.

Stella Creasy and Richard Tice are pushing for Labour to allow a Brexit scrutiny committee to be formed in parliament, after the Guardian revealed environmental protections had been eroded since the UK left the EU. The Labour and Reform UK MPs argue that there is no scrutiny or accountability over how Brexit is being implemented. Creasy, the MP for Walthamstow and chair of the Labour Movement for Europe, said the UK needed a “salvage operation” to clear up the environmental and regulatory havoc caused by Brexit. The UK’s business activity posted its biggest growth in a year this month, led by a solid upturn in the service sector, according to a closely watched survey. The ‘flash’ reading from the S&amp;P Global PMI survey showed improvement across the private sector, despite employment remaining a weak spot, with companies cutting hiring for an eleventh month. The number of young people not in education, employment or training (known as Neets) has increased, figures show. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said there was an increase in the number of Neets aged 16 to 24 in the three months to June to 948,000, up from 923,000 in January to March. Ireland’s premier and deputy premier have welcomed clarity on the EU-US trade deal, which sees the US commit to capping tariffs on pharma goods at 15%. Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the trade agreement represented a “significant win” for the EU while Tanaiste Simon Harris said it offered an “important shield” for Irish exporters. Construction work has begun on a “landmark” windfarm in the south of Scotland that will generate enough electricity to power about 335,000 homes. The Sanquhar II community windfarm will become the UK’s fourth largest onshore windfarm when it becomes operational in August 2026, according to developers CWP Energy. The SNP government has been accused of a “national scandal” after it was revealed that hundreds of NHS buildings are more than 70 years old. A Scottish Liberal Democrat freedom of information request to all of Scotland’s health boards found the NHS still relies on 597 buildings that were built seven decades ago. In December, it was reported that NHS Scotland’s maintenance backlog was more than £1.3bn. Retired women effectively go more than four months every year without getting a pension because of a gender gap, according to research by the Trades Union Congress (TUC). It estimated women were losing the equivalent of £7,600 a year on average. The union organisation said compared with men, retired women effectively stop receiving pension income from today. The government has revived the pension commission, which will bring together unions, employer and independent experts to look into the causes of the gap. England will sell off more than eight times as many council homes in 2025-26 as were constructed the previous year, research has found. Right to buy is depleting council housing stock more quickly than public housing can be replaced, forcing people to spend more money on private market rents and obtain less secure tenancies, a report from the thinktank Common Wealth finds. Its analysis of government data in England found that 38,170 social homes and 2,850 council homes were constructed by the government in 2023-24. In 2024-25, 2,260 council homes were built. There were 13,966 sell-offs of council houses through right to buy in 2023-24 and 8,656 in 2024-25. It is estimated that 18,500 council homes will be sold off in 2025-26 – more than eight times more than the number built in 2024-25. The report concludes that if the government wants to increase the supply of social rental housing quickly, it must invest in buying back and restoring homes sold off under right to buy, alongside more council housebuilding. Adam Peggs, the report’s author, said: We need to pull every effective lever we can find to expand public housing. Council housing gave people secure, low-cost homes in the past. With the right framework, it can give people high-quality, genuinely affordable homes, with real democratic voice in the future too. But we need to build the political will to make it happen. Every day of delay is another day families languish in squalid temporary accommodation. The government has the tools to turn this emergency around – and more quickly than they might admit – they just need to use them. The report, published on Thursday, also calls for expanded “right of first refusal” powers, enabling local authorities to be the preferred buyer when ex-social homes and private rental homes enter the market. Ireland’s premier and deputy premier have welcomed clarity on the EU-US trade deal, which sees the US commit to capping tariffs on pharma goods at 15%. Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the trade agreement represented a “significant win” for the EU while Tanaiste Simon Harris said it offered an “important shield” for Irish exporters. The EU struck a trade deal with the US on 27 July, five days before Donald Trump said a 30% tariff would kick in for the bloc. The deal sees 15% tariffs on most EU goods including cars, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals entering the US. There are “zero for zero” tariffs on a number of products including aircrafts and aircraft parts, some agricultural goods and certain chemicals – as well as EU purchases of US energy worth $750bn over three years. The PA news agency reports that in the aftermath of the deal, it was not clear whether 15% would remain the rate for the pharma sector or be increased. The EU-US statement published on Thursday said that as of 1 September, the US will apply a maximum tariff rate of 15% on generic pharmaceuticals, their ingredients and chemical precursors. Irish premier Micheál Martin said the statement brought “greater clarity and certainty” to what the EU-US agreement would mean in practice. He said: This is especially important for enterprises that either import from or export to the US. Given the scale of the pharmaceutical and semiconductor sectors in Ireland, it is important that the joint statement confirms that 15% is a ceiling that will apply to EU exports in these areas in all circumstances, including when the current US section 232 investigations are concluded. While I have been clear all along that I do not support tariffs, this is a significant win for the EU. Given the significance of the airline sector to Ireland, a specific carve-out for aircraft and aircraft parts is also welcome. There are areas where further work remains to be done, including a potential carve-out for med-tech products and spirits. I hope this will be advanced as quickly as possible. We will continue to advocate for these sectors given their significant importance to our domestic economy. The deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, has been hit with a legal challenge after she overruled a local council to approve a hyperscale datacentre on green belt land by the M25 in Buckinghamshire. Campaigners bringing the action are complaining that no environmental impact assessment was made for the 90MW datacentre, which was approved as part of the Labour government’s push to turn the UK into an AI powerhouse by trebling computing capacity to meet rising demand amid what it terms “a global race” as AI usage takes off. The home counties datacentre is relatively small compared with one planned in north Lincolnshire that will have about 10 times the capacity, and is dwarfed by one planned by Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg in Louisiana, which will be more than 50 times larger as he seeks to achieve digital “superintelligence”. But Foxglove, the tech equity campaign group bringing the legal challenge alongside the environmental charity Global Action Plan, said the energy demand could push up local electricity prices and said it was “baffling” that the government had not carried out an environmental assessment. Oliver Hayes, the head of campaigns at Global Action Plan, said Rayner’s “lack of meaningful scrutiny” was a worrying signal as more datacentres were planned around the UK. “Are the societal benefits of chatbots and deepfakes really worth sacrificing progress towards a safe climate and dependable water supply?” he said. “The government must reconsider its rash decision or risk an embarrassing reality check in court.” An ageing population, a funding squeeze and a recruitment crisis have taken England’s adult social care system to breaking point. In this episode of Politics Weekly UK, recorded and first published in March, John Harris visited Greater Manchester to find out what a day in the life of a care worker looked like and whether it was too late to save this vital service: Stella Creasy and Richard Tice are pushing for Labour to allow a Brexit scrutiny committee to be formed in parliament, after the Guardian revealed environmental protections had been eroded since the UK left the EU. The Labour and Reform UK MPs argue that there is no scrutiny or accountability over how Brexit is being implemented. Creasy, the MP for Walthamstow and chair of the Labour Movement for Europe, said the UK needed a “salvage operation” to clear up the environmental and regulatory havoc caused by Brexit. The analysis by the Guardian and the Institute for European Environmental Policy (IEEP) has found that since Brexit the EU has brought forward 28 new, revised or upgraded pieces of environmental legislation that the UK has not adopted, and the UK has actively chosen to regress by changing four different pieces of legislation including on protected habitats, pesticides and fisheries. Creasy said the prime minister, Keir Starmer, needed to move more quickly to repair relations with the EU and realign on environmental law. “I am working with Richard Tice as well as other Brexit sceptics on restoring some sort of European scrutiny committee in parliament so we can decide if and when we want to diverge rather than it all being passive,” she said. Creasy said: We don’t have a body in parliament that knows both UK and EU law and can forge a way forward. This data from the Guardian and IEEP makes the case for having a scrutiny committee looking at if we diverge, and if we strengthen or weaken environmental protections. MPs aren’t scrutinising this at all at the moment; they don’t even know about what’s going on. One major issue is the planning and infrastructure bill, which overrides the EU’s habitats directive and allows rare habitats such as chalk streams to be destroyed if developers pay a nature restoration levy to government. Chris Hinchliff, the MP for North East Hertfordshire, had the Labour whip removed for proposing amendments to the bill, including one to protect chalk streams from harmful development. Creasy said she supported Hinchliff and that the UK should not be regressing from EU law. There has been an 80% drop in the number of visas granted for nurses over the past 12 months, according to Home Office figures. For work-related visas, 182,553 visas were granted in the year to June, which represents a 36% drop on the previous year. The government said the 80% fall in visas for nurses may be due to “the end of the centrally supported nurse international recruitment programme and changes in demand for international staff”. The UK’s “broken” immigration system is spilling over into tensions in communities in Northern Ireland, a Stormont minister has said. Education minister Paul Givan made the comments as unionist politicians have asked for further investigations into the legal planning status of hotels in the region housing asylum seekers. Earlier this week Antrim and Newtownabbey Council said an enforcement investigation has begun into the legal planning status of the Chimney Corner Hotel in Co Antrim being used to house asylum seekers. It comes after Epping Forest district council was granted a temporary injunction by the high court on Tuesday which blocks asylum seekers from being housed at the Bell hotel in the Essex town. Unionist politicians have further raised concerns about the status of hotels within the Causeway Coast and Glens and Ards and North Down borough council areas. An asylum seeker staying at a hotel that has been the flashpoint for anti-migrant protests has described being called a “scumbag” and treated like a criminal by local people. Dozens of residents of Epping’s Bell hotel face an uncertain future after a court ruled on Tuesday that it cannot be used to house asylum seekers because of a breach of planning rules. The verdict came after weeks of violent protests outside the hotel by far-right activists sparked when an asylum seeker resident was charged with sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl. Khador Mohamed, 24, from Somalia, says residents were locked in their rooms during the protests. When they are allowed to venture outside they are insulted, he says. “People call you scumbags sometimes and they throw cans of soda at you.” He adds: “I wasn’t expecting this in England. I thought it would be friendlier.” Mohamed says local attitudes changed sharply after the charge against the resident. “Now we’re seen as criminals. Before that we were just normal people,” he said. He claims one woman shielded her children behind her when she saw Mohamed on the street. “It was a painful thing to happen to me – now we’re seen as rapist, paedophiles and thieves,” he says. He adds: “I am sorry for what happened, but there is nothing much I can do. We are not all the same.” The government is adding an extra year, and an extra £45m, to its scheme in England to help people find work, writes the Guardian’s senior economics correspondent, Richard Partington. You can read his feature on youth unemployment here: Labour more than doubled their donations in 2024, according to newly published figures, but still made a loss after spending a record amount on the general election campaign. The party’s annual accounts for last year, which were published alongside those of every significant UK political party, show it managed to attract nearly £40m in donations last year, up from £16.5m in the previous year. But the party’s huge election spending sapped it of money, leading to an overall deficit of £3.8m. The Electoral Commission has previously reported Labour spent a record £30m on fighting the general election – ahead of the Conservatives, who spent £24m. The Tories’ accounts meanwhile paint a bleak picture for the party, with donations having fallen by around a fifth last year, unusually for an election year. Reform in contrast saw their income rocket more than 800% as donations and membership fees flooded in. The party brought in £10.8mn in 2024, compared with £1.4mn in the previous year. The UK’s business activity posted its biggest growth in a year this month, led by a solid upturn in the service sector, according to a closely watched survey. The ‘flash’ reading from the S&amp;P Global PMI survey showed improvement across the private sector, despite employment remaining a weak spot, with companies cutting hiring for an eleventh month. The headline index rose to 53.0 in August from 51.5 in July, indicating faster expansion in business activity. Input cost inflation edged up to its highest since May. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said: The flash UK PMI survey for August indicated that the pace of economic growth has continued to accelerate over the summer after a sluggish spring, the rate of expansion now at a one-year high. The services sector has led the expansion, but manufacturing also showed further signs of stabilising. He cautioned that order books show that demand remains “uneven and fragile”. Companies report concerns over the impact of recent government policy changes, as well as unease emanating from broader geopolitical uncertainty. Goods exports are still falling especially sharply. Payroll numbers also continue to be cut at an aggressive rate by historical standards as firms cite weak order books and concerns over rising staff costs due to the policies announced in the autumn budget, which also contributed to persistent inflation pressures. While the rise in business activity signalled by the PMI alongside the uplift in inflation to 3.8% in July lower the chances of further rate cuts this year, more data are required to assess both the sustainability of robust economic growth as well as the stickiness of the upturn in price pressures. Among a divided Bank of England rate setting committee, the perceived need for any future rate cuts will be very much data dependent. The SNP government has been accused of a “national scandal” after it was revealed that hundreds of NHS buildings are more than 70 years old, reports the PA news agency. A Scottish Liberal Democrat freedom of information request to all of Scotland’s health boards found the NHS still relies on 597 buildings that were built seven decades ago. Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said: These figures show that the Scottish NHS is still relying on hundreds of buildings which are almost as old as the health service itself. While there will be many old buildings which have undergone the appropriate modernisation, the scale of the NHS’s maintenance backlog suggests that many of them have not kept pace with where health boards would like them to be. It is a national scandal that millions across the country are being treated in old and crumbling buildings that are no longer fit for purpose. The findings show 121 of the buildings are located in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board area, where there are also 210 buildings up to 50 years old. In NHS Lothian, 104 buildings are more than 70 years old, as are 97 in NHS Grampian and 93 in NHS Tayside. Across Scotland, there are also at least 18 buildings which are both more than 70 years old and require high-risk repairs. In December, it was reported that NHS Scotland’s maintenance backlog was more than £1.3bn, reports the PA news agency. In NHS Ayrshire and Arran, 30 buildings are more than 80 years old – predating the founding of the NHS in 1948. Cole-Hamilton said: The SNP have constantly delayed and paused new building projects. In budget negotiations, Liberal Democrats secured commitments to advance the new Edinburgh eye hospital, as well as replacements for the Belford hospital in Fort William and the Gilbert Bain in Shetland. But there are many more projects like these which have been neglected by the SNP for too long. Making sure people can get swift access to local health care in safe buildings should be a top priority for every political party. That’s what you get with the Scottish Liberal Democrats. I don’t believe the SNP can say the same. A Scottish government spokesperson said: We are providing £139m additional investment this year in NHS infrastructure to increase core capital funding for boards and support priority improvements and replacements in Scotland’s NHS estate. Historic real-terms cuts to our block grant from the UK government have put pressure on our capital budget, but despite this we have delivered various new healthcare facilities across the country. This includes new national treatment centres in Fife, Highland and at the Golden Jubilee, as well as new community hospitals in Aviemore and Skye. We are already working with all health boards to develop a whole-system NHS infrastructure plan which will meet the needs of the NHS across the whole of Scotland, supporting continued safe operation of existing facilities and informing longer-term investment priorities. Pupils in England who were thought to have been among the worst affected by Covid have bounced back in their GCSE results with more achieving top grades despite the disruption of the pandemic. There had been fears that this cohort, who were in the final year of primary when the pandemic hit in 2020, cancelling their key stage 2 tests and disrupting their transition to secondary school, would be severely impacted going forward in their education. However, the results published on Thursday showed 23% of entries for English 16-year-olds were awarded grades 7 or above, up from 22.6% last year, with boys improving their performance, though a higher proportion of girls continue to achieve top grades overall. For pupils in Northern Ireland, the proportion getting grades 7 and above rose by a full percentage point to 31.4%, while the percentage getting grades 4 or above went up to 63.8%. In Wales, pupils getting the top three grades rose to 20.1%, up from 19.8% in 2024, and those getting a 4 or better edged up by 0.3 percentage points to 63.8% this year. Jill Duffy, the chair of Joint Council for Qualifications board of directors and chief executive of the OCR exam board, paid tribute to pupils’ resilience: Looking at these results, it is hard not to be impressed by students’ breadth of skills and knowledge. These students have shown resilience and determination throughout their school years; they now have the chance to thrive in their next endeavours, whether that is in education, training or apprenticeships. Responding to this morning’s immigration figures showing a rise over the past year in the number of asylum seekers housed in hotels, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson Lisa Smart said: The asylum backlog has been far too large for far too long. The Conservatives trashed our immigration system and let numbers spiral. Now this Labour government is failing to get a grip on the crisis. The government urgently needs to stop dangerous Channel crossings and speed up asylum processing to bring down the backlog and end hotel use once and for all. Nigel Farage said the public is right to be angry with the government and their predecessors over the rise in asylum seekers being housed in hotels by the government, reports the PA news agency. Responding today’s Home Office figures, the Reform UK leader said: Under Labour we now have record numbers claiming asylum. The vast majority should never qualify and most will cost the taxpayer a huge sum of money. Our streets are becoming more dangerous yet this disaster gets worse. The public are right to be very angry with both Labour and the Tories for what they have done to us. The charity Safe Passage International has described the government as “working to shut down family reunion even further” due to its new scheme from France, part of the recent “one in, one out” deal, excluding unaccompanied children. Responding to today’s Home Office figures, Donna Covey, chief executive at Safe Passage International said: Over 5000 children have crossed the Channel in the year ending June 2025, over half of those children have had to make this dangerous journey alone. We work with unaccompanied children in Northern France who are simply trying to reach family, often the only family they have left. But with the UK’s limited family reunion rules, and a long, arduous process, they often turn to smugglers, at risk of exploitation, to reach family in the UK. This government says it’s aiming to stop Channel crossing yet it’s working to shut down family reunion even further, which will only push more refugee families into taking dangerous journeys to reunite in safety. The new scheme from France, part of the recent ‘one in, one out’ deal, offers a limited pathway for a few refugees in France, but it excludes unaccompanied children. The government must urgently rectify this, so children who have fled war and persecution, and are alone without family to care for them, can reach protection in the UK safely. The best way to save lives in the Channel, stop the smugglers trade and protect refugees is to open safe routes. The home secretary has said the government’s action to tackle the number of asylum seekers coming to the UK had been an important step to “restoring order”. Responding to new immigration statistics, Yvette Cooper said Labour had overseen increased numbers of returns of asylum seekers not granted asylum and pointed to the reduced spending on asylum. According to the PA news agency, Cooper said: We inherited a broken immigration and asylum system that the previous government left in chaos. Since coming to office we have strengthened Britain’s visa and immigration controls, cut asylum costs and sharply increased enforcement and returns, as today’s figures show. The action we have taken in the last 12 months – increasing returns of failed asylum seekers by over 30%, cutting asylum costs by 11%, reducing the backlog by 18% and our forthcoming plans to overhaul the failing asylum appeal system – are crucial steps to restoring order and putting an end to the chaotic use of asylum hotels that we inherited from the previous government. At the same time, we are bringing legal migration back under control, with a 48% reduction in work visas this year – and further stronger visa controls and higher skill requirements introduced through our white paper expected to bring those overall numbers down further. As we roll out further reforms, including the new pilot with France, new counter terror powers to strengthen border security and new asylum reforms later this year (including reforms to speed up the persistent delays in the appeals system), we will continue to take the serious steps required to restore order, control and fairness to the system, and to continue building the foundations of a new and stronger approach. Figures published by the Home Office on Thursday showed that the number of quarterly enforced returns of people who do not have a right to stay in the UK rose slightly from 2,314 in January-March 2025 to 2,323 in April-June 2025. A total of 9,072 enforced returns took place in the year to June, up 25% from 7,253 in the previous year and the highest figure for a 12-month period since the year to December 2018 (9,236). The Home Office is responsible for returning people to their country of origin if they do not have a legal right to remain in the UK. There are three types of returns: enforced returns, which are carried out directly by the Home Office; voluntary returns, who are people who were facing deportation but left of their own accord, sometimes with support from the Home Office; and port returns, who are people refused entry to the UK and who have subsequently departed. The Refugee Council said it welcomed “initial progress” in reducing the asylum backlog. Responding to the government’s quarterly asylum and immigration statistics released today, the refugee charity said the data “show[ed] mixed progress in the first year against the government’s manifesto pledge to ‘restore order to the asylum system so that it operates swiftly, firmly, and fairly’”. The charity noted that for the first time in four years, the asylum applications backlog fell below 100,000 people. It now stands at just over 70,000 cases, relating to almost 91,000 people – down by 18% from a year earlier and its lowest since September 2021, it added. Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: Bringing the asylum system back from the brink of collapse is a genuine achievement in the government’s first year. The increase in asylum decisions means refugees can begin to rebuild their lives sooner, and the use of costly hotels can be ended faster. However, this good work is being put at risk by poor-quality decisions – right now nearly half of appeals are successful. These mistakes have life-changing consequences for the people we work with, who have fled persecution in countries like Sudan and Afghanistan. There’s also still far too many people in hotels. Everyone agrees that hotels are the wrong answer – they cost the taxpayer billions, trap people in limbo and are flashpoints in communities. Getting decisions right first time is vital so refugees who need protection can move out of hotels and start rebuilding in safety, while those who don’t have the right to stay can return with dignity and respect. Alongside faster, better decisions we also need safe and legal routes, so people escaping conflict can reach the UK without taking dangerous journeys. Schemes for Ukraine, Syria and Afghanistan have shown what’s possible; that same lifeline must now be extended to others. Construction work has begun on a “landmark” windfarm in the south of Scotland that will generate enough electricity to power about 335,000 homes. The Sanquhar II community windfarm will become the UK’s fourth largest onshore windfarm when it becomes operational in August 2026, according to developers CWP Energy. The 44-turbine farm, which is being built in Dumfries and Galloway and east Ayrshire, will create more than £800m in local investment over its 40-year operational life. It is also expected to generate hundreds of jobs during the building phase, with the company saying “almost 50%” of the workforce will be sourced locally. The development was paused in 2023 over “tax decisions” by the previous UK government, but the company said it was made possible last month by the current UK government dropping its plans for “zonal energy pricing”. According to the PA news agency, Rod Wood, director of CWP Energy, said: Onshore wind is one of the cheapest forms of homegrown electricity, delivering consumers and businesses excellent value for money. We’re delighted that after nearly 10 years of careful planning, ground has been broken and the construction of Sanquhar II is now under way. The project brings with it an investment of an immediate £400m into the Scottish economy, creating long-term jobs, and paying local authority rates, taxes and community benefits. We’re grateful to the Scottish government for backing Sanquhar II and to the UK government for creating confidence in the renewables sector. James Ian Robinson, senior sales director for the UK and Ireland at Vestas, which is providing the project’s EnVentus platforms and V162 turbines, described it as an “important step” towards greater UK energy security: Construction is now under way on what will become the UK’s fourth largest onshore wind project, and we’re honoured to contribute to this landmark development. Sanquhar II marks another important step toward greater energy security through homegrown power generation in the UK. CWP Energy said the farm, which has been nearly 10 years in the planning, will offset 540,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide every year. Scottish secretary Ian Murray said he welcomed the development, which he said “demonstrates Scotland’s vital role in delivering the UK government’s clean power mission”. He added: Reformed national pricing will ensure the benefits of clean power are felt by communities and consumers in every part of the country, while giving businesses the stability and certainty they need to continue investing to upgrade our infrastructure to boost our national energy security, helping to create thousands of skilled jobs, and boosting the economy. Huw Jones, chair of Jones Bros Civil Engineering UK, set out the positive impact the construction phase of the development will have on the local economy. “Currently on site, we are averaging 100 personnel per day, with the expectation for this to rise to 200,” he said, adding: We are utilising local contractors and suppliers where we can, and almost 50% of our workforce are from the local area, with many others utilising the accommodation facilities within the surrounding towns and villages. The number of young people not in education, employment or training (known as Neets) has increased, figures show. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said there was an increase in the number of Neets aged 16 to 24 in the three months to June to 948,000, up from 923,000 in January to March. The PA news agency reports that TUC general secretary Paul Nowak said: This is yet another toxic Tory legacy this government has to fix. Under the Conservatives, too many were failed with hundreds of thousands of young people stuck out of work, education or training. This has damaging consequences for young people’s prospects – and for the country as a whole too. With the youth guarantee, stronger employment rights, an industrial strategy and apprenticeship reforms, the government has made a positive start in turning this around. Iona Ledwidge, chief executive of youth charity Resurgo, said: These new figures represent a growing mountain of untapped talent and are a clear signal that the government needs to speed up its work to support young people into work or education. More than half of these young people have never had a job. Joblessness is a bottomless pit – the further you go into it, the harder it is to climb out. But we’ve seen thousands climb out and thrive. Sustained, tailored coaching in the right skills is the ladder. Despite a good month for the public finances, the Treasury won’t be putting in any champagne orders, writes the Guardian’s senior economics writer, Phillip Inman. You can read his analysis, on why radical tax reform may be only way for chancellor Rachel Reeves to balance the books, at the link below: Retired women effectively go more than four months every year without getting a pension because of a gender gap, according to research by the Trades Union Congress (TUC). The PA news agency reports that the TUC estimated women were losing the equivalent of £7,600 a year on average. The union organisation said compared with men, retired women effectively stop receiving pension income from today. The income gap between men and women in retirement is now 36.5%, according to research from the Prospect union. The government has revived the pension commission, which will bring together unions, employer and independent experts to look into the causes of the gap. TUC general secretary Paul Nowak said: Everyone deserves dignity and security in retirement, but too many retired women have been left without enough to get by. We must make sure that these inequalities are addressed for future generations. That’s why reviving the pensions commission – bringing together unions, employers and independent experts – is a vital step forward. We now have a chance to make sure everyone, including women, receive the decent retirement income that all workers need. A government spokesperson said: We’re determined to close the gender pensions gap, and the new state pension has already reduced historic inequalities faced by women and low earners. Alongside this, the pensions commission will tackle barriers to close the gender pensions gap in private pensions to ensure women have the dignity and security they deserve in retirement. Minister Catherine McKinnell has said it is “really important” to manage asylum accommodation while also speeding up the claims process. The education minister told Sky News this morning, before Thursday’s Home Office data release: We inherited a terrible mess from the last government when it comes to the immigration system and particularly the processing of asylum claims – massive backlog. She added: [I] absolutely recognise the concerns that local communities have and we want to work with local communities to find solutions. Pressed on the speed of government efforts to close asylum hotels, McKinnell said: What we’ve done is doubled the number of asylum claims that have been processed. So, that is reducing the number of people who are requiring this accommodation, but also returning people that shouldn’t be here. We’re also committed to ending the use of asylum hotels by the end of this parliament. So, it will take some time to clean up the situation that we’ve inherited, but, you know, it’s really important that we continue to both manage the accommodation that people are currently in and also speed up the process. The backlogs are totally unacceptable, not only for the amount of time that people are wasting, but that people are just not being returned that shouldn’t be here as well. People have “every right to engage in protest”, the shadow home secretary has said, amid concerns a high court ruling could trigger a wave of demonstrations outside asylum hotels. Chris Philp named three Conservative-led councils which are considering taking legal action against hoteliers whose property is being used to house asylum seekers. His party’s leader Kemi Badenoch has written to Conservative council leaders “encouraging” them to follow Epping Forest district council’s footsteps by launching bids to shut these hotels, if their “legal advice supports it”. Philp told BBC Breakfast on Thursday that Borough of Broxbourne council in Hertfordshire, Reigate and Banstead borough council in Surrey, and Hillingdon council in London were each considering taking similar legal action. “So, I think there are many up and down the country who are looking at this following the Epping ruling,” he said. Philp added: I think these councils are, you know, sick and tired of having these asylum hotels housing predominantly young men who entered the country illegally in their communities. They want to see them closing down and that is why I think they’re rightly looking at legal action. According to the PA news agency, when asked whether there was a “risk” the high court’s decision “will encourage more protests and problems in communities outside these hotels”, Philp told BBC Breakfast: People are understandably angry about the government, the Labour government’s failings, the border crisis they’re presiding over. They do have the right to peacefully protest – I do stress the word ‘peacefully’. Peaceful protest is lawful, it is every citizen’s right to do that. Of course, if it isn’t peaceful, that is wrong and that should be dealt with by the police, but where protest is peaceful, people have every right to engage in protest. He had earlier claimed that “reporting says hundreds of charges have been laid against illegal immigrants being accommodated in these hotels”. A total of 32,059 asylum seekers were being housed temporarily in UK hotels at the end of Labour’s first year in government, up 8% on the same point 12 months ago, Home Office data released today shows, reports the PA news agency. The latest data, published on Thursday as part of the usual quarterly immigration statistics, cover Labour’s first year in office. They show the number of asylum seekers in UK hotels by the end of June was up from 29,585 at the same point a year earlier, when the Conservatives were still in power but down slightly on the 32,345 figure at the end of March. The latest number is still below the peak of 56,042 asylum seekers in hotels at the end of September 2023 under the Tories. Figures for hotels published by the Home Office on Thursday date back to December 2022. Government spending on asylum in the UK stood at £4.76bn in 2024/25, down 12% from a record £5.38bn in 2023/24. The total covers all Home Office costs related to asylum, including direct cash support and accommodation, plus wider staffing and other migration and borders activity. It does not include costs relating to the interception of migrants who travel to the UK across the English Channel in small boats. The UK government borrowed less than expected in July, official figures show, in a boost to the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, as she faces pressure ahead of her autumn budget. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed public sector net borrowing – the difference between public spending and income – fell to £1.1bn, down by £2.3bn from the same month a year earlier. The reading was below City predictions for a deficit of £2.6bn and forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) of £2.1bn. Borrowing over the first four months of the financial year so far was £60bn. While matching the OBR’s forecasts, it was £6.7bn higher than in the same period a year earlier, and the third highest April-to-July borrowing since monthly records began. Despite the better-than-expected July figure, economists warned the chancellor would still face a tough autumn budget because the OBR was likely to slash its growth forecasts for the UK economy, while Labour’s welfare U-turns would add to borrowing. Alex Kerr, UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said Reeves would probably need to raise between £17bn and £27bn to maintain headroom of £9.9bn against her self-imposed fiscal rules. “Ultimately, today’s release does little to brighten the gloomy outlook ahead of the budget later this year,” he said. Ministers are understood to be exploring options to raise more money from inheritances and property taxation, the Guardian has revealed. Earlier this month the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) thinktank warned the shortfall in the public finances could reach more than £40bn. Martin Beck, chief economist at WPI Strategy, said the latest figures would offer Reeves some relief. “Talk of a huge ‘black hole’ in the public finances is looking overstated, but the outlook is still uncomfortably tight,” he said. Charles Falconer, a Labour peer who served as justice secretary under Tony Blair and was previously Keir Starmer’s shadow attorney general, urged ministers to appeal against the court decision to close the asylum hotel in Epping. He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme the judgment “causes great problems” because it “gives rise to the expectation that some asylum hotels can be closed” but without indicating which ones. He said: I very strongly urge the government – I don’t know what they’re going to do – to appeal and get some certainty, first of all on which should be closed … and which shouldn’t. Secondly, to deal with the question of a reasonable timescale in relation to this, and thirdly, to deal with this very troublesome issue: namely do demonstrations outside these hostels lead it to it being more likely that they will be closed? Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said that the Conservatives were wrong to have used so many hotels to house asylum seekers while they were in government. Asked whether the number of hotels in use had been a mistake, Philp told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: Yes it was. We wanted to get it down. And we did get it down. In the last nine months we halved the number of asylum hotels and had that trend continued by now there would be no asylum hotels. Catherine McKinell, an education minister, said the government was committed to ending the use of asylum hotels by the end of this parliament. Asked where asylum seekers would be housed instead, she told Times Radio: That’s a big question. And one that I think we need to work very closely with local authorities and local communities to tackle. Education minister Catherine McKinnell has said the government is “tackling” the barriers to better grades after she was asked why white working-class children are “doing so badly”, reports the PA news agency. McKinnell said the question was a “really profound” one and that underachievement in that demographic “has persisted over many years”. She told Times Radio: We’ve seen there have been some improvements in our school system in the last decade, there have been over 30 years improvements in our school system. But this challenge has persisted, which is why we are very focused on tackling child poverty in the early years. We’re extending free school meals to [an] additional half a million children. We’re investing in free breakfast clubs to make sure that children get that really good start to the day, both from a socialised perspective, but also food. So, we are tackling what we see are the barriers that are holding young people back, and also making sure that they want to be in school as well. Students receiving their GCSE results in England, Wales and Northern Ireland on Thursday will have “support available”, McKinell added. McKinnell told Times Radio: I think whatever the outcome for these young people, they have worked incredibly hard, as have the schools, as have the teachers. So, it really is a day to recognise that and to celebrate, and also to mark how important it is that this is a springboard into whatever comes next. So, for young people who are awaiting their results, whatever the outcome, there’ll be support available, whether it’s to go on to an apprenticeship, to A-levels, to T-levels, to vocational qualifications. It’s a very exciting day for an awful lot of young people, their families and their schools. You can keep up to date with the latest via the Guardian’s GCSE results live blog: Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick has echoed Kemi Badenoch’s views, saying the country is “in a mess”. He told the Daily Express: Every patriotic council, whether Conservative, Reform, whatever, should follow Epping’s lead and seek an injunction. Tuesday’s high court decision has also caused a potential headache for the Home Office, which has a legal duty to house destitute asylum seekers while their claims are being dealt with. If planning laws prevent the government from using hotels, ministers will face a scramble to find alternative accommodation, potentially in the private rented sector. Kemi Badenoch has called for more Conservative councils to launch legal challenges over hotels housing asylum seekers as the government faces a potential revolt from its own local authorities. In a letter to Tory councils, Badenoch said she was “encouraging” them to “take the same steps” as Epping council “if your legal advice supports it”, reports the PA news agency. Epping secured a temporary injunction from the high court on Tuesday, blocking the use of the Essex town’s Bell hotel as accommodation for asylum seekers on planning grounds. Labour dismissed Badenoch’s letter as “desperate and hypocritical nonsense”, but several of its own local authorities have already suggested they too, could mount legal action against hotels in their areas. The decision has prompted councils controlled by Labour, the Conservatives and Reform UK to investigate whether they could pursue a similar course of action. These include Labour-run Tamworth and Wirral councils, Tory-run Broxbourne and East Lindsey councils and Reform’s Staffordshire and West Northamptonshire councils. Patrick Harley, the leader of Conservative-run Dudley council, told the Daily Mail it was looking at taking legal action, a verdict echoed by Richard Biggs, the Tory leader of Reigate and Banstead council. But Labour’s Newcastle city council and Brighton and Hove city council have both ruled out legal action. In her letter, Badenoch praised Epping council’s legal challenge and told Tory councils she would “back you to take similar action to protect your community”. But she added that the situation would “depend on individual circumstances of the case” and suggested Tory councils could pursue “other planning enforcement options”. Badenoch also accused Labour of “trying to ram through such asylum hotels without consultation and proper process”, saying the government had reopened the Bell hotel as asylum accommodation after the Conservatives had closed it. The hotel had previously been used as asylum accommodation briefly in 2020 and then between 2022 and 2024 under the previous Conservative government. According to the PA news agency, a Labour spokesperson said Badenoch’s letter was a “pathetic stunt” and “desperate and hypocritical nonsense from the architects of the broken asylum system”, saying there were now “20,000 fewer asylum seekers in hotels than at their peak under the Tories”. The letter comes ahead of the publication on Thursday of figures showing how many asylum seekers were being temporarily housed in hotels at the end of June this year. We’ll have more on this soon. Meanwhile, students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland will receive their GCSE results today. Education minister Catherine McKinnell is on the morning media rounds for the government, while the shadow home secretary, Chris Philp is doing the same for the Conservatives.

Stella Creasy and Richard Tice are pushing for Labour to allow a Brexit scrutiny committee to be formed in parliament, after the Guardian revealed environmental protections had been eroded since the UK left the EU. The Labour and Reform UK MPs argue that there is no scrutiny or accountability over how Brexit is being implemented. The deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, has been hit with a legal challenge after she overruled a local council to approve a hyperscale datacentre on green belt land by the M25 in Buckinghamshire. Campaigners bringing the action are complaining that no environmental impact assessment was made for the 90MW datacentre, which was approved as part of the Labour government’s push to turn the UK into an AI powerhouse by trebling computing capacity to meet rising demand amid what it terms “a global race” as AI usage takes off. England will sell off more than eight times as many council homes in 2025-26 as were constructed the previous year, research has found. Right to buy is depleting council housing stock more quickly than public housing can be replaced, forcing people to spend more money on private market rents and obtain less secure tenancies, a report from the thinktank Common Wealth finds.
