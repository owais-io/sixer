  UK inflation rose again last month to a higher-than-expected 3.8% amid higher
  food prices and travel costs, adding to fears that the Bank of England will
  delay further interest rate cuts. Figures showed the annual rate as measured
  by the consumer prices index climbed from June’s 3.6% reading, sitting above
  the central bank’s 2% target for the 10th consecutive month. That overshot
  financial market forecasts of a 3.7% figure for July and makes another
  reduction in the cost of borrowing this year unlikely, with financial markets
  not fully pricing in the chance of a fresh quarter-point cut until next
  spring. The data also suggests rail fares are likely to rise by 5.8% next
  year. Increases in regulated train ticket prices are usually calculated by
  adding one percentage point to July’s inflation reading as measured by the
  retail prices index, which was 4.8%. The Office for National Statistics said a
  jump in air fares was behind much of the increase in average prices. Tickets
  on flights out of the UK rose 30% month on month, although much of the
  increase was because of the earlier timing of the summer holiday break. Petrol
  prices added 0.1 percentage points to inflation after a comparison with last
  year, when prices at the pumps were falling. Food and non-alcoholic beverages
  were up 4.9% year on year in July, an increase from 4.5% in the 12 months to
  June. Beef, orange juice, coffee and chocolate were among the worst-hit
  products. Droughts in Spain, Italy and Portugal, where the UK sources much of
  its fresh fruit and vegetables, have pushed up prices this summer, at a time
  when prices would usually fall. The increase in food prices will present the
  government with a difficult negotiating position as it enters talks with
  public sector unions over pay. Ministers are trying to limit annual earnings
  increases to below 4%, except for resident hospital doctors. However, higher
  food prices are likely to lead to demands for higher wages from staff.
  Analysts said the likelihood of an interest rate cut this year had diminished
  but that it was not impossible. The National Institute of Economic and Social
  Research (Niesr) expects inflation to decline in the second half of the year
  and to fall back to the Bank’s 2% target by the end of 2026. It said there was
  a strong argument for a cut in November after a rise in unemployment and
  decline in job vacancies showed the economy weakening, although the decision
  would depend on the path of inflation over the coming months. The Niesr
  economist Monica George Michail said: “Given that several of the current
  drivers of annual price increases are one-off policy changes, we think the
  Bank of England may look through them and cut interest rates one more time
  this year. However, there remain upside risks especially from food prices and
  sustained wage pressures, which will force the Bank to remain cautious” The
  Bank’s monetary policy committee trimmed interest rates to 4% earlier this
  month in line with projections of falling inflation over the next two years.
  However, several of its members voted to hold interest rates until the trend
  became clearer. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said: “We have taken the
  decisions needed to stabilise the public finances, and we’re a long way from
  the double-digit inflation we saw under the previous government, but there’s
  more to do to ease the cost of living. “That’s why we’ve raised the minimum
  wage, extended the £3 bus fare cap, expanded free school meals to over half a
  million more children, and are rolling out free breakfast clubs for every
  child in the country. Through our plan for change we’re going further and
  faster to put more money in people’s pockets.” Companies have blamed
  employment tax rises and the uncertainty caused by Donald Trump’s tariff war
  for an increase in domestic prices. The shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, said
  the increase in employer national insurance contributions had forced companies
  to increase prices, making a global rise in prices even worse. The energy
  consultancy Cornwall Insight said on Tuesday that it expected the energy price
  cap covering domestic electricity and gas would go up by £17 or 1% in October,
  adding to domestic fuel costs. Sharon Graham, the head of Unite, the UK’s
  second-largest union, said the government needed to ease the pressure on
  household budgets after the increase in food costs. “Once again, the soaring
  cost of basic essentials like food and water is pushing families to the brink.
  Workers and their families are struggling to pay excessive bills. Pressure
  needs to be taken off family budgets by giving workers a pay rise. The time
  for action is now.”
