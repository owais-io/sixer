  SEE YOU IN STRASBOURG Strasbourg, official seat of the European parliament,
  the jewel of the Alsace region on the west bank of the Rhine. Important
  historically, geographically and politically. One of the city’s most famous
  sons, Arsène Wenger, as a boy, was so embedded that his first language was Low
  Alemannic German, not French. To use a word Wenger brought to the English
  football vernacular – footballistically – Strasbourg was never too much of a
  hub. The club reformed after liquidation as recently as 2011, having won just
  one French title back in 1979 when Wenger was a fringe player already embedded
  in coaching. In defence was the future France coach Raymond Domenech, the keen
  astrologist in charge when a very Gallic bust-up ravaged Les Bleus at the 2010
  World Cup. Until now, though it is more correct to say Strasbourg has become a
  football trading hub. As the summer transfer window SLAMMED SHUT on Monday,
  Racing Club de Strasbourg Alsace became a rather regular destination. In 2023,
  RC fell into the hands of BlueCo. Name familiar? The same US-based company had
  bought Chelsea from a sanctioned Roman Abramovich the previous year, beginning
  one of those multi-club arrangements causing untold trouble this summer. Like
  Girona with Manchester City, there is something of a familiar look to
  Strasbourg’s squad, pretty large for a club in the Conference League. Within
  the squad are Kendry Páez, an Ecuadorian teenager; Mamadou Sarr, French
  defender; Mike Penders, Belgian keeper. All are young players loaned by
  Chelsea. Diego Moreira, a young Belgian wing-back, signed from Chelsea last
  year. Mathis Amougou, a young French midfielder signed from Chelsea this
  summer. Ishé Samuels-Smith, a young English defender signed from Chelsea in
  the summer, has joined Swansea on loan, On Monday, Ben Chilwell, a not-so
  young English full-back, arrived from Chelsea for a two-year deal. Raheem
  Sterling is presumed to have refused to become a Eurostar loyalty card member.
  Thus, RC have become a repository for talent either too young or not good
  enough to play for Chelsea. Fans of the actual football club, rather than a
  warehousing facility, are unhappy and protesting. Until BlueCo swanned in, RC
  had enjoyed a fan-centric culture under the former West Ham player Marc
  Keller, chief executive since 2001 and a local hero who took the club from
  fourth tier to Ligue 1. After selling to BlueCo, Keller is now portrayed among
  some militant fans as the traitor to the collective. Last season saw
  goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic and winger Andrey Santos come to Strasbourg and go
  back to Chelsea. Similar traffic has followed, footballers reimagined as
  commodities bought and sold like pork bellies and frozen orange juice. Modern
  football is rubbish. QUOTE OF THE DAY We’re all captivated by the journey of
  Wrexham. It’s been amazing for Welsh football and hopefully now in a number of
  years we’ll see young players coming through … There isn’t similarities to how
  I play to how Wrexham play. It’s different ways, no right or wrong way for
  this” – Craig Bellamy, the Wales manager, praises Wrexham’s rise under the
  co-ownership of Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney. Despite his newfound
  diplomacy, let’s assume the former Cardiff forward isn’t entirely sold on a
  style of play focused on 6ft 5in striker Kieffer Moore. FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS
  I have always been puzzled by the content-less headline at the end of your
  teatime emails. But yesterday’s ‘We should have sat in a car park’ rubbed salt
  into a wound. My wife and I sat in the Select Car Leasing Stadium car park on
  Saturday awaiting rescue of our stricken vehicle by the AA. Except for a
  ripple of applause in the 66th minute we could have heard a pin drop,
  suggesting your sentiment was spot on for the other 12,624 who went to watch
  Reading 1-0 Port Vale” – Alan Giles. Whatever Football Daily goes on to
  achieve, it will always be remembered for ‘even the stadia are in tiers’
  [yesterday’s Daily] – Rich Johnson. Just before the transfer window closed,
  Charlton fans were delighted to learn that James Bree was joining on loan from
  Southampton. Many think that he compares favourably with Ben White of Arsenal.
  Personally, I think they’re chalk and cheese” – Phil Hearn. I am certain I
  will be one of 1,057 to point out that Mr Clough was clearly waving a
  badminton, not a squash, racket around [the jury’s out – FD Ed] … I assume you
  oversight is because you, like everyone else in this country, have been
  inculcated into the Padel Cult?” – Patrick Brennan (and 1,056 others). In this
  window’s competition for least enthusiastic new signee, the prize must surely
  go to Piero Hincapié, seemingly ambushed at night outside someone’s garage and
  made to wave an unwieldy tifo flag” – Charles Antaki. If you have any, please
