  This live blog will be closing shortly. Thank you for reading the updates and
  commenting below the line. You can keep up to date with the Guardian’s UK
  politics coverage here. Here is a summary from today’s blog: The Home Office
  will seek to appeal against the high court’s refusal to allow it to intervene
  in the case of a hotel used to house asylum seekers in Epping, security
  minister Dan Jarvis said. Jarvis said closing hotels housing asylum seekers
  must be done “in a managed and ordered way” as he unveiled government plans to
  challenge the high court’s decision related to the Bell hotel in Epping,
  Essex. On Friday, Yvette Cooper said ministers are working to close hotels
  housing asylum seekers “as swiftly as possible” as part of an “orderly”
  programme that avoids creating problems for other areas. Cooper reiterated
  Labour’s manifesto commitment to end the use of hotels to accommodate asylum
  seekers. She also accused the previous Conservative government of presiding
  over a “chaotic and disorderly situation” in 2022 that saw “140 extra hotels
  were opened in the space of six months because they lost control of the
  system”. Heather Whitbread, Conservative councillor for the Epping West and
  Rural ward, hit back at Yvette Cooper’s warning, saying that the court ruling
  was “a decision on a planning point”, accusing the hotel owner of breaking
  planning law and insisting it was the council’s job to enforce regulations.
  The Home Office’s plan to appeal against the high court’s Epping asylum hotel
  ruling “is completely wrong”, Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp
  has said. He accused the government of not “listening to the public or to the
  courts”. Foreign secretary David Lammy has described the declaration of famine
  in Gaza City as “utterly horrifying” as he accused the Israeli government of
  causing a “man-made catastrophe”. Lammy also repeated calls for “an immediate
  ceasefire, to enable aid delivery at maximum speed and at the scale required”,
  including a halt to military operations in Gaza City. Lammy has joined 20
  other foreign ministers around the world in condemning Israeli plans to build
  an illegal settlement on the West Bank, with the Foreign Office summoning the
  Israeli ambassador to communicate the government’s displeasure. The foreign
  secretary co-signed a joint statement on Thursday criticising the so-called E1
  plan, a 3,400-home settlement that critics say would divide the West Bank in
  half. Dozens of protests outside hotels used as temporary accommodation for
  asylum seekers are expected over the weekend across England amid mounting
  tensions over the issue. Anti-migrant protests and counter-demonstrations held
  by Stand Up to Racism are expected on Friday outside hotels believed to be
  used to house asylum seekers, including in Bournemouth, Cardiff and Leeds,
  with more expected on Saturday. Workers at the UK’s third-largest steelworks
  in South Yorkshire have been assured they will receive their pay for August as
  well as unpaid pension contributions, after a government-appointed special
  manager took over the collapsed company. Liberty Steel’s main British
  business, Speciality Steel UK (SSUK), collapsed into administration on
  Thursday afternoon after a high court judge ruled that it was insolvent and
  that its owner, the metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta, had no prospects of repaying
  debts of several hundred million pounds. The Conservatives have lost overall
  control of Surrey county council after losing out to Reform UK and the Liberal
  Democrats in two separate byelection results. The Lib Dems gained the Hinchley
  Wood, Claygate, and Oxshott seat from the Tories, while Reform took the
  Addlestone seat in yesterday’s byelections. Scottish Conservative MSP Jeremy
  Balfour has resigned from the party and will sit as an independent. In his
  resignation letter to party leader Russell Findlay, Balfour said the Scottish
  Conservatives had “fallen into the trap of reactionary politics” and that a
  “positive, proactive agenda for real change” had been rejected. A Scottish
  Conservative spokesperson said: “We are disappointed to read these comments
  but grateful for Jeremy’s service and wish him well.” Deep problems at the
  UK’s statistics agency with the quality of its data are piling pressure on
  officials in the run-up to the autumn budget, sources have told the Guardian.
  Staff at the Treasury and its independent spending watchdog are struggling to
  get a clear picture of the economy because of troubles at the Office for
  National Statistics (ONS) with producing reliable numbers. GMB has urged the
  government to “take a stake” in the future of Liberty Steel after assuming
  control of its Speciality Steels UK (SSUK) division. Charlotte
  Brumpton-Childs, GMB national officer, told BBC Breakfast that recent
  developments show why public ownership or greater government control is
  needed. Separately, the mayor of South Yorkshire said the government taking
  control of the UK’s third-largest steelworks was “good news” but that a
  conclusion should not be rushed. Elon Musk’s company, Tesla, should have its
  application to supply energy to UK homes blocked on national security grounds,
  Ed Davey has told ministers. The Liberal Democrat leader argued that giving
  the electric car manufacturer a foothold in the British energy market would be
  “a gravely concerning move considering Elon Musk’s repeated interference in UK
  politics”. Baby food manufacturers have been given 18 months to improve the
  quality of their products in England, amid mounting concerns that leading
  brands are nutritionally poor. The new voluntary guidance from the government
  calls for a reduction in sugar and salt levels in food for infants and
  toddlers. Nick Gibb, the former Conservative education minister, defended
  resits for students who fail to pass their maths and English GCSEs after the
  policy came under fire following new data showing that just 17% of those
  forced to retake had managed to achieve a grade 4 or above this year. The
  policy for pupils in England dates back to Gibb’s time as education minister.
  Ministers have announced a clampdown on people who continue to claim child
  benefit payments even though they have moved abroad, in measures that could
  save the taxpayer £350m over five years. The government said 2,600 people who
  had left the UK but still claimed the benefit had already been removed from
  the welfare system. Diane Abbott has said she advised her longtime friend
  Jeremy Corbyn not to launch a new political party because she believed it
  would struggle to make inroads under the first-past-the-post system. Abbott,
  the MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, said last month she would not be
  leaving Labour in favour of Corbyn’s as yet unnamed party, despite the pair
  having worked closely together in the past. A professor of public policy has
  said managing relationships between the UK government and Holyrood has to be a
  priority in the upcoming Scottish election – especially if it results in a
  minority administration. Speaking at a Festival of Politics event at the
  Scottish parliament about expectations and concerns for the Holyrood poll next
  May, Prof Nicola McEwen said that relationships across parties have become
  increasingly strained. Civil servants in a government department are to strike
  in a dispute over office closures, recruitment and attendance policies. The
  Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) said more than 1,100 of its members
  in the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) will take
  industrial action on 1 September. Smaller groups of union members will strike
  from 2 to 25 September. Scots are being urged to use water more efficiency in
  a bid to protect resources and maintain normal water levels. Scottish Water
  said August was drier than normal, and it followed the country’s driest spring
  in 70 years. It said reservoir levels across Scotland are down by 2% to 73%
  this week, 9% lower than the average of 82% for this time of year. Closing
  asylum hotels must be “orderly” rather than through “piecemeal court
  decisions”, the home secretary has said as the government plans to appeal
  against a court ruling blocking the use of an Epping hotel. The Home Office
  will seek to appeal against the high court’s refusal to allow it to intervene
  in the case, and to then further appeal against the temporary injunction. On
  Friday, Yvette Cooper said ministers are working to close hotels housing
  asylum seekers “as swiftly as possible” as part of an “orderly” programme that
  avoids creating problems for other areas, reports the PA news agency. Cooper
  said: We agree with communities across the country that all asylum hotels need
  to close, including the Bell hotel, and we are working to do so as swiftly as
  possible as part of an orderly, planned and sustained programme that avoids
  simply creating problems for other areas or local councils as a result of
  piecemeal court decisions or a return to the kind of chaos which led to so
  many hotels being opened in the first place. That is the reason for the Home
  Office appeal in this case, to ensure that going forward, the closure of all
  hotels can be done in a properly managed way right across the country –
  without creating problems for other areas and local councils. Cooper
  reiterated Labour’s manifesto commitment to end the use of hotels to
  accommodate asylum seekers. She also accused the previous Conservative
  government of presiding over a “chaotic and disorderly situation” in 2022 that
  saw “140 extra hotels were opened in the space of six months because they lost
  control of the system”. Foreign secretary David Lammy has described the
  declaration of famine in Gaza City as “utterly horrifying” as he accused the
  Israeli government of causing a “man-made catastrophe”, reports the PA news
  agency. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said on Friday
  that famine is occurring in Gaza City and could spread farther south. It comes
  after weeks of warnings by aid groups that restrictions on aid were leading to
  starvation among Palestinians. In a statement on Friday afternoon, Lammy said:
  The confirmation of famine in Gaza City and the surrounding neighbourhood is
  utterly horrifying and is wholly preventable. The Israeli government’s refusal
  to allow sufficient aid into Gaza has caused this man-made catastrophe. This
  is a moral outrage. The IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification)
  report makes clear the sickening consequences, especially for children. The
  government of Israel can and must immediately act to stop the situation
  deteriorating any further. It must immediately and sustainably allow
  unhindered food, medical supplies, fuel, and all types of aid to reach those
  who so desperately need them. It is the first time that the IPC has confirmed
  a famine in the Middle East. The IPC report said that more than half a million
  people in Gaza face catastrophic levels of hunger, and many are at risk of
  dying from malnutrition-related causes. Lammy also repeated calls for “an
  immediate ceasefire, to enable aid delivery at maximum speed and at the scale
  required”, including a halt to military operations in Gaza City. He added: The
  UK reiterates its condemnation of this military action, which will only worsen
  the already catastrophic humanitarian situation and endanger the lives of the
  hostages held by Hamas. We urge the Israeli government to change course and
  halt its plans. This terrible conflict must end. An immediate and permanent
  ceasefire is the only way to stop the suffering, secure the release of the
  hostages, achieve a surge in aid and deliver a framework for lasting peace.
  According to the PA news agency, Heather Whitbread, Conservative councillor
  for the Epping West and Rural ward, has hit back at Yvette Cooper’s warning
  that asylum hotels must be closed “in a properly managed way”. She said the
  row was “a decision on a planning point”, accusing the hotel owner of breaking
  planning law and insisting it was the council’s job to enforce regulations.
  Whitbread warned that waiting until the end of parliament to close hotels was
  “too long”, adding: Our community can’t afford to wait another four years. She
  said the protests had already caused “a huge amount of disruption” and argued
  the hotel’s use as asylum accommodation was “untenable” and unsafe for both
  residents and the wider Epping community. Dozens of immigration protesters
  have faced off with anti-racism demonstrators in Portsmouth. According to the
  PA news agency Rita, a Portsmouth resident who joined the Stand Up to Racism
  counter-protest said: I feel ashamed [at the protest] and I say this as a
  white British elderly lady who has been spat upon, verbally abused and had
  things thrown at me, just for being on this side of the road. I am angry that
  my Christianity is being used as a weapon by the right and to be used in the
  name of fascism. The Home Office’s plan to appeal against the high court’s
  Epping asylum hotel ruling “is completely wrong”, Conservative shadow home
  secretary Chris Philp has said. According to the PA news agency, he said: The
  Epping Bell hotel injunction has been a victory for local people, led by a
  Conservative council working hard for their community. This is the difference
  Conservatives in local government deliver. In opposition, Labour worked
  hand-in-glove with activist lawyers to sabotage Conservative immigration
  plans. In government, nothing has changed. It is completely wrong that the
  Labour government is taking legal action to keep open the Bell hotel. The
  Government isn’t listening to the public or to the courts. Instead of trying
  to keep illegal immigrants in expensive hotels, the Conservatives would remove
  all illegal arrivals, put in place a real deterrent and ensure towns like
  Epping are never put in this position again. A professor of public policy has
  said managing relationships between the UK government and Holyrood has to be a
  priority in the upcoming Scottish election – especially if it results in a
  minority administration, reports the PA news agency. Speaking at a Festival of
  Politics event at the Scottish parliament about expectations and concerns for
  the Holyrood poll next May, Prof Nicola McEwen said that relationships across
  parties have become increasingly strained. She said: I think we can be pretty
  confident that we will end up with a fragmented parliament where there is not
  a single party majority. We will have a parliament of minorities – nothing new
  in that – but I think we will have a parliament of minorities that may find it
  more difficult to work across party lines. Partly because of the nature of
  relationships that have emerged over recent years, and we have seen an
  increasing polarisation among the parties. Prof McEwen is a professor of
  public policy and governance at the University of Glasgow, director of the
  Centre for Public Policy, and senior fellow at the UK In A Changing Europe
  thinktank. She leads research on devolution and inter-institutional relations
  and provides advice to governments and public bodies. According to the PA news
  agency, Prof McEwen advised that relationships across parties and between the
  UK and Scottish governments need to be prioritised in order for Holyrood to be
  able to successfully deliver on policies. She said: Even if there was a
  majority government – there won’t be, but even if there was – the Scottish
  government cannot deliver things alone. It tends to set the framework and
  relies a lot on delivery partners, and a very big partner in that is local
  government. There’s the relationship between the Scottish government and UK
  government. It’s an area I’ve done quite a lot of research on over the years,
  and the relationship particularly before the general election was dire. That’s
  a problem, because it really matters … There are so many areas of policy that
  are still reserved, but they have an impact on the responsibilities of this
  parliament. She added: Managing that relationship has to be a priority for any
  administration in Scotland. That has been better since the last election since
  the change of government, but there are still challenges and still issues.
  Nick Gibb, the former Conservative education minister, defended resits for
  students who fail to pass their maths and English GCSEs after the policy came
  under fire following new data showing that just 17% of those forced to retake
  had managed to achieve a grade 4 or above this year. The policy for pupils in
  England dates back to Gibb’s time as education minister, with the increasing
  failure rate leading to education experts describing it as a “crisis” that was
  damaging students’ mental health and future prospects. The government is
  expected to revise the policy as part of its national curriculum review
  anticipated to be published later this year. Speaking on the BBC Radio 4’s
  Today programme, Gibb said: It is important that if a young person leaves
  school not having achieved a grade 4 in English and maths, they continue to
  study it, so that they can achieve that qualification. Having a GCSE in
  English and maths transforms life chances of young people, including their
  health and employment prospects … if you think about what’s happened since
  2014 when that policy was introduced by the Conservatives, every year 30,000
  more young people over the age of 16 are getting that qualification. Gibb’s
  defence of the policy comes as the front pages of both the Times and Telegraph
  today drew attention to the likelihood of the policy being scrapped. Catherine
  Sezen, director of education policy for the Association of Colleges, said: We
  must also reflect on the experience of over 130,000 students who did not reach
  that [grade 4] benchmark. Across the country, educators are working hard to
  improve outcomes, yet many are left asking what more can be done. After a
  decade of the condition of funding policy, it is time to rethink how we
  support young people to build essential English and maths skills. Baby food
  manufacturers have been given 18 months to improve the quality of their
  products in England, amid mounting concerns that leading brands are
  nutritionally poor. The new voluntary guidance from the government calls for a
  reduction in sugar and salt levels in food for infants and toddlers. It also
  requests clearer labelling of products to address misleading marketing claims
  that make baby foods seem healthier than they are. This will cover products
  with labels such as “contains no nasties”, which are high in sugar. Others are
  labelled as snacks for babies, which goes against government recommendations
  that children aged six to 12 months do not need snacks between meals, only
  milk. It comes after researchers found that leading brands, such as Ella’s
  Kitchen and Heinz, were making sugar-heavy, nutritionally poor baby food that
  failed to meet the needs of infants. A report by the University of Leeds
  school of food science and nutrition, published in April, found that some
  brands also carried misleading marketing claims, and urged the government to
  impose the same traffic light system found on chocolate bars and ice-cream.
  The report’s authors said the new voluntary guidelines were disappointing and
  would have limited impact. Dr Diane Threapleton, the lead author of the Leeds
  study, said: They’re quite narrow in scope, only looking at sugar and salt.
  But salt is not a major concern in UK baby food. The public health minister,
  Ashley Dalton, said the guidelines would help parents who were often
  “bombarded with confusing labels, disguising unhealthy foods packed with
  hidden sugars and salt”. Prof Simon Kenny, NHS England’s national clinical
  director for children and young people, said: These new guidelines alongside
  clearer labelling will help empower busy parents to make nutritious choices
  that give their children the best possible start in life. Last year a House of
  Lords report found commercial infant foods “are routinely high in sugar and
  marketed misleadingly”. It called on the government to introduce mandatory
  legal standards for commercial infant foods, without input from manufacturers.
  A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said it expected
  manufacturers to meet the labelling guidelines within 18 months, adding: “If
  businesses fail to act, we will consider tougher measures.” Asylum seekers are
  being targeted – and so are those who help them, writes Enver Solomon, chief
  executive of the Refugee Council, in an opinion piece for the Guardian today.
  Solomon says that far-right influencers are menacing charities and individuals
  to further isolate the people they work with and that ensuring safety is now
  part of the job: Deep problems at the UK’s statistics agency with the quality
  of its data are piling pressure on officials in the run-up to the autumn
  budget, sources have told the Guardian. Staff at the Treasury and its
  independent spending watchdog are struggling to get a clear picture of the
  economy because of troubles at the Office for National Statistics (ONS) with
  producing reliable numbers. Such is the concern that insiders at the Office
  for Budget Responsibility (OBR) believe it may have to again highlight
  “significant uncertainty” in its forecasts because of poor official data, as
  it did publicly in March. Economists have also warned that the problems risk
  the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, making tax and spending “missteps”. The OBR
  forecasts are key to the budget process, as they are used to judge the
  headroom the chancellor has against her self-imposed fiscal rules, and form
  the basis for her tax and spending decisions. Its work is also closely watched
  by financial markets. This can affect the cost of borrowing the government
  needs to help fund public services. The ONS, which produces figures on a range
  of indicators including economic growth, inflation and unemployment that are
  used by financial markets and government agencies, is struggling with mounting
  problems as it has delayed or cancelled several of its releases. Its labour
  force survey (LFS) – the official measure of employment in the UK – has been
  beset with problems amid a collapse in response rates. Only this week, it
  postponed the release of retail sales data due on Friday for two weeks “to
  allow for further quality assurance”. Household wealth data has also been
  downgraded and is no longer treated as “official” because of quality concerns.
  The longer the data quality problems persist at the ONS, the more acute the
  challenge becomes, sources familiar with the matter told the Guardian. One
  said: We are, to a significant extent, flying blind on major areas such as the
  jobs market. They added that while other datasets might offer indications of
  the health of employment in the UK, nothing could replace the fundamental role
  of the LFS. Dan Jarvis has vowed the Labour government will meet its 2024
  manifesto commitment to “end asylum hotels”. Asked whether he was “worried
  about any copycat protests” after the high court’s decision this week, the
  security minister told broadcasters: We’ve made a very clear commitment that
  we’re going to close all of the asylum hotels. That was a manifesto commitment
  that we stood on and we will honour. We’re clearing up the legacy that we
  inherited from the previous government but the closures of these hotels need
  to be done in an ordered and managed way. The Home Office will seek to appeal
  against the high court’s refusal to allow it to intervene in the case of a
  hotel used to house asylum seekers in Epping, security minister Dan Jarvis
  said. Jarvis has said closing hotels housing asylum seekers must be done “in a
  managed and ordered way” as he unveiled government plans to challenge the high
  court’s decision related to the Bell hotel in Epping, Essex. He told
  broadcasters: This government will close all asylum hotels and we will clear
  up the mess that we inherited from the previous government. We’ve made a
  commitment that we will close all of the asylum hotels by the end of this
  parliament, but we need to do that in a managed and ordered way. And that’s
  why we’ll appeal this decision. David Lammy has joined 20 other foreign
  ministers around the world in condemning Israeli plans to build an illegal
  settlement on the West Bank, with the Foreign Office summoning the Israeli
  ambassador to communicate the government’s displeasure. The foreign secretary
  co-signed a joint statement on Thursday criticising the so-called E1 plan, a
  3,400-home settlement that critics say would divide the West Bank in half.
  Officials then summoned Tzipi Hotovely to the Foreign Office in a rare public
  rebuke for the Israeli ambassador. The actions marked a further
  intensification of recent international criticism for Israel over its tactics
  in Gaza and the West Bank. The statement, which was signed by 21 countries
  including the UK, Australia, Canada and France, said: The decision by the
  Israeli higher planning committee to approve plans for settlement construction
  in the E1 area, east of Jerusalem, is unacceptable and a violation of
  international law. We condemn this decision and call for its immediate
  reversal in the strongest terms. In a separate statement, the Foreign Office
  confirmed it had summoned Hotovely in a display of public criticism. “If
  implemented, these settlement plans would be a flagrant breach of
  international law and would divide a future Palestinian state in two,
  critically undermining a two-state solution,” the department said in a
  statement. It did not say which minister or official had met Hotovely or what
  was said in the meeting. The Israeli embassy did not respond to a request for
  comment. There has been some reaction to the news that MSP Jeremy Balfour has
  resigned from the Scottish Conservatives (see 9.13am BST). Balfour is the
  second MSP to leave the party in recent months, after Jamie Greene quit the
  Tories in April and joined the Liberal Democrats. According to the PA news
  agency, Greene said of Balfour’s resignation: I was clear back in April when I
  quit the Tories that it was a most unhappy of ships and others would follow my
  exit. Whilst Jeremy and I disagreed on specific issues over the years, I
  respect people who hold views which are clearly borne from life experiences
  and beliefs, as mine are. One wonders how many more former colleagues will
  come to their senses and quit. SNP MSP George Adam said: The Scottish
  Conservatives under Russell Findlay’s disastrous leadership have completely
  fallen apart. It is welcome to see Jeremy Balfour come to his senses on the
  reality of the Tories in Scotland, as they become increasingly extreme to
  pander to the politics of Nigel Farage. With yet another MSP ditching the
  party, it’s clear the Tories are in freefall in Scotland as we approach the
  2026 election. The only question remaining is who’ll be next to desert the
  sinking ship? Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie said: When even a
  social conservative like Jeremy Balfour is saying you are too reactionary, it
  is time to reconsider your politics. Workers at the UK’s third-largest
  steelworks in South Yorkshire have been assured they will receive their pay
  for August as well as unpaid pension contributions, after a
  government-appointed special manager took over the collapsed company. Liberty
  Steel’s main British business, Speciality Steel UK (SSUK), collapsed into
  administration on Thursday afternoon after a high court judge ruled that it
  was insolvent and that its owner, the metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta, had no
  prospects of repaying debts of several hundred million pounds. The judge
  approved an application by the government’s official receiver, a
  representative tasked with winding up insolvent companies, to appoint special
  managers from the advisory company Teneo. A Teneo senior managing director was
  present in court on Thursday, and made contact with Liberty Steel executives
  immediately after the hearing. Concerned union leaders representing SSUK’s
  1,450 workers met the special managers last night, seeking assurances
  particularly on pay and pensions, as well as when operations could restart at
  sites including Rotherham and Stocksbridge in South Yorkshire, after a year
  without work. Roy Rickhuss, the general secretary of Community, the biggest
  steelworking union, said that he had “received firm assurances” on pay and
  pensions. The court heard on Thursday that SSUK had only £650,000 left in its
  bank account, with the August payroll of £3.6m due on Friday. Gupta’s counsel
  had argued that he was ready to cover the payments via another company,
  Liberty Capital UK, although the judge, Mr Justice Mellor, said Gupta’s
  assurances that he could pay “are at best questionable”. The special managers
  have committed that workers will receive their August pay packets before the
  bank holiday weekend. They also said that they will fill in unpaid employer
  pension contributions for the past year. That will remove a major source of
  concern for workers, who had feared losing national insurance protections next
  month if the company were to close. It remains unclear when the plants will
  restart production, although a person briefed on the talks said that the
  special managers had given positive signals that it could happen soon.
  Restarting production and trying to generate cash after four years in which it
  lost £340m will be crucial to limiting the costs of the administration, which
  will be borne temporarily by the government. Scots are being urged to use
  water more efficiency in a bid to protect resources and maintain normal water
  levels, reports the PA news agency. Scottish Water said August was drier than
  normal, and it followed the country’s driest spring in 70 years. It said
  reservoir levels across Scotland are down by 2% to 73% this week, 9% lower
  than the average of 82% for this time of year. The east of Scotland has
  experienced greater water scarcity than the rest of the country, with average
  reservoir levels down 1% to 57% this week – 24% below the average of 81% for
  this time of year. Scottish Water said demand has increased by 100m litres per
  day. The supplier has asked the public to take small precautions to save water
  when possible, such as using watering cans instead of garden hoses, taking
  shorter showers, and turning off the tap when brushing teeth. Washing machines
  and dishwashers should only be used when fully loaded, and buckets and sponges
  should be used to wash cars rather than a hose, it added. Scots use an average
  of 178 litres of water per day, Scottish Water said, which is higher than in
  England and Wales where people use an average of 137 litres per person per
  day, reports the PA news agency. John Griffen, Scottish Water’s water
  operations general manager, said: We’re working hard to maintain normal
  supplies for all customers and would ask that they use water efficiently to
  protect this precious resource. We believe that a large part of the additional
  water use at the moment is in gardens so we would ask that customers are
  mindful of how much water they use there. Any rainfall we have had in parts of
  the country recently has not been prolonged enough to help our resources
  recover from the long spells of dry weather we have had recently and earlier
  this year. With no significant rain forecast for the next week or more, it’s
  important that everyone helps. Scottish Water is now considering the
  possibility of bringing in water from alternative sources at its Backwater and
  Loch of Lintrathen reservoirs, which serve the Dundee and Tayside areas. In
  the West Linton area of the Scottish Borders, Baddinsgill and West Water
  reservoirs – which serve much of West Lothian – are at 50% and 40%, and
  Scottish Water is balancing the flows between both sources. The company is
  also using tankers to supplement normal water supplies in some parts of the
  country. Commenting on the government taking control of the UK’s third-largest
  steelworks, the general secretary of Community union said the “government’s
  intervention must mark a turning point to deliver certainty” for the
  businesses. Roy Rickhuss said in a statement that “jobs must be protected” and
  wages should be paid as well as outstanding pensions contributions being
  secured. He added: We welcome the government’s intervention which is yet
  another demonstration of our Labour government’s commitment to delivering for
  steelworkers and our vital foundation industry. However, in taking control of
  the business the government has assumed responsibility for our livelihoods and
  our communities, and we will of course be holding them to account. In an
  interview on BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland programme on Friday,
  MSP Jeremy Balfour who has resigned from the Scottish Conservatives (see
  9.13am BST), said he feels the party has “lost its way in Scotland” and “I
  don’t think it represents true Conservative values”. According to the PA news
  agency, when asked if Scottish Tory leader Russell Findlay is the right person
  for the job and whether he should stay in the post, he said: Clearly I’m no
  longer a member of the party so that’s no longer a decision for me to make. I
  get on very well as an individual with Russell, I think he’s a good
  individual. Whether he’s the person to lead the Scottish Conservatives is
  obviously for MSPs, for the membership, to decide. But he is an individual I
  like, I just think he’s just not quite yet grasped what the issues are and is
  willing to put forward a vision which is truly Conservative. Balfour said he
  has not yet decided whether he will stand at the next election and will think
  about it over the next few weeks. He said: What I’m very clear about is that
  those with disabilities, other minorities and the people of Lothian need a
  voice for people to hear what we require within our country. I’m not sure any
  party is actually offering that at the moment but whether I stand or not I’ll
  come to a view in the next few weeks. Balfour said he has not thought about
  joining any other party and described himself as a “natural Conservative”, but
  added: It’s the party that’s moved, not me. A Scottish Conservative
  spokesperson said: We are disappointed to read these comments but grateful for
  Jeremy’s service and wish him well. The Scottish Conservatives, under Russell
  Findlay’s leadership, recognise that many people feel completely disconnected
  from politics. It is absolutely critical that our party continues to champion
  commonsense Conservative values and policies that focus on the issues of
  concern to hard-working Scots. All our members and supporters expect us to
  work hard to deliver the change that Scotland needs after 18 years of damaging
  and divisive SNP rule. The Conservatives have lost overall control of Surrey
  county council after losing out to Reform UK and the Liberal Democrats in two
  separate byelection results. The Lib Dems gained the Hinchley Wood, Claygate,
  and Oxshott seat from the Tories, while Reform took the Addlestone seat in
  yesterday’s byelections. Responding to the news that the Conservatives have
  lost overall control of Surrey county council for the first time since the
  1990s, a Lib Dem source said: Kemi Badenoch has presided over a Surrey
  shambles. The Conservatives are sliding to defeat – it’s no wonder they ran
  scared and delayed the elections until next year. If the Conservatives cannot
  keep control of Surrey, nowhere is safe for them. Voters in Surrey are backing
  the Liberal Democrats’ community politics over the Conservatives, just as they
  did in the general election. The results of the byelections are: Hinchley
  Wood, Claygate and Oxshott byelection results – Thursday, 21 August 2025 Andy
  Burton (Liberal Democrats): 38% Andrew Burley (Local Conservatives): 31% Mary
  Susan Marshall (Independent): 15% Nicholas David Wood (Reform UK): 13% Sarah
  Coomes (the Green party): 2% Irene Threlkeld (Labour): 1% Addlestone
  byelection results– Thursday, 21 August 2025 Scott Michael Kelly (Reform UK):
  34% Shannon Saise-Marshall (Conservative): 24% Mike Smith (Liberal Democrats):
  17% Steven Lee Ringham (the Green party): 16% Arran Richard Neathey (Labour
  and Co-operative): 8% Diane Abbott has said she advised her longtime friend
  Jeremy Corbyn not to launch a new political party because she believed it
  would struggle to make inroads under the first-past-the-post system. Abbott,
  the MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, said last month she would not be
  leaving Labour in favour of Corbyn’s as yet unnamed party, despite the pair
  having worked closely together in the past. Speaking at the Edinburgh
  international book festival in conversation with the campaigner and
  commentator Talat Yaqoob, Abbott confirmed she had spoken to Corbyn before the
  party’s launch to warn him against it. She said: There were people around
  Jeremy encouraging him to set up a new party and I told him not to. It’s very
  difficult under the first-past-the-post system for a new party to absolutely
  win. If it wasn’t first past the post then you can see how a new party could
  come through, but I understand why he did it. Abbott described Zarah Sultana,
  the independent MP launching the new party with Corbyn, as a “lovely person
  who is full of energy”. She said the party could get votes and support from
  people who were “not necessarily leftwing” but were “disappointed about the
  way [Labour has] gone in the past year”. Abbott, who as the longest-serving
  female MP has the honorary title of mother of the house, is suspended by
  Labour. She lost the party whip in April 2023 after she wrote a letter to the
  Observer in which she argued that Jewish, Irish and Traveller people
  experienced prejudice but not racism, and likened their experience to that of
  people with red hair. She said the letter published was a draft version and
  that her comments had been taken out of context. She was readmitted to the
  party in time to hold her seat at the general election. But she was suspended
  again last month after telling the BBC in an interview that she did not regret
  the remarks. Abbott said in Edinburgh: I think she and Jeremy are a great
  combination but at this point in time, it’s difficult to see how a brand new
  party wins. However, I think Jeremy’s party is going to do a lot better than
  people think, because a lot of people are not necessarily terribly leftwing.
  People are a tiny bit disappointed about the way we’ve gone in the past year.
  Asked whether she thought she would ever be accepted at the heart of the
  Labour party, Abbott said: I think I am at the heart of the Labour party, it’s
  other people who aren’t. Elon Musk’s company, Tesla, should have its
  application to supply energy to UK homes blocked on national security grounds,
  Ed Davey has told ministers. The Liberal Democrat leader argued that giving
  the electric car manufacturer a foothold in the British energy market would be
  “a gravely concerning move considering Elon Musk’s repeated interference in UK
  politics”. Tesla has a clean energy arm and applied in July for a licence to
  supply power to British homes. If the licence is granted by the regulator,
  Ofgem, the US company could be competing with big UK domestic energy suppliers
  such as British Gas and Octopus as soon as next year. In a letter to the
  energy secretary, Ed Miliband, Sir Ed cited comments by Musk on social media
  appearing to encourage violent riots in the UK last summer, and accused the
  Tesla CEO of “peddling misinformation to millions”. Musk, in a series of posts
  after last summer’s riots that followed the deadly mass stabbing in Southport,
  wrote that “civil war is inevitable” in the UK, which he labelled a
  “tyrannical police state”. He has expressed sympathy with the far-right
  activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon. The Daily
  Mirror reported in January that the Home Office’s homeland security group was
  monitoring social media posts by Musk as a possible security risk. Civil
  servants in a government department are to strike in a dispute over office
  closures, recruitment and attendance policies, reports the PA news agency. The
  Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) said more than 1,100 of its members
  in the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) will take
  industrial action on 1 September. Smaller groups of union members will strike
  from 2 to 25 September. The union said it is campaigning to stop a number of
  office closures as well as other issues such as remote working. PCS general
  secretary Fran Heathcote said: Office closures do nothing to serve the
  department’s goal of tackling regional inequalities. Ministers will see staff
  speak with their feet when they return from recess. Senior management have
  been clear – they will not seek to resolve this dispute without ministerial
  direction. An MHCLG spokesperson said: We have engaged and continue to engage
  extensively with unions and staff to resolve this dispute, and do not believe
  the current action is an appropriate response to the issues raised. We will
  continue to have an office in every English region as well as Scotland, Wales
  and Northern Ireland, and all staff affected will be able to continue in their
  roles. The approach to office attendance is replicated across the civil
  service and has not changed since early 2024. Thousands of people living
  abroad will have their child benefit stopped as the government clamps down on
  people wrongly claiming the payment, reports the PA news agency. People who
  leave the UK for more than eight weeks are no longer eligible for the benefit,
  other than in exceptional circumstances, but some continue to claim it
  incorrectly. According to the PA news agency, ministers have announced that a
  specialist team scouring international travel data and 200,000 child benefit
  records to find wrongful payments will be significantly expanded in an attempt
  to save more money. It follows a successful trial in which 15 investigators
  stopped 2,600 people receiving the benefit after moving abroad, saving around
  £17m over the past year. That team will now be increased to more than 200
  investigators, with the Cabinet Office suggesting this could see “tens of
  thousands” of people lose the benefit and save £350m over the next five years.
  Cabinet Office minister Georgia Gould said: From September, we’ll have 10
  times as many investigators saving hundreds of millions of pounds of
  taxpayers’ money. If you’re claiming benefits you’re not entitled to, your
  time is up. Child benefit is the most widely accessed benefit in the UK and is
  paid to more than 6.9 million families, supporting 11.9 million children. The
  government has made cracking down on wrongful benefit payments a significant
  part of its efforts to cut costs, with overpayments estimated to have cost
  £9.5bn in the year to March. These efforts include the public authorities
  (fraud, error and recovery) bill currently making its way through parliament.
  Ministers have billed the legislation as delivering the “biggest ever
  crackdown on fraud against the public purse”, including measures that allow
  the government to recover money directly from fraudsters’ bank accounts. GMB
  has urged the government to “take a stake” in the future of Liberty Steel
  after assuming control of its Speciality Steels UK (SSUK) division. The PA
  news agency reports that Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, GMB national officer, told
  BBC Breakfast that recent developments show why public ownership or greater
  government control is needed. She said: What has happened at Liberty Steel is
  again another example of when the government does not have a stake in these
  important national assets, they are at the whim of often international owners
  that have profit above people and don’t have a stake in the UK national
  infrastructure. GMB would like to see government take a stake in the ownership
  of Liberty Steel and ultimately have a say in its future. Brumpton-Childs said
  staff faced “huge uncertainty” in the aftermath of the government taking
  control of the UK’s third-largest steelworks and that court cases meant
  workers had been left in limbo for months. She told BBC Breakfast: It’s been a
  yo-yo, where we’ve never been really sure what the court decision was going to
  be. We’ve sort of expected this insolvency decision several times over the
  last couple of months and I think it’s been really hard for everyone because
  you can’t predict what a judge is going to say. The mayor of South Yorkshire
  said there has been “interest from companies” who may want to “take on” steel
  sites after the government had to take control of the operation, reports the
  PA news agency. The high court confirmed on Thursday that Speciality Steel –
  previously part of Sanjeev Gupta’s Liberty Steel business – would face a
  compulsory liquidation. It has plants in Rotherham and Stocksbridge. Labour
  mayor Oliver Coppard told BBC Breakfast: We’ve got a team that we’ve stood up
  in my office, we’ve been working with the government’s steel team to make sure
  that we know exactly what’s going on here in terms of the assets that are on
  the table. We’ve had interest from companies who we know who want to take on
  these sites. There’s other interests besides the ones that have come through
  my office, so we’re talking to the government all the time. In a seperate
  interview on Thursday, Coppard said the government taking control of the UK’s
  third-largest steelworks was “good news” but that a conclusion should not be
  rushed. Speaking in Sheffield, he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: The
  government stepping in to take control now is good news because it just brings
  to an end the uncertainty that we’ve seen on the sites. I think that was the
  thing that was killing the business slowly, we now have that uncertainty
  brought to an end, that’s a good thing. But I now need the government to make
  sure that these three sites, two in Rotherham and one here, have the brightest
  possible future. So, we have to get a new owner in, the government, I think,
  should take their time over that process, not a neverending amount of time,
  but certainly not rush to a conclusion, to give people on the site that future
  that they deserve. Scottish Conservative MSP Jeremy Balfour has resigned from
  the party and will sit as an independent, reports the PA news agency. In his
  resignation letter to party leader Russell Findlay, Balfour said the Scottish
  Conservatives have “fallen into the trap of reactionary politics” and that a
  “positive, proactive agenda for real change” has been rejected. Balfour said
  he intends to continue to represent his constituents in the Lothian region for
  the remainder of the parliamentary session as an independent MSP. In his
  letter, also posted on social media, Balfour said he has made the decision to
  resign with immediate effect with a “heavy heart”. However he said: I no
  longer feel that the party has a positive platform to offer the people of
  Scotland. Dozens of protests outside hotels used as temporary accommodation
  for asylum seekers are expected over the weekend across England amid mounting
  tensions over the issue. Figures released on Thursday showed there were more
  than 32,000 asylum seekers in hotels, marking a rise of 8% during Labour’s
  first year in office. Anti-migrant protests and counter-demonstrations held by
  Stand Up to Racism are expected on Friday outside hotels believed to be used
  to house asylum seekers, including in Bournemouth, Cardiff and Leeds, with
  more expected on Saturday. Meanwhile, councils across the country controlled
  by Labour, the Conservatives and Reform UK are investigating whether they
  could pursue legal challenges against asylum hotels. Chris Philp, the shadow
  home secretary, said on Thursday that people had “every right” to protest over
  asylum hotels in their areas. While the number of asylum seekers rose in
  Labour’s first year, the new data shows they are still far below the 2023
  peak, when the Conservatives were in government. Labour has pledged to end the
  use of hotels to house asylum seekers by the end of this parliament in 2029.
  The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, insisted Labour had taken “crucial steps”
  in the past year towards this by cutting the asylum backlog and money spent on
  the asylum system, increasing returns of asylum seekers whose applications had
  failed, and overhauling appeals. We will update this blog with any news from
  the protests and counter-protests. Elsewhere, shadow home office minister
  Katie Lam has been on the morning media round for Conservatives and Labour
  mayor Oliver Coppard has been speaking to reporters about Speciality Steel, a
  steelworks that has been taken over by the government in an attempt to save
  jobs. More on this in a moment. In other developments: David Lammy has joined
  20 other foreign ministers around the world in condemning Israeli plans to
  build an illegal settlement on the West Bank, with the Foreign Office
  summoning the Israeli ambassador to communicate the government’s displeasure.
  The foreign secretary co-signed a joint statement on Thursday criticising the
  so-called E1 plan, a 3,400-home settlement that critics say would divide the
  West Bank in half. Protesters at the next mass demonstration against the ban
  on Palestine Action will withhold their details from officers to force
  en-masse processing at police stations in an effort to make it “practically
  impossible” to arrest everyone. On Friday, Defend Our Juries, the pressure
  group behind the protests, will open sign-ups for its next demonstration to be
  held in London on 6 September. Elon Musk’s company, Tesla, should have its
  application to supply energy to UK homes blocked on national security grounds,
  Ed Davey has told ministers. The Liberal Democrat leader argued that giving
  the electric car manufacturer a foothold in the British energy market would be
  “a gravely concerning move considering Elon Musk’s repeated interference in UK
  politics”.

This live blog will be closing shortly. Thank you for reading the updates and commenting below the line. You can keep up to date with the Guardian’s UK politics coverage here. Here is a summary from today’s blog: The Home Office will seek to appeal against the high court’s refusal to allow it to intervene in the case of a hotel used to house asylum seekers in Epping, security minister Dan Jarvis said. Jarvis said closing hotels housing asylum seekers must be done “in a managed and ordered way” as he unveiled government plans to challenge the high court’s decision related to the Bell hotel in Epping, Essex. On Friday, Yvette Cooper said ministers are working to close hotels housing asylum seekers “as swiftly as possible” as part of an “orderly” programme that avoids creating problems for other areas. Cooper reiterated Labour’s manifesto commitment to end the use of hotels to accommodate asylum seekers. She also accused the previous Conservative government of presiding over a “chaotic and disorderly situation” in 2022 that saw “140 extra hotels were opened in the space of six months because they lost control of the system”. Heather Whitbread, Conservative councillor for the Epping West and Rural ward, hit back at Yvette Cooper’s warning, saying that the court ruling was “a decision on a planning point”, accusing the hotel owner of breaking planning law and insisting it was the council’s job to enforce regulations. The Home Office’s plan to appeal against the high court’s Epping asylum hotel ruling “is completely wrong”, Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp has said. He accused the government of not “listening to the public or to the courts”. Foreign secretary David Lammy has described the declaration of famine in Gaza City as “utterly horrifying” as he accused the Israeli government of causing a “man-made catastrophe”. Lammy also repeated calls for “an immediate ceasefire, to enable aid delivery at maximum speed and at the scale required”, including a halt to military operations in Gaza City. Lammy has joined 20 other foreign ministers around the world in condemning Israeli plans to build an illegal settlement on the West Bank, with the Foreign Office summoning the Israeli ambassador to communicate the government’s displeasure. The foreign secretary co-signed a joint statement on Thursday criticising the so-called E1 plan, a 3,400-home settlement that critics say would divide the West Bank in half. Dozens of protests outside hotels used as temporary accommodation for asylum seekers are expected over the weekend across England amid mounting tensions over the issue. Anti-migrant protests and counter-demonstrations held by Stand Up to Racism are expected on Friday outside hotels believed to be used to house asylum seekers, including in Bournemouth, Cardiff and Leeds, with more expected on Saturday. Workers at the UK’s third-largest steelworks in South Yorkshire have been assured they will receive their pay for August as well as unpaid pension contributions, after a government-appointed special manager took over the collapsed company. Liberty Steel’s main British business, Speciality Steel UK (SSUK), collapsed into administration on Thursday afternoon after a high court judge ruled that it was insolvent and that its owner, the metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta, had no prospects of repaying debts of several hundred million pounds. The Conservatives have lost overall control of Surrey county council after losing out to Reform UK and the Liberal Democrats in two separate byelection results. The Lib Dems gained the Hinchley Wood, Claygate, and Oxshott seat from the Tories, while Reform took the Addlestone seat in yesterday’s byelections. Scottish Conservative MSP Jeremy Balfour has resigned from the party and will sit as an independent. In his resignation letter to party leader Russell Findlay, Balfour said the Scottish Conservatives had “fallen into the trap of reactionary politics” and that a “positive, proactive agenda for real change” had been rejected. A Scottish Conservative spokesperson said: “We are disappointed to read these comments but grateful for Jeremy’s service and wish him well.” Deep problems at the UK’s statistics agency with the quality of its data are piling pressure on officials in the run-up to the autumn budget, sources have told the Guardian. Staff at the Treasury and its independent spending watchdog are struggling to get a clear picture of the economy because of troubles at the Office for National Statistics (ONS) with producing reliable numbers. GMB has urged the government to “take a stake” in the future of Liberty Steel after assuming control of its Speciality Steels UK (SSUK) division. Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, GMB national officer, told BBC Breakfast that recent developments show why public ownership or greater government control is needed. Separately, the mayor of South Yorkshire said the government taking control of the UK’s third-largest steelworks was “good news” but that a conclusion should not be rushed. Elon Musk’s company, Tesla, should have its application to supply energy to UK homes blocked on national security grounds, Ed Davey has told ministers. The Liberal Democrat leader argued that giving the electric car manufacturer a foothold in the British energy market would be “a gravely concerning move considering Elon Musk’s repeated interference in UK politics”. Baby food manufacturers have been given 18 months to improve the quality of their products in England, amid mounting concerns that leading brands are nutritionally poor. The new voluntary guidance from the government calls for a reduction in sugar and salt levels in food for infants and toddlers. Nick Gibb, the former Conservative education minister, defended resits for students who fail to pass their maths and English GCSEs after the policy came under fire following new data showing that just 17% of those forced to retake had managed to achieve a grade 4 or above this year. The policy for pupils in England dates back to Gibb’s time as education minister. Ministers have announced a clampdown on people who continue to claim child benefit payments even though they have moved abroad, in measures that could save the taxpayer £350m over five years. The government said 2,600 people who had left the UK but still claimed the benefit had already been removed from the welfare system. Diane Abbott has said she advised her longtime friend Jeremy Corbyn not to launch a new political party because she believed it would struggle to make inroads under the first-past-the-post system. Abbott, the MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, said last month she would not be leaving Labour in favour of Corbyn’s as yet unnamed party, despite the pair having worked closely together in the past. A professor of public policy has said managing relationships between the UK government and Holyrood has to be a priority in the upcoming Scottish election – especially if it results in a minority administration. Speaking at a Festival of Politics event at the Scottish parliament about expectations and concerns for the Holyrood poll next May, Prof Nicola McEwen said that relationships across parties have become increasingly strained. Civil servants in a government department are to strike in a dispute over office closures, recruitment and attendance policies. The Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) said more than 1,100 of its members in the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) will take industrial action on 1 September. Smaller groups of union members will strike from 2 to 25 September. Scots are being urged to use water more efficiency in a bid to protect resources and maintain normal water levels. Scottish Water said August was drier than normal, and it followed the country’s driest spring in 70 years. It said reservoir levels across Scotland are down by 2% to 73% this week, 9% lower than the average of 82% for this time of year. Closing asylum hotels must be “orderly” rather than through “piecemeal court decisions”, the home secretary has said as the government plans to appeal against a court ruling blocking the use of an Epping hotel. The Home Office will seek to appeal against the high court’s refusal to allow it to intervene in the case, and to then further appeal against the temporary injunction. On Friday, Yvette Cooper said ministers are working to close hotels housing asylum seekers “as swiftly as possible” as part of an “orderly” programme that avoids creating problems for other areas, reports the PA news agency. Cooper said: We agree with communities across the country that all asylum hotels need to close, including the Bell hotel, and we are working to do so as swiftly as possible as part of an orderly, planned and sustained programme that avoids simply creating problems for other areas or local councils as a result of piecemeal court decisions or a return to the kind of chaos which led to so many hotels being opened in the first place. That is the reason for the Home Office appeal in this case, to ensure that going forward, the closure of all hotels can be done in a properly managed way right across the country – without creating problems for other areas and local councils. Cooper reiterated Labour’s manifesto commitment to end the use of hotels to accommodate asylum seekers. She also accused the previous Conservative government of presiding over a “chaotic and disorderly situation” in 2022 that saw “140 extra hotels were opened in the space of six months because they lost control of the system”. Foreign secretary David Lammy has described the declaration of famine in Gaza City as “utterly horrifying” as he accused the Israeli government of causing a “man-made catastrophe”, reports the PA news agency. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said on Friday that famine is occurring in Gaza City and could spread farther south. It comes after weeks of warnings by aid groups that restrictions on aid were leading to starvation among Palestinians. In a statement on Friday afternoon, Lammy said: The confirmation of famine in Gaza City and the surrounding neighbourhood is utterly horrifying and is wholly preventable. The Israeli government’s refusal to allow sufficient aid into Gaza has caused this man-made catastrophe. This is a moral outrage. The IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification) report makes clear the sickening consequences, especially for children. The government of Israel can and must immediately act to stop the situation deteriorating any further. It must immediately and sustainably allow unhindered food, medical supplies, fuel, and all types of aid to reach those who so desperately need them. It is the first time that the IPC has confirmed a famine in the Middle East. The IPC report said that more than half a million people in Gaza face catastrophic levels of hunger, and many are at risk of dying from malnutrition-related causes. Lammy also repeated calls for “an immediate ceasefire, to enable aid delivery at maximum speed and at the scale required”, including a halt to military operations in Gaza City. He added: The UK reiterates its condemnation of this military action, which will only worsen the already catastrophic humanitarian situation and endanger the lives of the hostages held by Hamas. We urge the Israeli government to change course and halt its plans. This terrible conflict must end. An immediate and permanent ceasefire is the only way to stop the suffering, secure the release of the hostages, achieve a surge in aid and deliver a framework for lasting peace. According to the PA news agency, Heather Whitbread, Conservative councillor for the Epping West and Rural ward, has hit back at Yvette Cooper’s warning that asylum hotels must be closed “in a properly managed way”. She said the row was “a decision on a planning point”, accusing the hotel owner of breaking planning law and insisting it was the council’s job to enforce regulations. Whitbread warned that waiting until the end of parliament to close hotels was “too long”, adding: Our community can’t afford to wait another four years. She said the protests had already caused “a huge amount of disruption” and argued the hotel’s use as asylum accommodation was “untenable” and unsafe for both residents and the wider Epping community. Dozens of immigration protesters have faced off with anti-racism demonstrators in Portsmouth. According to the PA news agency Rita, a Portsmouth resident who joined the Stand Up to Racism counter-protest said: I feel ashamed [at the protest] and I say this as a white British elderly lady who has been spat upon, verbally abused and had things thrown at me, just for being on this side of the road. I am angry that my Christianity is being used as a weapon by the right and to be used in the name of fascism. The Home Office’s plan to appeal against the high court’s Epping asylum hotel ruling “is completely wrong”, Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp has said. According to the PA news agency, he said: The Epping Bell hotel injunction has been a victory for local people, led by a Conservative council working hard for their community. This is the difference Conservatives in local government deliver. In opposition, Labour worked hand-in-glove with activist lawyers to sabotage Conservative immigration plans. In government, nothing has changed. It is completely wrong that the Labour government is taking legal action to keep open the Bell hotel. The Government isn’t listening to the public or to the courts. Instead of trying to keep illegal immigrants in expensive hotels, the Conservatives would remove all illegal arrivals, put in place a real deterrent and ensure towns like Epping are never put in this position again. A professor of public policy has said managing relationships between the UK government and Holyrood has to be a priority in the upcoming Scottish election – especially if it results in a minority administration, reports the PA news agency. Speaking at a Festival of Politics event at the Scottish parliament about expectations and concerns for the Holyrood poll next May, Prof Nicola McEwen said that relationships across parties have become increasingly strained. She said: I think we can be pretty confident that we will end up with a fragmented parliament where there is not a single party majority. We will have a parliament of minorities – nothing new in that – but I think we will have a parliament of minorities that may find it more difficult to work across party lines. Partly because of the nature of relationships that have emerged over recent years, and we have seen an increasing polarisation among the parties. Prof McEwen is a professor of public policy and governance at the University of Glasgow, director of the Centre for Public Policy, and senior fellow at the UK In A Changing Europe thinktank. She leads research on devolution and inter-institutional relations and provides advice to governments and public bodies. According to the PA news agency, Prof McEwen advised that relationships across parties and between the UK and Scottish governments need to be prioritised in order for Holyrood to be able to successfully deliver on policies. She said: Even if there was a majority government – there won’t be, but even if there was – the Scottish government cannot deliver things alone. It tends to set the framework and relies a lot on delivery partners, and a very big partner in that is local government. There’s the relationship between the Scottish government and UK government. It’s an area I’ve done quite a lot of research on over the years, and the relationship particularly before the general election was dire. That’s a problem, because it really matters … There are so many areas of policy that are still reserved, but they have an impact on the responsibilities of this parliament. She added: Managing that relationship has to be a priority for any administration in Scotland. That has been better since the last election since the change of government, but there are still challenges and still issues. Nick Gibb, the former Conservative education minister, defended resits for students who fail to pass their maths and English GCSEs after the policy came under fire following new data showing that just 17% of those forced to retake had managed to achieve a grade 4 or above this year. The policy for pupils in England dates back to Gibb’s time as education minister, with the increasing failure rate leading to education experts describing it as a “crisis” that was damaging students’ mental health and future prospects. The government is expected to revise the policy as part of its national curriculum review anticipated to be published later this year. Speaking on the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Gibb said: It is important that if a young person leaves school not having achieved a grade 4 in English and maths, they continue to study it, so that they can achieve that qualification. Having a GCSE in English and maths transforms life chances of young people, including their health and employment prospects … if you think about what’s happened since 2014 when that policy was introduced by the Conservatives, every year 30,000 more young people over the age of 16 are getting that qualification. Gibb’s defence of the policy comes as the front pages of both the Times and Telegraph today drew attention to the likelihood of the policy being scrapped. Catherine Sezen, director of education policy for the Association of Colleges, said: We must also reflect on the experience of over 130,000 students who did not reach that [grade 4] benchmark. Across the country, educators are working hard to improve outcomes, yet many are left asking what more can be done. After a decade of the condition of funding policy, it is time to rethink how we support young people to build essential English and maths skills. Baby food manufacturers have been given 18 months to improve the quality of their products in England, amid mounting concerns that leading brands are nutritionally poor. The new voluntary guidance from the government calls for a reduction in sugar and salt levels in food for infants and toddlers. It also requests clearer labelling of products to address misleading marketing claims that make baby foods seem healthier than they are. This will cover products with labels such as “contains no nasties”, which are high in sugar. Others are labelled as snacks for babies, which goes against government recommendations that children aged six to 12 months do not need snacks between meals, only milk. It comes after researchers found that leading brands, such as Ella’s Kitchen and Heinz, were making sugar-heavy, nutritionally poor baby food that failed to meet the needs of infants. A report by the University of Leeds school of food science and nutrition, published in April, found that some brands also carried misleading marketing claims, and urged the government to impose the same traffic light system found on chocolate bars and ice-cream. The report’s authors said the new voluntary guidelines were disappointing and would have limited impact. Dr Diane Threapleton, the lead author of the Leeds study, said: They’re quite narrow in scope, only looking at sugar and salt. But salt is not a major concern in UK baby food. The public health minister, Ashley Dalton, said the guidelines would help parents who were often “bombarded with confusing labels, disguising unhealthy foods packed with hidden sugars and salt”. Prof Simon Kenny, NHS England’s national clinical director for children and young people, said: These new guidelines alongside clearer labelling will help empower busy parents to make nutritious choices that give their children the best possible start in life. Last year a House of Lords report found commercial infant foods “are routinely high in sugar and marketed misleadingly”. It called on the government to introduce mandatory legal standards for commercial infant foods, without input from manufacturers. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said it expected manufacturers to meet the labelling guidelines within 18 months, adding: “If businesses fail to act, we will consider tougher measures.” Asylum seekers are being targeted – and so are those who help them, writes Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, in an opinion piece for the Guardian today. Solomon says that far-right influencers are menacing charities and individuals to further isolate the people they work with and that ensuring safety is now part of the job: Deep problems at the UK’s statistics agency with the quality of its data are piling pressure on officials in the run-up to the autumn budget, sources have told the Guardian. Staff at the Treasury and its independent spending watchdog are struggling to get a clear picture of the economy because of troubles at the Office for National Statistics (ONS) with producing reliable numbers. Such is the concern that insiders at the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) believe it may have to again highlight “significant uncertainty” in its forecasts because of poor official data, as it did publicly in March. Economists have also warned that the problems risk the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, making tax and spending “missteps”. The OBR forecasts are key to the budget process, as they are used to judge the headroom the chancellor has against her self-imposed fiscal rules, and form the basis for her tax and spending decisions. Its work is also closely watched by financial markets. This can affect the cost of borrowing the government needs to help fund public services. The ONS, which produces figures on a range of indicators including economic growth, inflation and unemployment that are used by financial markets and government agencies, is struggling with mounting problems as it has delayed or cancelled several of its releases. Its labour force survey (LFS) – the official measure of employment in the UK – has been beset with problems amid a collapse in response rates. Only this week, it postponed the release of retail sales data due on Friday for two weeks “to allow for further quality assurance”. Household wealth data has also been downgraded and is no longer treated as “official” because of quality concerns. The longer the data quality problems persist at the ONS, the more acute the challenge becomes, sources familiar with the matter told the Guardian. One said: We are, to a significant extent, flying blind on major areas such as the jobs market. They added that while other datasets might offer indications of the health of employment in the UK, nothing could replace the fundamental role of the LFS. Dan Jarvis has vowed the Labour government will meet its 2024 manifesto commitment to “end asylum hotels”. Asked whether he was “worried about any copycat protests” after the high court’s decision this week, the security minister told broadcasters: We’ve made a very clear commitment that we’re going to close all of the asylum hotels. That was a manifesto commitment that we stood on and we will honour. We’re clearing up the legacy that we inherited from the previous government but the closures of these hotels need to be done in an ordered and managed way. The Home Office will seek to appeal against the high court’s refusal to allow it to intervene in the case of a hotel used to house asylum seekers in Epping, security minister Dan Jarvis said. Jarvis has said closing hotels housing asylum seekers must be done “in a managed and ordered way” as he unveiled government plans to challenge the high court’s decision related to the Bell hotel in Epping, Essex. He told broadcasters: This government will close all asylum hotels and we will clear up the mess that we inherited from the previous government. We’ve made a commitment that we will close all of the asylum hotels by the end of this parliament, but we need to do that in a managed and ordered way. And that’s why we’ll appeal this decision. David Lammy has joined 20 other foreign ministers around the world in condemning Israeli plans to build an illegal settlement on the West Bank, with the Foreign Office summoning the Israeli ambassador to communicate the government’s displeasure. The foreign secretary co-signed a joint statement on Thursday criticising the so-called E1 plan, a 3,400-home settlement that critics say would divide the West Bank in half. Officials then summoned Tzipi Hotovely to the Foreign Office in a rare public rebuke for the Israeli ambassador. The actions marked a further intensification of recent international criticism for Israel over its tactics in Gaza and the West Bank. The statement, which was signed by 21 countries including the UK, Australia, Canada and France, said: The decision by the Israeli higher planning committee to approve plans for settlement construction in the E1 area, east of Jerusalem, is unacceptable and a violation of international law. We condemn this decision and call for its immediate reversal in the strongest terms. In a separate statement, the Foreign Office confirmed it had summoned Hotovely in a display of public criticism. “If implemented, these settlement plans would be a flagrant breach of international law and would divide a future Palestinian state in two, critically undermining a two-state solution,” the department said in a statement. It did not say which minister or official had met Hotovely or what was said in the meeting. The Israeli embassy did not respond to a request for comment. There has been some reaction to the news that MSP Jeremy Balfour has resigned from the Scottish Conservatives (see 9.13am BST). Balfour is the second MSP to leave the party in recent months, after Jamie Greene quit the Tories in April and joined the Liberal Democrats. According to the PA news agency, Greene said of Balfour’s resignation: I was clear back in April when I quit the Tories that it was a most unhappy of ships and others would follow my exit. Whilst Jeremy and I disagreed on specific issues over the years, I respect people who hold views which are clearly borne from life experiences and beliefs, as mine are. One wonders how many more former colleagues will come to their senses and quit. SNP MSP George Adam said: The Scottish Conservatives under Russell Findlay’s disastrous leadership have completely fallen apart. It is welcome to see Jeremy Balfour come to his senses on the reality of the Tories in Scotland, as they become increasingly extreme to pander to the politics of Nigel Farage. With yet another MSP ditching the party, it’s clear the Tories are in freefall in Scotland as we approach the 2026 election. The only question remaining is who’ll be next to desert the sinking ship? Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie said: When even a social conservative like Jeremy Balfour is saying you are too reactionary, it is time to reconsider your politics. Workers at the UK’s third-largest steelworks in South Yorkshire have been assured they will receive their pay for August as well as unpaid pension contributions, after a government-appointed special manager took over the collapsed company. Liberty Steel’s main British business, Speciality Steel UK (SSUK), collapsed into administration on Thursday afternoon after a high court judge ruled that it was insolvent and that its owner, the metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta, had no prospects of repaying debts of several hundred million pounds. The judge approved an application by the government’s official receiver, a representative tasked with winding up insolvent companies, to appoint special managers from the advisory company Teneo. A Teneo senior managing director was present in court on Thursday, and made contact with Liberty Steel executives immediately after the hearing. Concerned union leaders representing SSUK’s 1,450 workers met the special managers last night, seeking assurances particularly on pay and pensions, as well as when operations could restart at sites including Rotherham and Stocksbridge in South Yorkshire, after a year without work. Roy Rickhuss, the general secretary of Community, the biggest steelworking union, said that he had “received firm assurances” on pay and pensions. The court heard on Thursday that SSUK had only £650,000 left in its bank account, with the August payroll of £3.6m due on Friday. Gupta’s counsel had argued that he was ready to cover the payments via another company, Liberty Capital UK, although the judge, Mr Justice Mellor, said Gupta’s assurances that he could pay “are at best questionable”. The special managers have committed that workers will receive their August pay packets before the bank holiday weekend. They also said that they will fill in unpaid employer pension contributions for the past year. That will remove a major source of concern for workers, who had feared losing national insurance protections next month if the company were to close. It remains unclear when the plants will restart production, although a person briefed on the talks said that the special managers had given positive signals that it could happen soon. Restarting production and trying to generate cash after four years in which it lost £340m will be crucial to limiting the costs of the administration, which will be borne temporarily by the government. Scots are being urged to use water more efficiency in a bid to protect resources and maintain normal water levels, reports the PA news agency. Scottish Water said August was drier than normal, and it followed the country’s driest spring in 70 years. It said reservoir levels across Scotland are down by 2% to 73% this week, 9% lower than the average of 82% for this time of year. The east of Scotland has experienced greater water scarcity than the rest of the country, with average reservoir levels down 1% to 57% this week – 24% below the average of 81% for this time of year. Scottish Water said demand has increased by 100m litres per day. The supplier has asked the public to take small precautions to save water when possible, such as using watering cans instead of garden hoses, taking shorter showers, and turning off the tap when brushing teeth. Washing machines and dishwashers should only be used when fully loaded, and buckets and sponges should be used to wash cars rather than a hose, it added. Scots use an average of 178 litres of water per day, Scottish Water said, which is higher than in England and Wales where people use an average of 137 litres per person per day, reports the PA news agency. John Griffen, Scottish Water’s water operations general manager, said: We’re working hard to maintain normal supplies for all customers and would ask that they use water efficiently to protect this precious resource. We believe that a large part of the additional water use at the moment is in gardens so we would ask that customers are mindful of how much water they use there. Any rainfall we have had in parts of the country recently has not been prolonged enough to help our resources recover from the long spells of dry weather we have had recently and earlier this year. With no significant rain forecast for the next week or more, it’s important that everyone helps. Scottish Water is now considering the possibility of bringing in water from alternative sources at its Backwater and Loch of Lintrathen reservoirs, which serve the Dundee and Tayside areas. In the West Linton area of the Scottish Borders, Baddinsgill and West Water reservoirs – which serve much of West Lothian – are at 50% and 40%, and Scottish Water is balancing the flows between both sources. The company is also using tankers to supplement normal water supplies in some parts of the country. Commenting on the government taking control of the UK’s third-largest steelworks, the general secretary of Community union said the “government’s intervention must mark a turning point to deliver certainty” for the businesses. Roy Rickhuss said in a statement that “jobs must be protected” and wages should be paid as well as outstanding pensions contributions being secured. He added: We welcome the government’s intervention which is yet another demonstration of our Labour government’s commitment to delivering for steelworkers and our vital foundation industry. However, in taking control of the business the government has assumed responsibility for our livelihoods and our communities, and we will of course be holding them to account. In an interview on BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland programme on Friday, MSP Jeremy Balfour who has resigned from the Scottish Conservatives (see 9.13am BST), said he feels the party has “lost its way in Scotland” and “I don’t think it represents true Conservative values”. According to the PA news agency, when asked if Scottish Tory leader Russell Findlay is the right person for the job and whether he should stay in the post, he said: Clearly I’m no longer a member of the party so that’s no longer a decision for me to make. I get on very well as an individual with Russell, I think he’s a good individual. Whether he’s the person to lead the Scottish Conservatives is obviously for MSPs, for the membership, to decide. But he is an individual I like, I just think he’s just not quite yet grasped what the issues are and is willing to put forward a vision which is truly Conservative. Balfour said he has not yet decided whether he will stand at the next election and will think about it over the next few weeks. He said: What I’m very clear about is that those with disabilities, other minorities and the people of Lothian need a voice for people to hear what we require within our country. I’m not sure any party is actually offering that at the moment but whether I stand or not I’ll come to a view in the next few weeks. Balfour said he has not thought about joining any other party and described himself as a “natural Conservative”, but added: It’s the party that’s moved, not me. A Scottish Conservative spokesperson said: We are disappointed to read these comments but grateful for Jeremy’s service and wish him well. The Scottish Conservatives, under Russell Findlay’s leadership, recognise that many people feel completely disconnected from politics. It is absolutely critical that our party continues to champion commonsense Conservative values and policies that focus on the issues of concern to hard-working Scots. All our members and supporters expect us to work hard to deliver the change that Scotland needs after 18 years of damaging and divisive SNP rule. The Conservatives have lost overall control of Surrey county council after losing out to Reform UK and the Liberal Democrats in two separate byelection results. The Lib Dems gained the Hinchley Wood, Claygate, and Oxshott seat from the Tories, while Reform took the Addlestone seat in yesterday’s byelections. Responding to the news that the Conservatives have lost overall control of Surrey county council for the first time since the 1990s, a Lib Dem source said: Kemi Badenoch has presided over a Surrey shambles. The Conservatives are sliding to defeat – it’s no wonder they ran scared and delayed the elections until next year. If the Conservatives cannot keep control of Surrey, nowhere is safe for them. Voters in Surrey are backing the Liberal Democrats’ community politics over the Conservatives, just as they did in the general election. The results of the byelections are: Hinchley Wood, Claygate and Oxshott byelection results – Thursday, 21 August 2025 Andy Burton (Liberal Democrats): 38% Andrew Burley (Local Conservatives): 31% Mary Susan Marshall (Independent): 15% Nicholas David Wood (Reform UK): 13% Sarah Coomes (the Green party): 2% Irene Threlkeld (Labour): 1% Addlestone byelection results– Thursday, 21 August 2025 Scott Michael Kelly (Reform UK): 34% Shannon Saise-Marshall (Conservative): 24% Mike Smith (Liberal Democrats): 17% Steven Lee Ringham (the Green party): 16% Arran Richard Neathey (Labour and Co-operative): 8% Diane Abbott has said she advised her longtime friend Jeremy Corbyn not to launch a new political party because she believed it would struggle to make inroads under the first-past-the-post system. Abbott, the MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, said last month she would not be leaving Labour in favour of Corbyn’s as yet unnamed party, despite the pair having worked closely together in the past. Speaking at the Edinburgh international book festival in conversation with the campaigner and commentator Talat Yaqoob, Abbott confirmed she had spoken to Corbyn before the party’s launch to warn him against it. She said: There were people around Jeremy encouraging him to set up a new party and I told him not to. It’s very difficult under the first-past-the-post system for a new party to absolutely win. If it wasn’t first past the post then you can see how a new party could come through, but I understand why he did it. Abbott described Zarah Sultana, the independent MP launching the new party with Corbyn, as a “lovely person who is full of energy”. She said the party could get votes and support from people who were “not necessarily leftwing” but were “disappointed about the way [Labour has] gone in the past year”. Abbott, who as the longest-serving female MP has the honorary title of mother of the house, is suspended by Labour. She lost the party whip in April 2023 after she wrote a letter to the Observer in which she argued that Jewish, Irish and Traveller people experienced prejudice but not racism, and likened their experience to that of people with red hair. She said the letter published was a draft version and that her comments had been taken out of context. She was readmitted to the party in time to hold her seat at the general election. But she was suspended again last month after telling the BBC in an interview that she did not regret the remarks. Abbott said in Edinburgh: I think she and Jeremy are a great combination but at this point in time, it’s difficult to see how a brand new party wins. However, I think Jeremy’s party is going to do a lot better than people think, because a lot of people are not necessarily terribly leftwing. People are a tiny bit disappointed about the way we’ve gone in the past year. Asked whether she thought she would ever be accepted at the heart of the Labour party, Abbott said: I think I am at the heart of the Labour party, it’s other people who aren’t. Elon Musk’s company, Tesla, should have its application to supply energy to UK homes blocked on national security grounds, Ed Davey has told ministers. The Liberal Democrat leader argued that giving the electric car manufacturer a foothold in the British energy market would be “a gravely concerning move considering Elon Musk’s repeated interference in UK politics”. Tesla has a clean energy arm and applied in July for a licence to supply power to British homes. If the licence is granted by the regulator, Ofgem, the US company could be competing with big UK domestic energy suppliers such as British Gas and Octopus as soon as next year. In a letter to the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, Sir Ed cited comments by Musk on social media appearing to encourage violent riots in the UK last summer, and accused the Tesla CEO of “peddling misinformation to millions”. Musk, in a series of posts after last summer’s riots that followed the deadly mass stabbing in Southport, wrote that “civil war is inevitable” in the UK, which he labelled a “tyrannical police state”. He has expressed sympathy with the far-right activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon. The Daily Mirror reported in January that the Home Office’s homeland security group was monitoring social media posts by Musk as a possible security risk. Civil servants in a government department are to strike in a dispute over office closures, recruitment and attendance policies, reports the PA news agency. The Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) said more than 1,100 of its members in the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) will take industrial action on 1 September. Smaller groups of union members will strike from 2 to 25 September. The union said it is campaigning to stop a number of office closures as well as other issues such as remote working. PCS general secretary Fran Heathcote said: Office closures do nothing to serve the department’s goal of tackling regional inequalities. Ministers will see staff speak with their feet when they return from recess. Senior management have been clear – they will not seek to resolve this dispute without ministerial direction. An MHCLG spokesperson said: We have engaged and continue to engage extensively with unions and staff to resolve this dispute, and do not believe the current action is an appropriate response to the issues raised. We will continue to have an office in every English region as well as Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and all staff affected will be able to continue in their roles. The approach to office attendance is replicated across the civil service and has not changed since early 2024. Thousands of people living abroad will have their child benefit stopped as the government clamps down on people wrongly claiming the payment, reports the PA news agency. People who leave the UK for more than eight weeks are no longer eligible for the benefit, other than in exceptional circumstances, but some continue to claim it incorrectly. According to the PA news agency, ministers have announced that a specialist team scouring international travel data and 200,000 child benefit records to find wrongful payments will be significantly expanded in an attempt to save more money. It follows a successful trial in which 15 investigators stopped 2,600 people receiving the benefit after moving abroad, saving around £17m over the past year. That team will now be increased to more than 200 investigators, with the Cabinet Office suggesting this could see “tens of thousands” of people lose the benefit and save £350m over the next five years. Cabinet Office minister Georgia Gould said: From September, we’ll have 10 times as many investigators saving hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money. If you’re claiming benefits you’re not entitled to, your time is up. Child benefit is the most widely accessed benefit in the UK and is paid to more than 6.9 million families, supporting 11.9 million children. The government has made cracking down on wrongful benefit payments a significant part of its efforts to cut costs, with overpayments estimated to have cost £9.5bn in the year to March. These efforts include the public authorities (fraud, error and recovery) bill currently making its way through parliament. Ministers have billed the legislation as delivering the “biggest ever crackdown on fraud against the public purse”, including measures that allow the government to recover money directly from fraudsters’ bank accounts. GMB has urged the government to “take a stake” in the future of Liberty Steel after assuming control of its Speciality Steels UK (SSUK) division. The PA news agency reports that Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, GMB national officer, told BBC Breakfast that recent developments show why public ownership or greater government control is needed. She said: What has happened at Liberty Steel is again another example of when the government does not have a stake in these important national assets, they are at the whim of often international owners that have profit above people and don’t have a stake in the UK national infrastructure. GMB would like to see government take a stake in the ownership of Liberty Steel and ultimately have a say in its future. Brumpton-Childs said staff faced “huge uncertainty” in the aftermath of the government taking control of the UK’s third-largest steelworks and that court cases meant workers had been left in limbo for months. She told BBC Breakfast: It’s been a yo-yo, where we’ve never been really sure what the court decision was going to be. We’ve sort of expected this insolvency decision several times over the last couple of months and I think it’s been really hard for everyone because you can’t predict what a judge is going to say. The mayor of South Yorkshire said there has been “interest from companies” who may want to “take on” steel sites after the government had to take control of the operation, reports the PA news agency. The high court confirmed on Thursday that Speciality Steel – previously part of Sanjeev Gupta’s Liberty Steel business – would face a compulsory liquidation. It has plants in Rotherham and Stocksbridge. Labour mayor Oliver Coppard told BBC Breakfast: We’ve got a team that we’ve stood up in my office, we’ve been working with the government’s steel team to make sure that we know exactly what’s going on here in terms of the assets that are on the table. We’ve had interest from companies who we know who want to take on these sites. There’s other interests besides the ones that have come through my office, so we’re talking to the government all the time. In a seperate interview on Thursday, Coppard said the government taking control of the UK’s third-largest steelworks was “good news” but that a conclusion should not be rushed. Speaking in Sheffield, he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: The government stepping in to take control now is good news because it just brings to an end the uncertainty that we’ve seen on the sites. I think that was the thing that was killing the business slowly, we now have that uncertainty brought to an end, that’s a good thing. But I now need the government to make sure that these three sites, two in Rotherham and one here, have the brightest possible future. So, we have to get a new owner in, the government, I think, should take their time over that process, not a neverending amount of time, but certainly not rush to a conclusion, to give people on the site that future that they deserve. Scottish Conservative MSP Jeremy Balfour has resigned from the party and will sit as an independent, reports the PA news agency. In his resignation letter to party leader Russell Findlay, Balfour said the Scottish Conservatives have “fallen into the trap of reactionary politics” and that a “positive, proactive agenda for real change” has been rejected. Balfour said he intends to continue to represent his constituents in the Lothian region for the remainder of the parliamentary session as an independent MSP. In his letter, also posted on social media, Balfour said he has made the decision to resign with immediate effect with a “heavy heart”. However he said: I no longer feel that the party has a positive platform to offer the people of Scotland. Dozens of protests outside hotels used as temporary accommodation for asylum seekers are expected over the weekend across England amid mounting tensions over the issue. Figures released on Thursday showed there were more than 32,000 asylum seekers in hotels, marking a rise of 8% during Labour’s first year in office. Anti-migrant protests and counter-demonstrations held by Stand Up to Racism are expected on Friday outside hotels believed to be used to house asylum seekers, including in Bournemouth, Cardiff and Leeds, with more expected on Saturday. Meanwhile, councils across the country controlled by Labour, the Conservatives and Reform UK are investigating whether they could pursue legal challenges against asylum hotels. Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said on Thursday that people had “every right” to protest over asylum hotels in their areas. While the number of asylum seekers rose in Labour’s first year, the new data shows they are still far below the 2023 peak, when the Conservatives were in government. Labour has pledged to end the use of hotels to house asylum seekers by the end of this parliament in 2029. The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, insisted Labour had taken “crucial steps” in the past year towards this by cutting the asylum backlog and money spent on the asylum system, increasing returns of asylum seekers whose applications had failed, and overhauling appeals. We will update this blog with any news from the protests and counter-protests. Elsewhere, shadow home office minister Katie Lam has been on the morning media round for Conservatives and Labour mayor Oliver Coppard has been speaking to reporters about Speciality Steel, a steelworks that has been taken over by the government in an attempt to save jobs. More on this in a moment. In other developments: David Lammy has joined 20 other foreign ministers around the world in condemning Israeli plans to build an illegal settlement on the West Bank, with the Foreign Office summoning the Israeli ambassador to communicate the government’s displeasure. The foreign secretary co-signed a joint statement on Thursday criticising the so-called E1 plan, a 3,400-home settlement that critics say would divide the West Bank in half. Protesters at the next mass demonstration against the ban on Palestine Action will withhold their details from officers to force en-masse processing at police stations in an effort to make it “practically impossible” to arrest everyone. On Friday, Defend Our Juries, the pressure group behind the protests, will open sign-ups for its next demonstration to be held in London on 6 September. Elon Musk’s company, Tesla, should have its application to supply energy to UK homes blocked on national security grounds, Ed Davey has told ministers. The Liberal Democrat leader argued that giving the electric car manufacturer a foothold in the British energy market would be “a gravely concerning move considering Elon Musk’s repeated interference in UK politics”.
