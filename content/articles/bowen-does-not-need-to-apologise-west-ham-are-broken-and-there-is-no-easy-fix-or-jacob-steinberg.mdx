  Jarrod Bowen said sorry after losing his cool with a couple of fans at the end
  of West Ham’s defeat by Wolves in the Carabao Cup, but anyone with any sense
  knows the forward has no need to apologise. The malaise has nothing to do with
  the player who scored the winner in the Conference League final two years ago.
  Quite frankly, West Ham are lucky Bowen is not pushing to leave. Nobody could
  blame the captain were he to decide enough is enough after years of atrocious
  recruitment and poor appointments from the people at the top. This slump has
  been a long time coming. Some fans are fuming but a lot have grown apathetic.
  Mass walkouts feel very particular to the London Stadium. There was another
  one last Friday, much of the crowd following West Ham’s lead by giving up
  early as Chelsea rained in the goals. Humiliations have become so commonplace
  in E20 that many supporters wonder whether there are better things to do than
  watch their bungling team get pummelled at a soulless imitation of a football
  ground. Bowen deserves better. West Ham are broken and there is no easy fix.
  The rot is deep and relegation is on the cards unless something drastic
  happens before the transfer window shuts on Monday. Even then, it would be
  hard to disagree with the view that substantial change will remain elusive
  until David Sullivan, the club’s most dominant figure over the past 15 years,
  sells his shares. A big stadium means nothing when the wider infrastructure
  remains so dysfunctional. West Ham are being left behind by Bournemouth,
  Brentford and Brighton. They look stale and outdated. Their recruitment is
  chaotic, with too many voices competing for attention. Multiple sources say
  that certain agents continue to have Sullivan’s ear, trying to influence his
  judgment on signings and managers. None of this absolves Graham Potter and his
  trusted head of recruitment, Kyle Macaulay, of blame. Potter has lost 12 of
  his 22 games since replacing Julen Lopetegui as head coach in January. His
  3-4-2-1 has left a ponderous midfield even more exposed. West Ham have
  conceded 11 goals in their first three games and have no resilience. It was
  obvious Wolves were going to win once they made it 2-2. In Potter’s defence he
  inherited a poor squad from Lopetegui, who inherited an ageing squad from
  David Moyes, who inherited an unbalanced squad from Manuel Pellegrini.
  Underinvestment is not the issue. West Ham are working with a limited budget
  this summer but they have spent in recent years. It shows that one of
  Sullivan’s biggest failings is who he chooses to empower. Parting company with
  Moyes in 2024 was not the mistake; it was not having a proper succession plan.
  Lopetegui was an awful choice, just as Tim Steidten was a dismal pick as
  technical director a year earlier. Moyes spent badly on expensive signings in
  2022. Steidten did not live up to his reputation. The German’s biggest
  contribution was his role in blowing the £105m received for Declan Rice. For
  some people, putting Steidten in charge was the worst mistake Sullivan has
  made. The former Bayer Leverkusen man’s work includes spending £27.5m on the
  underwhelming striker Niclas Füllkrug and bestowing upon West Ham the
  snail-paced midfield of Guido Rodríguez and Edson Álvarez. He also turned down
  an opportunity to sign Dean Huijsen before the centre-back joined Bournemouth,
  who sold him to Real Madrid for a huge profit a year later. There are plenty
  of stories like that. Jørgen Strand Larsen and Marc Cucurella also got away.
  There was interest in Mateus Fernandes before the midfielder’s £12m move to
  Southampton, who are now telling West Ham they can have him – for £60m. The
  damage was done by the time Steidten made way for Macaulay. The flaws in West
  Ham’s recruitment are evident in no one wanting to buy their players. The sale
  of Mohammed Kudus to Tottenham for £54.5m this summer came from a position of
  weakness. West Ham had to sell to buy but the only useful offers came for
  Kudus. This is a squad cobbled together by an assortment of people. West Ham
  are stuck with expensive, underperforming centre-backs. They had to accept a
  loan for Álvarez and are yet to sell the 31-year-old Rodríguez. This was never
  a one-window fix, but Potter and Macaulay have made the situation worse this
  summer. The place is undisciplined. It is staggering to hear that a current
  player has criticised the club to potential targets. Potter focused on
  banishing the toxicity in the dressing room during pre-season but the problems
  have not gone away. Lucas Paquetá, who is of interest to Tottenham, is open to
  leaving. There is bemusement that Potter and Macaulay do not appear to have
  prioritised strengthening the midfield. West Ham instead spent much of their
  budget on the Senegal left-back El Hadji Malick Diouf and the Denmark
  goalkeeper Mads Hermansen, who has struggled since joining from Leicester for
  £15m. These are buys that should have been made only after the vast hole in
  midfield was filled. Now West Ham are panicking. Multiple sources say Sullivan
  started the summer determined to let Potter and Macaulay do what they wanted.
  Callum Wilson was not a Potter pick but he could have blocked the 33-year-old
  striker’s arrival on a free transfer. The narrative about interference from
  above is disputed. It is felt that Potter and Macaulay set their sights too
  high. They are accused of naivety, of misjudging West Ham’s appeal to talents
  such as Jacob Ramsey and Harvey Elliott. Time has been wasted. Chelsea thought
  it was a joke when West Ham bid for Andrey Santos last week. West Ham were
  advised not to go in for Barcelona’s Marc Casadó before bidding for the
  midfielder. It is not clear why a powerful striker has not been targeted,
  while a new winger would help given that Crysencio Summerville has been out
  since January. Kudus has not been replaced. His departure has left West Ham
  dependent on Paquetá and Bowen for creativity. Potter can argue that his shift
  to a controlled possession style will work once he has the players to fit his
  system. He needs time, but the clock is ticking. Macaulay is said to be under
  pressure to prove himself to Sullivan. The 76-year-old has resisted the
  temptation to impose players on Potter and Macaulay so far – he relented when
  it came to Hermansen, signing him instead of the Botafogo goalkeeper John
  Victor, who West Ham are now trying to bring in on loan – but some expect
  Sullivan to become more dominant. Macaulay and Potter will hope that buying
  the Monaco midfielder Soungoutou Magassa shifts the mood. They are also trying
  to sign a fast striker. A swift turnaround in results is needed. A few more
  defeats will likely lead to Potter’s sacking. But what would another
  managerial change achieve? Sullivan will still be making the appointments. He
  has never shown an inclination to pay compensation for an in-demand manager.
  It is always someone unemployed. It will be more of the same.
