  Dozens of people suspected of throwing bricks and attacking members of the
  public during last summer’s riots are still wanted by police forces across
  England. The police have launched a webpage with images of 40 people they are
  seeking in relation to rioting provoked by the far right after the Southport
  murders. Pockets of disorder broke out outside hotels housing asylum seekers
  and mosques across England and Northern Ireland when false rumours spread
  online that the killer of three young girls in the Merseyside town was a
  foreign-born Muslim. Far-right influencers urged their followers on to the
  streets, where rioters set alight buildings, destroyed property and attacked
  members of the public and the police. The unrest led to 1,876 people being
  arrested, with 1,110 charged so far, the National Police Chiefs’ Council said.
  However, a further 40 people are still sought by five forces – Merseyside,
  Greater Manchester, Cleveland, Northumbria and Avon and Somerset – with police
  calling on the public to help them identify the people in the pictures.
  Assistant chief constable Ian Drummond-Smith, who led the national
  investigation in response to the riots, told the PA Media news agency: “We
  have a duty to facilitate protest … but what we saw last year, and in a few
  isolated cases this year, is where it’s gone to criminality and to serious
  disorder. “In those cases what I think we can learn from last year is that
  justice will be swift, and I hope that that would be a deterrent to anyone
  thinking about engaging in serious disorder this year. “We’ve made effective
  use of CCTV [and] bodyworn video, and we’ve been able to bring a lot of people
  in front of the courts.” Drummond-Smith also said officers were working “very
  hard” to contain “small pockets” of disorder this year. “I think they’ve been
  isolated because of a swift police response to them, and I think that’s the
  key thing,” he said. “If we can respond to serious disorder swiftly, I think
  we can contain that and prevent it from spreading across the country, so
  that’s what we’re working very hard on.” He added: “We’ve sharpened up our
  ability to mobilise quickly and move resources around the country so we can
  achieve that quicker.” Last summer’s disturbances were denounced at the time
  by the prime minister, Keir Starmer, as “far-right thuggery”. The national
  appeal follows calls on local and social media that also shared images of
  individuals, but proved unsuccessful. Drummond-Smith said this may be because
  the people concerned travelled from another part of the country and were not
  known where the disturbances took place. “One year on, we’ve still got some
  people who we have got good images of and we haven’t yet identified,” he said.
  “Having a good image of someone is one thing, knowing who they are is another.
  We’re asking the public to have a look, and if they recognise anyone in those
  images, to let us know who they are and bring them to justice.”
