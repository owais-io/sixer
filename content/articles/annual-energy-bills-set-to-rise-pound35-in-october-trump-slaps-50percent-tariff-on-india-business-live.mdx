  The UK government has just sold £5bn worth in three-year bonds in a scheduled
  action. Demand was good, with the auction covered 3.16 times. The bonds were
  sold with a yield of 4.375%, due in 2028. The gilt market has been rocky
  lately, with yield on the 30-year bond trading close to its highest level
  since 1998 yesterday, at 5.62%. Yields rise when prices fall. The yield on the
  30-year rose to as high as 5.627% in early trading this morning, but it has
  since recovered, with the yield now at 5.583%. Mohit Kumar, an analyst at the
  investment broker Jefferies, paints a gloomy picture of the UK’s economic
  outlook: We have held a negative view on the UK fiscal picture and maintain
  the view. We see UK growth disappointing relative to official forecasts which
  would leave the Chancellor with a bigger budget hole than current official
  forecast suggests. Tax rises look inevitable in the Autumn statement. However,
  we are approaching levels where further tax rises start becoming
  counterproductive. Producer output price inflation rose to 1.9% in the year to
  June, up from a revised rise of 0.7% in the year to April 2025, according to
  the Office for National Statistics. The ONS suspended the publication of its
  producer price indices in March, after it found calculation errors dating back
  to 2020. The figures published today represent interim data before it resumes
  regular publication in October. The statistics agency said in July that
  producer price inflation in previous years had been higher than originally
  calculated. It comes as pressure grows on the ONS over the reliability of its
  data. Staff at the Treasury and its independent spending watchdog have said
  they are struggling to get a clear picture of the economy because of problems
  at the ONS with producing reliable numbers. Shares in utility stocks are
  rising this morning after the energy regulator Ofgem announced that it will
  increase its price cap on bills by 2% from October. National Grid, SSE and
  Severn Trent are all up roughly 1% this morning, among the best performers in
  the UK’s blue chip FTSE 100 index. But overall the FTSE is not moving much, up
  very slightly by 0.03%. Over in Europe, the Stoxx 600 index is up 0.4%. The
  French Cac 40 share index recovered 0.4%, after a fall earlier in the week
  over concerns around the potential collapse of Prime Minister François
  Bayrou’s government. Turning back to energy bills, several UK charities are
  warning that the 2% rise in the energy price cap (which covers England, Wales
  and Scotland) will hurt vulnerable people. Official figures showed in May that
  energy bill defaults hit a record high, with 2.7% of direct debits for gas and
  electricity failing due to lack of funds. Disability equality charity Scope
  has said millions of disabled people are being pushed into deeper fuel poverty
  as prices continue to rise. Abdi Mohamed, head of policy at the charity, said:
  Life costs more if you are disabled – on average an extra £1,095 a month. We
  hear from disabled people every day who tell us they are unable to power vital
  medical and mobility equipment, facing increasing pain and losing their
  independence. The current support available for disabled people barely
  scratches the surface. And many no longer get the warm home discount at all,
  despite enormous energy costs. The government must act with urgency to close
  the devastating gap in support and tackle this crisis. Joanna Elson, chief
  executive of the charity Independent Age, argued political intervention is
  urgently needed, and that the warm homes discount should be extended to at
  least 2027. She said: Far too often older people in financial hardship are bed
  bound by the cold, turning in early for the night dressed in hats and scarves
  in a desperate bid to keep warm through the winter months. …The situation is
  dire, in the UK over one million older households are living in fuel poverty.
  The people in later life we speak to are making drastic and dangerous cutbacks
  because they cannot afford their energy bills. They are routinely switching
  off heating systems for weeks on end, visiting public places to stay warm and
  cutting down on food so they can pay their energy bills. This is unacceptable.
  Jon Sparkes, chief executive of the learning disability charity Mencap, said:
  People with a learning disability simply must be protected from ever
  increasing energy costs, or they face being pushed into fuel poverty, unable
  to stay safe, warm and healthy. The 1.5 million people in the UK with a
  learning disability are more likely to have unavoidably high energy costs
  because they may need to charge specialist or medical equipment or heat their
  homes for longer. …With bill prices set to increase even further this autumn,
  people with a learning disability and their families will continue to face
  these dangerous choices which leave them feeling anxious and afraid. Lego has
  built a bigger share of the toy market as sales rose 12% in the first six
  months of the year after its Botanicals and Grand Prix-themed sets helped it
  attract adults as well as children. As sales increased to 34.6bn Danish Kroner
  (£4bn), the company, which is known for its colourful building bricks, said it
  would open a new $1.5bn US factory and distribution centre in 2027, its
  seventh factory worldwide. The company previously said it was not bringing
  forward the development of the factory despite new import tariffs introduced
  by the Trump administration this year. The group opened a new site in Vietnam
  earlier this year and expanded factories in Mexico and Hungary to meet demand.
  Lego’s net profit increased 10% to 6.5bn Danish Kroner as the company said it
  had signed deals to produce toys linked to the Bluey and Pokémon cartoon
  series and launched the She Built That campaign to encourage girls to use Lego
  creatively. Niels B. Christiansen, the chief executive, said: We are very
  pleased to have maintained our strong performance in the first half of 2025,
  winning share in the global toy market. This growth is driven by our large and
  innovative range of products that continues to be relevant across ages and
  interests. Shares in Rio Tinto have ticked up 1% this morning after the
  miner’s new boss, Simon Trott, announced he will combine some of its biggest
  businesses in an effort to simplify the group, just two days after taking
  leadership of the company. Rio will reorganise into three divisions: iron ore,
  aluminium and lithium, and copper, the company said on Wednesday. Trott, who
  took over from Jakob Stausholm on 25 August, previously led Rio’s iron ore
  operations in northwest Australia, which make up more than half its earnings.
  The Anglo-Australian miner has recently been trying to diversify its business,
  acquiring the US lithium producer Arcadium Lithium in a $6.7 billion deal
  earlier this year. It has made Rio one of the biggest producers of the
  battery-making metal in the world, alongside Albemarle and SQM. Thames Water
  has agreed a payment plan with the water regulator for fines it owes worth
  £123m, as it races to secure funding to avoid temporary government
  nationalisation. The water company, which serves 16 million customers across
  London and the south-east, is currently racing to pull together a deal to
  avoid collapse. Earlier this month the government approved the appointment of
  insolvency advisers FTI Consulting to consult on plans for Thames Water to be
  placed into a special administration regime (SAR). The debt-laden utility firm
  was hit with a record £104m fine by Ofwat in May over environmental breaches
  involving sewage spills, after failing to operate and manage its treatment
  works and wastewater networks effectively. At the same time, a further £18.2m
  fine was levied on Thames for breaking dividend rules, the first penalty of
  its kind in the water industry. Ofwat said the company had paid out cash to
  investors despite having fallen short in its services to customers and its
  environmental record. The penalties were originally due to be paid by 20
  August but the regulator has given the company some breathing space to pay the
  fines. Ofwat had previously told Thames the penalties had to be “paid by the
  company and its investors, and not by customers”. The regulator has approved
  Thames’ request for a payment plan, which will see it pay £24.5m, or 20% of
  the penalties, by the end of September, with the rest to be paid later. Lidl
  has invested £435m in warehouses in Leeds and London, developments it says
  will create more than 500 new jobs. The supermarket has completed its
  extension of its Belvedere warehouse site in London, which now has 800,000 sq
  ft, a 167% increase compared with when it opened in 2003. Last month Lidl also
  started construction at a 38-acre site in Gildersome, Leeds, with a new
  warehouse there expected to create 400 new jobs. The expansion at the site in
  London will create 120 new jobs, Lidl said. It comes after the Resolution
  Foundation, a think tank, predicted the unemployment rate could hit 5% in the
  three months ended in August, the highest level since the start of 2021. The
  official unemployment rate was 4.7% in the last quarter. Chancellor Rachel
  Reeves praised Lidl’s investment as “a strong vote of confidence in the UK
  economy”, though economists have warned that Britain faces serious challenges
  due to its weak underlying growth and a drop in the number of workers since
  the pandemic. Reeves said: Lidl’s commitment to new warehouse facilities in
  London and Leeds will unlock hundreds of new jobs, strengthen supply chains,
  and ensure families can access affordable, quality food. Through our Plan for
  Change we’re backing business and working in partnership to deliver growth and
  opportunity in communities across the country. Over on the corporate front in
  the UK, fashion retailer JD Sports has reported a 3% drop in like-for-like
  sales in the 13 weeks ended on 2 August. Chief executive Régis Schultz said
  the company was going up against tough comparators in Europe and the UK from
  the Euros football tournament last year, but “across our regions and fascias,
  in general we see a resilient consumer, albeit very selective on their
  purchases.” The retailer also said that it would launch another £100m share
  buyback. Elsewhere, miner Rio Tinto’s new chief executive Simon Trott has
  announced that he will combine some of its biggest businesses in an effort to
  simplify the group. Rio will reorganise into three divisions: iron ore,
  aluminium and lithium, and copper, the company said on Wednesday. Trott said:
  A simplified business structure, grounded in our fundamental commitment to
  safety and with sharper focus on the most compelling opportunities we have,
  will enable us to deliver new standards of operational excellence and value
  creation. While another rise in energy bills will be unwelcome news for many,
  analysts at the consultancy Cornwall Insight have said that prices could fall
  under the next cap, which would start in January 2026. Dr Craig Lowrey, of
  Cornwall Insight, said: There is better news on the horizon with bills
  currently expected to ease in January, driven by a forecast fall in wholesale
  prices. Normally, that drop would have meant even lower bills, however, rising
  policy costs, such as funding for new nuclear projects are keeping bills a
  little higher. These policy-driven costs are part of a broader shift in how we
  fund the energy transition. Nuclear will be one of the cornerstones of a more
  secure and sustainable energy system, yet some of the funding will ultimately
  need to come from billpayers. This is a difficult trade off - after all,
  everyone wants to see bills come down. However, the challenge we face is
  clear: if we want to build a resilient, low-carbon energy future, we must be
  prepared to invest in it today.” The energy regulator for Britain, Ofgem, has
  said it will increase the cap on energy bills from October by 2%, the
  equivalent of a £35 rise in annual bills for the average home. Here’s more
  details of the energy price cap just announced, from Ofgem. Electricity rates
  If you are on a standard variable tariff (default tariff) and pay for your
  electricity by Direct Debit, you will pay on average 26.35p pence per kilowatt
  hour (kWh). The daily standing charge is 53.68 pence per day. This is based on
  the average across England, Scotland and Wales and includes VAT. Gas rates If
  you are on a standard variable tariff (default tariff) and pay for your gas by
  Direct Debit, you will pay on average 6.29 pence per kilowatt hour (kWh). The
  daily standing charge is 34.03 pence per day. This is based on the average
  across England, Scotland and Wales and includes VAT. Why energy prices have
  gone up Volatile global wholesale prices for energy are partly behind the
  increase, as well as the cost of the government’s expansion of its warm home
  discount policy. Tim Jarvis, director general for Markets at Ofgem, says:
  While there is still more to do, we are seeing signs of a healthier market.
  There are more people on fixed tariffs saving themselves money, switching is
  rising as options for consumers increase, and we’ve seen increases in customer
  satisfaction, alongside a reduction in complaints. While today’s change is
  below inflation, we know customers might not be feeling it in their pockets.
  There are things you can do though – consider a fixed tariff as this could
  save more than £200 against the new cap. Paying by direct debit or smart pay
  as you go could also save you money. In the longer term, we will continue to
  see fluctuations in our energy prices until we are insulated from volatile
  international gas markets. That’s why we continue to work with government and
  the sector to diversify our energy mix to reduce the reliance on markets we do
  not control. Jarvis, speaking to Radio 4’s Today programme, also noted that
  the cost of running the network and the expansion of the government’s warm
  home discount scheme had also driven the rise in the cap. The rise in energy
  costs will hit people already struggling to pay their household bills, warns
  National Energy Action, the fuel poverty charity. Michael Penhaligon, of the
  NEA, says: Every day my colleagues and I speak to people in desperate
  circumstances. They can’t afford the very basics of heat and power. They are
  rationing their energy usage and they’re cutting back on food and other
  essentials. The individuals I speak to are left to rely on foodbanks, fuel
  vouchers and other charitable grants to help restore them to a basic standard
  of living. This shouldn’t be happening in the UK in 2025. Some may say that
  the cap rising around £35 won’t have an impact but the people I speak to
  already can’t afford their bills and many of them are deep in debt. This can
  have a huge impact on their mental and physical wellbeing. A rise in bills
  just as temperatures start to drop will put even more pressure on households.
  My colleagues and I achieve amazing outcomes for households to help them
  afford their energy; we get debt written off, we get them access to benefits
  they are entitled to, and we liaise with their suppliers on their behalf. But
  the scale and depth of fuel poverty is far beyond the remit of any charity.
  Newsflash: The energy price cap on bills across Great Britain will rise by 2%
  in October, regulator Ofgem has announced. This will lift the average annual
  cost of electricity and gas for a typical household to £1,755 per year. This
  is the fourth consecutive hike in the cap on gas and electricity charges, and
  is slightly higher than analysts had just expected. The cap limits the amount
  which a supplier can charge for a unit of electricity or gas. Good morning,
  and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the
  world economy. The cost of living could be about to get even tighter, as
  households find out whether their energy bills will rise again this autumn.
  Ofgem, the energy regulator, is due to announce the latest price cap on the
  cost of a unit of energy at 7am. Analysts expect the cap to rise due to recent
  increases in wholesale gas and electricity prices. Consultancy Cornwall
  Insight have predicted Ofgem will increase the cap by about 1% to £1,737 a
  year for a dual-fuel household, from the current level of £1,720. A rise in
  energy prices would act as yet another driver for high inflation. Official
  figures showed last week that UK inflation rose in July to a
  higher-than-expected 3.8% amid higher food prices and travel costs. It marked
  the 10th consecutive month that inflation has sat above the Bank of England’s
  2% target. The new cap will come into effect in October and remain in place
  until the end of the year. The energy price cap sets the maximum that a
  supplier can charge for a unit of energy (there’s no cap on how high a bill
  can go). Elsewhere, overnight Donald Trump has imposed 50% tariffs on most US
  imports from India, following through on his threat to punish one of the
  world’s largest economies over its purchases of discounted Russian oil. The
  tariffs, which came into effect just after midnight on Wednesday in
  Washington, risk inflicting significant damage on the Indian economy and
  further disrupting global supply chains. US tariffs of 25% on Indian goods
  went into force earlier this month, but Trump announced plans to double the
  rate, citing India’s purchases of Russian oil, which the White House has
  argued is indirectly funding Russia’s war against Ukraine. The agenda 7:00AM

Newsflash: The energy price cap on bills across Great Britain will rise by 2% in October, regulator Ofgem has announced. This will lift the average annual cost of electricity and gas for a typical household to £1,755 per year. This is the fourth consecutive hike in the cap on gas and electricity charges, and is slightly higher than analysts had just expected. The cap limits the amount which a supplier can charge for a unit of electricity or gas. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The cost of living could be about to get even tighter, as households find out whether their energy bills will rise again this autumn. Ofgem, the energy regulator, is due to announce the latest price cap on the cost of a unit of energy at 7am. Analysts expect the cap to rise due to recent increases in wholesale gas and electricity prices. Consultancy Cornwall Insight have predicted Ofgem will increase the cap by about 1% to £1,737 a year for a dual-fuel household, from the current level of £1,720. A rise in energy prices would act as yet another driver for high inflation. Official figures showed last week that UK inflation rose in July to a higher-than-expected 3.8% amid higher food prices and travel costs. It marked the 10th consecutive month that inflation has sat above the Bank of England’s 2% target. The new cap will come into effect in October and remain in place until the end of the year. The energy price cap sets the maximum that a supplier can charge for a unit of energy (there’s no cap on how high a bill can go). Elsewhere, overnight Donald Trump has imposed 50% tariffs on most US imports from India, following through on his threat to punish one of the world’s largest economies over its purchases of discounted Russian oil. The tariffs, which came into effect just after midnight on Wednesday in Washington, risk inflicting significant damage on the Indian economy and further disrupting global supply chains. US tariffs of 25% on Indian goods went into force earlier this month, but Trump announced plans to double the rate, citing India’s purchases of Russian oil, which the White House has argued is indirectly funding Russia’s war against Ukraine.
