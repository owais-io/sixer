  Resistance is growing to Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, with the mayor
  of Chicago, Brandon Johnson, signing an executive order to counter the
  president’s move. The order prevents the Chicago police department from
  collaborating with federal authorities on patrols, immigration enforcement, or
  conducting traffic stops and checkpoints. It also restricts officers from
  wearing face coverings to hide their identities. Johnson has accused the
  president of “behaving outside the bounds of the constitution” and of being
  “reckless and out of control”, while the White House insists the potential
  flood of federal agents is about “cracking down on crime”. “If these Democrats
  focused on fixing crime in their own cities instead of doing publicity stunts
  to criticize the president, their communities would be much safer,” said White
  House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson. Here are the key stories. Chicago mayor

  country’s third-largest city, which could take place within days. The Chicago
  police department will be barred from helping federal authorities with civil
