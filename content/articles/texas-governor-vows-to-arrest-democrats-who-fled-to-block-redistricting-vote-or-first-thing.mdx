  Good morning. The Texas governor, Greg Abbott, has threatened to arrest
  Democratic lawmakers after they left the state to prevent Republicans from
  pushing through plans to aggressively change Texas’s congressional map, a move
  that is likely to see them gain seats in the next election. At least 51 of the
  62 Democrats in the Texas house left Austin yesterday, travelling to states
  including Illinois, New York and Massachusetts, in an effort to deny
  Republicans the quorum needed to hold votes. When the legislature convened at
  3pm local time, Republicans were eight members short of the number required to
  conduct business. In response, Abbott said he had instructed the Texas
  department of public safety to “locate, arrest and return to the house chamber
  any member who has abandoned their duty to Texans”. Why did the Democrats
  leave? By breaking quorum, the Democrats have temporarily blocked the
  controversial plan sought by Donald Trump to redraw the state’s congressional
  maps, a move that would probably give Republicans five more seats in Congress.
  More than 40 arrested at protest against Gaza war at Trump hotel in New York
  More than 40 people protesting against the war and worsening humanitarian
  crisis in Gaza were arrested outside the Trump International hotel in New York
  City yesterday evening. The protest, organized by IfNotNow, a Jewish-American
  anti-occupation group, had begun earlier in the evening at Columbus Circle.
  Hundreds gathered under the banner “Trump: Jews Say No More” to demand an end
  to the war in Gaza and that the Trump administration pressure Israel to allow
  greater humanitarian aid to enter the territory, as health officials there
  continue to report deaths from starvation and malnutrition. In a press release
  issued after the arrests, IfNotNow said the mobilization marked “the broadest
  tent coalition in the Jewish community against the atrocities in Gaza in the
  last two years, representing the vast majority of US Jews who are outraged by
  the actions of the Israeli government in Gaza”. Why were the protesters
  arrested? Just after 8pm, the group began walking to the Trump International
  hotel. They gathered in front of the hotel, sitting in the street, singing and
  chanting. At about 8.15pm ET, New York police department officers began
  arresting protesters for blocking the street. Central California issues
  evacuation orders after wildfire burns 72,000 acres A huge wildfire in central
  California has threatened hundreds of homes, with blazes churning through the
  brush-covered hillsides in Los Padres national forest. At least three people
  were reported injured, and more than 450 structures were under threat by the
  Gifford fire, officials said on Monday. The fire had scorched more than 72,000
  acres (29,000 hectares) as of Monday evening, after the blaze grew out of
  several smaller fires that erupted Friday along State Route 166 between Santa
  Maria and Bakersfield. What else is happening? Billowing smoke from hundreds
  of out-of-control wildfires – most of which are in the Canadian prairies –
  have caused severe air quality alerts across Canada and the US. Detroit and
  Michigan recorded some of the worst air quality in the world on Monday,
  according to a ranking by IQAir, a Swiss air quality technology company. In
  other news … Jim Acosta, a former chief White House correspondent for CNN, sat
  for a conversation with an “AI avatar” of Joaquin Oliver, one of the 17 people
  killed in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school mass shooting in Parkland,
  Florida, in 2018. Donald Trump has attacked Jaguar Land Rover as “woke” for
  its divisive rebranding strategy hours after Britain’s largest carmaker
  announced its new boss. A Brazilian supreme court judge has ordered the house
  arrest of the former president Jair Bolsonaro for breaching “preventative
  measures” that were imposed ahead of his trial for an alleged coup attempt.
  Stat of the day: some tourists and business travelers may face up to $15,000
  bond to enter US The US state department has prepared plans to impose bonds as
  high as $15,000 for some tourism and business visas, according to a draft of a
  temporary final rule. The bonds would be issued to visitors from countries
  with significant overstay rates, under a 12-month pilot program. Don’t miss
