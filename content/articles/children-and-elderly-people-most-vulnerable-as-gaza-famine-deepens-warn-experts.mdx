  Humanitarian experts and doctors are warning that children, elderly people and
  those with pre-existing health conditions are most at risk of famine in Gaza.
  Pro-Israeli activists and Israel’s foreign ministry have tried to challenge
  the veracity of shocking pictures that have appeared in the international
  media, despite widespread and well-documented evidence of growing and
  worsening famine under conditions of Israeli restrictions on aid. One such
  picture, which was used widely by the international media, including the
  Guardian, showed a young boy suffering from severe malnutrition, who it
  subsequently transpired also had a pre-existing health condition. Experts say
  that children under the age of five, including those with other health issues,
  and elderly people, will always be most vulnerable in the circumstances of
  famine. In recent days, aid agencies, governments and the UN’s food security
  monitor, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification initiative (IPC),
  have provided evidence of increasing starvation, in particular among children
  under five. Estimates from other recent famines have suggested that the risk
  of dying for children under five can be twice as high as for adults, with a
  greater risk for children with health issues. According to the health ministry
  in Gaza, 154 people have died of hunger since the start of the war, including
  89 children. Complicating the issue, say other experts, is the fact that
  children weakened by malnourishment are vulnerable to other potentially fatal
  diseases, especially if they are living in the open and in unsanitary
  conditions. Underlying the risk for the young and those with other health
  complications, Marina Adrianopoli, a technical expert in the field of
  undernutrition at the World Health Organization, warned of the risk to
  “vulnerable children [who] do not have access to services for the prevention
  and management of acute malnutrition” a situation she said that can lead “to
  widespread diseases, malnutrition and starvation”. “Acute malnutrition is a
  life-threatening condition in its most severe form, which requires urgent
  treatment,” she said. “When a child suffers from severe acute malnutrition,
  especially when associated with medical complications, this child is at high
  risk of mortality.” Adrianopoli said: “Children with acute malnutrition need
  to be immediately identified and referred for the appropriate treatment which
  is needed for their survival. Children with wasting are extremely vulnerable,
  their immune system is compromised, their susceptibility to infections
  increases rapidly. Saving their lives and averting avoidable mortality can
  only happen by providing adequate treatment.” Earlier this month, Médecins
  Sans Frontières (MSF) reported an alarming rise in malnutrition at its
  clinics, warning that 25% of the children and pregnant and breastfeeding women
  that it screened were malnourished, adding that cases of severe malnutrition
  in children under five had tripled in just two weeks. Speaking on Wednesday
  from Deir al-Balah in Gaza, the MSF doctor Mohammed Fadlalla “categorically
  rejected the cynical and cruel narrative” that there is no hunger in Gaza.
  “Malnutrition is affecting everyone, the sick, the healthy and the old because
  no one is eating enough. But the people who are most affected tend to be the
  most vulnerable: children from zero-five, the elderly, those with pre-existing
  conditions like diabetes,” he said. The findings and testimony from MSF were
  amplified this week by the latest alert from the IPC, the UN food security
  monitor whose data collection and cautious deliberations on determining
  whether famine exists are regarded as the gold standard on the issue. An IPC
  alert on Monday warned that two out of the three famine thresholds have now
  been breached in parts of Gaza, with the Food and Agriculture Organization of
  the UN (FAO), the UN World Food Programme (WFP) and Unicef warning that time
  is running out to mount a full-scale humanitarian response. The WFP said:
  “Food consumption – the first core famine indicator – has plummeted in Gaza
  since the last IPC Update in May 2025, with data showing that more than one in
  three people (39%) are now going days at a time without eating, meaning more
  than 500,000 people – nearly a quarter of Gaza’s population – are enduring
  famine-like conditions, while the remaining population is facing emergency
  levels of hunger.” It continued: “Acute malnutrition – the second core famine
  indicator – inside Gaza has risen at an unprecedented rate. In Gaza City,
  malnutrition levels among children under five have quadrupled in two months,
  reaching 16.5%. This signals a critical deterioration in nutritional status
  and a sharp rise in the risk of death from hunger and malnutrition.” The sense
  of urgency is driven by the fact that the impact of famine on the body
  proceeds slowly at first, then very rapidly as the body uses available fat
  before beginning to break down muscle cells, which release chemicals,
  including potassium, chloride and sodium, and cellular debris into the
  bloodstream, rapidly triggering more serious health issues, including severe
  malnutrition in young children. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu,
  has tried to suggest untruthfully there is “no starvation in Gaza”.
