  For nearly 50 years, there has been no trace of Depastrum cyathiforme, a
  stalked jellyfish that resembles a thistle flower. The distinctive jellyfish
  was feared globally extinct after being last spotted in Roscoff, northern
  France, in 1976. But a holidaymaker who was rock-pooling on South Uist in the
  Outer Hebrides found four of the creatures, which attach themselves to rocks
  rather like anemones, and took what turned out to be the first ever
  photographs of the species, previously only known from historic drawings and
  paintings. Its rediscovery, revealed by British Wildlife magazine, has been
  confirmed by a follow-up search that successfully located another individual
  Depastrum cyathiforme, offering hope that there is a stable population present
  on the Scottish island. In the 19th century, the stalked jellyfish was rare
  but regularly recorded in south-western British waters by naturalists
  including the legendary marine biologist Philip Henry Gosse, who named it the
  “goblet lucernaria”. But in the mid-20th century it vanished from British
  seashores, having been last found on Lundy, Devon, in 1954. Neil Roberts, who
  made the original rediscovery after turning over a rock and examining some
  interesting-looking anemones and stalked jellyfish, described his “niggle of
  doubt” when he searched online and found his photos only matched some historic
  pen drawings and watercolours of the species. But he said he was “well
  chuffed” when his photos were confirmed by experts to be the vanished
  jellyfish. Depastrum cyathiforme was recorded again by Guy Freeman, the editor
  of British Wildlife magazine, who travelled to South Uist to conduct a
  follow-up search this summer. “When Neil first shared the photos it was like
  seeing a ghost,” said Freeman. “This thing that had only ever existed in old
  drawings was suddenly there, in the flesh. It is really encouraging that the
  jellyfish was still there this summer, two years after Neil’s find, but now we
  need to widen the search and work out whether it survives anywhere else.”
  There are 50 stalked jellyfish known to science, with 10 found in British and
  Irish waters. A relative of the true jellyfish, sea anemones and corals, the
  stalked jellyfish is usually less than 5cm (2in) in height and uses a sucker
  to attach to rocks or seaweed. Allen Collins, a global expert on stalked
  jellyfish based at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC, said: “This
  is really a remarkable find, and I was so happy to learn about it. We can now
  be certain that this rarely encountered species persists. I am hoping that
  more individuals will soon be found.” Christine Johnson, from Outer Hebrides
  Biological Recording, said: “We are always excited when a species new to our
  islands is reported, but it is not every day that it is confirmed that it is
  one which was once feared to be extinct. This is a wonderful example of the
  contribution made to our knowledge of the biodiversity of the Outer Hebrides
  and the United Kingdom by local naturalists.”
