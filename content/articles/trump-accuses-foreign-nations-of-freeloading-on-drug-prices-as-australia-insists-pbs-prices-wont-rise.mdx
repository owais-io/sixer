  Donald Trump has threatened a crackdown on major pharmaceutical companies who
  fail to sell cheaper drugs to the US, and criticised nations “freeloading on
  US innovation”. Trump wrote to 17 pharmaceutical companies, demanding they
  treat the US as the “most favoured nation” and lower prices of drugs for the
  US Medicaid scheme, and threatened to use “every tool in our arsenal” to crack
  down on pharmaceutical giants if they fail to cut drug prices for Americans
  within 60 days. In Australia, under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS),
  pharmaceutical companies negotiate directly with the department of health on
  pricing. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The Australian government has not
  said whether tariffs or restrictions from the US on pharmaceuticals would
  affect the PBS. Pharmaceuticals are already covered under Australia’s existing
  free trade agreement with the US. Medicines on the PBS are capped for the
  public, with the government subsidising the rest of the cost. The government
  recently announced another drop in the price of prescriptions within the
  scheme, to $25 per script from 1 January. “The PBS is not up for negotiation,”
  a government spokesperson said. “Our government is getting on with the job of
  delivering cheaper medicines for Australians.” Labor has said repeatedly that
  prices wouldn’t rise in Australia. The health minister, Mark Butler, said on
  Tuesday the US administration had been changing its position “a lot” on
  pharmaceuticals. “It’s still shifting around a bit. I think it’s fair to say
  our officials are working hard to get a sense exactly of the nature and the
  timing of any tariffs on pharmaceutical exports,” he told ABC radio. “Which …
  is a particular sector or industry that the US administration has been focused
  on.” The US pharmaceutical lobby has complained to the Trump administration
  that the PBS undervalues drugs, and has criticised the long lead time for drug
  approvals in Australia. Trump has also threatened countries globally to
  increase baseline tariffs to 15 or 20%. The administration’s latest tariff
  deadline was recently delayed to 1 August. Trump has said countries that did
  not negotiate a trade deal directly with the US before that deadline – which
  was set to come into effect on Friday afternoon, Australian time – could face
  new levies. On Friday morning in Australia, Trump issued an executive order
  confirming new tariff deals for several trading partners, as well as revised
  tariffs for a number of other countries. Australian goods imported into the US
  will continue to attract the baseline 10% tariff, under the new tariff regime
  which will take effect in seven days. In the executive order, Trump indicated
  he was open to further negotiations on tariffs for countries he saw as in
  accordance with his America First agenda. The opposition has heavily
  criticised the prime minister for not having sat down with Trump for a meeting
  since he was elected president. The two were supposed to meet on the sidelines
  of the G7 Summit in Canada in June, but the president left early after an
  escalation in tensions in the Middle East.
