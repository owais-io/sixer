  If there was a five-minute nuclear warning, I’d run straight to my local shop
  and buy a pack of cigarettes. Even now, after all these years. I stopped more
  than a decade ago – note that I say “stopped” rather than “gave up” because
  the latter implies a sacrifice, and I have been brainwashed (OK, hypnotised)
  not to use the term. But you are never really a non-smoker. You are just a
  smoker who is currently not smoking. In your soul, you are forever one of the
  people who leave the table after eating to go and have a conversation outside,
  even if you physically stay put these days. So, as someone who found it
  difficult to quit, it’s baffling to hear that although two stop-smoking
  medications have been available in the UK since 2024, only 0.2% of those
  attempting to give up have used them, according to an analysis of NHS data on
  smoking in England. Cytisine (which also goes by cytisinicline) is a
  plant-based product that has been used in eastern Europe since the 70s and may
  appeal to those who prefer a natural option over a synthetic drug. It mimics
  the effects of nicotine, and tricks your brain into thinking you’ve had a
  cigarette. Varenicline – withdrawn in 2021 over concerns about impurities, but
  now reformulated and rereleased – can apparently reduce the urge to smoke,
  make you enjoy it less when you do and ease withdrawal symptoms. I tried
  everything when it came to my struggle with Silk Cut. Patches, gum, lozenges –
  I carried on smoking while I wore, chewed and sucked them all. I read the
  world-famous success story The Easy Way to Stop Smoking by Allen Carr (no, not
  that one). I attended the NHS in-person sessions, three times, to no effect. I
  was a triple failure, and oddly proud of it for a reason I still don’t quite
  understand. I had neurolinguistic programming, where the man shook my hand as
  he greeted me, asking, “And how long was it that you smoked for?” “Oh, I still
  smoke now. I just had one outside,” I volunteered cheerfully. He tutted and
  told me that for some clients, talking about smoking in the past tense like
  that was all it took. I scoffed at those weaklings as I walked to my train
  afterwards – in a cloud of smoke, obviously. The closest I came to victory
  back then was a hypnotist recommended by a friend, with the caveat that he
  sounded so much like Cliff Richard it was hard to take him seriously. She
  didn’t mention that he worked out of an extremely insalubrious portable cabin
  at the back of a building site. As I knocked on the tin-can door (while
  simultaneously putting out yet another last ever cigarette), I reasoned that
  if he murdered me, I would technically have given up smoking, therefore this
  would have been a success. Reader, he did not murder me. In gentle, dulcet
  tones, he told me I felt sleepy, while I felt embarrassed for him because I
  definitely wasn’t hypnotised. When he “brought me round” he asked me how long
  I thought I’d “been under”. I’d been thinking about what to have for dinner
  the whole time, so stifled a giggle as I told him: about 10 minutes. He
  replied that it had been two hours. The next morning, it occurred to me that I
  hadn’t even thought about smoking, let alone done it. Thrilled, I sent another
  friend, who had the same experience. However, a year later, almost to the day,
  we both started smoking again. I went back for a do-over but it didn’t work.
  In the end, I probably spent about as much on trying to stop smoking as I had
  on cigarettes, and the thing that finally worked was free: boring old
  willpower. It was agony. Personally, I would have bitten the doctor’s hand off
  if they could have given me a treatment that worked. And while of course no
  treatment is 100% effective, as I found out, stopping smoking is hard and
  gruelling. The more options people have, and the more visible and accessible
  these options are, the better. • Do you have an opinion on the issues raised
