  Ireland win

  France crushed Brazil 84-5 to seal their quarter-final spot but history was
  made by the tournament debutants as they collected their first World Cup try.
  This was just the 18th Test in which Brazil have played and they scored their
  first World Cup points against South Africa last week through a penalty, but
  failed to cross the whitewash. That changed against the French as Bianca Silva
  carved her name into history. It was a try of beauty, too, with a superb break
  from the replacement. The scenes in the stands were jubilant as supporters
  jumped wildly, with the coaching staff joining in with the celebrations and
  the head coach, Emiliano Caffera, looked emotional as he watched on. It will
  be a moment Brazilian rugby always remembers but the result will be a tough
  one to take. The task for Brazil was made even more difficult by the return of
  the France scrum-half Pauline Bourdon Sansus after she missed the team’s
  opener because of a ban. It was a relentless first half from France with nine
  tries, including two from Marine Ménager, to reach the break 53-0 up. The
  barrage continued with Séraphine Okemba, Émilie Boulard and Nassira Konde
  scoring. Brazil then had their euphoric moment before France racked up more
  through Lina Tuy and Kelly Arbey. Elsewhere, South Africa defeated Italy for
  the first time with a 29-24 victory in York to seal a maiden quarter-final.
  South Africa raced into a 17-5 lead in their Pool D clash, but Italy fought
  back to 24-24 heading into the final five minutes. South Africa’s powerful
  forwards had the upper hand all game and Sinazo Mcatshulwa burrowed over from
  close range for the winning score to spark wild scenes of celebration. Ireland
  held off a spirited Spain to win their Pool C clash 43-27 as they ran in seven
  tries in an entertaining game. Their 43 points is a record at the World Cup
  for the side.
