  House prices in the UK returned to growth last month, as the market recovered
  from a dip in June after the end of a tax break on stamp duty. The average
  price of a home rose 0.6% in July to £272,664, following the biggest
  month-on-month fall in more than two years in June, according to Nationwide.
  Britain’s biggest building society said the annual rate of house price growth
  also improved to 2.4%, up from 2.1% in June, and purchase activity remains
  buoyant with 64,200 mortgages approved in that month. Nationwide also noted
  that buying a property is now the most affordable it has been in more than a
  decade, although it is still almost six times the average UK wage. “The price
  of a typical UK home is about 5.75 times average income, the lowest this ratio
  has been for over a decade,” said Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief
  economist. “This is helping to ease deposit constraints for potential buyers,
  as has an improvement in the availability of higher loan-to-value mortgages.”
  However, Nationwide said borrowing costs remain high, with the interest rate
  on a typical five-year fixed-rate mortgage for a buyer with a 25% deposit more
  than three times the level seen in autumn 2021. “On the ground, transactions
  are holding together relatively well,” said the London estate agent Jeremy
  Leaf. “As a result, looking forward we expect to see a modest improvement all
  round, particularly if interest rates are reduced in the next month or so as
  widely expected, despite lingering concerns about the economy.” Temporary
  stamp duty cuts in England and Northern Ireland expired in April, adding
  thousands of pounds to the cost of many transactions. The property sector is
  hopeful of a further boost on 7 August when the Bank of England’s monetary
  policy committee (MPC) holds its next meeting to decide on whether to reduce
  the UK base rate, which stands at 4.25% and is used to set mortgage interest
  rates. Financial markets expect the MPC to reduce the base rate to 4% next
  week and again to 3.75% before the end of the year. Last month Andrew Bailey,
  the governor of the Bank of England, said that the “path for interest rates is
  downward”. However, UK inflation rose unexpectedly to 3.6% in June, well above
  the Bank’s 2% target. City economists and the central bank had expected it to
  remain the same as May’s reading of 3.4%, and the uptick in inflation may make
  the MPC more cautious about cutting interest rates. “All eyes will be on the
  Bank of England next week and what it decides to do with interest rates,” said
  Karen Noye, a mortgage expert at Quilter. “It was thought that a rate cut was
  fairly certain, but recent inflation data coming in higher than expected may
  just temper things slightly and force buyers to wait. Should the Bank of
  England follow through with a rate cut, however, that will help support the
  buyers.”
