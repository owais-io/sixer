  Train fares in England could rise by as much as 5.6% next year, as campaigners
  said passengers could be priced off the railway. Increases in train ticket
  prices are calculated using the inflation reading for July, which will be
  announced on Wednesday. The retail prices index – the measure of inflation
  used for the calculations – will hit 4.6% in July, according to consensus
  forecasts by City economists. Regulated fares, which account for about half of
  rail journeys, would rise by 5.6% in 2026 if the increase follows the same
  pattern as last year. Although the government has not yet confirmed how it
  will calculate fares for 2026, they last rose by 4.6% in March, which was one
  percentage point above the RPI reading from July 2024. Bruce Williamson, a
  spokesperson for the campaign group Railfuture, said such an increase would be
  “outrageous”. “What would be the justification for jacking up fares above
  inflation? There isn’t any,” he said. “It’s ripping off the customer, driving
  people off the trains and on to our congested road network, which is in no
  one’s interest.” The government is working on plans to bring rail services
  into public ownership, and Williamson said he would support a government
  freeze on fares. “One would hope that there would be some efficiency savings
  and economies of scale that you get from having a more integrated railway,” he
  said. “But of course, I strongly suspect that if there are any savings to be
  had, they’d be swallowed up by the Treasury and not passed back to the
  passengers, which I think is wrong.” Almost half of rail fares in England are
  set directly by Westminster. The devolved Scottish and Welsh governments
  usually cap fares at a similar level. Regulated fares include season tickets
  on most commuter journeys, off-peak returns on long-distance routes and
  flexible tickets for urban rail. The prospect of higher travel costs comes
  amid a broader rise in the cost of living. Economists expect that the consumer
  price index, the headline measure for inflation, will be 3.7% in July, up from
  3.6% in June. The government is expected to provide an update on changes to
  regulated fares later this year. A Department for Transport spokesperson said:
  “The transport secretary has made clear her number one priority is getting the
  railways back to a place where people can rely on them. “The government is
  putting passengers at the heart of its plans for public ownership and Great
  British Railways, delivering the services they deserve and driving growth. “No
  decisions have been made on next year’s rail fares but our aim is that prices
  balance affordability for both passengers and taxpayers.”
