  UK parents and teachers: share your experiences of the use of screens in
  schools
sectionName: Education
webPublicationDate: '2025-09-03T15:30:03Z'
bodyText: >-
  The use of screens technology in schools has grown from simply the use of
  computers and digital whiteboards. Some use artificial intelligence tools to
  enhance learning and others encourage children to use tablets. Some are
  calling for smartphones to be legally banned at schools, or for a return to
  more paper-based learning, while others point out that screens can help make
  learning accessible to those who have health issues or are neurodivergent. We
  would like to hear from parents, teachers and anyone working in education on
  their experiences of technology in schools. Whether it’s the use of tablets
  for homework or the gamification of some learning, we want to hear your views.
  We also want to hear from teachers about any difficulties they are facing
  working in education at the moment. If you’re having trouble using the form
