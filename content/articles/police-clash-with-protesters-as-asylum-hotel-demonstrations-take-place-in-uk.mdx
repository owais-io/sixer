  Protesters have clashed with police as demonstrations against hotels housing
  asylum seekers began to take place across the UK. Demonstrations under the
  “Abolish Asylum System” slogan were being held in towns and cities across
  England, including Bristol, Exeter, Tamworth, Cannock, Nuneaton, Liverpool,
  Wakefield, Newcastle upon Tyne, Horley in Surrey and Canary Wharf in central
  London. There were also protests in Aberdeen and Perth in Scotland and Mold in
  Flintshire, Wales. Counterprotests organised by Stand Up to Racism were taking
  place in Bristol, Cannock, Leicester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Wakefield, Horley
  and Long Eaton in Derbyshire. In Bristol, mounted police were brought in to
  separate rival groups in the Castle Park, with officers scuffling with
  protesters. Police authorised a dispersal zone, allowing officers more powers
  to move groups or individuals causing “harassment, alarm or distress to
  others”. It will remain in place until 7am on Sunday. A 37-year-old woman was
  arrested in the city on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker, Avon and
  Somerset police said, while in Liverpool there were 11 arrests for offences
  including being drunk and disorderly, assault and affray, as a UK Independence
  party protest was met by a counter-demonstration. In Horley, Surrey, about 200
  anti-immigration protesters draped in St George and union flags clashed with
  roughly 50 Stand Up to Racism protesters in Bonehurst Road. The anti-racism
  protesters chanted: “Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here,”
  and held signs calling for solidarity and to “stop deportations”. They were
  met with a torrent of abuse from the anti-migration group, one of whom yelled
  through a megaphone: “You’re all scum and you should be ashamed.”
  Demonstrators and counter-protesters gathered outside Radisson Blu hotel in
  Perth, with Abolish Asylum System supporters met by Perth Against Racism.
  Stand Up to Racism Scotland said it had achieved “victory” in the city, with
  more than 200 gathering to oppose the protest against asylum hotels. There has
  been continued tension around the use of the hotels to house asylum seekers.
  On Tuesday, the high court granted Epping Forest district council a temporary
  injunction to remove asylum seekers from the Bell hotel in Epping, Essex, from
  12 September. Regular protests had been held outside the hotel in recent weeks
  after an asylum seeker was charged with trying to kiss a 14-year-old girl,
  which he denies. The government announced plans on Friday to appeal against
  the high court’s refusal to allow it to intervene in the case, and to further
  appeal against the temporary injunction. Other local councils have also
  announced their intention to seek legal advice as to whether they could
  achieve a similar injunction for hotels in their areas.
