  There is, probably literally, only one man who could have done it. Whatever
  claims Hollywood likes to make for itself regarding meritocracy and diversity,
  only Jason Momoa has the Hawaiian heritage and the commercial clout needed
  (via such roles as Khal Drogo in Game of Thrones and various outings as
  Aquaman in the DC Extended Universe) to get an endeavour like Chief of War on
  to our screens. Momoa co-created with Thomas Pa’a Sibbitt the nine-part
  historical drama, co-wrote every episode, executive produces and stars as the
  protagonist Ka’iana, a Native Hawaiian warrior who would become instrumental
  in the fight to unify the four Hawaiian kingdoms at the turn of the 18th
  century. It opens with lingering shots of O‘ahu, Maui, Kaua‘i and Hawai‘i,
  each island so spectacularly beautiful, so inviting, so intriguingly different
  from anywhere else and so lovingly captured by director Justin Chon that it
  all begins to take on a vaguely hallucinatory quality. Fortunately, Momoa’s
  buttocks soon make an appearance and, though hardly less impressive than a
  volcanic island, their familiarity helpfully grounds us. Chief of War may be a
  passion project, but it still needs someone helming it who knows his assets
  and is willing to deploy them in the service of bringing lesser known
  historical events to the masses. Thus our introduction to the phenomenon of
  Ka’iana is him diving off a boat to wrestle a shark before killing it, after
  the appropriate rituals, for his people to eat. No sooner has he done this,
  however, than he is summoned to attend the leader of the kingdom of Maui,
  Kahekili (Temuera Morrison), whom he once served before becoming disillusioned
  by the chief’s lavishly bloodthirsty ways. Many of Kahekili’s men consider him
  a deserter and want him dead (“I would feed your heart to the pigs” says his
  second-in-command). This animosity sparks the first of many action sequences
  as Maui’s top spear expert starts throwing the things at him as he approaches
  the chief, until Ka’iana puts a stop to this nonsense by catching one in his
  mighty fist and pushing it through a meaty fold of his attacker’s flesh. This
  is about the least gory of the frequent fight and battle scenes, which are
  there to punctuate and leaven the complicated history that is being imparted
  elsewhere with a ponderousness that is perhaps inescapable in any passion
  project. Kahekili apologises for his previous bloodthirsty ways and Ka’iana
  agrees to come back for one last job – defending the islands from O‘ahu, which
  has mustered a large army and is bent on conquest. Oh, Ka’iana. Never go back
  to your toxic ex-chief. He’ll only exploit your strategic, tactical and
  muscular talents to slaughter an entire civilian population and take an island
  for himself. You must know this. The massacre at O‘ahu (after which Kahekili
  builds a tower from the skulls and bones of the dead – not a subtle man) sets
  up the series of events that will see Ka’iana separated from his family and on
  board a ship full of post-Cook explorers, learning English, getting familiar
  with firearms and garnering the kind of knowledge that will make him even more
  valuable to chiefs trying to unite the islands in the face of approaching
  colonisation. Chief of War is a dense business. The story is so unfamiliar
  that, even allowing for the battle scenes, it could have done with a little
  more unpacking. The script rarely moves beyond the “perfectly serviceable”
  range and too many of the actors have little more to do than scowl and growl
  (the men) or play the feisty-but-loving beauties that pass for well-rounded
  female characters these days. But perhaps to ask for more is to ask for too
  much. This is the first time the history of Ka’iana and the islands he hailed
  from has been told for a mainstream audience. It has a mountain to climb and
  it handles its heavy baggage pretty well. Momoa plays to his strengths –
  which, yes, include his bum, but also his air of intelligent integrity and,
  for all his mountainous muscularity, a stubborn gentleness that makes him
  credible as a reluctant warrior. It is a worthy endeavour, and if it
  occasionally feels too much like that, it does relax and gain confidence as it
  proceeds. And it will be thanks to Momoa that we can look forward to other,
  perhaps even better, ones in the future. • Chief of War is on Apple TV+ • This
  article was amended on 1 August 2025. The Aquaman character played by Jason
  Momoa is part of the DC Extended Universe, not the Marvel Cinematic Universe
  as an earlier version said.
