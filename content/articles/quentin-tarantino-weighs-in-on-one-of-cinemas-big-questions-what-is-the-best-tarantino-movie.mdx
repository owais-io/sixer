  Tarantino movie?

  It’s one of cinema’s most contested subjects: which Quentin Tarantino movie is
  the best? The director himself has finally weighed in – while also sharing his
  personal favourite and which of his films he was “born to make”. Speaking on
  The Church of Tarantino podcast, the 62-year-old film-maker said his 2009
  second world war drama Inglourious Basterds was the best of his nine films,
  while his 2019 movie Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood was his favourite. “But I
  think Kill Bill is the ultimate Quentin movie, like nobody else could’ve made
  it,” he added, of his two-part martial arts thriller. “Every aspect about it
  is so particularly ripped, like with tentacles and bloody tissue, from my
  imagination and my id and my loves and my passion and my obsession. “So I
  think Kill Bill is the movie I was born to make, I think Inglourious Basterds
  is my masterpiece but Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood is my favourite.”
  Tarantino is famed for writing all the feature films he’s directed since his
  1992 debut Reservoir Dogs. When the conversation turned to screenplays,
  Tarantino said: “I think Inglourious Basterds is my best script, and I think
  Hateful Eight and Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood are right behind. “But,
  there’s an aspect of Hateful Eight that I actually think is probably my best
  directing of my material, ie, the material is written and it’s solid,” he
  added. “So it’s not like I have to create it, like Kill Bill – it’s solid,
  it’s right there and I actually think it’s my best servicing [of] my material
  as a director.” Tarantino has chosen not to direct his sequel to Once Upon a
  Time … in Hollywood, which follows the fading actor Rick, played by Leonardo
  DiCaprio, and his stuntman, Cliff, played by Brad Pitt, in 1969 Los Angeles.
  Instead he handed the reins to David Fincher, who will direct The Adventures
  of Cliff Booth for Netflix. Tarantino remains the writer and producer. “I
  think me and David Fincher are the two best directors,” Tarantino said. “So
  the idea that David Fincher actually wants to adapt my work, to me, shows a
  level of seriousness towards my work that I think needs to be taken into
  account.” Tarantino revealed he is working on a play which will open in the
  West End of London in 2026 before returning to work on his final film. He
  remains committed to retiring after his 10th film, having previously said:
  “Most directors have horrible last movies.” On the podcast he said he had
  passed on directing The Adventures of Cliff Booth because he felt “unenthused”
  about his final film being a sequel. He has only directed one sequel – Kill
  Bill: Volume 2 – though he considers both parts of Kill Bill to be a single
  film. “I love this script but I’m still walking down the same ground I’ve
  already walked,” Tarantino said of The Adventures of Cliff Booth. “It just
  kind of unenthused me. This last movie, I’ve got to not know what I’m doing
  again. I’ve got to be in uncharted territory.” Tarantino’s final film was long
  rumoured to be The Movie Critic, which was to star Pitt and follow a cynical
  film critic working in California in 1977. But in 2024 Tarantino abandoned his
  plans for the film, confirming on The Church of Tarantino podcast that he had
  scrapped The Movie Critic because he believed it was too similar to his past
  work. “I wasn’t really excited about dramatising what I wrote when I was in
  pre-production, partly because I’m using the skill set that I learned from
  Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood – ‘How are we going to turn Los Angeles into
  the Hollywood of 1969 without using CGI?’” he said. “It was something we had
  to pull off. We had to achieve it. It wasn’t for sure that we could do it …
  The Movie Critic, there was nothing to figure out. I already kind of knew,
  more or less, how to turn LA into an older time. It was too much like the last
  one.”
