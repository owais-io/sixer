  The Guardian view on Gaza’s future: Israel should end the killing. Its allies

  Israel faces a stark choice. So do its allies. International condemnation
  pushed Israel into allowing a trickle of aid into Gaza. But it remains utterly
  insufficient, and Palestinians are still starving to death. Israel has killed
  more than 62,000 people, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s health
  ministry. Israel’s former intelligence chief Aharon Haliva, in charge when the
  Hamas atrocities of 2023 took place, was recently recorded saying that “For
  every person on October 7, 50 Palestinians must die. It doesn’t matter now if
  they are children.” That isn’t merely vengeful and obscene, it explicitly
  describes a war crime. The death toll is likely to soar again. The defence
  minister, Israel Katz, has authorised plans for the call up of 60,000 soldiers
  to seize and occupy Gaza City – forcing out hundreds of thousands of
  Palestinians and bringing further catastrophe to exhausted, desperate and
  traumatised civilians. Yet Benjamin Netanyahu has an alternative: agree to a
  ceasefire proposal, already accepted by Hamas, and reportedly “almost
  identical” to an earlier plan presented by the US special envoy, Steve
  Witkoff, which Israel accepted. An embattled Mr Netanyahu believes a forever
  war can keep him at the top and fend off the corruption trial due to
  recommence imminently. But talks continue and the war faces growing opposition
  at home, though perversely, this could cement his reliance on his far-right
  coalition partners. Reports of military discontent should be regarded with
  caution: it has not prevented the Israel Defense Forces from drawing up and
  beginning to implement plans for the Gaza City offensive. But 74% of Israelis
  want the war to end, and there were huge protests at the weekend, mostly
  reflecting concern for hostages and the toll on soldiers. A survey last month
  found that 79% of Jewish Israelis were “not very troubled” or “not troubled at
  all” by reports of famine and suffering in Gaza. Internationally, however, it
  is the suffering of Palestinians that fuels demands for the war to end and
  daily erodes Israel’s status and alliances. A survey for Reuters found that
  58% of Americans now believe in the recognition of a Palestinian state, and
  59% see Israeli actions in Gaza as excessive. Jordan described the Gaza City
  plan as “killing all prospects for peace in the Middle East”. Emmanuel Macron,
  the French president, warned that it would bring “true disaster”. Lashing out
  at critics such as Australia’s “weak” prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has
  merely made Mr Netanyahu look more desperate and isolated and heightened the
  criticism. Palestinians in Gaza City can choose only whether to stay and face
  the Israeli onslaught, or attempt to flee, in their weakened state, with
  nowhere safe to go. But others can choose to give them a future instead of
  remaining complicit with these atrocities. A ceasefire is more urgent than
  ever. Donald Trump could call a halt to the annihilation, ending Israel’s
  impunity. Instead, on Wednesday, the US sanctioned more international criminal
  court officials over the case against the Israeli prime minister. But if Mr
  Trump still hopes for a broader Middle East deal, it cannot be built on the
  ruins of Gaza City. Other states should go beyond the important but symbolic
  step of recognising a Palestinian state. Much more critical is to end all arms
  transfers, to impose further sanctions and to leverage economic power – from
  ending tariff-free access to markets to suspending Israel from the Horizon
  Europe research scheme. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this
