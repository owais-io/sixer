  It is not difficult to understand why any Italian club would want to sign
  Alisha Lehmann: last season she helped Juventus win a league and cup double,
  she is an international winger who accumulated 19 goals and 10 assists in
  England’s Women’s Super League and, yes, there is the small matter of her
  16.7m Instagram followers and 12m TikTok followers, an online presence that
  commands a commercial power vast for any athlete and pretty unique in women’s
  football. What is perhaps not so immediately obvious is why, aged 26 and with
  her peak football years probably ahead, she would opt to join a club that
  finished in the bottom half of Serie A last season and cannot yet offer
  European football. However, the Switzerland forward’s reasons for signing a
  three-year deal with FC Como Women, she says, have a deeper meaning. “It’s an
  independent club, fully focused on women’s football – and that really matters
  to me,” the former Aston Villa, Everton and West Ham player says. “From the
  start, I could see this wasn’t just another team; it’s a project with real
  purpose and vision. [So] signing with FC Como Women just felt right.” The
  club, nestled in the picturesque Italian lakes, were bought in 2024 by the
  investment group Mercury13, which has pledged to “rethink football ownership”
  and tailor everything within the organisation towards women’s football. The
  group, founded by Victoire Souki Cogevina and Mario Malavé, has attracted
  high-profile investors from the football world, including the Italy icon
  Giorgio Chiellini and – in June – the former Manchester United midfielder Juan
  Mata, and aims to be a multi-club ownership group. Como have no ties to any
  men’s club. “It sends the message that being strong, ambitious and expressive
  can all go hand in hand; that’s important for the future of the sport,” says
  Lehmann, who likes the club’s “female-first mentality” and apparent ethos.
  “We’re in a moment where women’s football can define itself on its own terms,
  and independent clubs like Como Women have the opportunity in leading the
  movement. [It] isn’t just about winning matches. It’s about building something
  that lasts. This is the first time I’ve joined an independent club. That was a
  big part of my decision. It shows there is a different way of doing things.”
  The club’s chief executive, Nicola Verdun, expressed delight at signing
  Lehmann, saying: “She brings not only her talent on the pitch but also her
  personality and passion for the game.” It is the latest headline-grabbing move
  at a club that, in May, sought to raise awareness of the challenges female
  players can face in finding work after their playing careers when their former
  Italy defender Alia Guagni had her CV printed on the front of her kit for the
  final match of her career. Lehmann, though, has not headed 160km north-east
  from Turin for a marketing gimmick or to be a team’s poster star. “I came here
  to play football and hope to earn my place by working hard,” she says. “I came
  here to compete and to grow as an athlete. The rest will come if I stay true
  to that. For me, it’s simple: I want to play as much as possible, help the
  team, and enjoy football. What I love is that they [Como] take the game
  seriously, but also create space for players to be themselves.” It is also an
  intriguing time to be part of Italian women’s football, after Le Azzurre’s
  impressive run to the Euro 2025 semi-finals, where they were leading England
  in Geneva until Michelle Agyemang’s 96th-minute equaliser and lost in extra
  time. It was Italy’s first major semi-final since 1997 and the country is
  among those hoping to host the next Women’s European Championship in 2029.
  “There’s so much potential here,” says Lehmann, who played at the Euros in her
  home country this summer and at the 2023 World Cup. “Italy’s performance
  showed the quality and spirit in the game here, and now people are paying
  attention. I think the league is ready to take a big step forward. With more
  visibility, investment, and commitment to the players, Serie A Women can
  become a real force in Europe. Being part of that journey is something I’m
  really excited about.” She is also hopeful for the future of the sport in
  Switzerland, for whom she scored her first goal seven years ago and has 62
  caps. La Nati attracted national-record crowds in July en route to facing
  Spain in the quarter-finals, as the Swiss public became more engaged in
  women’s football than ever, and Lehmann says: “The Euros were unforgettable.
  It was emotional seeing how many people came out to support us. “I really
  believe it changed how people see women’s football in Switzerland and beyond.
  The passion is there, the audience is real. Now it’s about turning that
  momentum into long-term growth.” Get in touch If you have any questions or
