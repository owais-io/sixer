  Nick Woltemade was all smiles at the final whistle, posing happily for
  pictures with Leeds fans next to the directors’ box with Alexander Isak, the
  man he could in effect replace at Newcastle, again nowhere to be seen.
  Woltemade, the Germany striker who stands 6ft 6in, completed his move in a
  deal worth up to £69m earlier in the day but was not eligible to feature, so
  watched on from the stands at Elland Road. How Eddie Howe’s men could have
  used the imposing frontman as they struggled to break the resolve of Leeds,
  leaving the visitors without a win in their opening three games. Credit to
  Daniel Farke’s side, who fought hard in filthy conditions to fashion the right
  response to last week’s 5-0 mauling at Arsenal and embarrassing Carabao Cup
  exit to Sheffield Wednesday in midweek. Farke talks endlessly about Leeds’s
  emotional fanbase and the need to make Elland Road a fortress so, having
  beaten Everton here in their season opener, this was not a result to be
  sniffed at. With Newcastle having signed Woltemade, it remains to be seen if
  Liverpool will finally be able to push through a move for Isak and maybe also
  sign Jørgen Strand Larsen from Wolves. “I’ve no update for you on Alex’s
  situation,” said Howe. “We are still looking to actively recruit, but I don’t
  know if that has any relation at all to Alex’s situation.” Howe brushed off
  suggestions that Isak had already said his farewells to teammates at
  Newcastle’s training ground. The Newcastle manager added: “I can’t tell you it
  didn’t happen, but I can’t tell you it did. That’s the first I’ve heard of it
  and I’m pretty sure I would have heard.” Genuine goalscoring chances were
  scarce throughout for both sides and it was difficult to escape the feeling
  that Woltemade could have made all the difference. “Everything that we were
  probably lacking today, I think he can bring,” said Howe. “There will be a
  period where he has to adapt, but I’ve got really high hopes for him. I just
  don’t want to add to the pressure that he’s going to be under. But I think he
  can be a difference-maker.” Leeds have collected four points from their
  opening three games but have scored one goal and Farke remains keen to add
  another forward before the window closes. He said: “Everyone wants to add
  something up top. If not, we won’t wave the white flag. But it will be more
  difficult. It’s important until the last minute of the window that we do what
  we can, yet we have to be happy with four points and two clean sheets from
  three games.” Leeds have not lost a home league game since 14 September last
  year, a run of 22 games and a record currently bettered by only two sides in
  the top four tiers of English football. The home fans belted out the Leeds
  anthem Marching on Together with almost religious zeal before kick-off and,
  with the old stadium resembling something of a lion’s den, there was certainly
  no hiding place for Newcastle. Not that there was any suggestion they were
  looking. Roared on by a boisterous away following Howe’s men purred ominously
  at times during the opening quarter. The hosts gradually steadied themselves
  and began to pose some questions of their own, with the Italy winger Willy
  Gnonto their biggest threat on the left flank. For Leeds, too often they
  lacked a final ball and cutting edge required to breach the visiting
  rearguard. That was typified in the 35th minute when left-back Gabriel
  Gudmundsson delivered a teasing low cross to the far post. It was crying out
  for a home player to bury it, but Dan James and Jayden Bogle got in each
  other’s way and the opportunity was spurned. Two minutes before the break,
  Jacob Murphy was afforded the space to hit a fierce right-foot shot which
  Lucas Perri parried for a corner. Moments later, Fabian Schär’s clever curled
  effort was deflected over. Farke threw on Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Jack
  Harrison in the final quarter as the pair helped to Leeds threaten a winner
  which did not quite materialise. Nevertheless, on a rain-lashed, windswept
  evening, both sides had made their point.
