  The Wallaroos have suffered a huge blow on the eve of Rugby World Cup with
  Olympic gold medallist Charlotte Caslick ruled out due to injury. The
  Australia squad will depart for the tournament in England on Monday afternoon
  without Caslick as the sevens star fell short in a race against time to be fit
  after sustaining an ankle injury while playing against New Zealand last month.
  Caslick was included in the Wallaroos’ 32-player squad named last week with
  the expectation that she would miss the opening pool game against Samoa on 23
  August but aim to be available for the crunch clash with the US a week later.
  The three-time Olympian and rugby sevens gold medallist shifted her full-time
  focus to the 15-a-side game with the dream of playing at a World Cup but will
  remain in Australia to continue her rehabilitation after surgery on the
  syndesmosis injury in mid-July. The 30-year-old has been replaced by uncapped
  centre Manu’a Moleka who joins her sister Faitala in the Wallaroos squad,
  though Caslick can hold out hope to be recalled as a reinforcement later in
  the tournament. “We’re really disappointed to lose Charlotte so close to the
  World Cup,” Australia coach Jo Yapp said. “She has shown great commitment to
  the XVs program and Wallaroos this year. “Charlotte’s timeline to get back for
  our pool matches has changed and following medical advice, the decision was
  made to allow her to continue on an accelerated recovery program, where she
  could be available as an injury replacement should we require a player later
  in the tournament.” Caslick turned her focus to the Wallaroos earlier this
  year and made her international debut against Fiji before going on to play
  five Tests as she loomed as a wildcard for Australia at the World Cup. The
  sevens convert has been trialled in a variety of roles with the Wallaroos but
  was beginning to make an impact in the centres before suffering the ankle
  injury in the dying stages against the Black Ferns. Caslick said last week
  that she felt a sense of satisfaction that she had been named in the World Cup
  squad after making the switch of rugby codes, though she will return to the
  sevens program later this year with one eye on a fourth Olympics at LA 2028.
  “It has been a great challenge for me,” Caslick told Guardian Australia last
  week about her experiences with the Wallaroos. “I feel like it’s pushed me out
  of my comfort zone and challenged me in ways that I didn’t think, at 30, I was
  still wanting to do. “It has been great to be part of a new group and learning
  from different coaches. I kind of just felt like I was a student of the game
  again.”
