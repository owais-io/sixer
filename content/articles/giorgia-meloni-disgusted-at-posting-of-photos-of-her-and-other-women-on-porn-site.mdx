  The Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, has said she is “disgusted” that
  photos of her and other women were posted on a pornographic website, and
  called for the perpetrators to be swiftly identified and “punished with the
  utmost firmness”. Images of Meloni’s sister, Arianna, and the opposition
  leader, Elly Schlein, were also discovered on the Italian platform Phica,
  which had more than 700,000 subscribers before its managers closed the site on
  Thursday, blaming users for “using the platform incorrectly”. The photos,
  accompanied by vulgar and sexist captions, were taken from either personal
  social media accounts or public sources without consent and altered to zoom in
  on body parts or depict the women in sexual poses. Dozens of women have come
  forward to file complaints about Phica and similar platforms since the scandal
  was exposed this week by several prominent women. “I am disgusted by what has
  happened,” Meloni told Corriere della Sera on Friday. “I want to extend my
  solidarity and support to all the women who have been offended, insulted and
  violated.” She added: “It is disheartening to note that in 2025, there are
  still those who consider it normal and legitimate to trample on a woman’s
  dignity and target her with sexist and vulgar insults, hiding behind anonymity
  or a keyboard.” Last week Meta closed down an Italian Facebook account called
  Mia Moglie (My wife) on which men exchanged intimate photos of their wives or
  unknown women. Phica, which is a misspelt play on a slang word for vagina in
  Italian, was launched in 2005 and appears to have operated unhindered despite
  women reporting the platform. Police began an investigation after receiving
  official complaints from several politicians in the centre-left Democratic
  party (PD). Doctored images of high-profile women featured in the site’s “VIP
  section”. Meloni told Corriere that those responsible must be identified and
  punished “with the utmost firmness”. “Content that is considered harmless can,
  in the wrong hands, become a terrible weapon. And we must all be aware of
  this,” she added. A study in 2019 by the University of Milan found that 20% of
  Italian women had experienced some form of non-consensual sharing of intimate
  photos.
