  Manchester City’s Rodri, who missed most of last season after rupturing an
  anterior cruciate ligament last September, is unlikely to be “really fit”
  until after this September’s international break, Pep Guardiola said. The
  midfielder’s fitful comeback was interrupted at the Club World Cup in the
  United States when a substitute appearance at the last-16 stage against
  Al-Hilal was curtailed in extra time by a groin problem. “Rodri is getting
  better but he had a big injury in the last game against Al-Hilal,” said City’s
  manager. “He has trained better in the last few days. Hopefully after the
  international break, he will be really fit.” City travel to Wolves on 16
  August and then face Tottenham and Brighton before the September break.
  Guardiola added: “Hopefully in these games, he can play some minutes, but what
  is important is that he doesn’t have pain because we don’t want Rodri coming
  back injured. We will try desperately to avoid that.” Rodri, Phil Foden and
  Mateo Kovacic – who had surgery on an achilles injury in the summer – were all
  left out of City’s travelling squad for Saturday’s friendly against Palermo in
  Sicily. Asked if they would be available for next weekend’s Premier League
  opener, Guardiola added: “Ninety minutes for Rodri, I don’t think so. Phil,
  hopefully, it depends on the problem but it’s a long week so hopefully, but
  Kova [is] injured until September or October. Hopefully [he will be back]
  earlier.”
