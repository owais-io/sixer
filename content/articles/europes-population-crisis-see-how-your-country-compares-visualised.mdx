  Anti-immigration politics is on the rise across Europe. France’s National
  Rally and Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) each have significant
  representation in their country’s legislatures, meanwhile the UK’s Reform
  party is topping the polls. But the rise of the far-right could speed up the
  population decline of Europe, projections show, creating economic shocks
  including slower growth and soaring costs from pensions and elderly care.
  Those wanting to shut Europe’s borders must contend with a stark demographic
  reality: the continent’s native population is expected to fall sharply over
  the next century in an era of low birth rates. Experts warn that European
  societies will age more quickly without immigration, bringing forward a host
  of economic challenges as workforces shrink and care burdens grow. “Most
  politicians on the centre-left and centre-right recognise that immigration is
  needed to ease demographic pressures,” said John Springford, an associate
  fellow at the Centre for European Reform thinktank. “They have sought to focus
  on tougher – and often inhumane – asylum rules in the hope that stricter
  border enforcement will provide political cover for higher regular
  immigration. “But radical right parties are increasingly challenging the
  mainstream consensus. Those countries that manage to hold the line against
  demands to cut working-age immigration will be in a stronger position
  economically in the long run.” The latest projections produced by Eurostat,
  the EU’s official statistics agency, suggest that the bloc’s population will
  be 6% smaller by 2100 based on current trends – falling to 419 million, from
  447 million today. But that decline pales in comparison with Eurostat’s
  scenario without immigration. The agency projects a population decline of more
  than a third, to 295 million by 2100, when it excludes immigration from its
  modelling. Eurostat’s baseline projections assume countries will maintain
  their average net migration levels from the past 20 years, but the Guardian
  has examined figures also published by the agency with this assumption left
  out. Likewise, the UK’s Office for National Statistics publishes population
  projections that include a zero net migration scenario. Italy, France and
  Germany, where anti-immigration politicians have recently made inroads, would
  face big population declines in a zero-immigration scenario. Italy’s prime
  minister, Giorgia Meloni, has made cracking down on migration a priority in
  her first term, but her country has one of the lowest fertility rates in
  Europe and its population would more than halve by the end of the century
  under zero immigration. In Germany, where the anti-immigration AfD came second
  in this year’s federal election, the population could shrink from 83 million
  to 53 million over the next 80 years if its borders were completely closed.
  And in France, where the National Rally won the first round of legislative
  elections last summer after campaigning for restrictions on incoming people, a
  zero-immigration scenario would mean a population fall from 68 million to 59
  million. Only a handful of EU states would notice little difference from
  closed borders: Romania, Latvia and Lithuania, all countries that have
  experienced a net outflow of people. Instead, in most of Europe, populations
  would not only shrink in the absence of current immigration levels, but also
  become older as the number of working-age people fall relative to elderly
  people. Today, 21% of the EU population is aged 65 or over. In Eurostat’s
  baseline scenario, this proportion will rise to 32% by 2100, but in the
  agency’s zero-immigration scenario, it will increase further, to 36%. Those
  studying Europe’s changing age pyramid say this will put countries under
  increasing economic pressure. “The main consequences will be slower growth
  because the labour force will shrink, and higher tax burdens, because pension
  spending and the demand for health and elderly care will rise,” said
  Springford. Indeed, much of the EU is already seeing this, with tax burdens –
  as expressed through tax revenue as a percentage of GDP – climbing in counties
  such as France, Italy, Germany and Spain in recent decades. The health and
  social care industries will become increasingly important for managing an
  ageing Europe, and many health systems in the EU are already dependent on
  immigrant doctors or nurses. “More people are going to require care, though
  that does depend on how healthy people are in old age, and how much care they
  need,” said Alan Manning, a professor of economics at the London School of
  Economics. “You also have the other side of the equation that because of fewer
  children, because of low fertility rates, you need fewer people in education
  and childcare. So what we need to be doing, in some sense, is redistributing
  people who were caring for children to caring for old people.” At the same
  time, experts stress that immigration is not a silver bullet for Europe’s
  demographic challenges, instead suggesting it is one of many solutions, or at
  least a way to ease the transition to an older society. “Increasing
  immigration levels will not solve these demographic problems on their own –
  the levels required to do so would be very large, and there are only so many
  migrants who are willing to move,” said Springford. “But they would help, as
  would raising employment rates of working-age people, pushing back the age of
  retirement, reforming pensions and shifting the burden of taxation from labour
  income to wealth, especially property.” Manning added: “For immigration to
  help, it’s got to be that immigrants are actually in work, and many European
  countries have quite low employment rates among a lot of immigrants. So you
  can’t take that as a given. If you had an immigrant who came in and didn’t
  work and then needed support, for welfare, that wouldn’t make things better,
  that would make things worse. So it’s really important that they’re going to
  be in work, and that has been problematic in some cases.” Within national
  borders, rural areas will bear the brunt of the EU’s coming population
  decline. Over the next 80 years, more villages could suffer the same fate as
  Camini in southern Italy. The village is one of many in the Calabria region
  where the population declined sharply later in the 20th century as younger
  residents moved elsewhere for opportunities. Camini has recently become the
  site of a project that is resettling refugees, in an attempt to bring the
  community back from extinction. It was cited in a recent Council of Europe
  report written by the Labour MP Kate Osamor that examined the potential of
  immigration to alleviate the challenges of an ageing population. “I was
  watching the place slowly dying. The houses were just falling down because no
  one was living in them,” said Rosario Zurzolo, who was born in Camini and is
  now the president of the cooperative running the resettlement project,
  Eurocoop Servizi. So far, 50 refugees have settled permanently in Camini under
  the scheme, bringing the village population to 350, while a further 118
  refugees are being temporarily hosted. A symbolic achievement for the scheme
  was the recent re-opening of the local school. Zurzolo says Camini can act as
  a model to help revitalise other European regions experiencing population
  decline. Serena Franco, who is also part of the Camini project and presented
  evidence to the Council of Europe for its report, added: “They’re bringing
  knowledge, and now we are starting to grow with them and to make new things,
  new processes, new jobs as well that would be impossible without them.”
