  The Mexican drug lord Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, co-founder of the Sinaloa
  cartel, pleaded guilty to federal racketeering charges as well as running a
  criminal enterprise on Monday, more than a year since he was arrested in Texas
  after what has been described as a kidnapping. “I recognize the great harm
  illegal drugs have done to the people in the United States and Mexico,” the
  77-year-old Zambada said in court through a Spanish-language interpreter. “I
  apologize for all of it, and I take responsibility for my actions.” Zambada
  helped form the feared Sinaloa cartel in the late 1980s and, at the height of
  the criminal operation, had controlled much of the production and shipment of
  heroin, methamphetamine and fentanyl from Mexico into the US. The trafficker
  was arrested in July 2024 when he arrived in the US on a plane with Joaquín
  Guzmán López, the son of the imprisoned Sinaloa boss Joaquín “El Chapo”
  Guzmán, who is considered a “principal leader of the Sinaloa cartel” by US
  authorities and is currently serving a life sentence in an American prison.
  The US claimed that Zambada presided over a violent, highly militarized cartel
  with a private security force armed with powerful weapons and a cadre of
  “sicarios”, or hitmen, that carried out assassinations, kidnappings and
  torture. Prosecutors said that under the leadership of Guzmán and Zambada, the
  Sinaloa cartel developed into the largest drug-trafficking organization in the
  world, controlling the movement of tons of cocaine from Colombia to the US,
  heroin from Mexico’s mountain states, and later fentanyl produced from Chinese
  precursor chemicals. A former associate of the Juárez cartel, Zambada operated
  within an area of Mexico known as the Golden Triangle, encompassed by the
  states of Sinaloa, Durango and Chihuahua. He started his career as a farmer,
  freelancer and small-time drug trafficker, moving small quantities of
  marijuana and heroin. As a logistics expert, he helped expand the Sinaloa
  cartel’s operations. As with Guzman, the drug trade became a family business:
  Zambada’s wife, four sons and four daughters were at one time all involved in
  drug-trafficking logistics. In 2019, a son, Vicente Zambada Niebla, testified
  “that his father’s bribery budget was often as much as $1m per month, with
  bribes going to many high-level Mexican public officials”. Zambada’s plea deal
  comes two weeks after federal prosecutors in New York said they would not seek
  the death penalty. Zambada’s lawyer, Frank Perez, told NBC News that the
  decision “marks an important step toward achieving a fair and just
  resolution”. After Zambada entered his plea, US attorney general Pam Bondi
  said: “This foreign terrorist committed horrific crimes against the American
  people – he will now pay for those crimes by spending the rest of his life
  behind bars in an American prison.” DEA administrator Terrance Cole said
  Zambada’s guilty plea “proves no cartel boss is beyond the reach of justice.
  By taking him down, we are protecting American families and cutting off a
  pipeline of poison. DEA and our partners will not stop until every cartel
  network is dismantled.” After Zambada was arrested, US officials claimed that
  he had not willingly traveled to the US but had been tricked by Guzmán’s sons,
  who had also turned themselves over to American authorities, to procure more
  favorable treatment. Zambada wrote soon after his arrest there were “many
  inaccurate reports” and wanted everyone to know from the outset he did not
  surrender to US authorities, have an agreement or come voluntarily. “To the
  contrary, I was kidnapped and brought to the US forcibly and against my will,”
  he wrote. Zambada petitioned the Mexican government to request extradition to
  the country. And Mexico said it was investigating anyone involved in handing
  over a Mexican citizen to foreign agents as a treasonable offense. The drug
  lord’s plea deal comes as Donald Trump’s administration is applying pressure
  on Mexico to crack down on the cartels and is reportedly planning to begin
  using military force against the organizations, including the Sinaloa
  organization, which the US government deems to be terrorist groups. Earlier in
  August , the New York Times reported that Trump had issued a directive to the
  Pentagon to begin using military force to curb the flow of narcotics in the
  US, a task typically assigned to law enforcement agencies. Zambada’s plea deal
  comes as Guzmán, his former Sinaloa partner, recently filed a federal
  complaint alleging that he faces cruel and unusual conditions of confinement
  inside the SuperMax federal prison in Florence, Colorado, where he is being
  held. Human rights attorneys for Guzmán said their client suffered from
  “near-constant severe sinus, ear, nose, and throat pain for years without
  adequate medical care” and has experienced “severe sleep deprivation for years
  due to the conditions of confinement in his cell”. The filing claims Guzmán is
  kept in “all-encompassing isolation” that amounts to unconstitutional cruel
  and unusual punishment. And the filing maintains Guzmán will suffer
  “irreparable harm” as a result of the “unconstitutional isolation”. El Chapo’s
  attorney David Lane told Denver 7 that Guzmán was alleging “he is in complete
  and total isolation with virtually no human contact of any kind”. “He only
  speaks Spanish, and even the Spanish-speaking guards are instructed not to
  interact with him or talk with him,” Lane said. “So this is complete isolation
  from any human contact. “It’s government control … The most dangerous entity
  on Earth is a government that’s unchecked and can do whatever it wants. We are
  here to defend [Guzmán] against the government and protect all of our
  fundamental rights.” The Associated Press contributed reporting
