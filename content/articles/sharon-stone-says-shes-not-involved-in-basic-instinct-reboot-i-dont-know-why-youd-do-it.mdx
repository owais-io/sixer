  why you’d do it’

  The actor Sharon Stone has expressed scepticism about the Basic Instinct
  reboot currently being scripted by the original film’s writer Joe Eszterhas.
  Speaking on US TV’s Today programme, Stone made reference to the unsuccessful
  2006 sequel, in which she reprised her role of murderous novelist Catherine
  Tramell. That film earned dreadful reviews, poor audience feedback and just
  $38m (£28m) at the global box office, compared to the original’s $353m
  (£261m). “If it goes the way the one that I was in went, I would just say, I
  don’t know why you’d do it,” said Stone. “I mean, go ahead, but good fucking
  luck.” She continued by questioning the logistics of her character’s return.
  “I’m at that stage where I already retired once, and I already died a couple
  of times,” Stone said. “I’m like, ‘What are you gonna do? Kill me again? Go
  ahead.’” Speaking last week to the Guardian’s Simon Hattenstone, Stone was yet
  more scornful about the project, saying: “There’s not going to be a Basic
  Instinct reboot. I hate to break it to you, but Joe Eszterhas couldn’t write
  himself out of a Walgreens drug store.” Stone, who is now promoting Nobody 2,
  went on to say she “pretty much owned the 90s as an actress” before explaining
  that a stroke that led to a brain haemorrhage in 2001 stopped her working. She
  then took time out to raise a family before returning to acting. “I want to
  leave it on the screen,” she said, “because it lasts for ever, and I won’t.
  And I’m sure of that.” Last month is was reported that Eszterhas, 80, has
  signed a deal with Amazon MGM: the streamer guarantees a $2m (£1.5m) fee for
  his new Basic Instinct script, which will be upped to $4m (£3m) should the
  film be made, making it the most lucrative spec sale of the year. “To those
  who question what an 80-year-old man is doing writing a sexy, erotic thriller:
  the rumours of my cinematic impotence are exaggerated and ageist,” Esztherhas
  said, in a statement to the Wrap. “I call my writing partner the TWISTED
  LITTLE MAN and he lives somewhere deep inside me. He was born 29 and he will
  die 29 and he tells me he is ‘sky high up’ to write this piece and provide
  viewers with a wild and orgasmic ride. That makes me very happy.”
