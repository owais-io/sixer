  In certain other sports, Brazil’s absence from any World Cup tournament would
  be regarded as downright bizarre. It’s not quite like that in rugby, and their
  women’s 15s team created history simply by running on to the turf. The first
  Brazil team to qualify for a men’s or women’s Rugby World Cup had played only
  16 times before this, winning five matches, including a playoff against
  Colombia that secured qualification. Their prize, if you can call it that, was
  an intimidating opener against the famously powerful South Africa. “Our first
  Brazil fan of the day,” one of the friendly volunteers outside Northampton
  train station declared just before 10am, as supporters began to drift from the
  platforms towards the venue. There would be more. The throb of drums was
  audible approaching the stadium, too. Although it may be stretching it to
  suggest Northampton was rocking to a samba beat courtesy of the World
  Rugby-sanctioned percussionists positioned outside Gate Three. There was more
  than a whiff of carnival atmosphere in the air, though, as the fans welcomed
  Japan and Ireland for their first instalment of the Franklin’s Gardens
  double‑header. There were patches of Brazilian gold and green visible around
  the packed stadium, and judging by the roars, every neutral fan in the place
  was praying for a gargantuan upset. After three early tries, one disallowed,
  for South Africa it looked like a cricket score might materialise but the
  lowest-ranked team in the tournament defended doggedly, and a sweetly struck
  penalty from Raquel Kochhann got them on the board. Kochhann is a cancer
  survivor as well as a three‑time Olympian, in sevens, and personifies the
  squad’s character. “I just made the kick,” Kochhann said. “It was the result
  of a jackal, so the whole team worked to get those points. They are team
  points because everyone needed to work hard. If we are not so skilful – yet –
  we have a lot of heart. And we put all that on the field.” Aseza Hele, the
  dynamic Springbok No 8, personified the size of Brazil’s task, and scored two
  superb tries before half-time. Nadine Roos, Ayanda Malinga and Libbie Janse
  van Rensburg also crossed, making it 26-3 at the break, but Brazil stayed
  firmly in the fight. The half‑time numbers told the story: Brazil had made 130
  tackles against 25 for South Africa. Gaps were always likely to open up and
  three minutes after half-time the sprightly Roos skipped around a would-be
  tackler and chipped into the Brazil 22, where Byrhandré Dolf snaffled the
  bouncing ball and sensed Hele on her left shoulder. The irrepressible No 8
  raced under the sticks to seal a hat-trick. Van Rensburg went over again, and
  Aphiwe Ngwevu added an eighth try, as the second half wore on and the Brazil
  team wore out. But Kochhann, to symbolise their continued desire, added a
  second penalty on 57min. “We’re very proud,” said the Brazilian supporter
  Fabiano Ferreira, born in the countryside near São Paulo and now living in
  south London with his Scottish wife and family. “It’s been very difficult for
  the team against South Africa.” Ferreira’s three children – Fergus, Bella and
  Laura – confirmed they, too, were proud even as the South Africa points
  continued to rain down. It became 10 tries in total, Lerato Makua rounding off
  the scoring. Malinga and Van Rensburg both scored twice and Dolf finished with
  eight conversions. “Very satisfactory performance,” the Springboks head coach,
  Swys de Bruin, said. “Their defence was good, but so was our attack.” Of South
  Africa’s experience in the early days of this tournament De Bruin said: “I
  tell you it’s fantastic. It’s the first time for these girls, in a lot of
  things, and that’s why they’re blessed, humble, and grateful. It’s a nice day
  to be a South African.” It was a nice day, and a proud day, to be a Brazilian
  too.
