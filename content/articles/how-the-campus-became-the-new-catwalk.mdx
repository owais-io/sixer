  It’s almost September, which means “back to school” season is in full swing.
  But this year it’s not just British schoolgoers being bombarded with uniform
  reminders and lunchbox ideas. The classroom comeback now extends to university
  students. Welcome to a new era of the commodification of the campus.
  Previously, it was easy to differentiate between UK and US campus culture. US
  students had frat parties, drank from plastic red cups and slept in shared
  dorm rooms. Meanwhile, UK freshers had house parties, drank cans on the bus
  and congregated in communal kitchens. But thanks to social media the lines are
  becoming more blurred. Algorithms have influenced everyone to dress the same
  and now this is affecting campus culture. Social media is peppered with US and
  UK students doing room makeover tours and library fit checks, and the only
  difference between them is their accents and labels. Now, as the illusion of
  campus life becomes more powerful than the reality of it, brands are
  attempting to monetise it. This month Kim Kardashian’s all-powerful shapewear
  label Skims pivoted from selling Hannibal Lecter-esque face-sculpting wraps to
  PJs for students to bed rot in. Its first dedicated “Campus Collection”
  features “dorm-approved and lecture-ready” pieces such as jersey capri pants,
  cropped hoodies and cotton poplin micro shorts modelled by a group of real
  students (dubbed the “Skims Class of 2025”). On Asos you can browse a “Student
  Edit” comprising over 2,000 pieces that promise to “look on-point in the
  lecture, library and beyond” – because nothing says reading week like a sheer
  maxi skirt. PrettyLittleThing’s “Back to Class” edit includes an advertising
  campaign shot in a library (a gear shift from their usual poolside settings)
  complete with models wearing preppy polo tops and rugby shirts. The
  accessories brand Charles &amp; Keith has teamed up with students from Central
  Saint Martins, photographing them on the fashion school’s campus in their
  favourite pieces from the brand. Even Shein, the mega fast fashion company
  that churns out up to 10,000 new pieces a day, is hopping on the trend with a
  “Campus Babe” programme where students can apply to be ambassadors for the
  online retailer and earn a commission on sales. Presumably by never wearing
  the same piece twice. “Students have become a crucial audience because they’re
  tastemakers,” says Nick Drabicky from January Digital, a marketing agency.
  According to Drabicky, this particular cohort appeals to brands as “they’re
  early adopters, hyper-connected, and influence household and peer spending.”
  The campus-focused trend is a knock-on effect from RushTok (an amalgamation of
  rush week – which is a bit like freshers’ week – and TikTok) , a corner of
  social media where applicants for elite Greek sororities in the USA document
  the process of getting a “bid” (i.e. membership). The recruitment phenomenon
  first went viral on TikTok in August 2021 with PNMs (potential new members)
  sharing their experiences at the University of Alabama, including game nights
  and synchronised dances. However, it was outfit of the day videos posted from
  dorm rooms that really captivated viewers. These 60-second videos featured
  predominantly thin, white, 18-year-olds with bright blond hair and obvious
  fake tans name-checking brands such as Steve Madden shoes, Kendra Scott
  earrings, Golden Goose trainers and The Pants Store – which, it turns out,
  didn’t just sell pants – in a distinctive southern drawl. Viewers who prior to
  the videos were blissfully unaware of what a Panhellenic sorority is – and
  lived in countries such as the UK where they don’t even exist – began to mimic
  them, while phrases such as “My jewelry is normal” were then commoditised and
  turned into merch. Four years later and the yearly event has become akin to a
  reality TV show, with brands keen to get involved. While brands such as Skims
  and Asos don’t directly reference rush week, the timing of their launches
  allude to it. “RushTok has set the stage for brands to package college culture
  in an aspirational but relatable way,” Drabicky says, adding, “Skims’ Campus
  Collection shows how you can tap into the energy of RushTok without needing to
  mimic it outright”. He expects to see more brands emulating its strategy –
  “It’s the new playbook for youth marketing,” he says. The campus as catnip
  comes at a time when it has never been more politicised nor expensive to
  attend. This has only fuelled interest in traditional campus signifiers,
  especially those rooted in a preppy subculture. Perhaps there is an element of
  nostalgia to it. With boat shoes, cable knit sweaters and varsity jackets all
  having a resurgence, many seem to be dressing for a uni experience that is
  entrenched in the past. One of the biggest bestsellers this season at M&amp;S
  is a cropped rugby shirt-type top that feels very fresher. Parke’s £95
  eponymous emblazoned sweatshirts, which riff on the typeface of merch from Ivy
  League universities, have become a status item among the collegiate it
  references as well as non students. H&amp;M is selling a £19.99 Yale
  sweatshirt. Primark offers a UCLA version for £18. While it is common to think
  of university students as being broke – especially since uni fees were raised
  to 9k per year in 2012 – Drabicky says we shouldn’t underestimate their
  spending power. “Students are more brand-conscious and willing to invest in
  identity-driven purchases than people think.” They are also using this new
  interest in campus life to their advantage. While a part-time job at the local
  pub or stacking shelves in a supermarket used to be a typical avenue for
  students looking to earn extra cash, a new type of side hustle is emerging
  that doesn’t even involve leaving their halls of residence. Student
  influencers are in demand, with day in the life videos documenting lie-ins,
  lectures and partying until 6am racking up hundreds of thousands of views on
  social media platforms. On TikTok, #UniStudent brings up over 260,000 videos
  while #CollegeLife results in over 2m. Tim Leslie, managing director of Campus
  Group, a company that specialises in youth marketing, says student influencers
  rewarded through sales commissions can earn anywhere from a couple of hundred
  pounds a month to up to four figures. “The student demographic presents a
  unique opportunity, as universities often operate like micro-cultures in their
  own right,” he says. Drabicky credits TikTok with accelerating interest. “If
  brands can achieve success in this age group, it has a halo effect on others
  outside this demographic. Students create content that feels authentic and
  instantly viral. This attention has always been there; now they have an outlet
  to share.” To read the complete version of this newsletter – complete with
