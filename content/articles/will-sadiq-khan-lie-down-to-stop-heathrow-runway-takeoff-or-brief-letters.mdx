webTitle: Will Sadiq Khan lie down to stop Heathrow runway takeoff? | Brief letters
sectionName: UK news

bodyText: >-
  A decade ago a former mayor of London threatened to lie down in front of the
  bulldozers to stop Heathrow expansion. It obviously worked. Time for Sadiq to
  repeat Boris’s threat (Heathrow submits ‘shovel-ready’ plans for third runway,
  1 August)? David Duell Durham • In his article comparing Starmer with Attlee,
  Martin Kettle asserts that there are “echoes of Attlee’s agenda in Starmer’s”
  (Critics say Starmer is no Attlee – and they’re right. Labour must look to the
  future, not the past, 31 July). Perhaps he could also tell us what that agenda
  is. Alasdair Macdonald Glasgow • Your article (Readers’ favourite UK waterside
  pubs, 1 August) features not one establishment in Northern Ireland, Wales or
  Scotland. So that’ll be favourite English waterside pubs. Patrick Hadfield
  Edinburgh • Re the report (Trump to build ‘beautiful’ $200m ballroom at White
  House, 1 August), surely a more appropriate extension, and an entirely fitting
  legacy, would be the world’s bigliest orangery. Mark de Brunner Harrogate,
  North Yorkshire • The Edinburgh festival – where better to scotch the pun (The
  best joke award has gone. Is the Edinburgh fringe taking all the pun out of
  comedy?, 30 July)? John Lydon Leeds • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read
  in the Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it will be considered
  for publication in our letters section.
