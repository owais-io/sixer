  The climate crisis is often a fight over numbers – and we are coming towards
  the end of a big one. It will shape how ambitious Australia will be in
  addressing this era-defining problem, over the next decade and beyond. The
  Albanese government is weighing a decision on the national emissions reduction
  target for 2035. Along with the policies that follow, it will be a legacy
  marker for a prime minister who is sometimes accused of being risk averse. The
  lobbying in the run-up has transformed the climate policy debate. It often
  used to be a debate between business interests opposing action and
  environmentalists urging leaders to act. But that was then, this is now. In
  terms of influence, it has become an argument between business and business.

  has been from investors and businesses with billions to deploy in new
  developments. Called Business for 75%, the group is led by Future Super and
  Andrew Forrest’s green energy and mining company Fortescue and backed by more
  than 500 companies. They say this is a critical moment in which Australia must
  prioritise cutting emissions and backing green industries if the country is to
  successfully wean itself off fossil fuels. Last week, it released an analysis
  by consultants at Deloitte that suggested the economic benefits of adopting a
  target of a 75% cut (compared with where emissions were in 2005) would spur
  far more investment and lead to greater economic growth than lower
  alternatives. Its position is largely backed by climate campaigners, including
  those publicly calling for much deeper cuts, including net zero by 2035. But
  the push for 75% is strongly opposed by some others in business. The
  Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the country’s largest business
  network, has argued the country’s 2030 goal (a 43% cut) was slipping out of
  reach and cautioned against setting a “more ambitious” target for 2035 as it
  could “flatten the economy”. The Business Council of Australia is also
  influential but has been slow to back a number publicly as it navigates
  internal differences within its membership, which spans banks, green investors
  and big miners. It is not the first time the BCA has struggled with its
  climate position. In 2018, it argued the then Labor opposition’s proposed 45%
  emissions reduction target for 2030 would wreck the economy. By 2021 it was
  arguing the opposite – that the momentum towards net zero emissions was
  “unstoppable” – and backed a 2030 target of between 46% and 50%, more than
  either major party was prepared to support. This time it has commissioned
  modelling from management consultants McKinsey. Climate campaigners familiar
  with it say it has returned to being comparatively pessimistic about the costs
  of climate action. The key advice to the government is coming from the Climate
  Change Authority, chaired by the former New South Wales Liberal treasurer and
  longtime climate advocate Matt Kean. Officially, the government is yet to
  receive the authority’s position but it has a pretty good idea of where it
  will land. Kean has been consulting on a 2035 target of between 65% and 75%.
  Last year the authority said this range “would be ambitious and could be
  achievable if additional action is taken”. What should people make of these
  esoteric numbers? People who want rapid action on climate differ over what
  actually qualifies as an ambitious goal. Some expert assessments take a mostly
  topdown approach, calculating Australia’s fair share of a strong global effort
  to live up to the science-based goals of the 2015 Paris agreement. Others are
  bottom up, emphasising what they calculate is economically, socially and
  technologically achievable. The authority says its 65-75% consultation range
  was based on an assessment of a range of evidence: the science, international
  action, the economic and social impact, and technology development. A 65%
  target would mean cutting Australia’s climate pollution roughly in half in the
  next decade. A 75% target would mean slashing it by about two-thirds. Those
  goals sound particularly exacting when held up against the past 20 years.
  According to the national accounts, Australia’s climate pollution is 28% lower
  than it was in 2005 but hardly any progress has been made on the main
  challenge: cutting total emissions from fossil fuel industries. They are down
  only 2%. Australia is starting well behind. But the authority’s preliminary
  range sounds more achievable if you account for the cut in pollution the
  government believes will happen, from policies already in place. According to
  official projections, federal and state action will reduce the country’s
  emissions to at least 51% below 2005 levels by 2035. The question for the
  Albanese government is this: with an electoral landslide in its pocket and a
  progressive majority in the Senate, how much political capital is it prepared
  to invest in propelling the country beyond that floor of 51% over the next 10
  years? There are plenty of opportunities for quick action. An obvious example
  is coordinating national action to boost energy efficiency and electrification
  in homes and commercial buildings, reducing both emissions and costs.
  Aggressively targeting methane – a potent heat-trapping gas with a huge
  short-term warming impact, and the focus of a global pledge that the
  government signed but hasn’t really yet acted on – is another. The safeguard
  mechanism applied to emissions from major industrial sites could be expanded
  to cover more areas and tightened to remove obvious loopholes. The fuel excise
  rebate paid to big miners to offset their diesel bill could be cut to
  encourage cleaner heavy vehicles. What remains of the native forest logging
  industry is mostly uneconomic and could be managed down. Logic suggests that
  the government will need to reckon more directly with its continued support
  for new fossil fuel export projects. The expansion of liquified natural gas
  developments, in particular, has added significantly to pollution in
  Australia, as well as overseas. But there are also areas in which deep
  immediate cuts are more challenging. In transport, turning over the national
  car fleet takes about 15 years and Australians are still buying far more dirty
  vehicles than clean. Australians are flying more than ever and alternatives to
  jet fuel are an early work-in-progress. In agriculture, equipment can be
  cleaned up but deeper reductions might mean forcibly reducing the number of
  livestock, something nobody seriously suggests. In industry, there are plants
  and practices where the clean tech needed is not yet available. The
  development of green hydrogen – hyped as a replacement for gas – has been much
  slower than hoped. The Climate Change Authority has warned that achieving a
  target of more than 75% by 2035 could lead to “significant and costly economic
  and social upheaval”. None of this is an argument against the country throwing
  significant policies and resources at finding and deploying solutions. Doing
  that is likely to lead to unexpected successes, such as the spectacular roll
  out and reduction in the cost of solar energy, now being followed in
  batteries. This is the point emphasised by investors and pro-climate
  businesses when they argue Australia should go hard and stretch to reach a
  target range into the 70s – that it otherwise risks missing out on benefits of
  the green economy that nearly everyone agrees it needs to build over the next
  25 years. We’ll know soon whether Anthony Albanese agrees.
