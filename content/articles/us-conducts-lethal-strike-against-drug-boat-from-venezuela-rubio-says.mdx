  The US military has conducted “a lethal strike” against an alleged “drug
  vessel” from Venezuela, the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has announced
  amid growing tensions between Washington and Caracas. Donald Trump trailed the
  announcement during an address at the White House on Tuesday afternoon,
  telling reporters the US had “just, over the last few minutes, literally shot
  out … a drug-carrying boat”. “And there’s more where that came from. We have a
  lot of drugs pouring into our country,” the US president added. “We took it
  out,” he said of the boat. Shortly after, Rubio offered further details of the
  incident on social media, tweeting that the military had “conducted a strike
  in the southern Caribbean against a drug vessel which had departed from
  Venezuela and was being operated by a designated narco-terrorist
  organization”. It was not immediately clear what kind of vessel had been
  targeted, or, crucially, if the incident had taken place inside the South
  American country’s territorial waters. “Everything is hinging on where this
  strike took place,” said Geoff Ramsey, a senior fellow on Venezuela and
  Colombia from the Atlantic Council’s Latin America Centre. “If this strike
  took place in Venezuelan waters, I think that will trigger a massive
  escalation from the Venezuelan side. However, from what I’ve heard … this took
  place in international waters, and that suggests that ultimately this is about
  drug interdiction.” Ramsey added: “This is a target-rich environment, after
  all. There are plenty of go-fast boats transporting cocaine through the
  southern Caribbean, and I think ultimately Washington is more interested in
  signalling than in actually engaging in any kind of military action inside
  Venezuela territory.” Even so, the development will add to fears over a
  possible military clash between Venezuelan and US troops after the US sent war
  ships and marines into the Caribbean last month as part of what Trump allies
  touted as an attempt to force Venezuela’s authoritarian leader, Nicolás
  Maduro, from power. Officially, Trump’s naval buildup is part of US efforts to
  combat Latin American drug traffickers, including a Venezuelan group called
  the Cartel de los Soles (Cartel of the Suns) which Trump officials accuse
  Maduro of leading. Last month the US announced a $50m reward for Maduro’s
  capture – twice the bounty once offered for Osama bin Laden. In July, Trump
  signed a secret directive greenlighting military force against Latin American
  cartels considered terrorist organizations, including the Venezuelan group.
  Republican party hawks and Trump allies have celebrated those moves as proof
  the White House is determined to end Maduro’s 12-year rule. “Your days are
  seriously numbered,” Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn,
  declared recently, encouraging Maduro to flee to Moscow. Maduro’s allies have
  also claimed that a regime-change operation is afoot, with Maduro himself this
  week warning that White House hardliners were seeking to lead Trump into “a
  terrible war” that would harm the entire region. “Mr President Donald Trump,
  you need to take care because Marco Rubio wants to stain your hands with blood
  – with South American, Caribbean blood [and] Venezuelan blood. They want to
  lead you into a bloodbath … with a massacre against the people of Venezuela,”
  Maduro said. But many experts are skeptical the US is planning a military
  intervention. “The idea of there being an invasion, I don’t believe to be
  true,” James Story, the US’s top diplomat for Venezuela from 2018 to 2023,
  said last week. He said Trump generally opposed “meddling militarily in the
  affairs of other countries”. Ramsey agreed. ”This is not a deployment focused
  on regime change. This may be an attempt to signal to disaffected elements of
  the military in Venezuela that now is the time to rise up against Maduro. But
  we’ve seen that approach be tried and fail repeatedly over the last 25 years.”
  Ramsey said the tough talk belied the fact that Trump had actually relaxed its
  stance towards Venezuela. Sanctions had been softened in recent weeks. The
  Trump administration was “actively coordinating with the Maduro regime on
  deportation flights”, about two of which are landing at Venezuela’s main
  international airport each week. Ramsey believed that the military
  mobilization was partly an attempt “to throw some red meat to a part of
  Trump’s base that has been dissatisfied with the reality of sanctions relief”
  and what it perceived as his soft policy towards Maduro.
