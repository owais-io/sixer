  London’s Koreans helped ensure a sold-out Royal Albert Hall for the Proms
  return of Yunchan Lim on Friday night, paired this time with the City of
  Birmingham Symphony Orchestra under Kazuki Yamada. But Lim doesn’t just shift
  tickets. His huge social media following ensures waves of global attention for
  everything he does or that is written about him. This Prom will achieve this
  for an unusual reason. Soon after Lim began Rachmaninov’s fourth piano
  concerto, a distant alarm started ringing in the Albert Hall. Red lights
  flashed high up. Yamada and Lim pressed on. At the end of the movement, Yamada
  left the podium and disappeared off-stage, leaving the musicians and audience
  uncertain. After about five minutes, though it felt longer, the red lights
  stopped, the alarm was silenced and Yamada returned, to applause and relief
  all round. By all accounts, Lim was laid-back about it afterwards. I bet the
  BBC was less relaxed. But it did not seem to affect the pianist himself, who
  often showed how naturally he can conjure a willing audience into silence with
  his range and touch. Lim’s command of sound is wide, as his Korngold encore
  would also prove, but Rachmaninov’s fourth is not an easy work to project,
  especially in a vast hall. It veers, sometimes vertiginously, between weighty
  and whispering, and there are hints of composers like Ravel. The playing was
  wonderful, but a bit more spaciousness in the interpretation would have made
  it even better. At the start, Yamada conducted a glisteningly clear account of
  John Adams’s propulsive foxtrot The Chairman Dances, which showcased the
  excellence of the CBSO’s wind and percussion sections. Then, after the
  interval, and in an already notably less crowded hall than before, came
  Berio’s Sinfonia, with its swirling and microscopically fragmentary mix of
  styles and cultures, written amid the reckless intensities of 1968. Berio’s
  score for orchestra and voices, some electronically enhanced, could once feel
  like an obsequy for a dying western culture, with its homage to Mahler, and
  its allusions to Martin Luther King and absurdist theatre. Yamada and his
  musicians captured the piece’s hauntingly chaotic sound world and its troubled
  intensity. But, like so much else, Sinfonia has become a period piece now. It
  reconnects with an era in music that no longer exists, when composers and
  audiences were far more open to the disruptive and the new than they are now.
  The steady trickle of some remaining members of the audience towards the exits
  throughout the performance felt like testimony to that. • Listen again on BBC
  Sounds until 12 October. • The Proms continue until 13 September
