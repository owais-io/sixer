  A wise fictional character once said that war never changes, and if you play
  Snake Eater, you’d be hard pressed to argue. A remake of 2004’s cold war PS2
  classic, Konami has dropped the three from the title and replaced it with a
  delta – but, make no mistake, this is the jungle-roaming jaunt almost exactly
  as you remember it. Without Hideo Kojima at the helm, Konami has sensibly not
  meddled with any story beats of this madcap masterpiece, instead pouring its
  energy into lavishly rendered art and adding slicker modern controls. Still,
  if there’s any PS2 title that can pass as a modern release, it’s Metal Gear
  Solid 3. Shifting the series into the great outdoors, Kojima squeezed every
  last drop of power out of Sony’s ageing console – sending Naked Snake
  slithering across the jungle. To contemporary players, these were vast,
  sprawling locales. Yet revisit Tselinoyarsk’s soggy swampland in today’s
  open-world gaming landscape, and the leafy jungles that once seemed impossibly
  vast on PS2 now feel almost quaint. Thankfully, the sheer charm and character
  crammed into these mosquito-ridden playgrounds still looms just as large.
  Every carefully laid path you crawl across is brimming with playful
  possibilities. Snake can lay in the mud and snipe a hornet’s nest, watching it
  engulf a nearby patrol before screaming soldiers leap off a cliff. Vultures
  descend on fallen enemies in the harsh desert sun, and you can even shoot out
  a guard’s walkie-talkie, preventing any calls for backup. It’s these
  interweaving systems and the ambitious narrative that make a modest map feel
  suitably epic. Story-wise, Snake Eater is just as batshit as ever, throwing
  real world historical footage from the cold war at you one second, before
  having you fight a human made out of bees the next. While long term fans will
  be sagely nodding along to lines about the la-li-lu-le-lo, for newcomers,
  Snake Eater’s relentless opening bombardment of cutscenes may prove utterly
  impenetrable. It doesn’t help matters that Snake Eater’s prologue regularly
  wrestles control away from the player, subjecting you to walls of text
  tutorials between tiny playable interludes, before burying you once again in
  an avalanche of proper nouns. Thankfully, once it actually lets you play,
  Snake’s Soviet outing has never felt better. While purists can opt for the
  classic top down perspective via legacy mode, there’s little reason to. The
  modern controls are a revelation, seeing a newly agile and accurate Snake
  doubling down on the action portion of the series’ tagline. Playing on normal
  difficulty becomes a breeze with the modern controls, transforming the once
  tank-like Snake into a kinetic killing machine. There are a handful of other
  welcome new changes awaiting grizzled Virtuous mission vets. A new optional
  compass handily points you in the direction of your objective and holding down
  the D-pad allows you to quickly access your codec or swap out camouflage on
  the fly. Speaking of camo, Snake Eater’s survival systems are probably its
  greatest legacy. You can see its DNA still coursing through modern games, with
  Kojima’s influential hunting systems and injury-treating mechanics laying the
  foundations for the absurdly popular survival adventures to come. While these
  pioneering systems feel a little threadbare by today’s standards, they still
  add a welcome extra layer to Snake’s sneaky shenanigans. Kojima’s meta
  playfulness still shines, with Snake Eater playfully logging your gameplay
  decisions in fascinating ways. From being able to kill an early boss hours
  before your scheduled fight by sniping him during a brief post cutscene
  appearance, to a showdown where the consequences of your bloodlust haunt you,
  few modern games embrace this degree of meta interactivity. Despite its
  cinematic ambitions, Snake Eater succeeds when it’s unashamedly being a video
  game. Items fall out of enemy soldiers, hidden frogs rotate and warble when
  you shoot them, and camouflaged rubber ducks are carefully hidden across each
  environment. It helps that Delta is an absolute stunner on PS5 pro, too, being
  one of the handful of graphical showcases for Sony’s overpriced and
  under-loved new system. Memorable sequences of yesteryear now teem with
  cinematic grandeur, brought to life in lavishly rendered 4K. It’s not all aged
  like a fine wine, however, with EVA’s cleavage-ogling cutscenes revealing an
  embarrassingly juvenile male gaze that betrays the game’s 2004 origins. There
  are, however, a few aspects that could have done with a redux. While players
  could hardly forget the iconic final showdown, the hurried final cutscenes
  suggest that Kojima was haphazardly attempting to tie the last loose plot
  threads together. It’s one area where Konami could have meddled, in what still
  feels like an anticlimactic finale. Outside the main game, there’s an
  enjoyably silly Ape Escape mode and an additional secret unlockable curio that
  I won’t spoil. The only all-new mode – the Foxhunt multiplayer component – is
  now, disappointingly, arriving post launch, leaving the current offering
  feeling slightly incomplete. Snake Eater is a leaner, meaner Metal Gear, a
  cold war caper owing just as much to James Bond as it does Apocalypse Now.
  Kojima makes no secret of his love of Hollywood, yet where his works often
  balloon into unwieldy epics, this game is still his most filmic achievement to
  date. It’s silly, self-contained and enjoyably campy, veering from the sublime
  to the ridiculous with admirable swagger. From its seamless merging of cold
  war paranoia with anime-esque silliness, the legendary voice performances
  never fail to delight, their campy theatrics lending an air of plausibility to
  the impossibly absurd. If the free Foxhunt mode ends up reliving the Metal
  Gear Online glory days when it arrives later this year, add another star to
  the score. Even if it doesn’t, Snake Eater is a melodramatic delight, offering
  a brilliant introduction to – or excuse to revisit – one of gaming’s most
  gloriously idiosyncratic masterpieces. • Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater
  is released on 28 August.
