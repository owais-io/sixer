  Say you are a single woman in New York and you are, in the words of the song,
  torn between two lovers: two handsome, intelligent, nice guys – one very poor
  and one very rich. All things being equal, who do you go for? The answer in
  real life is very different, in fact diametrically opposed, to the answer in a
  film. Few movie heroines have the candour of Jane Austen’s Elizabeth Bennet in
  Pride and Prejudice, who admitted to falling in love with Mr Darcy on seeing
  his beautiful grounds at Pemberley. But this is the choice, which never quite
  ascends to the state of a dilemma, in this charming and watchable – yet for me
  somehow anticlimactic – romantic comedy-drama from South Korean-Canadian
  film-maker Celine Song: a love-triangle confection to follow the much realer,
  truer love triangle of Song’s much acclaimed debut Past Lives. When the
  decision is made, the final act has an almost morosely elegiac mood, as it
  must, as various speeches and set pieces reconcile its rather trudgingly
  earnest direction of travel with the witty, savvy materialism of the movie’s
  premise. The scene is, of course, Manhattan where Lucy, played by Dakota
  Johnson, is a matchmaker, arranging dates and introductions for professionals
  who want to get married or, in fact, to settle. The movie begins varnished
  with a commercial glaze of luxury, that aspirational state of material wealth
  that marriage underpins and which no one apologises for wanting. Lucy is about
  to pull off her professional and personal masterpiece; she is unofficial guest
  of honour at the chi-chi wedding she has masterminded for a tremulous female
  client who has bagged a rich financial guy. The groom’s unmarried straight
  brother is hedge-fund manager Harry, played by Pedro Pascal: tall, well built,
  sophisticated, rocking a non-rental tux, clearly very rich and very interested
  in Lucy personally. He’s basically a nice, non-psycho version of American
  Psycho’s Patrick Bateman. In fact, for much of the early stages of the film,
  the dialogue does have something of Bret Easton Ellis: observations about
  wealth exchanged on a level of murmuringly subdued rational calm. No one is
  trying to be funny. This is just the way it is. But just as Harry is putting
  the moves on Lucy at the reception, her ex-boyfriend John (Chris Evans) serves
  her a drink. Humiliatingly, he is a failing actor reduced to side-hustling as
  a waiter for a catering company, still sharing a chaotic apartment with three
  other appalling losers in their 30s. And so Lucy’s relationship with the
  glamorous and stylish Harry proceeds in parallel with this bittersweet and
  inconvenient reconnection with the broke, lovable (and hot) John – flashbacks
  reveal that Lucy, now a supercool professional, was once much more vulnerable
  and emotional with John. The film does not play one suitor off against the
  other; there is no Mark Darcy/Daniel Cleaver-style punch-up. They are mutually
  respectful and both supposed to be worthy of Lucy, though Harry does have a
  certain secret that will have audiences doing some Googling after the film, a
  secret so startling on its own terms that its vulgar metaphoric potential
  didn’t occur to me until much later. Song was herself, she has revealed, once
  employed as a matchmaker. Unlike Lucy – who tells her clients she can’t just
  magically produce ideal mates or, like Dr Frankenstein, build them – Song can
  effectively do exactly this in her imaginary world, and place Lucy with an
  ideal man. The idealism replaces the materialism; the romanticism that comes
  with it is subdued. • Materialists is in UK and Irish cinemas from 13 August
