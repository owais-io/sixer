  Terry Riley: The Columbia Recordings album review – early masterworks from a
  founding father of minimalism

bodyText: >-
  Regularly cited as one of the three founding fathers of minimalism alongside
  Steve Reich and Philip Glass, Terry Riley was 90 in June. His birthday is
  belatedly being marked by Sony Classical with a repackaging (with all the
  original sleeve notes as well as new material) of the four albums that Riley
  recorded for the Columbia label in the 1960s and 70s and which made his name
  internationally. The first two of them contained what have remained his most
  celebrated works: In C was recorded in 1968 with a seven-piece ensemble
  overdubbed to create 25 instrumental voices in the final mix, and A Rainbow in
  Curved Air appeared the next year, with Riley himself playing a variety of
  keyboard instruments. After In C, Riley was signed up for a three-record deal
  that began with A Rainbow, but the following two discs have been less
  influential: Church of Anthrax was a 1971 collaboration between Riley and John
  Cale, while Shri Camel, another solo effort from Riley, dates from 1977 but
  was not released until 1980. If listening to these works again reinforces
  admiration for In C, even though some later recordings of what is now a
  seminal work are tauter and more incisive than this original, it suggests that
  nothing in Riley’s later works possess anything like the same originality and
  raw rigour. Even A Rainbow, with its layers of decorative improvisation, seems
  self-indulgent now, and nothing on the other two albums is any more
  impressive. The set is a reminder that the historical importance of Riley’s
  early music is undeniable, but how much of it deserves our attention now is
  more debatable.
