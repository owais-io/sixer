  Australia’s Children’s Book Week is celebrating its 80th year in style, with
  children donning their best costumes for the traditional parade in schools
  across the country. The event has the theme “Book an Adventure”. It is run by
  the Children’s Book Council of Australia, which has been promoting literacy
  and reading for children since the end of the second world war. Book Week
  began in 1945 when a group of women wanted to raise the profile of Australian
  children’s literature, according to Jo Panckridge of the Children’s Book
  Council. “These ladies, way back in the 1940s, started working to encourage
  authors and illustrators to write books that would resonate with Australian
  children,” Panckridge said. “We’d had so many English books up until then
  coming into Australia so they felt that children needed to know a little bit
  more about their country, their culture and the things that resonated with
  them.” But Book Week has a special importance in the 21st century: in 2023 the
  Australian Bureau of Statistics found that 76% of children aged between five
  and eight read for pleasure but just 63% of those aged 12 to 14 did the same.
  “Book Week is a celebration of the best Australian literature, it’s a
  celebration of reading, a celebration of the joy of being able to read in this
  country and to encourage and advocate reading for pleasure and reading books
  to children,” Panckridge said. “Book an Adventure” was chosen as the theme
  this year because “with books, a reader can venture anywhere at anytime and
  can meet any number of people from the past to the future and the present
  without ever leaving their bedroom”, Panckridge said.
