  As a young woman growing up in Edinburgh, I was taught this was a city built
  on the genius of the Scottish Enlightenment. That story was sunk deep into our
  bones and passed between us as our treasured inheritance. It formed our sense
  of ourselves and our belief in Scotland’s good and worthy contribution to the
  world. We walked past statues of David Hume and Adam Smith. We celebrated
  their intellect and claimed it as our own. Statues to those men were erected.
  Yet no one spoke of what lay beneath that brilliance – of whose labour built
  their wealth, whose bodies were stolen, dispossessed and abused as a
  consequence of their “thinking”. Edinburgh was framed not as a city of
  complicity but of genius. That silence shaped us. Now, the University of
  Edinburgh’s review of its legacies of enslavement and colonialism joins a
  wider reckoning that has been building across Scotland. It confronts the
  stories we were told – that we continue to tell. That we love to tell.
  Scotland has long positioned itself as a nation on the margins of empire. We
  speak of being oppressed, victimised – or as a benign participant in the
  British imperial project. But many of us, through our family histories, have
  always known that’s not the whole truth. It’s a lie of omission. One that has
  excluded us, exiled us from a national story in which we also have histories
  to contribute, and in which we have a claim. Edinburgh University’s recent
  inquiry into its history is sobering. It focuses on the institution’s
  financial gains from plantation slavery, its intellectual support of racial
  pseudoscience and its memorialisation of colonial figures. It names how
  Enlightenment thinking in Scotland justified racial hierarchies. These aren’t
  revelations for many Black and Brown Scots, or for those involved with
  Scotland’s anti-racism movements – they’re confirmations of truths long lived
  and denied. And still, we are met with denial, minimisation and the defensive
  recoil of a nation uncomfortable with the truth of itself. There’s a reflex to
  preserve pride at all costs within our society – even when the cost is
  exclusion and erasure of fellow Scots; of their histories and their story of
  Scotland. The work of uncovering Scotland’s pivotal role in enslavement and
  colonialism has been led by individuals such as the academics Geoff Palmer and
  Stephen Mullen, Zandra Yeaman at the Hunterian Museum, Lisa Williams, founder
  of the Edinburgh Black History Walk, and the poet Shasta Hanif Ali, who
  explores the stories of the Indian ayahs who lived and worked in Edinburgh.
  Their work has helped us understand long-denied histories and given many of us
  a stronger sense of belonging as a result. The University of Edinburgh’s
  report adds further weight to their labour. But what comes next? Race is a
  social construct. But we must now confront the fact that it was constructed,
  in part, here, by so-called “great men” – our great men – whose legacy
  continues to shape our country and institutions. And their legacy still causes
  us harm. This harm is not abstract. In 2024 alone, Police Scotland recorded
  4,794 hate crimes under the new Hate Crime and Public Order (Scotland) Act.
  Black and minority ethnic people are 60% more likely to live in the most
  deprived parts of Scotland than their white counterparts. Black and minority
  ethnic workers have poorer outcomes than white workers when applying for jobs
  in our public sector organisations. These are reverberations of a legacy born
  in Enlightenment philosophies that theorised racial hierarchies – ideas
  presented as science, later used to justify enslavement and colonialism. These
  narratives of white supremacy negatively affect us all, and they continue to
  endanger and blight the lives of Black and Brown people. What happens next
  must therefore go beyond apology and symbolism. It must be structural,
  sustained and fiercely imaginative. Education is key. Not just to correct the
  record, but to transform how we imagine and create a better nation. Within our
  schools, reform is under way – initiatives such as Education Scotland’s
  Building Racial Literacy programme and collectives such as The Anti-Racist
  Educator provide vital resources and training. Such efforts must be scaled,
  funded and politically backed if they’re to meaningfully reshape how we
  understand ourselves, how we embed anti-racism within our institutions and how
  we teach Scotland’s history. Edinburgh council’s Slavery and Colonialism
  Legacy Review, endorsed by councillors in 2022, included a public apology and
  the creation of an implementation group, chaired by Irene Mosota, to guide
  reparative action. This included initiatives such as the Disrupting the
  Narrative project, which has formed the main body of my work as Edinburgh
  makar (the city’s poet laureate). The meetings of the Scottish BPOC Writers
  Network’s writers group at the University of Edinburgh, and the important work
  of mentorship and support from We Are Here Scotland are also living examples
  of this reparative work. This work is not symbolic – it is foundational. It
  allow us to rebuild from the margins, and write ourselves back into the story
  of Scotland, and into the story we tell. This is a live, unfinished
  conversation – one that must embrace intersectionality, mobilise solidarity
  and resist the far right’s weaponisation of pseudoscience and historical
  denial. Opposition to anti-racism is often framed as resistance to “political
  correctness”, and calls for decolonisation are frequently mocked or
  deliberately misunderstood. Silence, however, is complicity. History is not
  settled. Our story is not finished. We are capable of confronting ourselves
  honestly and critically. We can take pride in our history of social justice
  movements – but this pride must also own and acknowledge the truth of what and
  who built this nation. That means interrogating our past and the reasons for
  our collective amnesia. It means listening to voices long silenced. The time
  has come, Scotland. The time has finally come. Hannah Lavery is a Scottish
  poet and playwright. She will be appearing in Disrupting the Narrative – a
  Performance, at the Edinburgh international book festival Do you have an
