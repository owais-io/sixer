  Quebec says it will ban prayer in public, a move that civil rights groups
  described as an “alarming measure” that targets religious minority groups and
  would infringe on “basic democratic freedoms”. The province’s secularism
  minister, Jean-François Roberge, said the move had been prompted by the
  “proliferation of street prayer” which he described as “a serious and
  sensitive issue” adding that the government had watched with “unease”. Roberge
  said the government would introduce legislation in the fall. The announcement
  follows public statements from Quebec’s premier, François Legault, who
  expressed mounting frustration over public prayers in the province’s largest
  city, Montreal. “To see people praying in the street, in public parks, this is
  not something we want in Quebec,” he said last year. “When you want to pray,
  you go in a church or a mosque, not in a public place.” For more than half a
  year, the group Montreal4Palestine has organized Sunday protests outside the
  city’s Notre-Dame Basilica that include public prayer. The demonstrations have
  also prompted counterprotests. Legault’s governing Coalition Avenir Québec has
  made secularism a key legislative priority, passing the controversial Bill 21
  in 2019. That law, which runs afoul of both Quebec’s charter of human rights
  and freedoms and Canada’s charter of rights and freedoms, bars judges, police
  officers, prison guards and teachers from wearing religious symbols while at
  work. Other public workers such as bus drivers, doctors and social workers
  must only keep their faces uncovered. In 2021, Quebec’s superior court upheld
  the statute despite a finding that the law violates the freedom of expression
  and religion of religious minorities. Governments in Canada can pass laws that
  breaches certain fundamental rights if they use a legal mechanism known as a
  the “notwithstanding clause”. It is unclear if the province would once again
  invoke the clause when passing legislation on public prayer. The Canadian
  Muslim Forum said the provincial government should be focusing on “real
  problems, not policing the fundamental rights of its citizens” instead of
  putting in place policies that would “stigmatize communities, fuel exclusion,
  and undermine Quebec’s social cohesion”. The push to ban public prayer follows
  a detailed report by the province’s independent committee studying how to
  strengthen secularism. Among the 50 recommendations, the committee suggested
  extending the religious symbols ban to daycare workers. Notably, the report
  did not call for a province-wide ban on public prayer and new tools to protect
  universities from being compelled to install prayer rooms. Instead, it found
  municipalities already have the “necessary competences” to enforce rules
  surrounding street prayer. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association said
  banning prayer in public spaces would infringe on freedom of religion, freedom
  of expression, freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of association.
  “Suppressing peaceful religious expression, individually or communally, under
  the guise of secularism not only marginalizes faith-based communities but also
  undermines principles of inclusion, dignity and equality,” said Harini
  Sivalingam, director of equality program at the Canadian Civil Liberties
  Association. Despite the outrage from civil rights and advocacy groups, the
  move has support from other political leaders. The Parti Québécois leader,
  Paul St-Pierre Plamondon, whose party is leading in public polling, called
  public prayers an “appropriation of public space by religious fundamentalists”
  and pledged to hold an internal referendum to determine his party’s formal
  position on the issue. Still, the issue is likely to once again revive fierce
  debate over the scope and reach of the government’s focus on secularism. “Let
  us be clear here: it is not prayers in public places that are disturbing;
  Catholics have been praying in public for decades and no one has ever
  protested, even though Quebecers have thrown religion in the trash,” André
  Pratte, a former journalist and senator, posted on X. “No, what is disturbing
  is Muslims who pray, in the same way that the ban on religious signs was
  really aimed only at the Muslim headscarf.” Pratte said there was “no need for
  a new legislative arsenal that will make a religious practice disappear from
  public space” and that the latest push reflected an unpopular government
  “desperately trying to regain points in public opinion”.
