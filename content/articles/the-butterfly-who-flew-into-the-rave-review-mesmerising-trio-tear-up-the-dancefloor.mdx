  This could be the definition of leaving it all on the floor. The performance
  has begun before the audience are given wristbands and enter the room. The
  stage is like a nightclub, a table filled with water cups to one side and a
  floor spotlight in the corner. Beneath an array of suspended tube lights,
  forming a kind of ramshackle roof, are three people lost in music: Oli
  Mathiesen, Lucy Lynch and Sharvon Mortimer. We are hearing Nocturbulous
  Behaviour by Detroit techno giant Suburban Knight. It is relentless, as are
  the dancers. For the next hour, you are seated spectators at a rave. The
  opening minutes seem impenetrable, as if the trio are surrounded by a force
  field, but your passivity melts away as the music shudders through us all and
  they respond to our whoops. Those screams disappear into a soundscape that
  includes sirens, punishing drums, insistent beats and otherworldly bleeps. The
  accompaniment is loud, heavy, an assault. But the dancers are incredibly light
  on their feet – butterflies who float while the music stings like a bee. They
  add a touch of humour, too, akin to Matteo Haitzmann’s similarly unremitting
  trio performance Make It Count. At times, it is as if the fug and scrum of a
  club has cleared, leaving just three isolated dancers – or as if they have
  ascended to a podium. They often use familiar techno or street dance moves but
  the choreography grows increasingly sophisticated as the trio snake from one
  routine to the next, barely pausing for water breaks. Side steps suggest the
  swaggering attack of warriors or boxers and that drilled momentum abates for
  body ripples, elasticated legs, disco arms and blissed out reverie – even a
  few gestures towards line dancing. When exercise equipment is brought on, it
  morphs into a Hiit workout. All three don rave gloves like lightning mimes.
  The heat rises in the room. The dancers, clad in athleisure and cargo pants,
  shed bits of clothing. Their focus is absolute, switching between responding
  to the music and almost controlling it, only to occasionally recoil under
  strobes (part of Shanell Bielawa’s lighting design) from its shattering power.
  Frequently in triangular formation, their bond is as mesmerising as their
  compulsion to keep going, even if there’s no space for a deeper narrative or
  emotional nuance in the piece’s audacity. Choreographed by the trio (from a
  concept by Mathiesen and featuring Celia Hext as an occasional alternate
  performer), the show is billed as endurance art because it condenses a
  three-day rave into 60 minutes. It’s a testament to their stamina – but there
  is pure pleasure here, too. The lasting impression is of transcendence and
  when those red cups start glowing like votive candles, it almost attains a
  spiritual quality. • At Summerhall, Edinburgh, until 25 August • All our
