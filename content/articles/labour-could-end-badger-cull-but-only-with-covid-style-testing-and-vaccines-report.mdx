  Labour can end the badger cull but only with a Covid-19 style focus on testing
  and vaccinating, the author of a government-commissioned report has said.
  Ministerial plans to stop the shooting of the animals can be achieved but at a
  cost to the Treasury, the report warns. The government promised in its 2024
  election manifesto that the shooting of badgers would end by 2029. Badgers are
  culled to the point of local extinction because they spread bovine
  tuberculosis (bTB) to cattle, and the disease can wipe out entire herds. The
  total cost of the disease to taxpayers, including the cattle industry, is
  estimated at about £150m annually. More than 210,000 badgers have been killed
  since the cull began in 2013. However, the current level of investment in
  testing and vaccinating cattle and badgers was not sufficient for bTB to be
  suppressed, said Sir Charles Godfray, the report’s author. The current
  government target for eradicating bTB in England is 2038, and the report says
  ministers currently have a slim chance of meeting it. The report states: “In
  our opinion there is only a small chance of meeting the target without a step
  change in the urgency with which the issue is treated and the resources
  devoted to eradication. There needs to be a mindset of defeating rather than
  managing the disease.” Godfray said it was not the case, as some campaigners
  have said, that badgers did not spread the disease to cattle. Launching the
  report, he said: “The evidence continues to show that badgers can provide a
  vector of the virus for cattle and vice versa. Denying badgers can be a risk
  can be a problem because then you have an unacknowledged source of virus that
  you aren’t dealing with.” However, he added: “Some people see that as
  automatically assuming one needs to cull badgers: that is not so,” and “the
  presence of a threat from badgers does not mean that one should in any sense
  be deflected from bearing down on the transmission in cattle”. This report is
  the first government-commissioned scientific review of the evidence into
  badger culling since 2018, when Godfray found that culling badgers did have a
  modest impact on reducing bTB levels. He now says it is possible to stop the
  cull, but more government investment and farmer engagement is needed. The
  report suggests measures including the microchipping of cattle, to track their
  movements and their interactions with the infected. “There is a threat from
  badgers and if we are going to move away from a cull we need to move towards
  non-lethal control,” Godfray said. “Vaccination is a realistic way to stop
  bovine TB in badgers but considerable work will have to be done to scale it up
  so it becomes viable. We saw during the Covid-19 pandemic how things can move
  so much faster when there is real focus on the disease. We want to see the
  same for this disease.” The scientists who produced the report acknowledged
  they were “mindful of the great current pressures on public finances” but
  said: “Bovine TB control is suffering from lack of investment in Defra/APHA
  and in the local authorities that play a critical role in compliance.” They
  said: “We suggest that investment now will save money in the future.” Prof
  James Wood, a veterinary epidemiologist at the University of Cambridge who
  contributed to the study, said testing cattle using more hi-tech methods had
  helped reduce the disease over the past seven years. He said the standard
  test, which is a skin test, was “imperfect” and missed some cattle in the
  early stages of the disease, but there were blood tests which gave more
  accurate results. Wood added that vaccinating cattle and badgers could reduce
  the transmission of the disease. He said: “Cattle vaccination provides huge
  opportunities for the reduction of transmission in herds. These large herds
  are some of the most challenging situations for both the farmer and for Defra
  to manage with TB”. The farming minister, Daniel Zeichner, said he welcomed
  the report but did not mention whether the end to the badger cull would go
  ahead during this parliament as previously planned. He said: “The government
  is determined to eradicate bovine TB – a devastating disease that destroys too
  many farmers’ livelihoods and has led to the culling of thousands of badgers.
  Following a record year for badger vaccination in 2024, a new badger
  vaccinator field force will be deployed next year. We are also developing a
  cattle vaccine and, along with the Scottish and Welsh governments, have
  invested over £40m into vaccine-related research. Early next year, we plan to
  publish a comprehensive new strategy that will set out how we will set out how
  we will eradicate this disease by 2038.”
