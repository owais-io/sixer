  UK toy sales have bounced back as adults increasingly muscle in on the market,
  snapping up everything from Pokémon trading cards and Lego sets to
  collectibles and action figures based on movie and TV franchises. After
  falling almost 4% in 2024, UK toy sales have risen 8% so far this year, in
  line with the “strong rebound” enjoyed by the global market, data shows. While
  the fortunes of the UK toy industry have for some time been linked to a
  growing army of “kidults” (buyers aged 12 and over), it is over-18s who appear
  to have driven the increase in sales in the first half of 2025, data from the
  market research company Circana suggests. The firm said that in the UK the
  fastest growth was in games and puzzles, including Pokémon cards. These are
  enjoying a fresh wave of popularity among nostalgic adults, helped by social
  media influencers brandishing their rare finds. Building sets from companies
  such as of Lego were also flying off the shelves, as were action figures and
  collectibles. Some of this is being fuelled by strong demand for figures and
  other merchandise based on anime and manga series, while the recent
  blockbuster films The Fantastic Four: First Steps and F1 the Movie, starring
  Brad Pitt, are likely to have boosted the appetite for items based on the
  Marvel and Formula One franchises. Looking at the 12 months to March this
  year, and at five European countries – the UK, Germany, France, Spain and
  Italy – adults aged 18 and over accounted for almost a fifth (18%) of toy
  sales, totalling $2.7bn (£2bn), which was up 10% on the previous 12 months.
  Commenting on the global data, Frédérique Tutt, a toys industry adviser at
  Circana, said: “The surge in sales can largely be attributed to consumers aged
  over 12 years old, who have shown unprecedented growth and are consistently
  outperforming traditional kids’ trends. “Products such as building sets,
  trading cards, games, plush toys and collectibles are seeing increased demand
  from both teens and adults.” Entertainment licences typically linked to movies
  and TV shows are playing a key role in the market’s growth. Tutt said Pokémon
  – which began as a pair of video games in the mid-1990s – “remains the top
  property for the fourth consecutive year”, with sales doubling compared with
  last year. “Other leading properties include the NFL [the US’s National
  Football League], Marvel, Hot Wheels and Star Wars, showcasing the wide
  variety of licensed toys that are popular in the market.”
