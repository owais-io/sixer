  Newcastle Falcons already had wings, but after their purchase by Red Bull a
  club that have long been in freefall should once again take flight. Within 24
  hours of the takeover completing on Tuesday, the rebranded Newcastle Red Bulls
  had already sold more season-tickets than for the whole of last season, with
  Wednesday’s sales figure the highest for a single day in the club’s 29-year
  professional history. “It’s amazing for the sport and for Newcastle,” says the
  former Falcons winger and England Sevens captain Ollie Phillips. “With Red
  Bull’s backing Newcastle can become the best known rugby team in the world.”
  Red Bull’s impact may have been almost immediate, but getting to this point
  has taken considerable time. A source at the company described this week’s
  announcement as the culmination of a two-year journey into rugby. Unusually,
  the Newcastle purchase was driven by its London office rather than from
  company headquarters in Fuschl, Austria, which was behind moves into Formula
  One and extreme sports, as well as a growing football stable that now includes
  almost 10% of Leeds as well as the flagship clubs Red Bull Leipzig and Red
  Bull Salzburg. Significantly, Red Bull Sport’s managing director, Oliver
  Mintzlaff, who oversaw the removal of the F1 team principal Christian Horner
  last month, announced the takeover, which shows it has the backing of the
  people who matter. Red Bull has invested in rugby before and has endorsement
  deals with the England winger Jack Nowell and South Africa’s double World
  Cup-winning captain Siya Kolisi, having previously being a sponsor for England
  Rugby, but Newcastle are the first club it has bought. The process began when
  the London-based marketing executive team contacted the RFU and Premiership
  Rugby Limited two years ago to discuss potential investments. “We like rugby
  because it is where extreme sports meets the mainstream,” the Red Bull source
  said. “It’s exciting, fast-paced and contains that element of risk that
  appeals to our customers. We think rugby has been undervalued historically,
  and want to help grow the sport generally, and of course, in Newcastle, in
  particular.” Red Bull approached the talks with an open mind, but it soon
  became clear that rather than another sponsorship deal they wanted to buy a
  meaningful stake in a club or league. An invitation to invest in the proposed
  new breakaway league, R360, was dismissed with Red Bull preferring to partner
  with an established competition. With Worcester, London Irish and Wasps having
  gone out of business in the past three years, and seven of the 10 remaining
  Premiership clubs effectively trading insolvent, with net debts of more than
  £300m, there were no shortage of takers. While Red Bull spoke to other clubs,
  Newcastle soon emerged as the preferred option due a combination of their
  desperate need for funding and the potential upside – a big city club with a
  young population in a sports-mad region and no other professional rugby union
  club for 100 miles. “It’s a stroke of genius from Red Bull,” says Phillips,
  who now runs his own executive coaching company, Optimist Performance.
  “They’ve bought access to a huge market pretty cheaply. They can promote their
  products to all the students in Newcastle, Durham and York. “By buying a team
  at the bottom of the league they’re almost guaranteed to succeed, at least in
  relative terms. If there’s sporting success in the north-east, people follow
  pretty quickly.” Red Bull’s other sporting investments have followed a similar
  model of buying distressed assets and embarking on transformation projects and
  Newcastle certainly fit that template. Steve Diamond’s side have won two
  Premiership games in the past two years so the only way is up, but Red Bull
  provided funding before the takeover was completed to facilitate the signings
  of the New Zealander back-rower Tom Christie from Crusaders and the Argentina
  scrum-half Simón Benítez-Cruz. A flood of new signings is not anticipated this
  summer due to salary cap restrictions and limited player availability, but Red
  Bull are understood to be working to a 10-year plan that features winning
  trophies in the next decade and qualifying for European competitions within
  five years. Much attention will be placed on improving the pathway and
  subsequent retention of players development by a historically successful
  academy, with the recent graduates Jamie Blamire, Callum Chick and Adam Radwan
  all leaving the club for better opportunities elsewhere in the Premiership in
  order to advance their domestic and international careers. While Diamond is
  staying on to run the rugby department, Red Bull has already begun recruiting
  for a new managing director with a brief to overhaul the club off the field.
  There will be considerable investment in the Kingston Park stadium, a new
  indoor facility is planned at their training ground and the matchday
  experience for fans is likely to be transformed, with exhibitions from extreme
  sports and live stunts on the cards. A new club badge will accompany the
  rebranded Red Bull name, while a kit launch is being planned for the middle of
  the season. For Premiership Rugby, the takeover is particularly timely as the
  domestic top-flight is also being rebranded this season. From next month it
  will be known as the Gallagher Prem, part of a campaign to engage younger
  audiences by talking up the league’s intensity, physicality and occasional
  brutality. After the disastrous post-Covid years of decline and bankruptcy,
  club rugby has bounced back in the past couple of seasons, with TV viewing
  figures up 30% year-on-year in 2024-25, which persuaded TNT Sports to pay
  £200m for a new four-year rights deal. “It’s a unique investment,” says Simon
  Massie-Taylor, the chief executive of Prem Rugby. “Ultimately, Red Bull are in
  the business of selling drinks and part of their strategy is to tell really
  compelling stories about high performance, which they have a lot of experience
  in. “Red Bull are brilliant marketers and the Newcastle journey will be great
  for them. They’ve bought an under-performing team with the potential to
  significantly grow its fanbase – it will be fascinating to see it play out.”
