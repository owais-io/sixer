  It appears that successive governments are able only to formulate key policies
  in the form of three-word phrases, usually absent of an executive subject.
  While I welcome the shift in focus represented by the switch from boats to
  gangs, it is surely evident that this is still only addressing the symptom,
  not the cause. Most of those arriving in small boats have come from countries
  either torn by ongoing conflict or ravaged by past conflict. To use the idiom
  of government, we need to stop the cause, stop the wars. Sarah Mulholland
  Goldsithney, Cornwall • Surely the fact that “More than 50,000 people have
  crossed Channel in small boats since Labour took power” (12 August) must show
  that the country is worth living in? Helen Keating Gatehouse of Fleet,
  Dumfries and Galloway • With all the terrible news connected with Gaza, I was
  gulping to stop tears while reading the final message of the Al Jazeera
  reporter Anas al-Sharif (‘If these words reach you … Israel has succeeded in
  killing me’: the last words of a journalist killed in Gaza. 11 August).His
  article touched me as no other. I am not religious, but his love shines
  through all the pain and terror he has undergone. Joan Mazumdar Galmpton,
  Devon • When journalists are bombed for reporting what they observe, the only
  conclusion we can draw is that truth has become the enemy (Global outrage
  mounts as funeral held for five journalists killed by Israel, 11 August). Pete
  Lavender Woodthorpe, Nottinghamshire • Good Friday is always a non-gardening
  day in Maria Thun’s biodynamic gardening calendar (Letters, 11 August).
  Stephen Bowden St Cyr les Colons, France • Have an opinion on anything you’ve
  read in the Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it will be
  considered for publication in our letters section.
