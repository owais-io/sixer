  When Texas Republicans unveiled yet another contorted congressional map last
  week – one that would all but erase Austin’s Latino-led seat and increase the
  Republican party’s federal House tally by up to five seats in total – the
  outcry from Democrats was immediate and justified. But beyond the Democratic
  state legislators’ brave effort to stymie the proposal by boycotting the vote,
  a different refrain has also been heard by leading Democrats in other states:
  if they do it, why can’t we? Governor Gavin Newsom of California has vowed to
  “fight fire with fire”, advancing a proposal that would redraw California’s
  own congressional map to offset Republican gains in Texas. New York’s Kathy
  Hochul has also embraced the prospect of aggressive gerrymandering in
  Democratic-controlled states, sidestepping the independent commissions that
  Democrats themselves had once championed and successfully implemented in both
  California and New York. It is an understandable impulse, but it is the wrong
  one – for both strategic and principled reasons. To begin with, Democrats are
  destined to lose a gerrymandering arms race. They control fewer state
  legislatures and the very nature of electoral map engineering currently favors
  Republican power-grabbing, since most Democratic voters live in densely
  populated urban areas, which makes it easier to concentrate them in fewer
  electoral districts. A simulation conducted through 538’s Atlas of
  Redistricting in which every state is aggressively gerrymandered to maximize
  the House seats of the party in power at the state level results in a notional
  House of 262 Republicans and 173 Democrats: a 30-plus seat jump for the
  Republican party compared with a non-partisan map that maximizes for district
  compactness. Nor is this a far-fetched scenario. Rather than forcing the other
  side to back down, retaliation appears more likely to lead to further
  escalation, in this as in other domains of all-out binary conflict. When
  running for governor of Illinois in 2018, JB Pritzker had initially pledged to
  back an independent districting commission but subsequently signed one of the
  most brutal Democratic gerrymandering plans in the country, which has yielded
  just three Republican districts out of 17 in a state where Donald Trump won
  43% of the votes in 2024. That precedent is now being pointed to by Texas
  Republicans to justify their own gerrymandering plan. But there is also a
  deeper reason why “fighting fire with fire” is a bad idea when the goal is to
  protect democracy from purported challenges to it: the “fire” in question
  amounts to a violation of one of democracy’s core values – ultimately, the
  principle of voting equality – and would therefore end up doing the work of
  democracy’s enemies for them. The metaphor of “fighting fire with fire” can in
  fact be traced back to the thought of the German émigré scholar to the United
  States, Karl Loewenstein, who in the 1930s recommended the use of
  self-consciously “anti-democratic means” – such as party bans and restrictions
  of voting rights – to fight fascism, in the name of what he called “militant
  democracy”. Far from achieving their intended goal, such measures were
  instrumental in the consolidation of the Nazi regime in Germany, given that
  Adolf Hitler was first nominated chancellor through an emergency presidential
  decree intended to forestall the prospect of a socialist takeover (construed
  as a greater threat for German democracy than nazism itself), and that the ban
  on other political parties Hitler quickly imposed was justified on the grounds
  that it was necessary to protect the German constitutional order in the
  aftermath of the Reichstag fire of 1934. Similarly perverse uses of the logic
  of “militant democracy” have since become a standard component of the
  authoritarian playbook – from Augusto Pinochet’s 1973 coup in Chile to Recep
  Tayyip Erdoğan’s 2016 counter-coup in Turkey, both of which undid democracy in
  their countries under the guise of protecting it against purported enemies. A
  fully gerrymandered congressional map in the United States would thus not just
  be bad for Democrats. It would also be terrible for American democracy since
  it would effectively disenfranchise local minorities across the country,
  yielding an overall competition between two mirroring forms of
  authoritarianism: Democratic or Republican one-party rule at the local level.
  If Democrats want to continue to portray themselves as the party of democracy
  against the Trump administration’s thinly veiled authoritarian ambitions, they
  should begin by practicing on own their turf the same principles of democratic
  civility and self-restraint they accuse their opponents of violating.
  Crucially, this doesn’t mean “doing nothing” in the face of Republican
  gerrymandering. The point is rather that (big and small “D”) Democrats should
  use democratic rather than authoritarian means to protect democracy against
  its enemies – which is to say, win elections by advancing more attractive
  policy platforms and mobilizing voters more effectively in support of them,
  rather than by changing the rules to their own benefit. That the Trump
  administration’s substantive policy decisions – from its inflationary trade
  wars to the fiscally regressive One Big Beautiful Bill Act – seem destined to
  do most harm its own electoral constituencies offers plenty of opportunity for
  fair-and-square political comeback. Ultimately, however, the Democrats’
  chances of success in upcoming electoral cycles will depend on their capacity
  to present a more attractive political alternative to the current Republican
  party’s brand of populist authoritarianism. Instead of mirroring their
  opponents, Democrats should therefore seek to differentiate themselves from
  them, which at present can only mean: strict adherence to democratic norms and
  forthright advocacy of a more progressive policy platform. When a house is on
  fire, more fire won’t help. What is needed is water – which is to say,
  something different, that is at the same time an antidote against fire’s
  damaging effects. Carlo Invernizzi-Accetti is an associate professor of
  political science at the City University of New York, City College
