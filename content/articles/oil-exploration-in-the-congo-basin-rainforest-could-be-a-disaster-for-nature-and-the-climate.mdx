  The “worst place in the world” to explore for oil is open for business. Again.
  Swathes of the Congo basin rainforest, home to okapis, lowland gorillas,
  bonobos and other rare wildlife, are being auctioned off by the Democratic
  Republic of the Congo (DRC) for the second time in three years. This round of
  licensing includes 52 blocks across 124m hectares (306m acres) of swamps and
  rainforest in some of the best-preserved tropical ecosystems left on Earth.
  Opening it up for fossil fuel extraction could be a disaster for nature and
  the climate. We have been here before. In July 2022, the DRC government
  announced an auction round that included Virunga national park and the Cuvette
  Centrale tropical peatlands in the north-west of the country, which store the
  equivalent of three years of global emissions from fossil fuels. It came just
  months after a $500m (£380m) deal at Cop26 in Glasgow to better protect the
  DRC’s portion of the world’s second-largest tropical rainforest. In the end,
  the auction petered out despite defiant claims from the country’s then oil and
  gas minister that celebrity campaigners including Leonardo DiCaprio and Ben
  Affleck would not stand in their way. The DRC government announced the end of
  the auction last October, citing lack of competition and irregular offers. But
  the world has changed in the proceeding months. In 2022, the US was a leading
  diplomatic voice behind the scenes, urging the DRC government to cancel the
  auction. Dozens of environmental NGOs spoke out to condemn the decision. One
  New York investment firm even tried to buy the oil blocks and turn them into
  an enormous carbon offsetting project. Today, in a world shaped by Donald
  Trump’s White House and with the growing risks of speaking out about the
  environment, the reaction to the latest auction has been comparably meek. “The
  world’s worst place to prospect for oil is up for auction, again,” said Prof
  Simon Lewis from University College London, who led the team that first mapped
  the central Congo peatlands, speaking to my colleague Phoebe Weston last
  month. “No credible company would bid for oil in the DRC’s forests and
  peatlands, as there is probably not enough oil to be commercially viable, and
  it will be expensive oil in financial, social and environmental costs.” Those
  in favour of the oil exploration say the development does not need to come
  with a major environmental cost and could provide a huge economic boost for
  one of the poorest nations on Earth. They point to Gabon, also a Congo basin
  rainforest country, as an oil producer that maintains one of the highest
  levels of forest cover in the world. But there is confusion about priorities
  of the DRC government. Rich in critical minerals, the DRC has been the focus
  of intense diplomatic competition between China and the US in recent years,
  positioning itself as a “solutions country” for the climate crisis and the
  energy transition. Earlier this year, it announced one of the world’s largest
  conservation projects – the flagship Kivu-Kinshasa Green Corridor conservation
  initiative. But more than two-thirds of the corridor overlaps with the planned
  oil blocks. “Imagine: 39 million Congolese people … and 64% of our forests
  could be directly affected by the awarding of these oil blocks,” said Pascal
  Mirindi, campaign coordinator for Notre Terre Sans Pétrole. “And all this
  while the government is promoting the Kivu-Kinshasa ecological corridor. Where
  is the logic? Where is the coherence? We are reminding our leaders that the
  Congolese people are the primary sovereign. We will not remain silent while
  certain people organise themselves to sell off our future.” Often overshadowed
  by the Amazon and its Indonesian counterparts, the importance of the Congo
  basin rainforest is unknown by many around the world. But it is hard to
  overstate just how crucial it is for millions of people, helping to regulate
  rainfall as far away as Egypt. Its demise would be a disaster. Read more: DRC
