  Andrew Doherty: Sad Gay Aids Play review – twice the satire from Gay Witch Sex
  Cult comic

  Gay Witch Sex Cult was quite the solo debut last year from Andrew Doherty, a
  folk-horror pastiche delivered in character as deluded estate agent Kaelan
  Trough. His follow-up attempts something similar, but trips itself up with a
  split satirical focus. Sad Gay Aids Play starts out with Doherty again in
  deliciously bumptious persona, smugly introducing his new drama chronicling
  the HIV crisis. We expect another genre spoof from an act with an adroit ear
  for send-up. But that’s not what we get – because the show doesn’t just send
  up sad gay Aids plays (such as they are), it tilts at Arts Council England
  funding as well. The conceit is that Doherty wants to make a trashy comedy
  about reality TV, but ACE won’t fund it. If he wants their cash (and he needs
  it, because moneyed mum and dad have withdrawn their subsidy) he has to make
  something grittier, burlesquing his own marginal identity and exaggerating any
  personal trauma he may (or may not) have suffered. Hence the sub-Angels in
  America drama he’s now workshopping for us, and keeps adjusting according to
  live feedback from his ACE paymasters. There’s no denying that the voguish
  vicissitudes of arts funding – and its bias against comedy – are ripe for
  mockery. But Doherty’s satanic ACE caricature misses the mark here. It also
  obliges our host to play himself, a hapless supplicant performer, rather than
  the self-congratulatory alter ego that so amused audiences last year, and at
  the start of this show. There’s still plenty to enjoy in his play within a
  play, which rehashes gay life in the early 1980s. We see protagonist Harry
  Manlove, spurned by his homophobic mum, form a found family with friends
  including Freddie Mercury. It is, briefly, a carefree time – until Harry
  develops a cough, and starts wondering about “that last batch of semen I just
  took”. Doherty is a fantastic performer, and the comedy is potent in this
  mismatch of solemn subject matter with egotistical and ignorant actor/host.
  But when Doherty steers us away from that, towards his more effortful satire
  at ACE’s expense, the delight slightly dissipates. At Pleasance Dome,
  Edinburgh, until 24 August All our Edinburgh festival reviews
