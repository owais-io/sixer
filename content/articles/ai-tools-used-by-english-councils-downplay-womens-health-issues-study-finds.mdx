  Artificial intelligence tools used by more than half of England’s councils are
  downplaying women’s physical and mental health issues and risk creating gender
  bias in care decisions, research has found. The study found that when using
  Google’s AI tool “Gemma” to generate and summarise the same case notes,
  language such as “disabled”, “unable” and “complex” appeared significantly
  more often in descriptions of men than women. The study, by the London School
  of Economics and Political Science (LSE), also found that similar care needs
  in women were more likely to be omitted or described in less serious terms. Dr
  Sam Rickman, the lead author of the report and a researcher in LSE’s Care
  Policy and Evaluation Centre, said AI could result in “unequal care provision
  for women”. “We know these models are being used very widely and what’s
  concerning is that we found very meaningful differences between measures of
  bias in different models,” he said. “Google’s model, in particular, downplays
  women’s physical and mental health needs in comparison to men’s. “And because
  the amount of care you get is determined on the basis of perceived need, this
  could result in women receiving less care if biased models are used in
  practice. But we don’t actually know which models are being used at the
  moment.” AI tools are increasingly being used by local authorities to ease the
  workload of overstretched social workers, although there is little information
  about which specific AI models are being used, how frequently and what impact
  this has on decision-making. The LSE research used real case notes from 617
  adult social care users, which were inputted into different large language
  models (LLMs) multiple times, with only the gender swapped. Researchers then
  analysed 29,616 pairs of summaries to see how male and female cases were
  treated differently by the AI models. In one example, the Gemma model
  summarised a set of case notes as: “Mr Smith is an 84-year-old man who lives
  alone and has a complex medical history, no care package and poor mobility.”
  The same case notes inputted into the same model, with the gender swapped,
  summarised the case as: “Mrs Smith is an 84-year-old living alone. Despite her
  limitations, she is independent and able to maintain her personal care.” In
  another example, the case summary said Mr Smith was “unable to access the
  community”, but Mrs Smith was “able to manage her daily activities”. Among the
  AI models tested, Google’s Gemma created more pronounced gender-based
  disparities than others. Meta’s Llama 3 model did not use different language
  based on gender, the research found. Rickman said the tools were “already
  being used in the public sector, but their use must not come at the expense of
  fairness”. “While my research highlights issues with one model, more are being
  deployed all the time, making it essential that all AI systems are
  transparent, rigorously tested for bias and subject to robust legal
  oversight,” he said. The paper concludes that regulators “should mandate the
  measurement of bias in LLMs used in long-term care” in order to prioritise
  “algorithmic fairness”. There have long been concerns about racial and gender
  biases in AI tools, as machine learning techniques have been found to absorb
  biases in human language. One US study analysed 133 AI systems across
  different industries and found that about 44% showed gender bias and 25%
  exhibited gender and racial bias. According to Google, its teams will examine
  the findings of the report. Its researchers tested the first generation of the
  Gemma model, which is now in its third generation and is expected to perform
  better, although it has never been stated the model should be used for medical
  purposes.
