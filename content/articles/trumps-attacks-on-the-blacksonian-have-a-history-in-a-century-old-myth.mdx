  It should surprise no one that former cast members from reality shows that ran
  for more than 15 seasons are running out of new material. Days ago, Donald
  Trump, former star of NBC’s The Apprentice and current US president, posted a
  lengthy Truth Social rant in which he (again) threatened the country’s leading
  cultural institutions to adhere to his political ideology. The target was one
  he has had in his crosshairs before – the Smithsonian’s National Museum of
  African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) – which Trump called “OUT OF
  CONTROL” in his post. “Everything discussed [in NMAAHC exhibits] is how
  horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was,” Trump unloaded. “WOKE IS
  BROKE,” he continued through his customary use of all caps and misplaced
  capitalization of common nouns. “We have the HOTTEST Country in the World, and
  we want people to talk about it, including in our Museums.” The tirade left
  many wondering what exactly Trump saw as the upsides of slavery, but also
  where they had previously heard this recycled talking point. The comment
  seemed to echo comments made just days prior by his fellow reality show bully
  Jillian Michaels, a former trainer on NBC’s The Biggest Loser, the weight-loss
  competition show that launched alongside The Apprentice in 2004. Michaels had
  been making her rounds in media and public appearances, rebranding from
  verbally abusive fat shamer to Maga influencer. On CNN’s NewsNight, the host
  Abby Phillips moderated a roundtable discussion on Trump’s months-long
  overreach into cultural institutions such as the Kennedy Center and the
  NMAAHC. Michaels hijacked the conversation into a lament about slavery’s
  prominence in the massively popular museum’s displays on US history. “[Trump]
  is not whitewashing slavery, he’s not,” Michaels said. “You cannot tie slavery
  to just one race, which is what every single exhibit [at NMAAHC] does.”
  Turning towards the representative Ritchie Torres, who was seated beside her,
  Michaels unloaded popular far-right talking points. “Do you realize that only
  less than 2% of white Americans owned slaves?” she continued. “Do you realize
  slavery is thousands of years old? Do you know who was the first race who
  tried to end slavery?” Torres’s interjections that slavery was a system of
  white supremacy, not a set of individual white acts, went unaddressed by the
  TV star. (From 20% to 50% of the white population in southern US states owned
  enslaved people, and all white people nationwide benefited from slavery’s
  racial order. Michael’s false claims prompted Phillips to later post a public
  correction.) The tirade was an escalation of Trump’s previous open
  declarations to “restore truth and sanity to American history”, an effort to
  overhaul exhibits and installations across federally operated museums and
  galleries and politicize their content, with the NMAAHC locked squarely in the
  administration’s sights for what it called “corrosive ideology”. Previous
  edicts about the museum, lovingly nicknamed “The Blacksonian” by many of its
  patrons, had not specifically identified slavery as the White House’s gripe.
  But Trump’s Truth Social post more directly reflected a return to a
  century-old tactic to minimize chattel slavery as “not that bad”. If we have
  learned anything from reality television, it is that every narrative is
  scripted. No matter how easily their claims were debunked, both Michaels and
  Trump were in lock step in their effort to vindicate white people from their
  role in slavery, both by insisting that slavery’s conditions and aftermath are
  overblown, and refuting that it played a major role in US history. These
  assertions are a refresh of a century-old “lost cause” myth spearheaded by the
  United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC), an organization of more than
  100,000 white women who set out to make slavery respectable again by
  rebranding the Confederacy’s bloody image. The “genteel ladies” campaign
  euphemized slave trading as a “celebration of memory” and “a southern way of
  life”. Like Michaels, Trump and like-minded slavery deniers, proponents of
  “the lost cause” promoted an outlandishly misleading account of history in
  which slavery was both irrelevant as the cause of the American civil war, and
  benevolent because Christianity and plantation life, they said, benefited
  African-descended people who were otherwise unfit for civilization. UDC
  members capitalized on their social status as wives and mothers to
  indoctrinate children, notably through catechisms, the control and production
  of school textbooks, essay and scholarship contests, and their spinoff
  organizations, like the Children of the Confederacy. Their purported concern
  for white children provided a gender-appropriate cover for their goals to
  terrorize Black people in the south. They took full advantage of the threat of
  lynching that loomed over any Black person, including children, who dared to
  challenge a white woman. Confederate statues and memorials, which UDC lobbied
  to have strategically placed outside courthouses and in public squares, parks
  and other spaces, were meant to intimidate African Americans who were merely
  engaging in civic life. Trump’s obsessive preoccupation with the Smithsonian’s
  19th installation signals that history is repeating. Since its 2016 opening,
  the NMAAHC has welcomed more than 10 million in-person visitors, with families
  and school groups driving much of that number. Across seven floors and 12
  galleries, the museum offers a remarkably comprehensive deep dive into the
  story of Black life in the US. It is as accessible to grammar school pupils as
  it is impressive to nationally celebrated historians. On his initial tour in
  2017, Trump lauded the institution as “a shining example of African Americans’
  incredible contributions to our culture, our society and our history”. Today,
  the museum serves as a go-to supplement for the Black history curriculums that
  many American public school systems have stripped or disbanded under
  Republican state legislatures’ “anti-woke” policies. Trump’s Truth Social post
  went on to announce that he had instructed his attorneys to “go through the
  museums and start the exact same process that has been done with colleges and
  universities”, comparing the funding cuts the administration has wielded over
  university curricula and research to an overhaul of NMAAHC’s exhibits relevant
  to slavery. It’s a play right out of the UDC’s book: the daughters understood
  that they had lost the war but could win the battle for the national narrative
  if they could successfully undermine Black progress and Black accounts of
  slavery in educational institutions. Vindication, as the organization deployed
  it, was a tool for vengeance, not justice – divorced from all reality and set
  on a narrative in which they insisted they were the victims of the very war
  their families provoked. They perfected a manipulation of public memory that
  controlled the racial hierarchy by controlling education. The late sociologist
  and historian James Loewen, who studied Confederate monuments across the US,
  once explained that the past is what happened, history is what we say about
  the past, and some of us believe that should be the same thing. We are locked
  in a battle, however, with those who seek to pervert history and replace it
  with a fiction that absolves their present-day wrongdoing. UDC members
  continued to lobby for revisionist school curricula and the placement of
  Confederate memorials well into the 20th century, where they fought against
  Black progress in the civil rights movement. Ultimately, backlashes against
  Confederate monuments successfully removed nearly 100 of them in the protests
  following the state murder of George Floyd. Still, hundreds more remain,
  including those Trump has recently replaced. He is clinging to a century-old
  storyline hoping to be renewed for another political season. But it’s old
  material that isn’t nearly as effective when your opponents already know the
  playbook. Saida Grundy is an associate professor of sociology and African
  American studies at Boston University, and the author of Respectable: Politics
  and Paradox in Making the Morehouse Man
