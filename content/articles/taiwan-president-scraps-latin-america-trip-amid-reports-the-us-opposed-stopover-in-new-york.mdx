  stopover in New York

  Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te will delay an expected trip to his country’s
  remaining allies in Latin America, amid conflicting accounts of the reason for
  the postponement. Lai was expected to travel to the Americas next month, as
  his government seeks to shore up support in a region where many countries have
  cut diplomatic ties in favour of relations with China, which claims Taiwan as
  its territory. Amid reports that the Trump administration had opposed a
  proposed stopover by the president in New York, his government said Lai had no
  overseas travel plans due to domestic issues, including natural disasters and
  tariff negotiations with the United States. However, one person with knowledge
  of the discussions told the Associated Press that the US “had asked Taipei to
  rearrange the transit – not go through New York.” The Financial Times reported
  the US denied permission for Lai to stop in New York after China raised
  objections with Washington about the visit. The United States has
  traditionally facilitated transits by Taiwanese leaders, but Lai’s trip was
  bound to infuriate Beijing at a time when US President Donald Trump is trying
  to negotiate a deal on trade with China. Beijing regularly denounces any shows
  of support for Taipei from Washington. The cancellation has drawn concerns
  from experts that the White House is setting a bad precedent for US-China
  relations. However, embassy officials in Guatemala insisted the visit had been
  postponed because of the “typhoon that caused many natural disasters” in
  Taiwan. A source speaking to Reuters said Lai needed to organise his
  government’s response to extreme weather at home. Taiwan is still recovering
  from Typhoon Danas, which struck its densely populated west coast this month
  with record winds and brought widespread damage to its electricity grid and
  some houses. Asked about a delay, US state department spokesperson Tammy Bruce
  told a regular news briefing no travel plans had been announced so the issue
  was “hypothetical.” “At this point, there have been no … travel plans for the
  president. There has been, as a result, nothing cancelled,” she said, while
  reiterating that US transits by high-level Taiwanese officials “were fully
  consistent with our longstanding policy and practice.” Jason Hsu, senior
  fellow at the Hudson Institute and a former legislator in Taiwan, said Taipei
  always consults with the United States on transit and called it “abnormal” for
  Washington not to agree when such stopovers are permitted under the Taiwan
  Relations Act. He added that if the US had prevented Lai’s stopover, the Trump
  administration would appear “to be accommodating China’s red lines.” Democrats
  on the house foreign affairs committee accused Trump of folding to Beijing.
  Raja Krishnamoorthi, who is the top Democrat on the house’s China committee,
  called it “another example of the Trump administration caving to China in
  hopes of reaching a trade deal.” “Presidents of both parties have allowed
  Taiwan officials to transit through the US in the past, and now should be no
  different,” he said in a statement. With Reuters, Associated Press and Agence
  France-Presse
