  The family of 18-year-old Benjamin Guerrero-Cruz was shocked when they found
  out that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) had discreetly moved him
  out of California, according to California congresswoman Luz Rivas, who spoke
  with his relatives and reviewed federal detention records. Guerrero-Cruz, who
  was first detained in Van Nuys neighborhood while walking his dog, was
  transferred late Monday from the Adelanto detention facility in San Bernardino
  county to a remote holding site in Arizona without any notification given to
  his family. The next day, Ice prepared to send him to Louisiana, a key hub for
  deportation flights. At the last moment, however, Guerrero-Cruz was removed
  from the plane and returned to Adelanto, where he remains in custody,
  according to Rivas’s office. “The nightmare for him, his family, and thousands
  in similar situations is not over yet,” Rivas said in a statement. “I will not
  accept the current reality that ICE shuffles and transfers detainees without
  notifying their family to inflict psychological pain for all of those
  involved. “Benjamin and his family deserve answers behind Ice’s inconsistent
  and chaotic decision-making process, including why Benjamin was initially
  transferred to Arizona, why he was slated to be transferred to Louisiana
  afterward, and why his family wasn’t notified of his whereabouts by Ice
  throughout this process,” the statement continued. Rivas introduced
  legislation on Tuesday that would require Ice to contact a detainee’s
  immediate family within 24 hours of a transfer. Current rules only mandate
  notification in the event of a detainee’s death. According to the Department
  of Homeland Security, Guerrero-Cruz faces deportation to Chile after
  overstaying his visa, which obliged him to leave the US by 15 March 2023. The
  teen was initially arrested on 8 August and held in downtown LA for a week.
  One of his former teachers, Liz Becerra, visited Guerrero-Cruz at an Ice
  processing center in Adelanto, an hour and a half north of LA. She said that
  Guerrero-Cruz spoke about being surrounded by masked men while walking his
  dog, handed over to federal agents, and then brought to the metropolitan
  detention center in downtown LA. He was not allowed to shower or brush his
  teeth for a week, Becerra said. Once he was moved to Adelanto, he said he was
  being kept in a small cell with about two dozen other men with little access
  to food and water. This pattern of detainees being shifted between multiple
  sites reflects a broader practice under what the Trump administration is
  touting as the largest deportation initiative in US history. An analysis of
  Ice data by the Guardian found that in June this year, average daily arrests
  were up 268% compared with June 2024. It also found that, despite Trump’s
  claims that his administration is seeking out the “worst of the worst”, the
  majority of people being arrested by Ice now have no criminal convictions. As
  a result, detention facilities have been increasingly overcrowded, and the US
  system was over capacity by more than 13,500 people as of July.
