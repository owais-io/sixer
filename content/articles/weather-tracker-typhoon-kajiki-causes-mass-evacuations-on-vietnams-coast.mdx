  Vietnam has evacuated more than half a million people as it braces for Typhoon
  Kajiki which, at the time of writing, is forecast to make landfall near the
  city of Vinh on Monday. Boats and flights have been cancelled in preparation
  for the typhoon’s impact. Kajiki developed into a typhoon on 23 August as it
  travelled across the South China Sea. It continued to strengthen, with
  sustained winds reaching more than 100mph (160km/h), as it travelled just to
  the south of Hainan, an island province in southern China. A red alert was
  issued for Hainan, which is the highest alert level in China’s warning system.
  The typhoon is expected to bring more than 300mm (11.8in) of rainfall to parts
  of Hainan and Vietnam on Monday, causing flooding that is likely to have a
  severe impact on farmland. On Tuesday, Kajiki is forecast to rapidly weaken as
  it travels inland across Vietnam and Laos owing to the lack of warm seas
  required to fuel the storm. Across the Atlantic, despite Hurricane Erin
  remaining about 200 miles (320km) away from the coast of the US as it moved
  across the western Pacific last week its impacts could still be seen along the
  coast as large swells washed away beaches and flooded houses. Waves of almost
  50ft (about 15 metres) were recorded by a buoy in the western Pacific on
  Wednesday night, with waves breaking at about 20ft along coastal areas. As
  Erin tracked away from the east coast of the US last week it become a
  post-tropical cyclone, but still remained a powerful system with sustained
  winds reaching about 90mph. Erin will stall to the north-west of Britain
  through this week and weaken without causing much of an impact to western
  Europe. However, the swell produced by Erin will continue to propagate into
  the west coast of Europe causing hazardous rips and large waves. Waves at the
  popular surfing spots of Mullaghmore on the west coast of Ireland and Nazaré
  on the west coast of Portugal are expected to be above 20ft on Tuesday. Brazil
  also experienced large swells brought by a deep low pressure system in the
  southern Atlantic that produced the largest wave ever surfed in the country at
  48ft. Another tropical system named Fernand developed shortly after Erin in
  the western Pacific last week, although this system is not expected to make
  landfall or strengthen into a hurricane, partly owing to a lesser amount of
  warm water across the western Pacific brought by the upwelling as Erin passed.
