  The government and opposition in the Caribbean island of Grenada have joined
  forces to drop the oath of allegiance to the British crown amid growing calls
  to remove King Charles as the country’s head of state. A statement from the
  government announcing the move said that in “a commendable display of national
  unity” the country’s parliament had agreed bills to amend the country’s
  constitution. The change will remove the words “His Majesty King Charles the
  Third, His Heirs and Successors” from the pledge of allegiance and replace
  them with “Grenada”. In the statement, Grenada’s prime minister, Dickon
  Mitchell, said: “The unanimous support for this amendment demonstrates our
  shared commitment to national identity and constitutional progress and while
  we may differ on many issues, today we stand together in affirming that our
  allegiance belongs to Grenada and its people.” Later, he told local media: “I
  don’t think anyone in their right mind will expect me – or any future prime
  minister of Grenada – on taking the oath of office to serve them, that I
  should be swearing allegiance to King Charles, his heirs and successor.” He
  added: “What is it about King Charles that is superior to me, that requires me
  not to swear allegiance to the people of Grenada but to him?” The prime
  minister added: “Sovereign countries have excellent bilateral relations. That
  doesn’t mean that you have to swear allegiance to the head of a state of
  another foreign country.” This only happened, he pointed out, because Grenada
  was a former British colony and not because it was voted on by Grenadians. The
  governor-general, Dame Cécile La Grenade, the Crown’s representative in
  Grenada, assented to the two pieces of legislation to amend the oath, after
  they were approved in both the lower and upper Houses of Parliament. Grenada’s
  tourism and culture minister, Adrian Thomas, said the move was a response to
  decades of calls from Grenadians to change the oath, setting it amid a broader
  trend to decolonise society, assert the country’s independence and reform the
  constitution. He said: “Although we still have many institutions, like the
  royal prison, the Royal Grenada Police Force, we are on the road to
  decolonising our society and apart from the oath of allegiance we will be
  doing much more in years to come.” On the streets of St George’s,
  communications consultant Sherene Thomas-Isaac, said the change was “long
  overdue”. “We’re independent. I think that’s a mark of our sovereignty … We
  have to follow the true course of what independence means for our region,” she
  said. The change to the oath comes as the Grenada Reparations Commission vowed
  to step up the pursuit of an apology and reparations from the monarch and
  intensify calls for the removal of King Charles as the country’s head of
  state, after new research revealed that George IV personally profited from
  slavery on the Caribbean island. Arley Gill, the head of the commission,
  thanked Francis Alexis, a former attorney general and government minister, for
  lobbying for the change, which he described as “one small step in the further
  deconstruction of a new colonialism process”. Gill said: “We need to
  strengthen the lobby in Grenada to get rid of the king as head of state. The
  royal family is not fit and proper to be the head of state of a country where
  they have directly profited from slavery. We need to move to republicanism
  immediately.”
