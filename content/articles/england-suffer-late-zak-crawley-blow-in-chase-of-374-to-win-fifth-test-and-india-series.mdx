  At the end of a punishing third day for England came one last gut punch from
  the only fast bowler to stay the course in this series. Mohammed Siraj,
  scourge of the hosts 24 hours earlier, sent a searing yorker into Zak
  Crawley’s stumps to bring about the close and set India on course for a 2-2
  draw. All that stands between Shubman Gill’s hardy tourists and this outcome
  are nine English wickets. And with Chris Woakes unlikely to bat with a
  dislocated shoulder, it may only take eight. After losing Crawley to the
  penultimate ball, England will resume in the morning on 50 for one but still
  with 324 more runs needed to win. The hosts certainly felt like the outside
  bet when Siraj hit the bullseye and the Indian supporters in the stands
  erupted. England’s target of 374 may just be three more than they cruised to
  in the first Test at Headingley but this is a far more capricious surface and
  the balance of power has long since shifted. Not only that, the highest
  successful run chase at the Oval is the 263 that England chased down against
  Australia, nine wickets down, in 1902. A certain Gilbert Jessop struck the
  record 76-ball century that day – the record that England’s aggressive current
  generation keep unsuccessfully flirting with. And there is also another injury
  concern in the ranks. Ben Duckett survived what was a hostile late 14-over
  burst from India’s quicks but as he walked off on 34 not out, his hand was
  throbbing after a brutish blow from Prasidh Krishna. If England are to stand
  any chance of securing a 3-1 series scoreline, they will probably need their
  incendiary opener fit and firing. If there was confidence to be found for
  England – and there was little to speak of as Siraj wheeled away in
  celebration – it came from the 396 all out that India stuck on the board in 88
  overs. This was driven by Yashasvi Jaiswal’s 118 from 164 balls, a remarkable
  66 from nightwatchman Akash Deep and some late fireworks off the glowing bat
  of Washington Sundar. The Oval is usually Ollie Pope’s happy place but
  England’s stand-in captain endured a pretty torturous day. He was hampered by
  the absence of Woakes, his attack was strung out by just 51 overs of respite
  between innings, and further damaged by six catches going to ground across the
  innings. Jaiswal was afforded two of those lives on the second evening but,
  after resuming on 51, the left-hander did not offer another until, with the
  lead already sitting at 250 runs, he slashed Josh Tongue to deep backward
  point. Even this dismissal was a case of umpteenth time’s a charm, with
  Jaiswal previously murderous to anything short outside off stump. Mike Selvey
  once wrote that “were I ever to be condemned to beheading, I would like Robin
  Smith to be the swordsman” – a line that came to mind every time Jaiswal
  rocked back and powerfully cut the ball to the rope with precision. England
  knew all about the 23-year-old’s proficiency here, having witnessed the Jude
  Bellingham-style century celebration three times previously. More surprising
  was the identity of his partner during an initial third-wicket stand that,
  worth 107 runs, represented the highest of this fast forward match. Deep had
  previously made one half-century in senior cricket but over the course of the
  first 90 minutes he switched from nightwatchman to fully-fledged No 4. OK, not
  quite. But until Jamie Overton finally knocked him over, his 12 carved fours
  and assiduous defensive work demoralised a side that, in theory, should have
  started out with some optimism. One factor here was India correcting their day
  two mistake and requesting the heavy roller first thing, temporarily
  anesthetising a surface that had previously thrown up 21 wickets inside two
  days. Another was Crawley shelling Deep at slip on 21, setting the tone for an
  innings that eventually climaxed after tea with Sundar hammering 53 off 46
  balls. England’s attack was running on fumes by the end, tenderised by Jaiswal
  class and, continuing a theme of the series, a 77-ball 53 from Ravindra
  Jadeja. Sundar ruthlessly applied the finishing touches, firing up the dhol
  drums among the Indian supporters with four fours and four heaved sixes. And
  no, none were struck off Harry Brook’s liquorice all sorts. Without a
  frontline spinner to offer both threat and relief, England’s three fit seamers
  deserve credit for their efforts. Tongue had a second Test five-wicket haul to
  show for it – five for 125, admittedly – while Gus Atkinson, the most
  consistent, took his match tally to eight. Among these was Gill lbw for 11
  with the first ball after lunch, ending the Indian captain’s mighty series
  with 754 runs but, curiously, an average of just 13.5 inside the M25. This
  match has been a struggle for Overton, however, with his right-arm heft less
  suited to the pitch – his home pitch, no less – and his radar not helped by a
  lack of form in the lead-up: Deep’s removal ended a run of 63 overs in
  first-class cricket without a wicket, while Dhruv Jurel, lbw for 34 with a
  nice outswinger, was just his fourth of the season. While England largely
  eschewed rotation in the hope of winning this series early – ending up with
  Ben Stokes injured and both Brydon Carse and Jofra Archer needing a breather –
  Overton’s selection still felt like one that was made with an eye on the
  Ashes. With impressive resilience summed up by the indefatigable Siraj, India
  have simply kept coming.
