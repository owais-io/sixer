  The removal of the Internal Revenue Service commissioner Billy Long after just
  two months in the post came after the federal tax collection agency said it
  could not release some information on taxpayers suspected of being in the US
  illegally, it was reported on Saturday. The IRS and the White House had
  clashed over using tax data to help locate suspected undocumented immigrants
  soon before Long was dismissed by the administration, according to the
  Washington Post. Long’s dismissal came less than two months after he was
  confirmed, making his service as Senate-confirmed IRS commissioner the
  briefest in the agency’s 163-year history. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent
  will serve as acting commissioner, making him the agency’s seventh leader this
  year. The outlet reported the Department of Homeland Security had sent the IRS
  a list of 40,000 names on Thursday that it suspects of being in the country
  illegally. DHS asked the tax service to crosscheck confidential taxpayer data
  to verify their addresses. The IRS reportedly responded that it was able to
  verify fewer than 3% of the names on the DHS list, and mostly names that came
  with an individual taxpayer identification, or ITIN number, provided by DHS.
  Administration officials then requested information on the taxpayers the IRS
  identified, which the service declined to do, citing taxpayer privacy rights.
  The White House has identified the IRS as a component of its crackdown on
  illegal immigration and hopes that the tax agency help locate as many as 7
  million people in the US without authorization. In April, homeland security
  struck a data sharing agreement with the treasury department – which oversees
  the IRS. But Long appears to have resisted acting on that agreement, saying
  the IRS would not hand over confidential taxpayer information outside its
  statutory obligation to the treasury. White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson
  rejected the notion that the IRS was not in harmony with administration
  priorities. “Any absurd assertion other than everyone being aligned on the
  mission is simply false and totally fake news,” Johnson told the Post. “The
  Trump administration is working in lockstep to eliminate information silos and
  to prevent illegal aliens from taking advantage of benefits meant for
  hardworking American taxpayers,” she added. In fact, undocumented immigrants
  paid $96.7bn in federal, state and local taxes in 2022, including $59.4bn to
  the federal government, helping to fund social security and Medicare, despite
  being excluded from most benefits, according to an analysis from the Institute
  on Taxation and Economic Policy thinktank. DHS told the Post that its
  agreement with IRS “outlines a process to ensure that sensitive taxpayer
  information is protected, while allowing law enforcement to effectively pursue
  criminal violations”. Pressure on federal agencies to conform to
  administration priorities has also led to pressures on the Census Bureau to
  conduct a mid-decade population review as well as the firing of Bureau of
  Labor head last week after it published a unfavorable job report. After being
  dismissed on Friday, Long, a former six-term Missouri congressman, said that
  he would be the new US ambassador to Iceland. “It is a honor to serve my
  friend President Trump and I am excited to take on my new role as the
  ambassador to Iceland,” Long said in post on X. “I am thrilled to answer his
  call to service and deeply committed to advancing his bold agenda. Exciting
  times ahead!” He followed that up with a more humorous entry that referred to
  former TV Superman actor Dean Cain’s decision, at 59, to join to the
  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency. “I saw where Former Superman
  actor Dean Cain says he’s joining ICE so I got all fired up and thought I’d do
  the same. So I called @realDonaldTrump last night and told him I wanted to
  join ICE and I guess he thought I said Iceland? Oh well.”
