  The former Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioners and non-partisan
  economic groups have criticized Donald Trump’s shock firing of BLS
  commissioner Erika McEntarfer after the July jobs report data revealed jobs
  growth stalled this summer. Trump, without any evidence to back his claims,
  alleged McEntarfer “faked” employment numbers in the run-up to the 2024
  election to boost Kamala Harris’s chances and said that the recent data was
  “rigged” to make Trump and Republicans look bad. The Trump administration has
  continued to repeat the allegations. The National Economic Council director
  Kevin Hassett, a Trump appointee, has claimed “all over the US government,
  there have been people who have been resisting Trump everywhere they can,” in
  justifying the firing. Friends of BLS, a group chaired by former BLS
  commissioners Erica Groshen, an Obama appointee, and William Beach, Trump’s
  appointee during his first term, strongly criticized the firing of McEntarfer,
  Trump’s allegations, and called on Congress to act. “We call on Congress to
  respond immediately, to investigate the factors that led to Commissioner
  McEntarfer’s removal, to strongly urge the Commissioner’s continued service,
  and ensure that the nonpartisan integrity of the position is retained,”
  Friends of BLS wrote in a statement. “This rationale for firing Dr McEntarfer
  is without merit and undermines the credibility of federal economic statistics
  that are a cornerstone of intelligent economic decision-making by businesses,
  families, and policymakers.” The Association of Public Data Users, the
  National Association for Business Economics and the American Economic
  Association also criticized the firing. “Under the law, disliking the data is
  not a qualifying reason to remove the BLS Commissioner from her four-year
  appointment. Under our democracy, it is unacceptable to fire someone for
  publishing data collected in accordance with scientific standards,” the
  Association of Public Data Users said in a statement, echoing the call for
  Congress “to respond immediately, to investigate the factors that led to
  Commissioner McEntarfer’s removal, to strongly urge the BLS Commissioner’s
  continued service, and ensure that the nonpartisan integrity of the position
  is retained.” Beach added in a social media post: “the totally groundless
  firing of Dr. Erika McEntarfer, my successor as Commissioner of Labor
  Statistics at BLS, sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the statistical
  mission of the Bureau.” Beach was nominated by Trump as commissioner of the
  Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2017, was confirmed by the Senate in 2019 and
  served a full four year term until 2023. In an email, former BLS commissioner
  Kathleen Utgoff, who was appointed and served under the George W Bush
  administration, told the Guardian: “A functioning democracy requires accurate
  data so that workers, businesses, politicians and voters can make good
  decisions. I was at the BLS after the Iraq war. Many people asked me how to
  create something like the BLS there. They could not move forward without data
  on the state of the economy.” Republican US senators Rand Paul, Thom Tillis,
  Cynthia Lummis have also questioned the rationale behind Trump’s firing of BLS
  commissioner McEntarfer. The last jobs report issued by BLS before the
  presidential election in November 2024 showed the US only added 12,000 jobs in
  October 2024, the slowest growth since 2020.
