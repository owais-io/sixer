  John Harris is correct that sexual offending by grooming gangs in many towns
  and cities across England over the past 20 years or so has heightened fears
  about the safety of women and girls and undermined community relations
  (Rightwingers warn of another blaze of summer riots in Britain – but they’re
  the ones striking the match, 10 August). This being the case, it is vital to
  more fully understand the grooming problem by examining it in its wider
  context. It seems undeniable that the on-street grooming model that has so
  dominated our news often involves men of Pakistani heritage. However, research
  by the Home Office-funded Vulnerability Knowledge and Practice Programme
  reveals that only 3.7% of the 115,489 child sexual abuse and exploitation
  (CSAE) offences recorded by the police in England and Wales in 2023 (the most
  recent year for which figures are available) involved “group-based contact
  offences”, of which majority-Pakistani-heritage grooming gangs would have been
  just a part. These figures also reveal that while Asian or British Asian
  individuals accounted for approximately 5% of all CSAE offenders, they make up
  roughly 9% of the British population over the age of 16 years, ie Asians are
  underrepresented in statistics relating to CSAE perpetrators. Similarly, Asian
  or British Asian children represented 4% of CSAE victims. It could be argued
  then that political figures on the right and the left should be exploring why
  the Asian community is responsible for a disproportionately low amount of CSAE
  and examining what UK society might learn from this. Dr Bernard Gallagher
