  Nottingham Forest have agreed a deal for Cuiabano from the Brazilian side
  Botafogo, with the left-back expected to sign a five-year contract at the City
  Ground. It is understood that Forest paid to have an option for the
  22-year-old Brazilian earlier in the summer and have now exercised it, beating
  Brighton to his signature. Cuiabano is expected to arrive in the UK on Sunday
  to complete his medical. With the goalkeeper John Victor – in whom West Ham
  had rekindled their interest after backing out of a deal earlier in the summer
  – also on his way to the East Midlands after agreeing a four-year deal last
  week, that will make it four players who have been bought from Botafogo in
  this window after the arrivals of Jair Cunha and Igor Jesus. They are owned by
  the former Crystal Palace co-owner John Textor. Fulham are reported to closing
  in on a club-record £34.6m deal for the Shakhtar Donetsk winger Kevin. The
  22-year-old Brazilian’s fee is expected to surpass the club’s record £27m they
  paid for Emile Smith Rowe from Arsenal last summer. Aston Villa are open to
  selling Emiliano Martínez before Monday’s transfer deadline, with Manchester
  United weighing up another move for the Argentina goalkeeper. United saw a
  loan inquiry for Martínez dismissed out of hand earlier in the window, with
  Villa willing to part with Martínez only for a significant fee, thought to be
  about £40m. United are mulling over whether to sign a new No 1 and also retain
  an interest in Royal Antwerp’s 23-year-old Senne Lammens, a long-term target.
  Martínez was in tears during Villa’s final home game of last season but, aside
  from United’s loan bid and interest from the Saudi Pro League, firm bids for
  the 32-year-old have not materialised. Villa left Martínez out of their squad
  at home to Crystal Palace on Sunday with his immediate future uncertain. Villa
  signed Marco Bizot from Brest as backup to Martínez and their priority targets
  to replace Martínez have since moved on; Joan García has joined Barcelona and
  Lucas Chevalier has moved to Paris Saint-Germain. On the eve of the season
  Unai Emery suggested Martínez could depart despite beginning the season at
  Villa. “I am so, so happy with him,” Emery said. “Of course, maybe as well, he
  can be in the windows with the possibility to leave.” Meanwhile, Villa are
  closing on a deal for the free agent Victor Lindelöf, who left Manchester
  United in the summer after eight seasons. The 30-year-old Sweden defender has
  been identified because he is a versatile option, capable of playing at
  centre-back and right-back. Villa loaned Chelsea’s Axel Disasi, who also plays
  both positions, for the second half of last season. Jamie Vardy is flying to
  Italy on Sunday to complete a move to the Serie A club Cremonese. The
  38-year-old, who left Leicester City at the end of last season, has been
  considering offers in recent weeks. Vardy – regarded one of Leicester’s
  greatest players having led the line in their Premier League triumph in 2016 –
  is expected to sign an initial one-year contract.
