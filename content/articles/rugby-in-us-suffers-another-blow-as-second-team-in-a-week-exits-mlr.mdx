  Major League Rugby was reduced to eight teams on Wednesday by the withdrawal
  of the Miami Sharks, just a week after a founding team quit the competition
  and two California teams merged. Miami and MLR did not immediately comment but
  multiple league sources confirmed that the Sharks’ withdrawal after two years
  in the league was finalized on Tuesday. The Guardian understands that a
  request to withdraw for 2026 before a potential return in 2027 was rejected by
  team owners – NOLA Gold, the team that announced its exit last week, having
  sought a similar arrangement. NOLA and Miami could reapply to play in 2027,
  the Guardian was told. Last week, after NOLA’s exit and the merger of San
  Diego Legion and RFC LA, it was widely reported that the league could yet fall
  to just seven teams, the number that kicked off the competition in 2018. Utah
  Warriors, like NOLA and San Diego founding MLR members, are seeking new
  investment – a process CEO Kimball Kjar last week told the Guardian was “a
  heavy lift” but going well. Kjar expressed confidence in Utah continuing to
  play. MLR commissioner Nic Benson said he thought the league could continue if
  reduced to just seven teams. News of Miami’s exit will concern executives at
  World Rugby, which has placed the men’s World Cup in the US in 2031, followed
  by the women’s event in 2033. Last month, speaking to reporters in Washington
  DC, World Rugby chief executive Alan Gilpin said the governing body “believed
  … there needs to be a domestic professional league in the US that’s growing
  and thriving [and] we want MLR to be that”. Gilpin also indicated an openness
  to talks with international interests seeking to plant teams on US soil,
  including Super Rugby, the United Rugby Championship and the mooted R360
  breakaway project. On Wednesday, the Guardian sought comment from Benson,
  Miami CEO Milagros Cubelli, and players’ representatives. Miami entered MLR in
  2024 and reached the playoffs for the first time this year, losing the Eastern
  Conference Semi-Final to New England Free Jacks, who went on to win their
  third successive title. There was an immediate irony in news of Miami’s MLR
  exit. Just two days earlier, Cubelli — the sister of Miami and Argentina
  scrum-half Tomas Cubelli — was named MLR Major League Rugby Executive of the
  Year. In comments released by the league on Monday, Cubelli said: “We are a
  new team at a starting level, so you have to be smart in how you use your
  resources. “I have a strong background in entertainment and production, so I
  think I brought this experience to the Sharks to have a good gameday
  experience and an interesting, attractive brand. I’m proud and very happy. And
  I love to win.” Cubelli also said sponsorship was “one of the big successes of
  2025”, as the Sharks “grew sponsorship revenue to almost 20%” “There’s a
  professional rugby team in Miami that is doing things well, that is eager to
  share the fun of this sport with the people in the community,” she added. “The
  doors are wide open.” On Wednesday afternoon, the Miami website still
  advertised “Season 2026” as “Coming Soon”. “Come enjoy the Sharks experience,”
  it said. Martin Pengelly writes on Substack at The National Maul, on rugby in
