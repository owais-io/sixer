  There must be a rule printed on parchment somewhere at the BBC that says all
  big wildlife documentaries must feature a sweeping shot of the African
  savannah at the top of episode one. Wildebeest or buffalo must roam
  majestically across the grasslands in search of water, only for one of the
  herd to be brought down by a cunning lion or cheetah. The awe is bittersweet:
  sorry, big guy, but a cat’s got to eat. This sappingly familiar narrative
  plays out in the opening instalment of Parenthood, a Sunday-evening naturefest
  narrated by David Attenborough, before we have blown the steam off our tea. It
  sets us up for a show that offers BBC One natural history in a cuter, less
  spectacular and groundbreaking mode than the channel’s classic shows – but the
  suspicion that it may not have anything fresh to impart is soon dispelled. Our
  interest picks up as we leave Botswana – with its lionesses teaching cubs to
  hunt buffalo and then having to implement a shared-parenting protocol when one
  of the mums is gored to death in the melee – and dive into the ocean, to a
  reef off the Indonesian coast. A boxer crab sits on 1,000 eggs, keeping her
  strength up via the ingenious life hack of holding an anemone in each claw and
  sucking plankton off the tentacles. An ugly, crusty cuttlefish attacks, but
  anemones are weapons as well as tasty pom-poms, so the boxer crab survives.
  Then a jealous rival crab mother, rubbing her claws together in the background
  like a 1940s movie villain, attempts to take the anemones by force. Pincers
  furiously pince, but, like all the best matriarchs of large families, our pal
  with 1,000 children always has another clever trick. Next, we are off to wild
  Arizona, where it’s dating season: a young male is looking for a good hole. He
  is a burrowing owl; any prospective mate will want him to have secured a home,
  which for this species is a burrow abandoned by another animal. When he has
  found a spot that isn’t still occupied by the angry rodent who dug it, or
  already colonised by other owls, he and his new partner settle in and have
  chicks, which consigns them to a long spell of thankless hunting, feeding and
  saving the offspring from being eaten by roadrunners. Then the chicks grow up,
  glare at their parents contemptuously – although that could just be the
  default owl countenance – and leave the nest. What the ageing, knackered Mr
  and Mrs Burrowing-Owl do once they have fulfilled their nurturing duties and
  finally have time for themselves isn’t specified, but even a weary owl divorce
  couldn’t be as dispiriting as the fate of the African social spider in
  Namibia. She is the headline act of the episode, initially thanks to the
  creepy – even for spiders – way in which she and her sisters hunt. Finding
  prey that has become snagged in their giant Miss-Havisham’s-hair mess of a
  nest involves a horrific game of grandma’s footsteps, all of them moving
  together and then stopping dead, as one, so they can listen for tiny
  vibrations. But when her many kids grow up and Mum gets old, her own movements
  across the silky filaments become jerky and erratic. In spider language, this
  sends a clear message: eat me. Being devoured alive by ungrateful children is
  as bad as it gets. The galumphing cuteness of lowland gorillas in Gabon, where
  a silverback dad is eyed casually by his other half as she muses on whether to
  trade him in for someone younger and fitter, is benign in comparison, as is a
  tale of endangered iberian lynx that upturns the usual warnings about
  humankind’s malign influence on the natural world. Mother and baby lynx live
  prosperously as a result of farming practices that have been recalibrated to
  benefit the wildlife. Both sequences are merely pleasant diversions rather
  than spicily relatable parenting fables, the rhythm of which is also
  interrupted by a trip to a drying river in Tanzania, where an imminent lack of
  water is a problem for a hippo mum who is a better provider and protector when
  she is sploshing about. The trek into the dry wilderness for food looks as if
  it will develop into an allegory about the difficulty of performing crucial
  tasks with a toddler trailing behind, but then lions turn up, so it devolves
  into the old story of one of the pack losing their nerve and becoming a cat
  treat. If lions are to keep their place as the stars of nature documentaries,
  they need to come up with some new ideas. Parenthood, however, has just about
  enough of those to survive. • Parenthood airs on BBC One and is available on
  BBC iPlayer in the UK. It will air on Network 10 in Australia, with an airdate
  yet to be announced.
