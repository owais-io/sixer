  As five days of strike action by resident doctors come to an end, the BMA has
  written asking me to return to the negotiating table. I’ve responded, with the
  irony of their letter being that I never left the table. We are back to where
  we were two weeks ago, when I sat down in good faith and offered to work
  intensively with them over a few weeks to negotiate a package of measures that
  would make a real difference in meeting the costs of doctors’ training, the
  costs associated with being a doctor and the lack of promotion opportunities.
  The only difference between now and a fortnight ago is the damage that the BMA
  has done to the NHS through its reckless strike action. Thanks to the hard
  work of NHS leaders and the heroic efforts of frontline staff who stepped up,
  including many resident doctors who showed up for work, the disruption was not
  as bad as it might have been. We managed to protect more operations and
  procedures than in previous years, and our accident and emergency response
  times improved during the period of strike action. But I do not want for a
  moment to play down the real impact of strike action on patients. The BMA has
  made no bones about the fact that it wanted to do damage to the progress we
  are making on cutting waiting lists and waiting times, and use the suffering
  of patients as leverage against the government. It cannot duck the
  consequences of its actions now. On Saturday, I spoke to a patient whose
  kidney cancer surgery has been postponed by a month until the end of August. I
  rang him personally to apologise because, having been through kidney cancer
  myself, I know exactly how it feels to wait, and the impact the fear and
  anxiety has on our families and close friends. It was just one of countless
  examples of cancer care that was affected, not to mention many other
  operations, appointments and procedures. We are still counting the costs of
  strike action on patients and stretched NHS budgets – budgets that doctors are
  relying on to deliver real improvements to their working conditions, as well
  as to patient care. Doctors are not the only staff I am responsible for in the
  NHS. The Royal College of Nursing will shortly publish a survey of its members
  and, without having seen the results, I have spent enough time with our nurses
  to know that they have not felt valued by the previous government and they are
  looking to Labour to deliver meaningful change to their profession. The GMB
  union has made similar representations on behalf of paramedics. Unite returned
  a negative ballot this week. Unison, the largest trade union in the country,
  knows better than anyone that staff right across the NHS are looking for
  material improvements to their pay and conditions. Many of them will never
  earn as much as the lowest-paid doctor. I have committed to work with them
  through the NHS staff council to make sure that we drive real change for their
  members, too. None of them have had a pay rise of 28.9%. Only resident doctors
  can claim to have received the highest pay rise in the public sector two years
  in a row. No wonder other NHS staff have looked on aghast at the action of the
  BMA. The BMA’s demands, and the speed with which it launched a strike – and a
  five-day strike at that – have left many other NHS staff, most of them paid
  far less than doctors, dismayed and appalled. The BMA is now adding jobs to
  its pay dispute, presumably because its members agree that picking a fight on
  pay after a 28.9% pay increase is unprecedented and unreasonable, and they are
  more worried about whether they have jobs to go into. They are right to be
  concerned, but working with the BMA to address doctor unemployment and career
  bottlenecks are among a number of things we are able and willing to do to
  improve the lives of doctors. All I ask of the BMA is two things. The first is
  to drop this unnecessary and unreasonable rush to strike action. It harms
  doctors, it harms patients and it is fundamentally self-defeating, because it
  leaves the NHS with less money to address the issues that doctors care about.
  The second is to recognise that this government has a responsibility to all
  NHS staff and, above all, to patients. We can’t fix everything for everyone
  everywhere all at once. Labour didn’t break the NHS, nor did the doctors.
  Patients are looking to us to work together, as a team, to get their NHS back
  on its feet and build an NHS fit for the future. The past 12 months has shown
  what this government and the NHS can achieve when we pull together. Waiting
  lists are at their lowest levels in two years and it feels like the NHS is
  finally moving in the right direction. It should be clear to the BMA by now
  that it will lose a war with this government. It’s not too late for us both to
  win the peace. Wes Streeting is secretary of state for health and social care
