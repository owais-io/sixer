  A huge wildfire in central California has threatened hundreds of homes, with
  blazes churning through the brush-covered hillsides in Los Padres national
  forest. At least three people were reported injured, and more than 450
  structures were under threat by the Gifford fire, officials said on Monday.
  The fire had scorched more than 72,000 acres (29,000 hectares) as of Monday
  evening, after the blaze grew out of several smaller fires that erupted Friday
  along State Route 166 between Santa Maria and Bakersfield. The fire was
  burning along coastal Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties, north of Los
  Angeles. By Monday night, the fire was considered 5% contained, according to
  the CalFire state agency. Officials had earlier cautioned residents conditions
  could rapidly change due to erratic fire behavior. Hotter and drier weather in
  the forecast is expected to “facilitate rapid and sustained fire growth”,
  according to an incident report issued on Monday. More than 1,000 firefighters
  were scrambling to make progress against the flames, before so-called
  sundowner winds whip up around dusk. The National Weather Service had said
  gusts could reach 25mph (40km/h) in the fire area. The cause of the fire is
  under investigation. One motorist suffered burn injuries after getting out of
  his vehicle and being overrun by flames and was forced to be hospitalized,
  according to Flemming Bertelson, a US Forest Service spokesperson. Two
  contract workers helping firefighters also suffered injuries when their
  all-terrain vehicle overturned. Ranchers were also forced to evacuate cattle
  as aircrafts conducted water drops on rapidly spreading flames, the Associated
  Press reported. Don Fregulia, an operations section chief for the California
  interagency incident management team, said in a Monday afternoon update that
  firefighters were battling “extremely challenging and difficult terrain” in
  the San Rafael Wilderness area, which is part of the national forest. He said
  smoke was making it difficult for aircrafts to see and authorities were using
  infrared. There was cleaner air on the northern area of the fire, he said, and
  firefighters had some success containing the spread in certain areas. A
  heatwave could exacerbate fire risks later this week, with temperatures
  expected to climb above 100F (38C) in parts of inland southern California from
  Wednesday through at least Saturday, the LA Times reported. The heat is also
  expected to impact inland areas in the northern part of the state. Conditions
  across California continue to be primed for high fire risk after a warmer and
  drier spring left landscapes parched. Fire activity typically accelerates in
  the state around the end of summer and into autumn, but wildfire activity has
  already been trending above normal, according to CalFire.
