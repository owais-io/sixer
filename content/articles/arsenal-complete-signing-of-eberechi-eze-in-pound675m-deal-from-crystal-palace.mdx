  Arsenal have completed the signing of Eberechi Eze from Crystal Palace in a
  deal worth £67.5m. The 27-year-old has joined on a four-year contract, with
  the option of a fifth year, after Arsenal beat Tottenham to his signature.
  Spurs had been the frontrunners to sign the England international after
  stepping up their interest last weekend, but their deal was hijacked by
  Arsenal on Wednesday. They moved in after Kai Havertz sustained a knee injury
  during their win against Manchester United at Old Trafford. “We are absolutely
  delighted to bring Eberechi to Arsenal,” Mikel Arteta said. “He is a powerful
  and exciting player who will give us a new dimension in our attacking game.
  What stands out just as much as his talent and intelligence as a player is the
  way he has worked hard throughout his career to get where he is today. “His
  journey, his mentality and his ambition are exactly what we want in our team
  and we love how much it means to him and his family to be joining our club. We
  all look forward to start working with Eberechi soon.” Arsenal, who confirmed
  the signing before Saturday’s home match against Leeds, have paid £60m up
  front, with a further £7.5m in bonuses. Eze’s previous club QPR, who he left
  for £19.5m in 2019, are due 15% of the profits Palace make on the deal. Eze
  will wear the No 10 shirt. His arrival at Arsenal bridges a gap of 14 years to
  when he was released by their academy at the age of 13. During his six years
  at Palace, he made 169 appearances and scored 40 goals, including the winner
  against Manchester City in May’s FA Cup final to secure the club’s first major
  honour. The Palace manager, Oliver Glasner, had praised Eze’s conduct through
  this summer’s transfer speculation. The attacking midfielder started the
  Community Shield win against Liverpool and the opening draw against Chelsea in
  the Premier League. He was expected to play in the Europa Conference League
  qualifier against Fredrikstad on Thursday, but was withdrawn from the squad
  after a deal with Arsenal was agreed.
