  The Ukrainian film-maker Alexander Rodnyansky was once at the very centre of
  Russia’s cultural life. Over two decades he ran one of Russia’s biggest media
  conglomerates, produced some of the most celebrated films in recent Russian
  history – including the Oscar nominees Leviathan and Loveless – and helped
  bring Russian cinema to international prominence. But since the invasion of
  Ukraine, Rodnyansky said, he has witnessed a huge shift in Russian cinema.
  “The most popular genre in Russian cinema today is fairytales,” the
  64-year-old told the Guardian. “They adapt all the stories we grew up with.
  There’s no single social drama, no movie reflecting life during the war. “The
  only source of financing is the state. If you want to make a movie about the
  war itself, the only option is propaganda. Movies about ‘Nazi Ukrainians’
  killing decent Russians, about the Russian army entering Ukraine to save the
  people of Donbas from these fascists and nationalists. It’s the most stupid
  bullshit you can ever see.” Rodnyansky’s comments emphasise a recent trend of
  lavish adaptations of folk tales and children’s stories becoming runaway hits
  in Russia. In 2023, Cheburashka, a children’s book adaptation, earned more
  than 6.5bn rubles (about £60m) at the domestic box office, becoming the
  highest-grossing Russian film ever. The film-maker’s new documentary, Notes of
  a True Criminal, premiering in Venice on Wednesday, rejects that fantasy,
  opting instead for a deeply personal meditation on Ukraine’s history, the
  ongoing fallout from the collapse of the Soviet Union, and how these events
  have shaped his family across generations. It is his first documentary in more
  than 30 years and what he calls “the most personal film of my life”. “It’s so
  personal that I decided to fund it on my own, on a very small budget. In 40,
  50 years it can be a video diary for my kids and grandkids. It’s not a
  political movie, or an urgent report on what’s going on in Ukraine. I wanted
  to study the human cost of the war,” he said. The film is told through a
  series of vignettes, including footage from Ukrainian soldiers (some still
  alive, some dead), family videos, and clips from historical wars and tragedies
  including Chornobyl. Its title comes directly from Rodnyansky’s own recent
  ordeal. Last year, the film-maker was sentenced in absentia by a Moscow court
  to eight and a half years in prison for spreading “fake news” about the
  Russian army. Russia’s justice ministry declared him a “foreign agent”. For a
  man who spent much of his career inside the Russian establishment, the ruling
  was a personal rupture and a political inevitability. “It’s been quite an
  experience for me,” he said. “I never had a Russian passport and citizenship.
  Somehow I felt it was not right, because I had my Ukrainian sentiment and
  identity. But at the same time I was in love with Russian film history and
  culture, I was shaped by Russian literature. I had amazing friends in Moscow.
  “I’ve [since] lost the connection with some of them who pretend this life is
  normal, who don’t speak out.” Two days after the invasion started, Rodnyansky
  said, a letter written by the Russian defence minister to the culture minister
  “demanded to eradicate the participation of President Zelenskyy and myself in
  the Russian cultural agenda”. “I never knew I was a part of Russian cultural
  agenda,” he said. “The next day, my wife and I packed our cases and left our
  home.” Though he makes light of his sentence – “it’s a very cinematic
  sentence,” he joked, citing Fellini’s masterpiece 8½ – he said the
  repercussions were serious. “It’s part of their strategy of intimidation of
  people who live in Russia. It also makes me think twice before travelling. I
  don’t go to countries with close ties to Russia.” The director said he was
  wary of recent diplomacy. Of Donald Trump’s summit with Vladimir Putin in
  Alaska this month, he said: “Ukrainians went absolutely crazy over this
  footage of Putin on the red carpet. A lot of Ukrainians want the war to end,
  but they don’t trust Trump to end it in a satisfying way. There’s a line
  between compromise and capitulation, and capitulation is unacceptable.” The
  war has reshaped relationships between Ukrainians and Russians, he said.
  “Ukrainians are traumatised. Most don’t have the emotional resources to judge
  between good and bad Russians. They believe every single Russian is morally
  responsible. But there are a lot of Russians who are supportive of Ukraine.
  More than a million left Russia when the war started, and many criticise the
  Kremlin.” Last month, dozens of Ukrainian writers and artists urged the UK’s
  Royal Ballet and Opera to drop the Russian opera singer Anna Netrebko from its
  new London season, calling her a “longtime symbol of cultural propaganda” for
  the Russian government. Should she and other Russian artists be boycotted? “We
  need to separate people who support Putin from those who speak out against
  him,” Rodnyansky said. “There are plenty of amazing Russian cultural figures
  who have strongly opposed Putin for years. Netrebko supported Putin in 2014,
  but as far as I know she condemned the war afterwards. People can change their
  opinions. “Even during the second world war, everyone knew the difference
  between [Erich Maria] Remarque or Thomas Mann and German cultural figures
  supporting the Nazis.”
