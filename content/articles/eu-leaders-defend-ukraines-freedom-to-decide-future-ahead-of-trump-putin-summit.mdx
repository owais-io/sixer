  EU leaders made a rallying call to defend Ukraine’s freedom to decide its own
  future in advance of their virtual summit with Donald Trump – convened to
  discuss US strategy before the president’s talks with Vladimir Putin on
  Friday. With the exception of Hungary, all EU leaders signed a joint
  statement, with Kaja Kallas, the EU foreign policy chief, also calling for the
  Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to attend the Trump-Putin summit in
  Alaska on Friday. Trump insists his meeting with Putin is a “feel-out” to
  gauge the Russian leader’s willingness to compromise, but European leaders
  fear Trump will be lured into a joint declaration with Moscow that involves
  irretrievable concessions before substantive talks between Ukraine and Russia.
  Putin may also use the meeting to advance a wider agenda of normalisation of
  relations between the US and Russia, a development that would start to lock
  Trump into economic cooperation with Moscow rather than confrontation. The
  White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, confirmed on Tuesday that the
  summit would be a one-on-one meeting between Trump and Putin, and that it
  would take place in Anchorage, Alaska. She further lowered expectations for
  any kind of agreement, saying that it would be a “listening exercise” for
  Trump. Zelenskyy on Tuesday ruled out removing Ukrainian troops from the
  Donbas region, probably a key aim for Russia, and described the summit as a
  “victory” for Putin. “First, he will meet on US territory, which I consider
  his personal victory,” Zelenskyy said. “Second, he is coming out of isolation
  because he is meeting on US territory. Third, with this meeting, he has
  somehow postponed sanctions.” Europe has also vocally backed Ukraine. The EU
  leaders said on Tuesday: “Meaningful negotiations can only take place in the
  context of a ceasefire or reduction of hostilities,” adding: “We share the
  conviction that a diplomatic solution must protect Ukraine’s and Europe’s
  vital security interests. “A Ukraine capable of defending itself effectively
  is an integral part of any future security guarantees.” They added that EU
  nations were ready to contribute further to security guarantees. The Hungarian
  prime minister, Viktor Orbán, Putin’s longstanding ally in Europe, mocked the
  statement from his EU counterparts, saying: “The statement attempts to set
  conditions for a meeting to which leaders of the EU were not invited. The fact
  that the EU was left on the sidelines is sad enough as it is. The only thing
  that could make things worse is if we started providing instructions from the
  bench.” Denying he was Putin’s puppet, he added: “The only sensible action for
  EU leaders is to initiate an EU-Russia summit, based on the example of the
  US-Russia meeting.” Zelenskyy said there was no sign of Russia seeking peace,
  and said it was instead preparing a fresh military offensive. Ukraine admitted
  it was trying to prevent a decisive Russian breakthrough in the north of the
  Donetsk region. European leaders are clinging to the hope that Trump’s recent
  impatience with Putin for failing to agree a 30-day ceasefire will not
  dissolve on contact with the Russian leader. Recent signs suggested Trump was
  slowly hardening his stance towards Russia, including resuming intelligence
  cooperation with Ukraine, a willingness to supply arms for Ukraine if bought
  by the EU and the threat of secondary sanctions against countries that traded
  in Russian oil. But Europe’s painstaking diplomatic progress with Trump,
  including a successful Nato summit in June, now looks to be at risk. Trump has
  said any peace deal would involve “some swapping of territories to the
  betterment of both” Russia and Ukraine, a phrasing that hides the reality that
  virtually all the territory in question is Ukrainian. Russia has yet to
  specify if it will hand back any of the territory it has seized by force since
  it launched its first military attacks more than 11 years ago. “Meaningful
  negotiations can only take place in the context of a ceasefire or reduction of
  hostilities,” the European leaders said. They added: “We share the conviction
  that a diplomatic solution must protect Ukraine’s and Europe’s vital security
  interests.” Kallas added: “The sequencing of the steps is important. First, an
  unconditional ceasefire with a strong monitoring system and ironclad security
  guarantees.” In the statement early on Tuesday, the leaders were careful not
  to express criticism of Trump, saying they welcomed “the efforts of President
  Trump towards ending Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine”. They added:
  “A just and lasting peace that brings stability and security must respect
  international law, including the principles of independence, sovereignty,
  territorial integrity and that international borders must not be changed by
  force.” Trump played down the possibility of a breakthrough in Alaska but said
  he anticipated “constructive conversations” with Putin, a piece of expectation
  management that is unlikely to reassure European leaders. “This is really a
  feel-out meeting a little bit,” Trump told reporters at the White House.
  “We’re going to see what he has in mind and if it’s a fair deal, I’ll reveal
  it to the European Union leaders and to Nato leaders and also to President
  Zelenskyy,” Trump said. “I may say: ‘Lots of luck, keep fighting.’ Or I may
  say: ‘We can make a deal.’” Trump was also critical of Zelenskyy on Monday,
  noting that Ukraine’s leader had been in power for the duration of the war and
  said “nothing happened” during that time. He has made it clear that he sees no
  prospect of Ukraine regaining territory it has lost, and is frustrated that
  European leaders, worried about Ukrainian morale, remain so reluctant to
  acknowledge this reality in public. Zelenskyy refers to a de facto loss of
  territory, but will refuse to accept the loss in any peace treaty.
