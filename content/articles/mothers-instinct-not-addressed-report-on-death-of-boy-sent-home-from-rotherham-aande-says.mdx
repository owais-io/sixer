  A report into the death of a five-year-old Rotherham boy sent home from
  A&amp;E has called for national guidance to take into account parents’
  intuition that “something feels very wrong” about their child. Yusuf Mahmud
  Nazir died of pneumonia and sepsis at Sheffield children’s hospital on 23
  November 2022, almost a week after his parents first raised concerns that he
  was unwell. He was seen by numerous clinicians who failed to listen to the
  concerns of his mother, Soniya Ahmed, that something was seriously wrong with
  Yusuf, instead relying solely on data that suggested he was not seriously ill.
  The independent patient safety investigation (IPSI) report, commissioned by
  NHS England in response to significant concerns raised by Yusuf’s family,
  recommended that caregivers’ concerns be taken more seriously when assessing
  children. The report asked healthcare organisations to consider treating
  parental intuition as a “legitimate and vital form of evidence” and asked:
  “What becomes possible when the instinct of a mother is given the same
  attention as a monitor reading?” The report, written by Dr Peter Carter, an
  independent healthcare consultant and former chief executive and general
  secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, stated: “The system is not designed
  to capture ‘something feels very wrong’ as an input, and thus a gap opens
  between family and clinicians. “In paediatric practice, it is increasingly
  recognised that relying solely on quantitative metrics can lead to false
  reassurance. A child might still have ‘normal’ observations while mounting a
  serious internal struggle, compensating such as maintaining blood pressure
  until crashing.” It comes as a patient safety initiative known as Martha’s
  rule is being piloted in hospitals in England, giving parents the legal right
  to an urgent second opinion if they feel their child’s condition is
  deteriorating and their concerns are not being addressed. It is named after
  13-year-old Martha Mills, who died in 2021 from preventable sepsis at King’s
  College hospital in London after a cycling accident, and whose parents raised
  repeated concerns about her declining condition that were not taken into
  account by clinicians. In Yusuf’s case, the report found his parents felt
  excluded from decision-making and his mother’s instinct that he was unwell was
  “repeatedly not addressed across services”. It made 16 recommendations for
  local and national healthcare bodies and found 12 failings, including
  healthcare professionals failing to communicate properly with each other or
  maintain adequate records and a lack of training. Ahmed said: “The failings
  identified are truly shocking. Yusuf deserved better; every child does. I will
  never stop speaking his name. I will never stop fighting for him. We demand
  accountability, we demand change.” Speaking at a press conference in
  Rotherham, Ahmed said: “For the medical staff there are lessons to be learned
  from this tragedy, but for us, our life, Yusuf has been taken away from us in
  the most horrific way. Every night when I close my eyes I hear Yusuf’s
  helpless voice in my ears saying: ‘Mummy, I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe, I
  really can’t.’ “And the image of him being handed over to me after his life
  ended, as though someone has torn my heart out and placed it in my hands.”
  Yusuf’s family have written to the coroner asking for an inquest into his
  death. Yusuf, who had asthma, was taken to the GP with a sore throat on 15
  November 2022 and was prescribed antibiotics by an advanced nurse
  practitioner. Later that evening, his parents took him to Rotherham hospital
  urgent and emergency care centre (UECC) where he was seen in the early hours
  of the morning after a six-hour wait. He was discharged with a diagnosis of
  severe tonsillitis and given an extended prescription of antibiotics. Two days
  later Yusuf was given further antibiotics by his GP for a possible chest
  infection, but his family became so concerned they called an ambulance and
  insisted the paramedics take him to Sheffield children’s hospital, rather than
  Rotherham. Yusuf was admitted to the intensive care unit on 21 November but
  developed multi-organ failure and suffered several cardiac arrests that he did
  not survive. The report, published on Thursday by NHS England, which came
  after meetings between the family and the health secretary, Wes Streeting, is
  the second into Yusuf’s care. A 2023 internal review by NHS South Yorkshire
  Integrated Care Board found there were no major failings. Anna Thwaites, a
  partner at the law firm Bindmans who has represented the family from the
  beginning, along with counsel Adam Wagner KC from Doughty Street Chambers,
  said: “This has been a long and difficult journey for the family”. From the
  beginning, they “knew there were issues with Yusuf’s care and treatment… “The
  second investigation revealed for the first time multiple and serious
  failings, but Yusuf’s family had to wait over two and a half years for this be
  revealed; the wait has been agonising for them.” She added: “The family calls
  for action and change. The family do not want Yusuf’s death to be in vain.
  Another child cannot be failed.” Dr Jeff Perring, the executive medical
  director at Sheffield children’s NHS foundation trust, said: “The report
  identifies important areas for learning and improvement, not only for us at
  Sheffield Children’s but also across the wider healthcare system. We are
  dedicated to delivering the improvements outlined in the report’s
  recommendations.” Dr Jo Beahan, the medical director at Rotherham NHS
  foundation trust, said: “Our deepest sympathies remain with Yusuf’s family
  following such a sad loss of a loved family member. We fully cooperated with
  this investigation into Yusuf’s care. We have taken steps to address the
  recommendation and also the concerns raised by Yusuf’s family. Our thoughts
  continue to be with Yusuf’s family.” • This article was amended on 20 August
  2025 to remove an incorrect assertion given by Anna Thwaites, who said that
  “the first ‘independent’ investigation found that there were no failures
  linked with Sheffield children’s hospital”.
