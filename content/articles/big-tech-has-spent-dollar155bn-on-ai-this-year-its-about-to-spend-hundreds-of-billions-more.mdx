  The US’s largest companies have spent 2025 locked in a competition to spend
  more money than one another, lavishing $155bn on the development of artificial
  intelligence, more than the US government has spent on education, training,
  employment and social services in the 2025 fiscal year so far. Based on the
  most recent financial disclosures of Silicon Valley’s biggest players, the
  race is about to accelerate to hundreds of billions in a single year. Over the
  past two weeks, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet, Google’s parent, have
  shared their quarterly public financial reports. Each disclosed that their
  year-to-date capital expenditure, a figure that refers to the money companies
  spend to acquire or upgrade tangible assets, already totals tens of billions.
  Capex, as the term is abbreviated, is a proxy for technology companies’
  spending on AI because the technology requires gargantuan investments in
  physical infrastructure, namely data centers, which require large amounts of
  power, water and expensive semiconductor chips. Google said during its most
  recent earnings call that its capital expenditure “primarily reflects
  investments in servers and data centers to support AI”. Meta’s year-to-date
  capital expenditure amounted to $30.7bn, doubling the $15.2bn figure from the
  same time last year, per its earnings report. For the most recent quarter
  alone, the company spent $17bn on capital expenditures, also double the same
  period in 2024, $8.5bn. Alphabet reported nearly $40bn in capex to date for
  the first two quarters of the current fiscal year, and Amazon reported
  $55.7bn. Microsoft said it would spend more than $30bn in the current quarter
  to build out the data centers powering its AI services. Microsoft CFO Amy Hood
  said the current quarter’s capex would be at least 50% more than the outlay
  during the same period a year earlier and greater than the company’s record
  capital expenditures of $24.2bn in the quarter to June. “We will continue to
  invest against the expansive opportunity ahead,” Hood said. For the coming
  fiscal year, big tech’s total capital expenditure is slated to balloon
  enormously, surpassing the already eye-popping sums of the previous year.
  Microsoft plans to unload about $100bn on AI in the next fiscal year, CEO
  Satya Nadella said Wednesday. Meta plans to spend between $66bn and $72bn.
  Alphabet plans to spend $85bn, significantly higher than its previous
  estimation of $75bn. Amazon estimated that its 2025 expenditure would come to
  $100bn as it plows money into Amazon Web Services, which analysts now expect
  to amount to $118bn. In total, the four tech companies will spend more than
  $400bn on capex in the coming year, according to the Wall Street Journal. The
  multibillion-dollar figures represent mammoth investments, which the Journal
  points out is larger than the European Union’s quarterly spending on defense.
  However, the tech giants can’t seem to spend enough for their investors.
  Microsoft, Google and Meta informed Wall Street analysts last quarter that
  their total capex would be higher than previously estimated. In the case of
  all three companies, investors were thrilled, and shares in each company
  soared after their respective earnings calls. Microsoft’s market
  capitalization hit $4tn the day after its report. Even Apple, the cagiest of
  the tech giants, signaled that it would boost its spending on AI in the coming
  year by a major amount, either via internal investments or acquisitions. The
  company’s quarterly capex rose to $3.46bn, up from $2.15bn during the same
  period last year. The iPhone maker reported blockbuster earnings Thursday,
  with rebounding iPhone sales and better-than-expected business in China, but
  it is still seen as lagging farthest behind on development and deployment of
  AI products among the tech giants. Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, said Thursday that
  the company was reallocating a “fair number” of employees to focus on
  artificial intelligence and that the “heart of our AI strategy” is to increase
  investments and “embed” AI across all of its devices and platforms. Cook
  refrained from disclosing exactly how much Apple is spending, however. “We are
  significantly growing our investment, I’m not putting specific numbers behind
  that,” he said. Smaller players are trying to keep up with the incumbents’
  massive spending and capitalize on the gold rush. OpenAI announced at the end
  of the week of earnings that it had raised $8.3bn in investment, part of a
  planned $40bn round of funding, valuing the startup, whose ChatGPT chatbot
  kicked in 2022, at $300bn.
