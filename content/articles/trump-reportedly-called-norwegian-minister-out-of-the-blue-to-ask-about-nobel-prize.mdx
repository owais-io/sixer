  Donald Trump cold-called Norway’s finance minister last month to ask about a
  nomination for the Nobel peace prize, Norwegian press reported on Thursday.
  The Norwegian outlet Dagens Næringsliv, citing unnamed sources, reported: “Out
  of the blue, while finance minister Jens Stoltenberg was walking down the
  street in Oslo, Donald Trump called … He wanted the Nobel prize – and to
  discuss tariffs.” The outlet added that it was not the first time that Trump
  had raised the question of a Nobel peace prize nomination to Stoltenberg. In a
  statement to Reuters, Stoltenberg, the former Nato secretary-general, said the
  call focused on tariffs and economic cooperation ahead of Trump’s call with
  Jonas Støre, the Norwegian prime minister. “I will not go into further detail
  about the content of the conversation,” Stoltenberg said, adding that several
  White House officials including the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, and US
  trade representative, Jamieson Greer, were on the call. Each year, the
  five-member Norwegian Nobel committee reviews hundreds of candidates before
  choosing laureates. The committee members are appointed by Norway’s parliament
  according to the will of Alfred Nobel, a 19-century Swedish industrialist.
  Laureates are announced in October. Trump has previously complained multiple
  times about not receiving the Nobel peace prize, an award which four of his
  predecessors, including Barack Obama, have received. In his most recent
  tirade, Trump took to Truth Social in June, saying: “No, I won’t get a Nobel
  Peace Prize no matter what I do, including Russia/Ukraine, and Israel/Iran,
  whatever those outcomes may be, but the people know, and that’s all that
  matters to me!”
