  Harpsichordist Mahan Esfahani has been working his way steadily through JS
  Bach’s keyboard works for Hyperion and has arrived at one of the great
  monuments of western music. Like so many players, Esfahani has lived with
  Bach’s 48 preludes and fugues, the Well-Tempered Clavier, for more than half
  his life, so that returning to it now, he says, “with decades of performance
  and scholarship behind me, has been both a challenge and a homecoming’.
  Typically, Esfahani comes now to these pieces with his own very personal ideas
  on how they should be presented and performed – “This is a perfectly crafted
  piece of theatre,” he has said – and there is a real sense in his performances
  of each prelude and fugue defining its own dramatic space. The tuning of his
  harpsichord – a modern copy of an early 18th-century two-manual instrument of
  a kind that Bach is known to have played – is designed to give a specific
  colour to each key, for, as Esfahani points out, the “well-tempered” of the
  work’s title, does not indicate, as so often assumed, a work composed to
  demonstrate the advantages of equal temperament, but conversely the way in
  which just tuning may be adapted to suit the demands of each of the major and
  minor scales. At the end of the sequence, after the B minor fugue, Esfahani
  makes a point of repeating the C major prelude, Goldberg-style, to emphasise,
  he says, how so many of the preludes are variations of the form of the first,
  “[an] harmonic outline over which a melodic kernel is repeated throughout”. It
  is one of Esfahani’s more contentious ideas, yet his approach never seems
  wilful or perverse, and with a few exceptions – to my ears, the C sharp minor
  fugue does seem unnecessarily lugubrious – his choice of tempi is
  uncontroversial, his shaping of each movement wonderfully lucid. Listen on
