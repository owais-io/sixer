  “Did I say autism and ADHD? My god, I’m so brave,” Emma Louise Lobb laughs on
  Zoom. Bravery is necessary when “coming out” as anything outside the norm, but
  for the musician, who performs as Emma Louise, letting the world know about
  her AuDHD – the unofficial term for both autism spectrum disorder and
  attention-deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) – is also about self-acceptance.
  The 34-year-old Jungle singer was first diagnosed with ADHD in her twenties,
  but only discovered her autism in the past few years. The two diagnoses have
  put many of her life experiences into perspective. “There was definitely
  grief, especially about the second one [autism],” she says. “I just wish I
  knew [earlier], because I’ve suffered so much, just feeling unworthy and not
  good enough … [That] definitely got me into situations or relationships that
  weren’t very healthy. Looking back, I can see how it all happened.” Lobb is
  not alone. It’s common for women to be diagnosed later in life for ADHD and
  autism, because symptoms are often overlooked or misdiagnosed in childhood. As
  a new understanding and acceptance of neurodiversity emerges, more and more
  people are getting to know themselves. “The last three years, I’ve just been
  peeling back layers and discovering whole new parts of me that I truly love,”
  Lobb says. This experience is central to Dumb, her collaborative album with
  Harley Streten, the producer better known as Flume. Streten and Lobb live in
  Los Angeles, but their Australian home bases are in the northern rivers region
  of New South Wales, where they started making music together. The first song
  they released was Hollow, a track on Flume’s 2022 album Palaces. Sign up for
  the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the
  weekend, every Saturday morning Musically and personally, the pair share an
  understanding. “Harley and I are very similar – we struggle with the same
  things, and we get along really well in a very abstract way that I think
  neurodiverse people would understand,” Lobb says. Streten’s glitchy, sometimes
  abrasive electronica provides a foil for Lobb’s gentle vocals. On lead single
  Easy Goodbye, her voice eventually distorts to transform into a skittering,
  screeching soundscape. Sonically, it is worlds apart from her usual folk-pop,
  although snatches of that peek through on tracks such as the piano-led Monsoon
  and ballad Stay, both of which still build towards subtle explosions. These
  are love songs with an edge. The convergence of musical styles gives both
  musicians a soft place to land. “Emma is a trip – she floats in the clouds and
  I sit somewhere between, tethered to the earth,” Streten says via email. “When
  we are in the studio, we are floating.” Lobb is discomfited by her voice but
  she recognises and appreciates its artistic value. “I think that my voice is
  very shiny and like a little pretty fairy,” she says. “I always wish I could
  scream.” She has employed creative techniques to ease that tension: on her
  last solo album, 2018’s Lilac Everything, she pitched her voice down to make
  it unrecognisable. On Dumb, it is cloaked in different sounds and effects. “I
  love working with Harley, because it gives me the chance to be able to make it
  feral – it’s just so fun watching him transform everything,” Lobb says. “I
  feel like I have permission to, at any moment, change direction, or destroy
  something and make it into something else.” Dumb is not explicitly about
  neurodivergence, but that part of Lobb’s identity is “in the undercurrent of
  everything”. Music provides her with an avenue to communicate when her
  emotions become overwhelming. “If something happens to me … I won’t be able to
  figure it out in my head, and it’ll be so confusing emotionally – and if I let
  it keep going, dysregulating,” she says. “But if I get a guitar or a piano,
  and I close my eyes and play something and start writing … I feel that relief,
  because I have put it in a form that I understand.” The pair adopted the
  mantra of “making it dumb” in the writing and recording process, so that what
  came out was unfiltered and real. When it came time to give the album a name,
  it was a no-brainer; Lobb is aware of the word’s ableist connotations, and
  consulted with fellow neurodivergent people before settling on the title. “I
  feel like it will, at least, open up a conversation,” she says. “We don’t want
  to offend anyone with it … I’m keen to hear what it makes everybody feel,
  especially people who are neurodiverse.” Lobb is also reclaiming a word that
  has been used as a weapon against her all her life. “It captures everything
  that I’ve had to heal and overcome,” she says. “I wouldn’t be able to release
  it if I felt in any part of me that I was less than somebody who’s
  neurotypical.” Dumb by Emma Louise and Flume is out now
