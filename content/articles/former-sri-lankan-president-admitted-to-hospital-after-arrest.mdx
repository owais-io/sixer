  Sri Lanka’s former president was admitted to hospital on Saturday, a day after
  he was charged with using public funds to finance private international
  travel, as the government intensified its crackdown on corruption. Ranil
  Wickremesinghe, 76, was remanded in custody on Friday after being accused of
  using taxpayers’ money to pay for a two-day visit to the UK in September 2023
  to attend a ceremony at the University of Wolverhampton granting an honorary
  professorship to his wife. Wickremesinghe has denied the misuse of state
  money, and said his wife paid her own travel expenses. The visit took place
  upon Wickremesinghe’s return from the G77 summit in Havana and the UN general
  assembly in New York. The offences carry a maximum punishment of 20 years in
  jail and an estimated fine of 16.6m rupees (£41,000). Wickremesinghe, who lost
  Sri Lanka’s last presidential election in September to the leftist leader
  Anura Kumara Dissanayake, was said to be in stable condition after being
  brought to Colombo National hospital. The hospital’s deputy head, Rukshan
  Bellana, told the Agence France-Presse news agency that he had to be treated
  for acute dehydration. “He was a severe diabetic with high blood pressure when
  he was brought in,” Bellana said. Wickremesinghe became president in July 2022
  after Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s resignation following months of protests driven by
  the country’s worst economic downturn since independence. Before assuming the
  presidency, Wickremesinghe, unpopular with protesters as he was seen as an
  ally of the Rajapaksa clan, had been prime minister six times since entering
  politics in 1977, though he never completed a term. In a significant political
  shift for the country last September, Wickremesinghe was replaced by
  Dissanayake, the head of the leftist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) party.
  The JVP has been tarred by its past involvement in some of the worst violence
  in the country’s history, and Dissanayake had sought to soften some of his
  party’s more hardline positions while attracting voters with promises to
  tackle corruption and abuses of power.
