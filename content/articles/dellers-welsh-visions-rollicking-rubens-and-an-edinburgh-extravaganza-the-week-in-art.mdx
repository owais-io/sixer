  Exhibition of the week Edinburgh art festival Artists from Linder to Mike
  Nelson provide the fun in this hugely varied city-wide extravaganza. • Various
  Edinburgh venues, 7-24 August Also showing Carreg Ateb: Vision or Dream?
  Jeremy Deller, Gweni Llwyd, Lewis Prosser and more explore Welsh myths, magic
  and history. • Mostyn, Llandudno, until 27 September Simon Periton ‘National
  Geographic’ Nature meets barbed wire in Periton’s colourful but ironic
  paintings and sculptures. • The Modern Institute Aird’s Lane, Glasgow, until
  27 August Nicolas Party: Copper &amp; Dust 18th-century pastels revisited by
  this Swiss-born former graffiti artist who has also painted a mural of a comic
  punch-up. • Holburne Museum, Bath, until 31 August, mural until 19 October The
  Nina Drucker Bequest British drawings from the 18th to 20th centuries,
  including works by David Cox and John Minton, left to the British Museum by
  Drucker. • British Museum, London, until 21 September Image of the week Two
  years ago a Cambridge-based antiques dealer snapped up an unusual looking
  painting at a house clearance for £150. It was a lucky punt as the mixed media
  artwork turned out to be one of a series of illustrations for an abandoned
  Arabian Nights project by Salvador Dalí. It is now back up for sale at
  auction, but at the slightly steeper estimated price of £20,000 to £30,000.
  Read the full story. What we learned Australians can rent a masterpiece from
  Artbank’s public collection Lost photos by a trans community in the 1960s went
  on show in New York’s Met A rare original proof of David Bailey’s benchmark
  1965 Box of Pin-Ups has been found Tate director Maria Balshaw blames Brexit
  and Covid for a huge slump in visitors Thom Yorke of Radiohead’s work with
  Stanley Donwood was not a hit with our critic Matthew Barney called his new
  show a western ‘that may involve shooting’ The daredevil queen of New York
  graffiti artists recalled scaring Keith Haring Masterpiece of the week The
  Feast of Herod by Peter Paul Rubens, circa 1635-38 Salome in a sinfully red
  frock serves up the head of John the Baptist on a platter in this rollicking
  work by Rubens at his most lavish. The story of the Baptist’s martyrdom – also
  painted by Caravaggio and dramatised by Oscar Wilde with illustrations by
  Aubrey Beardsley – has it that Salome’s mother Herodias got her to demand
  John’s head in return for dancing before her stepfather Herod. Rubens gives it
  a cannibalistic twist: he dwells on the banquet’s food and drink and has the
  head brought up to Herod as an exotic dish. Herodias sticks her fork in its
  tongue. Yummy! Herod looks shocked and nauseated as he is forced to eat the
  reward of his sick lust for his stepdaughter. • Scottish National Gallery,
