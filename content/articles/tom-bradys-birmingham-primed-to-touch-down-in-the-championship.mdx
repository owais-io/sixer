  Unsurprisingly, Tom Brady, a seven-time Super Bowl champion and global
  sporting icon, is braced for the challenges that await Birmingham City, where
  he is a minority owner. “Just because you were successful last year doesn’t
  mean you’re going to be successful this year,” he says, alluding to a season
  that culminated in promotion and a record-breaking tally of 111 points. “You
  have to put the same amount of work, commitment and discipline in – sometimes
  more – because the stakes only get higher. When the competition gets tougher,
  the margin of error gets smaller.” It is his final answer in an interview that
  takes in everything from the “blue-collar nature of Birmingham”, which he
  compares with Cleveland and Cincinnati, to the Championship landscape and the
  bubbling rivalry with Aston Villa, which he was educated on during his first
  visit to England’s second-biggest city after acquiring his 3.3% stake. It is a
  moment detailed in the opening scene of Built in Birmingham: Brady &amp; the
  Blues, the Prime Video documentary series released on Friday, as he travels
  past a giant mural depicting Jude Bellingham and Trevor Francis. “What’s the
  other team here?” he asks. “Fuck them … gonna fuck them up too,” he says,
  smiling. Brady and Tom Wagner, the Birmingham chairman, are in bullish moods
  for our interview. Wagner’s mantra is “if you can’t say it, you can’t do it”
  and he is adamant Birmingham will return to the Premier League. But when? “The
  sooner the better,” he replies. “I think it would be great for the city of
  Birmingham to have an inner-city derby that brings fans together in a
  non-violent way; we don’t want it to be peaceful, we don’t want it to be
  violent either, but we want to allow them the joy of experiencing that great
  rivalry again. I love reading the comments from Villa supporters, but I think
  it’s beyond that. There’s so many other great clubs we would love to compete
  against.” The series contains colourful characters, differing generations of
  supporters. “We’ve had so many rebirths,” says one, Paul Collins, “but they’ve
  all been phantom pregnancies.” There is a potted history taking in Barry Fry
  urinating in all four corners of St Andrew’s to lift a curse and other amusing
  moments. “I fell in love with fixing businesses,” says Wagner, the co-founder
  of Knighthead Capital, the multibillion investment fund that acquired a
  controlling stake two years ago. On their arrival at Birmingham, one-third of
  the ground had been condemned, there was no hot water in the men’s toilets and
  no heating in the executive offices. “We’re not even close to being done, and
  now we’re embarking on an even more ambitious feat,” Wagner says of plans to
  build a sports quarter on a 60-acre site with a 62,000-seat stadium, more than
  double the current capacity. “We want to compete at the top level of the
  Championship [this season].” After their final home game last season, Wagner
  enjoyed a mic-drop moment, telling those present: “The best part of the story
  is just beginning. I promise you this is not the best day we will enjoy
  together.” Perhaps the most surreal moment of the series is Sir David Beckham,
  among the VIP guests for Birmingham’s home win over Wrexham last September,
  explaining to Brady the insulting chants Birmingham fans are directing at
  their Welsh counterparts. What else did Beckham teach him that night? Brady
  laughs. “A few things that were being said … some of it I couldn’t really
  fully understand because there’s some thick accents that I’m not 100% educated
  on yet, but David’s helped me out.” Another time we see Brady mastering his
  pronunciation of Birmingham en route to the training ground. “I learned that
  pretty early on. When I first did my social media video [announcing my
  involvement], they said: ‘It’s Birmingham, not Birming-ham.’” Wrexham, also
  promoted last season, have become friendly foes. Wagner says other teams “want
  in” on Birmingham’s brewing competition with the Welsh club, owned by the
  Hollywood pair Rob McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds. “Rivalries are very important
  because they allow you to focus at a different level: your concentration,
  effort, it all becomes very maximised when you’re playing against these
  rivals,” Brady says. “The fundamentals of the sport [football], the tactics,
  are different to American football. It’s a different sport but the values are
  very much the same.” After that win over Wrexham, there is a snapshot into the
  bigger picture, a reminder that this is business after Wagner congratulates
  manager, Chris Davies, and his staff. “I’m going to go back upstairs, we’ve
  got 1,000 people we’re trying to get to spend money in the club so that you
  guys can spend more next summer,” says Wagner, a former certified public
  accountant on Wall Street. One of his primary aims is building revenues to
  close the gap to clubs awarded parachute payments. Asked whether the numbers
  are where he expected this summer, Wagner says they have smashed this season’s
  original target. “My team loves it when they achieve a goal and I say: ‘Well,
  now it’s 10% higher’,” he says. Commercial deals with Nike and Delta Air Lines
  help. “We’ve achieved levels of revenue that no one has ever done in the
  Championship, save for clubs receiving parachute payments,” Wagner says. “So,
  if we were to fast-forward a year – if we were fortunate enough to get
  promoted – our first year in the Premier League, I think we’ll fall mid-table
  in total revenues, which is unheard of for a club just entering into the Prem.
  That’s the way we think about the club and that’s what our objectives are
  aimed towards – not just getting to the Prem, but then being there for good,
  and then ultimately becoming competitive.” Birmingham are looking forward but
  the appointment of Wayne Rooney backfired. The first episode touches on
  Rooney’s tenure: two wins in 15 matches and 83 days in charge, a run that
  paved the way to relegation. Wagner says now he “wouldn’t trade that history
  for the world, because the lessons were invaluable”. We see an awkward, small
  talk exchange between Brady and Rooney and, later, with Brady stewing in the
  car after leaving the training ground, comes a telling remark. “I’m a little
  bit worried about our head coach’s work ethic,” Brady says. Rooney was sacked
  in January 2024 and Brady is reluctant to linger on the past: “I have very
  high expectations for myself and certainly for a club and people I associate
  with, and I have a tremendous amount of respect for Wayne. He’s one of the
  greatest players to step on to a football pitch. And that was a couple of
  years ago, at this point Chris is our manager … I love Chris’s work ethic,
  attitude, determination and humility.” On deadline day last summer, Birmingham
  made a splash after signing Jay Stansfield for a record-breaking £15m fee from
  Fulham. Episode three focuses on the England Under-21 striker’s return to
  Exeter City, for whom his late father, Adam, also played. We hear from Taylor,
  one of Stansfield’s younger brothers, who joined Birmingham as kit man during
  Stansfield’s loan at the club, and their mother, Marie. “As a footballer, he
  is just like his dad … he even runs like his dad,” she says. “They both run
  with their pinky finger out,” Taylor says, smiling. Marie is in the stand
  opposite the one renamed after Adam, which Stansfield blows a kiss towards
  after scoring a penalty. Birmingham have been aggressive in the market this
  summer, too, with the returning Demarai Gray and the former Celtic striker
  Kyogo Furuhashi two of eight signings. More new faces are expected to follow.
  So, how does Wagner reflect on his time as chair? “I think the biggest metric
  for us is the increased amount of interest that we have in the club from new
  and existing supporters, where we’re now enjoying record levels of
  season-ticket sales,” he says of the 20,000 signed up this season and
  referencing the 15,000-strong season-ticket waiting list, a first for the
  club. It is apt that Birmingham host Ipswich, the last team to win
  back-to-back promotions to the Premier League, in the Championship
  curtain-raiser a week on Friday. The final episode takes in one of few hiccups
  under Knighthead: defeat in the Vertu Trophy final at Wembley in April. “I
  don’t like losing,” says Wagner. “I’ll back that up,” says Brady. “We sold
  50,000 tickets and when the last ticket sold, there were 23,000 people on the
  phone waiting to purchase tickets,” Wagner adds. “Whatever we’re doing seems
  to be resonating with people, in that they want to be a part of the journey.
  We knew it was a big club with a lot of supporters but I don’t think we
  appreciated how many live and die with us on match day.”
