  conditions

  Germany’s biggest police union has complained about the dilapidated state of
  hundreds of police stations across the country and a fleet of aged vehicles,
  saying conditions are a threat to officers’ health and an insult to their
  dignity. “Decades-old toilet bowls, mould in the offices, vermin, broken
  heating units and holes in the ceiling that let the rain in,” said Hagen
  Husgen of the GdP union, citing just a few of the complaints his organisation
  had received from members. “Some of the conditions our people have to endure
  there are hazardous to their health,” he told the regional daily Münchner
  Merkur. Husgen said police cruisers in Europe’s top economy, which prides
  itself on its automotive prowess, were often so old and beat-up that they were
  “shameful” and “embarrassing” to officers on their patrols. “Vehicles with
  torn seats and half a million kilometres [on the odometer], broken gear
  sticks. When citizens see this, it does not reflect well on the police,” he
  said, blaming the problem in part on privatisation of police car maintenance.
  “It’s a job that’s fun when the conditions are right. But when you take a
  closer look at the circumstances, sometimes I just want to throw my hands up
  in despair.” Husgen said the dismal conditions in many police stations were
  compounding “big problems” recruiting young officers. The trade union supplied
  Merkur with a series of photos showing what it said were ramshackle police
  buildings with gaping holes in the ceiling and a mouse under a desk as well as
  cars with foam spilling out of the seats. The GdP said Germany’s 16 federal
  states needed more support from Berlin to improve conditions for police
  officers and enable them to carry out their duties. The German parliament in
  March approved plans spearheaded by the then chancellor elect, Friedrich Merz,
  to relax the country’s strict debt brake, allowing an increase in defence
  spending and creating a €500bn “special fund” or Sondervermögen for the next
  decade dedicated to infrastructure overhauls, including increased financing
  for the federal police. The GdP has said this spending will be “far from
  sufficient” to address the dramatic shortfalls at the state level and
  indicated a separate Sondervermögen would be required for domestic security.
  “In Germany, we in the police forces have an investment backlog in the
  double-digit billion (euro) range for our property alone,” Husgen said. Asked
  about the GdP’s complaints, a spokesperson for the federal interior ministry
  said police matters including police stations and the vehicle fleet “are
  constitutionally within the jurisdiction of the regional states”. The ministry
  said the federal government assisted regional police forces in a range of
  areas including through special programmes for equipment, digital
  communications and IT infrastructure. The federal government, whose term is
  due to run until 2029, has also promised to increase financing for special
  police forces as part of plans to strengthen the domestic security
  authorities, the spokesperson added. The GdP, founded in 1950, calls itself
  the “world’s largest police trade union”, with more than 200,000 members
  across Germany.
