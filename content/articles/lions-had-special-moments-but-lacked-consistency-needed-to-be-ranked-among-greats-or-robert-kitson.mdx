  How best to describe the 2025 British &amp; Irish Lions tour? Even before the
  final Test was interrupted by lightning, it was a strange old series. To the
  Lions the spoils but it was Australia who led for all but 60 seconds of the
  last two Tests. Just a solitary point divided the teams over three games and
  it was only courtesy of Will Stuart’s late consolation that the visitors
  collected 10 tries compared to the Wallabies’ nine. What would have happened
  had Joe Schmidt’s side had an extra warmup fixture or made a faster start in
  Brisbane? Had Will Skelton been fit for the pivotal opening game, or Rob
  Valetini and Taniela Tupou featured for more than 40 and 60 minutes in the
  series respectively? If Australia had not lost their first-choice fly-half on
  the eve of the series, or protected their 23-5 lead in Melbourne? Not
  forgetting, of course, the hairline margins in the final minute of the second
  Test as the match officials sought to establish whether or not Jac Morgan’s
  clearout on Carlo Tizzano was permissible. As they sip their winners’
  champagne on the long flight home the Lions will be aware their 2-1 series
  victory was way too close for comfort. At which point there are two schools of
  thought. The first is that winning is the only currency worth discussing,
  particularly on this kind of tour. This is only the second victorious Lions
  series since 1997, which makes it a pretty rare achievement. Losing a dead
  rubber at the end of another absurdly long season should not overshadow
  everything that has gone before. The evidence of the past two months, however,
  has been rather less black and white. When you publicly set your stall out to
  smash your hosts by a whopping 3-0 margin it subsequently becomes difficult to
  claim sporting immortality if you scrape over the line against a team recently
  ranked eighth in the world. The Lions have still not won a series in South
  Africa or New Zealand this century. There can also be no glossing over one or
  two other uncomfortable facts. Remember the pre-departure Argentina game in
  Dublin when the Pumas fully deserved their 28-24 victory? Give or take the
  sheeting rain on Saturday night, there were similarities in the way the
  Wallabies expertly seized their opportunities and also looked the more
  energetic side. And how often, as Andy Farrell himself has acknowledged, did
  his squad really click into top gear, even against weakened Super Rugby
  opposition? The honest answer is not often enough given the resources,
  financial and personnel-wise, at their disposal. Aside from the estimable
  Morgan and Tadhg Beirne, how many Lions finished the tour visibly in better
  form than they started it? Part of that could simply be individuals easing off
  slightly with the series already decided. But Farrell and Maro Itoje had
  repeatedly stressed that their players remained highly motivated by the
  possibility of a clean sweep. More pertinent was the excessive amount of rugby
  played by several of these Lions this season and, consequently, the
  accumulated wear and tear. The Wallabies’ sharp improvement also has to be
  taken into account. They are a particular threat with turnover ball in hand,
  never took a backward step and appear to be turning a corner under Schmidt.
  That said, the acid test of their resurrection still awaits. Their next two
  Tests against the world champions, South Africa, in Johannesburg and Cape Town
  this month will be instructive, particularly if they can get all their best
  players on the pitch at the same time. And maybe that caveat also sums up the
  slightly contradictory 2025 Lions? When Itoje, Dan Sheehan, Beirne, Jamison
  Gibson‑Park and the supreme Finn Russell were all out on the field together,
  with Tom Curry and Morgan riding shotgun, they looked a serious team. Beirne
  won the medal for player of the series and Russell picked up the prize awarded
  by the tour sponsor Howden. In the final analysis, however, they perhaps
  needed a couple more world-class performers to elevate the squad to the
  pantheon. While Farrell’s Lions had their special moments they did not
  ultimately show the consistency to demand inclusion among the truly great
  British &amp; Irish squads of yesteryear. What was never in dispute, though,
  was the touring team’s collective bond. Elliot Daly and Tomos Williams may
  have left early with injuries but both still loved the experience. Itoje was a
  respected leader while Farrell Sr’s man management continues to be a strength.
  The only sadness was that, media access-wise, the Lions comms strategy made
  the Kremlin press office look relaxed and open-minded. Such blinkered thinking
  grows even more self-defeating as rugby desperately seeks to market itself
  more effectively. The good news is that this tour should have helped to boost
  the sport’s profile across Australia before the 2027 Rugby World Cup. As the
  tour manager Ieuan Evans rightly put it: “If you weren’t captured by the drama
  of that second Test at the MCG then, quite frankly, you haven’t got a soul.”
  Plenty of good work is also going on behind the scenes at Rugby Australia,
  although Schmidt is still due to depart his post next year. It will be
  fascinating to see how the Wallabies fare when they go to Europe to play
  England, Italy, Ireland and France in November, by which time Farrell will be
  back in an Ireland tracksuit and Itoje will be wearing white again. Being part
  of a winning Lions series, however, remains a privilege and the shared
  dressing room memories will live for ever.
