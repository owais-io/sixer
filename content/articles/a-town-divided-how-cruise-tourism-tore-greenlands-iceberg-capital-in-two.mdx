  It is known as the “iceberg capital of the world” but to the mayor of
  Ilulissat in northern Greenland, it is also a town divided where friends and
  neighbours have stopped talking to each other in a dispute over the cruise
  ships that bring tourists to see its frozen wonders. Its Unesco-listed
  icefjord draws thousands of visitors in the summer months, each potentially
  bringing lucrative business to the town. But frustrated local tour operators
  say they are being shut out by larger companies from elsewhere in Greenland
  and Denmark, who are undercutting local businesses or excluding them entirely
  – while local boats sit unused in the harbour. Ilulissat’s mayor, Lars Erik
  Gabrielsen, has called on residents to protest against the cruise ship
  arrivals with demonstrations and signs – drawing the ire of a minister in the
  territory’s government who has accused him of scaring off tourists. The
  community, he said, is divided between those who have chosen to work with
  Greenland Cruises, a Greenlandic-owned company based in Nuuk, and Danish
  company Vela Nordic, and those who have not. “We don’t even recognise
  ourselves,” said Gabrielsen. “We are not saying hello to each other because we
  are split.” If cruise ships stopped working with these two companies and
  Diskoline, a transport company owned by Topas Explorer Group, a Danish travel
  company, they would be supporting local taxpayers, he said. “It’s very awful.
  We are very sad. And our government cannot even understand us.” Greenland’s
  minister for business, Naaja Nathanielsen, condemned Gabrielsen’s call for
  action with a statement accusing him of “a very unfortunate mix of exercising
  authority and activism”. He was, she said, sending “a clear signal” to
  operators that they “risk being met with demonstrations arranged by the
  authorities”. Several cruise calls to the town had already been cancelled, she
  said, and several others were considering bypassing Ilulissat. A cruise ship
  was last year blocked from entering the port over claims it was only using
  foreign-owned tour providers. The dispute comes at a key time for the
  territory, where traditionally fishing has been the dominant industry but
  tourism is playing an increasingly important role as the Arctic ice melts.
  Tourism is also seen as an important economic component to securing
  independence from Denmark, which ruled Greenland as a colony until 1953 and
  still controls its foreign and security policy. US interest in Greenland is
  meanwhile soaring amid Donald Trump’s threats to acquire the territory,
  centred around both minerals investment and tourism. This summer saw the
  introduction of direct flights from New York to Nuuk, the Greenlandic capital,
  after the opening of a new international airport. An airport is also under
  construction in Ilullisat, due to open next year. Gabrielsen accused
  Nathanielsen of painting him and his allies as “bad people”, but said they
  simply want to ensure local involvement in the cruise industry. “We want to
  also be involved in tourism in the future, so that our children and
  grandchildren can see themselves in this growing industry,” he added. A
  tourism act was last year passed aimed at sustainable development of the
  sector and locally rooted tourism but Gabrielsen disputed it would make any
  difference. He instead proposes that Greenland should have a tourism agency
  run by municipalities and the industry so tasks and customers can be
  distributed more fairly. Tax law also needs changing to tackle the problem, he
  said. The Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators (AECO), which last
  year facilitated multiple meetings in Ilulissat with local stakeholders and
  operators, said it is “aware of the concerns raised in Ilulissat and
  understands that the frustration appears to be directed primarily at companies
  registered in Greenland.” A spokesperson added that the situation “appears to
  reflect local dynamics and differing views on how tourism should be managed.”
  Anne Nivíka Grødem, CEO of Visit Greenland, said: “We view the recent
  developments in Ilulissat with great concern, where local calls for protest
  against certain tourism operators have led to unrest and uncertainty. This not
  only affects our visitors but also disrupts the collaboration between those
  who contribute to creating jobs and income in the town.” Christian Keldsen,
  director of Greenland Business Association, said the dispute centres around
  differing definitions of “local”. “In the word of the law all the companies
  operating here are Greenlandic, although some may have owners that live
  abroad, for example in Denmark.” Diskoline said in a statement: ‘We believe
  there is room for both established and new operators, and that the growing
  number of visitors can support a diverse and vibrant local tourism sector. Our
  goal is to work collaboratively, with mutual respect and openness. “We also
  take pride in being a year-round employer in Greenland. Many of our employees
  are local, and we always prioritize hiring locally before seeking candidates
  from abroad, including Denmark.” Greenland Cruises declined to comment and
  Vela Nordic did not respond to requests.
