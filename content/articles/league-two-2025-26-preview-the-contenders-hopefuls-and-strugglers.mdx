  Promotion hopefuls MK Dons finished 19th last season but Paul Warne is a good
  manager and the club have backed him in the transfer market. Aaron Collins has
  arrived from Bolton for £800,000, a huge fee in the fourth tier, with Will
  Collar also joining from Stockport. Of those that have came down into League
  Two, Bristol Rovers will perhaps be most optimistic of making theirs a short
  stay. Their manager, Darrell Clarke, knows the division well and has sourced
  the knowhow of Macauley Southam-Hales and Josh McEachran to complement the
  talent of Kamil Conteh and the teenager Kofi Shaw. Chesterfield may still be
  reeling from defeat in the playoffs after winning eight of the final 13
  matches of the regular season. On the bright side John Fleck and Will Grigg
  are still around, while the qualities of Armando Dobra and some smart loan
  deals could make a notable difference. Notts County also endured playoff upset
  last season, and then also lost a key source of goals via David McGoldrick’s
  departure to Barnsley. The pressure is on Matthew Dennis to replace him, while
  the acquisition of Sonny Aljofree on loan from Manchester United seems an
  intelligent move. Relegation was inevitable for Cambridge, but Neil Harris
  showed there was light at the end of the tunnel. He has brought greater
  structure to the team, and with the signings of Dominic Ball and Ben Knight
  they appear well equipped to challenge at the top. If last season had ended at
  Christmas, Walsall would now be planning for life in League One, but instead
  their form fell off a cliff and they ultimately lost in the playoff final.
  Learning from mistakes will be key for Mat Sadler’s men. Momentum is all
  important in football and Barnet have it after steamrolling the National
  League. Dean Brennan and his men will not be fearful of anyone in this
  division, either. Playoff hopefuls Re-signing Matty Young from Sunderland is a
  huge boost for Salford, especially after Curtis Tilt departed to Bradford.
  Their co-owner Gary Neville wants the club in the Championship and, while that
  ambition remans some way off, hope is not entirely lost while Karl Robinson
  remains in charge. Gareth Ainsworth’s track record will also provide
  Gillingham fans with optimism of fighting for a promotion spot, especially if
  Bradley Dack can stay fit and Sam Vokes can roll back the years. Crewe are
  partial to a run of terrible form, seen last season as they won only three of
  their final 20 league matches to blow their chances of making the playoffs.
  Lee Bell has clung on to his job and added the veteran striker Louis Moult to
  his ranks with the aim of adding goals, and consistency, to a full campaign.
  It is difficult to know what to expect from Crawley. They went through five
  managers last season before ending up with the one that started in the dugout
  as they dropped down a division. Plenty of players have been sold over the
  summer with a number of unattached ones coming in the other way including
  Kabongo Tshimanga, the 28-year-old earmarked to provide crucial firepower.
  Finishing 11th was an incredible achievement for Bromley in their first season
  in the Football League and replicating that would be equally impressive.
  Grimsby and Colchester just missed out on the playoffs. The former have shown
  their confidence in their manager, David Artell, by handing him a new
  three-year deal, while the latter remain under the charge of Danny Cowley who
  will want his young side to continue their promising evolution. Often it is
  Ian Holloway’s words that are remembered more than his teams but Swindon with
  Billy Bodin back where it all began, the forever chirpy West Country man will
  think they can compete. Relegation candidates Newport’s decision to play
  passing football should be commended but it has proven an unreliable method
  for the players there. They also suffered from set pieces last season and this
  campaign will be a big test for the former Manchester United youth coach David
  Hughes in his first managerial role. Harrogate know how to keep their head
  above water and did all of their transfer business very early this summer to
  give themselves the best chance of staying up. Oldham are back in the Football
  League and have bought in a lot of players who have played at this level
  before in a bid to remain in the division. Shrewsbury endured a calamitous
  2024-25 League One campaign that ultimately ended in relegation. Michael
  Appleton has attempted to rectify previous mistakes by bringing in a new spine
  in the form of Will Boyle, Tom Anderson and Tom Sang and the plan for all
  concerned should be stopping the rot, rather than looking to achieve an
  immediate return to League One. Tranmere have been treading water for some
  time but acquiring the midfielders Richie Smallwood and Jason Lowe should
  provide their manager, Andy Crosby, with the knowhow to keep them up.
  Meanwhile over at the Wham Stadium, the story is a familiar one as Accrington
  desperately work within their means after finishing eight points and two
  places above the drop zone last season. Their only two permanent signings this
  summer have come from non-league and it feels like another difficult campaign
  awaits. Andy Whing has shown promise as a coach but his Barrow squad looks a
  little shallow for anything other than survival. The former Barrow manager
  Pete Wild is now at Fleetwood where he will need to cope with the loss of
  Phoenix Patterson and Brendan Sarpong-Wiredu. Cheltenham do not inspire much
  confidence either and might be at risk after a slow summer. Youngsters to
  watch Matus Holicek, Crewe, 20 Thirty-eight league appearances brought only
  one goal for the young Slovakian midfielder last season. Given his talents,
  that is something he will want to improve on this time around. Kelly N’Mai,
  Salford, 21 The Dutch-born winger moved to England as a child and trialled
  with Manchester City and Manchester United but eventually joining Salford. He
  made his debut in League Two as a 17-year-old and while it has taken time for
  him to flourish he has talent, seen clearly during loan spells at Warrington
  Rylands and Chester. Botan Ameen, Swindon, 18 The Iraq Under-20 international
  failed to make the grade at QPR, leading to him swapping west London for
  Wiltshire in search of a professional career. He quickly settled into his new
  surroundings, scoring twice to send Manchester United out of the FA Youth Cup
  to bring his name to wider attention, and the striker’s progression has not
  halted since. Ameen, who turned 18 in April, scored one goal and created two
  more in 14 games for Ian Holloway’s side last season.
