  On 20 October 2023, Hiba Abu Nada, a Palestinian poet and novelist, was killed
  by an Israeli airstrike on her home in Khan Younis, Gaza. New Republic 1. I
  grant you refuge from hurt and suffering. –Hiba Abu Nada We lived in the
  second century of world wars inside seas I drowned with you and we sank to the
  bottom of the sea of salt where drowning is not possible 2. You were first
  created out of love, so carry nothing but love. –Hiba Abu Nada We carried
  nothing but each other, in the deep sand we built another castle share its
  floors and words braided melancholy tunes into unseen ceilings 3. O! How alone
  we are! –Hiba Abu Nada You and I paint the shadows we brought along give them
  colors hang them on the walls of water to be washed off in the third century.
  In this week’s three-part poem, Michal Rubin mourns, and reimagines in a
  mysterious afterlife, the Palestinian author and activist, Hiba Abu Nada, who
  was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Gaza in 2023. The collection in which
  the poem appears was published in the spring of 2025 by Fomite Press, entitled
  “there are days that I am dead”. That bleak utterance (all words but “I”
  beginning in lower case on the book-jacket) reflects the acute pain of an
  Israeli writer experiencing the tension between her deep attachment to her
  country and its people, and her dismay at that country’s conduct in the war on
  Gaza. In her short preface, Rubin captures the impressionistic spirit of her
  collection as a “jagged painting portraying my inner world since 7 October …”
  Some of these war-framed poems take the form of diary-like day-by-day
  meditations. Others, like New Republic, are engagements with Palestinian poets
  and poems, seeking a vulnerable but navigable bridge between divided
  loyalties. The Poem of the Week floats the possibility of a “New Republic” via
  the tentatively optimistic allegory of two poets meeting together in a dream
  to collaborate on the painting of a kind of magical water-mural. As Rubin
  responds to three poems by Abu Nada (see below for sources and links), her
  emphasis is on finding direct, shareable language and emotion beyond “the
  second century / of world wars inside seas …” But a sea of sorrows must be
  entered by the two women before it becomes redemptive. In poem one of the
  trio, the two poets symbolise their respective countries, meeting to redefine
  their art together in “the sea of salt / where drowning is not possible”.
  Tears are suggested, of course, as is the Dead Sea, a salt lake bordered by
  Jordan to the east and the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Israel to the west.
  Rubin imagines that she and Abu Nada “sank to the bottom”, both having
  differently experienced the trauma of their nations. In the current terms of
  that broken politics, they should have been enemies, but the second poem marks
  their transition, politically free and mutually supportive (“We carried
  nothing / but each other”) to an act of creative, ethical nation-making. Rubin
  finds a powerful myth in Abu Nada’s line, “so carry nothing but love” and
  evokes more than children’s play when she claims that “in the deep sand // we
  built another castle …” The “castle” is a large and magical space for
  searching minds, rather than a sandcastle or fortress. After having “braided
  melancholy tunes / into unseen ceilings”, Rubin declares the women’s still
  transitional accomplishment: “You and I painted the shadows / we brought along
  // gave them colors / hung them on the walls of water …” Individual
  consciousness merges as the two poet-artists find an expression of their
  separate acts of witness. The ultimate vision, though, is that such
  picture-making will one day no longer be needed, “washed off / in the third
  century”. Rubin, whose grandparents were murdered in the Holocaust, lives in
  Columbia, South Carolina. Inspired by an alliance of peace-with-justice
  activists she met in Israel, she founded a group of Palestinian and American
  Jewish poets who regularly share work and ideas. Besides her poetry and peace
  commitments, she is a psychotherapist and cantor. Her most recent collection
  is And the Bones Stay Dry. I am grateful to Somaia Abu Nada for permission to
  publish the quotations from her sister’s poems. She paid loving tribute to her
  in an open letter published in 2024. The quoted poems are translated into
  English by the Lebanese-American literary scholar Huda Fakhreddine. Each poem
  can be read in its entirety as follows: (1) I Grant You Refuge (2) Not Just
  Passing, and (3) Pull Yourself Together.
