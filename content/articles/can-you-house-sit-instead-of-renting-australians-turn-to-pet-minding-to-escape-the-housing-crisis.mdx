  escape the housing crisis

  Jacqueline Mifsud remembers the moment in 2023 when she made what she now
  describes as a “bold life decision” to step out of the rental market in favour
  of house- and pet-sitting. Since then she has become a full-time house- and
  cat-sitter in more than a dozen homes around Melbourne, including several
  return sits. “Basically everything I own fits into my 1997 Toyota Starlet,”
  she says. “I look for long sits – at least two weeks – so I can keep my
  routine and not feel as though I’m starting again every sit.” The freelance
  graphics operator and standup comedian is one of a growing number of people
  relying on house- and pet-sitting as a means to save money in an increasingly
  tough property market – often while saving up for their own home deposits.
  Although house-sitting is often promoted as a way to travel cheaply, the
  leading pet-sitting platform TrustedHousesitters reports an increase in
  domestic pet-sitting in Australia, with data showing 75% of Australian
  house-sits through the platform are being done by sitters within their own
  cities. A spokesperson from the site Aussie House Sitters confirmed that most
  are performed in the sitters’ local area, usually to save money or out of
  housing insecurity. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads,
  pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Mifsud’s
  experiences in the Australian real estate market are common. After bouncing
  between increasingly toxic sharehouses in Melbourne’s inner north for two
  decades, in 2021 she finally landed her own apartment in Preston for $345 a
  week. But, as the Covid slowdown dissipated, the agent informed her of a 30%
  rent increase to $450 a week – way outside her budget. Despite arguing that
  the apartment was in urgent need of repairs and providing a letter from her
  therapist stating that the situation was affecting her mental health, the
  agency wouldn’t budge. She made the decision to move out – to nowhere – and
  try relying on house-sitting to start saving towards her own place. “I’m
  turning 40 and single and don’t want to live in another shared house, and
  figure it’s probably cheaper and better in the long run to buy my own little
  place rather than pay rent,” she says. “I work freelance so it’s hard to save
  when I don’t have a consistent or guaranteed income.” Relying on house-sitting
  gigs while touring her one-woman comedy show The Full Mifsud hasn’t been easy.
  “I never really planned on doing this full-time and it’s a hell of a
  commitment. Having to worry about where I’m going to live next is stressful,
  even though I am extremely lucky that I have family I can stay with and know
  that I will always be safe.” For Francesca Cross and Christopher Thrower, a
  British couple who lived in a flat in south London for a decade, minding
  people’s homes and pets became a way to fulfil their dream of moving to
  Australia. In mid-2023 they moved out of their apartment and started a
  six-month period of house- and pet-sitting while saving for the big move.
  “There are a lot of logistics when you house-sit full-time, such as trying to
  line them up nicely, meeting the owners, going through the pet’s routine … it
  definitely takes a lot of planning and commitment,” they say. By December 2023
  they had saved up enough to make the move to Melbourne, where they had a house
  sit set up on their arrival. “This was really nice to help us settle in and
  find our feet, without paying an extortionate rate for accommodation,” they
  say. “Plus, the doggy, Lexie, was such a sweetheart and helped us with the
  transition to a new country we’d now be calling home.” Leonie van Eyk, a
  film-maker and artist living in a small house on the edge of Castlemaine in
  Victoria with her dog, Scooter, says looking for a pet-sitter is different to
  simply putting your home on Airbnb, because you need to find someone who will
  understand your pet’s peculiarities. “Sharing your house and animals is very
  much a trust exercise,” she says. “You want the pet-sitter to bond with your
  animal and feel at home.” For this reason, Van Eyk prefers to source sitters
  from within her own community. “That helps to build trust, knowing they are
  already connected to my community rather than just randoms,” she says. “Also
  I’m aware that for some people this can give them some welcome breathing
  space. A friend of mine has a child and they can’t secure rent in this town,
  as it’s become so expensive. So our house becomes like a second home to her
  and she loves our dog.” Rose Bishop, who has hosted Mifsud multiple times,
  agrees that she finds it easier to trust a local sitter. “I’ve used an online
  pet-sitting service before but it was exorbitantly expensive and the sitter
  didn’t even stay at my apartment,” she says. When Mifsud isn’t available,
  Bishop will ask “friends who are trying to get out of their sharehouses for a
  while, or who are travelling to Melbourne and need accommodation – and so far
  it’s always been comedians!” “I love my dumb babies so much,” she says of her
  cats. “It’s so important to me that they’re getting love and attention from
  someone in my community.” Cross and Thrower say they have minded their share
  of “characters” including a dog who peed with excitement every time they came
  home (they learned to not show him any love until they were outside) and a
  teenage cat called Kevin who had his own room and simply didn’t like them. “So
  it was less about, ‘We need to talk about Kevin’ and more, ‘We need to leave
  Kevin alone.’” Mifsud says a conscientious attitude is vital. “I’ve heard
  horror stories of bad pet-sitters – someone who killed someone’s fish, another
  who didn’t change the kitty litter for three weeks. “It’s a lot of work and
  admin, and people need to be doing it for the right reasons,” she says. “You
  have to really love animals. “There’s a lot more people out there doing house-
  and pet-sits now owing to the cost-of-living crisis … I just want people
  considering this to take the responsibility seriously.”
