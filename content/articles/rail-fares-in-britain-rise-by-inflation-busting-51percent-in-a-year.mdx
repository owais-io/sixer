  Rail fares across Great Britain have risen by 5.1% in a year, with cheaper
  advance fares increasing by almost double the rate of inflation, the latest
  official data shows. Campaigners said passengers were being priced off the
  railway after the rise in the price of tickets surpassed the government cap on
  regulated fares, which account for about half of rail journeys. The Department
  for Transport capped the increase in regulated fares in England and Wales –
  which include season and anytime urban tickets – at 4.6% in March 2025, while
  Scotrail capped its increases at 3.8% in April 2025. According to figures from
  the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) for the financial year ending in March 2025,
  unregulated long-distance advance fares went up by 5.9% and advance fares on
  trains in south-east England rose by almost 10%. The ORR said overall fares
  across Great Britain increased by 5.1% over the 12 months, compared with an
  inflation rate of 3.2% over the same period, as measured by the retail prices
  index. The consumer prices index, which is no longer the official measure of
  inflation for train tickets, was 2.6% in that period. The government decided
  to set regulated rail fare increases at 1% above the RPI rate in July 2024, a
  rise of 4.6%. The cost of rail travel has in some years risen below the cap,
  with the industry saying cheaper advance fares set by operators offered more
  affordable options. However, those are now rising faster than regulated fares,
  the figures released on Thursday show. Ben Plowden, the chief executive of the
  Campaign for Better Transport, said: “Rising rail fares are putting people off
  using the railways and making rail travel unaffordable. The government must
  make fares and ticketing reforms a priority under Great British Railways to
  help tackle inflation-busting fare rises and make rail travel more affordable
  for more people.” Heidi Alexander, the transport secretary, said: “I
  understand that passengers are frustrated rail fares keep rising despite
  unacceptable levels of delays and cancellations, which is why this government
  made sure this was the lowest increase in three years, and below the growth in
  average earnings. “We inherited a railway that was not fit for purpose, and I
  know it will take time for trust to be restored. My number one priority is
  getting the railways back to a place where people can rely on them, and
  through public ownership and the creation of Great British Railways we’ll be
  putting passengers at the heart of everything we do.”
