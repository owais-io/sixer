  Oral assessments, more security checks and speedier marking are all on the
  cards as generative artificial intelligence (AI) could transform exams for the
  next generation of students. As the 2025 exam season drew to a close with GCSE
  students picking up their results on Thursday, after mostly sitting
  traditional pen and paper exams, AI is already changing the landscape. Exam
  preparation is undergoing a revolution, with students increasingly creating
  personal AI tutors, available around the clock to generate learning materials
  to suit individual needs that potentially lead to better results. “Using AI
  can give a student a much better understanding of a subject because they can
  ask those questions they wouldn’t ask in class, or at odd hours, without being
  judged,” said Dr Andrew Rogoyski of the Surrey Institute for People-Centred
  AI. “It really took off this summer,” said Sandra Leaton Gray, a professor of
  education futures at University College London’s Institute of Education. “So
  they’re able to talk to it about the marking frameworks that are in use and
  upload those, and then they’re able to do sample answers on their own. And
  then they’re able to say to the AI: ‘How would you improve the answer?’ It’s
  like having a tireless tutor.” Others suggest AI is developing so rapidly a
  totally new exam will be needed to test how effectively students are using it.
  Dr Thomas Lancaster, a computer scientist at Imperial College London
  specialising in the educational use of generative AI, academic integrity and
  student cheating, said: “This is becoming such a core digital skill now. I
  think an exam of this type is inevitable.” Lancaster warned AI would lead to
  new ways of cheating. “I do think we’ll need to see increased security checks
  for exams and more training for invigilators to help them to spot disallowed
  devices,” he said. “Communication devices now can be as small as concealed
  earpieces, and there are more dangers with AI-enabled smart glasses.” Sir Ian
  Bauckham, the chief regulator of England’s qualifications watchdog, Ofqual,
  warned of the risks AI posed to the use of extended writing coursework to
  assess a student’s knowledge. In an interview with the Guardian, he raised
  concerns about the extended project qualification, an independent research
  project students can undertake alongside their A-levels that is the equivalent
  of half an A-level. “I think it’s got a really important place that is valued
  and universities sometimes tell us that they value it too,” he said. “So I
  wouldn’t want to take precipitous action on it, but I am worried about the
  extent to which AI may be being used to support students in that
  qualification. “I think anybody that wants to say we should move the exam
  system wholesale away from exams, where you can control the use of AI, to a
  space where it’s much harder to do that, which is extended writing coursework,
  should probably do a reality check.” Rogoyski echoed his concerns. He said:
  “Our assumption that you can tell a student’s mastery of a subject by asking
  them to write an essay is being fundamentally challenged, especially if
  they’re doing that work unsupervised. “We are likely to have to change exams
  to focus on testing their understanding of what has been written, whether by
  AI or human. This means vivas, or discussions, about examined topics.” He also
  warned there are early signs of AI-dependency emerging as students start to
  use the technology routinely: “The risk is that they become dependent on the
  AI and lose their own abilities to analyse, write, and critique subjects,” he
  said. On the possible benefits of AI to the exam system, Jill Duffy, the chair
  of the Joint Council for Qualifications board of directors and the chief
  executive of the OCR awards body, said exam boards were looking at how AI
  could speed up and improve the quality of marking. One theory is GCSE and
  A-level results could be delivered within a month instead of two, thanks to AI
  speeding up marking. OCR is using AI in trials to turn handwritten answers
  into digital text to cut delays caused by poor handwriting. If successful, it
  could mean students are offered university places based on their
  qualifications rather than predicted grades. Duffy agreed more vivas and other
  forms of oral assessment were already being used in higher education. “If
  we’re seeing it there, is that going to start to cross over into schools? We
  could see something like that,” she said. Lancaster added: “Overall, exams are
  here to stay in some form, but that exam form may be rather different to what
  it looks like now.”
