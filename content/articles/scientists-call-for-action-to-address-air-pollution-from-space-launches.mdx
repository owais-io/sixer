  Scientists are calling for a new global regime to address air pollution caused
  by the space industry. Prof Eloise Marais’s team at University College London
  (UCL) began tracking space activities in 2020. Their latest figures reveal 259
  rocket launches in 2024, and 223 launches in 2023. These burned more than
  153,000 tonnes of fuel. Marais said: “More pollutants are being released into
  the atmosphere from rockets and satellites than ever before. We’re in
  uncharted territory, as humans have never added this much pollution to the
  upper layers of the atmosphere. If left unregulated, it may have serious
  impacts on Earth’s atmosphere.” The team found that launches of
  mega-constellation communication satellites, including Starlink, OneWeb and
  Thousand Sails, have led to a threefold increase in emissions of
  climate-altering soot and carbon dioxide. Although the amount of CO2 and soot
  from spacecraft is far less than other industries, researchers have warned
  that particles stay in the upper atmosphere much longer than Earth-bound
  sources. This results in up to 500 times greater climate warming impact than
  the same amount of soot from aviation or ground-level sources. Marais said:
  “The amount of propellant used to launch mega-constellations has surpassed the
  amount of propellant used to launch all other missions combined. The mix of
  pollutants produced is likely going to change in the future with the advent of
  Amazon Kuiper mega-constellations. These plan to use the European Space
  Agency’s rocket that is propelled by solid rocket fuel and produces
  ozone-damaging chlorine compounds.” Dr Connor Barker from UCL said: “Many more
  mega-constellations are planned for launch in the next few decades, which will
  have significant impacts for our climate, and undo progress made by the
  Montreal protocol to repair the ozone layer.” The biggest change has been in
  the sheer number of objects launched and in orbit. In the late 1960s and 2016,
  100 to 200 objects a year were launched into space, but now it is thousands
  each year and they have limited lifetimes. Many of us will have been looking
  up at the night sky as the Perseids meteors reached their peak this month.
  Also obvious is the sheer number of satellites in orbit clearly visible to the
  naked eye as small bright dots slowly making their way from horizon to
  horizon. Prof Stuart Martin, the chair of trustees at the UK National Space
  Centre, said: “Current international law very much related to the principles
  of the high seas. The country that launched an object, owns it, and only the
  laws of that country apply to the object in space. This is one of the reasons
  why things like cleaning up is so difficult.” Already many of these
  mega-constellation satellites are re-entering the atmosphere, vaporising into
  tiny and sometimes chemically reactive metal particles. The UCL team tracked
  2,539 objects burning up on re-entry in 2024 and 2,016 objects in 2023,
  amounting to 13,500 tonnes of material from satellites, as well as discarded
  rocket parts.
