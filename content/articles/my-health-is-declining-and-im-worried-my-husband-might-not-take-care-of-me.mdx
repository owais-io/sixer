  I am 53 and my husband is 60. When our relationship started, he was the
  forgetful one; I tended to remember everything. I have always been mindful
  that I might need to look after him in his old age. But I am a caring person,
  and always thought I would manage. This is not how things have worked out. My
  husband is pretty healthy, while I am suffering the beginnings of a noticeable
  cognitive decline – forgetfulness, overwhelm and a decrease in mobility –
  which I haven’t been to the doctor about yet. My husband is not a very
  outwardly caring person, and I have no idea if he will care enough to look
  after me if I become more immobile or start to forget things more. I want to
  feel loved, but I don’t. This is sad in itself, and really scary for the
  future. I have had some health challenges in the last year and am doing my
  best to look after myself. My husband gives me a lot of advice about my weight
  and health, but he doesn’t walk or talk more slowly if I struggle to keep up.
  Today we went to the cinema as a family. I booked it, paid and drove, but my
  husband and kids walked off to the cinema without me and I couldn’t catch up.
  I want to be together, but I’m left behind. This feels like a metaphor for our
  life. What I really want my husband to say is, “Don’t worry, I’ll take care of
  you, and you take care of me.” But I just don’t think he’s capable of it. Your
  letter was one of the saddest I’ve read. Not because it is without hope –
  quite the opposite – but because this gap between you and your family could be
  bridged with communication. But I know that takes courage. Please go to the
  doctor. A proper checkup could put your mind at rest, or give you concrete
  answers to present to your family. So many women your age, who have had a
  lifetime of looking after others, are exhausted and overwhelmed – not because
  they are failing, but because they are so capable. It’s time to start looking
  after you. UKCP registered psychotherapist Meeri Rebane was “moved by your
  letter and your courage in asking for help. It seems that being the strong
  physically capable ‘carer’ is a role you’ve carried throughout your life. From
  the start of your relationship with your husband, you took on the
  responsibility of thinking about what and who needs taking care of in the
  family.” Rebane went on to say that there’s “nothing wrong with that, people
  can get great fulfilment from caring for others, but who took care of you when
  you were growing up? It seems you were taught to be the ‘caring person who
  would always manage’, but also that to ‘not manage’ was not OK.” We wondered
  if this was why you don’t feel you can ask for help now? I wondered about your
  life when you were a child. You may find the podcast I did on the Parentified
  Child useful. When you’re the planner and the fixer, you and your needs can
  become invisible because you just get on with it. I don’t think your husband
  and children are uncaring – after all, you’ve shown them a lifetime of how to
  do it – but it’s very likely they have no idea at all how you feel. “Your
  husband may not be capable of giving you the response you need at first,” says
  Rebane. “His way of expressing care may be different to yours. It doesn’t mean
  he doesn’t want to take care of you. If you don’t tell him what you need,
  however, he can’t even try to support you.” Asking for things when we’re not
  sure we will get them is scary, but where you are feels scary too. I know it’s
  another thing you have to instigate (if only our families were mind-readers!)
  but seeing the doctor and then being clear and realistic about your needs is a
  really good way to help them help you. • Every week, Annalisa Barbieri
