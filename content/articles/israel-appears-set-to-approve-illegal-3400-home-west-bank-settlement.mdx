  Israel appears set to give formal planning approval to a highly controversial
  and illegal project for more than 3,400 new homes that has been frozen for
  decades and which critics say would split the occupied West Bank in half.
  Strongly opposed by the international community, the so-called E1 plan would
  extend the existing Jewish settlement of Ma’ale Adumim towards Jerusalem,
  further cutting occupied east Jerusalem from the West Bank, and further
  separating the north and south of the territory. The decision from the Supreme
  Planning Council, which meets next week, is expected to support the plan after
  rejecting objections by Israeli NGOs. The expected decision in favour will
  come after Israel’s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich – who backs
  both the plan and the imposition of Israeli sovereignty through the occupied
  West Bank – gloated that he believed construction on E1 would “bury the idea
  of a Palestinian state”. Smotrich is a junior minister who also holds a
  position at Israel’s defence ministry with oversight of planning issues in the
  occupied Palestinian territories. He was placed under sanctions along with
  fellow far-right minister Itamar Ben-Gvir by the UK, Canada, Australia and New
  Zealand in June for “repeated incitements of violence against Palestinian
  communities”. Standing at the site of the planned settlement in Ma’ale Adumim
  on Thursday, Smotrich, a settler himself, said the Israeli prime minister,
  Benjamin Netanyahu, and US president, Donald Trump, had agreed to the revival
  of the E1 development, though there was no immediate confirmation from either.
  While approval for the plan would be a significant step, it remained unclear
  on Thursday how much buy-in Smotrich has from Netanyahu and the Trump
  administration. Netanyahu has not commented on Smotrich’s remarks, while the
  US state department appeared to dodge the issue of E1 when questioned. “Those
  in the world trying to recognise a Palestinian state will get an answer from
  us on the ground,” Smotrich said on Thursday, as he announced the plan’s
  impending approval. “Not through documents, not through decisions or
  declarations, but through facts. Facts of homes, neighbourhoods, roads and
  Jewish families building their lives.” The anticipated decision was
  immediately condemned by the EU. “The EU rejects any territorial change that
  is not part of a political agreement between involved parties. So annexation
  of territory is illegal under international law,” the European Commission
  spokesperson Anitta Hipper said. Germany’s foreign ministry said it “strongly”
  objected to the plan, and called on the Israeli government to “stop settlement
  construction” in the Palestinian territory. The Norwegian foreign minister,
  Espen Barth Eide, said the move by Smotrich, an ultranationalist in the ruling
  rightwing coalition who has long advocated for Israeli sovereignty over the
  West Bank, showed that Israel “seeks to appropriate land owned by Palestinians
  in order to prevent a two-state solution”. While a UN spokesperson called on
  Israel to reverse a decision that would end prospects of a two-state solution,
  the US state department was more evasive. Asked about Smotrich’s statement
  that Netanyahu and Trump had agreed to the development, a spokesperson for the
  US state department said the US remained focused on ending the war in Gaza and
  ensuring Hamas will never govern that territory again. “A stable West Bank
  keeps Israel secure and is in line with this administration’s goal to achieve
  peace in the region,” the spokesperson said, while referring to the Israeli
  government for further information. The fraught question of E1 – and whether
  the land will ever be built on – has become one of Israel’s most interminable
  sagas, embraced by settler politicians but seen by more mainstream politicians
  as a red line over Washington’s previous history of firm opposition. While
  Smotrich, whose increasingly unpopular far-right party would be unlikely to
  win any seats if elections were held today, has spent the past 24 hours
  grandstanding on the issue, any decision to meaningfully advance with actual
  building on E1 would probably have to be made by Netanyahu given the
  diplomatic ramifications. Reflecting the strong international opposition, the
  UK’s Foreign Office said in July – when the issue of E1 re-emerged – that
  construction would be “a flagrant breach of international law” threatening the
  viability of a future Palestinian state. Smotrich’s remarks follow
  declarations in recent days by a growing number of countries of their
  intention to recognise a Palestinian state in the coming months, which Israel
  has condemned. The Israeli NGO Peace Now, which monitors settlement building,
  said: “The Netanyahu government is exploiting every minute to deepen the
  annexation of the West Bank and prevent the possibility of a two-state
  solution. It is clear to everyone today that the only solution to the
  conflict, and the only way to defeat Hamas, is through the establishment of a
  Palestinian state alongside Israel. The government of Israel is condemning us
  to continued bloodshed, instead of working to end it.” First mooted in the
  1990s by the then Israeli prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, the E1 plan has
  barely advanced in the past 20 years amid recognition by successive Israeli
  governments of the depth of international opposition, including in Washington.
  Even with the tacit approval of the Trump administration, movement towards
  building would have severe diplomatic ramifications for an already
  diplomatically isolated Israel, leading to speculation that even with planning
  permission, the plan might not advance.
