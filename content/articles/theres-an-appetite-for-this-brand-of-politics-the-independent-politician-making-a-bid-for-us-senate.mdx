  making a bid for US Senate

  Dan Osborn is a man who does not like to lose, and if you had asked him on
  election night last year whether he would run again as an independent for a US
  Senate seat representing the very Republican state of Nebraska, Osborn would
  have told you to, in his words, “pound sand”. Yet the results of his first bid
  for elected office were alluring, so much so that he has decided take another
  stab at becoming only the third current member of the US Senate who is not in
  either of the two parties. While he did not beat the Republican senator Deb
  Fischer last November, he did narrow her margin of victory to the single
  digits in a state that Donald Trump won by 20 points. Next year, Osborn will
  challenge the state’s other Republican senator, Pete Ricketts, in a contest he
  characterizes as a struggle between the working class and the wealthy. “I
  think there’s an appetite for this brand of politics,” Osborn told the
  Guardian by phone from Omaha. “It’s so important they see the value in having
  somebody like me, who knows what it’s like to put Christmas on a credit card,
  I suppose, versus somebody like Ricketts, who is probably just in it for
  himself.” Osborn’s campaign last year was a rare bright spot for many in an
  election that saw voters pummel candidates who were not on Trump’s team.
  Nebraska has only elected Republicans to the Senate since Democrat Ben
  Nelson’s victory in 2006, but Osborn managed to outperform Kamala Harris by
  more than any other non-Republican Senate candidate. In next year’s elections,
  Osborn may get a boost from the anti-incumbent sentiment that so often
  pervades midterms, but Ricketts, a former governor who is running for a full
  term after winning a special election last year, is one of the best-known
  Republicans in the state. “I do think he’s going to have a much tougher task
  this time around,” Dona-Gene Barton, a political science professor at the
  University of Nebraska–Lincoln who focuses on polling, said of Osborn.
  Compared to Fischer, Ricketts is “much more popular in the state. He has
  incredibly deep pockets, and he’s the sitting incumbent.” Osborn believes he
  has a compelling argument. As a union leader, he organized Nebraska workers
  during a nationwide strike at the cereal giant Kellogg’s, and now balances
  campaigning with his day job as an industrial mechanic. The working class may
  have broken for the real estate mogul Trump last year, but he believes that
  further down the ballot, they will vote for a candidate who is one of them.
  “Our government doesn’t look like me, so that’s certainly what I want to get
  in there and change. And I think that’s what’s on most people’s minds as
  well,” he said. Osborn draws a particular contrast to Ricketts, whose father
  founded stockbroker TD Ameritrade and whose net worth is estimated at $184m by
  the stock tracker Quiver Quantitative. Another potential advantage: he’s not a
  Democrat. Last year, Osborn wrote in the United Auto Workers president, Shawn
  Fain, on the presidential ballot, and said that if he was elected, he would
  not caucus with either party. Independent lawmakers are rare in Congress.
  Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine are the only two in the
  Senate, and both caucus with the Democrats, while the House has not had one
  since 2021. The last time Nebraska elected an independent federal lawmaker was
  in 1936. Voters, Osborn believes, are looking for a candidate who will break
  the two-party logjam in Washington, stand up to the rich and not clash with
  Trump simply on principle. “I’ll work with anybody … the problem, I think,
  inherently, with our government right now, is they don’t seem to want to work
  together,” Osborn said. Though Trump has bashed him on social media
  repeatedly, Osborn said: “I’m not just going to be anti just for the sake of
  being anti.” He criticizes how Joe Biden handled the influx of immigrants
  during his presidency, and repeats Trump’s aphorism that “without a border, we
  don’t have a country”. Yet he does not like everything he sees from the new
  administration, such as the way it celebrates new detention centers for
  deportees, or how Elon Musk pirouetted with a chainsaw at the outset of his
  so-called “department of government efficiency” initiative. “I just don’t
  understand the whole bragging about hurting people,” Osborn said. While his
  relationship with the state Democratic party last year was touchy at times,
  this year, the party has decided to support his campaign, though a Democratic
  candidate could also still jump into the race. Jane Kleeb, the state party
  chair, said in an interview that they view Osborn as an ally for their causes.
  “On the vast majority of issues, like the core issues that matter to working-
  and middle-class families, Dan is on the same side of where I think any of
  those votes would be,” Kleeb said. “Protecting Medicaid, Medicare – he’s not
  going to side with Republicans on that. Middle-class tax cuts, bringing back
  childcare credits, making sure that our American energy is diversified …
  protecting unions, name the issue.” Ricketts’s campaign responded by arguing
  that Osborn was essentially a Democrat. “Fake Dan Osborn can continue
  pretending to be an independent, but he is endorsed by the Nebraska Democratic
  party, funded by Democrats, and backs Democrats’ most extreme policy
  positions,” said spokesperson Will Coup. (Kleeb said the Nebraska Democratic
  party does not endorse candidates, and had not endorsed Osborn.) Now, Osborn’s
  candidacy has prompted the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics to
  change its rating of the race from “Safe Republican” to “Likely Republican”.
  Another prominent forecaster, the Cook Political Report, kept their rating
  unchanged at “Solid Republican”, but noted they may re-evaluate “if Osborn’s
  blue-collar messaging gets some traction”. On the campaign trail last year,
  Osborn said he found himself appearing before crowds at campaign events where
  half of those in attendance were wearing Trump gear, and the other sported
  shirts from the Harris campaign. He sees recapturing that spirit as key to his
  victory. “I would see people with both style shirts, grabbing yard signs
  before they left,” Osborn said. “So I made it not about red versus blue. It’s
  about uplifting everybody in the communities.”
