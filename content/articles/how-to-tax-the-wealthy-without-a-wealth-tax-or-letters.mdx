  Faiza Shaheen is misguided in her advocacy of a wealth tax (Rachel Reeves
  needs to find cash fast. A wealth tax really is her only viable option, 22
  August). There are far more practical policies available to tax wealth as part
  of the progressive narrative. These are based on the idea of taxing the income
  from wealth rather than taxing wealth directly. This is the approach of Prof
  Richard Murphy’s Taxing Wealth Report 2024, which estimated a tax yield of
  £90bn a year from its proposals. The Green party included around £48bn of
  these proposals in its Manifesto 2024. It should adopt the remaining proposals
  too. The Green party has also suggested that all tax subsidies to private
  pensions should be ended. That could be done at once or phased out over the
  life of a parliament, by lowering the maximum limit allowed for tax relief.
  That would yield a further £50bn a year and would also ensure that the value
  of stocks and shares were not inflated by the pension subsidy to the benefit
  of the rich. The upshot would be that £140bn a year could be added to the tax
  yield, disproportionately affecting the rich, from these eminently practical
  measures. This makes far more sense than the will ’o the wisp pursuit of a
  wealth tax. Ian Lovegrove Manchester • Faiza Shaheen proposes a wealth tax,
  but predictably does not give any indication of how one could be delivered.
  She glosses over the fact that it would be overwhelmingly complicated to
  define wealth, and then calculate it for UK citizens – instead, she says, this
  challenge is “not insurmountable” and we should give “more resources for
  HMRC”. I’m sorry, but we need better than that. Faiza also fails to mention
  that while other countries have wealth taxes, they are used to replace other
  taxes – for example, a wealth tax exists in Norway, but it does not have
  inheritance tax; a wealth tax exists in Switzerland, but they have a capital
  gains tax that does not apply to most assets. Faiza also fails to mention that
  many other countries have tried a wealth tax, and have abolished it because it
  did not work. We are in desperate need of real ideas and real solutions, and I
  am afraid Faiza Shaheen provides neither. Michael Watson Edinburgh
