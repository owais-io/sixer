  Moscow has said it must be part of any international talks on Ukraine’s
  security, as Russia continues to stall on Donald Trump’s push for a meeting
  between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Russia’s foreign minister,
  Sergei Lavrov, said on Wednesday that Moscow must be included in any talks on
  Ukraine’s security guarantees, dismissing European diplomacy as “aggressive
  escalation” and a “clumsy effort to sway Trump”. “To discuss security
  guarantees seriously without Russia is a road to nowhere,” Lavrov said during
  a working visit to Jordan. Lavrov also said that China, Russia’s ally in the
  war, should be among Ukraine’s security guarantors – reviving a proposal first
  put forward by Russian negotiators during talks in Turkey in spring 2022.
  European leaders have begun exploring post-conflict security guarantees for
  Ukraine, following Trump’s pledge to help protect the country under any deal
  to end Russia’s war. Russian officials have repeatedly said Moscow would not
  accept the deployment of European forces to Ukraine, one of the key security
  guarantees under discussion. Kyiv is likely to view with scepticism any
  prospect of China, a supporter of Russia during the war, acting as a security
  guarantor. Lavrov, meanwhile, avoided any direct reference to a possible
  Putin-Zelenskyy summit, highlighting the Kremlin’s apparent plans to delay any
  concrete planning of a meeting. Trump announced this week he had “begun the
  arrangements” for the first meeting between the two leaders since the start of
  Russia’s full-scale invasion. Trump later claimed he had set up a bilateral
  meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, explaining: “I thought I’d first let them
  meet.” Opening direct talks with Zelenskyy would cut against the storyline
  Putin has cultivated since the 2022 invasion – portraying Ukraine’s president
  as an illegitimate figure and a mere puppet of the west. Putin, who almost
  never refers to Zelenskyy by name and instead speaks of the “Kyiv regime”, has
  repeatedly cast doubt on whether his Ukrainian counterpart even holds the
  authority to sign a peace agreement. “You can negotiate with anyone, but
  because of his illegitimacy, he [Zelenskyy] has no right to sign anything,”
  Putin told Russian officials earlier this year. But Trump’s promise of a
  meeting puts Putin in a difficult spot: rejecting it risks tension with the US
  president, while agreeing to one would elevate Zelenskyy to equal status and
  confront Putin with a media-savvy rival ready to meet almost without
  preconditions. Moscow has shown scant sign of preparing for such an encounter.
  Lavrov cautioned on Wednesday that any contact between the two leaders would
  need to be arranged “with the utmost care”, while other Russian officials
  dismissed Zelenskyy as a lightweight unworthy of serious attention. But, as
  often is the case, Moscow has avoided closing the door entirely, hinting that
  the Putin–Zelenskyy encounter could take place, while giving no sign that it
  is actually on the horizon. Several countries have offered to host a possible
  Putin-Zelenskyy meeting, including the Vatican, Switzerland and Hungary. The
  Russian leader reportedly suggested to Trump that his counterpart travel to
  Moscow for talks – an idea Russia knew Kyiv would reject because of the
  obvious risks to Zelenskyy’s safety. Analysts suggested that the Russian
  leader would probably only meet Zelenskyy to accept Russia’s maximalist
  conditions, which would equal Ukraine’s capitulation. “Putin will not meet
  Zelenskyy under the current circumstances,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior
  fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. “He has repeatedly stated that
  such a meeting would only be possible if there were well-prepared grounds,
  which in practice means Zelenskyy’s acceptance of Russia’s terms for ending
  the war.” Figures close to the Kremlin have emphasised that Putin sees no need
  to rush into a meeting with Zelenskyy. “Simply put, Putin only sees value in a
  meeting with Zelenskyy if it ends with a capitulation,” wrote the nationalist
  commentator Alexei Mukhin. “If Zelenskyy is unwilling to sign one, the Kremlin
  will keep ‘working on’ the idea of a meeting until he is,” Mukhin added. Putin
  now faces a situation reminiscent of earlier moments when Trump pressed him to
  agree to a ceasefire. At the time, he managed to manoeuvre around the
  pressure, and analysts believe he is likely to take a similar approach now –
  downplaying the prospect of talks without rejecting them outright. The key
  question is whether Trump will seek to put pressure on Kyiv to accept some of
  Russia’s demands to clear the way for a meeting between the two leaders.
  Russia’s leadership on Wednesday showed no sign of compromise. Lavrov said the
  US was beginning to gain a clearer understanding of the “root causes” of the
  war – a phrase Putin has used to describe demands ranging from Ukraine’s
  formal renunciation of Nato membership to its “demilitarisation” and
  “denazification”, a vague formula that in practice would mean removing
  Zelenskyy. The Russian foreign minister also pointed to the April 2022 talks
  in Turkey between Russia and Ukraine as a model. Those failed negotiations
  centred on Moscow’s demands for Ukraine’s disarmament, political neutrality
  and the abandonment of its ambition to join Nato. Meanwhile, Russian officials
  told Reuters that Moscow was preparing to raise taxes and cut spending to
  sustain high defence outlays and keep the war effort going.
