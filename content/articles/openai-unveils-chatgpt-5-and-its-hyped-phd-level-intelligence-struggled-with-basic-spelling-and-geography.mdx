  The cutting edge of AI, dubbed “PhD level” intelligence by its creators,
  thinks there are three Rs in the words “Northern Territory”. That is what
  users discovered after trying out the latest advancement of OpenAI, GPT-5.
  During a GPT-5 launch event on Thursday, the OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, described
  the latest version of ChatGPT as like having “access to a PhD-level expert in
  your pocket”, comparing the previous version to a college student, and the one
  before that a high school student. When users on social media attempted to
  challenge GPT-5, however, they found the model making basic errors in its
  responses. One Bluesky user found the chatbot repeatedly claimed there were
  three Bs in “blueberry”. “Yep – blueberry is one of those words where the
  middle almost trips you up, like it’s saying ‘b-b-better pay attention,’” the
  chatbot said in the posted chat. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “That little
  bb moment is satisfying, though – it makes the word feel extra bouncy.”
  Another user found the chatbot unable to correctly identify the US states
  containing the letter R. And when asked to produce a map, it misspelled states
  including “Krizona” and “Vermoni”. ChatGPT also double listed California and
  invented the states “New Jefst” and “Mitroinia”. When Guardian Australia asked
  the latest model of ChatGPT to identify the number of Rs in Australia’s states
  and territories, it could identify those which did. But the AI also believed
  Northern Territory had just three Rs not five. When asked to produce it on a
  map, spelled the territory as “Northan Territor” OpenAI was contacted for
  comment. The company said on launching the new product that there would be
  fewer errors and AI hallucinations under the latest model. The source of the
  issues may be the way GPT-5 works as a combination of its AI models. GPT-5 has
  a “real-time router” that quickly decides which of its model to use depending
  on the conversation type and intent. OpenAI has said that if you ask ChatGPT
  to “think hard about this” it uses the latest reasoning model. “The router is
  continuously trained on real signals, including when users switch models,
  preference rates for responses, and measured correctness, improving over
  time,” OpenAI’s announcement stated. The chief executive of media and AI
  startup Every, Dan Shipper, found that the model would sometimes hallucinate
  on questions posed to it that should have been routed to the reasoning model.
  “If I take a picture of a passage in a novel and ask it to explain what’s
  happening, GPT-5 will sometimes confidently make things up,” he wrote. “If I
  ask it to ‘think longer,’ it will deliver an accurate answer.” After launching
  GPT-5 on Thursday, the latest ChatGPT model was made available to the
  company’s 700 million weekly users immediately. Altman said the AI had not yet
  reached artificial general intelligence level, but it was “generally
  intelligent” and a “significant step on the path to AGI”.
