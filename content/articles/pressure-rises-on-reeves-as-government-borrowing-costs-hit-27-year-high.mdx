  Britain’s long-term borrowing costs have hit their highest level in 27 years,
  intensifying the pressure on chancellor Rachel Reeves before the autumn
  budget. The yield, or interest rate, on 30-year UK government debt hit 5.680%
  on Tuesday morning. That is its highest level since 1998, indicating that it
  will cost the UK more to borrow from the markets, above the previous 27-year
  high of 5.649% set in April. Yields, which rise when a bond’s price falls, are
  a measure of the interest rate which investors demand when lending to a
  government or company. The UK 30-year bond yield has been rising steadily over
  the last year, amid a wider global sell-off in long-term government bonds.
  Analysts have blamed that sell-off on rising inflationary expectations –
  meaning lenders seek a higher rate of return. While bond prices fell on
  Tuesday, traders piled in to precious metals in a flight to safety. This
  pushed the gold price up to a new record high of $3,508 (£2,607) an ounce on
  Tuesday, while silver rose over $40 an ounce for the first time since 2011.
  Anxiety over fiscal sustainability are another factor, with Donald Trump’s
  recent tax cuts and spending bill expected to add trillions of dollars to the
  US national debt. In the UK, opposition to proposed welfare cuts have
  highlighted the challenge in cutting government spending. Rising borrowing
  costs are a blow to the UK chancellor, as they eat into the limited fiscal
  headroom available to the Treasury. It may force Reeves to consider tax rises,
  or spending cuts, to ensure she still hits her fiscal rule to have debt
  falling in five years’ time. The rise in borrowing costs came as the City
  digested Keir Starmer’s decision to reshuffle his Downing Street organisation
  on Monday, including putting Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the
  Treasury, in charge of day-to-day delivery of the prime minister’s priorities.
  “The immediate market reaction is not exactly a vote of confidence on these
  moves,” said Simon French, the chief economist and head of research at the
  investment bank Panmure Liberum. “Markets [are] seeing it as a signal of more
  gilt issuance/inflation to come,” French said. Rob Morgan, the chief
  investment analyst at Charles Stanley, said: “Bond market trends are adding to
  the pressure on government finances. Escalating global inflation concerns and
  fewer price insensitive buyers such as pension funds have helped pushed up
  yields on UK government bonds, adding to the question marks around the UK’s
  fiscal credibility. “At this sort of level any misstep such as a clumsy
  handling of previously ‘iron clad’” fiscal rules could be severely punished by
  markets, risking a ‘doom loop’ of ever higher borrowing costs, greater
  economic pain, and lower tax revenue. The chancellor needs to keep bond
  markets onside as a matter of priority as waning investor confidence from this
  point could be hugely damaging.”
