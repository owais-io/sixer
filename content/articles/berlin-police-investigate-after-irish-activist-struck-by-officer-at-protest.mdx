  Berlin police have opened an internal investigation after videos emerged
  showing an Irish activist at a pro-Palestinian demonstration being punched in
  the face twice by an officer, drawing protest from Ireland’s foreign office.
  Footage posted on social media showed the activist, Kitty O’Brien, being
  struck by a policeman and dragged away, their face bloodied, from the rally on
  Thursday in the Mitte district of the German capital. Local newspaper Der
  Tagesspiegel said O’Brien’s arm was also broken at the demonstration but this
  could not be independently verified. A longer video published online shows a
  person resembling O’Brien, who uses non-binary pronouns, shouting insults
  including “fucking genocide supporter“ and “you’re acting like a fucking Nazi”
  at police. One of the officers then appears to strike them in the face two
  times. It is unclear from the footage whether the policeman intentionally
  targeted O’Brien’s face. A Berlin police spokesperson confirmed that
  authorities were aware of the incident and said the officer had been
  identified. “We as the Berlin police are reviewing whether the officer acted
  proportionately, and we’re doing it as part of a criminal investigation on
  suspicion of bodily harm on duty,” the spokesperson said. O’Brien was treated
  by the Berlin fire brigade for unspecified injuries, police said. The activist
  is being investigated for insulting and resisting law enforcement officers. It
  was not immediately clear whether O’Brien has filed a complaint against the
  officer. Ireland’s department of foreign affairs said senior officials and its
  ambassador to Germany, Maeve Collins, had conveyed “concern” to German
  authorities about the incident. Zoë Lawlor, the chair of the Ireland Palestine
  Solidarity Campaign, said the video footage obliged the Irish government to
  take action. “They had to take it seriously. It was two very violent assaults
  … It’s shocking. The German police are just horrendous when it comes to
  Palestine activism.” Lawlor said a fundraiser had been launched for O’Brien.
  “I understand they are still in hospital and will be out of work for a period
  of time.” Activists protested outside the German embassy in Dublin on
  Saturday. Catherine Stocker, a councillor with the Social Democrats and an
  aunt of O’Brien, said injuries included a broken arm and nerve damage. “What
  you have here is a bunch of mostly young Irish people standing up for
  international law and standing up for the people of Gaza and Palestine, which
  has effectively been made illegal to do in Berlin at this stage,” she told
  RTÉ. Stocker urged the Irish government to tell the German authorities that
  the police behaviour was “completely outside the bounds of democratic
  practice”. The German foreign ministry declined to comment. A number of
  pro-Palestinian groups including Irish Bloc Berlin, which calls itself a
  “platform for Irish solidarity with Palestine”, had organised the protest
  against Israel over the killing of Palestinian journalists in Gaza. According
  to Berlin police, several hundred officers were dispatched to the commercial
  zone around Hackescher Markt regarding an unauthorised “gathering in the
  context of the Middle East conflict”. About 100 people were marching “back and
  forth” on Rosenthaler Straße in the Mitte district, with some participants
  reported as “verbally aggressive” toward police. “As there was no apparent
  leader of the gathering, the crowd was ordered to disperse,” police said in a
  statement, adding that demonstrators had chanted unspecified “criminal,
  prohibited slogans”. Media reports said “Yallah, yallah intifada” and “From
  the river to the sea” were heard. Last year a Berlin court convicted an
  activist for leading a chant using the latter phrase four days after the Hamas
  attacks on Israel. “During the operation, there were insults, physical attacks
  and acts of resistance against police officers,” the police added. Officers
  temporarily detained 94 people and police initiated 96 criminal investigations
  on suspicion of acts including “using symbols of unconstitutional and
  terrorist organisations, attacks on law enforcement officers, insulting
  behaviour and bodily harm”. Clashes between police and demonstrators at
  pro-Palestinian rallies are a common occurrence in Berlin, where local
  authorities have accused activists of creating an “aggressive atmosphere” and
  accosting police. However participants and observers have repeatedly reported
  what they havecalled excessive and unprovoked attacks by police against
  pro-Palestinian demonstrators in the German capital.
