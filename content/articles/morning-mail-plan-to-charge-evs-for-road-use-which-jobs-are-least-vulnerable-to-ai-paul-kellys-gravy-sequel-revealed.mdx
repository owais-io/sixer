  Morning everyone. Momentum is growing to start charging EV drivers a tax to
  drive their cars, as the federal government seeks a new revenue source to
  replace the fuel excise as EV takeup accelerates. Plus: a study shows the jobs
  least (and most) at risk from AI, Donald Trump warns Russia of “severe
  consequences” if it doesn’t agree to a truce in Ukraine, and Paul Kelly says
  farewell to Joe. Australia ‘Mind blown’ | About 5% of common Australian wild
  birds including kookaburras and lorikeets could have undergone a “sex
  reversal” where their genetic sex does not match their reproductive organs,
  according to a new study. Charging up | Anthony Albanese has signalled that
  the long-delayed reform of road charging for electric vehicle drivers will be
  thrashed out at next week’s productivity roundtable as the surge in the use of
  EVs reduces the revenue from petrol. Bookie bust | A man who “binge gambled”
  $40,000 in an 11-hour session was awarded VIP status by the bookmaker BlueBet
  and assigned a dedicated manager who encouraged him to keep betting. At the
  double | Qantas has cancelled flights at double the rate of Virgin, its main
  competitor, which had the lowest monthly cancellation rates of any major
  domestic airline over the past year. Racing chance | The Victorian government
  could save almost $500m in subsidies if it follows Tasmania in phasing out
  greyhound racing, according to independent analysis. World Wildfire warning |
  The heatwave-fuelled wildfires that have killed two people in Spain and
  destroyed thousands of hectares of land are a “clear warning” of the impact of
  the climate emergency, the country’s environment minister has said. Elsewhere,
  400 people have died from extreme heat in Arizona’s Maricopa county alone this
  summer, while Alaska’s capital city of Juneau is urging many residents to
  evacuate because of the risk of flooding caused by glacial melt. Veteran US
  scientists are planning a response to a government report casting doubt on the
  consensus on the climate crisis. Trump pledge | Donald Trump said there would
  be “severe consequences” if Russia doesn’t agree to end the war after he spoke
  to European leaders before his summit with Vladimir Putin tomorrow. A Pitts
  take | Los Angeles police have formally linked a break-in at Brad Pitt’s home
  in the city in June to a string of other burglaries at properties belonging to
  celebrities including Nicole Kidman and Austin Butler. Caught out | David
  Lammy, the British foreign secretary, has referred himself to the environment
  watchdog after going fishing with JD Vance without the required licence during
  the US vice-president’s trip to the UK. Rap sheet | Lawyers for Drake allege
  that the head of Universal Music was “personally involved” in the notorious
  Kendrick Lamar diss track aimed at the rival rapper and which is now the
  subject of a defamation case. Full Story Al Jazeera’s managing editor on
  Israel’s killing of journalists in Gaza Al Jazeera’s managing editor, Mohamed
  Moawad, talks to Nour Haydar about the death of their correspondent Anas
  al-Sharif and why he refused to leave Gaza. In-depth The march of artificial
  intelligence spells danger for professions such as accounting and research,
  but you’ll be all right if you’re in cleaning, construction or hospitality. At
  least so says a new report by Jobs and Skills Australia whose authors
  nevertheless conclude that no matter “which sector you are in, or at what
  skill level: you will be influenced by AI”. Not the news It began with a
  mysterious death notice published in a newspaper mourning “Joe”. But it soon
  became clear that the “much-loved father” was the protagonist of Paul Kelly’s
  How To Make Gravy and that the veteran singer was promoting Rita Wrote a
  Letter, a kind of coda to his famous song. Jenny Valentish hears more from the
  great man. Sport AFLW | Officials hope a “Goldilocks” combination of
  face-to-face access to players, kick-to-kick after the siren and entertaining
  football within a community setting will spark an upswing in attendances for
  the 10th season of the AFLW starting tonight with Collingwood v Carlton.
  Cricket | The Cricket Australia chief executive, Todd Greenberg, has warned
  some nations will go “bankrupt” if they continue to play the longest format of
  the game, stressing he sees a future with less Test nations. With 100 days to
  go before the Ashes, Scott Boland says Australia won’t be fazed by England’s
  aggressive style. Tennis | Venus Williams will make her return to grand slam
  singles at the US Open after a two-year absence at the age of 45, making her
  the oldest entrant for nearly five decades. Media roundup Flights to and from
  Bali have been identified as the worst for unruly passengers as alcohol and
  drug abuse fuels bad behaviour on planes, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.
