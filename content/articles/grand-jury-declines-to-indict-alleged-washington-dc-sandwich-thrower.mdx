  Grand jurors have rebuffed federal prosecutors by refusing to approve a
  criminal indictment against a man who allegedly threw a sandwich at a law
  enforcement agent in protest against Donald Trump’s deployment of armed troops
  on the streets of Washington DC. It is the second time in recent days that a
  grand jury had declined to vote to indict a person accused of assaulting a
  federal officer and signaled strong public objection to Trump’s decision to
  send national guard troops and federal agents onto the streets of the US
  capital, purportedly to crack down on violent crime. The case of Sean Charles
  Dunn, who was accused of hurling the sub-style sandwich, became a cause
  celebre after video of the episode went viral on social media. Dunn, 37, a
  former justice department paralegal, was initially charged on 13 August after
  being accused of throwing a sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection
  officer who was patrolling an area of Washington’s north-west district known
  for its bars and restaurants with other agents. Footage shows a man, presumed
  to be Dunn, confronting an officer as he stood on the kerbside. He then threw
  a soft object at point-blank range, hitting the agent in the chest, before
  running off with the officer and several of his colleagues in pursuit. The
  complaint against Dunn states that he stood close to the officer and called
  him and his colleagues “fascists” and shouted: “I don’t want you in my city.”
  After the incident, the Trump administration posted footage of a large group
  of heavily armed officers going to Dunn’s apartment, heightening the attention
  the case attracted. Posters depicting Dunn lofting a sandwich have since
  appeared around the nation’s capital. It is rare for federal prosecutors to
  fail to secure charges at a grand jury hearing, given that they control the
  information that jurors hear and defendants’ lawyers are prohibited from being
  in the courtroom. It is unclear if prosecutors will continue to seek to press
  charges against Dunn, which they could do by withdrawing the felony charge and
  refiling it as a misdemeanor, which does not need an indictment. But even that
  would amount to a symbolic climbdown for the Trump administration, which has
  demanded that offenses by prosecuted under the most serious federal charges,
  which carry heavier sentences. Dunn is due to appear before a magistrate judge
  on 4 September in a hearing intended to determine whether a crime was
  committed. The spurning of the indictment against him mirrors the case of
  Sidney Lori Reid, against whom federal prosecutors failed three times in 30
  days to secure an indictment of a felony assault against an FBI officer, after
  she was arrested during an immigration protest last month. Prosecutors on
  Monday reduced the charges to a low-level misdemeanor, suggesting that they
  had inflated the accusations against her. On the same day, a judge dismissed
  all charges against a man who was arrested last week at a Trader Joe’s store
  after police alleged he had two handguns in his bag. Judge Zia M Faruqui said
  prosecutors had violated Torez Riley’s constitutional rights in charging him,
  declaring: “Lawlessness cannot come from the government.” A flurry of
  defendants have been charged with federal crimes over relatively minor
  infractions that would normally be handled by local courts, if they resulted
  in criminal charges at all, since Trump’s highly controversial troop
  deployment. Critics have condemned the deployment as an attempted military
  takeover of a city run by the president’s Democratic opponents and motivated
  by a desire to intimidate rather than to stamp out crime.
