  Whether you’re a skier or a pantry item, everything arrives at Eagles Nest the
  same way: via chairlift. Australia’s highest restaurant sits 1,937 metres
  above sea level in Thredbo, New South Wales, and getting ingredients to this
  Snowy Mountains site is challenging. Skiers require priority chairlift access
  but delicate produce needs timely handling too. “No one likes frozen lettuce,”
  says the food and beverage manager, Ian Campbell. “In good weather, all stock
  goes up the chair during the day and all garbage comes down the chair after
  public hours,” he says. A snowcat vehicle is deployed when conditions call for
  it. Eagles Nest’s pizzeria-style menu pays tribute to Tommy Tomasi, the
  99-year-old Italian migrant who founded Thredbo’s Ski Patrol in 1956. Diners
  often arrive in snow gear, so coffee and hot chocolate are popular. The
  altitude means water boils at 93.7C instead of 100C, so the espresso machine
  extracts coffee at the cooler temperature, a “more gentle” pull that results
  in better coffee, Campbell believes. “Our boiled eggs take 6% longer to cook,”
  he says. Elevation impacts food and drink. Water boils at 70C atop Mount
  Everest, and Charles Darwin learned the ultimate dinner fail in the Andes:
  potatoes, even left boiling overnight, will remain hard and uncooked at high
  altitude. Elevation also affects taste: anyone who has endured airline meals
  knows this. The saltiness of foods can decrease by up to 30% during a flight,
  according to research for Germany’s Lufthansa airline. Sign up for our rundown

  “The lower the altitude you are eating at, the more sensitive you are to
  taste,” says Dr Evangeline Mantzioris, program director of the nutrition and
  food sciences degree at the University of South Australia. She says changes
  start to occur about 1,500m up – enough to affect that margherita slice or
  coffee sip at Eagles Nest, but not enough to affect the menu at Vue de Monde,
  on level 55 of Melbourne’s Rialto. From oysters to wine, all Vue de Monde
  deliveries are sent to the restaurant’s basement, where there’s a prep
  kitchen, walk-in fridges, two cellars and seafood tanks. “It’s a lot of stuff
  coming in,” says the executive chef, Hugh Allen. Everything heads to level 55
  via a lift Vue de Monde shares with the building’s tradies. Has this elevator
  ever broken down? “Many times,” Allen says. Hence plan B: using the diners’
  lift. It’s a tricky workaround that involves maintaining the acclaimed
  restaurant’s veneer of prestige. “We have to do it without guests seeing us
  bringing up bins, produce, things like that,” he says. Vue de Monde could
  trade on cityscape views alone, but the chef says “it’s just a bonus” rather
  than the focus. Vue de Monde’s original site was a Carlton terrace and the
  restaurant was more than a decade old when it moved into its current location
  in 2011, 240m above ground. Allen took over Vue de Monde’s kitchen at 23,
  after working at Copenhagen’s Noma (ranked as the world’s best restaurant five
  times). Allen’s culinary style is conveyed by a sculptural avocado and finger
  lime tart garnished with deeply blue borage flowers, or a clever dish using
  every part of Western Australian marron: shells flavour stock that’s baked
  into custard, sauce made from crayfish trimmings, with a marron tail playfully
  plated on top. “It’s pretty simple, but super tasty,” Allen says. Compare this
  to the Summit in Sydney, the world’s biggest revolving restaurant upon opening
  in 1968. On its 47th-floor location, prawn cocktails were popular and the
  owner, Oliver Shaul, famously said: “I could buy a new Mercedes every year on
  the profits from garlic bread alone.” The Summit still spins today, now known
  as O Bar and Dining. Just blocks away, there’s Sydney Tower – still considered
  Centrepoint by locals, despite multiple name changes. Infinity by Mark Best
  opened in mid-August on its 81st floor. You won’t find garlic bread here but
  there’s rye and caraway sourdough that takes three days to make. Best says the
  bread reflects his “Germanic Barossa Valley background”. In-house butter
  requires eight days and cream from The Little Big Dairy Co in Dubbo.
  Meticulously using all-Australian produce is how the chef hopes to overcome
  “the higher you are, the worse the food” stigma tall restaurants share.
  Culinary pedigree gives Infinity a head-start. It’s Best’s first Sydney
  venture since closing Marque in 2016: during its 17-year run, he achieved
  World’s 50 Best Restaurants recognition and the ultimate endorsement from
  Melbourne-based chef Ben Shewry, who was hit by a bus on his way to Marque,
  yet turned up for his booking, bloody but early. Best remembers the episode
  well, down to where Shewry sat. Before this gig, Best had never been up Sydney
  Tower – despite living in the city for almost 40 years. “I hate gimmicky
  things,” he says. His wife, Valerie, had to urge him up Paris’s Eiffel Tower.
  Infinity updates some Marque classics: there’s Sauternes-style custard with
  Mount Horrocks Cordon Cut riesling, and oysters with edible shells and
  “grilled sea foam”. Other dishes are Sydney tributes: dosa with
  sweetbread-style lion’s mane mushrooms are a hat-tip to Indian breakfasts on
  Cleveland Street. The restaurant’s sommelier, Polly Mackarel, leans into the
  lofty location with high-altitude wines on her all-Australian list. She says
  you know a wine region is special when you “immediately feel a change in
  atmosphere” there. The wine selection, like the playlist, celebrates female
  talent. Has Infinity’s lofty position worked against them yet – say, missing
  out on talented yet acrophobic staff when recruiting the new team? “They just
  don’t apply, so it’s self-filtering,” Best says. And the lifts? “If two break
  down, we’re fine. If three break down, we’re also fine,” he says. “We’ve got
  food up here for days.” • Lee Tran Lam is the host of the Culinary Archive and
  Should You Really Eat That? podcasts • This article was amended on 31 August
  2025. A previous version incorrectly said Paris’s La Tour d’Argent restaurant
  was in the Eiffel Tower.
