  Oregon firefighters are working to save one of the tallest non-redwood trees
  in the world after it caught fire last week. The coastal Douglas fir, believed
  to be about 450 years old and which stands 325 ft tall, was still burning east
  of Coquille on Tuesday, according to Megan Harper, public affairs specialist
  at the Bureau of Land Management. The Coos Forest Protective Association, a
  non-profit that provides wildland fire protection for several counties in
  Oregon, had received a call about the fire on Saturday. Harper said there’s
  still a spot about 280 ft up the tree that’s “still hot and it’s still showing
  some smoke”. “That’s the area of focus right now to see if we can get that
  that spot cooled down because of the thick bark,” she said. The blaze was
  burning from the top of the tree down into its trunk on Monday, according to
  an update from the non-profit, and helicopter crews managed to douse flames in
  the canopy. On Tuesday, crews remained on “observation mode” to see if the
  helicopter work was successful or not. “They are holding off on any more
  helicopter drops today, just to see what the fire does,” Harper said. “There
  are helicopters available to respond if they do start to see more fire
  developing.” Fire officials will not send climbing crews into the Doerner fir,
  according to the non-profit’s update on Facebook, amid safety concerns.
  “Fallout from the treetop makes it unsafe for crews to engage directly under
  the tree, so firefighters are working to identify additional ways to reach and
  extinguish the fire,” reads the statement from Monday. Firefighters have set
  up a containment line and sprinklers to prevent the flames from spreading near
  the ground. The cause of the fire remains under investigation, and
  investigators with the Bureau of Land Management are on scene. “Visitors
  should be aware that the area will be closed to public use at this time due to
  active fire and firefighting efforts,” the Coos Forest Protective Association
  said. Harper said the tree’s height makes it the first target for lightning
  strikes or anything falling from the sky. She said the tree also has a lot of
  dried moss and bark built up over the summer amid the heat and lack of rain.
  “That material is all flammable,” Harper said. “It’s an older tree, it has a
  lot of pitch that’s coming out of it, that sticky, sugary substance that has
  the potential to be pretty flammable.”
