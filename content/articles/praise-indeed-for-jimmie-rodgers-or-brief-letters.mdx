  “Country music has a loyal fan base in Kenya and its popularity is continuing
  to grow,” says the subheading on your photo gallery (Kenya celebrates
  International Cowboy Day – in pictures, 27 July). This is nothing new. In 1950
  the ethnomusicologist Hugh Tracey recorded young girls of the Kipsigi people
  in Kenya singing Chemirocha, a song in praise of the 1930s “father of country
  music” Jimmie Rodgers, who they believed from his recordings to be “a faun,
  half-man and half-antelope”. Ian A Anderson Cambridge • Women performing on a
  football field are called Lionesses and not Lions (Letters, 29 July) because
  lionesses do all the work. They give birth and do the hunting while the lions
  just lie about. Enough said. Joy Grice Matlock, Derbyshire • “There is a
  predictability about railways, timetables…” says the Rev David Gibson
  (Letters, 28 July). Truly a man of faith. Pete Bibby Sheffield • Our local
  tip, Folkestone, has put dozens of teddies and soft animals all round it, in
  the trees, in the kiosk, along the railings. It’s an absolute joy to visit
  (Letters, 25 July). Mandy Jones Hythe, Kent • MPs earn £93,904, up from
  £63,291 in 2008. How did they achieve a 48% rise without going on strike like
  resident doctors? Dr John Doherty Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire • Keir
  Starmer’s position on Gaza is akin to watching a burning building and
  promising not to call the fire brigade next week if the arsonist puts the
  matches down by then. Dave Hepworth Rowland, Derbyshire • Have an opinion on
  anything you’ve read in the Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it
  will be considered for publication in our letters section.
