  A forlorn disco ball counting down the time remaining hangs at the entrance of
  the beloved Berlin club Wilde Renate, known only as Renate, which is rapidly
  heading into its final nights of wild abandon. Unlike its more hyped cousin
  Berghain and posher late sister Watergate, Renate has long stood for a certain
  more relaxed type of Berlin-brand partying – more poor than sexy to borrow the
  capital’s lamented motto. The club, a ramshackle garden leading to a maze-like
  block of derelict flats playing EDM, house and techno handpicked by live DJs
  on each floor, has welcomed visitors from across the city and around the world
  for 18 years. Instead of dress codes and picky or menacing bouncers, there
  were “welcoming” bartenders and a vibe like a “giant house party”, said guests
  on a recent Friday night. There were even rumours of a resident cat. “I’ve
  always loved this old building with all its levels,” said Philipp Wittwer, a
  34-year-old engineer out with friends. “It’s like a haunted house – there are
  so many rooms I’ve never seen, even after coming for years.” But in late
  December the bash will be over. And for several other clubs making up the
  city’s unique nightlife, the writing is on the wall. Many cities including
  London, Paris and New York have experienced a rash of late-night venue
  closures, creating depressing “night-time deserts” where there once was a
  vibrant scene. But for a European capital that like no other built its
  reputation on fun and decadence, the pain is especially palpable in Berlin.
  Before the pandemic, the industry contributed, directly and indirectly, about
  €1.5bn (£1.3bn) to the chronically cash-strapped economy each year. According
  to the left-leaning daily Tageszeitung, Clubsterben (the death of clubs) will
  fuel “the march of commercialisation” in Berlin. It said: “When they only open
  for snot-nosed brats, solvent tourists or company events, you’ll hardly be
  able to speak of ‘Berlin club culture’.” Nightlife veterans at Renate also saw
  the ground shifting beneath their feet. Berliner Rouven Kelling, 30, said: “If
  the alternative places all die out then all you’ll have are the mainstream
  clubs where you hear the same music everywhere and only drink Aperol Spritzes.
  Then we’ll get the kind of tourists we don’t want – it’ll be all Instagram
  models and TikTok people.” As low-tempo techno with French pop samples drifted
  from the speakers, Rodrigo Lobos, 29, a warehouse manager from Sweden, said
  the “chill atmosphere” had lured him and his girlfriend, Emily Solis, 25, into
  Renate. “In Stockholm the clubs close at 3am but here you can go non-stop,” he
  said, sipping a beer he said would cost him twice as much back home. Solis, a
  receptionist, said she’d see little point in making the trip if Berlin’s
  fabled clubs vanished: “I’m here for the party.” The reasons for Renate’s
  looming demise are multifaceted. The owner of the site, a major local property
  developer, reportedly wants to build on the site of Renate’s cherished garden.
  Unlike Berghain, the techno temple and hedonist attraction that helped put the
  city on the global party map in the 2000s, Renate does not own its own
  premises and its lease will run out at the end of the year. The club did not
  respond to requests for comment. Popular spots Mensch Meier and Re:mise both
  closed in 2023, while institutions such as About Blank, Club Ost, OXI, VOID
  and Else have all appeared on the endangered list due in part to the planned
  expansion of an autobahn. Laura Gülcker, 34, a product developer, said she
  came from a rural western German town once a year for clubbing. She said that
  compared with “more corporate” discos with bottle service in cities like
  Düsseldorf, Berlin had spots that were “really relaxed, diverse – beautiful”.
  Gülcker likened Renate’s garden to an “enchanted forest” with its mature trees
  and rickety gazebos festooned with antique chandeliers. Her friend Verena
  Tekaat, a 31-year-old working in the textile industry, said for two women
  heading into the night together, it was a big plus that Berlin’s nightclubs
  were not marooned in remote districts. Emiko Gejic, spokesperson for the
  Clubcommission Berlin, representing the sector’s interests, said rising rents,
  soaring energy costs and the pressures of gentrification on the once-cheap and
  abundant real estate market have put the pinch on the nightclub scene, which
  traces its freewheeling origins to the Weimar republic a century ago.
  Germany’s “oldest and biggest” gay disco, SchwuZ, this month declared itself
  bankrupt after nearly half a century in business, falling victim to inflation,
  management troubles and the existence of dating apps, among other factors.
  Gejic said noise complaints had also driven many popular spots out of the city
  centre, as has the financial squeeze on people of peak clubbing age due to
  surging rents. The drop in alcohol consumption among younger people has also
  sapped clubs of crucial income, leading many to hike prices at the door. Party
  nights now routinely cost €20 and upwards. Low-cost airlines once delivered
  party people from across Europe to Berlin for a weekend bacchanalia, with many
  visitors forgoing a hotel in favour of a two-night dance marathon before
  collapsing into sleep on the return flight. However, high taxes and airport
  fees at the little-loved new international hub BER have pushed budget carriers
  out of Berlin. Today, a common fixture of the local party scene is a cluster
  of revellers gathered on benches outside a Späti (late-night convenience shop)
  with canned drinks and a playlist blasting from a mobile phone. Gejic insisted
  all was not lost, noting the pioneer spirit that gave rise to clubs in
  abandoned industrial spaces after the Berlin Wall fell could be found in
  “young, community-based collectives” organising parties in unexpected places
  around town. “I’m rather hopeful when I look at the scene creating new
  formats, getting involved, showing great solidarity and being politically
  active,” she said. “That’s the scene that I think will also break new ground
  in future.”
