  ‘This vertical city is so dense, the only way to build is up’: Victor Cheng’s
  best phone picture

  Victor Cheng describes his adopted city as “organised chaos”. The
  photographer, originally from Toronto but now based in Hong Kong, says that
  while many people have a stereotypical view of the city, based on classic kung
  fu movies or Rush Hour, it’s “actually quite modern, and full of skyscrapers.
  It’s also fast-paced; even at times when you have nowhere to be, you get
  caught up in the busy streets and start to feel you have to move faster!”
  Despite that, Cheng says he sees the city as a “photographer’s paradise. There
  are so many photogenic spots and scenes.” The Yick Cheong building seen here,
  known colloquially as Monster Building or Monster Mansion, is usually teeming
  with locals and tourists. When Cheng took this shot, however, the Covid
  lockdown was in force. “I think it gained its nickname after it was in a
  Transformers movie,” he says. “It’s a residential building, but downstairs
  there are shops, cafes and wet markets. Because of the pandemic, it felt like
  I had the place to myself. I set a timer, put the phone down and used the
  wide-angle lens to get the shot.” Cheng later applied minor adjustments using
  the Lightroom app. “I hope that people would be amazed at how dense this
  vertical city is,” Cheng says. “Space is so limited that the only way to build
  is up.”
