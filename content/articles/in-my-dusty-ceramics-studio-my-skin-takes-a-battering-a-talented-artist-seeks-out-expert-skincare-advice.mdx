  “I’m a contemporary visual artist and I work primarily with clay. I make
  sculptural pieces, but I also draw, make collages, and I work with sound as
  well. Most of the time I’m in my studio making, but I also work with galleries
  or arts organisations delivering workshops with community groups or setting up
  exhibitions. My studio’s only 10 minutes’ walk from my house. I live in the
  Calder Valley, in West Yorkshire, which is beautiful – full of moors and hills
  – so I always take the long way round. My day often starts with reclaiming
  clay that needs recycling. I’ll rehydrate it, lay it out on plaster and then
  get it ready to use again. Working with clay is hands-on. It’s quite a
  physical job. The materials are really heavy. The way I work, making quite big
  pieces, takes a lot of energy. My hands are always on the go, whether it’s
  shaping wet or leather-hard clay, working with glazes (I mix them myself which
  means dealing with different chemicals and minerals), or firing in the kiln.
  Clay is very drying and my hands really take a battering. But they’re artist’s
  hands and I’m very proud of them. As for my face, I have quite a simple
  skincare routine. I just use a face wash, toner and moisturiser, then a serum
  on top and sunscreen. But I will wash my face during the day if it feels a bit
  too dusty – it can get very dusty in the studio – or if I’ve wiped clay or
  glaze on my skin by mistake.” Dr Ifeoma Ejikeme Dr Ejikeme says: “Aliyah’s
  frequent exposure to studio dust and clay leads to microscopic particulates
  accumulating on the skin surface. This mechanical and oxidative stress can
  weaken the skin barrier over time. Her frequent cleansing may strip natural
  oils, increasing dryness or irritation. To help restore and protect her skin,
  apply the new Modern Chemistry by Boots Restore Hydrating Serum with
  niacinamide and ashwagandha after each cleanse. Niacinamide helps support the
  skin barrier, while ashwagandha helps to soothe. To keep her routine gentle
  yet effective, I also recommend using Modern Chemistry by Boots Restore
  Essence Toner with niacinamide and ginseng after cleansing, to calm and
  hydrate before putting on serum and moisturiser.” “I have a good skincare
  routine, but it’s not complicated. With all those other things you’re supposed
  to use, I’m a bit clueless. I’d like to know what to do but I don’t
  necessarily want to spend a lot of money trying different things. Or I don’t
  want to upset my skin – I feel that sometimes when you change products too
  much it can upset it. My skin is pretty good to me – I don’t get spots or
  anything like that. I do have pigmentation even though I wear sunscreen but I
  feel like that’s probably unavoidable from being outside so much.” Dr Ejikeme
  says: “Aliyah is cautious about introducing new products, which is
  understandable. When the barrier is intact and skin is behaving well, it’s
  wise to take a minimal approach. However, she can still enhance her routine
  with simple, effective formulas. Modern Chemistry by Boots Glow Brightening
  Moisturiser with vitamin C and niacinamide can be helpful; it delivers
  hydration and brightens skin. It’s a straightforward upgrade with vitamin C
  that supports tone, radiance and barrier health without overwhelming the
  skin.” ‘I’m very lucky that I get to work as an artist all of the time’ “The
  nature aspect of where I live hugely inspires my work. A lot of the ceramic
  sculptures I make are based on plants and vines and different sides of nature,
  including herbalism and the folklore associated with plants. I also volunteer
  at a local community apothecary garden. That outside connection and being in
  nature is massively important because my work is about going back to the
  studio and translating all of that into ceramics. I wouldn’t change it but
  that mix – of being in a dusty, dry studio, having hands in the soil or
  walking in the hills – is pretty tough on my skin.” Dr Ejikeme says: “Outdoor
  exposure to wind, rain and UV can accelerate skin dryness. Skin fatigue and
  lipid loss are common in such environments. Aliyah should prioritise barrier
  support. Using Modern Chemistry by Boots Glow Exfoliating AHA/BHA Toner one to
  two times a week at night will help gently smooth the skin and prevent
  congestion caused by environmental exposure. Follow with Modern Chemistry by
  Boots Restore Moisturiser with rice extract and niacinamide to lock in
  hydration and support the barrier. For daily hydration and to prep the skin in
  the morning, use Modern Chemistry by Boots Restore Essence Toner with
  niacinamide and ginseng under moisturiser.” ‘Most of the time I’m in my studio
  making’ “At the end of a studio day there’s a lot of cleaning to be done —
  mopping, wiping down, making sure there’s no dust, and wrapping everything up
  so it doesn’t dry out. My studio’s in an old mill and, as is typical with many
  artist studios, they’re baking hot in the summer and freezing cold in the
  winter. No in between. I’m very lucky that I get to work as an artist all of
  the time. It’s a real privilege. I work with materials that I find endlessly
  fascinating and share my space with other artists who are constantly
  inspiring. Through workshops, I get to share my craft knowledge and skills
  with other people, which is really fulfilling. Some of them would never
  describe themselves as creative or as an artist, so it’s a real joy to
  encourage them to work with clay. As artists, we get to share a lot and that’s
  really lovely.” Aliyah’s Modern Chemistry formula Dr Ejikeme’s summary:
  “Aliyah’s lucky that her skin is coping well with the effects of being in a
  dry work environment combined with exposure to the elements. With just a few
  tweaks, and incorporating Modern Chemistry by Boots Glow Brightening
  Moisturiser with vitamin C and niacinamide, her skin can get antioxidant
  support. This helps boost the skin for a radiant complexion.” AM routine
