  Dozens of Pro-Palestine protesters gathered at US senator Chuck Schumer’s New
  York City office on Friday, leading to mass arrests as elected officials
  joined activists from Jewish Voice for Peace outside the Midtown office.
  Tiffany Caban, a New York City council member, and Claire Valdez, a state
  representative, were among those arrested. Demonstrators were seen banging
  together pots and pans, a form of noise protest. The protest at Schumer’s
  office was one of several such demonstrations that took place in major US
  cities Friday. “We are calling on them to let aid in, to stop the bombing and
  allow aid into the Palestinian people of Gaza right now,” Jay Saper, a Jewish
  Voice for Peace spokesperson, told the New York Post. “This starvation crisis
  in Gaza is at a tipping point, and so we have to raise our voices.” Elsewhere
  in New York City, there was a demonstration outside the Egyptian Consulate
  aimed at highlighting Egypt’s role in Gaza’s border policy. At least five
  people were reportedly detained after activists chained themselves to New York
  City’s Egyptian Mission to the United Nations. According to a post by
  Palestinian Assembly for Liberation, who organized the demonstration, the
  protest’s goal was to “demand the government of Egypt cease its collaboration”
  with Israel – which it accused of being a “genocidal Zionist regime” and “put
  an end to the manufactured famine of Palestinians in Gaza”. In Los Angeles,
  activists were holding another pots and pans protest. “Families face famine
  and children are dying of malnutrition,” the group Koreatown for Palestine
  wrote on social media. “We will make the people of Koreatown hear the sound of
  starvation in Gaza.” Several other protests were planned for Friday evening in
  major US cities, including Arlington, Texas; Newark, New Jersey; Houston,
  Texas; Boise, Idaho; Portland, Oregon; West Hartford, Connecticut; Baltimore,
  Maryland, and San Jose, California. On Thursday, protesters targeted the New
  York Times headquarters in Manhattan, writing the words “NYT lies, Gaza dies”
  in bold white lettering on the side of the building. There was also red paint
  smeared over the Times logo. Some in US cities have continually held organized
  protests voicing support for a ceasefire in Gaza nearly two years into the
  military campaign that Israel launched there in response to Hamas’s 7 October
  2023 attack. Some cities have hosted weekly Palestine vigils since late 2023.
  In some locations, organizers are also using these gatherings to provide legal
  support for protesters facing arrest or disciplinary actions on campuses. The
  campus-based movement in support of Gaza, once centered around encampments in
  spring 2024, has led to a year-long legal back-and-forth between Donald
  Trump’s administration and several institutions, which began with the
  president accusing the schools of allowing antisemitism to go unchecked on
  campuses amid protests of Israel’s military strikes in Gaza. At Columbia
  University, school officials have disciplined more than 80 students for their
  involvement in protests, including expulsions, suspensions and revoked
  degrees. Columbia recently announced a deal with the Trump administration to
  pay more than $220m to release funding, which Trump froze because of what he
  described as the university’s failure to squelch antisemitism. In protest of
  the university’s compliance with the Trump administration, historian Rashid
  Khalidi has canceled his fall 2025 lecture course, saying in a letter
  published by the Guardian that the deal “constitutes the antithesis of
  academic freedom”.
