  A 14-year-old girl was left feeling sick to her stomach after a man tried to
  kiss her and her friend, telling them he wanted to have a baby with each of
  them, a court has heard. Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, an asylum seeker being
  housed in the hotel in Epping that has been at the centre of repeated
  far-right protests since his arrest, is accused of sexual assault and
  harassment against the two 14-year-olds and another woman. “It’s the crown’s
  case he said he wanted to have a baby with each of [the 14-year-olds] and
  attempted to kiss them,” the prosecutor, Stuart Cowen, told Chelmsford
  magistrates court on Tuesday, adding that the incident happened after one of
  the girls offered Kebatu pizza because he looked hungry. “He invited them back
  to the Bell hotel, where he was a resident, having recently arrived in the UK.
  These advances were rejected and it was made clear to him [that the girl] and
  her friends were 14 years of age.” Addressing the alleged sexual assault on
  the third person, Cowen said: “She came and sat next to the defendant when the
  group got up, and she engaged in conversation and offered to help him with his
  CV. She then alleged he sexually assaulted her by putting his hand on her leg
  and tried to kiss her.” Cowen said Kebatu’s “advances” towards the
  14-year-olds were rejected. He said the case against Kebatu, who had recently
  arrived in the UK, has “attracted quite a lot of publicity because of the
  defendant’s personal circumstances”. The allegations against him sparked
  protests and counter-protests outside the Bell hotel. The defendant is alleged
  to have approached the two friends on 7 July, before putting his hand on one
  of the girl’s thighs and attempting to kiss her again the following day. The
  girl told police she “froze” and told him: “No, I’m 14.” She said Kebatu
  responded: “No, no, it doesn’t matter, you could come back to the Bell hotel
  with me.” Speaking about what happened when she offered Kebatu pizza, the girl
  told police: “He’s hovering, he’s come over, he looked hungry, so we was like,
  ‘Do you want a slice?’ He sat down eating a slice. Out of nowhere he said: ‘I
  want one baby from you and one baby from your friend.’ I put my boy mate
  between us.” One of the 14-year-olds told the court she felt “really sick to
  my stomach” after the alleged sexual assault. In a police interview played
  during the hearing, she said: “I wouldn’t think a full-grown man would think
  it was OK to do that. I felt really intimidated.” Kebatu, of the Bell hotel,
  spoke through an interpreter to give his date of birth as December 1986,
  making him 38 years old. He denies two counts of sexual assault, one count of
  attempted sexual assault, one count of inciting a girl to engage in sexual
  activity, and one count of harassment without violence. The trial, which is
  expected to last two days, continues.
