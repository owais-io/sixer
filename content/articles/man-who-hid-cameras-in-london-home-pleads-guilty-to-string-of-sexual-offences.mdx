  A businessman who concealed cameras in his home and drugged women has pleaded
  guilty to a string of sexual offences, and police fear the full scale of his
  crimes may be “vast”. Chao Xu, 33, pleaded guilty at a pre-trial hearing on
  Friday to 24 offences against six young women in London over three years,
  including rape, digital penetration, sexual assault, administering a substance
  with intent and voyeurism. He was arrested in June and hidden cameras were
  found in multiple areas of his home, including inside an air freshener and in
  bathrooms. Police said searches of his phone found hundreds of intimate images
  and videos of women. His filming of his own offending was the key evidence
  that led to his guilty pleas. Detectives have been able to identify three
  victims, with three others he was convicted of attacking still unidentified.
  Police believe his offending could go back years and that there could be many
  more victims. All of his victims are believed to be of Chinese heritage. Xu
  owned a recruitment company and would use networking events at his home in
  Greenwich, south London, to select women to drug and then attack. After one
  event in June, a woman who had been raped four times went to police. Police
  believe Xu would spike drinks and then when women felt unwell he would offer
  them a place to stay. Drugs recovered by police included substances usually
  used by vets to treat animals. Women said they had the effect of making them
  drowsy and incapacitated, during which time he attacked them. The offences Xu
  admitted at Woolwich crown court were four counts of rape, eight counts of
  assault by penetration, four counts of sexual assault, four counts of
  voyeurism, two counts of administering a substance with intent, and two counts
  of operating equipment beneath the clothing of another without consent between
  February 2022 and June 2025. Two other alleged offences will lie on file. The
  details of his offending have strong similarities to that of Zhenhao Zou, a
  Chinese student and serial rapist who drugged many of his victims and who is
  now serving a life sentence with a minimum term of 24 years. Police are
  investigating whether there is any link between the two but so far none has
  been found. Detectives are also talking to counterparts in China about whether
  they have any information on Xu, who came to Britain in 2013 to study at the
  University of Greenwich. Police want any women who fear they may have been
  victims of Xu to contact them. The lead investigator, Det Ch Insp Lewis
  Sanderson, said: “Xu is a calculated prolific sex offender who has preyed on
  unsuspecting women using cowardly methods – administering drugs to rape,
  sexually assault and take intimate images without consent. “Our investigation
  is ongoing and we continue to examine the large amount of evidence we have
  collected, which will help identify any further potential victim-survivors.
  We’re also asking anyone who has any information about Xu or believes they may
  have been a victim, to come forward – you will be listened to.” Suzanne Crane,
  of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “Xu is a serious danger to women, and
  the scale of his offending is such that without the brave testimony of victims
  who came forward after realising what had happened to them, [it] may well have
  continued undetected.” Xu was remanded into custody until he is due to be
  sentenced on 14 November. The judge, Simon Stirling, told him: “You have
  pleaded guilty to a large number of offences for which the inevitable outcome
  is a lengthy custodial sentence.”
