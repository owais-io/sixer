  Acheampong can step in for Colwill Enzo Maresca’s request for Chelsea to
  replace the injured Levi Colwill with a new centre-back remains unanswered.
  The club’s position is straightforward: there are no suitable defenders on the
  market and, in any case, it is up to Maresca to find internal solutions. The
  Italian can call upon Josh Acheampong, who performed well against Crystal
  Palace on the opening weekend. The 19-year-old started with Colwill’s
  long-term absence complicated by Tosin Adarabioyo’s minor injury. Adarabioyo
  may return for Friday night at West Ham but there is a case to give Acheampong
  another chance next to Trevoh Chalobah. Acheampong, who counts Manchester City
  as one of his many suitors, stood up to Jean-Phillipe Mateta in the goalless
  draw with Palace. It is worth having another look at whether he can cope as
  the central centre-back when Chelsea morph into a back three in possession.
  Replacing Colwill’s line-breaking passes will not be easy but Maresca has
  options. Jacob Steinberg West Ham v Chelsea, Friday 8pm (all times BST) Spurs
  must put Eze behind them Tottenham ride into the Etihad Stadium in the wake of
  the Eberechi Eze farrago. Perhaps Thomas Frank can use the crimson
  embarrassment of Arsenal gazumping his club for the Crystal Palace forward’s
  signature to inspire his men. Last November, under Ange Postecoglou, Spurs
  trounced Pep Guardiola’s champions 4-0. A repeat may seem unlikely given Eze’s
  morale-sapping choice plus Manchester City’s 4-0 opening-day victory at
  Wolves. However, Frank and his players’ job is to be able to show fight and
  spirit and tenacity precisely when it is difficult. So at lunchtime on
  Saturday, we will find out how much of these qualities they possess. Jamie
  Jackson Manchester City v Tottenham, Saturday 12.30pm Brentford look to
  Damsgaard for inspiration Things started appallingly for Keith Andrews in his
  new life as Brentford head coach. In the first 45 minutes of his senior
  managerial career, the Bees showed no identity, making life easy for
  Nottingham Forest. Clearly, the lack of Yoane Wissa and the failure to replace
  Bryan Mbeumo will cause problems but a key absence in the East Midlands was
  Mikkel Damsgaard, missing after his wife gave birth. Andrews spoke of his
  importance to the team; unsurprising because he won the players’ and fans’
  player of the year awards last season. The Dane’s return to the midfield will
  be imperative because Elliot Anderson and Morgan Gibbs-White dominated
  proceedings, unthreatened by anything akin to pressing. Alongside Damsgaard,
  Jordan Henderson may start after coming off the bench for his debut on Sunday.
  Experience will be helpful to Andrews, because he lacks it as a coach.
  Brentford were certainly better in the second half at Forest and the greater
  assurance of Damsgaard and Henderson can help their colleagues settle and
  forget that poor start. Will Unwin Brentford v Aston Villa, Saturday 3pm
  Burnley need a goal threat This feels like a game Burnley need to win already.
  The Clarets conceded almost a third of the entire tally of their goals-against
  column last season at Tottenham last weekend. Burnley were always going to be
  more porous at the back by the nature of stepping into the Premier League but
  on that basis, they need to find goals at the other end. Last season’s top
  scorer, Josh Brownhill, has departed and replacing his threat will be
  difficult. Lyle Foster started as the main striker at Spurs and it was a
  struggle for Burnley, manageing just four shots on target. Armando Broja is
  waiting in the wings but needs to work on his physical condition before he can
  be considered for selection, understandable after his history of injury
  problems. A lot of pressure is placed on the Albania striker’s shoulders in
  the medium to long term but there is an immediate issue this weekend. If Scott
  Parker does not find goals, it could set the tone for what is to come. WU
  Burnley v Sunderland, Saturday 3pm Cherries moving beyond summer exodus
  Bournemouth’s season is never going to hinge on results at the best teams in
  the division but an opening-day defeat at Anfield offered plenty of positives.
  A typically buccaneering performance by Andoni Iraola’s side suggested a
  summer of change has not been as damaging as perhaps feared. Adrien Truffert,
  the left-back signed from Rennes, was particularly impressive and they have
  since augmented their squad with addition of Amine Adli, who was part of Xabi
  Alonso’s double-winning Bayer Leverkusen side in 2023-24. Ben Gannon Doak –
  who wishes to reflect both his parents’ surnames – is another exciting arrival
  before hosting Wolves. Last week Dango Ouattara became the latest player to
  exit, for Brentford, in a deal worth up to £42.5m. A buzz does not breed
  guarantees but Bournemouth appear to have taken the summer exodus in their
  stride. Ben Fisher Bournemouth v Wolves, Saturday 3pm Merino set for emergency
  role Amid all the excitement about Eberechi Eze’s impending arrival at
  Arsenal, spare a thought for Mikel Merino. The Spain midfielder’s prospects in
  his favoured position already looked bleak after the signing of his compatriot
  Martín Zubimendi meant he started the season on the bench after spending the
  second half of the previous campaign filling in as a makeshift No 9. The knee
  injury suffered by Kai Havertz means Merino could find himself back in that
  position over the next few weeks, given he is the only other player in Mikel
  Arteta’s squad capable of replacing Viktor Gyökeres through the middle. Eze is
  expected to compete with Gabriel Martinelli on the left of Arsenal’s attack
  but can also play in midfield. The new man is unlikely to be available to face
  Leeds but Merino could have an important role to play. Ed Aarons Arsenal v
  Leeds, Saturday 5.30pm New home, familiar Everton problems It is the dawn of a
  new era for Everton as the £800m Hill Dickinson Stadium hosts its first
  competitive game and 52,769 fans adapt to plush modern surroundings. There
  will be pre-match events to mark the occasion, a special edition programme
  priced £10 and wide-eyed astonishment at the complete lack of obstructed
  views. It is a momentous day for the club and the city but Everton will be
  trying to tread a fine line between celebrating their new home while ensuring
  the focus remains on, and the fervour behind, David Moyes’s team. Monday’s
  performance at Leeds was chastening for those Evertonians who had approached
  the new campaign with unusual optimism, but perhaps not for the manager, who
  has spent all summer calling for more improvements to his squad. Everton were
  fortunate to lose their opening home game of last season 3-0 against Brighton,
  such was the second half dominance of Fabian Hürzeler’s side, and soon lost
  the positive momentum they had built up in the final weeks of the previous
  campaign. Everton require a fresh start all round. Andy Hunter Everton v
  Brighton, Sunday 2pm Glasner short on personnel for Palace We are only a week
  into the new season but Oliver Glasner already has concerns about a lack of
  squad depth at Crystal Palace. The expected departure of Eberechi Eze means
  Palace must act quickly to find a replacement, with Leicester’s Bilal El
  Khannouss and Tyler Dibling of Southampton among those considered. In the
  meantime, a knee injury to Daichi Kamada – who often played further forward
  under Glasner at Eintracht Frankfurt – could rule him out of the grudge match
  with Nottingham Forest on Sunday, meaning Palace may turn to their Community
  Shield penalty shootout hero Justin Devenny. The 21-year-old Northern
  Irishman, signed from Airdrie in 2023, made just four Premier League starts
  last season and has very big boots to fill. EA Crystal Palace v Nottingham
  Forest, Sunday 2pm Mount or Sesko is Amorim’s choice Flashes of positivity for
  Manchester United during their defeat by Arsenal are all well and good but
  Ruben Amorim could do with improved results. United must also improve in both
  boxes. Will Amorim tweaks his attack on Sunday? Does Mason Mount continue as a
  false No 9 or is Benjamin Sesko ready to lead the line from the start? There
  was a feeling United were not quite as effective after Mount went off against
  Arsenal. He has endured a wretched few years but is a useful, influential team
  player when on form, with the ability to create space for Bryan Mbeumo and
  Matheus Cunha. Still, Sesko has not been signed to sit on the bench. The
  gargantuan Slovenian is a handful for anyone, while a team who have struggled
  for goals under Amorim could do with a finisher in the starting XI. JS •
  Fulham v Manchester United, Sunday 4.30pm Isak wrangle will stoke fires at St
  James’ Matches involving Newcastle and Liverpool often contain a bit of an
  edge but this rerun of last season’s Carabao Cup final will surely take things
  to a different level. Eddie Howe’s team won that showpiece yet one of their
  heroes of the hour, Alexander Isak, is at war with Newcastle as he endeavours,
  currently rather forlornly, to engineer a move to Anfield. With the Sweden
  striker training alone the only certainty is that Isak will not be at St
  James’ Park, where geordie anger at Liverpool’s perceived tactics in
  unsettling Tyneside’s fallen idol should guarantee already febrile emotions
  run high. Howe is expected to field the former Everton winger, and boyhood
  Liverpool fan, Anthony Gordon out of position at centre-forward. Gordon, along
  with Isak and Fabian Schär, scored in last December’s fabulous 3-3 Premier
  League draw between these teams. Back then Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah scored
  twice in the course of a wonderful performance. The Egyptian’s duel with
  Howe’s likely left-back, Tino Livramento, could prove pivotal. Louise Taylor
