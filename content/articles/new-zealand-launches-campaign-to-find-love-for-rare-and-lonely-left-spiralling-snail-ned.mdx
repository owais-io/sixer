  New Zealand launches campaign to find love for rare and lonely left-spiralling
  snail Ned

  If you thought your dating pool was limited, spare a thought for Ned, a very
  rare snail unearthed in New Zealand. Due to a left-spiralling shell, Ned has a
  vanishingly small chance of finding a mate – a predicament that has sparked a
  nationwide campaign. Nearly all common garden snails have shells that coil to
  the right but Ned’s left-spiralling shell is like a mirror image, resulting in
  a flipped shell and reversed reproductive organs – a configuration that
  affects roughly 1 in 40,000 snails. Snails with shells and reproductive organs
  on the opposite side cannot mate with each other, so unless another similarly
  built snail is found, Ned will be forced to live a life of celibacy. Ned –
  named after The Simpson’s famous left-handed neighbour Ned Flanders – was
  discovered last week in a back garden in Wairarapa, an hour north of
  Wellington. Illustrator and author Giselle Clarkson was digging up vegetables
  in her garden when a snail dropped into the dirt. She was about to toss it
  away when she noticed something was a bit off. “Something was different but I
  couldn’t figure it out – the first thought that went through my mind was that
  it was a different species,” she tells the Guardian. She soon realised that
  the snail’s shell coiled on the left. “After you see something thousands and
  thousands of times looking one way, and then you suddenly see it the other way
  around, it is quite uncanny.” Clarkson had become familiar with
  left-spiralling snails through her work at New Zealand Geographic magazine and
  immediately knew she was dealing with something special. She made Ned a home
  in a fishbowl and contacted the magazine with her find. They have since
  launched a national campaign to find Ned a mate. The campaign urges people in
  New Zealand to rummage around their gardens and parks for left-coiled snails,
  and asks anyone who is lucky enough to find one to get in touch. Ned may be
  rare, but his plight is not the first to garner attention. In 2017, an
  international search was launched to find a mate for Jeremy, another lonely
  lefty discovered in London. Two eligible left-sided mates were discovered but
  made headlines when they ended up coupling with each other instead. Jeremy
  eventually mated with one of the pair and produced offspring with exclusively
  right-spiralling shells, before dying, aged two. Ned is a common garden snail,
  an introduced species that is considered a pest in New Zealand’s gardens. Some
  gardeners may raise their eyebrows at trying to boost their population – even
  if it is by just a handful – but the campaign has a broader purpose. “We’re
  all about trying to connect people with the environment,” said Catherine
  Woulfe, New Zealand Geographic editor. “[It] is light and fun but we hope it’s
  also a doorway into deeper topics like gardening, understanding the natural
  world, and the weird intricacies of reproduction,” she said. This month, a
  study revealed human connection to nature had declined by 60% in 200 years and
  introducing children to nature, as well as greening urban spaces were some of
  the best methods to help reverse the decline. “For the last two nights my kids
  have happily put on their gumboots and head torches and spent half an hour
  pottering around the garden, snail-hunting in the dark,” Woulfe said. “That
  feels like a win.”
