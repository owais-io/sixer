  Pam Bondi, the attorney general, said she has sent “sanctuary city” letters to
  the mayors of 32 cities and a handful of county executives, warning that she
  intends to prosecute political leaders who are not in her view sufficiently
  supportive of immigration enforcement. “You better be abiding by our federal
  policies and with our federal law enforcement, because if you’re not, we’re
  going to come after you,” she said, speaking to a Fox News reporter. “Our
  leaders have to support our law enforcement.” Bondi’s letter asks the
  recipients to provide a response by 19 August that “confirms your commitment
  with complying with federal law and identifies the immediate initiatives you
  are taking to eliminate laws, policies and practices that impede federal
  immigration enforcement”. Bondi cites an executive order issued by Donald
  Trump on 28 April which called for the attorney general to identify
  jurisdictions that “obstruct the enforcement of Federal immigration laws” then
  to “notify each sanctuary jurisdiction regarding its defiance of Federal
  immigration law enforcement and any potential violations of Federal criminal
  law” as a precursor to prosecution or withholding grants. Each of the
  recipients appears to have received a near-identical letter, none of which
  specify what local laws or practices fail to comply with Bondi’s assertions.
  Initial responses from state and local governments receiving the letters
  include a mix of incredulity and defiance. “Nothing in Attorney General
  Bondi’s letter is new and none of it has legal merit,” said Barbara Pierce,
  director of communications for the city of Rochester, New York. “The letter
  reiterates many of the frivolous arguments that the federal government has
  already made in its pending suit against the city of Rochester. These same
  arguments were levied against the city of Chicago and were dismissed by the
  federal district court for the eastern district of Illinois nearly a month
  ago. “We look forward to the opportunity to respond to attorney General
  Bondi’s letter, and continue to underscore the inaccuracies of the federal
  government’s position.” Bruce Harrell, the Seattle mayor, said the letter’s
  portrayal of his city and its laws was untruthful. “Immigration enforcement is
  the exclusive responsibility of the federal government. The city neither
  interferes with nor carries out those federal duties,” he said. “We have
  received and are reviewing the latest letter from Attorney General Bondi and
  strongly disagree with its assertions. Our laws and policies protect the
  safety, privacy and constitutional rights of all Seattle residents while
  remaining compliant with applicable law. “We remain committed to our local
  values, including being a welcoming city for all. We will continue to defend
  our residents and our rights – and we will not hesitate to do so in court.”
  The office of Eric Adams, the New York City mayor, a Trump ally and embattled
  re-election candidate, offered a less strident immediate response. “The job of
  a mayor is to protect the safety of every single person in their city – and
  that’s exactly what Mayor Adams has worked to do every day for nearly four
  years,” said Kayla Altus, Adams’ press secretary. “Keeping New Yorkers safe
  also means making sure they feel safe, and Mayor Adams has been clear: no one
  should be afraid to dial 911, send their kids to school, or go to the
  hospital, and no New Yorker should feel forced to hide in the shadows. “That’s
  why the mayor supports the essence of the local laws put in place by the city
  council, but he has also urged the council to reexamine them to ensure we can
  effectively work with the federal government to keep violent criminals off our
  streets.” The letters follow the publication of a revised “sanctuary
  jurisdiction” list on 5 August. The Department of Homeland Security withdrew a
  previous list after an outcry from rural sheriff’s offices and conservative
  jurisdictions that argued the list was created without input from sheriffs and
  “violated the core principles of trust, cooperation, and partnership with
  fellow law enforcement”.
