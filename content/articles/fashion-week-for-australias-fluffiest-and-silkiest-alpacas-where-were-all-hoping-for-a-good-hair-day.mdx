  It’s a scant 12C in Bendigo, but scores of fans whirr through the showground’s
  pavilion. The stars of this weekend’s proceedings hope to shine, but it’s
  important they don’t sweat too much before their time in the limelight. “They
  need to keep their hair nice and well done,” says Lee Sadler, vice-president
  of the Australian Alpaca Association. “We’re all hoping for a good hair day.”
  The Australian Alpaca National Show is fashion week for local camelids.
  Throughout the pavilion, pens filled with straw, feed and fans are set up to
  house the fluffiest, silkiest and shaggiest of the nation’s herd. Some alpacas
  have made the trip to rural Victoria from as far as Western Australia, and
  some farmers have travelled from Germany to see the best of Australia’s young
  but thriving alpaca industry over the three days. It’s an important event: a
  good hair day here can mean a blue ribbon, a trophy, a business advantage.
  “When you participate, you take the best of your herd,” says Sadler. At the
  end of the weekend, the most outstanding of all the classes is crowned Supreme
  Champion. It’s hard not to be enchanted by the alpacas, with their fluffy
  coats, long necks, big eyes and eyelashes that would make a supermodel
  jealous. Not to be confused with their llama cousins, alpacas are smaller,
  have longer, softer hair, and are generally less spitty and stubborn – though
  some of the animals strutting their stuff in the ring at Bendigo might give
  the bossiest llama a run for its money. Friday’s competitive circuit features
  six- to 12-month-old juniors – alpacas, not handlers – and 12- to
  -18-month-old intermediates. Pressing closely up to each competitor, one after
  another, are the judges, identifiable by their white armbands (against which
  they inspect the details of sample hairs) and that they’re wearing coloured
  jackets and ties while everyone else is rugged up in black puffers. The
  details of a good fleece are only visible up close: things like staple length
  and fineness, sheen and lustre, even distribution across the animal. A
  videographer follows the judges and zooms in, the footage livestreamed to a
  huge screen behind the trophy table so the audience can see what the judges
  do. Some alpacas loop the ring and pose calmly. Others are recalcitrant,
  pulling at their halters, refusing to be led in any direction, leaping about –
  even launching themselves on to their handlers, who try desperately to settle
  them, acutely conscious that there is no dignified way to wrestle an alpaca.
  There are two distinct types of alpaca: most of those in Australia are
  Huacaya, which look like fluffy long-necked teddy bears; between 10% and 20%
  are the longer-haired Suri. Suri look shaggier but their fleece is finer,
  shinier and sought after in couture and high-fashion suiting. There are about
  350,000 alpacas in Australia, though numbers may be higher after a baby boom a
  couple of years ago. Australia has the largest herd outside South America – no
  mean feat for a species that was only introduced here 35 years ago. A 2021
  Agrifutures report estimated that more than two-thirds of alpacas were used to
  produce fibre for sale, and surmised the industry to be worth $19.5m at the
  time. Ron Condon was one of Australia’s first alpaca farmers, and he’s still
  going. A founder of the alpaca association, he was one of a handful of players
  integral to the importation of about 400 high-quality Peruvian alpacas between
  2000 and 2005, a project that involved not insignificant political
  manoeuvring, altitude sickness and a particularly bad case of food poisoning –
  leading to a significant increase in the quality of fleece produced by
  Australia’s herd. Prior to that, all the alpacas in Australia had come from
  Chile. “[The Peruvian breeder] said to me in Spanish, ‘You can have anything
  but my soul,” Condon says. “We had access to his best animals … We were very
  lucky.” Show convener Jonathon Provis-Vincent has been shearing alpacas for 12
  years and breeding them for 10. He met his partner Maddy Bissels through
  alpacas, and the couple have a herd of about 80 at their farm in Ararat, about
  180km west of Melbourne. “They actually do have personality. They each have
  their own character and little social hierarchy,” Provis-Vincent says. He has
  fond memories of one of his first alpacas, a female named Galaxy, who he says
  helped him fall in love with the breed. “You could just walk up to her and
  hold her and she’d actually lean into you for pats,” he says. “And then if
  you’re standing there holding her, if you look at her, she then moves her nose
  up to like give you kisses.” Every farmer has an alpaca they remember, though
  farm stories are always flavoured with a particular kind of humour. Ros Davis,
  from Elimbari Alpacas outside Canberra, tells me about a naughty alpaca named
  Monet that had a penchant for escaping – an unacceptable hazard for both
  alpaca and human. “We found him out on the road one night,” Davis says. “We
  ate him after that.” Soon after Monet had been taken to the butcher, however,
  she and her husband went into Canberra only to find the town bedecked with
  banners advertising an exhibition of works by the great (human) artist and
  their late alpaca’s namesake. “We felt so awful!” she says. “We’d just put him
  in the freezer!” Most alpaca farmers have only smallish herds, and often have
  a second income source. That’s changing, though, as the industry ages and some
  farms become intergenerational. Max Mathews, for example, works at the alpaca
  farm started by his grandparents. His grandmother, Fay Wilson, holds the
  halter of his animals in waiting as he and his partner Taryn lead each
  competitor into the ring. The fashion, arts and crafts community is becoming
  an increasing presence at the show, as for most alpaca farmers these days, the
  focus is on breeding for fibre quality rather than stud stock. The market for
  alpaca meat in Australia is only very niche and limited by infrastructure –
  namely a scarcity of abattoirs with credentials to work with camelids. Alpaca
  yarn behaves differently to sheep’s wool, which can take some crafters by
  surprise, especially if they’re familiar with the bounce and elasticity of
  merino or corriedale. While the alpaca craft show is modest in size compared
  to the vast multi-shed spread of Bendigo’s annual Australian Sheep and Wool
  Show, interest here has also grown. Conveners of the craft competition say
  they received just 15 entries a few years ago, but had 130 this year. It took
  some work for alpacas to be seen as a legitimate, viable livestock industry in
  the eyes of big ag, Sadler says, but she believes they have finally made space
  for themselves at the table. “We’re not a hobby. This is not a fancy kennel
  club. We are a sustainable, viable fibre industry.” She is a deep enthusiast
  for alpaca fibre. “Alpaca is the most insulating natural fibre in the world.
  It’s light and warm and comfortable. It’s very comforting to wear and it’s
  difficult to convey that until people actually put it on and they go, ‘oh, it
  feels so nice’.”
