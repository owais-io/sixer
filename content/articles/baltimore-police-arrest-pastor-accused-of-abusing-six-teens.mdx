  A former Maryland youth pastor has been arrested on suspicion of molesting at
  least six teenagers, the Baltimore county police department (BCPD) has said,
  alleging offenses between 2006 and 2010. Thomas Pinkerton, 52, known as Pastor
  Tommy, allegedly told children in his youth group that it was normal for a
  pastor to kiss boys on the lips because that’s how Jesus greeted his
  disciples, according to an arrest warrant recently made public. The arrest
  warrant alleges the abuse included inappropriate touching and kissing of six
  teenagers in Maryland who ranged in age from 13 to 19 – and that it took place
  both at the Central Christian Church, an Assemblies of God church in Baltimore
  county, as well as at Pinkerton’s home. A seventh person – described as a man
  – reported abuse by Pinkerton in Georgia, according to the warrant. Pinkerton,
  who has since worked as a traveling evangelist in at least six states and in
  South America, Europe and Asia, was extradited from Georgia to Maryland on 6
  August to face 24 felony and misdemeanor counts. He has pleaded not guilty,
  according to his attorney. Detectives started investigating Pinkerton after
  the accusers at the center of the accusations came forward in the fall of
  2024. They alleged that Pinkerton would give them massages and rub their
  penises. According to the arrest warrant, several said Pinkerton would greet
  them with a “heavenly kiss” or “brotherly kiss” on the lips and described
  himself as their “spiritual father”. Detectives are are now asking for anyone
  with additional information to come forward, believing there may be more
  victims than are known at the moment. Assemblies of God, the world’s largest
  Pentecostal denomination, with nearly 3 million members across 13,000 churches
  in the US, has been hit with a number of sex abuse allegations. Central
  Christian said Pinkerton served on its staff more than 15 years ago, and
  individuals with similar accounts have come forward since the alleged abuse
  was reported to law enforcement. “There is absolutely no place for abuse –
  ever – in the church,” Central Christian’s lead pastor, Larry Kirk, said in a
  statement posted on its website. Assemblies of God officials said Pinkerton
  was never formally credentialed as a minister with the denomination. “We are
  so saddened to hear of this report and are deeply concerned whenever reports
  like this come out,” said Benjamin Rainey Jr, secretary-treasurer of the
  Assemblies of God regional office that oversees Maryland. The New Chapel in
  Grand Rapids, Michigan, where Pinkerton once preached, said on its website
  that it had cut ties with Pinkerton before his arrest. “We were heartbroken to
  hear of these serious allegations that occurred in Baltimore, Maryland, nearly
  20 years ago, and communicated the situation to our church family after
  severing all ties with the accused several months back,” New Chapel’s
  statement said. “Our prayers and continued cooperation are toward justice for
  the victims.” NBC News recently reported that the ministry directed hundreds
  of students to Daniel Savala, a convicted sex offender seen by some as “the
  holiest man alive”. Leaders of the church have pledged to make changes to
  prevent similar abuses in the future. Pinkerton’s attorney, Justin Hollimon,
  told NBC that his client was “completely shocked” by the charges. “He is a
  pastor,” Hollimon said of Pinkerton. “He gave his life to the community,
  worked for the community. He’s anxiously waiting his day in court.”
