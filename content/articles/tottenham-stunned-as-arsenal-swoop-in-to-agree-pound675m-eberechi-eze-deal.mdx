  Arsenal have agreed a deal worth up to £67.5m for Eberechi Eze and look poised
  to sensationally hijack Tottenham’s move for the England forward. It is
  understood that Mikel Arteta’s side made an approach to Crystal Palace over
  Eze after Kai Havertz sustained a knee injury during Arsenal’s win against
  Manchester United on Sunday. Arsenal are continuing to assess the injury but
  fear that the German forward could be absent for an extended period, even if
  the early indications are that it is not extremely serious. But the
  uncertainty prompted Arsenal to accelerate their interest in Eze, with sources
  indicating that they have remained in constant contact with the 27‑year‑old’s
  representatives all summer. Tottenham had looked in pole position to sign him
  after stepping up their interest over the weekend and are believed to have
  agreed a deal worth close to his release clause of £68m, which expired last
  week. Yet with Arteta keen to add to his attacking reinforcements as they
  attempt to become champions for the first time since 2004, it is understood
  that the sporting director, Andrea Berta, and vice-chairman, Tim Lewis,
  contacted Palace on Wednesday to gazump their north London rivals. Eze, who
  has made no secret of his desire to test himself at the highest level by
  playing for a club in the Champions League, has indicated he would prefer to
  join the club that released him at the age of 13 rather than their north
  London rivals. Arsenal are believed to have agreed a deal with the Palace
  chair, Steve Parish, in which they will pay a large chunk of the initial £60m
  fee up front, with another £7.5m in bonuses. QPR, from whom Palace signed him
  in 2020 for £19.5m, are due a 15% sell-on fee of any profit they make.
  Personal terms are not expected to be an issue. It is understood that Eze will
  play for Palace in the first leg of Crystal Palace’s Conference League playoff
  on Thursday and have an opportunity to bid farewell to the supporters after
  scoring the winning goal in the FA Cup final in May. He is then expected to
  complete his medical and become Arsenal’s seventh summer signing. Oliver
  Glasner, the Palace manager, praised Eze’s attitude as speculation has mounted
  over his future, with doubts over whether he would feature against Chelsea in
  their opening Premier League game when he had a free‑kick disallowed by the
  video assistant referee. “I’m still disappointed that this goal was disallowed
  and he will show a great performance tomorrow,” Glasner said. Havertz, who
  played 31 minutes as a substitute at Old Trafford on Sunday, did not take part
  in an open training session at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday morning. His
  absence would leave Arteta with the new signing Viktor Gyökeres as the only
  available recognised striker in his squad, with Gabriel Jesus not expected to
  return from a knee injury in the near future. Mikel Merino filled in when
  Havertz missed 18 matches last season after sustaining a hamstring injury in
  February, and the Spain midfielder scored seven goals from then until May.
  Arteta expressed his desire that Havertz could play alongside Gyökeres in
  pre-season. “Kai can play in different positions, as well,” he said. “I think
  it elevates the quality in the squad, the goal threat that we have in the
  team, the options that we have to change and provide oppositions with a lot of
  problems.” Arsenal have already spent almost £200m this summer and are still
  hoping to move on a number of fringe players before the end of the transfer
  window. Jakub Kiwior and Oleksandr Zinchenko both have interest from Porto,
  with Italian clubs having also been linked to the Poland defender. Kiwior is
  understood to prefer to move overseas despite interest from other Premier
  League clubs after he deputised for the injured Gabriel Magalhães last season.
  Arsenal are in talks with Stuttgart over a move for Fábio Vieira, while Reiss
  Nelson could rejoin Fulham after spending last season on loan in west London.
  Eze’s potential arrival could also mean they step up attempts to sell Leandro
  Trossard.
