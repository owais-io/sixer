  Europe’s tumbling gas prices caused profits at Shell to slump by almost a
  third in the last quarter after denting the earnings in its gas trading
  business. Gas prices in Europe fell by almost a fifth between April and June
  this year after a sudden ceasefire forged between Iran and Israel eased fears
  that gas deliveries via the strait of Hormuz might be disrupted by conflict.
  The biggest weekly slump in gas prices in almost two years helped to dent
  Shell’s adjusted earnings for the second quarter, which fell by almost a third
  from last year to $4.26bn (£3.22bn). However, profits at Europe’s largest
  fossil fuel company were still higher than City forecasts, which had predicted
  a larger drop in profits to $3.7bn, allowing Shell to continue handing out
  bumper payouts to its shareholders. Shell attributed the profit drop to “lower
  trading and optimisation margins” as well as lower prices for oil and gas. In
  addition to the fall in European gas prices, Brent crude was trading below $68
  a barrel at the end of the quarter, down sharply from more than $86 a barrel a
  year earlier. Despite the fall in profits and a rise in debt, Shell is
  continuing to pump money back to its investors through share buyback schemes.
  It announced it would spend $3.5bn buying back shares in the third quarter of
  the year. Shell’s chief executive, Wael Sawan, said the company had delivered
  a strong operational performance in “a less favourable macro environment”. Gas
  prices were rocked by the Middle East conflict and were also weaker after a
  slump in Chinese energy demand amid fears that Donald Trump’s trade tariffs
  would hinder its economic growth. Lower demand for gas in China meant more
  shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the global market were available
  to European buyers, which helped to cool market prices. The weaker gas prices,
  although challenging for Shell, have meant lower bills for households. In the
  UK, the government’s energy price cap fell by 7% from July and was expected to
  remain at a similar level from September, according to forecasts. Sawan told
  CNBC: “The tricky thing was, it was non-fundamentals-based volatility. And
  what I mean by that is this wasn’t fundamental changes to supply demand
  balances. This was not a change to physical commodity flows. This was really
  sort of paper-induced volatility, and that is not what we typically trade
  into.” Derren Nathan, the head of equity research at the investment platform
  Hargreaves Lansdown, said a recent rise in oil prices should help Shell’s
  financial performance improve in the third quarter of the year. “Shell’s
  second-quarter earnings hit a bit of an oil patch, with lower commodity
  prices, a weaker trading environment and unplanned downtime at its chemical
  plants all playing their part,” he said. Shell’s profits continue to anger
  environmental campaigners, after the company last year rolled back
  decarbonisation targets. Robin Wells, the director of Fossil Free London, a
  campaign group that protested outside Shell’s headquarters on Wednesday night,
  said: “We are now in a new normal of record-breaking heat, created by
  corporations like Shell. This will mean devastation and mass loss of human
  life. Climate scientists have warned us that this new normal will spell the
  end of human civilisation by 2100. It’s time for destruction to stop raising
  billions in profit.”
