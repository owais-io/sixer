  David Lammy is good with words. He says “we need an immediate ceasefire”, in
  response to Israel’s horrific double tap attack on Nasser hospital (Israel
  bombed Gaza hospital a second time, killing rescuers, say health officials, 25
  August). But he is, as usual, hopeless at following up the fine words with any
  action. Ofer Cassif makes clear that the UK government is already “complicit
  in this devastating human-made catastrophe” (Protests in Tel Aviv, army
  reservists refusing to serve: in Israel, more of us are saying no to this
  endless war, 25 August), but lists a number of steps that Keir Starmer and
  Lammy could take to end this complicity. These include the immediate
  unconditional recognition of Palestine, acknowledging Benjamin Netanyahu as a
  war criminal and supporting new West Bank sanctions. Above all, they must
  “recognise the people of Gaza as victims of a continuing genocide”, with the
  actions that would have to follow from that under the genocide convention. It
  is depressing beyond words that the government refuses to call the destruction
  of Gaza and its people a genocide until the international court of justice
  delivers its final verdict, which will take years and by which time there may
  not be anyone left alive in Gaza. I don’t know how Starmer and Lammy live with
  themselves, knowing that their refusal to take every possible step to stop
  Israel’s horrific assault on Gaza makes them complicit in everything Israel
  does. Shame on them. Richard Barnes Windermere, Cumbria • Once again, a
  completely inadequate response from our government to this latest war crime
  from the Israeli government. Our government could respond with real sanctions
  against Israel. Instead, we get the same old 10 minutes of hand-wringing and
  then business as usual. I can’t decide if this is the result of an almost
  pathological fear of offending Donald Trump or a total moral vacuum at the
  heart of the Labour party. Either way, it gives me little hope for the future
  of our country. Hilary Lang Frome, Somerset • Owen Jones is right (From the
  streets of Baghdad, I saw a clear line to the bloodshed in Gaza, 26 August).
  The politicians who authorised military campaigns in Libya, Syria and
  especially Iraq continue to be feted by a culpable media as grandees and
  voices of experience to be tapped for insights into the latest global crises.
  If Tony Blair, George Bush and others had instead been held to criminal
  account, or at least seen their reputations flayed in the public eye, the
  political space available to those complicit in Gaza’s horrors would have been
  significantly narrowed. That should not discourage us from raising our voices.
  The huge mobilisations against the Iraq invasion helped caution UK governments
  against attempting to justify future military adventures as freedom exported
  at the end of the barrel of a gun. If the people of Gaza can sustain hope in
  hopeless conditions, we have an inescapable duty to hold to account those with
  responsibility closer to home. Mike Cowley Edinburgh • There is no discounting
  anything that Martin Griffiths, the former UN under-secretary general, wrote
  (I’ve seen the UN at its best. As it turns 80, with a world in crisis, it must
  recover its courage, 26 August). But if the deaths and injuries in Gaza, the
  courage of doctors, journalists, rescuers and families, the ever-present risk
  of violating international law (Israel’s attack on hospital in Gaza may
  constitute a war crime on many fronts, 25 August), the pleas of NGOs and
  inevitable global condemnation are insufficient to deter Israel, or oblige the
  US to withdraw support, what can the UN do that it isn’t already trying? It is
  the decisions of states that allow the defiance of UN resolutions to continue
  in Palestine and elsewhere. Janet Dubé Peebles, Scottish Borders • Have an
