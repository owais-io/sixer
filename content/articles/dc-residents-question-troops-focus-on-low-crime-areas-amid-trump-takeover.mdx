  As Donald Trump’s federal takeover of Washington DC’s police entered its
  second week, and six states vowed to send hundreds of additional national
  guard troops to assist the administration, residents questioned why federal
  agents seem to be largely patrolling high-profile but low-crime parts of the
  nation’s capital. The Washington Post has tracked where federal forces are
  patrolling the city, finding that few interactions have been witnessed in the
  parts of the city with the highest rates of crime. The White House rejected
  that claim on Tuesday, saying that “nearly half of non-immigration related
  arrests have happened in the most crime-hit areas in DC”, but before Tuesday,
  the White House had been releasing data showing many of their arrests were of
  undocumented immigrants, and few federal agents have been spotted addressing
  or responding to violent crime. Instead, Washingtonians have seen officers
  from the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and other offices standing
  around prominent tourist sites and nightlife corridors, responding to minor
  disturbances and creating disturbances of their own. Over the weekend, several
  military vehicles were seen outside Union Station, positioned next to where
  passengers find their ride share vehicles. The Department of Defense posted a
  photo of a tan Humvee outside the train station on X on Saturday and said:
  “This We’ll Defend.” Federal agents and vehicles have also been spotted across
  the National Mall, including the Lincoln Memorial, where violent crime is
  virtually nonexistent. Visible confrontations between federal officers and
  protesters have also occurred along 14th Street, a popular nightlife
  destination. Amanda Moore, a Washington-based writer and researcher, wrote on
  X early on Saturday morning that she witnessed “15 federal agents call an
  ambulance for a very, very drunk and sick girl” in Dupont Circle, another
  center of nightlife. Stan Veuger, a senior fellow at the conservative American
  Enterprise Institute thinktank, joked on X, referring to the “department of
  government efficiency”: “I was wrong about Doge. The federal government is
  efficient now.” In the Mount Pleasant neighborhood, which is home to a large
  Hispanic population, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) shared a
  video on Sunday of at least seven agents taking down a banner supporting
  immigrant neighbors from a public park. “Mount Pleasant melts Ice,” the banner
  read. After removing it, a masked agent says: “Mine. We’re taking America back
  baby.” According to a local reporter and a neighbor’s surveillance camera
  footage, the agents left a dildo in its place. The banner was quickly
  replaced. Trump has tried to depict the nation’s capital as a city rife with
  violent crime, but violent crime is at a 30-year low after a spike in 2023.
  The president has stated, without evidence, that crime data is manipulated and
  rates are worse than they appear. Washingtonians have noted how quiet
  nightlife felt during the first weekend of the federal takeover, although
  August is typically a slower period in the capital with Congress on recess. On
  a busy stretch of the heavily Hispanic Columbia Heights neighborhood where
  street vendors typically sell anything from fruits to clothing, the streets
  have been empty. Democrats in Congress last week introduced a joint resolution
  to end what they described as “egregious attacks on DC home rule” and the city
  secured a small legal victory late last week when the White House agreed to
  leave the Metropolitan police department (MPD) under the control of its chief,
  Pamela Smith.
