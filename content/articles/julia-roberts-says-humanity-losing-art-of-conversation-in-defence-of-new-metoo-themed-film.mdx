  Julia Roberts has defended her new #MeToo-themed film, After the Hunt, from
  accusations that it revives anti-feminist arguments, saying humanity was at
  risk of “losing the art of conversation”. The Oscar-winning actor is making
  her Venice film festival debut with the psychological thriller from the
  Italian director Luca Guadagnino. It premieres out of competition on the Lido
  on Friday evening. The drama is set in the world of higher education and stars
  Roberts as a beloved professor who finds herself at a personal and
  professional crossroads when a star student (the Bear’s Ayo Edebiri) makes an
  accusation of assault against her friend and colleague (Andrew Garfield). The
  cast also includes Michael Stuhlbarg and Chloë Sevigny. Unsurprisingly, the
  film’s exploration of conflict and power dynamics spilled into a press
  conference on Friday, where the first question to Roberts was whether the
  drama undermined feminist principles. “Not to be disagreeable because it’s not
  in my nature,” Roberts responded with a smile. “I don’t think it’s just
  reviving an argument of women being pitted against each other or not
  supporting each other. There’s a lot of old arguments that get rejuvenated in
  this movie in a way that does create conversation. “The best part of your
  question is that you all came out of the theatre talking about it. That’s how
  we wanted it to feel. You realise what you believe in strongly because we stir
  it all up for you. So, you’re welcome,” the star said jokingly. Guadagnino
  added: “We are looking at people in their truths. Everyone has their own
  truths. It’s not that one truth is more important than another. “And from the
  perspective of film-makers and artists, how do we see the clash of truth, and
  what is the boundary of these truths together? It’s not about making a
  manifesto to revive old-fashioned values.” There were several more questions
  about the film’s politics and whether it was attempting to stoke controversy.
  Roberts and Edebiri were also asked what had attracted them to playing
  “troubled women”. “Trouble is where the juicy stuff is,” Roberts said. “It’s
  like dominos of conflict, once one falls, then suddenly everywhere you turn,
  there’s some new piece of conflict and challenge. That’s what makes it worth
  getting up and going to work in the morning.” “That’s how you grow,” Edebiri
  said. “That’s the type of movie I enjoy watching.” Roberts explained that
  working on After the Hunt reminded her of Bruce Beresford’s 1983 drama Tender
  Mercies, which followed a former country music star whose career and
  relationship with his ex-wife and daughter are wrecked by alcoholism. “I just
  thought there was something magical about the idea that a camera just landed
  in a place and happened to document what was going on where it landed. That’s
  how I feel about this movie,” she said. “It’s not so much that we’re making a
  statement. We’re just sharing these lives for this moment, and then we want
  everyone to go away and talk to each other. That, to me, is the most exciting
  bit because we’re kind of losing the art of conversation in humanity right
  now.” Elsewhere, Guadagnino was asked why the opening credits appeared to hark
  back to the classic font used in the credits of many films directed by Woody
  Allen. “The crass answer would be why not,” he replied. “When I started
  thinking about this movie with my collaborators, we couldn’t stop thinking of
  Crimes and Misdemeanors or Another Woman, or even Hannah and Her Sisters. And
  there was an infrastructure to the story that felt very linked to the great
  oeuvre of Woody Allen between 1985 and 1991. “It also felt like an interesting
  nod to thinking of an artist who has been facing some sort of problems with
  his being. And what is our responsibility in looking at the work of an artist
  that we love like him? And by the way, that font is a classic,” Guadagnino
  said.
