  Nigel Farage wants you to believe Britain could deport 288,000 people
  annually. That’s nearly 800 a day – 30 times the current rate of
  asylum-related returns. This is a fantasy concealing his real aim: to destroy
  public trust in democratic institutions, crush legal constraints and turn fear
  into power. Mr Farage isn’t trying to fix the asylum system. In fact, he wants
  to dismantle the political framework necessary to achieve that goal: the
  treaties, parliamentary conventions and centuries of legal protections. In
  their place, a Reform government would operate by executive fiat cloaked in
  nationalist rhetoric. “Operation Restoring Justice” is a louder, more extreme
  version of Rishi Sunak’s failed 2023 strategy to detain everyone, deport
  everyone and process no one. This led to a backlog of unheard asylum claims,
  spiralling hotel costs and public anger – with no drop in small boat
  crossings. But Mr Farage wants to go further. He pledges to withdraw from the
  European convention on human rights (ECHR); repeal the Human Rights Act to
  remove legal routes of appeal; disapply the UN refugee convention for five
  years; and exit anti-torture and anti-trafficking treaties. European Union
  countries have offered a degree of voluntary repatriation or coordinated
  returns, but they are circumscribed by legal frameworks and human rights
  standards. By comparison, Reform UK is proposing that the country leaves the
  international legal order altogether. This is the British version of Trumpism
  – whipping up anger with inflammatory rhetoric so that populist grievances
  justify the removal of legal and moral constraints on state power. The
  practical flaws are obvious. The UK has just 2,200 detention places. Mr Farage
  wants 24,000. The record of detention centres is an unhappy one. Deportation
  relies on returns deals, but none exist with most countries people are
  fleeing, including Iran, Syria, Afghanistan and Sudan. Nor is France likely to
  cooperate if the ECHR is declared void. But Mr Farage doesn’t need a real
  plan. He needs a story. His is that Britain is being invaded by “fighting-age
  men” who are threatening “our women and girls”. There are familiar tropes
  about the elite protecting foreigners, not Britons, while “activist” lawyers
  and foreign courts hold the country hostage. Mr Farage is hawking resentment
  under the cover of a reset. Asked whether deporting people to possible torture
  or death bothered him, Mr Farage said yes, but what really bothers him is
  women’s safety in Britain. It’s a telling deflection. Reform UK’s leader
  didn’t raise such concerns until it served his agenda. This is a zero-sum
  moral framing: protect them or us. Faragism is the opportunistic politics of
  outrage masquerading as principle. Shamefully, populist media laps it up.
  Labour must understand the threat for what it is. This is not a policy
  contest. It is an attack on democratic norms – the kind that paves the way for
  repressive rule by and for economic elites, under the guise of national
  restoration. That’s Donald Trump’s game. It’s Mr Farage’s too. To beat it,
  Labour must offer a moral and institutional counterattack, pairing ethical
  clarity with policy competence. This means faster asylum decisions, legal
  routes, credible returns agreements and a clear line that Britain does not
  deport those fleeing persecution back into harm’s way. Mr Farage’s false
  choice is between control and compassion, when Britain needs both. It’s a
  provocation. But provocation can work in politics unless others step up to
  show the country what real leadership looks like. Do you have an opinion on
  the issues raised in this article? If you would like to submit a response of
