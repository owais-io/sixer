  Ministers should conduct a review of safety for probation officers across
  England and Wales after a stabbing incident that has deeply concerned
  frontline staff, a watchdog has told the Guardian. The call from Martin Jones,
  the chief inspector of probation, follows demands for walk-through metal
  detectors and security guards to help protect caseworkers as they interact
  with growing numbers of released offenders. A man was charged last week with
  the attempted murder of a probation officer in her 30s who was stabbed at work
  in Preston, Lancashire. Ryan Gee, 35 and of no fixed address, is due before
  Preston magistrates court accused of attempted murder, threatening a person
  with an offensive weapon or bladed article in a private place, two counts of
  possessing a knife blade in a public place, possession of an imitation firearm
  with intent to cause fear of violence, and false imprisonment. After the
  incident, a petition calling for enhanced security has gained more than 15,000
  signatures and support from dozens of probation staff. Probation officers face
  extra work and increasing contact with serious offenders after the early
  release of prisoners to ease overcrowding in jails. Ministers are releasing
  some violent prisoners, those convicted of sexual offences and domestic
  abusers, after serving a third of their sentences in an effort to reduce
  pressure on prisons. Asked if he backed calls for an immediate review of
  safety procedures, Jones, who was the chief executive of the Parole Board for
  nine years, said: “Probation staff do a vital job at the frontline of the
  justice system managing a large and complex caseload. It is vital that there
  is a proper review to learn lessons from the recent serious and concerning
  attack on an officer. Probation staff deserve to be safe in their work.”
  According to the petition, many probation offices do not have dedicated
  security personnel, nor do they consistently use metal detectors or other
  screening methods to ensure the safety of their staff and visitors. “This
  oversight places probation officers at significant risk, potentially exposing
  them to threats and violence from the very individuals they are working to
  help rehabilitate,” the petition says. Most probation offices have panic
  alarms on the walls and no security guards. There is no guarantee that staff
  will be able to reach them if they are attacked. In comments below the
  petition, one staff member wrote: “Since starting my new office in January, I
  have witnessed colleagues being punched, and on one occasion trapped in a room
  with an angry and aggressive service user. We do our best to manage risk. We
  use body cues, we use high-risk rooms, we ask our colleagues to keep an eye
  out if we are concerned. But we work with humans, who are unpredictable. With
  the best will in the world, we cannot read their minds.” A former probation
  officer said they left the service because of threats, abuse and a lack of
  security. “I worked in the Probation Service for five years before leaving,
  one of the reasons being the relentless abuse, threats of violence and the
  lack of security in our offices. Time and again, concerns about safety were
  not taken seriously,” they said. The total number of offenders on probation in
  England and Wales at the end of March 2025 was 241,540, a 9% increase compared
  with March 2015. The government began freeing thousands of inmates early in
  September to curb jail overcrowding, by temporarily reducing the proportion of
  sentences that some prisoners must serve behind bars from 50% to 40%. A
  sentencing review by the former Conservative justice secretary David Gauke
  called for more criminals to serve their sentences in the community while
  being monitored by the Probation Service. The Probation Service said it was
  conducting a review of the incident in Preston, and would consider whether
  further changes were needed nationally. A spokesperson said an internal
  investigation that would consider the security measures at the site had
  already been launched. Officials are limited in what they can say because of
  the continuing police investigation and criminal charges. “Our thoughts remain
  with the probation officer involved, their family and their colleagues,” they
  said. “We will not tolerate assaults on our hard-working staff. We have
  already launched an urgent investigation into security measures at Preston and
  will use the findings to consider whether further changes are needed across
  the entire service to ensure all staff are better protected.”
