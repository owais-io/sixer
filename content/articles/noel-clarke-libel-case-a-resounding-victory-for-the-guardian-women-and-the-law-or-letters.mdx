  While I wholeheartedly agree that the Guardian deserves credit for defending
  the Noel Clarke libel case, Katharine Viner misses a vital component in her
  conclusion (The Noel Clarke judgment is a victory for the brave women who told
  us their stories – and for journalism, 22 August). Yes it was a “good day for
  the Guardian, for media in the public interest, and for women” – but it was
  also a good day for the judiciary. Without confidence in the integrity of our
  court system, the risks of pursuing the case to a conclusion may well have
  been stacked against you. Mrs Justice Steyn gave a resounding condemnation of
  Clarke’s behaviour and upheld the accuracy of the stories published. Well done
  her, the Guardian and the women who bravely told their stories. Anne King
  Lynton, Devon • I am a dad of two young daughters; the more they grow in this
  world, the more I am concerned about their safety in our society and the
  directions that it seems to take at times. Reading about this story of the
  Noel Clarke trial, the bravery of the witnesses and the journalists, and
  seeing it finally through as it deserves, with justice, gives me hope for the
  future of my daughters and the world they’ll grow in. Thank you very much.
  Marco Ranzani Saffron Walden, Essex • Well done, Katharine Viner and the
  Guardian’s investigations team, for supporting the women who worked with Noel
  Clarke and suffered all manner of misconduct. It is a long time since I was a
  journalist, but the Guardian’s positive approach made me proud of all involved
  in this terrific piece of investigative reporting. Wendy James Cambridge •
