  Indonesia will convert a medical facility on an uninhabited island to treat
  about 2,000 wounded residents of Gaza, according to a spokesperson for the
  president. “Indonesia will give medical help for about 2,000 Gaza residents
  who became victims of war, those who are wounded, buried under debris,” the
  spokesperson, Hasan Nasbi, told reporters in Jakarta on Thursday. Indonesia
  plans to allocate the facility on Galang island, home to a former refugee camp
  for Vietnamese asylum seekers which lies off its island of Sumatra, to treat
  the wounded Gaza residents and temporarily shelter their families, he said.
  The patients would be taken back to Gaza after they had healed, he added,
  without providing further details on the timing of the plan, or how their
  return would be guaranteed. Muslim-majority Indonesia has sent humanitarian
  aid to Gaza after Israel started an offensive in October 2023 that Gaza health
  officials say has killed more than 60,000 Palestinians. The announcement
  follows a report by Axios in July that the director of Israel’s Mossad spy
  agency had visited Washington to seek US help in convincing several countries,
  including Indonesia, Libya and Ethiopia, to take in hundreds of thousands of
  Palestinians from Gaza. The three countries mentioned reportedly expressed an
  “openness to receiving large numbers of Palestinians from Gaza”. A
  spokesperson for the Indonesian foreign ministry unequivocally denied the
  report to the Guardian at the time, saying the government “had never discussed
  such a plan with anybody”. This week’s announcement also comes months after an
  offer from Indonesia’s president Prabowo Subianto to shelter wounded
  Palestinians drew criticism from Indonesia’s top clerics for seeming too close
  to US president Donald Trump’s suggestion of permanently moving Palestinians
  out of Gaza. Trump vowed in February that the US would “take over” war-ravaged
  Gaza, after which it would be transformed into the “Riviera of the Middle
  East”. Buya Anwar Abbas, the deputy chair of Indonesia’s Ulema Council, warned
  Indonesians in April to be wary of Prabowo’s offer. “Learning from history,
  Indonesia must be smart in dealing with Israel’s manoeuvres. We must not allow
  our country to be deceived,” he said. If medical aid is needed for Gaza
  residents affected by Israel’s recent attacks, he argued that treatment should
  take place in Gaza, not elsewhere. “As a nation that endured 350 years of
  colonisation, we must recognise that occupiers have countless tricks and
  deceptions. We must not fall for their sweet words,” he said. Another senior
  leader from Indonesia’s largest Muslim organisations, Nahdlatul Ulama, Rais
  Syuriah, also questioned the motive of the plan. “Is there a guarantee they
  can return to Gaza? Aren’t there many Palestinians out there who still can’t
  return home?” he asked, “This could actually make it easier for Israel to
  occupy more Palestinian land.” Indonesia’s foreign ministry, which backs a
  two-state solution to resolve the Middle East crisis, said at the time it
  “strongly rejects any attempt to forcibly displace Palestinians”. A hospital
  to treat victims of the Covid-19 pandemic opened in 2020 on Galang, which had
  been until 1996 a sprawling refugee camp run by the United Nations, housing
  250,000 of those who fled the Vietnam war.
