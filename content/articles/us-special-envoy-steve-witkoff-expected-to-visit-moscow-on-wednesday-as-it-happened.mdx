  … and on that note, it’s a wrap! US envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to visit
  Moscow on Wednesday, Tass news agency reported (12:41), just days before
  Donald Trump’s deadline for Moscow to move on Ukraine which expires on Friday.
  The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said that Russia considered direct
  engagement with the US “important, substantial and helpful” and that a meeting
  between Witkoff and president Vladimir Putin was an option (11:36). In Kyiv,
  there is little expectation of a breakthrough with Russia, but high hopes that
  Trump’s tougher rhethoric on Moscow could lead to a change in the way the US
  supports Ukraine (13:34). However, senior Ukrainian administration officials
  also continued to call for direct talks between Ukrainian president Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy and Russia’s Putin (16:46). Elsewhere, Lithuania’s finance minister
  Rimantas Šadžius has been appointed as acting prime minister until a new
  cabinet has been sworn in, stepping into the role after the resignation of
  Gintautas Paluckas (15:51). Eurostar services to and from Paris were hit by
  delays and cancellations after a power outage near Moussy, north of Paris,
  affecting also travellers in London (12:06). And that’s all from me, Jakub
  Krupa, for today. If you have any tips, comments or suggestions, email me at
  jakub.krupa@theguardian.com. I am also on Bluesky at @jakubkrupa.bsky.social
  and on X at @jakubkrupa. In a sign of growing tensions over Russia’s
  continuing refusal to move on Ukraine, US president Donald Trump has just
  announced that the US would “substantially raise the tariff paid by India to
  the US” in retaliation for its continuing purchases of Russian oil. He said:
  “India is not only buying massive amounts of Russian Oil, they are then, for
  much of the Oil purchased, selling it on the Open Market for big profits. They
  don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War
  Machine. Because of this, I will be substantially raising the Tariff paid by
  India to the USA. Thank you for your attention to this matter!!! President
  DJT” Andriy Yermak, most senior aide to Ukrainian president Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy, once again called out what he claimed was a Russian tactic to delay
  any meaningful talks on ceasefire as he pushed for direct negotiations between
  Zelenskyy and Russia’s Putin. In a post on Telegram, he criticised the lack of
  specifics in Russian comments on further talks, stressing that “Ukraine’s
  position is clear: we are ready for a meeting of leaders.” “Our partners, all
  those who truly value peace, support Ukraine’s position that a meeting of
  leaders must take place,” he said. He pointedly thanked US president Donald
  Trump for his “consistent” efforts to end the war, saying that Russian
  “endless [responses] ‘we do not rule this out’ without a specific date are
  unacceptable.” Back to Ukraine, the country’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy
  said he visited Ukrainian troops on the frontline near Vovchansk in Kharkiv
  region. He said they spoke about “the situation on the frontline, the defence
  of Vovchansk, the dynamics of the battle,” and the state of play with drones
  and financing available to soldiers. He said that Ukrainian troops were seeing
  foreign mercenaries from China, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan and African
  countries taking part on the Russian side. “We will respond,” he said.
  Lithuania’s finance minister Rimantas Šadžius has been appointed as acting
  prime minister until a new cabinet has been sworn in, stepping into the role
  after the resignation of Gintautas Paluckas. Paluckas faced growing scrutiny
  of his business dealings (covered on Europe Live) and eventually announced his
  intention to step down last week, formally tendering the resignation on
  Monday. 64-year-old Šadžius has served as Lithuania’s finance minister since
  December last year, and held the role twice before, from 2007 to 2008 and 2012
  to 2016. Between 2016 and 2025, he was a member of the European Court of
  Auditors. Paluckas’ Social Democrats are expected to pick their preferred
  long-term candidate for the job later this week, Lithuanian broadcaster LRT
  reported. Reuters noted that lacking an overall majority, any successful
  candidate for prime minister will need to seek the support of their coalition
  partners, centre-left For Lithuania and populist Nemunas Dawn, which often
  disagree with each other. The country’s parliament, which must approve the
  selection of the new prime minister, is due to next meet on 10 September after
  its summer recess. Ukrainian authorities have charges six people including a
  lawmaker and a government official for embezzling funds in the purchase of
  drones and jamming equipment for the military, Reuters reported.
  Anti-corruption authorities said on Saturday they had uncovered a scheme
  involving the legislator, one current and one now sacked official, a National
  Guard commander and two businessmen, giving kickbacks for purchases at
  inflated prices. “In 2024-2025, an organised criminal group systematically
  misappropriated funds allocated by local authorities for defence needs,” the
  National Anti-Corruption Bureau said in a statement quoted by Reuters, adding
  the bribes totalled around 30% of the contracts’ value. The drone contract was
  worth $240,000 with an inflation of about $80,000, the bureau said. Reuters
  noted that none of the suspects were publicly identified by the authorities.
  The Security Service of Ukraine, or SBU, claimed its counterintelligence
  agents foiled a Russian-inspired terrorist attack on Dnipro, saying a
  29-year-old woman was recruited on Telegram to plant an improvised explosive
  device near a government building. In a post on Telegram, the SBU said it
  disarmed the explosive device and arrested the suspect as she attempted to
  flee to Odesa. The suspect could face up to 12 years in prison, the agency
  said. in Kyiv In Kyiv, there is little expectation that Witkoff will make a
  breakthrough with Putin, but a hope that Trump’s changed rhetoric and tougher
  stance on Moscow may lead to a real change in US support for Ukraine. Mykhailo
  Podolyak, an aide to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said if Russia did not change its
  course by Friday, Kyiv would expect the “irreversible logistics” of secondary
  sanctions on Russian oil exports to be set in motion. “After that he’ll look
  whether this is helping to bring about the end of the war or not, and if not
  then he will move to the next step,” said Podolyak, in an interview in Kyiv.
  The next move, he said, could be further sanctions, and the increased
  militarisation of Ukraine. “Trump has already said he’s ready to sell Europe
  as much weapons as they want [to pass to Ukraine]. Before he didn’t say that …
  This is already a different conception of the world,” he said. Before that,
  though, all eyes will be on Witkoff’s visit to Moscow. On previous trips, he
  has held long one-on-one meetings with Putin and has spoken of his warm
  feelings for the Russian leader. On one occasion Putin gifted him an oil
  painting of Trump, on another, Witkoff arrived without an interpreter and used
  a Kremlin-provided translator. The camaraderie has left both Kyiv and other US
  allies wondering whether Witkoff is capable of delivering harsh messages to
  Moscow, although his visit this week will be the first since Trump’s rhetoric
  on Ukraine became noticeably harsher. US special envoy Steve Witkoff’s visit
  to Moscow is now expected to take place on Wednesday, Tass news agency
  reported citing sources. The latest deadline, set by US president Donald
  Trump, requiring Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face sanctions is set to
  expire on Friday. The Security Service of Ukraine, SBU, said it struck five
  Russian fighter jets at the Saky airfield in the Russian-occupied Crimea,
  claiming one aircraft was “completely destroyed.” In a post on Telegram, it
  said that a Russian aviation weapons depot was also hit, with estimated
  Russian losses in tens of millions of dollars. “The successful special
  operation of the SBU in Saky is another step towards weakening the enemy’s
  ability to wage a war of aggression against Ukraine. The occupiers must
  remember that they will never feel safe on our land!,” it said. Eurostar has
  just put out a note “strongly” advising customers to postpone their journey to
  and from Paris to a different date if possible due to “severe disruptions
  including cancellations” expected as a result of part of the track being
  closed in France. In a statement, it said: “Due to part of the track being
  temporarily closed on the French network, severe disruptions including
  cancellations are expected all day to and from Paris. We strongly advise all
  our passengers to postpone their journey to a different date.” Live updates
  show disruptions to trains connecting London and Paris throughout the day,
  with multiple delays and cancellations. The disruption is caused by a power
  outage near Moussy, 50 km north of Paris, on a high speed line between Paris
  Nord and Arras with “major repairs” required, France’s railway company SNCF
  said on its website. A Eurostar spokesperson quoted by Reuters said that the
  London-Amsterdam, London-Brussels and Brussels-Amsterdam routes were
  unaffected by the disruption in France. Kremlin’s Peskov also said that it was
  looking forward to US envoy Witkoff’s visit later this week, considering it
  “important, substantial and helpful.” Peskov told reporters that a meeting
  with president Vladimir Putin was an option, as the pair met multiple times in
  the past. And we now have a first public reaction from the Kremlin to Trump’s
  announcement on nuclear submarines (9:39), with spokesperson Dmitry Peskov
  saying Russia had no desire to get into a polemic with Trump on the issue,
  Reuters reported. He also played down the significance of Trump’s comments,
  saying it was clear that US submarines were already on combat duty anyway.
  “Russia is very attentive to the topic of nuclear non-proliferation. And we
  believe that everyone should be very, very cautious with nuclear rhetoric,”
  Peskov said, quoted by AFP. in Kyiv Once a decade, Ukraine has a moment in
  which street protests redefine the country’s political direction. The Orange
  revolution of 2004; the Maidan revolution of 2014; and now, over the past 10
  days, the first major wave of protest since the start of Russia’s full-scale
  invasion. A series of unexpectedly boisterous and well-attended demonstrations
  forced Volodymyr Zelenskyy to execute a swift U-turn on his decision to scrap
  the independence of two anti-corruption bodies. On Thursday, MPs reversed the
  contentious changes they had adopted a week previously. Outside the parliament
  building, crowds whooped and cheered as the result of the vote was announced.
  The size, scope and demands of this latest protest movement have been much
  more modest than those of its revolutionary predecessors, but the spectacle
  has been no less remarkable, given the context of full-scale war in which it
  has taken place. Over the last week, a lot of attention focused on Zelenskyy’s
  rushed U-turn on his anti-corruption law reform. Shaun Walker in Kyiv spoke to
  people taking part in these protests and their motivation behind them. Let me
  bring you his report with great photographs by Jędrzej Nowicki. Over the
  weekend, Zelenskyy also said that Ukraine and Russia were preparing a prisoner
  exchange that would see 1,200 Ukrainian troops return home, following talks in
  Istanbul in July. His comments came after an overnight Ukrainian drone attack
  on an oil depot near the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi ignited a raging
  fire, as the two countries traded strikes at the end of one of the deadliest
  weeks in Ukraine in recent months. President Zelenskyy also called for more
  pressure on Russia, as he posted a video of drone strikes on what he said were
  first responders and medics arriving to help after attacks. “Deliberate FPV
  [first person view] drone strikes on first responders and medics arriving to
  help after attacks – all of this is typical for every city or community within
  reach of Russian drones. The Russian army simply kills everything that is
  alive,” he warned. Zelenskyy said that “the world has enough power to stop
  this and protect people.” He added: “We count on strong decisions from the
  United States, Europe, and the world regarding secondary sanctions on Russian
  energy trade and Moscow’s banking sector. Ukraine looks forward to the
  implementation of every agreement on strengthening defense that has been
  reached with its partners. Every day of delay results in the loss of our
  people.” Andriy Yermak, the most senior aide to Ukraine’s president Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy, seemingly enjoys the silence from Russia following Donald Trump’s
  decision to move two nuclear submarines in response to provocative comments
  from the country’s former president, Dmitry Medvedev. “The moment American
  nuclear submarines appeared, … [he] suddenly went silent. Russia understands
  only one thing: strength,” he said. Expect Kyiv to keep making similar
  representations this week, before US special envoy Steve Witkoff visits Russia
  “Wednesday or Thursday” for further talks ahead of Trump’s 8 August deadline
  for a ceasefire in Ukraine. On Friday, there were no signs that Vladimir Putin
  was willing to change his mind, as he repeated that the Russian “conditions
  certainly remain the same,” even as he claimed that he nominally supported “a
  lasting and stable peace.” With things getting quiet elsewhere as we hit peak
  holiday season, this could be the main focus this week. I will bring you all
  key updates from across Europe here. It’s Monday, 4 August 2025, it’s Jakub
  Krupa here, and this is Europe Live. Good morning.
