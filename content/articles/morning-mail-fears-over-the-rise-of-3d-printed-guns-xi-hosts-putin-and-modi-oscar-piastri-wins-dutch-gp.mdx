  Good morning. Australia’s gun controls are increasingly under pressure from
  3D-printed firearms, as authorities struggle to combat the rise of these often
  untraceable, lethal weapons. Meanwhile, the US and other western powers have
  been left on the sidelines as China hosts world leaders including Vladimir
  Putin and Narendra Modi at a diplomatic summit in Tianjin. And: Oscar Piastri
  has won the Dutch F1 Grand Prix with a dominant drive from pole position to
  open up a gap at the top of the title standings. Australia Anti-immigration
  rallies | A neo-Nazi was among the speakers at a tense anti-immigration
  protest in Melbourne, as events under the March for Australia banner took
  place across the country on Sunday. In Melbourne, police pepper-sprayed
  participants in a counter-protest. Social media | The official trial of age
  assurance technologies that could be used to keep Australian under 16s off
  social media has found that some errors were “inevitable” in the system. On
  the line | Advocates say NSW prison phone call costs risk isolating inmates
  further, and could lead to more problems on release. They’re now calling for
  all phone calls to be made free for inmates. 3D-printed guns threat | As
  police investigate whether alleged Porepunkah killer Dezi Freeman owned
  homemade firearms, experts say the laws on privately manufactured guns are a
  “dog’s breakfast”. Short-stay subsidies | Tax breaks for investors using
  houses as short-stay accommodation could be costing the nation hundreds of
  millions of dollars each year, according to a new report. World Gaza crisis |
  Israeli airstrikes and gunfire killed at least 30 people in and around Gaza
  City, local health authorities said, as a 20-boat humanitarian aid flotilla
  carrying activists including Greta Thunberg set sail from Barcelona for the
  stricken territory. China summit | Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin have met for
  talks at a showpiece summit in China that seeks to challenge US-led,
  western-dominated blocs and is being attended by the leaders of more than two
  dozen nations. Yemen tensions rise | Following the Israeli killing of Yemen’s
  prime minister, the Iranian-backed Houthis have detained at least 11 UN
  workers after raids in Sana’a, officials said. Health breakthrough |
  Researchers have found a drug that is better than aspirin at preventing heart
  attacks and strokes, in a discovery that could transform health guidelines
  worldwide. ‘NO EXCEPTIONS!’ | Donald Trump has said he will issue an executive
  order to mandate voter identification for all US elections, a move likely to
  be challenged in court as unconstitutional. Full Story Is it depression or an
  iron deficiency? Treating an iron deficiency can be elusive and frustrating.
  That’s particularly true for women who may have been misdiagnosed with
  depression and other chronic illnesses, until those low iron levels are
  finally picked up. Reged Ahmad speaks with Natasha May about why so many women
  have to wait years to find out what’s wrong, and whether a new test could be
  the solution. In-depth Since the algal bloom hit South Australia’s beaches,
  hundreds of citizen scientists have banded together to track the effects.
  Using the iNaturalist app, they have collectively logged a grim tally of dead
  sea life. As Tory Shepherd finds out, their work has impressed the experts –
  and helped to fill the knowledge gap left by a slower official response to the
  bloom. Not the news Within six months of forming in high school in Byron Bay
