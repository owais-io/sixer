  Kemi Badenoch has said she no longer considers herself Nigerian and does not
  possess a Nigerian passport. The Conservative party leader, who was born in
  London, but grew up in Nigeria and the US and did not return to the UK until
  she was 16, said she had not renewed her Nigerian passport in two decades.
  Speaking to the Rosebud podcast, Badenoch said: “I’m Nigerian through
  ancestry, by birth, despite not being born there because of my parents, but by
  identity I’m not really. I know the country very well, I have a lot of family
  there, and I’m very interested in what happens there. “But home is where my
  now family is, and my now family is my children, it’s my husband and my
  brother and his children, in-laws. The Conservative party is very much part of
  my family, my extended family, I call it.” In 1980 Badenoch was among the last
  people to automatically receive British citizenship because she was born in
  the UK. Margaret Thatcher abolished birthright citizenship the following year.
  “Finding out that I did have that British citizenship was a marvel to so many
  of my contemporaries, so many of my peers,” she said. “I think the reason that
  I came back here was actually a very sad one, and it was that my parents
  thought: ‘There is no future for you in this country.’” She recalled “never
  quite feeling that I belonged there”. The future Tory leader moved back to the
  UK aged 16 to live with a friend of her mother because of the worsening
  political and economic situation in Nigeria, and to study for her A-levels.
  When Badenoch’s father, Femi Adegoke, who was a doctor, died in Nigeria in
  2022 she obtained a visa to travel there, which she described as a “big
  fandango”. She has on occasion clashed with the Nigerian government. Last year
  the country’s vice-president, Kashim Shettima, suggested she could “remove the
  Kemi from her name” if she was not proud of her “nation of origin”. It is
  unclear what promoted Shettima’s remarks but Badenoch has frequently spoken
  about corruption in Nigeria and growing up with a sense of fear and
  insecurity. The Tory leader told the podcast she had not experienced racial
  prejudice in Britain “in any meaningful form”. “I knew I was going to a place
  where I would look different to everybody, and I didn’t think that that was
  odd,” she said. “What I found actually quite interesting was that people
  didn’t treat me differently, and it’s why I’m so quick to defend the UK
  whenever there are accusations of racism.”
