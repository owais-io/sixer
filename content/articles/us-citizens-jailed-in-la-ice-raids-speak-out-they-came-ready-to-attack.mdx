  As two masked men dragged her into an unmarked SUV, Andrea Velez tried to
  focus on details she might later remember – one man’s red shirt, the car’s
  leather seats, a black backpack inside. At 9.20am on 24 June in downtown Los
  Angeles, the 32-year-old was heading into work at a footwear company when the
  men in gaiter masks jumped out of their car and started chasing vendors and
  other people on the street, she recalled. As people fled, Velez froze and held
  on to her bag. Suddenly, she recalled, one of the men slammed her to the
  ground and placed her into his car. The men had “Police” vests, but otherwise
  were in plainclothes and didn’t identify themselves. She didn’t know why they
  had taken her. The men, it turned out, were Immigration and Customs
  Enforcement (Ice) deportation officers. They were looking to question people
  about “whether they were lawfully present” in the US, an agent later wrote.
  Velez is a US citizen who grew up in downtown, not far from the incident.
  “They just came out ready to attack anyone,” said Velez, in her first
  interview since her arrest. “I thought they were kidnapping me.” A day after
  her arrest, the Department of Justice charged Velez with assaulting an
  officer, which could carry a 20-year sentence. The claim was shocking to
  Velez, who is 4ft 11in and said she had not laid hands on anyone. She is one
  of many southern California residents swept up as the Trump administration has
  aggressively jailed and prosecuted protesters, as well as civilians who film
  and object to Ice arrests and bystanders caught up in haphazard raids. Ice
  detained more than 2,000 immigrants in the region in June. Bill Essayli, the
  Trump-appointed US attorney for the region, has prosecuted at least 18 people
  on claims they interfered with immigration arrests, with most defendants
  accused of assault. Prosecutors have been forced to dismiss at least five of
  those felony cases, including the one against Velez. The Guardian revealed
  last week that the justice department also dropped felony assault cases
  against four anti-Ice demonstrators after officers made false and misleading
  statements about events captured on film. ‘She was just standing there’ Before
  her arrest, Velez was not protesting against Ice – she was simply in the wrong
  place at the wrong time, she said. The graduate of the local Cal Poly Pomona
  university and lifelong LA resident said her mother and sister had dropped her
  off by her office just as Ice officers arrived at the intersection. After she
  was forced into the Ice agents’ car, she spotted Los Angeles police department
  (LAPD) officers, left the vehicle and ran toward them, she said: “I thought
  they would help me.” She told an LAPD officer she thought the men were
  kidnapping her: “If I did something wrong, I’d rather have you arrest me. I
  trust people with uniforms.” Bystander footage taken from a nearby building
  shows what happened next: an LAPD officer holds on to Velez as one of the Ice
  agents runs up and handcuffs her. She does not appear to resist, but the Ice
  officer picks her up and carries her off the ground across the street. In
  another clip, a witness is heard saying, “This girl was just standing there …
  they are causing chaos.” A third video shows LAPD shielding the Ice officers
  from civilians filming and protesting about her arrest. Velez is seen trying
  to give her mother’s phone number to a bystander. She later learned her mother
  and 17-year-old sister had witnessed the incident, but felt powerless to
  intervene. Back in the Ice agents’ car, Velez said the officer driving
  appeared furious about how the incident had played out: “He was screaming in
  rage.” She overheard him on the phone discussing “how many bodies they had
  gotten”, she said, and referring to her as an “alleged US citizen”. ‘They make
  it seem like we’re … criminals’ Velez and Luis Hipolito, a 23-year-old man
  later charged as her co-defendant, were taken to a parking structure. Video of
  Hipolito’s arrest later published by the LA Times showed four agents had
  aggressively detained him by piling on top of him and using pepper spray. As
  the two waited to be processed, Velez said she saw his face was swollen, he
  was having trouble seeing, his shirt was bloody and he appeared to be
  convulsing and hyperventilating. His requests for medical attention were
  initially denied, she said: “He was in pain, but they were like: ‘It’s no big
  deal, you will get over it.’” Even as he struggled, he tried to comfort her:
  “He was making me feel safe.” Eventually, he was taken away in an ambulance,
  she said. Meanwhile, she saw ambulances going in and out of the federal jail
  nearby, which frightened her. She said officers later forced her to pose for a
  photo where several of them stood in a line holding her with their backs to
  the camera, an unusual mugshot setup that has since become commonplace for DHS
  press releases and X.com posts: “They make it seem like we’re really bad
  criminals, the worst of the worst, when we’re just regular people.” Velez was
  placed in the Metropolitan detention center, the downtown federal jail that
  has become the site of protests. There, other incarcerated women took care of
  her. Staff did not give her water and she learned from other residents that
  she had to buy a cup, but having been detained just hours before, she had no
  money on her account. She also couldn’t buy utensils to eat. One woman on her
  way out donated her cup and spork to Velez. After two nights in jail, she was
  brought to court on assault charges. In an affidavit filed by the justice
  department, Joseph Arko, an agent working for a homeland security taskforce
  investigating “immigration crimes”, said the Ice officers had stopped in
  downtown to “question two individuals about whether they were lawfully
  present” in the US. As one individual fled, one of the officers alleged Velez
  “stepp[ed] into his path and extend[ed] one of her arms in an apparent effort
  to prevent him from apprehending the male”, Arko summarized. The officer
  claimed she was so “abrupt”, “he could not stop his momentum” and her arm
  “struck” him in the face. Velez was stunned to read the allegations: “I never
  hit anyone. I’ve never hurt anybody, ever. Everyone who knows me knows the
  kind of person I am. I’m quiet, reserved, always doing the right thing, always
  following rules.” Sixteen days after her arrest, the justice department moved
  to dismiss the charges against her. Velez’s lawyer, Diane Bass, said she had
  requested body-worn footage and witness statements before the dismissal: “I
  never got them. That tells me they did not have the evidence they needed and
  this was a false and unlawful arrest. It is a shocking and disgusting travesty
  of justice, and no human, never mind an American citizen, should ever be
  treated like that.” The justice department, US attorney’s office, Ice and the
  DHS did not respond to detailed inquiries about Velez’s case. A spokesperson
  for the bureau of prisons, which runs the jail, did not respond to questions
  about her account, saying in an email its mission is to “operate facilities
  that are safe, secure, and humane”. The LAPD said in a statement after Velez’s
  arrest that officers initially responded to the area due to 911 calls about a
  “possible kidnapping” and that it was “not involved” in her detention. The
  department said its role on scene was “maintaining order”, and a spokesperson
  last week declined to comment further on her case, pointing to an earlier
  statement saying the LAPD was “not involved in civil immigration enforcement”.
  Other detained citizens are still fighting their charges, including Hipolito,
  whose attorney did not respond to requests for comment. ‘What they were doing
  was wrong’ Adrian Martinez, 20, was jailed on 17 June while immigration
  officers were conducting “roving patrol duties” in Pico Rivera, a 90% Latino
  city in south-east LA. On break outside his job at Walmart, he saw border
  patrol agents moving to detain an older janitor. The agents, records showed,
  targeted the custodial worker after he started running away from them. Witness
  footage shows a masked, plainclothes officer with an assault rifle shoving
  Martinez, who is heard saying the man they are detaining is a “hard worker”.
  At least five officers end up pushing Martinez to the ground and grabbing him
  by the neck as they force him into their car, the footage shows. Essayli, the
  US attorney, posted Martinez’s photo on social media the following day, saying
  he was arrested for “punching a border patrol agent in the face”. The footage
  does not show him punching an officer. Essayli’s office did not, however,
  charge Martinez with assault, but rather “conspiracy to impede a federal
  officer”. The justice department complaint included no reference to punching.
  Still, Greg Bovino, border patrol chief for parts of southern California,
  falsely claimed on X.com that Martinez “caught a federal case for assault”.
  Essayli’s office did not respond to inquiries about Martinez’s case. “I just
  wanted to speak up for that guy, it was not right, it was like they were
  kidnapping him,” Martinez told the Guardian. “What they were doing was wrong.
  They were bothering a poor old man who was just working … I was just using
  words and they started attacking me.” Martinez was taken to a parking
  structure by the federal jail where, he said, he was held for hours. Officers
  would not let him call his mother, he said. “They were not believing me when I
  said I was a US citizen.” He said he was most worried about his family not
  knowing his whereabouts and anxious about his father’s car, which he left at
  work. When officers interrogated him at the parking structure, they tried to
  get him to admit to assault, he said. “I never put my hands on anybody. Why is
  my own government lying saying I tried to assault someone? It’s scary.”
  Martinez’s knee, shoulders and back were injured and bruised from the arrest,
  made worse by sleeping on a metal bed in jail for three days, he added. Weeks
  after the incident, KCAL News reported that one of the border patrol agents
  involved in Martinez’s arrest, Isaiah Hodgson, had himself been arrested. The
  LA district attorney said on 7 July that Hodgson, 29, was off-duty and
  intoxicated at a restaurant when he entered a woman’s bathroom and then
  refused to leave the business when security told him guns were not allowed on
  the property. He was charged with several crimes, including resisting arrest,
  felony battery of an officer and exhibiting a firearm in public. Martinez’s
  attorneys said they were still investigating Hodgson’s exact involvement in
  Martinez’s arrest. “I don’t wish bad on him and I pray for his family,”
  Martinez said of the border patrol agent’s arrest. “But it just shows their
  abuse of power. He felt like he had a right to have his firearm in a
  restaurant while he’s not even on duty.” Jaime Ruiz, a border patrol
  spokesperson, said the agency does not comment on pending litigation.
  Hodgson’s attorneys did not respond to inquiries. Ciaran McEvoy, a US
  attorney’s office spokesperson, pointed to an X.com post from Essayli
  defending the “great work being done by our amazing federal prosecutors”. His
  office has filed more than 50 criminal complaints since early June against
  people accused of assaulting or interfering with immigration officers, and
  nine of those people have since been indicted by grand juries, Essayli wrote.
  McEvoy declined to provide a full list of the cases. Essayli’s post added:
  “When there are reactive arrests, like we had during the riots, it’s not
  uncommon for a complaint to be dismissed so that law enforcement can conduct
  additional investigation and collect more evidence.” The US attorney general,
  Pam Bondi, defended Essayli in a statement, calling him a “friend” and
  “champion for law and order who has done superlative work to prosecute
  rioters” in LA. And Tricia McLaughlin, DHS assistant secretary, added in an
  email: “Our agents, officers, and prosecutors will continue to work together
  to keep Americans safe, and we will follow the facts, evidence, and law.” ‘I
  don’t feel safe’ Even though Martinez never faced assault charges, Walmart
  terminated him after his arrest, citing “gross misconduct”, records show. He
  has remained out of work and anxious about his future while the charges loom.
  Walmart declined to comment. He had hoped to get his truck driving license,
  but now is unsure if he can. Garrett Miller, one of his attorneys, condemned
  the US attorney and border patrol officials for making false punching
  allegations about Martinez and never correcting them: “They used their
  platforms for political gain, at Adrian’s expense, and he lost his job because
  of it.” Injuries sustained during his arrest forced Martinez to wear a leg
  brace for weeks after and he still has pain when he walks, he says. Despite
  the government crackdown, he said he hoped people continue to “speak out when
  something is not right”. After her charges were dismissed, Velez felt some
  relief, but she said she was still riddled with fear that Ice could target
  her. She was also shaken by images of the vendors and workers who she saw
  being detained for deportation: “These were people just heading into work,
  going about their days. We don’t know where they were being taken, and it just
  broke my heart that they may never see their families again.” Velez has been
  working remotely since her arrest, terrified of returning to downtown. She
  does virtual therapy, no longer goes on morning runs and never leaves home by
  herself: “I don’t feel safe knowing they can randomly attack and take you.”
