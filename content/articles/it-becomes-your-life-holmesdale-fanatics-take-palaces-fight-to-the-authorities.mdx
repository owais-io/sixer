  When the Holmesdale Fanatics say they are planning something, it is usually
  worth paying attention. The receptionist at Uefa’s headquarters in Nyon looked
  bemused when presented with a suitcase full of fake bank notes last month by
  members of the Crystal Palace supporters’ group. They claimed it represented
  the “contradictions of their supposed ‘fundamental values’ of integrity and
  fairness and the reality of their business methods and general conduct”. Uefa
  has said it followed the correct procedures after its club financial control
  body demoted Palace from the Europa League to the Conference League because
  they were deemed to have broken multi-club ownership rules. But for the HF, it
  was a call to arms. “For a situation like this, where we and our family
  members feel there is something unjust happening to the club, we have to act
  quickly,” says Mickey Grafton, a founder member who also helped organise a
  protest outside Selhurst Park a week earlier attended by hundreds of fans. An
  HF delegation, having also delivered a letter to Uefa’s president, Aleksander
  Ceferin, demanding the club’s reinstatement into the Europa League, headed to
  the headquarters of the court of arbitration for sport in Lausanne, where
  Palace’s appeal against their demotion will be heard on Friday. The result is
  due the following Monday. “The protests against those responsible will
  continue,” the HF said. Palace have been drawn to play in the Conference
  League playoff round against the losers of the Europa League tie between
  Fredrikstad of Norway and Denmark’s Midtjylland, with the first leg scheduled
  for Selhurst Park on 21 August. Officially formed in 2005, the HF has grown
  into one of most influential supporters’ groups in the country after playing a
  leading role in protests outside the headquarters of Lloyds Bank in 2010 when
  Palace were facing liquidation after being placed in administration. The
  hand-painted tifos they produced for last season’s FA Cup semi-final against
  Aston Villa and the final against Manchester City – which it proudly
  emphasised involved at least 120 group members and were funded by fans –
  caught the eye of the wider football world. One depicted two young supporters
  celebrating a Darren Ambrose winner at Old Trafford in 2011 with their late
  father and the message: “Wembley will shake and it will be beautiful”. Anyone
  who has attended a Palace game at Selhurst Park or on the road in recent years
  will attest to the frenzied atmosphere created by the black-shirted group, who
  are not afraid to do things differently and take their inspiration from
  Europe’s ‘Ultra’ culture. “It’s a huge collective – that’s what English
  football has lacked if you compare it to the rest of the continent and
  beyond,” Grafton says. “It doesn’t have organised fan groups and as a result
  fans lose out. If you have organisation, you can have unity and through unity
  you can stop things like this happening. You can stop injustices and you can
  stand up for the values that made football so attractive to people. [If]
  constant profit and greed is pushed above all else then you end up in the
  state of the game in England today, which is not pretty.” This takes a great
  deal of planning, with Grafton saying he and some of the group’s other main
  organisers are “very close to being sacked every day”. He says: “It comes at
  an expense. It becomes your life and you’re willing to do that for a football
  club because there are these values in modern life we think are worth
  preserving. They’re hard to find in modern life, let alone modern football.
  “We live in a individualistic infatuated modern world that’s materially rich
  and often quite socially poor. Themes like identity and belonging that so many
  people would find very normal around the world or in the past of this country
  are somewhat lacking. The football club and this group gives that in
  abundance. Those are partly our motivations.” Previous HF banners have
  criticised the Premier League’s decision to permit Saudi Arabia’s Public
  Investment fund to buy a majority stake in Newcastle and taken aim at the
  increasing number of early kick-offs. They have also never been afraid to call
  out issues on their own doorstep. In January 2023, when the then co-owner John
  Textor completed his purchase of Lyon – a move that appears to have cost
  Palace their place in the Europa League – a banner said: “Multi-club
  ownership. Stock market gambling. Textor, we don’t trust you”. “I would say
  that over the last 15 years, the Palace fanbase have gathered around issues of
  protest,” says Grafton. “The culture of Palace has changed. We’ve grown up
  with ideas about football as the group has grown. The social aspect around
  football is almost as important as football itself and if football loses that
  or it’s allowed to be discarded, then it’s just 11 blokes on each team kicking
  a ball around.” There has been little sign of other Premier League clubs
  following the HF’s example although there is an emerging Ultras scene in
  Scotland. “English football culture is stagnating,” says Grafton. “There’s
  nothing happening on the terraces and there hasn’t been for 25 years. It’s
  time for change. But it has to be grassroots-led. Too many teams in the
  Premier League are imitating it from a boardroom level – a COO will give the
  green light to a printed banner that gets put in the ground for them to hold
  up. What we do is totally different.”
