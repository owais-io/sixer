  A BBC Proms appearance featuring Finnish violinist, conductor and composer
  Pekka Kuusisto is never likely to be run-of-the-mill. His 2016 Proms debut
  culminated in a raw, vital performance of a Finnish folk song, introduced with
  the assurance of a professional standup comic and incorporating a full
  audience sing along. Since then there’s been virtuosic whistling and folk
  fiddling, a TV soundtrack and a collaboration with a neuropsychologist – as
  well as numerous concerto performances and a burgeoning conducting career. In
  the face of Kuusisto’s generous, voracious musicality, boundaries between
  “classical”, “folk” and “pop” disintegrate. On paper, his appearance at this
  year’s Proms promised peak Pekka. The first half featured Ume Sámi vocalist
  Katarina Barruk, mixing her songs inspired by the indigenous tradition of
  joiking in a language on Unesco’s most-endangered list with short, mostly
  minimalist works. The second juxtaposed performances of Arvo Pärt’s Fratres
  and Shostakovich’s Chamber Symphony by Kuusisto and the Norwegian Chamber
  Orchestra. “It’s definitely going to be a unique concert,” I heard a
  concertgoer reassure his friends as they surveyed a far-from-full Royal Albert
  Hall. And yes, Kuusisto walked on brandishing not one but two violins. Yes, he
  smiled winningly as Barruk keened and crooned into the microphone in a
  language never previously heard in the Albert Hall, accompanied by electric
  guitar, drum kit and amplified soft-rock strings. Yes, Kuusisto’s solo
  performance of Hannah Kendall’s miniature Weroon Weroon – its UK premiere –
  was mesmerising, overtones glinting over a harsh, gritty ground. Yes,
  different musical traditions blurred as if born to do so and, in the second
  half, Kuusisto had one of the world’s best chamber orchestras dancing in grey
  tartan kilts and blazers like escapers from a 1950s boarding school – all
  while playing Shostakovich’s Chamber Symphony from memory, its sharp edges
  chiselled to ferocity. And yet despite the theoretical genre-mixing and the
  symbolic significance of the Sámi joiking, the costumes and virtuosity, much
  of this programme ultimately sounded very similar: smooth, moderate, quiet,
  slow. Kuusisto’s encore was John Lennon’s Imagine, as he whistled and strummed
  his violin. “We have no words except peace and love,” he beamed, the evening’s
  gently pacifist subtext raised suddenly to the surface. • Listen again on BBC
  Sounds until 12 October. The Proms continue until 13 September
