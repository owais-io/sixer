  A few weeks ago, two groups of protesters gathered on the steps of the Senedd
  in Cardiff Bay. One demonstration was against the war in Gaza; the other,
  against the Welsh government’s two-year-old default 20mph speed limit in urban
  areas. The change from 30mph was brought in by the Welsh Labour government
  across about 35% of the country’s roads in September 2023, at a cost of £34m.
  The reduced speed limit applied to any built-up area, defined as roads where
  lamp-posts were no more than about 180 metres apart. Last week a small study
  by GoSafe, which monitors road cameras, found the policy had added an average
  of two minutes to journey times of differing lengths, aggravating an already
  bitter culture war over legislation designed to save lives. Collisions along
  roads that have changed from 30mph to 20mph decreased by 19% in 2024 compared
  with 2023, and 100 fewer people a year have been killed or badly hurt in road
  traffic accidents, according to Welsh government figures. Yet according to
  canvassing Senedd members and local councillors, the issue remains deeply
  unpopular with voters as the country’s embattled Labour administration gears
  up for elections next May. The former first minister Mark Drakeford, who
  spearheaded the policy, has previously said he was surprised at the level of
  opposition and anger the new limit provoked. The backlash included protests,
  defacing and knocking down new speed limit signs, and a petition signed by
  nearly half a million people opposing the policy – the largest in the Senedd’s
  history. Phil Jones, a chartered engineer and transport planning expert who
  chaired the Welsh government taskforce on establishing the 20mph default, said
  the policy was working “exactly as intended”. “There’s nothing preventing
  local authorities from putting the limit back up. We reviewed practices in
  other places, journey times, economic impact; none of this should be a
  surprise,” he said. “Say all the roads go back up and casualties go up again
  too. What is an acceptable death toll that justifies getting to work two
  minutes faster? That’s what people who want to get rid of it need to answer.”
  More than 130,000 drivers – or 34% of people with licences in Wales – have
  been caught breaking the lower limit since it was introduced, while the most
  recent YouGov polling, from a year ago, found seven in 10 people opposed the
  20mph default. The Welsh Conservatives have consistently called for the law to
  be scrapped over what the party says is the confusion and frustration it
  causes for drivers. Sam Rowlands, the shadow cabinet secretary for transport,
  said: “It’s a hard balance to strike but as a country we’ve been doing this
  risk assessment for decades, and we landed on 30mph. It’s a huge waste of
  taxpayer money.” Ken Skates, who took over as transport cabinet secretary in
  March 2024, was quickly forced into a partial climbdown, giving councils £5m
  to reassess local speed limits over what he described as “consistent”
  concerns. Last month, Wrexham began changing 52 roads back to 30mph. Newport
  council has named 14 roads where the speed limit will go up again, while in
  Blaneau Gwent one road has changed back, and in Ceredigion no changes are
  planned.
