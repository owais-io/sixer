  With Liverpool being heavily linked to a move for Alexander Isak, Arne Slot
  said the club would never hesitate to sign a quality player if the chance
  presents itself. The Premier League champions have already spent close to
  £300m this summer and are expected to bid for the Sweden striker. Liverpool
  are longstanding admirers of Isak and have funds available from the £65.5m
  sale of Luis Díaz to Bayern Munich. Isak is known to be keen on moving to
  Anfield and it was confirmed by Real Sociedad on Thursday that he is “working
  with his trainers” at the club’s Zubieta base after missing Newcastle’s tour
  of Asia. The 25-year-old has three years left on his contract and Newcastle
  would want £150m for their prized asset. Liverpool, it is believed, do not
  want to pay more than £120m. They will almost certainly have to break the
  British transfer record to get their man. “I always say, another thing about
  Liverpool is that if we see a chance in the market we never hesitate to bring
  someone in,” said Slot as Liverpool left Japan after their pre-season tour of
  the far east. “It’s about quality and we have already made some very good
  signings.” This summer Liverpool have brought in Florian Wirtz and Jeremie
  Frimpong from Bayer Leverkusen, the former for a club-record £100m, as well as
  Milos Kerkez from Bournemouth, Hugo Ekitiké from Eintracht Frankfurt and the
  goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili from Valencia. “It’s the way this club has
  worked over several years: targeting a specific player who we think can
  strengthen the squad and can bring us quality,” said Slot. “Then we try to
  bring him in. “We do spend, but if we spend, then we always need to recoup
  some money.” Díaz’s move to Germany means Liverpool have raised more than
  £190m from player sales since Richard Hughes became sporting director in June
  2024.
