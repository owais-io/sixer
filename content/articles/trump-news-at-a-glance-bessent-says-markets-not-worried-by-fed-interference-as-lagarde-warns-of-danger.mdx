  US treasury secretary Scott Bessent has said the Federal Reserve is and should
  be independent but that it had “made a lot of mistakes”, as he defended Donald
  Trump’s right to fire the central bank governor Lisa Cook. The president has
  criticised the Fed and its chair, Jerome Powell, for months for not lowering
  interest rates. Independent central banks are widely seen as crucial to a
  stable global financial system. Bessent also rejected the idea that markets
  were disturbed by the Trump administration’s actions. “S&amp;P’s at a new high
  and bond yields are fine, so we haven’t seen anything yet,” he said. Bessent’s
  comments come as Christine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank
  (ECB), said Trump undermining the independence of the world’s most powerful
  central bank could pose a “very serious danger” for the world economy. Trump’s
  war on Fed is ‘serious danger’ to world economy, says ECB head Lagarde, who
  was France’s finance minister until 2011 before leaving to run the
  International Monetary Fund, said it would be “very difficult” for Trump to
  take control of Fed decision-making on interest rates, but such a scenario
  would be highly dangerous. “If US monetary policy were no longer independent
  and instead dependent on the dictates of this or that person, then I believe
  that the effect on the balance of the American economy could – as a result of
  the effects this would have around the world – be very worrying, because it is
  the largest economy in the world,” she said, according to remarks reported by
  Reuters. Read the full story Guatemala says it is willing to receive hundreds
  of deported children from US Guatemala is ready and willing to receive about
  150 unaccompanied children of all ages each week from the US, the country’s
  president has said, a day after a US federal judge halted the deportation of
  10 Guatemalan children. Those children had already boarded a plane when a
  court responded to an emergency appeal on Sunday. They were later returned to
  the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement. On Monday, Guatemala’s
  president, Bernardo Arévalo, told journalists that his government had been
  coordinating with the US to receive the unaccompanied minors. Read the full
  story Former CDC leaders slam RFK Jr for endangering Americans’ health Nine
  former officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have said
  that Robert F Kennedy Jr’s leadership of the US health and human services
  department is “unlike anything our country has ever experienced” and
  “unacceptable”. They also warned that Kennedy’s leadership “should alarm every
  American, regardless of political leanings”. Read the full story Trump says he
  will award Rudy Giuliani the Presidential Medal of Freedom The president said
  Monday he would award Rudy Giuliani the nation’s highest civilian honour, the
  Presidential Medal of Freedom, two days after his longtime political ally was
  seriously injured in a car crash. The decision places the award on a man once
  lauded for leading New York after the 11 September 2001 attacks and later
  sanctioned by courts and disbarred for amplifying false claims about the 2020
  US presidential election. Giuliani, the former New York mayor, was also
  criminally charged in two states; he has denied wrongdoing. Read the full
  story Hundreds of ‘workers over billionaires’ Labor Day rallies take place
  across US Hundreds of protests organised as part of the national “workers over
  billionaires” effort – a mass action calling for the protection of social
  safety – were held in cities large and small across the country, including New
  York, Houston, Washington DC and Los Angeles. As the Labor Day rallies took
  place, Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson sharply denounced the Trump
  administration’s threat to deploy federal troops to the city as part of an
  immigration crackdown. Read the full story What else happened today: For this
  Labor Day, the Trump administration has draped an enormous banner outside the
  US labor department with his portrait and the words “American Workers First”.
  But many labor advocates say Trump has consistently put corporate interests
  first in his second term as he has taken dozens of actions that hurt workers.
  Catching up? Here’s what happened on 31 August 2025.
