  The Australian government has pledged to recognise a Palestinian state. The
  prime minister, Anthony Albanese, says the decision is “predicated” on
  commitments from the Palestinian Authority’s (PA) Mahmoud Abbas, who has said
  his group will undergo critical governance reforms, and that a future state
  will have no room for members of the terrorist group Hamas. But Albanese’s
  government won’t say what would happen if those commitments are missed. Here
  are the key questions about the recognition discussion. What are the
  conditions of Australia’s recognition of Palestine? Albanese says Abbas has
  made pledges including: A demilitarised Palestine. Recognising Israel’s right
  to exist in peace and security. The Palestinian Authority holding elections
  and undertaking governance reforms, including education system reforms to not
  promote further violence. No role for Hamas. Will the conditions be met?
  Shahram Akbarzadeh, a professor of Middle East politics at Deakin University,
  says the PA commitments raise “lots of challenges”. He describes the PA as
  “rife with corruption and nepotism” but says there is no other body which
  could begin processes towards Palestinian statehood. It is vital then,
  Akbarzadeh says, that western nations – likely led by the EU, UN and ideally
  the US – help lead democratic and governance reforms in the PA. “All of this
  requires and calls for sustained international engagement and investment –
  funds and expertise,” he says. “If the international community wants to see a
  viable new state emerge, there needs to be support for it. You can’t just
  issue a declaration and walk out the door.” Sussan Ley, the opposition leader,
  claims Albanese is skating over the issue. “He actually refuses to say what
  will happen if the conditions that he sets out for recognition are not met,”
  she told the Sydney radio station 2GB. How can Hamas be banned from a future
  Palestinian state? Akbarzadeh says barring Hamas from a future governing role
  is “widely accepted” by Arab leaders, but the “practicalities” are difficult.
  “That’s going to be a much harder proposition than disarming Hamas … it will
  involve a lengthy process of checks and balances,” Akbarzadeh says. He
  questions whether the ban would extend to people in Gaza who were forced to
  affiliate with members of Hamas, as the ruling party in the territory.
  “Affiliation with Hamas during that time doesn’t mean necessarily they’re all
  terrorists. Everyone in Gaza had some sort of affiliation with Hamas, as a
  necessity of life. It adds another layer of complication,” he says. Amal
  Naser, of the Palestine Action Group, told Channel Nine: “I don’t think it’s
  very plausible” Hamas could be blocked from a future Palestinian state. “But
  the key issue here is that western states can’t be determining who is in
  governance in Palestine, but they do have an obligation to prevent and punish
  this genocide,” she said. Albanese told Channel Nine the international
  community could stop Hamas members from running for elections – but did not
  say exactly how. “You can [stop Hamas] if you have the Arab states in the
  Middle East all speaking as one as well as the Palestinian Authority as well
  as the international community.” Albanese has repeatedly said recognition is a
  chance to “isolate Hamas” and promote more moderate voices. What if
  commitments aren’t met? Could Australia un-recognise? Albanese and the foreign
  affairs minister, Penny Wong, shrugged off repeated questions on Monday and
  Tuesday about commitments not being met. Albanese has refused multiple times
  to say whether Australia could revoke Palestinian recognition. Government
  sources indicate Labor is focused on making the reforms work, rather than
  considering alternatives. Wong told the ABC on Monday that Australia and the
  international community would “hold the Palestinian Authority to its
  commitments”. Ley says a future Coalition government would revoke Palestinian
  recognition, raising questions about how such a diplomatic backflip could be
  executed three or six years into the future of a newly established Palestine.
  The Coalition has claimed Palestinian recognition is a reward for Hamas. How
  will Australia help Palestine? Wong says there is “much more work to do in
  building a Palestinian state”. Australia will contribute to building the
  capacity of the PA and providing humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza. Asked
  on the ABC whether Australia would help in rebuilding Gaza after Israel’s
  military bombardment, Albanese said Australia would “play our part” – but
  noted Australia was “not big players in the Middle East”. What conditions have
  other countries placed on recognising Palestine? More than 146 countries have
  already recognised Palestine. In recent weeks, France, Canada and the UK have
  pledged to recognise. The Canadian leader Mark Carney’s pledge was also
  predicated on the PA’s commitment to reforms and elections, including no role
  for Hamas and a demilitarised Palestine. The French president, Emmanuel
  Macron, in pledging recognition, noted Abbas’s condemnation of Hamas, and the
  PA’s calls for Hamas to be disarmed and excluded from future governance of
  Palestine. Macron also spoke of the PA’s commitment to reforms and elections.
  The British prime minister, Keir Starmer, pledged to recognise Palestine
  unless Israel’s government took “substantive steps to end the appalling
  situation in Gaza”, including a ceasefire and peace plan. What will
  recognition mean for embassies and ambassadors? Wong says practical steps,
  such as an Australian embassy presence or conferring full embassy status to
  the Palestinian delegation to Australia, would be tied to the PA’s
  commitments. But no firm timeline or details have been confirmed. What more
  could the government do? The government is facing pressure from inside and
  outside its ranks to go further in responding to Israel’s military campaign.
  Labor Friends of Palestine, an internal pressure group, has urged the
  government to impose sanctions on more members of Netanyahu’s government, put
  more aid and mobile hospitals into Gaza, and set up a humanitarian visa
  pathway for Palestinians. Other Palestinian Australian groups have urged the
  cutting of diplomatic ties with Israel – a step Albanese rejected as
  “completely counterproductive”.
