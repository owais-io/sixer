  I’m 15, and in a six-month relationship with my boyfriend who has a very toxic
  home life. This has given him significant mental health issues. He gets upset
  by little things, and struggles to move on, catastrophising small
  disagreements, thinking I hate him and saying he’ll self-harm. He has a really
  strong sense of self: he hates people being better than him at anything he
  cares about, and is obsessed with looks. The real issue for me is that I often
  feel I’m walking on eggshells: I can’t tell him about achievements or he’ll
  get upset; I soften any viewpoint I’m worried he won’t like; I can’t tell him
  he upset me without him getting extremely defensive. I do not want to lose
  him. He’s really thoughtful, caring, beautiful and profound. He always checks
  for consent before doing anything sexual (nothing much as we’re both
  underage); he cares for me if I’m upset, gives me advice, makes me feel
  confident in myself and happy. But I’m worried about the coming weeks, as I’m
  going on holiday and I know I’ll have to reassure him I love him every two
  days, feeling guilty for just having a nice time. I feel so strongly in love,
  and don’t want to break up with him. I’d really like some strategies to help
  him feel better, be less sensitive, and avoid triggers without it being
  exhausting. It’s never too early or late in life to start asking the right
  questions and here, as my specialist this week, the UKCP-registered child and
  adolescent psychotherapist Sara Anton says, the questions you might want to
  ask are: “What does a healthy relationship looks like? Is this a healthy
  relationship, and if not why not? If you are looking after your boyfriend’s
  needs all the time, how can you take care of your needs? And how does it feel
  to do so much caretaking at this point in your life?” You sound incredibly
  mature, astute and sensitive, but the flipside is that you will attract people
  who look to you to fulfil things lacking in themselves. It’s also never too
  early or late to learn about boundaries. I hear that you are really in love;
  as Anton points out: “At 15 it’s really usual – and developmentally
  appropriate [as we have to learn to separate from our parents] – to have these
  intense relationships.” But, and it is a significant but, this relationship
  raises concerns for us. No relationship should mean you are radically changing
  your behaviour – as you are – to appease someone else. I’m sorry for your
  boyfriend’s home life, the details of which you asked me to withhold, but you
  are not responsible for his happiness or anyone else’s. “At this age,” says
  Anton, “you are starting to find out who you are, what you like and don’t
  like, how to be with others, what your boundaries are, and how to take care of
  your own emotions. From what you say, this relationship is more intense than
  is healthy and it’s taking a toll on you. It will be hard to build a sense of
  who you are as a young person when you are so entwined.” Aspects of your
  relationship sound coercive. I’m sure you’ve covered this in PSHE lessons, but
  it can be hard to see when this is happening to us. Not being able to share or
  having to water down good news for fear of him not liking it, him threatening
  to self-harm, feeling like you’re constantly treading on eggshells: these are
  not what a healthy relationship is based on. Your boyfriend doesn’t sound like
  he has a strong sense of self, quite the opposite; it sounds like he’s
  outsourcing his self-esteem to you. This is not something you can delegate. I
  would really urge you to talk to an adult you trust. You’ve taken a really big
  step towards this by writing to me. If you are constantly keeping the peace
  with your boyfriend, you will get no peace yourself. You can’t fix him, or
  anyone else. That’s not your job. Your job is to look after yourself first and
  foremost. That’s not selfish but self-aware and self-protective, and that
  lesson can never be learned too young. • Every week, Annalisa Barbieri
