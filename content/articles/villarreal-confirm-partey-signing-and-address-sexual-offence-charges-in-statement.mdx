  Villarreal have confirmed the signing of Thomas Partey on a free transfer
  after the expiry of his contract with Arsenal. The move was announced two days
  after the 32-year-old appeared in court charged with six sexual offences.
  Partey was bailed to appear at the Old Bailey for trial later this year,
  charged with five counts of rape relating to two women and a charge of sexual
  assault against a third woman. The alleged offences are said to have taken
  place in 2021 and 2022 when Partey was playing for Arsenal. The Ghana
  international has signed a one-season contract and will join the Villarreal
  squad in training on Friday. His arrival has upset fans of the Spanish club,
  with hundreds signing a petition urging a halt to what has been described as
  the “darkest day in the club’s history”. Villarreal said in a statement: “The
  club is aware that the player is currently involved in legal proceedings in
  England. The player firmly maintains his innocence and denies all charges
  against him. The club respects the fundamental principle of the presumption of
  innocence and will await the outcome of the judicial process, which will be
  responsible for clarifying the facts of the case. Due to the law in England in
  relation to ongoing proceedings, the club is unable to comment further.
  “Villarreal CF wishes to clearly reiterate its strong commitment to respect
  and diversity and firmly condemns any act of violence in all its forms,
  including gender-based violence, discrimination, racism, xenophobia or any
  behaviour that undermines the dignity of individuals.” Partey made 167
  appearances for Arsenal after joining from Atlético Madrid in 2020. Villarreal
  beat Arsenal 3-2 in a friendly on Wednesday.
