  into the heart of the field’

  As has now become the norm for journalists working in Gaza, Mariam Abu Dagga
  prepared her will despite being just 33 years old. She left behind two sets of
  instructions: to her colleagues, do not cry at her funeral; to her 13-year-old
  son, Ghaith, make her proud. Despite her instructions, Dagga’s colleagues
  could not help but weep over her body on Monday. She was killed by Israel,
  alongside four other journalists, while rushing to check on a colleague struck
  by Israel in al-Nasser hospital, where she had often reported throughout the
  war in Gaza. “Mariam had left us instructions not to cry for her when we bid
  her farewell. She wanted us to spend time with her body, speak to her and take
  our fill of her before she left,” said Samaheer Farhan, a 21-year-old
  freelance journalist and close friend of Dagga. The 33-year-old
  photojournalist was an inspiring figure to Farhan and many other journalists
  in Gaza who admired her relentless reporting, despite the often deeply
  personal losses she suffered throughout the war. Her rise to prominence as a
  journalist began with tragedy. She filmed the death of a protester who was
  shot during the 2018 Great March of Return in Gaza, where Israeli forces shot
  protesters marching towards the Gaza border fence, killing more than 220
  people and wounding more than 9,200. She later discovered that the protester
  was her brother. Dagga continued her work as a journalist during the war in
  Gaza over the last 22 months, working as a freelancer with the Associated
  Press and Independent Arabia. Independent Arabia said that she was the
  “example of dedication and professional commitment”, and praised her for
  carrying “her camera into the heart of the field, conveying the suffering of
  civilians and the voices of victims with rare honesty and courage”. Her
  photography and reporting highlighted the humanity of her subjects and focused
  on the suffering of civilians in Gaza. Her photo of five-year-old Jamal
  al-Najjar, who died of malnutrition just weeks earlier, portrayed the child
  tenderly, his small body wrapped in a shroud and placed gently on bricks so
  that he did not touch the ground. Another photo showed dozens of men
  scrambling to get food from an aid truck in southern Gaza, a mess of bodies as
  they desperately compete for scarce aid. To her colleagues, she was known also
  for her kindness and dedication. “Mariam was kind, gentle and deeply
  passionate about her work. She had lost her mother and her closest colleague,
  Abu Anas, yet she never stopped covering the war for even a single day,”
  Farhan said. They also described her as having a reputation for fearlessness,
  reporting from some of the most dangerous areas of Gaza. Like other members of
  the Gaza press corps, she knew the danger of being a journalist in the
  Palestinian territory. The war in Gaza has been the deadliest period ever for
  journalists, killing more than 192 Palestinian journalists since it began on 7
  October, 2023. The Committee to Protect Journalists condemned Israel’s
  “broadcasted killing of journalists in Gaza”. Israel’s military, commenting on
  the killing of the five journalists on Monday, said that it “does not target
  journalists as such”. Dagga had not seen her son in a year-and-a-half, after
  he had been evacuated to the UAE with his father. “She longed to see and
  embrace her son again. Mariam died with that dream still unfulfilled, to hold
  her child once more,” Farhan said. To her son Ghaith, Dagga left behind her
  wishes that he always grow up to fulfil his dreams. “I want you to make me
  proud to become successful and excel, to prove yourself and to grow into a
  great businessman, my dear,” she wrote in a letter to her son. “When you grow
  up, get married and have a daughter, name her Mariam after me. You are my
  love, my heart, my support, my soul and my son whom I am proud of.”
