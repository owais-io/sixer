  Black means safety, blue is calming and red equals strength – the colour you
  pick for your new car is supposed to be a reflection of who you are. But it
  could cost you more than you expect. UK “75” number plates are being rolled
  out from Monday and “new reg day” is traditionally a busy time for car
  dealers. Depending on the make and model you are buying, picking a blue paint
  job rather than red or a matt instead of a metallic finish could add thousands
  to the cost of a new vehicle. Many car manufacturers now only offer one “free”
  colour as standard. A Nissan Qashqai, for example, will come in red, and if
  you want it in silver, black, white or metallic blue, you will have £745 added
  to your bill. An Audi Q3 comes in white at no extra cost, but an extra £575
  gets you a range of colours – from “progressive red” to “navarra blue”. White
  is also free for a BMW X3, but go for “dune grey” and you will have to pay
  £875, while “tanzanite blue” costs £1,725. Earlier this summer, the motoring
  website Auto Express surveyed the costs of paint colours across a range of
  cars from different manufacturers. “We’re seeing huge discrepancies in paint
  pricing between manufacturers and they’re not always obvious at first glance,”
  says its editor, Paul Barker. “It’s catching people out and can turn what
  should be a fun part of car buying into a bit of a nightmare.” If you are
  comparing the cost of two different vehicles and have a colour in mind, you
  need to make sure you know how much the manufacturers will charge for it.
  There are four main types of car finish. From the cheapest to the most
  expensive, they are: solid, the most basic; metallic, which has tiny pieces of
  aluminium in it to reflect light and give a shine; pearlescent, which shines
  even more brightly; and matt, a modern non-reflective look. More elaborate
  paint jobs can cause other headaches. When you choose to sell your car, a bold
  colour will probably be harder to shift. Jonathan Such, of First Response
  Finance, a vehicle financing company, says white, black and silver cars are
  timeless and tend to hold their value better. “Cars that have come in the
  colour of the ‘moment’ or a trending colour tend to depreciate quicker, so
  will lose their value quickly, meaning a lower price,” he says. Barker says
  you will be unlikely to make your money back from an expensive investment on a
  unique or niche colour scheme. There is one exception, he says, in the bright
  yellow Renault 5 – a colour that has been synonymous with the car since the
  1970s and adds £800 to the cost of a new vehicle. The more elaborate the type
  of paint used, the more expensive repairs are likely to be. James Harris of
  Slim’s Detailing, a car care retailer, says speciality finishes such as
  metallics or pearlescents are costly if they have to be touched up. “A small
  scratch can become a big hassle and matching that paint exactly will cost more
  than your standard job,” he says. You may also find you need to have work done
  more often. “Darker colours such as black or deep blue are beautiful when
  they’re polished, but they’re like a magnet for every swirl mark [light
  scratches] and water spots,” Harris says. “You need to be on top of it with
  regular detailing to keep them looking their best. If you’re after a
  low-maintenance option, then lighter colours – think silver or white – are the
  way to go. They hide imperfections much better.” Martijn Versteegen, the
  founder of Imagin Studio, which creates images of vehicles for car companies,
  says expensive matt finishes are more prone to visible scratches and cannot be
  polished out like conventional paint. “Even a small scratch can mean a full
  respray,” he says. And just to add to the complication, red cars can cost more
  in repairs as they may need to get resprayed more often, says Such. “This is
  because red car paint fades over time at a quicker rate than any other
  colour,” he says. Insurers say the colour you choose will not affect your
  premium, but if you change the colour after you have bought it, that could be
  classed as a modification, so you need to inform whoever provides your policy.
  While £745 may sound a lot to get a Qashqai in anything but red, spare a
  thought for prospective supercar owners: opting for a new Maserati GranTurismo
  Folgore finished in “azzuro astro glossy” will cost you £15,840. Then again,
  if you can afford the £182,000 price tag, perhaps it is not so painful.
