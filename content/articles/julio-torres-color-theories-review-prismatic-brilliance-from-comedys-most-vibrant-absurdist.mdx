  vibrant absurdist

  Fans of the former Saturday Night Live writer Julio Torres know him to be the
  current torchbearer of Izzardian absurdism. Whether on television (Los
  Espookys, Fantasmas), in cinema (Problemista) or in his children’s book about
  an aspirational toilet plunger (I Want to Be a Vase), his is a world where
  inanimate objects are sentient and diversity thrives in defiance of the
  corporate. In Color Theories, the charismatic Salvadoran American comic
  reveals another string to his bow: “I’m sent all over the world to find
  colours,” he confides, daring us to doubt him. Like his previous show, My
  Favourite Shapes, this is an hour of sit-down comedy aided by an overhead
  camera which relays Torres’s theories – illustrated with crayon squiggles – on
  to a screen behind him. Sporting a copper-coloured pixie cut and a pair of
  pink feather antlers, Torres himself resembles a child’s doodle. His
  inquisitive mind produces interconnected ideas about Catholicism, the
  blandness of Pixar and what orange sounds like, while his insights train us to
  spot “highly purple behaviour”. His casual millennial delivery, peppered with
  “um”s and “ah”s, makes surreal concepts sound like items on a brunch menu.
  Avoiding standard associations (such as green for envy) or obvious jibes
  (there is no mention of the US president’s orange hue), Torres uses colour to
  explain everything from tax avoidance to superhero vigilantism – his sage
  advice to Batman made that bit funnier by addressing him as “hun”. The
  anticapitalist, nonconformist philosophy that runs through all of Torres’s
  work is present, and deftly integrated. Weak material, such as underdeveloped
  observations on the animal kingdom, is in the minority. Phrasing, as ever, is
  immaculate: Torres defines words as “the jobs that letters are hired to do”.
  Though he may have failed so far in his colour-scouting mission (he hasn’t yet
  found a new one, he admits), this hour leaves you tickled pink. • At Soho
  theatre, London, until 16 August.
