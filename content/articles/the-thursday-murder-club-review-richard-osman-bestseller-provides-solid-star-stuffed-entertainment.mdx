  The Thursday Murder Club review – Richard Osman bestseller provides solid,
  star-stuffed entertainment
sectionName: Film

  Richard Osman’s phenomenal bestseller from 2020 was an ingenious, accessible,
  good-natured book, which helped rebrand the English detective novel as “cosy
  crime”, started a celeb-copycat publishing trend and, being about four elderly
  people in a retirement community rising above ageist condescension to solve
  crimes, spoke eloquently to the shut-in frustrations and escapist yearnings of
  the Covid age. Now it has been adapted as a funny and likable, if slightly
  bland, comedy-drama for Netflix, which as one character amusingly and
  pre-emptively comments, feels just like a Sunday teatime TV crime drama. There
  is nothing new about these nostalgist leanings: Agatha Christie has after all
  been a solid film and TV export for more than half a century. Screenwriters
  Katy Brand and Suzanne Heathcote adapt the novel and director Chris Columbus
  robustly delivers the C-major chords of mainstream entertainment. The result
  is some undemanding enjoyment, even if the film does appear finally to be
  saying something rather bold, even controversial, on the subject of assisted
  dying. The scene is Coopers Chase, a retirement facility that looks like a
  gigantic stately home grand enough to rival Downton Abbey; some of the
  exteriors were filmed at Englefield Estate in Berkshire. Inhabitants are
  assigned huge sets of panelled rooms – what must the fees at such an
  extraordinary place be? The clientele have all sorts of hobbies, but the most
  remarkable is that of the Thursday Murder Club. This comprises former MI6
  chief Elizabeth (Helen Mirren), ex-trade unionist Ron (Pierce Brosnan),
  retired psychiatrist Ibrahim (Ben Kingsley) and former nurse Joyce (Celia
  Imrie), whose own obsession with baking absurdly lavish cakes brings some
  Bake-Off energy to the picturesque tale. They meet in the jigsaw room every
  week to discuss unsolved crimes, supplied to them by Elizabeth’s friend, a
  retired police officer now in the palliative care wing. Elizabeth’s husband
  Stephen (Jonathan Pryce) has dementia and is another resident of Coopers
  Chase; Elizabeth has apparently moved there as well to be with him and she is
  as vigorous and hale and hearty as her TMC pals. When their evil landlord Ian
  Ventham (David Tennant) unveils unspeakable plans to redevelop the place as
  luxury flats, this sets in train violent and mysterious events involving his
  business partners Tony Curran (Geoff Bell) and Bobby Tanner (Richard E Grant).
  These need to be investigated by local coppers DCI Chris Hudson (Daniel Mays),
  an officer with a serious chocolate habit, and WPC Donna de Freitas (Naomi
  Ackie). But the police won’t get anywhere without the help of the Thursday
  Murder Club, whose leader Elizabeth has icily forbidden use of the word
  “feisty” to describe them. There’s a fair bit to enjoy here, with the club
  sometimes resembling a kind of senior-citizen X-Men group whose collective
  superpower is invisibility; old people can do things without people noticing
  them. We also get some self-aware gags: Helen Mirren’s character at one stage
  walks in and her husband says that she looks “just like the queen” – that is,
  Queen Elizabeth, who Mirren portrayed in The Queen. Yet when the plot has to
  accelerate to the point of pure daftness in its final act, the movie resembles
  not so much a Sunday night crime serial, but a weekday afternoon kids’ TV
  show. Nothing necessarily wrong with that of course. The keynote is fun. • The
  Thursday Murder Club is in cinemas from 22 August, and is on Netflix from 28
  August.
