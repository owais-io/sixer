  A former Royal Marine commando accused of deliberately driving his car into a
  crowd of Liverpool football fans at a victory parade wept in the dock as he
  made a court appearance on Thursday to face an additional 24 charges,
  including two relating to alleged victims who were babies. Paul Doyle, 53,
  from Liverpool, is charged with dangerous driving and causing grievous bodily
  harm with intent after 134 people were injured when a Ford Galaxy struck fans
  on Water Street in the city centre on 26 May. When asked if he was Paul Doyle,
  the defendant sounded choked as he responded: “Yes I am.” The father of three,
  wearing a grey T-shirt, could be seen wiping his eyes. Doyle was charged
  originally with seven counts relating to six people, but this was increased to
  31 counts before the hearing at Liverpool crown court. He is charged with 19
  counts of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm, seven counts of causing
  grievous bodily harm with intent, three counts of wounding with intent, one
  count of dangerous driving and one count of affray. The charges now cover 29
  alleged victims up to the age of 77, six of whom are children. Of the
  children, two are babies aged six and seven months. The incident happened on
  the evening of 26 May as Liverpool fans were dispersing after an open-air bus
  parade through the city to mark their team’s Premier League title win. A large
  press contingent and a number of family members were present in court for the
  15-minute hearing. The recorder of Liverpool, Judge Andrew Menary KC,
  rescheduled a plea hearing as Doyle’s legal team had not had the opportunity
  to review key evidence that was to be presented to the court. The plea hearing
  will take place on 4 September. Earlier this year, a provisional trial date
  was fixed for 24 November. The trial is expected to last three to four weeks.
