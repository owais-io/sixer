  When Texas Republicans redrew their congressional map this month at the urging
  of Donald Trump, they faced a difficult task. They needed to find a way to
  pick up five seats that the president wanted ahead of the midterm elections
  next year without spreading their voters too thin and jeopardizing the 25
  seats they already held. Republicans unveiled their plan to pick up the seats
  on Wednesday, revealing a map that could dilute Hispanic voting power. Under
  the new proposed districts, they would be favored in five new seats, giving
  them a hold on 30 of Texas’s 38 congressional districts. Had the district been
  in place for the 2024 election, Trump would have won all 30 by at least 10
  points. Republicans accomplished their goal by shifting district boundaries in
  three different parts of the state. In south Texas, they shifted boundaries of
  congressional districts where Trump performed well in the 2024 elections, but
  are held by two Democrats, Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez. Trump won
  Cuellar’s district by seven points and Gonzalez’s districts by about four
  points in 2024. Had the proposed districts been in place in 2024, he would
  have won each by about 10 points. In central Texas, the Dallas-Fort Worth
  metroplex, and Houston, Republicans eliminated three separate Democratic
  congressional districts with a similar approach. They packed Democratic voters
  into one or two districts and then attached the rest to newly drawn, heavily
  Republican areas. It’s an aggressive approach that gives Republicans a shot at
  picking up five seats, but doesn’t necessarily guarantee they will get all
  five. Analysts believe that Cuellar – who faces federal bribery charges – and
  Gonzalez, are established enough incumbents that they could win in the new
  configurations of their districts. “They didn’t make the newly targeted, or
  the new seats targeted for pickups, as red as they could have,” said David
  Wasserman, a well-respected analyst at the Cook Political Report. “Had
  Republicans drawn an uglier map, they could have basically guaranteed
  themselves five [seats].” Republicans are redrawing the map amid a four-year
  legal battle over the districts that are already in place. That suit, filed by
  a coalition of Latino voting organizations, advocacy groups and voters, argues
  that Texas’s current congressional map diminishes the influence of non-white
  voters, who accounted for 95% of the state’s population growth. “The current
  map is already egregiously gerrymandered,” said Marina Jenkins, the executive
  director of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, which opposes the
  redraw in Texas. “The proposed new gerrymander, and even more extreme
  gerrymander, adds even more insult to that injury, Black voters and Latino
  voters will have even less opportunity to have their political will considered
  on an equal basis.” The new map replaces several districts where Hispanic and
  other voters of color had been electing Democrats with majority-Hispanic
  districts that favor Republicans. It would increase the number of districts
  where white people comprise a majority from 22 to 24, according to an analysis
  by the Texas Tribune. It would also create an additional Hispanic-majority
  district, and two new Black-majority districts. “The gambit by Republicans
  here is to actually increase the number of Hispanic majority districts in
  terms of population share, but to diminish the opportunities of Hispanic
  voters to elect their candidates of choice,” Wasserman said. “Because there
  are a number of Hispanic majority districts where Democratic-leaning Hispanic
  voters will be outnumbered by a coalition of conservative Hispanic voters and
  white voters.” Simply adding additional majority-Hispanic districts isn’t
  enough to evade scrutiny under the Voting Rights Act, said Thomas A Saenz, the
  president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and
  Educational Fund, which is representing plaintiffs challenging the existing
  maps. If certain conditions are met, the Voting Rights Act requires states to
  draw districts that give minority groups the chance to elect their preferred
  candidates. “When a line drawer draws majority Latino districts, but in such a
  way that it knows will not actually elect the candidates of choice of the
  Latino community, that may be a violation of the Voting Rights Act,” he said,
  speaking generally about the map. “You can do that by picking areas with large
  Latino voting population but that historically has a lower voter turnout than
  other [areas] with large Latino population. “Pointing to the number of quote
  unquote majority Latino district does not remotely answer the question of
  whether you have violated the Voting Rights Act.”
