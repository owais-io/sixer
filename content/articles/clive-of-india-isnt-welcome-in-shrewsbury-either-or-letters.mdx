  Thangam Debbonaire is concerned about visiting Indian citizens and dignitaries
  having to walk past a statue of Robert Clive in London (Labour peer calls for
  removal of Clive of India statue from outside Foreign Office, 11 August). I’m
  sure the people of Shrewsbury are equally concerned about having to walk past
  the Clive statue on our high street and main square. Five years ago, a
  petition on the subject was signed by 9,000 people. The council responded by
  keeping the statue and taking three years to produce a small interpretation
  board. The people of Shrewsbury do not want to be associated with this
  “unstable sociopath” (as William Dalrymple called him), and look forward to
  Debbonaire’s support for its removal. Jean Garner Minsterley, Shropshire •
