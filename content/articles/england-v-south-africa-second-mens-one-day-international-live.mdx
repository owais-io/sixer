  According to Harry Brook, and Stuart Broad on comms, Sonny Baker hasn’t been
  dropped because of the pasting he received two days ago. The argument is that
  on this pitch Saqib Mahmood’s fuller length will be a handful. South Africa
  have two spinners. Which is…interesting. Lord’s isn’t really a grippy sort of
  surface. The bowlers in reserve are Kagiso Rabada (being rested) as well as
  young Kwena Maphaka and Codi Yusuf. But not of them can bat. So Senuran
  Muthusamy comes in as much for his willow-wielding as his orb-tweaking (just
  go with it). England: Duckett, Smith, Root, Brook (c), Buttler (wk), Bethell,
  Jacks, Carse, Archer, Rashid, Mahmood. South Africa: Markram, Rickelton (wk),
  Bavuma (c), Breetzke, Stubbs, Brevis, Bosch, Muthusamy, Maharaj, Burger,
  Ngidi. “We think it’ll hopefully have a bit in it from thje start,” says Harry
  Brook. He says it’s a “new day” and that the “series starts today”. It
  actually started on Tuesday, but we know what he means. Sonny Baker, after
  getting loads of tap, misses out and is replaced by Saqib Mahmood. Temba
  Bavuma also wanted to bowl. “We’ll just have to do a job with the bat,” he
  says. The injured Tony de Zorzi, as well as the unwell Wiaan Mulder are absent
  from the team that did the job on Tuesday. Mathew Breetzke and Sunaren
  Muthusamy enter the fray. Matt Hughes has been doing his best Tillakaratne
  Dilshan impression by getting loads of scoops for us. Here he lifts the lid on
  on a dispute over signings in the Hundred: And here’s a yarn on the County
  Championship’s restructure: The sun may be shining but the outfield is still a
  little wet. That means we’ll have the toss at 12:45 with play underway at
  13:15. What did you make of Harry Brook’s seemingly blasé comments after their
  heavy defeat on Tuesday? The skipper said: “Not ideal. Not a great start to
  the series – one of those bad days and we have to move on as soon as
  possible.” Look, I get that players shouldn’t dwell on disappointing results.
  And that looking forward is healthy. But wouldn’t a little apology to the
  paying public have been welcome? Couldn’t he have acknowledge that an
  international game is expensive and time consuming, that many people would
  have taken a day off work, that some kids might have been watching England
  live for the first time? I’m not saying Brook should serve jail time. It’s
  only cricket after all. But some sort of recognition for their abject show
  would have been welcome. The covers are on after some heavy, but brief
  showers. So while we wait for things to get underway, why not tuck into this
  week’s Spin. It’s from yours truly on the magic of cricket scorecards. I’ve
  always loved them. I love looking at them. I love filling them with little
  names and numbers. So I decided to write about them with the help of two
  legends of the craft. Hope you enjoy it: Ready or not, here comes another one!
  England were rubbish two days ago. After getting bowled out for 131, they got
  tonked by Aiden Markram in a seven-wicket rout. The good news is that there’s
  little time to contemplate that result as the boys are back. It’s a mad
  schedule, one that flogs players, tests journalists and asks so much from the
  paying public. But that’s the modern game and on we go. England need to
  improve in just about every department at the Home of Cricket today but its
  their batting that needs a serious rethink. As Mark Butcher said at Headingley
  on Tuesday, they fail to recognise that putting the brakes on for a little bit
  in the innings isn’t a sign of weakness but is often the sensible thing to do.
  When they’re rolling they look unstoppable. But when they need to take stock
  and consolidate they’re a shambles. Can they rectify their mistakes today? If
  not they’ll lose the series with a game to spare. There’s a bit of mizzle in
  the air around west London but we should get a full game on. I’m excited to
  kick things off today. If you’d like to get in touch please drop me a mail.
  Reckon this England team can show a bit of humility and common sense? Or is
  that just woke nonsense in the age of Baz? Let me know. Play gets underway at
  1pm BST. Toss, team news and other bits to come.
