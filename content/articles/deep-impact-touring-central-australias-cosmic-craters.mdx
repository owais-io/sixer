  “You didn’t mention camping on Mars.” My wife had a point: thin air, thinner
  soil, extreme UV, rocks straight from a Nasa red-planet image, jagged ranges –
  all ideal backdrops for a movie set. No wonder the place was considered for
  training by the Apollo program. Its sparse life forms include an intimidating
  shrub whose thorns mimic the stingers on the scorpions that come out after
  dark. A harsh, forbidding place, but beautiful too. We made shade with our
  camper awning and waited for magic time: the desert at dusk. Travelling along
  the Stuart Highway it’s easy to miss the Henbury Meteorites conservation
  reserve, 12km off the tarmac along a rough track one and a half hours south of
  Alice Springs. We’d seen samples of its space rock in the excellent display at
  the Museum of Central Australia in Alice and were keen to see where they fell.
  There are six known impact sites in the territory and the two most accessible
  are Henbury and Tnorala (Gosse Bluff). We visited both during Victoria’s fifth
  Covid lockdown in 2021. Henbury is a site where a nickel-iron meteor about the
  size of a garden shed disintegrated before striking the land to carve out over
  a dozen impact craters, just 4,500 years ago – so recently that the site has
  significant cultural meaning as a sorry place for the Luritja people, whose
  sacred songs and oral histories tell of this devastating event. Sign up for
  the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the
  weekend, every Saturday morning Scientific models suggest the meteorites hit
  Earth at 40,000km/h in an explosion akin to the Hiroshima blast. The site’s 12
  craters are best viewed when the sunlight’s low angle reveals the smaller,
  heavily eroded examples. Among the youngest of Earth’s known impact sites,
  Henbury’s pits have been scoured by wind and rare deluges down the Finke River
  flood plain. Extreme temperatures do the rest. The largest crater is 180m
  across, the smallest the size of a back-yard spa. The explosion sprayed out
  tonnes of pulverised rock in a distinctive rayed pattern still visible around
  Crater No 3 – the only known terrestrial example. Temptingly, specimens of the
  actual meteorite hurled out may still be found. The 45kg chunk in the Museum
  of Central Australia is one example of 680kg collected so far, though digging
  or damaging the site without a permit is illegal. We don’t find any meteorite
  fragments but we leave with memories of a humming sunrise and night with a
  billion almost touchable stars. From Tylers Pass lookout, two hours west along
  the Namatjira Drive from Alice Springs, Tnorala (Gosse Bluff) appears as a
  mountain range thrusting incongruously from the endless western plains. In
  fact, these peaks were created in seconds when an object up to 1km wide hit
  the Earth at about 250,000km/h, 142m years ago, with an explosive force at
  least 20 times more powerful than all the world’s nuclear weapons. No trace of
  that object has been found, so it probably vaporised on impact. The crater is
  22km in diameter, though erosion has reduced the height of the hills
  surrounding it. Satellite images uncannily resemble a staring eye under a
  sunburnt brow. Specimens in the Museum of Central Australia show that early
  Cretaceous central Australia was wetter and cooler than it is now, with
  abundant dinosaurs. Locally, they would have been vaporised, and anything
  living within 100km killed by the massive shock wave and extreme heat. The
  sound of the explosion probably travelled around the world. The Tnorala bolide
  event was a prelude to the big one, Chicxulub on Mexico’s Yucatán peninsula,
  which wiped out the dinosaurs 77m years later. In their oral traditions,
  Western Arrernte people understand Tnorala as a cosmic impact site. A group of
  star women were dancing in a corroboree in the Milky Way when one woman placed
  her baby in a turna (wooden cradle). The dancing shook the galaxy and the
  turna slipped, with the baby falling to Earth as a blazing star, striking the
  ground to create the crater’s distinctive bowl shape. These days “awesome” is
  a word debased by glib use. It’s apt driving into the 5km-wide Tnorala crater,
  surrounded by cliffs 180 metres high, formed in a blink by a literally
  Earth-shattering event as our planet’s crust rebounded to form the crater’s
  inner ring. The rock strata in these peaks show that some were lifted from a
  depth of 4km by incredible explosive force and are now inverted. It’s not just
  awareness of this ancient violence that marks Tnorala as a sorry place. Local
  information boards describe it as a pre-colonial massacre site. So it’s doubly
  proper that camping is forbidden. It’s an unwelcoming place, where an object
  large enough to be classified as a city-killer fell from the sky. This kind of
  comet is now thankfully detectable by telescopes such as the new Vera C Rubin
  observatory in Chile. It also been proven feasible to steer them off course.
  So forget Mars. Cancel that ticket. Instead, visit awesome central Australia –
  where the mountains are upside down, the stars greet your fingertips and the
  dawns are so silent you can hear the sun sing. Need to know The Museum of
  Central Australia is hosting a Henbury Meteorite reserve discovery day on 10
  August as part of National Science week. Henbury: Day trips to the Henbury
  Meteorites conservation reserve require a Northern Territory parks pass and
  the site can be reached by 2WD vehicles, however 4WDs are recommended. The
  reserve’s basic facilities include picnic shelters and a drop toilet. Water
  and firewood are not available. Campsites must be booked online through
  Northern Territory Parks and fees apply. The nearest food and fuel supplies
  are available 85km south at the Erldunda Roadhouse on the Stuart Highway.
  Tnorala (Gosse Bluff): The Tnorala crater is accessible via a sandy track and
  offers picnic shelters and a drop toilet. Camping is not permitted in the
  reserve due to its status as a registered sacred site of the Western Arrernte
  people. Fuel and food is available at Hermannsburg, 62km east on the Namatjira
  Way. Travel beyond Tnorala is by 4WD only and requires a Mereenie Tour pass.
  Many of these roads may be impassable in wet weather. • Associate Prof Duane
  Hamacher assisted with factchecking for this story This article was amended on
  4 August 2025 to clarify that erosion reduced the height of the hills around
  Tnorala crater. A previous version suggested erosion had reduced the crater’s
  diameter. A previous version also stated that the object that created the
  crater was likely an icy comet.
