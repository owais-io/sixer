  The Philippines has released dramatic footage of a Chinese warship colliding
  with a vessel from its own coastguard while chasing a Philippine patrol boat
  in the South China Sea. The incident occurred near the contested Scarborough
  Shoal on Monday as the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) escorted vessels
  distributing aid to fishers in the area, Philippine authorities said. “Their
  [the Chinese vessels’] actions not only posed a grave danger to Philippine
  personnel and vessels, but also resulted in the unfortunate collision between
  the two Chinese vessels,” the Philippine foreign ministry said on Tuesday,
  accusing the Chinese crew of “dangerous manoeuvres and unlawful interference”
  in the resupply mission. Video released by Manila showed a Chinese coastguard
  ship and a much larger vessel bearing the number 164 on its hull colliding
  with a loud crash in the wake of the Philippine vessel. Additional footage and
  photos released later by the PCG showed the stricken Chinese vessel still
  afloat but with its entire bow crumpled inward. The PCG spokesperson Commodore
  Jay Tarriela said in a statement: “The [Chinese coastguard vessel] CCG 3104,
  which was chasing the [PCG vessel] BRP Suluan at high speed, performed a risky
  manoeuvre from the [Philippine] vessel’s starboard quarter, leading to the
  impact with the PLA [People’s Liberation Army] navy warship. “This resulted in
  substantial damage to the CCG vessel’s forecastle, rendering it unseaworthy.”
  Earlier in the confrontation, the BRP Suluan was “targeted with a water
  cannon” by the Chinese but “successfully” evaded it, Tarriela’s statement
  said. At a later press briefing, Tarriela said crew members onboard the
  smaller Chinese vessel had been visible in its front section shortly before
  the collision. “We’re not sure whether they were able to rescue those
  personnel who were in front prior to the collision. But we are hoping that
  these personnel are in good condition,” he told reporters. Tarriela said the
  Chinese crew did not respond to the Philippine ship’s offer of assistance. Gan
  Yu, a Chinese coastguard spokesperson, confirmed that a confrontation had
  taken place, without mentioning the collision. “The China coastguard took
  necessary measures in accordance with the law, including monitoring, pressing
  from the outside, blocking and controlling the Philippine vessels to drive
  them away,” he said in a statement. China has neither confirmed or denied the
  incident, only saying that it “lawfully” took measures to drive away
  Philippine vessels that had “forcibly intruded” into its waters. “The China
  coastguard will continue to carry out rights-protection law enforcement
  activities in the waters of Huangyan Dao in accordance with the law, and will
  resolutely safeguard China’s national territorial sovereignty and maritime
  rights and interests,” said the coastguard spokesperson Gan Yu, using China’s
  name for the shoal. Monday’s incident is the latest in a series of
  confrontations between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea, which
  Beijing claims almost entirely despite an international ruling that the
  assertion has no legal basis. More than 60% of global maritime trade passes
  through the disputed waterway. Speaking at a news conference, the Philippine
  president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, said the country’s patrol vessels would
  “continue to be present” in the area to defend, as well as exercise Manila’s
  sovereign rights over, what it considers to be part of its territory. The
  Scarborough Shoal – a triangular chain of reefs and rocks – has been a
  flashpoint between the countries since China seized it from the Philippines in
  2012. Marcos has also warned that the Philippines risks confrontation with
  China over another issue – Taiwan, which China’s rulers are preparing to annex
  as territory. With US backing of Taiwan, any attempt threatens to spiral into
  a broader conflict, and on a recent trip to India, Marcos said “there is no
  way that the Philippines can stay out of it”. The Philippines lies on the
  other side of a crucial sea passage past Taiwan – the Bashi channel – and
  there are more than 100,000 Philippine nationals living in Taiwan who would
  need to be evacuated in the event of a conflict. On Monday, Beijing accused
  Marcos of “playing with fire” with his comments, drawing a rebuke from the
  president that they had misinterpreted his comments “for propaganda purposes”.
  “War over Taiwan will drag the Philippines kicking and screaming into the
  conflict. That is what I was trying to say,” Marcos said. With Agence
  France-Presse
