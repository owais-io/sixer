  The former Arsenal footballer Thomas Partey has appeared in court charged with
  six sexual offences. The 32-year-old was bailed to appear at the Old Bailey
  for trial later this year over allegations of rape and sexual assault. During
  Tuesday’s brief hearing at Westminster magistrates court, he stood in the dock
  dressed all in black with his arms behind his back. Partey has been charged
  with five counts of rape against two women and a charge of sexual assault
  against a third woman. The alleged offences are said to have taken place in
  2021 and 2022 when he was an Arsenal player. The chief magistrate Paul
  Goldspring granted conditional bail, telling Partey he must not contact any of
  the three women. Partey was also told he must notify police of any permanent
  change of address and if he is to stay somewhere other than his home for 14
  consecutive days. He was also told to notify police of any international
  travel ahead of time. Partey joined Arsenal from Atlético Madrid in 2020 in a
  transfer worth about £45m. The defensive midfielder had signed for the Spanish
  club in 2012 and made 188 appearances, as well as going out on loan to
  Mallorca and Leganés. He played 35 games for Arsenal in the Premier League
  last season, scoring four goals. Partey left the north London club at the end
  of his contract this summer. As bail conditions were discussed in court,
  Goldspring said: “I understand he’s no longer employed in this country and
  playing in Spain now.” The Metropolitan police said they first received
  allegations against him of rape in February 2022. Partey’s lawyer, Jenny
  Wiltshire, has previously said he “denies all the charges against him” and
  that he welcomed “the opportunity to finally clear his name”.
