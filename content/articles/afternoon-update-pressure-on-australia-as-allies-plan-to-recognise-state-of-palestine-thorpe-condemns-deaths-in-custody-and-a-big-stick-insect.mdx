  Good afternoon. Pressure is growing for Australia to recognise a Palestinian
  state, after Canada announced it would join key allies France and the UK to
  formally recognise Palestine at the next UN general assembly meeting in
  September. The Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, told reporters that the
  planned move was predicated on the Palestinian Authority’s commitment to
  reforms, including fundamentally reforming its governance and holding general
  elections in 2026 in which Hamas can play no part. Carney also said Hamas must
  release all hostages. The UK’s announcement was also conditional, with Keir
  Starmer saying recognition would occur by September unless Israel held to a
  ceasefire, calling for the nation to commit to a two-state solution. Jim
  Chalmers said he won’t put a timeframe on Australian recognition of Palestine
  but said it’s “a matter of when, not if” it happens, while the Greens called
  for recognition as soon as possible. The Liberal senator James Paterson said
  Australia should not follow other countries based on an “artificial measure of
  momentum”. Top news Bruce Lehrmann claims police destroyed exonerating
