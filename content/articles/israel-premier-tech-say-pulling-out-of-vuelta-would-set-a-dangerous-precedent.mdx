  The Israel-Premier Tech team have said pulling out of this year’s Vuelta a
  España would “set a dangerous precedent in the sport of cycling” after
  pro-Palestinian protests disrupted the 11th stage of the race on Wednesday.
  There was no winner declared on Wednesday’s stage due to protesters at the
  finish line in Bilbao. Israel-Premier Tech were also the target of protests
  during the team time-trial last week and there have been suggestions that some
  members of the peloton would like the team to withdraw from the race. After
  stage 11, though, Israel-Premier Tech pledged to continue. “Israel–Premier
  Tech is a professional cycling team,” the team said in a statement. “As such,
  the team remains committed to racing on at the Vuelta a España. Any other
  course of action sets a dangerous precedent in the sport of cycling, not only
  for Israel–Premier Tech, but for all teams. “Israel–Premier Tech has
  repeatedly expressed its respect for everyones’ right to protest, as long as
  those protests remain peaceful and do not compromise the safety of the
  peloton. The Vuelta a España race organisation and police are doing everything
  in their power to create a safe environment and, for that, the team is
  especially grateful. “However, the behaviour of protesters in Bilbao today was
  not only dangerous, but counterproductive to their cause and deprived the
  Basque cycling fans, some of the best cycling fans in the world, of the stage
  finish they deserved. “We thank the race organisers and UCI for their
  continued support and cooperation, as well as the teams and riders that have
  expressed their support both publicly and privately and, of course, our fans.”
  Israel–Premier Tech are expected on the startline in Laredo on Thursday
  morning for the 144.9km stage to Los Corrales de Buelna. The team also have a
  six-man squad at the men’s Tour of Britain, where stage three – running from
  Milton Keynes to Ampthill – takes place on Thursday.
