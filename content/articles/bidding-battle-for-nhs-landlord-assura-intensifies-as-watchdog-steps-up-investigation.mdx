  The bidding battle for the NHS landlord Assura has heated up after its US
  suitor KKR lobbied the board to accept its offer, while the competition
  watchdog stepped up its investigation of Assura’s £1.7bn takeover by a rival
  UK healthcare investor. Primary Health Properties (PHP), which invests in
  buildings housing GP practices, has been blocked from fully integrating Assura
  by the Competition and Markets Authority while it looks into the takeover. The
  watchdog said it had served an initial enforcement order on the companies
  after launching an investigation into the takeover last month to determine
  whether the deal would “result in a substantial lessening of competition”. PHP
  won backing from Assura’s board in June for its cash and shares offer worth
  £1.79bn at the time, after a lengthy bidding war with KKR, a New York-based
  private equity firm. FTSE 250-listed Assura, which was founded in Altrincham
  in Greater Manchester in 2003, now has a market value of £1.6bn. Last August
  it struck a £500m deal with a Canadian investor to buy 14 private hospitals
  across the UK, including Cancer Centre London and the Edgbaston hospital in
  Birmingham. Assura has been buying healthcare properties at a time when the
  NHS is under immense pressure to reduce long waiting times for operations and
  other treatments, and demand for private care has increased. In a statement,
  KKR said it had urged Assura’s board to back its takeover bid, which would
  take Assura private, and withdraw its support for PHP’s offer. KKR, which is
  leading the bid with the New York investment firm Stonepeak Partners, said it
  had met the board of Assura in recent days to lobby for its own cash takeover
  of the company, worth £1.696bn. However, Assura said on Friday that its
  directors still believed the PHP offer was “in the best interests of Assura
  shareholders”. The PHP board said the watchdog’s announcement was “a planned,
  conventional and necessary step of the CMA process”. KKR said a number of
  factors had changed since Assura threw its support behind PHP’s offer,
  including a decline in the share price of both companies that meant KKR’s cash
  bid was now slightly higher than PHP’s cash and shares offer. KKR also argued
  that its takeover bid raised no competition concerns, while Assura and PHP
  would probably be forced to sell some assets if they were to join forces.
  However, some long-term shareholders prefer to hold a stake in a listed
  entity, and investors such as Schroders and Aberdeen Investments are backing
  the PHP takeover. An analyst at Panmure Liberum, Bjorn Zietsman, said he still
  regarded PHP’s offer as “the superior choice for shareholders” because it
  would create a UK market leader in primary healthcare real estate. He said
  KKR’s offer “comes at the cost of losing future strategic, operational, and
  financial benefits”. The recent weakness in the PHP share price reflected
  technical factors with 9% of the register shorted, which was expected to
  unwind, he added. Andrew Saunders, at Shore Capital, said PHP “remains well
  placed to clear the 50% hurdle acceptance” required by the 1pm (UK time)
  deadline on Tuesday. Investment in the NHS estate and managing it better is
  part of the government’s 10-year plan for the NHS, which was published last
  month. “From high street drop-in centres to digitally enabled diagnostic hubs,
  the future of healthcare delivery depends on transforming existing spaces,”
  according to NHS Property Services. Assura owns 603 properties housing
  doctors’ surgeries and hospitals in the UK, which serve more than 6 million
  patients, and many of which are rented to the NHS. They were valued at £3.1bn
  at the end of March, up from £2.7bn the year before. Its rental income climbed
  by 16.6% to £167m during the year, as the company raised its rents by 3.2%.
  This meant it made a pre-tax profit of £166m, against a loss of £28.7m the
  year before. PHP owns 516 properties housing GPs in the UK and Ireland valued
  at £2.8bn, and made £153.6m in rental income last year. KKR was in the news in
  early June when it pulled out of a deal to inject fresh equity into Thames
  Water, leaving the troubled water supplier’s future in doubt and increasing
  the prospects of a temporary nationalisation.
