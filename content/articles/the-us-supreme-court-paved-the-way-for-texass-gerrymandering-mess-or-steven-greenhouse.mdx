  With Texas Republicans rushing to fulfil Donald Trump’s wish to gerrymander to
  the max, many Americans are no doubt wondering why there isn’t some referee to
  stop this hyperpartisan race to the bottom that is poisoning our democracy.
  The supreme court should be the referee that puts a halt to this ugly,
  undemocratic mess, but in a shortsighted, 5-4 ruling in 2019, the court’s
  conservative majority essentially told state legislatures that anything goes
  when it comes to gerrymandering. Their message was: no matter how extreme the
  gerrymandering, we’ll look the other way. Writing the majority opinion in that
  case, Rucho v Common Cause, chief justice John Roberts declared that
  gerrymandering was a political matter that federal courts shouldn’t intervene
  in (unless it involves racial discrimination). Many legal experts said the
  conservative justices were defaulting on the court’s responsibility to prevent
  absurdly unfair, undemocratic elections, where the fix is in even before
  people vote. In a prescient dissent, justice Elena Kagan warned that the huge
  permission slip the court was giving to gerrymandering would encourage “a
  politics of polarization and dysfunction” and might “irreparably damage our
  system of government”. Trump and his team have been shrewd enough and
  shameless enough to seek to take maximum advantage of that ruling, and in
  doing so, they’re showing how right Kagan was. Trump and company are seriously
  damaging our system of government and our democracy by seeking to insulate
  Trump from the majority’s will, an expected Democratic-leaning vote in the
  2026 congressional elections. Trump and team are also ratcheting up the
  “polarization and dysfunction” Kagan warned us about. Democratic lawmakers
  have fled Texas to prevent a GOP power grab, while Texas governor Greg Abbott
  has called for their arrest and removal from office. Gerrymandering further
  fuels polarization because November elections become largely irrelevant for
  choosing candidates. With gerrymandering, what counts are the party primaries,
  and there, the extremes, rather than moderate swing voters, determine who the
  winning candidate is. This in turn leads to increasingly polarized,
  dysfunctional legislative bodies, like the House of Representatives, where
  there’s plenty of performative, partisan showboating and very little
  legislation passed. In Rucho, the conservative majority declined to overturn a
  gerrymander in which the North Carolina GOP had rigged congressional districts
  so that Republicans would win 10 of the state’s 13 House seats even when the
  GOP won a bare majority of the statewide vote. (The case also involved some
  flagrant gerrymandering by Maryland’s Democrats.) It’s thanks to Roberts and
  the conservative justices’ indifference to gerrymandering that a person close
  to Trump could say that the administration’s attitude was “Maximum warfare,
  everywhere, all the time”. Seeking to maximize the chances of maintaining
  Republican control of the House, where the GOP has a mere three-seat majority,
  many Republicans also want GOP-led legislatures in Missouri, Florida, Ohio and
  Indiana to gerrymander to the max. In Texas alone, Trump hopes the GOP can
  pick up five House seats through redistricting. Even though Trump beat former
  vice-president Kamala Harris by 56% to 42% in Texas in 2024, the newly
  unveiled gerrymander aims to guarantee Republicans 30 out of Texas’s 38 House
  seats (a 79% to 21% ratio). Democrats accuse Trump and the Texas GOP of
  cheating, and it should be no surprise that they want to respond to fire with
  fire, with the Democratic governors of California, Illinois and New York
  saying that they, too, will push through gerrymanders. This unseemly electoral
  arms race results directly from the supreme court’s dodging of responsibility.
  In Rucho, chief justice Roberts shrugged at gerrymandering, saying that
  redistricting shenanigans were part and parcel of US history. Pointing to
  examples of gerrymandering from the 1780s and early 1800s, Roberts pooh-poohed
  this phenomenon, writing: “Partisan gerrymandering is nothing new. Nor is
  frustration with it.” He also voiced skepticism and snark about judges’ use of
  standards and election experts’ predictions to determine when partisan
  redistricting crosses the line into unconstitutional gerrymandering that
  violates the 14th amendment’s equal protection clause. In contrast to Roberts’
  who-cares casualness, justice Kagan was an I’m-warning-you Cassandra. In a
  stinging dissent joined by justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and
  Sonia Sotomayor, she correctly predicted that terrible things would result
  from Roberts’s decision. She wrote that his opinion showed “a saddening
  nonchalance about the threat that such [extreme] redistricting posts to
  self-governance”. Kagan didn’t mince her words about how Roberts’s decision
  threatened our democracy and undermined the ability of Americans to elect a
  government of their choosing. “For the first time ever,” she wrote, “this
  Court refuses to remedy a constitutional violation because it thinks the task
  beyond judicial capabilities. And not just any constitutional violation. The
  partisan gerrymanders in these cases deprived citizens of the most fundamental
  of their constitutional rights: the rights to participate equally in the
  political process, to join with others to advance political beliefs, and to
  choose their political representatives. In so doing, the partisan gerrymanders
  here debased and dishonored our democracy, turning upside down the core
  American idea that all governmental power derives from the people.” In Rucho,
  Roberts wrote that the constitution neither expressly bans gerrymandering, nor
  points to a standard to determine when partisan redistricting is so unfair
  that it becomes unconstitutional. He suggested it would be a grievous,
  arbitrary wrong to select some legal or mathematical standard to determine
  when gerrymanders are illegal. Roberts wrote: “There are no legal standards
  discernible in the Constitution for making such judgments, let alone limited
  and precise standards that are clear, manageable, and politically neutral.”
  Today’s headlines make clear that Roberts and his Rucho decision have left us
  with a far more grievous wrong. It has encouraged ultra-partisan
  gerrymandering that is sabotaging our democracy and the majority will – in
  this case with an eye to preventing Democrats from winning back control of the
  House and serving as a check on Trump, the most authoritarian president in US
  history. If Texas Republicans prevail and enact their gerrymander, despite
  Democratic lawmakers’ exodus from the state, then the votes of millions of
  Texas Democrats will become meaningless, their votes in effect erased by the
  Trump/GOP gerrymander juggernaut. The same thing will happen to many
  Republican voters in states where Democrats gerrymander. Roberts was
  dismayingly myopic in failing to realize how his Rucho decision would someday
  lead to a push for maximum, hyperpartisan redistricting and how new electoral
  and computer models would make gerrymandering far more sophisticated – and
  sinister. Roberts was flatly wrong when he wrote that there can’t be “clear,
  manageable, and politically neutral” standards that define when redistricting
  crosses the line from mere partisanship to over-the-top, undemocratic, grossly
  unfair ultra-partisanship. One study put forward a smart standard that says
  gerrymandering crosses the line into illegality when a certain, high
  percentage of votes are wasted, deliberately rendered meaningless through
  partisan redistricting. What we’re seeing right now in Texas is one political
  party seeking to squeeze every last drop out of a filthy gerrymandering sponge
  – fair play and democracy be damned. Foreseeing ugly episodes like this, Kagan
  cited the vision of James Madison, the main author of the constitution, who
  once wrote that the “power is in the people over the Government, and not in
  the Government over the people”. The whole purpose of Trump’s gerrymandering
  power grab is to prevent the people from having power over him and his
  increasingly unpopular government. Unfortunately, Roberts gave Trump a green
  light for such a power grab. Like Trump, Roberts hates admitting mistakes, but
  it’s not too late for him to admit how shortsighted and harmful his Rucho
  ruling was. Nor is it too late for the chief justice to get the court to set
  some sane, healthy limits on gerrymandering to safeguard our democracy as well
  as Madison’s vision that the “power is in the people over the Government”.
