  My father, Alan Keys, who has died aged 78, was a water quality campaigner. He
  not only highlighted the problem of the UK’s polluted rivers, but tried to
  find a way to revitalise them. He transformed himself from an intensive
  poultry farmer into a conservationist, and his innovative use of non-invasive
  comfrey plants to clean agricultural runoff offered hope for farmers and
  rivers alike. Born in Fivemiletown, Co Tyrone, Northern Ireland, to Jack, a
  Methodist minister, and his wife, Lila (nee Gilpin), Alan went to Belfast
  boys’ model school. After studying at what is now CAFRE, the College of
  Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise, Loughry, he built up a successful
  poultry business just outside Cookstown. Like most farmers at that time, he
  spread nutrient-rich chicken litter across the fields and was unaware that the
  practice was helping to choke aquatic life downstream from the nearby
  Ballinderry River, which feeds into Lough Neagh. Later, from his observations
  as an angler, he began to realise the extent of the problem. By the 1980s the
  Ballinderry was beginning to die, and was hit by successive pollution events.
  In 1984 Alan helped to found the Ballinderry River Enhancement Association
  (BREA), which brought together angling clubs to identify pollution hotspots,
  restore habitats and conserve wildlife. In 1995 he made the decision to give
  up farming to work in river enhancement full-time. He became the manager at
  BREA, which evolved into Ballinderry Rivers Trust (BRT) and although he
  retired officially in 2018, he continued to work for it on a voluntary basis
  for the rest of his life. His philosophy was elegantly simple: “Think like a
  fish.” When developing conservation strategies throughout his career, he would
  first ask: “What would the fish want?” He was well known for his systematic
  approach, checking water quality at bridge after bridge, and he used simple
  logic and observation to track down pollution sources. His frequent calls
  reporting pollution to the Northern Ireland Environment Agency earned him the
  affectionate nickname “AK47” – a play on his initials and birth year. While
  others pursued hi-tech solutions, Alan championed much simpler approaches: the
  BRT led a team that looked for innovative ideas to clean up the dirty water
  that ran from farmyards to the nearest stream, and from 2021 to 2023 ran a
  project on comfrey, a hardy perennial that could absorb excess nutrients while
  providing farmers with valuable silage or fertiliser. Among his achievements
  was protecting the globally endangered freshwater pearl mussel in the
  Ballinderry River; they are an “indicator species”, one of the first to be
  affected by poor water quality. The trust set up “sanctuaries” at carefully
  chosen locations. Alan was made MBE in 1994 for his conservation work. He is
  survived by his wife, Libby (nee Campbell), whom he married in 1969, their
  children, Clare, David and me, and his grandchildren, Joseph and Tilly.
