  The lights go down on the catwalk, as the voice of Witiyana Marika of Yothu
  Yindi calls out over the sound system, singing bush wallaby manikay
  (traditional song) in Yolŋu matha. Then Marika’s first-born grandchild, Yolŋu
  model and Vogue cover star Magnolia Maymuru, dances on to the runway’s red
  carpet, wallaby-style. The lights go up, revealing Cassie Leatham’s Matriarchs
  Circles of Life gown, a New Look-style silhouette the Taungurung and Dja Dja
  Wurrung artist of the Kulin nation created using scrap fabrics and a
  traditional coil weaving technique. As Maymuru walks slowly, proudly, down the
  runway, the song shifts to Kev Carmody and Paul Kelly’s This Land is Mine, a
  ballad of intertwined perspectives – a settler-colonial one, in which Country
  can be bought and owned, and an Aboriginal one in which Country and self are
  inextricably connected. We’re on Larrakia country, Garramilla/Darwin, for
  Country to Couture, the annual showcase of First Nations fashion and textiles.
  The show’s powerful opening encapsulates everything that makes Country to
  Couture unlike any other fashion event in Australia. It’s the sense of
  cross-generational relationships; the sense of community and kinship; the
  celebration of culture and connection to Country; the focus on caring for the
  environment. Over the evening, 20 collections by First Nations designers and
  artists – ranging from debuts to more established labels such as Magpie Goose
  and Delvene Cockatoo-Collins – are showcased by First Nations models, to an
  entirely First Nations soundtrack. When Malyangapa Barkindji rapper Barkaa
  hits the runway mid-show and sings “this is my fuckin house” (as her mother,
  award-winning jewellery designer Cleonie Quayle, watches on from the front
  row), you really feel it. The next morning Maymuru tells me she was in tears
  just moments before the show opened. Waiting to walk, she’d peeped a
  retrospective slideshow on the big screens either side of the runway, and seen
  photos of herself at the very first Country to Couture in 2016. It was her
  first time on the runway, aged 19. “It all came flooding back,” says the
  model. “The tears just started flowing.” • Sign up for our rundown of
  must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning
  Maymuru wasn’t only thinking of her own journey. “There’s been such a big
  shift [in the fashion industry] since I started out back in 2016; a huge wave
  of First Nations fashion and models,” she says. “To be a part of a generation
  where we made a huge movement that changed the nation – [and] to be a part of
  it from the beginning right up until now – it was just an incredible feeling.”
  Country to Couture, now in its 10th year, has been a vital part of that
  movement: the first and largest showcase of First Nations fashion. But Country
  to Couture has always been as much about art as apparel. Started by Darwin
  Aboriginal art fair (DAAF) in response to the demands of participating arts
  centres – most of them in remote communities – it has consistently
  foregrounded collaborations between artists and fashion designers. At the
  heart of it all is Country and culture, says the DAAF artistic director, Simon
  Carmichael, a Ngugi man from Quandamooka Country in south-east Queensland.
  “Across all of the different art forms, whether it’s performance or fashion or
  design … these stories are brought to life in really impactful and vibrant
  ways that enable people to connect with the stories and learn more.” Michelle
  Maynard, a Tasmanian Aboriginal designer and manager of Indigenous Fashion
  Projects, which runs Country to Couture, says the event is “not trying to
  replicate the mainstream fashion industry”. “That’s there for people if their
  aspirations lie in the commercial landscape,” she says. “But I think the
  greater percentage of our participants’ aspirations aren’t.” “We’re kind of
  carving out our own shape of how we want to participate in fashion.” Maymuru,
  who has walked runways across Australia, says Country to Couture is unlike any
  other. “It’s promoting the remote,” she says. “You get to see people’s
  identities; you see who they are in their designs. You hear their stories.
  Each and every single one of us have our own totems, our own songlines, our
  own Country. And we tell these stories through art and through fashion – and
  DAAF allows us to show it to the world. I just think that’s amazing.” She
  closed this year’s first runway show in a cape featuring hand-painted designs
  by artists from Bula’Bula Arts in the remote Yolŋu community of Ramingining in
  north-east Arnhem Land. “That cape actually represented the art centre, the
  people, the land,” says Maymuru. “I was very honoured to wear it.” Before the
  show, she met two of the artists backstage, and discovered a connection with
  one of them through the Yolŋu kinship system. “Turns out I call the designer
  grandad! It was just such a special moment,” she says. It was Bula’Bula’s
  third Country to Couture and second year collaborating with Darwin fashion
  designer Marcia Russell, AKA Black Cat Couture. Usually the artists work in
  traditional forms of weaving and painting using natural materials, and Angela
  Banyawarra, whose paintings of Gumang (magpie geese) – one of her totems –
  featured in the collection, says there is a “freedom” in painting traditional
  designs in a new medium. The main goal, however, is sharing ancient stories:
  “The way we paint comes from where we come from and where we belong.” Painting
  garments is a way to “show everyone what it’s all about”, Banyawarra says. For
  people in Ramingining, meanwhile, wearing clothes featuring their traditional
  designs and totems, is empowering. “It’s good for the Indigenous young ladies
  to wear it … we feel proud,” Banyawarra says. Eunice Yu, a Yawuru and Bunuba
  woman and manager of Nagula Jarndu, a women’s arts and resource centre in
  Broome that was part of Country to Couture’s first year, talks about “mabu
  liyan”, a Yawuru concept that “embodies this whole sense of feeling good about
  everything that you do”. The women working with Nagula Jarndu want to see
  their art on clothes because “it’s something you can wear and it makes you
  feel good”, she says. “Some things are out of your control, but we want to be
  able to feel good all of the time.” This year, Nagula Jarndu partnered with
  Saheli Women, a like-minded social enterprise based in Rajasthan, India,
  bringing together Yawuru designs with Indian block-printing, embroidery and
  natural dyeing techniques to produce a collection of loose, flowing dresses
  and casual pants and tops. As with all Nagula Jarndu’s collections, the
  artists will earn commission from selling their clothes. The centre,
  meanwhile, used the partnership with Saheli, an established atelier, to expand
  their thinking around financially and environmentally sustainable models
  within fashion. “We don’t want to contribute to the big waste management
  issues [in fashion],” Yu says. “We’re going to look at sustainable ways of
  producing and manufacturing.” Magpie Goose, a fashion label and social
  enterprise based in Magandjin/Meanjin/Brisbane, is also driven by the cultural
  and economic empowerment of the artists it works with. For every collection,
  the label partners with a different arts centre or collective for its prints,
  and so far it has raised more than $700,000 in royalties for these artists.
  “Artists and stories are the focus,” says co-owner Amanda Hayman, a Wakka
  Wakka and Kalkadoon woman and artist. “Fashion is just a platform.” For this
  year’s Country to Couture – their second – they debuted a collaboration with a
  collective of Quandamooka artists including 2025 Natsiaa finalist Elisa Jane
  Carmichael. Hayman says fashion is a tough business and “definitely not a
  money maker”. Although Magpie Goose is more of “a love project”, she says “it
  does create impact for the remote communities that we work with”. “It’s also
  beautiful to see the artworks transformed into this other thing – and for the
  artists, to see other people wearing their story is really special.” • Dee
