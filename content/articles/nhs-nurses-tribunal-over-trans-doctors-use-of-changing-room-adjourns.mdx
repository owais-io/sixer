  The employment tribunal brought by a NHS Fife nurse who objected to sharing a
  changing room with a transgender woman has adjourned ahead of closing
  submissions to be heard in September. Sandie Peggie, who has worked as a nurse
  for more than 30 years, is claiming she was subject to unlawful harassment
  under the Equality Act when she was expected to share a changing room with Dr
  Beth Upton. The tribunal heard a further two weeks of witness evidence
  concluding on Tuesday. It is being watched closely for how it may be
  influenced by April’s landmark judgment by the supreme court, which ruled the
  legal definition of a woman in the Equality Act 2010 did not include
  transgender women who held gender recognition certificates. The ruling has
  been publicly welcomed by Peggie and her supporters. In earlier evidence,
  Peggie said she had felt “embarrassed and intimidated” when Upton started to
  get changed alongside her, leading to a heated exchange on Christmas Eve in
  2023, the details of which are disputed. NHS Fife has previously described
  Peggie’s action as “unnecessary and vexatious”. Upton is also disputing it.
  Recalled to give evidence a second time on Tuesday, Peggie told her lawyer
  Naomi Cunningham that a number of other women shared her concerns about Upton
  but were reluctant to come forward because of the “very toxic” situation with
  the health board. She named 13 NHS Fife workers including receptionists and a
  consultant who agreed that a transgender woman should not be using the women’s
  changing rooms. Peggie was also questioned about allegations made by
  colleagues who previously gave evidence that she used racist slurs in chat
  messages and described Upton as a “weirdo”. Defending comments about flooding
  in Pakistan as “dark humour”, she also admitted she had used racial slurs but
  said she was “brought up like that”, and that it was not a “politically
  correct way”. She said when she asked for a photograph of Upton and used the
  phrase “that weirdo”, it was a picture from a night out “where he looked like
  a man in a dress”. Under questioning by Jane Russell KC, representing Upton
  and NHS Fife, she denied “waging a hate campaign against Dr Upton”. Peggie
  told the tribunal: “I don’t have any bad feelings about trans people, I just
  don’t believe they should be in the women’s changing room. I still believe a
  trans woman is a man and shouldn’t be in the female changing room.” Peggie was
  suspended after she complained about having to share a changing room with
  Upton at the hospital on Christmas Eve in 2023. She was then placed on special
  leave and later suspended after Upton made an allegation of bullying and
  harassment and cited concerns about “patient care”. At the start of the second
  evidence hearing, NHS Fife confirmed Peggie had been cleared of the separate
  gross misconduct allegations after an 18-month internal process. Earlier in
  evidence, Gillian Malone, the head of nursing at NHS Fife, told the tribunal
  she could not recall seeing the risk assessment that led to Peggie’s
  suspension. Last week, the two senior lawyers clashed after Russell argued
  that Peggie’s legal team were “confusing” those giving evidence by referring
  to the doctor as “he” and “him” and “creating a hostile environment for my
  witnesses”. In January, the employment judge Sandy Kemp rejected an NHS Fife
  request to impose an order preventing the use of male pronouns or terms to
  refer to Upton, concluding it was “unfair” to ask Peggie and her lawyers to
  use terms they consider “inaccurate”.
