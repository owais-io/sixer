  ‘It felt magical’: monarch butterfly swarm delights visitors and locals in
  Western Australia town

  Lounging on the tulips, roosting in the eucalyptus, humming around the
  bottlebrush – a butterfly swarm has invaded a rural Australian town to the
  delight of locals and tourists alike. Thousands of monarch butterflies have
  taken over Nannup, in south-west Western Australia, although experts warn
  their high numbers are evidence of the advance of invasive weeds.
  Horticulturalist Colin Barlow said the butterflies, which have a life cycle of
  about six weeks once hatched, feed as larvae on one of two weeds, varieties of
  cotton bush and milkweed, which are prevalent in surrounding pine plantations.
  “The reason why it was so good this year is because they had a very good food
  source,” he said. Barlow said the species is one of few that can eat the
  plants, adding that the monarch’s distinctive, bright orange colouring is a
  warning of their potential toxicity. “There’s only a couple of species of
  birds that can actually eat the butterflies.” Sign up: AU Breaking News email
  But the adult butterflies are also interested in other plant species. Maggie
  Longmore, who runs Nannup’s annual flower and garden festival in August, said
  they were particularly drawn to the tulips, as well as native bottlebrush and
  eucalyptus plants. “It has been an added attraction for the festival,” she
  said. “It’s gone a bit viral on social media … People have been coming to see
  the butterflies and the tulips. “I’ve lived in Nannup for 25 years. We see a
  few butterflies around, but this year they’re in the thousands.” The window
  has also been particularly long this year – more than two months, Longmore
  estimates. Burana Skelton, from Mandurah to the north, was driving through
  Nannup with her family during the July school holidays when they started to
  notice the insects. “We were, like, counting the butterflies as we were
  driving down the main street, going: ‘Oh, there’s one, two.’ And we got up to
  20,” she said. “As we got further down towards the little local park area … it
  was literally covered in [them]. “My husband and the kids got out the car … We
  had all our windows down and even the dogs were looking at it.” Monarch
  butterflies are native to North America and are believed to have been blown
  across to Australia via the Pacific islands during cyclonic weather in the
  early 1870s. Barlow says the species only took hold in the last 30 years when
  the invasive weeds also gained a footing, describing the situation as “a
  delicate balance”, but still “a beautiful sight”. “What we recommend is people
  to control the milkweed and the cotton bush inside of bushland areas, and in
  and around roadsides, so it doesn’t spread.” Skelton said the phenomenon’s
  complicated backstory did not detract from its beauty. “It’s hard to put into
  words,” she said. “It felt magical.” • This article was amended on 19 August
