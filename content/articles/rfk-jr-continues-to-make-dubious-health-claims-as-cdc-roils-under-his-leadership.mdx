  In a week of chaos at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Donald
  Trump’s health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has continued to make
  questionable medical and health claims – and has been slammed for them by
  experts and lawmakers alike. In recent days, Kennedy has been facing
  increasing calls for his resignation following the Trump administration’s
  firing of the CDC director, Susan Monarez, which in turn prompted four other
  top officials to quit the agency. The chaos across US health agencies also
  comes as Kennedy released a slew of controversial and contradictory rules
  surrounding Covid-19 vaccines. On top of all this turmoil, Kennedy has also
  met with significant backlash for a handful of outlandish remarks and
  revelations, which have only fueled the controversy surrounding his leadership
  at the health department. After the deadly mass school shooting in Minneapolis
  this week where two children were killed and 17 others injured, Kennedy
  suggested that psychiatric drugs may be contributing to the rise in gun
  violence across the country. During an appearance on Fox &amp; Friends, the
  host Brian Kilmeade asked Kennedy if the health department was investigating
  whether medications used to treat gender dysphoria might be linked to school
  shootings. According to court documents reviewed by the Guardian, the
  23-year-old shooter, Robin Westman, had changed their birth name from Robert
  to Robin because they identified as a woman. In response to Kilmeade’s
  question, Kennedy, without acknowledging the prevalence and easy accessibility
  of firearms across the US – said that his department was “launching studies on
  the potential contribution of some of the SSRI [selective serotonin reuptake
  inhibitors] drugs and some of the other psychiatric drugs that might be
  contributing to violence”. Kennedy’s comments triggered criticism from the
  Minnesota senator Tina Smith, who took to X and wrote: “I dare you to go to
  Annunciation School and tell our grieving community, in effect, guns don’t
  kill kids, antidepressants do. Just shut up. Stop peddling bullshit. You
  should be fired.” This week, Kennedy also suggested that he could identify
  “mitochondrial challenges” in children at airports just by looking at them.
  Speaking at an event in Texas alongside the state’s governor, Greg Abbott,
  Kennedy claimed: “I’m looking at kids as I walk through the airports today, as
  I walk down the street, and I see these kids that are just overburdened with
  mitochondrial challenges, with inflammation. You can tell from their faces,
  from their body movements, and from their lack of social connection. And I
  know that that’s not how our children are supposed to look.” In response,
  Ashish Jha, former White House Covid-19 response coordinator under the Biden
  administration, said: “I’m sorry but what?” “This is wacky, flat-earth, voodoo
  stuff, people. This is not normal,” Jha added on X. Then, in a revelation on
  Thursday, Demetre Daskalakis – who recently resigned as director of the
  National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases in protest of
  Monarez’s firing – revealed that Kennedy had never been briefed by CDC experts
  before making major public health decisions. Speaking to CNN, Daskalakis said:
  “I think that another important thing to ask the secretary is, has he been
  briefed by a CDC expert on anything, specifically measles, Covid-19, flu? I
  think that people should ask him that in that hearing,” referring to Kennedy’s
  upcoming hearing before the Senate finance committee. Upon being asked what
  Kennedy’s answer would be, Daskalakis said: “The answer is ‘no’. No one from
  my center has ever briefed him on any of those topics … He’s getting
  information from somewhere, but that information is not coming from CDC
  experts.” In a separate statement to the Daily Beast, Daskalakis said: “It’s
  not just that he hasn’t asked us. I asked for us to be able to do briefings,
  and I was told by his office of the secretary officials, some of whom are now
  fired, that they would be happy to have us do briefings, that they would reach
  out to be able to set them up. They’ve never done so.” Since he assumed
  leadership over the health department, Kennedy – a longtime anti-vaccine
  advocate – has fired health agency workers and entertained conspiracy
  theories. Last week, more than 750 current and former employees at US health
  agencies signed a letter in which they criticized Kennedy as an “existential
  threat to public health”. The health agency workers went on to accuse Kennedy
  of being “complicit in dismantling America’s public health infrastructure and
  endangering the nation’s health by repeatedly spreading inaccurate health
  information”. The letter comes after a deadly shooting at the CDC headquarters
  in Atlanta earlier this month, when a 30-year-old gunman fired more than 180
  rounds into the buildings, killing a police officer before dying from a
  self-inflicted gunshot wound. According to the gunman’s father, the shooter
  had been struggling with mental health issues and was influenced by
  misinformation that led him to believe the Covid-19 vaccine was making him
  sick.
