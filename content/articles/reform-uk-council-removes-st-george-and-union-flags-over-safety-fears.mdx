  A Reform-led council has started to remove flags and bunting displaying the St
  George’s cross and the union flag after concerns were raised that they could
  cause accidents. Durham county council issued a statement on X on Friday
  saying that while the council “understand and respect the community’s desire
  to express national pride, celebration, or remembrance, it is important to
  ensure such expressions do not compromise public safety”. The council claimed
  it had been “left with no choice but to remove bunting” after a risk
  assessment found that “rope involved was so strong that, had a high-sided
  vehicle driven into it, the poles it was attached to could have been pulled
  down”. The statement said the council’s “priority remains ensuring the safety
  and integrity of the highway network, while being mindful of, and responsive
  to, the communities we serve”. It encouraged residents “to consider safer and
  more appropriate locations for flags or other displays that do not involve
  highway infrastructure and conform to all appropriate standards and
  regulations”. In the past few weeks there has been increasing controversy over
  the number of flags being flown in towns across England. Some say it is simply
  a show of national pride and patriotism, while others argue the swell of
  interest in flying flags is linked to the far right and anti-migrant
  sentiment. Instances of vandalism have been recorded, including red lines
  being spray-painted on to white roundabouts to replicate the St George’s
  cross. Councils throughout the country have responded in different ways. Some,
  such as Lib Dem-run Hertfordshire council and Labour-run Brighton council have
  said that they will remove flags, with Brighton saying that “when it comes to
  items attached to lamp-posts or defaced roundabouts, it is normal council
  procedure for these to be removed on a regular basis, in line with our health
  and safety obligations”. Darren Grimes, a political commentator who is the
  deputy leader of Durham county council and a member of Reform UK, has
  repeatedly commented on his X account about flags being flown in England,
  including a video with the caption: “This isn’t just flying a flag. It’s the
  start of the fightback.” The Reform MP Lee Anderson has also posted frequently
  about his desire for more flags to be flown around the country, including a
  post on Monday showing a letter he had written to the government five years
  ago, with the caption: “It’s nearly 5 years ago since I wrote to the last
  government to ask for the Union flag to be flown from every single public
  building in the UK. I’m still waiting for an answer.” Other posts from Grimes
  in the past month include him expressing support for union flags being hung
  from a bridge, while criticising the flying of Pakistani, Palestinian and
  LGBTQ+ pride flags throughout the country. The topic has attracted comment and
  debate beyond Britain, with the tech mogul and outspoken Reform UK supporter
  Elon Musk posting a St George’s cross to his X feed on Tuesday and the US
  vice-president, JD Vance, urging people in the UK to “push back against
  crazies” who criticise the flag-flying. The prime minister, Keir Starmer, has
  not commented on the recent flag debate, but was candid about his views on the
  line between patriotism and nationalism during a briefing on St George’s Day
  in April of this year. He said: “I do understand the fight over the flag … but
  that’s why we’ve got to reclaim it. It belongs to all of us.”
