  We share the concerns of the Runnymede Trust and the Joint Council for the
  Welfare of Immigrants that the proposal to allow police to reveal the
  ethnicity and migration status of crime suspects has scant regard for
  community safety (Campaigners criticise UK plans to reveal suspects’ ethnicity
  and migration status, 10 August). After another summer of far-right
  discontent, the Institute of Race Relations, which monitors national
  developments, is concerned about the focus in some communities on vigilante
  justice, often justified in terms of hunting down paedophiles. The danger is
  that local punishment squads could deal out their own form of summary justice
  against anyone perceived to be an asylum seeker or a foreign criminal, with
  the colour of their skin marking them out for retribution. Liz Fekete
  Director, Institute of Race Relations • It is not surprising that the police
  have been given new official guidance to issue information about the ethnicity
  of suspects (New guidance for UK police on releasing suspects’ ethnicity and
  migration status, 13 August). It is astonishing, however, that the debate
  continues without any acknowledgment that the very attempt to classify people
  by racial origin is a founding principle of the worst governments of the past
  century. Urged to self-classify, as we are in many official forms for
  seemingly good reasons, no one seems prepared to say simply that the very
  attempt to classify people by “racial origin” is in itself an abhorrent first
  step on the road to apartheid, “remigration” and worse. John Stubbs Bridport,
  Dorset • The nonsensical notion of “transparency” has raised its ideologically
  loaded head again in the latest front to be opened up in the culture wars
  (Routinely disclosing the ethnicity of police suspects is a very dangerous
  step to take, 13 August). If “transparency” is really the most important
  motivating factor here rather, than, say, appeasement of unpleasant far‑right
  views, surely the annual earnings of the accused, or their highest level of
  educational attainment, would be more significant in helping to portray a
  profile of those who are accused or suspected of criminal activity. Eddie
