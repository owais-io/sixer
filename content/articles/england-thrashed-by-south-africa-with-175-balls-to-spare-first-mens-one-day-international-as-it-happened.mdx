  Simon Burnton was at Headingley for us today; I’ll leave you with his report.
  Night night. It’s not really night, is it. Temba Bavuma’s verdict It’s very
  important to start well and continue the momentum from Australia. We were
  clinical with the ball; I don’t think you can fault the bowlers much. It’s a
  quick turnaround between games. We want to build on the momentum and keep
  pushing our standards up. Not ideal. Not a great start to the series – one of
  those bad days and we have to move on as soon as possible. We couldn’t get a
  partnership together and everyone had a bad day apart from Smudge. [What style
  do you want your team to play?] Go out there and bang it, get as many runs as
  possible and then look to take wickets throughout. Simple as that really. I
  thought we bowled nicely. Sonny Baker got a little bit of tap at the start but
  the way he kept trucking in, giving 100 per cent, was awesome to see. That’s
  exactly what we ask for from our bowlers. We almost used it as a practice
  session towards the end when we knew the game was kind of dead. It was good to
  see lads putting their skills into practice. We have to put that performance
  behind us and crack on when we get to London. The player of the match is
  Keshav Maharaj We know England play really well in their own conditions but we
  carried a lot of momentum from [the win in Australia]. We’re in a wonderful
  space, finding some rhythm and combinations. We’re still in transition though.
  On Sky Sports, Mark Butcher is eloquently taking England’s performance apart.
  They are a pretty poor white-ball team; have been for a long time. That’s
  England’s tenth heaviest ODI defeat by balls remaining. The highest was at
  Gros Islet in 2019, when West Indies won with 227 deliveries to spare. England
  won the World Cup a few months later, so you can start tapping your nose right
  now, if you’re into all that. 20.5 overs: South Africa 137-3 (Rickelton 31,
  Brevis 6) Dewald Brevis defends the hat-trick ball, then clubs his second for
  six to remind everyone what time it is – and complete a brutal victory.
  Tristan Stubbs misses a reverse-sweep and is bowled. Adil Rashid looks almost
  disgusted as his teammates come to congratulate him; he finds himself on a
  hat-trick in the strangest circumstances. SOUTH AFRICA ARE CHOKING LIKE NEVER
  BEFORE. Bavuma, trying to seal the match with a boundary, slices Rashid high
  in the air and is caught by Jacks running round from mid-off. England are back
  in it! 20th over: South Africa 131-1 (Rickelton 31, Bavuma 6) The game is done
  but Brook still charges after the ball from mid-off to save a boundary. One to
  win. 19th over: South Africa 125-1 (Rickelton 28, Bavuma 4) The new batter
  Temba Bavuma blasts Rashid high towards long on. Jacob Bethell slips while
  trying to get into position for the catch and the ball plops miserably to the
  turf. Seven more to win. No hundred for Aiden Markram. Jamie Smith has taken a
  spectacular catch in the covers, diving full length to his right to grab the
  ball one-handed. Markram tried to lash Rashid over the top for another
  boundary but didn’t quite get enough elevation. The umpires go upstairs to
  check whether Smith grounded the ball upon landing. It looks like he managed
  to twist his wrist just in time. Yep, the third umpire concludes it was a
  clean catch and Markram has gone for an imperious 55-ball 86. Remember when he
  was the poster boy for unfulfilled potential? 17th over: South Africa 121-0
  (Markram 86, Rickelton 28) Carse replaces Baker, who will finish a bruising
  debut with figures of 7-0-76-0. That’s the game. Markram hoicks another short
  ball to the midwicket boundary before taking a single on the off side. He
  could yet make a hundred, which would be quite something when your team is
  chasing only 132. South Africa need 11, Markram needs 14. 16th over: South
  Africa 114-0 (Markram 79, Rickelton 28) Markram edges an excellent legbreak
  from Rashid for four, then panels another boundary through the covers. In
  other news, the floodlights are on. Does that count as a moral victory for
  England. “Wellington 2015 was another corker,” writes our good friend Mike
  Selvey. And he would know. 16th over: South Africa 103-0 (Markram 69,
  Rickelton 27) A short ball from Baker is clobbered over midwicket for four by
  Markram, who is batting offensively well. Many a debutant bowler has been
  taken apart by a high-class batter. Shane Warne v Ravi Shastri, Tom Hartley v
  Yashasvi Jaiswal and so on. But this is right up there – Markram has hit Baker
  for 57 from 32 balls, I think. 15th over: South Africa 95-0 (Markram 63,
  Rickelton 25) Adil Rashid comes on for Brydon Carse and is milked for a few.
  “I do wonder whether Bethell has been put in a near impossible position - he
  just hasn’t had time to learn the game, and to be honest has looked way off it
  all summer,” says Felix Wood. “To be expectee to learn the game at
  international level before you’ve even scored a first class century is a steep
  ask. To be asked to captain on top of that...I don’t think it’s going to work.
  He should be given time to get up to speed and looked at again in a few years.
  Maybe Root could talk to him about the benefits of that...” He’s only
  captaining for a few games against Ireland so I’d have no concerns about that.
  I agree he should have played more cricket this summer though, and right now I
  wouldn’t fancy him to make runs in an Ashes Test. But almost all young players
  have a dip after their initial success, so this might have happened anyway. In
  the medium term I have no concerns whatsoever about him; if he doesn’t make
  it, we might as well all pack up and go home. 14th over: South Africa 90-0
  (Markram 59, Rickelton 25) A sharp bumper from Baker is top-edged fine for
  four by Rickelton. Markram then picks a slower ball and cuffs it wide of
  Bethell for another boundary. It was in the air but safe enough. Baker will
  soon have the most expensive figures by an England bowler on their ODI debut,
  passing Liam Dawson (8-0-70-2) against Pakistan in 2016. 13th over: South
  Africa 80-0 (Markram 54, Rickelton 20) There have been 37.3 overs in this game
  and it’s almost over. 12th over: South Africa 78-0 (Markram 53, Rickelton 19)
  Harry Brook invites Sonny Baker to get back on the horse, bringing him back at
  the Kirkstall Lane End to replace Jofra Archer (5-1-7-0). Baker pulls his
  length back, hits a tight line and bowls five successive dot balls to Markram.
  A wide is followed by a genuine edge for a single. In the circumstances that’s
  an admirable comeback from Baker. There’s no mineral deficiency in this kid.
  11th over: South Africa 76-0 (Markram 52, Rickelton 19) Rickelton drags a
  Carse short ball through midwicket for four. Markram is then caught at mid-on,
  but only from a free hit after a no-ball from Carse. Believe it or not,
  England have suffered more brutal ODI defeats than this. Ask our old friend
  Lawrence Booth. 10th over: South Africa 67-0 (Markram 51, Rickelton 12) Archer
  slips one fuller to beat Rickelton’s attempted drive. In different
  circumstances we’d be purring about this opening spell from Archer; he’s been
  all over Rickelton like a cheap cliche. 9th over: South Africa 65-0 (Markram
  50, Rickelton 11) Sonny Baker is taken out of the attack after a bruising
  spell of 4-0-56-0. Brydon Carse replaces him and concedes only a couple from
  his first over. South Africa need 67 from 246 balls to win!! 8th over: South
  Africa 63-0 (Markram 50, Rickelton 10) Archer zips one past Markram to end
  another excellent over. His figures are beyond reproach: 4-1-6-0. In fact,
  he’s bowled beautifully. 7th over: South Africa 62-0 (Markram 50, Rickelton 9)
  A full inswinger from Baker is crashed through extra cover by Markram, who is
  batting with the serenity of a man who knows his game inside out. Later in the
  over he drills a sumptuous boundary down the ground, then hammers four more
  off the back foot to bring up a truly majestic fifty from only 23 balls. It’s
  the fastest by a South African opener in an ODI. Baker’s figures (4-0-56-0)
  suggest a debut shocker but I don’t think he’s bowled that badly. He’s a very
  smart kid and will know this is all part of his education, a punishment for
  which he will one day be thankful. That said, I’d love to read Baker’s
  notebook tonight. 6th over: South Africa 50-0 (Markram 38, Rickelton 9)
  England have only once been beaten by 10 wickets in a home ODI. That was
  against India three years ago; a few months later they pumped India by the
  same margin in the World T20 semi-final, so we shouldn’t get carried away
  about a defeat that hasn’t even happened yet. Amid the ruins Archer has bowled
  very well, particularly to the left-handed Rickelton. His figures are 3-1-5-0.
  5th over: South Africa 49-0 (Markram 37, Rickelton 9) Harry Brook gives Sonny
  Baker a third over, echoing Ben Stokes’ approach on Tom Hartley’s Test debut.
  Rickelton hits fours through point and midwicket either side of an edge that
  falls fractionally short of the slips. Baker has bowled some dangerous
  deliveries but South Africa have punished the loose stuff without mercy. The
  result is figures of 3-0-44-0. 4th over: South Africa 38-0 (Markram 36,
  Rickelton 0) Rickelton is beaten by a good ball from Archer. It’s a game of
  two ends – or rather it was until a leg-bye brought the first rotation of
  strike after 22 balls of the innings. Markram treats Archer as he did Baker,
  timing his first ball through midwicket for four. He has vroomed to 36 from
  just 14 balls. 3rd over: South Africa 34-0 (Markram 32, Rickelton 0) This is
  no way to treat a young one. Markram is savaging Sonny Baker: 14 from the
  first over, 20 from the second. A drive for four was followed by a pair of
  sixes, the first sliced over the cordon and the second picked up over square
  leg. Sensational batting. “There’s a bit more blue in the West Yorkshire skies
  just now, so nothing’s expected from the weather in any non-embarrassing
  sense,” says John Starbuck. “I’d like to ask about Sonny Baker, as he sounds
  like a card from Happy Families. Any ideas?” None I’m afraid – I don’t think I
  ever played it. But I do know he calls his dad ‘Bakes’, one of several
  takeaways from a charming interview on Test Match Special a couple of weeks
  ago. I think wrong – Rickelton would have been out had England reviewed. That
  was odd because the umpire turned his nose up at the appeal and England didn’t
  discuss a review. But it pitched on leg stump, straightened sharply and would
  have hit the top of leg. 2nd over: South Africa 14-0 (Markram 14, Rickelton 0)
  A very good maiden from Archer, who loves bowling to left-handers, ends with
  an unsuccessful LBW appeal when Rickelton pushes around a nip-backer. Pitched
  outside leg I think. Rickelton is not out I think that’s a fair decision,
  although there are boos from the crowd. No suggestion that Root cheated by the
  way; part of the ball hit his fingers before bouncing into the palm so you can
  understand why he thought it was a clean catch. Umpire review for a fair catch
  Ryan Rickelton drives Jofra Archer for a crowd catch to Ben Duckett in the
  covers. It even fools the TV director, with WICKET! flashing up on the screen.
  Rickelton then edges Archer very low to Root, who takes the ball at first slip
  and celebrates the wicket. It goes upstairs, with the reply showing te ball
  bouncing into Root’s hand – but it’s not clear whether it bounced on the
  ground or Root’s outstretched fingers. This could go either way. I think it
  hit the ground but I wouldn’t put the farm on it. 1st over: South Africa 14-0
  (Markram 14, Rickelton 0) Sonny Baker’s first over in international cricket is
  taken for 14 runs. His pace was good, in the high 80s, his accuracy a little
  awry and Aiden Markram picked him off for three boundaries: a touch to fine
  leg, a slap over cover point and an accomplished drive from extra cover.
  Welcome to big school. The players are back on the field. Sonny Baker, wearing
  No60, will bowl the first over. Thanks Tanya, evening afternoon everyone. So,
  what are we doing tonight? Unless Sonny Baker or Jofra Archer can summon the
  spirit of Dennis Lillee at the Waca in 1976, this game will be over before a
  floodlight has buzzed into life. It’s been a bad 48 hours for the English
  schedule. First Jamie Overton pulled out of a (probable) Ashes tour, then
  England batted like a team who are all treadmilled out. It is what it is. For
  all England’s issues, we shouldn’t underplay the part of a seriously
  impressive South African side. They’re sixth in the ICC ODI rankings, but
  right now you can make a strong case for them being second only to India. One
  thing’s for sure: right here, right now, they are far too good for England.
  “Is it cowardly to pray for rain?” asks Richard O’Hagan. Heh, heh, I’m going
  to leave that question, and England’s fate, to the safe hands of Rob Smyth.
  Thanks for your (brief) company today. Enjoy Sonny Baker – bye! South Africa,
  meanwhile, were excellent, bowling tidily, catching beautifully. “I’m really
  impressed by how Bavuma has led the side,” says Natalie Germanos, “their plans
  have been good. Maharaj is fantastic, and he’s been fantastic for South Africa
  for a while now, very calm, very helpful to Bavuma.” Well, that was …
  something. England dropping cone, flake and slipping on the vanilla for good
  measure. All out for 131 in 24.3 overs, Carse left high and dry, not out
  three. England’s highest scorer was Jamie Smith with 54 but no-one else made
  more than 15. Through the gate! Baker bends, bat hovering, watchful for his
  first ball in international cricket, and Maharaj fires one through to pop the
  cherry on the cake. Four for 22 for him and England castled in less than 25
  overs. Given out on the field, but Rashid reviews – why not? A third for
  Maharaj who clonks a lunging Rashid on the knee roll. Now for the debutant…
  24th over: England 131-8 (Carse 3, Rashid 9) I’m not sure which way the
  weather is travelling, but the clouds have arrived in Manchester. On the
  pitch, Rashid and Carse shimmy four from the over. 23rd over: England 127-8
  (Carse 2, Rashid 6) Rashid has decided to go for broke, and flays a long hop
  from Maharaj for four. ‘Tanya.” Lee Johnson, hello. “It has been a great
  summer of cricket (I even enjoyed parts of the H even with zero interest in
  following the Skips, Popchips or whatever they’re called), but the constant
  sound of my summer has been a sarcastic slow clap accompanied by “...batted
  Bethell.” I want him to do well, but what the hell idea was that shot..? Gah.”
  I really want him to do well too. To give the selectors credit, they’ve made
  some big calls on young players and usually been right. But… 22nd over:
  England 121-8 (Carse 1, Rashid 1) No hat-trick, but England are as done for as
  an open bag of Maltesers. An ironic roar from a quietened Headingley crowd as
  Rashid is off the mark with a toe-ended poke. A first-baller for Archer, who
  squares up, surprised, and Markram dives elegantly, hands perfectly cupped at
  slip. A hat-trick ball coming up for Mulder An inside edge like cold gravy,
  played with wobbly head and loose arms. 21st over: England 119-6 (Buttler 14,
  Carse 1) Very nicely done by Maharaj, and England have now lost three for 15
  in three overs. Not a shot for the scrap book. A leading edge which Maharaj
  casually bends down and collects near his ankles. 20th over: England 117-5
  (Buttler 14, Jacks 7) A stomach-settling boundary for Jacks. 19th over:
  England 109-5 (Buttler 12, Jacks 1) A stuttering start by England’s top five.
  I hope Bethell has as much inner confidence in himself as England have in him.
  It’s a tough gig to cut your teeth on the international stage. Ah. A
  tingle-factor catch by Markram at slip who clings on to a riccochet off the
  keeper’s pads – after an anchor-booted Bethell winds up for a drive but edges
  behind. 18th over: England 107-4 (Buttler 11, Bethell 1) Hmmm, a bit neither
  one thing or another this first 18 overs for England. A nice chance for
  Bethell, a young man so heavily laden with expectation, to loosen some of the
  chains. Four leg byes from the last ball of Mulder’s over and a concussion
  check for Buttler, whose head sent the ball on its way. A hunched flick over
  deep backward square by Smith is joyously caught by a dancing fine leg at full
  flight. 17th over: England 101-3 ( Smith 54, Buttler 10) Smith cuts Maharaj
  through extra cover for four to reach fifty, but a diving Tony de Zorzi has
  hurt himself trying to stop the boundary. Ouch, he’s in trouble here, and
  hobbles back to the dressing room as a substitute fielder trots on. 16th over:
  England 92-3 ( Smith 49, Buttler 7) Buttler advances on a bouncer from Mulder,
  but ducks his head and holds back from flaying it horizontally. But, from the
  last ball, comes exactly what the crowd are looking for, as Buttler lofts six
  straight and effortlessly, dropping his head away with a shrug as soon as he’s
  made contact. 15th over: England 85-3 ( Smith 48, Buttler 1) Bavuma summons
  his spinner, and Maharaj whistles through his first over. “Jamie Smith still
  has a lot to learn,” taps John Starbuck. “You don’t send your captain back if
  there’s a possible run-out looming.” Despite a full-throated dive, Brook is on
  his way, victim of a fine throw from Stubbs and a mix-up by England – the
  over-eager Brook sent back half way down the pitch by Smith. 14th over:
  England 82-3 ( Smith 46, Buttler 0) Smith toe-ends Mulder over the leaping
  Maharaj – he’s collecting runs nicely without looking at his fluent best,
  another flick four follows before the head in hands run-out. 13th over:
  England 73-2 ( Smith 37, Brook 12) The camera pans over Headingley: it’s
  looking pretty packed now, cheek by elbow, cookie monster by banana on the
  Western Terrace. Smith flicks Bosch over his shoulder, but only to the waiting
  fielder at deep backward square leg. 12th over: England 68-2 ( Smith 35, Brook
  10) Mulder takes over from Ngidi, a skiddier, shorter chap – by South African
  standards at least. Tidy too – just two from the over. 11th over: England 66-2
  ( Smith 34, Brook 10) A huge Headingley roar as Smith flays Bosch, who has the
  look of an overgrown and blond Stefan Dennis, through the covers. A four from
  Brook to start the over too, an effortless nudge off the legs. 10th over:
  England 57-2 ( Smith 30, Brook 5) Just one from the 10th, and South African
  haven’t let England get away at the end of the first power play. “Can you
  please suppress any more praise of English batters from Brian Withington? He
  seems incapable of learning the lesson by himself.” I’ll try Billy Mills, I’ll
  try. 9th over: England 56-2 ( Smith 30, Brook 4) A bowling change as the blond
  right-armed, and suitably named, Bosch thunders in. Smith ushers his first
  ball for four through deep third, and another through midoff for four more,
  though he plays and misses at the next. 8th over: England 48-2 ( Smith 22,
  Brook 4) A cracking ball from Ngidi, leaving Root uncharacteristically lost
  for strokes, but not such a great follow-up, which Brook hooplas over cover
  for four. Wow! Some terrific juggling skills by Rickelton, who catches Root’s
  glance with the finger tips of his right glove, loses the ball briefly as he
  lands on the ground, but is able to grab the rebound with both hands. Silver
  service. The umpires' review the decision, but the cameras send Root on his
  way. 7th over: England 44-1 ( Smith 22, Root 14) After a fallow 16 balls,
  England get going again as Smith chops Burger into the off side and then tucks
  into the next ball, a wide one, sending it flying over gully. Burger wipes his
  brown on his thick yellow sweat band. Some advice for Richard O’Hagan from
  John Starbuck. “If he waits a bit longer to tell the caller to Eff Off when he
  becomes aware it’s a soi disant ‘Bank Security’ or phishing ‘Catching up’
  call, he’ll have enough time to relalise its Baz or any other selector. Pity
  about Duckett, though.” I don’t know about you but I’m always being sold solar
  panels and double glazing. 6th over: England 35-1 ( Smith 14, Root 13) Ngidi
  once more, kicking his orange soled shoes behind him. Some nice fielding by
  South Africa on the rock-hard outfield, to limit England to two off the over.
  And hello Brian Withington “After that first sumptuous extra cover drive by
  Joe Root I was moved to suggest at another place (Romeo’s) that it should be
  framed and placed on permanent display in the National Gallery. After the
  second I’m thinking hopefully of one more for the triptych.” I have a feeling
  he’ll oblige – he looks in the zone (again). 5th over: England 33-1 ( Smith
  12, Root 13) No boundaries off Burger’s third over, but Rickleton hurts his
  hand fluffing a take behind the stumps. 4th over: England 29-1 ( Smith 10,
  Root 13) Ngidi employs the wobble seam. Root whips four square and then, after
  a watchful few balls, once more sends the ball tumbling through the covers to
  the rope. Perfection. The Headingley skies are blue and dotted with
  candy-floss clouds, with, we’re told, the possibility of rain later. 3rd over:
  England 21-1 ( Smith 10, Root 5) Berger follows up his wicket-taking ball with
  a wide, then Root knocks the next effortlessly, like the swish of a satin
  dressing-gown, through the covers for four. ROOOOOT sing the crowd as he holds
  the pose. “Why,” asks Matthew Doherty, “couldn’t we have Burger c Mustard b
  Onions?” Damn that the years didn’t quite align. You might get Burger v Baker
  later though. A stone-footed, forward prod, easily taken by Rickleton. Done by
  the swing. 2nd over: England 13-0 (Duckett 5, Smith 8) Duckett gets in on the
  four act, driving powerfully and passing the outstretched foot of bowler
  Ngidi. This outfield is crying out for runs. “Very interesting to read about
  Sonny Baker’s call up,” writes Richard O’Hagan. “ I’m now able to understand
  my own lack of international recognition. It’s because I don’t answer calls
  from numbers that I don’t recognise, isn’t it?” I hope it isn’t too late for
  you Richard, coming up on the inside for the Ashes tour. 1st over: England 8-0
  (Duckett 0, Smith 8) Burger with the first over. Tall, broad, left arm, a
  shadow of a moustache, a doormat of a goatee, and Smith plays the first three
  balls watchfully away. Balls five and six however, go for four, one sent away
  at 27 minutes past the hour, one at 27 minutes to. Our man on the ground,
  Simon Burnton, reports a ground half full and filling up quickly, as the
  players prepare to walk through a welcoming committee of flag-waving women
  over 40. Just add that to our skill set. A smiling Sonny Baker is talking to
  Michael Atherton. “It has been obviously a very surreal experience over the
  last six weeks, but I can’t wait to get stuck in.[ When Baz called] I thought
  it was a fake call, asking me to fill in my credit card details, when it was
  him, I nearly fell off my chair. I said I’m normally more talkative that this,
  and he said, ‘I’ve heard’.” [On bowling fast]. “That’s the most fun thing
  about the sport for me, there’s a reason Jofra has such a following. I
  attribute quite a lot of my ball speed to the fact that I really want to to
  it. Getting injured, going for runs, that’s fine as long as you understand
  that it is part of doing the fun stuff.” What a charming, chilled young man.
  He hasn’t played a list A game since 2022 though, so not the easiest debut…
  South Africa XI: Aiden Markram, Ryan Rickelton (wk), Temba Bavuma (c), Tony de
  Zorzi, Tristan Stubbs, Dewald Brevis, Wiaan Mulder, Corbin Bosch, Keshav
  Maharaj, Nandre Burger, Lungi Ngidi. A new opening pair for South Africa with
  Aiden Markram and Ryan Rickelton. More on Sonny Baker from his captain. “I’m
  really excited for Sonny, he had an amazing hundred, looking forward to him
  showcasing his skills today and great to have Jof back.” Temba Bauma calls
  correctly and chooses to have a bowl on the dry Headingley pitch. Harry Brook
  would have had a bowl too, “I know this ground pretty well and I know it is
  hard to defend.” England XI: Jamie Smith, Ben Duckett, Joe Root, Harry Brook
  (capt), Jos Buttler (wk), Jacob Bethell, Will Jacks, Brydon Carse, Jofra
  Archer, Adil Rashid, Sonny Baker. But as one door opens, another closes, with
  Surrey’s Jamie Overton announcing an “indefinite break” from red-ball cricket.
  Overton, just 31, and another of England’s big fast bowler dream team, was
  part of the squad for all five Tests against India, and played at The Oval,
  but has struggled with injury. “It is no longer possible to commit fully to
  all formats at every level, both physically and mentally,” he said. “Red-ball,
  first‑class cricket has provided the foundation for my professional career and
  has been the gateway to every opportunity I’ve had in the game so far. “Going
  forward, my focus will be on white-ball cricket, and I will continue to give
  everything to play at the highest level for as long as I can.” We know how
  much the England selectors like a big strong fast bowler with the Ashes on the
  horizon, and there is much excitement about Hampshire’s Sonny Baker, who will
  make his senior England debut today. He’s impressed in the Hundred and a good
  first Championship season. This could be his NatWest final moment. Simon has
  more here: Good morning from an autumnal England, the conkers dropping like
  heavy hints, the sun still a warm back rub. After a month of Hundred action,
  we’re back to the international game – with South Africa the September
  visitors. They were here in high summer, beating Australia in the memorable
  World Test Championship final at Lord’s. Their return, for the white ball
  stuff, should be a stern test of Brook’s captaincy – they’ve won five of their
  last six against England. Today’s ODI, the first of three ODIs and three T20s,
  tees off at Headingley at 1pm BST, do join us to chew over the Ashes squad and
  more.

Simon Burnton was at Headingley for us today; I’ll leave you with his report. Night night. It’s not really night, is it. Temba Bavuma’s verdict It’s very important to start well and continue the momentum from Australia. We were clinical with the ball; I don’t think you can fault the bowlers much. It’s a quick turnaround between games. We want to build on the momentum and keep pushing our standards up. Not ideal. Not a great start to the series – one of those bad days and we have to move on as soon as possible. We couldn’t get a partnership together and everyone had a bad day apart from Smudge. [What style do you want your team to play?] Go out there and bang it, get as many runs as possible and then look to take wickets throughout. Simple as that really. I thought we bowled nicely. Sonny Baker got a little bit of tap at the start but the way he kept trucking in, giving 100 per cent, was awesome to see. That’s exactly what we ask for from our bowlers. We almost used it as a practice session towards the end when we knew the game was kind of dead. It was good to see lads putting their skills into practice. We have to put that performance behind us and crack on when we get to London. The player of the match is Keshav Maharaj We know England play really well in their own conditions but we carried a lot of momentum from [the win in Australia]. We’re in a wonderful space, finding some rhythm and combinations. We’re still in transition though. On Sky Sports, Mark Butcher is eloquently taking England’s performance apart. They are a pretty poor white-ball team; have been for a long time. That’s England’s tenth heaviest ODI defeat by balls remaining. The highest was at Gros Islet in 2019, when West Indies won with 227 deliveries to spare. England won the World Cup a few months later, so you can start tapping your nose right now, if you’re into all that. 20.5 overs: South Africa 137-3 (Rickelton 31, Brevis 6) Dewald Brevis defends the hat-trick ball, then clubs his second for six to remind everyone what time it is – and complete a brutal victory. Tristan Stubbs misses a reverse-sweep and is bowled. Adil Rashid looks almost disgusted as his teammates come to congratulate him; he finds himself on a hat-trick in the strangest circumstances. SOUTH AFRICA ARE CHOKING LIKE NEVER BEFORE. Bavuma, trying to seal the match with a boundary, slices Rashid high in the air and is caught by Jacks running round from mid-off. England are back in it! 20th over: South Africa 131-1 (Rickelton 31, Bavuma 6) The game is done but Brook still charges after the ball from mid-off to save a boundary. One to win. 19th over: South Africa 125-1 (Rickelton 28, Bavuma 4) The new batter Temba Bavuma blasts Rashid high towards long on. Jacob Bethell slips while trying to get into position for the catch and the ball plops miserably to the turf. Seven more to win. No hundred for Aiden Markram. Jamie Smith has taken a spectacular catch in the covers, diving full length to his right to grab the ball one-handed. Markram tried to lash Rashid over the top for another boundary but didn’t quite get enough elevation. The umpires go upstairs to check whether Smith grounded the ball upon landing. It looks like he managed to twist his wrist just in time. Yep, the third umpire concludes it was a clean catch and Markram has gone for an imperious 55-ball 86. Remember when he was the poster boy for unfulfilled potential? 17th over: South Africa 121-0 (Markram 86, Rickelton 28) Carse replaces Baker, who will finish a bruising debut with figures of 7-0-76-0. That’s the game. Markram hoicks another short ball to the midwicket boundary before taking a single on the off side. He could yet make a hundred, which would be quite something when your team is chasing only 132. South Africa need 11, Markram needs 14. 16th over: South Africa 114-0 (Markram 79, Rickelton 28) Markram edges an excellent legbreak from Rashid for four, then panels another boundary through the covers. In other news, the floodlights are on. Does that count as a moral victory for England. “Wellington 2015 was another corker,” writes our good friend Mike Selvey. And he would know. 16th over: South Africa 103-0 (Markram 69, Rickelton 27) A short ball from Baker is clobbered over midwicket for four by Markram, who is batting offensively well. Many a debutant bowler has been taken apart by a high-class batter. Shane Warne v Ravi Shastri, Tom Hartley v Yashasvi Jaiswal and so on. But this is right up there – Markram has hit Baker for 57 from 32 balls, I think. 15th over: South Africa 95-0 (Markram 63, Rickelton 25) Adil Rashid comes on for Brydon Carse and is milked for a few. “I do wonder whether Bethell has been put in a near impossible position - he just hasn’t had time to learn the game, and to be honest has looked way off it all summer,” says Felix Wood. “To be expectee to learn the game at international level before you’ve even scored a first class century is a steep ask. To be asked to captain on top of that...I don’t think it’s going to work. He should be given time to get up to speed and looked at again in a few years. Maybe Root could talk to him about the benefits of that...” He’s only captaining for a few games against Ireland so I’d have no concerns about that. I agree he should have played more cricket this summer though, and right now I wouldn’t fancy him to make runs in an Ashes Test. But almost all young players have a dip after their initial success, so this might have happened anyway. In the medium term I have no concerns whatsoever about him; if he doesn’t make it, we might as well all pack up and go home. 14th over: South Africa 90-0 (Markram 59, Rickelton 25) A sharp bumper from Baker is top-edged fine for four by Rickelton. Markram then picks a slower ball and cuffs it wide of Bethell for another boundary. It was in the air but safe enough. Baker will soon have the most expensive figures by an England bowler on their ODI debut, passing Liam Dawson (8-0-70-2) against Pakistan in 2016. 13th over: South Africa 80-0 (Markram 54, Rickelton 20) There have been 37.3 overs in this game and it’s almost over. 12th over: South Africa 78-0 (Markram 53, Rickelton 19) Harry Brook invites Sonny Baker to get back on the horse, bringing him back at the Kirkstall Lane End to replace Jofra Archer (5-1-7-0). Baker pulls his length back, hits a tight line and bowls five successive dot balls to Markram. A wide is followed by a genuine edge for a single. In the circumstances that’s an admirable comeback from Baker. There’s no mineral deficiency in this kid. 11th over: South Africa 76-0 (Markram 52, Rickelton 19) Rickelton drags a Carse short ball through midwicket for four. Markram is then caught at mid-on, but only from a free hit after a no-ball from Carse. Believe it or not, England have suffered more brutal ODI defeats than this. Ask our old friend Lawrence Booth. 10th over: South Africa 67-0 (Markram 51, Rickelton 12) Archer slips one fuller to beat Rickelton’s attempted drive. In different circumstances we’d be purring about this opening spell from Archer; he’s been all over Rickelton like a cheap cliche. 9th over: South Africa 65-0 (Markram 50, Rickelton 11) Sonny Baker is taken out of the attack after a bruising spell of 4-0-56-0. Brydon Carse replaces him and concedes only a couple from his first over. South Africa need 67 from 246 balls to win!! 8th over: South Africa 63-0 (Markram 50, Rickelton 10) Archer zips one past Markram to end another excellent over. His figures are beyond reproach: 4-1-6-0. In fact, he’s bowled beautifully. 7th over: South Africa 62-0 (Markram 50, Rickelton 9) A full inswinger from Baker is crashed through extra cover by Markram, who is batting with the serenity of a man who knows his game inside out. Later in the over he drills a sumptuous boundary down the ground, then hammers four more off the back foot to bring up a truly majestic fifty from only 23 balls. It’s the fastest by a South African opener in an ODI. Baker’s figures (4-0-56-0) suggest a debut shocker but I don’t think he’s bowled that badly. He’s a very smart kid and will know this is all part of his education, a punishment for which he will one day be thankful. That said, I’d love to read Baker’s notebook tonight. 6th over: South Africa 50-0 (Markram 38, Rickelton 9) England have only once been beaten by 10 wickets in a home ODI. That was against India three years ago; a few months later they pumped India by the same margin in the World T20 semi-final, so we shouldn’t get carried away about a defeat that hasn’t even happened yet. Amid the ruins Archer has bowled very well, particularly to the left-handed Rickelton. His figures are 3-1-5-0. 5th over: South Africa 49-0 (Markram 37, Rickelton 9) Harry Brook gives Sonny Baker a third over, echoing Ben Stokes’ approach on Tom Hartley’s Test debut. Rickelton hits fours through point and midwicket either side of an edge that falls fractionally short of the slips. Baker has bowled some dangerous deliveries but South Africa have punished the loose stuff without mercy. The result is figures of 3-0-44-0. 4th over: South Africa 38-0 (Markram 36, Rickelton 0) Rickelton is beaten by a good ball from Archer. It’s a game of two ends – or rather it was until a leg-bye brought the first rotation of strike after 22 balls of the innings. Markram treats Archer as he did Baker, timing his first ball through midwicket for four. He has vroomed to 36 from just 14 balls. 3rd over: South Africa 34-0 (Markram 32, Rickelton 0) This is no way to treat a young one. Markram is savaging Sonny Baker: 14 from the first over, 20 from the second. A drive for four was followed by a pair of sixes, the first sliced over the cordon and the second picked up over square leg. Sensational batting. “There’s a bit more blue in the West Yorkshire skies just now, so nothing’s expected from the weather in any non-embarrassing sense,” says John Starbuck. “I’d like to ask about Sonny Baker, as he sounds like a card from Happy Families. Any ideas?” None I’m afraid – I don’t think I ever played it. But I do know he calls his dad ‘Bakes’, one of several takeaways from a charming interview on Test Match Special a couple of weeks ago. I think wrong – Rickelton would have been out had England reviewed. That was odd because the umpire turned his nose up at the appeal and England didn’t discuss a review. But it pitched on leg stump, straightened sharply and would have hit the top of leg. 2nd over: South Africa 14-0 (Markram 14, Rickelton 0) A very good maiden from Archer, who loves bowling to left-handers, ends with an unsuccessful LBW appeal when Rickelton pushes around a nip-backer. Pitched outside leg I think. Rickelton is not out I think that’s a fair decision, although there are boos from the crowd. No suggestion that Root cheated by the way; part of the ball hit his fingers before bouncing into the palm so you can understand why he thought it was a clean catch. Umpire review for a fair catch Ryan Rickelton drives Jofra Archer for a crowd catch to Ben Duckett in the covers. It even fools the TV director, with WICKET! flashing up on the screen. Rickelton then edges Archer very low to Root, who takes the ball at first slip and celebrates the wicket. It goes upstairs, with the reply showing te ball bouncing into Root’s hand – but it’s not clear whether it bounced on the ground or Root’s outstretched fingers. This could go either way. I think it hit the ground but I wouldn’t put the farm on it. 1st over: South Africa 14-0 (Markram 14, Rickelton 0) Sonny Baker’s first over in international cricket is taken for 14 runs. His pace was good, in the high 80s, his accuracy a little awry and Aiden Markram picked him off for three boundaries: a touch to fine leg, a slap over cover point and an accomplished drive from extra cover. Welcome to big school. The players are back on the field. Sonny Baker, wearing No60, will bowl the first over. Thanks Tanya, evening afternoon everyone. So, what are we doing tonight? Unless Sonny Baker or Jofra Archer can summon the spirit of Dennis Lillee at the Waca in 1976, this game will be over before a floodlight has buzzed into life. It’s been a bad 48 hours for the English schedule. First Jamie Overton pulled out of a (probable) Ashes tour, then England batted like a team who are all treadmilled out. It is what it is. For all England’s issues, we shouldn’t underplay the part of a seriously impressive South African side. They’re sixth in the ICC ODI rankings, but right now you can make a strong case for them being second only to India. One thing’s for sure: right here, right now, they are far too good for England. “Is it cowardly to pray for rain?” asks Richard O’Hagan. Heh, heh, I’m going to leave that question, and England’s fate, to the safe hands of Rob Smyth. Thanks for your (brief) company today. Enjoy Sonny Baker – bye! South Africa, meanwhile, were excellent, bowling tidily, catching beautifully. “I’m really impressed by how Bavuma has led the side,” says Natalie Germanos, “their plans have been good. Maharaj is fantastic, and he’s been fantastic for South Africa for a while now, very calm, very helpful to Bavuma.” Well, that was … something. England dropping cone, flake and slipping on the vanilla for good measure. All out for 131 in 24.3 overs, Carse left high and dry, not out three. England’s highest scorer was Jamie Smith with 54 but no-one else made more than 15. Through the gate! Baker bends, bat hovering, watchful for his first ball in international cricket, and Maharaj fires one through to pop the cherry on the cake. Four for 22 for him and England castled in less than 25 overs. Given out on the field, but Rashid reviews – why not? A third for Maharaj who clonks a lunging Rashid on the knee roll. Now for the debutant… 24th over: England 131-8 (Carse 3, Rashid 9) I’m not sure which way the weather is travelling, but the clouds have arrived in Manchester. On the pitch, Rashid and Carse shimmy four from the over. 23rd over: England 127-8 (Carse 2, Rashid 6) Rashid has decided to go for broke, and flays a long hop from Maharaj for four. ‘Tanya.” Lee Johnson, hello. “It has been a great summer of cricket (I even enjoyed parts of the H even with zero interest in following the Skips, Popchips or whatever they’re called), but the constant sound of my summer has been a sarcastic slow clap accompanied by “...batted Bethell.” I want him to do well, but what the hell idea was that shot..? Gah.” I really want him to do well too. To give the selectors credit, they’ve made some big calls on young players and usually been right. But… 22nd over: England 121-8 (Carse 1, Rashid 1) No hat-trick, but England are as done for as an open bag of Maltesers. An ironic roar from a quietened Headingley crowd as Rashid is off the mark with a toe-ended poke. A first-baller for Archer, who squares up, surprised, and Markram dives elegantly, hands perfectly cupped at slip. A hat-trick ball coming up for Mulder An inside edge like cold gravy, played with wobbly head and loose arms. 21st over: England 119-6 (Buttler 14, Carse 1) Very nicely done by Maharaj, and England have now lost three for 15 in three overs. Not a shot for the scrap book. A leading edge which Maharaj casually bends down and collects near his ankles. 20th over: England 117-5 (Buttler 14, Jacks 7) A stomach-settling boundary for Jacks. 19th over: England 109-5 (Buttler 12, Jacks 1) A stuttering start by England’s top five. I hope Bethell has as much inner confidence in himself as England have in him. It’s a tough gig to cut your teeth on the international stage. Ah. A tingle-factor catch by Markram at slip who clings on to a riccochet off the keeper’s pads – after an anchor-booted Bethell winds up for a drive but edges behind. 18th over: England 107-4 (Buttler 11, Bethell 1) Hmmm, a bit neither one thing or another this first 18 overs for England. A nice chance for Bethell, a young man so heavily laden with expectation, to loosen some of the chains. Four leg byes from the last ball of Mulder’s over and a concussion check for Buttler, whose head sent the ball on its way. A hunched flick over deep backward square by Smith is joyously caught by a dancing fine leg at full flight. 17th over: England 101-3 ( Smith 54, Buttler 10) Smith cuts Maharaj through extra cover for four to reach fifty, but a diving Tony de Zorzi has hurt himself trying to stop the boundary. Ouch, he’s in trouble here, and hobbles back to the dressing room as a substitute fielder trots on. 16th over: England 92-3 ( Smith 49, Buttler 7) Buttler advances on a bouncer from Mulder, but ducks his head and holds back from flaying it horizontally. But, from the last ball, comes exactly what the crowd are looking for, as Buttler lofts six straight and effortlessly, dropping his head away with a shrug as soon as he’s made contact. 15th over: England 85-3 ( Smith 48, Buttler 1) Bavuma summons his spinner, and Maharaj whistles through his first over. “Jamie Smith still has a lot to learn,” taps John Starbuck. “You don’t send your captain back if there’s a possible run-out looming.” Despite a full-throated dive, Brook is on his way, victim of a fine throw from Stubbs and a mix-up by England – the over-eager Brook sent back half way down the pitch by Smith. 14th over: England 82-3 ( Smith 46, Buttler 0) Smith toe-ends Mulder over the leaping Maharaj – he’s collecting runs nicely without looking at his fluent best, another flick four follows before the head in hands run-out. 13th over: England 73-2 ( Smith 37, Brook 12) The camera pans over Headingley: it’s looking pretty packed now, cheek by elbow, cookie monster by banana on the Western Terrace. Smith flicks Bosch over his shoulder, but only to the waiting fielder at deep backward square leg. 12th over: England 68-2 ( Smith 35, Brook 10) Mulder takes over from Ngidi, a skiddier, shorter chap – by South African standards at least. Tidy too – just two from the over. 11th over: England 66-2 ( Smith 34, Brook 10) A huge Headingley roar as Smith flays Bosch, who has the look of an overgrown and blond Stefan Dennis, through the covers. A four from Brook to start the over too, an effortless nudge off the legs. 10th over: England 57-2 ( Smith 30, Brook 5) Just one from the 10th, and South African haven’t let England get away at the end of the first power play. “Can you please suppress any more praise of English batters from Brian Withington? He seems incapable of learning the lesson by himself.” I’ll try Billy Mills, I’ll try. 9th over: England 56-2 ( Smith 30, Brook 4) A bowling change as the blond right-armed, and suitably named, Bosch thunders in. Smith ushers his first ball for four through deep third, and another through midoff for four more, though he plays and misses at the next. 8th over: England 48-2 ( Smith 22, Brook 4) A cracking ball from Ngidi, leaving Root uncharacteristically lost for strokes, but not such a great follow-up, which Brook hooplas over cover for four. Wow! Some terrific juggling skills by Rickelton, who catches Root’s glance with the finger tips of his right glove, loses the ball briefly as he lands on the ground, but is able to grab the rebound with both hands. Silver service. The umpires' review the decision, but the cameras send Root on his way. 7th over: England 44-1 ( Smith 22, Root 14) After a fallow 16 balls, England get going again as Smith chops Burger into the off side and then tucks into the next ball, a wide one, sending it flying over gully. Burger wipes his brown on his thick yellow sweat band. Some advice for Richard O’Hagan from John Starbuck. “If he waits a bit longer to tell the caller to Eff Off when he becomes aware it’s a soi disant ‘Bank Security’ or phishing ‘Catching up’ call, he’ll have enough time to relalise its Baz or any other selector. Pity about Duckett, though.” I don’t know about you but I’m always being sold solar panels and double glazing. 6th over: England 35-1 ( Smith 14, Root 13) Ngidi once more, kicking his orange soled shoes behind him. Some nice fielding by South Africa on the rock-hard outfield, to limit England to two off the over. And hello Brian Withington “After that first sumptuous extra cover drive by Joe Root I was moved to suggest at another place (Romeo’s) that it should be framed and placed on permanent display in the National Gallery. After the second I’m thinking hopefully of one more for the triptych.” I have a feeling he’ll oblige – he looks in the zone (again). 5th over: England 33-1 ( Smith 12, Root 13) No boundaries off Burger’s third over, but Rickleton hurts his hand fluffing a take behind the stumps. 4th over: England 29-1 ( Smith 10, Root 13) Ngidi employs the wobble seam. Root whips four square and then, after a watchful few balls, once more sends the ball tumbling through the covers to the rope. Perfection. The Headingley skies are blue and dotted with candy-floss clouds, with, we’re told, the possibility of rain later. 3rd over: England 21-1 ( Smith 10, Root 5) Berger follows up his wicket-taking ball with a wide, then Root knocks the next effortlessly, like the swish of a satin dressing-gown, through the covers for four. ROOOOOT sing the crowd as he holds the pose. “Why,” asks Matthew Doherty, “couldn’t we have Burger c Mustard b Onions?” Damn that the years didn’t quite align. You might get Burger v Baker later though. A stone-footed, forward prod, easily taken by Rickleton. Done by the swing. 2nd over: England 13-0 (Duckett 5, Smith 8) Duckett gets in on the four act, driving powerfully and passing the outstretched foot of bowler Ngidi. This outfield is crying out for runs. “Very interesting to read about Sonny Baker’s call up,” writes Richard O’Hagan. “ I’m now able to understand my own lack of international recognition. It’s because I don’t answer calls from numbers that I don’t recognise, isn’t it?” I hope it isn’t too late for you Richard, coming up on the inside for the Ashes tour. 1st over: England 8-0 (Duckett 0, Smith 8) Burger with the first over. Tall, broad, left arm, a shadow of a moustache, a doormat of a goatee, and Smith plays the first three balls watchfully away. Balls five and six however, go for four, one sent away at 27 minutes past the hour, one at 27 minutes to. Our man on the ground, Simon Burnton, reports a ground half full and filling up quickly, as the players prepare to walk through a welcoming committee of flag-waving women over 40. Just add that to our skill set. A smiling Sonny Baker is talking to Michael Atherton. “It has been obviously a very surreal experience over the last six weeks, but I can’t wait to get stuck in.[ When Baz called] I thought it was a fake call, asking me to fill in my credit card details, when it was him, I nearly fell off my chair. I said I’m normally more talkative that this, and he said, ‘I’ve heard’.” [On bowling fast]. “That’s the most fun thing about the sport for me, there’s a reason Jofra has such a following. I attribute quite a lot of my ball speed to the fact that I really want to to it. Getting injured, going for runs, that’s fine as long as you understand that it is part of doing the fun stuff.” What a charming, chilled young man. He hasn’t played a list A game since 2022 though, so not the easiest debut… South Africa XI: Aiden Markram, Ryan Rickelton (wk), Temba Bavuma (c), Tony de Zorzi, Tristan Stubbs, Dewald Brevis, Wiaan Mulder, Corbin Bosch, Keshav Maharaj, Nandre Burger, Lungi Ngidi. A new opening pair for South Africa with Aiden Markram and Ryan Rickelton. More on Sonny Baker from his captain. “I’m really excited for Sonny, he had an amazing hundred, looking forward to him showcasing his skills today and great to have Jof back.” Temba Bauma calls correctly and chooses to have a bowl on the dry Headingley pitch. Harry Brook would have had a bowl too, “I know this ground pretty well and I know it is hard to defend.” England XI: Jamie Smith, Ben Duckett, Joe Root, Harry Brook (capt), Jos Buttler (wk), Jacob Bethell, Will Jacks, Brydon Carse, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid, Sonny Baker. But as one door opens, another closes, with Surrey’s Jamie Overton announcing an “indefinite break” from red-ball cricket. Overton, just 31, and another of England’s big fast bowler dream team, was part of the squad for all five Tests against India, and played at The Oval, but has struggled with injury. “It is no longer possible to commit fully to all formats at every level, both physically and mentally,” he said. “Red-ball, first‑class cricket has provided the foundation for my professional career and has been the gateway to every opportunity I’ve had in the game so far. “Going forward, my focus will be on white-ball cricket, and I will continue to give everything to play at the highest level for as long as I can.” We know how much the England selectors like a big strong fast bowler with the Ashes on the horizon, and there is much excitement about Hampshire’s Sonny Baker, who will make his senior England debut today. He’s impressed in the Hundred and a good first Championship season. This could be his NatWest final moment. Simon has more here: Good morning from an autumnal England, the conkers dropping like heavy hints, the sun still a warm back rub. After a month of Hundred action, we’re back to the international game – with South Africa the September visitors. They were here in high summer, beating Australia in the memorable World Test Championship final at Lord’s. Their return, for the white ball stuff, should be a stern test of Brook’s captaincy – they’ve won five of their last six against England. Today’s ODI, the first of three ODIs and three T20s, tees off at Headingley at 1pm BST, do join us to chew over the Ashes squad and more.
