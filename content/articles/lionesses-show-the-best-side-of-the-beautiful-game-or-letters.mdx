  Ava Vidal’s article really resonated with me as I recovered from the stress of
  Sunday night (England has finally found a way to banish all the ‘years of
  hurt’. It’s called women’s football and the Lionesses, 28 July). From the
  first defeat against France to the final penalties against Spain, England were
  one match from returning home. Against Sweden, they were about 10 minutes from
  doing that, and against Italy just over a minute. In the final, they were
  forced into a rearguard action for pretty much the whole game. If the men’s
  team had done that, every single player would be called a legend the length
  and breadth of the country – quite rightly. As it is the women’s team,
  misogynists are queueing up online to say it is a worthless achievement, as
  they hate to see female successes. For the last two seasons I have been going
  to the Emirates Stadium to watch Arsenal women’s team with my wife, who never
  had the opportunity to play the sport she loves, and my daughter, who has been
  playing for 15 years in various football teams. The crowd is overwhelmingly
  young, female, enthusiastic and tolerant, to the extent that I have seen
  Tottenham and Arsenal supporters sitting together. Yes, there is support for
  Arsenal, but there is no hatred for the opposition. I would never go to a
  men’s match, with its poisonous, threatening and exclusionary atmosphere. For
  me, there is only one type of football I want to see, and it is the football
  played by these remarkable women. They are role models to everyone, young and
  old, irrespective of gender. They show the best side of sport and the abuse
  they receive just shows their detractors up for what they are. You will see me
  there this season with my “Russo 23” shirt, watching these amazing heroines.
  David Pearce Gillingham, Kent • Tom Garry is perceptive in saying that Three
  Lions was too melancholy a tune to be played after recent Lionesses’ victories
  (Analysis, 27 July). For almost 30 years that wretched jingle has been a
  soundtrack to defeat and failure. It should be forgotten, along with the
  misery it accompanied. Compare the deflating mood it evokes with the
  exhilaration occasioned by just a few bars of Sweet Caroline, which spurs
  those triumphant memories of Wembley 2022 and now Basel. Richard Stanley
