  I note that in the photo of King Charles visiting Scotland in your print
  edition (Monarch north of the glens, 29 July), he has a dagger tucked into his
  sock. How does this fit with the man arrested recently by armed police for
  carrying garden tools home from his allotment ? No doubt the king had armed
  police with him who took a different view of someone carrying a weapon in
  public. Mike Lowcock Sandbach, Cheshire • Nigel Farage is surely right that
  lawlessness on the streets is being compounded by the arrival of “droves of
  unvetted men into our towns and cities” (Editorial, 29 July). Perhaps he could
  simply ask his supporters to stay at home. David Pafford Bowerhill, Wiltshire
  • It might help to improve the status of oracy in schools (Editorial, 27 July)
  if teachers could rephrase the often-heard classroom instruction: “Stop
  talking and get on with your work.” Pat Jones Author of Lipservice: The Story
  of Talk in Schools • Rather than a green burial (Letters, 30 July), I hope
  that when my time comes, resomation (a process that uses water and a weak
  alkaline solution to break down human remains) will be widely available in
  this country. Lorrie Marchington Whaley Bridge, Derbyshire • Thank you to
  Martin Parr for his wonderful photo essay on “voyaging”, as cruising is now
  apparently called (Decks appeal, 28 July). I have never been a fan, but now
  I’m sure that “voyaging” is not for me. Margaret Vandecasteele Cupar, Fife •
