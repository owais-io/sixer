  The Russian warlord and businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin looked “doomed” after
  his failed mutiny and told his mother he expected to die in the days before
  his private plane crash. Prigozhin, the founder of the notorious Wagner
  mercenary group, died when his business jet went down in the summer of 2023,
  two months after his fighters briefly seized control of the southern city of
  Rostov-on-Don and advanced towards Moscow in a short-lived rebellion against
  Russia’s military leadership. “When I last saw him, he looked doomed,” said
  Violetta Prigozhina, 85, in an interview with the Russian outlet Fontanka,
  recalling the last meeting she had with her son one week before the deadly
  crash. Asked if he foresaw his death, she replied: “Of course.” Prigozhina, in
  the first interview by a close relative of the late Wagner leader, said the
  authorities had still not told her what happened to her son. Western
  intelligence agencies believe Prigozhin was probably killed by an onboard
  explosion on Vladimir Putin’s orders as retribution for his mutiny.
  Prigozhina, who runs a gallery exhibiting pro-war art, said she had tried to
  dissuade her son from marching on Moscow, warning that he overestimated the
  extent of his support. “When we saw each other before the march, I told him:
  ‘Zhenya, only people on the internet will support you. No one will go with
  you. People aren’t like that now. No one will come out to the square.’”
  Prigozhina said her son replied: “No, they will support me.” Prigozhin’s
  short-lived rebellion, launched with several hundred of his most loyal
  fighters, was preceded by weeks of escalating tension with Russia’s defence
  ministry and top commanders, whom he accused of corruption. At the time,
  Wagner played a key role in Russia’s offensive against Ukraine, with
  Prigozhin’s fighters often deployed as shock troops in frontal assaults during
  battles in eastern Ukraine. While no major political figures backed
  Prigozhin’s rebellion, polls suggested that at its height, his blunt,
  anti-establishment rhetoric resonated widely and won him significant support
  among Russians. When Wagner troops seized control of key military sites in
  Rostov-on-Don, Prigozhin was greeted warmly by locals. But he called off the
  march about 120 miles (193km) outside Moscow after a series of phone calls
  with senior Russian officials and the Belarusian president, Alexander
  Lukashenko, who acted as an intermediary. During the advance, Wagner fighters
  shot down a Ka-52 attack helicopter, killing its crew, and destroyed an Il-18
  military aircraft. “In the end he just turned around – that was it,” said
  Prigozhina. “He had no intention of overthrowing Putin, absolutely not. He
  only wanted to get through to the military leadership,” she added, claiming
  her son halted the march to avoid further bloodshed among regular Russian
  troops. “He told me he couldn’t shoot young guys during his march,” Prigozhina
  said. After Prigozhin’s death, Russian authorities swiftly moved to seize his
  sprawling business empire, which extended far beyond mercenary operations to
  encompass online “bot farms”, mining ventures in Africa and a vast catering
  business – the source of his nickname “Putin’s chef”. His Wagner forces, which
  operated primarily across Africa and have been accused of mass atrocities,
  have since been absorbed into Russian state structures and continue to operate
  under the name Africa Corps. Prigozhin’s 27-year-old son, Pavel, who fought
  with Wagner in Syria, has been largely sidelined in the power struggle that
  followed his father’s death. In September 2024, Prigozhina won an unexpected
  victory in an EU court, which ordered her removal from the European sanctions
  list and instructed the Council of the European Union to pay her legal costs.
  She and her grandson had been placed under sanctions as part of a wider move
  against the Prigozhin family, which for years played an active role in Yevgeny
  Prigozhin’s network of businesses. In the interview with Fontanka, Prigozhina
  complained that despite being taken off the sanctions list, she was recently
  denied a visa to travel to Hamburg, Germany, to visit a clinic. “Instead, I am
  preparing many exhibitions now,” she said, adding that one of the main works
  currently on display in her St Petersburg gallery shows a portrait of her son
  in Ukraine.
