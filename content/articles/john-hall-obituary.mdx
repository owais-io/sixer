  My friend John Hall, who has died aged 80, was a senior lecturer and later
  vice-principal at Dartington College of Arts in Devon, where in 1994 he helped
  to create one of the UK’s first degrees in performance writing. He was also a
  published poet, with a collection of poems, Between the Cities, that appeared
  in 1968, followed regularly by others until 1981, all of them exhibiting a
  combination of sharp observation and rueful candour. John was born in Broken
  Hill (now Kabwe) in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), to Rachel (nee
  Gartside-Tippinge), a translator, and Sir Douglas Hall, a British colonial
  administrator. His early upbringing was initially in a remote setting: the
  family’s nearest neighbours were 25 miles away and the closest cinema and
  doctor were 77 miles away. John and his elder sisters, Ruth and Marion, were
  the only non-missionary children at Sakeji boarding school. At 13 he was sent
  to England, where he finished his secondary schooling at Dover college in
  Kent. In 1965 he began an English degree at Gonville &amp; Caius College,
  Cambridge, where his tutors were the poets JH Prynne and Andrew Crozier.
  John’s cadences were there from the start, and Between the Cities was
  published just as he graduated. Wry and measured, yet freewheeling and
  succinct, his words were always used sparingly, as in his poem from Days
  (1972), which ran: “It has rained a long time / it is March 9th / there is
  blossom everywhere / it is not that everything has moved.” Later, an archival
  prose work, Apricot Pages, and a restrospective, else / here, were published.
  Couldn’t You? and two volumes of essays on performance writing followed. After
  teacher training at Southampton University, John met Angela Keys, a
  psychotherapist; they married in 1972 and had two sons, Thomas and Birdie. He
  first worked as an English teacher at King Edward VI community college in
  Totnes, Devon, for five years (1971-76) before moving to Dartington College of
  Arts (now part of Falmouth University) as a lecturer. He became vice-principal
  in 1990. It was in that role that he led the group that planned the college’s
  performance writing degree, a course that I took. He taught conversationally,
  with a gentle, gracious manner that was laced with humour. John stayed at
  Dartington College until 2010, when the college was moved to Falmouth, where
  he was appointed associate director of research and professor in performance
  writing before retiring in 2020. He lived for 40 years in a house near
  Buckfastleigh, Devon, with a long garden that shaded the river. A revolving
  summerhouse captured his sense of fun and his eclectic range of interests. For
  many years he was visited by a mysterious peacock that flew regularly into his
  garden. He named him Percy and the two of them struck up a rapport. John and
  Angela divorced in 2009 but renewed their partnership in later life. She
  survives him, as do their sons, grandsons, Joseph and Joshua, and his sister
  Marion.
