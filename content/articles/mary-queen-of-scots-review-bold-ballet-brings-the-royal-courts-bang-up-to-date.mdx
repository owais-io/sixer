  Mary, Queen of Scots review – bold ballet brings the royal courts bang up to
  date
sectionName: Stage

bodyText: >-
  The second half of this show is much better than the first. It’s often the way
  in (loosely) narrative ballet. There’s all the scene-setting and character
  introductions before you can get to the guts of it – the relationships, the
  tension, the betrayal. Scottish Ballet’s new Mary, Queen of Scots, created by
  choreographer Sophie Laplane and director James Bonas, stumbles in the setup.
  Sometimes it’s just helpful to know where we are and who’s who. How would we
  know this scene where the men have porky prosthetic bellies protruding from
  their jackets is the French court, for example? The central conceit is that
  this is Mary’s story told through her cousin Elizabeth I’s eyes and the
  creators have set themselves a challenge there: in literature, one person can
  easily tell another’s story, but you can’t dance someone else’s dance. Older
  Elizabeth (Charlotta Öfverholm), however, is the most distinctive presence on
  stage, frail and losing her dignity, with a sense of confusion around her. The
  other knotty problem is to tell the relationship of two women who never
  actually met in real life. This sense of distance permeates the first half of
  the ballet: there’s a coldness. It’s in Mikael Karlsson and Michael P
  Atkinson’s ominous music, mixing Scottish folk and minor-key electronics. It’s
  in aloof young Elizabeth I (Harvey Littlefield) who arrives on stilts, looming
  above her court – but even without props, the character’s movement remains
  stilted. It’s in the courting of Mary (Roseanna Leney) and Lord Darnley (Evan
  Loudon), dancing like two sexy, powerful people who know they’re being
  admired, and in the presence of Walsingham’s spies, wearing bug-like masks,
  making life lonely and unsafe for a young queen. Choreographically, Laplane
  avoids some of contemporary ballet’s typical display of the female body, legs
  up by the ears and show-off lines. She doesn’t do pretty for pretty’s sake,
  and weaves quirky and vernacular movement into her language. The ballet is
  full of surreal touches. In the second act, Mary gives birth to a balloon. The
  jester picks up a black pen and writes “James” on it. (Where was this clear
  messaging in the first act when we needed it?) While Mary dances with her
  baby/balloon, the old Elizabeth picks up her own balloon, but it has no name
  (for she had no child) and pathos pierces the scene. We’re finally getting to
  the nub of things. The ballet lifts off the stage when Laplane and Bonas
  manufacture a meeting of the two queens, Mary and Elizabeth standing in two
  side-by-side wardrobes (part of Soutra Gilmour’s minimal, multifunction set)
  that look like confessional booths, while their proxies dance together. In one
  scene we see their bond, but also the faltering of their loyalty, and the
  dramatic denouement begins. This is a bold production, full of imagination and
  rightly determined not to be just another period drama but something genuinely
  contemporary. There is a lot of richness here, but it takes a long time to
  invest in, and a little more clarity could make all the difference. • At
