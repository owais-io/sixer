  Good morning. Last night, Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the White House flanked
  by a dream team of hastily assembled European heavyweights. Their aim: to coax
  Donald Trump out of pro-Russian positions he adopted after his Alaska meeting
  with Vladimir Putin last Friday. The meeting was a sign of both panic and
  resolve from Europe. The fact Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and more cleared
  their diaries at such short notice to fly to Washington is an indication of
  how alarmed they are by Trump’s desire to move straight to a peace deal
  without a ceasefire – and his insistence that Zelenskyy give up Ukrainian
  territory. Progress was made on US security guarantees, and Trump and
  Zelenskyy have said they will both be holding face-to-face talks with Putin –
  although the Russian and Ukrainian leaders still appear worlds apart in their
  demands. Macron said he had “serious doubts” about Putin’s desire for peace.
  For this morning’s newsletters, I had a chat with our senior international
  correspondent Luke Harding about the key points agreed in Washington last
  night, what it means for international diplomacy, and what is next for
  Ukraine. That’s after the headlines. Five big stories Tax | Rachel Reeves is
  considering replacing stamp duty with a new property tax that would apply to
  the sale of homes worth more than £500,000, the Guardian has been told. UK
  news | Exposure to pornography has increased since the introduction of UK
  rules to protect the public online, with children as young as six seeing it by
  accident, research by the children’s commissioner for England has found.
  Conservatives | Leaked WhatsApp messages show Conservative MPs are worried
  that their party’s “piss-poor” messaging over asylum-seeker hotels is making
  the party look silly. It follows the release of an advert by Conservative
  campaign headquarters last week, making claims that have since been challenged
  as exaggerations, such as that asylum seekers receive free driving lessons and
  free PlayStation consoles. Bolivia | Bolivia’s presidential election will go
  to a runoff, with two rightwing candidates seemingly the top runners. It’s an
  unprecedented scenario after nearly two decades of leftist rule by the
  Movimiento al Socialismo (Mas). Environment | Relentless heat and disastrous
  wildfires continue to ravage southern Europe, with one-quarter of weather
  stations in Spain recording 40C temperatures and above, the latest in a series
  of disasters exacerbated by climate breakdown amid a continental rollback of
  green policies. In depth: ‘The meeting was significantly better than their
  pretty awful encounter in February’ The aim of this rare and sweeping show of
  diplomatic force was to safeguard Ukraine, and Europe more broadly, from any
  widening aggression from Moscow. It was probably also a reminder to Trump of
  Europe’s combined importance as an economic giant compared with Russia’s much
  smaller economy. The European delegation included leaders of Britain, Germany,
  France, Italy, Finland, the European Union and Nato. By arriving as a group
  they avoided another debacle like Zelenskyy’s February visit to the Oval
  Office, where Trump and JD Vance chastised him as not showing enough gratitude
  for American military aid. Here is video of that meeting in case you’d like to
  remind yourself of the horrific blow-up that Trump thought was “great
  television”. “The meeting with Zelenskyy and Trump was significantly better
  than their pretty awful encounter in February of this year,” says Luke
  Harding. “I think Zelenskyy was well prepared this time: he expressed
  gratitude to Trump on many occasions, handed a letter from his wife to Melania
  the first lady.” There was a fair amount of “sucking up to Donald Trump”, says
  Luke, and of European leaders not trying to offend him. Key European demands
  are that all decisions must be made with Ukraine present, and that a ceasefire
  is a pre-condition before further peace talks. They were looking to understand
  what security guarantees the US is willing to offer in the event of a
  settlement. Overall, the atmosphere was good, says Luke. “Zelenskyy was even
  funny on occasions. When Brian Glenn – the reporter who mocked him for not
  wearing a suit in February – asked a question, Zelenskyy pointed out that
  Glenn was still wearing the same suit and Zelenskyy had changed his. So
  overall, the atmosphere was OK.” *** Did they get through to Trump? Rather
  than concessions from Ukraine, the summit focused on arranging security
  guarantees in the event of a peace deal. Trump said the guarantees “would be
  provided by the various European countries [in] coordination with the United
  States of America”. The Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, described the
  development as “a breakthrough”. Membership of Nato is not on the table, but
  the US and European leaders are discussing “Article 5 kind of security
  guarantees for Ukraine”, Rutte said. “What is important is that Trump said the
  US would play a role in providing security to Ukraine in the event of a
  settlement. You might consider that to be progress, but we don’t know what it
  means,” says Luke. “As ever with Trump there is a huge gap between what he
  says and what he does. “I suspect at the end of the day the White House will
  not want to do very much, but at least this was something tangible. The
  Kremlin appears to be quite annoyed – that is modest progress for Ukraine,
  depending on what the US is prepared to commit.” Trump is still saying there
  is no need for a ceasefire – because he says he has stopped a number of wars
  without one. There appears to have been less movement on this issue. “The
  European position was that a ceasefire must come before any trilateral talks –
  that is common sense when Ukrainians are being killed every day,” says Luke.
  *** How did the meetings go for Zelenskyy? Like Europe, Zelenskyy wants a
  ceasefire before any peace deal and is unwilling to make any territorial
  concessions. Kyiv wants Nato-like security guarantees sufficient to deter
  Russia from attacking again. As a reminder, Russia took Ukraine’s Crimean
  peninsula in 2014 and launched a full invasion in 2022, attacking four
  Ukrainian regions: Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia. Ahead of the
  meeting, Trump had pushed Ukraine to give up Crimea and abandon its goal of
  joining Nato – both key demands made by Putin. But Zelenskyy stressed he had
  been able to present a clearer picture of the battle lines to Trump, whom he
  met in a one-on-one in the Oval Office. “This was the best of our meetings,”
  Zelenskyy said, according to a statement put out by his office. “I was able to
  show many things, even on the map, to all American colleagues regarding the
  situation on the battlefield.” Luke says: “On the substantive issue – which is
  how to get a peace deal – he correctly and deftly dodged a question on whether
  Ukraine was ready to swap land in return for peace.” This is Trump’s preferred
  peace plan after his meeting with Putin in Alaska over the weekend. Speaking
  to reporters after the Washington talks, Zelenskyy said “we had a truly warm,
  good and substantial conversation”. The next steps in the negotiations turn
  back to Putin, and the Ukrainian president said he was ready for what would be
  their first face-to-face since Moscow’s invasion nearly three and a half years
  ago. “I confirmed – and all European leaders supported me – that we are ready
  for a bilateral meeting with Putin.” *** What did Trump get out of the
  meeting? Trump previously bragged on numerous occasions that he could settle
  Russia’s war in Ukraine in a day, but on Monday he said repeatedly that it was
  far more complicated than he ever thought it would be. Trump previously
  favoured Kyiv’s proposal for an immediate ceasefire to conduct deeper peace
  talks. However, he reversed course after the summit and indicated support for
  Russia’s approach of negotiating a comprehensive deal while fighting continues
  (for a reminder of how bad things are on the ground in Ukraine, take a look at
  yesterday’s newsletter). After the Washington talks, Trump said on social
  media that he called Putin and began the arrangements for a meeting between
  the leaders of Russia and Ukraine, at a location to be determined. “This was a
  very good, early step for a war that has been going on for almost four years,”
  Trump said. Ukraine’s president said he was ready to meet with Russia in “any
  format” and that territorial issues were “something we will leave between me
  and Putin”. *** What next for the war in Ukraine and peace negotiations? Much
  remains unresolved, including red lines that are incompatible – like whether
  Ukraine will cede any land to Russia, the future of Ukraine’s army, and
  whether the country will ultimately have lasting and meaningful security
  guarantees. “I think where it will go from here,” says Luke, “is that when a
  deal fails to come together and Zelenskyy fails to give away his land, Trump
  will start blaming Zelenskyy again, saying he’s the problem. “Ultimately as
  things stand, there isn’t really a meaningful way forward to a peace
  agreement. I mean Putin’s demands are as maximalist as ever – he wants Ukraine
  to give up a large chunk in the east of the country, in the Donbas region.”
  Although this seems to be Trump’s preferred route to ending the conflict, it
  is unlikely to work for Zelenskyy – were he to make this huge concession, Luke
  says, he would be swept away by popular protest. “I think it’s entirely
  possible that in the next month or so, the Americans will comprehensively exit
  from supporting Ukraine. Already they’ve stopped delivering weapons. I can see
  a pull-out from Trump,” says Luke. “What I find so strange is the way Trump
  defends Putin, wants to include him, talks about calling him imminently, says
  he had a great meeting in Alaska. It seems ultimately that is where his
  sympathies lie – with Russia.” What else we’ve been reading The New York Times
  describes 64-year-old Betsy Lerner as a TikTok star, for the following she’s
  amassed since she started reading out diary entries that she wrote in her
  twenties. In a new start after 60, Lerner explains she doesn’t see herself
  that way. But a generation of 20-year-olds who find solace in her entries
  today may disagree. Poppy Noor, deputy editor, newsletters This is the
  remarkable (and shocking) story of Windrush victim George Lee who has come
  back to the UK after 28 years of exile in Poland. “I’m past the stage where I
  can feel angry,” he says. His observations of how life has changed in London
  during that period are depressing – notably people looking more stressed with
  “tiredness etched on their faces”. Phoebe Nesrine Malik’s tender piece about
  the dogged reporting of journalists in Gaza sheds a light on a potential
  reason so many have been killed: their commitment, professionalism and talent
  causes a real legitimacy problem for the Israeli government. “What the Israeli
  government is trying to do with these killings is not just stop the stream of
  damning reports and footage, but annihilate the very image of Palestinians
  that these media professionals convey,” she says. Poppy A fascinating piece by
  John Harris on the future of outdoor work in the age of extreme heat, with
  alarming stories of people being forced to work in inhumane conditions.
  Particularly timely given the relentless heat currently barrelling its ways
  across Europe. Phoebe Perhaps we’d all like to be green-fingered influencers,
  working leisurely through our homegrown vegetables at the dinner table. But
  Nicola Slawson’s piece on giving up her allotment after realising that’s just
  not who she is will speak to the many of us who aren’t. Poppy Sport Football |

  Cartoon of the day | Ben Jennings The Upside A bit of good news to remind you
  that the world’s not all bad A new report shows just how impactful a raft of
  groundbreaking welfare policies by former Mexican president Andrés Manuel
  López Obrador have been. Obrador’s policies, which included a tripling of the
  minimum wage, and a system of cash transfers for vulnerable groups, made a
  measurable impact on the lives of millions of everyday Mexicans, according to
  a dispatch by reporter Oscar Lopez. When Obrador took office in 2018, there
  were nearly 52 million people living below the poverty line. Six years later,
  that number had dropped by 13.4 million, an unparalleled reduction of nearly
  26%. There has never been a single six-year term in which poverty has been
  reduced or decreased so significantly,” said Viri Ríos, a public policy expert
  and director of Mexico Decoded. “This is a watershed moment for the Mexican
  economy.” Sign up here for a weekly roundup of The Upside, sent to you every
