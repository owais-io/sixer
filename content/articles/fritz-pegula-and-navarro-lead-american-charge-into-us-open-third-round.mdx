  Taylor Fritz overcame a jittery start, Jessica Pegula extended her run of
  consistency and Emma Navarro continued to build on last year’s breakout season
  as all three Americans advanced to the third round of the US Open with
  convincing victories on Wednesday. On a breezy afternoon at Flushing Meadows,
  Fritz recovered from a sluggish opening set to defeat South Africa’s Lloyd
  Harris 4-6, 7-6 (3), 6-2, 6-4. The fourth seed, runner-up here last year, was
  forced to navigate a tricky test against the big-serving Harris, who has been
  rebuilding his career after injuries saw his ranking plummet outside the
  world’s top 300. Fritz dropped serve early and ceded the first set as Harris’s
  forehand found its range. But the American steadied behind his own delivery,
  pounding 17 aces in all, and dominated the second-set tiebreak to level the
  match. From there he played with the authority expected of a top-five seed,
  breaking twice in the third set and riding the crowd’s energy in Louis
  Armstrong Stadium to finish off the win in just under three hours. “It’s
  always difficult when a guy like Lloyd comes out swinging freely,” Fritz said.
  “He was serving great and putting a lot of pressure on me early. I just had to
  hang tough, get through the breaker, and then I felt like I found my rhythm.”
  If Fritz was made to sweat, Pegula’s passage was more straightforward. The
  world No 4, who reached her first grand slam final here a year ago, eased past
  Russia’s Anna Blinkova 6-1, 6-3 on the Grandstand court. Showing the patience
  and precision that have become her calling card, Pegula broke serve six times
  and struck 30 winners to close out the match in a scant 64 minutes. The
  31-year-old is now the first American woman since Madison Keys to reach the
  third round in New York for six years running, underlining her reliability at
  the majors. She will next face two-time major champion Victoria Azarenka, who
  advanced with a win over Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. “I knew if Anna got into a
  groove she could be really dangerous,” Pegula said afterwards. “I just wanted
  to take control right away, not let her dictate. I’m pleased with how I kept
  my foot on the gas.” Pegula, who has already collected tour-high 20 wins on US
  soil this season, admitted that the challenge of solving problems on court is
  what keeps her motivated deep into her career. “You’ve got to be fearless to
  play this sport, because one of you is going to lose out there in front of
  everyone. But when you work your way through and win, that feeling is pretty
  unmatched.” The surge of homegrown players was further bolstered by Navarro,
  the 23-year-old who backed up her semi-final run here last year with a
  commanding 6-2, 6-1 dismissal of Caty McNally. Navarro, who strugged in
  Sunday’s first-round win over Wang Yafan, was ruthless in exploiting McNally’s
  inconsistency, converting seven of eight break points and sealing the victory
  in just over an hour. “It was definitely quicker than I expected, but not
  easy,” Navarro said. “I feel like there’s something special about being here:
  the energy, the crowd, it really pushes me.” Navarro’s next assignment is a
  daunting one: two-time major champion Barbora Krejcikova, a player she beat
  earlier this summer at Wimbledon. Should she advance again, a potential
  fourth-round clash with 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva looms, while a
  quarter-final date with close friend Pegula remains a possibility. The
  victories for Fritz, Pegula and Navarro ensured a buoyant day for American
  tennis, offsetting the disappointment No 30 seed Brandon Nakashima’s 4-6, 7-6
  (2), 7-5, 3-6, 7-6 (10) defeat to Switzerland’s Jerome Kym on Court 12. For
  now, the focus remained on the trio of US contenders who underlined their
  title credentials. “It’s a long road,” Fritz said, “but days like this, with
  the support and the atmosphere, it really feels like home.”
