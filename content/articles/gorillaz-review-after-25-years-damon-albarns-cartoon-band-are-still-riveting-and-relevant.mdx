  Gorillaz are 25. In 2000, this cartoon-fronted project seemed like something
  fun for Damon Albarn to do between Blur albums, hiding behind Jamie Hewlett’s
  comic-book animations, but they’ve overtaken Blur almost everywhere but
  Britain. The number of children in the audience testifies to Gorillaz’s powers
  of self-rejuvenation – an ever-changing vehicle for Albarn’s ceaseless
  curiosity. Gorillaz are marking the occasion with an immersive exhibition,
  House of Kong, and four era-specific shows. This second night revives 2005’s
  Demon Days. Co-produced by Danger Mouse, it remains the most satisfying
  expression of the Gorillaz concept: focused in both its themes (innocence and
  violence) and personnel (rappers and the rap-adjacent). Dressed like a hip
  vicar, Albarn serves double duty as a frontman and a conscientious host,
  although the original cast of vocalists is inevitably depleted. The late MF
  DOOM and awol Shaun Ryder appear only on screen, while Skye Edwards replaces
  Martina Topley-Bird on All Alone. Thank goodness for the old-school stalwarts.
  Bootie Brown enters Dirty Harry like a red-and-white firework before De La
  Soul boom and cackle through Feel Good Inc. Straight replication, though, is
  not the point. Beneath Hewlett’s helter-skelter videos, the band, choir and
  string quartet give the songs new mass and drama. O Green World builds to a
  startling frenzy and the climactic title track blossoms gloriously. As
  stained-glass windows fill the screen and the London Community Gospel Choir
  chant the cathartic refrain, “To the sun”, Albarn’s vicar gear suddenly makes
  sense. The encore of three contemporary B-sides, while admirably disciplined,
  is somewhat anticlimactic. The luminous Hong Kong, starring the guzheng
  virtuoso Qing Du, ends the night on a melancholy question mark rather than an
  exclamation point. Then again, the singles notwithstanding, Demon Days isn’t
  exactly a party record. This product of the Bush-and-Blair years was pitched
  as “the world in a state of night,” drawing inspiration from horror
  soundtracks and the Specials’ queasy crisis-pop. The show opens with a wartorn
  newsreel montage and sporadically drenches the crowd in hell-red light. For
  obvious reasons, the album’s haunting protest against humanity’s appetite for
  destruction – of people and planet alike – sounds no less apt tonight. Demon
  days are here again.
