  The classic music documentary series, The Beatles Anthology, is being
  remastered by Peter Jackson’s production companies and will stream on Disney+
  later this year. As well as digitally enhanced versions of the original eight
  episodes, there will also be a brand new ninth episode written and directed by
  Oliver Murray, created from previously unseen behind-the-scenes footage of
  Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr coming together around the
  release of the original series. The series, which was first broadcast by ITV
  in 1995, was hailed as the definitive documentary on the Beatles thanks to the
  way it reunited the surviving three Beatles with their producer George Martin,
  former press officer Derek Taylor and one-time road manager Neil Aspinall to
  tell the tale of their career in their own words. Its release was accompanied
  by the single, Free As a Bird, the first new piece of music put out by the
  scouse quartet since their disbanding. It was so shrouded in secrecy that
  record label EMI used armed guards to protect it ahead of its release. The
  remastered series, which coincides with the 30th anniversary of the original,
  is the latest Beatles project from Jackson’s Wingnut Films and Park Road Post
  teams. They previously worked on the eight-hour Disney+ docuseries The
  Beatles: Get Back – which used remastered footage originally filmed by Michael
  Lindsay-Hogg for his 1970 film Let It Be – and the accompanying concert movie,
  which Guardian film critic Peter Bradshaw called “unmissable.” It will be
  accompanied by an album featuring session outtakes, previously unreleased
  demos and other rare recordings, curated by Martin’s son Giles. Anthology 4
  includes new mixes of the singles originally released to accompany the
  Anthology TV series, Free As A Bird and Real Love, featuring de-mixed John
  Lennon vocals used by the songs’ original producer, Jeff Lynne. Giles Martin
  has also remastered the three original Anthology albums, released in 1995 and
  1996. The project will be released in November, alongside an updated version
  of the Anthology book. It is the latest high-profile Beatles project alongside
  a quartet of movies from Sam Mendes, with each movie focusing on a different
  member of the band. Given that the Anthology project involves documentary
  footage rather than dramatisation, the signoff process should presumably be a
  lot easier than for the movie. Starr has previously said of the movies that
  getting the scripts right took some work on his part. According to him, they
  “had a writer [involved] – very good writer, great reputation, and he wrote it
  great, but it had nothing to do with [wife] Maureen and I. That’s not how we
  were. I’d say, ‘We would never do that.’” • This article was amended on 22
  August 2025. The new episode is not being created by Peter Jackson as an
  earlier headline said. And details of the creator of that episode have been
  added to the main text.
