  A day of national mourning has been declared in Portugal after at least 15
  people were killed when Lisbon’s well-known Gloria funicular railway car
  derailed and crashed on Wednesday. An emergency services spokesperson said
  some foreign nationals were among the dead but would not identify the victims
  or disclose their nationalities. At least 18 people, including a child, were
  injured, five of them seriously. Public prosecutors have launched an
  investigation into the cause of the disaster. Footage showed the wreckage of
  the yellow and white car – which is known as Elevador da Glória and goes up
  and down a steep hill in central Lisbon in tandem with one going the opposite
  way – lying on its side in the narrow street it traverses. Its sides and top
  were crumpled, and it appeared to have crashed into a building where the road
  bends. Parts of the vehicle, made mostly of metal, were crushed. Witnesses
  told local media that the streetcar careened down the hill, apparently out of
  control. “It hit the building with brutal force and fell apart like a
  cardboard box …” Teresa d’Avó told Portuguese TV channel SIC. One witness said
  the streetcar toppled on to a man on the pavement. The cause of the accident
  was not immediately known. It reportedly occurred at the start of the evening
  rush hour, at about 6pm. Emergency officials said all victims were pulled out
  of the wreckage in just over two hours. SITRA, a trade union, wrote in a post
  on social media that one of its members had died in the incident. “It’s a
  tragic day for our city … Lisbon is in mourning, it is a tragic, tragic
  incident,” Carlos Moedas, the mayor of the Portuguese capital, told reporters.
  Portugal’s government declared that Thursday would be a day of national
  mourning. A statement from the office of prime minister Luis Montenegro said
  the tragedy “has brought grief to … families and dismay to the country”.
  Police investigators were inspecting the site and the prosecutor general’s
  office said it would open a formal investigation, as is customary in public
  transport accidents. In a statement the president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa,
  lamented the accident and expressed hope that authorities would soon establish
  the cause of the crash. The line, which opened in 1885 and is classified as a
  national monument, connects the central Lisbon area near the Restauradores
  Square with the Bairro Alto (Upper Quarter), known for its vibrant nightlife.
  It is one of three funicular lines operated by the municipal public transport
  company Carris and is used by tourists as well as residents. Carris said in a
  statement that “all maintenance protocols have been carried out”, including
  monthly and weekly maintenance programmes and daily inspections. Lisbon’s city
  council suspended operations of other streetcars in the city and ordered
  immediate inspections, local media reported. The Gloria line transports about
  3 million people annually, according to the town hall. Its two cars, each
  capable of carrying about 40 people, are attached to opposite ends of a
  haulage cable with traction provided by electric motors on the cars. The car
  at the bottom of the line was apparently undamaged, but video from bystanders
  broadcast by CNN Portugal showed it jolting violently when the other one
  derailed and several passengers jumping out of its windows and people
  shouting. European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen posted on X that “it is
  with sadness that I learned of the derailment … My condolences to the families
  of the victims.” Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez wrote on X that he was
  “appalled by the terrible accident”, while Italian foreign minister Antonio
  Tajani wrote that he had met the Portuguese foreign minister and expressed his
  “solidarity with the victims”. Portugal, and Lisbon in particular, has
  experienced a tourism boom in the past decade, with visitors cramming into the
  popular downtown area in the summer months. A spokesperson for the UK’s
  Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said it was in touch with the
  local authorities and stood by “to provide consular assistance if there are
  any affected British nationals”. Britain is the largest source of tourism to
  Portugal, followed by Germany, Spain and the United States. The US state
  department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. With Reuters
