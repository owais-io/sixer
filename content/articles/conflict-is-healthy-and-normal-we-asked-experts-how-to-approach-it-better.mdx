  Reality TV is generally not the first place one should turn to find models of
  effective communication. That’s why it was shocking to watch a scene in the
  latest season of Love Island US, in which Chris, a basketball player, asks the
  woman he’s seeing – Huda, a fitness influencer – if there’s anything he does
  that bothers her. It affects his mood “when something goes wrong, but I’m
  confused about what happened”, he says. What happened was that Chris taught a
  yoga class to the islanders (as Love Island contestants are called) and had
  asked everyone except Huda if they had anything to share. Huda, sounding sad,
  says he had skipped over her. “I did forget you, you’re right,” Chris says. It
  was a surprisingly mature conversation for Love Island, a show where
  attractive singles in skimpy swimsuits get locked in a villa for several weeks
  and try to find love. It can be difficult to approach conflict in a healthy
  way in such a high-pressure environment: on-air conflict tends to involve
  contestants shouting over each other and hurling insults. So what does healthy
  conflict actually look like, and how do you practice it? We asked experts
  about how to approach conflict with romantic partners, family members and
  co-workers. Spoiler: the advice applies in basically any situation. It might
  even work on Love Island. Is conflict actually good for us? The first thing to
  know about conflict is that it should not be avoided. “Conflict is normal and
  healthy,” says Rachel Moheban Wachtel, a licensed clinical social worker in
  New York who has worked extensively with couples. Conflict can be essential to
  deepening intimacy, understanding and connection, she says. If she gets mad at
  her husband, and he notices her reaction is disproportionate to the situation
  – which happens all the time with couples – “it’s an opportunity for him to
  learn what’s going on with me”, she explains. “It’s learning what each other’s
  triggers are.” Perhaps counterintuitively, if you don’t have any conflicts in
  your relationship, “then you have to worry”, she says. Disagreements can also
  teach us about ourselves, says Dr Sara Corse, chief clinical officer at the
  Council for Relationships in Philadelphia. “We think we know what we think and
  feel, and we think we know what other people think and feel, but we’re often
  wrong,” she says. Having a difficult conversation can help us clarify or
  evolve our own views on a topic. (In my own relationship, for example,
  conflict has taught me a great deal about how to properly load a dishwasher.
  Apparently you don’t just toss in dishes at random and hope for the best.) Dr
  Amy Gallo, the author of Getting Along: How to Work With Anyone (Even
  Difficult People) and contributing editor to the Harvard Business Review, says
  conflict is her “favorite topic”. “People assume that, as a conflict expert, I
  get brought into organizations to help them deal with too much conflict. It’s
  the exact opposite,” she says. “Ninety-nine per cent of the time, what I’m
  helping leaders and organizations do is have more conflict.” Conflict leads to
  better work outcomes and stronger relationships within an organization, Gallo
  says, because it leads to “a more inclusive environment where people feel like
  there’s psychological safety. They can say what’s on their minds and disagree
  with the people around them because that’s a normal thing.” Why do we find
  conflict so challenging? If conflict is so great, why are so many people
  uncomfortable with it? Many of us are socialized to avoid conflict, Gallo
  says. As a result, people can fear that disagreement is a sign that something
  has gone wrong, or that it signals to others that they are a difficult person.
  “We are taught over and over again that conflict is incredibly difficult,
  negative and destructive,” Gallo says. “Very rarely are we given the message
  that it’s normal to disagree, and differences of opinion make a team
  stronger.” Still, it’s important to not go overboard in our confrontations.
  “There are dysfunctional patterns in some families where they do most of life
  in a conflictual way,” says Corse. Conflict can strengthen intimacy, but it
  should not be the primary tool for building closeness, she argues. Sometimes,
  it’s best to just let things go. “It’s an internal balance of: I don’t need to
  pick every fight, I don’t need to always be right,” Corse says. How can we
  deal with conflict better? Although conflict is normal, many of us have never
  learned how to do it well. Here are some techniques experts use. Listen: “One
  of the tools I use in therapy a lot is empathic reflecting,” says Corse. This
  involves actively listening to someone and then repeating back in your own
  words what you heard them say. Often, people get empathic reflecting wrong,
  Corse says. “Someone tells us something, and in order to be empathic, we start
  telling our story, and we miss acknowledging and validating what the other
  person said,” she explains. In conflict, this can devolve into a verbal tennis
  match with each side volleying grievances at the other without truly hearing
  what the other person has to say. When both parties feel heard, healing can
  happen without each side needing to agree with the other. “Processing helps
  you resolve it,” says Moheban Wachtel. “As long as each person has expressed
  their position and feels heard, they can move on.” Balance the positive and
  the negative: When you have an issue with someone, “you don’t only want to
  talk about the negative”, says Moheban Wachtel. Ideally, one offers four
  positives for every negative. “It’s saying: ‘I love this, this, this and this
  about you, but when you do this, it really hurts me,’” she explains. Doing
  this not only makes it easier for the listener to take criticism, it also
  forces the speaker to communicate their position in a healthy, loving way,
  Moheban Wachtel says. Pause if things get too heated: Even when everyone
  involved has an open mind and the best intentions, conflict is challenging,
  and it’s easy to get overwhelmed. If this happens to one or both parties, it’s
  a good idea to take a break. “When I think about what is healthy conflict
  resolution, it starts with being able to calm yourself emotionally,” Corse
  says. If you start to feel yourself getting overwhelmed – maybe your heart’s
  racing, or your breath is shallow – ask for a timeout. And when you do, make
  sure to signal to the other person that you’re still invested in the
  conversation. Corse suggests saying something like: “Can we take a break to
  calm ourselves down? I want to be able to hear what you’re thinking, and I
  want to be able to share what I’m thinking, but right now we’re too emotional
  to have a productive conversation.” You don’t have to be perfect: “The
  challenge with healthy conflict is that it often veers between healthy and
  unhealthy the entire time,” says Gallo. Someone may slip in a snide comment or
  raise their voice. “We’re humans, we’re messy,” she says. Gallo says that when
  she evaluates whether a conflict is healthy or not, she evaluates whether it
  helped the team reach its goals in some way. Did your disagreement bring you
  closer to your partner? Did it help your team at work make a decision about a
  project? That is more important than whether both parties remained even-keeled
  during the whole discussion. Repair, repair, repair: For Moheban Wachtel, the
  benefits of conflict come from how you repair after it happens. “It’s
  processing the conflict, and understanding why it happened, and what’s going
  on in each person’s subjective reality,” she says. “That processing helps you
  resolve it.”
