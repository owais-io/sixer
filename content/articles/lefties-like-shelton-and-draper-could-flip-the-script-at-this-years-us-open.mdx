  During the peak years of the Big Three, from 2008-2020, the only relevant
  issue to be discussed when discussing a grand slam draw was which of the trio
  was scheduled to meet before the final. And what this ultimately meant was
  that semi-finals often turned out be better than the finals (see: the 2010 and
  2011 US Open semi-finals between Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, or the 2013
  and 2021 French Open semis between Rafael Nadal and Djokovic). Tennis hadn’t
  had that kind of impenetrable triangle of stars since the Jimmy Connors-Björn
  Borg-John McEnroe troika’s very brief hold on the sport in the late 1970s and
  very early 1980s. What makes that long-ago epoch stand out even further is the
  preponderance of left-handed players. Consider – from 1974 through 1984, a
  southpaw triumphed in every one of those 11 years at the US Open; Connors in
  1974, 1976, 1978, 1982 and 1983; Manuel Orantes in 1975, Guillermo Vilas in
  1977 and John McEnroe in 1979, 1980, 1981 and 1984. Further, in 1979 four of
  the top-six ranked men were lefties – Connors, McEnroe, Vilas and Roscoe
  Tanner. And just prior to Connors and McEnroe’s dominance, the left-handed Rod
  Laver had been – by far – the best men’s player in the world when the open era
  began. Why were lefties so predominant? It’s impossible to know. But in the 41
  years since McEnroe’s last US Open title only two male lefties (Nadal and
  Goran Ivanišević) have won the US Open or Wimbledon singles title and only
  three other lefties have claimed any slam: Andrés Gómez (1990 French Open),
  Thomas Muster (1995 French Open) and Petr Korda, who won his one and only slam
  in Australia in 1998. And Nadal isn’t even a natural lefty as he does nearly
  all other tasks right-handed. Part of the legend of the Spaniard is that when
  he was a young player he hit his groundstrokes with two hands from both sides.
  His coach and uncle, Toni, saw his nephew hit stronger from the left-handed
  side and from that moment on Nadal became a lefty. Contrary to initial
  opinions on the topic, there was no master plan to turn an infant Nadal into a
  lefty to reap the inherent benefits of being a southpaw in tennis. The same
  trend has also held true for the women. In the late 1970s into the mid-1990s,
  several southpaw women accumulated a bounty of slam titles, most notably
  Martina Navratilova and Monica Seles (though she hit with both hands for all
  her shots, she was a natural lefty and served left-handed). But since Seles’s
  too-short reign, there have been only three fellow left-handers to claim a
  women’s major, Petra Kvitova, Marketa Vondroušová and Angelique Kerber. What
  makes the paucity of left-handed champions in the sport’s recent history so
  puzzling is that there is a distinct advantage to being a lefty. Be it
  McEnroe’s twisting, slicing serve in the all-important ad court (the shot that
  some maintain drove Borg from the sport), or Nadal’s vicious high topspin
  forehands into Federer’s backhand, lefties have confounded even the most
  talented right-handed players throughout the sport’s history. The different
  ball trajectories and spins that the lefties impart are just so vastly
  different for the majority of players who are righties. And, to state it even
  more simply, from a young age left-handers are just more accustomed to hitting
  against right-handers than vice versa. The advantage that lefties have in
  tennis is not dissimilar to the edge southpaw pitchers enjoy in baseball, or
  left-handed bowlers have in cricket. Consider the fact that there are 84
  pitchers in the Hall of Fame and 18 are lefties, accounting for more than 20%
  which is around double the lefty percentage in the overall population. The
  serve and the pitch are the two most important components to the respective
  sports. And in each case their goal is to confound and confuse their foe. It
  does appear that a lefty renaissance in tennis may be under way. Leading the
  charge are Ben Shelton (natural lefty) and Jack Draper (a more Nadal-like
  lefty who switched dominant hands as a junior). The question that every top
  male American player hears relentlessly is whether he will be the “first
  American to win a slam since Andy Roddick”. If Shelton were to notch a major
  he’d also be the first American lefty since McEnroe in 1984 to do so. Shelton,
  the world No 6, won his first-round match at Flushing Meadows in straight sets
  on Sunday, and is having the best and most consistent year of his career.
  Despite a disappointing finish in Cincinnati, losing a lopsided quarter-final
  to Alexander Zverev, the Floridian did win his first Masters title in Canada
  earlier this month and is fast becoming a confident all-around player who is
  utilizing his leftyness to maximum advantage, especially with the wide
  ad-court serve. And though the task of breaking the stranglehold that Carlos
  Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have at the top of the sport is daunting, to say the
  least, Shelton has the tools – most notably his powerful serve – to provide a
  legitimate challenge. Shelton’s record against the top two doesn’t appear to
  offer much hope on paper as he has won only one of 10 meetings against Alcaraz
  and Sinner, but he has made it close on several occasions. It’ll be paramount
  for Shelton to – again – maximize the use of his tremendous serve if he were
  to play either of the top two. One of Shelton’s weaknesses when he first
  appeared on tour was his sometimes erratic play and go-for-broke style. But it
  is this exact component that he’ll need to summon if he is to threaten Sinner
  or Alcaraz. Nobody beats that duo by engaging in extended rallies. Chances
  have to be taken. Draper, like Shelton, is also enjoying his best year as a
  pro. His stellar run started at least year’s US Open when he made the
  semi-finals and it continued into 2025 as he, like Shelton, also won his first
  Masters title, at Indian Wells. Since he started up playing right handed,
  Draper has remarked on numerous occasions that his backhand is just as potent
  a weapon as his forehand. And there is a third lefty in the mix – arguably the
  most exciting of the bunch. Frenchman Terence Atmane arrived seemingly out of
  nowhere in Cincinnati as the qualifier took down two top-10 seeds (Taylor
  Fritz and Holger Rune) in addition to easily defeating another talented young
  player, João Fonseca. In the semi-final against Sinner, Atmane put a scare
  into the world No 1, pushing the Italian to a tiebreak in the first set,
  before coming down to earth in the second. With his hyper-abbreviated service
  motion and toss, Atmane brings to mind that other lefty from the 1970s, Roscoe
  Tanner. Atmane’s incredibly powerful serve doesn’t give the receiver much time
  to react and once the point starts, his high-rpm forehand is nearly impossible
  to defend. Rune and Fritz looked utterly blindsided in Cincinnati when facing
  the 23-year-old. Unfortunately, we won’t see Atmane at this year’s US Open
  after he was forced to withdraw with a foot injury. Contrast is good for
  sports, in fact it’s essential for drama. By having more lefties in the mix in
  tennis it can only add to the quality and uniqueness of the matchups. And with
  a slate of young southpaws making great strides, it’ll be sooner than later
  before a lefty again claims a men’s grand slam title.
