  At last week’s Alaska summit, Vladimir Putin made full control of Donbas –
  Ukraine’s industrial heartland in the east – a central condition for ending
  the war. According to sources briefed on the talks, the Russian leader
  demanded that Ukrainian forces withdraw from Donetsk and Luhansk, the two
  regions that make up Donbas, in exchange for a freeze along the rest of the
  frontline. Volodymyr Zelenskyy has consistently rejected giving up any
  territory under Kyiv’s control, making Donbas one of the defining faultlines
  of the peace talks. The idea is also deeply unpopular at home: about 75% of
  Ukrainians oppose formally ceding any land to Russia, according to polling by
  the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology. Putin’s drive to dominate the
  region dates back to 2014 when Moscow armed and financed separatist proxies
  and sent covert troops across the border. That campaign escalated into the
  full-scale invasion of 2022, when Russian forces seized much of the region
  outright. Today, Russia holds about 17,980 square miles (46,570 sq km), or
  roughly 88%, of Donbas, including the entirety of Luhansk and about
  three-quarters of Donetsk. Ukraine continues to hold several key cities and
  fortified positions in the Donetsk region, defended at the cost of tens of
  thousands of lives. More than 250,000 civilians remain in the parts of the
  region still under Ukrainian control. Where is Donbas and why does Putin want
  it? Short for Donets Basin, Donbas is an industrial heartland in eastern
  Ukraine rich in coal and heavy industry. It has long been one of Ukraine’s
  most Russian-speaking regions, shaped by waves of Russian migration during the
  Soviet industrial drive that turned its coalmines and steel plants into the
  engine of the USSR. Its political loyalties often leaned eastwards: Viktor
  Yanukovych, the Kremlin-backed president ousted in 2014, was born in Donetsk
  and built his power base there. Donbas was thrust into conflict in 2014 after
  Yanukovych was toppled by mass protests and fled the country. In the
  aftermath, Moscow seized Crimea and unrest spread across eastern Ukraine.
  Armed groups backed by Russian weapons and fighters declared the creation of
  self-proclaimed “people’s republics” in Donetsk and Luhansk. The separatist
  war fuelled resentment toward Moscow in Ukraine-held parts of Donbas. In
  Ukraine’s 2019 presidential election, voters there backed Zelenskyy by a wide
  margin. A Russian speaker himself, Zelenskyy campaigned on ending the conflict
  while safeguarding Ukraine’s sovereignty. From the outset of the invasion in
  February 2022, Putin cast the protection of Donbas residents as a central
  justification for launching what he termed his “special military operation”.
  In a televised address, he said the self-proclaimed people’s republics of
  Donetsk and Luhansk had appealed to Moscow for help, and he repeated unfounded
  claims that Russian-speaking residents were facing “genocide” at the hands of
  Kyiv. In reality, Donbas served as a pretext: within hours, Russian forces
  advanced far beyond the region, driving on Kyiv in an attempt to overthrow
  Zelenskyy’s government and seize control of the entire country. How does the
  average Russian view Donbas? For years, Russian state media tried to cultivate
  sympathy for Donbas, portraying Ukraine as discriminating against its
  Russian-speaking population, but it never truly struck a chord with the wider
  public. Unlike Crimea, which carried deep historical and emotional resonance
  for many Russians, Donbas remained a more distant and industrial region with
  little symbolic weight. On the eve of the full-scale invasion, independent
  polls showed that only about a quarter of Russians supported the idea of
  incorporating Donetsk and Luhansk into Russia. Since the invasion, however,
  the narrative has shifted: surveys indicate that a majority of Russians accept
  and support Putin’s stated aim of “protecting” the population of Donbas, and a
  majority back the annexation of the territories. Will Putin’s ambitions end
  with Donbas? Putin reportedly told Donald Trump in Alaska that in exchange for
  Donetsk and Luhansk, he would halt further advances and freeze the frontline
  in the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, where Russian
  forces occupy significant areas. In public, Putin has repeatedly said Russia
  is seeking full control of the four regions it claimed to have annexed in
  autumn 2022, including Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. He has also spoken of
  establishing so-called “buffer zones” inside Ukraine’s Kharkiv, Sumy and
  Chernihiv regions. “Putin has acted opportunistically; when he launched the
  invasion he had no fixed territorial limits in mind,” said a former high
  ranking Kremlin official. “His appetite grows once he’s tasted success.”
  Military analysts doubt whether Russia has the economic or military capacity
  to push much beyond Donbas and say the conflict could instead drag on for
  years as a grinding war of attrition in Ukraine. Ukraine has warned that
  conceding Donbas, with its string of fortified cities such as Sloviansk and
  Kramatorsk, would hand Russia a launchpad for deeper advances into central
  Ukraine.
