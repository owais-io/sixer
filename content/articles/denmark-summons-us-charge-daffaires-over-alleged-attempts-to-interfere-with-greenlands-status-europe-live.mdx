  Germany’s cabinet passed a draft bill that would introduce first a voluntary
  military service, and could lead to conscription if recruitment goals are
  missed, the government said in a statement, reported by Reuters. The defence
  ministry hopes the voluntary six-month scheme will help double the number of
  trained reservists from the current level of around 100,000 and that some of
  the volunteers will go on to have a career in active service. Minister Boris
  Pistorius wants to increase the number of soldiers in service from 180,000 to
  260,000 by the early 2030s to meet new Nato force targets and strengthen its
  defences – part of a planned surge in military spending, Reuters said. Merz
  and Pistorius are speaking now about the details, so let’s listen in. As we
  are waiting for Merz and Pistorius to show up, we are getting some news lines
  from Moscow, with the Kremlin saying its focus is on preparing Vladimir
  Putin’s “unprecedented” visit to China later this week. It added that it
  supported the US efforts to end the war in Ukraine and hoped they would
  continue. But at the same time the Kremlin appeared dismissive about European
  plans for security guarantees for Ukraine, saying Russia had a “negative” view
  of the proposals, and rejecting any plans for western troops to be stationed
  in Ukraine. It also added that it wouldn’t be helpful to discuss these issues
  publicly, Reuters reported. Meanwhile over in Germany, chancellor Friedrich
  Merz and defence minister Boris Pistorius are about to give a press conference
  on plans to strengthen the country’s army. You can watch it live below, and I
  will bring you any key news lines here. in Paris France is braced for another
  political crisis as the minority government of François Bayrou appears almost
  certain to be toppled in a confidence vote next month, amid deep political
  divisions over an unpopular austerity budget and debt-reduction plan. “I will
  fight like a dog,” the centrist prime minister told L’Express on Tuesday after
  his surprise decision to call a vote of confidence from parliamentarians.
  Bayrou, 74, a close ally of Emmanuel Macron, is expected to lose the vote as
  opposition parties on the far right and left said they would relish the
  opportunity to eject him after less than nine months in office. Boris Vallaud,
  the head of the Socialist parliamentary group, told BFM TV: “We need to change
  politics and for that we need to change prime minister.” Bayrou’s gamble –
  which involves Macron convening a special session of parliament on 8 September
  for a confidence vote that the prime minister has almost no chance of winning
  – has sparked fears of another political crisis less than a year after the
  previous government of Michel Barnier was toppled over budget disagreements
  after only three months. The Paris stock market tumbled, shares in French
  banks sank and the country’s borrowing costs rose on Tuesday as investors
  fretted. A planned protest movement against Bayrou’s proposed budget cuts,
  which gathered support on social media over the summer, as well as potential
  strikes and demonstrations by trade unions are expected to begin on 10
  September, regardless of whether Bayrou is forced to quit. The beleaguered
  politician attended a meeting of the CFDT trade union on Tuesday where he
  urged French political parties to think carefully about the vote, noting they
  had 13 days to “say whether they are on the side of chaos or responsibility”.
  Bayrou said: “Is there or is there not a national emergency to rebalance the
  accounts, to escape excessive debt by choosing to reduce our deficits and
  produce more? That is the central question.” In what was seen as a last-minute
  appeal to the left, he said he was prepared to demand a “specific effort” from
  high-wealth individuals, after his budget proposals were widely criticised for
  affecting poor people and pensioners while having less impact on the very
  wealthy. If Bayrou is ousted, Macron would be dragged into domestic upheaval
  at a significant international moment for him, as he positions himself to play
  a role on Ukraine and the recognition of a Palestinian state. Under the French
  political system, the president, who is head of state and has authority on
  foreign policy and national security, directly appoints a prime minister as
  head of government to run domestic affairs. Macron could swiftly appoint a new
  prime minister but they too could risk being ousted over the budget. A source
  close to the far-right leader Marine Le Pen told Reuters it was hard to see
  how any new prime minister could escape being hit by a vote of no confidence.
  Elsewhere, we are keeping an eye on the situation in France after the
  country’s prime minister François Bayrou announced his plan to call a vote of
  confidence in his government on 8 September, which he has almost no chance of
  winning. Let me bring you an update on this from our Paris correspondent,
  Angelique Chrisafis. In a separate update, Zelenskyy said that “more than
  100,000 households” in Ukraine remain without electricity after overnight
  Russian strikes on civilian infrastructure. He said: “Unfortunately, energy
  facilities were damaged. The attack caused power outages in the Poltava, Sumy,
  and Chernihiv regions, leaving more than one hundred thousand households
  without electricity. All emergency services are working on the ground to
  restore power as quickly as possible.” He then said: “The Russians continue
  the war and ignore the world’s calls to stop the killings and destruction. New
  steps are needed to increase pressure on Russia to stop the attacks and to
  ensure real security guarantees. We are working with our partners to exert
  such pressure.” In the last few minutes, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy issued another update after his phone call with Finland’s
  influential president Alexander Stubb. He said that progress is being made on
  “the architecture of strong and multilateral security guarantees with
  Ukraine,” but criticised Russia for “sending negative signals regarding
  meetings and further developments.” The Russians will only react to real
  pressure in response to all this. Here is what he said: “A very good
  conversation – as always. We are coordinating our positions to deliver more
  substantial results. Our teams are actively preparing the architecture of
  strong and multilateral security guarantees for Ukraine, with everyone
  involved – Europeans, Americans, and our other partners in the Coalition of
  the Willing. Military commanders, defence ministers, and security advisers –
  at different levels, we are preparing the components of future security. We
  are accelerating the process of defining the details. It is already time to
  organise the format for the leaders’ discussions to determine the key
  priorities and timelines. An important area is relations with the United
  States, ensuring maximum substance in these relations. Unfortunately, the
  Russians are currently sending negative signals regarding meetings and further
  developments. Strikes on our cities and villages continue. Every day there are
  new victims. The Russians will only react to real pressure in response to all
  this. Pressure is needed. We are counting on it. Concrete steps are needed
  from Russia – steps toward real diplomacy.” We are getting big news just in
  from Denmark, which has summoned the US charge d’affaires in the country over
  alleged attempts to interfere with the status of Greenland, a long-term point
  of interest for the new US administration of Donald Trump. In a comment to
  public broadcaster DR, foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said that “any
  attempt to interfere in the Kingdom’s internal affairs will obviously be
  unacceptable.” The move comes after DR reported that Danish intelligence
  services have uncovered a network of “at least three” people working on
  “influence operations” in Greenland to drive a wedge between Denmark and the
  territory, in a bid to pave the way for it to get closer to the United States.
  The broadcaster said it knew the names of the three American men involved in
  the operations, but chose not to publish them to protect sources. It said they
  were previously known to be close to Trump, but it was not immediately clear
  if they worked on the White House’s order or on their own. It alleged that one
  of the men visited Greenland to attend meetings and compile a list of
  potential allies and opponents of Donald Trump’s plans to take over the
  territory. He also allegedly urged Greenlanders to “point out cases that could
  be used to put Denmark in a bad light in American media,” DR said. The two
  other men were allegedly involved in building networks of contacts with
  politicians, business figures and community leaders to pursue Trump’s plans.
  The meeting with the US charge d’affaires is expected later today, Rasmussen
  said. In May, Wall Street Journal also reported that the US stepped up its
  intelligence operations to spy on Greenland, also prompting Rasmussen to
  summon US envoy for a chat. A Greenlandic parliamentarian, Aaja Chemnitz, told
  DR that it was unacceptable to “try to infiltrate Greenlandic society in this
  way,” insisting that “it is Greenland itself that must decide what we want and
  what kind of future we want.” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said
  last night he was making progress in talks with European and US partners on
  designing potential security guarantees for Ukraine should the war be brought
  to a close. In his nightly address, he said: “It is important that everything
  be as practical as possible – what forces on the ground, in the air, at sea –
  everything must be clearly defined. And the foundation of our security is our
  strong Ukrainian army, … which means long-term financing and the provision of
  weapons – all of this will be ensured. … We are working very substantively
  with the Americans following our meeting in Washington. We now have a new
  foundation for joint efforts. This is significant. The only signal Russia is
  sending indicates that it intends to continue evading real negotiations. This
  can be changed only through strong sanctions, strong tariffs – real pressure.”
  Separately, US peace envoy Steve Witkoff revealed overnight that he will be
  meeting with Ukrainian officials this week, insisting that US back-channel
  talks with both Ukraine and Russia continue. “I’m meeting with the Ukrainians
  this week. So I will be meeting with them this week in New York, and that’s a
  big signal. We talk to the Russians every day,” Witkoff said on Fox News.
  Elsewhere, I will be keeping an eye on a high-profile visit by French
  president Emmanuel Macron, German chancellor Friedrich Merz, and Polish prime
  minister Donald Tusk in Moldova. Their trip comes a month before high-stakes
  parliamentary elections in the country, with allegations of Russian
  interference and attempts to throw Moldova off its pro-EU course. All three
  leaders are having their own problems at home, but they will take a moment out
  of their busy schedules to send a message to the people of Moldova,
  encouraging them to confirm their pro-European choice in last year’s
  presidential election. I will bring you all the key updates here. It’s
  Wednesday, 27 August 2025, it’s Jakub Krupa here, and this is Europe Live.
  Good morning.
