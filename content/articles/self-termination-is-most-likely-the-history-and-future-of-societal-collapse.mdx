  “We can’t put a date on Doomsday, but by looking at the 5,000 years of
  [civilisation], we can understand the trajectories we face today – and
  self-termination is most likely,” says Dr Luke Kemp at the Centre for the
  Study of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge. “I’m pessimistic
  about the future,” he says. “But I’m optimistic about people.” Kemp’s new book
  covers the rise and collapse of more than 400 societies over 5,000 years and
  took seven years to write. The lessons he has drawn are often striking: people
  are fundamentally egalitarian but are led to collapses by enriched,
  status-obsessed elites, while past collapses often improved the lives of
  ordinary citizens. Today’s global civilisation, however, is deeply
  interconnected and unequal and could lead to the worst societal collapse yet,
  he says. The threat is from leaders who are “walking versions of the dark
  triad” – narcissism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism – in a world menaced by
  the climate crisis, nuclear weapons, artificial intelligence and killer
  robots. The work is scholarly, but the straight-talking Australian can also be
  direct, such as when setting out how a global collapse could be avoided.
  “Don’t be a dick” is one of the solutions proposed, along with a move towards
  genuinely democratic societies and an end to inequality. His first step was to
  ditch the word civilisation, a term he argues is really propaganda by rulers.
  “When you look at the near east, China, Mesoamerica or the Andes, where the
  first kingdoms and empires arose, you don’t see civilised conduct, you see
  war, patriarchy and human sacrifice,” he says. This was a form of evolutionary
  backsliding from the egalitarian and mobile hunter-gatherer societies which
  shared tools and culture widely and survived for hundreds of thousands of
  years. “Instead, we started to resemble the hierarchies of chimpanzees and the
  harems of gorillas.” Instead Kemp uses the term Goliaths to describe kingdoms
  and empires, meaning a society built on domination, such as the Roman empire:
  state over citizen, rich over poor, master over slave and men over women. He
  says that, like the biblical warrior slain by David’s slingshot, Goliaths
  began in the bronze age, were steeped in violence and often surprisingly
  fragile. Goliath states do not simply emerge as dominant cliques that loot
  surplus food and resources, he argues, but need three specific types of
  “Goliath fuel”. The first is a particular type of surplus food: grain. That
  can be “seen, stolen and stored”, Kemp says, unlike perishable foods. In
  Cahokia, for example, a society in North America that peaked around the 11th
  century, the advent of maize and bean farming led to a society dominated by an
  elite of priests and human sacrifice, he says. The second Goliath fuel is
  weaponry monopolised by one group. Bronze swords and axes were far superior to
  stone and wooden axes, and the first Goliaths in Mesopotamia followed their
  development, he says. Kemp calls the final Goliath fuel “caged land”, meaning
  places where oceans, rivers, deserts and mountains meant people could not
  simply migrate away from rising tyrants. Early Egyptians, trapped between the
  Red Sea and the Nile, fell prey to the pharaohs, for example. “History is best
  told as a story of organised crime,” Kemp says. “It is one group creating a
  monopoly on resources through the use of violence over a certain territory and
  population.” All Goliaths, however, contain the seeds of their own demise, he
  says: “They are cursed and this is because of inequality.” Inequality does not
  arise because all people are greedy. They are not, he says. The Khoisan
  peoples in southern Africa, for example, shared and preserved common lands for
  thousands of years despite the temptation to grab more. Instead, it is the few
  people high in the dark triad who fall into races for resources, arms and
  status, he says. “Then as elites extract more wealth from the people and the
  land, they make societies more fragile, leading to infighting, corruption,
  immiseration of the masses, less healthy people, overexpansion, environmental
  degradation and poor decision making by a small oligarchy. The hollowed-out
  shell of a society is eventually cracked asunder by shocks such as disease,
  war or climate change.” History shows that increasing wealth inequality
  consistently precedes collapse, says Kemp, from the Classical Lowland Maya to
  the Han dynasty in China and the Western Roman empire. He also points out that
  for the citizens of early rapacious regimes, collapse often improved their
  lives because they were freed from domination and taxation and returned to
  farming. “After the fall of Rome, people actually got taller and healthier,”
  he says. Collapses in the past were at a regional level and often beneficial
  for most people, but collapse today would be global and disastrous for all.
  “Today, we don’t have regional empires so much as we have one single,
  interconnected global Goliath. All our societies act within one single global
  economic system – capitalism,” Kemp says. He cites three reasons why the
  collapse of the global Goliath would be far worse than previous events. First
  is that collapses are accompanied by surges in violence as elites try to
  reassert their dominance. “In the past, those battles were waged with swords
  or muskets. Today we have nuclear weapons,” he says. Second, people in the
  past were not heavily reliant on empires or states for services and, unlike
  today, could easily go back to farming or hunting and gathering. “Today, most
  of us are specialised, and we’re dependent upon global infrastructure. If that
  falls away, we too will fall,” he says. “Last but not least is that,
  unfortunately, all the threats we face today are far worse than in the past,”
  he says. Past climatic changes that precipitated collapses, for example,
  usually involved a temperature change of 1C at a regional level. Today, we
  face 3C globally. There are also about 10,000 nuclear weapons, technologies
  such as artificial intelligence and killer robots and engineered pandemics,
  all sources of catastrophic global risk. Kemp says his argument that Goliaths
  require rulers who are strong in the triad of dark traits is borne out today.
  “The three most powerful men in the world are a walking version of the dark
  triad: Trump is a textbook narcissist, Putin is a cold psychopath, and Xi
  Jinping came to rule [China] by being a master Machiavellian manipulator.”
  “Our corporations and, increasingly, our algorithms, also resemble these kinds
  of people,” he says. “They’re basically amplifying the worst of us.” Kemp
  points to these “agents of doom” as the source of the current trajectory
  towards societal collapse. “These are the large, psychopathic corporations and
  groups which produce global catastrophic risk,” he says. “Nuclear weapons,
  climate change, AI, are only produced by a very small number of secretive,
  highly wealthy, powerful groups, like the military-industrial complex, big
  tech and the fossil fuel industry. “The key thing is this is not about all of
  humanity creating these threats. It is not about human nature. It is about
  small groups who bring out the worst in us, competing for profit and power and
  covering all [the risks] up.” The global Goliath is the endgame for humanity,
  Kemp says, like the final moves in a chess match that determine the result. He
  sees two outcomes: self-destruction or a fundamental transformation of
  society. He believes the first outcome is the most likely, but says escaping
  global collapse could be achieved. “First and foremost, you need to create
  genuine democratic societies to level all the forms of power that lead to
  Goliaths,” he says. That means running societies through citizen assemblies
  and juries, aided by digital technologies to enable direct democracy at large
  scales. History shows that more democratic societies tend to be more
  resilient, he says. “If you’d had a citizens’ jury sitting over the [fossil
  fuel companies] when they discovered how much damage and death their products
  would cause, do you think they would have said: ‘Yes, go ahead, bury the
  information and run disinformation campaigns’? Of course not,” Kemp says.
  Escaping collapse also requires taxing wealth, he says, otherwise the rich
  find ways to rig the democratic system. “I’d cap wealth at $10m. That’s far
  more than anyone needs. A famous oil tycoon once said money is just a way for
  the rich to keep score. Why should we allow these people to keep score at the
  risk of destroying the entire planet?” If citizens’ juries and wealth caps
  seem wildly optimistic, Kemp says we have been long brainwashed by rulers
  justifying their dominance, from the self-declared god-pharaohs of Egypt and
  priests claiming to control the weather to autocrats claiming to defend people
  from foreign threats and tech titans selling us their techno-utopias. “It’s
  always been easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of Goliaths.
  That’s because these are stories that have been hammered into us over the
  space of 5,000 years,” he says. “Today, people find it easier to imagine that
  we can build intelligence on silicon than we can do democracy at scale, or
  that we can escape arms races. It’s complete bullshit. Of course we can do
  democracy at scale. We’re a naturally social, altruistic, democratic species
  and we all have an anti-dominance intuition. This is what we’re built for.”
  Kemp rejects the suggestion that he is simply presenting a politically
  leftwing take on history. “There is nothing inherently left wing about
  democracy,” he says. “Nor does the left have a monopoly on fighting
  corruption, holding power accountable and making sure companies pay for the
  social and environmental damages they cause. That’s just making our economy
  more honest.” He also has a message for individuals: “Collapse isn’t just
  caused by structures, but also people. If you want to save the world then the
  first step is to stop destroying it. In other words: don’t be a dick. Don’t
  work for big tech, arms manufacturers or the fossil fuel industry. Don’t
  accept relationships based on domination and share power whenever you can.”
  Despite the possibility of avoiding collapse, Kemp remains pessimistic about
  our prospects. “I think it’s unlikely,” he says. “We’re dealing with a
  5,000-year process that is going to be incredibly difficult to reverse, as we
  have increasing levels of inequality and of elite capture of our politics.
  “But even if you don’t have hope, it doesn’t really matter. This is about
  defiance. It’s about doing the right thing, fighting for democracy and for
  people to not be exploited. And even if we fail, at the very least, we didn’t
  contribute to the problem.” Goliath’s Curse by Luke Kemp (Penguin Books Ltd,
