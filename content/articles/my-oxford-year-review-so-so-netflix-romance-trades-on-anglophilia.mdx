webTitle: My Oxford Year review – so-so Netflix romance trades on anglophilia
sectionName: Film

  Call it the Bridgerton effect, which itself was arguably the result of The
  Crown effect, but the Netflix algorithm is currently aimed toward the UK with
  moonier eyes than usual. Last month saw Lena Dunham recount her days as an
  American getting to grips with the realities of London in Too Much, and as
  production begins on yet another adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, here comes
  the sudsy romance My Oxford Year where the object of affection is England
  itself. One might assume that a university-set film directed by The
  Inbetweeners creator Iain Morris would be a ribald comedy geared toward a
  younger male crowd, but My Oxford Year, based on a novel by Julia Whelan,
  picks sentiment over sauce. It’s a frothy, throwaway fantasy about another
  American hoping to find herself in another country, think of Emily in Paris
  but Anna in Oxford. Anna (in-house Netflix star Sofia Carson) is a
  working-class New Yorker who has decided to defer her job at Goldman Sachs for
  a year so that she can study at Oxford, indulging her love of literature
  before she disappears into a life of numbers. Her idealised view is somewhat
  confirmed. There’s undeniable historical beauty surrounding her (unlike so
  many other Netflix films, some on-location shooting helps to seduce those
  watching too) but in maybe the film’s only really amusing moment, we also see
  Anna having to reckon with the less postcard-suited side of life as her new
  friends show her what a perfect English evening looks like: watching an
  episode of Naked Attraction. Like any of the many Americans before her, from
  Andie MacDowell to Julia Roberts, she also finds herself falling for a foppish
  gent, fellow bibliophile Jamie (Bridgerton alum Corey Mylchreest). They are
  given a laughably convoluted meet-cute – his fancy car splashes a cartoonishly
  oversized puddle on her, she then sees him at the chippy and lands him in hot
  water with the woman he’s hiding from, she then finds out he’s her replacement
  teacher for the year (!) – and a romance the colour of beige follows. There
  are initial attempts to add some spice – he’s a privileged fuckboy who leaves
  conquests in his wake and she’s a salt of the earth overachiever who puts him
  in his place – but there’s not enough juicy conflict between them. It’s all
  boringly plain sailing until it suddenly isn’t and the film takes a turn from
  romcom into something more dramatic. More dramatic but also less interesting,
  as Anna finds out why Jamie has been holding back and given how the film
  handles the reveal like a twist, I’ll spare the details but when it comes,
  it’s met with a sigh of disappointment for we know exactly what story we’re
  being told and every single beat that will follow. It’s such well-mined
  territory that at this stage, to keep us even somewhat invested in such a
  rehash, we’d need something with far more texture or emotional rawness than
  this. The unsuccessful swerve then overwhelms any of the potentially knottier,
  more engaging elements of managing differences of class, choosing between art
  and commerce and grappling with a life caught between two different
  continents. Morris is a competent enough director but the script, from Allison
  Burnett and Melissa Osborne, is devoid of any real electricity, leaving it up
  to the leads to generate it. Carson is a better fit here than she was at
  playing a scrappy mess in Netflix’s similarly vanilla hit The Life List, but
  she’s a little indistinctive, not quite magnetic enough to carry the weight of
  an every-scene lead performance. There’s more promise in Mylchreest, whose
  Hugh Grant cosplay is charming enough to suggest that with a sharper, wittier
  script he could really do something with it. As passive Netflix watches go –
  consumed while doing something else, destined to be forgotten about almost
  instantaneously – it’s better than some but as last year’s adjacent romantic
  weepie It Ends With Us showed, there’s so much more to be done in territory
  that often gets unfairly and snobbishly downgraded. There are big, relatable
  emotions to be mined but that grand sweep just never arrives in My Oxford
  Year, a late summer vacation that leaves us firmly on the couch. My Oxford
  Year is now available on Netflix
