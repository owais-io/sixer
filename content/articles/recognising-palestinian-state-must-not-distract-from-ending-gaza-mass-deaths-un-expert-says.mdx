  The United Nations special rapporteur for the occupied territories has warned
  that moves to recognise a Palestinian state should not distract member states
  from stopping mass death and starvation in Gaza. “Of course it’s important to
  recognize the state of Palestine,” Francesca Albanese told the Guardian after
  several more countries responded to the mounting starvation in Gaza by
  announcing plans to recognize an independent Palestine. “It’s incoherent that
  they’ve not done it already.” But she argued that the prolonged debate around
  Palestinian statehood has so far yielded no political progress, and instead
  enabled the spread of illegal Israeli settlements in occupied territory which
  have all but precluded the possibility of a Palestinian state. “The territory
  has been literally eaten out by the advancement of the annexation and
  colonization,” she said. This week, Australia joined the United Kingdom,
  Canada, France and other countries in pledging to recognize a Palestinian
  state at the United Nations general assembly next month. The prime minister,
  Anthony Albanese, (no relation) described the two-state solution as
  “humanity’s best hope to break the cycle of violence in the Middle East”. But
  the special rapporteur cautioned that the renewed push for Palestinian
  statehood should not “distract the attention from where it should be: the
  genocide”. She called for an embargo on all arms sales to Israel and a
  cessation of trade agreements – as well as accountability for the war crimes
  and crimes against humanity with which the international criminal court has
  charged top Israeli officials. She also called for a complete Israeli
  withdrawal from occupied territory by the 17 September deadline set by the UN
  general assembly. “Ending the question of Palestine in line with international
  law is possible and necessary: end the genocide today, end the permanent
  occupation this year, and end apartheid,” she said. “This is what’s going to
  guarantee freedom and equal rights for everyone, regardless of the way they
  want to live – in two states or one state, they will have to decide.” In her
  three years as rapporteur, but especially since the beginning of Israel’s war
  in Gaza following the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks, Albanese has become one of
  the most outspoken and recognizable advocates for Palestinian rights. Her
  technical reports accusing Israel of operating an “apartheid regime” and
  committing “acts of genocide” have often anticipated major international and
  Israeli rights groups reaching the same conclusions. Last month, the Trump
  administration sanctioned Albanese over her outspoken support for Palestinian
  rights and what US officials called her “shameful promotion” of ICC action
  against Israeli officials. While Albanese has described herself as a reluctant
  “chronicler of genocide”, and others have called her “the voice of the global
  conscience”, she has also drawn condemnation and attacks – including
  accusations of antisemitism so persistent that she at one point sat down for a
  TV interview in which the first question posed to her was: “Are you an
  antisemite?” “Antisemitism and discrimination against Jews as Jews is gross,”
  Albanese told the Guardian in an earlier interview in December. “But frankly I
  couldn’t care less if Israel were run by Jews, Muslims, Christians or
  atheists… All I want is for Israel to conduct itself in line with
  international law.” Albanese described the growing global split over Israel’s
  actions in Gaza as “the ultimate struggle” and a matter of “light and
  darkness”. She characterized the US’s sanctions against her as a sign not of
  strength “but of guilt”. “The US is a country of contradictions, full of
  ideals and principles and still, plotting against democratic values,” she
  said. “Those in power – Democrats or Republicans – have always been led by
  this kind of supremacist logic toward others, and this strategy is openly
  betraying the US values of democracy, of fundamental freedoms, and really
  leveling everything that they have been preaching.” She also criticized the UN
  secretary general, António Guterres, for failing to more forcefully condemn
  the “unprecedented violation” of the privileges and immunities traditionally
  afforded to UN representatives. A spokesperson for Guterres said earlier that
  the sanctions against her set a dangerous precedent, but noted that Albanese
  does not report to him. The rapporteur’s mandate is entrusted by the UN Human
  Rights Council. Albanese described the recent gathering of the Hague Group – a
  30-nation conference held in Colombia to set out practical steps for UN member
  states to take measures in support of Israel ending the occupation, as “an
  ethical force inside the system”, which she said was “premised upon a basic
  respect of international law and the honoring of multilateralism, which seems
  to me the basic ingredient to have a functioning international community”.
  That stands in contrast to a UN that Albanese believes is living a “moment of
  existential crisis”. “[The UN] needs to decide whether to be a real,
  multilateral platform,” she said. “We are no longer in the settler-colonial
  bloc kind of mentality that conceived the birth of the UN. Now there are 193
  member states, and all of them have agency and all of them must be respected.
  Now is the time to cut the umbilical cord from the veto-power mentality and
  put the emphasis on the general assembly.” Albanese noted that Israel’s
  21-month war in Gaza had prompted a “profound shift” in global views of the
  conflict, as well as “brutal repression”. “We see millions of people taking to
  the streets and asking for an end to the genocide, and they’re being beaten
  and arrested and held on counts of terrorism, while those who are wanted by
  the ICC for war crimes are being received and allowed to fly over European and
  western space,” she said. “This is absurd. This is the end of the rule of
  law.” International law, she added, “is not a prophecy … It is a tool that
  must be used in order to fix things. And in fact, when people use it in court,
  they generally win.” But she sounded a note of optimism about the shifting
  discourse around Israel’s actions. “An entire new generation now speaks the
  language of human rights,” she said. “For me, this is a success in and of
  itself.” The widening gap between those in power and millions of people that
  have taken to the streets worldwide in support of Palestinians is in part why
  her most recent report focused not on Israeli actions but on the global
  corporations that she says are “profiting from genocide”. “The occupation is
  profitable, and so is the genocide, and this is shocking, but it is to be
  known in order to be seen and to be stopped,” she noted. “The power is not
  just with the prime ministers or with the governments. The power is with us,
  and we can start choosing through our wallet.” As for Palestinians, despite
  their monumental suffering and the ever-mounting death toll, “they have
  already won the legitimacy battle,” Albanese said. “Everyone knows what Israel
  has done to them for the past 77 years,” she said. “They’ve already made
  history – and not through violence as some try to portray them – but with
  their perseverance and principles and trust in the justice system, which has
  not been their ally.”
