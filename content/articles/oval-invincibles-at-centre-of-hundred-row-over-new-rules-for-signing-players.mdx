  The Hundred franchises are in dispute over new rules for signing players next
  season amid moves from some new investors to break up the Oval Invincibles
  all-conquering men’s squad, who won the competition for the third successive
  year on Sunday. As revealed by the Guardian last week, the eight teams have
  decided to abandon the established draft system in favour of an Indian Premier
  League-style open auction, but have yet to reach agreement on how many players
  each team will retain from their existing squads, if any. The player retention
  issue is understood to have been the main area of discussion at the first
  meeting of the newly established Hundred Board on Monday, which broke up
  without consensus being reached. Under the existing rules, each franchise can
  retain up to 10 players from their 15-strong squads automatically as well as
  make one direct overseas signing, with the rest of the squad made up of
  players recruited in the draft at the start of the season. Oval Invincibles
  chose to use all 10 of their retention slots this season and have kept a
  largely settled squad built around a core of Surrey players, with seven of the
  players who lifted the trophy at Lord’s having been with the franchise since
  the competition launched in 2021. Welsh Fire, in contrast, retained only six
  players in their men’s squad. A number of different models were discussed at
  Monday’s board meeting, varying from keeping the existing retention rules to
  abandoning them altogether and holding a free-for-all auction next year. Oval
  Invincibles , who will be rebranded as MI London next year following the
  imminent £60m investment from Reliance Industries, want to keep the existing
  rules in place as far as possible, but could find themselves outvoted despite
  the huge influence of their new part-owners, the Ambani family. A compromise
  would see the number of player retentions reduced to enable some continuity,
  while also presenting next year’s Hundred as a major relaunch with more
  movement between the teams. In the IPL player retentions are capped at six, of
  whom only five can be capped internationals, a number that has increased in
  recent years. Given that four of the new Hundred investors own IPL franchises,
  and two others are from India, a similar model for the Hundred could end up
  being adopted. Another issue discussed on Monday was whether to hold a
  so-called mega-auction every few years in line with the television broadcast
  cycle, with fewer retention slots and more player movement, starting next
  season. The salary cap will also be increased, although in a significant
  change franchises will have more freedom to spend their budget as they see
  fit. In the new system, teams will be invited to bid for players who have
  registered to play in the competition in an open market. Under the draft
  rules, franchises took turns to sign players at set salary bands, which were
  capped at £65,000 for women and £200,000 for men this year, in a predetermined
  order.
