  summer festivals

  For Orlando Gutierrez in Kansas City, the thought of cancelling his
  community’s summer Colombian Independence Day festival first surfaced “the
  week after the inauguration” in January, “when the raids started happening”.
  The decision was rooted in “trying to be safe”, Gutierrez said. “We’re not
  talking about folks that are irregular in terms of their immigration status.
  You only have to look a certain way and speak a certain language and then
  you’re in danger.” For decades prior to 2025, the event had gone on
  interrupted – “in rain, in extreme heat” – and hosted thousands of Colombians
  and non-Colombians alike, Gutierrez said. “Our mission is to share our culture
  with people that don’t know it,” he added. “To not have the opportunity –
  that’s where it hurts the most.” In Donald Trump’s second term as president,
  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has been historically expansionist:
  it now aims for an unprecedented 3,000 minimum arrests a day. Its agents have
  thrown undocumented people, residents with protected legal status, and even
  American citizens into a deportation system that increasingly does not respect
  due process. Out of fear of being targeted indiscriminately, cultural and
  musical events from coast to coast – block parties and summer concerts in
  California; Mexican heritage celebrations in Chicago; soccer fan watch parties
  in Massachusetts – have been postponed or canceled altogether. Even religious
  gatherings are no longer perceived as safe from Ice. In San Bernardino,
  California, Bishop Alberto Rojas has dispensed his congregation from the
  obligation to attend mass out of fear of deportation raids. Every decision to
  cancel is heartbreaking. In Philadelphia, Carnaval de Puebla, which was
  scheduled for April, made the call to cancel in February, said organizer Olga
  Rentería. “We believe this is not a time to celebrate,” Rentería explained,
  “but a time to remain united, informed, and strong.” In Los Angeles,
  organizers of Festival Chapín, a celebration of Guatemalan culture, have
  postponed the event from this August to October. “It was really hard to take
  that decision,” Walter Rosales, a restaurateur and one of the event’s
  organizers, told the Guardian. “We have a lot of attendees; more than 50,000
  people every year. People have hotels, they have flights. We hire people to be
  there. But I think it was the best [choice.] The first thing we want is the
  security of the people.” Rosales said he hopes that by waiting a few months,
  Festival Chapín can take place amid a different political climate, one in
  which Ice sticks to promises made by Trump to target primarily undocumented
  people with criminal records. But mass raids are likely to get more frequent:
  the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, legislation forced through Congress by
  Republicans and signed into law by Trump on the Fourth of July, will slash
  social programs while funding Ice at levels comparable to the budget of the US
  army. It means that even huge stars are questioning whether concerts are safe
  for their fans. When the Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny announced a recent
  tour that skips the continental US altogether, social media speculation
  centered on the notion that the artist did not want to put his fans in Ice’s
  crosshairs. That theorizing was in part fueled by Bad Bunny’s own dips into
  the wider political conversation: he’s called Ice agents “sons of bitches” on
  social media and his “NUEVAYoL” video – in which the Statue of Liberty is
  garlanded with the Puerto Rican flag – is a lovely and grand ode to New York’s
  immigrants. Of avoiding the US on his upcoming tour, the artist himself has
  only said that, after touring regularly in the US in recent years, more dates
  at this time were “unnecessary”. (A representative for Bad Bunny did not
  respond to a request for comment.) Gabriel Gonzales, the bandleader of the Los
  Angeles Latin music ensemble La Verdad, said some of their gigs have had to be
  cancelled this summer. “A lot of people are very scared to go out,” he said.
  “It’s kind of like the pandemic all over again.” But as La Verdad continue to
  perform around Los Angeles and elsewhere, Gonzales is finding new meaning in
  playing live amid the Trump administration’s policies. “It’s not like a
  rebellion,” he said. “It’s more like a resistance. As musicians, we are there
  to take people away for a few moments. I see communities pulling together and
  I feel like everything is going to be OK.” For Joyas Mestizas, a Seattle-based
  Mexican folk dance youth group, which cancelled their annual festival this
  year, the plan is to be “more creative” going forward. “But we’re not going
  anywhere,” said the group’s co-director, Luna Garcia. “If I have to teach kids
  out of my basement, I’ll do it. The kids are going to dance.” *** For some
  organizers of cultural events for Latino communities, pushing through and
  executing their plans despite fears of raids has become its own kind of
  crusade. In July, federal agents were spotted on the premises of Chicago’s
  National Museum of Puerto Rican Arts &amp; Culture just days before the
  institution was scheduled to hold its annual Barrio Arts Festival. The museum
  said the agents entered the property, “refused multiple requests to present a
  warrant, badge, or identification”, and “informed museum staff that they were
  assessing entry and exit points for upcoming events that may draw undocumented
  attendees”. (In a statement, homeland security said agents “staged and held a
  quick briefing in the Museum’s parking lot in advance of an enforcement action
  related to a narcotics investigation”.) In response to the presence of the
  federal agents, the museum decided not to cancel the festival – but, rather,
  to ensure it would go forward without endangering its attendees. Veronica
  Ocasio, the museum’s director of education and programming, said that in the
  days before Barrio Arts, she and her team “met nonstop” in order to create “as
  tight a security plan as we could”. The museum is located inside Chicago’s
  Humboldt Park; in order to cover the park’s 200 acres, Ocasio and her
  co-organizers assembled a group of volunteer immigration advocates who created
  a trigger warning and stood guard on rotation for the entirety of the two-day
  festival. If Ice agents were spotted, the museum was ready to shut down the
  event, close the gates, and bunker in place – holding attendees inside until
  the agents left. The plan then called for Ocasio and other museum employees to
  stand out front with immigration attorneys, holding the fort. Delia Ramirez,
  an Illinois congresswoman, was also a key part of the museum’s plan. In order
  to head off potential Ice raids, Ramirez as well as other elected officials
  were on the premises “around the clock”, she said. “State representatives,
  city council folks, the mayor. All to protect constituents from homeland
  security.” “The president has taken away people’s healthcare so he can hire
  more Ice agents to terrorize communities,” added Ramirez, but that doesn’t
  mean “there’s no oversight or accountability. At a time where the federal
  government wants to harm you, we will keep each other safe”. For Ramirez,
  Barrio Arts Festival was “a beautiful showing of people saying to Ice, ‘not
  here, not now, not ever’.” Beyond her support for local cultural events,
  Ramirez is attempting to push back on Ice action more broadly: she’s a
  co-sponsor of the No Anonymity in Immigration Enforcement Act which would
  prohibit Ice from the now-common practice of carrying out their deportation
  actions while masked. “People are freaking the hell out,” she said. “They
  don’t know whether it’s an Ice agent who is going to criminalize them with no
  due process or it’s someone who wants to rob them. No other law enforcement
  agency does this.” Ultimately, not only did the Puerto Rican event in Chicago
  go on without interruption, but it was “our largest, most well attended Barrio
  Fest in our 25-year history”, Ocasio said. “We stood against intimidation and
  we created a blueprint for festivals in the city of Chicago.” The museum has
  already shared the safety plan it developed on the fly with organizers of
  upcoming events representing the local Colombian and Mexican communities. ***
  Ahead of New York’s Colombia Independence Day festival – held in July in
  Corona, a working-class neighborhood in Queens – organizers were similarly
  concerned about the possibility of Ice raids. They took precautions by
  bordering off the event, marking it as private, and creating a single entrance
  point where they would have stopped Ice agents operating without a warrant,
  organizers said. Like Chicago’s Barrio Arts Festival, they had lawyers on hand
  from a local legal services organization. Ultimately, like Barrio Arts, they
  too set a new attendance record, with around 20,000 festival goers. Catalina
  Cruz, a New York state assembly member who helped plan the Colombian festival,
  said that all the precautions she and her fellow organizers took “doesn’t
  explain why so many people came out – from all over the city and beyond”. She
  credited attendees with a certain kind of mental fortitude: “I’m not in their
  minds, but I don’t think they were giving a fuck about the president.” Of
  course, that fuzzy feeling of having put on a successful mass event for the
  Latino community in the era of all-pervading fear of Ice isn’t a panacea. As
  Cruz put it: “What would have really stopped [Ice] if they wanted to get in?
  As we have seen in the case of California” – where federal agents have
  forcefully and en masse raided parks and working farms – “not a goddamn
  thing.” Newly flush with cash thanks to the Big Beautiful Bill Act, Ice is now
  actively recruiting waves of new agents – to, in their words, “defend the
  homeland” – by offering $50,000 signing bonuses and student loan forgiveness.
  Tom Homan, the Trump administration’s border czar, has promised to “flood the
  zone” with Ice agents in New York and other sanctuary cities. But on that
  Sunday in Queens, the Colombian festival ticked along beautifully with no
  sight or sound of the federal government’s aggressive deportation machine.
  Vendors pushed street-cart ceviche and plastic pouches full of high-octane,
  primary-color beverages: “Coctelitos, coctelitos!” Seemingly every other
  person wore the powerful yellow jersey of the Colombian national soccer team.
  Twentysomethings salsa’d next to older family members grooving in their
  wheelchairs. When a performer with serious pipes sang the Star Spangled
  Banner, everybody perked up. When she followed it up with the national anthem
  of Colombia, throat-bursting singalongs broke out. After she wrapped up, the
  DJ smashed the ehh-ehh-EHH horns and, all together, folks chanted: “Viva
  Colombia! Viva Colombia!”
