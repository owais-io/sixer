  The White House will soon begin construction of a new $200m ballroom to be
  ready before Donald Trump’s term ends in early 2029. The press secretary,
  Karoline Leavitt, said the building would be 90,000 sq ft (8,300 sq metres)
  and hold up to 650 seats. It will be the latest change introduced to what is
  known as “the People’s House” since the Republican president returned to
  office in January. It also will be the first structural change to the
  executive mansion itself since the addition of the Truman Balcony in 1948. The
  White House is currently unable to hold large-scale events, given the
  200-person capacity in the White House’s East Room. In a phone interview with
  NBC News, Trump pointed to the White House’s set-up for large-scale events,
  which necessitates ferrying guests to tents set up on the South Lawn. “When it
  rains or snows, it’s a disaster,” Trump said, noting that tents are currently
  set up “a football field away from the White House”. In Trump’s view, a new
  ballroom has long been in demand. “I’m doing a lot of improvements,” Trump
  said to NBC. “I’ll be building a beautiful ballroom. They wanted it for many,
  many years.” Levitt said funding for the addition will come from Trump, as
  well as other “patriot donors”, according to the White House website, leading
  Trump to label the project as “his gift to the country”. McCrery Architects
  has been chosen to complete the design, with Clark Construction as the
  construction lead, and AECOM handling engineering. The ballroom will be
  separate from the White House’s main building, and will take the place of the
  current East Wing. The project fits nicely in the wheelhouse of America’s
  real-estate magnate president, who has taken the presidential tradition of
  redecoration a step further. While Trump’s past changes, such as paving
  portions of the Rose Garden and layering gold filigree throughout the White
  House, are easily reversible, a new ballroom building would last long after
  Trump leaves office.
