  Earlier this month, I helped organise a protest to defend the refugees holed
  up at the Thistle City Barbican hotel in London. We mobilised 800 people to
  support the asylum seekers, who waved back at us from the hotel to show their
  gratitude. On the other side of the road, about 250 people had gathered to
  demand the hotel be closed. Speakers there called refugees “illegal”,
  “invaders” and “parasites”. Seeing and hearing our opponents, the anti-racists
  responded with a spontaneous chant of “Nazi scum, off our streets”, which our
  side was able to sustain for more than an hour. I understand why people wanted
  to express their contempt for the people who tell lies about refugees, but the
  chant didn’t strike me as effective when I heard it, and the more I have
  thought about it since, the more convinced I am that it was the wrong
  strategy. There were fascists present at the demonstration – one banner
  advertised a small hard-right group – but they were not the organisers; they
  hung back, mute, at the edge of the protest. The crowd did chant in support of
  Tommy Robinson. The latter, I suspect, is probably the link that organisations
  like Stand Up to Racism lean on when labelling the current anti-refugee
  movement as fascist. (Many of the protests, their spokesperson has said, “are
  organised by known fascists and Hitler admirers”.) But Robinson, unlike the
  fascists of the 1970s, doesn’t leaven his speeches with reworked passages from
  Mein Kampf. He isn’t a “Hitler admirer”, nor is he perceived as such by the
  movement. He used to boast of having a Churchill quote tattooed on his arm.
  The strategy of labelling our enemies fascist depends on a context where the
  mainstream is willing to isolate and shame Nazis. Those are not the times we
  are living in. So a smarter, more tailored message is necessary. Take Robert
  Jenrick, the shadow lord chancellor, who recently attended an anti-refugee
  protest in Epping. Anti-fascists released a photograph from the protest
  featuring Jenrick with Eddy Butler in the background – Butler is a former
  election candidate for the British National party and was the guru behind its
  “rights for whites” campaign in the 1990s. What was most revealing about the
  incident was what came next: a “source close” to Jenrick said he did not know
  who Butler was; Jenrick kept the photographs of his time in Epping showing on
  his X profile. He made it clear he wasn’t embarrassed, and the story
  dissipated to nothing. If the movement was perceived as fascist – by Jenrick,
  or by the other Conservative and Reform politicians who have associated
  themselves with it, or by the Labour ministers who have conceded the right’s
  main demands and agreed to close the refugee hotels – then it would not be as
  confident and unrepentant as it is. And behind the politicians who have
  flattered the street movement are a much larger group who share its insistence
  on describing migration in negative terms. Keir Starmer, the prime minister,
  tweeted than a dozen times in August about migration – every one of his
  messages has presented it as problematic, “illegal” or the work of criminal
  people smugglers. In the weeks since the Barbican protest, the anti-refugee
  movement has kept up its momentum. Calling them Nazis – even when there were
  fascists present at the edges of their event – has done little to undermine
  them. They don’t believe they are fascists; they don’t have organised fascists
  in their leading circles. The term seems to them exaggerated, laughable. You
  may say I’m expecting too much of one term; even if the fascist label had
  worked, and got under our opponents’ skins, there is no way we would know it
  was working. But in the 1970s, it was common for former supporters of the
  National Front to break with that campaign and to cite its fascism as their
  reason for leaving. Here is one defector quoted in the East End Advertiser in
  1977, explaining that she abandoned the far right when she saw pictures of
  Front leader John Tyndall dressed in a Nazi uniform. “I won’t stand for any of
  this Sieg Heil nonsense,” the former NF member said. (This was, of course, a
  mere 30 years after the blitz; east London still bore the physical scars left
  by German bombs.) If the same tactics were working 50 years later,
  anti-fascists would be meeting people like that and making sure their stories
  were in the press. When we deal with the far right now, we are facing a
  movement that is pushing forward a group of female leaders – that feels
  different from five years ago, let alone 50 years since. In Islington, one of
  the speeches came from a woman described as running a local nursery (it was
  read out on her behalf). The contemporary far right is focused on pushing a
  single narrative about refugees, all based on the same logic – that the people
  in the hotel are single men, are foreigners, and on both scores are likely to
  be sexual predators. This argument wins supporters, and it shields them from
  accusations that they are extremists. The only way to confront this is to meet
  it head on, by rejecting any idea that foreign men – or Muslims – are more
  prone to sexual offences than their British counterparts. The logic of the
  argument is racist – it relies on the assumption that just because they are
  migrants, or asylum seekers, or not white (and with no other supportive
  evidence), they must be more prone to sexual violence than the men who already
  live here. And the simplest, one-line refutation of it is to look at the men
  who were convicted of offences in the various race riots that followed events
  at Southport last year. Of those men who attend the far-right protests, a
  staggering 40% have been reported to the police for domestic violence. There
  is, in other words, probably no single group of people – not in Britain or
  anywhere else – who are more prone to violence against women than the people
  now standing outside the hotels denouncing refugees. This, rather than
  shouting Nazi, is the argument most likely to undermine the anti-refugee
  protests. We need to be using it in our leaflets, when we talk to people, and
  on our protests. David Renton is a barrister and the author of The New
