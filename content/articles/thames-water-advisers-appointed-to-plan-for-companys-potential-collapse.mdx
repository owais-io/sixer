  UK ministers have appointed insolvency advisers to make contingency plans for
  the potential collapse of Thames Water. The company, which supplies 16 million
  customers, has been racing to pull together a deal to avoid financial
  collapse. In a development first reported by Sky News, Steve Reed, the
  environment secretary, has signed off the appointment of FTI Consulting to
  advise on plans for Thames Water to be placed into a special administration
  regime (SAR). The appointment indicates that FTI is the frontrunner to act as
  administrator if the government enacted an SAR, although a court would
  ultimately approve such a step. The government has been trying to avoid such
  an outcome, with the Treasury threatening that a potential £4bn bill from the
  SAR could be forced on to Reed’s department. This process would ensure that
  the taps stayed on for customers but would heap immediate costs on to the
  government. However, the government’s Water (Special Measures) Act contains a
  provision for SAR costs to be recouped from customer bills further down the
  line. Thames faced embarrassment earlier this year when its preferred bidder,
  KKR, pulled out of a deal at the last minute. Now, its class A creditors, who
  hold the bulk of the company’s senior debt, are in talks with the regulator,
  Ofwat, about a deal to inject capital into the company, which has £17.7bn of
  net debts and regulatory gearing of 84.4%. The company has been trying to get
  Ofwat to write off more than £1bn in expected fines from failures to invest in
  infrastructure to stop sewage spills, in order to secure a rescue deal. Chris
  Weston, chief executive of Thames Water, told a recent parliament committee
  that the company could not afford to pay these fines and continue to invest
  and operate as was expected by the regulator. A company spokesperson said:
  “Our focus remains on a holistic and fundamental recapitalisation, delivering
  a market-led solution, which includes targeting investment-grade credit
  ratings and returning the company to a stable financial foundation.
  “Constructive discussions with our many stakeholders continue.” Andy
  Prendergast, national secretary of the GMB union, said: “Thames Water has been
  sacrificed on the altar of privatisation. It’s sinking without a trace under a
  deluge of debt, while huge amounts of cash from inflated customer bills have
  flooded out to directors, shareholders and loan servicing. “If you want an
  advert for why private companies shouldn’t be involved in certain sectors,
  this is it. Yet another damning indictment of Thatcher’s terrible legacy. “The
  government must now intervene to find a water-tight solution that protects
  Thames’ millions of customers and gives immediate guarantees for the thousands
  of loyal workers and their pensions.” Thames Water faced fury recently over
  plans to pay senior staff members millions in bonuses from a controversial
  £3bn loan granted by the class A creditors. The company has been banned from
  paying performance-related bonuses to its chief executive and chief financial
  officer because of its poor performance. A government spokesperson said: “The
  government will always act in the national interest on these issues. “The
  company remains financially stable, but we have stepped up our preparations
  and stand ready for all eventualities, including applying for a special
  administration regime if that were to become necessary.” FTI Consulting
  declined to comment.
