  Delegates at the UN plastic pollution treaty talks in Geneva must secure an
  ambitious global agreement so they can look future generations in the eye, one
  of the world’s leading marine litter experts has said. Prof Richard Thompson,
  who was named one of Time’s 100 most influential people this year for his
  groundbreaking work on plastic pollution, said decisive action was needed to
  protect human health and the planet. He spoke as delegates from more than 170
  countries prepared to meet in Geneva to bridge what have become deep divisions
  over whether limits on plastic production are included in a final treaty. Last
  November, talks in Busan, South Korea, to secure a global treaty to end
  plastic pollution broke down without agreement. More than 100 countries
  support legally binding global reductions in plastic production and the
  phasing out of certain chemicals and single-use plastic products. But nations
  with large fossil fuel industries such as Saudi Arabia, China, Russia and Iran
  oppose restrictions on plastic production, and are pushing for an agreement
  focused on better management and recycling of waste. The US under President
  Biden and now President Trump has indicated it is more supportive of a lower
  ambition treaty which does not include production cuts. The scale of plastic
  production and its threat to public health and the environment was underlined
  once more on Monday when a new report warned that the world is in a “plastics
  crisis” which is causing disease and death from infancy to old age and is
  responsible for at least $1.5tn (£1.1tn) a year in health-related damages. The
  huge acceleration of plastic production, which has increased by more than 200
  times since 1950 and is expected to almost triple again to more than a billion
  tonnes a year by 2060, has been fuelled largely by surges in the production of
  single-use plastics, the majority of which are used for packaging, drink and
  food containers. Thompson, head of the international marine litter research
  unit at Plymouth University, first identified and coined the phrase
  microplastics to describe how tiny bits of plastic accumulate in marine
  environments. Attending the Geneva talks as coordinator of the scientists
  coalition for an effective plastics treaty, he said an ambitious treaty would
  be a gamechanger for the planet and future generations. “It is now clear that
  plastic pollution contaminates our planet from the poles to the equator,” he
  said. “We find microplastics in our deepest oceans and our highest mountains.
  There is evidence of human exposure to them from the womb, throughout our
  entire lifetime. “It is really clear to protect future generations we need to
  take decisive action now on a treaty to address plastic pollution. So I really
  hope negotiators can look the next generation in the eye and say they acted
  decisively.” If agreed, a global plastics treaty would be an international,
  legally binding agreement designed to end plastic pollution by setting targets
  that nations would need to meet to try to end the 11m tonnes of plastic
  pollution that are dumped in the ocean every year. But since 2022, when the UN
  first secured an agreement from 173 countries to develop a legally binding
  treaty to cut plastic pollution, five separate negotiations have failed to
  secure a final text to sign. The initial agreement was for a treaty to address
  the whole life cycle of plastics. But increasing numbers of plastics industry
  lobbyists have attended each round of talks to push back against production
  cuts. In Busan last year, 220 fossil fuel and chemical industry
  representatives – more plastic producers than ever – were represented,
  including 16 lobbyists from the plastics industry attending as part of country
  delegations. “There are those countries that consider the economic threat
  because their business-as-usual is threatened by this,” said Thompson. “But
  the mandate that brings negotiators from 170 countries to Geneva this week
  sets out that plastic pollution is harmful. It is really clear that
  business-as-usual is not sustainable.” Globally only 9% of plastic produced is
  recycled, and Thompson, whose work directly led to the ban on microbeads in
  cosmetic products in the UK, said the evidence showed that plastic production
  needed to be reduced to tackle plastic pollution. He said a treaty needed to
  ensure only plastic that was essential to society was produced, the thousands
  of chemicals used in plastic were reduced, and that all the plastic produced
  in future was sustainable, which involved moving to reuse and a circular
  economy in plastic. All of that, he said, would effectively reduce the amount
  of plastic produced globally. Graham Forbes, Greenpeace’s head of delegation
  to the treaty negotiations, said the science, the moral imperative and the
  economics were clear. “Uncontrolled plastic production is a death sentence.
  The only way to end plastic pollution is to stop making so much plastic.
  “World leaders must seize the opportunity in Geneva, stand up to the fossil
  fuel industry and take humanity’s first step towards ending the plastics
  crisis and create a healthier, safer future for all.” • The Guardian’s climate
