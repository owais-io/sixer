  Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Tuesday after his Washington meeting with Donald
  Trump and European leaders that security guarantees for Ukraine will likely be
  worked out within 10 days. He added that it would include the purchase for
  Ukraine of a package of US weapons. “There indeed is a package with our
  proposals worth $90bn,” Zelenskyy said. “And we have agreements with the US
  president that when our export opens, they will buy Ukrainian drones. This is
  important for us.” Reports earlier suggested that Ukraine would promise to buy
  $100bn of US weapons financed by Europe – lucrative for US suppliers – as part
  of a deal to get guarantees from the US for its security if there is a peace
  settlement with Russia, according to reports. The Financial Times added that
  Ukraine and the US would also strike a $50bn deal to produce drones with
  Ukrainian companies. The drone news may partly repeat recent similar
  announcements. Donald Trump said after talks with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and
  European leaders on Monday that the US would oversee European security
  guarantees for Ukraine. “During the meeting we discussed security guarantees
  for Ukraine, which guarantees would be provided by the various European
  countries, with a coordination with the United States of America,” the US
  president posted. Trump said he had begun to arrange an initial bilateral
  meeting between Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, and the Russian ruler,
  Vladimir Putin; to be followed by a trilateral meeting involving Trump as
  well. Friedrich Merz – the German chancellor and part of Zelenskyy’s European
  “bodyguard” detail in Washington – said Trump in a call with Putin had “agreed
  that there will be a meeting between the Russian president and the Ukrainian
  president within the next two weeks” with the venue still to be agreed upon.
  Russia’s initial response to the idea of direct Putin-Zelenskyy talks was
  elliptical. Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov told the Tass news agency that Putin
  told Trump he was open to the “idea” of it. “The idea was discussed that it
  would be necessary to study the possibility of raising the level of
  representatives of the Ukrainian and Russian sides.” Zelenskyy told Ukrainian
  media outside the White House: “I confirmed – and all European leaders
  supported me – that we are ready for a bilateral meeting with Putin.” Putin
  has at all stages appeared deeply reluctant to face Zelenskyy personally;
  whereas Zelenskyy has been saying since Trump took office that he is ready for
  such a meeting. Merz said Trump “noticed that we Europeans are speaking with
  one voice”. The Europeans and Americans would need to discuss who participates
  in the security guarantees and to what extent. “It’s completely clear that the
  whole of Europe should participate,” Merz said. “This is not just about the
  territory of Ukraine. It’s about the political order of Europe.” Merz said
  Ukraine must not be forced to surrender its Donbas region to Russia, which
  “corresponds, to put it bluntly, to a proposal for the United States to have
  to give up Florida”. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said: “President
  Trump believes we can get an agreement and believes that President Putin also
  wants a peace accord. But if at the end this process is met by refusal, we are
  also ready to say that we need to increase sanctions [on Russia].” Russian
  attacks on major Ukrainian cities killed at least 10 people as Zelenskyy and
  the European leaders prepared to meet Trump. An entire family including a
  toddler and her 16-year-old brother were among the seven killed when drones
  hit a residential neighbourhood of Kharkiv. Another 23 people were wounded,
  authorities said. Three people were killed in a ballistic missile strike on
  the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia, with more wounded. In the Odesa region
  of Ukraine’s south, a drone strike damaged an oil depot belonging to
  Azerbaijan’s state-owned Socar for the second time in two weeks, Ukraine’s
  foreign minister said. In that vein, Ukraine also struck back, hitting an oil
  pumping station in Russia’s Tambov region that is part of Moscow’s war effort
  in Ukraine. It led to the suspension of supplies via the Druzhba pipeline,
  which feeds oil into Slovakia and Hungary, both of whose prime ministers are
  friendly to Vladimir Putin. Polish prosecutors have charged a Belarusian
  citizen with planning to set fire to a warehouse in eastern Poland on behalf
  of foreign intelligence, a spokesperson said on Monday. The statement did not
  name the foreign power. Poland says its role as an aid hub for neighbouring
  Ukraine has made it a target for Russian and Belarusian secret services.
  Prosecutors suspected the 27-year-old man, Vitalij S, “collected data about a
  warehouse facility in the Lublin Voivodeship in July 2025, filmed and
  photographed it, and then passed this material on to representatives of
  foreign intelligence”, a spokesperson said.
