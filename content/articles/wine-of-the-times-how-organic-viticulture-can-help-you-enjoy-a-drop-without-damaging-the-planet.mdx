  A good bottle of wine can bring joy and flavour to any meal or occasion –
  however, viticulture stands alongside agriculture as one of the great
  contributors to global problems like soil fertility loss, water contamination
  and wildlife habitat loss. Choosing to drink organic wine can push back
  against some of the more harmful effects of conventional winegrowing. Here’s a
  handy guide for understanding organic wine and what to look for when buying
  your next drop. What is organic wine? Organic wine is, first and foremost,
  made from organically farmed grapes. There are distinctions between “organic
  wine” and “wine made with organic grapes,” but at the heart of the matter is
  non-chemical farming. Organic farmers manage insects, weeds, and disease
  through methods that are labor-intensive but less environmentally destructive.
  Soil and plant life is prioritised over commercialism. Not only do these
  organic approaches hold environmental benefits, but in general, organic
  viticulture is considered key for healthy grapes and great wine. How is it
  better for the environment? Organic vineyards not only avoid many of the
  environmental problems caused by viticulture, but form part of the effort to
  reverse those problems. This also applies to “regenerative” and “biodynamic”
  winegrowing, two distinct but related approaches which have organic farming as
  their basis. Like most commercial crops, grapevines are susceptible to disease
  and insect infestation. To deal with these threats, conventional viticulture
  relies on pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides. Organic viticulture permits
  the usage of two primary treatments: copper and sulfur, which are applied
  primarily for anti-fungal benefits. Some viticulturalists, including in the
  biodynamic movement, opt to treat vines with plant-based sprays such as nettle
  or yarrow, with the goal being overall vine health and resilience. Organic
  farmers embrace two methods of weed management that have the added bonus of
  carbon sequestration and soil improvement: cover crop planting between vine
  rows, and no or reduced-tillage. Instead of managing weeds through herbicide,
  organic growers sow cover crops such as peas, lupins, or clover between vine
  rows. These fix nitrogen in the soil, enhancing exposure to light and
  providing nutrients for microbes within, and they also generate more “organic
  matter” within the soil. “Organic matter” refers to humus in soil—the
  nutrient-rich stuff that makes soil fertile. Cover crops can break down and
  become organic matter, enhancing soil. Tilling the soil is a known way to
  release carbon into the atmosphere. Organic farming avoids this by building
  soil up through cover crops, compost, mulch, and other forms of organic
  matter, preserving carbon instead of releasing it. How does it affect the
  taste? South Australian winegrower Frewen Ries, who co-owns CRFT Wines in the
  Adelaide Hills, converted his vineyard to organic after buying it from
  conventional farmers in 2013. “When we took over, the soil under the vines was
  devoid of grass,” he says. “It had been sprayed with herbicide. You could
  knock on it and it was rock-hard. It was essentially hydrophobic, it didn’t
  soak up any water.” Ries and his partner decided to let grass grow under the
  vines and to not till the soil. Over time, they saw a build-up of topsoil and
  the wines developed more complexity. “We’ve done vertical tastings recently of
  our pinot noir to when we first produced it off the block in 2013, and we
  found a dramatic increase in colour and depth,” says Ries. Creating a
  stronger, more resilient crop While some insects can damage vines in the short
  term, organic farming prioritises a diverse ecosystem over crop
  capitalisation. A flourishing ecosystem leads to what’s known as “dynamic
  equilibrium” and “biological control”– a situation where plants and microbial
  life balance each other out when competing for resources, and “living things
  control an outbreak of a pest,” according to an organic farming manual
  provided by the recently closed but influential National Association for
  Sustainable Agriculture Australia (NASAA). When plants, microbes, insects and
  animals are in harmony, there is less need for intervention and the crop will
  be overall stronger and more resilient. What should I look for when buying?
  Look for the “organic wine” or “natural wine” section at bottleshops, or ask
  them if they have one. Head to any self-described “natural wine” shop, where
  some bottles may not be from certified organic vineyards, but in general
  producers represented will be farming organically or regeneratively, while
  also bottling their wine with low levels of sulfur dioxide (a preservative)
  and minimal or no filtration. Look for certifications – in Australia, there
  are currently four approved certifying bodies; certified organic European
  Union wines (and foods) display a green leaf icon. Wine is a luxury that we
  are lucky to enjoy. If we can put our money behind responsibly farmed
  vineyards, we’re steering the wine market toward better practices and creating
  a significant cumulative difference in the world. • This article was amended
  on 4 August 2025 to reflect the fact that the National Association for
  Sustainable Agriculture Australia certification is no longer valid.
