  Noah Lyles laid down a hefty marker for next month’s World Athletics
  Championships by winning a thrilling 200m rematch against Letsile Tebogo of
  Botswana in the Diamond League final in Zurich. Tebogo sprung a major surprise
  at last year’s Olympics by beating Lyles, who it later turned out had Covid.
  It looked as if a repeat was on the cards as Tebogo led from the gun but in
  the final strides the American finally got his vest in front to take victory –
  and the $30,000 (£22,000) prize – in 19.74sec, with Tebogo 0.02 back in
  second. It was a much-needed confidence booster for Lyles after two recent
  defeats in the 100m, as he took his sixth Diamond League final win. “Six in a
  row, the most in track!” said Lyles. “It is pretty nice to have that. I saw
  Letsile lean on the finish line but I knew I won. I knew if I panicked I was
  not going to win. If you are tight you are done for.” Elsewhere it was a good
  night for British athletes as Max Burgin nearly took down the men’s Olympic
  800m champion and Georgia Hunter Bell ran a personal best in the women’s 800m.
  Burgin has long been compared to Sebastian Coe, but a series of injuries has
  left the 23-year-old unable to fulfil his potential. But he will gain immense
  confidence slugging it out with Emmanuel Wanyonyi before finishing in 1min
  42.42sec, his second quickest time. “Today was a bit of a world championships
  field, like a test,” said Burgin, who was just 0.05 behind Wanyonyi in second.
  “I am dreaming of being at the exact same position at the worlds.” Hunter Bell
  was just as impressive as she weaved her way from fifth to second in the final
  200m to finish in 1:55.96 – a career-best time by half a second and the third
  fastest time in British history, behind her training partner Keely Hodgkinson
  and Jemma Reekie. However the Briton, who has opted to run the 800m rather
  than the 1500m in Tokyo, was unable to get past the young Swiss star Audrey
  Werro, who delighted the home fans to win in 1:55.91. Sebastian Coe has said
  World Athletics’ decision to introduce mandatory female sex-verification
  testing last month has now been “overwhelmingly” backed by athletes. The World
  Athletics president acknowledged that there had been challenges with getting
  everyone tested in time for the world championships in Tokyo in September, but
  revealed that over 90% of competitors had now undergone the cheek-swab SRY
  gene test. “First of all, the athletes are overwhelmingly supportive of this,
  and have been very, very helpful in all this,” he said. “And the member
  federations have also been very, very supportive. “The objective is to make
  sure that by the time we have the championships the athletes will have all
  been tested. The time frame was tight. And it wasn’t without its challenges.
  But there will be athletes that will be tested, even in their holding camps in
  Tokyo. We’re hitting slightly more than 90% now.” The SRY gene reveals the
  presence of the Y chromosome, which is the indicator of biological sex. The
  test was also approved by World Boxing when it introduced mandatory sex
  testing for all boxers. Coe acknowledged that some competitors had struggled
  to get tested, with the broadcaster CBC in Canada quoting an unnamed athlete
  saying they had to drive five hours to get a test. But he said that such cases
  were unusual, and those who hadn’t yet been tested would have the cheek-swab
  test when they arrived in Japan. “By and large the process has gone pretty
  smoothly, but it’s not been without its challenges,” he said. “France has its
  own national laws around it, so many of their athletes have been tested
  outside of the country. And those that haven’t been yet will be tested in
  their holding camps in Japan. But the vast majority have been pretty
  straightforward.”
