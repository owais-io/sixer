  First came bad light, then a burst of rain, and with it the penultimate day of
  this epic Test series ended with the ultimate cliffhanger overnight. England
  had seemingly been cruising to their target of 374 and a 3‑1 series victory,
  driven by sparkling centuries from Harry Brook and Joe Root. But India roared
  back after tea to leave the hosts six wickets down, still 35 runs short, when
  the players and umpires walked off to a chorus of jeers. So despite looking
  like a memorable fourth day would bring finality to the contest, the deciding
  fifth Test now heads into a fifth day with everything still on the line.
  England will resume in the morning hoping that Jamie Smith, last of the top
  seven, guides them home after a night’s rest and Chris Woakes, his dislocated
  left shoulder still in a sling, is not required to bat. India can still level
  the series at 2-2 – a share of the Anderson‑Tendulkar Trophy – and, having
  floundered slightly during a 195-run fifth‑wicket stand between Brook and
  Root, they had perhaps cause to feel most aggrieved when proceedings were
  paused at 5.30pm. The force was very much with the tourists at this stage;
  England were scrapping for their lives. Brook’s thrilling 10th Test century
  had been terminated on 111 from 98 balls before tea – bat flying out of his
  hand when top-edging Akash Deep into the ring – while Jacob Bethell lost his
  middle stump for five trying to break free from the shackles. But it was
  Root’s removal for 105 to an edge off Prasidh Krishna that truly set alarm
  bells ringing among the home support. It had been coming, in fairness, with
  the old ball belatedly starting to move for India’s quicks and forcing a
  succession of lbw appeals. From 337 for six, Smith and Jamie Overton continued
  the theme, playing out 20 balls of paralysis in which they either beat the bat
  or squirted off the inside edge. Just two singles were added and both were
  cheered like boundaries. Most galling of all was that 30 minutes after play
  was called off at 6pm, the Oval was drenched in sunshine and the last
  remaining spectators were shouting words like “disgrace”. If nothing else, the
  overnight pause handed Smith and the tail time to reset, even if this also
  meant they would be facing a refreshed Indian attack with the second new ball
  just 3.4 overs away. While the verbals that have been traded regularly during
  this series died down after a chirpy start, the battle out in the middle was
  no less intense, and not least during India’s late surge. Krishna and Mohammed
  Siraj whipped up the Tamasha, with the latter somehow still hitting 87mph on
  the speed gun in his fifth successive Test. What a cricketer. Up to that point
  it had chiefly been about the audacity of Brook, plus the 39th entry into
  Root’s catalogue of Test centuries. Hitting 14 fours and two sixes overall –
  one of which we will get to – Brook initially burst out of the traps. But he
  then smartly started to roll his wrists on his pull shots when Shubman Gill
  spread the field to all corners. Control, precision and typical brute strength
  placed this 91-ball century among his very best. Root, by contrast, was
  scratchy at first and fortunate to survive a tight lbw shout from Krishna on
  three in which he was saved by umpire’s call. Soon enough, though, he was in
  his groove, smiling at his opponents after some rare snarl on day two and
  caressing 12 gorgeous fours. Since Bazball began in 2022, the 34‑year‑old
  averages a remarkable 82 in the fourth innings. There was little doubt as to
  the moment that changed the day though; a moment that Siraj, much like Trent
  Boult after the 2019 World Cup final, will replay in his mind over and again
  should India go on to lose. In a sport that has disappointment baked into it,
  holding a catch in the deep but carrying the ball over the boundary for six
  must rank among the worst feelings. Brook was on 19 at the time, England 137
  for three, when he hooked Krishna from outside off and sent a high catch to
  long leg. Siraj snaffled it but planted his heel on the rope simultaneously,
  before stumbling over completely in full knowledge of the error. A number of
  India’s players were already celebrating, only to spot Siraj with his head in
  his hands. India had enjoyed a positive start to the day too, even if there
  were signs of the pitch having lost some of its seam movement. The dangerous
  Ben Duckett had edged a smart full ball from Krishna behind on 54, while Ollie
  Pope fell lbw for 27 to a ball that nipped back from Siraj. It completed what
  has become his standard one century, 30-something average series for Pope.
  Brook’s reprieve changed the mood of a morning in which England reached lunch
  on 164 for three, before he and Root then dominated the afternoon. Expect the
  fired up and indefatigable Siraj to come charging in on Monday morning,
  desperate to ensure his footfault becomes a mere footnote.
