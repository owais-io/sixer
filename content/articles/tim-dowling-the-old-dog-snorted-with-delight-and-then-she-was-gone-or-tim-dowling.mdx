  In the days before my father-in-law’s funeral, my wife and I drive to his
  cottage in the country with the dogs. Our schedule – shredded and hastily
  reassembled around events – has a window just big enough to go down there,
  check on things, do the front hedge, weed a bit. It seems important, even if
  it probably isn’t. Shortly after we arrive a visitor remarks on the decline of
  the old dog. “Really?” my wife says. “I guess we don’t notice.” Since we were
  last here the old dog – now nearly 16 – has certainly become more wobbly, more
  incontinent and more prone to falling asleep suddenly, in strange places. But
  her decline hasn’t been steady. She’s also prone to brief episodes where she
  leaps and capers like a young dog, episodes that are themselves a little
  alarming. “Is she having fun?” I say, as the dog runs in circles round our
  feet. “Does this look like fun?” Anyway, she likes it down here. She’s been
  coming since she was a puppy, and she knows her way round. It is possibly more
  familiar to her than our house, which we’ve only lived in for eight years. The
  stone floor is remarkably resilient when it comes to chronic incontinence. And
  the weather is amazing. In the morning my wife goes out to pick up a few
  things. I sit at the table in front of my laptop, trying to make a start on a
  eulogy. The new dog is on the sofa. The old dog is asleep on the floor
  alongside its bed, as if she tipped over on the way to it, and decided that
  close was close enough. It occurs to me that this time last year I was at work
  on my own father’s eulogy. This affirms my superstition that death has a
  season, and that season, for me, is summer. My mother died in June; I remember
  the sound of lawnmowers when I called my wife to tell her. Later that day,
  under a warm afternoon sun, I am trying to extract bindweed from a raised bed.
  It’s a pleasingly thankless task, requiring little thought and carrying no
  risk of completion. My wife is pegging out some laundry by the back door. A
  few feet away from her, the old dog is having one of her rare episodes of
  sprightliness, tearing through the tall grass in excited figures of eight, and
  snorting with delight. My wife turns her back for a few minutes, and when she
  turns around, the old dog is gone. She comes and finds me to ask if I’ve seen
  her. I haven’t. The old dog doesn’t wander as a rule, and is most likely
  inside, fast asleep in some new and unlikely spot. Except she isn’t. Once
  we’ve checked all the obvious places, we decide to split up. We search in
  silence, because you can’t call a deaf dog. I take the track leading away from
  the house, secretly because I figure it’s the path most likely to lead toward
  a positive outcome. If the dog has headed this way, I’m sure to find her safe.
  But I get quite a long way up the track without finding anything at all. From
  up there I can just hear my wife’s voice calling my name. As faint as it is, I
  can tell she has bad news. In the end the new dog found the old dog, burrowing
  deep into brambles and weeds towards the bed of a trickling, nearly dry
  stream, where she lay dead. She was not 30ft from where my wife last saw her.
  We looked, it turns out, in all the wrong places. “Oh dear,” my wife says,
  kneeling on the grass. “I feel so guilty.” “Me too,” I say. My wife rings our
  sons to break the news, and they take it hard. When the old dog was the new
  dog, the youngest one was only 10 years old. He was given the honour of
  picking a name. He took my advice, and called her Nellie. Later I text them
  all to tell them to check on the tortoise, because as far as I’m concerned
  death’s season still has some way to run. In the following days more than one
  person will offer up the hopeful notion that animals sometimes take themselves
  off to die. I’m not sure how likely I find this, or how comforting. Other
  friends suggest that it’s better all round for a dog to expire somewhere it’s
  been happy, in full pursuit of being a dog, rather than on the cold floor of a
  veterinarian’s office. I’ve sat on the floor holding a dog, tears running off
  my nose into its fur, while a vet administered that final injection. And now
  I’ve fought through brambles to pull a dead dog out of a stream. And
  personally, I would struggle to register a preference.
