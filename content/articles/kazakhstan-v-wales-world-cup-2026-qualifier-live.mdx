  Not long now: Both sets of players line up in the tunnel and are led out on to
  the pitch by Spanish referee Alejandro Hernandez and his team of match
  officials. It’s coming up to 7pm local time in Astana and kick-off is just a
  few minutes away. Craig Bellamy: “No matter what, it’s going to be a difficult
  game,” said the Wales manager ahead of today’s qualifier. “Playing
  [Kazakhstan] at home in Cardiff was a good challenge as well, how they set up,
  how they look to counter-attack. They spent a long time without the ball and
  that usually breaks teams earlier than it did. We call it heart. I admired it.
  For us, do we have the quality on the day? That’s the most important. Have we
  prepared well? Are we able to adapt? We’ll have to take the game to them.” The
  Red Wall: Wales are expected to bring around a thousand supporters to Astana
  today but the odyssey undertaken by one bucket hat-wearing fan to get to his
  seat in the away end has really captured the public imagination. John
  McAllister left his home in Barry over five weeks ago and on a largely
  overland journey of 5,000 kilometres involving 17 train journeys and 11 bus
  trips, has taken in 11 different football matches, an ice hockey game, some
  random Irish bloke’s stag do and a heavy metal festival en route while
  compiling a fascinating YouTube travel vlog. The 26-year-old’s exploits have
  been brought to the attention of Craig Bellamy, who along with his players
  hopes to meet and greet the intrepid explorer if a get-together hasn’t already
  been arranged. “We’ve got to see him, because it means so much to us,” the
  Wales manager said. Today’s match officials Referee: Alejandro Hernandez
  Referee’s assistants: Jose Naranjo and Diego Sanchez Fourth official: Joe Luis
  Nunuera Video assistant referee: Cesar Soto Grado Wales team news: A tip of
  the garish bucket hat to Kieffer Moore and Chris Mepham, who both notch up
  their half-century of Wales caps today. Just beginning his international
  journey, Cardiff City’s 19-year-old defender Dylan Lawlor makes his first
  appearance for his country. Well done, Dylan. Moore, Lawlor, Neco William,
  Liam Cullen and Josh Sheehan come into a side that features five changes from
  the XI who lined up for Wales narrow defeat at the hands of Belgium last time
  out. World Cup tickets: Should Wales or Kazakhstan qualify for next summer’s
  tournament being staged in the USA, Canada and Mexico, their fans can expect
  to pay top, top, top, top dollar for match tickets now that Fifa has decided
  to channel its inner Oasis and introduce a new dynamic pricing model. Leander
  Schaerlaeckens has the latest … Kazakhstan: Anarbekov, Kasym, Maliy, Alip,
  Kairov, Orazov, Kasabulat, Vorogovskiy, Satpaev, Kenzhebek, Samorodov. Subs:
  Shayzada, Seisen, Zhaksybaev, Muzhikov, Chesnokov, Karaman, Zhagorov,
  Sviridov, Zhumat, Sultanbek Astanov, Omirtayev, Khalmatov. Wales: Darlow,
  Mepham, Ben Davies, Lawlor, Thomas, Cullen, Sheehan, Wilson, Williams,
  Johnson, Moore. Subs: Adam Davies, Cabango, Brooks, Koumas, Kpakio, Crew,
  Jordan James, Harris, Daniel James, King, Norrington-Davies, Colwill. Early
  Kazakhstan team news Since losing to Wales in Cardiff Kazakhstan have lost
  Askhat Tagybergen, their goalscorer and captain on the night, to international
  retirement. The veteran stood down following his side’s defeat at the hands of
  North Macedonia citing his wish to make way for new blood in the national
  side. Arguably Kazakhstan’s brightest prospect, the 17-year-old Dastan Satpaev
  made his senior international debut in that game against Wales and the Astana
  striker will join Chelsea once he turns 18. His Kairat Almaty teammate,
  Alexander Zarutskyi, misses out through injury today after being forced off
  during the first leg of his team’s Champions League playoff first leg against
  Celtic and is likely to be replaced by Astana’s Mukhammedzhan Seysen. Early
  Wales team news Wales go into this game suffering from a litany of injuries,
  with the loss of Leeds duo Ethan Ampadu and Joe Rodon arguably the ones that
  will hurt the most. Wrexham goalkeeper Danny Ward and his teammate Nathan
  Broadhead have also been ruled out, while Jay Dasilva and Connor Roberts are
  also numbered among the Cymru lame and halt. Currently playing his club
  football in Mexico with Pumas UNAM, Aaron Ramsey has been omitted from the
  squad due to lack of match fitness following his return to action from a
  hamstring injury. Bellamy insists the 34-year-old midfielder features in his
  future plans but the pair agreed Ramsey would miss this game and Wales’
  friendly against Canada on Tuesday because he has only played once since
  March. In the absence of so many experienced players, Cardiff City duo Dylan
  Lawlor and Ronan Kpakio have earned their first international call-ups,
  although there is no place in the squad for their fellow Bluebird, Ruben
  Colwill despite the 23-year-old midfielder’s impressive start to the season.
  Bellamy explained he was “very close” to being selected but added that he
  wants to “see more” from him. Colwill’s younger brother and Cardiff teammate,
  Joel, did make the cut and is included in a Wales squad for the first time. A
  lengthy hop from Cardiff, the Astana Arena is the venue for today’s match
  between Kazakhstan and a Wales side who have never travelled further for a
  World Cup qualifier. While many Uefa groups are only getting started in the
  current international window, Group J is already well under way and Wales
  currently sit second behind leaders North Macedonia, who have one point more
  than Craig Bellamy’s side after four games each. Belgium currently occupy
  third spot but will overtake both the teams ahead of them if they win their
  two games in hand. The upshot is that today’s match is veering perilously
  close to must-win territory for the Welsh and is unquestionably of the
  must-not-lose variety. Despite travelling around 3,500 kilometres to fulfill
  this fixture on an artificial pitch that isn’t entirely to their manager’s
  liking, the visitors will be hopeful of repeating their victory over the
  Kazakhs in Cardiff back in March. A more emphatic and less nervy win would be
  welcome. Kick off in the Kazakh capital is at 3pm (BST) but stay tuned in the
  meantime for team news and build-up.
