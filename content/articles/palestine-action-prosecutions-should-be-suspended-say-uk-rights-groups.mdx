  Protesters arrested for supporting Palestine Action should not be prosecuted
  until a legal challenge to a ban on the group has been heard, organisations
  including Greenpeace and Human Rights Watch have told the attorney general for
  England and Wales. In a letter to Richard Hermer KC, also signed by Friends of
  the Earth, Global Witness and the Quakers, they say proceeding with charges or
  trials before the judicial review, which is expected to be heard in November,
  would raise significant legal and moral questions. Last weekend 522 people –
  half of whom were over 60 – were arrested under section 13 of the Terrorism
  Act at a demonstration in Parliament Square for carrying placards that stated:
  “I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action.” The detentions took the total
  number of people arrested under the act in relation to the banned group since
  it was proscribed last month to more than 700. The letter says the attorney
  general, rather than the Crown Prosecution Service, makes the decision on how
  cases should proceed under the Terrorism Act, and urges him to act “in the
  public interest”. Areeba Hamid, a co-executive director of Greenpeace UK,
  said: “Hundreds of people are facing potential prison sentences for sitting
  quietly holding placards. It isn’t difficult to see why this could be a
  disproportionate restriction on people’s freedom of expression, and why so
  many legal experts have expressed their concern at the government’s decision
  to extend their definition of terrorism in this way. “We urge the attorney
  general to approach the matter with care and some caution, and not prejudge
  the outcome of a judicial review which could fundamentally change the legal
  position of these protesters.” One of the reasons Mr Justice Chamberlain gave
  for granting permission at the high court for a judicial review of the
  proscription was that those charged with criminal offences under the act might
  seek to challenge the legality of the proscription order individually when
  tried. Criminal courts might reach different decisions, creating “a recipe for
  chaos”, he said. Most of those arrested have been bailed but at least 10 have
  been charged. The five organisations say no one else should be charged, and
  those who already have been should not be prosecuted before the judicial
  review, which could lead to the ban being quashed. “Prosecuting individuals
  for offences connected to that proscription before the court has determined
  its legality raises significant legal and moral questions,” the letter states.
  “In particular, one of the grounds which the judge held had merit was that the
  proscription of Palestine Action was a disproportionate interference with
  human rights. “We therefore respectfully request that you exercise your
  constitutional role in the public interest by delaying any decisions to
  prosecute individuals arrested under terrorism legislation in connection with
  Palestine Action until the conclusion of the judicial review process.”
  Separately, the Liberal Democrats have written to the government’s independent
  reviewer of terrorism legislation, asking that he urgently examine the
  “troubling precedent” of using the Terrorism Act to arrest large numbers of
  people expressing support for Palestine Action. In a letter to Jonathan Hall
  KC, Lisa Smart, the party’s home affairs spokesperson, said: “While we
  recognise the serious nature of this group’s activities, including criminal
  offences, such as vandalism of military equipment and RAF aircraft, aggravated
  burglary and violent disorder, and some cases awaiting the conclusion of
  trials, we are deeply concerned about the use of terrorism powers against
  peaceful protesters in this context.” The attorney general’s office has been
  approached for comment. On Friday, it emerged that a woman awaiting trial for
  an alleged Palestine Action break-in at an Israeli arms factory has been on
  hunger strike since Monday. Teuta Hoxha, 29, says that since the direct action
  group was proscribed last month, prison officers have blocked her post and
  restricted her activities. Hoxha, who was arrested in November last year but
  is not due to stand trial until April 2026, has made demands including for her
  job at the prison library to be reinstated, to be allowed recreational
  activities and to receive her post. Hoxha is charged with criminal damage,
  aggravated burglary and violent disorder in relation to an action at Elbit
  Systems in Filton, near Bristol, last year. Also on Friday, to mark a year
  since the first Filton suspects were imprisoned awaiting trial, a network
  called Prisoners for Palestine was launched for inmates being held on charges
  relating to pro-Palestinian activism.
