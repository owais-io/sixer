  Gary Lineker is to host a new gameshow on ITV, under a deal that will bring
  him back to screens after his departure from the BBC, according to reports.
  The former Match of the Day presenter and former England football captain, who
  was the highest-paid on-air star at the BBC, parted ways with the broadcaster
  in May, days after apologising for amplifying online material with antisemitic
  connotations. Filming has yet to begin on the new show, which is called The
  Box and involves different celebrities being put into boxes and given
  challenges, according to the Sun. The show would be expected to be given a
  prominent Saturday night slot and play a similar flagship role to ITV’s
  popular Ant &amp; Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway. A spokesperson for ITV
  declined to comment on the report when approached by the Guardian. A source
  told the Sun: “The Box is massive in Norway, and the rights were quickly sold
  to Denmark and now the UK. ITV are really excited about it and believe they
  have finally found a worthy successor to Saturday Night Takeaway. “They have
  long been sniffing around Gary and just needed to find the right format for
  him. They’re confident they’ve found that now, and the BBC’s loss is their
  gain.” Excitement about The Box has been building around Europe as networks
  search for a successor to shows such as Traitors and Destination X. Over the
  course of 10 episodes, 12 celebrity contestants are placed in separate boxes.
  When the box in which they have been placed opens, they find themselves in the
  midst of a challenge. Lineker bade farewell at the end of May to Match of the
  Day and his 30-year relationship with the BBC amid pressure over his comments
  on social media. A decision had been made last autumn that Lineker would begin
  to step away from his BBC responsibilities, with expectations that he would
  present the 2026 World Cup However, his reposting of content relating to the
  Gaza conflict that contained an antisemitic symbol put an end to those plans
  for an extended farewell. The 64-year-old apologised after it emerged he had
  reposted a pro-Palestine video on Instagram that criticised Zionism and
  included an illustration of a rat. There had long been criticism of Lineker,
  particularly from rightwing figures, over his social media output. He has 1.2
  million followers on Instagram. In March 2023, he was temporarily suspended
  over comments he made criticising the Conservative government’s asylum policy.
  In February, he was among 500 high-profile cultural figures who called on the
  BBC to rebroadcast a documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone, calling it
  an “essential piece of journalism”. The BBC removed the documentary from its
  iPlayer after it emerged that the film’s 14-year-old narrator was the son of a
  deputy agriculture minister in Gaza’s Hamas-run government. Lineker said in
  July that BBC should “hold its head in shame” over its failure to show a
  documentary about the plight of medics in Gaza. In his first criticism of his
  former employer since leaving the BBC, he said people at “the very top of the
  BBC” had been failing over the conflict, after the corporation’s decision to
  drop Gaza: Doctors Under Attack.
