  Anne Soltow’s glider was leading the field all day. Now it is in an actual
  field and a kilometre short of the finish. The single-seater sailplane looks
  like a giant alien bug: long slender fuselage, a canopy encasing the cockpit
  like a single eye, epic wings, 15 metres tip to tip. They were all that was
  keeping Soltow’s engineless aircraft in the sky – until 10 minutes ago. The
  pilot is furious with herself. She had been in the air for nearly four hours
  and in first place before running out of altitude on the final run back to the
  airfield. “Landing out” is common in gliding, where testing courses are spread
  across hundreds of kilometres (think orienteering in the sky). You stay
  airborne by climbing naturally occurring, upward-spiralling cylinders of warm
  air known as thermals. Fail to find these and the ground comes to meet you a
  lot earlier than you would like. The farmer’s field in which Soltow is
  standing is in the Czech Republic, host to the Women’s World Gliding
  Championships. The 27-year-old discovered the sport in 2019 when she moved
  from Germany to London to study aeronautical engineering. A day win here
  would, she says, have helped her to finally feel she belonged on the British
  team. Instead she is so disappointed she can not bring herself to join her
  teammates for dinner. With one day of the competition left, the Czechs look
  set for a clean sweep in all three classes. Seventeen countries are competing,
  although some – such as Ukraine and the US – can muster a single pilot.
  Comparatively few women race gliders: in June’s open world championships,
  three of 115 athletes were women. A women-only championship has run since 1979
  to serve (and expand) the female talent pool. Gliding can be a tough sport to
  get into for all sorts of reasons, the most obvious being that you need a
  licence to fly solo. It is completely weather-dependent and immensely
  time-consuming, a good flight might keep you in the air for eight hours. Once
  you are competing at an elite level, the quality of your aircraft and
  equipment can make all the difference – a racing glider can cost anything from
  £10,000 to £300,000. So the sense of solidarity at the women’s worlds is
  notable. Most athletes have been camping on the airfield in Zbraslavice for
  the entire three weeks of competition; one evening there is a quirky
  initiation ceremony, where everyone dresses in witches’ costumes and
  first-timers pledge an oath to their gliding “godmother”, then pretend to ride
  around on a broomstick. It is a genuine family event: an athlete’s crew – the
  person who helps to launch the glider and fetch it if need be – is frequently
  often their spouse and more than one woman has mounted the podium here
  accompanied by a dog or a baby. All the pilots have battled wretched
  conditions, with local thunderstorms and smoke from Canadian wildfires. Nine
  flying days – more than half the event – have been scrubbedlost. Even this
  week’s clear blue skies were bad news because a lack of clouds makes thermals
  harder to find. No team has struggled more than Great Britain, who have failed
  to take a podium in any class and are bottom of the team cup rankings. Britain
  have a healthy track record at the women’s world championships – one team
  member, Ayala Truelove, has been overall runner-up twice and took bronze in
  2019. But here they have been shown up by the youthful vigour and vibrant
  spirit of the Czech women and the deep-pocketed professionalism of the French.
  Liz Sparrow, Truelove’s flying partner with an international career spanning
  22 years, has one word for it: “nightmare”. While each individual is competing
  for position, flying as a pair or in a group can help tactical decision-making
  and the hunt for “good air”. One of the GB crew borrows from Star Trek: The
  Next Generation and describes the Czech team as “a collective consciousness,
  like the Borg”. By comparison, Soltow has struggled to pair with any British
  teammates because her borrowed glider, a Standard Cirrus, cannot match theirs
  for performance. Now, near the end of the tournament, she has formed an
  alliance with the American Sylvia Grandstaff, a former test pilot for the US
  Navy, and another, Danish, pilot – a casual agreement to help each other
  around the course. It takes 45 minutes to launch all 50 gliders on the grid
  thanks to the clutch of tug planes operating on a loop, trailing cable like
  fish poop. A large gaggle of sailplanes hovers in a thermal near the starting
  position, but as soon as the task begins, Soltow and her “ragtag group” break
  away and chart their own course. Under a small pop-up awning on the airfield,
  Tim Taylor – Grandstaff’s crew – hunkers over his laptop. He watches their
  progress and suggests strategy over the radio, his communication clear and
  precise. Sometimes they lose signal – teams bring their own equipment and the
  US have a smaller radio mast than most. They lose the Dane, too, at the bottom
  of a bubble of warm air that fades mid-climb. Neither Soltow nor Grandstaff
  want to leave her behind – she has to insist. On the run back home, Grandstaff
  is in second, and Soltow, once again, in first. Following close behind is
  Olena Yakymchuk, from Ukraine, who has been living and training in Germany
  since Russia’s invasion. All Ukrainian gliders have been grounded for the past
  three years and Russian drones have destroyed and targeted many. Under martial
  law, Yakymchuk’s husband, Anton, may only leave their home country to crew for
  her at major competitions: he describes their past three weeks in a caravan as
  “like a honeymoon”. Soltow’s glider slides to a gentle stop on the airfield
  and is quickly towed back to its trailer like a reluctant child. As she begins
  the process of derigging – removing the wings by pulling them out manually,
  just like you might a model aircraft – her fellow competitors walk by and ask
  if she has seen the result. Britain’s last-day win is official – and the
  sisterhood wants to celebrate with her.
