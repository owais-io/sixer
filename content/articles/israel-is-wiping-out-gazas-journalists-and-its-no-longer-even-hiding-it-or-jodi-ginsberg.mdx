  Israel always boasted that it was the only country in the region to support
  press freedom. That boast rang hollow even before the current war. Now, it’s
  not even pretending. On Sunday, Israel openly and brazenly killed six
  journalists as they were sheltering in a tent that housed reporters and media
  workers. Israel accuses one of those journalists – Al Jazeera’s Anas al-Sharif
  – of being a terrorist. It has not said what crime it believes the others have
  committed that would justify killing them. The laws of war are clear:
  journalists are civilians. To target them deliberately in war is to commit a
  war crime. It is hardly surprising that Israel believes it can get away with
  murder. In the two decades preceding 7 October, Israeli forces killed 20
  journalists. No one has ever been held accountable for any of those deaths,
  including that of the Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, whose killing
  in 2022 sent shock waves through the region. Abu Akleh, a dual US-Palestinian
  citizen, was a household name in the Middle East, just as al-Sharif became a
  familiar face for audiences for his coverage of Israel’s assault on Gaza.
  Israel first began making threats against al-Sharif shortly after the start of
  the war. The journalist reported receiving multiple phone calls from officers
  in the Israeli army instructing him to cease coverage and leave northern Gaza,
  as well as voice notes on WhatsApp disclosing his location. In December 2023,
  an Israeli airstrike hit his family home, killing the journalist’s 90-year-old
  father. A year later, the Israeli army alleged publicly that Anas al-Sharif
  was a terrorist – claims it repeated last month shortly after Anas al-Sharif
  exposed the rampant levels of starvation throughout Gaza as a result of
  Israel’s refusal to allow in sufficient food aid. An Israeli spokesperson
  accused al-Sharif of lying about the famine – despite corroboration of
  widespread starvation by independent and international groups. The Committee
  to Protect Journalists had seen this playbook from Israel before: a pattern in
  which journalists are accused by Israel of being terrorists with no credible
  evidence. Indeed, we were so concerned that al-Sharif was being targeted that
  we issued a public statement urging his protection. Instead, al-Sharif was
  killed alongside his colleagues in an attack that Israel has openly admitted
  was aimed at killing the journalist. Al-Sharif is the 184th Palestinian
  journalist to have been killed by Israel since the start of the war and one of
  at least 26 journalists whom CPJ believes to have been deliberately targeted
  for their work as journalists. The others have certainly been killed by Israel
  but whether Israel did so in full knowledge they were journalists we have not
  been able to determine. Israel denies it deliberately targets journalists. But
  the evidence shows otherwise. To date, Israel has provided no independently
  verifiable evidence that any of the journalists whom it has admitted
  deliberately targeting were terrorists. In one case, that of the Al Jazeera
  journalist Ismail al-Ghoul, the documents produced allegedly showed that
  al-Ghoul became the leader of a Hamas battalion – when he was 10 years old.
  The documents Israel has shared on al-Sharif, which it posted on X, show
  al-Sharif as receiving a Hamas salary in 2023. The documents do not provide
  evidence that he was an active member of the terrorist group although Israel
  said it had “current intelligence” – which it did not publish – indicating
  al-Sharif was an active Hamas military wing operative. It is no wonder that
  Israel is now so confident about killing journalists that it can admit to
  killing six journalists and media workers while only one was allegedly its
  target. The international community has been woeful in its condemnation of
  Israel’s actions. And that includes our own journalism community. Whereas the
  Committee to Protect Journalists received significant offers of support and
  solidarity when journalists were being killed in Ukraine at the start of
  Russia’s full-scale invasion, the reaction from international media over the
  killings of our journalist colleagues in Gaza at the start of the war was
  muted at best. In some high-profile killings – such as that of the Reuters
  journalist Issam Abdallah – some governments trotted out well-worn defences of
  press freedom, but stopped well short of seriously censuring Israel. And few
  took any concrete steps – such as the halt of arms sales or the suspension of
  trade agreements – that might have forced Israel to change course. Now, with
  more than 192 journalists and media workers killed since the start of the war
  – the deadliest conflict for journalists that we have ever documented –
  condemnation from individual journalists and some newsrooms has grown more
  vocal. But it is hard to see, if Israel can wipe out an entire news crew
  without the international community so much as batting an eye, what will stop
  further attacks on reporters. Already our window into Gaza was becoming more
  and more limited. As Israel moves into the latest phase of its assault on the
  territory, it now risks closing altogether. Jodie Ginsberg is CEO of the
  Committee to Protect Journalists
