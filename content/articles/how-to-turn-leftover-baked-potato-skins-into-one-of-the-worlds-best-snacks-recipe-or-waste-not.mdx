  Some recipes, such as the gnocchi featured here last week, require only the
  fluffy insides of a baked potato, leaving the skins behind. Plenty of people
  leave the skins of their jacket spuds uneaten, too, though heaven knows why:
  it’s easily the best bit. These humble leftovers are an opportunity to make
  one of the most indulgent savoury treats known to humankind: loaded potato
  skins. I love them with just sea salt and a dollop of mayonnaise or soured
  cream, but they’re also gorgeous piled high with whatever bits and pieces you
  have to hand, turning scraps and leftovers into something that’s totally
  scrumptious. Fridge-raid loaded potato skins This recipe is about being
  inventive and making the most of whatever you have in the house. I grill my
  loaded skins, rather than baking them, both to save energy and to speed up the
  cooking, which still achieves that perfect crunchy skin. Feel free to
  experiment with flavours and textures. Some of my favourite combinations
  include broccoli, bacon and blue cheese; crumbled sausage with cream and sage;
  and tomatillo salsa with black beans and a cooling dollop of yoghurt. When I
  made these skins, I had some leftover aubergine curry, a nub of grana padano,
  yoghurt, the end of a jar of chilli jam and some mint leaves, and they all
  came together beautifully. By embracing leftovers and simple pantry staples,
  this recipe shows how easy it is to make a show-stopping snack or meal from
  ingredients that might otherwise be forgotten or thrown in the food compost.
  Serves 2 Leftover potato skins, ideally with a little flesh still left on –
  aim for 1-2 skins per person Oil, for brushing Sea salt and black pepper
  Optional toppings and fillings (to taste; you’ll need between 1 and 3 tbsp in
  total per potato skin) Leftover cooked or raw vegetables – steamed greens,
  roast veg, cherry tomatoes Cooked protein or pulses – bacon, lentils, drained
  cooked beans Leftover cooked stew or meat – chilli con carne, bolognese,
  crumbled cooked sausage, shredded chicken 20g cheese, such as cheddar, feta or
  blue cheese, crumbled or grated Sauce – tomato salsa, tomatillo salsa, pesto A
  creamy element – yoghurt, creme fraiche, hummus A few fresh herb sprigs –
  parsley, mint, chives, spring onions Condiments to finish – mayonnaise,
  mustard, hot sauce, chutney, lemon juice, pickle brine Brush both sides of
  each leftover potato skin lightly with oil and season with sea salt. Put the
  skins cut side up on an oven tray and grill for five minutes, until they’re
  starting to crisp up. Flip and grill the other side for another five minutes,
  until golden and blistered, then serve with mayo or soured cream, or with
  yoghurt and a squeeze of lemon, or load with your own choice of toppings. To
  load the skins, start with one to two tablespoons of any wet ingredients such
  as cooked or raw vegetables, then top with a tablespoon of cooked pulses or
  protein or leftover meat or stew such as chilli con carne or bolognese.
  Scatter on 20g crumbled or grated cheese per skin, then return to the grill
  for five minutes, until hot and bubbling. Finish with a spoonful of salsa,
  chutney or pesto, or with a tablespoon of something creamy. Garnish with
  chopped herbs or spring onions and a drizzle of hot sauce, lemon juice or
  pickle brine for welcome sharpness, then serve hot.
