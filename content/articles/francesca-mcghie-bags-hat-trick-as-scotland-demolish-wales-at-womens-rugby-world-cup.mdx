  The emotion of the Scotland players at full-time here perhaps told you
  everything you needed to know about the importance of this afternoon. Their
  buildup to the World Cup has been mired in controversy, with their head coach,
  Bryan Easson, confirming his departure after this tournament as well as
  contractual disputes surrounding many of their squad. But all those factors,
  and all that motivation, blended together to deliver a stunning performance
  and a significant victory. With the might of Canada and the slightly less
  problematic Fiji also in Pool B, it was not inconceivable to suggest this was
  the most important game of the opening weekend, doubling up as a straight
  shootout for a place in the knockout stages. Games between these two sides are
  notoriously close; no Scotland supporter needs reminding about Keira Bevan’s
  86th-minute penalty that split the sides at the last World Cup. But this was
  different, with Scotland magnificent in taking a sizeable step towards the
  quarter-finals. Easson perhaps summed it up best. “A performance like that
  doesn’t really surprise us,” he said. “But it’s extremely satisfying; we were
  ruthless in attack and defensively we made Wales look pretty ordinary.” He is
  not wrong: there were times when Wales were made to look sub-par. They must
  now, in all probability, defeat Canada and Fiji to qualify unless the latter
  can pull off a shock against Scotland next Saturday. Their head coach, Sean
  Lynn, said: “I’ve just said to the players that’s just not good enough. We
  said we wanted to be physical and credit to Scotland, they bullied us off the
  park. You can’t start both halves like that.” This was Scotland’s biggest
  victory over Wales, and their biggest margin of victory in a World Cup game
  since 1994, with the tone set inside 55 seconds as Francesca McGhie finished a
  fine move down the left. It would not be the last time Scotland would exploit
  that area of the pitch. Wales responded with a try for co-captain Alex
  Callender but the greater moments of dominance on the gainline belonged to
  Scotland. They went back ahead when McGhie claimed her second before Leia
  Brebner-Holden finished another patient piece of attacking play after Wales
  initially halted a break in midfield. A penalty from Bevan either side of the
  second and third Scottish tries kept it mildly in the balance at the break,
  with Wales trailing by nine. But when McGhie completed her hat-trick in a
  carbon copy of her first try to clinch the bonus point, the writing was very
  much on the wall for Wales. They survived a 10-minute period without Gwen
  Crabb, but shortly after she returned Scotland pushed further ahead when Evie
  Gallagher cut through. There was even time for Emma Orr to add a sixth try
  with two minutes remaining but by then the damage had long since been done to
  Wales’s qualification hopes.
