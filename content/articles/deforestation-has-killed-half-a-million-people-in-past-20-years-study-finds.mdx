  Deforestation has killed more than half a million people in the tropics over
  the past two decades as a result of heat-related illness, a study has found.
  Land clearance is raising the temperature in the rainforests of the Amazon,
  Congo and south-east Asia because it reduces shade, diminishes rainfall and
  increases the risk of fire, the authors of the paper found. Deforestation is
  responsible for more than a third of the warming experienced by people living
  in the affected regions, which is on top of the effect of global climate
  disruption. About 345 million people across the tropics suffered from this
  localised, deforestation-caused warming between 2001 and 2020. For 2.6 million
  of them, the additional heating added 3C to their heat exposure. In many
  cases, this was deadly. The researchers estimated that warming due to
  deforestation accounted for 28,330 annual deaths over that 20-year period.
  More than half were in south-east Asia, owing to the larger populations in
  areas with heat vulnerability. About a third were in tropical Africa, and the
  remainder in Central and South America. The study was published on Wednesday
  in the journal Nature Climate Change. Researchers in Brazil, Ghana and the UK
  compared non-accident mortality rates and temperatures in areas affected by
  tropical land clearance. Previous studies have shown how cutting and burning
  trees causes long-term localised warming, but the new paper is the first to
  calculate the ensuing death toll. Prof Dominick Spracklen of the University of
  Leeds said the message was that “deforestation kills”. He expected many people
  would be shocked by the findings because the local dangers of deforestation
  were often lost in the global climate debate and the market-focused expansion
  of agricultural frontiers. As an example, he pointed to the Brazilian region
  of Mato Grosso, where there has been massive deforestation to open up land for
  vast soya bean plantations. Farmers from this area are now pushing for an end
  to the soy moratorium in the Amazon so they can clear more territory.
  Spracklen said leaving the canopy intact would save lives and boost farm
  production. “If Mato Grosso can keep its forests standing, people there will
  experience less heat stress,” he said. “This isn’t just the west urging forest
  protection for the sake of the global climate. The forests directly benefit
  local communities. They regulate temperature, bring rainfall, and support the
  agriculture people depend on. These forests aren’t idle – they’re working
  really hard and doing something really important for us.”
