  The French finance minister, Éric Lombard, has said the government would have
  to compromise on plans to cut the budget deficit if the prime minister,
  François Bayrou, is toppled in a confidence vote next week. Lombard told the
  Financial Times that fresh negotiations would require the government to make
  concessions to the left to reduce the size of the fiscal package if the
  government falls. While opposition parties have said they will vote against
  Bayrou and bring down the government on Monday, Lombard said he still hoped
  Bayrou would survive. Lombard said he was confident that either Bayrou or a
  successor could still pass a budget before the year-end deadline. He dismissed
  concerns of an impending debt crisis in France, saying: “We will take care of
  the deficits.” Bayrou this week began a last-ditch round of talks with party
  leaders, days before he is expected to be ousted over his unpopular austerity
  measures and debt-reduction plan. The prime minister, who has vowed to “fight
  like a dog” before the confidence vote he has called for 8 September, said the
  “fate of France” was hanging in the balance. But opposition parties said this
  week it was too late for him, that there would be no support for the budget
  measures and that Bayrou would certainly fall, bringing the government down
  and leaving France in a political crisis. Bayrou, a centrist and longtime ally
  of the president, Emmanuel Macron, said the coming days were crucial to gain
  support for his proposed €44bn (£38bn) budget squeeze, which includes
  scrapping two public holidays and freezing most welfare spending, without
  which he said France would struggle with the “curse” of public debt. The
  Communists, the first party to meet Bayrou on Monday, said there was no chance
  of Bayrou surviving the vote. Stéphane Peu, a Communist lawmaker, said: “This
  government is going to fall.” Marine Le Pen, of the far-right National Rally,
  said after meeting Bayrou this week that there had been “no miracle” and the
  party was resolved to vote against him. She said Bayrou was “in denial, cut
  off and irresponsible”. The National Rally president, Jordan Bardella, said
  the current government was a “sinking ship”. The Socialist party said it would
  only meet Bayrou this week to say goodbye. Other parties on the left,
  including the Greens and La France Insoumise, refused to meet Bayrou, saying
  it was pointless. The leader of parliament, Yaël Braun-Pivet, a key figure in
  Macron’s centrist grouping, told France Inter radio this week: “There maybe
  should have been more dialogue with opposition parties this summer.” She said
  Bayrou should abandon his proposal to scrap two bank holidays. But she
  reiterated her trust in the prime minister, saying that if the government
  fell, there should be cross-party talks to find some kind of broad consensus
  on a 2026 budget. It is not certain what would follow Bayrou’s expected fall.
  Macron could appoint a new prime minister, who would also be likely to face
  the same divisions over the budget. Macron has said he is not in favour of
  calling another snap election. Parliament has been deadlocked since Macron
  called an inconclusive snap election last June. The national assembly is
  divided between three groups with no absolute majority: a left alliance took
  the most seats but fell short of an absolute majority; Macron’s centrist
  grouping took losses but is still present; and the National Rally gained seats
  but was held back by tactical voting from the left and centre.
