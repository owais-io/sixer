  It was the hottest day of the year so far when the central air conditioning
  started blowing hot air in the mobile home where Richard Chamblee lived in
  Bullhead City, Arizona, with his wife, children, and half a dozen cats and
  dogs. It was only mid-June but the heat was insufferable, particularly for
  Chamblee, who was clinically obese and bed-bound in the living room as the
  temperature hit 115F (46C) in the desert city – situated 100 miles (160km)
  south of Las Vegas on the banks of the Colorado River. The family could not
  afford to immediately replace or repair the AC system, so instead they bought
  a window unit and installed it next to Chamblee’s bed. They positioned fans,
  ice packs and cold drinks close by in an effort to keep Chamblee cool and
  hydrated, checking in on him every couple of hours. But the mobile home is
  old, open-plan and poorly insulated. Despite their efforts, the temperature
  hovered close to 100F in the house, according to Chamblee’s son John. Chamblee
  overheated and struggled to breathe. His core temperature measured 108F when
  he was rushed to the emergency room, but doctors were unable to cool him down,
  according to the death report obtained by the Guardian using the Freedom of
  Information Act (Foia). Chamblee’s heart stopped working. He had died just two
  days after the AC went out. “It was the end of the day and it was cooling off
  slightly, so we thought he’d be OK. He thought he would be OK,” said his wife,
  Sherry Chamblee, who works three jobs including as assistant manager at a
  local grocery store. “We had no idea the heat could be so dangerous so quickly
  inside. It just happened so fast.” Chamblee was just 52 years old. He was a
  devout Baptist, smart and happy-go-lucky, and he loved playing video games.
  “We did our best to cool him down, but we live a couple of hours from Death
  Valley, the hottest place on Earth, and my dad couldn’t move,” said John, 21.
  “My mom lives paycheck to paycheck and if the AC breaks down in the summer and
  you can’t afford to fix it, you will die here. My dad proves that.”
  Nationwide, one in five of the lowest-income households have no access to air
  conditioning, while 30% rely solely on window units, according to exclusive
  analysis by the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (Neada) for
  the Guardian. As many as 60% of American households live paycheck to paycheck,
  while one in three report forgoing basic necessities such as food or medicine
  to pay energy bills and avoid disconnection. Heat is the deadliest weather
  phenomenon in the US and globally, killing almost half a million people
  worldwide each year, according to the World Health Organization. The death
  toll is rising as human-caused climate crisis drives more frequent, more
  brutal and longer heatwaves. Last month marked 30 years since what was then an
  unprecedented five-day heatwave in Chicago that killed more than 730 people
  and sent thousands to hospital. The majority were elderly, Black, isolated,
  low-income residents either lacking air conditioning or the money to run it.
  Since then, deadly heat domes have hit every corner of the country, including
  northern states unaccustomed to extreme heat, such as Oregon and
  Massachusetts. Yet the US has failed to implement a robust methodology to
  count and understand the scale of the heat-related illnesses and deaths. As
  the planet heats up, experts warn that indoor heat deaths among elderly, sick
  and low-income people could surge amid deepening financial hardship driven by
  Donald Trump’s energy policies, trade wars and his administration’s
  dismantling of the social safety net. “The United States is being governed by
  a regime that depends on denying scientific findings from climate science to
  economics and medical science to sociology,” said Eric Klinenberg, the author
  of Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in Chicago and director of the
  Institute for Public Knowledge at New York University. “We’re not just failing
  to protect vulnerable people, we’re actively making life here more precarious.
  And while some will be able to buy their way out of the problem, most people
  can’t. This is an existential crisis,” said Klinenberg. Energy poverty in the
  world’s richest country One in three American households experiences energy
  poverty – the inability to access sufficient amounts of energy due to
  financial hardship, according to one recent study. And it’s getting worse. The
  average household electric bill during the summer months, when cooling drives
  up usage, will reach $784 in 2025 – a 6.2% rise from $737 last year, according
  to analysis by Neada for the Guardian. This will be the highest recorded in
  more than a decade, and will place a disproportionate burden on low-income
  Americans. Families in the south and south-west are disproportionately
  affected. The Chamblee family experienced severe energy poverty until 2023,
  when they saved $1,000 to install residential solar panels that qualified for
  tax credits, and cut the family’s summer electricity bills from around $400 to
  $60 a month. The federal solar tax credit included in Biden’s Inflation
  Reduction Act ends in December, however, thanks to Trump’s One Big Beautiful
  Bill Act – a decade earlier than planned. Trump’s budget will lead to
  residential electricity bills in Arizona increasing by $220 on average by
  2035, by truncating the development of new, cost-effective solar energy
  capacity in the sunny state, according to analysis by Energy Innovation.
  Trump’s signature legislation will also slash access to food stamps and
  healthcare, relied upon by millions of low-income households, in order to fund
  tax cuts for the wealthy. Nationwide, meanwhile, his unprecedented and chaotic
  rollback of federal incentives and permits led to the cancellation of $22bn of
  clean energy projects in the first six months of 2025, more than half in
  Republican states. Earlier this month, Arizona’s Republican-controlled
  regulator also voted to begin the process of repealing the state’s renewable
  standard, which required that at least 15% of utility energy supplies should
  come from renewable sources by 2025. Consumer and environmental advocates –
  and the state’s attorney general – warn the move will further drive up energy
  bills. And in Arizona and across the country, private utilities have submitted
  proposals for multibillion-dollar rate increases, in order to cover
  infrastructure upgrades, inflation and new fossil fuel projects – driven, at
  least partially, by the unchecked expansion of massive datacentres promoted by
  the Trump administration. “Families are already struggling with high energy
  bills, and forcing them to cross-subsidize some of the world’s wealthiest
  corporations violates both fairness and common sense,” said Mark Wolfe, an
  energy economist and director of Neada. “It will worsen energy poverty, erode
  public trust, and turn utilities into vehicles for corporate welfare.” Taylor
  Rogers, a White House spokesperson, dismissed criticism of Trump’s energy
  policy as “fearmongering”. “The best source of energy in a heat wave is
  baseload energy from coal and natural gas, which the president has unleashed
  and made more affordable, not intermittent energy sources like solar,” Rogers
  said. “By increasing energy production, eliminating burdensome regulations,
  and streamlining permitting, President Trump is ensuring that US energy meets
  the energy demands for heat waves, data centers, and grid stability.” Energy …
  on the credit card Household utility debt is reaching crisis levels, jumping
  from $17.5bn in January 2023 to $21bn in June 2025 and forecast to climb as
  high as $25bn by the end of this year. Currently, only 26 states and the
  District of Columbia have rules restricting some utility shutoffs over the
  summer, and disconnections could hit 4m by the end of 2025, according to
  Neada. Amid soaring energy costs, shrinking federal aid, hotter summers and a
  zip code lottery when it comes to utility disconnection rules, health experts
  warn that households on fixed incomes and those with medical issues such as
  diabetes, heart disease, obesity and addictions will be most vulnerable.
  “These are preventable deaths, and the situation is going to get worse as
  bills go up and hardship increases,” said Vjollca Berisha, a former senior
  epidemiologist at the Maricopa county department of public health who tracked
  energy insecurity and indoor deaths. “It only takes a little push to knock
  down people with underlying conditions if they don’t have options.” In
  Maricopa county, which includes Phoenix, last year, almost a quarter of the
  608 confirmed heat-related fatalities happened inside, with people over 50
  accounting for the vast majority of those who died at home. A quarter of the
  county’s indoor deaths took place in RVs or mobile homes, a popular source of
  affordable housing, especially for retirees, but which are often poorly
  insulated and too rundown to qualify for weatherization programs. The vast
  majority of those indoor heat victims had AC at home, but the unit was broken
  in 70% of cases – while one in 10 had no electricity to run even a fan,
  according to Maricopa county’s 2024 report. Patricia Miletich, a 70-year-old
  woman with memory issues, died in June 2024 at a 55+ RV resort with pickleball
  courts, a golf course and bistro in the hot and dusty city of El Mirage
  north-west of Phoenix. According to her autopsy report obtained by the
  Guardian, a neighbor told death investigators that Miletich had forgotten to
  pay her bills on multiple occasions, resulting in her electricity being turned
  off in the past. The power was on when she died, but the AC was not
  functioning. Like Chamblee’s, it blew hot air from the vents, between 109F and
  117F. The resort’s manager confirmed to the Guardian that Miletich’s power had
  been disconnected several times, but declined to answer further questions
  about what support the retiree received. “It’s a sad situation that should
  never have happened, but she wanted to be left alone and the family didn’t
  know” about her memory decline and electricity shutoffs, said her brother
  Michael Miletich. In nearby Mohave county, a Guardian analysis of death
  reports obtained under Foia found that 70% of the 67 confirmed heat-related
  deaths in 2024 occurred indoors – of which the vast majority lived in RVs or
  mobile homes. This includes Stephen Patterson in Lake Havasu City, a
  69-year-old with multiple health challenges tied to a childhood road traffic
  accident, chronic pain and alcohol addiction. Patterson relied on his $1,000
  monthly social security check – the sole source of income for around 40% of
  seniors, according to one 2020 study. According to Regina, his sister and main
  carer, Patterson rationed his AC use because he believed he could cope with
  the heat but not without alcohol. He also incorrectly blamed the AC for a mold
  issue. When he died, the temperature inside Stephen’s house was 102F,
  according to the medical examiner’s report. The daily high in Lake Havasu City
  was 116F. “I begged him to turn on the AC,” said Regina, who is 75 and, like
  her brother, is also on a fixed social security income. “I would have paid his
  bill on my credit card, but my brother was a stubborn man. It was like a
  furnace when I found him.” Regina uses credit cards to pay her electric bill,
  currently $211 a month, as well as her water, trash, car insurance and cable.
  The cards charge as much as 35% interest. Around 60% of her monthly income
  covers the house payment, and the rest goes to service the credit card debt,
  which currently stands at more than $12,000 – in addition to almost $1,000
  owed to the energy company. She diligently documents each month’s payments and
  remaining credit in an A4 notebook that sits on the coffee table next to the
  TV remote. Regina has been disconnected multiple times over the years, but has
  received some financial help from the Salvation Army and Goodwill to avoid a
  shutoff. Yet she was unaware of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program
  (Liheap), the chronically underfunded federal program to help families pay
  their energy bills, which the Trump administration proposed cutting after
  firing the entire workforce in April. In Arizona, 24,000 households received
  Liheap assistance in the 2025 fiscal year. A third of recipients included a
  household member with a disability or children under six, while 16% included
  an older adult. Liheap was saved amid bipartisan protests, but its future
  remains uncertain. Arizona, where heat deaths are known to occur from April to
  November, currently only has enough funds to help struggling families through
  the end of September. On his first day back in the White House, Trump declared
  a national energy emergency, promising to lower prices by boosting fossil
  fuels and rolling back Joe Biden’s renewable energy ambitions. To Regina
  Patterson, it all now rings hollow. “The price of everything keeps going up
  and I get into more debt every month. Trump is evil and only cares about the
  rich,” she said. “If I were to lose my electric in this heat, I would lose my
  head.”
