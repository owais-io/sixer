  The White House has requested that a US military base on the outskirts of
  Chicago assist with immigration operations as the Trump administration plans a
  broader takeover of Democratic-run “sanctuary cities”. On Thursday, the Naval
  Station Great Lakes (NSGL) confirmed that the Department of Homeland Security
  had reached out for assistance, telling the Associated Press that the DHS had
  requested “limited support in the form of facilities, infrastructure, and
  other logistical needs to support DHS operations”. An NSGL spokesperson told
  the outlet that no decisions have been made regarding the request and that the
  base has not yet received any official request to support a national guard
  deployment. The Guardian has reached out to the NSGL for comment. In a
  statement to the Guardian, a DHS spokesperson said: “President Trump has been
  clear: we are going to make our streets and cities safe again. Across the
  country, DHS law enforcement are arresting and removing the worst of worst
  including gang members, murderers, pedophiles, and rapists that have
  terrorized American communities. Under secretary [Kristi] Noem, ICE
  [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and CBP [Customs and Border Protection]
  are working overtime to deliver on the American people’s mandate to arrest and
  deport criminal illegal aliens and make America safe again.” The signal from
  the Trump administration comes just a few weeks after the president directed a
  federal takeover of Washington DC – deploying the national guard, taking over
  the police department, and ramping up immigration raids and deportations in
  the city. On Thursday, Trump’s “border czar”, Tom Homan, commented on what
  could be the government’s next move. “You’re going to see a ramp-up of
  operations continue in New York, operations continuing in LA … Portland,
  Seattle, all these sanctuary cities that refuse to work with Ice, where we
  know public safety threats are being released every day into this country,” he
  said. Chicago, specifically, has been the target of much of Trump’s ire,
  including a Truth Social post over the weekend about homicides in the city, in
  which he said: “Can this be possible? The people are desperate for me to STOP
  THE CRIME, something the Democrats aren’t capable of doing.” The city’s mayor,
  Brandon Johnson, and the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, have repeatedly
  defended the city and its recent drop in crime. On Wednesday, the Chicago Sun
  Times first reported about the DHS’s request for the naval base, citing an
  email from commanding officer Capt Stephen Yargosz to his leadership team.
  “These operations are similar to what occurred in Los Angeles earlier this
  summer. Same DHS team,” Yargosz wrote, adding: “This morning I received a call
  that there is the potential to also support National Guard units. Not many
  details on this right now. Mainly a lot of concerns and questions.” According
  to Yargosz, law enforcement officers with the DHS, Ice and CBP will be
  stationed at the military base from 2 to 30 September. Speaking to the Chicago
  Sun Times, Illinois leaders pushed back against the idea of federal
  enforcement being deployed to the largely Democratic city. “Forcing the
  military, uninvited, into Chicago to intimidate Americans in their own
  communities does not make our nation stronger,” said the senator Tammy
  Duckworth. “It’s yet another unwarranted, unwanted and unjust move straight
  out of the authoritarian’s playbook that will only undermine our military’s
  readiness and ultimately weaken our national security.” Echoing similar
  sentiments, the senator Dick Durbin told the Chicago Sun Times that local
  leaders “have not asked for or consented to President Trump bringing in the
  military to ‘save’ our city”. “And now he reportedly wants to further abuse
  his power, waste government resources, and undermine military readiness by
  using Naval Station Great Lakes as a center of his operation in Illinois … May
  I remind the president that deploying the military to Chicago, and derailing
  critical operations at Naval Station Great Lakes, would be both unhelpful and
  illegal,” said Durbin. Pritzker, said in a press conference on Wednesday that
  he has not yet received any communication from the White House about a
  potential federal deployment. “I want to be clear, we have received no calls
  from the White House, from the federal government, from anybody who might be
  in charge of some sort of troop movement,” said Pritzker. The Guardian has
  reached out to Pritzker’s office for comment. Many Democrats have criticized
  Trump’s federal crackdowns. On Sunday, the House minority leader, Hakeem
  Jeffries, accused Trump of “playing games with the lives of Americans”, adding
  that the president had “manufactured a crisis” to justify sending national
  troops into the Illinois city. “I strongly support the statement that was
  issued by Governor Pritzker making clear that there’s no basis, no authority
  for Donald Trump to potentially try to drop federal troops into the city of
  Chicago,” Jeffries said.
