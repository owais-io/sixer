  My husband, Ron Taylor, who had died aged 75, was a social worker and teacher,
  and a lifelong socialist and anti-racist involved in many campaigns for
  justice. In the 70s he was a member of the Anti-Nazi League and a founder
  member of the Hebden Bridge Asbestos Action Group in West Yorkshire along with
  his first wife, Renata. In 1979 he helped set up the alternative newspaper the
  Calder Valley Press. During the miners’ strike Ron formed a local support
  group and organised fundraising gigs including one featuring the folk musician
  and comic Mike Harding. Ron had moved to Hebden Bridge in 1971, having
  graduated in politics and social policy from the University of Leeds. He then
  worked for Rochdale social services and in 1980 joined Calderdale College in
  Halifax, teaching social work and later becoming a popular counsellor in
  student services. Between 2000 and 2007 he was a project worker for the NCH
  (now Action for Children), during which time he walked the Great Wall of China
  to raise money for the charity. After Ron’s retirement in 2007, he and I
  started visiting Palestine and quickly became involved with Ta’ayush (Arabic
  for “living together”), a grassroots non-violent Jewish/Arab movement to
  promote peace and co-existence. We made regular visits to the West Bank,
  working with villagers and subsistence farmers in the south Hebron hills. Ron
  would send postcards back to Yorkshire that were featured in the local
  community website, Hebweb. He presented many talks and screenings about the
  plight of Palestinians and their daily struggles. Ron and I spent long days
  with the charity Care4Calais distributing essentials to refugees, and Ron also
  supported refugees locally. Born in Cheadle, Greater Manchester, he was the
  son of Margaret (nee Ellis) and Cyril Taylor. Cyril was a pharmaceutical rep
  who had once served Haile Selassie at Boots the chemist during the Ethiopian
  emperor’s exile in Bath; Margaret was a homemaker. As a pupil at Queen
  Elizabeth grammar in Wakefield, Ron was able to play only rugby but, on
  leaving school, he was able to follow his passion for football. He was a
  lifelong supporter of Manchester City. In 1996, Ron and a group of friends
  formed a local five-a-side football club called the Old Gits, and he played
  his last game of seven-a-side at the age of 75. The team now call it the Ron
  Taylor FC in his honour. Ron’s marriage to Renata (nee Dempsey) ended in
  divorce. He and I married in 2000. He is survived by me, his daughter Kerry
  from his first marriage, my children, Sandra, Jürgen and Zoë, and six
  grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
