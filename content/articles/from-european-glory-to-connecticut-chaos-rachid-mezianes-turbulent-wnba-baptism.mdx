  After achieving three of his biggest career accomplishments in eight months,
  Rachid Meziane crossed the Atlantic to make personal history. The native of
  southern France joined the WNBA’s Connecticut Sun in December as the league’s
  first European-born head coach. Four months earlier, Meziane guided Belgium to
  their best finish ever in Olympic women’s basketball: fourth place at the
  Paris Games. Four months before that, he led French club ESB-Villeneuve d’Ascq
  to their first national women’s championship since 2017 and their first
  EuroLeague final ever. “I knew it was a new challenge, a new story to write,”
  Meziane says of the move. “When you are a coach, you want to compete against
  the highest level in the world. I think that the ‘W’ is the best league in the
  world, with the best players in the world, the best coaches in the world. It
  was a big opportunity. I couldn’t pass on this opportunity.” Meziane, who
  coached Belgium to the 2023 EuroBasket women’s championship, called his hiring
  a dream come true at his introductory press conference. But that dream quickly
  turned into a living nightmare. Meziane’s new team will finish with the worst
  record in their history and one of the poorest in the WNBA this season. Mix in
  severe criticism on social media from a former player with the ongoing
  uncertainty surrounding the Sun’s future, and the ingredients are in place for
  an exasperating season. Yet management anticipated the exasperation. The Sun
  chose to rebuild after six consecutive appearances in the WNBA semi-finals,
  including two trips to the finals. All five of last year’s starters left
  through trades or free agency. Only two members of the 2024 roster remain,
  with five rookies joining them. “It’s a complete 180,” says Sun guard Marina
  Mabrey, one of the two returning players. “Last year, there was a lot of
  seasoned experience, vets sniffing a championship year after year, trying to
  take a ring. This year, it’s younger players adapting to the league and trying
  to find their feet. It’s a very different generation.” General manager Morgan
  Tuck, also in her first year, believes Meziane possesses the right qualities
  to supervise the reconstruction. “We knew our roster was going to really turn
  over even before we hired Rashid,” says Tuck, who gave Meziane a four-year
  contract. “I think he had the right characteristics we were looking for. I
  think he’s a very consistent guy. When you’re having a lot of losses and not a
  lot of success on the court, it’s easy at times to hit the panic button, to
  just try anything and get away from the plan. So the one thing I’m very proud
  of is that he’s sticking to the plan.” That plan involves fusing the WNBA’s
  physical play with the European emphasis on tactics and teamwork. “My style is
  playing up-tempo and being very aggressive defensively,” Meziane says. “I am
  trying to integrate my coaching style and my skills to teach my team to play
  with a team-first mentality, to share the ball, to play with a lot of ball
  movement.” But early results made the combination appear as stable as a
  mixture of Perrier and Pennzoil. The Sun lost their first five games, then won
  two of their next three before suffering a 10-game losing streak that gave
  them a 2-16 record on 6 July. Entering this week, the team ranked last in
  points per game, three-point percentage, assists and defensive rebounds, and
  shared last place in victories and total rebounds. With about two weeks left,
  the Sun could surpass the WNBA record for most losses, set last year by the
  Los Angeles Sparks at 32. “The physicality is the most different thing in this
  league,” Meziane says. “The game is played with more pace here, more rhythm.
  To play back-to-back and to play every two days is something new for me.
  Everybody has a lot of talent. You can see in this league that the best teams
  can lose against every team. Every game is its own story. Sometimes in Europe,
  you can win all of the games by 20, 30 or 50 points.” Toward the end of that
  10-game streak, one of Meziane’s former players posted stinging criticism on
  29 June on X. Kelsey Bone, who played on ESB-Villeneuve d’Ascq’s championship
  squad, called him “BY FAR the worst coach I’ve ever played for” because “he
  lacks the aggression and assertiveness needed to rally and lead a locker
  room.” Meziane’s response? “She is not my enemy,” he says. “I helped her a lot
  when she came to France because she had terrible things to leave. I allowed
  her to arrive super late when we started our training camp. So if she’s the
  only one who thinks that about me, I don’t care. I can look at myself in the
  mirror. I hope that she can do the same thing.” Meziane’s response reflects a
  calm, focused perspective in the midst of chaos, whether to social media or to
  reports indicating a possible sale. One of the two potential ownership groups
  would move the team to Hartford, Connecticut. The other, led by former Celtics
  minority owner Steve Pagliuca, would move the Sun to Boston, where they played
  a regular-season game this year and last year. But the WNBA has yet to approve
  any sale, and could purchase the team itself. “He’s just tuning it out,”
  Mabrey says about those reports. “He really doesn’t get rattled emotionally.
  He doesn’t give his energy to social media. I think that’s kind of cool from a
  United States perspective because [we’re] big on status, ego, stuff like that.
  But he’s blocked that out and made it like, if you’re hooping, you’re hooping.
  If you’re not, you’re not.” Though committed to his system, Meziane seeks to
  give players the opportunity to create. “He likes to give people the freedom
  to play, how they play offensively particularly,” says Sun guard Haley Peters,
  who played under Meziane for two seasons in France. “He’s going to let players
  do what they can do and I think that’s a strength of his. We have a system we
  want to stick to, but we have good offensive players and we want them to be
  aggressive.” Though committed to his system, Meziane seeks not to force
  players into a preconceived template. “There’s a lot of people that want to
  change me, want me to be different emotionally, this and that,” Mabrey said.
  “He’s let me be myself and helped me to channel it, take criticism and move
  on.” As his players adapt to him, Meziane faces his own cultural challenges.
  “English is not my native language,” he says. “Sometimes when you want to
  express your emotion, it’s not easy to do it every time when it’s not your
  natural language. The biggest challenge for me is to try to be natural, to
  make sure my players are understanding what I try to express to them and try
  to teach them.” Sun center Tina Charles, a 16-year WNBA veteran and the
  league’s most valuable player in 2012, empathizes. “I played overseas for 11
  years,” says Charles, who won three Olympic gold medals for the United States.
  “Anything that is uncomfortable is growth, even for us as players and for him
  as a coach. It’s just being patient, having grace and helping him along the
  way.” As the Sun goes about rebuilding, patience and grace become Meziane’s
  most important tools. “Even if the reflection of our results is not good, I’m
  still optimistic about how my team can play in the future,” he says. “I think
  a lot of our new players are growing. I can put my hand on this rebuilding
  process but I don’t have magic tricks to change everything overnight.”
