  Would-be car buyers considering ditching petrol for electric tend to fret –
  not always correctly – about higher upfront costs, access to chargers and
  whether their battery will last on long journeys. But Keir Starmer has an
  unusual obstacle to making the switch – Britain’s largest carmaker has claimed
  electric vehicles (EVs) do not offer adequate bomb protection. The prime
  minister’s armoured Range Rover Sentinels will need to remain as petrol
  versions for the foreseeable future, according to their manufacturer, Jaguar
  Land Rover. JLR addressed the issue in written responses to a government
  consultation on EV sales rules. The documents – obtained by Fast Charge, a
  newsletter covering electric cars, and shared with the Guardian – detailed how
  JLR and other carmakers lobbied the UK government to weaken targets requiring
  them to sell more EVs each year. JLR said armoured cars should be excluded
  from the targets, known as the zero emission vehicle mandate, because it “does
  not see any workable engineering solution to the challenges surrounding an
  armoured BEV [battery EV], primarily because the required safety levels and
  blast protection cannot be achieved”. Armoured vehicles are a small but very
  profitable business for carmakers. They usually have bulletproof glass, armour
  plating, and “bomb blankets” under the floor, adding hundreds of kilograms of
  weight to already heavy cars. While JLR did not say what specific
  vulnerabilities it sees in armoured electric vehicles, key engineering
  roadblocks are likely to include the extra weight from the battery cells,
  range issues and the time needed to recharge. However, its German rival BMW
  does not appear to share those worries: its electric i7 Protection saloon
  offers “special armouring” in the floor and ceiling to protect against
  explosives on the ground and those carried by drones. JLR said the UK
  government was the main customer in Britain for its armoured vehicles. The
  vehicles are built at the company’s site at Solihull in the West Midlands and
  then converted by its special vehicle operations department. Precise
  specifications of Starmer’s fleet of Range Rover Sentinels are not public to
  avoid aiding potential attackers, but they are understood to have 5-litre V8
  engines, designed to allow the heavy cars to speed off if threatened. The
  prime ministerial fleet also includes non-electric, German-made armoured Audi
  A8 saloon cars, which replaced the Jaguar XJ after that model was
  discontinued. Tom Riley, the author of the Fast Charge newsletter, said: “This
  is the first time I’ve come across ‘blast anxiety’ as an excuse not to switch.
  Clearly, it’s a valid concern, but it does mean the prime minister could be
  the last Brit to go electric.” For motorists who do not need to worry about
  bomb attacks, overall lifetime costs for electric cars are significantly lower
  on average, while “range anxiety” should not be a problem for those who rarely
  make journeys longer than 200 miles and live in places where charging
  facilities are increasingly common, such as the UK, western Europe or parts of
  the US. JLR declined to comment.
