  The Guardian view on Anas al-Sharif and Gaza’s journalists: Israel is wiping
  out the witnesses | Editorial

  Anas al-Sharif knew that far from offering protection amid the slaughter in
  Gaza, his press credentials further endangered him. The Committee to Protect
  Journalists (CPJ) warned last month of acute danger to the 28-year-old’s life
  as the Israel Defense Forces stepped up online attacks on him. These were not
  merely smears, but a death threat in response to his coverage, the Al Jazeera
  reporter said. And now he is dead, one of five media workers killed in an
  airstrike on Sunday. The CPJ says that more than 180 Palestinian journalists
  and media workers have been killed in almost two years of war – more than the
  number who have died globally in the previous three years. This does not
  merely reflect Gaza’s vast death toll – 61,599, most of them women and
  children, according to the health ministry and many more if independent
  experts are correct. Nor does it merely reflect the courage shown by
  reporters, photographers, camera operators and others in a war zone. The CPJ
  says 26 of the reporters were targeted. Israeli officials have bragged of
  killing Mr Sharif, whom they have claimed was the head of a Hamas terrorist
  cell, planning rocket attacks against Israeli civilians. Mr Sharif and Al
  Jazeera had already denied this. It would surely be hard for such a prominent
  figure to combine reporting with command of such a unit. The documents offered
  up by Israel as evidence end two years before the war began, and were
  reportedly screen grabs of electronic spreadsheets, not independently
  verified. Israeli officials have repeatedly offered wildly misleading and
  rapidly shifting accounts of events, including the killing of paramedics in
  Gaza this spring. In 2022, an IDF general reportedly told American officials
  within hours that one of its soldiers had probably shot dead the acclaimed
  Palestinian-American Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh in the occupied
  West Bank – but Israeli officials insisted publicly that Palestinian militants
  were to blame. No justification has even been attempted for the deaths of Mr
  Sharif’s colleagues. Mr Sharif’s 90-year-old father was killed in an airstrike
  on their home in late 2023, after Israeli military officials called the
  journalist telling him to stop reporting and leave Gaza. Israeli claims that
  he was a Hamas fighter resurfaced last month after his emotional reporting on
  starvation went viral. He was killed as outrage mounted over Gaza’s famine and
  shortly after Israel announced its plan to launch a ground offensive in Gaza
  City, which would only deepen the catastrophe and is reportedly opposed by
  many in the military too. The deaths of the Al Jazeera team in the city ensure
  few are left to bear witness to what unfolds. International correspondents are
  unable to enter Gaza except on escorted military trips during which they
  cannot speak to Palestinians. Sheltered by the US, Israel’s government appears
  unmoved as international public opinion turns against it and even staunch
  allies blench at the horrors of Gaza. The Al Jazeera killings have been widely
  and rightly condemned. The Reporters sans Frontières group has also urged the
  international criminal court to investigate the treatment of media workers.
  “If these words reach you, know that Israel has succeeded in killing me and
  silencing my voice,” Mr Sharif wrote in a posthumously published statement.
  Deliberately targeting journalists is a war crime: an assault not only on the
  person, but on truth itself. Yet it cannot disguise Israel’s other atrocities.
  Rather, it adds to the charge sheet against its leaders. • This article was
  amended on 13 August 2025. An earlier version gave the year of Shireen Abu
  Akleh’s death as 2023.
