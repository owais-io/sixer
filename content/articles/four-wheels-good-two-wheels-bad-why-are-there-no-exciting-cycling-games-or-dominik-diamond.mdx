  I have spent a week trying to save the universe. Not by leading a hardened
  team of oddball veterans in an assault on a despot’s intergalactic outpost,
  nor by completing a series of well-written tasks to build up my warrior mage
  so they can defeat some ancient malignant omnipotent deity. I have done it by
  completing easy races on a bicycle. Sounds ridiculous? Welcome to Wheel World.
  It seems the epitome of arch to criticise a video game for its ridiculous plot
  when I am happy to have plumbers save worlds by stomping on mushrooms, or
  hedgehogs doing similar while wearing snazzy sneakers. I even took Arbroath FC
  to the European Cup final in Championship Manager once. But the plot of Wheel
  World seems so clumsily stuck on I suspect 10% of the code is pure Blu-Tack.
  There is a spirit in your bike who looks like a skull and therefore is called
  Skully. Because it’s that kind of game. You need to win the seven lost parts
  of his Legendary Bike by beating the cyclists who have them, so Skully can
  enter the Soul Sewer to reach Mount Send and perform the Great Shift ritual to
  fly to the moon and save the universe. Just typing that plot makes my fingers
  vibrate with the clunkiness. It’s lo-fi hipster hippy claptrap. And it didn’t
  need to be like this. The original plot of what was initially called Ghost
  Bike involved memorials placed by the roadside to mark the deaths of cyclists.
  That sounds much better but it was ditched in favour of lighter fare. Now,
  according to the Messhof studio boss Mark Essen, “There’s some silly lore in
  there, and there’s a creation myth, and deities people pray to, but it’s like,
  take it or leave it.” If the people making the game aren’t bothered about the
  story, how am I expected to be? But who cares, eh? This is a racing game: they
  don’t need plots do they? Not if they supply fingernail-munching,
  edge-of-the-seat rollercoasters of excitement. But this doesn’t. It’s not a
  terrible game, not by any stretch. It’s a decent if far too easy attempt to
  put Tony Hawk on two wheels in a world that looks like a blander version of
  Jet Set Radio, and if you have Xbox Game Pass it’s “free”. It passed the
  “sitting and thinking of it when I am not playing it” test, which is my main
  indicator if I am in to a game or not. But every time I went back to it, my
  whelm was distinctly under rather than over. You don’t have weapons or crazy
  power-ups, there’s no multiplayer mode, you can’t knock other cyclists off
  bikes (they don’t even seem to be knocked over by cars in the same way you
  are), and although there are a myriad of witty bike builds, you don’t need
  them. I completed the game using one that made me crazy fast and one that gave
  me good grip and handling. That used 14 bike parts. The game has more than
  170. It’s just not escapist enough for me because I can do a lot of the things
  in this game in real life. I can get on my bike right now, race after another
  cyclist, ring my bell at him and say: “Hey, Lone Wolf, I challenge you to a
  race.” Just like you do in Wheel World. Actually, real life may be more
  exciting because there is a chance the other cyclist will kick my head in for
  being obnoxious. I want games that let me do stuff real life doesn’t. I loved
  Road Rash on the Mega Drive because I didn’t have a motorbike. I can play
  football, but not with the players or tricks I could use in Fifa. I will
  probably never be the captain of a spaceship – apologies for the lack of
  ambition – so I loved playing everything from Elite to Mass Effect. I’m not
  saying that all games should feature smart bombs and dragons. I get the appeal
  of farm, train and bus sims: they allow you to take an interest and make it
  interactive. There are only so many people who can be Network Rail operators
  in real life, so fair play to you if you want to spend two hours a day doing
  so virtually. I don’t even mind if you wear a special hat when you do. I can’t
  help but feel there is a cool bicycle game out there waiting to be made. The
  control mechanic will always be imperfect because holding down a button to
  pedal isn’t remotely realistic, while rotating a thumbstick round and round to
  make you cycle faster, like a circular-motion version of Track &amp; Field,
  would get irritating (and painful) really fast. There could be a cycle courier
  version of Crazy Taxi, or a game that replicates the joy of having a bike when
  you are a kid: all about wheelies, backies and clothes-pegging different
  football cards in the spokes to make a motorbike sound, almost like the bike
  parts of the wonderful Bully. Until then, I will survive on the memory morsels
  of Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX on the PlayStation, the original two-wheeled Tony
  Hawk rip off.
