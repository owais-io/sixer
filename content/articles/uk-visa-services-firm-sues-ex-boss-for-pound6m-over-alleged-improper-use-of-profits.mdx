  The company that runs visa services for the UK government is suing its former
  chief executive for £6m over her alleged improper use of profits earned during
  a period of record immigration. Cloud Bai-Yun, who once represented the UK on
  an international ethics and fraud advisory body, is accused by Ecctis of a
  breach of fiduciary duty, according to court filings. The company claims that
  she oversaw profit making on a not-for-profit government contract and this
  money was ultimately used in 2021 to pay her £17.587m for her shares in
  Ecctis’s holding company. Ecctis’s claim against Bai-Yun is for £4.63m, plus
  more than £2m in interest. Bai-Yun said: “I wholly deny the allegations made
  against me by the new management of Ecctis and will be defending myself in
  court.” Ecctis runs the official language tests and qualification recognition
  services for those applying for certain UK visas or permissions. Under a
  not-for-profit contract with the Department for Education (DfE), it is claimed
  that Ecctis was obliged to reinvest any profit earned or to keep a maximum of
  half of the net gain in reserve. It is alleged that Bai-Yun, who was chief
  executive from 2014 and a director since 2006, instead improperly approved
  large dividend payments in 2016 and 2017 to a holding company. Bai-Yun was the
  sole shareholder of the holding company and in 2021 that money was used to buy
  her shareholding for £17.587m, it is claimed. The shares were then transferred
  to an employee-owned trust. Bai-Yun’s defence claims there were no
  restrictions in Ecctis’s articles of association on paying dividends and that
  it was for her as the shareholder to make the decisions on the payments. The
  legal action by Ecctis follows its repayment to the government of £13.64m
  after a DfE audit concluded the company had failed to reinvest profits in its
  services. Bai-Yun, who had moved from being chief executive to chief adviser
  on the sale of her shares, was asked to resign from the latter role after the
  2022 audit. The Guardian revealed details of the scandal in January this year,
  leading the DfE’s most senior civil servant to tell the Common’s public
  accounts committee that officials had undertaken a “very hard review” of
  “serious failings”. The new legal row will be an embarrassment to the DfE,
  which renewed Ecctis’s contract this year with changes that ensured all
  profits were directly paid to the government. Insiders at the company have
  voiced concerns that Ecctis continues to hold a monopoly on services they say
  would be better run directly by the state. Ecctis has seen a huge increase in
  revenue in recent years owing to historically high levels of immigration,
  particularly in the post-Brexit period. According to Ecctis’s particulars of
  claim, the payment in 2016 of a £2.16m dividend to the holdings company was
  questioned at the time by the finance director at the company, Robert Wall.
  Wall wrote that his understanding was that they were supposed to operate “as a
  not-for-profit business”, it is claimed. Despite this, the board, with Bai-Yun
  in attendance, went on to approve a further dividend in 2017 of £2.5m. Ecctis
  claims the dividends were “constituted almost entirely of net profit” from the
  government contracts, leaving it in breach of the agreement with the DfE. The
  company further alleges: “In February 2021, funds including the 2017 dividends
  were passed to the defendant as part of the £17.587m sale price.” Ecctis’s
  claim for £4.6m plus interest in “remedy” covers only the 2016 and 2017
  dividend payments. There is a time limitation on claims. The claim refers,
  however, to the DfE’s audit which found that £16.63m in dividends were paid in
  total up to 2021 and that this money was ultimately “put towards the purchase
  price” of £17.587m paid to Bai-Yun. Ecctis claims Bai-Yun failed in her duty
  as a director of Ecctis to promote the success of the company and avoid
  conflicts of interest. In her defence, Bai-Yun claims the price she received
  for her shares was £17.5m and not £17.587m. She claims there was no
  contractual restraint on the use of the balance of the net profit once
  appropriate investments in the services were made. She denies a conflict of
  interest as she approved the dividends as the shareholder of the holding
  company, rather than as a director of Ecctis. She claims Wall was mistaken in
  his understanding of the contract with the DfE. A DfE spokesperson said: “Our
  new, strengthened contract, alongside a new leadership team at Ecctis, means
  the department can continue to work with Ecctis to provide a good service to
  the public on the recognition of qualifications, which is a requirement under
  international law.”
