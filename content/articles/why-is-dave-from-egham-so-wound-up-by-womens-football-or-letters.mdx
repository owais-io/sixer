  Barney Ronay’s article, inspired by the radio rant by “Dave from Egham” about
  being unable to stand women’s voices talking about football and having women’s
  football “thrown down our throats” during Euro 2025, was refreshing and
  entertaining (The soundtrack of the women’s Euros was happiness … and some men
  can’t cope, 2 August). At a recent family gathering, some of the men started
  talking about the same thing – how there were so many women presenters and
  commentators talking about football and not just women’s football, no, but,
  God forbid, men’s football, and actually sport in general! What is the world
  coming to? How dare these women speak knowledgably in articulate sentences and
  joyful tones? And like “Mrs Dave”, my sister joined in and supported the
  patriarchal point! The conversation continued along this vein for some time,
  eventually arriving at the well-worn waffle about “women can’t play football
  as well as men and shouldn’t be paid the same, blah blah blah…” Helen Johnson
  Nottingham • I ask myself why some men are so antagonistic to women’s
  football, why they feel it is being “thrown down our throats”, and why they
  can become so wound up by women’s voices and generally be so misogynistic and
  so open about their poisonous beliefs. My guess would be that they feel
  jealous and under threat. Not since the heady days of women’s football
  attracting large crowds (like Dick, Kerr Ladies, who drew a crowd of 53,000 at
  Goodison Park on Boxing Day 1920) has women’s football been so popular. But
  the men were back from war, and it was time for them to have their game back.
  So, obligingly, the FA disallowed women from playing on affiliated pitches for
  half a century. In men’s football, England has led the way with the formation
  of the Premier League, attracting players and fans from around the world –
  even if, internationally, we always fall at the last hurdle, or before. Then
  along came the women’s troops, gaining attention after much ridicule and
  playing good football – and not rolling around on the floor and berating the
  referee. There are plenty of sports on TV, to watch or not. The “Dave from
  Egham” types should get on with their own lives and stop being such haters –
  it’s bad for their health. Laura Farningham Vejer de La Frontera, Spain • What
  Barney Ronay describes as the happiness of the Euros is, to my mind, just what
  sport should be. The sport was competitive, exciting and skilful, but there
  was still a sense of proportion. It was sport, not life, and the people
  playing it went back to homes that were something like those of their fans.
  Sport is a game, chaps. You can still celebrate endeavour and skill, but just
  stop taking it all so seriously. The Lionesses showed us, again, that sport
  can be pure joy. Kathryn Streatfield Richmond, North Yorkshire • I arrived in
  the British Isles in 1968 and was completely mystified by the warfare between
  football fans. I’d support whatever team appealed at the time and could never
  drum up any hatred for the other side. I hadn’t realised that I was watching,
  and enjoying, the women’s football because that anger and threat of violence
  was missing. I would like to thank Barney Ronay for the explanation. Beth
