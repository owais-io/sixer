  Much has changed since Kim Cotton became the UK’s first surrogate 40 years
  ago, when she was forced to flee hospital on the floor of a car under a
  blanket, such was the level of media frenzy around her story. She describes it
  as a harrowing experience and wishes much of that surrogacy journey had been
  done differently. “It wasn’t the right way to do surrogacy, but it was the
  only thing that was offered,” she says. But it didn’t put her off surrogacy
  and instead helped her form a “profound passion” for empowering others to
  follow a similar path in a more supportive environment. She also went on to
  become a surrogate for twins born in 1991, which she describes as a beautiful
  experience. She has spent decades running the surrogacy agency Cots
  (Childlessness Overcome Through Surrogacy), facilitating more than 1,000
  pregnancies. But in September she is closing its doors as soaring demand and a
  lack of surrogates is making the job more stressful than ever before. “The
  pressure I feel to try to find people surrogates now, it’s just overwhelming,”
  Cotton says. “I get phone calls every day from couples, often in tears. The
  desperation is just heartbreaking. It’s terrible.” There are now about 400
  children a year born through surrogacy to UK parents, up from about 50 a year
  before 2008, and more than half are now born through international surrogacy
  arrangements. Pro-surrogacy campaigners have blamed the stringent laws in the
  UK for pushing more people to seek surrogacy arrangements abroad, sometimes in
  countries with lax or nonexistent regulations. Waiting lists at many British
  surrogacy agencies are now years long. “As soon as same-sex parents could go
  for a parental order, demand doubled, but supplies remained the same,” Cotton
  says. “There’s also just more infertility around. There’s so much cancer. And
  it’s affecting young women now, they’re having a hysterectomy in their 20s or
  30s. “It is very difficult. It is very frustrating. And it’s like trying to
  run an agency with your hands behind your back.” The UK’s surrogacy laws have
  changed little since they were first introduced in 1985, when they were rushed
  through parliament as a direct response to Cotton’s pregnancy. In 2023 the Law
  Commission published a report with suggested changes, including the creation
  of a national surrogacy register, and ensuring intended parents in domestic
  surrogacy arrangements can become parents from the child’s birth. Under
  current laws, intended parents have to apply for a parental order after birth,
  which can take months and create issues over who makes decisions about the
  baby’s healthcare in the first weeks of life. “In 1985 I said yes, I’m the
  birth mother, but my husband is not the father – he’s had a vasectomy. But I
  still have to put him down as the father on the birth certificate. Back then
  it was bad, and nothing has changed,” Cotton says. “The laws are so
  antiquated, they’ve not changed since 1985 when I was a surrogate, but it was
  a kneejerk law that was passed. It’s fossilised. It’s a dinosaur. And it’s
  just on the back burner now. It’s a damn shame.” Campaigners were hopeful the
  Law Commission report would lead to reform, but the change of government in
  2024 has pushed surrogacy to the bottom of the agenda. There is also strong
  opposition from those who are concerned that relaxing the laws could lead to
  people being coerced into surrogacy by financial need, or wealthy people
  outsourcing pregnancy because they have the resources to do so. Cotton says:
  “We don’t want people doing it for the wrong reason. We don’t want anyone just
  thinking, oh, that might be a great way of earning money. There really needs
  to be altruism involved because it’s priceless what they do. “I’m sure things
  will change in the future, but it’s politics. It’s too slow for me. And that’s
  why I have to back out, because I really thought we were going to get change
  with the Law Commission, and then suddenly the government changed and that was
  it, end of.” As well as parental rights from birth, Cotton said she would like
  to see reform of the expenses system for surrogates. As commercial surrogacy
  is banned in Britain, advertising for surrogates is not permitted and only
  “reasonable expenses” are allowed to be paid. Cotton says this seems to have
  been accepted as about £15,000-£20,000, although there is no official guidance
  around what is permitted. “If the surrogate baby has been living with a couple
  since the baby was born, how are they going to say, well, no, actually I can’t
  give you a parental order because you paid a bit too much to the surrogate?”
  Cotton says. “So we need more clarity.” Although she is closing down Cots,
  Cotton is reluctant to leave the world of surrogacy behind completely, and
  says she will continue to offer advice to people through a surrogacy advice
  line. “I’m as passionate about surrogacy as I was 40 years ago. I think it’s
  the most amazing area to work in,” she says. “The couples are the most
  determined people I’ve ever come across in my life. “And it’s an absolute
  honour to work with the surrogates. It really is. When I listen to them talk,
  I think: what a wonderful soul you are. Some of them express milk for six
  weeks, or three months sometimes, to help the baby get started. Isn’t that
  amazing?”
