  The retailer, Claire’s, known for tween jewellery and ear piercing is
  preparing to appoint administrators in the UK and Ireland, after it struggled
  to keep up with competition from online retailers such as Amazon. The decision
  puts 2,150 jobs at risk and comes after Claire’s in the US and Canada filed
  for bankruptcy this month. We would like to hear your memories of Claire’s and
  what it means to you. We’re also interested in hearing from anyone who works
  for the retail store and what the news might mean for you. If you’re having
  trouble using the form click here. Read terms of service here and privacy
