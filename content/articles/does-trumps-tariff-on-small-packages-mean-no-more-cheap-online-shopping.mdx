  A longstanding tariff exemption that let people skip import fees for
  small-value packages ended on Friday, leaving small businesses and postal
  services around the world scrambling to apply Donald Trump’s tariffs to
  millions of shipments. Experts say the change could mean up to $13bn in extra
  costs and delayed shipping for consumers as businesses adjust to the change.
  Here’s what we know about the end of the exemption. What is de minimis? The de
  minimis exemption allowed packages valued at less than $800 to be shipped into
  the US tariff-free. The exemption comes from the Tariff Act of 1930. US
  Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which oversees tariff collection and
  package inspection at ports and airports, estimated that 1.36bn shipments into
  the US were de minimis in fiscal year 2024. The total value of de minimis
  shipments hit $64.6bn that year – the second highest after 2020. Which
  retailers are affected? The end of the exemption does not affect major
  retailers like Target, Costco and Walmart because those companies typically
  ship in bulk containers that exceed $800 in value and are already being taxed.
  Instead, the exemption largely applied to businesses that have a
  direct-to-consumer model, including Chinese e-commerce brands Shein and Temu
  and small businesses overseas. Other businesses, like manufacturers that
  directly sold to consumers on platforms like Amazon and Walmart’s storefronts,
  also accounted for a big chunk of de minimis packages. Shipments from China
  once made up more than half of all de minimis shipments entering the US,
  though Trump ended the exemption for China and Hong Kong in May. In late July,
  Trump signed a surprise executive order announcing he would end the exemption
  for all countries. What does this mean for prices? These companies are now
  making the challenging pricing decisions that major retailers have been
  mulling over for months: how much should prices go up because of tariffs? Erin
  McLaughlin, a senior economist at the Conference Board, said that though items
  at low-cost retailers like Shein and Temu are likely to stay cheaper than
  traditional retailers, shoppers are still likely to notice price increases.
  Shein and Temu now have to act like traditional retailers, which have more
  complicated shipping chains. “They will still offer some of the cheapest
  apparel and other things because those were cheaper to begin with, and even if
  you’re buying things through a more traditional retailer, there’s still
  tariffs on them,” McLaughlin said. “But maybe the variety might be a little
  bit smaller because the goods have to be stored in a warehouse.” Why is the
  exemption being stopped? The White House said the exemption was a loophole
  that hurts American manufacturers while also posing a risk to national
  security, claiming bad actors use the exemption to smuggle illegal drugs into
  the country. “Many shippers go to great lengths to evade law enforcement and
  hide illicit substances in imports that go through international commerce,”
  Trump said in an executive order ending the exemption for all countries.
  Unlike Trump’s tariff orders, the de minimis exemption received bipartisan
  scrutiny after the number of shipments soared during the pandemic. Last year,
  the Biden administration proposed rules that would reduce the number of de
  minimis shipments and “stop the abuse” of the exemption. The Tariff Act of
  1930 set the de minimis threshold at any package that was valued at $1. In
  2015, the threshold went from $200 to $800, allowing companies to ship a high
  volume of low-cost goods without tariffs. This is why postal services outside
  the US said they were halting the shipment of small packages. “In a sense,
  this is an operational nightmare because we are talking about small-value, but
  large-volume shipments,” said Li Chen, professor of manufacturing management
  at Cornell University. “The quantity is huge and every single package needs to
  be tracked.” While other countries have de minimis exemptions, the thresholds
  are generally much lower than $800, typically under $200. Who will be hit
  hardest? A research paper from earlier this year called the de minimis
  exemption a “pro-poor trade policy” because shipments covered by the exemption
  tended to be shipped to the poorer zip codes. In an email to the Guardian,
  Amit Khandelwal, a professor of global affairs and economics at Yale
  University and one of the authors of the paper, said that the end of the de
  minimis could be seen as a tax increase for lower-income Americans.
  “Lower-income consumers tend to spend relatively more on shipments that enter
  through the de minimis channel, and those shipments tend to be relatively more
  from China,” Khandelwal said. “Since tariffs on China are high, that means
  ending de minimis will basically look like a regressive tax increase.” With
  huge growth in other countries, e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu will
  probably be able to survive the end of de minimis, even if they pass higher
  costs on to consumers. Instead, the end of the exemptions will hurt small
  businesses abroad that have reached US customers through platforms like Etsy
  and TikTok Shop and ship directly to them. Small businesses abroad have warned
  customers that they are either temporarily ending shipments to the US or
  increasing their prices because of tariffs. In a notice to customers, the
  South Korean skincare retailer Olive Young said that a 15% customs duty, the
  current tariff rate for the country, will be placed on all products with the
  end of the de minimis exemption. Etsy warned sellers that tariffs may increase
  pricing and encouraged them to communicate with buyers on how tariffs will
  affect prices. “As you communicate with your buyers about their orders, keep
  in mind that some buyers may not have paid tariffs before,” the company said.
