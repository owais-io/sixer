  This football season will be the most-watched and lucrative in UK history,
  with a record number of live televised games and seven days-a-week viewing for
  fans. The boom is a timely boost for Sky and the BT-Warner Bros Discovery
  (WBD) joint venture TNT Sports, which will air almost all of the prestige
  games, as competition for viewers’ attention from deep-pocketed US streamers
  and their pipeline of hit shows such as The Bear and Severance increases. It
  is estimated that there could be more than 1,500 matches broadcast in the UK
  this season involving British teams playing in competitions including the
  Premier League, Champions League, English Football League (EFL) and FA Cup.
  Sky will also be hoping the Lionesses’ Euros triumph will help to boost
  audiences for its Women’s Super League (WSL) coverage when the new season
  kicks off with the champions Chelsea hosting Manchester City on 5 September.
  The pay-TV broadcaster will air this match as part of a new five-year rights
  deal, under which nearly every WSL match will be broadcast live either by Sky
  – up to 118 a season – or the BBC, with up to 21. “It is a cornucopia of
  football,” says François Godard, a sports media analyst at Enders Analysis.
  “Certainly it will be the biggest we’ve ever seen in terms of numbers of
  viewers.” As the Premier League season gets under way fans can look forward to
  seeing a third more matches on TV this season – a record 267 – as the new
  £6.7bn, four-year contracts with Sky and TNT Sports come into effect. Sky’s
  £5.1bn swoop for four of the five live packages at the last auction in 2023
  marked its biggest win since Rupert Murdoch snatched the rights from
  free-to-air TV in 1992 and changed the face of British football. The auction
  also resulted in Amazon quietly withdrawing from streaming live Premier League
  action in the UK. The reward is immense: Sky will air 215 live Premier League
  games this season, an almost 70% increase, and follows on from the £935m,
  five-year deal with the English Football League that has seen the number of
  games broadcast or streamed each season jump from 200 to 1,059. “If you go
  back to when the Premier League started we had 60 games, which at the time
  felt like a step forward,” says Nick Herm, group chief operating officer at
  Sky. “If you are a fan of a specific football team, or English football
  leagues generally, you now have impressive choice. There aren’t any fans of
  any clubs left behind.” TNT Sports has the same number of Premier League games
  but will begin airing FA Cup ties live, for which it promises the “most
  expansive coverage ever”, taking over from the BBC and ITV. A sub-licensing
  deal will see the BBC continue to air some FA Cup games live. And with six
  English teams in the Champions League, TNT Sports is also banking on a bumper
  year. Football governing bodies have effectively been forced to offer more
  games in order to increase the value of their deals, after the bursting of the
  sports rights inflation bubble when BT ended its challenge for football
  supremacy against Sky. However, the release of many more games has also
  coincided with the streaming boom, which has given broadcasters the ability to
  offer almost unlimited coverage freed from the restrictions of a limited
  number of TV linear channels, as TNT Sports showed with its blanket coverage
  of every event at last year’s Paris Olympics. “The advent of streaming and
  digital platforms has led to consumer choice and optionality, which is
  becoming the real winner when it comes to sport,” says Andrew Georgiou, the
  president and managing director at WBD UK &amp; Ireland and WBD Sports Europe.
  “Previously it was narrow editorial choices on single linear feeds. This is
  continuing evolution, a really good thing, you can now almost get any football
  match you want.” While across all of its men’s football, cumulative reach was
  up 17% season-on-season, on its streaming platforms growth was 37%. In
  response, the company has just launched a sports-only tier on its Discovery+
  streaming service for this season. Exclusive live sport has never been more
  important for traditional pay-TV operators such as Sky for attracting and
  retaining subscribers, with access to other premium content becoming more
  restricted as US media conglomerates including Disney and WBD retain the
  rights to hit shows for their own international streaming services. “On-demand
  viewing has grown as streaming has grown, but premium sport continues to be
  the most important appointment to view content that exists and it has become
  increasingly important,” says Georgiou. “When I look at advertising, and
  advertisers, there is resilience when it comes to sport. When I look at
  non-sport content it is gradually declining on broadcast and digital. Sports’
  key proposition is guaranteeing audiences in a fragmented media environment.”
  However, with live football now available to watch on TV or stream seven days
  a week, one analyst says there is a danger of it reaching“saturation” point
  and questions whether it will resonate with existing fans. For those attending
  games, there will be fewer 3pm Saturday kick-offs for Premier League and EFL
  fixtures and the prospect of matches being moved at short notice for live
  broadcasts. WBD’s Georgiou says that with many more games involving smaller
  clubs to be broadcast there will inevitably be ties with much smaller
  audiences – and there is always the competition for attention posed by other
  media. “Will games like Manchester United v Liverpool still get as strong
  ratings, yes, but when you add 100 games, the natural consequence is a longer
  tail of smaller audiences,” he says. “Certainly this year consumers will be
  given the biggest, broadest opportunity to watch football, and while there
  will be a larger total audience there is only a finite amount of time
  consumers have to watch content and sports content.” While streamers have made
  significant incursions into top-tier live sport rights in the US, most notably
  Amazon but also Google-owned YouTube and more recently Netflix, UK pay-TV
  broadcasters have so far managed to mostly retain the so-called “crown jewel”
  sports rights. “In today’s world there is so much content and choice but we
  know one of the things that really cuts through is live sport, there is a
  passion about it,” says Herm. “Sport is sold on an exclusive basis, we have a
  long history of doing it very well, and we have locked in the big sports
  rights for this decade.” Simon Davis, the founder of media agency Walk-In
  Media, agrees that live sport is more crucial than ever for Sky. “They are
  having to fight on all genre fronts now and are competing with streamers who
  are happy to sustain massive losses in the short term,” says Davis. “Sky, for
  example, has spent years arguing it is more than just sport and in ratings
  terms it has been very successful diversifying. But the question is in a world
  of subscription streamers for drama and movies, and Amazon in the UK investing
  in a wider range of live sport, does it have a business without football? In
  this case sport becomes absolutely key for them.”
