  A search-and-rescue mission is under way in the Timor Sea for a US sailor
  believed to have gone overboard from the USS George Washington on Monday. The
  aircraft carrier and its carrier strike group are conducting search-and-rescue
  operations in the sea, after “reports of a possible sailor overboard” on
  Monday afternoon, the US navy said in a statement. The Australian defence
  force and Australian Border Force are assisting in the search. The sailor’s
  name or rank, or the circumstances of the incident, has not been disclosed. A
  spokesperson for the Australian Department of Defence said the ADF was called
  in to support US search efforts “for a sailor … who was reported missing in
  the Timor Sea”. “Australian Defence Force-owned and Australian Border
  Force-contracted assets are supporting the search, including Royal Australian
  Air Force P8-A Poseidon aircraft and Royal Australian Navy Cape Class Patrol
  Boat ADV Cape Otway.” The USS George Washington returned to sea in 2024 after
  a major overhaul and upgrade. It is forward-deployed in Japan. The aircraft
  carrier – and its carrier strike group – are operating in the Timor Sea as
  part of Talisman Sabre 2025 exercises. Talisman Sabre is a biennial,
  multinational military exercise led by Australia and the United States. The
  2025 iteration involves more than 43,000 military personnel from 19 countries
  – including India, Indonesia, the UK and France. Three additional countries –
  Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam – are observers of the exercises. The Timor Sea,
  a shallow sea of the Indian Ocean, lies north-west of Darwin, between
  Australia and the island of Timor.
