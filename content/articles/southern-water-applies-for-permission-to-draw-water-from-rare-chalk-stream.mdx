  Southern Water has applied for a drought order that would allow it to draw
  water from an internationally prized chalk stream and rare salmon habitat even
  if its levels fell below what is deemed ecologically safe. The environment
  secretary, Steve Reed, has been urged to intervene and stop the water company
  from “significantly and potentially permanently damaging the river and the
  ecology within”. Southern Water has applied to Reed for a drought order to
  alter its licence on the River Test, a rare chalk stream in Hampshire that is
  home to endangered salmon and otters. The order would permit Southern to
  continue drawing from the Test even after its levels fall below flow levels
  scientists have deemed ecologically safe for the river. When rivers fall to
  low flow levels they can take years to recover, with potentially severe
  effects on fish spawning and river health. The river’s ecosystem can die off
  due to lack of oxygen, experts say. Yorkshire Water has similarly applied to
  Reed for a drought order on the River Ouse in York, and to the Environment
  Agency for 14 drought permits on its waterways, which are for smaller or
  shorter changes to abstraction licences. Drought orders are more serious and
  are granted by the secretary of state because they often allow larger or more
  urgent changes in water abstraction or reductions in river flows and can be
  more dangerous for the environment. Southern and Yorkshire Water (along with
  Thames and South East) have hosepipe bans in place. The sector has been
  criticised for failing to build reservoirs and to fix leaking pipes, while
  attention has also focused on the large pay packets awarded to some water
  company bosses. The Guardian recently revealed the boss of Yorkshire Water has
  received £1.3m in previously undisclosed extra pay since 2023, paid by an
  offshore parent company. The Test is running at low levels according to data
  from the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. It is a chalk stream, of which
  there are only about 200 in the world, 85% of which are in England. These very
  pure rivers are full of minerals from the chalk aquifer and create a habitat
  as biodiverse as a tropical rainforest. Feargal Sharkey, a water campaigner
  and former frontman of the Undertones, said Reed should urgently intervene.
  “The River Test is the world’s premier chalk stream. The whole of the UK
  population of wild salmon is now on the endangered list. They swim up the
  Test. This river has a flow limit and Southern Water wants to reduce that by a
  third. If you do this, you have now effectively banished an endangered species
  to oblivion by removing flow limits set to conserve one of the most endangered
  fish in the planet. Steve Reed should intervene right now and block this
  drought order.” Stuart Singleton-White, the head of campaigns at the Angling
  Trust, said: “No one should be surprised by the drought this year, so soon
  after the drought in 2022. This has been predicted, and in a changing climate
  will happen more often. But water companies weren’t ready. They have failed to
  build the storage and reservoirs we need, failed to fix the leaking pipes and
  failed to do enough to help us save water.” Southern Water has applied to
  amend the current permitted hands-off flow (HoF) of the river, a minimum river
  flow level, measured in megalitres per day (Ml/d). The current licence bans it
  from abstracting if river flow drops below 355 Ml/d, but it has now applied
  for a temporary drought order to lower this threshold to 265 Ml/d. A
  spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said
  the secretary of state would make decisions on these drought orders and
  permits “in due course”. A Southern Water spokesperson said: “We follow a
  strict legal process, set by the government and regulators, to ensure we are
  taking the correct steps to both keep supplying water to our customers and to
  mitigate any negative environmental impact at the same time. “We applied for a
  drought order on Friday 18 July for the River Test in accordance with this,
  but this would only ever be needed if river flows fall below 355m litres per
  day – allowing us to continue taking water to keep taps running. “We continue
  to monitor levels closely and are currently not close to this trigger. This is
  thanks to households and businesses across Hampshire and the Isle of Wight
  using less water, and our teams tackling leaks and optimising our water
  network around the clock. “Longer term, a new reservoir, water recycling
  schemes and water transfers from neighbouring areas are among the solutions
  which will build drought resilience for this area.” • This article was amended
  on 8 August 2025 to clarify the measures permitted by the drought order sought
  by Southern Water regarding the River Test.
