  Attacks on A&amp;E nurses have almost doubled over the last six years, with
  incidents often involving patients frustrated at waiting so long for care.
  Nurses have been punched, spat at, pinned up against a wall, had a gun pointed
  at them and been threatened with having acid thrown at them, according to the
  Royal College of Nursing (RCN). NHS figures show that the number of incidents
  of violence against nurses in A&amp;E units in hospitals in England rose from
  2,122 in 2019 to 4,054 in 2024 – a 91% increase. “Behind these shocking
  figures lies an ugly truth,” said Prof Nicola Ranger, the general secretary of
  the RCN, which obtained the data using freedom of information laws. “Dedicated
  and hard-working nursing staff face rising violent attacks because of systemic
  failures that are no fault of their own. Every incident is unacceptable,” she
  said. Rachelle McCarthy, a charge nurse in the east Midlands, said that in her
  A&amp;E department “even patients you would expect to be placid are becoming
  irate because of just how long they have to wait”. Once she was punched
  “square in the face” by “a drunk, 6ft 2in bloke”, she said. In another
  incident a patient in the waiting room of the A&amp;E where the senior sister
  Sarah Tappy works in east London punched her in the head, knocking her
  unconscious. “The violence is awful. And it’s just constant. Nurses. Doctors.
  Receptionists. None of us feel safe,” she said. A senior A&amp;E nurse in
  England’s south-west said she had seen violence against staff in her wards
  many times, including a patient “pinning a nurse up against a wall” and
  another colleague being punched by a patient “in the groin and stomach”. The
  number of attacks on A&amp;E staff at Southmead hospital in Bristol rose from
  83 in 2019 to 152 last year. They doubled at Manchester Royal Infirmary from
  39 to 79 over the same time period, and increased from 13 to 89 at Maidstone
  hospital in Kent, NHS figures given to the RCN showed. Daniel Elkeles, the
  chief executive of hospitals group NHS Providers, said: “These findings are
  absolutely shocking. “NHS staff need a safe and respectful environment to look
  after patients, free from any threat of violence or intimidation, be they in
  hospital, mental health, community or ambulance settings. “Delays for
  treatment are frustrating for patients and staff. Every effort is being made
  to keep these to a minimum.” The union demanded immediate government action to
  curb the “rising tide of violence”. It wants a reduction in the long waits for
  patients in A&amp;E, an end to overcrowded hospitals having to use “corridor
  care” and a solution to the shortages of nurses that are common across the
  NHS. A separate RCN analysis shows the number of patients who had to wait more
  than 12 hours in A&amp;E soared twentyfold between 2019 and 2024. Growing
  numbers of hospitals have hired more security staff, issued clinical staff
  with stab vests and installed more closed-circuit television. Rebecca Smith,
  the director of system and social partnership at the NHS Confederation, said
  the near doubling in attacks exposed by the figures was “deeply worrying”. “No
  one should have to face violence at work – it is totally unacceptable. These
  kinds of incidents not only have a huge impact on staff health and wellbeing
  but also retention of staff as well as NHS services and patient experience.”
  The RCN sent an freedom of information request to the 129 NHS trusts in
  England that have at least one emergency department. Of those 89 (69%)
  replied. However, the true figures will be higher as the union only asked for
  data relating to the biggest A&amp;E the trust runs. Their figures show a
  relentless rise in incidents over the six years, from 2,122 in 2019 to 2,297
  in 2020, then 2,851 in 2021, 3,120 in 2022, 3,405 in 2023 and finally 4,054 in
  2024. NHS Protect issued annual figures for violence, harassment and abuse of
  NHS staff until it was disbanded in 2016. The most recent NHS staff survey,
  published in March, found that one in seven workers (14.4%) had suffered
  physical violence from patients, their relatives or other members of the
  public in the previous year. Duncan Burton, chief nursing officer for England,
  said it was “totally unacceptable that NHS staff are facing acts of physical
  violence from patients and the public while at work”. He added: “NHS staff do
  an incredible job every day to care for others – and they have the right to
  come to work without fear of being harmed. We would encourage staff to report
  all incidents to their employer and for employers to inform the police where
  appropriate so that perpetrators can be brought to justice.” The health
  secretary, Wes Streeting, said: “I am appalled by these findings. Nurses
  dedicate their lives to helping others and deserve to go about their jobs free
  from violence or intimidation. Anyone who violates this core principle will
  feel the full force of the law.” • This article was amended on 12 August 2025.
  According to an RCN analysis, the number of patients having to wait more than
  12 hours in A&amp;E has risen twentyfold between 2019 and 2024; not 2019 and
  2014 as stated in an earlier version.
