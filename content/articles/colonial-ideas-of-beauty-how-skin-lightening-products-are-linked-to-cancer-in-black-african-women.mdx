  Two months after first going to hospital, a 65-year-old woman was dead – and
  her doctors are blaming the cosmetic creams she used on her face and body for
  decades. The anonymous patient, from Togo, is one of a string of recent cases
  reported in medical journals of cancers in black African women linked to
  skin-lightening creams and lotions, prompting dermatologists to call for
  better regulation. The melanin found in darker skin typically offers some
  protection against the sun damage which can cause cancers. “Patients with
  black skin have a natural SPF of about 15, just by having pigmented skin,”
  says Prof Ncoza Dlova, head of dermatology at the University of KwaZulu-Natal,
  South Africa,. “If they remove that melanin [with skin-lightening creams],
  they’re actually removing the natural protection.” Estimates of the use of
  skin-lightening products in African countries range from 25% to 80% of women.
  Lighter skin is often seen as more desirable, in a trend with complex drivers
  including values imported in the colonial era. Dlova and colleagues are
  writing up a paper citing more than 55 cancer cases, from countries including
  Mali and Senegal. “If we are getting self-induced skin cancer, then that’s a
  red flag and worrying,” says Dlova. “We have to do something about it.” The
  market for skin-lightening products is growing, with analysts predicting that
  the current market size of US$10.7bn (£8bn) will reach US$18.1bn by 2033.
  There are even reports of the products being used on babies and young
  children. For Dlova, they are “a health hazard that needs to be addressed”.
  Almost every day, she says, her clinic in Durban will see someone with a skin
  problem linked to lightening products. “Of course, not all of them are coming
  with skin cancer … They come in with fungal infections that are resistant to
  the common treatment that we normally use. They present with pimples, referred
  to as steroid-induced acne, as well as rosacea. Some present with permanent
  stretch marks; all these complications are extremely common.” The Togo patient
  had three large, painful, cancerous tumours on her neck, which she had tried
  to treat with antibiotics, antiseptics and traditional herbal poultices with
  no success before going to hospital. One of the tumours was removed, but the
  others were too close to blood vessels and she could not afford the
  recommended chemotherapy. She told her doctors she had used creams that
  included topical hydroquinone and highly potent corticosteroids for about 30
  years. In another series of eight cancers, reported in Senegal, the women had
  used similar products for about 20 years on average. Two of those patients
  died. Hydroquinone as a skin lightener has been banned in South Africa since
  1990, and other African countries including Rwanda, Ivory Coast, Tanzania,
  Kenya, and Ghana followed suit. Those bans were prompted by serious concerns
  about an irreversible form of skin damage called ochronosis. But regulation is
  often weak, and the products are reportedly still available from street
  vendors and cosmetic shops. The use of steroids in skin lighteners is a newer
  phenomenon. Topical steroids are used in dermatology to treat inflammatory
  skin conditions such as eczema, but a side-effect is that they make skin
  lighter, a fact exploited for their use in cosmetics. If the two problematic
  ingredients are used together they can have a “synergistic effect”, Dlova
  says. The International League of Dermatological Societies (ILDS) has
  published an alert warning about the dangers of misuse of potent topical
  steroids, and is calling for governments to better regulate the products. The
  problem goes beyond Africa, says the ILDS president Prof Henry Lim, with the
  problem first raised by its members in India. After South Africa’s
  hydroquinone ban, there was a lull in how frequently dermatologists
  encountered complications of skin bleaching, Dlova says “but again, in the
  last 10 years there was just a sudden eruption of the complications of skin
  bleaching again. Skin cancer per se had not been described before, it’s only
  been described recently. So obviously, things have got worse – because from
  irreversible pigmentation [ochronosis] to skin cancer, those are really red
  flags implying that we need to do something about it.” While the desire for
  lighter skin is not new, Dlova suspects the rise of social media over the past
  decade has led to increased use, pointing to smartphone filters that make skin
  look smoother and lighter. Tackling the issue will require action from many
  sectors – not only regulatory agencies. “Marketing, social media and media all
  have a role to play – fashion, celebrities and all of that. If they use black
  models who are lighter in skin colour, the message they are conveying is that
  you are prettier, you can be a model, you are more attractive if you are
  lighter. So we need to ensure that the advertisements include diverse skin
  colours when they are choosing their models,” says Dlova. She also wants to
  see skin health education in preschools to teach children to be proud of their
  natural skin, and to get across the message of using sunscreen. Some black
  patients will have skin challenges including pigmentation disorders, she says,
  which may require creams with lightening ingredients. But these should be used
  under medical supervision. Part of the ILDS advocacy will be asking
  pharmaceutical companies to make those prescription products more affordable,
  so that people do not need to turn to cheaper off-the-shelf products that may
  be dangerous.
