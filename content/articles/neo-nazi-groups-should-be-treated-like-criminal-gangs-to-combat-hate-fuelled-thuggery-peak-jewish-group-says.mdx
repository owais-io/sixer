  Australia’s peak Jewish group has called for criminal gang laws to be used as
  a template for a police crackdown on neo-Nazis, warning extremist groups will
  increase if allowed to flourish unchecked. An alleged attack by the National
  Socialist Network on an Indigenous encampment in Melbourne after the
  anti-immigration March for Australia rally has reignited debate over
  Australia’s approach to tackling extremist groups. Peter Wertheim, the
  Executive Council of Australian Jewry’s co-chief executive, said he did not
  believe the National Socialist Network met the threshold for a listed
  terrorist organisation because they had not engaged in terrorist activity. But
  he said they had a “clear propensity for hate-fuelled thuggery and menace” and
  that laws used to combat criminal gangs could be used as a model for them. He
  pointed to police powers like those used for outlaw motorcycle gangs as a
  template for combatting right-wing extremist groups that were not classed as
  terrorist organisations. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “Law enforcement
  agencies would need powers and resources analogous to those available to
  police under the current criminal gang laws,” he said. These would include
  powers to obtain control orders against members of designated organisations
  and persons who regularly associate with them, Wertheim said. He said this
  would also include “enhanced powers of investigation, search and seizure,
  powers to issue take-down orders to ISPs and social media platform providers,
  and powers to obtain public safety orders and firearms control orders. “The
  legislation should also include anti-consorting provisions making it an
  offence to associate with convicted offenders after receiving an official
  warning from a law enforcement agency,” he said. State and territory laws that
  aim to crack down on organised crime include specialised police units to
  enforce them. Wertheim said they had “considerable success” and could be used
  as a model for law enforcement to be bolstered with additional powers to deal
  with extremist groups. Dr Kristy Campion, a lecturer in terrorism studies, has
  previously told a parliamentary committee that some extreme right groups in
  Australia, including the NSN, had met the criteria to be listed as a terrorist
  organisation. “Their ideologies are quite fascist and within fascist
  ideologies, what you typically see is this positive endorsement of violence as
  a way to achieve social change,” she said. “Some of these groups, because of
  their ideologies, legitimise, endorse and glorify violence, including
  terrorism, to achieve their goals,” she said. Campion said listing a terrorist
  organisation was an “incredibly useful legislative tool” because it makes it
  an offence to join a proscribed group and helps law enforcement deter people
  from joining. Listing a terrorist organisation requires Asio to put a case to
  the home affairs minister who considers ideology, terrorist links and
  engagement to terrorism, Campion said. The governor can then list the group
  after the minister’s decision. The threshold for executive proscription of a
  terrorist organisation states that a minister must be satisfied that the group
  is directly or indirectly engaged in preparing, planning, assisting in, or
  fostering the doing of a terrorist act or advocates the doing of a terrorist
  act. Victoria police on Tuesday charged NSN leader Thomas Sewell with multiple
  offences after an alleged attack at Melbourne’s Camp Sovereignty site – a
  sacred Aboriginal burial ground and longstanding protest site – on Sunday.
  Indigenous leaders, including independent federal senator Lidia Thorpe, have
  called for the NSN to be treated as terrorists. The Victorian premier, Jacinta
  Allan, has pointed to the state’s strengthening of its vilification laws that
  could capture the recent behaviour of the NSN. Under the laws, which come into
  effect later this month, those found guilty of serious vilification offences,
  such as inciting hatred or making physical threats, will face up to five years
  in prison. The laws will increase the penalty from previous vilification
  offences, which were rarely prosecuted and carried a maximum penalty of just
  six months. The laws also expand existing protection against hate speech –
  previously limited to race and religion – to include disability, gender
  identity, sex and sexual orientation.
