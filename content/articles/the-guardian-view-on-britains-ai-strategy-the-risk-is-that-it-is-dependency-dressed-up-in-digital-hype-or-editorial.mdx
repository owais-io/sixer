  The Guardian view on Britain’s AI strategy: the risk is that it is dependency

  There was a time when Britain aspired to be a leader in technology. These
  days, it seems content to be a willing supplicant – handing over its data,
  infrastructure and public services to US tech giants in exchange for the
  promise of a few percentage points of efficiency gains. Worryingly, the
  artificial intelligence strategy of Sir Keir Starmer’s government appears long
  on rhetoric, short on sovereignty and built on techno-utopian assumptions.
  Last week Peter Kyle, the technology secretary, was promoting the use of
  AI-generated discharge letters in the NHS. The tech, he said, will process
  complex conversations between doctors and patients, slashing paperwork and
  streamlining services. Ministers say that by applying AI across the public
  sector, the government can save £45bn. But step back and a more familiar
  pattern emerges. As Cecilia Rikap, a researcher at University College London,
  told the Politics Theory Other podcast, Britain risks becoming a satellite of
  the US tech industry – a nation whose public infrastructure serves primarily
  as a testing ground and data source for American AI models hosted on US-owned
  cloud computing networks. She warned that the UK should not become a site of
  “extractivism”, in which value – whether in the form of knowledge, labour or
  electricity – is supplied by Britain but monetised in the US. It’s not just
  that the UK lacks a domestic cloud ecosystem. It’s that the government’s
  strategy does nothing to build one. The concern is that public data, much of
  it drawn from the NHS and local authorities, will be shovelled into models
  built and trained abroad. The value captured from that data – whether in the
  form of model refinement or product development – will accrue not to the
  British public, but to US shareholders. Even the promise of job creation
  appears shaky. Datacentres, the physical backbone of AI, are
  capital-intensive, energy-hungry, and each one employs only about 50 people.
  Meanwhile, Daron Acemoglu, the MIT economist and Nobel laureate, offers a
  still more sobering view: far from ushering in a golden age of labour
  augmentation, today’s AI rollout is geared almost entirely toward labour
  displacement. Prof Acemoglu sees a fork: AI can empower workers – or replace
  them. Right now, it is doing the latter. Ministerial pledges of productivity
  gains may just mean fewer jobs – not better services. The deeper problem is
  one of imagination. A government serious about digital sovereignty might build
  a public cloud, fund open-source AI models and create institutions capable of
  steering technological development toward social ends. Instead, we are offered
  efficiency-by-outsourcing – an AI strategy where Britain provides the inputs
  and America reaps the returns. In a 2024 paper, Prof Acemoglu challenged
  Goldman Sachs’ 10-year forecast that AI would lead to global growth of 7% –
  about $7tn – and estimated instead under $1tn in gains. Much of this would be
  captured by US big tech. There’s nothing wrong with harnessing new
  technologies. But their deployment must not be structured in a way that
  entrenches dependency and hollows out public capacity. The Online Safety Act
  shows digital sovereignty can enforce national rules on global platforms,
  notably on porn sites. But current turmoil at the Alan Turing Institute
  suggests a deeper truth: the UK government is dazzled by American AI and has
  no clear plan of its own. Britain risks becoming not a tech pioneer, but a
  well-governed client state in someone else’s digital empire. Do you have an
