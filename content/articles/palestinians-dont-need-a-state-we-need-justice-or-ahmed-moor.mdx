  There are few things the pro-Israel side gets right. But on one point – the
  Palestinians’ rejection of two states – they’ve been more-or-less correct. For
  me, and many others, the fundamental injustice of the establishment of the
  state of Israel – which occurred through massive, deliberate and purposeful
  ethnic cleansing designed to create a Jewish majority in historic Palestine –
  meant that Israel never really attained moral legitimacy among Palestinians.
  As Robert Malley and Hussein Agha write in their new book, Tomorrow Is
  Yesterday: “deep down, most Palestinians, though ready to accept Israel’s
  existence, have not accepted its historical legitimacy”, a statement whose
  veracity I can attest to. I remember being a 15-year-old in Palestine. I
  remember being held up at checkpoints in the West Bank, and being unable to
  visit Jerusalem or Israel because of the color of my ID card, in effect,
  because of my race. I could see how unjust, how retrograde, the entire basis
  of Israel was. No amount of German or western guilt over the Holocaust would
  make me accept the idea that Jewish supremacy in Palestine was somehow
  desirable, or just. I think that continues to be true for the overwhelming
  majority of Palestinians. Possibly, for the overwhelming majority of humanity
  in the post-colonial global south. That’s not to say that the political
  process – which commenced in Madrid and Oslo –wasn’t undertaken in good faith
  by sincere and earnest people. I know some of the negotiators on the
  Palestinian side, like Diana Buttu, a principled advocate for Palestinian
  rights for decades now. Daniel Levy, who negotiated for the Israelis, has been
  an outspoken opponent of Israeli apartheid and the genocide in Gaza, and a
  formidable critic of the peace process in the past 20 years. At its height in
  1995, the Oslo process, which was supposed to produce a Palestinian state, but
  more importantly, an end to claims, commanded the support of two-thirds of
  Palestinians. Many of them, like my parents, were prepared to close a chapter
  on history, to swallow their grievances so that their children might live.
  Similarly, the Palestinian negotiators I’ve met in the past two decades each
  understood the basic deficit of justice, the imbalance in the ledger, but they
  sought to abort a conflict which has ravenously claimed the future at every
  turn. In many cases their intentions were honorable. And yet, the failure of
  the peace process was preordained, readily apprehensible to anyone who lived
  in the Occupied Territories in the 1990s, when the settlements truly
  metastasized. It should have been obvious to anyone with a map and a history
  book, too. That’s because Zionism, Israel’s animating ideology, adheres to
  classically European colonialism, which continues to be the best framework for
  understanding Palestine/Israel. Writing in October 2003 in the New York Review
  of Books, the moral thinker and historian Tony Judt described Israel as “an
  anachronism”, essentially a throwback to the Belgian Congo or 18th-century
  Australia. Israel’s extermination of native life in Gaza is anachronistic,
  too. It rhymes, in the worst way. There were glaring structural reasons for
  Oslo’s failure as well. The fact that many of the American negotiators were
  Zionists was underreported, and underappreciated. Dennis Ross, who led the
  American team, is a Zionist, indistinguishable to my eyes from Ehud Olmert and
  Ehud Barak, two former Israeli prime ministers. Bill Clinton, who was
  president at the time, recently referred to “Judea and Samaria”, coded Zionist
  language for the occupied West Bank. In effect, Oslo pitted a stateless people
  against two nuclear-armed states led by people who were fundamentally invested
  in Jewish supremacy in Palestine. Emmanuel Macron’s decision to recognize a
  Palestinian state in September amounts to little, as Donald Trump noted. I do
  not know Macron’s intentions, but the Palestinians have never really warmed to
  European and American condescension, which is implicit in every conditional
  statement, every contingent incrementalism. Mark Carney’s strange, confused
  statement that Canada would only accept a “Zionist Palestinian state” is
  grimly entertaining for anyone with a basic grasp of the issues. Anyone who
  isn’t a dilettante, in other words. Now, in the midst of a genocide, the
  Palestinians are best served by abandoning any effort to attain self-rule in
  the Occupied Territories. A reorientation towards basic rights is overdue,
  along with recognition the Palestinian struggle was never really about a seat
  at the United Nations, representation in Unesco, or Fifa. The force of the
  Palestinian cause rests in one principle: justice. Two years ago I thought
  justice meant a single state with equal rights between the River Jordan and
  the Mediterranean Sea. But now, the Palestinians are confronted by a
  difficulty: no one is able to articulate what justice means in the wake of so
  much slaughter, of so many dead men, women and children, dead babies. The
  genocide has changed my perspective on the majority of Jewish Israelis, and
  once they retire their guns and mortars – as one day they surely will – we
  will have to reckon with the moral, and actual, wreckage of their century-long
  Sturm und Drang, their violent ejaculations, in Palestine. Ahmed Moor is a
