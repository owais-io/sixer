  The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, will boycott King Charles’s state
  banquet held in honour of Donald Trump to protest against the US president’s
  failure to intervene decisively to end the war in Gaza. Davey, who is invited
  to the dinner for Trump’s state visit to the UK, said to turn down an
  invitation from the king went against all his instincts and that it was a
  deeply serious move to refuse to attend. But he said he feared unless he took
  a stand over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the lack of pressure on
  Israel from the US government, no one would raise the issue during the
  president’s visit in late September. Davey said: “Boycotting the state banquet
  is not something I ever wanted to do, but I believe it is the only way I can
  send a message to both Donald Trump and Keir Starmer that they cannot close
  their eyes and wish this away.” Trump’s state visit is an honour that has
  never previously been extended for a second time to a US president. Davey said
  he believed Keir Starmer was right to engage with Trump, but said it was vital
  that someone raised the issue of Gaza in a way that could not be ignored. “The
  humanitarian crisis in Gaza must stop. The famine must end. The hostages must
  be returned home. There is one man, more than anyone else, who has the power
  to make it happen,” he wrote in a Guardian piece explaining his decision.
  “Donald Trump could do those things today if he chose to. He has more power
  than anyone else finally to force a ceasefire and put Israel and Palestine on
  the path to a lasting peace, with a two-state solution. But so far, he’s
  decided not to. Instead, he’s given Netanyahu his full support.” Davey said
  the invitation to state banquets was “one of the great privileges of being the
  leader of my party”. He said: “Receiving an invitation from the king is an
  enormous honour, and I take very seriously my duty to our sovereign. “To
  refuse an invitation like this goes against all of my instincts. But having
  thought and prayed long and hard about it with Emily [Gasson, Davey’s wife], I
  have come to the conclusion that on this occasion I must refuse.” Davey said
  although he deeply disagreed on many issues with Trump, including on Ukraine,
  his engagement with Vladimir Putin and his use of tariffs, his decision to
  boycott the dinner was purely a stand on Gaza. “I think Keir Starmer is right
  to engage with him – although I do wish he was tougher with Trump on
  everything from tariffs to Putin,” he said. “I fear we could have a situation
  where Trump comes to our country, is honoured with a lavish dinner at one of
  our finest palaces, and no one reminds him that he has the power to stop the
  horrifying starvation, death and captivities in Gaza. And no one uses this
  moment to demand that the US president picks up that phone to Netanyahu and
  the Qataris and does the right thing.” Davey said the war in Gaza was now
  causing such acute suffering he was determined to use every lever he could as
  an opposition leader. “I feel a responsibility to do whatever I can to make
  sure the people in Gaza are not forgotten during the pomp and ceremony. To
  make sure the UK makes Donald Trump’s personal responsibility for securing
  peace in Israel and Palestine an issue.”
