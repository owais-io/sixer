  Sprint sensation Gout Gout is already the fastest Australian to have run the
  200m, and Usain Bolt has described the 17-year-old’s appearance “like young
  me”. While he’s beginning to catch up with Bolt’s times, the teenager is also
  catching up to the towering Jamaican in height. Gout’s running style has an
  uncanny resemblance to Bolt’s, with long strides and an upright stance
  supporting his ability to reach a high top speed, even if he continues to work
  on his starts. There has always been a large difference between the pair’s
  heights, however. Bolt is 1.95m – or 6ft 5in – and had reached that mark by
  the age of 15. Gout has been slower to grow, but could still add more height
  to his gangly frame. The year 12 Ipswich Grammar student was measured at
  180.3cm at the end of last year, but as he prepares to race at the World
  Championships in Tokyo, he is now close to 183cm. His coach Di Sheppard had
  noticed the change earlier this year when returning from the Stawell Gift.
  “When we got out of the car and were walking in the airport, I turned around
  and I felt like I had to look up more. I looked at him and went, ‘you’ve
  grown’. He looked at me like, ‘yeah, right’,” the long-time junior athletics
  coach said. “I’ve never been wrong yet, even when mothers tell me they
  haven’t, I tell them to go home and measure their kid.” Sheppard wonders
  whether her star student can grow more, given his father Bona is still taller
  than him and he has unusually long arms. “Gout didn’t really hit early
  puberty, he didn’t really start a maturation, probably, until about 15 more
  so,” she said. “And if you look at Gout, when he puts his arms out, his arm
  span is just way too big for the rest of him.” Sheppard has been cautious not
  to overload Gout’s growing body with too much strength work too soon, even if
  stronger legs will eventually mean faster starts. “We’ll move into that when
  we can add that with some power, so it’s not about really trying to force it,
  because, I mean, he’s 17, and he’s still growing,” she said. “It’s a
  step-by-step-by-step process, so when you hit one mark, [you say] ‘OK, we’ve
  got those, we can get out of the blocks in our first two steps’. We know his
  top end speed’s there, but you don’t drop that to work on this, you gradually
  improve this [his start] to match that [his speed].” Gout will make his debut
  for Australia’s senior national team at the 2025 world championships, starting
  next week in Tokyo.
