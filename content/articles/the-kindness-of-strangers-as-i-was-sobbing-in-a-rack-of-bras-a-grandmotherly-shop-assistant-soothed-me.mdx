  shop assistant soothed me

  I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2019 and immediately had to have a
  single mastectomy. Told by the doctors I needed to wear very soft bras for a
  while, two months after the surgery I went to my local department store to
  find something suitable. I was hobbling around and feeling really awful about
  myself – sore, sad and scarred, and as though I’d never look attractive again.
  Somewhere deep in the racks of bras I became so overwhelmed by it all that I
  just broke down and started sobbing. Around the corner came a petite,
  grandmotherly shop assistant. She put down everything she was holding, walked
  over and asked me if I was OK. Through tears, I explained how hacked up and
  completely daunted I felt. She took both of my hands, let me sob a bit and
  then told me: “I know it doesn’t feel like it now, but it will all be OK
  eventually.” She gave me some tissues to tidy myself up, helped me find some
  bras, and off I went. Six years later, I went back to the same store. I was
  getting married, and needed a bra to go under my wedding dress. To my surprise
  and delight, my fitter was the same woman: Margaret, whose strong South
  African accent jogged my memory. I told Margaret how amazing she was to me
  that day six years ago – and she remembered me! We were both a bit tearful,
  hugged again and once again she helped me find a bra. It felt like coming full
  circle. I later wrote to the store to tell them what a wonderful employee they
  have. With no drama and no fuss, Margaret had known exactly how to soothe me
  in my moment of distress. Of course, Margaret had been absolutely right all
  those years ago – everything was, eventually, OK. The mastectomy got rid of
  all the cancer, sparing me the need for any radiation or chemotherapy. My
  partner and I got married last month and it was a wonderful celebration of how
  great life can be. And the bra Margaret helped me pick out for the big day was
  just perfect. What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you? If
