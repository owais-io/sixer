  utter nonsense

  In January 2019, news outlets across the world reported that the actor Jussie
  Smollett had been the victim of a particularly vile and disturbing hate crime.
  Smollett – who was, at the time, best known for his leading role in Fox’s
  music drama Empire – had been set upon in the early hours of the morning in
  his Chicago neighbourhood by two white men who had racially and homophobically
  abused him (Smollett is gay and mixed race). During a bitter cold snap in the
  city, the men had poured bleach on him and even tied a noose around his neck,
  while declaring they were in “Maga country”. The resulting deluge of support
  for Smollett is recounted in the opening of this documentary, with even Donald
  Trump describing the attack as “horrible … it doesn’t get any worse”. These
  days, Smollett is no longer best known for his role on Empire but for his
  participation in what is widely understood to have been a hoax, organised by
  the actor and carried out for a fee by two acquaintances, brothers Akimbola
  (Bola) and Olabinjo Osundairo (Ola). The idea the Osundairos – who are of
  Nigerian heritage – had perpetrated a fake white supremacist attack made the
  case into instant meme fodder, while subsequent legal proceedings saw Smollett
  charged with having staged the whole thing. But is that what really happened?
  The Truth About Jussie Smollett? – a 90-minute documentary from the makers of
  such Netflix hits as The Tinder Swindler – teases the possibility of something
  more sinister. It asks whether the actor was the victim of a conspiracy at the
  heart of the city’s criminal justice system, that turned him from victim to
  perpetrator. It’s bold, it’s shocking – and it’s utter nonsense. Things start
  out convincingly enough, with testimonies from senior figures from the Chicago
  police department. They outline the facts of the case, as well as the
  inconsistencies that troubled them. Or, as the then-superintendent Eddie
  Johnson puts it, why would anyone have left their home “when it’s cold as
  shit?” Smollett had bought a sandwich, a meal that survived the attack (we see
  CCTV footage of him walking back into his apartment building with a Subway bag
  in his hand). It wasn’t conclusive, but it seemed – at the very least – odd.
  Rider data from Uber led the police to the Osundairos, aspiring actors who –
  conveniently – had flown to Nigeria the day after the attack. Footage of
  Smollett crying during a TV interview is juxtaposed with that of the police
  apprehending the brothers on their return to the US. We meet them in the
  present day – Ola is spaced out, while Bola modestly describes himself as “an
  all-round great human being”. Being hired to beat someone up was, they say,
  the sort of thing they assumed happened all the time in Hollywood. Plus, they
  allege, the idea was to give Smollett a leg-up in becoming an activist. For
  his part, Smollett is interviewed throughout, looking morose as he relays his
  version of events to camera. He insists a cheque he made out to the brothers
  was actually payment for fat-busting herbal steroids they would procure for
  him back in Nigeria, and says his life descended into a game of “whack-a-mole”
  in the face of rumours and lies. The Osundairos ultimately avoided any
  criminal charges. Smollett, meanwhile,drafted in a lawyer whose client list
  reads like a roll call of the most problematic public figures of our time,
  including Andrew Tate and Chris Brown. He was written out of Empire, then
  reached a plea deal with the city of Chicago that involved him sacrificing his
  bail money and doing community service. But then he was tried again and sent
  to jail, only for a court to find it unlawful that he was tried twice on the
  same charges and decide to overturn his conviction. This, arguably, is where
  The Truth About Jussie Smollett? should end – but it just keeps going,
  becoming increasingly icky and irresponsible. The final act is given over
  almost entirely to talking heads Abigail Carr and Chelli Stanley, who weave
  conspiracy theory and conjecture together as they claim the Chicago police
  framed Smollett. After all, two eyewitnesses were given short shrift by the
  police, and there’s some grainy footage where the suspects look as though they
  could, maybe, be white. We are told, too, about the police’s worrying record
  on race (quelle surprise), and the fact that Johnson (who is black) was fired
  for misconduct. It feels more than a little problematic to link Johnson –
  fired for drinking on the job – with a plot to purposely incriminate Smollett
  and the Osundairos while letting two hypothetical white criminals off the
  hook, and there is no evidence here to say that was what happened. Stanley is
  a freelance journalist who has written a handful of articles on Smollett,
  while Carr is a British TV documentary producer. How they came to be
  authorities on the case is never explained, and their contributions feel far
  too lightweight to justify the screen time given to them. (The credits reveal
  that both are consultant producers.) The final revelation is that Bola and Ola
  have written a tell-all book: cue some blooper-style scenes of them trying to
  remember what it’s actually called. The implication seems to be that the
  brothers have exploited their brush with infamy for financial gain, and thrown
  Smollett under the bus. But, really, a programme like this has no business
  taking the moral high ground at all. • The Truth About Jussie Smolllett? is on
