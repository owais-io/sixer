  The young, single mother of a six-year-old was proud of the progress she had
  made. Jasmine Williams, 29, had struggled with an opioid addiction for years.
  In March 2021, Williams was caught by federal agents with illegal drugs and
  later that year pleaded guilty to federal charges in New Mexico. During her
  sentencing hearing, Williams expressed optimism for her future. Yes, she would
  serve time in federal prison. But once her sentence was up, she would go back
  to school to pursue her passion and become an esthetician. Williams, known by
  family and friends for her big laugh and kindness, achieved sobriety in the
  lead-up to her sentencing – and prosecutors recognized her progress. With no
  significant criminal background, US government officials recommended that she
  receive a reduced sentence. According to her sentencing transcript, accessed
  by the Guardian, Williams promised the judge she would “make better decisions
  and go to school, and make a name for myself in a career that I actually
  enjoy, and take care of my daughter and set a better example for her”. The
  future was brighter. Her mother, Tonya Petrides, shared that outlook. “When
  you have a child who has struggled with addiction, you worry about them all
  the time,” Petrides said in an interview by phone from her home in Ohio. “She
  was getting better, so I wasn’t worried about her because she was getting
  better. She was optimistic. We had a plan.” Two days after her sentencing,
  Williams turned herself in to the US Marshals Service (USMS) to begin her
  sentence and was booked into the Cibola county correctional center (CCCC), a
  privately owned federal facility in New Mexico. The Cibola facility, run by
  the private prison company CoreCivic, houses USMS and local detainees, along
  with immigrants in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) custody. It has a
  problematic track record. An investigation by the Guardian has revealed that a
  disturbing number of deaths have been occurring at the prison, which is also
  under scrutiny by the FBI for what the agency has called an epidemic of drug
  smuggling there. Williams is included in the death toll. Cibola was only
  supposed to be a temporary stop for Williams, who would then be transferred to
  a prison in Ohio to be closer to her mother and daughter. But two days after
  being booked into Cibola, on 14 November 2021, Williams was found dead in her
  cell. A medical examiner report obtained by the Guardian shows she died of an
  overdose – toxic effects of methamphetamine, fentanyl, codeine and morphine.
  But circumstances surrounding her death were unclear. When local officers
  arrived to investigate her death, they found “the scene was compromised”, a
  report by the Milan police department – the local police department called to
  respond to Williams’s death – says, because Williams’ body had already been
  placed in a body bag and tagged. And weeks later, despite lawyers’ requests to
  preserve evidence, security footage of Williams’s last hours alive had been
  deleted by CoreCivic’s camera system, according to emails from CoreCivic
  attorneys quoted in a wrongful death lawsuit. “She never even got to start her
  sentence. It was a death sentence. Basically Cibola became her executioner,”
  Petrides said. “ I foolishly thought that because she was in what was supposed
  to be a facility where people were being paid to take care of her, that she
  was safe. And she was not.” Cibola is supposed to be a secure facility,
  contracting with the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security, with a
  stated zero tolerance for contraband. Deaths are supposed to be an anomaly.
  But at Cibola, Williams’s death is one of many, the Guardian has found in an
  exclusive investigation. Since 2018, at least 15 people detained at the Cibola
  facility have died, according to numerous documents including local police
  reports, 911 call records, New Mexico medical investigator reports, wrongful
  death lawsuits and a video from inside the facility. The deaths include at
  least 10 suicides, two overdoses, two deaths from prior health problems and
  one “undetermined” death, as stated in the hundreds of pages of documents
  gathered by the Guardian. However, last fall, CoreCivic pitched the facility
  to the Department of Homeland Security as an ideal location to detain more
  immigrants, according to documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties
  Union (ACLU). Around that time, coincidentally, the FBI launched an
  investigation into a network of gangs smuggling drugs and contraband into the
  facility, in September 2024. An FBI special agent described in an affidavit a
  “drug trafficking epidemic” at the prison and even alleged that some corrupt
  CoreCivic guards worked with the gangs to introduce contraband into the
  facility. Although the FBI investigation has primarily focused on smuggling
  into the units holding USMS and local county detainees within Cibola, further
  reporting by the Guardian reveals that drug smuggling and consumption have
  been occurring in the Ice units, too. The revelations come amid an increase in
  contracts for CoreCivic under the Trump administration, including for federal
  immigration facilities. In response to a request for comment, CoreCivic, a
  publicly traded company based in Tennessee and operating across the US, sent a
  statement. “At all our facilities, including the Cibola County Correctional
  Center (CCCC), the safety, health and well-being of the individuals entrusted
  to our care and our dedicated staff is our top priority. This commitment is
  shared by our government partners,” the company said. The statement continued:
  “Our facilities have trained emergency response teams who work to ensure that
  any individual in distress receives appropriate medical care, and we are
  deeply saddened by and take very seriously the passing of any individual in
  our care. Any death is immediately reported to our government partners and
  investigated thoroughly and transparently.” The Department of Homeland
  Security, which oversees Ice, has denied any drug smuggling is taking place
  inside the Ice units at Cibola, saying any such allegations are false. But the
  prison is operating under a cloud of suspicion. By relying on hundreds of
  pages of federal and local law enforcement documents, along with court
  records, medical reports and interviews, the Guardian has uncovered shocking
  allegations of mismanagement, corrupt guards, drug smuggling and medical
  neglect. These allegations focus chiefly on the units not used for Ice
  detention, but additional reporting indicates that the Ice units are not
  immune from drug smuggling and associated violence. CoreCivic did not respond
  to requests by the Guardian for comment for this investigative series
  specifically relating to allegations of drug smuggling involving areas where
  Ice detainees are held, although it acknowledged drug problems in the wider
  facility and confirmed it had been cooperating with the FBI’s investigation.
  But in an interview, one man detained in one of the Ice units, whom the
  Guardian is not naming to protect his safety, said he had been a witness to
  drug smuggling, purchasing and consumption within his unit. Meanwhile,
  multiple experts the Guardian spoke with considered the death toll at Cibola –
  15 deaths in seven years, from 2018 to 2025 – to be alarmingly high,
  considering the facility’s capacity to hold only about 1,129 people. Last
  year, the justice department’s inspector general released a report documenting
  federal Bureau of Prisons (BoP) institutions with high death rates. Although
  CoreCivic challenges any direct comparisons, if Cibola were a government-run,
  BoP facility, its death rate would land it among the worst performers.
  “CoreCivic struggles to keep CCCC operating in a safe and efficient manner,
  confronting many of the same issues that face other correctional facilities
  nationwide,” an FBI affidavit relating to the agency’s investigation of drug
  smuggling at the prison reads. “The quantities of drugs seized are
  exceptionally large, given that they are located within a secure federal
  facility.” The high number of detainee deaths at the facility that the
  Guardian has reviewed included only one, high-profile death of an Ice
  detainee, in 2018. Advocates are shocked at the toll. “ There have been a
  remarkable number of deaths for such a small facility,” said Laura Schauer
  Ives, a civil rights attorney representing Williams’s estate in an ongoing
  lawsuit in a New Mexico federal court against CoreCivic. “CoreCivic has done
  this work for decades, but they’ve failed and continue to fail their most
  basic duties – and those include keeping drugs out of the facility and keeping
  people in their custody alive.” Williams’s wrongful death lawsuit was filed
  earlier this year, so there have been limited filings from CoreCivic attorneys
  in the case so far. In one filing, though, CoreCivic said that the company was
  “obligated to follow medical care instructions and directives issued by USMS”,
  including medical care directives concerning Williams. The company also said
  that its management of the facility was “monitored, inspected, and approved”
  by the US government, including the justice department, “who ensured that
  CoreCivic Defendants’ staffing pattern and qualifications conformed to
  requirements established” by the US government. CoreCivic has denied
  wrongdoing in the civil cases it has faced. Meanwhile, the company said it
  could not provide the Guardian with specific comments related to Williams’s
  case or other deaths that have taken place at Cibola because of ongoing
  lawsuits and past settlements. Tracking down statistics and details of deaths
  that have taken place at Cibola is challenging. According to an internal USMS
  policy document accessed by the Guardian through a Freedom of Information Act
  request, the federal law enforcement agency does not investigate deaths of
  people in its custody; it relies on local law enforcement agencies to carry
  out that work and only conducts a “preliminary review”. The USMS also does not
  publicly announce inmate deaths within its detention network. In contrast, Ice
  publishes a press release and launches an internal investigation into deaths
  of people in its custody. To establish a total for the period in question, the
  Guardian accessed local police reports, medical investigator reports, and
  lawsuits to cross-check and document the number of deaths. “CoreCivic is paid
  lots and lots of money to do this [detention work]. And unfortunately,
  CoreCivic appears to be operating with profit in mind and not the community
  interest,” Ives said. “ It’s in everybody’s interest that anybody in that
  facility is treated with basic decency. And it’s in everybody’s interest that
  people in that facility do not have access to [illicit] drugs. And it’s in
  everybody’s interest that people are not dying. And yet it persists, and
  they’re continuing to house people there to this day.” Cibola became the
  subject of scrutiny in 2018 due to Roxsana Hernández’s death. Hernández was a
  transgender asylum seeker from Honduras who died after being held at Cibola
  while in Ice custody. CoreCivic’s response to her death investigation was
  eerily similar to Williams’s – in both cases, CoreCivic’s system had deleted
  video footage of their last hours alive. According to records obtained by the
  Guardian, Hernández has been the only Ice detainee who has died at Cibola –
  the other 14 who died there had been in the custody of the USMS or local
  officials. The Guardian found that the suicides were overwhelmingly of people
  who hanged themselves in cells. Federal facilities have policies in place to
  prevent suicides and self-harm and, according to the Cibola contract,
  CoreCivic staff are required to regularly check on detainees suffering from
  mental illness, specifying that those who are deemed suicidal need to be
  “under constant observation”. “I don’t understand why Congress hasn’t taken
  any action. I don’t understand why taxpayers put up with this,” said Parrish
  Collins, a civil rights attorney based in New Mexico who specializes in prison
  conditions and represents prison staff whistleblowers who sound the alarm
  about prison conditions. Collins is representing the estate of James Ramirez
  in a wrongful death lawsuit against CoreCivic and the local hospital that
  treated him, after the 28-year-old’s death in USMS custody at Cibola following
  an alleged delay in calling for an ambulance when he was injured from
  repeatedly collapsing in a medical observation cell. Company lawyers in a
  court filing have denied all liability and wrongdoing and speculated that
  Ramirez may have been “under the influence of drugs or alcohol” the day before
  his death. Because the lawsuit is still ongoing, CoreCivic said it could not
  comment on Ramirez’s specific case. Meanwhile, in February of last year, two
  brothers were sharing a cell at Cibola when tragedy struck. One of the
  brothers, Dominic, was continually sleeping, facing withdrawal symptoms for
  his opioid addiction. And according to a local police report, his brother,
  Isaac, had been using crystal meth and “acting strange”. According to the
  police report, at one point three other inmates arrived at the cell to offer
  Isaac drugs that had been smuggled into the facility. But they found Isaac
  dead by suicide, his brother asleep next to him. Dominic woke up to the
  traumatic chaos of guards and medical staff trying and failing to revive his
  brother, the local police report said. The facility has faced allegations of
  mismanagement, understaffing and a lack of oversight. Multiple wrongful death
  lawsuits have been filed in the New Mexico federal court against CoreCivic,
  including for two other deaths by suicide, those of Justin Krantz and Zachary
  Asher. CoreCivic has denied allegations of wrongdoing. Krantz and Asher, 36
  and 31 years old, respectively, both took their own lives in their cells,
  according to lawsuits that claim that CoreCivic failed to properly monitor
  them despite signs they were suicidal. Court filings in both cases show that
  CoreCivic attorneys denied that the company and its employees’ practices were
  responsible for their deaths. Both cases were later settled. Ramón Soto, a
  civil rights attorney in New Mexico, who represented Krantz’s estate and also
  worked on Asher’s case during their wrongful death lawsuits, said that due to
  alleged medical neglect and easy access to drugs, those entering Cibola with
  substance abuse issues or mental illness find their problems are exacerbated
  once inside the facility. “That’s when suicidal ideations skyrocket,” Soto
  said. Williams’s and Ramirez’s wrongful death lawsuits continue to be
  litigated. The USMS did not respond to a detailed request for comment for this
  series. “I think it’s irresponsible for the government to keep giving them
  money,” Soto said, adding that CoreCivic may see wrongful death lawsuits and
  any related settlements as a “cost of business”. The company disagrees,
  calling such a characterization “deeply misguided and offensive”. “Every death
  is a serious matter that demands thorough investigation, accountability and,
  most importantly, a commitment to prevention,” CoreCivic said in response to a
  request for comment. “The health and safety of every individual in our care is
  not optional – it’s a core responsibility. Our focus remains on doing
  everything possible to prevent these events from happening in the first place
  through training, oversight and continuous improvement in our standard of
  care.” The trauma for family members endures. According to Petrides,
  Williams’s mother, she found out about her daughter’s death because another
  inmate at Cibola contacted a loved one after finding their number in
  Williams’s cell. It was not until six hours later that CoreCivic finally
  called Petrides to give her the news of her daughter’s death, without any
  further insight as to how she died. The USMS never contacted her. “Had she
  been able to do her time and get out and be successful, she could have maybe
  helped people in her situation, because she did have a very kind heart,”
  Petrides said. “I want [CoreCivic] to understand that people are not for
  profit. They are important. And I do not want this to happen to anybody else’s
  daughter.” Next week: part 3 of the Guardian investigation into the Cibola
  county correctional center • In the US, you can call or text the National
