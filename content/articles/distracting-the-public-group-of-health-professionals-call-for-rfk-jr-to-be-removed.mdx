  removed

  A grassroots organization of health professionals has released a report
  outlining major health challenges in the US and calling for the removal of
  Robert F Kennedy Jr from the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
  The report from Defend Public Health, a new organization of about 3,000 health
  professionals and allies, is an attempt to get ahead of misinformation and
  lack of information from health officials. In an effort to keep making
  progress in public health, Defend Public Health’s report was slated to
  coincide with that of the anticipated second US report to “make America
  healthy again” (Maha). The first Maha report was released in May, and a second
  report was expected this week – but amid turmoil at the health agencies, it
  has reportedly been delayed for several weeks. “The Maha report is essentially
  a distraction from the real causes of poor health,” said Elizabeth Jacobs,
  professor emerita at the University of Arizona and a founding member of Defend
  Public Health. “This administration does not want to address things like
  poverty and education and access to healthcare. Instead, they’re distracting
  the public with information on solutions to problems that don’t actually
  exist. When the foundation of your policy is not evidence-based, it will
  collapse.” The Defend Public Health report diverges from the previous Maha
  focus on issues such as processed foods and environmental chemicals, but it
  covers familiar ground in public health. The group highlights the importance
  of food safety, security and access to food, including through the
  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), and improved opportunities
  for physical activity. They seek to ensure equitable access to vaccines;
  expand access to healthcare, including comprehensive sexual and reproductive
  healthcare access; and build strategies for clean air. The report also
  recommends fully funding scientific research and public health systems;
  combatting scientific misinformation, including from the US government; and
  strengthening pandemic preparedness. They call for reductions in gun violence,
  now the number one cause of death for children. And their last recommendation
  is to remove Robert F Kennedy Jr, secretary of the US Department of Health and
  Human Services (HHS), from office, calling his removal “the single most
  important step toward improving the health of Americans”. The recommendations
  are exactly what the US needs to address to become healthier, said Georges
  Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association (APHA).
  If you “look at the things that actually kill people, from the 10 leading
  causes of death, that is indeed the right list”. The US spends twice as much
  on healthcare as the next industrialized country, despite having poorer health
  outcomes, Benjamin pointed out. “The fracturing of our healthcare system
  undermines the accessibility of healthcare,” Benjamin said before noting that
  the US also spends less than other countries on the social determinants of
  health and social supports, and invests less in primary care and prevention.
  Such gaps are getting worse under the second Trump administration, with huge
  cuts to Medicaid, affordable housing and nutrition programs like Snap. “If
  they’re serious about making America healthy again, I would suggest that we
  first begin by feeding children,” Jacobs said. “When, for example, RFK Jr is
  talking about food dyes, I don’t think that that is anywhere near as important
  as the fact that 13 million children in the United States do not know where
  their next meal is coming from.” Scientific misinformation is an “existential
  threat” to Americans, and the US government is a “major source” of
  misinformation and disinformation now, Jacobs said. The first Maha report
  “contains misinformation and uses references that don’t even exist”, she
  noted. The Defend Public Health report has a tongue-in-cheek note that it was
  “created by real human experts relying on real rigorous data”. Jacobs
  recommended working with social media companies, “one of the biggest
  amplifiers of misinformation”, to address the spread of harmful information.
  Educating children on how to evaluate the quality and accuracy of information
  is also important, she said. But one of the biggest purveyors of health
  misinformation is Kennedy himself. “Everything that he is doing is
  horrifying,” Jacobs said. “There is a saying in public health, ‘saving lives a
  million at a time’, and he is doing the opposite of that.” She called him a
  “genuine threat” who was “devastating” public health. “He has no knowledge,
  training or experience in any type of science. He’s never done an experiment,
  he’s never written a paper, he’s never gotten a grant to study anything. He
  has no understanding of the underlying causes of poor health in the United
  States,” Jacobs said. Defend Public Health launched in November, after Trump’s
  re-election because, as Jacobs said, “it was very clear to us that public
  health specifically was going to be under attack. “We knew that it was going
  to be a tough fight. I don’t think that any of us knew how bad this was going
  to get, how quickly. But we are doing everything in our power to support our
  fellow researchers, public health workers, anybody that we can, and also
  continue to get accurate information out to the public,” Jacobs said. The
  group joins other established health organizations as well as other newcomers
  like the Vaccine Integrity Project to serve as reliable sources of
  information. There’s a long history of groups like these providing outside
  perspectives on official recommendations, Benjamin said. But the federal
  government is uniquely positioned to speak to the health of all Americans.
  “Pediatricians certainly have the nation’s trust around vaccines for kids, but
  there’s a big debate about at what point does a kid become an adolescent,
  become an adult? At what point do they go into the adult health system?” he
  said. That creates confusion around which advice a patient should follow. The
  same may be true of a patient who becomes pregnant, or someone who may fall
  under the purview of multiple health organizations. It’s not always easy to
  know who belongs in which group. “We have to be careful that each of these
  private sector organizations align our recommendations, so that we don’t
  further confuse the public,” Benjamin said. Yet, Benjamin continued, “as the
  federal government withdraws in its responsibility to protect the public,
  groups like ours will become more influential in filling that void until we
  can get the federal government again to step up into that place as a trusted
  adviser.” Benjamin and Jacobs – and other experts in these groups – hope that
  the federal government will once again become a source of reliable
  information. “We really wanted to start building a framework so that we’re
  ready when we have the opportunity to start putting some of our policy
  recommendations in place,” Jacobs said. “There is just rampant chaos right now
  around public health and science related to this administration, and we have
  got to stand firm and keep bringing the conversation back to the actual causes
  of poor health among Americans. I can’t control what the government is going
  to decide to do. What we can do is continue to provide accurate information to
  the public.”
