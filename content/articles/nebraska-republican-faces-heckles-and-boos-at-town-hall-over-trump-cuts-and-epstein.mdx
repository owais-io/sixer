  A Republican congressman from Nebraska faced boos, chants of “vote him out”
  and questions about the Trump administration’s handling of the Jeffrey Epstein
  sex-trafficking investigation files. In what could be a preview of what
  Republicans up for re-election in the 2026 congressional midterms might face,
  Mike Flood was consistently heckled throughout the town hall. He also faced
  questions about immigration, cuts to Medicaid, and Donald Trump’s firing of
  the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner Erika McEntarfer after a July
  employment report that was worse than expected and job growth numbers that
  were revised downward by 285,000 for the two previous months. Flood claimed he
  supports releasing the Epstein case files as well as the effort to subpoena
  Ghislaine Maxwell – Epstein’s convicted, longtime associate – in front of
  Congress. “I don’t know what the situation was with [McEntarfer]. Neither do
  you,” Flood said. “I don’t know. I don’t know. “I can tell you – I’ve been an
  employer for a lot of years, and there’s always two sides to every story, and
  I don’t know what that side was. I will say this, though, if all that person
  did was get the data out there, if all that – and I don’t know that’s the case
  – but if that’s all they did, I would not have fired her.” Nebraska’s
  Democratic party had encouraged voters to attend the town hall in the state’s
  capital of Lincoln. In response to a question about the budget bill championed
  by Trump that cut Medicaid by a historic $1tn, Flood responded: “I truly
  believe that this bill will allow America to experience growth, that it will
  allow our communities to thrive, that it will spark our economy, that it will
  help farmers and ranchers, that it will take care of the vulnerable. And more
  than anything, I truly believe this bill protects Medicaid for the future.” He
  then dismissed calls to “tax the rich”, claiming they create jobs. “From my
  standpoint, when I say I protected Medicaid, I feel like it,” Flood said. “If
  you have a vulnerable loved one that’s on Medicaid, and they find it’s harder
  to continue their services, to get their free healthcare, and they clearly
  need it, that was not what I voted for. “If we have to make tweaks to the
  implementation to make sure that those who truly need it get it and it is not
  a burden to their caregiver or them, then we need to make those tweaks.” Those
  who attended Flood’s town hall jeered and criticized him vociferously,
  including by saying he supported fascism. “Fascists don’t hold town halls with
  open question-and-answer series,” Flood replied. Flood was first elected in
  2022 and won a second term in November. He succeeded Jeff Fortenberry, a
  Republican incumbent who resigned after a felony conviction for lying to
  federal authorities about an illegal campaign donation from a foreign
  national.
