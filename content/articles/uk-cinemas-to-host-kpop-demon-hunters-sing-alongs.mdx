  Younger audiences will be singing their hearts out in cinemas across the UK
  this month as KPop Demon Hunters arrives on the big screen for a series of
  special sing-along events. The unexpected Netflix hit, which has become the
  most popular animated film of all time on the streaming platform, has hooked
  children (and many parents) worldwide since its release in June. The film’s
  soundtrack, meanwhile, is dominating the charts with more than 3bn global
  streams so far and the song Golden reaching No 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100
  chart and the UK’s official singles chart. The official video has been viewed
  on YouTube more than 130m times. KPop Demon Hunters follows the adventures of
  the girl group Huntr/x, made up of Rumi, Mira and Zoey, who use their secret
  identities as demon hunters to protect their fans from supernatural threats
  and face off against a rival band, Saja Boys, whose members are secretly
  demons. Tickets are on sale for the screenings across the UK on 23 and 24
  August. Netflix confirmed similar events will be available in the US and
  Canada on the same weekend. Along with demand for a sequel, there is also an
  insatiable demand for its merchandise, with Hunter/x T-shirts, hoodies and
  hats among the bestselling items on Netflix’s website. Maggie Kang, the film’s
  Korean-Canadian co-director, previously said she and her co-director, Chris
  Appelhans, had wanted the film’s music to be “really incredible and really
  speak to the K-pop fans and legitimately fit into the K-pop space”. In
  contrast, Hollywood animation is having a lacklustre summer at the box office
  and it is possible that not a single fully animated film will make the top 10.
  The Disney-Pixar original Elio has been trounced by “live-action” remakes of
  Lilo &amp; Stitch and How to Train Your Dragon.
