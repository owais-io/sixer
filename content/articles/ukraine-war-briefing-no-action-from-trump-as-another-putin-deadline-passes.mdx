  Donald Trump took no apparent action at the passing of his latest deadline for
  Vladimir Putin to come to the negotiating table with Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He
  was “very disappointed” in the Russian ruler, and was planning on “doing
  something to help people live”, said the US president, without any specifics.
  He was speaking on the radio show of Scott Jennings, a US conservative pundit.
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Tuesday that Russia was engaged in a new troop
  buildup in certain sectors of the frontline and still launching strikes on
  Ukrainian targets. “Now we see another buildup of Russian forces in certain
  sectors of the front. [Putin] refuses to be forced into peace … Russia
  continues to launch strikes. Of course, we will respond to this,” said the
  Ukrainian president in his nightly address. European allies are ready to
  contribute to postwar security guarantees for Ukraine and waiting for tangible
  American support, Emmanuel Macron’s office said on Tuesday. The French
  president and the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, are due on Thursday to
  jointly chair a meeting of the “coalition of the willing”. The French foreign
  minister, Jean-Noel Barrot, and his US counterpart, Marco Rubio, had a phone
  call on Tuesday. The US “backstop” sought by the coalition could involve
  intelligence, logistical support and communications. Sergei Lavrov, the
  Russian foreign minister, has repeated the well-worn Kremlin line that any
  peace deal must recognise “new territorial realities” – referring to Russia’s
  illegal occupation of Ukrainian territory – and Moscow’s demand that it
  somehow be part of postwar “security guarantees” to Ukraine despite being the
  invader. Lavrov said he expected talks between Russian and Ukraine to
  continue. Vladimir Putin has refused bilateral talks with Ukraine’s president
  that Trump promised to organise. Ukrainians paid tribute to prominent
  politician Andriy Parubiy as he was buried on Tuesday after being gunned down
  in a daytime attack on Saturday, the second assassination in the western city
  of Lviv in just over a year. Ukrainian police, who have detained the alleged
  gunman, said on Monday they suspected Russian involvement. In courtroom
  footage, the alleged assassin, a Ukrainian man, admitted to shooting Parubiy,
  a 54-year-old sitting lawmaker, and described it as “my personal revenge”
  against the state. The suspect said he wanted to be included in a prisoner
  exchange with Russia to find the body of his son, a Ukrainian soldier who was
  killed, adding that he had not been recruited by Moscow for the murder. A Lviv
  court has put the man in custody for 60 days pending investigation. Russia
  launched a sweeping overnight air attack on Ukraine, injuring at least four
  railway workers in the central region of Kirovohrad and prompting Poland to
  scramble defence aircraft, Ukrainian and Polish authorities said on Wednesday
  morning. Air raid alerts sounded for hours across Ukraine, with explosions
  heard in nine of its 24 regions, from Kyiv to Lviv and Volyn in the west,
  Ukrainian officials and media said. Nato member Poland activated its own and
  allied aircraft to ensure safety, its armed forces command said, posting: “The
  Russian Federation once again is carrying out strikes on targets located on
  the territory of Ukraine. Five people were injured and 28 houses damaged in
  the Znamianka community in the region of Kirovohrad, Ukraine’s emergency
  services said. Public transport in the western city of Khmelnytskyi faced
  “significant schedule disruptions” after the attack, its administration said,
  with the regional governor flagging fires and damage to residential buildings
  among others. About 2,000 North Korean soldiers are estimated to have been
  killed fighting for Russia against Ukraine, according to South Korean
  intelligence. In April, the South’s national intelligence service “said the
  number of war dead was at least 600. But based on updated assessments, it now
  estimates the figure at about 2,000”, lawmaker Lee Seong-kweun told reporters
  after a briefing from the spy agency. Lee said the intelligence service
  believed Pyongyang planned to deploy another 6,000 soldiers and engineers to
  Russia and 1,000 had already arrived. Ukraine will never agree to legalise the
  Russian occupation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and an immediate
  withdrawal of Russian troops is the only way to guarantee safety, the
  Ukrainian foreign ministry has said. Vladimir Putin said in China that Moscow
  was ready to cooperate with the US at the plant, seized in the first weeks
  after Moscow’s February 2022 invasion. “The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant
  is and will remain an integral part of the sovereign territory of Ukraine. Any
  attempts by Russia to question this fact are legally null and void and
  politically pointless,” the Ukrainian foreign ministry said. Ukraine boosted
  its electricity exports by 60% from July to August despite its power system
  being under continued drone and missile attacks by Russia, the Ukrainian ExPro
  consultancy said on Tuesday. ExPro provided no explanation; market sources
  said long, sunny days have allowed more solar power to be produced. Ukraine
  exported power mostly to Hungary and some to Moldova.
