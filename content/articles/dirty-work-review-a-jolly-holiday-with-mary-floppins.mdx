  We’ve all felt the urge to impose order on the mess of our lives, whether that
  mess is literal or emotional. It’s both in Jessica Barton’s new clown show,
  which won her the best newcomer gong at Melbourne’s comedy festival. Dirty
  Work finds Barton in bonneted and buttoned-down guise as Mary Floppins, here
  to tutor us in tidiness – and sweep away her own demons to boot. If her
  near-namesake could put a room to rights with just a snap of her fingers and a
  catchy song, Barton does so, be warned, with the participation of her
  audience. Specifically men, who are most in need of her housework advice. This
  is one of those shows, then, that derives its comic charge from putting
  members of the public through their paces on stage. It’s one of those shows,
  too – there are many under the clown banner – where repetition and doe-eyed
  charm are deployed to pad out simple visual routines to the brink of their
  natural lifespan. But at least Barton has that charm in spades, and a fine
  disciplinarian line too, that can keep an errant volunteer in line with just a
  peremptory flash of the eyes. And so her stooges ascend the stage to fold
  bedsheets with her, separate clean and filthy linen, and perform a dance
  derived from routine domestic chores. There’s a singalong skit too, in which
  Barton shows off her Julie Andrews-alike pipes. Presently, a strand is
  introduced into Dirty Work suggesting that our host’s mania for neatness is
  linked to a bad breakup, of the kind that might lead you to, say, hurl your
  partner’s possessions out of the house and into chaotic disarray on the
  street. In an entirely silent show, this hinterland is glimpsed but not
  explored on an upstage screen, while back in the here and now, we’re left
  watching two volunteers laboriously tidy Barton’s stage. At such moments, it
  can feel like the show’s ideas have been stretched fairly thinly to fill this
  fringe hour. But no denying that, as host and performer of this paean to
  pristine, Barton brings a befitting sparkle and shine. At Underbelly Cowgate,
  Edinburgh, until 24 August All our Edinburgh festival reviews
