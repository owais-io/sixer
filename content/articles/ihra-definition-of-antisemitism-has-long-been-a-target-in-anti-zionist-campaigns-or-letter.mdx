  In his open letter to the acting president of Columbia University (I spent
  decades at Columbia. I’m withdrawing my fall course due to its deal with
  Trump, 1 August), Rashid Khalidi announces that he will not teach his
  scheduled course in the fall term, “specifically […] in light of Columbia’s
  adoption of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition
  of antisemitism”. The IHRA definition, Khalidi explains, “deliberately,
  mendaciously and disingenuously conflates Jewishness with Israel, so that any
  criticism of Israel, or indeed description of Israeli policies, becomes a
  criticism of Jews”. The IHRA is an intergovernmental body with a mandate to
  address contemporary challenges related to the Holocaust and genocide of the
  Roma. It has 35 member countries, including every member of the EU except
  Malta. So this is a serious allegation. But what does the IHRA definition
  actually say? Prof Khalidi does not quote a sentence of it, and perhaps we can
  see why. It says that “criticism of Israel similar to that levelled against
  any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic”. But the following
  “could, taking into account the overall context” qualify as antisemitic:
  “denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination”, “requiring of
  [Israel] a behaviour not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation”,
  “using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism to
  characterise Israel or Israelis”, “drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli
  policy to that of the Nazis”, or “holding Jews collectively responsible for
  actions of the state of Israel”. It must be obvious to Prof Khalidi that these
  things are sometimes antisemitic. No doubt, antisemitism and anti-Zionism are
  sometimes tendentiously conflated. Equally, antisemitism is sometimes cloaked
  in political discourse or mixed with political criticism, and that is what the
  IHRA calls out. Denying that this happens is absurd. Here, for example, is the
  Hamas charter: “In their Nazi treatment, the Jews made no exception for women
  or children. Their policy of striking fear in the heart is meant for all. […]
  The Zionist Nazi activities against our people will not last for long. […] The
  Zionist plan is limitless. After Palestine, the Zionists aspire to expand from
  the Nile to the Euphrates. When they will have digested the region they
  overtook, they will aspire to further expansion, and so on. Their plan is
  embodied in the ‘Protocols of the Elders of Zion’.” The IHRA definition has
  been a target in anti-Zionist campaigns for years, in the same way as Black
  Lives Matter became a target for the right during Donald Trump’s first term. A
  question about how to recognise antisemitism has been weaponised by
  anti-Zionists, just as antisemitism is weaponised by some on the Israeli
  right. John Hyman Grote chair in philosophy of mind and logic, University
  College London Anthony Julius Chair of law and the arts, University College
