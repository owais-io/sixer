  Keir Starmer has sought to play down warnings that the government will be
  forced to raise taxes this autumn and said some of the figures being
  circulated “are not ones I recognise”. The prime minister was responding to
  forecasts from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR),
  which projected a shortfall of up to £51bn in the public finances, given a
  number of factors had knocked the chancellor’s plans to stay within Whitehall
  spending limits, including higher debt interest payments and U-turns on
  welfare spending cuts. NIESR said “moderate but sustained” tax rises would be
  needed in the autumn budget for Rachel Reeves to overcome the deficit of
  £41.2bn and then restore a near £10bn buffer in the current budget or be
  forced to use harsh cost-cutting measures in the autumn statement. Speaking
  during a visit to Milton Keynes, Starmer disagreed with the economists’
  warnings. “Some of the figures that are being put out are not figures that I
  recognise, but the budget won’t be until later in the year – that’s when we’ll
  have the forecast and set out our plans.” He added the government’s focus
  would remain on raising living standards and he sought to reassure voters they
  would “feel better off” under Labour. “That means more money coming into
  people’s pockets in the first place through better wages, and bearing down on
  costs like mortgages and other pressures on families,” Starmer said. “In the
  autumn, we’ll get the full forecast and obviously set out our budget,” he
  added. “The focus will be living standards, so that we will build on what
  we’ve done in the first year of this government. We’ve stabilised the economy.
  That means interest rates have been cut now four times. “For anybody watching
  this on a mortgage that makes a huge difference on a monthly basis to how much
  they pay. “In the first year, we’ve raised wages as well, both in the private
  sector plus the minimum wage, which means people have got a bit more money
  coming into their pocket, and so at this stage that will be set out in the
  budget, but the focus will very much be on living standards and making sure
  people feel better off.” Prof Stephen Millard, NIESR’s deputy director for
  macroeconomics, said: “Things are not looking good for the chancellor, who
  will need to either raise taxes or reduce spending or both in the October
  budget if she is to meet her fiscal rules.” Labour is under pressure to spell
  out how it will balance the books without breaking its pledges, including a
  commitment to not raise the rates of income tax, VAT or national insurance.
  The NIESR report has fuelled concerns over whether the government will
  introduce a wealth tax, or which taxes Reeves may consider raising. There is
  speculation about an extension to the freeze on income tax bands and a cut to
  the current cash Isa limit. The culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, ruled out a
  wealth tax on Tuesday. She told Sky News: “The chancellor has very much poured
  cold water on that idea, partly because many countries have tried this sort of
  approach, but mostly because we were elected as a government in a time when
  taxes on working people were at their highest rate for generations.”
