  When George Clooney brought Good Night, and Good Luck to the stage earlier
  this year, it set a record for the highest-grossing play in Broadway history.
  Clooney, making his Broadway debut, was nominated for a Tony award for his
  portrayal of Edward R Murrow, a giant of broadcast journalism. But for diehard
  fans of the original 2005 film of the same name, which was made in response to
  US involvement in the Iraq war, something was missing. In that version, Murrow
  was played by David Strathairn, one of the US’s most perceptive, subtle and
  compelling character actors. Why did he not reprise the role on stage? “I was
  much too old and it would have been hard to actually pull it off that many
  years later,” Strathairn, 76, cheerfully admits via Zoom, his spectacles
  pushed up to rest on still-lustrous white hair. “Hats off to him [Clooney] for
  getting it to Broadway. The play would be an amazing part of a curriculum at
  schools of broadcast journalism or political science. I would hope that they
  would mount it to give some perspective.” Strathairn’s latest role is that of
  a grandfather who fought in Vietnam long ago. In A Little Prayer, a family
  drama written and directed by Angus MacLachlan, he plays the patriarch of a
  tight-knit but unravelling family in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Bill finds
  a kindred spirit in his daughter-in-law, Tammy (Jane Levy), but suspects his
  son (Will Pullen) is having an affair with a co-worker. Strathairn was drawn
  to the project because of MacLachlan’s writing, having seen his previous works
  Junebug and Abundant Acreage Available. He says: “His focus was such a frank
  and sincere and generous looking into a family, a small little tight world
  with its own particularities and peculiarities and how it was done with very
  gentle, kind of simple but also a very compassionate approach. I love that.
  “No big bells and whistles. Obviously this family is going through some issues
  that are fairly potent and have a lot of resonances and a lot of banana peels
  for that family to slip on. But how they navigated that landscape in the story
  when I read the script, I thought, was quite alluring to me and I thank him
  for asking me to be in it.” MacLachlan’s small but flawless diamond of a movie
  is an empathetic, never-judgmental study in how hard marriage and parenting
  can be. It is also not incidental that both Bill and his son are military
  veterans. Bill has imported an ingrained stoicism and “need-to-know basis” to
  family life; his son has PTSD. In one scene, Bill talks with other men who
  served in Vietnam and discusses a comrade who struggled to reintegrate into
  civilian life. Strathairn has spent time with the military during his work
  with Theater of War Productions, which uses theatre – often dramatic readings
  of ancient or modern plays – as a springboard for community conversations in
  military bases, prisons, hospitals and other venues. He reflects: “That
  experiential reality is always there and so it was there in Bill but there’s a
  whole aesthetic that you don’t talk about it, you don’t bring it home. That
  informs there’s a lot of stuff going on inside everybody in this household and
  we got to bring it out because, in order to deal with it, you’ve got to talk
  about it.” A Little Prayer wears its politics lightly. There are nods to the
  opioid epidemic, the stigma around abortion, the plight of military veterans
  and the unglamorous nature of blue- and white-collar work in small southern
  towns long neglected by elites. In clumsier hands, the film might have put on
  a Maga hat and tried to explain the rise of Donald Trump. But MacLachlan’s
  playing field is more modest and, as a consequence, delivers something more
  profound. Strathairn adds: “It presents PTSD, it presents abortion and drug
  abuse and the struggles that everybody has dealing with things like that, and
  puts it in a very sincere and equitable level. You can’t really land on, oh,
  this is a movie about that or this is a movie about that. This is a movie
  about human experience and I hope that’s why it’s striking a chord, ringing a
  bell for a lot of people in a positive way.” Strathairn’s career has also
  included taking on a number of historical characters such as Murrow (he
  describes his Oscar nomination as “a little bit of icing, but the cake was
  actually the making of it”), Robert Oppenheimer, William Seward and John Dos
  Passos. He also recently took on Jan Karski, a Polish soldier, resistance
  fighter and diplomat during the second world war, best known for his efforts
  to inform the western allies about the Holocaust. Strathairn has performed
  Remember This: The Lesson of Jan Karski, a one-man show devised by the
  Laboratory for Global Performance and Politics at Georgetown University in
  Washington, at venues in the US and Europe including Poland itself. Is there a
  difference between playing fictional and historical characters? Strathairn
  reflects: “The responsibilities, the duties there are different. With a guy
  like Bill you get a lot more different choices in which way to go. But when
  you’re doing someone like Murrow or Karski and you have as much reference
  material as possible, it’s your challenge and responsibility to honour the
  legacy of who they were as much as possible. “Hopefully you look a little bit
  like them – that helps – but still, when you’re given these kind of challenges
  to represent or depict a historical character that everybody could go and
  research, it keeps you in the lane. With historical characters it’s important
  not to reconfigure or reinvent. It’s our responsibility just to be a conduit
  as much as possible.” The responsibility may be even greater in the era of
  Donald Trump, who has launched an all-out assault on cultural institutions,
  universities and knowledge itself, seeking to divide the US rather than unite
  it. The president has seized control of the John F Kennedy Center for the
  Performing Arts in Washington and ordered a review of Smithsonian Institution
  museums, complaining that there is too much emphasis on slavery. Strathairn
  believes artists have a more crucial function than ever, saying: “One thing
  that we were talking about on a set recently was, does it fall to the arts, of
  all forms, to be our historians now? If they’re going to get rid of
  revisionist history about what they want it to be, saying about the Black
  experience, the Native American experience, the LGBTQ experience, all of these
  things that are part of the museum of our life, of our history, if those
  things are going to be thrown in the dustbin, who is going to preserve that
  history? “It seems to us it’s going to fall to film-makers and novelists and
  those who are doing television series and documentaries and poets and writers
  and painters. Because this phenomenon of the creative arts has always been
  that: to reinvestigate, interpret but present and reflect on everything that
  makes up our human experience. “Then what if we are not allowed to do a play
  or a film or tell a novel or story that deals with something that’s contrary
  to the present regime? People are on tenterhooks about it, all the way from
  the mega studio down to the poet, from the people who hold the levers of
  entertainment down to the street musicians. What’s going to happen? What is
  happening? It’s something that needs to be reckoned with.” Trump’s efforts to
  police language, influence media narratives and reshape culture have invited
  comparisons with the Soviet Union or other regimes from history. Does
  Strathairn believe his country is sliding into authoritarianism? “I don’t know
  if there’s another word for it but it’s certainly a whitewash according to one
  particular aesthetic and kind of horrific,” he says. “I mean education – what
  are you going to do if you don’t educate? You’re going to forget and you’re
  going to be completely vulnerable to whatever agenda is in the hands of those
  who are controlling it. “Let’s hope that the present regime doesn’t say, OK,
  we’re only going to make movies about this and we’re going to clamp down on
  streaming services. Who knows? Authoritarianism is a very frightening concept
  when it comes to the arts. But so many towns have their own little film
  festivals and the curiosity is still there and the desire for that form of
  information, that form of entertainment, that form of escape. You can’t kill
  that. Artists will always find a way.” In 2006, Strathairn reprised his role
  as Murrow in Decency, a campaign ad for then Democratic congressional
  candidate Kirsten Gillibrand. He did not catch the recent Broadway run of Good
  Night, and Good Luck. But despite time’s arrow, he is still more than capable
  of channeling the spirit of Murrow and delivering a rallying cry for freedom
  of speech as a human imperative. He continues: “We can keep making potent
  little films like A Little Prayer or Nomadland or Good Night, and Good Luck or
  anything that is sincerely and frankly and with equanimity making people feel
  like we are neighbours, we can relate, that your problems are my problems and
  the stuff that divides us is flimsy and shouldn’t divide us. “What film can
  do, what theatre can do, what the arts can do is bring a lot of people
  together in one place – people from all different walks and beliefs and
  ethnicities and everything and say, man, we’re all together in this. It’s like
  what Karski says: governments have no souls; individuals have souls; and the
  common humanity of people is the real protector of human rights. We have to
  take care of each other and that’s critical today in terms of what’s happening
  out there.” A Little Prayer is in US cinemas on 29 August with a UK release to
  come
