  The European Commission will present a plan this autumn to significantly boost
  high-speed rail travel in Europe, the bloc’s transport commissioner has said,
  promising a “long-term vision for a more connected, efficient and competitive
  network across Europe”. Apostolos Tzitzikostas, the EU’s transport
  commissioner, said the project would involve the “coordinated planning,
  financing and implementation” of high-speed rail infrastructure and of rolling
  stock that could operate across national borders. The EU is determined to
  build genuine “passenger-centred, attractive and affordable rail services”, he
  said, with faster lines and smoother cross-border rail travel considered
  crucial to the bloc’s competitiveness and climate goals. “Ultimately, people
  will choose the train not just because it is more sustainable but because it
  is the more comfortable, faster and more affordable option for long-distance
  travel in Europe,” Tzitzikostas said. “That is our direction of travel.”
  Long-distance rail travel in Europe has long suffered from poor coordination
  and connectivity, with different line gauges, rolling stock specifications,
  operating technologies and signalling systems hampering cross-border links. A
  survey published last month suggested that three in four EU citizens would
  prefer to take a high-speed train instead of a plane if connections between
  capitals and major urban areas were fast and reliable. But according to a 2021
  report by the commission, rail accounted for less than 10% of cross-border EU
  travel. With a 90% fall in transport emissions part of the blueprint for the
  bloc’s pledge of climate neutrality by 2050, getting more people on to trains
  is vital: Amsterdam to London by train, for example, saves 93% of carbon
  dioxide over the same journey by plane. But cash-strapped national operators
  tend to prioritise domestic services. New infrastructure – and trains capable
  of operating across borders – are expensive. While new routes have opened and
  others are on the way, for most Europeans, the plane is faster on most
  journeys. The commission has previously set a goal of doubling high-speed rail
  traffic from 2015 levels by 2030, and trebling it by 2050, via a proposed
  49,400km, €546bn (£476bn) high-speed rail network connecting all EU capitals
  and major cities at speeds of 250km/h (155mph) or more. Tzitzikostas said his
  new plan would help achieve that goal, which was attainable if “we address
  systemic bottlenecks”. The issue was not just more EU money, he said, although
  rail would be a major beneficiary of a 100% boost to the transport
  infrastructure budget. “We need a coordinated financing approach, combining
  the best use of EU funding, national support and private investment,” he said.
  But new high-speed lines – and improved existing ones – would not be enough on
  their own. “It’s also about ensuring that infrastructure is used effectively,”
  Tzitzikostas said. “Making sure new operators can access the market, that new
  standardised rolling stock is available, and that the network is managed as a
  single system, with similar operating rules and conditions.” Connectivity is
  not the only issue. As well as being faster, air travel is often cheaper – and
  easier to book. A 2023 Greenpeace report which assessed 112 European routes
  found that trains were, on average, twice as expensive as planes. T&amp;E, a
  transport and clean energy advocacy group, says air travel is artificially
  cheap mainly because all parts of the sector – from airports through plane
  manufacturers through to airlines – are subsidised by local, regional,
  national and EU authorities, while airlines are exempt from paying tax on
  their fuel and VAT on their tickets. Cross-border train passengers dream of
  the seamless through tickets available to flyers. European train operators
  share little ticket information with each other or with booking platforms,
  forcing passengers to buy multiple separate tickets. While EU plans for a
  single booking system met with resistance, Tzitzikostas said the EU was now
  working to make ticket-buying easier by ensuring all operators and vendors
  could access ticket sales platform and improving passenger rights. Without
  smoother rail connections, lower prices and one-stop ticketing, air travel
  still has the edge. But if rail can deliver a “comfortable, affordable,
  easy-to book service”, passengers will respond, Tzitzikostas insisted. “More
  are choosing high-speed rail already – not just because it’s more sustainable,
  but because it’s better.” At present, though, national priorities “do not
  always align with European ambitions”, due in part to domestic pressure on
  resources, he said. Interoperability was also a real challenge: “Trains still
  face too many ‘borders’ within Europe. All this will close collaboration, and
  funding.” The substantial investment needed to complete a European high-speed
  network by 2040, the commission’s target, would necessarily involve
  “innovative funding and financing mechanisms”, he said: “After all, return on
  investment here is entirely predictable.” Referring to the airline sector,
  Tzitzikostas said the commission’s goal was to “build a fairer and more
  sustainable level playing field – allowing people to make climate-friendly
  choices, but also keeping mobility accessible and affordable for all”. Next
  year’s launch of a direct 11-hour Prague-Berlin-Copenhagen service, however,
  showed just how strong the demand for high-speed rail travel now was, he said
  – and would only increase as assorted lines under construction would almost
  halve the journey time. “I am naturally an optimist, and I’m also a train
  guy,” he said. “I’m already picturing the day when someone can have lunch in
  Vesterbro in Copenhagen, step on a train, and arrive for dinner in Wenceslas
  Square, next door to Prague central station.”
