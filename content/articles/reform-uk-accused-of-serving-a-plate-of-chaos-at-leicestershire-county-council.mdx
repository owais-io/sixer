  A Reform UK-led county council has served its residents a “plate of chaos”
  from the start of its leadership, according to its Conservative opposition,
  after its 22-year-old deputy leader was removed three months into the job.
  Joseph Boam, elected in May as a Reform councillor for Leicestershire county
  council, had also been stripped of his cabinet brief for adult social care and
  communities, said the leader of the Leicestershire Conservatives, Deborah
  Taylor. The Guardian understands that Boam was removed because of a clash with
  the council’s Reform leader, Dan Harrison, stemming from differences of
  opinion. Despite this, Boam said “nothing’s changed” and vowed to keep
  fighting for his constituents and for Nigel Farage to become prime minister.
  Taylor said the Reform administration had “lacked leadership and direction
  from the very start” and accused it of delivering instability, poor judgment
  and “revolving-door appointments”. “The Reform administration at
  Leicestershire county council has lacked leadership and direction from the
  very start,” Taylor said. “So it comes as no surprise to us that councillor
  Joseph Boam has been shown the door after just three months as deputy leader
  of Leicestershire county council and cabinet lead member for adults. “Frankly,
  he was wholly unqualified for such a critical role and lacked the experience
  or judgment to bring anything of value to the position. “Adult social care and
  communities is one of the most important and challenging portfolios in local
  government. It requires steady hands, long-term commitment and a depth of
  understanding. What it has been given instead is instability, poor judgment,
  and revolving-door appointments. “At a time when Leicestershire needs
  stability, vision, and experienced leadership more than ever, residents are
  being served a plate of chaos. Reform promised change, what they’re delivering
  is a shambles.” A Reform UK source said: “Joseph deserves thanks for his role
  in helping to establish the Reform group at Leicestershire county council and
  we wish him well as he moves into a new role where he will continue to support
  the group’s efforts at County Hall.” Reform won 25 out of the 55 seats on the
  council and formed a minority administration after the local elections in May,
  seizing control from the Tories. Boam was not the youngest Reform councillor
  with a senior county council position. In Warwickshire county council,
  19-year-old George Finch is leader.
