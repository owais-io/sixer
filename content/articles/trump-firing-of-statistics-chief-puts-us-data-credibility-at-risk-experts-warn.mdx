  Donald Trump’s firing of the head of the main agency for producing jobs
  figures risks propelling the US into the same category as countries notorious
  for “cooking the books” such as Argentina and Greece, experts have warned.
  Trump fired Erika McEntarfer, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
  commissioner last Friday, after accusing her agency of “faking” the latest
  employment figures for “political purposes”, which showed the US economy
  adding a lower-than-expected 73,000 jobs in July. The BLS, the US government
  official source for labor statistics since 1884, also revised down the
  estimates of new positions created in May and June by a combined 258,000.
  Trump provided no evidence for his accusations against McEntarfer, which he
  reinforced in social media posts on Monday, calling the bureau’s latest
  reports “rigged” and concocted. But his decision jeopardizes the US’s
  tradition of impartial and reliable statistic collection on which the
  country’s economic stability and international reputation depends, specialists
  have told the Guardian. Erica Groshen, McEnterfer’s predecessor as BLS
  commissioner during Barack Obama’s presidency, warned earlier this year that
  an impending civil-servant rule change that presaged last Friday’s sacking
  could usher in a “politicization” of government statistical bodies – whereby
  experts are pressured to produce massaged numbers that fitted an incumbent
  president’s agenda. She raised the specter of Greece and Argentina, where
  official statistics became discredited as a result of government-instigated
  misrepresenting of figures. The International Monetary Fund stopped accepting
  the Argentinian government’s inflation figures in 2013 after officials were
  found to have deliberately understated the rate for the previous six years.
  After threatening Argentina – historically one of the IMF’s biggest borrowers
  – with expulsion, the organization did not extend another loan to it until
  2018. In the case of Greece, government statisticians were accused of having
  made inflation and soaring budget deficits “disappear” in the 1990s as the
  country sought respectable-looking numbers that would enable to qualify for
  the single European currency, the euro. Greece subsequently joined the
  currency, but at an exorbitant long-term price. The 2008 global financial
  crash plunged its economy into a deep recession, and the government was forced
  to accept multi-billion dollar bailouts from the IMF and European Union – at
  the cost of painful cuts to social services. Andreas Georgiou, who became head
  of Greece’s main statistics agency during the crisis, even faced prosecution
  after he discovered that authorities had been dramatically understating budget
  deficits for years. Both countries experienced severe political backlashes. In
  Argentina, after two further IMF loans failed to stabiliize its economy,
  Javier Milei, a populist economist and ally of Trump, was elected in 2023
  promising to take a chainsaw to the governing bureaucracy and many public
  services. In Greece, a succession of left and rightwing governments have taken
  office amid a rise in support for radical and populist parties, giving rise to
  concerns for the health of the country’s democracy. Talking to the Guardian,
  Groshen warned of comparable scenarios following a rule change rolled by the
  White House’s office of personnel management in April. “Bureau of Labor
  Statistics leaders could be fired for releasing or planning to release jobs or
  inflation statistics unfavorable to the president’s policy agenda,” she wrote
  in a briefing paper. The revision altered the category of about 50,000
  permanent civil servants to “policy/career” status, making their removal
  easier. Originally tabled in April to allow 30 days for comments, it gave
  agencies the right “to expeditiously remove career employees in
  policy-influencing positions for poor performance or misconduct, such as
  corruption or for injecting partisanship into the performance of their
  official duties”. The precise roles of officials affected were not defined,
  but Groshen pointed out that, if implemented, the president would determine
  who would be reclassified. The change stemmed from an executive order Trump
  issued on his first day back in the White House on 20 January. It stated that
  the power of “policy-influencing” civil servants is “delegated by the
  president, and they must be accountable to the president”. Groshen, now a
  specialist in government statistics at Cornell University, said the changes in
  civil servant status would make it easier for the government to tamper with
  numbers it disliked. “There are a number of changes to the civil service that
  makes it much easier for the administration to interfere with the activities
  of statistical agencies and that worries me,” she said. Under increased threat
  of removal, civil servants in federal statistics bodies “might also face
  pressure to change methodologies or reveal pre-release information”, she
  wrote. “By making it easier to remove employees if a president determines that
  they are interfering with his or her policies, it increases the potential for
  passivity or political loyalty to be prioritized over expertise and
  experience.”
