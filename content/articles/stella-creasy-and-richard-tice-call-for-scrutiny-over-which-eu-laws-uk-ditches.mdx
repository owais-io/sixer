  Stella Creasy and Richard Tice are pushing for Labour to allow a Brexit
  scrutiny committee to be formed in parliament, after the Guardian revealed
  environmental protections had been eroded since the UK left the EU. The Labour
  and Reform UK MPs argue that there is no scrutiny or accountability over how
  Brexit is being implemented. Creasy, the MP for Walthamstow and chair of the
  Labour Movement for Europe, said the UK needed a “salvage operation” to clear
  up the environmental and regulatory havoc caused by Brexit. The analysis by
  the Guardian and the Institute for European Environmental Policy (IEEP) has
  found that since Brexit the EU has brought forward 28 new, revised or upgraded
  pieces of environmental legislation that the UK has not adopted, and the UK
  has actively chosen to regress by changing four different pieces of
  legislation including on protected habitats, pesticides and fisheries. Creasy
  said the prime minister, Keir Starmer, needed to move more quickly to repair
  relations with the EU and realign on environmental law. “I am working with
  Richard Tice as well as other Brexit sceptics on restoring some sort of
  European scrutiny committee in parliament so we can decide if and when we want
  to diverge rather than it all being passive,” she said. Creasy said: “We don’t
  have a body in parliament that knows both UK and EU law and can forge a way
  forward. This data from the Guardian and IEEP makes the case for having a
  scrutiny committee looking at if we diverge, and if we strengthen or weaken
  environmental protections. MPs aren’t scrutinising this at all at the moment;
  they don’t even know about what’s going on.” One major issue is the planning
  and infrastructure bill, which overrides the EU’s habitats directive and
  allows rare habitats such as chalk streams to be destroyed if developers pay a
  nature restoration levy to government. Chris Hinchliff, the MP for North East
  Hertfordshire, had the Labour whip removed for proposing amendments to the
  bill, including one to protect chalk streams from harmful development. Creasy
  said she supported Hinchliff and that the UK should not be regressing from EU
  law. She said: “I signed Chris Hinchliff’s amendments as I think he was right
  to bring these issues to the fore. There are good reasons to be concerned.
  Nobody wants to be the dirty man or woman of Europe, do they?” Starmer and the
  chancellor, Rachel Reeves, have consistently pitted the environment against
  growth, blaming bats and newts for a lack of housebuilding. Creasy said this
  was wrong: “There is no trade-off between the environment and growth; you can
  do both.” She added that Labour had made some positive steps towards
  realigning with the EU: “Under the Conservatives they were pushing very hard
  for isolation and they were saying there were benefits to have separate
  regulatory regimes as if pollution would stop at a border. It doesn’t. The UK
  and EU reset deal is very clear about the climate crisis and the existential
  threats we face and that is encouraging.” There was now less of a fear of
  joining in with Europe and adopting good policies that the bloc came up with,
  Creasy said. “The Tories wouldn’t even join the European biosecurity alerts
  because it had the word ‘European’ in, when there was foot and mouth in France
  they didn’t even want to know. We are over the hump of saying because it’s
  European then we couldn’t possibly do it. But now we need to scrutinise this
  Guardian and IEEP data and find the way forward.” She said she was relaxed
  about working with Reform MPs, even though their views are diametrically
  opposed to hers: “Richard Tice and I can disagree over the benefits of
  alignment but we can both agree that parliament should examine these issues.
  Tracking environmental regulation has fallen to external bodies … no one’s
  checking or holding the government to account.” Brexit campaigners said
  leaving the EU would allow the UK to “take back control”, but the UK has not
  decided on what to do about EU environmental directives and instead has
  passively fallen behind. For example, the EU has banned dozens of harmful
  chemicals under its Reach programme, while the UK’s new chemicals regulator
  has yet to ban a single one. “Brexit has not led to parliament taking back
  control,” Creasy said. “We aren’t actively making decisions on divergence.
  Those conversations aren’t happening.” Creasy thinks the UK should
  “dynamically align” with the EU, which means automatically adopting its
  environmental standards while reserving the right to reject some if they do
  not work for the UK. This means there would be less pressure on UK regulators
  to keep up, and it would also be helpful for trade, she believes. “I’ve always
  been someone who supports the business case and the business case is you align
  by default unless there is a really good reason for why we shouldn’t,” Creasy
  said. “Since leaving the EU we have only actively chosen to diverge on a
  handful of things, but we have passively diverged on a lot.” She added: “We
  need to say: can we align, how do we do that, why does it matter? We need a
  salvage operation because Brexit has been so damaging to our environment –
  there is no time to waste. We need to fight for the thing which will save the
  planet, which is to work with our nearest neighbours as quickly as possible.”
  A government spokesperson said: “There are many areas of our environmental
  protections, like banning bee-killing pesticides, closing sand eel fisheries,
  restricting bottom trawling in sensitive marine areas, where the UK’s approach
  is truly world leading. There is more to do, and we need to unlock growth and
  promote nature’s recovery. Through initiatives like the nature restoration
  fund, our approach secures lasting improvements for nature and helps fix the
  failed status quo of time-intensive and costly processes to support the
  building of 1.5m new homes.”
