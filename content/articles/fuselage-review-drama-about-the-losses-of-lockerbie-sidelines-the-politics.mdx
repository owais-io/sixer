  At the start of her autobiographical three-hander, writer-performer Annie
  Lareau claims that news reports of atrocities focus on the wrong thing. She
  says they are always about nations and leaders and never about the people
  directly affected. Fuselage shows that there is a good reason for this: human
  interest stories (of which there are a lot) tend to tell you only that people
  get sad when sad things happen. Just like this play. Imagine if there had been
  an episode of the TV series Fame in which the writers had decided to get
  serious. As well as following a group of drama students in their quest for
  stardom, they would include a global terror incident. The downing of Pan Am
  flight 103 over Lockerbie, for example. This is the setup for Fuselage. It is
  a routine story of student life – classes, crushes and clashes – brought to a
  halt by the bombing of the plane on 21 December 1988. Had Lareau been able to
  afford to change her ticket, she would have joined 35 classmates from Syracuse
  University on the fated flight. Where previous Lockerbie dramas, such as Des
  Dillon’s Lockerbie 103 and David Benson’s Lockerbie: Unfinished Business, have
  found their anger in causes and cover-ups, this one talks nebulously of
  “terrorists” and presents the death of Lareau’s fellow students, including her
  best friend Theodora Cohen, not as a matter of wider public concern but as a
  personal outrage. It is astonishingly devoid of politics. Lareau suffered a
  devastating loss and the emotional toll must have been unbearable, but the
  play’s lack of context, barring some scene-setting clips, turns a globally
  significant attack into something small and private. Makaela Milburn’s
  production, also starring Peter Dylan O’Connor and Brenda Joyner, manipulates
  the audience into empathetic sobs and changes nothing. At Pleasance Courtyard,
  Edinburgh, until 25 August All our Edinburgh festival reviews
