  La Liga begins again in Girona on Friday evening, a five-day weekend to start
  it off, and for the first time the division’s biggest clubs, every side
  competing for the title, share a vital weapon: they all have Englishmen in
  their team. Trent Alexander-Arnold, just Trent now on his No 12 shirt, has
  joined Jude Bellingham at Real Madrid. Nine players have left Atlético Madrid,
  but Conor Gallagher isn’t one of them. Marcus Rashford has landed in
  Barcelona, 39 years after Gary Lineker. And Oviemuno Ejaria has just signed a
  two-year deal at Real Oviedo. Or, if you prefer your obvious jokes to have a
  slightly different bias, another team for the punchline, Tyrhys Dolan has
  joined Espanyol. Ejaria is the last in, a three-week trial convincing the
  coach, Veljko Paunovic, to give him an opportunity at a club returning to the
  first division 24 years later, joining on the same salary as teammate Santi
  Cazorla: the €195,000 (£168,100) minimum wage. Alexander-Arnold was the first,
  two months ago and on 75 times more having arrived for free until Madrid
  decided they needed him at the Club World Cup and spent €10m to get him an
  early release. Dolan’s arrival intrigues. But Rashford is likely to command
  the most attention this weekend. If, that is, he plays. If he does not, his
  will not be the only absence. Not among the Englishmen – Bellingham has
  finally had an operation on his shoulder and will be out for a couple of
  months – and probably not among Barcelona’s new signings either. Like Dolan
  and Ejaria, like more than 50 players across the league, Rashford has not yet
  been registered, a familiar summer story. Many, but not all, should have their
  paperwork completed in time; Barcelona, who have always found a way to
  eventually get their players registered, hope they will too. For some of their
  signings, at least. “I’m calm; I trust that the club will sort it out,”
  Rashford said at the start of August as he headed off on pre-season, a new
  opportunity. “I’m just concentrating on training and getting in good shape to
  start the competition.” Two days before his team do in Mallorca – and two
  weeks before the market closes, margin to balance books – he was still
  waiting. And if he was confident, part of the reason he has arrived in
  Catalonia is that not everyone felt the same way. Barcelona wanted to sign
  Nico Williams, meeting his €58m buyout clause at Athletic Club, but they could
  not guarantee he would be registered in advance. Rashford was more affordable,
  less demanding and a player they long admired. Rashford’s arrival brings
  variety and versatility. Able to play in any of the positions across the front
  – “my favourite position is on the left … but [it’s] a bit of everywhere
  really” – he offers cover for Lamine Yamal, Raphinha and Robert Lewandowski,
  who is a week from his 37th birthday. That addresses a feeling that last
  season they found few alternatives – Ferran Torres apart – to a front three
  that was superb but also had to play huge amounts of minutes; that perhaps
  paid for it in the end. Across a whole campaign, that could be significant.
  Yet in the short term, Rashford’s registration was not Barcelona’s most
  pressing, immediate priority. On Wednesday night, none of their summer
  signings had yet been cleared by the league’s strict financial fair play
  rules, including Joan García, the goalkeeper signed for €25m from Espanyol, or
  Wojciech Szczesny, the story of last season and any season. Convinced to come
  out of retirement to win every domestic title, Szczesny has now been convinced
  to stay on as a sub. As Marc-André ter Stegen is injured, Barcelona face going
  into the opening game with just one available goalkeeper: Iñaki Peña, who has
  not played a minute in pre-season. Ter Stegen’s injury, though, was more a
  solution than a problem: if his injury could be judged to be long term,
  Barcelona will be able to “use” up to 80% of his salary to register another
  player, which would be García. That had been the source of conflict: Ter
  Stegen, seemingly wishing to avoid facilitating his own replacement, refused
  to authorise the release of his medical details to the league committee making
  the judgment. Stripped of his captaincy, he eventually backed down, had the
  armband returned and even gave the speech before Barcelona’s club’s
  traditional season curtain raiser – played at the training ground because the
  Camp Nou is not ready, another deadline missed. On Wednesday night, the
  league’s commission confirmed that they considered the injury long term;
  Barcelona immediately announced the registration of García, another obstacle
  overcome. That night Joan Laporta admitted he couldn’t be sure that they would
  get everyone registered for the start of the season but that they were working
  on it. In the end, with the club waiting on the auditors’ clearance of the
  sale of VIP seats at the new stadium and a sponsorship deal with the
  Democratic Republic of the Congo, with departures still to be confirmed, he
  and his board may need to put up personal bank guarantees. Yet if the summer
  has been difficult off the pitch, missed amid the drama is a steady
  strengthening, and on it has been different. While there will be a defensive
  balance to attend to, Hansi Flick expressing frustration at how they let the
  Inter semi-final escape them last season, Barcelona have continued to blow
  everyone apart, scoring at five a game in pre-season. “You see how good they
  were last year but they have that motivation and determination to improve,”
  Rashford told The Rest is Football podcast. “They won so many trophies but
  everyone has forgotten about that now.” At the end of the previous campaign,
  Lamine Yamal said: “I told my mum there’s another Champions League next year.”
  Which might not be a promise, exactly, but almost. Which won’t be easy,
  either; in Europe or domestically, even if Lamine Yamal is just about the most
  exciting player around, handed a new contract, the No 10 and the future. Real
  Madrid have spent €200m, their biggest outlay in six years, but they have not
  really had a pre-season, playing only one game since the Club World Cup. The
  enthusiasm for the structural shifts seen at that tournament was hit hard by
  their destruction at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain, Xabi Alonso quick to
  say that match belonged to last season, not this. Shifting a culture is not
  simple, combining Vinícius Júnior and Kylian Mbappé doesn’t appear to be
  either, and there is still a gap in the middle of their midfield, which they
  are trying to fill with Arda Güler adapting to a new role. Meanwhile Álex
  Baena, the outstanding player outside the big three last season, creating more
  chances than anyone, has joined their rivals across the capital and he didn’t
  come alone. Atlético have spent €175m, a second summer in a row of heavy
  spending, demanding a challenge that lasts into the spring this time.
  Gallagher didn’t just survive the cut; he appears poised to play a more
  central role. It is six years since anyone won a title two years running and
  almost 20 since anyone other than Barcelona did it, last season’s certainties
  tending to slip away swiftly and opponents invariably coming back for more.
  One thing is for sure and if it’s a bold prediction you’re after, try this; by
  the time May comes round, in some corner of a foreign field, an Englishman
  will lift the league title. Tyrhys, it is your time.
