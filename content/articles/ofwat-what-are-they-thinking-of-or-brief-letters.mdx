  Following major sewage breaches by Thames Water, Ofwat imposed a massive fine
  on it, the only effect being to make it still further unable to perform its
  legal responsibilities, instead of obtaining authority to prosecute the
  responsible executives of the company. Then the powers that be announced the
  imminence of a drought, yet the public has not been urged to cut water use.
  Can any of your readers enlighten me as to the thought process of our water
  regulators? Prof Roy Goode Oxford • I have not enjoyed a double-yolk egg for
  more than 30 years until last week, when all six in a box of free-range eggs
  had double yolks. Rachel Reeves would have no worries if we could all raise
  our productivity by the same amount. Dennis Johnson Bedford • I was delighted
  by the excellent review of Beaumaris’s launderette (Letters, 17 August).
  However, the Blue Bay Launderette in Llangollen is even more marvellous. Just
  in case anyone camping in north Wales needs one, the Welsh word for
  launderette is golchfa. Fiona Collins Carrog, Denbighshire • To an atheist
  like me, this dispute over Good Friday (Letters, 14 August) is like two bald
  men fighting over a comb. David Joss Buckley London • On reflection, I find
  the planting of a potato tuber or seed into the ground on Good Friday deeply
  symbolic. I commend Christians and non-Christians to do so next spring, on 3
  April 2026. Rev Canon John Longuet-Higgins Hartpury, Gloucestershire • Have an
  opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today? Please email us your
