  Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused Russia of trying to humiliate Ukraine and
  Europe by “deliberately killing civilians” before talks with Donald Trump in
  the White House to be attended by Ukraine’s president and a group of European
  leaders. Zelenskyy described the latest strikes by Moscow on four Ukrainian
  cities as “demonstrative and cynical”. At least seven people were killed in a
  drone attack on Kharkiv, including a small girl, while three were killed in
  another bombing in Zaporizhzhia, he said. The Russians were “aware that a
  meeting is taking place today in Washington that will address the end of the
  war”, Zelenskyy posted on X. “[Vladimir] Putin will commit demonstrative
  killings to maintain pressure on Ukraine and Europe, as well as to humiliate
  diplomatic efforts.” He said Ukraine required an end to the war, reliable
  security guarantees, and a just and “dignified peace”, adding: “Moscow must
  hear the word stop.” Russia’s latest attacks come amid signs that Trump is
  likely to put pressure on Zelenskyy to accept a peace deal in which Russia
  would gain land it has been unable since 2014 to occupy. The US president has
  ruled out allowing Ukraine to join Nato or retake Russian-occupied Crimea as
  part of the negotiations. Hours before he was due to meet the leaders of
  Britain, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the EU and Nato, Trump posted on
  Truth Social that it was a “big day at the White House”. He added: “We have
  never had so many European Leaders here at one time. A great honor for
  America!!! Lets see what the results will be??? President DJT.” In another
  post on Sunday night, Trump said Zelenskyy could “end the war with Russia
  almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight. No getting
  back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and no
  going into Nato by Ukraine. Some things never change!!!” In a video clip
  recorded from his plane to Washington, Keir Starmer said “everybody” wanted
  the war to end, not least Ukrainians. But he added: “We’ve got to get this
  right. We’ve got to make sure there is peace, that it is lasting peace, and
  that it is fair and that it is just.” Downing Street played down expectations
  that an agreement would be signed on Monday. A spokesperson welcomed the fact
  that the US had offered to provide security guarantees, a commitment made
  public over the weekend by Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff. They would not
  comment on Trump’s apparent peace plan, which envisages handing the entirety
  of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts to Russia, including a fortress-belt of cities
  Russia has been unable to conquer. The UK was no longer pushing for an
  immediate ceasefire, Downing Street added. The prime minister and European
  leaders are keen to avoid a repeat of the public mauling of Zelenskyy during
  his previous trip to the White House, in February, when Trump and the US
  vice-president, JD Vance, accused him of ingratitude and told him: “You’re not
  in a good position. You don’t have the cards right now.” According to ABC
  News, Vance will take part in discussions with Zelenskyy on Monday. Arriving
  in Washington late on Sunday, Zelenskyy said he hoped Ukraine’s “shared
  strength” with the US and European counterparts would compel Russia to peace.
  “I am grateful to the president of the United States for the invitation. We
  all equally want to end this war swiftly and reliably,” Zelenskyy posted on
  Telegram. “And I hope that our shared strength with America and with our
  European friends will compel Russia to real peace.” Trump will meet first with
  Zelenskyy at 1.15pm EDT (6.15pm UK time) in the Oval Office, and then with the
  European leaders in the East Room at 3pm, the White House said. Even before
  Trump’s remarks on Sunday, Zelenskyy faced a daunting task of reversing the
  damage done to Ukraine’s security prospects by the Trump-Putin summit in
  Alaska on Friday. Earlier, Trump accused the media of misrepresenting his
  “great meeting in Alaska” – an encounter widely seen as a victory for Putin
  and a humiliation for the US president. European leaders on Monday will
  reaffirm their support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and argue against
  any land deal that rewards Russian aggression. They will also seek further
  clarity on what security guarantees the US is willing to offer in the event of
  a settlement. Witkoff has said these would be outside Nato but similar to the
  alliance’s self-defence pact, article 5. The European leaders will hold a
  preparatory meeting with Zelenskyy before talks with Trump, the EU said. Yuriy
  Boyechko, the chief executive of the charity Hope for Ukraine, said the
  country’s constitution meant it could not legally cede territory to Russia.
  Putin had offered a “peace deal” Ukraine would be forced to reject, knowing
  Trump would then blame Zelenskyy and end US support for Kyiv. Boyechko added:
  “Monday is the day when Ukraine and its European allies must recognise the
  urgent need to develop their own strategy to defend Ukraine and secure peace
  in Europe – because it is increasingly likely that Trump will walk away from
  the peace negotiations.” Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s envoy to international
  organisations in Vienna, said early on Monday that Russia agreed that any
  future Ukraine peace agreement must provide security guarantees to Kyiv, but
  that Russia “has equal right to expect that Moscow will also get efficient
  security guarantees”.
