  Miguel Uribe, the Colombian senator and presidential hopeful who was shot in
  the head at a campaign event in June, has died, his wife has confirmed. Uribe,
  an opposition candidate with the rightwing Centro Democrático party, was shot
  twice in the head and once in the leg during a campaign stop two months ago
  while vying for his party’s nomination for the 2026 elections. He spent nine
  weeks in intensive care and had several surgeries before succumbing to his
  injuries early on Monday aged 39. In a statement posted online, his wife,
  María Claudia Tarazona, addressed her late husband and promised to take care
  of their children. “I ask God to show me the way to learn to live without
  you,” she wrote. “Rest in peace, love of my life, I will take care of our
  children.” She added: “Wait for me, because when I fulfil my promise to our
  children, I will come looking for you and we will have our second chance.” Six
  people have been arrested in connection with the 7 June shooting, including a
  teenage boy identified as the alleged gunman. In footage of his arrest, the
  teenager was heard shouting that he had been hired by a local drug dealer and
  claiming “I did it for money for my family”. Authorities have stressed they
  are pursuing the “intellectual authors” of the attack, and at least three
  adults are facing charges of using a minor to commit a crime. Colombia’s
  national police director, Carlos Fernando Triana, said another arrested man,
  Élder José Arteaga Hernández, known as El Costeño, was among those who had
  orchestrated the attack. The defence ministry has offered a 3bn peso (about
  £550,000) reward for information leading to the identification and capture of
  the culprits, and said the US, Britain and the United Arab Emirates were
  helping with the investigation. Colombia’s leftwing president, Gustavo Petro,
  offered his condolences to Uribe’s family, saying: “Life is above any
  ideology.” He said: “For decades, revenge has fuelled violence. No more.
  Miguel’s death hurts us as if he were one of our own. It is a defeat.” The
  assassination was the worst incident of political violence in Colombia in two
  decades and has reignited fears of a return to the country’s bloody past when
  organised crime and rebel groups murdered political candidates, journalists
  and judges with impunity. Between 1986 and 1990, five presidential candidates
  were murdered, while grassroots political activity was frequently targeted.
  Uribe’s mother, the journalist Diana Turbay, was killed in 1991 during a
  botched rescue mission after she was kidnapped by the Medellín cartel, headed
  by the drug lord Pablo Escobar. “If my mother was willing to give her life for
  a cause, how could I not do the same in life and in politics?” Uribe, who was
  five when his mother was killed, said in an interview last year. Despite a
  2016 peace deal between the government and the country’s main rebel group, the
  Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), violence has continued and new
  groups have emerged into the vacuum. Earlier this year, fighting between two
  armed groups near the Venezuelan border led to the displacement of more than
  50,000 people. In June, a wave of bomb attacks across Cali, the country’s
  third largest city, and several nearby towns killed at least seven people and
  wounded 50. Uribe hailed from one of Colombia’s most prominent political
  families – he was the grandson of the former president Julio César Turbay
  Ayala – and enjoyed a rapid political rise. The lawyer, who held a master’s
  degree from Harvard University, entered politics as a Bogotá councillor aged
  25 and by 2022 he had secured the highest number of votes within the
  conservative Democratic Centre party. Known for his sharp criticism of Petro,
  Uribe argued for a hardline approach to armed groups. He was not considered a
  frontrunner in the upcoming presidential vote, the first round of which is due
  in May. Isaac Morales, of the Bogotá-based Peace and Reconciliation
  Foundation, which monitors political-electoral violence, said: “With Uribe
  Turbay’s death, democracy in Colombia is lost and the electoral outlook for
  2026 is very uncertain.” María José Pizarro, a leftwing senator whose father
  was assassinated on the presidential campaign trail in 1990, said that while
  Uribe “represented ideas different from mine”, his “voice deserved respect in
  the democratic arena”. She said: “Unpatriotic minorities continue to kill,
  understanding only the language of violence and seeking to influence the
  nation’s destiny with bloodshed.”
