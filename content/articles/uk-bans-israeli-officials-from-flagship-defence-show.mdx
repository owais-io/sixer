  The UK has banned Israeli officials from attending the country’s flagship
  defence event next month. Israeli industry, including UK subsidiaries of
  Israeli companies, will be able to attend London’s Defence &amp; Security
  Equipment International (DSEI) show in September but the UK government will
  not invite representatives of the Israeli government to the major industry
  event. It comes as Keir Starmer prepares to recognise a Palestinian state
  after warning Israel the UK would do so if the country did not take steps to
  relieve suffering in Gaza or meet other conditions. A UK government
  spokesperson said: “The Israeli government’s decision to further escalate its
  military operation in Gaza is wrong. As a result, we can confirm that no
  Israeli government delegation will be invited to attend DSEI UK 2025. “There
  must be a diplomatic solution to end this war now, with an immediate
  ceasefire, the return of the hostages and a surge in humanitarian aid to the
  people of Gaza.” Israel’s defence ministry said that as a result of the trade
  fair ban it would not run its national pavilion, as it has done previously at
  the DSEI. Israeli defence companies, such as Elbit Systems, Rafael, IAI and
  Uvision, will be able to attend. Britain’s decision has echoes of a dispute at
  the Paris air show three months ago, when France blocked off with black
  partitions the stands of Israeli defence companies after they refused to
  remove attack weapons from display, prompting a furious response from Israel.
  Israel said Britain’s decision was a “regrettable act of discrimination” and
  “introduces political considerations wholly inappropriate for a professional
  defence industry exhibition”. The four-day show, due to open on 9 September,
  features national delegations and private companies, which showcase military
  kit and weapons at London’s ExCel centre. The event takes place every other
  year. DSEI is organised by a private company, Clarion Defence &amp; Security,
  with backing from the British government and the military.
