  Ruben Loftus-Cheek was riding high. The 2018‑19 season had been very good for
  him. The midfielder scored 10 goals for Chelsea and there was one game to
  come: the Europa League final against Arsenal. Beyond that, he had an eye on
  the Nations League finals with England and the chance to add to his 10 caps.
  Four of them had come at the 2018 World Cup in Russia; memories that will
  never fade. He was only 23. He was about to take the next step. And then it
  all fell apart. Loftus-Cheek is addressing the media at St George’s Park. He
  could be forgiven for pinching himself after being given an England recall on
  Tuesday as a late replacement for the injured Adam Wharton. Did anyone expect
  Thomas Tuchel to turn to him for the World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and
  Serbia? Did Loftus-Cheek dare to dream himself? His previous call-up had been
  in March 2019 when he was forced to withdraw through injury. The last of his
  caps was against USA in November 2018. Loftus-Cheek’s excitement is palpable.
  He has a new manager in Max Allegri at Milan, where he has played since his
  £15m move from Chelsea in the summer of 2023, and plenty of new teammates
  after a busy transfer window including Luka Modric, Adrien Rabiot and
  Christopher Nkunku. Now this. But as Loftus-Cheek looks forward, it is
  inevitable that he also goes back – to the fateful game when everything
  changed. It haunted Loftus-Cheek for some time that it was essentially a
  nothing match, a post-season filler before the Europa League showpiece.
  Chelsea had travelled to the US for a charity engagement against the New
  England Revolution and it was there that Loftus-Cheek ruptured an achilles
  tendon. Physically, he says it took him between 18 months and two years to
  feel OK. Mentally, it was a nightmare. “It was definitely in my mind [that it
  was only a friendly],” Loftus‑Cheek says. “We had a European final a week and
  a half later and I’d played in the competition all the way through. It was
  very strange because I was feeling so good and so that stuff was playing in my
  mind about why it happened … why it happened at such a good point in my
  career. It did take a while to process, to get those feelings out. It was a
  very hard time.” Loftus-Cheek describes himself as being “at peace with the
  past”. He is calmer these days, more experienced. But it was certainly not
  easy to recast himself as an England fan during his exile, following the team
  from afar as they reached the finals of Euro 2020 and 2024. “Being away from
  the squad for so long, you kind of get used to not going, even if you still
  want to push in club football to hopefully get a sniff,” Loftus-Cheek says. “I
  watched the finals at home with my family. It’s almost more nerve-racking
  watching on the telly than playing in those games for England so I hope I’m
  not watching another one.” Loftus-Cheek started to pick up the pieces after
  his achilles injury with a loan at Fulham in 2020-21, even if it was a
  struggle. When he returned to Chelsea, he ran into Tuchel, who managed him
  until the German’s sacking by the club in September 2022. While Loftus‑Cheek
  has played well for Milan, it is hard not to link his England recall to the
  connection he enjoyed with Tuchel at Stamford Bridge. “I remember when I went
  back to Chelsea, he spoke to me about playing right wing-back,” Loftus-Cheek
  says. “I said: ‘No, no, no.’ But I played there anyway. I played many
  positions under him.” Loftus-Cheek was also a No 6 and a No 8 for Tuchel and
  there was the FA Cup tie at Luton when he played in central defence. Tuchel
  prizes Loftus-Cheek’s physicality but he also recognises the purity of his
  technique, the skills that Loftus‑Cheek honed playing in the cages of Catford,
  the south-east London neighbourhood where he grew up. “I’d never played that
  kind of wide position before,” Loftus‑Cheek says. “But he suggested that I’m a
  powerful runner and had the pace to play there [at right wing-back], the
  physicality to get up and down at speed. I ended up playing there quite a lot
  that season. I was happy to play the role and I actually started to do quite
  well in it. It was just the shock of the suggestion that was the funny part.
  “Since I’ve been at Milan, I’ve played a lot higher, closer to the striker.
  But under Thomas I played a lot more deeper, so I’m able to do that. With
  things that can happen in a tournament, being versatile is a good thing. I’m
  happy to play anywhere for the team.”
