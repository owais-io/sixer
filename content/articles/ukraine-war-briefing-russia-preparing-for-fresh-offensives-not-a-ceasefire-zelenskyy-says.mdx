  Zelenskyy says

  Russia is preparing its troops for new offensives instead of getting ready to
  stop the war in Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Monday, ahead of talks
  between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump in Alaska on Friday. “[Putin] is
  certainly not getting ready for a ceasefire and war end,” the Ukrainian
  president said in his nightly address. He added, without providing specifics,
  that Russia was moving its troops for new operations on Ukrainian soil. “There
  is no sign that the Russians have received signals to prepare for a postwar
  situation.” Separately, Zelenskyy said he had spoken to Indian prime minister
  Narendra Modi and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Monday, as he
  seeks to rally support for Ukraine beyond Europe. Both countries have taken
  cautious diplomatic positions on the Russian invasion. India is a major buyer
  of Russian oil and Saudi Arabia has pitched itself as a mediator in the
  conflict. Zelenskyy said he spoke to both leaders about strengthening
  Ukraine’s position in any peace process. “Communication with leaders is
  ongoing practically around the clock – we are in constant touch,” he wrote on
  X. “Now is the moment when there is a real chance to achieve peace.” Trump
  said he and Putin would discuss “land swapping” when they met on Friday and
  expressed frustration with Zelenskyy for putting conditions on such a
  potential agreement. During a news conference at the White House on Monday,
  the US president said he was frustrated with Zelenskyy’s insistence that
  Ukraine would need to hold a national referendum on any peace deal that
  stipulated recognising Russian control over territory that it has occupied
  during the war. “I was a little bothered by the fact that Zelenskyy was saying
  I have to get constitutional approval,” Trump said. “He has approval to go to
  war and kill everybody but he needs approval to do a land swap. Because there
  will be some land swapping going on. I know that through Russia and through
  conversations with everybody.” Moscow hopes the Putin-Trump meeting will give
  momentum to the normalisation of relations between Russia and the US, the Tass
  news agency reported on Tuesday. “We hope that the upcoming high-level meeting
  will give an impulse to the normalization of bilateral relations,” Tass cited
  Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov as saying. German chancellor
  Friedrich Merz on Monday invited Trump to join emergency virtual talks with EU
  leaders and Zelenskyy on Wednesday ahead of the Alaska summit. Merz’s office
  said in a statement that the virtual talks would focus on “further options for
  action to put pressure on Russia” and “preparations for possible peace
  negotiations and related issues of territorial claims and security”. It is not
  clear whether or not Trump has accepted the invitation to the call. EU foreign
  policy chief Kaja Kallas said on Monday that the EU would work on a 19th
  package of sanctions against Russia and warned against concessions to Moscow.
  “As far as Russia has not agreed to full and unconditional ceasefire, we
  should not even discuss any concessions,” Kallas said in a statement. “The
  sequencing of the steps is important. First an unconditional ceasefire with a
  strong monitoring system and ironclad security guarantees,” she said, adding
  that “we will work on a 19th package of sanctions”. Ukraine has retaken two
  villages in its eastern region of Sumy, Kyiv’s military said, adding to recent
  small territorial gains along the border with Russia. Ukraine’s forces
  liberated the settlements of Stepne and Novokostiantynivka on the Sumy
  frontline, the general staff said on Tuesday. Monday’s gains followed Sunday’s
  news that Kyiv’s military had retaken the village of Bezsalivka. The
  battlefield reports could not be independently verified. The captain and two
  officers of a ship believed to belong to Russia’s so-called shadow fleet have
  been charged with sabotage for cutting five Baltic Sea cables in December,
  Finnish prosecutors said on Monday. The captain and first and second officers
  of the Cook Islands-registered oil tanker Eagle S are alleged to have dragged
  the ship’s anchor on the seabed for about 90km (56 miles), damaging five
  undersea cables in the Gulf of Finland. A Ukrainian drone attack killed one
  person and wounded two others in a region about 420km (260 miles) east of
  Moscow, a Russian official said on Monday. The governor of Nizhny Novgorod,
  Gleb Nikitin, said in a statement that drones targeted two “industrial zones”
  and caused the casualties and unspecified damage.
