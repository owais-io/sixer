  Major reforms to working with children checks, more unannounced visits to
  childcare centres and a rethink of the reliance on for-profit providers are
  among the recommendations in an urgent review into childcare services in
  Victoria. The review, written by the former South Australian premier Jay
  Weatherill and senior Victorian bureaucrat Pam White, was released by the
  state government on Wednesday. Half of the 22 recommendations were directed at
  the federal government, which separately on Wednesday released the names of 30
  childcare centres it has taken compliance action against under new powers that
  passed parliament last month. The Victorian government ordered the rapid child
  safety review after it was revealed in July that childcare worker Joshua Dale
  Brown had been charged with sexually abusing eight children, aged between five
  months and two years. The review, which was general in nature, warned there
  was “no silver bullet” to “prevent dangerous individuals” from working in the
  sector, but it found the system required a “fundamental reset” to improve
  child safety. Sign up: AU Breaking News email It said responsibility for early
  childhood education and care (ECEC) was split between federal and state and
  territory governments, and in Victoria, numerous departments and agencies
  regulated it, creating “gaps”. The premier, Jacinta Allan, has commited $42m
  to implementing all 22 recommendations by the end of the year. She apologised
  that the trust parents had placed in childcare centres had been “horribly
  broken” by recent allegations. “I am truly sorry. I just can’t imagine the
  unbearable pain and hurt those families must be experiencing, particularly as
  a mum,” Allan said. “As premier, I can do everything in my power to act.”
  For-profit childcare has grown but rules haven’t kept up The review found the
  ECEC sector had undergone “rapid growth” over the past decade. In Victoria,
  the number of long day care services had grown by 60% since 2015, from 1,280
  to 2,049. Of the 726 new services, 94% were operated by for-profit providers.
  But it said there hadn’t been a “coherent plan” to manage this growth.
  “Rather, the market has been left to respond to financial incentives that
  encourage providers to open services and charge high fees, but does not drive
  investment in quality, safety or in a stable, capable and well-supported
  workforce,” it read. This had led to “significant workforce challenges
  including shortages, casualisation and the use of labour hire and high
  turnover rates”. The review recommended the commonwealth lead an “urgent
  rethink” of ECEC – including its “current funding model and reliance on the
  market” – to address these issues, as well as establish a “time-limited” early
  childhood reform commission to ensure reforms were delivered. The commonwealth
  was also urged to establish a national early childhood worker register,
  covering all ECEC staff in Australia, and give state regulators the power to
  deregister individuals. The Albanese government has already committed to a
  national register, although Victoria has set up its own in the interim, due to
  the “frustratingly slow” pace of federal reform. Working with children checks
  In Victoria, the review recommended an “overhaul” of the working with children
  check (WWCC) scheme to allow a worker’s clearance to be suspended or refused
  when there were “credible allegations or patterns of concerning behaviour with
  children”. This could include unsubstantiated allegations made through the
  reportable conduct scheme, which it also recommended be given more powers to
  share information. It also recommends the reportable conduct scheme, managed
  by the Commission for Children and Young People, and the WWCC screening
  authority, which sits within the Department of Government Services, be merged
  into a single entity. This entity would oversee a database for the sector. It
  described this as “one of the most critical changes that must happen” to
  ensure information is “able to be seen and acted upon”. An independent
  regulator The review also recommended making the ECEC regulator independent by
  removing it from the Department of Education.. It said this regulator should
  apply the “most rigorous inspection regime in the country”, by doubling
  unannounced visits from once every two years to once a year. It also urged
  that it be appropriately funded, with the commonwealth to “play its part”,
  given it stopped contributing financially in 2018. Victoria’s minister for
  children, Lizzie Blandthorn, said this was one of her “priorities” for the
  meeting of the nation’s education ministers on Friday. Improve centre safety
  The review also made several recommendations to improve safety at a centre
  level. They included a federal review of staffing arrangements and
  “consideration of a ‘four eyes’ rule of two adults visible to each other while
  with children”, as well as grants to help centres undertake renovations to
  create “clear lines of sight”. While the review said there were mixed views on
  the efficacy of CCTV in centres, it recommended a national 12-month trial to
  evaluate its use as a regulatory and investigative tool. It said calls to ban
  or restrict male childcare workers were “not the right way to address safety
  concerns” and had “deeply affected many male educators in the sector”. “All
  people, men included, should be encouraged to join the ECEC workforce, and
  contribute to educating and caring for children,” it read. Both the Greens and
  the opposition have said the government shouldn’t have waited for a crisis to
  act and pointed to an ombudsman report that recommended changes to WWCCs three
  years ago.
