  When Vladimir Putin lands in Alaska on Friday for his high-stakes meeting with
  Donald Trump, he will be flanked by some of the most powerful figures in the
  Kremlin’s inner circle – a team of seasoned political operators, financial
  strategists and diplomatic enforcers who have helped shape Russia’s foreign
  and economic policy for more than two decades. The delegation, a mix of old
  guard loyalists and younger financial power brokers, hints at Putin’s desire
  to woo Trump and dangle financial incentives for siding with Moscow on
  Ukraine. Trump will also be accompanied by a cadre of his most trusted
  advisers, among them a property mogul, a former hedge fund billionaire and the
  country’s top diplomat. Despite earlier media reports, Trump’s vice-president
  JD Vance and his defence secretary Pete Hegseth were not listed in the
  official delegation. The US president has long prized loyalty over experience,
  and many in Kyiv and the west are uneasy about the lack of seasoned Russia
  experts with real influence in the White House. Ultimately, though, the summit
  will come down to a face-to-face meeting between the two men – and putting
  Trump alone in a room with Putin has always been an unpredictable, and
  potentially dangerous, affair. Russian delegation Sergei Lavrov Foreign
  minister The 75-year-old has been in post since 2004, making him one of the
  longest-tenured senior diplomats in the world. Known for his gravel-voiced
  delivery and combative press conferences, Lavrov has been central to crafting
  and defending Moscow’s foreign policy from the Iraq war to the annexation of
  Crimea and the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. A career diplomat who joined
  the Soviet foreign service in 1972, he spent a decade as Russia’s ambassador
  to the United Nations before assuming his current post. Once regarded in
  western capitals as a pragmatic and highly capable diplomat, Lavrov has
  adopted an increasingly confrontational and at times belligerent tone in
  tandem with the radicalised politics of Putin’s Kremlin. Yuri Ushakov Foreign
  policy adviser Ushakov, 78, is a veteran presidential aide and one of Putin’s
  most trusted foreign policy advisers. A career diplomat with fluent English
  and a long focus on Washington, he served as Russia’s ambassador to the US
  from 1998 to 2008. Known for his calm demeanour and deep institutional memory,
  Ushakov has served as a behind-the-scenes strategist, coordinating Putin’s
  international engagements and frequently supplying the president’s talking
  points to state media. Andrei Belousov Defence minister The 66-year-old is one
  of the few technocrats to ascend to the Kremlin’s top security posts. His
  surprise appointment in 2024 to replace the longtime incumbent Sergei Shoigu
  was perceived as an attempt by the Kremlin to rein in corruption in the armed
  forces and to accelerate the transformation of Russia’s militarised economy
  into a full-scale war economy, now expanding at double-digit rates. An
  economist by training, contemporaries describe Belousov as a deeply religious
  and loyal technocrat who keeps Orthodox icons and theological books in his
  modest office. Kirill Dmitriev Russian Direct Investment Fund chief At 50,
  Dmitriev is a relatively new kid on the Kremlin block, yet has emerged as a
  key operator between Moscow and the business-oriented Trump administration.
  US-educated, with stints at Stanford University and Harvard Business School,
  Dmitriev heads the Kremlin’s $10bn sovereign wealth fund and has openly
  boasted of his links to American business elites. He has personal ties to
  Putin’s family – his wife, Natalya Popova, is a close friend of one of the
  president’s daughters. In Alaska, he is expected to pitch ambitious plans for
  economic and infrastructure cooperation in the Arctic, tempting Trump with the
  prospect of a lucrative entente between two great powers. Dmitriev’s rapid
  rise and overt outreach to Washington have unsettled the Kremlin’s old guard,
  with reports of friction with senior foreign ministry figures, including
  Lavrov. Anton Siluanov Finance minister Siluanov, 62, has been in his post
  since 2011 and is a key architect of the Kremlin’s efforts to keep the economy
  afloat in the face of the invasion of Ukraine and western sanctions. Siluanov
  has been tasked with making Russia’s economy as sanction-proof as possible,
  and he popularised the term “fortress economy” in Kremlin circles to describe
  this drive for sanction resilience. But while sanctions have not brought
  Russia’s economy to its knees, growth has slowed sharply, and Siluanov’s
  surprise inclusion in the Alaska delegation signals Moscow’s priority of
  securing the lifting of western restrictions as part of any peace deal. US
  delegation Marco Rubio Secretary of state Once a staunch critic of Trump, the
  54-year-old former Florida senator is now one of his closest allies. Over
  time, Rubio’s influence has grown, with his appointment in May as acting
  national security adviser making him the first person since Henry Kissinger to
  hold both posts simultaneously. His more traditional hawkish stance on China
  and Russia has made him a valued interlocutor in Europe and Kyiv, but it could
  set him on a collision course with pro-Russia voices in Trump’s inner circle.
  John Ratcliffe CIA director John Ratcliffe, 59, is a former Republican
  congressman from Texas who served as Trump’s director of national intelligence
  from 2020 to 2021. His nomination to lead the country’s spy agency in 2025
  drew bipartisan support, with lawmakers across the aisle viewing him as
  well-qualified for the role. A staunch Trump ally, Ratcliffe rose to
  prominence by championing hardline conservative positions, advocating for a
  more aggressive intelligence posture and stressing the strategic threat posed
  by China. In Trump’s second term, Ratcliffe has taken a measured approach to
  the war in Ukraine. Aligning with Trump’s efforts to broker a peace deal with
  Russia and apply pressure on Kyiv, he has at times backed a temporary pause in
  US intelligence support as a way to spur negotiations. Yet he has also
  acknowledged Ukraine’s resilience, saying its military has been consistently
  underestimated and that “they will fight with their bare hands if they have
  to”. Steve Witkoff Special envoy to Ukraine and the Middle East Trump’s
  68-year-old special envoy is a name that sends shivers through Kyiv and
  European capitals. Appointed in 2025, he has swiftly become Trump’s de facto
  interlocutor with Putin, despite having no diplomatic experience. In past
  interviews, Witkoff – who travels to the Kremlin alone and without his own
  interpreters – has echoed Moscow’s talking points on the war and appeared to
  legitimise Russia’s territorial gains in Ukraine. A former New York
  real-estate lawyer turned property tycoon, Witkoff met Trump in the 1980s
  while working on one of his Manhattan deals. The two have remained close ever
  since and Witkoff is fiercely loyal to the president. Scott Bessent Treasury
  secretary Scott Bessent, 62, a billionaire investor and longtime Republican
  donor, has quietly emerged as one of the most influential figures in Trump’s
  economic orbit. A former chief investment officer at Soros Fund Management, he
  has been tasked with navigating Trump’s chaotic and often unpredictable
  approach to tariffs. In Alaska, Bessent is expected to explore economic
  incentives and investment arrangements that could be offered to Moscow in
  exchange for concessions – a reminder that this meeting is as much about money
  as it is about geopolitics. Howard Lutnick Secretary of commerce Lutnick, 63,
  is a Wall Street power broker turned political appointee, a blunt,
  hard-driving negotiator with a taste for the spotlight. He joined Trump’s
  second administration in early 2025 as a loyalist outsider, bringing no
  government experience but deep connections across business and capital
  markets. Very close to Trump, reportedly speaking with him most nights,
  Lutnick’s inclusion, like that of Bessent, underscores Washington’s appetite
  to extract economic gains from the summit. Apart from the five heavyweights,
  Trump’s delegation features 11 other officials, among them his chief of staff,
  Susie Wiles, and press secretary, Karoline Leavitt.
