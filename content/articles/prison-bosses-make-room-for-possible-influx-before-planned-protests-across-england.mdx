  Prison bosses will make room for a possible influx of arrested demonstrators
  this weekend amid concerns that some jails are close to full, the head of the
  national governors’ body has revealed. Police have threatened to make hundreds
  of arrests if a planned protest in London this weekend over the proscription
  of Palestine Action goes ahead. There are also at least eight planned
  demonstrations outside hotels housing asylum seekers. The Ministry of Justice
  confirmed it had initiated “capacity gold command” as it attempts to manage
  the use of prison cells, with jails across England and Wales 97.5% full.
  Capacity gold command is initiated when the number of prisoners across the
  estate reaches critical levels. It allows an appointed gold commander to
  monitor every out-of-use cell, direct moves into and out of prisons and
  maximise the use of open prisons and home detention curfews. Government
  sources said the justice department had re-examined the possibility of
  launching Operation Early Dawn, which would allow defendants to be held in
  police cells until prison beds become available and could mean their court
  dates were delayed or adjourned at short notice. Tom Wheatley, the president
  of the Prison Governors’ Association, said he was concerned about the impact
  on prisons of possible public order events after the riots in 2024 after the
  Southport murders. He said: “Any spike in the numbers of people remanded in
  custody will have an impact on prisons. HMPPS HQ is again operating ‘capacity
  gold command’ arrangements to direct governors to move prisoners to ensure
  capacity is available. Governors in reception prisons will be directed to move
  prisoners over the weekend in order to create space. “This will mean sometimes
  moving prisoners long distances to prisons that have room to create it in
  those that don’t. This is far from ideal in that resettling prisoners from
  prisons a long way from where they are going to live on release is difficult
  logistically and less likely to be successful.” Sources said capacity gold
  command was activated in February 2023 and ended in September 2024, when
  Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary and lord chancellor, initiated an early
  release scheme. Because of overcrowding, a source said it was reactivated in
  March this year so that senior officials and ministers were informed about
  individual cell space. Saturday’s protest against the ban on Palestine Action
  will go ahead, organisers have said, despite the police saying they will carry
  out mass detentions. There is an unconnected Palestine solidarity march also
  taking place on Saturday. Defend Our Juries, a pressure group campaigning to
  lift the ban on Palestine Action under terrorism laws, said on Tuesday that
  more than 500 people had committed to holding up signs at its protest reading
  “I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action” as part of the protest. The
  group said the event would go ahead as planned after the “conditional
  commitment requirement” had been reached. Tim Crosland, a spokesperson for
  Defend Our Juries, defended plans to include Moazzam Begg, a former Guantánamo
  Bay detainee and director of the advocacy group Cage, in a press conference on
  Wednesday. Crosland said he could see why some people who supported the
  protest would have difficulty with a platform being shared with Cage, but
  added: “At this moment it feels it is so important to build relations with
  Muslim communities.” He said: “Moazzam has never been convicted of anything. I
  do personally have a lot of admiration for him. I think he went through
  horrific things in Guantánamo, as everyone in Guantánamo did. “He’s come out
  the other side such a strong advocate for justice and is able to put the
  terrorism laws in their wider perspective and speak to some of the damage they
  have done to communities.” Cage has suggested in the past that Mohammed
  Emwazi, believed to be the Islamic State killer known as “Jihadi John”, had
  been radicalised in part by Britain’s intelligence services. Also appearing at
  the press conference will be Huda Ammori, the co-founder of Palestine Action,
  who was given permission last month by a judge to bring a legal challenge to
  the home secretary’s decision to ban the group. More than 200 people have been
  arrested in response to the proscription of the group last month. The location
  of Saturday’s protest has not been made known. The Metropolitan police made
  clear they would arrest anyone breaking terrorism laws, as Downing Street
  urged people not to attend any protest. The demonstration has been organised
  to protest against the decision by the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, to ban
  the organisation last month after activists caused what police said was £7m of
  damage to jets at RAF Brize Norton. Police are also braced for further
  protests and disorder across the UK as anti-migrant demonstrations continue
  outside hotels housing asylum seekers. At least four protests have been
  organised for the next week in locations such as Bournemouth, Southampton and
  Portsmouth, with tensions rising further after clashes over the weekend.
  Far-right groups also plan to protest outside at least eight migrant hotels on
  Friday as part of a “no asylum day” of action. A Ministry of Justice
  spokesperson said: “Capacity gold has been used for many months in the
  management of capacity pressure in the prison estate. The swift and
  coordinated response to last year’s unrest shows the criminal justice system
  is prepared to act quickly if needed to maintain stability and keep the public
  safe.”
