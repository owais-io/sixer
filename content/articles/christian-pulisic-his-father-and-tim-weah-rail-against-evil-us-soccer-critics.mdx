  Tim Weah, Christian Pulisic and his father, Mark, delivered searing takes on
  ex-US men’s national team players who criticized the team during their recent
  run of bad form, with Weah calling the pundits “evil”. The trio made the
  comments in the latest epsiode of the Pulsic docuseries on Paramount+, the
  final episodes of which were released this week. The new episodes cover the
  national team from the 2024 Copa América, in which the US underperformed by
  exiting at the group stage, up through the 2025 Nations League final, where
  the US lost against Panama and Canada en route to a disappointing fourth-place
  finish in a competition they had won in each of the previous three editions.
  Following that tournament, Pulisic kicked off a media firestorm when he
  announced that he would skip the 2025 Gold Cup, the team’s last competitive
  tournament before next year’s World Cup on home soil, due to fatigue after a
  second-straight 50-game season with Milan. Pulisic’s decision elicited strong
  critiques from ex-US players such as Clint Dempsey, Landon Donovan, Tim
  Howard, Charlie Davies, Jimmy Conrad and Herculez Gomez. “In my opinion [they]
  disrespected me in a lot of ways, and completely forgot about what I’ve done
  for this national team for 10 years,” Pulisic said in the docuseries. The
  series also includes segments focused on Pulisic’s personal life, and the role
  his family plays within his inner circle. His father, Mark, is a former
  professional soccer player, and he spoke up forcefully for his son. “These
  [pundits] want clicks, social media, ‘subscribe to my channels,’ ‘listen to my
  podcasts’ or whatever. I think they should look in the mirror and look at
  their last performances for the national team before they start talking shit,”
  he said. “It’s jealousy. People want to be in his shoes, and they’ll find any
  reason to bring him down. But Christian doesn’t give a shit what anyone says.”
  Christian also repeated a retort he used earlier this year, in an appearance
  on CBS Sports’ Call it What You Want podcast, which had been heavily critical
  of his decision to withdraw from the Gold Cup. “I’d say the most annoying
  thing, and for me the biggest cop-out of all time, is when all pundits say
  ‘they didn’t want it,’ ‘they didn’t have the heart,’ ‘back in our day we would
  fight and we would die on the field,’” he said, insisting again that national
  team results affect him deeply. The most scathing retort, though, came from
  Weah. “I think those guys are chasing checks, and for me I just feel like
  they’re really evil,” he said. “They’ve been players, and they know what it’s
  like when you’re getting bashed. Those are the same guys that’ll turn around
  and shake your hand and try to be friendly with you at the end of the day.
  Don’t get me wrong, I respect all of them. They were players I looked up to.
  “But quite frankly, the guys before us didn’t win anything either. … Christian
  himself has had a better career than every single one of the guys that speak
  negative on us.” Pulisic finished last season as one of Milan’s best players
  in a season when the team won the Supercoppa Italiana but lost in the Coppa
  Italia final, lost in the knockout round of the Champions League, and finished
  eighth in the Serie A table. The team will not play in European competition
  this year, with Pulisic missing time in preseason due to an ankle injury.
