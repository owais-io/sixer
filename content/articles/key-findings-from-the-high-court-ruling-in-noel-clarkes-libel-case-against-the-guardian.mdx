  The 224-page judgment in the libel case brought by Noel Clarke against the
  Guardian was handed down by Mrs Justice Steyn in the high court on Friday.
  Here are the key issues: Were the allegations true? The court found in the
  Guardian’s favour on both its defences: that the articles it published on
  sexual misconduct allegations against Noel Clarke were true or substantially
  true; and that publication of the articles was in the public interest. It said
  that Clarke was, overall, “not a credible or reliable witness”. Regarding the
  first article published by the Guardian, Steyn said: “There are strong grounds
  to believe that the claimant is a serial abuser of women, that he has, over 15
  years, used his power to prey on and harass and sometimes bully female
  colleagues, that he has engaged in unwanted sexual contact, kissing, touching
  or groping, sexually inappropriate behaviour and comments, and professional
  misconduct, taking and sharing explicit pictures and videos without consent,
  including secretly filming a young actor’s naked audition.” She said: “The
  meanings of all eight articles were found to be substantially true. The
  Guardian established that the truth defence applied and so the libel claim
  fell to be dismissed. Was there a public interest in publishing the
  allegations? The court focused on the first article on the basis that if the
  public interest defence succeeded in respect of that, it should succeed on the
  subsequent articles. The Guardian mounted a public interest defence
  principally on the grounds that a successful man in the film and television
  industry had used his power and status to subject women to sexual harassment
  and abuse, unwanted sexual contact, mistreatment and bullying over many years.
  It also said the industry had failed to protect female workers. The court
  found that Katharine Viner, the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, “honestly believed
  publication was in the public interest. If it were necessary to look beyond
  her belief, the other editors and the reporters all believed publication was
  in the public interest, too”. Viner told the court that “sexual harassment is
  an important subject for the Guardian to report on”. The first article “told a
  story of the specific ways in which imbalances of power and influence were
  serially abused”, she said, and there was “a very clear public interest in
  exposing allegations of misconduct” in the context of Clarke having recently
  been given a prestigious award by Bafta. The court concluded that Viner had
  “given compelling and unchallenged evidence that she believed, and continues
  to believe, that it was in the public interest to publish”. Steyn said the
  Guardian “succeeded in establishing that the first article was published on a
  matter of public interest. Ms Viner made the decision to publish and she
  honestly believed (along with all of the Guardian’s editorial witnesses, as
  well as the reporters) that publication was in the public interest … That
  belief was undoubtedly reasonable.” The allegations Steyn said the question
  was whether there were strong grounds to believe that, over 15 years, Clarke
  had used his power to prey on and harass female colleagues, had sometimes
  bullied female colleagues, had engaged in unwanted sexual contact, kissing,
  touching or groping, engaged in sexually inappropriate behaviour and comments,
  had engaged in professional misconduct, and had taken and shared explicit
  pictures and videos without consent. She said that “instances of each of those
  elements have been established” and this is “more than sufficient to find that
  the meaning of the first article is substantially true”. The judge said: “The
  strong impression that I gained is that Mr Clarke felt that he could sexually
  proposition any woman he wanted, as reflected in his evidence that he has
  ‘been turned down a million times’, even allowing for the obvious hyperbole –
  regardless of the circumstances. “He had no understanding of how pressuring
  such conduct could be, or how uncomfortable it could make young women, in
  subordinate roles to him, feel while performing their jobs.” Steyn also found
  that Clarke “covertly filmed the naked auditions” of two women and showed the
  footage to a colleague. “It is probable that Mr Clarke also recorded, or
  sought to record, footage of at least one of the other actors who attended the
  final audition. “Mr Clarke did so knowing that the actors had been firmly
  assured that their naked auditions would not be recorded.” She continued that
  the “inevitable inference” was that Clarke “acted in this way for his own
  sexual gratification”. The witnesses The court heard oral evidence from Clarke
  plus eight witnesses called on his behalf. Written statements were submitted
  from six further witnesses. For the Guardian, the court heard oral evidence
  relating to the truth defence from 26 witnesses and considered witness
  statements from three others, plus six Guardian journalists who gave evidence
  relating to the public interest defence. A striking feature of Clarke’s case
  was that he alleged that “almost all of the Guardian’s 29 witnesses to the
  truth defence are lying, at least in part, in the evidence they have given to
  the court”. His claim that there was a conspiracy against him “lacked any
  proper foundation”. The court found that although there were connections among
  the Guardian’s witnesses to the defence of truth, many came forward
  independently after the first article was published or had no involvement
  until they were asked to give evidence. “There has been no conspiracy to lie.
  In the absence of a conspiracy, Mr Clarke’s case that more than 20 witnesses –
  none of whom are parties or have a stake in this case, as he does – have come
  to court to lie is inherently implausible.” Noel Clarke The court considered
  that “overall, Mr Clarke was not a credible or reliable witness”. Steyn said
  his case had been “almost entirely one of robust denial and
  counter-allegations”. The judgment said Clarke had a “very clear motive to
  lie. He says the Guardian’s publications have been career-ending and he values
  success in the claim in excess of £70m … “It is obvious that the first article
  had a hugely damaging impact on his reputation, his career and his finances.
  He has sued the Guardian for libel, involving both parties in a long, complex
  and expensive trial, to try to repair that damage.” However, Steyn added: “One
  aspect of Mr Clarke’s evidence that I accept is his belief that he is not what
  the Guardian ‘branded’ him. Although I find that he has been untruthful about
  most of the allegations, in his efforts to salvage his career, his initial
  response that ‘some of my actions have affected people in ways I did not
  intend or realise’ was true. “Even when his actions have been calculated and
  deliberate, Mr Clarke has tended to be oblivious to their impact, regarding
  his own behaviour as merely being ‘naughty’, ‘cheeky’, ‘teasing’ or within his
  rights as a director or producer. In addition, he does not see himself as
  reflected in the articles because there is a kinder, more generous side to
  him. But that does not detract from the conclusions I have reached.” The
  Guardian’s journalists The court heard oral evidence in support of the public
  interest defence from six witnesses called by the Guardian: Katharine Viner,
  the editor-in-chief; Owen Gibson, the deputy editor; Paul Lewis, the head of
  investigations; Nicole Jackson, the head of audio, and Lucy Osborne and Sirin
  Kale, the main reporters. Steyn said she agreed with Viner’s evidence that
  “the factual accounts of the Guardian’s sources are presented in ‘a measured
  and accurate way’, without being ‘exaggerated or sensationalised’”. Gibson
  “gave unchallenged and obviously honest and reliable evidence regarding the
  investigation, the decision-making process, and his belief that publication of
  the first article was in the public interest”. Regarding Lewis, Osborne and
  Kale, Steyn said each gave “honest and reliable evidence”. Osborne and Kale
  were each accused in cross-examination of having “an agenda”, seemingly to
  “get Noel Clarke”. Steyn said: “That allegation has no foundation, and is
  demonstrably disproved by the materials before me which show the extensive
  efforts they made to investigate, test and corroborate the information they
  received, and not to publish allegations which they could not substantiate.”
  Osborne and Kale exercised “critical reasoning”, and tested and investigated
  the information they received, the judgment says. The claimant made the “wild
  and wholly unfounded allegation” that Lewis was a “rogue journalist with his
  own agenda”. He was accused of lying and being evasive. Steyn said of Lewis:
  “I found him to be an honest and reliable witness. Across the two days that he
  gave evidence, his conscientiousness, professionalism, integrity and desire to
  assist the court shone through. I have no hesitation in finding that he, too,
  honestly believed that publication of the first article was in the public
  interest.” The court’s conclusion “The Guardian has succeeded in establishing
  both truth and public interest defences to the libel claim. In addition, in
  respect of the second to eighth articles, the serious harm requirement was not
  met. The data protection claim was withdrawn. Accordingly, Mr Clarke’s libel
  and data protection claims against the Guardian are dismissed.”
