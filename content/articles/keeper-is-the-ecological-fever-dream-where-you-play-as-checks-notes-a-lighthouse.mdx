  Keeper is the ecological ‘fever dream’ where you play as – checks notes – a
  lighthouse

  Keeper is staking a bold claim to be the oddest game ever published by
  Microsoft. The setting is weird: an iridescent, far-future imagining of New
  England where organic and non-organic matter mingle in strange, alchemical
  ways. And the characters are undeniably quirky: one is a bird called Twig
  whose beak is made from driftwood. Strangest of all: you play as a lighthouse
  that has inexplicably become animate, sprouting tiny, spindly little legs to
  carry its wibbling, wobbling body. In the sea of action-hero young men and, to
  a lesser degree, women, the lighthouse stands out as an unlikely star.
  Creative lead Lee Petty is a little fuzzy on the details of how it came to be.
  Rather, he talks about the creation of the protagonist as he does the broader
  action-adventure experience: as if it rose out of his subconscious. Despite
  the ostensible absurdity, Petty believes there is a certain intuition about
  it. “You have a light, and light has a very strong connection with life,” he
  says. “You can imagine the verbs for the player, and the actions, puzzles,
  mechanics that fall out of that.” The lighthouse’s illuminated beacon is the
  primary way you interact with the game’s teeming island setting. In
  “unfocused” mode, you direct the beam about a fantastical environment, causing
  foliage and small creatures to grow, change and morph. In “focused” mode, the
  light’s power is concentrated: larger objects undergo transformation while
  some materials are repelled or attracted; this is the basis of the game’s more
  involved puzzles. Keeper’s world is one of gauzy, psychedelic purples and
  deep, verdant greens. We see bioluminescent rock formations, tree-sized
  tendrils protruding from their gigantic flower heads, and a gorgeous,
  whale-like creature floating through the sky, vegetation growing unexpectedly
  on its back. This ecological extravaganza is partly inspired by 1980s fantasy
  movies such as The Dark Crystal and The NeverEnding Story, “weird” and
  “imperfect” works, admits Petty, yet “so earnest in their desire to create a
  world that you haven’t seen before”. Real life proved just as inspiring for
  the creative lead. During Covid lockdowns, he walked alone in the pretty
  foothills south of his San Francisco home. Petty gazed at the abundant
  vegetation while meditating on what the planet might look like should humanity
  cease to exist. He was also reading books and watching movies about mycelium
  networks, thinking deeply about the interconnectedness and interdependence of
  ecosystems. This deluge of feelings, real-world circumstances and reference
  material coalesced as a fever dream, says Petty. He envisioned a “a weird
  island, a sort of surreal, post-human thing, where life has continued to
  evolve in completely unexpected ways”. The game’s genesis arrived shortly
  after Petty’s award-winning employer Double Fine, maker of trippy platformer
  Psychonauts 2, Stacking and many other idiosyncratic titles, was acquired by
  Microsoft. The new management was receptive to his experimental idea: he was
  given the time and resources to explore the concept before locking down its
  form. Keeper seems to have embodied the laid-back approach of its making: the
  vibe is languorously dreamy with many opportunities to slow down and smell the
  enchanting and totally bizarre roses. “You’re not rushed along, you’re not
  given mission objectives. There are no pop-ups on the screen with
  meta-rewards,” says Petty. “You’re kind of left to dwell in the space.” And
  yet there is a grim irony that may yet sour this sweet, whimsical experience:
  Keeper’s vivid celebration of life is being funded by Microsoft at a time when
  the company’s cloud-based storage platform Azure has been used to facilitate
  the preparation of deadly airstrikes and military operations in Gaza and the
  West Bank. The the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement has called
  for the boycott of Microsoft and Xbox products. Recently, unionised workers at
  French studio Arkane, also owned by Microsoft, issued an open letter stating
  that its parent company “has no place being accomplice of a genocide”.
  Microsoft has since claimed to be investigating the use of its platform in
  this manner, which is, it claims, a breach of the terms of service. Petty, of
  course, is far removed from the decisions made by his bosses at Microsoft, and
  he stresses as much. He says this is the “downside” of being owned by a much
  larger organisation, one whose purview extends far beyond entertainment. “I’m
  not in control. Double Fine is not necessarily tacitly endorsing anything of
  our parent company,” he says. “We’re just trying to make great games.” •
  Keeper is due for release on PC and Xbox in October
