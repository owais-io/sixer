  When night falls over a drowned quarry, hope crawls out of despair. The human
  swimmers who play by day here, sploshing back and forth under sheer limestone
  walls, will not see it. Teams of wetsuited divers will not either, and they
  have other priorities. These divers go deep, sinking 25 metres to the rock
  bottom, where wheelhouse wrecks of boats are metal boxes to discover and day
  becomes darkness, lit fitfully by torch beams. Standing in the sunlit uplands
  of a grass bank, looking down through clear blue-green water to submerged
  stone outcrops, our impossible quest is to see nocturnal creatures of cracks
  and cavities. This giant pool is a small sanctuary for breeding native
  white-clawed crayfish, hand-width crustaceans which have been all but wiped
  out by invaders in a changed water world outside. Our guides call this place
  an ark, in a determined belief that, one day, white-claws will reclaim a
  future beyond. One by one, we pull on the strings that draw artificial refuge
  traps up from deep below. These are racks of tubular black pipes in different
  diameters with one end open, each designed to suit crayfish large, medium or
  small. The animals shelter here by day, squeezing in hermit-crab-like, tail
  first. The fished-out traps have caught silt, sticks, waterweed and zebra
  mussels, but crayfish there are none. Until the very last chamber. She plops
  into an orange bucket, lobster-petite, and quickly sets off to explore. Her
  dainty pincers are more nail clippers than bolt cutters, held either side of
  her snout, nudging forward alternately almost piston-like. Four pairs of legs
  behind give her a scuttle-shuffle motion, until expert Jen lifts her by the
  abdomen between thumb and forefinger for measurement by callipers. She is the
  most docile and obliging of animals, even when she is turned over to be sexed.
  Not yet ready to breed, shell about to be shed. Later today, in the river
  close by, we will find snapping furies, the American signal crayfish that are
  bigger, predatory, and prolific breeders; carriers but not catchers of
  disease. But here at least, she is safe, secure in her ark. • Under the
