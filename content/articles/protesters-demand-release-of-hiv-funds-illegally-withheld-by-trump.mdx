  As Congress reconvened on Tuesday, activists gathered near the White House to
  protest against cuts to global HIV funding, calling attention to funds they
  say are being withheld illegally by the Trump administration despite being
  appropriated by Congress. The end of the fiscal year 2025 is 30 September,
  which means the majority of the withheld federal funds will disappear. The
  activists called for the release of the funding for programs such as Pepfar
  (the President’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief), a program established in
  2003 that has saved an estimated 26 million lives around the world and
  promised to help bring the HIV epidemic to an end. An estimated 450,000 people
  have died because of the abrupt cuts to the United States Agency for
  International Development (USAID). Millions have paused or ended taking the
  medications that either keep them from getting HIV or keep the virus from
  progressing and becoming infectious again. “The funding is there. The global
  health programs that have been shuttered, Congress has funded them … but OMB
  is not permitting it to be spent. They are impounding those funds,” said Atul
  Gawande, the former assistant administrator for global health at USAID, who
  spoke at the protest. “That is not legal.” The activists marched to the office
  of the General Services Administration wearing masks and holding signs
  depicting the face of Russell Vought, the head of the office of management and
  budget (OMB). They blocked traffic by sitting and lying in the intersection
  outside the building where Vought works. As horns honked, one man leapt from
  his car to confront a protester. The protest came at a particularly fraught
  moment in Washington DC, which for several weeks has been occupied by local
  and out-of-state national guardsmen as well as federal agents. “It’s been
  surreal seeing the national guard come through the neighborhoods,” said
  Gawande, who lives in DC. The risks of protest and civil disobedience are
  heightened because “anything could happen”. But, he said, it was important to
  speak out about the illegal withholding of congressionally appropriated funds.
  In the past, progress on HIV had moved forward because of actions like this,
  Gawande said. “And that’s where we are again.” The OMB did not respond to the
  Guardian’s questions about how much funding for Pepfar remained and whether it
  is legal to impound funds in this way. “The administration has not obligated
  (let alone disbursed) much of the funding that has been appropriated for
  Pepfar,” said Jen Kates, senior vice-president and director of the global
  health &amp; HIV policy program at KFF, a non-partisan health organization.
  There is a formal process for rescinding funds like this, “but OMB has not
  submitted such a request”, she said. In July, Donald Trump submitted a request
  to rescind $9bn in funding that Congress had already set aside for foreign aid
  and broadcasting programs. The request included a $400m cut to Pepfar – but
  while lawmakers agreed to other cuts, they protected Pepfar. “Russ Vought is
  defying the will of Congress. He’s breaking the law,” said Asia Russell,
  executive director of Health Gap and one of the protest organizers, calling
  the impediments on funds “illegal and unprecedented”. In places like Kenya,
  Uganda and South Africa, people working on Pepfar programs have been told to
  cut their budgets by half, she said. “This was their strategy from the
  beginning: delay the release of funds until the clock of the fiscal year comes
  up. It’s a bomb,” Russell said. “It’s happening without any ability to track.”
  Jerilyn Hoover, a nurse, worked on Pepfar for five years before she was
  terminated in sweeping staffing cuts earlier this year. At the protest, she
  pushed her sleeping daughter in a stroller. The program she worked on
  supported more than 300,000 global health workers. When many of them lost
  their jobs overnight, they couldn’t bear to think about seeing the members of
  the communities they had supported with HIV treatment for so long. They were
  “forced to watch those same people show up to clinics that were closed or go
  without their needed medications”, Hoover said. “We got reports of health
  workers who committed suicide,” she said. Rebecca Denison, who learned she was
  HIV-positive 42 years ago, attended the protest with her partner. Preventive
  measures like medications that lower the virus to undetectable levels have
  meant that her partner has stayed HIV-negative for four decades. Though they
  had thought they might never have children, their twins were born healthy 29
  years ago. The same preventive measures that kept her partner and children
  from contracting HIV have now been yanked away from other families, she said.
  “I feel the responsibility to show up for everyone to have the opportunities
  we’ve had,” Denison said. The Trump administration reportedly drafted plans to
  kill Pepfar entirely. “I sincerely believe that they picked foreign aid on
  purpose as what they thought would be a soft target to try out shredding these
  norms,” Russell said. “Actually, foreign aid is a kitchen table issue. This is
  not a distraction. This is a real thing, causing real harm.” Kates noted that
  “numerous studies have shown that Pepfar has saved millions of lives and is
  also associated with significant improvement in broader health and non-health
  outcomes.” “Reducing funding in an abrupt way will affect the ability to end
  HIV and dampen success in other areas,” Kates added. In Mozambique, there has
  been a decline in testing infants who were exposed to HIV through pregnancy,
  birth and breastfeeding. Infants with HIV who cannot get treatment have a 50%
  chance of dying before their second birthday. In Zimbabwe, HIV mortality may
  soar. In South Africa, there are declines in diagnosis and new initiations of
  HIV treatment. In Nairobi, two patients died after their doctors were ordered
  to stop working during the USAID pause, Atul Gawande said on Tuesday. The
  patients had opportunistic infections because of HIV/Aids; when they could no
  longer receive antibiotics for the infections, they died. “The administration
  continues to deny that dismantling assistance for health and public health
  systems costs lives,” Gawande said. “They believe these lives won’t matter to
  anybody. “Tell me: will you bear witness?” he asked the crowd.
