  In the early 1990s, Naomi Stadlen was attending an event at the Freud Museum
  in London, where her husband, Anthony, was a research fellow, and someone
  asked her what she did. “Nothing,” she replied, “I just bring up our
  children.” Naomi had sold herself short, and she ruminated on this for a long
  time after the event. In 2004, she brought out her first book, What Mothers
  Do, Especially When It Looks Like Nothing, in direct reference to that
  original exchange and her answer. Subsequently described by Anne Karpf in a
  Guardian review as the “best parenting book you’ve never heard of”, the book
  became a bestseller, was translated into multiple languages and has been
  described, by many mothers over the years, as a life saver. In a sea of books
  about training children that often set parents up for failure, Naomi wrote
  about listening and trusting both yourself as a mother and your child. She
  went on to write four more books: two about mothering, one about
  “grandmothering”, and A Grand Quarrel: Elizabeth Gaskell, Florence Nightingale
  and Mothers Today, which was published posthumously. Naomi, who has died aged
  82, was, as well as an author, an existential psychotherapist and a
  breastfeeding counsellor for La Leche League. Prior to all that, she worked as
  a social worker, occupational therapist and a book editor. But her most
  important role was probably as a mother. Naomi felt mothering was undervalued
  and under-praised; even the verb, she noted, was not much used and often
  replaced with the more catch-all term “parenting”. She was born in London, to
  German Jewish refugees who had escaped the Gestapo. Some of her first memories
  were of air raids and her parents in their gas masks. When Naomi was two years
  old, and in the same week that her brother, Ben, was born, her father, Hans
  Jacoby, a graphologist (a scholar of handwriting), who was training to be a
  psychotherapist, died of a heart attack in the street. Naomi was alone with
  him until help came, an event that traumatised her. Her mother, Marianne (nee
  Goldschmidt), also a graphologist, was left with two young children, 10
  shillings and very little support. She did not remarry. “I didn’t have any
  experience of fathers,” Naomi said, “but when we [she and Anthony] had
  children I realised how desperately important fathers are.” Marianne went on
  to train and practise as a Jungian analyst. She lived long enough to see
  Naomi’s first book published, although was dismissive of parts of it, saying:
  “Will it make me feel guilty?” When I first interviewed Naomi, in 2011, I
  asked her why she had wanted to write about mothers. “I come,” she said, “from
  a line of problematic mothers.” After Town and Country school in Hampstead,
  and sixth form at the North London Collegiate school, Naomi studied European
  history at the University of Sussex. She trained as a psychoanalytic
  counsellor at Goldsmiths, University of London before becoming an existential
  therapist in private practice, working largely with mothers and couples. In
  the 60s she worked as an editor for Penguin and Hutchinson, and in 1968 she
  met Anthony Stadlen, a psychoanalyst and researcher, whom she later married
  and with whom she would have three children. She also taught and supervised
  doctoral psychotherapy students at the New School of Psychotherapy and
  Counselling in London, and taught trainee counsellors and psychotherapists at
  the University of North East London and Birkbeck College. In 1990 she accepted
  an invitation from Janet Balaskas of the Active Birth Centre in north London
  to start holding weekly meetings for mothers to talk about how their week had
  gone. This group became Mothers Talking, which provided rich fodder for her
  books and gave her an insight into what issues concerned mothers, as well as
  bringing immense comfort to its members. Mothers Talking continued for 35
  years, without a break, even during the pandemic (when it transferred on to
  Zoom). The last meeting was held just a few weeks before Naomi died. Mothers
  talked of how kind Naomi was, how curious. “She wanted us to learn from one
  another,” one said, “she wanted us to feel safe, seen and held.” The author
  and psychotherapist Philippa Perry credits Naomi with being a “huge influence
  on my work as a therapist,” and how she rang La Leche League’s helpline one
  day when she was having issues breastfeeding her daughter. “It was Naomi on
  the other end. I told her my baby was biting me while breastfeeding and Naomi
  said to give the baby 100% attention when feeding her. It’s true I had been
  reading magazines and books rather than staring into the eyes of my baby. I
  reverted to doing that and the biting stopped.” Naomi believed babies were
  communicating with their mothers from the very beginning. In order to break
  family patterns, she wanted to “prove that you could bring up children in a
  trusting way, and they were worthy of that trust. Mothering is a real
  communication between two people.” I once asked her if she’d succeeded in her
  own family. “I think so,” she said, “but let’s ask my daughter Rachel.”
  Unfortunately Rachel had gone out on that occasion, but years later I was able
  to ask her the same question. “I was always a real person to her,” she said,
  “with my own thoughts and ideas. She took me seriously and listened. If I was
  unhappy, she respected my feelings and addressed them, even when it put her in
  the most awkward social situations.” I knew Naomi professionally and also, for
  a brief time, as my therapist. Although she was deeply thoughtful, she could
  occasionally be quite shockingly emphatic and outspoken, more so than almost
  any other therapist I have worked with. Few could touch her for truly
  brilliant insights. When I saw her as a therapist she minced no words. There
  was none of that “well, what do you think?” or “let’s reframe that” – she
  sliced through my problems with surgical precision. When I interviewed her
  once at her home, she asked if her husband could sit in on the interview (I
  was not the only journalist she asked this of), with a stack of books at her
  feet in case I asked her something she needed to look up. I told her I felt
  she often hid behind other people’s words, unnecessarily, when her own were so
  good. After she was diagnosed with cancer she decided to be more assertive and
  use her time left to make her voice heard. Some of the things she said to me I
  carry with me every day. The most valuable – “the only correct response to new
  information is curiosity, anything else is about you” – was a genius way to
  describe projection. What Mothers Do has a chapter about how mothers are
  instantly (and I would add constantly) interruptible and rarely an hour passes
  when I don’t think of this. Naomi is survived by Anthony and their children,
  Rachel, Shoël and Darrel, three grandchildren, Tovi, Anya and Antoshka, and
  two step-grandchildren, Lily and Florence. • Naomi Stadlen, psychotherapist
  and author, born 25 November 1942; died 6 June 2025
