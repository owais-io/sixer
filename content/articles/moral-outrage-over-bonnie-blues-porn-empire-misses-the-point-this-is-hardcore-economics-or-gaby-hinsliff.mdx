  Bonnie Blue has sex with men on camera for money. Lots of men one after the
  other, to be precise, for lots and lots of money: the commercial niche she
  invented to distinguish herself from countless other amateur porn stars
  jostling desperately for attention on OnlyFans was inviting “barely legal”
  ordinary teenage boys (which in porn means 18-plus) to have sex with her on
  film, and flogging the results to paying subscribers for a fortune. Unusually,
  her model involves a woman making millions out of men generating content for
  free, which makes it slightly harder than usual to work out exactly who is
  exploiting whom if she turns up (as she did in Nottingham) at a university
  freshers’ week with a sign saying “bonk me and let me film it”. But debating
  whether getting rich this way makes Bonnie personally “empowered” seems tired
  and pointless. It was with this old pseudo-feminist chestnut that Channel 4
  justified last week’s ratings-chasing documentary on her attempt to sleep with
  1,000 men in 12 hours, a film that finally brought her into the cultural
  mainstream. There’s more to this story than sex, gender politics or Bonnie
  herself, and whatever is driving her (which she swears isn’t past trauma,
  “daddy issues” over a biological father she never knew, or anything else
  you’re thinking: though she does say maybe her brain works differently from
  other people’s, given her curious ability to switch off her emotions). It’s at
  heart a story about money, the merging of the oldest trade in the world with a
  newer attention economy inexorably geared towards rewarding extremes, and what
  that does to the society that unwittingly produced it. As her now-estranged
  husband explained admiringly to camera, though OnlyFans performers often
  invite a man to imagine he’s doing whatever he wants to them, that’s an
  illusion: really they’re out of reach. But Bonnie (real name Tia Billinger)
  isn’t. She actively encourages her fans to come and do it to her for real. She
  is the parasocial relationship – that strange confusion created when you think
  you know someone because you’ve seen so much of their life unfold on your
  phone screen, though in reality they’re a stranger – taken to its fantasy
  conclusion: a stalker’s dream made flesh. Like what you see? Then just reach
  through the screen and grab it. Bonnie/Tia comes across essentially as a
  female Andrew Tate, telling teenage or otherwise vulnerable audiences that
  they have a right to sex – in one video urging men not to feel guilty about
  taking part in her stunts, she says it’s only what they were “owed”, the
  language of the incel forum – and that it’s hot to be slapped around or
  degraded; but, unlike Tate, with the apparent authority of actually being a
  woman herself. Channel 4 filmed the men queueing up to join her 1,000-men
  stunt mostly as a line of mute, anonymous shuffling feet. But we already know
  that watching near-ubiquitous porn online has changed the way younger
  generations have sex. What does being invited into the picture do? No wonder
  Ofcom is taking an interest, while the children’s commissioner for England,
  Rachel de Souza, warns against TV normalising things that – as she put it –
  teenagers find “frightening, confusing and damaging to their relationships”.
  Ironically, the biggest short-term beneficiary of such a storm may be
  Bonnie/Tia herself, already a dab hand at posting rage-bait videos expertly
  calibrated to provoke women who already can’t stand her (and are willing to
  explain why at length to their own followers on their own social media
  channels). Being hated is great for business, she explains chirpily: the more
  women publicly denounce her, the more their sons and husbands will Google her.
  Her real skill is in monetising both lust and rage, crossing the internet’s
  two most powerful streams to capture its most lucrative currency: attention.
  “She’s a marketing genius,” her female publicist tells Channel 4, laughing as
  the team discuss how best to commercially exploit footage of an appalled
  mother trying to retrieve her son from one of Bonnie/Tia’s filmed orgies.
  OnlyFans performers can’t advertise as a normal business would, so they
  promote themselves by seeding clips across social media, ideally of them doing
  something wild enough to go viral: since people get bored easily, the pressure
  is always on to keep getting wilder and wilder, pushing way past whatever you
  thought were your limits. That has long been the trajectory of porn stars’
  careers, of course. But it’s also recognisably now true of so much
  contemporary culture, from fully clothed influencers to reality TV shows
  forced to introduce ever more cruel plot twists to stop the formula getting
  stale (this year’s Love Island has noticeably morphed from dating show into a
  kind of brutal sexual Hunger Games), and arguably even broadcasters such as
  Channel 4 fighting desperately for audience share in a world of almost
  infinite competition for eyeballs. When I finish watching 1000 Men and Me: The
  Bonnie Blue Story on catchup, the channel’s algorithm perkily suggests an
  episode of Sex Actually with Alice Levine. Like the sexy stuff? Want more?
  Please don’t leave me for YouTube! As with Tate, if Bonnie was somehow shut
  down there would be another one along soon enough. She’s a feature, not a bug,
  the inevitable product of an economy relentlessly geared to giving an audience
  what it most reliably pays for – to feel angry or horny, or both at once – and
  then endlessly pushing its luck. But society does still have some limits to
  impose on what is in the end just another business model. Her current nemesis
  is Visa, which processes OnlyFans payments and which she says declined to be
  associated with her 1,000-man marathon, leading to her being banned from
  uploading it and cashing in. (Legislators have long regarded mainstream
  financial services companies on whom porn sites rely to rake in their profits
  as the crack in their armour, more susceptible to public opinion and
  regulatory pressure.) Meanwhile, a new taskforce on pornography headed by the
  Tory peer Gabby Bertin, who formerly worked for David Cameron in Downing
  Street, is arguing for a ban on content likely to encourage child sexual abuse
  – which Bertin argues could encompass “barely legal” material or (as Bonnie
  has also experimented with doing, as her options narrowed) casting grown porn
  actors as schoolgirls. Like Labour’s battle against Page 3 girls in the 1990s,
  which in retrospect seems an astonishingly innocent era, if ministers want to
  pick this fight with porn it will be brutal. But doing nothing might, in the
  end, be more so. Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist Do you have an opinion
