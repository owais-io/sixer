  Ordinary Decent Criminal review – Mark Thomas powers through tense prison

  There is an alarming sense of cogs being wound in this prison drama by Ed
  Edwards. It is set in a fancy new Manchester nick where conditions are
  uncommonly good: a 25-day riot in the notoriously crowded Strangeways has
  fast-tracked the introduction of a softly-softly regime. There is one man to a
  cell, so tensions should be minimised, and only troublemakers are subject to
  frequent searches. Yet every time Edwards introduces a new inmate, he takes us
  one step closer to catastrophe. It is like a laboratory experiment in which a
  mad scientist adds unstable chemicals to a test tube and turns on the Bunsen
  burner. The steadiest element is Frankie Donnelly, a recovering addict who is
  in for three-and-a-half years for importing drugs disguised as bars of
  chocolate. On his side is an even temper, a typewriter and a history of
  political activism; beyond that, he is at the mercy of his fellow inmates.
  They include Kenny, a vulnerable and volatile victim of sexual abuse; Robert,
  a “white Muslim” drug lord; Bron, a former British soldier with a lethal form
  of PTSD; and Tommy, who may or may not be an IRA operative. Placating one
  could trigger another. A chain reaction seems inevitable. Amusingly, Edwards
  plays against the tension as well as leaning into it. With the audience on
  tenterhooks, a whimper can be as much fun as a bang. None of these men is
  precisely the monster you expect. There is humanity, tenderness and care even
  in this brutal environment. The playwright could find no better interpreter
  than Mark Thomas, extending a relationship that began with England &amp; Son,
  a play that managed to make a link between juvenile offending and colonialism.
  Strident and demonstrative, he powers his way through the script under the
  direction of Charlotte Bennett for Paines Plough, ratcheting up the stakes and
  jumping brilliantly from scouse narco to Belfast terrorist or bent screw to
  create a distinct and distinctly dangerous set of characters. Behind the time
  bomb humour lies a subtle analysis of the social and cultural reasons these
  damaged men are behind bars. They are not innocent, exactly, but men swept up
  in forces beyond their control. • At Summerhall, Edinburgh, until 25 August •
