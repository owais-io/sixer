  Donald Trump has threatened to use “every tool in our arsenal” to crack down
  on pharmaceutical giants if they fail to cut drug prices for Americans within
  60 days. The president wrote to executives at 17 companies on Thursday,
  demanding they match their US prices for prescription drugs with the lowest
  price offered in other developed nations. Current prices were an “unacceptable
  burden” on US families, Trump said, claiming they could be up to three times
  higher than in other countries. After returning to the White House earlier
  this year and pledging to bring down drug prices, the president claimed that
  “most proposals” from the pharmaceutical industry amounted to “more of the
  same”, accusing firms of seeking to shift blame and requesting policies that
  would pave the way for handouts worths billions of dollars for the sector.
  “Make no mistake: a collaborative effort towards achieving global pricing
  parity would be the most effective path for companies, the government, and
  American patients,” Trump wrote. “But if you refuse to step up we will deploy
  every tool in our arsenal to protect American families from continued abusive
  drug pricing practices. “Americans are demanding lower drug prices, and they
  need them today.” The bosses of Pfizer, AstraZeneca and GSK were among those
  who received the letters. GSK did not respond to requests for comment.
  AstraZeneca declined to comment. Pfizer said: “Pfizer is working closely with
  the Trump administration and Congress on solutions that will increase access
  and affordability for American patients and enhance the power of the
  biopharmaceutical innovation ecosystem in the United States. Our discussions
  have been productive.” Shares in Pfizer slipped 2%, AstraZeneca fell 3.8% and
  GSK dropped 3.9% during afternoon trading in New York. At the heart of of
  Trump’s proposal is a status known as “Most Favored Nation”, through which he
  wants to bind the cost of medications sold in the US to the lowest prices paid
  elsewhere. The White House is demanding that pharmaceutical companies extend
  this to drugs used by older people through the government-backed Medicaid
  health program, as well as new drugs.
