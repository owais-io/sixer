  Australia see a similar slump?

  At the start of 2022, the typical house in Australia and Canada was worth
  about $840,000 in each country’s local currency. Australian city prices have
  climbed by about A$85,000 over the subsequent three years, while Canadian
  prices have crashed by C$150,000, leaving the median Canadian home nearly 20%
  cheaper. The Canadian correction has raised questions over whether properties
  in Australia, economically comparable to its Commonwealth comrade, could face
  a similar selldown. Overheated demand Borrowers in both countries enjoyed low
  interest rates in 2020 and 2021, driving up prices. Australia’s most expensive
  city, Sydney, saw median values surge A$250,000 from 2020 to early 2022,
  reaching nearly A$1.2m. Overheated demand drove prices far higher in Toronto,
  Canada’s biggest city, up by A$400,000 to a peak of C$1.3m over the same
  period, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA). Canada’s
  central bank responded by ratcheting up interest rates while the government
  banned foreign buyers and curbed immigration, sending prices into freefall.
  Toronto’s median price fell below C$1.1m and is yet to recover. Toronto’s
  pandemic buying boom saw home sales surge in 2021 then halve by 2023 as high
  numbers of homes arrived on the market simultaneously, further dragging down
  prices. Demand slumped further as locals fled Toronto for more affordable
  towns with the advent of remote work. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Tyson
  Erlick’s landlord clients at Property Management Toronto had been excited by
  surging home prices back in 2021. One investor paid C$1m for a sub-50 square
  metre flat in downtown Toronto’s Yorkville neighbourhood that’s now worth
  about C$700,000. “We’re seeing a lot of landlords panic,” Erlick said. “You’re
  now looking at a mega loss.” Sydney endured a brief slump but resumed its
  upward climb by early 2023, with rents and home prices rising as a growing
  population grappled with a shortage of homes. Rents in Toronto, already
  constrained by local government rent caps, have fallen on average since 2023.
  Homebuyers are taking out smaller mortgages on houses and apartments, or
  condominiums, as they are called in Canada. Greater Toronto resident Dave, who
  lives 70km from the city centre, bought a condo for a $100,000 discount in
  July 2024 after the previous owners struggled to sell. “There are so many
  condominiums that they can’t sell,” said Dave, who asked for his surname not
  to be shared. “We were lucky.” Rate rises The improved affordability in Canada
  has raised the prospect a similar slump could happen in Australia. Both
  countries saw a rare nationwide price drop when interest rate hikes in 2022
  limited borrowing power, though Australians faced slower and smaller rate
  increases. Along with surging migration and strong job creation, smaller rate
  hikes kept Australian prices from falling more than 10%, according to Eliza
  Owen, head of research at property data firm Cotality. “As long as Australians
  can keep paying their mortgage and they don’t have to sell, that will always
  restrict supply [and] limit the amount that property values can fall,” she
  said. Australian home values have kept rising through 2025, up 3.7% in the
  year to July according to Cotality, and Commonwealth Bank analysts predict
  that pace will reach 6% by December. An economic shock and blowout in the
  unemployment rate would be a direct but damaging way for that momentum to
  reverse, Owen said. “That technically would make housing cheaper, but it
  doesn’t necessarily make housing more affordable if a crash is coming
  alongside severe economic downturn [and] people really can’t afford to buy,”
  she said. Donald Trump’s tariff threats, for example, have prolonged Canada’s
  crash by pushing more Canadians out of work, leaving buyers without incomes
  and unable to pay off their mortgages. Data released at the end of July showed
  Canada’s economic activity had fallen for two consecutive months as it
  grappled with US trade chaos. The same day, Trump lifted tariff rates on
  Canadian goods from 25% to 35%. The number of unemployed Canadians reached 1.6
  million and the national unemployment rate climbed to 7% in May, from 5% in
  early 2023. The share of Canadians more than 90 days behind on mortgage
  repayments remains small but has doubled since 2022, much faster than in
  Australia. Tariffs have had a muted impact on the Australian economy, where
  the jobs market remains robust, unemployment has only risen to 4.3% and
  mortgage arrears remain at modest levels. While Sydney’s unemployment rate
  remains low, at 4.5%, Toronto’s is nearly double that, approaching 9%, leaving
  fewer locals with the incomes to take advantage of a slight improvement on the
  city’s still-unaffordable homes, according to the renters advocate Bruno
  Dobrusin. “The vast majority are still struggling with increasing rents,
  without the capacity to benefit from the slowdown of home prices,” said
  Dobrusin, organiser at the York South-Weston neighbourhood’s tenant union.
  Housing in both countries is already too far out of reach for price
  corrections to help affordability, according to Carolyn Whitzman, a housing
  researcher and adjunct professor at the University of Toronto. “It is nice to
  see a little bit of a correction in what has been such a steady and
  frightening upward climb,” said Whitzman, who has lived in Toronto and
  Melbourne. “[But] if a house is 300% too expensive, and goes down by 20%, it
  still isn’t going to help you.” Economists do not expect a near-term slump in
  Australian house prices, which are accelerating amid rate cuts and supply
  shortages. While Canada’s temporary price correction will not solve its
  affordability, it should remind Australians real estate is not immune to a
  drop, Whitzman said. “Both Australia and Canada started to believe that it was
  impossible that house prices ever fall [but] at some point house prices have
  to fall,” Whitzman said.
