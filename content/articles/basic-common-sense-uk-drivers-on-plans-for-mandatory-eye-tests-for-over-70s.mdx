  Proposals, expected to be published as part of a road safety strategy in the
  autumn, could introduce a new requirement for over-70s to take an eye test
  every three years when they renew their driving licence. It is one of a number
  of measures proposed amid concern about the number of people being killed or
  seriously injured on Britain’s roads. Last year, 1,633 people were killed and
  almost 28,000 seriously injured in traffic incidents. Here, readers share
  their views on the planned mandatory eye tests. ‘I would hate myself if I
  caused an accident’ I totally agree with this proposed development as safety
  on the roads is paramount. We need to address avoidable risks. I now need
  glasses, which do give me a good quality of sight, but I would be grateful for
  reassurance that my sight is consistently good enough to drive. I would also
  approve of more rigorous tests for older drivers like myself. I find
  night-time driving on non-motorway roads more difficult than I did, and I am
  more likely to feel tired driving earlier in a journey than I did when I was
  younger. As older drivers, we should be prepared to demonstrate that we can
  drive safely on busy roads. I would hate myself if I caused an accident when I
  was later shown to be unfit physically or mentally to drive. I am responsible
  to all road users, including any passengers in my car. So definitely a
  thumbs-up to this move. Charlie Beaumont, 70, retired, Penrith, Cumbria ‘I
  don’t think I should have been driving’ I think it is a good idea. Last year I
  went for an eye test. I was immediately referred for cataract operations in
  both eyes. After the operations, I realised how bad my eyesight had been. I
  don’t think I should have been driving. Cliff Edwards, 83, West Sussex ‘My
  issue is with the young drivers who speed’ I think an eye test is a good idea.
  I’ve been a safe driver since the age of 16. I have my eyes tested every two
  years. My issue is the young drivers who speed. It seems backwards to assume
  older drivers are the problem when, statistically, isn’t it the younger
  drivers causing the deaths? Dotty, 76, retired, Norfolk ‘Younger people can
  also develop eyesight problems’ Regular eye tests for drivers are a good idea,
  but starting at any specific age is arbitrary. Younger people can also develop
  eyesight problems. I myself started to need glasses in my 30s. Had I ignored
  the problem, I would have been as much of a danger then as I would be if I
  didn’t have regular eye tests now. Jeff, 70, retired software developer,
  Wokingham, Berkshire ‘Offer affordable public transport options’ I’m amazed
  it’s not already a requirement. Gradual eyesight loss is not always noticed,
  and when noticed, older car-dependent people do not always act on it. It would
  be a less unpopular requirement if accompanied by affordable public transport
  options, for example, easy-to-access mini buses that pick up and drop off at
  people’s doors. Jill, 70, Bracknell, Berkshire ‘A compulsory test would have
  removed the acrimony’ Absolutely a must. My mother (over – 90 now and still
  alive) has macular degeneration (both wet and dry), which affected her sight
  years ago. She continued to drive in spite of her family’s pleas. I understood
  why: she was the sole carer of an Alzheimer’s patient. But it was still
  dangerous for everyone. A compulsory eye test would have removed the acrimony
  that arose from family members telling her she needed to relinquish her
  driving licence. Margaret, Kent ‘It should be a requirement for all drivers’
  As set out, this is ageism. I totally agree that there should be compulsory
  eye tests for drivers, but it should be a requirement for all drivers.
  Eyesight can fail at any age. Also, this is the stick, where is the carrot?
  Where is the better public transport to allow those who lose the ability to
  drive to get around, or are we planning to trap them in their homes? Steve
  Trigg, 62, Reigate, Surrey ‘There should be hazard perception tests as well’
  This is basic common sense. Along with eye tests, there ought to be hazard
  perception tests and reaction speed tests. I realise that for many elderly
  people, driving is one of the last independent things they can do, but really,
  who wouldn’t want to be safe on the roads? It’s selfish to think otherwise.
  Anonymous ‘There should also be an online test to pick up Highway Code
  changes’ As someone about to turn 61 next month, I fully support the
  initiative of mandatory eye testing for the over-70s, but I think a further
  shake-up of road safety should also be considered. First of all, why just
  leave it at over-70s? As we have to renew our licences every 10 years, it
  should be a part of the renewal process and should include an online test to
  pick up changes within the Highway Code. In 2022, there were significant
  changes, and yet most motoring surveys showed that the majority of drivers
  were unaware or were even going to make themselves aware. Paul, 60, Lincoln
