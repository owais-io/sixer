  Women with children earn £302 less every week than men with children:
  one-third less per week and almost 20% less per hour, according to analysis
  based on ONS data. This means that Mums’ Equal Pay Day falls on 1 September
  this year, almost three months earlier than Equal Pay Day for all women. From
  this date, mothers are working for free for the rest of the year compared with
  fathers. “The reason the gender pay gap worsens so significantly after having
  children is because starting a family has a disproportionately negative impact
  on women’s earnings,” said Joeli Brearley, the founder of Growth Spurt, an
  online back-to-work scheme for parents. The analysis has been acknowledged as
  accurate by the Office for National Statistics. But the picture is really much
  worse, said Brearley, because it does not account for the many parents who
  become economically inactive owing to their caring responsibilities. “Yet we
  know that women are much more likely to have been forced to leave their jobs
  due to childcare costs, maternity discrimination and a lack of suitable
  flexible working,” she said. Pregnancy and maternity discrimination remain
  widespread: every year, about 74,000 women are forced to leave their jobs
  simply for getting pregnant or taking maternity leave, according to earlier
  analysis by Brearley. “The majority of mothers say they’ve faced some form of
  discrimination or disadvantage as a result of taking maternity leave, from
  missed promotions to being sidelined at work,” she said. The cost and
  availability of childcare are still major barriers to women continuing work or
  taking up promotions, while the flexible and part-time roles many mothers need
  to balance work and care are too often low-paid and offer limited
  opportunities for progression. Since women are more likely to request flexible
  working, Brearley said, they disproportionately bear the career penalty
  attached to these roles. “And finally, our outdated parental leave system
  reinforces gendered expectations: mothers are encouraged, and often expected,
  to take extended time off, while fathers return to work quickly. This not only
  entrenches the idea that caregiving is ‘women’s work’, but also means men’s
  careers continue to progress while women’s stall,” she said. Penny East, the
  chief executive of the Fawcett Society, which calculates the annual Equal Pay
  Day, welcomed the analysis. “It’s significant that Mums’ Equal Pay Day falls
  so much earlier than Equal Pay Day,” she said. “Motherhood can create a
  financial cliff edge for many women. It’s also worth remembering that for many
  women the motherhood penalty and the gender pay gap conspire to create a
  pension pay gap, which pushes many women into pension poverty later in life,”
  she added. “There is no good reason for any pay gap to exist and government
  and employers must do more to level the playing field for all women at every
  stage of our lives.” Dr Mary-Ann Stephenson, the director of the Women’s
  Budget Group, said: “The research highlights how the earnings gap really opens
  up when women become mothers. “We have a leave system which reinforces the
  gendered division of unpaid care, meaning that even couples who intend to
  share care more equally than their parents find that women are still the
  default parent. “It’s really important that the government’s review of
  parental leave recognises how the current system is bad for everyone, and
  makes the reforms needed to allow parents to share both paid and unpaid work
  more fairly,” she said.
