  Good morning. Israel’s military has announced it is expanding its offensive in
  Gaza City as Benjamin Netanyahu ordered generals to accelerate “the defeat of
  Hamas”. In Australia, a leading doctor and public critic of Israel has stepped
  down from chairing a medical insurance provider. We look at what Jason Clare
  has to do to fix childcare at tomorrow’s meeting with state ministers, a US
  judge rules the Epstein files must remain sealed, and how a French
  live-streamer has died live online. Australia Flood warning | People in New
  South Wales have been warned to “stay ready and stay safe” as another bout of
  intense rainfall hits the state, bringing possible floods. Doctor’s call |
  High-profile emergency physician Dr Stephen Parnis has stepped down as chair
  of the board of a leading medical insurance provider in an apparent response
  to concerns about statements he has made on social media opposing the war in
  Gaza. Childcare crunch | As the education minister, Jason Clare, prepares to
  meet his state counterparts today to discuss reforms to the childcare sector,
  Kate Lyons traces how – despite review after review making recommendations to
  the government – little has been done to create a proper national system of
  regulation. Netanyahu ‘inflammatory’ | Australia’s peak Jewish group has
  lambasted Benjamin Netanyahu for his attack on Anthony Albanese as
  “inflammatory and provocative”, adding that it showed a “woeful lack of
  understanding of social and political conditions in Australia”. Emmanuel
  Macron has described as “abject” Netanyahu’s claims of an antisemitic surge in
  France. Winter’s over | Tasmanian Labor has replaced Dean Winter as
  parliamentary leader, with Josh Willie elected unopposed to serve as the
  state’s new opposition leader after a failed bid to unseat the premier, Jeremy
  Rockliff. World Epstein ruling | A federal judge in New York who presided over
  the sex-trafficking case against the late financier Jeffrey Epstein has
  rejected the government’s request to unseal grand jury transcripts. Israel
  offensive | Israel has announced it is expanding its military operation in
  Gaza City as Benjamin Netanyahu said the aim was to speed up the timetable
  “for seizing control of the last terrorist strongholds and the defeat of
  Hamas”. In the UK, a court heard that the terror charge brought against the
  Kneecap rapper Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh for flying the Hezbollah flag should be
  thrown out. Moscow red line | Moscow has said it must be part of any
  international talks on Ukraine’s security as Russia continues to stall on
  Donald Trump’s push for a meeting between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy. We’re looking at what it all means for the prospects of peace in
  Ukraine. Online death | French authorities are investigating the death of a
  man during a live video stream on the Kick platform, where he had regularly
  been shown enduring violence and humiliation. Lai trial | A lawyer for Jimmy
  Lai has argued that it is not wrong to support freedom of expression as he
  began his final argument in the Hong Kong democracy activist and newspaper
  founder’s landmark national security trial. Full Story Can the government keep
  kids safe in childcare? After revelations about alleged abuse at childcare
  centres, Kate Lyons talks to Reged Ahmad about whether the government can
  restore faith in the sector. In-depth Discussion at today’s sessions of the
  government economic roundtable will be dominated by the thorny issue of tax:
  how much we should be paying, and which form that tax should take. Our
  economics editor, Patrick Commins, casts his expert eye over the key
  questions, while economist Nicki Hutley argues that the focus should really
  have been about creating an economy that’s good for everyone. Not the news The
  subject of Luke Buckmaster’s critical lens this week is Kangaroo Island, a
  relationship-centric family drama by first-time feature director Timothy
  David, starring Rebecca Breeds and set on the eponymous South Australian
  idyll. The landscape is something of scene-stealer in a “tonally uneven” film,
  but just when it seems destined for “Hallmarkian slosh” it has moments that
  resonate. Sport Tennis | On the eve of her final tournament, double Wimbledon
  champion and Australian Open finalist Petra Kvitova explains why she has no
  regrets about her career. Rugby union | The Wallaroos begin their World Cup
  campaign against Samoa in Manchester on Saturday night AEST and the young
  squad is hoping to spring a few surprises. Football | Experts are concerned
  that local laws are not robust enough to tackle illegal international online
  gambling on football, especially with the Women’s Asian Cup taking place in
  Australia next year. Media roundup The Telegraph highlights a “billion-dollar”
  spending spree by two cousins that could transform Sydney’s Hills district.
  The Adelaide Crows’ case against Izak Rankine’s ban has gone into overtime
  with the hearing delayed 24 hours, the Age reports. Tempers are at boiling
  point on the Gold Coast over increased parking charges at Burleigh Heads,
  according to the Bulletin. The Mercury looks at how the Tasmanian premier,
  Jeremy Rockliff, outmanoeuvred Labor “at every turn”. What’s happening today
  Business | Full-year earnings from Whitehaven, Domain and Star Entertainment
  Group. Brisbane | Pre-trial hearing begins for the Australian company charged
  with bribery over its conduct on Nauru a decade ago. Environment | AGL reveals
