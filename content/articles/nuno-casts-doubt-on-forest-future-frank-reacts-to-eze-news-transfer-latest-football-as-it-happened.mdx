  Notwithstanding any late nuggets o’news or the inevitable unveiling of
  Eberechi Eze as an Arsenal player approximately four minutes before I’m due to
  knock off for a rare weekend of leisure, that’s about it for today. Before I
  take the ball towards the corner flag in a shameless bid to run down the
  clock, here is a reminder of today’s best bits … Nuno Espírito Santo has cast
  doubt over his future after admitting “where there’s smoke, there’s fire” amid
  rumours about his job security and the detorioration of his relationship with
  the Nottingham Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis. “What it used to be was a
  good, respectful relationship, but was more based on trust and sharing
  opinions, and now it’s not so good,” he said. Mikel Arteta has said he doesn’t
  know the extent of the injury suffered by Kai Havertz this week and refused to
  discuss Arsenal’s acquisition of Eberechi Eze before the player’s transfer
  from Crystal Palace is officially signed, sealed and delivered. Thomas Frank
  insists Spurs never really fancied Eze anyway (OK, we may be paraphrasing) and
  said Richarlison is wanted at Spurs despite rumours the Brazilian is keen on a
  move elsewhere. Keith Andrews has refused to rule out the possibility of his
  want-away-to-Newcastle striker Yoane Wissa featuring in Brentford’s home match
  against Aston Villa. Brendan Rodgers has denied speculation that there is any
  sort of “conflict” between himself and the Celtic board over their apparent
  reluctance to dip into the club coffers and insists he will see out his
  contract, which is due to expire next June. Rúben Dias has signed a two-year
  contract extension with Manchester City that keeps him at the club until 2029
  or will greatly increase his value if they decide to ship him out. Eddie Howe
  has conceded “there’s been no change” in the impasse between Newcastle United
  and their disaffected striker Alexander Isak. “I think these situations are
  far from ideal,” he told reporters. West Ham have submitted a bid for Monaco
  midfielder Soungoutou Magassa. Sheffield Wednesday’s London-based supporters
  are planning a protest against the club’s owner, Dejphon Chansiri outside the
  Thai embassy, while their fellow Owls also plan to boycott the team’s match
  against Leeds at Hillsborough on Tuesday in the Carabao Cup. Championship side
  Ipswich have signed the Republic Of Ireland winger Kasey McAteer from rivals
  Leicester in a deal worth about £12m. Liverpool forward Lewis Koumas is close
  to agreeing a loan move to Championship promotion hopefuls Birmingham City
  after spending last season on loan at Stoke City. Nottingham Forest confirmed
  the signing of Douglas Luiz from Juventus on a season-long loan with a
  conditional obligation to make the deal permanent next summer. Sheffield
  United have brought in the former Norwich and Everton centre-back Ben Godfrey
  on a season-long loan from Atalanta. And Marseille coach Roberto De Zerbi has
  described the dressing-room scrap that took place between Jonathan Rowe and
  Adrien Rabiot following last weekend’s defeat against Rennes as being like “a
  bar fight” and “a fight like I’ve never seen in all my years in football”.
  Both players have since been suspended by the club and placed on the transfer
  list. West Ham v Chelsea: Following a defeat against Sunderland last weekend
  in which many of their players looked worryingly unmotivated and off the pace,
  West Ham host Chelsea tonight at the London Stadium. If you can’t watch the
  game, Scott Murray will be bringing you minute-by-minute coverage on the
  Guardian website and even you can see it, his unique and pithy stylings ought
  to add to the gaiety of the evening. Tune in!!! Tottenham Hotspurned: “If it’s
  any consolation to gazumped Spurs fans, former Tottenham winger Lucas Moura
  put a penalty past former Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina in São Paulo FC’s
  second-leg shootout win over Colombia’s Atletico Nacional in a Copa
  Libertadores Round-of-16 tie earlier this week,” writes Peter Oh, who fails to
  add that the hot-headed former Rangers striker Alfredo Morelos scored in the
  90 minutes for Atletico, who went on to lose on penalties, and somehow didn’t
  get himself sent off. Fitba mailbag: “Having listened to Brendan Rodgers’
  interview on Sportsound after the Kairat game, my hot take is that he and/or
  Russell Martin might be gone come January – Martin given the boot and Rodgers
  ejecting his toys from the pram again,” writes James Humphries, offering a
  take so cold his fingers probably froze just typing it. “He said ‘Not for me
  to say [about whether fans are right to be annoyed]’ and ‘there’s only so many
  ways to dress up ‘we need players’, which sounds to me a hell of a lot like
  someone preparing to pee off in high dudgeon.” Marseille: The French club’s
  head coach Roberto De Zerbi has provided some tremendously entertaining
  insight into the dressing-room scrap between teammates Adrien Rabiot and
  Jonathan Rowe which took place after Marseille’s opening day defeat at Rennes
  last weekend and led to both players being suspended by their employers and
  placed on the transfer list. “I ask you this, what happens if, at your
  workplace, two people, two employees, two workers, two lawyers, get into a
  fight?” said De Zerbi, upon being asked why both players had been told to
  leave the club. “It was a bar fight, in front of the sporting director, in
  front of the coach, with a team-mate on the ground [Marseille midfielder
  Darryl Bakola got caught up in the fight and was knocked out]. It’s true that
  no teeth were broken during the fight, but it was a fight like I’ve never seen
  in all my years in football. “For the first time in my career, I didn’t know
  what to say or what to do. I’ve never seen anything like it. I come from the
  streets, I’m used to fights, but I’ve never seen anything like this. The
  club’s bodyguards were trying to separate them. Normally they’re supposed to
  protect us from others, not from ourselves.” It’s one to file under Scenes
  Nobody Wants To See (But Secretly Does). Celtic: The Scottish champions were
  held to a scoreless draw by the Kazakh side Kairat Almaty in the first leg of
  their Champions League play-off on Wednesday and after the match, Brendan
  Rodgers sounded mightily fed up by his employers’ lack of effort in the
  transfer window to bring some new recruits into a Celtic side that looks light
  in several departments but particularly up front. For all that, his team
  should already have enough about it to beat opposition few in the UK had ever
  heard of before the draw was made. Having had a few days to gather his
  thoughts ahead of tomorrow’s Scottish Premiership match against Livingston,
  Rodgers dismissed speculation that there is any sort of “conflict” between him
  and the Celtic board and insisted he will not be leaving before his contract
  expires at the end of the season, despite having previous for walking out of
  Celtic Park midway through the final year of a contract. “Absolutely no
  chance,” he said. “We’ve done that before, it didn’t go down well. We had the
  chances over the summer [of contract talks] but I said, ‘now the season
  starts, I only want to think of the football’. I don’t want to think of the
  contract, just think of the football and that will come later on if it does. I
  said I’d be here for three years and I’m here for three years.” Celtic host
  Livingston tomorrow before setting off on their 7,000-kilometre round-trip for
  the second leg against Kairat Almaty. Everton: Speaking of the Hill Dickinson
  Stadium, the naming rights of Everton’s new ground have been bought by an
  international commercial law firm who are more than just a legal service
  provider. Indeed, according to their website, they’re “an extension of your
  team, your trusted thinking partner and a right hand you can rely on”. No,
  really. Sometimes the jokes write themselves. What isn’t immediately apparent
  from a brief perusal of their website is any evidence whatsoever that they
  have a shiny new stadium in Liverpool’s Bramley Moore Dock named after them
  and that it will be hosting its first Premier League match this weekend. The
  normally unpickupable legal periodical, the Law Gazette, is intrigued by the
  firm’s lack of “outward promotion” of their sponsorship deal ahead of Sunday’s
  big game. “Curiously, there has been an absence of much outward promotion this
  week ahead of the big day,” it says in an article published earlier today.
  “The firm’s news page has not updated anything about the Everton link since
  its was first announced and there had been, as of Friday morning, no mention
  of it on any of the firm’s social media channels. “Far be it for us to tell
  the marketing bods how to do their job, but we would have thought that the
  naming of a Premier League football stadium and the prospect of immediately
  increasing your recognition by millions might be an opportunity to shout about
  it a little.” Either the Hill Dickinson socials team need to get the
  collective finger out, or else those who sanctioned the naming rights deal are
  having second thoughts after witnessing Everton’s dismal performance against
  Leeds on Monday night. Brighton: Yet to give his teenage big-money signing
  Greek signing Charalampos Kostoulas a run-out in the Premier League, Fabian
  Hurzeler remains hopeful that Brighton will be active during the rest of the
  transfer window, but is content with his forward options before Sunday’s trip
  to take on Everton in the first competitive match to be staged at the Hill
  Dickinson Stadium. Kostoulas sat out last weekend’s 1-1 draw with Fulham, with
  Georginio Rutter being deployed up front before being replaced by Danny
  Welbeck. Asked if he was in regular contact with Brighton’s owner, Tony Bloom,
  Hurzeler said “I’m not knocking on his door otherwise I would always have to
  travel to London and I’m happy living here in Brighton.” Ah yes, Fabian. Tell
  us you’ve endured the horrors of the Southern and Thameslink rail service
  between Brighton and London without telling us you’ve endured the horrors of
  the Southern and Thameslink rail service from Brighton to London. “There are
  always opportunities in football, so never say never,” added the German. “Of
  course with the loss of Joao [Pedro], we miss one more striker. Stefanos needs
  time to get up to speed, so it’s a little bit of a balance thing. You have two
  strikers with Danny and with Georgi, like how to finish a game, how to start a
  game, how to finish strong.” Brentford: Keith Andrews could include Yoane
  Wissa in the Brentford squad for tomorrow’s home game against Aston Villa,
  despite reports the DR Congo striker has gone Full Isak and is refusing to
  play for his club while trying to force a move to Newcastle. Wissa did not
  feature in Brentford’s opening day defeat at the hands of Nottingham Forest
  last Sunday. “He’s been training with the team,” said Andrews. “In terms of
  being involved this weekend, I’ll make a decision on the squad tomorrow, but
  he’s part of the group this week. He’s a Brentford player right now. My stance
  around Yoane all along is I don’t want him to leave. “That hasn’t really
  changed in any way, shape or form. I keep going back to being understanding of
  his situation, but for me I don’t want to lose a player of that quality. So
  that hasn’t really changed throughout the whole episode of the transfer
  window.” That’s all from me today. Barry Glendenning is on hand to steer you
  through the evening news. Lucky you! As deadline day approaches make sure you
  stay up to date with our transfer interactives showing all the deals and
  club-by-club guides. Fulham have only signed player this window – Benjamin
  Lecomte from Montpellier – and Marco Silva was pretty blunt regarding his
  squad. We had a plan and the plan until now didn’t go through, it’s as simple
  as that. We have to look at ourselves, it’s our fault, it’s not the fault of
  the market. I cannot tell you that someone is going to arrive tomorrow or in
  two day’s time because I’m not sure and, to be honest, I have big doubts that
  it’s going to happen. That plan failed until now, it is clear. We need
  solutions in the back line, we are short in certain positions there, we need
  another midfielder to come in as well. Some of our main targets are no more,
  we have to go in a different direction right now. Some of your thoughts on
  today’s news. Matthew: Marinakis is an idiot if lets Nuno go. Who wouldn’t
  want the Holy Spirit working for him? Krishna: Is ill-luck or misfortune the
  middle name of Tottenham Hotspurs? There is a saying in India that if your
  luck is bad a dog will board the bus you are travelling in and bite you.
  Mariam: I’d be gutted to see Nuno go as a Forest fan. He’s been so good to us.
  But a part of me thinks he should not have said what he said in today’s press
  conference. Is that something he should have aired out to the media? If
  anything, it will be the nail in the coffin to sack him. Toby: Spurs have had
  such dire luck in the window. I’d really like to see us go for Tyler Dibling.
  Surely he’d prefer us over Everton … Right?! West Ham have submitted a bid for
  Monaco’s Soungoutou Magassa and are pushing to complete a deal for the
  midfielder. Graham Potter is looking to make two additions in midfield and is
  moving ahead with his plans after an agreement was reached for Edson Álvarez
  to join Fenerbahçe on loan. Potter is looking to make two additions in
  midfield and is moving ahead with his plans after the broad outline of an
  agreement was reached for Edson Álvarez to join Fenerbahçe on loan. Talks are
  taking place between West Ham and the Turkish club regarding the final details
  of a deal for the Mexico international. Let’s turn to Wolves where Vitor
  Pereira is keeping tight-lipped on Jorgen Strand Larsen’s future amid interest
  from Newcastle: He’s a very important player for us. I never talk with him
  about [transfer rumours]. He’s our player. When I watch him on the training,
  he’s committed with everybody, committed with the team. He’s a fighter. He
  likes to win. He’s preparing himself to play tomorrow. The market is the
  market. If the window is open, the players can come and the players can leave.
  I believe this is possible. The reports from earlier about Nuno’s possible
  sacking seemingly came from nowhere despite the manager publicly saying he was
  worried about the team’s transfer activity in the window. However, his “when
  there’s smoke, there’s fire” claims are quite damning. Forest have brought in
  eight senior players this window: Igor Jesus, Jair Cunha, Dan Ndoye, Angus
  Gunn, Omari Hutchinson, James McAtee, Arnaud Kalimuendo and Douglas Luiz (on
  loan). The club have also managed to keep hold of Morgan Gibbs-White despite
  interest from other Premier League sides. Feel free to use the email at the
  top of the page to let me know your thoughts on the possibility of Forest
  letting Nuno go. The Nottingham Forest manager Nuno Espírito Santo has cast
  doubt over his future after admitting “where there’s smoke, there’s fire” amid
  rumours about his job. Speculation is rife that the Portuguese’s position is
  under threat after his relationship with owner Evangelos Marinakis has
  deteriorated. Nuno, who was handed a new contract in June after guiding Forest
  into Europe last term, was seemingly accepting that his time at the club could
  be over after saying his connection with Marinakis has changed. “We know each
  other very well, and we have all been in the industry for a while now,” he
  said ahead of Sunday’s Premier League game at Crystal Palace. And where
  there’s smoke, there’s fire, so I know how things work, but I’m here to do my
  job. I understand, because I’m worried. I’m the first one to be worried. I’m
  the first one to be concerned. The cracks in the relationship started to show
  last week when Nuno criticised Forest’s summer transfer activity, saying the
  club had wasted a good chance and he was concerned for the season. They have
  since spent almost £100m in bringing in James McAtee, Omari Hutchinson, Arnaud
  Kalimuendo and Douglas Luiz. I always had a very good relationship with the
  owner, last season was very, very, very close. This season, not so well. No,
  it’s not (good). I don’t know exactly, but I’m being honest with you. I cannot
  say that is the same, because it’s not the same. The reason behind it, I don’t
  know. I always believe that dialogue and what you say or your opinion, is
  always valid, because my concern is the squad and the season that we have
  ahead of us, but our relations have changed. I’m being honest with you, I
  cannot say that is the same, because it’s not the same. The reason behind it,
  I don’t know. The reality is that is not what it used to be. What it used to
  be was a good, respectful relationship, but was more based on trust and
  sharing opinions, and now it’s not so good. PA Media Lots to unpack from that
  Spurs press conference. Frank says he is confident the team will sign an
  attacker but where do they turn to at this point? There has been murmurings of
  interest in Tyler Dibling, but Everton are also looking to get that over the
  line. Maghnes Akliouche? West Ham seem all over that. Bilal El Khannouss?
  Someone unproven in the top five leagues? So much to ponder over. Get in touch
  via email at the top of this blog and let me know where you think Spurs can go
  from here. Richarlison is wanted at Spurs and the side hope to keep him, says
  Frank, amid rumours the forward is keen for a move away: Right now,
  Richarlison is my starting No 9. He scored two fantastic goals, had two
  fantastic games and is the Brazil No 9. He’s a fantastic player, he wants to
  stay, I want to keep him and there’s been no talks about anything else. More
  from Frank on Spurs incomings before the window closes: I don’t care who a
  player is or who they support, we all have a past. If they want to come, they
  want to come. Whether they’re from Spain, Denmark, Brazil – perfect.
  Unfortunately we can’t go in Waitrose for five minutes and buy two very good
  players. It’s a bit more complicated than that. I see the club is working
  hard, Daniel, Vinay and Johan – we’re all on board in terms of seeing how we
  can improve. We have six very good front players who will be very competitive
  across all the competitions – and Kulusevski will come back this season, it’s
  probably longer-term with Maddison unfortunately. I’m confident though that we
  will sign another player before the end of the window. I’m a positive guy, I’m
  not that fearful. I believe something will happen. Naturally Thomas Frank is
  immediately asked about Eberechi Eze and he makes his stance clear quite
  quickly. In general, of course, I don’t speak about specific players unless
  they are at our fantastic club. That’s one thing, but secondly there’s been a
  lot of rumours – and a lot of times where there’s nothing in it. There must be
  someone out there who thinks it’s good fun to put the rumours out there.
  There’s been a lot of links and will continue to be. To be very general, I
  don’t want any players who don’t want to come to the club. If they don’t want
  to come here and wear this fantastic badge, we don’t want them here. That’s
  very clear, and I imagine the fans feel exactly the same. That’s a key
  message. It’s important to say that Thomas Frank was not talking specifically
  about Eberechi Eze. In fact, the Tottenham manager seemed reluctant to mention
  the player he has just missed out on by name at his press conference. But this
  morsel from him was probably the top line. And, well, Frank surely had Eze in
  mind. Will Eze be announced within the next couple of hours? Or will the game
  of hot potato continue? Let’s see. First let’s go to Spurs and see Thomas
  Frank’s reaction to missing out on the forward. Right, it’s time for me to
  hand back to Yara. The Eze announcement live grenade is passed on once more.
  Phew. Some further fitness updates from Arteta: Christian Nørgaard will not be
  available to face Leeds, while Ben White is a doubt. Asked about Jurriën
  Timber, who has been recovering after undergoing ankle surgery at the end of
  last season, he adds: “With Jurriën, we have to manage his load because he has
  been out for a long time again. We have to manage his load and have decided to
  take his training down.” There is more positive news on Gabriel Jesus, who has
  been out since sustaining an anterior cruciate ligament injury in January.
  “Gabriel is doing super well. He looks in a really good place. Obviously it is
  a massive injury and he needs to come back in a really strong way, but he is
  certainly in the right place.” Ruben Amorim says it is “not a good thing” to
  have four first-team players training away from their colleagues. Jadon
  Sancho, Tyrell Malacia, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho are all working
  separately from the group while they seek moves away from Old Trafford. None
  of the four were included in the squad for United’s pre-season tour and they
  did not feature in the opening-day defeat to Arsenal. United will ideally seal
  exits, whether permanent or temporary, for the quartet before the window
  closes, potentially allowing them to reinvest in new signings. “I know that is
  not a good thing to have players in this situation, but it’s clear they want
  to play in a different club,” Amorim said. “So we try to arrange everything
  for both parties to be happy, so I have to try to imagine to have the training
  with the guys that I think are going to be the future and the other guys are
  training and preparing for the next chapter. When the window is closed, it’s a
  different history, when the window is closed, we have to receive the players
  and in a new life, anything can happen.” The assembled press takes a different
  tack, asking Arteta general questions about transfers which – surprise,
  surprise – are really about Eze. Asked how important it is for a player to
  really want to come to Arsenal, Arteta says: “That’s the number one, that they
  want to be with us and feel something special to come to us. Then the person,
  what personality we are going to bring, and then the rest comes. I think we
  have done very well in the last few years to create this spirit in the team.”
  Eze, a boyhood Arsenal fan who played in the academy until his release aged
  13, fits the bill nicely, then. Asked whether it might be desirable to sign a
  player who grew up supporting Arsenal, Arteta says: “The better the feeling,
  the stronger the feeling then the better always because it brings a different
  edge, will and emotion to what you do and I think that always brings something
  extra.” Arteta stays similarly circumspect when asked about the injury to Kai
  Havertz which expedited Arsenal’s pursuit of Eze. “We don’t really know the
  extent of it. We need a bit more time and some more tests and after that we
  will have some more clarity. “I prefer not to talk about the specifics, but he
  is not fit. We need to explore this situation a bit further and decide what we
  are going to do. I don’t know [how long he will be out for]. I would love to
  have him available for tomorrow.” Mikel Arteta’s press conference is up next
  and, inevitably, he ends up fielding questions about Eze. Given the
  27-year-old is yet to be unveiled, however, he stays tight-lipped. “Nothing to
  comment,” he says. “I can never talk about any player that is not part of our
  group yet.” There has been some movement in the transfer market over the last
  few hours. In the Championship, Sheffield United have brought in the former
  Norwich and Everton centre-back Ben Godfrey on a season-long loan from
  Atalanta. In the Premier League, Chelsea have confirmed the departure of
  Renato Veiga to Villarreal on a permanent deal thought to be worth £25.6m.
  Meanwhile Bournemouth have bade farewell to Luis Sinisterra, who has joined
  Cruzeiro in Brazil on loan. Before Bournemouth welcome Wolves to the Vitality
  Stadium tomorrow, Andoni Iraola has suggested Ryan Christie is in the mix to
  play after a long layoff owing to groin surgery. “Ryan has been training
  pretty normally this week. I hope he trains without any problems today and he
  can get involved tomorrow. He comes without months of playing, but I am seeing
  him at a good level.” While Eze’s move is still to be announced officially,
  David Raya, the Arsenal goalkeeper, has been talking about how he and his
  teammates have helped the club’s new signings settle in. “We know the team has
  been strengthened and we signed quality players that are going to be massive
  for the success of this club. I’m very happy with everyone and I think it’s
  very easy to integrate into this dressing room. “We have welcomed them with
  open arms. We try to be as a group and try to welcome the players as well as
  possible, to settle in as quickly as possible, so that they can just focus on
  football and helping the team.” Guardiola is asked about incomings and
  outgoings in the transfer market, but doesn’t give much away. “I don’t know,”
  he says, when asked about reports that Manuel Akanji and Savinho might move
  on. “They are our players and we will see what happens. A few things are going
  to happen and we will see.” My turn again, is it? It certainly looks that way.
  Guardiola has also confirmed that Ederson is available to face Spurs, but he
  is yet to decide whether the Brazilian or James Trafford will start. “We will
  decide tomorrow or tonight after dinner. I am happy with [Trafford], the new
  players always bring a new energy and James brings his youth and desire to
  play for the club he grew up at. “I said many times it was just his first game
  [against Wolves], we just have to be consistent and we have to be better and
  improve.” More from Pep on its way. But now it’s time to hand you back to Will
  Magee. Enjoy your afternoon. Pep Guardiola is speaking to the press and has
  some positive teams news ahead of Manchester City’s home game with Tottenham
  on Saturday. Rodri and Phil Foden both missed the opening 4-0 win against
  Wolves at Molineux but they’re ready for the visit of Spurs, says Pep. Rodri
  and Phil were out last game, but for just the reason of lack of training and
  rhythm they didn’t travel to Palermo. They were not ready for 90 minutes
  against Wolves, but they are ready for tomorrow. I just want consistent Rodri.
  That’s all. I don’t have any doubts about his potential and quality. He’s
  still the best player in the world until we elect a new one in a few months. I
  have no doubts. Consistency in training, games, and after everything will be
  fine. Uefa is facing pressure to push back its deadline for separating
  ownership structures after a turbulent summer in which a handful of clubs,
  including Crystal Palace, were denied access to European competitions due to
  multi-club ownership rule-breaches. Matt Hughes and Nick Ames with this
  report. A few more stats ahead of tonight’s 8pm kick-off. Chelsea have won
  five of their previous seven Premier League encounters with West Ham (D1 L1).
  The Blues have 32 wins in the competition against West Ham, a record they can
  only better against Tottenham (37 wins). West Ham have a decent recent record
  in home encounters with Chelsea, winning four, drawing two, and losing two of
  the last eight. Computer says woe. West Ham are only given a 22% of beating
  Chelsea tonight according to the Opta supercomputer. The Hammers have
  collected just nine points from as many home games played under Graham Potter
  so that looks fair. No West Ham manager has won fewer than 10 points in their
  first 10 home games in the competition, with Alan Curbishley and Avram Grant
  both earning the lowest with 10. Fulham fans worried about a shortage of
  signings can breathe a sigh of relief. Then again, even a lengthy rummage
  through the outer margins of Transfermarkt may struggle to find Alex Dilling.
  Erm, that’s because he’s a chef. From Fulham’s Insta: “Introducing our
  incredible line-up of chefs on rotation in The Gourmet restaurant for the
  25/26 season.” That’s the grub sorted then. Now for a few new players maybe.
  Thanks Yara. Before we hear from that trio, here’s a couple of lines from Arne
  Slot yesterday. Liverpool have been leaking goals – two in both the Community
  Shield and their opening Premier League game – so he’s glad to have Ryan
  Gravenberch back from suspension. If he is the same player as he was last
  season, that could help us a lot. If you just simply look at the second goal
  we conceded [against Bournemouth], they could just go from one side from the
  18-yard box to the other side without being attacked, which was smart because
  Virgil [van Dijk] and Ibou [Konate] needed to go back because it was a
  four-versus-two situation. I think if you look back at last season and every
  single time he played, Ryan would have been in that position and for him not
  being there and us playing with very good players but very attack-minded
  players, that hurt us in that goal, for example, and that wasn’t the first
  time where we lacked a player in that position on a counter-attack for the
  other team. Normally, if he brings his normal level, it would definitely help
  us to have him back again. We need to find the right balance by not being too
  open. But that balance will be better with Ryan. Unfortunately, if you want to
  judge me or us, we now have to play Newcastle and Arsenal, who are normally
  teams that are going to be above Bournemouth in the league, so it’s even
  harder to play against them. But with Macca [Alexis Mac Allister] being back,
  with Ryan in his normal position, I expect us to be even better prepared for
  the counter-attack than we were in this 2-2 moment, because I’ve watched the
  game twice back and I don’t think – apart from the two goals, especially the
  second one as a counter-attack – there were many other counter-attacks from
  Bournemouth. But if it leads to a goal, it’s of course a big story. For us
  conceding two, that’s too much in a home game, that’s too open. We have some
  press conferences from Pep Guardiola, Ruben Amorim and Mikel Arteta coming up.
  Here is David Tindall to steer you through the next hour. Earlier we confirmed
  Ipswich’s signing of Kasey McAteer. Here is what he had to say upon joining
  the club: I’m delighted to be here and can’t wait. It’s a very attractive
  project which is being built here and I want to add myself to that. I’ve been
  to Ipswich as an away player and I know how good the support is. As soon as I
  heard Ipswich were interested it was the only move I wanted to make. The aim
  is to get promoted again and that’s what we will push for every day. I want to
  be a part of that and I aspire to be the best version of myself, which is
  something I will be looking to bring to the squad. I’m excited to get to work
  with the boys and the staff and I can’t wait to meet the fans. Graham Potter
  will lead West Ham against his former side Chelsea tonight and says his team
  are “a work in progress”. The Hammers lost their opening Premier League match
  to Sunderland and it will be a tough task to bounce back against Enzo
  Maresca’s team. We know we have to do more in terms of results and improve our
  performance. The players were gutted after the [Sunderland] game, and there
  was optimism and positivity, and now it is up to us to react. We have to get
  more out of the squad that we have. We also look to improve, we will do that
  together, as a club, we will do that collectively and try to find the best
  solution. It’s great when you’ve had a bad result, everyone thinks the silver
  bullet will come from outside and save us all. History would suggest it
  doesn’t work like that. It’s about being a team and accepting the criticism
  when a bad result comes but to get on with your work and accept
  responsibility. Last night Nottingham Forest confirmed the signing of Douglas
  Luiz from Juventus on a season-long loan with a conditional obligation to make
  the deal permanent next summer. The 27-year-old midfielder left Aston Villa
  last year to join the Serie A side for £42.35m on a five-year contract. I am
  really happy to be here, it’s a big club and I decided to come here because I
  can see the ambition the club has. I am so excited to start with the team and
  give my best for the shirt and the fans. Lots of rumours of Chelsea looking at
  possible defensive reinforcements after Levi Colwill’s injury and Wesley
  Fofana reportedly not being happy at the club but Enzo Maresca put those
  rumours to rest in his press conference last night ahead of tonight’s game at
  West Ham. The manager said the club were looking at “internal solutions” and
  reiterated as much when pressed about possible signings. We are trying to find
  internal solutions. I repeat again. Maybe I need to improve my English. On
  Fofana’s mood at the club and abuse he faced from fans after removing mentions
  of Chelsea on his social media: I speak with Wes every day, he is very happy,
  especially because he is back from injury. He is joining all the sessions and
  is very happy. Wes is happy, we are happy and there is nothing to add. If
  there is abuse on Instagram that’s never good – not good for Wes or any player
  but is something that we unfortunately cannot control. The Liverpool youngster
  Lewis Koumas is close to agreeing a loan move to Championship promotion
  hopefuls Birmingham City. The 19-year-old Wales forward spent last season on
  loan in the division with Stoke City, where he scored six goals in 49
  appearances in all competitions. Ipswich have signed Kasey McAteer from
  Championship rivals Leicester in a deal worth about £12m. The Republic of
  Ireland winger is a graduate of Leicester’s academy and previously spent time
  on loan at AFC Wimbledon and Forest Green Rovers. McAteer represents Ipswich’s
  seventh summer signing, with Chuba Akpom, on loan from Ajax, and Ashley Young
  high-profile arrivals. Ipswich, who visit Preston on Saturday, have so far
  failed in their attempts to sign Middlesbrough’s Hayden Hackney, who has been
  linked with a move to the Premier League. Leeds head to Arsenal tomorrow and
  Daniel Farke has promised his side will not “sell our DNA” to get the win. We
  won’t sell out our DNA and park the bus. If you just try to defend you have no
  chance to survive there. We will try to be there with many periods with the
  ball. Will try to create chances to scare them. There will be periods where we
  suffer and we have to be well structured The Leeds manager was also asked if
  Dominic Calvert-Lewin was any closer to making his debut for the club. We’ll
  see. Each and every training session with the team is important for him. He
  had a long summer break, followed by a few weeks of individual training, where
  his general endurance was at a really good level. However, what he has missed
  is team training, and for that reason, each session is crucial. He has made a
  decent impression, already well integrated, and you can see from day to day
  that he is growing. When we will use him for the first time, we’ll decide
  spontaneously. From a fitness point of view, he’s in good shape. Wrexham will
  hope to get their first league win of the season tomorrow against Sheffield
  Wednesday and their 43-year wait for a win in English football’s second tier.
  The ambitious Championship new boys have made a splash in the transfer market
  since sealing a stunning third straight promotion last term with 10 summer
  arrivals. “We have had disappointing results,” said Conor Coady, who signed
  from Leicester earlier in the summer. We’ve come away from the games thinking
  we should have won at least one of them, especially the Southampton one where
  we were 1-0 up so late. But are we improving. Have we showed we can play?
  Yeah, of course but we need to get them wins on the board. We’re there to win
  games. It’s as simple as that. We’ll keep trying, we’ll keep learning, we’ll
  keep getting better and hopefully it’ll come soon. Howe has also been asked
  about the atmosphere at St James’ Park, which might be extra hostile given the
  circumstances: The first home game is always going to be electric. I love
  experience those nights with the energy that the crowd bring us and I have no
  doubt that this will be a really passionate display from the home support. We
  need to harness that and use it but not be reckless with it, we need to
  concentrate on the game and not get too emotional. Eddie Howe was asked
  specifically about Alexander Isak’s social media post claiming promises from
  Newcastle were broken: There is always two sides to every story. My job is to
  support him and care for him, and we will see where we are in a week’s time. I
  hope I can work with him again and get him back to his best. At the moment
  [reintegration into the squad] is not an option for us so rather than talk
  hypotheticals, I’d rather talk when we get to that point and try to get the
  best for Alex and get the best for the team. Until the point, we are better
  off focusing on the players we have available for the team. Alex is an
  outstanding player and a very good person and a good character. He wants to
  succeed in his career and this has been a really difficult situation for him
  and for the players that we have to see us without him. If Alex decided to
  come back and play for us the players would welcome him back. Without Isak,
  Newcastle will probably play Anthony Gordon as a No 9. The 24-year-old
  primarily plays as a winger but Howe believes he is more than capable of
  leading the line. He has done it enough to be able to do the job really well
  for the team. I have played him there a number of times both as a starter and
  as a substitute. He plays it differently to other strikers but that can be a
  positive in the respect that he has devastating pace and a strong work ethic.
  Of course he’s scored goals historically from wide areas but also from central
  areas and I think you can over play the change of position and I think he
  enjoys the role and he played really well last week. He had a lot of chances
  and a lot of shots so I thought it was a good display from him. Thanks Will
  and hello everyone! Lots to be expected from these final 10 days of the
  window. Let’s see what else Howe has said on Isak and the game against
  Liverpool on Monday. Having steered you through the early morning slot, it’s
  time for me to hand over to Yara El-Shaboury for the next few hours. Who’s
  going to get the official Eze announcement? It could be Yara! Scenes if so.
  Rúben Dias has signed a two-year contract extension with Manchester City that
  keeps him at the club until 2029. The defender is intent on helping Pep
  Guardiola’s team claim more silverware after last season’s barren campaign.
  The 28-year-old said: “My job now is to be the best I can be for the duration
  of this contract, so that I can play my part in helping us challenge for more
  silverware. “I want to thank my teammates, Pep, Hugo [Viana], the coaching
  staff and everyone at the club. This is such a special place, and I am
  grateful every single day for the support I receive. Now the hard work begins,
  and I want to promise the fans that I will give everything to win more
  trophies and bring more success to City.” The Portuguese centre-back has won
  10 trophies in five years at City, making 223 appearances in all competitions.
  Asked how he is dealing with the Isak transfer saga on a personal level, Howe
  adds: “I think these situations are far from ideal, talking press-wise, and a
  lot of the attention has gone on to that rather than the team and our
  preparation. “But as soon as I leave here I’m back with the team, I’m back
  preparing training, taking training, delivering meetings, speaking to
  individual players and trying to get the group in the best frame of mind
  possible. So the job never changes, but the outside perception is one that’s
  of course totally different to normal.” Eddie Howe is speaking to the media
  ahead of Newcastle’s game against Liverpool on Monday evening and,
  unsurprisingly, everyone seems to be asking about Alexander Isak. The
  Newcastle manager concedes “there’s been no change” in the impasse between the
  club and the striker, who is pushing hard for a move to Anfield, and that he
  won’t be part of the squad when Arne Slot’s side visit St James’ Park. “He’s
  contracted to us, he’s our player,” Howe says. “My wish is that he would be
  playing on Monday night with us, but he won’t be, and that’s regrettable at
  this moment. But 100% I want to see him back in a Newcastle shirt.” Is anyone
  on Eze watch outside the Emirates at the moment? Perhaps with a handmade
  welcome sign on A4 paper and cardboard? Feel free to email in with any updates
  if so. Some Eze-themed street art has already popped up in the local area,
  while the latest is that his medical is imminent (or possibly already under
  way). Sheffield Wednesday supporters are planning a protest outside the Thai
  embassy against the club’s owner, Dejphon Chansiri, over his running of the
  club. London-based fans will be joined by those travelling down from South
  Yorkshire to show their upset with the running of the club. Owls fans will
  also boycott the team’s match against Leeds at Hillsborough on Tuesday in the
  Carabao Cup. Supporters will instead be encouraged to watch the game on a big
  screen outside the local working men’s club. Supporters want Chansiri to sell
  the club but movement on a takeover has been slow, to say the least. They have
  previously held protests at their opening match against Leicester, when fans
  did not take their seats for the first five minutes and had a plane fly
  overhead with an anti-Chansiri message. That was followed by a whistle protest
  in the first home game of the season against Stoke. “The London Owls are
  planning a protest against Dejphon Chansiri’s ownership of our wonderful
  football club,” a fan statement read. “We might be 160-plus miles from
  Hillsborough but our members feel just as strongly as those thousands closer
  to S6 that ‘Enough is Enough’ and unless Chansiri sells up soon then the club
  faces the prospect of financial ruin.” It’s Friday morning and rather than
  choosing life, choosing a job, choosing a career or choosing a family, we’re
  about to choose another weekend of Premier League football. Round two of the
  2025-26 season – still feels a bit weird to write that, the sands of time are
  slipping away at a terrifying rate aren’t they? – begins with Chelsea’s visit
  to West Ham this evening, but there will be a full slate of press conferences
  and team news to come. There’s also the small matter of Eberechi Eze
  completing his move to Arsenal which, given the reaction it has already
  elicited online, is bound to make it a difficult day for Tottenham fans on
  social media. What better way to shut out the noise than joining us here? As
  for the neutrals in that particular transfer wrangle, there will also be
  plenty of tidbits from the transfer market, EFL, Scottish Premiership and
  European football. So grab yourself a brew, open a sneaky extra tab at work
  and let’s settle in for a day of minimum productivity and maximum Beautiful
  Game. Here are a couple of things to get you started:

Notwithstanding any late nuggets o’news or the inevitable unveiling of Eberechi Eze as an Arsenal player approximately four minutes before I’m due to knock off for a rare weekend of leisure, that’s about it for today. Before I take the ball towards the corner flag in a shameless bid to run down the clock, here is a reminder of today’s best bits … Nuno Espírito Santo has cast doubt over his future after admitting “where there’s smoke, there’s fire” amid rumours about his job security and the detorioration of his relationship with the Nottingham Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis. “What it used to be was a good, respectful relationship, but was more based on trust and sharing opinions, and now it’s not so good,” he said. Mikel Arteta has said he doesn’t know the extent of the injury suffered by Kai Havertz this week and refused to discuss Arsenal’s acquisition of Eberechi Eze before the player’s transfer from Crystal Palace is officially signed, sealed and delivered. Thomas Frank insists Spurs never really fancied Eze anyway (OK, we may be paraphrasing) and said Richarlison is wanted at Spurs despite rumours the Brazilian is keen on a move elsewhere. Keith Andrews has refused to rule out the possibility of his want-away-to-Newcastle striker Yoane Wissa featuring in Brentford’s home match against Aston Villa. Brendan Rodgers has denied speculation that there is any sort of “conflict” between himself and the Celtic board over their apparent reluctance to dip into the club coffers and insists he will see out his contract, which is due to expire next June. Rúben Dias has signed a two-year contract extension with Manchester City that keeps him at the club until 2029 or will greatly increase his value if they decide to ship him out. Eddie Howe has conceded “there’s been no change” in the impasse between Newcastle United and their disaffected striker Alexander Isak. “I think these situations are far from ideal,” he told reporters. West Ham have submitted a bid for Monaco midfielder Soungoutou Magassa. Sheffield Wednesday’s London-based supporters are planning a protest against the club’s owner, Dejphon Chansiri outside the Thai embassy, while their fellow Owls also plan to boycott the team’s match against Leeds at Hillsborough on Tuesday in the Carabao Cup. Championship side Ipswich have signed the Republic Of Ireland winger Kasey McAteer from rivals Leicester in a deal worth about £12m. Liverpool forward Lewis Koumas is close to agreeing a loan move to Championship promotion hopefuls Birmingham City after spending last season on loan at Stoke City. Nottingham Forest confirmed the signing of Douglas Luiz from Juventus on a season-long loan with a conditional obligation to make the deal permanent next summer. Sheffield United have brought in the former Norwich and Everton centre-back Ben Godfrey on a season-long loan from Atalanta. And Marseille coach Roberto De Zerbi has described the dressing-room scrap that took place between Jonathan Rowe and Adrien Rabiot following last weekend’s defeat against Rennes as being like “a bar fight” and “a fight like I’ve never seen in all my years in football”. Both players have since been suspended by the club and placed on the transfer list. West Ham v Chelsea: Following a defeat against Sunderland last weekend in which many of their players looked worryingly unmotivated and off the pace, West Ham host Chelsea tonight at the London Stadium. If you can’t watch the game, Scott Murray will be bringing you minute-by-minute coverage on the Guardian website and even you can see it, his unique and pithy stylings ought to add to the gaiety of the evening. Tune in!!! Tottenham Hotspurned: “If it’s any consolation to gazumped Spurs fans, former Tottenham winger Lucas Moura put a penalty past former Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina in São Paulo FC’s second-leg shootout win over Colombia’s Atletico Nacional in a Copa Libertadores Round-of-16 tie earlier this week,” writes Peter Oh, who fails to add that the hot-headed former Rangers striker Alfredo Morelos scored in the 90 minutes for Atletico, who went on to lose on penalties, and somehow didn’t get himself sent off. Fitba mailbag: “Having listened to Brendan Rodgers’ interview on Sportsound after the Kairat game, my hot take is that he and/or Russell Martin might be gone come January – Martin given the boot and Rodgers ejecting his toys from the pram again,” writes James Humphries, offering a take so cold his fingers probably froze just typing it. “He said ‘Not for me to say [about whether fans are right to be annoyed]’ and ‘there’s only so many ways to dress up ‘we need players’, which sounds to me a hell of a lot like someone preparing to pee off in high dudgeon.” Marseille: The French club’s head coach Roberto De Zerbi has provided some tremendously entertaining insight into the dressing-room scrap between teammates Adrien Rabiot and Jonathan Rowe which took place after Marseille’s opening day defeat at Rennes last weekend and led to both players being suspended by their employers and placed on the transfer list. “I ask you this, what happens if, at your workplace, two people, two employees, two workers, two lawyers, get into a fight?” said De Zerbi, upon being asked why both players had been told to leave the club. “It was a bar fight, in front of the sporting director, in front of the coach, with a team-mate on the ground [Marseille midfielder Darryl Bakola got caught up in the fight and was knocked out]. It’s true that no teeth were broken during the fight, but it was a fight like I’ve never seen in all my years in football. “For the first time in my career, I didn’t know what to say or what to do. I’ve never seen anything like it. I come from the streets, I’m used to fights, but I’ve never seen anything like this. The club’s bodyguards were trying to separate them. Normally they’re supposed to protect us from others, not from ourselves.” It’s one to file under Scenes Nobody Wants To See (But Secretly Does). Celtic: The Scottish champions were held to a scoreless draw by the Kazakh side Kairat Almaty in the first leg of their Champions League play-off on Wednesday and after the match, Brendan Rodgers sounded mightily fed up by his employers’ lack of effort in the transfer window to bring some new recruits into a Celtic side that looks light in several departments but particularly up front. For all that, his team should already have enough about it to beat opposition few in the UK had ever heard of before the draw was made. Having had a few days to gather his thoughts ahead of tomorrow’s Scottish Premiership match against Livingston, Rodgers dismissed speculation that there is any sort of “conflict” between him and the Celtic board and insisted he will not be leaving before his contract expires at the end of the season, despite having previous for walking out of Celtic Park midway through the final year of a contract. “Absolutely no chance,” he said. “We’ve done that before, it didn’t go down well. We had the chances over the summer [of contract talks] but I said, ‘now the season starts, I only want to think of the football’. I don’t want to think of the contract, just think of the football and that will come later on if it does. I said I’d be here for three years and I’m here for three years.” Celtic host Livingston tomorrow before setting off on their 7,000-kilometre round-trip for the second leg against Kairat Almaty. Everton: Speaking of the Hill Dickinson Stadium, the naming rights of Everton’s new ground have been bought by an international commercial law firm who are more than just a legal service provider. Indeed, according to their website, they’re “an extension of your team, your trusted thinking partner and a right hand you can rely on”. No, really. Sometimes the jokes write themselves. What isn’t immediately apparent from a brief perusal of their website is any evidence whatsoever that they have a shiny new stadium in Liverpool’s Bramley Moore Dock named after them and that it will be hosting its first Premier League match this weekend. The normally unpickupable legal periodical, the Law Gazette, is intrigued by the firm’s lack of “outward promotion” of their sponsorship deal ahead of Sunday’s big game. “Curiously, there has been an absence of much outward promotion this week ahead of the big day,” it says in an article published earlier today. “The firm’s news page has not updated anything about the Everton link since its was first announced and there had been, as of Friday morning, no mention of it on any of the firm’s social media channels. “Far be it for us to tell the marketing bods how to do their job, but we would have thought that the naming of a Premier League football stadium and the prospect of immediately increasing your recognition by millions might be an opportunity to shout about it a little.” Either the Hill Dickinson socials team need to get the collective finger out, or else those who sanctioned the naming rights deal are having second thoughts after witnessing Everton’s dismal performance against Leeds on Monday night. Brighton: Yet to give his teenage big-money signing Greek signing Charalampos Kostoulas a run-out in the Premier League, Fabian Hurzeler remains hopeful that Brighton will be active during the rest of the transfer window, but is content with his forward options before Sunday’s trip to take on Everton in the first competitive match to be staged at the Hill Dickinson Stadium. Kostoulas sat out last weekend’s 1-1 draw with Fulham, with Georginio Rutter being deployed up front before being replaced by Danny Welbeck. Asked if he was in regular contact with Brighton’s owner, Tony Bloom, Hurzeler said “I’m not knocking on his door otherwise I would always have to travel to London and I’m happy living here in Brighton.” Ah yes, Fabian. Tell us you’ve endured the horrors of the Southern and Thameslink rail service between Brighton and London without telling us you’ve endured the horrors of the Southern and Thameslink rail service from Brighton to London. “There are always opportunities in football, so never say never,” added the German. “Of course with the loss of Joao [Pedro], we miss one more striker. Stefanos needs time to get up to speed, so it’s a little bit of a balance thing. You have two strikers with Danny and with Georgi, like how to finish a game, how to start a game, how to finish strong.” Brentford: Keith Andrews could include Yoane Wissa in the Brentford squad for tomorrow’s home game against Aston Villa, despite reports the DR Congo striker has gone Full Isak and is refusing to play for his club while trying to force a move to Newcastle. Wissa did not feature in Brentford’s opening day defeat at the hands of Nottingham Forest last Sunday. “He’s been training with the team,” said Andrews. “In terms of being involved this weekend, I’ll make a decision on the squad tomorrow, but he’s part of the group this week. He’s a Brentford player right now. My stance around Yoane all along is I don’t want him to leave. “That hasn’t really changed in any way, shape or form. I keep going back to being understanding of his situation, but for me I don’t want to lose a player of that quality. So that hasn’t really changed throughout the whole episode of the transfer window.” That’s all from me today. Barry Glendenning is on hand to steer you through the evening news. Lucky you! As deadline day approaches make sure you stay up to date with our transfer interactives showing all the deals and club-by-club guides. Fulham have only signed player this window – Benjamin Lecomte from Montpellier – and Marco Silva was pretty blunt regarding his squad. We had a plan and the plan until now didn’t go through, it’s as simple as that. We have to look at ourselves, it’s our fault, it’s not the fault of the market. I cannot tell you that someone is going to arrive tomorrow or in two day’s time because I’m not sure and, to be honest, I have big doubts that it’s going to happen. That plan failed until now, it is clear. We need solutions in the back line, we are short in certain positions there, we need another midfielder to come in as well. Some of our main targets are no more, we have to go in a different direction right now. Some of your thoughts on today’s news. Matthew: Marinakis is an idiot if lets Nuno go. Who wouldn’t want the Holy Spirit working for him? Krishna: Is ill-luck or misfortune the middle name of Tottenham Hotspurs? There is a saying in India that if your luck is bad a dog will board the bus you are travelling in and bite you. Mariam: I’d be gutted to see Nuno go as a Forest fan. He’s been so good to us. But a part of me thinks he should not have said what he said in today’s press conference. Is that something he should have aired out to the media? If anything, it will be the nail in the coffin to sack him. Toby: Spurs have had such dire luck in the window. I’d really like to see us go for Tyler Dibling. Surely he’d prefer us over Everton … Right?! West Ham have submitted a bid for Monaco’s Soungoutou Magassa and are pushing to complete a deal for the midfielder. Graham Potter is looking to make two additions in midfield and is moving ahead with his plans after an agreement was reached for Edson Álvarez to join Fenerbahçe on loan. Potter is looking to make two additions in midfield and is moving ahead with his plans after the broad outline of an agreement was reached for Edson Álvarez to join Fenerbahçe on loan. Talks are taking place between West Ham and the Turkish club regarding the final details of a deal for the Mexico international. Let’s turn to Wolves where Vitor Pereira is keeping tight-lipped on Jorgen Strand Larsen’s future amid interest from Newcastle: He’s a very important player for us. I never talk with him about [transfer rumours]. He’s our player. When I watch him on the training, he’s committed with everybody, committed with the team. He’s a fighter. He likes to win. He’s preparing himself to play tomorrow. The market is the market. If the window is open, the players can come and the players can leave. I believe this is possible. The reports from earlier about Nuno’s possible sacking seemingly came from nowhere despite the manager publicly saying he was worried about the team’s transfer activity in the window. However, his “when there’s smoke, there’s fire” claims are quite damning. Forest have brought in eight senior players this window: Igor Jesus, Jair Cunha, Dan Ndoye, Angus Gunn, Omari Hutchinson, James McAtee, Arnaud Kalimuendo and Douglas Luiz (on loan). The club have also managed to keep hold of Morgan Gibbs-White despite interest from other Premier League sides. Feel free to use the email at the top of the page to let me know your thoughts on the possibility of Forest letting Nuno go. The Nottingham Forest manager Nuno Espírito Santo has cast doubt over his future after admitting “where there’s smoke, there’s fire” amid rumours about his job. Speculation is rife that the Portuguese’s position is under threat after his relationship with owner Evangelos Marinakis has deteriorated. Nuno, who was handed a new contract in June after guiding Forest into Europe last term, was seemingly accepting that his time at the club could be over after saying his connection with Marinakis has changed. “We know each other very well, and we have all been in the industry for a while now,” he said ahead of Sunday’s Premier League game at Crystal Palace. And where there’s smoke, there’s fire, so I know how things work, but I’m here to do my job. I understand, because I’m worried. I’m the first one to be worried. I’m the first one to be concerned. The cracks in the relationship started to show last week when Nuno criticised Forest’s summer transfer activity, saying the club had wasted a good chance and he was concerned for the season. They have since spent almost £100m in bringing in James McAtee, Omari Hutchinson, Arnaud Kalimuendo and Douglas Luiz. I always had a very good relationship with the owner, last season was very, very, very close. This season, not so well. No, it’s not (good). I don’t know exactly, but I’m being honest with you. I cannot say that is the same, because it’s not the same. The reason behind it, I don’t know. I always believe that dialogue and what you say or your opinion, is always valid, because my concern is the squad and the season that we have ahead of us, but our relations have changed. I’m being honest with you, I cannot say that is the same, because it’s not the same. The reason behind it, I don’t know. The reality is that is not what it used to be. What it used to be was a good, respectful relationship, but was more based on trust and sharing opinions, and now it’s not so good. PA Media Lots to unpack from that Spurs press conference. Frank says he is confident the team will sign an attacker but where do they turn to at this point? There has been murmurings of interest in Tyler Dibling, but Everton are also looking to get that over the line. Maghnes Akliouche? West Ham seem all over that. Bilal El Khannouss? Someone unproven in the top five leagues? So much to ponder over. Get in touch via email at the top of this blog and let me know where you think Spurs can go from here. Richarlison is wanted at Spurs and the side hope to keep him, says Frank, amid rumours the forward is keen for a move away: Right now, Richarlison is my starting No 9. He scored two fantastic goals, had two fantastic games and is the Brazil No 9. He’s a fantastic player, he wants to stay, I want to keep him and there’s been no talks about anything else. More from Frank on Spurs incomings before the window closes: I don’t care who a player is or who they support, we all have a past. If they want to come, they want to come. Whether they’re from Spain, Denmark, Brazil – perfect. Unfortunately we can’t go in Waitrose for five minutes and buy two very good players. It’s a bit more complicated than that. I see the club is working hard, Daniel, Vinay and Johan – we’re all on board in terms of seeing how we can improve. We have six very good front players who will be very competitive across all the competitions – and Kulusevski will come back this season, it’s probably longer-term with Maddison unfortunately. I’m confident though that we will sign another player before the end of the window. I’m a positive guy, I’m not that fearful. I believe something will happen. Naturally Thomas Frank is immediately asked about Eberechi Eze and he makes his stance clear quite quickly. In general, of course, I don’t speak about specific players unless they are at our fantastic club. That’s one thing, but secondly there’s been a lot of rumours – and a lot of times where there’s nothing in it. There must be someone out there who thinks it’s good fun to put the rumours out there. There’s been a lot of links and will continue to be. To be very general, I don’t want any players who don’t want to come to the club. If they don’t want to come here and wear this fantastic badge, we don’t want them here. That’s very clear, and I imagine the fans feel exactly the same. That’s a key message. It’s important to say that Thomas Frank was not talking specifically about Eberechi Eze. In fact, the Tottenham manager seemed reluctant to mention the player he has just missed out on by name at his press conference. But this morsel from him was probably the top line. And, well, Frank surely had Eze in mind. Will Eze be announced within the next couple of hours? Or will the game of hot potato continue? Let’s see. First let’s go to Spurs and see Thomas Frank’s reaction to missing out on the forward. Right, it’s time for me to hand back to Yara. The Eze announcement live grenade is passed on once more. Phew. Some further fitness updates from Arteta: Christian Nørgaard will not be available to face Leeds, while Ben White is a doubt. Asked about Jurriën Timber, who has been recovering after undergoing ankle surgery at the end of last season, he adds: “With Jurriën, we have to manage his load because he has been out for a long time again. We have to manage his load and have decided to take his training down.” There is more positive news on Gabriel Jesus, who has been out since sustaining an anterior cruciate ligament injury in January. “Gabriel is doing super well. He looks in a really good place. Obviously it is a massive injury and he needs to come back in a really strong way, but he is certainly in the right place.” Ruben Amorim says it is “not a good thing” to have four first-team players training away from their colleagues. Jadon Sancho, Tyrell Malacia, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho are all working separately from the group while they seek moves away from Old Trafford. None of the four were included in the squad for United’s pre-season tour and they did not feature in the opening-day defeat to Arsenal. United will ideally seal exits, whether permanent or temporary, for the quartet before the window closes, potentially allowing them to reinvest in new signings. “I know that is not a good thing to have players in this situation, but it’s clear they want to play in a different club,” Amorim said. “So we try to arrange everything for both parties to be happy, so I have to try to imagine to have the training with the guys that I think are going to be the future and the other guys are training and preparing for the next chapter. When the window is closed, it’s a different history, when the window is closed, we have to receive the players and in a new life, anything can happen.” The assembled press takes a different tack, asking Arteta general questions about transfers which – surprise, surprise – are really about Eze. Asked how important it is for a player to really want to come to Arsenal, Arteta says: “That’s the number one, that they want to be with us and feel something special to come to us. Then the person, what personality we are going to bring, and then the rest comes. I think we have done very well in the last few years to create this spirit in the team.” Eze, a boyhood Arsenal fan who played in the academy until his release aged 13, fits the bill nicely, then. Asked whether it might be desirable to sign a player who grew up supporting Arsenal, Arteta says: “The better the feeling, the stronger the feeling then the better always because it brings a different edge, will and emotion to what you do and I think that always brings something extra.” Arteta stays similarly circumspect when asked about the injury to Kai Havertz which expedited Arsenal’s pursuit of Eze. “We don’t really know the extent of it. We need a bit more time and some more tests and after that we will have some more clarity. “I prefer not to talk about the specifics, but he is not fit. We need to explore this situation a bit further and decide what we are going to do. I don’t know [how long he will be out for]. I would love to have him available for tomorrow.” Mikel Arteta’s press conference is up next and, inevitably, he ends up fielding questions about Eze. Given the 27-year-old is yet to be unveiled, however, he stays tight-lipped. “Nothing to comment,” he says. “I can never talk about any player that is not part of our group yet.” There has been some movement in the transfer market over the last few hours. In the Championship, Sheffield United have brought in the former Norwich and Everton centre-back Ben Godfrey on a season-long loan from Atalanta. In the Premier League, Chelsea have confirmed the departure of Renato Veiga to Villarreal on a permanent deal thought to be worth £25.6m. Meanwhile Bournemouth have bade farewell to Luis Sinisterra, who has joined Cruzeiro in Brazil on loan. Before Bournemouth welcome Wolves to the Vitality Stadium tomorrow, Andoni Iraola has suggested Ryan Christie is in the mix to play after a long layoff owing to groin surgery. “Ryan has been training pretty normally this week. I hope he trains without any problems today and he can get involved tomorrow. He comes without months of playing, but I am seeing him at a good level.” While Eze’s move is still to be announced officially, David Raya, the Arsenal goalkeeper, has been talking about how he and his teammates have helped the club’s new signings settle in. “We know the team has been strengthened and we signed quality players that are going to be massive for the success of this club. I’m very happy with everyone and I think it’s very easy to integrate into this dressing room. “We have welcomed them with open arms. We try to be as a group and try to welcome the players as well as possible, to settle in as quickly as possible, so that they can just focus on football and helping the team.” Guardiola is asked about incomings and outgoings in the transfer market, but doesn’t give much away. “I don’t know,” he says, when asked about reports that Manuel Akanji and Savinho might move on. “They are our players and we will see what happens. A few things are going to happen and we will see.” My turn again, is it? It certainly looks that way. Guardiola has also confirmed that Ederson is available to face Spurs, but he is yet to decide whether the Brazilian or James Trafford will start. “We will decide tomorrow or tonight after dinner. I am happy with [Trafford], the new players always bring a new energy and James brings his youth and desire to play for the club he grew up at. “I said many times it was just his first game [against Wolves], we just have to be consistent and we have to be better and improve.” More from Pep on its way. But now it’s time to hand you back to Will Magee. Enjoy your afternoon. Pep Guardiola is speaking to the press and has some positive teams news ahead of Manchester City’s home game with Tottenham on Saturday. Rodri and Phil Foden both missed the opening 4-0 win against Wolves at Molineux but they’re ready for the visit of Spurs, says Pep. Rodri and Phil were out last game, but for just the reason of lack of training and rhythm they didn’t travel to Palermo. They were not ready for 90 minutes against Wolves, but they are ready for tomorrow. I just want consistent Rodri. That’s all. I don’t have any doubts about his potential and quality. He’s still the best player in the world until we elect a new one in a few months. I have no doubts. Consistency in training, games, and after everything will be fine. Uefa is facing pressure to push back its deadline for separating ownership structures after a turbulent summer in which a handful of clubs, including Crystal Palace, were denied access to European competitions due to multi-club ownership rule-breaches. Matt Hughes and Nick Ames with this report. A few more stats ahead of tonight’s 8pm kick-off. Chelsea have won five of their previous seven Premier League encounters with West Ham (D1 L1). The Blues have 32 wins in the competition against West Ham, a record they can only better against Tottenham (37 wins). West Ham have a decent recent record in home encounters with Chelsea, winning four, drawing two, and losing two of the last eight. Computer says woe. West Ham are only given a 22% of beating Chelsea tonight according to the Opta supercomputer. The Hammers have collected just nine points from as many home games played under Graham Potter so that looks fair. No West Ham manager has won fewer than 10 points in their first 10 home games in the competition, with Alan Curbishley and Avram Grant both earning the lowest with 10. Fulham fans worried about a shortage of signings can breathe a sigh of relief. Then again, even a lengthy rummage through the outer margins of Transfermarkt may struggle to find Alex Dilling. Erm, that’s because he’s a chef. From Fulham’s Insta: “Introducing our incredible line-up of chefs on rotation in The Gourmet restaurant for the 25/26 season.” That’s the grub sorted then. Now for a few new players maybe. Thanks Yara. Before we hear from that trio, here’s a couple of lines from Arne Slot yesterday. Liverpool have been leaking goals – two in both the Community Shield and their opening Premier League game – so he’s glad to have Ryan Gravenberch back from suspension. If he is the same player as he was last season, that could help us a lot. If you just simply look at the second goal we conceded [against Bournemouth], they could just go from one side from the 18-yard box to the other side without being attacked, which was smart because Virgil [van Dijk] and Ibou [Konate] needed to go back because it was a four-versus-two situation. I think if you look back at last season and every single time he played, Ryan would have been in that position and for him not being there and us playing with very good players but very attack-minded players, that hurt us in that goal, for example, and that wasn’t the first time where we lacked a player in that position on a counter-attack for the other team. Normally, if he brings his normal level, it would definitely help us to have him back again. We need to find the right balance by not being too open. But that balance will be better with Ryan. Unfortunately, if you want to judge me or us, we now have to play Newcastle and Arsenal, who are normally teams that are going to be above Bournemouth in the league, so it’s even harder to play against them. But with Macca [Alexis Mac Allister] being back, with Ryan in his normal position, I expect us to be even better prepared for the counter-attack than we were in this 2-2 moment, because I’ve watched the game twice back and I don’t think – apart from the two goals, especially the second one as a counter-attack – there were many other counter-attacks from Bournemouth. But if it leads to a goal, it’s of course a big story. For us conceding two, that’s too much in a home game, that’s too open. We have some press conferences from Pep Guardiola, Ruben Amorim and Mikel Arteta coming up. Here is David Tindall to steer you through the next hour. Earlier we confirmed Ipswich’s signing of Kasey McAteer. Here is what he had to say upon joining the club: I’m delighted to be here and can’t wait. It’s a very attractive project which is being built here and I want to add myself to that. I’ve been to Ipswich as an away player and I know how good the support is. As soon as I heard Ipswich were interested it was the only move I wanted to make. The aim is to get promoted again and that’s what we will push for every day. I want to be a part of that and I aspire to be the best version of myself, which is something I will be looking to bring to the squad. I’m excited to get to work with the boys and the staff and I can’t wait to meet the fans. Graham Potter will lead West Ham against his former side Chelsea tonight and says his team are “a work in progress”. The Hammers lost their opening Premier League match to Sunderland and it will be a tough task to bounce back against Enzo Maresca’s team. We know we have to do more in terms of results and improve our performance. The players were gutted after the [Sunderland] game, and there was optimism and positivity, and now it is up to us to react. We have to get more out of the squad that we have. We also look to improve, we will do that together, as a club, we will do that collectively and try to find the best solution. It’s great when you’ve had a bad result, everyone thinks the silver bullet will come from outside and save us all. History would suggest it doesn’t work like that. It’s about being a team and accepting the criticism when a bad result comes but to get on with your work and accept responsibility. Last night Nottingham Forest confirmed the signing of Douglas Luiz from Juventus on a season-long loan with a conditional obligation to make the deal permanent next summer. The 27-year-old midfielder left Aston Villa last year to join the Serie A side for £42.35m on a five-year contract. I am really happy to be here, it’s a big club and I decided to come here because I can see the ambition the club has. I am so excited to start with the team and give my best for the shirt and the fans. Lots of rumours of Chelsea looking at possible defensive reinforcements after Levi Colwill’s injury and Wesley Fofana reportedly not being happy at the club but Enzo Maresca put those rumours to rest in his press conference last night ahead of tonight’s game at West Ham. The manager said the club were looking at “internal solutions” and reiterated as much when pressed about possible signings. We are trying to find internal solutions. I repeat again. Maybe I need to improve my English. On Fofana’s mood at the club and abuse he faced from fans after removing mentions of Chelsea on his social media: I speak with Wes every day, he is very happy, especially because he is back from injury. He is joining all the sessions and is very happy. Wes is happy, we are happy and there is nothing to add. If there is abuse on Instagram that’s never good – not good for Wes or any player but is something that we unfortunately cannot control. The Liverpool youngster Lewis Koumas is close to agreeing a loan move to Championship promotion hopefuls Birmingham City. The 19-year-old Wales forward spent last season on loan in the division with Stoke City, where he scored six goals in 49 appearances in all competitions. Ipswich have signed Kasey McAteer from Championship rivals Leicester in a deal worth about £12m. The Republic of Ireland winger is a graduate of Leicester’s academy and previously spent time on loan at AFC Wimbledon and Forest Green Rovers. McAteer represents Ipswich’s seventh summer signing, with Chuba Akpom, on loan from Ajax, and Ashley Young high-profile arrivals. Ipswich, who visit Preston on Saturday, have so far failed in their attempts to sign Middlesbrough’s Hayden Hackney, who has been linked with a move to the Premier League. Leeds head to Arsenal tomorrow and Daniel Farke has promised his side will not “sell our DNA” to get the win. We won’t sell out our DNA and park the bus. If you just try to defend you have no chance to survive there. We will try to be there with many periods with the ball. Will try to create chances to scare them. There will be periods where we suffer and we have to be well structured The Leeds manager was also asked if Dominic Calvert-Lewin was any closer to making his debut for the club. We’ll see. Each and every training session with the team is important for him. He had a long summer break, followed by a few weeks of individual training, where his general endurance was at a really good level. However, what he has missed is team training, and for that reason, each session is crucial. He has made a decent impression, already well integrated, and you can see from day to day that he is growing. When we will use him for the first time, we’ll decide spontaneously. From a fitness point of view, he’s in good shape. Wrexham will hope to get their first league win of the season tomorrow against Sheffield Wednesday and their 43-year wait for a win in English football’s second tier. The ambitious Championship new boys have made a splash in the transfer market since sealing a stunning third straight promotion last term with 10 summer arrivals. “We have had disappointing results,” said Conor Coady, who signed from Leicester earlier in the summer. We’ve come away from the games thinking we should have won at least one of them, especially the Southampton one where we were 1-0 up so late. But are we improving. Have we showed we can play? Yeah, of course but we need to get them wins on the board. We’re there to win games. It’s as simple as that. We’ll keep trying, we’ll keep learning, we’ll keep getting better and hopefully it’ll come soon. Howe has also been asked about the atmosphere at St James’ Park, which might be extra hostile given the circumstances: The first home game is always going to be electric. I love experience those nights with the energy that the crowd bring us and I have no doubt that this will be a really passionate display from the home support. We need to harness that and use it but not be reckless with it, we need to concentrate on the game and not get too emotional. Eddie Howe was asked specifically about Alexander Isak’s social media post claiming promises from Newcastle were broken: There is always two sides to every story. My job is to support him and care for him, and we will see where we are in a week’s time. I hope I can work with him again and get him back to his best. At the moment [reintegration into the squad] is not an option for us so rather than talk hypotheticals, I’d rather talk when we get to that point and try to get the best for Alex and get the best for the team. Until the point, we are better off focusing on the players we have available for the team. Alex is an outstanding player and a very good person and a good character. He wants to succeed in his career and this has been a really difficult situation for him and for the players that we have to see us without him. If Alex decided to come back and play for us the players would welcome him back. Without Isak, Newcastle will probably play Anthony Gordon as a No 9. The 24-year-old primarily plays as a winger but Howe believes he is more than capable of leading the line. He has done it enough to be able to do the job really well for the team. I have played him there a number of times both as a starter and as a substitute. He plays it differently to other strikers but that can be a positive in the respect that he has devastating pace and a strong work ethic. Of course he’s scored goals historically from wide areas but also from central areas and I think you can over play the change of position and I think he enjoys the role and he played really well last week. He had a lot of chances and a lot of shots so I thought it was a good display from him. Thanks Will and hello everyone! Lots to be expected from these final 10 days of the window. Let’s see what else Howe has said on Isak and the game against Liverpool on Monday. Having steered you through the early morning slot, it’s time for me to hand over to Yara El-Shaboury for the next few hours. Who’s going to get the official Eze announcement? It could be Yara! Scenes if so. Rúben Dias has signed a two-year contract extension with Manchester City that keeps him at the club until 2029. The defender is intent on helping Pep Guardiola’s team claim more silverware after last season’s barren campaign. The 28-year-old said: “My job now is to be the best I can be for the duration of this contract, so that I can play my part in helping us challenge for more silverware. “I want to thank my teammates, Pep, Hugo [Viana], the coaching staff and everyone at the club. This is such a special place, and I am grateful every single day for the support I receive. Now the hard work begins, and I want to promise the fans that I will give everything to win more trophies and bring more success to City.” The Portuguese centre-back has won 10 trophies in five years at City, making 223 appearances in all competitions. Asked how he is dealing with the Isak transfer saga on a personal level, Howe adds: “I think these situations are far from ideal, talking press-wise, and a lot of the attention has gone on to that rather than the team and our preparation. “But as soon as I leave here I’m back with the team, I’m back preparing training, taking training, delivering meetings, speaking to individual players and trying to get the group in the best frame of mind possible. So the job never changes, but the outside perception is one that’s of course totally different to normal.” Eddie Howe is speaking to the media ahead of Newcastle’s game against Liverpool on Monday evening and, unsurprisingly, everyone seems to be asking about Alexander Isak. The Newcastle manager concedes “there’s been no change” in the impasse between the club and the striker, who is pushing hard for a move to Anfield, and that he won’t be part of the squad when Arne Slot’s side visit St James’ Park. “He’s contracted to us, he’s our player,” Howe says. “My wish is that he would be playing on Monday night with us, but he won’t be, and that’s regrettable at this moment. But 100% I want to see him back in a Newcastle shirt.” Is anyone on Eze watch outside the Emirates at the moment? Perhaps with a handmade welcome sign on A4 paper and cardboard? Feel free to email in with any updates if so. Some Eze-themed street art has already popped up in the local area, while the latest is that his medical is imminent (or possibly already under way). Sheffield Wednesday supporters are planning a protest outside the Thai embassy against the club’s owner, Dejphon Chansiri, over his running of the club. London-based fans will be joined by those travelling down from South Yorkshire to show their upset with the running of the club. Owls fans will also boycott the team’s match against Leeds at Hillsborough on Tuesday in the Carabao Cup. Supporters will instead be encouraged to watch the game on a big screen outside the local working men’s club. Supporters want Chansiri to sell the club but movement on a takeover has been slow, to say the least. They have previously held protests at their opening match against Leicester, when fans did not take their seats for the first five minutes and had a plane fly overhead with an anti-Chansiri message. That was followed by a whistle protest in the first home game of the season against Stoke. “The London Owls are planning a protest against Dejphon Chansiri’s ownership of our wonderful football club,” a fan statement read. “We might be 160-plus miles from Hillsborough but our members feel just as strongly as those thousands closer to S6 that ‘Enough is Enough’ and unless Chansiri sells up soon then the club faces the prospect of financial ruin.” It’s Friday morning and rather than choosing life, choosing a job, choosing a career or choosing a family, we’re about to choose another weekend of Premier League football. Round two of the 2025-26 season – still feels a bit weird to write that, the sands of time are slipping away at a terrifying rate aren’t they? – begins with Chelsea’s visit to West Ham this evening, but there will be a full slate of press conferences and team news to come. There’s also the small matter of Eberechi Eze completing his move to Arsenal which, given the reaction it has already elicited online, is bound to make it a difficult day for Tottenham fans on social media. What better way to shut out the noise than joining us here? As for the neutrals in that particular transfer wrangle, there will also be plenty of tidbits from the transfer market, EFL, Scottish Premiership and European football. So grab yourself a brew, open a sneaky extra tab at work and let’s settle in for a day of minimum productivity and maximum Beautiful Game. Here are a couple of things to get you started:
