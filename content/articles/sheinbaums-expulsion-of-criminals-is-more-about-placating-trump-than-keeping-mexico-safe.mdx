  Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has denied that the transfer of 26
  alleged cartel members to the United States was part of any kind of deal with
  Washington and was instead about her country’s own security priorities. This
  week’s expulsion marked the second time Mexico had sent top criminals to the
  US this year: in February, Mexican authorities handed over 29 cartel members,
  including druglord Rafael Caro Quintero, who was responsible for the murder of
  a DEA agent in 1985. The latest transfers took place after US authorities
  vowed that prosecutors would not seek the death penalty in any of the cases.
  But despite the claims from Sheinbaum and others in her government, analysts
  say these transfers are less about Mexico’s national security and more about
  appeasing Donald Trump, who has made going after drug cartels a hallmark
  policy of his administration – even going so far as to designate several
  Mexican criminal groups as foreign terrorist organizations. “I think
  [Sheinbaum] believes she can depressurize by sending a bunch of narcs that are
  already in custody … as an offering to placate Washington’s thirst for Mexican
  criminals,” said Tony Payan, a Mexico expert at Rice University’s Baker
  Institute for Public Policy. “They’re simply being put on a plane and offered
  on a silver platter.” Sheinbaum said that the expulsion of 26 criminals from
  organized crime groups including the Jalisco New Generation and Sinaloa
  cartels was unrelated to efforts to reach a new security agreement with the
  United States. Among those handed over to US authorities were Abigael González
  Valencia, a leader of Los Cuinis,”, a criminal group closely allied with the
  Jalisco cartel, as well as Roberto Salazar, wanted in connection with the
  slaying of a Los Angeles county sheriff’s deputy in 2008. “In all of these
  cases, the extradition or the transfer of these members of organized crime,
  the decision is for the safety of our country,” she said during a news
  conference on Wednesday. “Nor do they have anything to do with the security
  agreement; they are sovereign decisions taken for the security of our
  country.” The Mexican security minister, Omar García Harfuch, echoed her
  comments, saying the move had been taken to stop convicted criminals from
  continuing to run their organizations from behind bars. “This action was taken
  to prevent the continued ordering of kidnappings, extortion, homicides and
  other crimes from prison,” he said. Sheinbaum has taken numerous other actions
  to crack down on drug trafficking in an effort to appease the Trump
  administration, including deploying thousands of troops to the state of
  Sinaloa, a cartel stronghold, arresting dozens of top-level narcos and seizing
  large quantities of fentanyl. But Sheinbaum still faces increasing pressure
  from the Trump administration in terms of economic tariffs which would hobble
  the Mexican economy. Perhaps not coincidentally, the timing of tariff
  discussions have been closely followed by the transfer of wanted criminals
  from Mexico to the US. The transfers in February came as officials in Mexico
  were attempting to put off the Trump administration’s imposition of tariffs on
  Mexican imports. This latest round of 26 criminal transfers comes just a few
  weeks after Trump spoke with Sheinbaum and agreed to delay the threatened 30%
  tariffs for another 90 days. “At the end of the day, Mexico hasn’t faced the
  levels of tariffs that were supposed to take effect because of fentanyl
  trafficking on February 1,” said Cecilia Farfán-Méndez, a security analyst at
  the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime. “These types of
  transfers which for the Mexican government are not necessarily costly are a
  way of making progress in DC.” Sheinbaum “is trying to show Washington that
  she’s pliable, she’s cooperative, she is responsive, and she’s willing to talk
  and she’s willing to concede”, Payan added. Still, according to Ilan Katz,
  head of the criminal law commission at the Mexican Bar Association, the claim
  by security minister Harfuch that these criminals continue to present a threat
  in Mexico even behind bars is not without merit. “Narcos in Mexico have had a
  lot of operational capacity even while in confinement,” he said. “One of the
  solutions is to effectively remove any drug trafficker from the country who
  might have communication with their criminal groups from prison.” The two mass
  transfers are also significant in that they are not technically extraditions,
  but rather the Mexican government simply acting unilaterally without the due
  process normally required by the justice system to complete an extradition.
  “Drug traffickers in Mexico have been able to evade extraditions to the United
  States through a series of injunctions and suspensions,” said Katz. “It’s the
  lesser of two evils to send this guy right now and comply with the extradition
  order rather than to continue keeping him here because of those suspensions.”
  But this too is problematic, says Farfán-Méndez, if Mexico is simply exporting
  its criminals without due process to be dealt with elsewhere. “It creates
  questions about whether this represents justice in Mexico,” she said. “What
  does it say about our criminal justice system?”
