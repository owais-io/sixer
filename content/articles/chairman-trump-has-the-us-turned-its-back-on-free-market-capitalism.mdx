  When Ronald Reagan became the first US president to address China’s Great Hall
  of the People in 1984, he did not waste an opportunity to school his audience
  on the benefits of the American way. He boiled down his central economic
  ideology, and that of his Republican party – that governments should get out
  of the way, allow companies, industries and markets the space the thrive,
  without intervention – into a simple mantra: trust the people. “These three
  words are not only the heart and soul of American history, but the most
  powerful force for human progress in the world today,” Reagan argued in
  Beijing. “Those who ignore this vital truth will condemn their countries to
  fall farther and farther behind in the world’s competition for economic
  leadership.” While Chairman Mao Zedong, founder of the People’s Republic of
  China, had been fundamentally opposed to free markets and capitalism, Reagan
  argued that societies which enjoyed “the most spectacular progress” were the
  ones where people had been “permitted to think for themselves, make economic
  decisions, and benefit from their own risks”. What would Reagan make of a
  country that, in a matter of weeks, became the largest shareholder in a
  microchip manufacturer; demanded a cut of firms’ overseas sales in exchange
  for export licenses; and fired a statistics official after government data
  embarrassed its ruling party? In just the past week, senior government
  officials in the country have pushed to exert control over its central bank;
  ordered a tech giant to strike a deal with a supportive media conglomerate;
  and successfully urged a restaurant chain to reverse a rebrand. This is not
  China. It is the United States, under a Republican president, in 2025. Donald
  Trump, rather than adhere to the principles of free markets, small government
  and unbound capitalism that his party championed for a generation, is making
  his influence felt in every corner of corporate America. The
  commander-in-chief is also chairman of the economy. Chairman Trump secured a
  “golden share” in US Steel while approving Nippon Steel’s controversial
  $14.9bn takeover of the steelworks, and says South Korea will provide $350bn
  for investments “owned and controlled by the United States, and selected by
  myself, as President”, as part of a trade deal he brokered. He converted
  nearly $9bn in grants for Intel into a 10% stake in the chipmaker – reportedly
  in exchange for his support, after publicly demanding its CEO resign – and top
  Trump officials have suggested more companies are in their sights. Chairman
  Trump is challenging the independence of the Federal Reserve and trying to
  obtain a majority on the central bank’s board of governors. This week, he even
  tried to fire one over unconfirmed claims of mortgage fraud, made by an ally
  inside his administration. He also fired the head of the Bureau of Labor
  Statistics hours after official data revealed a sharp slowdown in jobs growth
  on his watch, claiming without evidence that the numbers had been “rigged” (he
  tapped an ardent supporter to replace her). Rather than allow privately owned
  companies to go about their business, without the involvement of public
  officials and political leaders, Chairman Trump routinely intervenes. Under a
  “little deal” he struck with Nvidia, the world’s most highly valued company
  will provide 15% of certain chip sales in China. Apple, threatened with steep
  tariffs by the president, came to the White House bearing gifts: $100bn in
  further US investment, and a souvenir with a 24-karat gold base. No issue is
  too small for Chairman Trump. He waded into the debate over the mid-sized
  casual-dining chain Cracker Barrel’s changed logo earlier this week,
  dispatching his deputy chief of staff to speak with the firm and ultimately
  helping convince it to reverse the decision – weeks after pushing Coca-Cola to
  launch a drink with cane sugar, rather than corn syrup. All the while, Trump’s
  Republican party continues to accuse political opponents of trying to erode
  capitalism, pursuing socialism and threatening to undermine free markets. The
  president’s supporters and officials deny his policies do any such thing. A
  proposal by Zohran Mamdani, Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, to
  create five city-owned grocery stores, is “straight out of the Marxist
  playbook”, according to the Republican congressman Mike Lawler. “New Yorkers
  deserve solutions, not socialist fantasies that have failed spectacularly
  every time they’ve been tried,” Lawler argued last month. A spokesperson for
  Lawler did not respond to a request for comment on whether some of Trump’s
  policies could be described in similar terms. But asked about conservative
  criticism of the Intel deal on Wednesday, Kevin Hassett, director of the White
  House national economic council, told CNN: “It’s certainly not socialism.”
  Other rightwingers are not so sure. The Kentucky senator Rand Paul is among
  the most prominent Republicans to suggest otherwise. “If socialism is
  government owning the means of production, wouldn’t the government owning part
  of Intel be a step toward socialism?” he asked on X earlier this month.
  “Terrible idea.” The conservative talk radio host Erick Erickson went further.
  “You can’t just be against socialism when the left does it,” he said last
  week. “If you’re not against socialism overall, guess what? You’re going to
  get socialism.” “So if you support socialism”, Erickson added, “apparently
  Donald Trump is your guy.” Such arguments miss the point, according to Tad
  DeHaven, an economic and fiscal policy analyst for the libertarian Cato
  Institute. There’s no little gold book for Trump to rival Mao’s little red
  one. “We’re so focused on isms: communism, socialism … and they’re not,” he
  said of the administration. “There’s no strategic plan here. There’s no
  guiding philosophy, other than Donald Trump’s in charge. “Donald Trump’s
  exercising power. Donald Trump doesn’t care about institutions, or
  constraints, or checks and balances. Donald Trump’s just going to do what
  Donald Trump wants to do.” Call it Trumpalism. Economic ideologies are
  typically built on principles, from the free market foundations of capitalism
  to the socialist pillars of collective ownership and control. But this one –
  crafted by a man who rarely allows fundamental long-term positions to prevent
  him from saying, or doing, what he wants in the short term – is different.
  Back in 2008, with the US auto industry on the brink, Trump said the federal
  government “should stand behind” the carmakers “100%”. Come 2015, however,
  this firm stance had dissolved. “You could have let it go bankrupt, frankly,
  and rebuilt itself … or you could have done it the way it went,” he said of
  the auto industry. “Either way would have been acceptable.” The lack of a
  position on whether or not the federal government should have taken stakes in
  manufacturers, or allowed them to go bankrupt, was an early example of
  Trumpalism. Ideology takes a backseat to the instincts and impulses of a
  domineering chairman, from one week to the next. “This is just scattershot,
  it’s day by day,” DeHaven said. “There’s no plan. There’s no strategy. It’s
  just power and leverage, and however they can obtain it for the boss, however
  the boss himself can obtain it. That is the modus operandi.” Whatever happened
  to trust the people? “You can argue exactly as to when,” said DeHaven, “but
  the Republican party that I grew up with – the Reagan Republicans – that party
  is dead and buried”.
