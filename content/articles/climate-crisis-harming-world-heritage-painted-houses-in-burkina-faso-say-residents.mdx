  A world heritage site that was once a famous tourist destination is suffering
  from signs of disintegration, as climate change affects weather patterns. The
  wavy-walled houses covered with singular geometric lines of the Royal Court of
  Tiébélé in Burkina Faso, established in the 16th century, are recognisable all
  over the world. The paintings represent the thoughts, culture, and religion of
  the Kassena people, literally written on the walls. Tiébélé in southern
  Burkina Faso is one of only four Burkinabé sites on the Unesco world heritage
  list. But it is now on the brink of extinction. “Nowadays, it’s easier to
  build with metal roofs and cement,” says Abdou Anè, a young resident in
  Tiébélé. For many years, Tiébélé was an unmissable tourist destination in
  Burkina Faso. But the jihadist violence that has been rumbling through the
  country and its neighbours, Mali and Niger, since 2015 is deterring visitors.
  To reach Tiébélé, for example, a visitor has to cross a bridge known as
  Nazinon, which was attacked some time ago. Drivers have to keep to 30km/h and
  it is under heavy military control. The failed coup d’état of 2015 and
  subsequent unrest has dampened the tourism industry, with numbers declining
  every year. Meanwhile, the threat to the delicate structures from climate
  change is growing. “To paint the walls, they must be completely dry, but now
  the rain is unpredictable, and it has already happened that it starts raining
  while we’re working on restoration,” says Anè. Plastic sheets are not enough
  to protect the paintings. “Even though we are very proud to be recognised as a
  world heritage site, we also need help to keep preserving it.” “Sometimes we
  get rain during periods when we didn’t before. Before, in March or April, we
  would get one rain known as the ‘mango rain’, but today we can get three to
  four rains”, says Anè. “There are trees that no longer produce, and it’s with
  those that we used to build our houses. This worries the population,
  especially the elderly who remember what the climate used to be like, because
  it’s a new kind of change. The rain comes abundantly – more than what people
  expected. It’s a phenomenon people don’t understand. For example, now we are
  in August and there is no rain. People are really worried. Those who have seen
  the seasons of the past and compare them to today are worried. Those who were
  born into this situation don’t understand the change.” In Kassena culture,
  found only in this region of the world, the women are responsible for painting
  the houses. For the unique painted lines, they use pigments extracted from
  laterite stone, clay, basalt, and even cow dung – materials native to the
  region. To fix the markings to the walls, they boil the fruit of the néré
  tree, also known as the “flour tree”, to make a varnish that seals the paint.
  All this knowledge and skill resides in the head of octogenarian Kaye Tintama,
  recognised as a “living human treasure” by Unesco, a living library
  responsible for passing on the decoration techniques and the meanings behind
  the walls and shapes of Tiébélé’s houses to new generations. The award-winning
  architect Francis Kéré has been inspired by the way the Kassena have used
  natural materials to protect themselves from intense heat and heavy rain for
  hundreds of years. “[The] Kassena passed his architecture to the present, to
  the future generations, and this method is inspiring for me,” Kéré told the
  Guardian. The shape of the houses is significant. Round houses such as Ané’s
  are for unmarried men, but those shaped like a figure of eight are for older
  women and unmarried daughters, and rectangular houses are for young couples.
  “They inspired me to use locally available materials to create the habitat,
  but also the way they create, they involve all the community, which is highly
  important for me,” says Kéré. Many of the houses feature a small entrance door
  to prevent animals from coming in, but also to force visitors to kneel, a
  position of vulnerability that allows inhabitants to neutralise a possible
  intruder. The rooftops are designed to dry cereals after the harvest. On the
  walls, reliefs of snakes symbolise the spirits of grandmothers or the cultural
  guardian spirit of the Kassena people, who appears once a year during which
  the population must remain silent and avoid music as it passes. It’s a
  monument under open skies that now coexists with concrete, sheet metal, and
  iron windows. “It’s very hard to find straw to make the roofs,” explains Ané
  as he points to the paillote of his house, destroyed by the wind. The men are
  in charge of building the houses. It takes a month and a mix of earth, straw,
  and logs to build the structure. “Chemical products have weakened the soil,”
  explains Ané, lamenting that the houses no longer last like they used to. In
  this part of the world, the climate crisis is felt in an accelerated way and
  without the resources to face it. Even though Sahel countries contribute only
  1% of global greenhouse gas emissions, they are among those suffering the most
  from its consequences: temperatures have risen 1.5 times faster than the
  global average. Additionally, 80% of Burkina Faso’s population lives from
  agriculture and land-based work.
