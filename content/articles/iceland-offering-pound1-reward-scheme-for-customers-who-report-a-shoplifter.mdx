  The grocery chain Iceland is offering customers who point out a thief a £1
  reward on their loyalty card. The frozen food specialist said that anyone who
  spots a suspected shoplifter in its stores should inform the nearest Iceland
  employee who will verify the incident before adding the reward to the
  individual’s loyalty card for immediate use. Richard Walker, the executive
  chair of the family-owned group, told Channel 5 News that thefts cost the
  retailer £20m and drained resources that could be spent on staff hours or
  lower prices. “Some people see it as a victimless crime, it is not,” he said.
  He said retail crime was happening right across the UK and not just in tough
  urban areas: “The scourge of shoplifting on our high streets continues to
  plague the UK, and the problem is only worsening, with criminal activity
  spreading across, not just big cities, but our market towns and villages too.
  “In order to combat any activity in Iceland stores, we’re encouraging our
  loyal customers to help sound the alarm, and if they do help to catch a
  shoplifter, we’ll top up their Bonus Card to spend in store.” In April
  official figures showed that the number of shoplifting offences recorded by
  police in England and Wales has risen to the highest level on record, passing
  half a million offences in 2024. Retailers say the figures from the Office for
  National Statistics “severely underestimate” the scale of the problem, which
  would amount to only two incidents for each shop a year. The British Retail
  Consortium (BRC) has pointed to a rise in shoplifting by organised gangs
  stealing to order. This week the policing minister, Dame Diana Johnson, warned
  the public against confronting shoplifters and suggested that retailers should
  not display expensive items such as alcohol at the front of stores. Her
  comments followed a claim by the Conservative police and crime commissioner
  for Thames Valley, Matthew Barber, that people had a duty to stand up to
  shoplifters rather than relying solely on police officers. Retailers say that
  shops have been seen as a soft target since a 2014 change in the law in
  England and Wales under which those stealing goods worth less than £200 are
  usually spared any prison term. Big chains have also been accused of
  contributing to the rise in crime by reducing staff numbers and using more
  self-service checkouts and handheld “scan and shop” devices in stores to keep
  costs down. However, businesses say they have spent millions of pounds on
  improving security in recent years, including installing facial recognition
  and AI-aided cameras. The government has set out legislation to help tackle
  shoplifting, including removing the £200 threshold for “low-level” theft. The
  crime and policing bill, which is working its way through parliament, will
  also introduce a stand-alone offence of assaulting a retail worker. The
  government has promised funds to tackle organised gangs involved in shop
  theft.
