  Prominent Democratic lawmakers and legal advocates have called for the new
  immigration detention camp at Fort Bliss military base to be shut down amid
  accusations of lack of external oversight and concerns over access to legal
  services. Camp East Montana began full operation last weekend as a sprawling
  tent facility across acres of military land in the eastern part of El Paso, on
  the US-Mexico border in west Texas, amid rapid expansion plans and much
  controversy. Dubbed the “Lone Star Lockup” by Republicans, the new facility
  currently accommodates around 1,000 beds for men. It is set to expand to 5,000
  beds at a cost of around $1.24bn in private contracts, making it the largest
  among the ranks of immigration detention facilities already working overtime
  across the US. With an integrated operation to run deportation flights, the
  Texas military complex is set to transform part of itself into the deportation
  hub it was forecast to become for Donald Trump’s hard-right anti-immigration
  agenda. After a brief tour of the site on Thursday, Texas Democratic
  congresswoman Jasmine Crockett said: “What I saw today was a dangerous misuse
  of military land and resources to cage human beings. This attempt doesn’t make
  our country safer, it wastes taxpayer dollars, rips families apart, and takes
  us backwards as a nation.” El Paso Democratic congresswoman Veronica Escobar
  called the new camp “massive” and decried the $1.2bn price tag when such a sum
  could elevate public services in a city like El Paso. She told local media it
  would be a strain on the city’s resources. With the thermometer relentlessly
  in the 90s Fahrenheit or higher in the summer, and sandstorms a regular
  occurrence, it is unclear how conditions for detainees will be managed. “We
  demand the immediate closure of Camp East Montana,” said Samantha Singleton,
  policy director of the Border Network for Human Rights. She said: “The opening
  of the country’s largest Ice detention site has been treated like a
  ribbon-cutting ceremony by the Trump administration, an event to celebrate,
  when it should have been an alarm, a moment for reflection and a call to
  change the course of Fort Bliss.” She added: “The shameful use of a military
  base for immigration detention is a disgrace to the values of our city and our
  country” and called for “rigorous oversight”, pledging that “we will document
  every abuse”. Ice, part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has said
  Camp East Montana will serve as a short-term processing site to “decompress”
  other detention centers amid accelerating arrests and will handle deportations
  via Ice air operations. The camp has been constructed under a Department of
  Defense contract. Acquisition Logistics, based in Henrico county, Virginia was
  awarded a $231.8m initial contract to establish and operate the facility,
  which Ice will manage and, the federal agency said, be in line with its
  detention standards. Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs
  at the DHS issued a statement saying the Trump administration is working “at
  turbo speed” on mass deportations. “The Fort Bliss facility will offer
  everything a traditional Ice detention facility offers, including access to
  legal representation and a law library, access to visitation, recreational
  space, medical treatment space and nutritionally balanced meals. It also
  provides necessary accommodations for disabilities, diet, and religious
  beliefs,” the statement said. Crockett said she briefed the American Civil
  Liberties Union (ACLU) and several immigrant rights advocates in El Paso and
  southern New Mexico on her observations, as some legal advocates have been
  unable to meet with detainees. The ACLU said Fort Bliss was used during
  Trump’s first term to detain children who were separated from their families
  and in 2021, under the Biden administration, government investigators reported
  children detained at the base suffered emotional distress amid inadequate
  staffing and care. Children were under held under the authority of the
  Department of Health and Human Services, while the adults detained now are
  held by Ice. The base was used for internment during World War II and
  detention of Mexican refugees previously, in harsh conditions, with the ACLU
  calling it “a staging ground for policies driven by cruelty and exclusion” and
  Camp East Montana “another dark chapter”. Florida on Friday appealed the
  court-ordered closure of another recent and highly-controversial detention
  camp in the Everglades called Alligator Alcatraz. Osvaldo Grimaldo, a policy
  and advocacy strategist for border and immigrants’ rights at the ACLU of
  Texas, said Camp East Montana “is part of a broader effort at both the state
  and federal levels to instill fear and accelerate mass deportations, no matter
  the human cost, and far too often without any due process”. Ice has pledged to
  provide legal representation. But Grimaldo said there was no guarantee. “When
  people are locked away in remote facilities, far from courts and far from
  their families, the right to legal representation becomes an empty promise,”
  he said. Melissa Lopez, the executive director of Estrella del Paso, a social
  services organization, said she worried that as the camp fills, medical
  services and care of detainees will “quickly fall to the wayside”, adding that
  the rapidly-constructed camp was “a shock to us, a shock to due process and a
  shock to…basic human decency.” Texas Republican congressman John Cornyn said
  the facility would be used for those with final deportation orders and those
  with criminal convictions as a short term processing location before expulsion
  from the US. He pledged there would be conventional congressional oversight.
  Fort Bliss has already been used to fly deportees on military aircraft to
  Guantánamo Bay and Central and South America under the second Trump
  administration. “We already know that the use of military bases for mass
  detention is wasteful, intentionally cruel and unnecessary. Yet here we are,”
  said Marisa Limón Garza, the executive director of Las Americas Immigrant
  Advocacy Center. “It’s really just about targeting people, racial profiling
  and rounding up of numbers to meet quotas, which is ignoring humanity and any
  kind of right to being a dignified person,” she said.
