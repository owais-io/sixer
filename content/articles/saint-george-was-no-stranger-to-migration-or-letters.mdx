  Two correspondents assert on your letters page that Saint George was born in
  Turkey (The truth about flying the flag of Saint George, 27 August). Insofar
  as his biography is known, he was born in Cappadocia when it was still part of
  the undivided Roman empire (as was that part of Britain now called England).
  The primary language in Cappadocia was then Greek, alongside Persian and
  Armenian (while Britain’s was Celtic). The first Turks arrived almost eight
  centuries later, and its Turkification was a millennium-long process of
  migration, assimilation and persecution (the Anglo-Saxonification of Britain
  having been rather more rapid). Which just goes to show that there is nothing
  new about population movement and cultural change. Natalie Naïri Quinn
  Abingdon • I was dismayed to see not one but two published letters stating
  that Saint George was from Turkey. This is akin to stating that “Julius Caesar
  was from Italy” or that “the prophet Muhammad was from Saudi Arabia”. If we
  are serious about stopping the far right, we should at least try to be
  historically and geopolitically accurate. Fergus Tyrrell London • Have an
