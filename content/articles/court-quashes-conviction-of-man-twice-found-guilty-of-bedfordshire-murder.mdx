  The court of appeal has quashed the conviction of a man who has spent 28 years
  in jail for a violent murder of which he has always claimed he was innocent.
  Justin Plummer, now 54, was convicted of the murder of 38-year-old Janice
  Cartwright-Gilbert in 1998, a year after she was fatally attacked at the
  building site of her future home near Wilden in Bedfordshire. Her body was
  found in a burning caravan with multiple stab wounds, a knife and scissors
  sticking out of her neck. She had been throttled with an electrical flex.
  Plummer was a prolific burglar engaged in a robbing spree at the time and had
  clocked up 24 convictions in the four months leading up to the killing. But
  none of the convictions involved violence. There was no DNA linking Plummer to
  the crime, no stolen items were recovered, and no witnesses placed him at the
  scene. The original conviction relied almost entirely on footwear mark
  evidence – an imprint on Cartwright-Gilbert’s head alleged to match a size 6
  Nike Air Screech trainer that Plummer wore. The case also partly hinged on the
  prosecution’s argument that Plummer’s brother, Adam, had discussed his sibling
  being a suspect with their mother before he was arrested and therefore Plummer
  must have been guilty. The expert witness who provided the trainer evidence,
  David Lewin, was a dentist unqualified in footwear forensics. At the original
  trial, the judge said in summing up Lewin’s evidence: “It was one of the
  clearest marks he had ever seen. No other shoe could have caused it.” But
  Lewin’s method, using imaging overlays, was later ruled “neither validated nor
  suitable … even by late 1990s standards”. In 2021, the Criminal Cases Review
  Commission (CCRC) referred Plummer’s conviction back to the court of appeal on
  these grounds. In 2023, Plummer, who slept on the floor in prison to protest
  his innocence, had his conviction overturned. The court ruled that the expert
  evidence was unreliable and that the verdict was unsafe. But Plummer was never
  released. The appeal court’s ruling was immediately challenged by the Crown
  Prosecution Service and Plummer was convicted again in a retrial in June 2023.
  This time the prosecution relied on an alleged confession made by Plummer to a
  now deceased cellmate, Christopher Dunne. Dunne, who had schizophrenia, was a
  police informant and had not been cross-examined at the original trial.
  Plummer’s legal team argued that the hearsay evidence was inherently flawed
  and unreliable. On Wednesday, in less than 10 minutes, the court of appeal
  quashed the 2023 conviction. The three judges ruled: “We consider that this
  conviction is unsafe because the Dunne hearsay evidence should have been
  withdrawn from the jury even if, which we have not decided, it was properly
  admitted in the first place. For the reasons we have explained, the Adam
  Plummer evidence does not support the Dunne evidence but rather gives rise to
  further serious concerns.” Plummer’s solicitor, Annalisa Moscardini, said:
  “Justin Plummer is finally vindicated for his 28-year fight against this
  murder conviction. Due to his refusal to accept his guilt for a crime he has
  always been clear he did not commit, he has served far longer than his minimum
  term of 16 years. Justin’s determination and resilience has finally paid
  dividends and he will sleep tonight a free man, for the first time in 28
  years.” His barrister, Katy Thorne KC, said: “Permitting a dead cell
  confession witness in a trial on an allegation of this age was simply unfair.
  Prisoners have all sorts of motives to give false cell confession evidence and
  law reform is needed to stop such evidence being part of criminal trials. Now
  Justin is being released with little support from the state. The system has to
  be reformed to give proper support to such victims of miscarriage of justice.”
