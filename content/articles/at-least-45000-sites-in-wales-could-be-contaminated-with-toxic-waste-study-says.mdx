  Research from Friends of the Earth Cymru has found that at least 45,000 sites
  across Wales could be contaminated with toxic waste but have never been
  adequately inspected, leaving communities and wildlife vulnerable to a
  potential environmental crisis. Despite Wales’s extensive industrial history,
  Tuesday’s publication found that due to a lack of funding and oversight, only
  82 sites across the country have ever been fully examined and classified as
  contaminated, meaning the actual scale of the threat is unknown. Former
  industrial areas, landfills and quarries can contain contaminants such as
  heavy metals, oil, tar, solvents, gases and radioactive substances. The
  environmental campaigners submitted freedom of information requests to all 22
  Welsh councils and reviewed publicly available data. Only 11 councils provided
  full responses, yet they revealed 45,157 potentially contaminated sites,
  suggesting the true figure could be far higher. While most of Wales’s
  industrial waste legacy has never been investigated, in some places its impact
  is clear to see. In Ynysddu, a village in the Sirhowy valley in south Wales,
  waste from companies was dumped in the former Ty Llwyd quarry on the mountain
  above the village in the 1960s and 70s. Residents have warned for years that
  after heavy rainfall, foul-smelling brown and foamy liquid seeps from the
  quarry and downhill into the surrounding woods, council-owned land that was
  used by children and dogwalkers until it was recently fenced off. In 2023,
  testing by Dr David Megson, an environmental chemist from Manchester
  Metropolitan University, found unsafe levels of polychlorinated biphenyls
  (PCBs) in Ynysddu. PCBs are forever chemicals that accumulate in the food
  chain and can cause liver damage and increased cancer risk in humans. All
  testing commissioned by Caerphilly county borough council to date has
  indicated zero level of PCBs, and the site is not legally defined as
  contaminated land. Megson has suggested that the council may be using tests
  that are not sensitive enough, or testing in the wrong places. Caerphilly
  council did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jane Beechy, 64,
  bought a plot of land at the bottom of the mountain in 2013, which she
  intended to use for stables. She had the land tested before she purchased it,
  and the results said it contained slightly elevated levels of chloroform –
  safe for horses, but not young children. However, over the past decade, more
  frequent and prolonged periods of wet weather have led groundwater levels in
  the quarry to rise and sometimes flood the woodland and land downhill. Since
  2018, water from the quarry has begun pooling on Beechy’s land, and she says
  that nothing will grow there any more. “It ruined my business plans. Who is
  going to keep their horses here if they don’t think it’s safe?” she said. At
  the Ynysddu allotments, soil samples tested positive for PCBs after Storm
  Dennis in 2020, when water rushed down the mountain from the quarry and the
  river flowing through the valley broke its banks, flooding parts of the
  village. “I am still growing tomatoes here, but I worry about it. Some people
  in the village grow things they want to eat in tubs,” said Mark Jones, 67.
  Despite a legal requirement to do so every five years, many councils,
  including Caerphilly, have not updated their inspection strategies for
  potentially contaminated land on average since 2014, Friends of the Earth
  Cymru found. Of Wales’s 22 local authorities, only six publish a legally
  mandated contaminated land register online, leaving communities in the dark
  about what may be lying under their feet. On Tuesday, Friends of the Earth
  Cymru called for a public inquiry into the scale and impact of contaminated
  land in Wales and for the UK and Welsh governments to provide councils with
  the resources to identify and clean up potentially dangerous sites. Its
  spokesperson Kirsty Luff said: “It’s shocking that so much land could be
  contaminated and yet isn’t being properly inspected. People in Wales deserve
  to know whether the places where they live, work, and play are free from
  pollution. “This issue must not be ignored. The longer the delay, the greater
  the risk to our health, our environment and future generations.” The Welsh
  government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The picture
  could be similar across the rest of the UK. A BBC investigation suggests that
  of 13,093 potentially toxic sites identified as high-risk in the early 2000s,
  only 1,465 have been inspected.
