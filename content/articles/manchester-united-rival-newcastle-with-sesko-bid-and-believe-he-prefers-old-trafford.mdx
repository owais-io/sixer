  Manchester United are battling with Newcastle to sign the RB Leipzig striker
  Benjamin Sesko. Newcastle had appeared to be within touching distance of a
  deal for the 22-year-old but Manchester United made a rival bid on Tuesday and
  believe the player would prefer a move to Old Trafford. Newcastle submitted a
  second offer for Sesko of £69.7m, which with add-ons could rise to almost
  £75m, after receiving encouragement that he was potentially open to a transfer
  to Tyneside. But cautious optimism at St James’ Park regarding an agreement
  was caveated by Manchester United’s interest. Manchester United’s bid is of a
  guaranteed £65.2m, rising to a possible £73.8m. They have been pursuing a
  striker all summer and missed out on targets including Viktor Gyökeres, Hugo
  Ekitiké and Liam Delap. Manchester United have spent more than £130m on Bryan
  Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha this summer and previous indications have been that
  they would need to sell at least one of Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and
  Tyrell Malacia if they were to spend big again. Newcastle were also keen on
  Ekitiké and Delap, and it would be another significant transfer blow for them
  if Sesko were to end up at Old Trafford. With Eddie Howe’s first‑choice
  centre-forward Alexander Isak having made plain his desire to leave, ideally
  for Liverpool, Newcastle are in the market for two forwards. Negotiations with
  Brentford are ongoing regarding Yoane Wissa, and Howe is also a longstanding
  admirer of Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins. Newcastle’s negotiations with Leipzig
  have been led by the director and minority owner Jamie Reuben, who has stepped
  in to assist Howe’s nephew Andy Howe with recruitment in the absence of a
  sporting director. Isak is scheduled for talks with Howe this week but chances
  of a real rapprochement look slender. After the Swede missed Newcastle’s tour
  of Singapore and South Korea citing a minor thigh problem apparently
  undetectable on scans, and took the unilateral decision to train alone at his
  former club Real Sociedad, it is hard to envisage Isak playing for the club
  again. Liverpool’s £110m bid for him was rejected last week. Howe said before
  leaving Seoul that he had known nothing of Isak’s trip to Spain and warned
  that players exhibiting “poor behaviour” would not be permitted to train with
  his first team. The Newcastle manager described the situation as “far from
  ideal”. A series of potential signings, also including João Pedro and James
  Trafford, have turned down Newcastle but Howe, who is preparing for a
  Champions League campaign, has signed the Sweden winger Anthony Elanga from
  Nottingham Forest for £55m and the goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale on loan from
  Southampton. Ramsdale’s arrival appears to have opened the door for Martin
  Dubravka to depart, with the Slovakia goalkeeper in advanced talks over a move
  to Burnley. Howe is also in the market for a right-sided centre-half and,
  should funds be released by Isak departing, Newcastle could revive a
  longstanding interest in Crystal Palace’s Marc Guéhi. With Newcastle not
  thought to be Guéhi’s first-choice destination a deal could be difficult and
  Marseille’s Argentinian centre-half Leonardo Balerdi remains high on Howe’s
  shortlist. Newcastle have made repeated attempts to recruit the defender
  Giorgio Scalvini from Atalanta but have been persistently rebuffed. Guéhi is
  understood to be willing to stay at Selhurst Park and see out his contract,
  which expires next summer. Liverpool are believed to be his preferred option,
  although they are reluctant to pay Palace’s £40m valuation. Palace rejected an
  offer worth up to £70m from Tottenham in January and are facing the
  possibility of the England international leaving on a free transfer.
