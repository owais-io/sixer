  weddings

  When Jennifer, an actor, visited a Paris wedding fair with her future husband
  as they planned their big day, she noticed a company offering something that
  seemed bizarre. A Paris startup was proposing couples sell tickets to their
  wedding to a handful of strangers via an app in order to help pay their costs.
  In return, the paying ticket-holders, who may not otherwise be invited to many
  weddings, could mingle with other guests and enjoy somebody’s happy day. “I
  thought: ‘woah, that’s quite something’, having people you don’t know at your
  wedding,” said Jennifer. “But we took the flyer, went away to think about it
  and decided why not? If we can see the profiles beforehand on the app and
  choose who to accept, it could be something quite original to do.” Jennifer,
  48, and her husband, Paulo, 50, who met on a dating app during the pandemic
  and have an 18-month-old son, will marry later this month at a country manor
  an hour east of Paris. Theirs is the first wedding to have paying guests.
  Their friends and family will number 80 adults and 15 children, some
  travelling from England, Germany and Portugal. But alongside those loved ones,
  there will be five paying strangers who have bought tickets. The
  ticket-holders will be present for the whole day, from the afternoon wedding
  ceremony and vows in the garden, to outdoor drinks on the lawn with live
  music, then a sit-down dinner in a vast dining room, with a choice of fish or
  vegetarian options – no meat because the bride is vegetarian. Then there will
  be the traditional partying on the dancefloor. The paying guests have to abide
  by the dress-code – defined on the wedding invitations as “chic and elegant” –
  and Jennifer and Paolo vetted their profiles before choosing who will attend.
  “It’s not only about the money, which is a drop on a hot stone in terms of the
  overall wedding cost,” said Jennifer, “although it will help a bit in terms of
  the cost of things like decoration and the dress. It’s also because we thought
  it could be fun and we’re extrovert and open to sharing things.” Jennifer, who
  acts on stage and TV, and Paulo, a former athlete who works in the building
  trade, also thought that the five paying strangers – one couple and three
  single men – could be a boost for their other guests. “We have a lot more
  single women friends coming to our wedding than single men, so we thought this
  could balance things out a bit,” Jennifer said. Laurène, 29, a toymaker living
  in the Paris area, and her husband, a landscape gardener, will be among the
  handful of strangers paying to attend. “I thought selling tickets to your
  wedding to strangers sounded interesting,” Laurène said. “I don’t have a big
  family so I don’t get to go to lots of weddings, it’s great to be able to
  experience a wedding and different traditions, even if it’s strangers. I’m
  keen to check out the decoration and music, and we’ll be partying on the
  dancefloor.” Katia Lekarski, who founded Invitin earlier this year to match
  wedding couples with paying guests, said six marriages so far were due to take
  part, mainly in the Paris area. “I was renting my house in south-eastern
  France to some people who were attending a wedding, and my five-year-old
  daughter asked: ‘Why aren’t we also invited to weddings?’ I thought: what if
  we could pay for tickets to a wedding and help the couple getting married in
  that way?” Lekarski’s view was that with so many apps proposing meeting up
  with strangers – from tour-guides to dating or dinners with groups of new
  people – why not add weddings into the mix. In India, the company, Join My
  Wedding, already connects foreign tourists with couples having traditional
  weddings, as a cultural experience under the line: “You haven’t been to India
  until you’ve been to an Indian wedding”. In France, the idea was for local
  people to attend a wedding as a day out and shared experience, with Invitin
  taking a commission. Lekarski, a former fashion model who previously ran an
  online platform selling and distributing interior design goods for children,
  described the project as at a very early stage and said her biggest challenge
  was finding couples and guests to take part. Couples who have shown interest
  in opening up their wedding to paid ticket-holders have been mostly between 25
  and 35, Lekarski said, but there was one much older couple preparing to renew
  their vows. Only a small number of paid guests would attend – five to 10, each
  paying an average of €100 to €150, but tickets can be higher depending on the
  venue. They would have to sign up to strict rules including dressing
  appropriately, arriving on time, drinking with moderation, and not publishing
  or sharing photos without authorisation. The wedding couple, who usually have
  so many of their own guests to talk to, aren’t obliged to meet the paying
  guests and chat to them. “A wedding has its own ecosystem where guests get
  chatting to each other of their own accord,” Lekarski said. The paying guests
  Laurène and her husband, who got married themselves a month ago at a historic
  farm building south of Paris, are taking it very seriously. “We’re going to go
  about it as if we’re real guests, we’ll dress up nicely and bring a little
  gift.” Laurène’s grandparents met at a wedding in Dijon and she thinks
  weddings are the ultimate social feelgood event. “Everyone is in a kind and
  happy mood, dressed up and celebrating love. This is not something you can do
  too often as tickets are quite expensive, but it’s a great opportunity.” The
  only thing they’re not sure about is whether they’ll be in the wedding
  pictures. “We’d love to be in the group photo, but I’m not sure how that will
  work, it is a bit bizarre after all.”
