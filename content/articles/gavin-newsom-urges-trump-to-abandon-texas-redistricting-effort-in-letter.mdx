  Texas Democrats once again stymied a Republican effort to redraw the state’s
  congressional maps at the behest of Donald Trump, and Gavin Newsom, the
  California governor, urged the president to stand down and defuse the
  redistricting arms race that has spread across the country. Enough Texas
  Democrats remained outside of the state on Monday to deny the Republican-led
  state legislature the quorum necessary to proceed with Trump’s desired
  congressional map. Dozens of Democratic state lawmakers left the state on
  Sunday, taking refuge in blue states such as Illinois and New York. They have
  spent the last week working to raise awareness and rally support for their
  efforts to block the Republican redistricting plan. The standoff has widened
  the redistricting wars, with Newsom and other Democratic state leaders
  threatening to draw retaliatory maps if Texas moves ahead with its
  redistricting scheme. In a letter to Trump on Monday, Newsom said the
  president was “playing with fire” and warned that California was prepared to
  consider new boundaries to “neutralize” any gains Republicans hope to achieve
  in Texas. “This attempt to rig congressional maps to hold onto power before a
  single vote is cast in the 2026 election is an affront to American democracy,”
  Newsom wrote. The governor said he would prefer to leave the matter of
  congressional map-making to independent commissions, not partisan legislative
  bodies and emphasized that he would “happily” stand down if other states
  abandoned their redistricting effort. But, Newsom said: “California cannot
  stand idly by as this power grab unfolds.” In a snarky, all-caps tweet meant
  to mimic Trump’s social media style, Newsom’s office summarized the letter:
  “DONALD TRUMP, IF YOU DO NOT STAND DOWN, WE WILL BE FORCED TO LEAD AN EFFORT
  TO REDRAW THE MAPS IN CA TO OFFSET THE RIGGING OF MAPS IN RED STATES. BUT IF
  THE OTHER STATES CALL OFF THEIR REDISTRICTING EFFORTS, WE WILL DO THE SAME.
  THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER!” The White House did not
  immediately respond to a request for comment. But when asked, Trump has
  defended the Texas plan, arguing that he is “entitled to five more seats”
  because he won the state’s popular vote in the 2024 presidential election. The
  argument, however, is flawed – a popular vote win does not necessarily mean a
  president’s party is awarded more congressional seats. Despite Newsom’s
  appeal, the White House is seeking to enlist other red states in the
  redistricting clash. Last week, vice-president JD Vance traveled to Indiana,
  where he met with state Republican leaders to lobby them on the effort.
  Republicans have also targeted Ohio and Missouri. At a press conference with
  several quorum-breaking Texas lawmakers, as well as California’s legislative
  leaders, Newsom outlined his plan to ask voters to override the existing
  congressional maps drawn by an independent commission and accept a new
  proposal to create five more Democratic-leaning seats. The governor expressed
  confidence that voters would approve the plan and said the state legislature
  would act in time to get the measure on the ballot this November. Kathy
  Hochul, the New York governor, and JB Pritzker, the Illinois governor, have
  also vowed to take action. At the Texas capitol in Austin, Dustin Burrows, the
  state house speaker, adjourned the session moments after opening it on Monday,
  in a fourth failed attempt since the Republican governor of Texas, Greg
  Abbott, convened a special session in large part to approve a mid-decade
  redistricting plan aimed at flipping five Democratic-held seats and securing a
  GOP house majority in the 2026 midterm elections. In brief remarks, Burrows
  said the department of public safety had deployed special agents across Texas
  to locate the absent Democrats who have civil warrants out for their arrest.
  Agents, he said, were set up outside the members’ homes, conducting
  surveillance, repeatedly knocking on their doors and calling their phones. “So
  far, no one is home,” he said, adding: “The search continues and it will not
  stop.” DPS has set a tip line for the public to report any information
  regarding the “whereabouts” of the Democratic lawmakers. But those out of
  state are beyond the reach of Texas authorities. Since Sunday, Texas
  Republicans have ratcheted up the political, legal and financial stakes for
  the Democrats who left. The Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, a far-right
  ally of the president, asked the state supreme court to vacate the seats of 13
  out-of-state Democrats. He also asked an Illinois court to enforce the Texas
  civil warrants. Abbott has separately asked the state supreme court that seeks
  to remove Gene Wu, the house Democratic leader, from office. John Cornyn, a
  Republican US senator facing a rightwing primary challenge by Paxton, has said
  the FBI agreed to assist Texas authorities locate the Democrats, though the
  agency declined to comment and it remains unclear what authority federal law
  enforcement would have, as they are not charged with federal crimes. The
  Democrats have indicated that they intend to stay away until at least the end
  of the current special session on 19 August. Speaking earlier on Monday from
  Illinois, Texas state lawmaker Mihaela Plesa said she and her Democratic
  colleagues were “more committed than ever” to stopping Trump from gaining
  Republican seats. “We don’t take our marching orders from a man who thinks
  he’s a king,” she said, adding: “We don’t back down when the stakes are high.”
  But the Texas governor has vowed to call special sessions again and again
  until enough return to the state house. “If they show back up in the state of
  Texas, they will be arrested and taken to the capitol,” Abbott said in a
  weekend interview on Fox News Sunday. Burrows claimed that the members would
  be responsible for “every gallon of gas, every mile traveled, and every hour
  of overtime” spent trying to track them down. Under legislative rules, they
  face a $500 daily fine for each absence. Burrows said the House would attempt
  to reconvene again on Tuesday.
