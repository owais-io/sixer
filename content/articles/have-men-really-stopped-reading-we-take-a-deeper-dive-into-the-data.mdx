  The demise of men reading books has, once again, been greatly exaggerated. A
  recent ABC article about Australians’ reading habits claimed “Australians,
  especially men, are reading less than ever before” and “the data showed
  females, on average, were reading more than males across all age groups”. This
  coverage was picked up by an opinion piece in the Age, with the headline
  “Young men have stopped reading books – and these are the reasons why”, which
  also said “the percentage of men who would pick up any book at all is very
  small”. So have men actually stopped reading? Has there been a decline in
  reading overall? And how do reading rates compare between males and females?
  The ABC and the Age articles were largely based on figures from the ABS Time
  Use Survey – the proportion of people, by age group, who participated in
  reading in a two-day period in 2020-21: The main thing is the little black
  lines – the “confidence interval” – a statistical measure of uncertainty that
  can be used when showing the average value of data from a survey (or other
  type of research). And what this means, which I have confirmed with the ABS,
  is that the reading rates are statistically the same for males and females
  within all generations with the exception of gen X. Equally fraught is
  claiming that reading has declined from this data as reading habits may differ
  by stage of life – perhaps people read more as they get older. The higher
  reading rates for older cohorts are likely affected by the survey methods, too
  – counting reading of a physical newspaper, but not reading of news online
  (“general internet and device use”). All of that said, we do know from other
  research that there has been a decline in reading rates, and that females do
  read more than males generally – though the difference is usually only
  somewhere about 7% to 11%. However, different surveys measure different
  things, in different ways, which makes it tricky to compare them. For example,
  the National Arts Participation Survey (Naps) measures any reading at all in
  the past 12 months and only counts reading as including “novels, poetry,
  creative nonfiction and short stories”. In this data, younger people surveyed
  had a higher reading participation rate than several of the older demographics
  – the opposite of what we see in the ABS Time Use Survey. So what can we say
  about declining reading rates? Figures on this were surprisingly hard to find,
  however, thanks to the researchers at the University of Melbourne, I can share
  figures from the Hilda survey (which to the best of my knowledge haven’t been
  published until now!). In 2012, 2016 and 2020 people were asked how frequently
  they read either books or magazines and newspapers in the past 12 months. The
  gist is that they’re reading books less frequently, and increasingly not at
  all: Splitting the data by gender shows the decline has been consistent for
  males and females surveyed, and the gap in reading rates for males and females
  is consistent with other surveys: Males are, however, more likely than females
  to be frequent readers of news and magazines: The difference in reading rates
  by formats is something we see in other data, too. In the Naps data females
  read more in every category except for graphic novels and comics: And other
  reports cite higher audiobook usage in certain demographics. Finally, on age
  groups, we can see that reading has declined across the board, but it has
  declined the least in the oldest age group: So what are we to make of all this
  sometimes seemingly contradictory data? It looks like reading statistics vary
  greatly depending on how the question is asked. Multiple surveys show that a
  significant proportion of males are still reading books, though they’re doing
  so less frequently than they used to. And it’s clear that if there is a crisis
  of declining reading rates, it is affecting men and women, boys and girls.
  Anna Burkey, the head of the reading research and advocacy group Australia
  Reads, agrees that focusing on men is something of a red herring. “The problem
  to me is the downward trend across the population,” she says. “And I think
  that when we get into conversations about [gender] we get into really
  unhelpful discussions about boy books and girl books – which don’t exist.
  “It’s about finding material that is delivered in a format that is suitable
  for that person, and are we doing that well. And if we get too hung up on the
  gender divide we get really gendered in our responses, and that’s not going to
  necessarily solve the core problems [with declining reading rates].” So, what
  can we do to increase reading rates? Burkey says there are two aspects to this
  – the personal response and the response from government. At the government
  level, Burkey says the lack of consistent, detailed and reliable data about
  reading behaviour is a real problem, and could be addressed by a
  government-led national reading strategy. “We want a national reading strategy
  where we’ve got funds to do proper annual tracking around behaviour, and to
  see if what we’re doing, all these things we’re all trying to boost reading
  rates, is working,” she says. “We need the funded national strategy and the
  campaigns that come with that, in a way like we do health advertising. This is
  a public good.” And at the personal level, Burkey wants everyone, from normal
  people to politicians and celebrities, to be talking more about reading and
  books. “It’s about taking the literature out of the book space and just say,
  what do you love at the moment? And make it as visible as we can. Read, ask
  people about reading, and try to make it visible.” • Nick Evershed is the data
