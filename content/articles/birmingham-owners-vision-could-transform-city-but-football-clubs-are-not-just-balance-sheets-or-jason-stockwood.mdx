  I grew up in a Britain coloured grey. During the 1970s, even though memories
  of the war had faded into the distance and rationing had long ended, scarcity
  still hung in the air. Clothes were handed down, treats were rare and the
  country felt smaller and more muted than the one talked about in history
  books. Geoff Dyer’s memoir, Homework, captures it perfectly, a postwar Britain
  where Airfix models seemed exciting and front rooms kept “for best” epitomised
  a place looking inwards, slightly embarrassed about its ambitions and
  potential. America existed for me in a weekly burst of Technicolor on TV. When
  Entertainment USA arrived in the 1980s it brought news of Disneyland,
  Hollywood, pizzas the size of tabletops, Pelé playing for New York Cosmos, and
  skies that seemed permanently blue. It appealed to all the appetites of a
  teenage boy in Grimsby. Later, discovering Jack Kerouac, the lure deepened –
  open roads and adventure felt a world away, but I had to get there. One
  afternoon, aged 16 in the local library, I found a book on scholarships, sent
  out 100 letters, and received 99 rejections. That one positive reply
  eventually sent me to high school as an exchange student and began a lifetime
  of transatlantic travel that continues to this day. Over the next three
  decades I crossed the ocean for work, meeting bosses, pitching to investors
  and building businesses with an American footprint. I have always admired the
  optimism, scale and willingness to take a punt that seems hard-wired into the
  US mindset. It was with that relationship in mind that I sat down to watch the
  new Birmingham City documentary on Amazon. I wanted to like it. Tom Brady is,
  without question, one of the greatest athletes of all time, disciplined,
  relentless and the embodiment of a winning mindset. I want success for
  Birmingham fans as I do for all English clubs, but there were moments that
  made me wince: the co-owner Tom Wagner giving his own team talk on the Wembley
  steps, Brady talking about “shit teams” they should have beaten, and a moment
  when Wayne Rooney mentions getting to the ground for 9am, only for Brady to
  flex that his day starts at 6am. It had the swagger of Welcome to Wrexham
  without the same charm. Winning League One after spending £15m on a single
  player in a league where many clubs’ entire budgets are a fraction of that
  feels the epitome of what Dr Pippa Grange calls “winning shallow”. City’s
  ownership is split between Birmingham Sports Holdings, which retains just over
  half the club, and Shelby Companies Limited, controlled by the US-based
  Knighthead Capital Management, which owns about 46%. Wagner, Knighthead’s
  co-founder, is the driving force, backed by significant institutional capital,
  while Brady holds a token minority stake but serves as the public face. His
  role is not governance or strategy; it is brand, visibility and ambition. Part
  of that brand has been a deliberate leaning into Birmingham’s global image
  shaped by Peaky Blinders and the fictional Shelby family. The moody visuals,
  the references to toughness and grit, the aesthetic of flat caps and hard
  stares play into a narrative of the club as an embodiment of the city’s
  “hardness”. The real Peaky Blinders were a violent street gang in the late
  19th and early 20th century, products of industrial poverty and social
  fracture. Today, that history has been polished into an exportable cultural
  commodity, a sharp suit and even sharper turn of phrase where there was once
  real hardship. The documentary reinforces this framing. It is only five
  episodes long, yet one is devoted to the Birmingham Zulu Warriors, the club’s
  notorious hooligan firm from the 1980s. I do not want to sanitise the past,
  those stories are part of the club’s and the city’s history, but centring them
  so prominently is its own calling card. It tells you which values the
  storytellers and owners want to project. There is a difference between
  acknowledging a history and building a club’s modern identity around it.
  Football clubs thrive when they reflect the whole of their community, not just
  the most marketable slice of its mythology. Knighthead’s ambitions are big, a
  multibillion-pound “Sports Quarter” with a new stadium and regeneration. That
  kind of vision could transform parts of Birmingham. But it will be telling to
  see how a profit-driven approach collides with the new independent regulator
  for English football, whose job is to protect the interests of fans and the
  long-term health of the game. In a city that declared bankruptcy in 2023, it
  is easy to see the appeal for a private equity investor spotting what it
  believes is, in the language of markets, a “distressed asset”, undervalued,
  with scope for a turnaround and significant upside if managed aggressively.
  That logic works on a spreadsheet, but football clubs are not just balance
  sheets, and I am wary when investors want to be so much a part of the story
  themselves. It is not quite Michael Knighton juggling a ball on the pitch at
  Old Trafford, but Wagner’s recent interview in the Observer, saying, “I care
  more about Birmingham than I do about anything else,” does prompt the question
  – why? I work with and admire US private equity and have seen the benefits of
  the discipline, capital and operational focus it can bring to businesses. But
  I do not believe it is a natural fit for football clubs. The model depends on
  delivering strong returns in a set timeframe and then moving the asset on.
  Football, by contrast, is both a business and a long-term civic endeavour.
  With unpredictable results, deep emotional ties and obligations to
  communities, doing best by all stakeholders will be a challenge. The best of
  America has always been about believing anything is possible, the scale of
  ambition, the optimism to keep trying, and the courage to take risks others
  would avoid. In business, those qualities can unlock extraordinary value. But
  football is not just a market to be tapped or a brand to be scaled. It is a
  living part of a community, with roots, rituals and relationships that cannot
  be accelerated to meet the expectations of investors. The challenge for
  Birmingham’s custodians is whether they can take the best of that American
  confidence and combine it with the patience and care football demands. If they
  can, they will create something that lasts. If they cannot, all the money,
  swagger and narrative in the world will not be enough. Jason Stockwood is the
  co-owner of Grimsby Town
