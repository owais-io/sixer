  Business confidence plunged this month across the UK’s services sector as
  mounting cost pressures and weak demand hit profits and undermined the outlook
  for the rest of the year. The CBI’s latest service sector poll found that a
  majority of companies were gloomy about their prospects and discounted the
  acceleration in activity that usually follows the return to work after the
  summer break. Falling sales and rising costs meant most firms were suffering a
  profit squeeze, the CBI said, leading to lower hiring and cuts to investment.
  Consumer services firms reported a negative outlook for the eighth consecutive
  month while services companies that sell to other businesses reported a
  decline in activity for the fourth consecutive month. Optimism about the
  general business situation deteriorated, though the panic induced in the
  previous quarter by Donald Trump’s initial tariffs was much reduced. A balance
  of those firms optimistic about the next quarter fell back from -43% in May to
  -29% in August. Alpesh Paleja, deputy chief economist at the business lobby
  group, said the survey still “painted a grim picture of the services sector”,
  adding that “pockets of resilience” were unable to reverse a downward trend
  going back more than a year. Services account for about three-quarters of
  economic activity in the UK and the sector acts as a bellwether for the state
  of the economy. Paleja said: “Rising employment costs continue to drive cost
  pressures higher, while subdued demand conditions are holding pricing power in
  check. The impact is being felt in lower hiring, investment and profits, with
  companies increasingly shifting focus to short-term firefighting.” The CBI
  quarterly survey comes after similar concerns were voiced by respondents to a
  monthly S&amp;P Global health check of the industry, which registered its
  biggest drop in new orders in almost three years in July. A study this week by
  the Resolution Foundation updating official unemployment figures found that
  the rate in June of 4.7% had already accelerated to 5% in August as firms
  delayed replacing staff with new recruits. The “nowcasting exercise” revealed
  the pressure on the government ahead of the autumn budget, when the chancellor
  will say she wants to increase economic growth and employment. The Bank of
  England will be torn in different directions by the data. Rising jobless
  figures will spur calls for an interest rate cut at the same time concerns
  about high inflation will encourage demands for the cost of borrowing to
  remain high. Official data on Wednesday showed manufacturers suffered a
  similar squeeze on profits after UK factory gate prices rose at their fastest
  pace in two years in June. Prices charged by firms increased 1.9% in the year
  to June, up from an annual 0.7% rise in April, the Office for National
  Statistics said. The biggest increases jumps were in the food products
  industry, textiles, clothes and leather goods.
