  You won’t be able to have a cremation because the ovens won’t be allowed to
  run on fossil fuels, and hospitals will be forced to shut for more than half
  the year because they have emitted too much CO2. Are you terrified yet? This
  is the vaguely comical and imagined world of Gina Rinehart, who wants people
  to think a George Orwell-style climate police state is just around the corner
  thanks to Australia’s decision to join more than 130 other countries in
  backing the need to get greenhouse gas emissions to net zero. The mining
  billionaire laid this all out in a column for the Herald Sun this week, as
  part of a News Corp series of bush summits her companies are sponsoring.
  Rinehart’s article was stuffed with more straw men than a Wizard of Oz
  convention where the only cosplay allowed is the Scarecrow. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email Her argument – if you can call it that – is that Australia
  should have negotiated “carve-outs” for a whole range of industries under the
  Paris climate agreement and, because it didn’t, those industries will now be
  “forced” to either down tools or go electric to be able to operate. Rinehart
  opened with a complaint that Australia had not negotiated a Paris “carve-out”
  for its defence industry emissions. But in fact, much of the reporting in the
  Paris agreement is voluntary, including emissions from warfare – and in any
  case, Australia does in fact exclude reporting of defence and security agency
  emissions in its 2030 target. “Our hospitals, again no carve-out – nurses,
  doctors, technicians forced to acquire EVs to be able to see patients. Who
  really wants this?” she went on. Perhaps the question should not be “who
  really wants this” but rather, who has ever suggested that anyone would be
  “forced” by climate policies to buy an electric vehicle? The answer is
  absolutely nobody – except, perhaps, Australia’s richest person. What else is
  going to happen in Rinehart’s alternative universe, where the imagined climate
  police are out to confiscate your tractor as soon as look at you? Here’s just
  a short list from her column. Defence manufacturers would “be forced to close
  for much of the year at least” The Royal Flying Doctor Service would not be
  able to collect any patients for eight months of the year “as we’ve exceeded
  our emissions permitted” Cancer and maternity patients would be left to fend
  for themselves because “we have to close the hospitals for nine or 10 months
  of the year” Funerals would be delayed because of something to do with
  refrigeration and “ovens” – honestly, you’ll have to work that one out for
  yourself “It’s time for truth,” wrote Rinehart, signing off with not even a
  whiff of irony. Big names Other high-profile corporates sponsoring the summits
  include Woolworths, Optus, Commonwealth Bank and Qantas. The prime minister,
  Anthony Albanese, is due to give a keynote at one in Ballarat next Friday.
  What’s really worrying farmers Rinehart also delivered a speech for the
  opening of the first summit in Broome this week, promoted by The Australian
  newspaper. “Many of our farmers and their families and farms are already
  suffering from net zero ideology,” she said. “They have more than enough to
  worry about with devastating droughts, floods, fires.” After removing their
  heads from their desks, climate scientists will point out that the risks of
  worsening droughts, floods and fires can be laid at the door of rising
  greenhouse gas emissions. Here’s one now. “Fire risk has increased due to
  climate change with increased fire season length, number of fire danger days,
  intensity and area burnt and this will also worsen with further climate
  change,” says emeritus professor Mark Howden, of the Australian National
  University. “Climate change caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases is
  unequivocally increasing temperatures across Australia’s farming lands and
  across the southern half of the nation and is driving down growing seasonal
  rainfall and water availability. “This has dragged back the productivity and
  profitability of broadacre farming by around 20% compared with what it would
  otherwise be. A huge climate-change hit already. And worse is on the way.”
  Natalie Collard is the chief executive of Farmers for Climate Action – a group
  of more than 8,400 farmers and farming community members (the clue on what
  they want is in the name). “I’m not aware of any country that is forcing
  anyone – let alone farmers – to change their combustion engines to EVs,”
  Collard pointed out. The organisation surveyed more than 700 farmers and
  people working in related industries in 2023, and 92% said they had seen
  climate-related “on-farm impacts” in the last three years. Collard said 55% of
  farmers had identified climate change as the biggest threat to the future of
  farming, with the next-highest threat being bureaucracy, and red tape coming
  in at 15%. “We know farmers are on the frontlines of climate change and they
  are hurting the most,” she said. Rinehart’s climate history There are real
  concerns from farmers and environmentalists about the roll-out of renewable
  energy, and those concerns should be listened to. But it is hard to see how
  imagined scare stories will help them negotiate the best outcomes for their
  future. Some of the organised voices railing against renewable energy and net
  zero have a history of also rejecting the risks of climate change. Their wild
  fear-mongering on net zero can be seen as the other side of the climate denial
  coin. Rinehart’s climate science-denialism is well known and long-standing. In
  a 2021 video to students of her former girls’ school she described concerns
  over climate change as “propaganda”. In 2011, she wrote she was unconvinced
  that adding CO2 to the atmosphere could cause significant warming of the
  atmosphere. Rinehart has poured millions of dollars into the Institute of
  Public Affairs – another outspoken critic of net zero that continues to
  promote fringe and contrarian views on climate change. Her sponsorship of News
  Corp’s bush summits has given her a vehicle to continue her anti-science
  crusade. Graham Readfearn is Guardian Australia’s environment and climate
  correspondent
