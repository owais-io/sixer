  The family of Bebe King, one of the three girls killed in the Southport attack
  last year, have urged ministers to reconsider their support for disclosing the
  ethnicity of serious crime suspects, saying this information is “completely
  irrelevant” and that “the propensity to commit crime happens in any ethnicity,
  nationality or race”. Bebe was six when she was murdered by 17-year-old Axel
  Rudakubana, a Welsh-born black Briton from a Christian family who had lived in
  the local area for a number of years. In the knife attack at a dance class on
  29 July 2024, he also killed Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva
  Aguiar, nine, and injured 10 others, some of whom will never fully recover
  physically from their injuries. Michael Weston King, Bebe’s grandfather, told
  the Guardian that in the aftermath of the tragedy the family were failed by
  the “despicable” actions of the far right, who “tried to make political gain
  from our tragedy”. He urged the government to reconsider following in the
  footsteps of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK party on backing disclosing the race and
  immigration status of high-profile suspects – which became official police
  guidance on Wednesday, despite criticism from anti-racism campaigners and
  women’s groups. “This apparent kowtowing to the likes of Farage and Reform,
  who surely want such a policy in place, is extremely disappointing, though
  perhaps not surprising,” Weston King said. “I not only speak for myself but
  for all of the King family when I say that the ethnicity of any perpetrator,
  or indeed their immigration status, is completely irrelevant. Mental health
  issues, and the propensity to commit crime, happens in any ethnicity,
  nationality or race. “The boy who took Bebe had been failed by various
  organisations, who were aware of his behaviour, and by the previous
  government’s lack of investment in [the official anti-extremism strategy]
  Prevent . As a result, we were also failed by this.” The home secretary,
  Yvette Cooper, welcomed new police guidelines released on Wednesday, which
  encourage forces to release the race and nationality of those charged in
  high-profile cases. The new guidelines follow a row over claims police
  “covered up” that two men charged in connection with the alleged rape of a
  child in the Warwickshire town of Nuneaton were asylum seekers. This led to a
  far-right rally in the town during an anti-immigration protest, in which
  attenders wore clothing with Nazi imagery and speakers told a crowd the “far
  right must unite”. Weston King said that in the aftermath of the attack the
  family “were failed further, by the likes of Reform and the right wing, as
  they tried to make political gain from our tragedy, only causing further
  misery to us and others, which was despicable”. The first of a number of riots
  erupted last summer at a vigil for the murdered children in Southport, after
  days of online misinformation about the suspect, including a rumour he was an
  asylum seeker with a Muslim name. In a rare move that aimed to prevent further
  riots in towns and cities across the UK, a judge publicly named the underage
  Rudakubana, who was then only a week from his 18th birthday. However, it
  failed to stop rioting in which mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers were
  attacked and, in some cases, people of colour targeted indiscriminately. It
  was only after the first prison sentences were handed down to rioters that the
  violence abated. Weston King said: “Though we are not interested in
  retribution or revenge, we were glad to see that the rioters, along with those
  who spread lies and hatred online, received prison sentences. “I very much
  hope that the mood and opinion of the nation is in keeping with ours, and that
  this plan does not go ahead.” Weston King said though he had been a Labour
  supporter all his life and was “delighted to have seen the back of the Tories
  after 14 years of misrule, it is with a heavy heart that I acknowledge some of
  Starmer’s recent decisions”, not least over Palestine.
