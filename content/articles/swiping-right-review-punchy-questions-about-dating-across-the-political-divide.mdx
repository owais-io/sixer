  Swiping Right review – punchy questions about dating across the political
  divide
sectionName: Stage

bodyText: >-
  If the Guardian’s Dining Across the Divide column were a show, it would look
  very like Swiping Right. Performed by Sophie Anna Veelenturf of the Belgian
  company Berlin, it considers how much political opinions should affect our
  social and sexual relationships. Veelenturf talks directly from experience. An
  eager participant in online dating, she wonders which potential partners she
  is filtering out – and, likewise, which of them is filtering her out – because
  of their stated political leanings. On an app such as Bumble, she identifies
  herself as being leftwing and consequently meets like-minded people. In an
  increasingly polarised society, one tribe has decreasing opportunity to talk
  to the other. Left and right do not even meet, let alone exchange views. But
  there are exceptions. At the ages of 17, 21 and 23, Veelenturf dated three
  rightwing men, who she identifies respectively as Max, Noah and Jeff. As part
  of her research for Swiping Right, which consists primarily of recorded
  conversations, she contacted these and other friends and ex-partners to see
  how big a part they thought political difference played in their
  relationships. The picture that builds up is nuanced. There are those who seek
  to convert their partner to what they regard as the obvious rightness of their
  worldview. There are others who enjoy the excitement of being with someone who
  thinks passionately and independently even when they disagree. Some have too
  little interest in politics to care; others discover you can keep a lid on
  differences only until those differences start affecting life choices, such as
  the friend’s husband whose conservative values conflicted with her
  independence. That is before you include those free thinkers who vote right on
  some issues and left on others. Veelenturf is willing to be open minded, even
  if there are some lines she will not cross. If the show is theatrically
  constrained by its reliance on recordings, it raises spiky questions about the
  tricky business of getting along. • At Zoo Southside, Edinburgh, until 24
  August • All our Edinburgh festival reviews
