  Tadej Pogačar’s victory looked certain as he flew up Butte Montmartre for the
  second of three times on the Tour de France’s final stage. His lead in the
  race’s general classification (GC) stood at four minutes and 27 seconds over
  Jonas Vingegaard, more than 10 minutes clear of everybody else, and GC times
  had been frozen for the final stage. He had won four stages already; that he
  hadn’t won at least six seemed more his choice than anybody else’s. There was
  no need to be at the front here, to add a fifth cherry atop the ice cream, but
  Pogačar’s unquenchable competitive spirit demanded an attempt. He stamped on
  his pedals on the cobblestoned hill, scything riders off the back of the
  bunch. By the time he crested Montmartre, he had just four others for company.
  Among them were the American Matteo Jorgenson and Wout van Aert, both of
  Vingegaard’s Visma Lease-a-Bike team. Thanks to superb climbing performances
  and helming the deepest team in the race, Vingegaard managed to defeat Pogačar
  at the 2022 and 2023 Tours de France – given Pogačar’s dominance since, these
  Tours now feel like distant memories from an obsolete world. Back then, Visma
  used Pogačar’s raw aggression against him. With the knowledge that he would
  respond to every acceleration, Vingegaard and his teammates threw jab after
  jab and Pogačar exhausted himself trying to counter with haymakers. Pogačar –
  already an all-time-great cyclist – responded by simply eradicating any trace
  of weakness. In the 2024 Tour and the first 20 stages of the 2025 event,
  Pogačar looked invincible. He hadn’t been dropped once. Most teams didn’t even
  think of trying to unseat him, so pointless their resistance would be. The
  peloton can resemble a living thing, a giant vibrating insect with shimmering,
  multicolored scales. For all its beauty, no part of it stood up to Pogačar.
  Vingegaard was the only rider who could feasibly compete. Given how
  comfortably Pogačar beat him in 2024, he would need even more help from his
  team than before. Jorgenson intended to provide just that. It’s baked into his
  job title, domestique, the French word for servant. If the Tour were a
  battlefield, the Idaho-bred Jorgenson would be on a suicide mission to engage
  Pogačar for as long as possible before he inevitably met his end. Any selfish
  goals he may have had were irrelevant. For the first four days of the Tour,
  Visma riders tried to surprise Pogačar with unusually timed accelerations on
  the flats, on the downhills, and into fierce sidelong wind. Jorgenson, to
  present a credible dummy target, tried to stick as close as possible to
  Pogačar in the overall standings. That way, Pogačar would be obligated to
  follow the American’s attacks as well as Vingegaard’s, leaving him potentially
  overextended. Pogačar casually fended off the Visma assault while
  simultaneously battling Mathieu van der Poel, a far heavier, more natural
  sprinter, in short dashes to the line. Van der Poel won their first duel on
  Stage 2; outsprinting him appeared a bridge too far for even Pogačar. All of
  two stages later, Pogačar exacted revenge. Vingegaard was behind in the
  sprints, but managed to stay eight seconds behind Pogacar through four stages,
  and Jorgenson 19. Visma’s plan had yet to produce the desired result, but
  hadn’t gone badly wrong either. Then on stage five’s time trial, Vingegaard
  and Jorgenson dropped more than one minute each to Pogačar, rendering all the
  efforts of the previous four days irrelevant. Stage 12’s hulking Hautacam was
  the most difficult climb yet; Pogačar chiseled two more minutes out of
  Vingegaard and 10 from Jorgenson. That was the end of any illusions that
  Jorgenson could be a general classification contender. With plan A vaporized,
  Visma tried to win individual stages. (Their Simon Yates had won stage 10, but
  it felt almost incidental.) On the queen stage of the race, Jorgenson stuck to
  the lead group, then formed a breakaway with two other riders as the rest
  jousted cagily at the foot of the unforgiving Col de la Loze. When Jorgenson
  fell back midway up the vertiginous slope, it looked like he had been
  instructed to wait for Vingegaard. Instead, Vingegaard’s group caught him and
  went past. Jorgenson was empty. Such was Pogačar’s dominance that when he
  grimaced in pain while following a Vingegaard attack on Mont Ventoux, I felt a
  genuine, if pathetic, thrill. Pogačar had shown so little mortality on the
  preceding stages that he had shifted the benchmarks for entertainment. In lieu
  of seeing him get dropped, I would accept a warped facial expression. It
  allowed a momentary dream of tighter competition before Pogačar whizzed clear
  on yet another sprint. Jorgenson’s plight seemed even direr than Vingegaard’s,
  who had seen his once-brilliant rivalry with Pogačar decimated by the latter’s
  evolution. Though he failed to land a single meaningful blow on his foe,
  Vingegaard’s efforts earned him praise. Jorgenson, meanwhile, disappeared
  silently on the slopes each day. He was emptying his reserves on stage after
  stage, seemingly to little effect for a hopeless purpose. With two stages
  left, Jorgenson admitted he had been tussling with bronchitis the previous
  week. What was this tall, sick man doing, trying to climb as fast as the
  wraiths around him? In 2023, Sepp Kuss, Visma’s most dependable domestique,
  rode his way into the red leader’s jersey at the Vuelta a España. Though he
  wasn’t the best rider on his team, it stood to reason that Visma would throw
  their weight behind him given his lead. They eventually did, helping ensure
  Kuss’ victory, but not before team leaders Vingegaard and Primoz Roglic
  initiated infighting that suggested they would rip the jersey from Kuss’ back
  if given the chance. “I had to give something up of my own ambitions to help
  them,” Kuss later said of his years as a domestique. “Whether they needed my
  help or not, I don’t know. Maybe they never did.” He laughed, but beneath the
  mirth is a frightening sentiment: the idea that those generous, painful
  sacrifices made no difference. At this year’s Tour, Jorgenson looked into a
  darker crisis – Vingegaard needed all the help he could get, and Jorgenson
  couldn’t give it. Maybe he could help someone else. With Vingegaard’s GC bid
  doomed, Visma aimed at securing a final stage win, likely with Wout van Aert,
  whose plentiful horsepower suited short, punchy climbs like Montmartre. On the
  flats ahead of the third trip up Montmartre’s jangly cobbles, Jorgenson began
  attacking the group. Pogačar followed each time, but on a slight delay. It was
  as if his legs needed a few seconds to overcome their fatigue before spurring
  into blurred motion. Though Visma’s pecking and poking throughout the Tour
  hadn’t resulted in any time profits, they had contributed to exhausting
  Pogačar. Jorgenson remained deathly loyal to that tactic. But still Pogačar
  had the energy to take the lead on the climb itself and further whittle down
  the survivors. As the top of the hill approached, van Aert suddenly thundered
  ahead of Pogačar, pushing his pedals so hard I could imagine the bike frame
  snapping beneath the strain. As van Aert sustained his violent effort all the
  way up, gradually, impossibly, Pogačar fell behind. Jorgenson had finally
  taken enough bites out of him that somebody else could draw blood, he’d shown
  that Pogačar still could bleed. Van Aert joyfully coasted across the finish
  line well ahead of the others, who, realizing the futility of chasing the
  rocket in front of them, had given up the chase. Pogačar rolled through the
  line with a finger held aloft in celebration of his fourth Tour de France
  victory. Jorgenson followed behind quietly, his agonizing, selfless job done
  and done well.
