  There are few breakfasts that feel as healthy and refreshing as the
  ever-mutable smoothie. You can make them virtuous, with lots of greens and nut
  milk, or luscious, with full-fat dairy and cocoa powder – but in order to make
  a good one, you need a really good blender. And while smoothies are the
  classic use for a blender, these appliances can do so much more; a truly great
  blender is a kitchen workhorse that can make your morning smoothie, your
  afternoon dip, your evening soup and even a frozen drink if you’re feeling
  frisky. While blender technology has definitely improved in the last few
  decades – we now have high-speed contraptions that can make peanut butter in
  less than a minute – they’re all basically attempting to turn large pieces of
  food into a smoother result. If you’re looking for a new one, we’ve tested the
  best in the business. *** At a glance Best overall: Vitamix 5200 $499.95 at

  trust me I’ve been writing about food for more than a decade, whether that’s
  creating recipes, editing cookbooks or reviewing restaurants. I’m an obsessive
  home cook with a small kitchen: I love an efficient kitchen tool and don’t
  have patience for useless bits and bobs. I’m also a habitual smoothie maker,
  meaning that I’ve made hundreds of morning drinks, as well as plenty of pesto
  and endless sauces, in my own refurbished Vitamix – and cleaned it by hand
  each time. How I tested all these blenders After spending a few weeks
  researching the wide world of blender options, I selected nine blenders to
  test: six full-sized blenders and three personal blenders. (I skipped
  immersion blenders, because comparing them to high-powered blenders felt like
  comparing a bike to a Hummer: they have different uses and vastly different
  power levels.) I tested each blender’s ability to make the following: crushed
  ice (to replicate frozen drinks), peanut butter, pesto, smoothies and a
  broccoli-potato-white bean soup. After each test, I washed the blenders by
  hand, making note of how annoying they were to wash without the luxury of a
  dishwasher. I also made note of what “extras” they came with, how they were
  packaged and what they were made of. I’m donating the blenders I tested to St
  Mary’s Clothing Drive in Brooklyn, a wonderful charity near my apartment. ***
  Best overall: Vitamix 5200 $464.99 at Amazon $499.95 at Vitamix Why we love it
  Across all my rounds of testing, the two Vitamix blenders I tested
  consistently produced the smoothest product, though this one – the 5200 – had
  the edge. Whether I was sipping a smoothie, spooning a soup or (let’s be real)
  dipping a finger into a batch of pesto, this blender produced luscious,
  vibrant results, even keeping green and purple smoothies from turning muddy in
  color. It also worked quickly, turning a chunky soup into a puree in less than
  a minute, while other competitors took 90 seconds or more to create a mulchier
  result. After a few rounds of testing, the touchscreen of the more expensive
  Ascent ($750 compared to the 5200’s $470) stopped working, and the blender was
  unusable. Even if the Ascent had kept working throughout my testing, the
  results were basically the same as those of the 5200. I also appreciated that
  the 5200 offered an array of speeds, without an excess of settings. There’s an
  on/off switch and a switch that lets you choose high speed or variable speed;
  if you choose variable, a dial at the center of the control panel lets you go
  from zero to 10 as you like. The device will also “pulse” in case you want to
  make something chunkier, such as salsa. And it comes with a tamper, to help
  break down anything super thick like peanut butter. Finally, it has a
  seven-year warranty. It’s a shame that … It’s definitely loud. At just over
  20in tall, it’s also too large to fit under some people’s cupboards. Capacity:
  64 ounces Power: 1,380 watts / 120 volts Speeds: 10 *** Best budget blender:
  Breville Fresh &amp; Furious $198.99 at Target $186 at Amazon Why we love it
  Out of the gate, I was impressed by the Breville because it was one of only
  two blenders that could crush ice without the assistance of a tamper or a
  splash of water. If you’re looking to make frozen margaritas on the cheap,
  this blender is for you. The Breville website claims that the blades offer a
  mix of blending and food processing functionality; I tried chopping some
  carrots, and it was more of a shred. Still, it’s a useful option. It also
  whipped up a bright-green pesto quickly. While it wasn’t as silky smooth as
  the Vitamix pesto, it got pretty close. The smoothie, too, had a bit more
  texture than the Vitamix smoothie, but at nearly a third of the price, it
  feels like an acceptable tradeoff. I also liked the lid design: it fits very
  tightly and securely into the jug and features a loop that helps you pull it
  off easily. It’s a shame that … Although it comes in seven different colors,
  from “red velvet cake” to “olive tapenade”, this isn’t the sleekest-looking
  blender of the bunch. And if you’re obsessive about texture, you may find that
  your smoothies and soups aren’t perfectly smooth. Capacity: 50 ounces Power:
  1,100 watts Speeds: five, plus other features such as crushed ice and pulse
  *** Best personal blender: The Beast Mega 1200 Plus $219 at Macys $219 at
  Beast Why we love it The Beast is the newest brand on this list. Their
  personal blenders have a very strong motor at 1,200 watts, and this option,
  the Mega Plus, comes with three jars, for XL smoothies, little batches of
  sauce and everything in between. The Mega Plus came with more bits and bobs
  than any other blender I tried: in addition to the jars there are a drinking
  lid, two straws, a straw cleaner and a blade cleaner. If you like gear, this
  is likely the blender for you. Of the three personal blenders I tested, the
  Beast consistently produced the best results, blending everything evenly from
  pesto to soup. While it couldn’t blend nut butter or crush ice, I’m not sure
  that there’s a personal blender on the market that can, and it was definitely
  the best for thick smoothies. I also liked the color options – I tested a dark
  blue model. It offers two speeds: “pulse” and “blend”. It’s a shame that …
  While the Beast’s jars are made of plastic – the same BPA-free material that
  the Vitamix uses – they’re so heavy I briefly thought they might be made from
  very thick glass. I recently deadlifted nearly 240lbs, but even I wouldn’t
  want to carry a smoothie this heavy to the gym. Capacity: 28.75 ounces Power:
  1,200 watts / 120 volts Speeds: two (pulse and blend) *** The best of the rest
  Best blender for smoothies on the go: Nutribullet Pro 900 $89.19 at Amazon
  $79.99 at Kohl’s If you want a personal blender that will make good smoothies
  and shakes you can take to the gym – or you balked at the Beast’s $219 price
  tag – the Nutribullet is your friend. At just $88, the Nutribullet blended
  smoothies that were only slightly more textured than those of its more
  expensive counterpart, and it handily blended soup and pesto without any
  problem. It also comes with a second jar, a lid for drinking and a
  clunky-looking but totally effective detachable handle. This jar was basically
  designed to be thrown in a gym bag. It didn’t make the final cut because … Its
  smoothies weren’t the smoothest, but they still did the trick. Capacity: 32
  ounces Power: 900 watts Speeds: one *** Best blender for the plastic-averse:
  Oster Classic Series Heritage Blender with 6-Cup Glass Jar $99.99 at Walmart
  The Oster felt decidedly nostalgic – I’m pretty sure that my parents had the
  same one in the 90s, with its flip-on switch and tapered glass jug. It’s also
  the only blender that arrived with zero plastic packaging: all cardboard, no
  useless baggies. If you’re looking for a blender that will minimize potential
  exposure to microplastics, this is a great option, thanks to its glass jug.
  The lid is still plastic, but has less contact with your food. It also offers
  a 10-year warranty – even longer than the Vitamix’s. It didn’t make the final
  cut because … Its blending capabilities left something to be desired: it
  produced a decidedly mulchy green smoothie, and it never got soup as smooth as
  its competitors. Because the base is so narrow, it’s difficult to clean by
  hand, as the area beneath the blades is a challenge to reach. Capacity: 48
  ounces Power: 1,000 power watts/600 blending watts Speeds: two What key
  features should I look out for? Choosing your blender will have a lot to do
  with how you want to use it. Do you just want to make shakes for the gym, or
  are you an obsessive home cook who has always wanted to make hummus? When it
  comes to jug blenders, the motor’s power is the factor that most contributes
  to the blender’s ability to do its job, but jug shape also comes into play. A
  more narrow, round base will blend small quantities better than a wider,
  square base. If you’re just looking for a smoothie-making machine, or you have
  very limited counter space or budget, a personal blender is likely your best
  bet, thanks to its small footprint and because the jar turns into a to-go
  vessel for your drink. Jug blenders are better for larger jobs, or thicker
  mixtures, such as thick smoothies, nut butters, spreads and soups. A
  higher-power blender is going to offer a smoother consistency and faster
  results. How do I clean my blender? Most high-speed blenders can clean
  themselves with a little help. Rinse out your blender as best you can, add a
  squeeze of dish soap and fill halfway with water. Then blend on high for a
  minute. Unless you were blending something particularly sticky, this should
  clean out your blender, and all you have to do is rinse it. You may have to
  wash the lid by hand. Personal blenders are a little different. Cleaning the
  jars is the same as cleaning a water glass. Be careful when cleaning the
  blades. I like to soak them in hot soapy water for about 20 minutes, which
  will loosen any bits of soup that have lodged in crevices. What else did you
  test? These are the blenders that I tested, in alphabetical order: The Beast
