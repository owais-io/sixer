  The cops are everywhere. This weekend, as Notting Hill carnival looms, you’ll
  see them on the streets and in the news. I’m a standup comedian, but also a
  recent ex-cop with plenty of mates still in the job to keep me apprised of
  what’s going on and what they are thinking. Usually this involves a sort of
  role reversal, where I play the part of the crisis negotiator and they’re
  weeping down the phone over the latest senior management policy. Here’s what’s
  really on their minds at the moment. Dance like no one is watching – and
  that’s an order! The spectacle of colour and splendour that is the Notting
  Hill carnival is almost upon us. But what about “Mr Little Bit Too Serious”
  Met police commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, (boo!) telling his troops they must
  not join in and that rhythm’s not a dancer on his watch? (Hiss!) Let me
  declare that I’ve never been to Notting Hill carnival. (I’ve been to the
  Barnsley Clog Dancing festival, where the winner gets a cone of chips with
  extra gravy.) But I do love community policing. Love it, love it, LOVE IT! As
  a former neighbourhood sergeant, I strongly believe that community engagement
  is the heart and soul of policing. The CDS (Counter Dance Squad) at Scotland
  Yard fears that cops may be distracted, and “less able to respond and
  intervene swiftly when required”. What a load of Bolshoi! Come on, Sir Mark,
  be honest. What you really fear is a clip of some pirouetting PC being picked
  up by the Daily Mail. Causing old Arthur in the Dog and Duck to slam down his
  pint and scream at the gen Z bartender that he used t’get a clip around the
  ear’ole from PC Dixon – and if he went home and told his father … And what do
  cops think about the dance ban? The answer is: total indifference! Most just
  resent having their weekend cancelled to swelter in heavy boots and cheap
  Lycra tops. Meanwhile, old Arthur’s now grinding his teeth, screwing up his
  flat cap and screaming: “Why aren’t they out there catching the real
  criminals?!” One answer is that many are at the Notting Hill carnival,
  community policing, but also seeking out the knife-and-gun-toting thieves,
  robbers and murderers who exploit the event. Of the 349 arrests in 2024, 72
  were for carrying knives or other offensive weapons. A recent Police
  Federation survey revealed that an astounding 89% of cops at last year’s event
  reported feeling unsafe, and I’m not surprised. For all the jollity, I think
  the carnival is potentially the most dangerous public event a police officer
  will ever face. And that’s coming from a copper who survived policing the
  Scunthorpe United v Grimsby Town, Football League trophy match of 2017.
  Grimsby lost. Those Codheads can be sore losers! Money, money, money But think
  of all the overtime, right? Wrong! The biggest gripe from my serving police
  chums is remuneration! The “national living wage” is now £12.21 per hour. A
  police officer’s starting salary is £29,907. Whichever way you look at it,
  it’s an uplift of a little more than a couple of quid for enduring a dire
  shift pattern, constant abuse and daily risk to life and limb. The Police
  Federation says that since 2010, police pay has fallen by 21% in real terms.
  Theresa May is now the chair of the Global Commission on Modern Slavery and
  Human Trafficking. Skills no doubt honed from reforming UK police pay and
  conditions. Out with the old, out with the new Recently, police chiefs were
  given powers to quickly sack those who fail vetting checks. Speedy departure
  of bad cops is a positive. However, hanging on to the good cops is proving
  challenging: 8,795 officers left in the last year, 53% being voluntary
  resignations. That’s a bit awkward for the government’s neighbourhood policing
  pledge, to deploy additional personnel to dedicated neighbourhood roles, when
  there are 1,303 fewer coppers than last year. A puzzle solved by a serving
  neighbourhood inspector who told me: “We’re bolstering neighbourhood numbers
  by using cops from crime investigation teams.” To the Home Office boffins
  currently trying to solve the mystery of the police’s dire recruitment and
  retention problems, here’s a random idea – pay them properly! In the last five
  years the number of police officers with second jobs has doubled. No wonder
  carnival cops have been throwing some shapes – they’re practising for their
  second jobs as exotic dancers. At least the Lycra comes in handy. So are we
  human, or are we dancer? Here’s another secret I can reveal: police officers
  are almost human! (Not the traffic cops obviously.) Did you see the viral clip
  of a cop getting a cameraphone shoved in his face at a recent protest? In a
  sort of reverse “no comment” interview, he remained silent, as the interviewer
  repeatedly asked for his views on the protest, inferred that his children
  would look back and judge him and suggested he should quit the police. Perhaps
  they see a scenario in which every cop resigning would result in a spontaneous
  VE Day vibe and a universal outbreak of peace and goodwill? There’d be an
  outbreak all right – but of total chaos! No one craves depoliticisation more
  than a frontline cop. Please try not to blame them for complying with and
  enforcing the law. The laws brought in by parliament, made up of people that
  you elected to represent you. So if you see a copper this weekend, spread the
  love, be friendly, give them a smile. But don’t ask them to dance! That’s all,
  I’m off for a pint with angry Arthur, to talk about how it used to be in the
  good old days … Alfie Moore is an ex-police officer, writer, standup comedian
  and radio presenter Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this
