  Guardian writers’ predicted position: 19th (NB: this is not necessarily Louise
  Taylor’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips) Last season’s
  position: 4th in the Championship Prospects Spending heavily is no guarantee
  of Premier League survival – just ask Ipswich – but promoted Sunderland appear
  to have invested pretty shrewdly – spending about £132m on their 11 signings
  to date. The all-important central midfield department contains real ability
  in the shape of the gifted Enzo Le Fée, whose loan from Roma has turned into a
  formal transfer, the Arsenal and Bayer Leverkusen old boy Granit Xhaka and the
  highly rated £30m Senegal and former Strasbourg midfielder Habib Diarra. The
  experienced left-back Reinildo played Champions League football for Atlético
  Madrid last season and the Chelsea loanee striker Marc Guiu comes highly
  recommended. Even so last season’s star, Jobe Bellingham, now at Borussia
  Dortmund, will be missed and the manager, Régis Le Bris, faces quite a
  challenge in blending so many newcomers into a cohesive unit. The left-sided
  Paraguay central defender Omar Alderete – who finalised his £10.4m move from
  Getafe on Tuesday morning – looks a smart addition, but disappointing
  pre-season results reflect a squad who possibly still barely recognise each
  other if they pass on the street. If Sunderland are not quite copying
  Nottingham Forest, who spent £142m on 21 players after being promoted in 2022,
  they would be very happy to emulate Forest and ensure Premier League survival
  before starting to thrive. Re-establishing themselves in the top tier after an
  eight-year absence will be tough but the club are certainly throwing
  everything at the challenge. Stadium of Light regulars will hope first-team
  roles are found for much-loved players of last season’s promotion including
  the striker Wilson Isidor and, above all, the talented local-born midfielder
  Chris Rigg. Harmony off the pitch and unity on it were formidably strong last
  term; can that glorious spirit be recreated at a time when a series of playoff
  winners seem set for the exit or the bench? The manager The 49-year-old Le
  Bris ended his first season on Wearside by choreographing Sunderland’s
  dramatic Wembley triumph against Sheffield United in May’s playoff final. A
  former Rennes and Laval defender, the Frenchman holds a doctorate in
  physiology and biomechanics and a diploma in the mental training of elite
  athletes. He spent a decade as a youth coach at Lorient in his native Brittany
  before taking charge of the first team in 2022, with his love of trigonometry
  underpinning a coaching philosophy that sees football as being all about
  triangles. Le Bris began learning English, almost from scratch, the same year.
  He has just signed a lucrative, long-term contract. Off-field picture
  Sunderland are owned by the 27-year-old Swiss-French businessman, and trust
  fund billionaire, Kyril Louis-Dreyfus. He has presided over a strategy of
  recruiting gifted, if raw, young players from across the world. The successful
  implementation has been masterminded by the sporting director, Kristjaan
  Speakman. The latter has been joined this summer by the former Nice and Roma
  sporting director Florent Ghisolfi, who has assumed the same role and has been
  restocking the squad. The club’s gradual gentrification continues with the
  Michelin-starred chef Tommy Banks opening a decidedly upmarket restaurant,
  Banks on the Wear, at the 49,000-capacity Stadium of Light. Star signing The
  much decorated Xhaka, the 32-year-old Switzerland captain and former Arsenal
  central midfielder, has joined for a fee that could reach £17m after a
  successful stint at Bayer Leverkusen. “I feel I’m ready to help Sunderland
  with my experience but also with quality as well,” he said. His recruitment
  constitutes quite a statement because it is a significant deviation from the
  board’s policy of acquiring promising youngsters with high resale potential.
  The intensity of Xhaka’s tempo-setting game should appeal to fans and the
  raucous Stadium of Light looks a perfect stage for his well-calibrated passing
  range and committed brand of leadership. Stepping up After scoring six goals
  (all in the Conference League) in 16 first-team appearances for Chelsea Guiu
  arrives on a season’s loan. The talk in west London is that the former
  Barcelona forward could prove as good as Cole Palmer and Sunderland fought off
  considerable opposition to borrow the 19-year-old for a season. “I see myself
  as a powerful striker who can make a big difference on and off the ball,” he
  said. “I pride myself on being a natural goalscorer. This year at Sunderland
  is a huge opportunity for me.”
