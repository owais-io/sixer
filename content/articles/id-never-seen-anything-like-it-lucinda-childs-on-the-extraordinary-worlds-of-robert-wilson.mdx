  There was a production of Bob’s in New York in 1975, A Letter for Queen
  Victoria, and some friends told me, “Oh, you should see this, it’s really
  amazing”. I was a dancer and choreographer and I had worked with the Judson
  Dance Theatre – it was all about no music, pedestrian movement, performing in
  alternative spaces, avoiding all the traditional trappings. Here was Bob,
  though, in a theatre, with a composer and lighting … it was such a
  contemporary sensibility. I’d never seen anything like it. I met Bob shortly
  thereafter at a festival, and he talked right away about working together on
  Einstein on the Beach [with composer Philip Glass]. We worked in his studio in
  lower Manhattan. Bob worked in a kind of improvisatory fashion. Day to day we
  were never sure if he was going to review what we had done or start again. You
  just would come up with something and run with it and see what happened. We
  would improvise day after day and narrow it down and see what worked. He was
  never entirely specific about what he wanted, but somehow he got exactly what
  he wanted. There was a lot of trust and he supported me in my work in such a
  strong way. It gave me a sense of freedom. The next thing we worked on was
  Patio [full title: I Was Sitting on My Patio This Guy Appeared I Thought I Was
  Hallucinating]. Right after Einstein, he gave me a 38-page script and said,
  “Tell me what you think”. And, of course, I loved it. He thought of text in
  different ways. Not necessarily the meaning or the narrative aspect, but the
  music of it, the timing and the rhythm. He just had a unique way of thinking.
  A lot of the notes that I got from Bob when he was directing were in the form
  of pictures. From Einstein I have several pages of little drawings he did for
  every single scene. He was always thinking visually. Watching him do the
  lighting for Einstein in the theatre in Avignon – to appreciate what he could
  see, the time and consideration it takes to develop exactly what he wanted –
  this is something so special and, in a way, difficult about Bob’s career. It
  all happens in three dimensions – it doesn’t translate anywhere else. There
  were a lot of difficulties getting work made in the US. Luckily, he had so
  much support in Europe. He was appreciated and given opportunities. But there
  was disappointment, and certainly some anger, because it was difficult for any
  of us in the downtown crowd in New York. The attitude was: why don’t you just
  stay downtown! But it didn’t stop him. Bob wanted to do Einstein at the Met –
  and he did. I have to mention the Watermill [a centre for alternative arts
  education in New York]. He managed to bring this wonderful place to America
  and bring these students in year after year. Every morning he would talk to
  the entire group, and he’d get round to every single student. He created this
  place that’s so special. As a friend, he offered enormous support. He never
  forgot a birthday, always sent a message. Never forgot after a performance to
  write a lovely note to thank you, and he would mean what he said. He was
  incredibly thoughtful. There was so much support, and anybody I run into says
  exactly the same thing. There must be hundreds of people with these memos and
  mementoes. It was 50 years on and off working together. From the very
  beginning, Bob said, “I think we think in the same way”. I was working in
  Hamburg with him on the production H–100 Seconds to Midnight and we all were
  assembled together, he was introducing all the actors and dancers. And when he
  got to me he said: “Lucinda and I don’t really talk very much, because we
  don’t need to. We understand each other.” And there was something very
  touching about that.
