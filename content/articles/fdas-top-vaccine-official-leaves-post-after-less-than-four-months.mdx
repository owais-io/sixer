  The top vaccine official at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Vinay
  Prasad, has left the federal agency less than four months after being
  appointed as the head of the division overseeing biological products like
  blood, vaccines, and cellular and gene therapies, a government spokesperson
  has said. Prasad, an oncologist and a professor of epidemiology, biostatistics
  and medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, had previously
  criticized the FDA. He was a fierce critic of US Covid-19 vaccine and mask
  mandates and, in the second Trump administration, he was controversially
  appointed as the director of the FDA’s center for biologics evaluation and
  research in May. “Dr Prasad did not want to be a distraction to the great work
  of the FDA in the Trump administration and has decided to return to California
  and spend more time with his family,” a spokesperson from the Department of
  Health and Human Services told Reuters in an emailed statement on Tuesday
  evening. Endpoints News first reported Prasad’s departure. The government gave
  no details about the reason for his departure but he had fierce critics on
  both sides of the political aisle and the Washington Post reported, citing
  unnamed sources, that he had been ousted amid protests by conservative voices,
  with no response from Prasad to requests for comment. His exit came after a
  number of unusual regulatory actions, including those taken recently by the
  agency on Sarepta Therapeutics’ gene therapy, Elevidys. “Unprecedentedly,
  there were multiple press leaks from the FDA, negatively impacting [the
  drug’s] credibility,” said Kostas Biliouris, BMO Capital Markets analyst.
  During Prasad’s short stint in post, the FDA limited the use of Covid-19
  vaccines and declined to approve therapies from biotech companies Replimune,
  which sought the green light for a treatment for advanced melanomas, and
  Capricor Therapeutics’ treatment for a form of muscular dystrophy. The
  regulator’s decisions under Prasad raised concerns that he was anti-patient
  choice, Jefferies analyst Roger Song said, adding that investors will see his
  departure as a positive for gene therapy and vaccine makers. Biotech stocks
  had plunged at the news of Prasad’s appointment in May. The Nasdaq
  Biotechnology Index had declined 7% then, but later recovered. Shares of
  Replimmune rose 58%, Sarepta was up 11.2% and Capricor added 21.2% in
  premarket trading on Wednesday. Prasad also held the additional role of the
  agency’s chief medical and science officer, to which he was appointed last
  month, according to STAT News. Nominating a more seasoned official to replace
  him could help the FDA rebuild its credibility, Biliouris said. • This article
  was amended on 31 July 2025. An earlier version misspelled the surname of
  Kostas Biliouris.
