  I’ve been openly gay for 20 years: to my family, my friends, my neighbours,
  even the postie. Everyone knows, except my local footy club. Why? Because I
  genuinely don’t feel comfortable coming out to my teammates in this sport. I
  can’t describe to you how much that hurts. I don’t own a rainbow flag. I am
  not a gay spokesperson. I just want to be included in the sport I love. I love
  Australian rules football with a passion. I have my whole life. At six years
  old, I started playing country footy in rural NSW. I was lucky enough to play
  on the same team as my dad. I have continued to play this great game my whole
  life. I love going to the ‘G and seeing the diversity. Two 80-year-old ladies
  in Dogs gear and a packed lunch. The Vietnamese family grabbing a pie before
  the bounce. A mother taking her daughter and son to watch her struggling Cats.
  The diversity in our game is what makes it great. You don’t need to go far to
  see other major sporting codes that would kill for the diversity at our footy
  games. But after the 2018 grand final, I couldn’t even look at a game for
  months. That night, I sat near a man who yelled the same slur Izak Rankine
  used the whole game. It really wore me down. But I love footy. And I love my
  husband. I wish those two things weren’t in conflict. But they are. Every
  week, at training and during my footy games, I hear gay jokes and comments.
  While most are intended as harmless, what it does is reconfirm a feeling
  within me (and many other gay players) that while my teammates certainly do
  not hate gay people – here in this sport, gay people are the butt of jokes
  rather than our winger or ruckman. And I guess that’s my biggest issue. I
  assume 90% of my footy team would be totally OK if I introduced my husband to
  them. But still, the game has a culture that sees gay people as jokes, not
  players. Many have tried to dismiss Rankine’s comments as off the cuff, in the
  heat of the battle – fog of war if you will. Whether Rankine meant it in the
  heat of the moment or not (I doubt he genuinely hates gay people), that word
  tells me and every gay man in the stands that we don’t belong. That’s why it
  matters. The Gold Coast coach, Damien Hardwick, said: “At what stage [do we
  ask] what can we say and can’t we say?” I won’t lecture Hardwick on what falls
  into “can say” categories or doesn’t. Those points will be made elsewhere. I
  only want to make the point that when this happens, along with the ensuing
  “debate”, it reaffirms to me exactly why I struggle to come out to my
  teammates. I feel unfortunately right to keep that part of my life to myself –
  Australian rules football is clearly not ready for openly gay players. I don’t
  know what “compelling medical submissions” against a homophobic slur means –
  but I do know there’s no medical condition called homophobia. In saying all
  this, I’m not at the front of the line advocating for a pride round or trying
  to get my beloved Pies to have rainbow stripes for one game. I haven’t
  personally advocated for my own or LGBTQ rights to be spotlighted in this
  game. Not because I don’t think it’s needed. It’s because, I just want to be
  me. I just want to be an openly gay man enjoying and playing footy. It’s that
  simple. Yet still, I can not. I want to share my love of footy with my
  husband. I want to take my husband to watch me play on the weekend. I want to
  joke about him with my footy mates. I want to hold his hand going into the
  game at the Gabba and kiss him in excitement when the Pies beat the Lions. So
  to anyone who plays footy this weekend or goes to watch it, I ask you this:
  pick a different line. We’ll never stop heckling umpires or the other team.
  These words don’t just insult, they exclude. They say we don’t belong in the
  game we love. And we do. The diversity of Australian rules football is what
  makes it the best game in the world. Let’s embrace it. Dylan Harrington plays
