  over Ukraine

  Europe looks on with growing frustration as the US-led peace efforts in
  Ukraine show little tangible progress amid continuing attacks, even as Russia
  – the aggressor – receives a warm and increasingly public embrace from China.
  Europe ministers of EU countries are meeting in Copenhagen this morning, so we
  should get the latest EU line on this. US treasury secretary Scott Bessent
  said last night that “all options are on the table” as Russia’s Vladimir Putin
  “has done the opposite of following through on what he indicated he wanted to
  do” in the weeks since his summit with US president Donald Trump. “As a matter
  of fact, he has in a despicable, despicable manner increased the bombing
  campaign,” he told Fox News. His comments indicate growing frustration within
  the US administration with the lack of progress on Ukraine. But we are yet to
  hear from the president Trump himself. Meanwhile, Russia’s Putin is
  diplomatically active in China, meeting Xi and India’s Modi for closed talks.
  On Tuesday, Putin hailed the “unprecedented level” of Russian-Chinese
  friendship to Xi, and socialised with Modi, who went above and beyond by
  posting on his social media a picture of the pair sitting in a limousine
  together and praising the Russian leader for “always insightful” conversation.
  They discussed “the peaceful resolution of the conflict in Ukraine,” Modi
  said, but it remains unlikely, if unclear, whether their way of getting to the
  outcome is anywhere near Europe’s preferred scenario. Let’s see what the day
  brings us. I will bring you all the key updates here. It’s Tuesday, 2
  September 2025, it’s Jakub Krupa here, and this is Europe Live. Good morning.
