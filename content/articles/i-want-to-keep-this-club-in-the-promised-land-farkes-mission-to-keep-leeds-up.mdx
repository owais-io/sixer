  The trampoline man. It sounds like a promising title for a novel, film or even
  a song but it is a label Daniel Farke remains desperate to avoid. To the Leeds
  head coach, the term “trampoline manager” carries no hint of glamour, let
  alone romance. Farke knows that after winning three promotions to the Premier
  League, the first two with Norwich, and enduring two immediate relegations he
  could do without his latest bounce into the big time prefacing a swift tumble
  back to the Championship. No matter that there are persuasive factors for
  those two relegations – mainly involving a severe shortage of money. Mud
  sticks. In Farke’s case, the received wisdom that he is not quite an
  elite-level tactician seems unfair, but it surely informed the slew of
  headlines last spring suggesting that his reward for leading Leeds back into
  the top flight would be the sack. Eventually Paraag Marathe, the Leeds United
  chair, declared “He’s my man” and calm was restored. But Farke will have noted
  that, when the rumours first surfaced, Marathe stayed silent for a few days,
  biding his time before ultimately quashing all speculation. It dictates that
  the German could do with hitting the road running – and ideally on Monday
  night when Everton and their Manchester City loanee Jack Grealish arrive at a
  sold-out Elland Road. “We are respectful,” Farke said as last Friday. “We know
  how difficult it will be. Everton are a good side and had a really good second
  half of last season. But our mindset is to win games and be the better side.”
  Aesthetics have always mattered to him and his faith in controlled domination
  of possession and patient build‑ups served the team well in the Championship.
  Yet Farke remains acutely aware that Russell Martin’s flawed vision of
  Southampton passing and moving their way to survival last term proved a
  cautionary tale. He has responded by embracing compromise. Three respectable
  pre‑season draws against Milan, Villarreal and Manchester United suggest that
  the decision to spend the summer creating a taller, tougher, harder‑to‑beat
  side with a new‑found aptitude for set pieces could pay dividends. “I’ve
  always been in the mindset not to do the selfish things in my career, but to
  do things when I’m convinced ‘I need to do this’,” Farke said. “I want to
  leave this club in a better place than when I arrived. I’m just focused on
  taking the next step for Leeds United. I want to keep this club in the
  promised land. It’s a club which belongs in the Premier League. The fanbase is
  second to none.” His eight summer signings stand on average just over 6ft 2in
  and only two, the 5ft 11in left‑back Gabriel Gudmundsson and midfielder Sean
  Longstaff, are under 6ft. While the 6ft 4in defensive midfielder Anton Stach
  is expected to anchor that department against Everton and the 6ft 6in
  goalkeeper Lucas Perri will start in goal, the 6ft 3in Slovenia centre-half
  Jaka Bijol is suspended after a sending off for Udinese late last season.
  “Being without Jaka is not ideal,” said Farke, who seemed rather more upbeat
  when he dismissed concerns that part of his attack is now staffed by two
  injury-prone strikers. After leaving Wolfsburg and, by coincidence, Everton
  this summer, Lukas Nmecha and Dominic Calvert-Lewin are now on the Leeds
  payroll and will compete to replace Patrick Bamford, who has been told to find
  a new club. Given that the decision to offload Bamford was all about a
  catalogue of recent injuries, the recruitment of Calvert-Lewin looks a
  high-stakes gamble. Farke demurs. “Dominic has all the skills you’d like your
  striker to have. It’s a chance for him to revive his career and reach those
  former heights when he was outstanding at Premier League level. The key for
  him is not to be over-motivated. We’ll build his fitness step by step so he
  can find rhythm and confidence in his body. If we do so, he can be outstanding
  for us. But I wouldn’t rule out another striker signing. There’s no doubt we
  need attacking reinforcements. Dominic is the first step but we need more.”
  With the impressive Tottenham loanee Manor Solomon no longer at Leeds, Farke
  is very much in the market for another winger. For the moment at least Jack
  Harrison has a chance to re-establish himself – the only problem being that,
  after spending the past two seasons on loan at Everton, he is extremely
  unpopular with his parent club’s fanbase. “Jack’s a top player,” Farke said.
  “He’s definitely won all the players and staff here back during this
  pre-season. Now he has to win the supporters back. It’s up to him.” Upstaging
  Everton’s new Jack would be a good start as Leeds aim to prove hostile hosts.
  “It’s crucial to have a good home record,” Farke said. “We made Elland Road a
  fortress last season. We know it will be more difficult now but we have great
  unity and a great bond with our supporters. We will need them this season.”
