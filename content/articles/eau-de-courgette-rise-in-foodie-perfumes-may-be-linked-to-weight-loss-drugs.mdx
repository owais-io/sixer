  A rise in the number of sweet, food-scented perfumes on the market could be
  linked to an increase in the use of weight-loss medication, according to the
  market research firm Mintel. Food-inspired fragrances, with scent profiles
  that feature vanilla, coffee and caramel and referred to in the industry as
  “gourmand” perfumes, have surged in popularity in the past three years.
  Launches of sugary-scented, dessert-themed fragrances increased by 24% last
  year alone, Mintel said. The rise in popularity is happening alongside the
  increased use of GLP-1 medications for weight loss, such as Ozempic, Wegovy
  and Mounjaro. “Fragrance brands may increasingly explore such notes to address
  GLP-1-driven appetite suppression,” said Clotilde Drapé, a global beauty
  analyst at Mintel, as consumers “strive to stay lean while enjoying decadent,
  food-inspired scents”. Mintel’s Future of Fragrance 2025 report predicts a
  further resurgence in sweet scents, tied to increased weight-loss medication
  use. “Online discussions have linked GLP-1 medications to changes in appetite
  and sensory experiences, potentially driving interest in sensory stimulation
  like fragrances,” Drapé said. Gourmand perfumes are trending heavily among
  younger consumers online. Google and TikTok searches for “gourmand fragrances”
  have shown year on year growth of +170% in the US since 2023, according to the
  New York-based consumer research firm Spate. In April the singer, songwriter
  and actor Sabrina Carpenter released the fragrance Me Espresso, the latest
  addition to her gourmand-centred perfume line. It is described as a sugary
  iced coffee in olfactory form, with notes of espresso, biscuit and whipped
  cream. The Fragrance by Sabrina scents also include Sweet Tooth, Caramel Dream
  and Cherry Baby and are all shaped like chocolate bars, adding to the
  dessert-themed experience. “Generally speaking, it’s a gen Z-inspired
  fragrance trend,” said Amanda Carr, a fragrance writer at the website We Wear
  Perfume. For younger generations, with recently acquired spending power,
  gourmand is an accessible gateway into the perfume market. “It’s like a baked
  cake or a sweet treat. It’s very easy for somebody who’s new to fragrance to
  understand it,” says Carr. “Vanilla does hang about, it’s a very heavyweight
  note. So it seems like a good value for money fragrance, and that appeals to
  gen Z as well.” The global fragrance market continues to boom, with an
  expected annual growth of 3.3% in 2025, according to the data company
  Statista. Popular trends shared on TikTok include “scent layering”, which
  involves buying multiple scented body care products, from body oil to lotions,
  to boost the longevity of the fragrance. Drapé said “mood-boosting” is the top
  reason for using fragrance in the UK, driving the popularity of sweet scents
  that are linked with indulgence.
