  The suspect in a deadly car ramming at a packed German Christmas market has
  written to victims of the rampage in letters sent to their homes with agitated
  appeals for “forgiveness”, triggering outrage from recipients. A spokesperson
  for the prosecutor’s office in the state of Saxony-Anhalt confirmed that at
  least five people injured in the attack in Magdeburg in December last year
  that killed six people, including a six-year-old child, had received
  correspondence this month from the Saudi doctor Taleb al-Abdulmohsen, who is
  in pretrial detention in Berlin. The Magdeburger Volksstimme newspaper first
  reported on the handwritten letters, including their chilling signoff with the
  formal “Mit freundlichen Grüßen” (with friendly greetings). “At first we
  couldn’t believe it,” the newspaper quoted one of the recipients as saying,
  adding that the letter had triggered horrible memories of the night of the
  attack. “We were shocked when we returned from holiday and found the letter in
  our box,” another addressee told the regional broadcaster MDR. “How can a
  murderer get the addresses of the survivors?” A counsellor treating the
  victims told MDR: “None of those affected with whom I’m in contact is
  interested in an apology.” According to local media reports, Abdulmohsen, 50,
  asked the recipients for “forgiveness” and wished for their recovery, but also
  included “confused” rants about fellow Saudi asylum seekers similar to
  complaints he had posted on social media before the car rampage. He requested
  visits or responses by letter from the victims or their representatives,
  adding that they should include in any mail to him a self-addressed stamped
  envelope. More than 300 people were hurt, some of them severely, in the car
  ramming at the festive market on a central square on 20 December. Abdulmohsen
  was arrested at the scene of the attack, in which a rented SUV ploughed at
  high speed through the crowd. Abdulmohsen, a consultant psychiatrist, is being
  held on suspicion of murder, attempted murder and grievous bodily harm. It was
  not immediately clear how he acquired the names and addresses of the victims.
  Media reports speculated that they may have been included in prosecution files
  from the investigation made available to defence lawyers. “We need to check
  whether the letters could have been held back,” said the regional MP Kerstin
  Godenrath, who is leading the state parliamentary inquiry into the attack,
  arguing that the correspondence amounted to a “retraumatising” of the victims.
  The national victims’ assistance organisation Weißer Ring criticised the
  authorities’ approach, with its managing director, Bianca Biwer, telling the
  news outlet Der Spiegel that it showed “no sympathy for the victims”. Biwer
  described the letters as a violation by arriving at their homes. “It puts the
  victims at the mercy of the perpetrator,” she said, noting that many criminal
  suspects hoped through such contact to reduce their sentences by demonstrating
  regret. Spiegel said the prosecutor’s office had been monitoring Abdulmohsen’s
  mail but that it had wanted the addressees to be able to decide for themselves
  whether to read the letters, which it said were enclosed in a separate sealed
  envelope with an advisory about its content. However, a prosecutor’s office
  spokesperson said it had since changed its policy and that if Abdulmohsen
  intended to send further correspondence “we will hold back these letters and
  inform victims (by telephone) that he has written”. If the addressees did not
  want to receive the letters, their wishes would be respected. The German
  government’s ombudsman for victims’ rights, Roland Weber, said the law should
  be changed to restrict the sharing of such contact information, telling the
  news agency DPA that the current policy “completely disregards protection of
  victims”. Abdulmohsen had in repeated online posts before the attack voiced
  strongly anti-Islam views, anger at German authorities and support for
  far-right conspiracy theory narratives on the “Islamisation” of Europe. The
  attack two months before Germany’s general election fuelled an already bitter
  debate on immigration and security with the far-right AfD party gaining in
  support.
