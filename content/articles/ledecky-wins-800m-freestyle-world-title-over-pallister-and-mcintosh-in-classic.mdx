  Katie Ledecky once again proved untouchable in her signature event, holding
  off a star-studded field to win her seventh world title in the 800m freestyle
  on Saturday in Singapore, a feat no swimmer has ever achieved in a single
  event. The 28-year-old American delivered a championship-record 8:05.62 to
  edge Australia’s Lani Pallister (8:05.98) and Canada’s Summer McIntosh
  (8:07.29) in one of the most anticipated races of the world swimming
  championships. The trio are the three fastest women in history over 800m, and
  the amply hyped final more than lived up to the billing, producing the fastest
  field ever assembled in the event. Ledecky trailed McIntosh by just 0.14
  seconds at the 700m mark but surged ahead in the closing stretch, then held
  off a furious challenge from Pallister to touch first. The lead had changed
  hands multiple times, with Pallister taking a remarkable five seconds off her
  personal best and McIntosh – the 17-year-old phenom who ended Ledecky’s
  13-year unbeaten streak earlier this year – appearing poised to complete a
  historic title sweep. With the win, Ledecky extended her perfect record in
  global 800m freestyle finals to 11 wins from 11, dating back to her breakout
  Olympic gold in 2012 at just 15 years old. It marks her 23rd career world
  title, trailing only Michael Phelps’ 26, and her 30th world championship medal
  overall. She also won gold in the 1,500m and bronze in the 400m earlier in the
  week, her 800–1,500 double once again underscoring her dominance in distance
  freestyle. “I was really happy, obviously,” Ledecky said afterward. “It’s the
  fastest I’ve ever been at a world championships. It’s been a great season, and
  coming into tonight, I knew I was going to be happy with it no matter the
  outcome. That really took the pressure off and allowed me to enjoy the race
  and appreciate the moment.” “They pushed me all the way,” she added. “That’s
  pretty incredible, three of us going under 8:10. I just kept telling myself to
  trust my legs, because I’ve gotten a bit better at kicking. Just running home
  at the end.” Ledecky also reflected on her mindset at this stage of her
  decorated career. “I don’t think I have anything to lose at this point. I’m
  just enjoying the crowd, swimming against the best in the world. Everyone in
  that heat is the next generation of swimmers coming up. Just proud to be a
  part of it.” Saturday’s showdown had been billed as a changing-of-the-guard
  moment, with McIntosh seeking to match Phelps’s record of five individual
  titles at a single world championships, a milestone no female swimmer has ever
  reached. But beating Ledecky in the 800 always loomed as the toughest
  obstacle. McIntosh entered the meet in white-hot form, having broken three
  world records in five days at the Canadian trials and posted the third-fastest
  800m time ever in June. She also handed Ledecky a rare defeat earlier this
  year at a sectional meet in Florida. “I think this is a really big learning
  lesson for me,” McIntosh said. “I went into the 800 free with full confidence
  … but I’ll try to get this out of my mind quickly and finish strong in the
  IM.” The Canadian will look to close her remarkable week with a fourth gold in
  Sunday’s 400m individual medley, where she is the prohibitive favorite.
  Pallister, who also earned bronze in the 1,500m and finished fourth in the
  400m, said the performance exceeded even her own expectations. “I knew I had a
  sub-8:10 in me,” the Australian told Nine Network. “I didn’t think I’d be 8:05
  here, but now I’m really thrilled with that.” The 22-year-old credited her
  previous races next to Ledecky for building her confidence in the distance
  events. Ledecky’s gold came on a triumphant night for the United States team,
  which has endured both illness and criticism throughout the week in Singapore.
  With Phelps and Ryan Lochte publicly questioning the team’s management amid a
  stomach bug outbreak, the Americans responded with their best day of the meet
  by winning three golds on Saturday and setting a world record in the mixed
  4x100m freestyle relay. That team – Jack Alexy, Patrick Sammon, Kate Douglass
  and Torri Huske – clocked 3:18.48, breaking Australia’s 2023 mark. Gretchen
  Walsh also claimed the women’s 50m butterfly title in 24.83, completing a
  sprint double after earlier winning the 100 fly. The United States now lead
  the medal table with eight golds heading into the final day of competition.
  But no victory resonated more than Ledecky’s, a race that reaffirmed her place
  atop the sport and reminded the world, yet again, that the queen of distance
  freestyle still reigns.
