  Right, that concludes a big day, at Coventry mostly. Thanks for reading.
  There’s more here. Here’s a roundup of the afternoon in Germany. Bundesliga
  results Bayer Leverkusen 1-2 Hoffenheim Eintracht Frankfurt 4-1 Werder Bremen
  Freiburg 1-3 Augsburg Union Berlin 2-1 Stuttgart Heidenheim 1-3 Wolfsburg Yet
  another home win – dividend forecast low – and Will Unwin was at Burnley to
  see it. Ben Bloom saw anothe home win, this time for Brentford over troubled
  Villa. Ben Fisher was at the Vitality to see Bournemouth’s home win. Transfer
  latest, as expected. A familiar look to the top division in Scotland, despite
  Hearts’ comeback. League Two makes grim reading for Cheltenham fans. League
  One table – plenty of teams in the mix here. The Championship table – Stoke
  and Middlesbrough riding high. Scottish Premiership full-time scores Celtic
  3-0 Livingston Hearts 3-3 Motherwell Kilmarnock 0-0 Dundee Standings ahead of
  Arsenal v Leeds League Two half-time scores Accrington Stanley 1-1 Grimsby
  Bristol Rovers 1-0 Cambridge Utd Cheltenham 0-1 Barnet Colchester 0-2 Barrow
  Crawley Town 0-2 Tranmere Fleetwood Town 1-1 Oldham Gillingham 1-0 Crewe
  Harrogate Town 1-2 Chesterfield Notts County 2-2 Bromley Swindon 2-1
  Shrewsbury League One full-time scores AFC Wimbledon 2-0 Barnsley Bolton 1-1
  Lincoln City Huddersfield 0-0 Stevenage Mansfield 4-1 Leyton Orient
  Northampton 2-0 Exeter Peterborough 1-1 Bradford Plymouth 1-0 Blackpool Port
  Vale 0-1 Doncaster Stockport County 2-1 Burton Albion Wycombe 2-2 Reading
  Championship full-time scores Birmingham 1-0 Oxford Utd Coventry 7-1 QPR
  Norwich 1-2 Middlesbrough Preston North End 1-0 Ipswich Sheff Utd 0-1 Millwall
  Southampton 1-2 Stoke West Brom 1-1 Portsmouth Wrexham 2-2 Sheff Wed
  Bournemouth 1-0 Wolves Burnley 2-0 Sunderland Brentford 1-0 Aston Villa Scott
  Parker lands the first win of the season and another clean sheet. Owner Alan
  Pace, baseball-capped in the crowd, looks delighted. Southampton have lost for
  the first time this season. Mark Robins’ Stoke have won their first three and
  top the Championship. Hell of a result for the Keith Andrews experiment. Villa
  with one point from two matches, grumble with disappointment. Keith is low on
  smiles, his face full of determination before he eventually beams. Dango
  Ouatarra got the goal on his home debut. Marcus Tavernier’s early goal won it,
  and a decent defensive display from Andoni Iraola’s team, aided by Toti’s red
  landed a 1-0 win. Birmingham’s unbeaten start to the season continues with a
  1-0 defeat of Oxford, 27 unbeaten at home. Paik Seung-ho got the goal. Richard
  Kone started a comeback for QPR but the ref blows up before it can happen. Big
  win for Coventry; they will remember this day of all days. QPR look in danger
  of sinking fast Bournemouth 1-0 Wolves Late goals sank Bournemouth last
  season, but this time, against 10 men, they look comfortable enough. Wolves’
  start to the season has been bad. Not West Ham bad, but bad. Oh dear,
  Sunderland. Their season in the sun may have only lasted one match. Josh
  Cullen laid on the goal for Anthony for a fine finish. Brentford 1-0 Aston
  Villa Ouatarra comes off, Rico Henry comes on, another good news story on a
  good day for Brentford. Maybe we should trust the process, as good a manager
  as Tom Frank is. Villa have struggled to find a way. And here is James
  Humphries: “Should’ve kept my big mouth shut; three-all at tynecastle (from
  hearts being three down, and all), in what I imagine will get described as a
  great game for the neutral. I, in contrast, have had my chips well and truly
  p*ssed on.” Southampton have one back – Taylor Harwood-Bellis got it against
  Stoke. Josh Sargent has also got one for Norwich against Middlesbrough. Both
  games at 1-2. In Scotland: Celtic are 3-0 up on Livi, while the kiss of death
  James Humphries worked its magic: it’s 3-3 between Hearts and Motherwell. The
  goals are flying in: Sheffield Wednesday have come back against Wrexham, and
  it’s 2-2. Such spirit for the Owls. Stoke are now 2-0 up on Southampton:
  despite 10 men. Brentford 1-0 Aston Villa Keith’s boys are hanging on, though
  it’s all Villa. Jordan Henderson has tired, and been subbed off. Feels like a
  huge 20 minutes or so for both clubs. Team news and the buildup to Arsenal v
  Leeds here, with Scott Murray. Bournemouth 1-0 Wolves Jose Sa has just kept
  Wolves in the game with a fine save from Tyler Adams. Adam Smith was the
  subject of a penalty claim for Wolves, waved away by VAR. Ryan Mason is
  showing he can be the real deal as manager – by being sent off. He demanded a
  last-man red card. He got one of his own. Still WBA 1-1 Portsmouth. Burnley
  1-0 Sunderland “We have a little delay here because the floodlights keep
  flashing, which is causing a distraction.” The game has now resumed, thanks to
  natural light, a rarity in Burnley quite a lot of the time. We want 10? 8-0 is
  the Championship record. QPR a shambles. Stoke are down to ten men, their
  forward Mubama is booked for a second yellow when diving beyond Gavin Bazunu,
  the Southampton goalkeeper. Stoke lead 1-0 still. Drew Lundgren: “It’s almost
  two weeks into the season. This is getting ridiculous. Are they going to get
  to do two back to back or something? Everyone hates league football and adores
  international breaks... Just sayin’.” There’s one in two weeks, Drew. James
  Humphries gets in touch: “Hopefully not putting the hex on it, but Super Well
  have just gone two up at Tynecastle, where I was fairly sure we were going to
  cop a hiding. Wee Tawanda Maswanhise got the second - he’s a really exciting
  player, so the highlights should be worth a watch. Up the well!” Woe for
  Norwich as Jacob Wright is dismissed for a lunge, and it looks a long way back
  from 2-0 down to Middlesbrough. Stoke and Boro back in the Premier League?
  Mark Robins, a fine manager and man – his Stoke team are winning 1-0 at
  Southampton after a goal from Lewis Baker. West Brom 1-1 Portsmouth, Colby
  Bishop equalises straight after a near-miss for the Baggies. Celtic have an
  early second-half lead: Benjamin Nygren gets it against Livingston. Another
  rousing Scott Parker half-time team talk. There is a VAR delay, but Cullen’s
  ever so slightly deflected shot counts. A push on Evanilson and he can have
  few complaints, denial of a goalscoring opportunity. And it’s Coventry 6-0
  QPR, Viktor Torp scoring it. An earlier cry for help from Jeremy Boyce: “We
  are doomed, Swindon 1 - 0 up and 5 shots on target, not even 10 minutes
  gone...” Scottish Premiership half-time scores Celtic 0-0 Livingston Hearts
  0-1 Motherwell Kilmarnock 0-0 Dundee League Two half-time scores Accrington
  Stanley 0-1 Grimsby Bristol Rovers 1-0 Cambridge Utd Cheltenham 0-0 Barnet
  Colchester 0-1 Barrow Crawley Town 0-0 Tranmere Fleetwood Town 1-1 Oldham
  Gillingham 0-0 Crewe Harrogate Town 0-1 Chesterfield Notts County 2-1 Bromley
  Swindon 1-0 Shrewsbury League One half-time scores AFC Wimbledon 1-0 Barnsley
  Bolton 0-1 Lincoln City Huddersfield 0-0 Stevenage Mansfield 2-1 Leyton Orient
  Northampton 2-0 Exeter Peterborough 0-0 Bradford Plymouth 0-0 Blackpool Port
  Vale 0-0 Doncaster Stockport County 0-1 Burton Albion Wycombe 1-2 Reading
  Championship half-time scores Birmingham 1-0 Oxford Utd Coventry 5-0 QPR
  Norwich 0-2 Middlesbrough Preston North End 1-0 Ipswich Sheff Utd 0-1 Millwall
  Southampton 0-0 Stoke West Brom 1-0 Portsmouth Wrexham 2-0. Sheff Wed
  Bournemouth 1-0 Wolves Burnley 0-0 Sunderland Brentford 1-0 Aston Villa
  Brentford 1-0 Aston Villa Ollie Watkins has gone close for Villa, where the
  set play rules OK. Up in Scotland, it’s still Celtic 0-0 Livingston. All is
  not well with King Brendan. Norwich are suddenly 2-0 down to Middlebrough in
  the Championship. Tommy Conway follows up the opener from Finn Azaz. Brentford
  1-0 Aston Villa Damsgaard has the ball in the net but Nathan Collins is
  penalised for a foul from a Kayode throw. Boos as it’s ruled out. It’s 5-0
  Coventry against QPR, the second week in a row Cov have scored five.
  Bournemouth 1-0 Wolves New Wolves £12.5m signing Jackson Tchatchoua with
  Ki-Jana (Song For) Hoever leaving the field. Frank Lampard’s Coventry are 4-0
  up on QPR on this gala day for City. Jack Rudoni got the third, Haji Wright
  the fourth. Could the former Ricoh be a Premier League ground next season?
  Will Unwin is at Burnley v Sunderland, goalless so far: “Granit Xhaka has just
  passed the ball straight to the advertising hoardings. This is what I came
  for.” Brentford 1-0 Aston Villa Kelleher is suddenly being kept busy, asked to
  save shots from Tielemans and then McGinn. Villa finding their wind at last.
  Oh, Sheffield Wednesday, losing 2-0 to Wrexham, Kieffer Moore tapping in after
  a goalkeeping error from Ethan Horvath, who has had a nightmare there. From
  those earlier kick-offs, Yara El-Shaboury was at the Valley to see embattled
  Leicester claim an important win. Brentford 1-0 Aston Villa All Brentford.
  Villa fans unhappy, just as they have been with the summer. This would be a
  huge win for Keith Andrews. In the Championship, Mikey “Jinky” Johnston, who
  almost joined Flamengo in the summer, has just scored for West Brom against
  Portsmouth. Ryan Mason, having cut the cord with West Brom, is doing great at
  the Hawthorns. Frank Lampard’s Coventry are now 2-0 up on QPR, Brendan
  Thomas-Assante on the mark. Burnley 0-0 Sunderland Lyall Thomas had the ball
  in the net for Burnley. The referee has given the foul, and VAR backs the
  referee’s call. Burnley will argue that was a 50-50 incident. Brentford 1-0
  Aston Villa That was a familiar type of Brentford goal for Ouatarra to score,
  his pace was lightning in the role that was once Bryan Mbeumo’s. More bad news
  for Villa, Kamara off, and Buendia comes on. Wrexham lead Sheffield Wednesday,
  and Kieffer Moore, recovered from injury scores. The new man scores. Thiago
  flicks on, and Ouatarra speeds on and finishes. Oh dear, Villa. In the
  Championship, Coventry, now in charge of their own stadium, are 1-0 up on QPR.
  Haji Wright got it. Preston are beating Ipswich 1-0, with Osmajic winning a
  penalty and converting himself. Burnley 0-0 Sunderland Bad news for Sunderland
  as Daniel Ballard, such a big player for them, pulls up with a groin problem.
  That’s it for him today, and he will be replaced. They had started brightly.
  Tyler Adams to Semenyo, and Tavernier’s shot is deflected in off Agbadou. The
  first goals of the afternoon go in: Ethan Wheatley scores for Northampton
  against Exeter, and Lincoln’s Freddie Draper has scored at Bolton. The
  whistles sound around the grounds…. Jeremy Boyce gets in touch: “As you say,
  the table is embryonic, but actually this afternoon’s remaining fixtures could
  see any one of three teams go top overnight. A 2 - 0 for Sunderland would be
  enough for them, and it could happen with Burnley’s impregnable defence from
  last season in tatters and Le Bris’s boys brimming with joy and confidence,
  for now. Then either Arsenal or Leeds would need a hatful to depose them. As a
  Leeds fan obviously I’m dreaming, and very glad Eze doesn’t seem to be
  featuring just yet. “Having grown up watching Shrewsbury Town, I’m mostly
  wondering whether they are actually the 91st worst team in the League, or the
  92nd. Can’t see us getting any joy at “Magic Roundabout” Swindon, so
  Cheltenham’s home fixture v low-flying Barnet may give us the answer.”
  Lunchtime scores in the Championship: Charlton 0-1 Leicester Hull 0-3
  Blackburn Swansea 1-1 Watford Report to follow from The Valley. Jamie Jackson
  was at the Etihad to see that seismic Spurs win. After that huge result, and
  ahead of this afternoon’s 3pm kick-offs, here’s the Premier League table. At
  this point, it has to be termed “embryonic”. Result: Manchester City 0-2
  Tottenham: Thomas Frank really is an excellent manager. For Bournemouth, the
  team that started at Anfield last Friday will do for Andoni Iraola. Ben Doak
  signed from Liverpool, and Amine Adli, the new Moroccan winger, are
  substitutes, as are fit again Justin Kluivert and Ryan Christie, two stars of
  last season. Just one change for Wolves at a stadium they won last season in
  February, despite being gubbed 4-0 by crisis club Manchester City. In comes
  Jhon Arias for Andre. For Burnley, in come Jacob Bruun Larsen and Lesley
  Oguchukwu, the former Chelsea player, who makes his first competitive start,
  come in for Oliver Sonne and Josh Laurent. For Sunderland, Omar Alderete comes
  in for his full Premier League debut, replacing Jenson Seelt. From Brentford’s
  Gtech: Beautiful weather in west London this afternoon, but there’s a
  suspiciously grim smell in one corner of the media room. I won’t reveal which
  Aston Villa legend is sat in close proximity to the offending region... The
  team news headline is there’s still no Yoane Wissa in the Brentford squad,
  despite him taking part in first-team training this week. The hosts look
  considerably stronger than last weekend though, with Mikkel Damsgaard back
  available, and first starts for Dango Ouattara and Jordan Henderson. Emi
  Martinez returns in goal for Villa. Brentford v Aston Villa teams Brentford:
  Kelleher, Kayode, Collins, van den Berg, Lewis-Potter, Yarmolyuk, Henderson,
  Ouattara, Damsgaard, Schade, Thiago. Subs: Valdimarsson, Hickey, Henry,
  Jensen, Carvalho, Onyeka, Milambo, Ajer, Peart-Harris. Aston Villa: Martinez,
  Cash, Torres, Mings, Digne, Onana, Kamara, McGinn, Tielemans, Rogers, Watkins.
  Subs: Bizot, Buendia, Malen, Maatsen, Bogarde, Guessand, Burrowes, Proctor,
  Rowe. Referee: Tony Harrington (Cleveland) Burnley v Sunderland teams Burnley:
  Dubravka, Walker, Esteve, Ekdal, Hartman, Bruun Larsen, Cullen, Ugochukwu,
  Hannibal, Anthony, Foster. Subs: Weiss, Worrall, Edwards, Tchaouna, Flemming,
  Ramsey, Sonne, Pires, Laurent. Sunderland Roefs, Hume, Ballard, Alderete,
  Reinildo, Xhaka, Sadiki, Diarra, Talbi, Adringra, Mayenda. Subs: Patterson,
  Neil, Guiu, Roberts, Rigg, Isidor, Seelt, Masuaku, Le Fee. Referee: Michael
  Salisbury (Lancashire) AFC Bournemouth v Wolverhampton teams Bournemouth:
  Petrovic, Smith, Diakite, Senesi, Truffert, Adams, Semenyo, Scott, Tavernier,
  Brooks, Evanilson. Subs: Dennis, Araujo, Christie, Doak, Adli, Kluivert,
  Soler, Junior Kroupi, Hill. Wolverhampton: Jose Sa, Doherty, Agbadou, Toti
  Gomes, Hoever, Arias, Joao Gomes, Wolfe, Munetsi, Larsen, Bellegarde. Subs:
  Johnstone, Hugo Bueno, Santiago Bueno, Andre Trindade, Hwang, Mosquera,
  Rodrigo Gomes, Lopez, Tchatchoua. Referee: Thomas Bramall (Sheffield) So how
  are those crisis clubs doing in the Championship? Latest scores: Charlton 0-1
  Leicester Hull 0-3 Blackburn Swansea 0-1 Watford It’s the second half at the
  Etihad where Tottenham are currently riding high. Three matches in the
  Scottish Premiership Celtic v. Livingston Hearts v. Motherwell Kilmarnock v.
  Dundee League Two 3pms Accrington Stanley v. Grimsby Bristol Rovers v.
  Cambridge Utd Cheltenham v. Barnet Colchester v. Barrow Crawley Town v.
  Tranmere Fleetwood Town v. Oldham Gillingham v. Crewe Harrogate Town v.
  Chesterfield Notts County v. Bromley Swindon v. Shrewsbury League One 3pms AFC
  Wimbledon v. Barnsley Bolton v. Lincoln City Huddersfield v. Stevenage
  Mansfield v. Leyton Orient Northampton v. Exeter Peterborough v. Bradford
  Plymouth v. Blackpool Port Vale v. Doncaster Stockport County v. Burton Albion
  Wycombe v. Reading Championship 3pms Birmingham v. Oxford Utd Coventry v. QPR
  Norwich v. Middlesbrough Preston North End v. Ipswich Sheff Utd v. Millwall
  Southampton v. Stoke West Brom v. Portsmouth Wrexham v. Sheff Wed Todays 3pm
  Premier League matches AFC Bournemouth v. Wolverhampton Brentford v. Aston
  Villa Burnley v. Sunderland The Premier League is back, and all three 3pm
  kick-offs have the look of important matches. Bournemouth looked mustard in
  attack against Liverpool, less so in defence, while Wolves were prized apart
  by nu-Manchester City. Burnley’s fabled defence was a horror story in losing
  3-0 at Tottenham while Sunderland lived the dream against West Ham. After last
  night, was that such a brilliant result? Brentford had their own nightmare
  last week in losing 3-1 at new crisis club Nottingham Forest and now face
  PSR-problematic Aston Villa, a club forced to sell to buy, and fans
  dissatisfied at the rulebook. There’s no such thing as gentle beginning in the
  Premier League. All the latest from those matches, plus news from the EFL and
  the Bundesliga.

I won’t reveal which Aston Villa legend is sat in close proximity to the offending region... The team news headline is there’s still no Yoane Wissa in the Brentford squad, despite him taking part in first-team training this week. The hosts look considerably stronger than last weekend though, with Mikkel Damsgaard back available, and first starts for Dango Ouattara and Jordan Henderson. Emi Martinez returns in goal for Villa.

Sunderland The Premier League is back, and all three 3pm kick-offs have the look of important matches. Bournemouth looked mustard in attack against Liverpool, less so in defence, while Wolves were prized apart by nu-Manchester City. Burnley’s fabled defence was a horror story in losing 3-0 at Tottenham while Sunderland lived the dream against West Ham. After last night, was that such a brilliant result? Brentford had their own nightmare last week in losing 3-1 at new crisis club Nottingham Forest and now face PSR-problematic Aston Villa, a club forced to sell to buy, and fans dissatisfied at the rulebook. There’s no such thing as gentle beginning in the Premier League. All the latest from those matches, plus news from the EFL and the Bundesliga.
