  Crystal Palace against Nottingham Forest isn’t usually a Premier League
  fixture that would have the Metropolitan police on red alert. But after a
  summer spent at each other’s throats at the court of arbitration for sport as
  well as on social media over Uefa’s decision to demote Palace from the Europa
  League to the Conference League, to Forest’s advantage, supporters of both
  clubs are preparing to come face-to-face on Sunday afternoon. “Forest aren’t
  our rivals – they’re nothing to us,” says the Palace fan Chris Waters. “But
  all of a sudden this game has a bitter edge to it.” Sanad Attia, AKA Wolfie,
  who presents the Forest Fan TV YouTube channel, says: “We’ve never really had
  any kind of issue with Palace – I was quite happy for them winning the FA Cup.
  But they have been wanting to blame everyone but themselves. And in
  particular, Forest and Evangelos Maranakis.” It remains to be seen whether the
  Greek billionaire will be at Selhurst Park. Forest were accused by the Palace
  chairman, Steve Parish, of playing a crucial role in their demotion after the
  Midlands club raised concerns to Uefa in June about Palace potentially being
  in breach of multi-club ownership rules. As usual, Marinakis is expected to
  bring his own security if he does make the trip to south London, and Palace
  insist the Forest owner is welcome in the boardroom. “I would love to be a fly
  in that boardroom on Sunday if he walks in,” says Waters. “He shouldn’t not
  turn up to watch his team, but he’s got to expect a hostile reception because
  effectively he has played a key part in taking away our right to play in a
  premier European competition. “I’m not belittling Forest, but isn’t this about
  the smaller clubs standing up against the establishment? It feels just a bit
  like a betrayal.” Forest don’t quite see things the same way. They point to
  the fact that John Textor, Palace’s American part-owner at the time, was found
  by Uefa to have “decisive influence” while also being the majority shareholder
  at the French club Lyon, who also qualified for the Europa League. Unlike
  Marinakis, Textor missed the opportunity to place his shares in a blind trust
  before the 1 March deadline and has since sold his stake to Woody Johnson.
  Earlier this month both clubs sent legal teams to Palace’s appeal at Cas in
  Lausanne. The court found against the London club’s claim they were unfairly
  treated compared to Forest and Lyon. “The most fascinating thing for me is the
  fans seem to have let Steve Parish get away with this for free,” says Attia.
  “Yes, we profited from their mistake. But I would expect any Premier League
  owner to want what’s best for their club.” The Forest manager, Nuno Espírito
  Santo, revealed this week he had mentioned that to his Palace counterpart,
  Oliver Glasner, when they spoke recently, even if he also admitted on Friday
  that his relationship with Marinakis “has changed” for the worse since their
  on-pitch altercation after May’s draw with Leicester. “The narrative that is
  being built is not the truth, we are not to blame,” Nuno told BBC Nottingham.
  “We have sympathy for the fans of Palace, extreme sympathy for their players
  and coaching staff, especially Oliver – and I told him. But please, don’t put
  Forest as the bad guy because we are not.” It is estimated they could make up
  to £20m from promotion to the Europa League, with Marinakis having answered
  his manager’s request to sign new players this week by bringing in four –
  James McAtee, Omari Hutchinson and Arnaud Kalimuendo on permanent deals for
  around £90m, and Douglas Luiz on loan from Juventus. By contrast, Glasner has
  been frustrated by Palace’s inaction in the transfer market; they have spent
  the least of any club in Europe’s top five leagues. They also agreed the sale
  of Eberechi Eze to Arsenal on the eve of the first leg of their Conference
  League playoff against Fredrikstad. Nonetheless, he appeared conciliatory
  towards Forest when asked if there will be an extra edge to the game. “Yes
  there can be,” he said. “But you know Forest didn’t make the verdict – it was
  made by Uefa and then Cas. I still think it’s unfair because it’s against the
  justice we are living in, in the world we are living in. This has nothing to
  do with Nottingham. They’re very ambitious, and when you’re seventh [last
  season] and adding all these players, this is what we have to face.” That’s
  unlikely to calm things down in the stands, however. Against Fredrikstad in
  the Conference League on Thursday night, the Palace supporters’ group the
  Holmesdale Fanatics introduced a new line to round off their favourite current
  song that describes Marinakis as a “fat greedy bastard” and also takes aim at
  Uefa and Textor. At Forest’s victory over Brentford last weekend, a new chant
  also referring to their owner’s summer battle with Spurs to keep Morgan
  Gibbs-White rang around the City Ground. “Marinakis, he hates the Tottenham,
  he hates the Palace, Forest are magic …” “We disagree on a lot of things, but
  one thing we’re unanimous on is what Maranakis has done for this club,” says
  Attia. “He promised us when we got promoted, ‘We’re here to rewrite the proud
  history that Forest have had.’ And he’s proving to be a man of his word.” To
  add more spice to Sunday’s match, Palace have gone nine matches without a win
  against Forest in all competitions, a run that stretches back to 2011.
  Whatever the result, Waters expects the bitterness to linger. “Palace fans
  don’t forget things like this,” he says. “Obviously, we’ll be looking out
  keenly for their European results. It’s just a shame that it’s just come to
  this – football should be kept out of the courtrooms, but two clubs have been
  dragged into it and quite at the behest of one of them. We suffered as a
  consequence and that hurts.”
