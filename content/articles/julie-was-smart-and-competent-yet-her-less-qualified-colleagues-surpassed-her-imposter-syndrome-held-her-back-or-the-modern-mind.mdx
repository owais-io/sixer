  “I wish I could carry myself with the confidence of a politician. Especially a
  male one. They’re always so confident. Never rattled, completely immune to
  others’ opinions.” Julie’s* intelligence and quick wit seemed to belie the
  very reason for attending therapy – despite reams of qualifications and years
  of professional experience, she felt dissatisfied with her work achievements.
  Having never put herself forth for a promotion, Julie had spent the better
  part of two decades being surpassed in position and remuneration by younger,
  less qualified (and mostly male) colleagues. Deflated and discouraged, Julie’s
  avoidance of career advancement only sought to reinforce negative self-beliefs
  about her intelligence and competence. “I know I could do a higher role.
  Sometimes, I think I could do it with my eyes closed. But what if I can’t, and
  then I’m found out to be a fake?” Julie was exhibiting hallmark
  characteristics of impostor syndrome. This phenomenon is defined by consistent
  doubt of one’s own accomplishments, feeling undeserving of success or
  achievement, and fear of being exposed as a fraud, despite evidence to the
  contrary. While not a clinical diagnosis, this “therapy speak” term is now
  very much entrenched in everyday language. I empathised with Julie’s position.
  As a psychology student and trainee therapist, I also experienced feelings of
  imposition. Competitive selection criteria and demanding training requirements
  make psychology studies an ideal breeding ground for impostor syndrome.
  Convinced that my admission to postgraduate training had been a clerical
  error, I’d spent a long summer fretting that I would be found to be a “phoney”
  on the first day of semester. First identified and investigated in the 1970s,
  research into impostor syndrome focused on the self-doubt commonly experienced
  by high-achieving professional women. Men were observed to experience less
  impostor syndrome than women, even in instances where they had less
  professional experience or objectively inferior qualifications. Like many
  pseudo-diagnostic terms, concept creep means that “impostor syndrome” is now
  used beyond its original definition. Psychological discomfort in a work or
  social setting is not necessarily impostor syndrome; most people feel nervous
  in situations such as starting a new job, going on a first date, speaking in
  public, or attending a social event where they are expecting to know few other
  guests. Rather, impostor syndrome is defined by thoughts and feelings about
  one’s intellectual parity and deservedness of success or achievement. The
  comparison to an individual or group of people must also be unfair or
  unrealistic. An amateur footballer is not expected to play at the same level
  as a professional; feelings of inferiority or envy that arise from this
  comparison are a reflection of reality, rather than indicative of impostor
  syndrome. Overcoming impostor syndrome Understandably, we often seek to push
  away or suppress psychological discomfort or distress associated with impostor
  syndrome. Many people convinced they are impostors seek consolation from
  others about their skills or the unfairness of a situation (such as a
  colleague being promoted). This provides temporary reassurance but does little
  to ameliorate the underlying causes of impostor syndrome. As impostor syndrome
  is not a clinical diagnosis, no recognised or standardised treatment exists.
  Instead, therapeutic work can focus on specific aspects of impostor syndrome,
  such as self-esteem, identity and anxiety. Assertiveness training can also be
  helpful. Exploring these underpinning characteristics can be effective in
  shifting mindset and behaviour around deservedness. For Julie, valuable
  insight was gained by viewing impostor syndrome as a defence mechanism: in
  never seeking a promotion, Julie never risked rejection, thus defending
  herself against disappointment or failure. Understanding the origins of
  Julie’s impostor syndrome was an important step, but a practical element was
  also needed. Together, we devised a whimsical approach. Rather than “fake it
  until you make it”, we termed the approach “making it, not faking it”. In
  moments of self-doubt, Julie adopted the internal voice of a well-known male
  politician. How would he answer questions about qualifications and work
  experience? What would he say in a job interview or meeting with colleagues?
  What would be the tone of his voice, the cadence of his speech? This
  challenged Julie’s thinking and temporarily quelled thoughts of being an
  impostor. Julie’s personality and temperament would never transform into that
  of the politician being channelled, nor would we wish her to become someone or
  something she is not. But gaining a glimpse into that alternate persona
  allowed Julie to stop apologising for her success – and move towards
  celebrating it. * Julie is a fictitious amalgam to exemplify similar cases •
