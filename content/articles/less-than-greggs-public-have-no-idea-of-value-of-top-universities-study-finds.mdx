  Manchester United and Greggs’ famous sausage rolls are no match for the
  financial firepower of Britain’s leading universities, despite many members of
  the public thinking otherwise, according to research. The study by King’s
  College London’s policy institute revealed that many people have a string of
  misperceptions about the higher education sector, ranging from its size to the
  lucrative career boost it gives to graduates. KCL’s survey of 2,000 people
  found that many picked Greggs and Manchester United as bigger earners than the
  likes of the University of Oxford, when the balance sheets show that Oxford
  takes in over £1bn more than Greggs – despite selling approximately 140m fewer
  sausage rolls – each year. Asked to rank a list of organisations by annual
  revenue, Manchester United and Manchester City football clubs were the most
  popular choices, followed by Greggs and the owners of the Daily Mail, while
  only 6% correctly identified Oxford as the highest earner on the list. Asked
  to rank the UK’s exports by sector, a third of those surveyed named aircraft
  manufacturing and telecoms as the highest earners, despite higher education
  earning billions more from overseas sources. Prof Bobby Duffy, the director of
  KCL’s policy institute, said: “These surveys of misperceptions are not meant
  to be general knowledge quizzes – we don’t expect the public to have a
  detailed understanding of the university sector, they have many more directly
  important things to focus on. “Instead what they do is send signals about how
  we really feel about an issue, which will be based on what we hear from the
  media, social media, politicians and our general conversations with friends
  and family.” The misperceptions extended into areas such as graduates’
  attitudes and pay, with more than a quarter of those surveyed convinced that
  graduates earn the same or even less than those without a degree, when the
  evidence shows additional lifetime earnings for graduates running into
  hundreds of thousands of pounds. Duffy said the results showed that the public
  is being influenced by “negative rhetoric” about university education and its
  costs, even if most parents remained positive about their children going into
  higher education. “The standout finding for me is the huge overestimation of
  the sense of regret about going to university among graduates: only 8% of
  graduates say they wouldn’t go if they could choose again, but the average
  public guess is 40%,” Duffy said. “This will be driven by vivid, individual
  stories of graduate regret and the generally negative background noise about
  the declining value of a degree.” Duffy said the survey also showed that many
  “hugely overestimate the proportion of overseas students who claim asylum once
  they are here, because of the vivid stories of boat crossings that dominate
  headlines.” One in six surveyed guessed that most international students
  “remained in the UK to seek asylum or for other humanitarian reasons” after
  graduation, when in reality just 0.5% did so. The results “illustrate the
  challenge of shifting these misperceptions and getting this more positive
  message across. It’s extremely difficult to first get public attention, and
  then cut through the noise of individual negative stories that are much more
  likely to stick in our minds,” Duffy said. However many graduates also
  struggle to grasp the intricacies of the UK’s student loan system. Half of
  graduates aged 35 and under falsely believed that those who fall behind on
  their repayments can have their belongings repossessed by the Student Loans
  Company, compared with just 27% of the general public. UK higher education
  facts University of Oxford’s annual revenue in 2022-23 was more than £2.9bn,
  far above Greggs bakery chain’s revenue of £1.8bn. University of Manchester
  had annual revenues close to the combined incomes of Manchester City and
  Manchester United football clubs: £1.35bn compared with £718m and £649m
  respectively. UK higher education employed 550,000 people in 2022-23, more
  than the Tesco (330,000) and Sainsbury’s (148,000) supermarket chains added
  together. Higher education generated £24bn in export earnings for the UK in
  2022-23, far above aircraft manufacturing with £12bn, legal services with
  £9.5bn and telecoms with £8.8bn. Of the public 68% have a positive attitude
  towards universities, while 13% have a negative view. Among respondents, 67%
  agree that “UK universities are amongst the best in the world” while only 8%
  disagree. Source: King’s College London policy institute
