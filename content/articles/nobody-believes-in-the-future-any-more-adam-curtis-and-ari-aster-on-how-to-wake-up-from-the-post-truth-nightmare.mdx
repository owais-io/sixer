  Ari Aster’s new movie, Eddington, pits Joaquin Phoenix against Pedro Pascal as
  men with conflicting takes on how to get their small town through the crisis
  of Covid. It’s also a film about the contemporary political crisis in the US
  and the influence of technology on our lives. Adam Curtis’s latest documentary
  series, Shifty, covers similar themes but through the lens of British life in
  the Thatcher years of the late 1970s to early 1990s. This era, he argues, put
  in place a substantial shift in power away from the individual and the nation
  state, changes that are still playing out today. Earlier this summer, the two
  men met in London to discuss the thinking behind their work, the questions
  that animate them and the corroding power of nostalgia. Ari Aster: My family
  lives in New Mexico and I grew up there; it’s where I spent my adolescence. In
  2020 a Covid scare brought me back home and I was in a situation where a lot
  of the people closest to me were in totally different algorithms. We couldn’t
  reach each other. In early June, when the fever reached its highest pitch, I
  started writing down what I perceived to be in the air. I didn’t know whether
  things were about to explode and boil over, or if we would ever come out of
  lockdown, but I could tell that something was happening. I’ve also always
  wanted to make a film about New Mexico. And so it kind of became a western.
  Adam Curtis: A thing I really like about the film is the sense that, up to
  that point, there was somehow a daddy in the room. Then, when Covid happens,
  Daddy leaves and all these groups are on their own. All the last vestiges of
  power, or big power, just disappeared. They can no longer see what they have
  in common. AA: They’re all connected in that they all care about the world,
  and they all know that something is wrong. But that’s where the connection
  ends. I wanted them all to be distinguished by a yearning for the America they
  believe in, but they’re not living on the same plane. AC: That’s the point
  where you start from: Daddy’s gone, they’re all on their own, they all have a
  dream of America, but they’re like billiard balls: they keep on hitting each
  other. And each time they hit each other they amplify each other’s version of
  reality and it just gets crazy. AA: Yeah, they’re all paranoid. And as those
  billiard balls start knocking into each other, I wanted the film itself to
  also become gripped by that paranoia. I was trying to take a capacious,
  objective stance in the beginning, and then that objectivity kind of falls
  away. I don’t know if the film is apolitical or if it’s omnipolitical, but all
  those fantasies of what is happening start to take over the film. That’s the
  idea. AC: If you have a world in which everyone is encouraged to be a total
  individualist, they tend to get trapped in that mindset. It’s wonderful when
  things are going well, because you, your own desires and thoughts are the
  centre of the world. But the moment things go wrong, you retreat into
  yourself. And the only thing you can trust is your own ideas. You come to
  believe in them intensely, because that’s the only thing that makes you feel
  safe. And I think that’s where we are now. In Shifty, I was tracing the roots
  of that in Britain and I was trying to do it sympathetically. And Ari, I don’t
  think that in Eddington you apply the normal righteous disapproval of so many
  films today, either. You actually take the characters on their own terms. You
  might not sympathise, but you get an understanding of why people have
  retreated into their own world and will not accept any other reality. I think
  you’re dealing with what comes next. AA: They’re all unmoored, but they’re
  clinging to some buoy. Shifty really excited me because it felt like a mirror
  from the past. It was shocking to see how all these things that feel
  unprecedented right now are actually the current reverberation of something
  that started a long time ago. It’s just that the technology has changed, and
  because these things have been getting amplified for so long, the distortions
  have become more intense. AC: The most difficult thing to do, especially in
  our time, is make the recent past unfamiliar. It’s almost impossible. And
  that’s the task I set myself. It’s a bit like the Mona Lisa. If you point it
  out to someone, they don’t see it. They go: “Oh yeah, that’s the Mona Lisa.”
  They don’t look at it at all. What you want to do is find a way of breaking
  that. It’s how you edit the stuff a lot of you have lived through together, to
  make you look at it fresh. If you just live in a world of continuous
  fragmentation, the past never has a moment to settle down. In previous eras,
  you would have all those fragments of experience, but over 20 or 30 years,
  which is the length of time I was dealing with, most of those fragments would
  just disappear, leaving a few to settle down, out of which would come an
  agreed narrative about history. Instead, today we live in a world where those
  fragments are continually played back to us, as you show in the movie. I think
  that’s why people find it very difficult to understand how trapped they’ve
  become in their own world, because they have no story that explains how they
  got there. What you get is a continuous political narrative which says:
  politicians rise up, they prove to be shit, and they fall. That’s all we’re
  told these days. AA: Eddington is a movie about the environment. It’s not a
  movie that says: “This is the way to think, this is the way to feel, this is
  what’s happening.” Because what has happened is that we have become totally
  atomised and cannot reach each other. And as long as that persists – which a
  lot of people have a lot invested in – nothing can change. Hopefully by being
  a little bit more egalitarian in the way I’m assessing the landscape with as
  much objectivity as I can muster, I can reach some people that have been
  totally alienated by my side of the culture. AC: A good political film makes
  people reflect on themselves. The problem is that over the past 30 or 40
  years, the movies that call themselves political have actually been the very
  opposite. They groom their audiences by saying to them: “You are right to
  think and believe the way you do.” In that way, they encourage people to
  wallow in their self-righteousness and so block any self-reflection. Which
  means that so many “radical movies” are actually reactionary. There is no way
  forward unless people actually reflect on the limitations of their own
  self-righteousness and the possible dangers it has for society. That includes
  well-meaning liberals as much as it includes extreme rightwingers or tech-bro
  conspiracy theorists: it stops them realising that everyone might be part of a
  new system of power which works through increasing fragmentation and
  increasingly shrill self-righteousness. And I think it should be a badge of
  pride if you, Ari Aster, get that self-righteousness to squawk at you with
  Eddington. It’ll prove that you’ve done it right. AA: There’s a feedback loop
  of nostalgia. Not just nostalgia and trauma. We’re always looking back into
  the past to see why we are here right now. “Oh, it’s because this happened to
  me.” As opposed to – and this is what you’ve been talking about for ever –
  where is the new idea? Where is our vision of the future? Because nobody
  believes in the future any more. I don’t believe in the future, and I’m
  desperately looking for it. AC: You’re right about trauma. Increasingly over
  the last four or five years, people have retreated into themselves and are
  blaming their own past. They’re not only playing back the music or films of
  the past, they’re playing back their own past and finding in those fragments
  of their memory the reasons why they are feeling bad, anxious, uncertain,
  afraid and lonely – and it’s given the term trauma. Trauma is a very specific,
  real and frightening for those who experience it. But recently it’s been
  widened to such an extent that you are blaming yourself all the time through
  your own reworking of the past. Rather like AI goes back and reworks the past
  and plays it back to you. Now you’re doing that to yourself. AA: All the
  characters in Eddington are living in different movies. The film is a western,
  right? But Joe [Joaquin Phoenix’s character, the sheriff of Eddington] would
  have seen all the westerns. That’s a huge part of his identity and what
  informs everything he does, including having become a sheriff in the first
  place. The way he walks is informed by the way John Wayne walks. He’s a
  50-year-old man, so the action movies of the 80s and 90s would have been
  important to him. And then at the end of the movie, he gets to live in his own
  action movie. He’s shooting at phantoms. But that applies to every character
  in this film. The one thing that is definitely happening in Eddington is that
  a hyperscale datacentre is being built. And really, all of the stories in
  Eddington are just data, from one perspective. AC: Don’t give it away! AA: OK,
  sorry. Yes, I won’t give it away. But you’re right. There are other things
  outside they don’t see. AC: The most important thing that political
  film-making should do now is make us aware that there’s something else beyond
  – including beyond the internet. Everything now in movies really comes through
  the internet. But we know, logically, that the internet is not everything.
  There is something else there, but no one’s telling us about it. What I really
  like about Eddington is at the end you say there is something else outside.
  Something beyond the thin crust of hysteria and fear that keeps all of us
  trapped in bubbles today. People only search for conspiracy theories these
  days because no one else is giving them any stories. You know: those in power
  just want to manage you. And, quite frankly, managers never tell stories. They
  keep you there by repeating and repeating. So that’s why people don’t trust
  them and the most important thing to do is to acknowledge that. That’s why I
  call my series Shifty. That actually, nothing is certain and the only way you
  can deal with that as a journalist is by acknowledging it and trying to
  explain why the world feels like that today. The organisation I work for – the
  BBC – has created BBC Verify to try to reassert certainty. It is important
  because rationality is still the only thing we have to manage the complexity
  of the world. But on its own terms it’s not enough, because the universe is
  not exclusively rational. It’s also full of all kinds of strange swirling
  waves of feeling and ghosts and myths that are often completely unreal. A
  confident system of power takes all those mad psychodramas and creates a
  dominant story out of them. But when that goes – as has happened today – they
  run out of control sweeping through societies, creating uncertainty and
  suspicion. What journalism and films should be trying to do today is to
  explain how that has happened – to acknowledge that uncertainty is the realism
  of our time because that is how people experience the world today. If you
  don’t do that, the people in their bubbles will be very suspicious of you.
  Because they know that we the journalists and the politicians and all the
  experts suffer from that same uncertainty. And we know that they know that.
  And that becomes toxic. AA: Certainty has gone for ever now. With the advent
  of deepfake and AI-generated imagery, belief in what we’re seeing and hearing
  is now forever gone. AC: Which means that the most radical thing to do is to
  say the only way we’re going to move forward is by bypassing all those things,
  movies, most popular culture, as evidence of the future. It’s a lovely
  nostalgic world you can go and play in. But actually, real politics, real
  moving forward, it’s going to come somewhere else, where the complexity of
  reality might be repossessed in a really fundamental way. I’ve got no idea
  what it is, but it ain’t going to come through movies or me making pretentious
  television programmes. It’s just not. • Eddington is released in the UK on 22
  August
