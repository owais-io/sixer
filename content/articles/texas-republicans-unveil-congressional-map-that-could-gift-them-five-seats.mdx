  Republicans have unveiled a new congressional map in Texas that would allow
  the party to pick up as many as five additional congressional seats, an
  aggressive maneuver that has already met decisive outcry from Democrats and
  comes as the GOP tries to stave off losses in next year’s midterm elections.
  Republicans already hold 25 of Texas’s 38 congressional seats. But at the
  urging of Donald Trump, Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, called a special
  session this month to redraw the state’s congressional districts. After
  contentious hearings across the state, Republicans unveiled their proposed map
  on Wednesday. “We expected them to be greedy,” said Sam Gostomski, executive
  director of the Texas Democratic party. “The bottom line is, they are going to
  turn Texas into almost certainly the most gerrymandered state in the country.”
  Had the map been in place for the 2024 election, Trump would have carried 30
  of the districts, while Kamala Harris would have carried just eight, according
  to data from Dave’s redistricting app, an online tool that allows for analysis
  of voting districts. On first glance at the maps, “it was more packing and
  more trying to divide people,” said state representative Barbara
  Gervin-Hawkins, a Democrat from San Antonio and a member of the Texas house’s
  redistricting committee. “We’re trying to digest it and look at it and look at
  the numbers and see how it all plays out.” Republican legislators held three
  hearings to hear from voters about redistricting. But the proposed maps were
  not presented at the meetings, rendering the legally required hearings into a
  pro forma exercise. “How do people even know what to comment on if the maps
  aren’t published?” she said. “I call it a sneak attack to put the maps out
  after the hearing.” The map unveiled on Wednesday represents the most
  aggressive effort for Republicans. While analysts said Republicans could
  target three Democratic seats easily, trying to claim more risked spreading
  GOP voters too thin. One of the proposed changes in the maps would consolidate
  two Democratic seats in Austin, currently held by representatives Greg Casar
  and Lloyd Doggett. Other changes include shifting boundaries of districts in
  south Texas, where Republicans have made inroads among Hispanic voters.
  “Merging the 35th and the 37th districts is illegal voter suppression of Black
  and Latino Central Texans,” Casar said in a statement. “If Trump is allowed to
  rip the Voting Rights Act to shreds here in Central Texas, his ploy will
  spread like wildfire across the country. Everyone who cares about our
  democracy must mobilize against this illegal map.” The map also radically
  redraws district lines in Houston, eliminating one majority people of color
  seat held by Democrats. “The map is extreme invidious discrimination and
  accomplishes what the President has demanded of the governor and more,” said
  Al Green, a member of the US Congress. “The DoJ demanded that the race card be
  played, and the governor dealt the people of Texas a racist hand.” Green
  pledged to run for re-election, despite the changes in district boundaries.
  Democrats narrowly won two seats in south Texas where a majority of voters
  also chose Trump. The redistricting widens the margin a Republican
  congressional candidate might expect to win, given the 2024 result. Democrats
  have already denounced the Republican efforts as a naked partisan power grab
  and have contemplated redrawing maps in states where they hold the power to do
  so. A Super Pac supporting House Democrats has pledged to donate upwards of
  $20m to target Republicans. The redistricting process in states typically
  occurs at the start of each new decade, when new census data is available.
  “This proposed map is a racially discriminatory, brazen power grab. It is an
  insult to all Texans, who have demonstrated overwhelming, bipartisan
  opposition to President Trump’s order to draw a mid-decade gerrymander. Texans
  deserve better than this, and if the legislature and the governor follow
  through with enacting this egregious gerrymander, it will face fierce legal
  challenges,” said Marina Jenkins, executive director of the National
  Redistricting Foundation, which has opposed the Texas effort. Democrats have
  few options to fight the redistricting. While a court challenge will be filed
  almost immediately, federal judges in the conservative fifth judicial circuit
  may not resolve the dispute before the 2026 election, and may not resolve it
  in their favor. The Texas house select committee on redistricting has
  scheduled a public hearing on the proposed maps for Friday. The Texas AFL-CIO
  put out a call on Wednesday afternoon to pack the capitol in Austin and
  testify. Democratic legislators may leave the state in order to deny
  Republicans a legislative quorum and prevent them from passing law. Doing so
  presents practical and legal costs for those who do, but may be the last
  remaining bargaining chip they have before the issue enters the courts. “I can
  tell you that our members are going to fight it for as long as it takes,”
  Gostomski said, “but at the end of the day, the only real legal mechanism in
  place is, at some point, the GOP leadership has to decide if they are more
  interested in representing their constituents than protecting Donald Trump’s
  power.”
