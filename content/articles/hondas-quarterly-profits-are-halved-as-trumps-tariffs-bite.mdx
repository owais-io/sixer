  The Japanese carmaker Honda has reported a 50% drop in quarterly profits as it
  counted the cost of Donald Trump’s tariffs and electric vehicle policies, even
  as it said the full impact would be less than its worst expectations. The
  manufacturer’s operating profits fell by half to 244bn yen (£1.2bn) in the
  three months to June, according to financial results published on Wednesday.
  That was mainly because of a 124bn yen hit from tariffs, as well as 113bn yen
  in losses on electric car sales in the US. The car industry has been among the
  worst hit by the US tariff chaos, as the US president has specifically
  targeted it in the hope of reviving American car manufacturing. Trump’s
  policies have undermined international and domestic manufacturers who import
  cars and parts into the US through supply chains that have long been globally
  integrated. Trump announced 25% tariffs on all vehicle imports in March,
  pushing total tariffs on imports from countries including Japan to 27.5%.
  However, last month Trump agreed a framework of a trade deal with Japan to
  limit tariffs to 15% – still a significant impact but more manageable. Honda,
  Japan’s second-largest carmaker after Toyota, produces vehicles around the
  world and imports cars and parts to the US from its home country. It also has
  five car assembly factories within the US but it is heavily reliant on
  tariff-hit Mexican and Canadian factories to produce cars for the US market.
  The carmaker said the tariffs would cost it 450bn yen during the year to March
  2026, which is less than the 650bn yen it had previously estimated. The tariff
  impact this financial year will be 200bn yen less than initially feared, in
  part because the company was able to raise prices in the US, a sign of the
  inflationary pressure introduced by tariffs. Trump has said that he “couldn’t
  care less” if tariffs raise car prices for US consumers, although that effect
  has been a key factor in the US Federal Reserve resisting intense pressure
  from the president to cut interest rates. Honda said “sales in North America
  remained strong” aside from the tariff impact. However, there were signs of
  trouble in its electric vehicle sales as it admitted to sustaining losses on
  battery cars sold in the US. It also wrote off money spent on developing new
  electric cars, as some parts of the car industry focus on producing more
  profitable hybrids, combining a battery with a petrol or diesel engine.
