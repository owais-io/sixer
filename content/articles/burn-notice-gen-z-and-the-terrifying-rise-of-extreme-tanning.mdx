  Hannah Clark got her first spray tan for her school prom and has never looked
  back. “I’m not proud of it, but I have used sunbeds,” says the 29-year-old
  graphic designer from Plymouth. Her goal is “that glow you get when coming
  back from holiday. You know, when you walk around and people say: ‘Oh, you
  look really healthy.’ It’s that feeling I’m chasing.” Clark is far from alone.
  On TikTok and Instagram, posts with the hashtag “sunbed” number more than
  500,000. Last year, a survey from skin cancer charity Melanoma Focus found
  that 28% of UK adults use sunbeds, but this rose to 43% among those aged 18 to
  25. This new generation of younger tanning obsessives will go to extreme
  lengths to darken their skin. Some track the UV index – the level of the sun’s
  ultraviolet radiation – and deliberately sit in the sun at the most dangerous
  times of day. Others use unregulated nasal tanning sprays and injections,
  which rely on a chemical to darken the skin. All the people under 30 I spoke
  to for this article know how dangerous tanning is. NHS guidance states that
  there is no safe or healthy way to get a tan and advises keeping out of the
  sun between 11am and 3pm, wearing sunscreen of at least factor 30, and
  covering up with clothing, hats and sunglasses. Dr Zoe Venables, a consultant
  dermatologist at Norfolk and Norwich University hospitals, with an interest in
  skin cancer epidemiology, says that when skin turns darker after UV exposure
  it “suggests you’re damaging those cells in your skin”. Sunbeds are
  categorised by the World Health Organization (WHO) as “dangerous” – with their
  cosmetic use increasing incidences of skin cancers and driving down the age at
  which skin cancer first appears. It says people who have used a sunbed at
  least once at any point in their lives have a 20% greater chance of developing
  melanoma – the deadliest of the three most common forms of skin cancer – than
  someone who hasn’t. For someone who has used a tanning bed for the first time
  before the age of 35, there is a 59% greater chance of developing melanoma.
  Despite this stark reality, having a tan is still presented to many young
  people as aspirational – whether it’s faux tan-lines appearing on catwalks or
  bronzed influencers on holidays in Dubai. Many sunbed shop owners sell tanning
  as a form of “self-care”, while influencers post “come for a sunbed with me”
  videos. Perhaps most perniciously, some sunbed shops even make light of the
  known risk associated with them. One meme shared on Instagram by a tanning
  salon overlays the text: “When someone tells you sunbeds are bad for you” with
  a clip from the sitcom Benidorm, in which the character Madge Harvey says: “I
  spy with my little eye something beginning with AB: absolute bollocks.” Emily
  Harris, 23, from Leeds, uses sunbeds. Her parents both work for the NHS and
  have warned her about the risks. But she says that having spent most of her
  teenage years in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, followed by various
  global conflicts and the ever-looming presence of climate breakdown, the
  dangers of a sunbed seem small by comparison. “You can die of anything – do
  you know what I mean?” she says. While Harris, who works in sales, can’t
  afford to use sunbeds all the time, she uses them whenever she has “a bit of
  spare money”, making use of the deals that salons offer. Before a recent
  holiday, she bought a package that gave her unlimited minutes, with a daily
  limit, for four weeks. “I was going every day,” Harris says, which she admits
  “is a bit silly”, but adds: “I was trying to make the most of the package.” As
  well as using tanning beds, Harris is “obsessed with tracking the UV”, and has
  the index on the lock-screen of her phone. She and her colleagues plan their
  breaks around times when the UV index is highest, so they can maximise their
  exposure to the dangerous radiation. A number of her friends also use nasal
  tanning sprays, which were the subject of a Trading Standards warning issued
  earlier this year that stated: “These products can cause nausea, vomiting,
  high blood pressure, and even changes in mole shape and size … studies have
  shown a potential link to melanoma, a type of skin cancer.” Harris tried one
  when her friend had a spare bottle, but “didn’t see a result” so hasn’t used
  one again. Was she worried about what might have been in it? “To be honest,
  not really. I know it’s bad, but at the time, I was more bothered about
  getting a tan.” Nasals, as they are known, usually contain a lab-made
  substance called melanotan II, a chemical that darkens skin pigmentation.
  Though it is illegal to sell medicinal products containing melanotan II in the
  UK, cosmetic products fall outside that remit and are easily available on
  social media. Dr Suraj Kukadia, a GP known to his 282,000 TikTok followers as
  “Doctor Sooj”, is concerned about the popularity of nasal sprays. He says
  melanotan II can also lead to “painful and sustained erections in men, kidney
  damage, acne and muscle-wasting”. Holly Feldman, 25, lives in Surrey and is
  the CEO of a swimwear boutique. She has more than 10,000 followers on
  Instagram and is often sent free tanning products such as nasal sprays and
  injections. “I think that was why it was so addictive for me,” she says.
  Though she had no idea what was in these products, and the injections in
  particular made her feel unwell, she says: “I was just trying to turn a blind
  eye to it because I was so obsessed with how it made me look.” Feldman
  recently appeared on former Love Island contestant Olivia Attwood’s ITV
  documentary series The Price of Perfection, in which Attwood explores the
  risks of various cosmetic treatments. Being on the show made Feldman realise
  how much potential damage she could be doing. She hasn’t used a tanning
  injection for four months, and has reduced her use of a nasal spray to a
  couple of times over the past month, when previously it would have been four
  inhalations a day. “I do still use sunbeds,” she says. “But I have cut down.
  There was a time when I was going on them four, five, six times a week and now
  I only go on them once or twice.” Data from the UK and Ireland’s Sunbed
  Association suggests that tanning beds are most popular among 25- to
  45-year-olds, and more women than men use them. But that’s not to say gen Z
  men are free from the pressure to sport a tan. Craig Hopkins, a 29-year-old
  dance teacher based in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, says he uses sunbeds to “look
  like I’ve just come back from holiday”. He prefers the look of a “real” tan to
  a fake tan, which ties in to existing social media trends such as “looking
  expensive” and “quiet luxury”. “On Instagram especially, everyone is always on
  holiday, always super brown. So it’s probably just trying to keep up,” Harris
  says. Like Harris, Hopkins also tried a nasal spray once, via a friend who
  used to sell them, but it made him “feel really sick”. Despite the known risks
  and side-effects, most of the young people I spoke to for this article were
  still willing to give nasal sprays a try. Megan Urbaniak, a 23-year-old nail
  technician from Rotherham, says: “I feel as if I know a million people who use
  them and everyone seems to have been fine. It does kind of weird me out that
  they don’t tell you what’s in them, but I’m sure there’s worse in the world.”
  Urbaniak is a regular sunbed user – and has even encouraged friends to use
  them before going on holiday “because it stops you from burning immediately
  when going in the sun”. Venables is quick to debunk claims such as this,
  saying that all it does is put your skin through even more “excess UV
  exposure”. She points to another type of common skin cancer, squamous cell
  carcinoma, which is thought to be due to cumulative UV exposure. While
  Urbaniak does not seem to be put off by any safety concerns, she is keen to
  stress that there is a “cultural line that you probably shouldn’t cross” when
  it comes to tanning as a white person. “I don’t think that my body is capable
  of going that colour, but if it was, I’d like to think someone would tell me
  to stop.” That said, it isn’t just white people who like to tan. Melissa
  Jones, 19, from Chester, says she has “seen way more people of colour –
  including south-east Asian girls like me – getting into tanning. For me, it’s
  not about being darker – it’s about adding that warm, radiant glow and evening
  out my tone”. Like Feldman, Jones uses the word “addictive” in relation to her
  tanning habit, and thinks it helps her in her job as a content creator. Tanned
  skin “looks amazing on camera and in content”, she says. However, she has
  recently switched from using tanning beds to using only fake tan. “I became
  more aware of the risks, like ageing, skin cancer, all of that.” The WHO has
  urged countries to consider banning sunbeds: Australia banned all commercial
  sunbeds 10 years ago and Brazil banned them in 2009. Kukadia and Venables both
  say they would like them banned in the UK. Jak Howell, a 26-year-old content
  creator from Swansea, has been urging his followers to stop using sunbeds
  since he was diagnosed with stage three advanced melanoma when he was 21,
  which his doctors were surprised to see in someone so young, and said was
  probably due to his use of sunbeds. Howell had been using sunbeds regularly
  since he was 15 (it has been illegal for under-18s to use tanning beds since
  2010, but the ones Howell used weren’t staffed. Customers bought tokens from a
  machine and slotted them into the beds). When a mole appeared on his back that
  “kept bleeding and scabbing over but never healing”, he sent a photograph of
  it to his GP and was immediately referred to hospital. He underwent
  radiotherapy and surgeries to remove his lymph nodes, but these failed to
  remove the cancer. Eventually, after a year of immunotherapy, which
  “completely knocks you for six”, he went into remission. Howell now wants to
  see sunbeds banned. He tells young users: “OK, it hasn’t happened yet, but it
  could happen. And when it does happen, it is far, far worse than anything I
  could ever describe and you could ever imagine.” For many young people,
  though, the allure of the sunbed’s “instant fix” is too great to resist. And
  it’s not as if this is the first time young people have put themselves at
  risk. As Kukadia points out: “If alcohol was discovered or invented now, it
  would be illegal.” But tanning does feel different from other classic
  rebellious pursuits such as binge drinking, cigarettes and drugs because
  people don’t do it for fun, but to achieve a certain aesthetic – a symptom,
  perhaps, of our screen-filtered lives. “If I wasn’t on social media, I
  probably wouldn’t use sunbeds,” Feldman admits, but because her job requires
  social media use, she can’t see herself stopping. A few years ago, Clark
  noticed a dark, “pretty scary-looking” lesion on her leg, and was referred to
  a dermatologist. Though it didn’t turn out to be skin cancer-related, she had
  to have it removed, and the experience has stopped her being so “frivolous”
  with tanning beds. Urbaniak can’t see herself giving up either. “If something
  were to go wrong, then maybe I’d reconsider,” she says. “But I feel as if I’m
  in that generation where we all just live in denial until something happens.”
