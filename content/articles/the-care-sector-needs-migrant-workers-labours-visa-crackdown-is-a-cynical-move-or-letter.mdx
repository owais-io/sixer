  You are right to highlight, in your editorial, the folly of the government’s
  decision to make it harder for migrant workers to find work as carers in the
  UK (The Guardian view on Labour’s visa crackdown in social care: another
  problem for an overstretched system, 22 July). It’s a cynical political move
  aimed at spiking Reform UK’s guns on immigration, rather than alleviating
  pressure on the much-maligned care sector. Migrant workers are indispensable
  in filling roles that have been undervalued, underpaid and unwanted for too
  long. With thousands more care professionals needed to look after our ageing
  population, the government needs a joined-up approach if the crisis-ridden
  sector is to be transformed. While the government’s fair pay agreement is the
  first step in turning care around, ministers must think again on their
  approach to foreign help – and, closer to home, announce the funding to make
  the fair pay agreement a reality. Decent wages and sufficient staff are
  essential elements of the promised national care service the country needs so
  desperately. Christina McAnea General secretary, Unison • Have an opinion on
  anything you’ve read in the Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it
  will be considered for publication in our letters section.
