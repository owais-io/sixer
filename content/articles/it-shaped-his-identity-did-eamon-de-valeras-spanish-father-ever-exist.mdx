  Éamon de Valera fought in Ireland’s 1916 rebellion and, as taoiseach and
  president, stamped his identity on the newly independent country. Modern
  Ireland has since rejected much of his conservative Catholic ethos, but De
  Valera remains a founding father. There is enduring mystery, however, over his
  paternity – gaps in the record fuelled whispers and speculation about the
  Spanish artist, Vivion de Valera, said to be his father. As taoiseach, Dev, as
  he was known, instructed Ireland’s ambassador in Madrid to investigate the
  Spanish side of his family tree, but the ambassador drew a blank. Now an RTÉ
  documentary has found fresh evidence that suggests Vivion de Valera never
  existed – that he was invented and that the real father’s identity was
  concealed. The first part of Dev: Rise and Rule, a two-part documentary, on 3
  September, will shine a light on discrepancies in De Valera’s birth
  certificate and undermine the claims about a putative Spanish father. “You
  might ask does it matter if his parents were really married? Does it matter
  who his father really was?” says David McCullagh, the documentary’s presenter.
  “But the point is, it mattered to him. It shaped his character.” The programme
  is part of renewed debate over De Valera’s personality and impact on Ireland
  amid the 50th anniversary of his death, which passed on 29 August. Some
  historians faulted him for Ireland’s economic travails in the 1930s while
  others lauded him for keeping the country out of the second world war. The
  documentary traces an arc from De Valera’s uncertain origins and his mother’s
  aloofness, to his complex personality. “The doubts about his paternity, and
  his rejection by his mother, left him with questions about his identity that
  would preoccupy him throughout his long life,” says McCullagh. De Valera’s
  mother, Catherine Coll, from County Limerick, emigrated to the United States
  in 1879. She said she married Vivion de Valera in Greenville, New Jersey in
  1881 and gave birth to their son in Manhattan the following year. She also
  said her husband died in the western US around two years later. De Valera’s
  New York state birth certificate, dated 10 November 1882, names Vivion as the
  father, whose name is spelt De Valero. His mother’s name is spelt Kate De
  Valero née Coll, implying they were married. Scholars have never found a
  church or state record of the marriage, nor of Vivion’s entry to the US or
  death. In the documentary, McCullagh uncovers a second New York state birth
  certificate – a copy that De Valera’s mother requested in June 1916 when her
  son faced execution in Ireland for his role in the rebellion, to prove that he
  was a US citizen. McCullagh notes that the amended certificate spells the
  surname De Valera – and that the handwriting appears identical to that in the
  original certificate, and matches the signature of De Valera’s mother. A
  doctor or public official was supposed to complete birth certificates, not
  parents. “I’ve seen many, many birth certificates and this is an exceptional
  situation,” Kenneth Cobb, a New York city archivist, tells the documentary.
  McCullagh, who has authored a two-volume biography of De Valera, says doubts
  about paternity, and his mother’s decision to send him to Ireland, aged two,
  to be raised by his grandmother, left him troubled. In a forthcoming book of
  essays about Irish leaders – The Taoiseach: a Century of Political Leadership,
  edited by Iain Dale – McCullagh argues that De Valera’s unmoored identity
  perhaps influenced his embrace of institutions and causes that offered a sense
  of belonging, such as his school, Blackrock College, the Irish language and
  Irish nationalism.
