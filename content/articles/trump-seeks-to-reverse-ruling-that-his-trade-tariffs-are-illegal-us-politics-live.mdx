  Several survivors of Jeffrey Epstein’s abuse signaled their support on
  Wednesday for a bipartisan resolution to release all the files related to the
  convicted sex offender, who died in a Manhattan prison in 2019. Speaking
  outside the US Capitol, Anouska De Georgiou, a survivor of both Epstein and
  his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, said that while “every day of this
  journey toward healing has come at a profound cost to my mental health”, she
  had chosen to be there because this legislation “really matters”. The only
  motive to oppose the bill would be to “conceal wrongdoing”, she added, but
  also issued a plea to Donald Trump to use his power and influence to help
  release the full tranche of records on Epstein. The section of the Capitol
  grounds, known as the House Triangle, was packed with reporters and
  demonstrators. Signs accusing the US president of “protecting pedophiles” were
  raised alongside placards demanding the administration “release the files”,
  and messages of support for survivors, reading “we believe you”. Many of those
  at the news conference told personal stories of how they were abused and
  trafficked. Annie Farmer, now 46, said she was only 16 when she was flown to
  New Mexico to spend a weekend with Epstein and Maxwell. “For so many years, it
  felt like Epstein’s criminal behavior was an open secret,” Farmer said. “Not
  only did many others participate in the abuse, it is clear that many were
  aware of his interest in girls and very young women and chose to look the
  other way because it benefited them to do so.” At the same press conference,
  the bill’s co-author, Republican representative Thomas Massie said that he is
  close to reaching the 218 signatures needed to bypass US House leadership and
  bring his bipartisan legislation, calling for the release of the Epstein
  files, to a floor vote. “Hopefully they can find their spines,” the Kentucky
  lawmaker said of the Republican holdouts. “I’m calling on my colleagues to be
  one of the next two who sponsors this discharge petition.” President Donald
  Trump on Thursday will host more than two dozen technology and business
  leaders for a dinner in the newly renovated White House Rose Garden, according
  to a White House official. The guests include Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg,
  Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft founder Bill Gates and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman,
  the official said. The gathering highlights Trump’s complicated but evolving
  relationship with Silicon Valley and the broader tech industry, Reuters
  reported. Once a source of frequent clashes over issues such as content
  moderation and antitrust scrutiny, the tech sector has recalibrated since
  Trump’s 2024 election victory. Executives have sought closer ties with the
  Republican administration, aligning corporate policies with the White House’s
  push to roll back diversity and equity initiatives while courting Trump’s
  favor on artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies. “The
  president looks forward to welcoming top business, political and tech leaders
  for this dinner and the many dinners to come on the new, beautiful Rose Garden
  patio,” White House spokesman Davis Ingle said. The Trump administration
  purposefully chose a notorious Louisiana prison to hold immigration detainees
  as a way to encourage people in the US illegally to self-deport, Department of
  Homeland Security (DHS) secretary Kristi Noem said Wednesday. A complex inside
  the Louisiana state penitentiary, an immense rural prison better known as
  Angola, will be used to detain those whom Noem described as the “worst of the
  worst” Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detainees. Noem was speaking
  to reporters as she stood on the grounds of the facility near a new sign
  reading, “Louisiana Lockup.” “This facility will hold the most dangerous of
  criminals,” Noem said, adding it had “absolutely” been chosen for its
  reputation. Officials said 51 detainees were already being housed at Angola.
  But Louisiana governor Jeff Landry said he expects the building to be filled
  to capacity, expecting over 400 people to come in ensuing months, as president
  Donald Trump continues his large-scale attempt to remove millions of people
  suspected of entering the country illegally. The dirt road to the new Ice
  facility meanders past lofty oak trees, green fields and other buildings –
  including a white church and a structure with a sign that says, “Angola Shake
  Down Team”. The facility is surrounded by a fence with five rows of stacked
  barbed wire. Overlooking the outdoor area is a tower, where a guard paced back
  and forth. At the prison entrance a sign reads: “You are entering the land of
  new beginnings.” Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. I’m Tom
  Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest news lines over the next few
  hours. We start with news that Donald Trump has asked the US supreme court to
  overturn a lower court decision that most of his sweeping trade tariffs were
  illegal. The US president filed a petition late on Wednesday to ask for a
  review of last week’s federal appeals court ruling in Washington DC, which
  centred on his “liberation day” border taxes introduced on 2 April, which
  imposed levies of between 10% and 50% on most US imports, sending shock waves
  through global trade and markets. The court found in a 7-4 ruling last Friday
  that Trump had overstepped his presidential powers when he invoked a 1977 law
  designed to address national emergencies to justify his “reciprocal” tariffs.
  The decision was the biggest blow yet to Trump’s tariff policies, but the
  levies were left in place until 14 October – giving the administration time to
  ask the supreme court to review the decision. Trump has now appealed and the
  supreme court is expected to review the case, although the justices must still
  agree to do so. The administration asked for that decision to be made by 10
  September. The appeal calls for an accelerated schedule with arguments being
  heard by 10 November, according to filings seen by Bloomberg. Justices could
  then rule by the end of the year. Read the full story here: In other
  developments: Children in Florida will no longer be required to receive
  vaccines against preventable diseases including measles, mumps, chickenpox,
  polio and hepatitis. The governors of California, Oregon and Washington
  announced on Wednesday the creation of a West Coast Health Alliance aimed at
  safeguarding access to vaccines. A letter published on Wednesday from more
  than 1,000 past and present workers of the Department of Health and Human
  Services department (HHS) has demanded the resignation of Robert F Kennedy Jr.
  Donald Trump on Thursday will host more than two dozen technology and business
  leaders for a dinner, according to a White House official. The guests include
  Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft founder Bill Gates
  and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Several survivors of Jeffrey Epstein’s abuse
  signaled their support on Wednesday for a bipartisan resolution to release all
  the files related to the convicted sex offender. A so-called “missing minute”
  of CCTV footage, a key ingredient of conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein’s
  death in prison has been found, contradicting the assertion of Pam Bondi, the
  attorney general, that it was recorded over. A federal judge on Wednesday
  ruled Donald Trump’s administration unlawfully terminated about $2.2bn in
  grants awarded to Harvard University and can no longer cut off research
  funding to the Ivy League school. Jeff Landry, the Republican governor of
  Louisiana, said he backed the president’s threat to send federal troops to his
  state. Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, warned that the US military would
  continue to target vessels belonging to alleged Venezuelan drug cartels.
