  Facial recognition technology has been proven repeatedly to be discriminatory
  against communities of colour and will further entrench racism within policing
  (Met police to more than double use of live facial recognition, 31 July). It
  has been known to lead to misidentification and the risk of wrongful arrest,
  as we saw in the reporting this week on the case of Shaun Thompson. It’s also
  known to be less accurate in scanning the faces of people of colour, so using
  it to target attenders of Notting Hill carnival is very concerning, especially
  when we consider the Casey report’s conclusion that the Metropolitan police
  are guilty of institutional racism. No matter who we are, we should all feel
  safe to move freely without risk of harassment or false arrest. These systems
  violate our right to privacy, our rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and
  expression, and to equality and non-discrimination. This is particularly the
  case given the continued lack of government regulation on these technologies,
  leaving police to write their own rules with no accountability or oversight.
  The Met’s plans to use this dangerous and discriminatory tool of surveillance
  should be immediately scrapped. Alba Kapoor Amnesty International UK • Have an
