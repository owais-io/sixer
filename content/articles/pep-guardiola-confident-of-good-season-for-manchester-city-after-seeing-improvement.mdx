  improvement

  Pep Guardiola says he can sense that Manchester City will have a good year
  after seeing a marked improvement in the squad, starting from the Club World
  Cup, but wants to see consistency from the team. After thrashing Wolves at
  Molineux on the opening weekend, a home defeat by Tottenham brought them back
  down to earth for a mixed start to the campaign. City will be aiming to get
  over that loss at Brighton on Sunday in the final match before the
  international break. The two-week gap will deny them the chance to build
  momentum for now but when they return to action against Manchester United, it
  will initiate the start of a hectic domestic and European schedule. Asked why
  he was feeling confident, the City head coach said: “The way we are training
  and the way we are competing. We have to improve, but there are things that I
  would say are a sign. When I see these things in games, like in the United
  States of America, I like it. We won six Premier Leagues in eight years and
  when we started the season I wouldn’t say I knew we were going to win the
  league. But I see things that I like. “Even against Spurs I saw many things
  that I like my teams to do. I want to do some of them much, much better, but
  that is completely normal at this stage of the season. You will see through
  the results. When you are able to win four, five or six games in a row, or
  you’re competing well, or being stable in many departments, conceding few and
  scoring much more. After that I will say: ‘Our consistency is back.’” The
  first stage of the Champions League will begin after the Manchester derby with
  the visit of Napoli on Thursday 18 September and the prospect of playing twice
  almost every week until the end of January will give the opportunity to build
  up rhythm. Five players have arrived since the end of last season, three
  making debuts at the Club World Cup, but Guardiola is waiting for them to
  integrate fully into a team that have adjusted their style since finishing a
  distant third in the Premier League and trophyless overall. “Maybe in two
  months I will say how wrong I was, but right now I have seen, since we
  travelled to the States for the World Cup, I have seen things that I like,”
  Guardiola said.
