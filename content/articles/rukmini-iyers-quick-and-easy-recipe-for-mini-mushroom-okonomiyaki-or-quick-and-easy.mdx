  I’ve made chef Tim Anderson’s okonomiyaki from memory for years, realising
  only recently that rice is not a traditional ingredient and that his recipe
  is, in fact, for rice yaki, a speciality of Kyushu. It’s the first cousin to
  okonomiyaki in that it’s a crisp cabbage pancake, but with cooked rice as the
  main ingredient; after that, however, it’s up to you what you put in. I like
  to make this mini mushroom version because, miraculously, my children eat it.
  And the secret to a super-crisp pancake? A good gluten-free flour (I like
  Freee) – the combination of flours in a gluten-free mix gives you an amazingly
  crisp pancake. Mini mushroom okonomiyaki I really like finely chopped kimchi
  and greek yoghurt on the side. After all, okonomi means “as you like it”,
  which I take as a green light for “anything goes”. Prep 15 min Cook 15 min
  Serves 2-3 2 tbsp sesame oil, or neutral oil 150g shiitake mushrooms, roughly
  chopped 1 garlic clove, peeled and finely grated 2½cm piece fresh ginger,
  peeled and grated 1½ tsp flaky sea salt 2 eggs, beaten 100g white cabbage,
  thinly sliced 200g cooked white rice 50g cheddar, roughly chopped 40g
  gluten-free flour 3 spring onions, finely sliced To serve Mayonnaise and brown
  sauce, or Kewpie and okonomi sauce, if you have it Heat a tablespoon of oil in
  a nonstick frying pan, then add the mushrooms, garlic, ginger and a
  half-teaspoon of flaky salt. Stir-fry for four to five minutes, until the
  mushrooms are just cooked through, then tip into a bowl. Add the beaten eggs,
  cabbage, cooked rice, cheddar, flour, spring onions and the remaining teaspoon
  of salt to the mushroom bowl, and mix well to combine. Heat the remaining
  tablespoon of oil in the same frying pan, then, working in batches, add
  tablespoons of the mixture and flatten each one into a rough disc. Fry the
  mini okonomiyaki on a medium heat for two to three minutes on each side, until
  golden brown (the cheese will melt in patches and crisp up), then transfer to
  a plate lined with kitchen roll and keep warm in a low (70C (50C fan)/gas very
  low) oven while you cook the rest of the mixture. Serve hot with your choice
  of sauces: Japanese mayonnaise and okonomiyaki sauce are traditional, but
  regular mayonnaise and brown (or, indeed, tamarind) sauce are good, too, if
  that’s what you have.
