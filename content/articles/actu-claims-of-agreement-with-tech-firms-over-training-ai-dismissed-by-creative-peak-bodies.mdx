  creative peak bodies

  The Australian Council of Trade Unions claims that it has reached a
  “breakthrough” agreement with the tech sector on a model for payment for using
  creative content in training AI has triggered alarm among bodies representing
  creative professionals. Speaking on the sidelines of the economic reform
  roundtable, the secretary of the ACTU, Sally McManus, said “there was
  discussion with the Tech Council and ACTU about wanting to address the issue
  of paying creatives, journalists and academics for their data (and) their
  creative work that they do”. “That’s quite a significant shift, and it’s one
  we really welcome.” McManus said tech companies were already “rushing ahead”
  in their exploitation of content to train large language models. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email “They’ll be crawling all your data. And people whose
  livelihoods depend on their creative output deserve not to have that stolen
  from them,” she said. “And so we’re committed to doing everything we can to
  address that. It was, I think, a big thing for the Tech Council to step up and
  say, ‘This is something we’re prepared to work on with you’.” But the CEO of
  the Tech Council, Damian Kassagbi, played down the significance of the
  roundtable discussions. “We are hopeful we can find a path forward on
  copyright that allows AI training to take place in Australia while also
  including appropriate protections for creators that make a living from their
  work,” Kassagbi said in a statement. “What that path looks like has not been
  determined or agreed.” Industry groups representing the creative professions
  are opposed to granting a “fair use” exemption to text and data mining under
  copyright law. On Friday morning, Kassagbi argued in an interview on ABC Radio
  National that artists and creatives have benefited from technology, like
  Spotify, which he said had paid out billions of dollars in music royalties.
  Asked whether tech companies would provide compensation for material used to
  train AI, Kassagbi said “At this stage, it’s too early to answer that
  question”. “We believe we can work with the creative industry as we develop AI
  tools. What’s also important is the AI internet represents Australian content
  and culture,” he said. McManus, on Friday, called it a starting step and
  agreed it was too early to specify how a potential compensation scheme would
  work. The CEO of the Australian Recording Industry Association, Annabelle
  Heard, said any talk of an “agreement” was misplaced as tech companies should
  simply comply with existing copyright law. Heard rejected any suggestion that
  AI firms should be given an exception to fair use rules to allow them to mine
  original Australian content to train their large language models – a prospect
  raised in a recent Productivity Commission report. “Without knowing the
  details of what they have discussed, it’s unclear this is going to end up in a
  better situation for copyright owners. Certainly, we are interested in how you
  can come to an agreement without copyright holders at the table,” she said. In
  a joint statement, the Australian Society of Authors and the Copyright Agency
  said “responsible AI development must operate within the boundaries of
  copyright law”. “Innovation should be supported through licensed access – not
  through the unauthorised access of copyright content for the training of large
  language models.” A News Corp Australia spokesperson said the copyright act
  was “a strong framework that requires no change”. • This article was amended
