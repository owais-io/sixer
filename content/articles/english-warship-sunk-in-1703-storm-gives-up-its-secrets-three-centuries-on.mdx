  The English warship HMS Northumberland was built in 1679 as part of a wave of
  naval modernisation overseen by Samuel Pepys, a decade after he had stopped
  writing his celebrated diary and gone on to become the Royal Navy’s most
  senior administrator. Twenty-four years later, after the ship had taken part
  in many of the major naval battles of its day, it was at the bottom of the
  North Sea, a victim of the Great Storm of 1703, one of the deadliest weather
  disasters in British history. Now, more than three centuries later, the
  Northumberland is giving up its secrets thanks to shifting sands off the Kent
  coast, which have exposed a large section of its hull. A survey has revealed
  that the ship is in a remarkable state of preservation, with not only its
  timbers but ropes and even unopened casks having been protected from erosion
  and decay in the sand. The survey, funded by Historic England, which oversees
  protected wreck sites around the country, found that much more of the ship’s
  hull remains than was previously thought, potentially making the wreck of the
  Northumberland one of the best-preserved wooden warships in the UK. Other
  artefacts detected on the seabed include copper cauldrons, seven iron cannon
  and part of a wooden gun carriage. As more of the Northumberland is revealed,
  however, archaeologists say they are in a race against time to learn all they
  can from what has been called a “Stuart time capsule” before its timbers are
  claimed by the sea. The wreck of the Northumberland, one of more than a dozen
  navy ships lost during the Great Storm, was first located in 1980 in the
  Goodwin Sands, an area of shallow water off the coast of Deal, in eastern
  Kent. Hefin Meara, a marine archaeologist at Historic England, said the area,
  while difficult to access and dive, “is brilliant for preserving material like
  this”. He said: “We’re incredibly lucky that because this site has been
  covered for so long, the sand has kept it in really, really good condition.
  That rope, for instance, is as fresh as it was on the day the ship sailed, and
  we’ve got very well preserved casks and barrels and similar – at this stage we
  just don’t know what is in them.” While the survey found that parts of the
  wreck were standing proud of the seabed, Meara said there was “still quite a
  lot of the ship surviving even deeper into the sand”. “There is a lot of
  archaeology at this site, and there is a huge amount we can learn from it,” he
  added. That includes answering questions such as how ships were made and
  fitted out at a key time in English naval history, when Pepys, as secretary to
  the admiralty, was trying to professionalise it into a modern fighting force.
  Meara said the wealth of organic material surviving was unusual. “Cannon iron
  can survive well at wreck sites, but it is quite rare to come across the
  wooden carriages that they were sitting on. There are many, many things like
  that that give us the opportunity to drill down and find out more.” Among very
  well preserved naval wrecks, marine archaeologists and historians can look to
  the Mary Rose, from the early 16th century, and other ships from the later
  17th and 18th centuries, he said. “This one fills in the gap.” Unlike the Mary
  Rose, however, cost and practicalities mean there are no plans to recover the
  Northumberland. “We have these incredibly dynamic seabed environments where
  wrecks can be buried for hundreds of years – and then that sand cover moves
  away,” Meara said. “Suddenly the wreckage is exposed to marine biological
  organisms and chemical processes operating on things like iron. A wreck that
  can survive in incredibly good condition for centuries will decay very, very
  quickly [once exposed]. So we have a small window of opportunity to go and
  discover what is there, and answer those questions. We are now at the mercy of
  the elements, and it is a race to see what we can save.” • This article was
  amended on 31 July 2025. An earlier version described HMS Northumberland as a
  British warship; however, it was an English naval ship constructed before the
  formation of Great Britain.
