  ‘Palestinian Pelé’

  Mohamed Salah has criticised Uefa for failing to state how a footballer known
  as the “Palestinian Pelé” died in a tribute it posted. Suleiman al-Obeid, 41,
  was killed on Wednesday in southern Gaza when Israeli forces attacked
  civilians waiting for humanitarian aid, the Palestine Football Association
  (PFA) said. “Farewell to Suleiman al-Obeid, the ‘Palestinian Pelé’,” Uefa
  posted on X on Friday. “A talent who gave hope to countless children, even in
  the darkest of times.” Salah replied to Uefa’s post on Saturday, saying: “Can
  you tell us how he died, where, and why?” The Liverpool player and Egypt star
  has consistently voiced sympathy for those in Gaza throughout the conflict.
  Two years ago, he donated to the Egyptian Red Crescent to help fund its relief
  efforts in the region. A fixture in the Palestinian national side after his
  debut in 2007, Obeid gained 24 caps and scored twice, the PFA said last week,
  most memorably with a scissor-kick against Yemen during the 2010 West Asian
  Football Federation championship. ‘‘During his long career, al-Obeid, 41,
  scored more than 100 goals, making him one of the brightest stars of
  Palestinian football,” it said. His talent on the pitch earned him the
  nickname of “the Palestinian Pelé” – a nod to the legendary Brazilian widely
  hailed as one of the greatest players of all time. Obeid’s death added to a
  growing toll of athletes lost in Gaza since the war began, with at least 662
  sportspeople and their relatives reported to have been killed. “The number of
  footballers killed or who died from starvation has reached 421, including 103
  children,” the PFA said. According to the PFA, 288 sports facilities have been
  damaged or reduced to rubble across Gaza and the West Bank, from stadiums and
  training grounds to gyms and clubhouses. The majority, 268, were in Gaza,
  while 20 were in the West Bank, with about half serving football directly.
  Among the sites hit was the PFA’s headquarters in Gaza, struck during an
  Israeli air raid. More than 1,300 Palestinians are reported to have been
  killed in the vicinity of aid distribution points managed by the Gaza
  Humanitarian Foundation since the US- and Israeli-backed logistic group’s
  launch in late May.
