  Donald Trump may be persuaded that the Nobel peace prize he covets will
  “become a genuine possibility” if he succeeds in bullying Ukraine “into
  accepting the unacceptable” (Editorial, 11 August). But the idea that this
  deluded and most undiplomatic and unpeaceful of US presidents could ever join
  such recipients as Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama and Martin Luther King Jr is
  ludicrous. Alfred Nobel intended the prize in the first instance for efforts
  for “the abolition or reduction of standing armies”. Under Trump, the already
  bloated Pentagon budget has skyrocketed; in June he celebrated the US army’s
  250th birthday (as well as his own birthday) with a military parade, complete
  with tanks, missiles, and aeroplanes overhead; in February, he signed an
  executive order to dismantle the US Institute of Peace, resulting in the
  unlawful firing of its president and board members. Nobel also mentioned in
  his will efforts to promote “fraternity between nations”. Trump’s Maga
  programme is at the expense of other nations, causing anger and anxiety in
  Canada, Denmark, Greenland, Iceland and elsewhere. He is complicit in the
  destruction of the Palestinian nation and the continuing devastation of
  Ukraine. The fact that he has been nominated is of little consequence (Hitler
  was too) and reflects poorly on the nominators. Dr Peter van den Dungen
  Visiting fellow, Norwegian Nobel Institute, 2000 • Might the inclusion of
  Mar-a-Lago in the territories to be ceded to Russia get the Trump-Putin deal
  over the line (No deal, and no answers, after brief Trump-Putin talks on
  Ukraine in Alaska, 14 August)? Malcolm Rush Peterborough • Have an opinion on
  anything you’ve read in the Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it
  will be considered for publication in our letters section.
