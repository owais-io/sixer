  My friend and former colleague, Nick Kent, who has died aged 72, was a
  journalist on the Daily Mirror; he later moved into book publishing. With
  several others he and I launched the fortnightly Greyound Star newspaper in
  1984 while we were both still at the Mirror, and by 1988 we had switched to
  working on it full-time. Soon afterwards the two of us sold our shares in the
  business to concentrate on another venture, Ringpress, which published books
  about every kind of pet, from goldfish to parrots. Along with a third
  director, Julia Barnes, we sold Ringpress in 2002 and Nick decided to retire.
  Nick was born in Southend, Essex (a circumstance that gave him a lifelong
  enthusiasm for jellied eels), to Frederick, a civil servant, and Emily (nee
  Ficken), a seamstress. After the early death of his father, he and his
  brother, Michael, moved with their mother to the village of Little Cornard,
  near Sudbury, in Suffolk, where he grew up. He began his journalistic career
  while at Sudbury grammar school, writing a fishing column for the local paper.
  Later at Nottingham University he edited the student newspaper and, after
  gaining a degree in English and American studies he joined the Mirror Group
  graduate training scheme in 1974. Working on provincial newspapers in the west
  of England for two years, he switched to London with the weekly tabloid
  newspaper Reveille in 1976 and then, in 1979, the Daily Mirror as a features
  subeditor. By 1984 he had become one of the youngest chief subeditors in the
  Daily Mirror’s history, on the features desk; I was chief news subeditor on
  the paper at the same time. He also talked his way into being the Mirror’s
  first wine correspondent, once saying of an offering from the Co-op that “this
  wine is best drunk on its own, like your correspondent”. After eventually
  selling Ringpress, Nick set up home in Cannes, in the south of France, with
  his first wife, the novelist Deanna Maclaren, whom he had married in 1987.
  There he discovered a passion for long-distance walking in the mountains above
  the Côte d’Azur and Liguria. He was also a volunteer driver, enabling people
  with disabilities to experience the joys of the great outdoors. In 2014 he
  returned to London and set aside retirement to become managing director of the
  ailing Peter Owen Publishing, one of the oldest independent producers of
  fiction. While unable to restore the business to past glories, he kept it
  afloat until its sale in 2022, when he entered into his second retirement, in
  Saxmundham, Suffolk. Though living with serious depression for much of his
  life, Nick had a remarkable ability to embrace new opportunities and
  interests. He had a passion for golf, wine and enjoying himself. After a
  divorce from Deanna in 2017, the following year Nick married Antonia Owen,
  whose father had set up Peter Owen Publishing. She survives him.
