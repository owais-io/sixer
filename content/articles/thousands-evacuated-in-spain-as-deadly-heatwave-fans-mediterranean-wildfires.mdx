  The deadly heatwave fanning wildfires across the Mediterranean region has
  claimed at least three lives and forced thousands of people from their homes.
  Firefighters continued to battle blazes on Tuesday and authorities braced for
  further damage as temperatures in some areas surged well past 40C. In Spain, a
  Romanian man in his 50s died after suffering 98% burns while trying to rescue
  horses from a burning stable near Madrid on Monday night. A four-year-old boy
  who was found unconscious in his family’s car in Sardinia died in Rome on
  Monday after suffering irreversible brain damage caused by heatstroke. And in
  Montenegro, one soldier died and another was seriously injured when their
  water tanker overturned while fighting wildfires in the hills north of the
  capital, Podgorica, on Tuesday. Scientist have warned that the heat currently
  affecting large parts of Europe is creating perfect conditions for wildfires
  and serving as another reminder of the climate emergency. “Thanks to climate
  change, we now live in a significantly warmer world,” Akshay Deoras, a
  research scientist at the University of Reading’s meteorology department told
  Agence France-Presse, adding that “many still underestimate the danger”. The
  fire in Tres Cantos, near Madrid – which had been fuelled by winds of 70km/h
  (45mph) and which has devoured 1,000 hectares of land – was still not under
  control on Tuesday evening, when further strong gusts were expected. The
  regional government said it had recovered 150 dead sheep and 18 dead horses
  from the area. More than 3,700 people were evacuated from 16 municipalities
  amid dozens of reported blazes in the north-western region of Castilla y León,
  including one that damaged the Unesco world heritage-listed Roman-era mining
  site at Les Médulas. Authorities in neighbouring Galicia said the largest
  wildfire of the year had burned through 3,000 hectares of land in Ourense
  province. In the southern town of Tarifa, firefighters on the ground and in
  planes battled a fire that broke out on Monday, with 2,000 people evacuated.
  The blazes have led the interior ministry to declare a “pre-emergency phase”
  to help coordinate emergency resources. The prime minister, Pedro Sánchez,
  offered his condolences to the family of the man who died after the Tres
  Cantos fire, and thanked the emergency services for their “tireless efforts”.
  He urged people to recognise the seriousness of the situation. “We’re at
  extreme risk of forest fires,” he said in a message on X on Tuesday. “Let’s be
  very careful.” In neighbouring Portugal, firefighters were battling three
  large wildfires in the centre and north of the country. Authorities in Greece
  requested EU help as fires, fuelled by gale force winds, ripped across vast
  swathes of the western Peloponnese and emergency services ordered the
  evacuation of thousands of residents. Firefighters were also trying to contain
  blazes on the popular Ionian tourist islands of Zakynthos and Kefalonia. With
  gusts hampering firefighting efforts, emergency services ordered all hotels in
  the region of Agala and Keri on Zakynthos to temporarily close, forcing
  suitcase-wielding holidaymakers to flee and relocate to other areas. By late
  Tuesday, dozens of firefighters, supported by 15 fire trucks and eight
  water-bombing planes and helicopters, were still trying to douse the
  fast-moving flames. “Everything that civil protection can offer is here but
  there are very strong winds and the fires are out of control,” said the
  island’s mayor, Giorgos Stasinopoulos. “We need a lot more air support, it’s
  vital.” The fire service said it was also dealing with blazes farther north in
  Epirus, around Preveza and in the central region of Aetolia-Acarnania. Despite
  temperatures nudging 43C in some parts of the Peloponnese region of southern
  Greece on Tuesday – and the prolonged drought, which has produced highly
  flammable conditions on tinder-dry soil – officials described the outbreak of
  so many fires as “suspiciously high”. Faced with an estimated 63 blazes
  erupting and firefighters confronting flames on 106 fronts, fire officers
  dispatched specialist teams to several of the stricken regions to investigate
  possible arson. In Albania, hundreds of firefighters and troops had subdued
  most of the nearly 40 fires that flared up in the past 24 hours, the defence
  ministry said, but more than a dozen were still active. Since the start of
  July, nearly 34,000 hectares have been scorched nationwide, according to the
  European Forest Fire Information System. Police say many of the blazes were
  deliberate, with more than 20 people arrested. In Croatia, about 150
  firefighters spent Monday night defending homes near the port city of Split.
  In the north-western Turkish province of Çanakkale, more than 2,000 people
  were evacuated and 77 people treated in hospital for smoke inhalation after
  fires broke out near the tourist village of Güzelyalı, authorities said.
  Images on Turkish media showed homes and cars ablaze, while more than 760
  firefighters, 10 planes, nine helicopters and more than 200 vehicles were
  deployed to battle the flames. Turkey this year experienced its hottest July
  since records began 55 years ago. In southern France, where temperature
  records were broken in at least four weather stations, the government called
  for vigilance. The south-western city of Bordeaux hit a record 41.6C on
  Monday, while all-time records were broken at meteorological stations in
  Bergerac, Cognac and Saint Girons, according to the national weather service,
  Météo France. Agence France-Presse contributed to this report
