  Of all the unflinching moments in the new Netflix blockbuster, America’s Team:
  the Gambler and his Cowboys, one stands out more than most. It comes after the
  Dallas Cowboys’ former star receiver Michael Irvin is asked about the White
  House, the secret mansion where some players would unwind while winning three
  Super Bowls during the 1990s. “I was the president of the White House,” Irvin
  says with a cackle, his eyes lighting up. “It was a safe place for
  camaraderie.” But this, it turns out, was a very different style of team
  building than going down the pub. “We had five rooms and whatever you liked
  you were going to mingle with your like,” Irvin says. “In that room you may be
  smoking weed, in this room they may be doing ecstasy, coke, whatever. There’s
  a group of girls in each room and you just kind of bounced from room to room.”
  Another player says: “We played hard, then we played hard.” A third confesses
  to getting locked up “two or three times” and being let loose by cops “maybe
  100 times”. Then the Cowboys’ fixer appears, to explain how he would clean
  things up. At this point two thoughts come to mind. This is a far grittier
  and, yes, better sports documentary than The Last Dance, the Michael Jordan
  hagiography that bewitched us during lockdown. In fact, I am not sure I have
  seen a more complete portrayal of the rise and fall of a sports dynasty, in
  all its glory and grubbiness. But also: can we have more of this, please?
  Imagine a Netflix epic on Manchester United that had Sir Alex Ferguson
  unloading on every topic under the sun, Rio Ferdinand on his missed drugs
  test, and the Glazers taking you into the heart of their takeover. This is, in
  essence, the NFL equivalent. Early in the documentary, we see old footage of
  the former Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson shouting at one of his players after he
  collapses during a running test. “You’re on the wrong field to have asthma,”
  Johnson tells him, before promptly cutting him. After a defeat by Washington,
  Johnson refuses to let his players eat on their flight home. “Jimmy was a
  complete asshole,” one player says. But this tough love, combined with
  drafting a team of future superstars, turned the Cowboys into back-to-back
  Super Bowl winners. But then Johnson left after feuding with Jerry Jones, the
  Cowboys’ owner and general manager, over who deserved the most credit for the
  team’s success and the two have been fighting over their legacy almost ever
  since. That dispute lies at the heart of the Gambler and his Cowboys. But it
  still finds fresh ways to reopen old wounds. Jones, for instance, reveals for
  the first time that he had cancer – a stage four melanoma that required
  multiple surgeries. But rather than dwell on his mortality, he then tells the
  story of how his doctor told him to make a list of 10 people who made his
  blood boil and to wish them success while meditating. “Number one, I wrote
  down the name Jimmy Johnson,” Jones says. “But then I went back to my doctor:
  ‘I can’t get past that first motherfucker.’” While the two men reconcile
  eventually, it is refreshing to hear such honesty, especially as so many
  sports documentaries are compromised. We all know there is usually a price to
  pay for access. Questions unasked. Thorny topics skirted over. But in a world
  where most documentaries feel as airbrushed as a Vogue cover shoot, the
  Gambler and his Cowboys bucks the trend. So why is that? Why were these people
  willing to unburden their souls and tell stories we haven’t heard before? Part
  of that is the skill of the documentary makers. They ask the tough questions.
  And they are so diligent they even get the prosecutor and judge in the case
  that led to Irvin being fined $10,000 for cocaine possession to talk about it.
  Want to know what it is like to be concussed? Well, the Cowboys quarterback
  Troy Aikman explains the sensation better than anyone I have ever heard. At
  one point he also talks about blood coming from his ear. In another, he admits
  not remembering playing in an NFC Championship game. “I watched the game the
  next day and I played well,” he says. That is a skill, too. Maybe part of it
  is also an age and generation thing. Johnson and Jones are 82. They won’t be
  around for that much longer. The players also come from a time when media
  training wasn’t designed to strangle their personalities. It was also just a
  very different era. The Hall of Fame star Charles Haley, for instance, joined
  Dallas from the San Francisco 49ers after reportedly walking into the 49ers
  general manager’s office, pulling out his penis, urinating on his desk and
  said: “This is how bad I want out of here.” Players don’t do things like that
  any more. Wouldn’t it be great if we were able to watch something as
  unvarnished and raw about some of the great British teams? The Liverpool side
  of the 70s and 80s, perhaps, as well as United in the 90s? There is surely a
  great documentary also on the rise and fall of England’s Rugby World Cup
  winners, including the horrific concussion stories and the tabloid tales of
  dwarf-throwing contests? Certainly the Cowboy and his Gamblers lays down the
  template. Towards the end of it, Irvin talks about being left temporarily
  paralysed after hitting his neck on the ground and calling his wife from the
  ambulance to tell her. It leads to him having to retire. Yet he also admits
  that such was his bond with his teammates that, if Cowboys were still in their
  prime, he would have risked coming back. “We are all imperfect people,” Irvin
  says, with a sagacity of someone who has been there and done it all. “And each
  of us has at least two of us in all of us. That person you show everybody. And
  that person that you never show anybody.” The trick this documentary pulls off
  is to reveal those deeper truths.
