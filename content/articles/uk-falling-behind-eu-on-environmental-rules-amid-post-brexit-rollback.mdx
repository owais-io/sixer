  The UK is using Brexit to weaken crucial environmental protections and is
  falling behind the EU despite Labour’s manifesto pledge not to dilute
  standards, analysis has found. Experts have said ministers are choosing to use
  Brexit to “actively go backwards” in some cases, though there are also areas
  where the UK has improved nature laws such as by banning sand eel fishing.
  Despite having promised a “reset” with the EU, Keir Starmer’s government has
  failed to even start closing loopholes in environmental law that have widened
  since Brexit, and is in some cases choosing to delete EU environmental rules
  from the statute book. Analysis by the Guardian and the Institute for European
  Environmental Policy (IEEP) has found the UK is falling behind the EU in terms
  of protecting rare creatures such as red squirrels, cleaning up the air and
  water, removing dangerous chemicals from products, and making consumer
  products more recyclable and energy efficient. Since Brexit, the analysis has
  found the EU has brought forward 28 new, revised or upgraded pieces of
  environmental legislation that the UK has not adopted, and the UK has actively
  chosen to regress by changing four different pieces of legislation including
  on protected habitats, pesticides and fisheries. Areas of concern include: The
  planning and infrastructure bill, which overrides the EU’s habitats directive
  and allows developers to pay into a general nature fund rather than keeping or
  creating new habitat nearby to make up for what is destroyed. The UK falling
  behind on water policy, with the EU implementing stronger legislation to clean
  rivers of chemicals and microplastics and making polluters pay to clean up.
  Air pollution, as the EU is legislating to clean up the air while the UK has
  removed EU air pollution laws from the statute book. Recycling and the
  circular economy, as the EU enforces strict new standards for designer goods
  that could leave the UK as a “dumping ground” for substandard, hard-to-recycle
  products. Last year, the Guardian and IEEP found 17 environmental areas in
  which the UK was falling behind the EU. As the government fails to keep up
  with EU environmental legislation, the chasm has widened to 28. There are a
  couple of “bright spots” identified by IEEP in which the UK has begun to
  improve its environmental protections compared with the EU, including the ban
  on sand eel fishing that could stop puffins from starving. The UK has also
  designated more marine protected areas than the EU, and is making farming
  payments contingent on protecting areas for nature. However, these are
  outweighed by the lack of regulation around some of the most important
  environmental areas, experts said. Of most concern is the decision of the UK
  government to overrule the EU-derived habitats regulations that protect the
  habitats of rare creatures including dormice, red squirrels and nightingales.
  The Office for Environmental Protection has warned that the planning and
  infrastructure bill, which contains the legislation that would overrule the
  habitats regulations, is a “regression” of environmental law. The OEP is the
  watchdog set up after Brexit to replace EU oversight of the implementation of
  environmental regulations in the UK. However, although Labour promised in its
  2024 manifesto to “unlock the building of homes … without weakening
  environmental protections”, the government has ignored its recommendations.
  Michael Nicholson, the head of UK environmental policy at IEEP, said: “It is
  one thing deciding not to keep pace with the EU in actively strengthening our
  environmental laws but quite another to actively go backwards and remove
  environmental protections that we inherited from our EU membership.” The EU
  has also been rolling back some of its planned environmental legislation, as
  politicians globally deprioritise environment and climate action. In the first
  six months of the new European Commission mandate, the EU delayed a law to
  stop deforestation in supply chains by one year, gave carmakers two extra
  years to meet pollution targets and downgraded the protection status of
  wolves. Environmental NGOs have found themselves in the crosshairs of a
  funding freeze they argue undermines democracy. After farmers’ protests swept
  across Europe last year, lawmakers and member states nearly killed off a
  nature restoration law that EU institutions had already negotiated. Nicholson
  added: “Five years on from Brexit, we can now see that the UK has chosen not
  to keep pace with the EU in strengthening its environmental laws and policies.
  “The EU is no nirvana for environmental protection, but the UK is falling
  behind and should be looking to use its post-Brexit independent policymaking
  powers to go above and beyond what the EU is doing. Sadly, it is losing this
  race to the top and has ceded leadership to the EU.” In some areas, Northern
  Ireland has had to implement EU laws under the Windsor framework that keeps
  the border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member state, soft. These
  include the urban wastewater treatment directive, chemicals regulation and
  pesticide rules. Before the UK left the EU, politicians including the former
  environment secretary Michael Gove promised the UK would be “world leading” on
  the environment, using its newfound freedom to strengthen its regulations.
  However, the opposite has happened in most cases. Richard Benwell, the chief
  executive of Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: “The UK shouldn’t just match
  the EU on environmental standards, it should lead. In many areas where the UK
  is falling behind – like banning toxic chemicals – aligning with the EU would
  save time, money and wildlife. In other areas, the government could put a bold
  UK slant on an EU idea. The polluter pays plans in the urban wastewater
  treatment directive should go economy-wide. Where we’re leading, like
  nature-friendly farming and banning bottom-trawling, the Department for
  Environment, Food and Rural Affairs should have Starmer’s backing to be
  braver, to turn the tentative steps forward into a confident plan for a
  nature-positive economy.” The Green MP Ellie Chowns said: “The Green party
  warned that Brexit could see the UK reduce regulations in a race to the
  bottom. Unfortunately, the election of a Labour government a year ago hasn’t
  prevented that happening. “Of course, it doesn’t have to be like this. We
  could have clean rivers, breathable air, farmers encouraged to work with
  nature and consumer products designed to last and be recycled. We could work
  more closely with our EU neighbours and join the customs union to better align
  our regulations upwards. And that is what it boils down to – a political
  choice. The government has made the wrong choices and needs to change
  direction.” A Defra spokesperson said: “We’re rebuilding the water network
  with a record £104bn investment to halve sewage spills by 2030, banning
  bee-killing pesticides, banning single-use vapes, creating the first National
  Forest in 30 years, releasing the first wild beavers in centuries, investing
  billions into nature friendly farming, and we will continue to deliver
  win-wins for the environment and development through our new Nature
  Restoration Fund.”
