  Right, here’s your report from the Hungarian GP via Giles Richards. One of the
  most eye-catching and dramatic races of the season, without a doubt. That
  concludes this live blog/lap-by-lap report. It’s been a pleasure as always to
  bring it to you. Byesie bye. It’s hardly worth running through the
  constructors’ standings given McLaren’s monopoly this season. But if you’re
  wondering, Zak Brown’s team have now amassed 559 points. Their next nearest
  challengers, Ferrari, have 260 points, with Mercedes third on 236. Here’s the
  bottom half of today’s race standings, for what it’s worth. 11. Isack Hadjar
  12. Lewis Hamilton 13. Nico Hulkenberg 14. Carlos Sainz 15. Alex Albon 16.
  Esteban Ocon 17. Yuki Tsunoda 18. Franco Colapinto 19. Pierre Gasly DNF. Ollie
  Bearman The celebrations have begun in earnest now for Norris and McLaren.
  Another superb weekend for them. A reminder that the drivers and teams will
  take a break until the final few days of August now. Things get back under way
  with the Dutch Grand Prix in Zandvoort on the weekend of 29 to 31 August.
  September sees things roll on to Monza and Baku before we go globetrotting
  once more. And finally, here’s Russell who grabbed P3: “Really happy with the
  race today. The whole weekend’s been a bit surprisingly for everyone. Just
  glad to get through it and a nice way to go to the break.” Here’s Piastri. “I
  pushed as hard as I could. After I saw Lando going for a one [stop strategy] I
  knew I’d have to overtake, which is easier said than done around here. Looking
  forward to a couple of weeks off.” Norris talks after the race: “I’m dead. It
  was tough. We weren’t planning on the one-stop at the beginning but it was our
  only real option to get back into things. My voice has gone a bit, but good,
  rewarding, the perfect result today. “I didn’t think [the one-stop strategy]
  would get us the win. But the pace was strong if I had some clean air and I
  could push. It’s always a gamble but it also requires no mistakes and good
  laps. “We’re so tightly fought so it’s hard to say whether momentum is on
  either side. It’s fun racing with Oscar, he put up a good charge. I look
  forward to plenty more of these.” Oscar Piastri – 284 points Lando Norris –
  275 Max Verstappen – 187 George Russell – 172 Charles Leclerc – 151 Lewis
  Hamilton – 109 Kimi Antonelli – 64 Alexander Albon – 54 Nico Hulkenberg – 37
  Esteban Ocon – 27 That’s a career-best grand prix finish for Gabriel Bortoleto
  in sixth, while Liam Lawson – the driver discarded by Red Bull earlier in the
  season – finishes ahead of his former teammate Max Verstappen. Outside the
  points was Lewis Hamilton… a pretty wretched weekend in Hungary, where he’s
  previously been so successful, for the seven-time world champion. 1. Lando
  Norris 2. Oscar Piastri 3. George Russell 4. Charles Leclerc 5. Fernando
  Alonso 6. Gabriel Bortoleto 7. Lance Stroll 8. Liam Lawson 9. Max Verstappen
  10. Kimi Antonelli What a finish. The two McLarens tussling with each other,
  both knowing this would have major ramifications for the destination of the
  world title. But it’s Norris who triumphs in the end, with his one-stop policy
  paying off for McLaren. Frustration for his teammate Piastri who just couldn’t
  quite pull off the overtake at the death. FINAL LAP! This is very, very
  watchable stuff. Norris continues to cover off the relentless attacks from
  Piastri. Lap 69/70: Another close call! A lockup from Piastri allows Norris to
  wriggle free once more. He couldn’t have got any closer there. The crowd stand
  to crane their necks and get a vantage point of the skirmish between the two
  orange cars. Piastri is getting closer and closer. Can he execute the decisive
  move? Lap 67/70: The traffic is now clear so it’s a direct dogfight between
  one McLaren and the other as this race draws to a climax. Piastri cannot get
  past Norris around the tight corners. Less than a second now. DRS in play?
  Remember that Piastri currently leads Norris by nine points in the current
  world championship standings. The blue flags are out and the cars in front of
  Norris have been advised to get out of the way. A minute ago, the Briton was
  fuming that the “traffic is going to ruin my race” on the McLaren radio. Lap
  65/70: Piastri cuts the gap to Norris to 1.2 seconds. It’s all coming to a
  head. Russell still isn’t happy – he doesn’t need to be now – but Leclerc is
  clearly pretty downtrodden himself. It’s all fallen apart for the man who
  started the race on pole and who led for much of it. Lap 62/70: “Clearly not
  allowed,” says an agitated Russell about a blocking move by Leclerc… although
  he eventually overtakes him. A podium spot awaits the Mercedes. McLaren’s Zak
  Brown is chatting to Sky Sports during the race. “Go for it boys,” he says,
  gleefully to his two drivers. “The team have done a great job after a
  difficult first lap with two different strategies. Think they’re going to
  converge in a couple of laps.” Into the final 10 laps. Brace yourselves,
  people. Is this end for Hamilton? Chris Chapman, emailing in, thinks so.
  Perhaps Lewis should do what world champions have done in the past and go off
  to race in other series, eg Indycar, for a year or so to get his mojo back. At
  his age he could also do with a family for support/focus. Lap 58/70: Russell
  is all over the back of Leclerc’s car, with the Ferrari losing speed at an
  alarming rate now. Seems only a matter of time before the Briton clambers into
  third position. In terms of the rest of the field Alonso has a nice cushion in
  fifth, with the likes of Bortoleto (P6), Stroll (P7) and Lawson (P8) all in
  line for points. Verstappen remains ninth and Hamilton (P12) outside the
  points positions. Hulkenberg (P16) and Tsunoda (P18) are under investigation
  after a close call between the pair. Lap 56/70: Both men have just clocked
  their fastest laps of the race. Leclerc finds himself now clinging on for the
  final spot on the podium, but Russell is closing the gap in terms of time.
  It’s down to less than two seconds. The inter-team politics at McLaren now
  become fascinating, with this race suddenly an almighty scrap between world
  championship contenders Norris and Piastri. Where’s your money? One team, two
  different strategies, two drivers desperate for the win. It doesn’t get much
  better than this. Lap 54/70: Norris still has six seconds on Piastri, of
  course having made one stop fewer than his teammate. Leclerc has been left in
  the McLarens’ wake all of a sudden, losing speed, with nearly five seconds
  between he and second placed Piastri. Lap 52/70: So now it’s about whether
  Norris’ tyres will hold out and last the distance and whether Piastri’s
  fresher tyres will allow him to close the gap and overtake. We’ve lost Ollie
  Bearman, by the way, he’s been forced to retire. Piastri overtakes Leclerc!
  That was a brilliantly smart move from the Australian on the straight, such
  speed out of nowhere really. Is that going to bring victory for McLaren in
  Hungary? Lap 49/70: Verstappen continues to battle, but a place on the podium
  seems well beyond the Dutchman this afternoon. He’s ninth with a whole load of
  traffic – and cars with far more speed – in front of him. Lap 47/70: Norris
  now leads the race and has some of the back markers in his sights. Hmm, now
  they could slow him down. Lap 45/70: Piastri now dives in. Yep, he was never
  keen to remain out there on harder tyres, perhaps fearful that Norris could
  eventually catch and overtake him. That battle between the two McLarens for
  the world title provides an intriguing subtext to this grand prix. Now it’s
  Russell’s turn to pit. Hamilton’s pit stop has left him down in P16. McLaren
  currently have a one-two but how long that lasts, we’ll see. Lap 42/70: Red
  Bull are telling Verstappen they’re considering leaving him out on the track,
  so no two-stop for him. It seems a few teams are mulling over a similar
  policy. Leclerc has dipped in for his second stop of the race. Piastri isn’t
  going anywhere yet though, with the Ferrari coming back P4. Lap 40/70: Norris
  has just clocked the fastest lap of the afternoon, having pitted more recently
  than any of the other frontrunners. Can he build up a head of steam now?
  Alonso has gone into the pit lane. Lap 38/70: The gap between Leclerc and
  Piastri in first and second is still hovering around the two-second mark. I
  simply don’t see how the McLaren can cut that deficit as things stand. The
  stewards are investigating the tete-a-tete between Hamilton and Verstappen, by
  the way. Lap 35/70: McLaren are now asking Piastri if he can get to the end on
  his current tyres and the Aussie driver doesn’t sound keen on the idea. Track
  position may be far more important than the freshness of tyres today. We’re
  almost at the halfway stage of this race. It’s Leclerc from Piastri then
  Russell in third, with Norris fourth and Alonso fifth. Lap 31/70: Norris heads
  into the pit lane. This will likely be his only pit of the race as he emerges
  with harder tyres… and he’s comfortably into P4, miles in front of Alonso. A
  podium finish could still be within reach. There’s lots of Lewis chat in my
  email inbox. Muz says: “When Hamilton said ‘every time, every time’ I took
  that to mean he keeps telling his team what is wrong with his car and they are
  simply not listening to him. His notes to his team are his way of
  communicating, but they cannot give him what he needs, which is why he is
  hoping he can be released from his commitment to them.” Are you Team Lewis, or
  otherwise? Lap 30/70: Verstappen zips beyond Hamilton at close quarters, with
  the Ferrari forced wide and momentarily off the track, perhaps anticipating
  contact. Charles Leclerc is sounding vexed on his own team radio. “We’re going
  to lose the race with these things,” he says… although it’s not clear what
  exactly the problem is. The Monegasque has seemed pretty rapid from where I’m
  sitting. Lap 28/70: McLaren have told Norris they’re considering a one-stop
  policy. “Yeah why not” says the Brit. He doesn’t have much choice really.
  Hamilton is the next challenge for Verstappen to overtake and says he’s a “bit
  of a sitting duck”. Pray for Lewis. Lap 25/70: Max Verstappen has come out of
  the pit lane in P12 and sounds completely baffled with Red Bull re “this
  really terrible idea… coming out into traffic”. After some good work earlier
  in the race, he’s got another big fight on his hands. Lap 24/70: Now most of
  the leaders have pitted, here’s a rundown of the standings, a third of the way
  into this race: Norris (hasn’t pitted) Leclerc Piastri Alonso Russell
  Bortoleto Stroll Lawson Bearman Hadjar Lap 22/70: “This Ferrari pace looks
  real and like he can endure that,” is the analysis from Sky’s Martin Brundle
  and on this evidence it’s hard to disagree with him. Still early days, but
  Leclerc looks to have this race at his mercy. Some thoughts on Lewis Hamilton
  from Bill Taylor on email: Something ‘not quite right’ with Hamilton? Yeah,
  his attitude. It needs an upgrade. He (in common with Verstappen) has always
  been a complainer. Fair enough, if that’s what gets you through a race. And,
  clearly, it’s something that has worked for both of them. But Hamilton has
  turned into a whiner. It’s not an attractive look and, equally clearly,
  doesn’t work for him. Or Ferrari. They’d have been better off keeping Sainz in
  the team. Those are Bill’s thoughts, not mine… Lap 20/70: Leclerc and Ferrari
  have executed a good pit stop, too, returning in P3 so still ahead of Piastri.
  Norris and Alonso now lead this race, though neither have had the chance to
  get fresh tyres. Leclerc is getting to grips with his new harder tyres – could
  this be the opportunity Piastri was waiting for? The Ferrari man has gone past
  Alonso into second. “My tyres are gone,” says Norris now but it’s Piastri
  who’s coming into the pit lane first. And he returns with harder tyres, in
  fifth. Very interesting. Lap 17/70: Norris has more pace than Russell but
  simply cannot find a way past him at the moment. There’s a bit of a
  contretemps between Lando and the McLaren team on the radio. A frustrating
  race for him so far. Carlos Sainz’s soft tyres only took him to lap 16, so
  he’s gone into the pit lane. How long before those on the mediums decide to
  box? Lap 14/70: Leclerc now has himself a three-second lead at the front. The
  Ferrari – well, his Ferrari anyway – is fast this weekend! As for Hamilton?
  We’ll somehow he’s still down in P14. Something’s not quite right with the
  legendary Briton. Lap 11/70: So, Hulkenberg has indeed been hit with a
  five-second time penalty for moving before the start. He’s now dead last.
  “What’s going on with these cuts?” asks a bemused Leclerc on the Ferrari team
  radio. Is his engine cutting out intermittently? “We need to get past
  Russell,” is the message Norris is receiving from his team. YES I KNOW GUYS.
  Lap 10/70: Norris has picked up some super speed and finds himself within DRS
  pouncing distance of fellow countryman Russell. He won’t stop pushing. That
  didn’t last long … Lap 8/70: It seems Norris is under instructions to get past
  George Russell, which would put both McLarens in second and third behind
  Leclerc. The Ferrari still leads this and looks comfortable in doing so. The
  Saubers of Nico Hulkenberg and Gabriel Bortoleto are both under investigation
  for possible false starts. Could be some time penalties being dished out.
  We’ll keep an eye on those situations. Lap 5/70: Gabriel Bortoleto is having
  himself a decent weekend, sitting sixth at the moment and pushing Alonso for
  fifth. Meanwhile, Verstappen has charged up the field to seventh and seems to
  have found some grip. An email has dropped from Andy Flintoff (not that one):
  “Hi Dominic, I’ve got you and the cricket in two tabs in my browser, and I
  read your entry at 13.53 and it wasn’t until it got to the word ‘overtaking’
  that I realised it wasn’t the Test match that you were writing about. For a
  split second I wondered how wind affects cricket’s DRS.” I’ll level with you,
  Andy, I’m more aux fait with cricket’s DRS than Formula One’s. Lap 3/70:
  Pretty much everyone is on the medium compound tyres, with Hamilton – who is
  on the harder tyres – dropping down to P14. Norris has regained third from
  Alonso with a slick move. Better from the Brit. Lap 2/70: So it’s Leclerc,
  Piastri, Russell and then Alonso after the first lap. Russell is pushing
  really hard to try and put Piastri under pressure. There’s all sorts going on
  as we head into the first turn but Leclerc has the speed off the start to stay
  well in front. Fernando Alonso has gained a place on Lando Norris after the
  McLaren man opted to duck inside and try to make a move of his own. … and away
  we goooooo. Who’s taking the win in Hungary? Let’s see. Formation lap time.
  Get some heat in those tyres. The weather forecasters say there’s a bit of
  rain on the way. There’s a breeze around, too, which could help the use of DRS
  and mean more overtaking. Could be something for everybody today, especially
  with a Ferrari on pole and the big beasts of McLaren and Mercedes lurking just
  behind. Can Piastri or Norris jump ahead of Leclerc on turn one? We’ll find
  out soon. Before lights out here’s a reminder of our other live offerings on a
  busy Sunday afternoon of sport. George Russell is sporting shades and riding a
  scooter as he chats to Sky Sports. “We’ve got to keep our eyes on Charles and
  hopefully we can do something to sneak in there.” Right, the drivers, cars and
  all manner of other things are out on the track. Not long til we’re under way.
  The red, white and green Hungarian flags are out in force. A bit more from Zak
  Brown here, this time speaking to Sky Sports about the world championship
  battle between his two McLarens Oscar Pisatri and Lando Norris: “We enjoy it,
  we’re racers, so to see them battle it out like we’ve seen now in a handful of
  races is exciting for us. “We’re not doing anything differently, we don’t feel
  any tension rising. We know obviously there’s a lot at stake but it’s all very
  positive and we’re enjoying it. “We’re not intimated or concerned, we know
  it’s going to be tough. But we’ve got a great relationship with both drivers,
  very open and transparent, so I see no reason why they can’t have an epic
  fight to the finish. May the best driver win.” Here’s another plug for you.
  McLaren chief Zak Brown claims Formula One is enjoying a “healthier”
  atmosphere following the exit of Christian Horner from Red Bull and accused
  his former rival principal of “crossing the line”. There’s always going to be
  some political aspects to the sport, but I think it is going to be healthier
  with Laurent [Mekies, the new Red Bull team principal]. I’m a fan of Laurent,
  I have known him for a long time, and it’ll be good to go racing against him.
  This was a timely piece from our man Giles Richards out in Budapest. Lewis
  Hamilton is struggling for success with Ferrari, but appreciates that he must
  do more than drive for the famous Scuderia. It’s worth reminding you how they
  will start on the grid in Hungary this afternoon. Don’t forget the race starts
  at 2pm (UK time). Charles Leclerc Oscar Piastri Lando Norris George Russell
  Fernando Alonso Lance Stroll Gabriel Bortoleto Max Verstappen Liam Lawson
  Isack Hadjar Outside the top 10, the main headline is that Hamilton qualified
  down in P12 while Red Bull’s Yuki Tsunoda will start in the pit lane with his
  engineers deciding to make a few changes to the car pre-race. Hello and
  welcome to coverage of the Formula One Hungarian Grand Prix. Charles Leclerc
  starts on pole this afternoon for the first time this season after stunning
  McLaren duo Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris in qualifying yesterday. Meanwhile,
  it was a Saturday to forget for Lewis Hamilton, who berated his own
  performance after finishing 12th fastest. The seven-time world champion said:
  “It’s me every time. I’m useless, absolutely useless. The team have no
  problem. You’ve seen the car’s on pole. So we probably need to change driver.”
  Hamilton has been hugely successful at the Hungaroring over the years,
  recording eight wins. He will be hoping to bounce back with another big result
  this afternoon. Lights out is set for 2pm BST - join us!

I simply don’t see how the McLaren can cut that deficit as things stand. The stewards are investigating the tete-a-tete between Hamilton and Verstappen, by the way.

It’s Leclerc from Piastri then Russell in third, with Norris fourth and Alonso fifth. Lap 31/70: Norris heads into the pit lane.

Lap 24/70: Now most of the leaders have pitted, here’s a rundown of the standings, a third of the way into this race: Norris (hasn’t pitted) Leclerc Piastri Alonso Russell Bortoleto Stroll Lawson Bearman Hadjar Lap 22/70: “This Ferrari pace looks real and like he can endure that,” is the analysis from Sky’s Martin Brundle and on this evidence it’s hard to disagree with him. Still early days, but Leclerc looks to have this race at his mercy. Some thoughts on Lewis Hamilton from Bill Taylor on email: Something ‘not quite right’ with Hamilton? Yeah, his attitude. It needs an upgrade. He (in common with Verstappen) has always been a complainer. Fair enough, if that’s what gets you through a race. And, clearly, it’s something that has worked for both of them. But Hamilton has turned into a whiner. It’s not an attractive look and, equally clearly, doesn’t work for him. Or Ferrari. They’d have been better off keeping Sainz in the team. Those are Bill’s thoughts, not mine… Lap 20/70: Leclerc and Ferrari have executed a good pit stop, too, returning in P3 so still ahead of Piastri. Norris and Alonso now lead this race, though neither have had the chance to get fresh tyres. Leclerc is getting to grips with his new harder tyres – could this be the opportunity Piastri was waiting for? The Ferrari man has gone past Alonso into second. “My tyres are gone,” says Norris now but it’s Piastri who’s coming into the pit lane first. And he returns with harder tyres, in fifth. Very interesting. Lap 17/70: Norris has more pace than Russell but simply cannot find a way past him at the moment. There’s a bit of a contretemps between Lando and the McLaren team on the radio. A frustrating race for him so far. Carlos Sainz’s soft tyres only took him to lap 16, so he’s gone into the pit lane. How long before those on the mediums decide to box? Lap 14/70: Leclerc now has himself a three-second lead at the front. The Ferrari – well, his Ferrari anyway – is fast this weekend! As for Hamilton? We’ll somehow he’s still down in P14. Something’s not quite right with the legendary Briton. Lap 11/70: So, Hulkenberg has indeed been hit with a five-second time penalty for moving before the start. He’s now dead last. “What’s going on with these cuts?” asks a bemused Leclerc on the Ferrari team radio. Is his engine cutting out intermittently? “We need to get past Russell,” is the message Norris is receiving from his team. YES I KNOW GUYS. Lap 10/70: Norris has picked up some super speed and finds himself within DRS pouncing distance of fellow countryman Russell. He won’t stop pushing. That didn’t last long … Lap 8/70: It seems Norris is under instructions to get past George Russell, which would put both McLarens in second and third behind Leclerc. The Ferrari still leads this and looks comfortable in doing so. The Saubers of Nico Hulkenberg and Gabriel Bortoleto are both under investigation for possible false starts. Could be some time penalties being dished out. We’ll keep an eye on those situations. Lap 5/70: Gabriel Bortoleto is having himself a decent weekend, sitting sixth at the moment and pushing Alonso for fifth. Meanwhile, Verstappen has charged up the field to seventh and seems to have found some grip. An email has dropped from Andy Flintoff (not that one): “Hi Dominic, I’ve got you and the cricket in two tabs in my browser, and I read your entry at 13.53 and it wasn’t until it got to the word ‘overtaking’ that I realised it wasn’t the Test match that you were writing about. For a split second I wondered how wind affects cricket’s DRS.” I’ll level with you, Andy, I’m more aux fait with cricket’s DRS than Formula One’s. Lap 3/70: Pretty much everyone is on the medium compound tyres, with Hamilton – who is on the harder tyres – dropping down to P14. Norris has regained third from Alonso with a slick move. Better from the Brit. Lap 2/70: So it’s Leclerc, Piastri, Russell and then Alonso after the first lap. Russell is pushing really hard to try and put Piastri under pressure. There’s all sorts going on as we head into the first turn but Leclerc has the speed off the start to stay well in front. Fernando Alonso has gained a place on Lando Norris after the McLaren man opted to duck inside and try to make a move of his own. … and away we goooooo. Who’s taking the win in Hungary? Let’s see. Formation lap time. Get some heat in those tyres. The weather forecasters say there’s a bit of rain on the way. There’s a breeze around, too, which could help the use of DRS and mean more overtaking. Could be something for everybody today, especially with a Ferrari on pole and the big beasts of McLaren and Mercedes lurking just behind. Can Piastri or Norris jump ahead of Leclerc on turn one? We’ll find out soon. Before lights out here’s a reminder of our other live offerings on a busy Sunday afternoon of sport. George Russell is sporting shades and riding a scooter as he chats to Sky Sports. “We’ve got to keep our eyes on Charles and hopefully we can do something to sneak in there.” Right, the drivers, cars and all manner of other things are out on the track. Not long til we’re under way. The red, white and green Hungarian flags are out in force. A bit more from Zak Brown here, this time speaking to Sky Sports about the world championship battle between his two McLarens Oscar Pisatri and Lando Norris: “We enjoy it, we’re racers, so to see them battle it out like we’ve seen now in a handful of races is exciting for us. “We’re not doing anything differently, we don’t feel any tension rising. We know obviously there’s a lot at stake but it’s all very positive and we’re enjoying it. “We’re not intimated or concerned, we know it’s going to be tough. But we’ve got a great relationship with both drivers, very open and transparent, so I see no reason why they can’t have an epic fight to the finish. May the best driver win.” Here’s another plug for you. McLaren chief Zak Brown claims Formula One is enjoying a “healthier” atmosphere following the exit of Christian Horner from Red Bull and accused his former rival principal of “crossing the line”. There’s always going to be some political aspects to the sport, but I think it is going to be healthier with Laurent [Mekies, the new Red Bull team principal]. I’m a fan of Laurent, I have known him for a long time, and it’ll be good to go racing against him. This was a timely piece from our man Giles Richards out in Budapest. Lewis Hamilton is struggling for success with Ferrari, but appreciates that he must do more than drive for the famous Scuderia. It’s worth reminding you how they will start on the grid in Hungary this afternoon. Don’t forget the race starts at 2pm (UK time). Charles Leclerc Oscar Piastri Lando Norris George Russell Fernando Alonso Lance Stroll Gabriel Bortoleto Max Verstappen Liam Lawson Isack Hadjar Outside the top 10, the main headline is that Hamilton qualified down in P12 while Red Bull’s Yuki Tsunoda will start in the pit lane with his engineers deciding to make a few changes to the car pre-race. Hello and welcome to coverage of the Formula One Hungarian Grand Prix. Charles Leclerc starts on pole this afternoon for the first time this season after stunning McLaren duo Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris in qualifying yesterday. Meanwhile, it was a Saturday to forget for Lewis Hamilton, who berated his own performance after finishing 12th fastest. The seven-time world champion said: “It’s me every time. I’m useless, absolutely useless. The team have no problem. You’ve seen the car’s on pole. So we probably need to change driver.” Hamilton has been hugely successful at the Hungaroring over the years, recording eight wins. He will be hoping to bounce back with another big result this afternoon. Lights out is set for 2pm BST - join us!
