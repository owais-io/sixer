  Sardines are one of our most underrated fish, even though UK stocks are
  healthy and the fishery in Cornwall is certified sustainable. They are caught
  by seine netting at dusk just a few miles from shore, and the way they are
  fished means they’re in perfect condition when landed. My favourite way of
  eating them is left whole, guts in and heads on, topped with a healthy
  sprinkling of coarse salt and then grilled – they’re wonderful eaten just with
  your hands or on bread, but today I offer up two alternatives ways with
  sardines. Venetian-style pickled sardines (pictured top) You will see these
  delicious cicchetti, or snack, in bars all over Venice, where they sit piled
  high on the counter, ready to be served with a glass of wine or on top of a
  slice of bread. They make a great starter or light supper, and it’s a very
  good way to preserve the fresh fish for a few days, because the flavour gets
  only better with time. I’ve added a few crushed pink peppercorns to the
  traditional recipe, because I think they add a nice touch. Prep 10 min Cook 15
  min Marinate 1 hr+ Serves 2 as a starter Good olive oil 8 fresh sardines,
  cleaned and gutted (heads and tails on or off – it’s up to you) Plain flour,
  for dusting 100ml white-wine vinegar 2 tbsp caster sugar 1 white onion, peeled
  and finely sliced 1 tbsp sultanas 1 tsp pink peppercorns, finely crushed or
  blitzed 1 tbsp chopped flat-leaf parsley Heat 100ml olive oil in a large, wide
  frying pan. Working in batches, if need be, dip the sardines in the flour,
  shake off any excess, then fry gently for two to three minutes on each side,
  until cooked through. Lift out the fish, drain on kitchen paper, then arrange
  them side by side in a shallow rectangular dish in which they’ll all fit
  snugly. Mix the vinegar, sugar, four tablespoons of olive oil and 100ml cold
  water in a small pan, and bring to a simmer. Drop in the finely sliced onion,
  cook for about five minutes, until the onion is soft and giving, then stir in
  the sultanas and crushed pink peppercorns. Spoon the pickle mix evenly all
  over the sardines, finish with a sprinkling of parsley, then cover and put in
  the fridge to marinate for at least an hour and up to three or four days.
  Serve at room temperature with bread and/or a nice glass of vino. Sardine
  butter on sourdough with pickled mustard seeds and cucumber I love tinned
  sardines almost as much as I love fresh ones – they are so versatile and so
  delicious. When I was a kid, we used to have Shippam’s sardine paste
  sandwiches with cucumber, and this is my take on that delightful childhood
  food memory. Prep 5 min Cook 15 min Chill 1 hr+ 120g tin sardines in olive
  oil, drained 1 tbsp tomato puree 1 pinch dried chilli flakes, to taste Sea
  salt 125g softened butter 1 pinch dried oregano Sliced sourdough, to serve
  Juice of ¼ lemon For the pickle 50g white-wine vinegar 2 tbsp caster sugar 1
  tbsp mustard seeds ¼ cucumber, peeled, cored and finely diced 1 tbsp chopped
  fresh dill Put the sardines, tomato puree, chilli and a pinch of salt in a
  blender, blitz until really smooth, then add the butter and oregano, and blitz
  again until well combined. Decant the sardine butter into a clean pot or jar,
  cover, then chill for at least an hour. The butter will now keep for up to a
  week. To make the pickle, put the vinegar, sugar and 100ml cold water in a
  small saucepan, bring to a simmer, then add the mustard seeds and leave to
  cook gently for 10 minutes, until they soften and plump up a bit. Take off the
  heat and leave to cool. Meanwhile, mix the diced cucumber with a big pinch of
  salt, then set aside for five minutes to draw out some of the excess moisture.
  Rinse off the salt, dry the cucumber well and stir into the cooled pickle mix
  along with the chopped dill. Grill the sourdough until it’s nicely charred on
  both sides, then, while it’s still hot, spread thickly with the sardine butter
  so it melts through the bread. Serve at once with a squeeze of lemon juice to
  taste and with the pickle on the side or strewn on top; a handful of rocket
  leaves would go nicely here, too. Mitch Tonks is chef/owner of the Rockfish
  restaurants in south-west England The Guardian aims to publish recipes for
  sustainable fish. Check ratings in your region: UK; Australia; US. * This
  article was edited on 19 August 2025, to clarify the serving suggestion, and
  that the chopped dill should be added to the pickle mix at the same time as
  the cucumber.
