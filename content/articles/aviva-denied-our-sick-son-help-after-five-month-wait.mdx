  Our 16-year-old son has an incurable degenerative disease and now needs
  round-the-clock care. My husband has had to give up work to look after him but
  Aviva is refusing to pay out under our critical illness policy. We’ve been
  paying £60 a month for the cover since 2007. Our son was born in 2008 and
  diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress (SMA-RD) when
  he was eight. He managed well in mainstream school until June last year, since
  when his health has deteriorated significantly and he has paralysis in all
  four limbs. We contacted Aviva in January to discuss our eligibility for a
  claim. We were transferred between three departments and waited more than
  three-and-a-half hours. An adviser repeatedly stated that he did not meet the
  criteria, but would not tell us what the criteria were. We twice requested
  copies of our policy documents, but they were never received. We raised a
  formal complaint about their communications in February and our consultant
  submitted medical reports. In late June, our claim was denied. Its argument is
  that SMA-RD is a genetic condition that would have been present at birth,
  while his cover on our policy only started on his first birthday. I suppose
  that is why Aviva has reported £1bn operating profit in the first half of this
  year. NL, Belfast Insurers look upon human suffering through the lens of terms
  and conditions, and cold hard cash. It has to be this way – they are
  businesses. But commerce does not preclude compassion and this was shamefully
  lacking in Aviva’s dealings with you. Despite the urgency of your
  circumstances, it took five months to reach a decision. The email trail you
  sent me shows your repeated pleadings for updates. Your critical illness
  policy automatically covers children once they reach their first birthday. The
  terms and conditions do, indeed, state that illnesses that are present from
  birth are not covered and that symptoms must not have started when the cover
  begins. You sought advice when your son was one as he wasn’t meeting certain
  developmental targets, but all the tests came back negative. It took another
  seven years before he was diagnosed with SMA-RD. The Financial Ombudsman
  Service states that it usually upholds complaints about claims rejected
  because of pre-existing conditions of which the customer was unaware. It also
  says that it overrides exclusions in insurers’ terms and conditions if the
  customer had only general symptoms when cover began, and could not reasonably
  have foreseen that they would later give rise to a claim. There are many
  reasons why a one-year-old may miss generalised development milestones and
  most aren’t incurable diseases. I therefore put it to Aviva that you could
  have had no way of knowing that your infant son had a serious condition that
  would lead to a claim 15 years later. I suggested that, given the complexities
  and the timescales, it was rejecting the claim unreasonably on a technicality.
  I was startled by the speed of Aviva’s response. Within two days it had told
  you that, although it considered your claim had failed to meet its terms and
  conditions, it would pay you the full £10,000 allowed by your policy. It
  freely acknowledged that its about-turn had been prompted by my intervention.
  The money was in your account a few hours later. It says: “We fully
  acknowledge that our service and communication did not meet the standards our
  customers rightly expect from us. The family’s situation should have prompted
  a more urgent and compassionate response. “While we are unable to approve NL’s
  son’s claim because of the terms of the policy, we recognise the unique
  circumstances of this case and the shortfalls in our service, and believe that
  it is appropriate to make a goodwill payment that is equivalent to the benefit
  the family would have received had the claim been eligible.” Coming up to
  scratch Most companies get it right most of the time. Most put it right when
  they don’t. And some exceed expectations so magnificently they deserve a
  shout-out. “I have a £73 pair of Cocoons sunglasses that fit over ordinary
  glasses,” writes LR of Colchester. “I have macular degeneration and UV
  protection helps slow this. My puppy got hold of them and scratched the
  lenses. I rang the company to ask if this would damage the UV protection, and
  was told that, under the terms of the warranty, I could get a new pair by
  paying £2.99 for postage. “I said that I did not think that a four-month-old
  German shepherd counted as ‘normal wear and tear’, but a new pair duly
  arrived.” We welcome letters but cannot answer individually. Email us at
