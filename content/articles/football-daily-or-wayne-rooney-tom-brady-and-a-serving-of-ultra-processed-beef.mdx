  LOOK ROO’S TALKING Today’s Football Daily would like to start with the topical
  events of 15 February 1983. That was the day Manchester United outplayed and
  outviolenced Arsenal in the first leg of their Milk Cup semi-final at
  Highbury. United won 4-2; they were 4-0 up after 80 minutes before taking
  their foot off Arsenal’s throat, and shinbone, and head. “Perhaps we’ve been
  concentrating too much on passing and technique,” lamented Don Howe, Arsenal’s
  head coach and assistant to the manager, Terry Neill. “Against United we went
  out to strike the ball about instead of putting some meat into the game.” In
  1980s English football, there was no place for veganism. Things have changed
  since the days when ABH was a bookable offence, and only then after the first
  10 minutes, but English football still has a pretty noxious meat footprint. In
  2025, English society, never mind football, is addicted to beef. You know it’s
  a weekday when a relatively minor difference of opinion between two adults is
  reported using the kind of language once reserved for a bloodbath involving
  the Five Families. Today’s beef involves two football legends: Wayne Rooney
  (association) and Tom Brady (American). In case you missed it – if you did,
  get out while you still can – Rooney’s work ethic during his time as
  Birmingham City manager was questioned by Brady, a part-owner of the club.
  This emerged in a documentary at the end of July, seven months after Rooney
  was sacked by Birmingham – but this ultra-processed beef ain’t got no sell-by
  date, baby. “I’m a little worried about our head coach’s work ethic,” said
  Brady. “I mean, I don’t know, I don’t have great instincts on that.” Rooney
  waited a couple of weeks to reply publicly, coincidentally via the medium of a
  new podcast that he’d be plugging desperately, if only there was a story he
  could sell. Remember the name: The Wayne Rooney Show. Actually, we shouldn’t
  throw shade at Our Wazza. We’re all selling something these days, whether it’s
  a podcast, a Substack or our last dapple of dignity. And we’re all buying what
  everyone else is selling, a world of dopamine nutters in desperate need of
  just one more hit. “I think it was a very unfair comment,” said Rooney, before
  explaining that Brady’s only visit was the day before a game, when everyone’s
  workload is generally lighter. “I don’t think he really understood football
  that well at the time.” Rooney went on to call Brady an abject, NKOTB-loving
  motherf- no, of course he didn’t. He called him “one of, if not the greatest
  athlete of all time”. His tone was reasonable throughout, even if he
  undermined his point slightly by saying the NFL season only lasted three
  months. Rooney concluded by putting the whole thing in an appropriate context.
  “Bit disappointed but nothing too serious, so move on.” That quote wasn’t used
  by the BBC, broadcasters of The Wayne Rooney Show, but they did have
  sufficient grasp of nuance to put together a graphic for their news story that
  screamed THE BRADY BEEF. Football Daily isn’t claiming to be any better. We’re
  eating beef right now, FHS, and we’ve got enough in the fridge to take us
  through to at least May 2026. But deep down – to nick a line from our
  progenitor The Fiver – we know it’s time to STOP BEEF. And maybe, if this
  jejune culture gets much worse, to STOP FOOTBALL. QUOTE OF THE DAY “In medical
  terms, the operation succeeded but the patient died, so not that good in the
  end. But we worked on a gameplan that was a little bit different and very
  close to succeeding” – Thomas Frank, having failed to cure Tottenham of
  historic ills, reflects on losing Biggest Cup on penalties to PSG. In doing
  so, Frank echoed the words of Danish compatriot Ebbe Skovdahl, who said the
  same after his Aberdeen team lost, er, 7-0 to Celtic in 2002. FOOTBALL DAILY
  LETTERS With reference to yesterday’s Football Daily (full email edition), in
  which your contributor was bemoaning the lack of alternative monikers for a
  goalkeeper, may I be so bold as to proffer a few enhancements to their vocab?
  For starters, there’s goal minder, glovesman, custodian, netminder, No 1,
  sticksman, backstop and, of course, shot-stopper. For those seeking a more
  left-field nickname, try these for size: guardian (no, not that one) of the
  onion bag, net ninja, glove wizard or, indeed, the good old last line of
  defence. I should get out more” – Peter MacLeod. Given the fiasco of foreign
  footie fandom that Rob Ford described [Wednesday’s letters], maybe it’s time
  an English club of limited local loyalties takes advantage of La Liga’s
  newfound love of overseas matches and moves to the Costa Brava, offering
  competitive football at regularly scheduled times to ex-pats and disaffected
  locals alike … CB Dons, it’s your time to shine” – Declan Hackett. Spurs
  playing very well and yet losing to a PSG team that only had one week of
  training since the end of last season, only really had Vitinha in midfield
  until the vastly underrated Fabián Ruiz came on in the 60th minute, and
  offered up the funniest Keystone Cops-style defending since Spurs’s 4-0 defeat
  to Bayern last week? Of course the Spurs(y) manager is rightly ‘Very, very
  proud’” – Noble Francis. If you have any, please send letters to
  the.boss@theguardian.com. Today’s winner of our prizeless letter o’ the day is
  … Peter MacLeod. Terms and conditions for our competitions, when we run them,
  can be viewed here.  RECOMMENDED LISTENING Max Rushden is joined by Barry
  Glendenning, Jonathan Wilson and John Brewin for the second of our Premier
  League preview podcasts: Leeds to Wolves. RECOMMENDED BOOKING On Thursday 11
  September, join Max Rushden, Barry Glendenning and Football Weekly all-stars
  Jonathan Wilson, Nicky Bandini and Jonathan Liew for an evening of
  breathtaking beautiful game punditry at Troxy in London. The pod will also be
  livestreamed globally. Book now. This is an extract from our daily football
