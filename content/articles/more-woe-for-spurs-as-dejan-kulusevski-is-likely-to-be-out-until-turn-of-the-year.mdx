  Dejan Kulusevski is expected to be out until around the turn of the year, the
  Guardian understands. The Tottenham attacking midfielder underwent knee
  surgery in mid-May and, although the injury was serious, the extent of the
  lay-off he faces has until now been unclear. Losing the Sweden international,
  who scored 10 goals and provided 11 assists in 50 appearances for Spurs last
  season, is another headache for Thomas Frank, who is digesting the club being
  gazumped by Arsenal for the £67.5m signature of Crystal Palace’s Eberechi Eze.
  The manager’s other key attacking midfielder, James Maddison, is a long-term
  casualty after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament against Newcastle in
  pre-season. The pressure is on Spurs to respond to missing out on Eze with a
  statement signing after the failure earlier in the summer to sign Nottingham
  Forest’s Morgan Gibbs-White. They thought they had the midfielder after moving
  on a £60m buyout clause in his contract only for the Forest owner, Evangelos
  Marinakis, to refuse to sanction the deal. Spurs have shown an interest in the
  Manchester City winger Savinho, although City maintain they want to keep the
  Brazilian. Spurs play at City on Saturday lunchtime. Whether their opponents
  soften their stance after the game remains to be seen. Spurs have made
  inquiries about Monaco’s Maghnes Akliouche. The France Under-21 international,
  who has burnished his reputation after two impressive seasons at Monaco, can
  play on the wing or through the middle. Frank is also open to signing Yoane
  Wissa from his former club Brentford and retains an interest in the
  Southampton winger Tyler Dibling, while Como’s Nico Paz is another option.
  Spurs have been relatively quiet so far in the transfer window. In terms of
  new faces, they have added Mohammed Kudus, João Paulinha, Luka Vuskovic and
  Kota Takai.
