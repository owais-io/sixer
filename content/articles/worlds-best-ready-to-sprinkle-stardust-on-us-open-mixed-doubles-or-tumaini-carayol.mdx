  A few hours after Taylor Fritz’s third‑round match at the Cincinnati Open, the
  theme of his post-match press conference shifted from his tough victory
  against Lorenzo Sonego to the looming US Open mixed doubles tournament. The
  first question posed to him on this subject was carefully prefaced with the
  acknowledgment that mixed doubles was probably not his priority in the middle
  of one of the biggest tournaments in the world. As a grin spread across his
  face, Fritz interjected: “It is a priority.” Fritz had been asked whether he
  had any sympathy for the frustrated doubles specialists who had been brushed
  aside to make room for the transformation of this event. From his perspective,
  the right players were in the draw. “I’ve seen a lot of people calling it like
  an exhibition, or it doesn’t count,” he said. “I think this is the strongest
  mixed doubles field you’re going to see at a grand slam. If the mixed doubles
  teams that are in come in and win the event, then I’ll eat my words and say
  I’m wrong, but I think the level is going to be really high.” After six months
  of anticipation, the revamped US Open mixed‑doubles tournament is finally
  here. Usually the domain of doubles specialists with the exception of the very
  occasional superstar pairing, mixed doubles rarely generates much fanfare and
  at the grand slams it has come to represent more opportunities for trophies
  and prize money for doubles specialists. While the event usually runs at the
  same time as the rest of the grand slam main draws, this year it will be held
  in the week leading up to the start of the singles main draw. Sixteen teams
  will compete in a knockout draw across Tuesday and Wednesday. The first three
  rounds will be decided in abbreviated four‑game sets while the final will be
  determined in standard six-game sets. The winners will take home $1m between
  them, an $800,000 increase on last year. In an era when the top players have
  largely spurned doubles because of the increased physical demands of singles
  competition, the ultimate aim of the event is to attract the stars. For that
  reason, officials at the United States Tennis Association (USTA) already feel
  like the glittering player field and the interest it has generated has
  justified the move. The partnership between Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu
  has created countless headlines, but other distinguished entrants include
  Novak Djokovic and his compatriot Olga Danilovic, Iga Swiatek with Casper
  Ruud, and Fritz alongside Elena Rybakina. The only doubles specialist team are
  the Italian defending champions, Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori. In a truly
  meaningful event, the players would be scrambling for the most advantageous
  pairings. Since the initial entry list, numerous withdrawals have followed.
  Navarro’s withdrawal actually led Sinner to possibly find an even better
  partner in Katerina Siniakova, an 11-time grand slam champion. Jack Draper,
  meanwhile, is now on his third partner, Jessica Pegula, after his previous
  partners, Zheng Qinwen and Paula Badosa, withdrew from the US Open. Despite
  how much it has changed, the draw makes for surreal viewing with so many
  prominent singles players present. The first two lines are particularly
  noteworthy: Alcaraz and Raducanu have been drawn against the top seeds, Draper
  and Pegula, meaning the British No 1s are scheduled to do battle on Tuesday
  afternoon. Over the past few months on the tour, mixed doubles at the US Open
  has been a popular subject in player lounges at tournaments. Madison Keys, who
  is paired with Frances Tiafoe, says she has received FaceTime calls from
  Tiafoe with questions about their partnership, such as on which side she would
  prefer to play. Even on the eve of the tournament, there is still serious
  doubt surrounding the participation of some of the most prominent players in
  the draw. Alcaraz and Swiatek were competing in Cincinnati less than 24 hours
  before their first‑round mixed doubles matches in New York, meaning they will
  have an extremely short turnaround after a gruelling two-week event.
  Alternates should be ready. The excitement from many of the singles players is
  counterbalanced by disappointment from doubles specialists who feel they have
  been pushed out of the event. Singles rankings determine the entry list so
  they did not come close to making the cut. “When two world No 1s in doubles
  don’t get into the tournament, there’s probably nothing more to say about it,”
  Siniakova said on Canal+. Ben Shelton, who is paired with the No 1 doubles
  player Taylor Townsend, is empathetic towards the doubles players’
  frustrations. Shelton says: “I totally understand the honour of playing mixed
  doubles and what a mixed doubles title means, especially to those guys and
  girls, and I feel for them that they’re not able to play this year. At the
  same time, I understand the business mind of the US Open and what they’re
  trying to do to generate more revenue, make their event more profitable and
  have more excitement around it. That’s the craziest lineup that you’ve seen at
  mixed doubles in your life.” A longtime member of the Women’s Tennis
  Association’s player council, Pegula questions the US Open’s decision to make
  such a significant change without properly consulting the players, a common
  complaint. Communication with players, she believes, could have actually
  addressed some of these problems. “I felt like that was a really good example
  where we were like: ‘OK, you guys just kind of went rogue and changed the
  whole entire format and didn’t tell anybody, and you just kind of did it.’ And
  it was kind of like: ‘Did you talk to the players? Did you get input, maybe on
  how it could have been better?’” In the same breath, though, Pegula has
  expressed her excitement for the tournament ahead. This will not be the
  defining moment of any of these players’ careers, but they are intensely
  competitive beings who step on to the tennis court every day with the
  intention of winning, regardless of the format. For at least 30 minutes of
  their lives, this event will be a priority for many. Keys said: “I mean,
  there’s a grand slam trophy on the line and have you seen the prize money? I’m
  gonna try real hard.”
