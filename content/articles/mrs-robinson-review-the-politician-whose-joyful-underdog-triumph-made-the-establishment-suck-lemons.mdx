  It’s rare for a politician to cry on camera because they’re so moved,
  especially in a legacy-cementing retrospective. But it happens several times
  in Aoife Kelleher’s feature-length profile of the former Irish president, Mary
  Robinson. Whether it’s pride in the Irish national identity, sympathy with the
  disenfranchised or grave fear of how the climate crisis will affect future
  generations, Robinson is not afraid to let her emotions show and is, indeed,
  unable to avoid it. In those moments, we see the core of her enduring
  popularity. As captured by this programme, Robinson is a leader who actually,
  genuinely cares, about people and principles. A conventionally structured film
  – archive clips, journalist talking heads, an interview with Robinson herself
  – begins with her latter-day incarnation as an environmental campaigner before
  flipping us back to postwar County Mayo, where Mary Bourke grew up competing
  with four brothers. Despite being “shy” and a “bookworm”, she was filled with
  an impulse to “make life more fair”, and sought to implement that via the
  study of law at Trinity College, Dublin, where she met her future husband,
  Nicholas Robinson. A spell at Harvard meant she was in the US to witness
  protests against the Vietnam war and the assassinations of Martin Luther King
  and Robert Kennedy. “What is law when all of this is happening?”, Robinson
  remembers thinking. Back at home, she practised law but was soon drawn into
  politics and was persuaded to run in the 1990 presidential election. Her
  initial misgivings about the post being an irrelevant ceremonial institution
  soon gave way to a realisation that it could be a platform from which to
  advocate globally for human rights. And so, at a time when Ireland was still
  deeply misogynist, this little-known woman stood as a rank outsider against
  the slicked grey hair, ballooning double-breasted suit and contrived bar-room
  bonhomie of old warhorse Brian Lenihan. Lenihan’s party, centre-right
  traditionalists Fianna Fáil, had never lost a presidential election, but the
  charismatic Robinson’s ability to connect with a tired, downtrodden populace
  was already seeing her begin to draw level in the polls when a Lenihan acolyte
  launched a sexist personal attack on her in a radio interview. This gaffe
  provoked many female Lenihan supporters to switch sides. Robinson’s campaign,
  depicted to the sound of Cannonball by the Breeders, became unstoppable: the
  footage of her accepting the nomination, smiling freely while Lenihan and
  beleaguered Fianna Fáil taoiseach Charles Haughey stand behind her looking as
  if they’ve sucked on lemons, is a moment of purely joyful underdog triumph.
  Her presidency was profoundly different from any of her predecessors. Setting
  up a continuously lit lantern in the window of her official residence to
  represent members of the Irish diaspora who had been driven away by
  discrimination and oppression, Robinson made headlines by meeting with Queen
  Elizabeth II and Gerry Adams – not at the same time – before travelling to
  Somalia to draw attention to famine, and to Rwanda in the aftermath of
  genocide. At home, Ireland’s positions on gender equality and sexual freedom
  fundamentally changed, with Robinson’s drive to give voice to the voiceless
  playing a major part. She quit in 1997 before the end of her term, a move that
  is not the only decision she candidly describes as a “mistake” – although why
  it was so bad to renege on her deal with the Irish when her presidency only
  had a few months to run isn’t properly explained. She’d been lured away by the
  prospect of becoming the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights,
  and here the film gently prompts questions about Robinson’s politics. Now she
  could take on key transgressors, criticising Serbia, China, Russia and,
  indeed, the US, on the subject of Guantánamo Bay and the deliberately vague
  “war on terror”. The US responded by levering her out of her job, then
  awarding her the Presidential Medal of Freedom some years later. Watching this
  film, it’s hard not to wonder whether Robinson represents the best of and the
  limitations of rational, progressive liberalism: she spoke truth to power, her
  admirers would say, but others might say that she often politely asked power
  if it wouldn’t mind awfully reining it in a bit, and power said no. The
  concern abides as we see Robinson, now 81, acting as chair of The Elders, a
  prestigious pressure group founded by Nelson Mandela. Doing the rounds of
  conferences, seminars and campaign launches, Robinson is seen being brought to
  tears by melting glaciers, while giving speeches to green activists. The
  climate crisis might be the ultimate example of asking nicely not working, but
  perhaps someone listening to Robinson will take a more radical step forward:
  if they do, they’ll be the latest in a line of countless people inspired by a
  woman whose desire to do the right thing has never wavered. • Mrs Robinson
  airs on Sky Documentaries and streams on Now, on Sunday, 17 August.
