  Several years ago, I was stranded in Istanbul because of the Icelandic
  eruptions. I wandered through the ancient city and was astounded by the beauty
  of the place – and just as much by its food. I tasted grilled meats cooked
  over open fires on the streets, and had a kofta dish served with cacik, a
  classic cucumber and mint sauce, that was so intensely delicious that the
  moment has been distilled in my memory. Mince, with good provenance and the
  right amount of fat to carry flavour and lend moisture, is a kitchen hero.
  Here, it delivers an astoundingly good dinner inspired by that meal, and which
  shouldn’t break the bank. Lamb koftas with buttery tomato sauce A deliciously
  savoury feast of grilled lamb, spices and dill with a richly aromatic sauce
  Prep 10 min Cook 1 hr Serves 4 with leftovers For the spice mix 2 tsp cumin
  seeds 1 tbsp coriander seeds 3-4 fat garlic cloves, peeled 1 tsp ground
  cinnamon Salt and black pepper 1 tsp ground turmeric 1 tsp ground ginger For
  the koftas 2 tbsp vegetable or olive oil 2 medium red onions, peeled and diced
  900g lamb mince 1 large handful fresh dill, finely chopped For the tomato
  sauce 50g butter 1 large onion, peeled and finely diced 2 x 400g tins plum
  tomatoes 2 bay leaves Warm a heavy-based casserole on a medium heat, then
  gently toast the cumin and coriander seeds for a few minutes. Tip them into a
  mortar or spice grinde, add the garlic, cinnamon and half a teaspoon of salt,
  and grind to a paste. Set aside half of the paste for the tomato sauce, then
  mix the turmeric and ginger into the remaining paste in the mortar. Meanwhile,
  heat the oil for the koftas in the same pan, add the two diced onions, and
  sweat with a teaspoon of salt for eight to 10 minutes. Stir in the garlicky
  paste from the mortar and, once the onions are translucent and smelling
  tantalisingly good, add the lamb and scrape the mix into a bowl. To make the
  sauce, put the same pan back on a medium heat, add the butter and onion, and
  season generously. After eight to 10 minutes, stir in the reserved spice paste
  and stir-fry for a few minutes. Cut up the tinned tomatoes with scissors or
  squash them to a pulp, then stir them into the pan with the bay leaves. Stir,
  then simmer gently over a medium heat for about 15 minutes, until the sauce is
  thick and glossy. Meanwhile, mix the dill in to the bowl of onions and mince,
  and season with a teaspoon of salt and some black pepper. Mix thoroughly,
  then, using your hands, shape into equal-sized, flattish torpedo shapes. You
  should end up with 12-14 in all. When you are ready to eat, heat a griddle,
  barbecue or frying pan on a high heat until smoking. Griddle or fry the koftas
  for two to three minutes on each side, until just cooked in the middle. Serve
  astride the tomato sauce with short-grain rice or bulgur wheat, some wilted
  spinach or chard, and the cacik below. Shredded cucumber cacik A dip that is
  delicious for breakfast with bread, olives and feta, and perfect for layering
  in a sandwich and insanely good with grilled aubergine. Prep 5 min Cook 15 min
  Serves 4 with leftovers 400g greek yoghurt 2 small cucumbers, or ½ large
  cucumber 1-2 small garlic cloves, peeled Salt 1 small handful fresh mint
  leaves, finely chopped ½ tsp dried mint (optional) Extra-virgin olive oil Put
  the yoghurt in a mixing bowl and beat it with a fork until very smooth. Top
  and tail the cucumbers and coarsely grate them into the same bowl. Finely
  grate the garlic and add it to the yoghurt mixture with half a teaspoon of
  salt, all but a scattering of the fresh mint and the dried mint, if using.
  Pour over some olive oil in a swirl, top with the last of the fresh mint and
  serve with the koftas above.
