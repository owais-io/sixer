  something?

  Fed up with all those superhero movies cluttering up the multiplexes and
  forcing your delicate black-and-white Lithuanian goat-herding tragedy on to a
  single screen at 10am on a Tuesday? Angry, like Martin Scorsese and Francis
  Ford Coppola, that a $300m CGI raccoon gets more screen time than the slow and
  haunting meditation on existential despair your favourite auteur spent a
  decade working on? For you, then, the darkest days of comic book movie
  hegemony may be over. A quick peek at the theatrical release calendar suggests
  that there is not a single new major-studio superhero flick due to hit
  multiplexes in the next six months. That’s right, a full, blissful half a year
  – which hasn’t happened since May 2011. For years, the anti-comic-book brigade
  have insisted superhero movies are sucking the oxygen out of cinema and
  killing originality. Now, the great superhero drought of 2025 makes it look as
  though their side has finally prevailed. And maybe, after the best part of two
  decades of interchangeable third-act rubble fights and billionaire orphans
  growling about destiny, that’s as it should be. For those of us who are really
  rather fond of superheroes on the big screen, however, it feels like a worry.
  Six long months with no multiverse chaos or retconned origin stories?. What is
  going on? Is the comic book movie really dead? Did audiences finally get
  superhero fatigue? Or could it just be that the studios looked at their
  balance sheets, remembered Madame Web happened, and decided to give us all a
  six-month palate cleanse before trying again? The truth is that the gaping
  desert in the release schedule where quite a few superhero movies would
  usually be is the result of a perfect storm of misfires, budget panic and
  inter-studio meltdowns. DC fired its last cinematic universe into the sun (and
  hasn’t given James Gunn much time to get its new one into shape), Sony quietly
  strangled its live-action Spider-Man spinoff plans after Kraven the
  Hunterflopped. And Marvel, once the unshakeable titan, has begun watching its
  pennies too. Reports in Hollywood suggest the studio’s big plan for Phase 7 is
  to finally introduce the X-Men into the MCU, but with cheaper, younger
  unknowns rather than the expensive A-listers that permeated the 20th Century
  Fox films. This is partly because China no longer loves Hollywood cinema like
  it did in the halcyon, pre-Covid era, and partly because any studio that makes
  such eye-wateringly expensive duds as Eternals, Ant-Man: Quantumania and The
  Marvels is bound to have to consider cost-cutting issues sooner rather than
  later. Ironically, last month Gunn delivered Superman, the first well-reviewed
  film about a major DC titan since Patty Jenkins’ Wonder Woman in 2017. Marvel
  looks to be getting back on track following early box-office success for
  Fantastic Four: First Steps, which has also been well-reviewed. But just as
  one swallow does not a summer make, two vaguely competent superhero movies
  don’t magically erase a decade-long franchise hangover. The superhero slowdown
  isn’t just about artistic self-reflection. It’s a combination of bruised egos,
  battered spreadsheets, and the realisation that studios have relentlessly
  mined every character in the Marvel and DC back issues, including that one guy
  who appeared for two panels in a 1973 issue of Spider-Man whose power was
  talking to lightbulbs. The issue is basic box office maths. There was a time
  before Covid when you could slap a cape on an actor, throw in a Stan Lee
  cameo, and reliably hoover up a billion dollars before lunch. Now? Global
  audiences, particularly in China, have stopped treating every MCU release like
  a religious festival. And once your international market yawns, suddenly all
  those $250m CGI slugfests look less like guaranteed jackpots and more like
  prestige vanity projects in tights. The other elephant in the room is that
  streaming blew a hole in the business model. During the pandemic, Disney+ and
  HBO Max became superhero graveyards, funnelling B-tier projects to streaming
  audiences, and teaching them they could just wait a few weeks and then watch
  at home. The illusion of urgency – the idea that you had to see every film on
  opening weekend or risk missing the next puzzle piece – now seems ridiculous.
  Which brings us to the current vacuum, which may be less the heroic victory
  for cinema some may have hoped for, and more an emergency reset button. We may
  get six glorious months free from multiverse migraines and quippy alien
  invasions. But don’t kid yourself: it’s just Hollywood taking a breath and
  trying to figure out how to sell you more superhero movies next year.
