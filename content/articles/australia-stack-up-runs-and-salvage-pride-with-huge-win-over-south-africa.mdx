  Travis Head, Mitchell Marsh and Cameron Green smashed blistering hundreds as
  Australia steamrollered South Africa by 276 runs in the third and final
  one-day international of the series in Mackay. South Africa had already
  clinched the series, leaving the 50-over world champions to play for pride in
  the last match. Australia’s opening pair set the tone with a 250-run
  partnership between player-of-the-match Head (142) and Marsh (100), before an
  incendiary unbeaten 118 from Green powered Australia to a mammoth 2-431. The
  hosts hit 18 sixes as they posted their second-highest total in men’s ODIs –
  behind only their 434 against the same opposition in 2006. In response, South
  Africa were all out for 155 in 24.5 overs, with spinner Cooper Connolly
  completing figures of five for 22. “A pretty crazy day, wasn’t it?,” Australia
  captain Marsh said. “A full performance from the lads. Shame, it was a little
  bit too late but full credit to South Africa. They played outstandingly well
  in the first two games.” With Kagiso Rabada missing the series due to injury
  and Lungi Ngidi rested for the final ODI, South Africa’s pace attack lacked
  its usual firepower. After electing to bat, Head and Marsh milked 86 runs from
  the first 10 overs to signal Australia’s intentions. Australia raced to the
  100-run mark in the 13th over and Head reached his hundred off 80 balls,
  taking a single off spinner Senuran Muthusamy to reach the milestone. The
  hosts got to 250 in the 34th over but immediately lost Head, who was caught
  off spinner Keshav Maharaj after hitting five sixes and 17 fours. Marsh, who
  also struck five sixes, brought up his hundred before he fell fluffing a
  slog-sweep to Muthusamy, but there was no respite for South Africa as Green
  produced a sensational display of power hitting. The all-rounder raced to a
  47-ball hundred, his maiden and the second fastest by an Australian in a men’s
  ODI, and blasted eight sixes in his unbeaten 118 off 55 balls. Alex Carey
  contributed 50 not out as Australia set a huge target. In reply, South Africa
  slumped to 50-4 in the ninth over and never recovered. Dewald Brevis (49) and
  Tony de Zorzi (33) provided brief resistance but Connolly, backed up by superb
  catching from his teammates, ran through South Africa’s middle order. “We were
  under the pump from the first ball,” the South Africa captain Temba Bavuma
  said. “They put us under pressure. They made it look like a very good surface.
  They were far better than us today.”
