  Lyle Menendez was denied parole for his role in the 1989 killings of his
  parents on Friday, just a day after the California parole board denied the
  release of his brother Erik. California governor Gavin Newsom will have the
  final say in whether or not the 57-year-old will be released. Lyle and Erik
  Menendez have spent nearly 30 years behind bars for the murders of their
  parents. The brothers, who were 18 and 21 at the time of the killings, have
  said they fatally shot José and Kitty Menendez after years of molestation by
  their father. They were sentenced to life in prison in 1996, after prosecutors
  argued they committed the violence in order to receive a multimillion-dollar
  inheritance. The case has long fascinated the public and drawn international
  attention. Their first trial was televised by Court TV. But their story
  reached a new generation thanks to social media and numerous TV dramas and
  documentaries that focused on the abuse the brothers say they faced and
  criticism that they were treated unfairly by prosecutors and the media. Their
  family members publicly supported them and backed their allegations of abuse
  for years. Last year the Menendez brothers had hope for the possibility of
  release for the first time in years, when the then Los Angeles district
  attorney announced he would recommend they be resentenced. “They have been in
  prison for nearly 35 years. I believe that they have paid their debt to
  society,” George Gascón said, stating he believed they were subjected to “a
  tremendous amount of dysfunction in the home, and molestation”. In their years
  behind bars, the brothers have earned college degrees and served as mentors
  and caregivers. The brothers were resentenced by California judge in May,
  reducing their original full-life punishment to one of 50 years with the
  possibility of release. But the new district attorney, Nathan Hochman, opposed
  their release, arguing they never fully accepted responsibility for the
  crimes. On Thursday the parole board denied Erik’s bid for freedom, arguing
  his misbehavior while in prison, such as using a cellphone, demonstrated he
  still poses a risk to public safety. They denied him parole despite strong
  support from family members for his release. “Two things can be true. They can
  love and forgive you, and you can still be found unsuitable for parole,”
  commissioner Robert Barton said. Hochman praised the board’s “careful,
  evidence-based” assessment. “The board correctly determined that Erik
  Menendez’s actions speak louder than words, and that his conduct in prison and
  current mentality demonstrates that he still poses an unreasonable risk of
  danger to the community,” he said in a statement. Erik will be eligible for
  parole again in three years. Friday’s hearing, which was closed to the public,
  lasted 11 hours. It was held separately to Thursday’s hearing. Both brothers
  appeared by video link from the San Diego prison where they are being held.
  The panel members, whose identities was not released by the California
  Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, quizzed the brothers on their
  behavior and attitude towards the murders.
