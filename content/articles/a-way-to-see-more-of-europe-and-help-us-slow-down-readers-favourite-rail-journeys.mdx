  Winning tip: glorious north Wales circuit Starting from the border town of
  Shrewsbury, a spectacular multiday circuit of north Wales is possible: take
  the Cambrian Coast line through Aberystwyth, Barmouth, Porthmadog, then the
  gorgeous Ffestiniog Railway to Blaenau, where you can link back to Llandudno
  on the coast, and return to Shrewsbury (change at Llandudno Junction). There’s
  no shortage of accommodation, allowing you to stop and explore without rigid
  planning. The Cambrian coast and the seaside towns are a largely unexplored
  jewel outside summer. Dave Thomas First-class trip to Romania From Cluj we
  travelled through the snow-capped Carpathian mountains, stopping off to admire
  the historic Transylvanian cities of Sibiu and Brașov, before arriving at
  Bucharest’s chaotic Gara de Nord. The last leg of our journey took us
  eastwards to Constanța on the Black Sea. We arrived the day its stunning art
  nouveau casino was reopened after being rescued from dereliction. Romanian
  trains may not be the most luxurious or speedy, but with most of our journeys
  costing from £10 to £20 in first class, they are certainly value for money.
  Charmingly, at each station our train was greeted by a besuited
  stationmaster/mistress waving a flag to signal the train’s departure. Brian
  Dutton A day trip adventure around Edinburgh For a delightful day trip I
  recommend taking the Scotrail service from Edinburgh to Cardenden, which takes
  just under an hour. Enjoy the view of Murrayfield with Edinburgh Zoo on the
  hill to the north. Soon you’ll see the Forth Bridge girders loom at Dalmeny
  before you fly over the Forth. Take in the stunning view east towards the Bass
  Rock, and look west past bridges towards Stirling and the Grampian mountains
  beyond. The ancient capital of Dunfermline is next, as you enter Fife. To the
  north of Cardenden you will see the peaks of the Lomond Hills regional park.
  An alternative route is to change at Inverkeithing on return and take a train
  up the Fife coast to Kirkcaldy, from where it’s a 50-minute ride back to
  Edinburgh. An unforgettable railway foray and respite from touristy Edinburgh.
  Nigel Archdale Taking it slowly from Stockport to Andalucía We travelled from
  our home station of Stockport to Cádiz in southern Spain, stopping at London,
  Paris, Lyon, Barcelona and Seville en route. Not only was this a
  climate-conscious decision, but also a way to see more of Europe and to help
  us to relax and slow down. We took a river cruise in Paris, then the next day
  enjoyed lunch in Lyon where the local market place gave us a taste of the
  city. We next sped off to Barcelona, staying in the trendy neighbourhood of El
  Poblenou. From there we took in a panoramic view of the city from the castle
  of Montjuïc, followed by the bustling beach. Back on the train, our pace
  slowed again as we set out for Seville with its sweltering beauty and
  incredible history. Our final stop was Cádiz, where we saw the best sunset and
  sunrise. We wouldn’t be able to afford first class on a plane, but we could by
  rail. For example, Barcelona to Seville was under £60! We sipped wine as the
  beautiful landscape passed by, in a comfortable seat, with wifi and charging
  facilities, knowing there would be no wait for luggage at the other end.
  Rebecca Rome to Sicily via train and ferry Hop on the sleeper train in Rome,
  or perhaps Naples, and wake the next morning in Sicily. There’s no bridge
  (yet) so the train is loaded on to a ferry for the crossing, while you are
  sound asleep in one of the functional little compartments. You can go direct
  all the way to Palermo or – if you prefer – to beautiful Syracuse in the
  south-east of the island. Polly Belgrade to Stari Bar by day and by night We
  took the night train in a sleeper berth from Belgrade (after a few days
  exploring this cool, arty city) and were delighted by the old-school, velvety
  cabins with corridors and big open windows. We woke up to Montenegro and
  Albania’s stunning Lake Skadar. After a few days exploring the lake, Stari Bar
  and Montenegro’s beautiful coastline we headed back up to Belgrade by day –
  the mountainous scenery on this 11-hour journey is absolutely spectacular, and
  all for the round trip cost of €50. We used Man at Seat 61 to learn about the
  route. Jenny Interrail to Morocco via the gardens of Córdoba In March 2025 we
  travelled to Morocco via train and ferry from the UK. Travelling on an
  Interrail ticket through Europe, we made two three-night stops on our way to
  the port in southern Spain, and two two-night stops on our return journey. On
  the outward journey we stopped in Girona and Córdoba, both of which have
  picturesque old towns. In Córdoba we visited eight stunning courtyard gardens
  as well as the Palace of Viana and the Mezquita, surely one of the most
  astonishing buildings in the world. On the return leg we stopped in Málaga and
  Montpellier, both characterful places. We would have missed out on these four
  wonderful destinations if we had flown directly to Marrakech. Louise Anywhere
  in Belgium for €8.50 Last year, my wife and I explored Belgium by rail. We
  stayed in a self-catering apartment just a few hundred yards from Antwerp
  station, a fantastic cathedral to the railways containing several pink granite
  columns and panels, polished in our home town of Aberdeen. In Belgium over-65s
  can buy a day return to anywhere in the country for just €8.50! We visited
  several towns and cities, none involving lengthy journeys. On our travels we
  discovered the Unesco-listed begijnhoven of Flanders. These were medieval
  communities for widows or unmarried women, many now beautifully restored. Jim
  Fiddes Beach, mountains and gastronomy in France My wife and I have travelled
  around a lot of Europe but our best trip for simplicity is a triangle of
  France: Eurostar to Paris, then the TGV to Toulouse for saucisse and
  architectural and historical delights; next, the slow train to Bayonne, gazing
  at the Pyrenees as the train trundles past Lourdes and on to the French Basque
  coast; before taking the TGV back up to Paris. City, gastronomy, mountains and
  beach all in one. George Laid-back vibes on the line to Ljubljana Our trip
  began with the sway of a boat gliding into Venice. After days getting
  blissfully lost in quiet alleys and forgotten courtyards, we boarded the train
  from Santa Lucia station, speeding across the shimmering lagoon to Trieste. In
  a sunlit square, we savoured chocolate gelato, the Mediterranean sparkling
  nearby. Next, Ljubljana welcomed us with its laid-back vibes. We sipped
  cocktails in jars by the river, surrounded by art and colour. Finally, a
  graffiti-covered train carried us to Lake Bled, where we hiked and swam
  beneath the majestic Julian Alps, ending our journey in a cosy pod under stars
  and amid fireflies. Alex
