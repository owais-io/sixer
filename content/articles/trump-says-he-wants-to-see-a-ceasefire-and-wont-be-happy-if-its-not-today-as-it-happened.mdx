  As we get closer to the start of the Alaska 2025 summit, we are moving to a
  new blog where my US colleagues will continue our coverage of this event here:
  Meanwhile, that’s all from me, Jakub Krupa in London, for today. Not long to
  go now! If you fancy tracking the Russian government’s plane as it approaches
  Alaska, you can do it here, as it’s flying above Anchorage at the moment. in
  Zaporizhzhia The city of Zaporizhzhia, an industrial hub in south-east
  Ukraine, is as good a place as any to grasp the stakes of freezing Russia’s
  invasion of Ukraine along its current frontlines, or of implementing a “land
  swap for peace” deal as envisioned by Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. Plenty
  of people here and in other Ukrainian towns close to the frontline are so
  weary of the sleepless nights and disrupted lives of the past years that they
  are ready for Kyiv to sign a peace deal, even an imperfect one, if it means
  the attacks will stop. But many others have a very different opinion because
  they know first-hand what it means to give Russia control over Ukrainian
  territory: arrests, disappearances and the erasure of anything Ukrainian. As
  Moscow moves swiftly to Russify occupied territory, expelling or arresting
  active members of society and introducing new media outlets and school
  curricula heavy on propaganda, a few years of Russian control may make it
  almost impossible for Ukraine to regain these territories at a later date.
  About one in five people living in Zaporizhzhia are internally displaced, from
  places even closer to the frontline or from occupied parts of Ukraine. They
  are living in Zaporizhzhia until they are able to go home. On a recent visit
  to Zaporizhzhia, in a warehouse building where a group of volunteer women were
  making camouflage nets for the Ukrainian army there was a loud and resolute
  chorus of “No!” in response to the question of whether people would be happy
  to freeze the lines in exchange for peace. “And what about our homes, our
  lives, all the things we are waiting to go back for?” asked one of the women,
  quickly becoming tearful. Our only hope is for Ukraine to take them back, or
  we can never go home again. Meanwhile, Trump posted a new clip from his
  earlier conversation with reporters on board of Air Force One, giving what is
  probably his most detailed answer to a question on what will be the measure of
  success for today’s summit. He said: “I can’t tell you that. I don’t know it’s
  there’s nothing set in stone. I want certain things. I want to see a
  ceasefire. This is not to do with Europe. Europe’s not telling me what to do,
  but they’re going to be involved in the process, obviously, as well Zelensky,
  but I want to see a ceasefire rapidly. I don’t know if it’s going to be today,
  but I’m not going to be happy if it’s not today. Everyone said it can’t be
  today, but I’m just saying I want the killing to stop. I’m in this to stop the
  killing. You know, we’re not putting up any money. We’re making money. They’re
  buying our weapons, and we’re sending them to Nato, and Nato is sending us
  big, beautiful checks. But that I don’t care about. … But what I do care about
  is they lost last week 7011 people, almost all soldiers; 36 people in a town
  which got hit by a missile. Over 7,000 soldiers. It’s crazy.” Diplomatic
  editor President Trump has offered to join European forces in giving security
  guarantees to Ukraine in the event of a peace settlement between Ukraine and
  Russia, but it is premature for Trump to spell out precisely what form they
  will take, Lord Mandelson, the UK ambassador to Washington has disclosed.
  Mandelson is one of the most senior officials to suggest the US will actively
  protect Ukraine in the event of a peace deal. He added British and European
  forces would be present on the ground by Ukraine’s side to intervene if Russia
  ever broke the terms of a peace agreement. Lord Mandelson was speaking at the
  Chicago Council on Global Affairs where he mounted a strong defence of
  Britain’s close relations with the US, including over trade technology and
  defence. He said the Putin-Trump summit was not an exercise “where the
  Ukrainians have to beg for mercy and give up anything in order to buy an
  unreasonable peace.” The aim of the summit, he said, was to achieve “a
  rudimentary ceasefire” that leads to trilateral talks between Ukraine Russia
  and the US Russia is not going to win this war. If it’s going to win this war
  it would have done so years ago. He explained “once an agreement is reached,
  we in Britain and as Europeans have got to put in place not only monitors of
  the cease fire but arrangements on the ground that if triggered by a further
  aggression from Russia would be tripped and we would be there standing at
  Ukraine’s side.” Mandelson also said Ukrainians had shown the “sort of bravery
  that a country like America and a President like Trump admires and wants to be
  associated with.” He does not want to be associated with failure and in
  supporting the Ukrainians he is not. The UK ambassador to Washington further
  said that any future negotiations between Ukraine should not be framed as ones
  between a supplicant and a victor. “The US President has said it has to be
  land for peace. The question is how much land and what sort of peace. That is
  what we will be watching very carefully, but we know, whatever the settlement,
  the Ukrainian armed forces need to be rebuilt, reequipped, resupplied,
  retrained to deal with the future continuing threat hanging over them from
  Russia – because Putin is not going to go away.” We earlier brought you the
  report that Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy was waiting to get an update from
  Ukrainian intelligence services on the situation on the ground (14:52), and
  that meeting has now ended. Zelenskyy said that there were reports of active
  Russian strikes on Ukraine taking place today, saying: On the day of the
  negotiations, they are also killing. And this says a lot. He reiterated his
  call for “an honest end to the war,” and said he hoped to see “a strong
  American position” during today’s talks in Alaska. Historical references also
  come up in other countries’ reactions ahead of tonight’s summit, with leaders
  of Ukraine’s neighbour, Poland, warning against “Russian imperialism” as a
  threat facing Europe. In a social media post ahead of today’s commemorations
  of the 105th anniversary of the 1920 Battle of Warsaw – when the Polish army
  defeated the Red Army near the capital – Poland’s new president Karol Nawrocki
  drew parallels with the situation in Ukraine. “That is why we will never
  surrender to Russian imperialism, and why we stand with Ukraine in defending
  its freedom – to make Europe whole, free, and at peace once again. Russia is
  not unstoppable. Russia is not undefeatable.” He returned to the topic in his
  speech at the event, which saw a major military parade with 50 military
  aircraft and 4,000 soldiers from Polish and allied armies and is also a public
  holiday in Poland. Nawrocki added that Russia “lost to Japan at the beginning
  of the 20th century, it was defeated by the Poles in 1920, and today, for over
  three years... it has been floundering after its attack on Ukraine,” crediting
  the allies and Poland for helping Ukrainians. Similar themes also appeared in
  comments by Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, who said: “15 August is a
  good day for talks with Russia about war and peace. On this day 105 years ago
  during the Battle of Warsaw Poles stopped the Red Army in its march on Europe.
  Luckily we didn’t know that Russia ‘is invincible’ – and we beat them. Peace
  through strength, nothing else.” Both Nawrocki and Tusk took part in the
  European leaders’ consultations ahead of the Alaska summit. Ukrainian
  president Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked Nawrocki for his comments, saying that
  “with a neighbor like Russia, only the cooperation of free nations can
  effectively protect each of them.” He said: “Ukraine’s independence
  strengthens Poland’s independence. And we must always remember that the
  Miracle on the Vistula was made possible through joint efforts, and it saved
  Europe. In the same way, Ukrainians have been defending our state in the full
  scale war for four years. By repelling the Russian army in Ukraine – near
  Kyiv, in the Sumy, Kharkiv, and Donetsk regions, as well as in the Black Sea –
  Ukrainians are truly ensuring the opportunity for all Europeans to live
  freely, free of Moscow’s madness.” Meanwhile, the former Obama administration
  official and former managing editor of Time magazine, Richard Stengel, has
  objected to reports describing the Alaska summit as “high-stakes”, arguing on
  social media that it’s “a journalistic cliche” that “plays into Trump’s
  theatrical framing of the whole artificial made-for-TV ‘event’”. Russian
  affairs reporter Putin touched down in Russia’s far eastern city of Magadan en
  route to his high-stakes summit with Trump, pausing for what appeared to be a
  series of trivial meetings with local officials. State media said he discussed
  the city’s urban planning and inspected a plant for processing and refining
  fish oil. Such deliberately low-profile stops are a familiar prelude for the
  Russian leader before major events – a staged display, observers say, meant to
  project confidence and control ahead of meeting the US president. But there
  was also a pointed gesture clearly aimed at charming Trump, as Putin laid
  flowers at a memorial commemorating US–Soviet cooperation in the second world
  war. Trump has in the past praised Russia’s military record, and Moscow has
  said the US leader was “deeply impressed” by the Soviet Union’s wartime
  losses. Aaand here it is – Trump confirms his “wonderful” call with
  Lukashenko, saying “the purpose of the call was to thank him for the release
  of 16 prisoners,” with 1,300 under discussion. They also, understandably,
  discussed the upcoming summit with Putin. Curiously, Trump’s readout also
  includes a reference to a meeting in the future. Here is his social media post
  in full: I had a wonderful talk with the highly respected President of
  Belarus, Aleksandr Lukashenko. The purpose of the call was to thank him for
  the release of 16 prisoners. We are also discussing the release of 1,300
  additional prisoners. Our conversation was a very good one. We discussed many
  topics, including President Putin’s visit to Alaska. I look forward to meeting
  President Lukashenko in the future. Thank you for your attention to this
  matter! And the Belarusian news agency Belta has just reported that Trump also
  spoke with the Belarusian president, Aleksander Lukashenko today. No more
  details on the call were reported, and there has been no confirmation on this
  from the US side (yet?). Looks like we’re going to get the first big moment of
  the summit very early on, as the Kremlin has just announced that US president
  Trump will formally welcome Russia’s Putin at his plane after arriving in
  Alaska. Despite confident trolling from some members of the Russian delegation
  (13:49), Russia’s state press, however, were in a less celebratory mood on
  arrival at their modest sleeping quarters in Anchorage, Alaska’s largest city,
  where the summit will take place. With hotel space taken up by the influx of
  international media, Russian reporters were put up in the local ice hockey
  team’s stadium, which had been converted into a Covid hospital during the
  pandemic and fitted with army beds donated by the Red Cross. “We are living in
  Spartan conditions,” one reporter is heard complaining in a clip posted on
  social media. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has just posted on
  social media, saying he expects to get a report from the Ukrainian
  intelligence services today “on the current intentions of the Russian side and
  its preparations for the meeting in Alaska.” Directly responding to Trump’s
  earlier comments (13:19), he then says: Indeed, high stakes. He adds: “The key
  thing is that this meeting should open up a real path toward a just peace and
  a substantive discussion between leaders in a trilateral format – Ukraine, the
  United States, and the Russian side. It is time to end the war, and the
  necessary steps must be taken by Russia. We are counting on America. We are
  ready, as always, to work as productively as possible.” Trump also confirms
  his earlier threat of “severe” consequences for Russia if it fails to show
  willingness to seriously talk about the end of war in Ukraine. He says:
  “Economically severe. It will be very severe. I’m not doing this for my
  health, okay, I don’t need it. I’d like to focus on our country, but I’m doing
  this to save a lot of lives. Yeah, very severe.” He ends the briefing here.
  Trump also gets asked about the possibility of the US providing security
  guarantees to Ukraine. He says: “Maybe, along with Europe and other countries.
  Not in the form of Nato, because that’s not going to, you know, there are
  certain things that aren’t going to happen. But yeah, along with Europe,
  there’s possibility …” Asked if his conversation with Trump will cover
  territorial issues, Trump says: “They’ll be discussed, but I’ve got to let
  Ukraine make that decision, and I think they’ll make a proper decision, but
  I’m not here to negotiate for Ukraine. I’m here to get them at a table. And I
  think you have two sides. Look, Vladimir Putin wanted to take all of Ukraine.
  If I wasn’t president, he would, right now, be taking all of Ukraine, but he’s
  not going to do it.” US president Donald Trump is now chatting with reporters
  on board of Air Force One. He says Putin is “a smart guy” and they “get
  along,” with “a good respect level on both sides,” saying he thought
  “something is going to come up.” “I noticed he’s bringing a lot of business
  people from Russia, and that’s good. I like that because they want to do
  business, but they’re not doing business until we get the war stopped.” On
  continuing Russian attacks on Ukraine, Trump says he thinks Putin “is trying
  to set a stage” and “in his mind that helps him make a better deal.” But the
  US president says “it actually hurts him, and I will be talking to him about
  it.” … and he’s off! Trump’s potentially most consequential trip of his
  presidency (so far?) is now under way. And when it comes to the Russian
  delegation, joining Putin are, among others: Foreign minister Sergei Lavrov
  Foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov Defence minister Andrei Belousov Russian
  Direct Investment Fund chief Kirill Dmitriev Finance minister Anton Siluanov
  You can read their profiles in this handy explained by Pjotr Sauer. As he
  notes, The Russian delegation, a mix of old guard loyalists and younger
  financial power-brokers, hints at Putin’s desire to woo Trump and dangle
  financial incentives for siding with Moscow on Ukraine. Trump will also be
  accompanied by a cadre of his most trusted advisers, among them a property
  mogul, a former hedge fund billionaire and the country’s top diplomat. Over
  the last hour we were given the full list of the US delegation for the talks,
  which apart from Trump includes: State secretary Marco Rubio Treasury
  secretary Scott Bessent Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick CIA director John
  Ratcliffe White House chief of staff Susie Wiles They will also be joined by a
  group of other senior officials, including deputy chiefs of staff and press
  secretary Karoline Leavitt, as well as special envoy Steve Witkoff and
  protocol chief Monica Crowley. Oh. Trump has just boarded the Air Force One,
  but has nothing to say to reporters gathered both at the White House and the
  Joint Base Andrews. A seven-hour flight to Alaska ahead before the US
  president meets the Russian president for the first time in four years.
  Russian affairs reporter In a not-so-subtle act of trolling, Russia’s foreign
  minister, Sergei Lavrov, arrived in Alaska on the eve of the US–Russia summit
  wearing a sweatshirt emblazoned with “USSR”. Once seen in western capitals as
  a pragmatic and skilled diplomat, the 75-year-old has in recent years mirrored
  the Kremlin’s radicalised politics, adopting an increasingly combative tone
  and resorting to trolling and mockery. Lavrov’s choice of attire nods to the
  Kremlin’s long-running narrative: Putin has repeatedly claimed that Russians
  and Ukrainians are “one people”, denying Ukraine’s legitimacy and territorial
  integrity while promoting a broader notion of unity with Russia. Most of
  Russia’s veteran delegation to Alaska, including Lavrov, began their careers
  in the Soviet Union and have been accused by the Russian opposition of
  clinging to a Soviet imperialist mentality. Under Russia’s occupation of
  Ukrainian territory, pro-Moscow authorities have dismantled monuments
  commemorating Ukrainian suffering under Soviet rule, including memorials to
  victims of Holodomor, the mass famine in Soviet Ukraine in the 1930s that
  killed millions of Ukrainians. The former Lithuanian foreign minister
  Gabrielius Landsbergis quipped on X about Lavrov’s clothing choice: “‘Just
  give us half of Ukraine and we promise we will stop,’ says negotiator wearing
  USSR sweatshirt.” Russian fashion bloggers on Telegram were quick to identify
  the $120 sweatshirt as the work of Selsovet, a Chelyabinsk-based brand that
  specialises in “Soviet heritage” clothing. Lavrov’s antics were the latest in
  a string of Russian provocations leading up to the summit, aimed at unsettling
  Ukraine and its European allies. Earlier, the editor-in-chief of RT, Margarita
  Simonyan, wrote that the Russian press corps flying to Alaska had been served
  chicken kyiv cutlets. The menu choice was quickly seized upon by other Russian
  propagandists. “Putin and Trump should turn Zelenskyy into a chicken kyiv.
  There’s no shortage of humour in the Kremlin,” wrote the pro-Kremlin
  commentator Sergei Markov. In the last few minutes, US president Donald Trump
  appeared to recognise the importance of the occasion ahead, posting on his
  Truth Social account: HIGH STAKES!!! We may hear from him again in the next,
  say, half hour as he is about to leave the White House for Joint Base Andrews,
  from where he will depart for Alaska – and we all know that he loves to chat
  with reporters! Defence and security editor Few believe that Friday’s
  Trump-Putin summit in Alaska will pave the way for a breakthrough. Russia and
  Ukraine remain far apart – with the Kremlin seeking to dominate its smaller
  neighbour while Kyiv wants to move decisively into the western sphere. Here
  are some of the key issues that will need to be addressed to reach a
  meaningful peace settlement. 1. Territory Russia occupies around a fifth of
  Ukraine after more than three years of fighting but continues to demand land.
  Earlier this week the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Russia
  wanted the rest of Donetsk oblast, 9,000 square kilometres of territory, in
  return for a ceasefire. Zelenskyy said Ukraine could not agree, particularly
  for so little in return. Ukraine’s public would also be unlikely to accept
  handing over more land to the invader. 2. Security guarantees Russia says it
  wants Ukraine to be neutral, though in practice this means a weak neighbour
  with no ties to the west. In previous negotiations, still referenced by the
  Kremlin, it has demanded that Kyiv’s military be reduced to a token 50,000. It
  also still calls for the country to be “denazified”, interpreted as a call for
  the replacement of Zelenskyy. Ukraine would like to join Nato, though this has
  been rejected by the US, leaving it searching for bilateral or multilateral
  security guarantees from its western allies. Britain and France have promised
  to lead a predominantly European “reassurance force” that will enter Ukraine
  in the event of a stable ceasefire, though Russia is opposed to this. 3.
  Sanctions and trade Russia wants economic sanctions that have been imposed on
  Moscow to be lifted. Trump, however, can only speak for the US, with the UK
  and the EU likely to be more hostile, unless Ukraine has signed up to an
  overall peace agreement. 4. War crimes, reparations and reconstruction War
  crimes and claims for reparations cannot be set aside as part of a peace
  agreement. The international criminal court (ICC) has an arrest warrant out
  against Putin over the forced transfer of about 20,000 children from Ukraine
  to Russia. Zelenskyy has asked that the youngsters are returned in the first
  stage of any peace discussions, but the ICC demand will not disappear. 5.
  Other issues There are many other practical concerns. Ukraine is calling for
  the release of all prisoners of war alongside an initial ceasefire. Russia
  holds more than 8,000 Ukrainian PoWs and Ukraine a smaller amount, making
  one-for-one swaps tricky. But there have been dozens of exchanges since the
  start of the war, and this may be one of the simpler issues to agree upon.
  Read in full: The eyes of the world are on Anchorage, Alaska, where the US
  president, Donald Trump, will meet with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin,
  for what the US hopes will be a pivotal moment in their efforts to end the war
  in Ukraine (the Russian hopes may be somewhat different). The summit is set to
  start 11am AKDT, which for us in Europe is 8pm BST, 9pm CEST, starting a
  flurry of diplomacy between the two delegations in a variety of formats:
  one-on-one and in larger groups. It is expected to conclude some seven hours
  later, according to the schedule, with plans for a joint press conference with
  both leaders. At least that’s the plan for now. Local residents are torn
  between excitement over high-profile visit and trepidation over what
  US-Russian leaders might agree, with some even joking: “Please don’t sell us
  back.” (The US bought Alaska from the Russian Empire in 1867). And that sense
  of solidarity with Ukraine was palpable on the streets of Anchorage, with
  demonstrations in support for the war-torn country with various banners
  further exploring that theme. But the talks are not going to be easy at all,
  with both sides coming with almost completely opposite aims and ambitions.
  Russia, emboldened by the apparent progress made on the battlefield, will want
  to try and convince the US that it’s just a matter of time before it meets its
  military goals, and any earlier settlement would therefore need to meet their
  maximalist demands. That’s very much not the view of Ukraine and it’s European
  partners, demanding respect for Ukraine’s sovereignty, the postwar principle
  that borders must not be changed by force, and arguing that not giving in to
  Russian demands is crucial for Europe’s broader security landscape. When it
  comes to the host, US president Donald Trump, he implied there was a 75%
  chance of the Alaska meeting succeeding, and that the threat of economic
  sanctions may have made Putin more willing to seek an end to the war. But what
  happens when the doors close and the two leaders sit down for talks – no one
  knows. We will bring you all the latest here with pre-summit analysis and
  commentary, and later live updates from the summit and first reactions from
  the US, Ukraine, and Europe. It could turn out to be one of the days we learn
  about in history books or… just another day of political theatre, with little
  practical consequences. Let’s see. It’s Friday, 15 August 2025, it’s Jakub
  Krupa here, and this is Europe Live.

By repelling the Russian army in Ukraine – near Kyiv, in the Sumy, Kharkiv, and Donetsk regions, as well as in the Black Sea – Ukrainians are truly ensuring the opportunity for all Europeans to live freely, free of Moscow’s madness.” Meanwhile, the former Obama administration official and former managing editor of Time magazine, Richard Stengel, has objected to reports describing the Alaska summit as “high-stakes”, arguing on social media that it’s “a journalistic cliche” that “plays into Trump’s theatrical framing of the whole artificial made-for-TV ‘event’”. Russian affairs reporter Putin touched down in Russia’s far eastern city of Magadan en route to his high-stakes summit with Trump, pausing for what appeared to be a series of trivial meetings with local officials. State media said he discussed the city’s urban planning and inspected a plant for processing and refining fish oil. Such deliberately low-profile stops are a familiar prelude for the Russian leader before major events – a staged display, observers say, meant to project confidence and control ahead of meeting the US president. But there was also a pointed gesture clearly aimed at charming Trump, as Putin laid flowers at a memorial commemorating US–Soviet cooperation in the second world war. Trump has in the past praised Russia’s military record, and Moscow has said the US leader was “deeply impressed” by the Soviet Union’s wartime losses. Aaand here it is – Trump confirms his “wonderful” call with Lukashenko, saying “the purpose of the call was to thank him for the release of 16 prisoners,” with 1,300 under discussion. They also, understandably, discussed the upcoming summit with Putin. Curiously, Trump’s readout also includes a reference to a meeting in the future. Here is his social media post in full: I had a wonderful talk with the highly respected President of Belarus, Aleksandr Lukashenko. The purpose of the call was to thank him for the release of 16 prisoners. We are also discussing the release of 1,300 additional prisoners. Our conversation was a very good one. We discussed many topics, including President Putin’s visit to Alaska. I look forward to meeting President Lukashenko in the future. Thank you for your attention to this matter! And the Belarusian news agency Belta has just reported that Trump also spoke with the Belarusian president, Aleksander Lukashenko today. No more details on the call were reported, and there has been no confirmation on this from the US side (yet?). Looks like we’re going to get the first big moment of the summit very early on, as the Kremlin has just announced that US president Trump will formally welcome Russia’s Putin at his plane after arriving in Alaska. Despite confident trolling from some members of the Russian delegation (13:49), Russia’s state press, however, were in a less celebratory mood on arrival at their modest sleeping quarters in Anchorage, Alaska’s largest city, where the summit will take place. With hotel space taken up by the influx of international media, Russian reporters were put up in the local ice hockey team’s stadium, which had been converted into a Covid hospital during the pandemic and fitted with army beds donated by the Red Cross. “We are living in Spartan conditions,” one reporter is heard complaining in a clip posted on social media. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has just posted on social media, saying he expects to get a report from the Ukrainian intelligence services today “on the current intentions of the Russian side and its preparations for the meeting in Alaska.” Directly responding to Trump’s earlier comments (13:19), he then says: Indeed, high stakes. He adds: “The key thing is that this meeting should open up a real path toward a just peace and a substantive discussion between leaders in a trilateral format – Ukraine, the United States, and the Russian side. It is time to end the war, and the necessary steps must be taken by Russia. We are counting on America. We are ready, as always, to work as productively as possible.” Trump also confirms his earlier threat of “severe” consequences for Russia if it fails to show willingness to seriously talk about the end of war in Ukraine. He says: “Economically severe. It will be very severe. I’m not doing this for my health, okay, I don’t need it. I’d like to focus on our country, but I’m doing this to save a lot of lives. Yeah, very severe.” He ends the briefing here. Trump also gets asked about the possibility of the US providing security guarantees to Ukraine. He says: “Maybe, along with Europe and other countries. Not in the form of Nato, because that’s not going to, you know, there are certain things that aren’t going to happen. But yeah, along with Europe, there’s possibility …” Asked if his conversation with Trump will cover territorial issues, Trump says: “They’ll be discussed, but I’ve got to let Ukraine make that decision, and I think they’ll make a proper decision, but I’m not here to negotiate for Ukraine. I’m here to get them at a table. And I think you have two sides. Look, Vladimir Putin wanted to take all of Ukraine. If I wasn’t president, he would, right now, be taking all of Ukraine, but he’s not going to do it.” US president Donald Trump is now chatting with reporters on board of Air Force One. He says Putin is “a smart guy” and they “get along,” with “a good respect level on both sides,” saying he thought “something is going to come up.” “I noticed he’s bringing a lot of business people from Russia, and that’s good. I like that because they want to do business, but they’re not doing business until we get the war stopped.” On continuing Russian attacks on Ukraine, Trump says he thinks Putin “is trying to set a stage” and “in his mind that helps him make a better deal.” But the US president says “it actually hurts him, and I will be talking to him about it.” … and he’s off! Trump’s potentially most consequential trip of his presidency (so far?) is now under way. And when it comes to the Russian delegation, joining Putin are, among others: Foreign minister Sergei Lavrov Foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov Defence minister Andrei Belousov Russian Direct Investment Fund chief Kirill Dmitriev Finance minister Anton Siluanov You can read their profiles in this handy explained by Pjotr Sauer. As he notes, The Russian delegation, a mix of old guard loyalists and younger financial power-brokers, hints at Putin’s desire to woo Trump and dangle financial incentives for siding with Moscow on Ukraine. Trump will also be accompanied by a cadre of his most trusted advisers, among them a property mogul, a former hedge fund billionaire and the country’s top diplomat. Over the last hour we were given the full list of the US delegation for the talks, which apart from Trump includes: State secretary Marco Rubio Treasury secretary Scott Bessent Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick CIA director John Ratcliffe White House chief of staff Susie Wiles They will also be joined by a group of other senior officials, including deputy chiefs of staff and press secretary Karoline Leavitt, as well as special envoy Steve Witkoff and protocol chief Monica Crowley. Oh. Trump has just boarded the Air Force One, but has nothing to say to reporters gathered both at the White House and the Joint Base Andrews. A seven-hour flight to Alaska ahead before the US president meets the Russian president for the first time in four years. Russian affairs reporter In a not-so-subtle act of trolling, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, arrived in Alaska on the eve of the US–Russia summit wearing a sweatshirt emblazoned with “USSR”. Once seen in western capitals as a pragmatic and skilled diplomat, the 75-year-old has in recent years mirrored the Kremlin’s radicalised politics, adopting an increasingly combative tone and resorting to trolling and mockery. Lavrov’s choice of attire nods to the Kremlin’s long-running narrative: Putin has repeatedly claimed that Russians and Ukrainians are “one people”, denying Ukraine’s legitimacy and territorial integrity while promoting a broader notion of unity with Russia. Most of Russia’s veteran delegation to Alaska, including Lavrov, began their careers in the Soviet Union and have been accused by the Russian opposition of clinging to a Soviet imperialist mentality. Under Russia’s occupation of Ukrainian territory, pro-Moscow authorities have dismantled monuments commemorating Ukrainian suffering under Soviet rule, including memorials to victims of Holodomor, the mass famine in Soviet Ukraine in the 1930s that killed millions of Ukrainians. The former Lithuanian foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis quipped on X about Lavrov’s clothing choice: “‘Just give us half of Ukraine and we promise we will stop,’ says negotiator wearing USSR sweatshirt.” Russian fashion bloggers on Telegram were quick to identify the $120 sweatshirt as the work of Selsovet, a Chelyabinsk-based brand that specialises in “Soviet heritage” clothing. Lavrov’s antics were the latest in a string of Russian provocations leading up to the summit, aimed at unsettling Ukraine and its European allies. Earlier, the editor-in-chief of RT, Margarita Simonyan, wrote that the Russian press corps flying to Alaska had been served chicken kyiv cutlets. The menu choice was quickly seized upon by other Russian propagandists. “Putin and Trump should turn Zelenskyy into a chicken kyiv. There’s no shortage of humour in the Kremlin,” wrote the pro-Kremlin commentator Sergei Markov. In the last few minutes, US president Donald Trump appeared to recognise the importance of the occasion ahead, posting on his Truth Social account: HIGH STAKES!!! We may hear from him again in the next, say, half hour as he is about to leave the White House for Joint Base Andrews, from where he will depart for Alaska – and we all know that he loves to chat with reporters! Defence and security editor Few believe that Friday’s Trump-Putin summit in Alaska will pave the way for a breakthrough. Russia and Ukraine remain far apart – with the Kremlin seeking to dominate its smaller neighbour while Kyiv wants to move decisively into the western sphere. Here are some of the key issues that will need to be addressed to reach a meaningful peace settlement. 1. Territory Russia occupies around a fifth of Ukraine after more than three years of fighting but continues to demand land. Earlier this week the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Russia wanted the rest of Donetsk oblast, 9,000 square kilometres of territory, in return for a ceasefire. Zelenskyy said Ukraine could not agree, particularly for so little in return. Ukraine’s public would also be unlikely to accept handing over more land to the invader. 2. Security guarantees Russia says it wants Ukraine to be neutral, though in practice this means a weak neighbour with no ties to the west. In previous negotiations, still referenced by the Kremlin, it has demanded that Kyiv’s military be reduced to a token 50,000. It also still calls for the country to be “denazified”, interpreted as a call for the replacement of Zelenskyy. Ukraine would like to join Nato, though this has been rejected by the US, leaving it searching for bilateral or multilateral security guarantees from its western allies. Britain and France have promised to lead a predominantly European “reassurance force” that will enter Ukraine in the event of a stable ceasefire, though Russia is opposed to this. 3. Sanctions and trade Russia wants economic sanctions that have been imposed on Moscow to be lifted. Trump, however, can only speak for the US, with the UK and the EU likely to be more hostile, unless Ukraine has signed up to an overall peace agreement. 4. War crimes, reparations and reconstruction War crimes and claims for reparations cannot be set aside as part of a peace agreement. The international criminal court (ICC) has an arrest warrant out against Putin over the forced transfer of about 20,000 children from Ukraine to Russia. Zelenskyy has asked that the youngsters are returned in the first stage of any peace discussions, but the ICC demand will not disappear. 5. Other issues There are many other practical concerns. Ukraine is calling for the release of all prisoners of war alongside an initial ceasefire. Russia holds more than 8,000 Ukrainian PoWs and Ukraine a smaller amount, making one-for-one swaps tricky. But there have been dozens of exchanges since the start of the war, and this may be one of the simpler issues to agree upon. Read in full: The eyes of the world are on Anchorage, Alaska, where the US president, Donald Trump, will meet with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, for what the US hopes will be a pivotal moment in their efforts to end the war in Ukraine (the Russian hopes may be somewhat different). The summit is set to start 11am AKDT, which for us in Europe is 8pm BST, 9pm CEST, starting a flurry of diplomacy between the two delegations in a variety of formats: one-on-one and in larger groups. It is expected to conclude some seven hours later, according to the schedule, with plans for a joint press conference with both leaders. At least that’s the plan for now. Local residents are torn between excitement over high-profile visit and trepidation over what US-Russian leaders might agree, with some even joking: “Please don’t sell us back.” (The US bought Alaska from the Russian Empire in 1867). And that sense of solidarity with Ukraine was palpable on the streets of Anchorage, with demonstrations in support for the war-torn country with various banners further exploring that theme. But the talks are not going to be easy at all, with both sides coming with almost completely opposite aims and ambitions. Russia, emboldened by the apparent progress made on the battlefield, will want to try and convince the US that it’s just a matter of time before it meets its military goals, and any earlier settlement would therefore need to meet their maximalist demands. That’s very much not the view of Ukraine and it’s European partners, demanding respect for Ukraine’s sovereignty, the postwar principle that borders must not be changed by force, and arguing that not giving in to Russian demands is crucial for Europe’s broader security landscape. When it comes to the host, US president Donald Trump, he implied there was a 75% chance of the Alaska meeting succeeding, and that the threat of economic sanctions may have made Putin more willing to seek an end to the war. But what happens when the doors close and the two leaders sit down for talks – no one knows. We will bring you all the latest here with pre-summit analysis and commentary, and later live updates from the summit and first reactions from the US, Ukraine, and Europe. It could turn out to be one of the days we learn about in history books or… just another day of political theatre, with little practical consequences. Let’s see. It’s Friday, 15 August 2025, it’s Jakub Krupa here, and this is Europe Live.
