  Britain’s relationship with the European Union was not a prominent issue in
  national debate when Sir Keir Starmer became prime minister, and Downing
  Street has striven to keep it that way. Labour strategists have seen Europe as
  a fissile topic, and Sir Keir’s opposition to Brexit in the 2016 referendum as
  a liability with swing voters. The prime minister has moved Britain closer to
  Europe, but in timid increments. The summit that formally “reset” relations
  early this year was long on statements of ambition, but short on substance.
  The government’s private recognition that economic logics impel Britain back
  into a European orbit has been in constant tension with fear of making that
  case in public. The balance now appears to be shifting. In a speech on
  Wednesday, Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister responsible for EU
  relations, made the argument for closer regulatory alignment with Brussels in
  newly combative terms. The government is negotiating an agreement that would
  eliminate costly checks and licence requirements for food and drink exports to
  the continent. Mr Thomas-Symonds expanded his advocacy for that plan into an
  attack on Conservatives and Reform UK for peddling “snake oil” and willing
  Britain to fail by denying the need for closer EU cooperation. Mr
  Thomas-Symonds also spoke enthusiastically about proposals for a “youth
  experience” scheme, allowing 18- to 30-year-olds to travel and work in the
  Schengen area on extended visas in exchange for reciprocal access to the UK
  for continental visitors. This has long been mooted in Brussels, but ministers
  were initially allergic to the prospect lest it be mistaken for an agenda to
  restore the level of free labour movement associated with EU membership, or
  cynically misrepresented in those terms. It is no such thing. Polling evidence
  indicates clear majority support for a programme that would, for time-limited
  periods, open up new European opportunities for young people. That is hardly
  surprising when opinion polls also show considerably more dissatisfaction with
  Brexit and its consequences than is widely reflected in political discussion
  of the subject. A clear majority says that it was a mistake to leave the EU.
  That shouldn’t be confused with willingness to undergo the kind of upheaval
  and social division that a campaign to rejoin the union would entail. But it
  does suggest that the government could be more aggressive in its criticism of
  Boris Johnson’s Brexit, and more courageous in facing down the militant
  Eurosceptic minority that has for too long arrogated to itself the right to
  speak for the whole nation. Although Nigel Farage has pledged to reverse
  Labour’s rapprochement with the EU, the Reform UK leader is notably reluctant
  to make a defence of Brexit the centrepiece of his bid to be prime minister.
  Indeed, none of the once ubiquitous high priests of Euroscepticism seem
  especially keen to be associated with the fulfilment of their cherished goal.
  That is a vulnerability in the opposition that Labour should be exploiting
  with more vigour. The manifest failure of Brexit to deliver any of its
  advertised bounties, coupled with the challenge of Donald Trump’s unreliable,
  protectionist administration in Washington, make an indisputable case for
  Britain to seek greater strategic intimacy with the continental trading bloc
  on its doorstep. The government is moving in that direction, but too
  stealthily, behind public opinion, following where it could be leading.
