  It’s been another summer of Strictly scandals – from allegations of stars
  using cocaine to a video appearing of an ableist slur being used on set – but
  the BBC will be hoping to move past that. The Strictly class of 2025 has now
  been unveiled in full. As always, optimistically rumoured big names failed to
  materialise. There’s no politician, no newsreader, no minor royal. Stacey
  Solomon, Rob Brydon, Monica Galetti, Tom Parker-Bowles, Mo Farah and pretty
  much anyone who’s ever been on The Traitors were all hotly tipped but haven’t
  transpired. Anyone would think they didn’t want to have their sticky-out
  bottoms and sticky-up thumbs critiqued in front of millions. So which 15
  celebrities (we deploy the term loosely) will be getting Spanx-clad and
  sequin-spangled on autumnal Saturday nights? Who could get their jazz hands on
  the glitterball trophy? Who’ll be sent home before their fake tan has dried?
  We’ve rated this year’s ballroom batch from worst to best in terms of likely
  sparkly success. 15. Ross King The celeb bookers totally wanted Ross Kemp,
  didn’t they? All it took was one typo in an email and here we are. The Los
  Angeles correspondent on Good Morning Britain and Lorraine bills himself as
  “the King of Hollywood”. Which is a bit like calling Sex Lives of the Potato
  Men a seminal piece of cinema. Film buff Ross will be desperate to make it to
  Movie Week. We’ll see about that … 14. Chris Robshaw Ex-England rugby union
  captain Robshaw is the ninth rugger bugger to swap oval balls for
  glitterballs. None have ever lifted the trophy, with 2006 runner-up Matt
  Dawson coming closest. Could he become the second consecutive Chris to win
  (after McCausland) and the third Chris overall (see also Hollins)? As a
  self-confessed “dad dancer”, no. He’ll likely lumber around like a teak
  wardrobe with a groin strain. Soz. 13. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink Despite all
  those kicks, flicks and tricks, male footballers traditionally fare even worse
  than rugby players. Only Robbie Savage has passed the contest’s midway mark
  and he’s half-afghan hound. Former Leeds, Chelsea and Netherlands striker
  Hasselbaink signed up to impress his Strictly-mad daughters. They should enjoy
  his participation while it lasts. A contender for the sparkly handled wooden
  spoon. “Don’t Hassle the Baink” won’t even become a catchphrase, sadly. 12.
  Thomas Skinner Bosh. In one of the more curious career trajectories of recent
  times, Essex pillow salesman Skinner shot to cult fame on the 2019 series of
  The Apprentice. He’s since become a populist influencer who praises Donald
  Trump and struck up an unlikely friendship with JD Vance, while slating
  Labour, Just Stop Oil and the “woke brigade™”. Mainly, though, he posts his
  massive artery-clogging breakfasts on social media, always ending with his
  catchphrase “Bosh”. He’s Del Boy for the TikTok generation. Farage in Reebok
  Classics and a puffy gilet. Can he dance? He’ll give it a go for Britain. Bosh
  again! 11. Balvinder Sopal From Walford to Waltzford, from duff-duffs to
  cha-chas. Recruiting from EastEnders, Strictly’s Elstree Studios neighbour, is
  an annual tradition but it backfired last year after Jamie Borthwick was
  suspended from the soap after a video showing him using an ableist slur while
  on set at Strictly. Balvinder, AKA soap matriarch Suki Panesar, is way too
  smart for such idiotic gaffes. Theatrical and elegant, she’s also become an
  LGBTQ+ heroine as one half of lesbian couple “Sukeve”. Let’s hope she makes it
  to Halloween so she can be “Spooky Suki”. 10. Harry Aikines-Aryeetey Dave
  Arch’s band, ready! Contender, ready! First out of the sparkly starting blocks
  was Nitro from Gladiators, AKA former Olympic sprinter Harry Aikines-Aryeetey.
  His glorified audition was the Christmas special, when he threw Nancy Xu
  around like she was an Elf On A Shelf, pulled off some “pec-ography” and came
  a creditable second. His Spandex-clad colleague, Montell “Fire” Douglas,
  reached the quarter-final last year and he could do likewise. Expect muscly
  stripping, pugil stick props and (hopefully) the running man on a travelator.
  9. La Voix Voilà, it’s La Voix. Rattling the earrings of Middle England comes
  Strictly’s first ever main series drag queen. The franchise tested the water
  in the Christmas special with Tayce, who duly won. La Voix, AKA Christopher
  Dennis from County Durham, was runner-up on last year’s Drag Race UK and
  Britain’s Got Talent semi-finalist. She’s trained in musical theatre, will
  look fabulous and generally slay but will La Voix get La Votes? 8. Kristian
  Nairn Hold the stage door, it’s Hodor the hoofer. Casting the Game of Thrones
  cult hero is a curveball that even Bran Stark didn’t see coming. Nairn admits:
  “This will be a huge challenge for me physically but I’m ready to rise to it.”
  The gentle giant has a thriving side hustle as a house DJ, so rhythm and
  musicality should be strengths. He’s also a total dude with a winning sense of
  humour, so will win over Westeros novices. Expect a cockle-warming journey of
  weight loss, self-discovery and dragon-themed routines, while various GoT
  alumni cheer him on from the front row. Winter is coming to the ballroom. You
  know nothing, Tony Beak. 7. Karen Carney This is the summer of the Lionesses
  and in the absence of a current player – Leah Williamson was a rumoured target
  – midfielder-turned-pundit Carney is the next best thing. Expect goodwill in
  abundance when the Brummie wing wizard laces up her ballroom boots. There’s
  speculation that she’ll form half of Strictly’s first all-female partnership
  since 2022 (and only the third ever), which would be a welcome twist. A
  routine set to Sweet Caroline or Freed From Desire would blow the Elstree
  Studios roof off. Bring on the 4am karaoke sessions and victory parades. 6.
  George Clarke Not to be confused with the Channel 4 property presenter and
  treehouse-botherer, this one is a YouTuber also known as “George Clarkey”.
  Honestly, I don’t know how they dream up these crazy nicknames. His comedy
  skits and Useless Hotline Podcast have seen him amass millions of followers.
  He’s played down his dance ability – saying he’ll “potentially fall over a
  fair bit” and “I once ordered pasodoble at a Spanish restaurant” – but the
  yoof vote could carry him to the final, à la Joe Sugg in 2018. Don’t forget to
  like and subscribe, guys. Guys? 5. Vicky Pattison She’s been crowned Queen Of
  The Jungle on I’m a Celeb. Will she now be Queen Of The Jive? Canny lass
  Pattison found fame on Geordie Shore but has since carved out an impressive
  career as a documentary-maker, author, campaigner and presenter. Far brighter
  and funnier than reality stars are often given credit for, she could go even
  further than her mate Pete Wicks last year. It’ll also be fun watching her pro
  partner being baffled by her Tyneside accent. “What are these stottie cakes
  and broon ales?” 4. Stefan Dennis Strewth, mate, it’s Paul Robinson from
  Neighbours. The bad-boy businessman and Ramsay Street Lothario is basically
  Ian Beale without the blubbing. He’s starred in West End musicals and had a
  pop career (who can forget his 1989 hit Don’t It Make You Feel Good?), so can
  hoof a bit. Jason Donovan, who played his on-screen brother Scott, reached the
  final. Could Erinsborough’s elder statesman find the perfect blend? He hails
  from Tawonga in Victoria, not far from judge Craig Revel Horwood’s home town
  of Ballarat, so could call in local favours in return for free drinks at
  Lassiters. 3. Alex Kingston While her fellow contestants supplied the usual
  platitudes about “comfort zones” and “being Strictly-fied”, Kingston’s quote
  on her official BBC announcement simply said: “Aaaaagghhh!!!!!!” We like her
  already. The ER and Doctor Who star was inspired to sign up by her pal Sarah
  Hadland, a runner-up last year. At 62, she might be the field’s oldest female
  but don’t bet against her. Classy casting. In your face, Dancing On Ice. 2.
  Dani Dyer Own up, who else’s heart skipped a beat when they heard this name?
  So close to Danny Dyer doing a samba and yet so far. Sadly, he once said: “I
  get offered Strictly every year but I’ve got no desire to be mincing around in
  sequins.” Still, the daughter of the beloved cockney thesp is a decent signing
  in her own right. She’s fresh from the first dance at her wedding to West Ham
  captain Jarrod Bowen and sweetly describes Strictly as “the second most
  amazing thing I’ve done this year”. As a Love Island winner, Dyer Jr has form
  for triumphing in reality contests. We predict a waltz to Hammers anthem I’m
  Forever Blowing Bubbles, while her dad gets weepy in the front row. 1. Ellie
  Goldstein She was the first model with Down’s syndrome to grace the cover of
  Vogue and partnered with Mattel to launch the first Barbie doll with Down’s
  syndrome. Now trailblazer Ellie Goldstein notches up another milestone by
  becoming the first Strictly contestant with Down’s syndrome. She’s already
  requested Nikita Kuzmin as her pro partner because “he’s hot and fit”. Don’t
  beat around the bush, Ellie, say what you mean. The irrepressible 23-year-old
  recently branched out into acting on CBBC’s Malory Towers. The myth-busting
  Mencap ambassador has the charisma, confidence and talent to make her bookies’
  early favourite. It’s another step forward for inclusivity and could be the
  feelgood story of the autumn.
