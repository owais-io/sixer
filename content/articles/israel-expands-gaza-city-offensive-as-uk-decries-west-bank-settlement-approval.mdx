  Israel has announced it is expanding its military operations in Gaza City, as
  the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, condemned its approval of a huge new
  illegal settlement in the West Bank as a “flagrant breach of international
  law.” The Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Effie Defrin said the IDF had
  begun the second phase of Operation Gideon’s Chariots in Gaza, which it
  launched in May. He said the IDF would intensify efforts to harm Hamas in Gaza
  City, which he deemed a “stronghold of regime and military terror”, as part of
  the operation. Defrin’s briefing coincided with a statement from Benjamin
  Netanyahu’s office in which he called for the acceleration of a
  much-threatened offensive to conquer Gaza City, an urban area home to hundreds
  of thousands of people in the north of the territory. “Ahead of approval of
  the plans for the operation in Gaza City, prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu
  has directed that the timetables – for seizing control of the last terrorist
  strongholds and the defeat of Hamas – be shortened,” the statement said. It
  was unclear if Defrin’s statement was referring to the wider operation, plans
  for which have drawn widespread international condemnation. Hamas said that
  Israel’s plans to conquer Gaza City showed its “blatant disregard” for efforts
  to broker a ceasefire and hostage deal. “Today’s announcement by the terrorist
  occupation army of the start of an operation against Gaza City and its nearly
  one million residents and displaced persons … demonstrates … a blatant
  disregard for the efforts made by the mediators,” it said in a statement.
  Israeli talk of a large-scale operation could primarily be intended to put
  pressure on Hamas in ongoing negotiations over a ceasefire and an end to the
  war. Defrin said Israeli forces were already occupying the outskirts of Gaza
  City and were operating in the Zeitoun neighbourhood. Israel had announced
  earlier on Wednesday that it was calling up an extra 60,000 reservists for the
  Gaza City offensive. It justified launching a new phase by citing an attack by
  about 18 Hamas fighters on an Israeli position the day before, which it had
  characterised as large-scale, despite its small size in reality. Thousands of
  Palestinians, facing widening conditions of starvation in Gaza, had already
  begun to flee in recent days in anticipation of the assault. Jordan’s foreign
  minister, Ayman Safadi, said on Wednesday that Israel’s assault on Gaza had
  caused “massacres and starvation” and that its wider actions were “killing all
  prospects” for peace in the Middle East. The French president, Emmanuel
  Macron, echoed the sentiment, saying the proposed offensive would lead to
  “true disaster” and drag the region into permanent war. Germany said it found
  it “increasingly difficult to understand how these actions will lead to the
  freeing of all the hostages, or to a ceasefire”, the government spokesperson
  Steffen Meyer told reporters. The Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz,
  announced that he had approved a plan to conquer Gaza City despite the
  decision earlier this week by Hamas and other Palestinian factions in Gaza to
  accept a ceasefire proposal that in most of its most significant details
  aligns with one Israel had previously agreed. It has yet to formally respond
  to the latest proposal. Israel also announced on Wednesday that plans to build
  a major new illegal settlement block in the West Bank had been approved. The
  block would split the West Bank into two with the deliberate intention –
  according to Israel’s far-right finance minster, Bezalel Smotrich – of killing
  off any prospect of a Palestinian state. Lammy wrote on X that if implemented
  the plan “would divide a Palestinian state in two, mark a flagrant breach of
  international law and critically undermine the two-state solution”. Israel’s
  top planning committee approved plans for the E1 settlement in an area of land
  east of Jerusalem that critics have said would undermine hopes for a
  contiguous Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. Smotrich
  backed plans last week to build 3,400 homes on a contentious parcel of land
  that lies between Jerusalem and the Israeli settlement of Maale Adumim. The UN
  secretary general, António Guterres, said building Israeli homes there would
  put an end to hopes for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian
  conflict. Amid credible evidence that its policies in Gaza have led to
  conditions of mass starvation and accusations of genocide, Israel has
  reiterated its defiance of outraged international opinion that is threatening
  to turn it into a pariah state, even as a growing number of countries have
  said they plan to recognise Palestinian statehood. The call-up of 60,000
  reservists and extension of the service for another 20,000 soldiers took place
  days after hundreds of thousands of Israelis rallied to call for a ceasefire.
  A growing campaign of exhausted reservists has accused the government of
  perpetuating the war for political reasons and failing to bring home the
  remaining hostages. The families of the hostages and former army and
  intelligence chiefs have also expressed opposition to the expanded operation
  in Gaza City. Most of the families want an immediate ceasefire and worry an
  expanded assault could imperil efforts to bring home the 50 hostages still in
  Gaza. Israel believes that 20 are still alive. A military official, speaking
  on the condition of anonymity in line with military regulations, said troops
  would operate in parts of Gaza City where they have not yet been deployed and
  where Israel believes Hamas is still active. Gaza City is Hamas’s military and
  governing stronghold and one of the last places of refuge in northern Gaza,
  where hundreds of thousands of people are sheltering. Israeli troops would
  target Hamas’s vast underground tunnel network there, the official said. It
  remains unclear when the operation will begin, but it could be a matter of
  days. The mobilisation of reservists is the largest in months.
