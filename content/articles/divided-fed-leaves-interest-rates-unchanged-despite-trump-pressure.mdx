  The US Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged on
  Wednesday, even amid intense pressure from Donald Trump to lower rates.
  Despite an onslaught of attacks from the White House against the Fed,
  officials at the central bank said that economic “uncertainty” remains too
  high to lower rates. But two of the Fed’s governors voted against the decision
  – the first time that multiple governors have voted against the majority since
  1993. Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, both appointed by
  Trump, wanted rates to be lowered. Both have been floated as potential
  replacements for Fed chair Jerome Powell. Data released on Wednesday
  underlined the resilience of the US economy, which bounced back faster than
  expected in the second quarter. US gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an
  annual rate of 3% in the second quarter of 2025, according to the latest
  official data, ahead of the average 2.5% forecast from economists. This marked
  a significant acceleration from a 0.5% contraction in the first quarter, which
  was dragged down by a surge of imports as companies tried to get ahead of
  Trump’s tariffs. But the rebound was boosted by a 30% slump in imports. Trump
  used the news to once again call for a rate cut and again insulted Powell,
  whom he has nicknamed “Too Late”. “2Q GDP JUST OUT: 3%, WAY BETTER THAN
  EXPECTED! ‘Too Late’ MUST NOW LOWER THE RATE. No Inflation! Let people buy,
  and refinance, their homes!” he wrote on Truth Social. Speaking after the rate
  decision, Powell said that it was still unclear how tariffs would affect
  prices. “Higher tariffs have begun to show through more clearly to prices of
  some goods, but their overall effects on economic activity and inflation
  remain to be seen,” Powell said. It’s possible, he added, that tariffs cause
  just a one-time price increase. But he warned that inflation could be more
  persistent. “What we see now is, basically, the very beginnings of whatever
  the effects turn out to be on goods inflation,” said Powell. “They may be less
  than people estimate or more than people estimate. They are not going to be
  zero. Consumers will pay some of this. Businesses will pay some of this.
  Retailers will pay some of this.” The Fed’s federal open market committee
  (FOMC) has eight opportunities a year to change interest rates during its
  scheduled two-day meetings. While the FOMC decreased rates three times in the
  fall, bringing them down a full percentage point, it left rates unchanged
  after its last five meetings. Interest rates currently sit at a range of 4.25%
  to 4.5%. Trump is partly to blame for the pause in rate cuts. Fed officials
  say that the economy has become too unstable to change rates. The Fed has to
  strike a delicate balance between its “dual mandate”, keeping both
  unemployment and inflation low. Though the economy was strong at the beginning
  of the year, Trump’s long slate of tariffs have started to creep into prices,
  bringing inflation up from 2.3% in April to 2.7% in June. But that has not
  stopped the president from trying to bully Powell into lowering rates. Over
  the last few weeks, Trump and other members of his administration have zeroed
  in on building renovations taking place at the Fed’s headquarters in
  Washington, which have ballooned in costs over the years. The Fed says costs
  have increased due to the nature of the renovations, which focus on two
  buildings that have not seen major renovations since the 1930s, but Trump has
  been trying to frame the renovations as extravagant waste. Last week, the
  president donned a hard hat and made a rare visit to the Fed to make a point
  about the renovations. During remarks to the press, the typically composed
  Powell appeared visibly irritated as Trump criticized the renovations. During
  the brief spat, Trump claimed that the renovations cost $3.1bn, though an
  annoyed Powell pointed out that Trump was including the renovation of a
  different Fed office building that was completed five years ago. When asked by
  reporters if he is still considering ousting Powell, Trump said he doesn’t
  “think it’s necessary”. “I believe he’s going to do the right thing,” he said.
  On Wednesday, Powell told reporters that it was overall “a good visit”. “I
  will say we had a nice visit with the president. It was an honor to host him,”
  he said. “It’s not something that happens very often at the Federal Reserve to
  have the president come over, let alone to visit a building.”
