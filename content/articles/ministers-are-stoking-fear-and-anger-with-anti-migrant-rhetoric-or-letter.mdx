webTitle: Ministers are stoking fear and anger with anti-migrant rhetoric | Letter
sectionName: UK news
webPublicationDate: '2025-08-03T16:28:57Z'
bodyText: >-
  As we mark the anniversary of riots that swept across the country last year,
  we remain severely concerned about the way in which political rhetoric is
  being used to demonise migrants, and “understanding” those who are causing yet
  more fear at hotels – rather than the experiences of those who came here
  seeking safety (Epping asylum hotel protesters ‘upset for legitimate reasons’,
  minister says, 24 July). We work with people who were left terrified in their
  own homes by the riots. We are saddened to see violence continuing – and
  escalating – including at hotels, such as in Epping and other areas, the
  recent riots and bonfire burnings in Northern Ireland, and a rising threat of
  far‑right agitation. Ministers saying that they “understand the frustrations”
  of those outside hotels only emboldens those who seek to spread hate and
  division, and leaves migrant communities in fear for their safety. Nazek
