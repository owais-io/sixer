  Harvests are coming two weeks early because of drought, Waitrose has said, as
  it prepares to stock autumnal fruit in summer. Farmers that supply the
  supermarket are harvesting wheat, oilseed rape, oats and malting barley a
  fortnight before they generally would, according to the supermarket. A lack of
  rainfall coupled with the hot weather has caused the crops to race through
  their growing stages and mature early. Data from the Environment Agency
  released on Thursday revealed that 80% of England’s river flows were below
  normal, and continue to drop. Rainfall has been scarce, with England as a
  whole receiving 1mm of rain as a whole so far in August. South-east England is
  particularly dry: it has received just 2mm of rainfall, which is 3% of the
  long-term average (LTA) for the month as a whole. England has received just
  14% (10mm) of August’s LTA after 19 days. Thomas Adami, the farming operations
  manager at Leckford Farm, one of the suppliers, said: “The drought conditions
  meant that the plants were stressed, and in reaction to this they raced
  through their growth stages to produce their seed before they senesce, hence
  the earlier harvest.” His team had managed to mitigate some of the worst
  drought effects as they had been practising regenerative farming, he said,
  which meant the soil had been kept in better condition and held water for
  longer. Adami said: “As we are increasing the organic matter content of our
  soils through our farming practices (cover crops, integrating livestock,
  minimising disturbance, etc), we are seeing that our soils have a higher
  water-holding capacity, which helps our resilience to drought extremes. An
  increase in 1% soil organic matter leads to an increase of 168,000 litres
  extra water holding per hectare available to the crops.” Waitrose said it
  expected apples and berries to be on shelves up to two weeks early. Jessica
  Street, an apple buyer with the supermarket, said: “We’ve got an early start
  to the apple season this year, all thanks to ideal spring conditions and a
  warm temperature throughout the growing season accelerating the ripening
  process for many fruits, like apples.” But although apples have benefited from
  the weather, for vegetables that require a lot of water, such as carrots,
  potatoes and brassicas, the situation is bleak. The Met Office is on track to
  record one of the warmest summers since 1884, and England had its driest
  spring on record, with some areas of the country facing an extremely dry
  summer. Rachel Hallos, the vice-president of the National Farmers’ Union,
  said: “The increasing extreme weather we are experiencing is impacting our
  ability to produce food, which will have substantial financial consequences on
  farm businesses. Last year’s harvest was marked by heavy rain; this year, it’s
  the lack of it. These fluctuations of drought and flood are becoming more
  pronounced and more regular. “Farmers and growers need investment in climate
  adaptation and resilient crop varieties to safeguard our ability to feed the
  nation, weather market volatility and adapt to a changing climate. We also
  need investment in water infrastructure across the wider farming sector and
  planning reforms that allow us to better capture and store in times of plenty
  for use when it’s needed.” Broccoli farmers have reported that their yields
  have been cut by more than 50% so far, and shoppers have been told to expect
  smaller vegetables. The British Growers Association has said supplies of
  brassicas are tight. The Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit has said the UK
  is tracking towards its sixth- or seventh-worst harvest since records began 40
  years ago. This comes after the second-worst harvest last year, which was
  partly due to record-breaking floods, and the worst harvest on record in 2020.
  This is the sixth consecutive month of below-average rainfall. England is in a
  nationally significant water shortfall, with conditions expected to last until
  mid autumn. Dry conditions could last well into October, the UK Centre for
  Ecology and Hydrology has said, which would put higher pressure on water
  supplies, as rivers, reservoirs and aquifers are at very low points. Five
  areas of England are in drought: Yorkshire; Cumbria and Lancashire; Greater
  Manchester, Merseyside and Cheshire; East Midlands; and West Midlands.
