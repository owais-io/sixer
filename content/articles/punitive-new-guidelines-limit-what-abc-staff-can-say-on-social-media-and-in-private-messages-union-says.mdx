  The journalists’ union has labelled the ABC’s new social media policy
  “punitive” and urged its management to come up with another set of rules in
  consultation with staff. The Media, Entertainment &amp; Arts Alliance (MEAA)
  on Thursday criticised the public broadcaster for its new “public comment
  guidelines” which limit what staff can express and categorises well-known
  journalists as “high-risk”. The national broadcaster introduced the new
  guidelines on Wednesday, two months after it lost an unlawful termination case
  against Antoinette Lattouf, who was sacked over a social media post while
  casually employed as a radio host. Sign up to get Guardian Australia’s weekly
  media diary as a free newsletter The guidelines state that employees “will not
  make any public comment that undermines your perceived or actual ability to
  perform your role; undermines the independence or integrity of the ABC or any
  ABC editorial content; implies ABC endorsement of your personal views; is on
  behalf of the ABC, or in a way that could be seen as representing the ABC,
  without prior authorisation”. While the guidelines apply to all staff, the
  policy document warns that the higher a worker’s public profile or seniority,
  the greater the potential “reputational” damage a breach of these standards
  may cause, both to the individual and the ABC. The national director of the
  MEAA’s media section, Cassie Derrick, said the policy appeared to target
  particular ABC staff based on how public facing they were, rather than the
  level of control they had over the editorial process. “The ABC’s new public
  comment policy doubles down on the punitive approach the national broadcaster
  has taken for some time towards its staff, and appears to be a mechanism to
  further entrench insecurity within the workforce,” she said. According to the
  ABC policy, workers whose public comments carry the “highest risk of
  undermining the independence and integrity of ABC content” include
  journalists, producers, news editors and senior leadership. The guidelines,
  which were endorsed by the ABC board, apply to any comments made by ABC
  workers on social media, at public events or in any context where comments may
  “reasonably” be expected to reach a public audience. The broadcaster’s
  managing director, Hugh Marks, confirmed the rules would extend to messages
  sent on WhatsApp. “If you were doing a conversation with a journalist, that’s
  a one-on-one WhatsApp message, then it would be reasonable to assume that that
  would also become public,” he told ABC radio on Thursday. Marks claimed the
  policy change reflected a general need for an update rather than being
  directly linked to the Lattouf case. “It’s a recognition that it’s not just
  social media where comments by some of our people can potentially reflect in
  an adverse way upon the reputation of the ABC and that we needed something
  that captured that much broader environment,” he said. Derrick said the union
  would write to ABC management asking that they “properly consult” with staff
  on a public comment policy that protected the broadcaster and its employees.
  The Walkley award-winning journalist and former ABC executive Alan Sunderland
  disagreed that the new policy was punitive and said it didn’t significantly
  change the “principles” that had already been in place. “If you go to the
  heart of it, it’s simply found newer, clearer language to explain the ongoing
  challenge between the rights of someone to just be a member of society and
  have their views and … working for an independent, impartial news
  organisations,” he said. An ABC journalist, who asked not to be named, accused
  the broadcaster of failing to consult staff and ignoring the findings in
  Lattouf’s unlawful termination case. “They have just come out of a court case
  where they have been told they are not allowed to sack someone for expressing
  a political opinion on social media,” the journalist said. “It wasn’t a
  secret, but they haven’t consulted on the policy. No one’s seen it before.” A
  spokesperson for the ABC said many people, including staff, provided feedback
  on the new policy. They said the guidelines reflected the ABC’s legislated
  requirement to maintain its independence and integrity and to ensure its news
  and information services are accurate and impartial. “Editorial staff
  providing news and information services have a particular responsibility to be
  mindful that the ABC’s impartiality – and their own and that of their
  colleagues – is not undermined,” they said.
