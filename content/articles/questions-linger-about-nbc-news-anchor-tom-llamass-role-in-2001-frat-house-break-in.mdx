  On an episode of Kelly Clarkson’s talkshow in June, Loyola University New
  Orleans received the kind of publicity many schools dream of. Clarkson’s guest
  was Tom Llamas, newly minted anchor of the NBC Nightly News and a 2001 Loyola
  alumnus. And Llamas nodded when it was posed to him that he had gone to “one
  of the best communications schools in the country”. “That’s why I went there,”
  he said of Loyola. The private Catholic university in Louisiana’s most famous
  city posted a clip of the exchange on Facebook on 16 July. Most of the replies
  were jubilant. But others snapped. Some on that site and other social media
  platforms took the chance to revive questions about an incident otherwise
  mostly forgotten: when Llamas and members of a Greek fraternity of which he
  was president were arrested in connection with a violent break-in reported at
  a rival group’s house after a neighborhood bar fight. Taking place in the
  middle of the night, the attack left a member of the other fraternity badly
  beaten, saw the victim’s girlfriend get pushed to the ground, and resulted in
  thousands of dollars of property damage as the intruders trashed furniture and
  broke windows. Two of Llamas’s own fraternity brothers told the Guardian that
  he was outside the home but never went in at the time of the incident. And
  authorities decided there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him. Ten more
  of his brothers in Sigma Phi Epsilon (SigEp) similarly had charges dismissed
  or reduced. A handful – but not Llamas – paid settlements or restitution amid
  related civil litigation. A statement issued through an NBC spokesperson said
  Llamas “as an undergraduate student at Loyola University nearly 25 years ago …
  was one of 11 students indiscriminately arrested following a fight and alleged
  break-in at another fraternity”. “Tom as well as most of those students were
  not involved in the incident,” the statement continued. “Following extensive
  reviews by both the university and local authorities, Tom and those not
  involved were never accused of any wrongdoing or found to have violated any
  laws or school rules.” The statement alluded to local press reports that were
  published at the time before concluding: “Tom graduated from Loyola in 2001
  and remains a loyal supporter of the school.” NBC provided the statement after
  the Guardian spoke with roughly two dozen people with knowledge of the case.
  One of those people, SigEp member Eric Rust, said he understood from
  conversations with him that Llamas went to the house that was broken into on
  the night of the intrusion – but did not go inside and left when he realized
  the nature of the situation. Using a college-era nickname for Llamas, Rust,
  who was arrested alongside him before their cases were dismissed, told the
  Guardian: “From what I know, Tommy did the same thing as I did: showed up but
  didn’t come inside.” A second SigEp member, Timothy Fanguy, told the Guardian
  that Llamas “was standing outside when all of this went down”. A third SigEp
  member, Joseph Deeb, said he, Llamas and others were arrested because “one
  witness … claimed to have identified 18 of us at night in the dark within
  about two minutes”. “Some of them were there – don’t get me wrong,” said Deeb,
  whose case was also dismissed. But he asserted that he and Llamas were among
  “about four” who were unjustifiably arrested on a flawed identification
  process. Fanguy said that process involved a female witness picking out people
  she recognized from a fraternity composite shown to her – among them some who
  were not in New Orleans at the time. Those on the victims’ side acknowledged
  the official conclusion that nothing was provable beyond a reasonable doubt
  against any suspect in a state-level criminal court of law. Yet they smarted
  over how Llamas has neither publicly condemned the break-in – involving
  members of the frat he ran as president during his senior year, when he
  himself was said to be outside the house – nor publicly expressed sympathy to
  its victims. They also say they have not seen any evidence that he ever tried
  stopping the incident. Instead, one of Llamas’s few comments on the case
  characterized it as a fight at a house – and he once described himself as
  “happy” the male victim’s fraternity was sanctioned with respect to a broader
  feud between that group and Llamas’s SigEp organization. “Something terrible
  happened to [someone who was just] home, and … nobody was like, ‘Hey, that
  must have been awful for you,’” said one of the people intimately familiar
  with the victims’ thinking. Deeb, Rust and Fanguy all stood up for Llamas in
  their conversations with the Guardian, maintaining that it was at best
  confusing – if not unfair – for him to be dealing with questions about
  something that happened roughly 25 years earlier. NBC, after issuing its
  statement, did not respond to questions about whether Llamas would acknowledge
  the fraternity brothers’ statements that placed him outside the home at the
  center of the case, or if – as the group’s president – he did anything to try
  to stop or discourage the incident. Those aligned with the break-in victims
  said it was important for them to speak out because the home invasion episode
  and Llamas’s physical proximity to it complicated the persona he has built:
  someone whose relentless pursuit for truth and public accountability
  catapulted him to the pinnacle of his industry, where he signs his newscasts
  off with “tonight and always we’re here for you.” Information from a retired
  police officer potentially illuminates why Llamas once came under suspicion.
  The officer, Catherine Beckett, now maintains that the female break-in victim
  allegedly recognized a schoolmate she knew as “Tommy” as one of the SigEp
  members there. Beckett took handwritten notes at the time – and shared them
  with the Guardian. Using abbreviations for “perpetrators”, “Sigma” and
  “Epsilon”, those notes say “Tommy” was “one of the perp ΣE”. The only suspect
  arrested known as “Tommy” was Llamas. Legal experts told the Guardian that
  people in Louisiana who are present for a break-in potentially face arrest
  even if they don’t go into the targeted home, though a prosecution would hinge
  on the state’s ability to prove intent. Regardless, a person familiar with the
  female break-in victim’s thinking said she didn’t recall her conversation with
  Beckett, along with other details about the crime. The person said the female
  victim blamed her memory lapse on the trauma of an attack that began with
  unnerving, incessant doorbell ringing – and culminated with her boyfriend
  being brutalized and her being manhandled. To this day, that victim cannot
  hear a ringing doorbell without triggering unwelcome memories of the break-in.
  “If [people] ring the doorbell too many times, [she’s], like, hiding,” the
  person closely familiar with that victim said. ‘There’s a mob going there’ The
  Loyola SigEp chapter had dealt with issues pitting it against the
  university-specific Beggars fraternity since the 1980s. Deeb said the Beggars
  had previously “jumped” him and some SigEp friends. The Beggars counter that
  the SigEp members were the aggressors in the feud plenty of times. Either way,
  both sides agreed their differences eventually reached a boiling point – and
  Deeb said that “everybody got sick of it one night”. According to news reports
  at the time, the groups clashed “over a girl” at a bar in the neighborhood
  surrounding Loyola either just before or after midnight on 22 February 2001.
  Then, at about 2.20 that morning, a large group of attackers kicked in the
  front door at a house just across from Loyola’s campus and barged through a
  floor-to-ceiling window. The three-story house doubled as the Beggars’
  unofficial headquarters. Police and people familiar with the victims said the
  only Beggar there was absent from the bar, studying at home for a medical
  school entrance exam while his girlfriend, battling a cold, watched
  television. Attackers reportedly punched and kicked the young man in the face,
  leaving him with swelling and two black eyes, a fellow resident and fraternity
  brother told the Times-Picayune newspaper. The invaders shoved his girlfriend
  to the floor and shattered four windows, a 16ft table and several chairs, the
  Times-Picayune reported, citing police. Loyola’s student newspaper, the
  Maroon, later reported that a contractor estimated the cost of the damage as
  at least $4,000. After the victims called police, the beaten man said “his
  attackers were members of another [Loyola] fraternity”, the Times-Picayune
  reported. The paper approached Llamas – then a senior Loyola communications
  and drama major – for comment. He reportedly said “some of his fraternity’s
  members were in an altercation at the [Beggars’] house but would not
  elaborate”, according to the paper. The commander of the New Orleans police
  district that includes Loyola, Louis Dabdoub, recalled his officers’ instinct
  was to write the case off as “stupid fraternity stuff”. However, Dabdoub
  recalled more recently, it turned out to be “way beyond a typical … house
  ruckus between guys”. “This was planned, methodical, ‘We’re gonna break into a
  place and hurt whoever is there,’” Dabdoub said. “This was … conspiring and
  getting enough people together to beat someone to the point of severe injury.”
  He said it was “the definition” of felony aggravated burglary under Louisiana
  law. Investigators obtained judicial permission to arrest Llamas and 10 other
  SigEp members on a count of aggravated burglary. Ultimately, five suspects
  were taken into custody on the same day officers obtained arrest warrants in
  the case. Llamas and Rust were among six who surrendered later, according to
  press reports at the time. Asked why he believed he was implicated, Rust said
  the break-in and ensuing investigation had evidently been so chaotic that some
  people who he knew for a fact had gone into the home during the intrusion were
  never arrested. He also alleged that up to half of the actual home invaders
  were out-of-town visitors celebrating that year’s Mardi Gras season. Rust said
  – as he best recalled – his arrest came after he and others showed up at the
  local neighborhood bar on the night of the break-in and were surprised to find
  the establishment empty. He recalled someone saying: “You need to go the
  Beggars’ house – shit’s happening … There’s a fight. There’s a mob going
  there.” Rust said he then went to the Beggars house, and the scene that
  greeted him there was “a little bigger than expected”. “I see everything, and
  I’m like, ‘Oh shit – I’m out of here,” Rust said. He continued: “I didn’t go
  with Tommy to the house, but … Tommy told me the same thing happened. ‘Yeah,
  saw that shit and got out of there.’” Fanguy said he had had conversations
  with his fellow SigEp members, including at a fantasy football draft recently
  – and those talks confirmed that “Tommy was outside and was not inside during
  this time”. “Some people wound up inside the house,” said Fanguy, who was at
  home in an off-campus apartment in the New Orleans suburb of Harahan at the
  time of the reported break-in. “But I can confirm … I do remember very clearly
  that not a single person said Tommy was inside. He was standing outside when
  all of this went down.” ‘Case closed’ Eventually, the local district
  attorney’s office either dismissed the cases outright – pointing to “testimony
  insufficient” – or moved them down to a municipal courthouse which handles
  misdemeanors. Llamas was in the first category, with his case being dismissed
  less than two months after the break-in. The cases against Deeb and Rust were
  also dismissed, with prosecutors similarly citing “testimony insufficient”.
  Municipal court docket entries under the names of defendants whose cases were
  referred showed dismissed charges of battery or criminal damage to property –
  or both. The break-in victims and the owner of the home, which the Beggars
  rented, sued six arrested SigEp members (none of whom was Llamas, Deeb or
  Rust) for damages in civil court. The plaintiffs sued three others who were
  not arrested. The burglary victims eventually struck “an agreement to
  compromise” with four of their lawsuit’s defendants, all of whom had been
  arrested, court records showed. The Guardian learned at least one paid the
  couple $5,000 to settle out of court. The Guardian also learned that at least
  one other person linked to the break-in paid restitution after the criminal
  case was opened but before the settled lawsuit was filed. There were also
  disciplinary proceedings at Loyola, with Deeb and Rust saying they and Llamas
  were among those who were cleared. Deeb also said the male break-in victim –
  who did not respond to multiple requests for comment from the Guardian – “told
  the truth” during the on-campus disciplinary process about “how a bunch of us
  not even there … got thrown into it”. Rust contended the male victim testified
  during the disciplinary process that he and others who were cleared “were not
  there” in the home – “and that’s it, case closed”. A board handling
  administrative matters involving fraternities initially ruled that the SigEp
  charter should be suspended until the end of the following school year. The
  university then shortened that suspension to midway through the next academic
  year. The Beggars were simultaneously put on disciplinary probation and
  prohibited from displaying their Greek letters, among other penalties, after
  the interfraternity judicial board (IJB) found it “culpable of behavior
  inappropriate of a Loyola organization”, as the Maroon reported. The Beggars
  also admitted being “culpable with mitigating circumstances to a charge of
  physical aggression”. Both came after SigEp members filed charges with the IJB
  accusing the Beggars of harassment on the night of the bar fight as well as
  the subsequent break-in and beating. “We are extremely happy with the
  outcome,” Llamas told the Maroon at the time. ‘Part of their history’ Llamas
  graduated from Loyola in May 2001. The Miami native worked his way from local
  news in his home town and New York to the national media, winning or being
  nominated for prestigious broadcast journalism prizes before replacing Lester
  Holt at NBC in early June. Llamas not only became just the fourth man since
  1983 to anchor the NBC Nightly News, a program once synonymous with
  predecessors Tom Brokaw and Brian Williams. The 46-year-old son of Cuban
  immigrants also became the first Latino to anchor a weekday English-language
  broadcast network evening newscast. “My parents came here with nothing … and
  now I’m going to anchor Nightly News,” Llamas said on NBC’s Today Show in
  June. “My name’s on that show – that is the American Dream.” Loyola has
  embraced Llamas, inducting him into its communications school’s hall of fame
  in 2015. Weeks after boosting Llamas’s appearance on Clarkson’s show, the
  university promoted a video of him discussing the quality of its journalism
  program with New Orleans’ NBC affiliate. Such plugs have not sat well with
  alums who have been close to the 2001 break-in victims. They say they accept
  that Llamas was not convicted of a crime, but they believe it is a mistake to
  act like some unquestioned things didn’t occur, even if an alum struck it big
  professionally. A Loyola spokesperson issued a statement to the Guardian
  saying the university “celebrates the achievements of its alumni based on
  their professional accomplishments and contributions to society”. One of the
  people closely familiar with the victims’ thinking laughed bitterly upon being
  read Loyola’s statement. “No one has ever said sorry – at least not in
  public,” that person said. “And, as far as I am aware, they have not done that
  privately, either.” Ramon Antonio Vargas is a 2009 Loyola alum. He was
  previously editor of the Maroon and serves as Loyola’s athletics hall of fame
  historian on an unpaid, volunteer basis.
