  The Trump administration has unilaterally stripped hundreds of thousands of
  federal workers of their union contracts after a federal appeals court
  overruled an injunction which halted the plans. It is just getting started,
  according to the White House. An executive order issued in March sought to
  cancel all collective bargaining agreements for most federal employees, citing
  national security concerns – and remove collective bargaining rights from more
  than a million workers. While unions including the American Federation of
  Government Employees launched legal action as they challenged the move,
  obtaining an injunction, this was in effect overruled earlier this month.
  Union contracts at the Department of Veterans Affairs, Environmental
  Protection Agency and the Department of Agriculture have since been
  terminated. An estimated 400,000 have been affected, about 2.6% of unionized
  workers in the US. “I think that what this administration is doing is trying
  us as a test bed. If they are successful, I do believe that they’ll be coming
  after every labor organization in the US,” Everett Kelley, president of the
  AFGE, the largest federal labor union in the US, told the Guardian. “This is a
  fight for the very democracy of this country. This is a fight for every worker
  in America. “If Trump is successful in dismantling AFGE, there’s nothing to
  stop him from coming after every labor organization in the country, and we
  believe he will.” Taylor Rogers, White House assistant press secretary, said
  the recent appeals court decision “reaffirms that President Trump has the
  lawful executive authority to protect America’s interests, and may eliminate
  collective bargaining agreements in agencies engaged in national security
  functions”, adding: “The Trump administration looks forward to continued
  victory on the issue.” The AFGE, which represents 320,000 employees at the
  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), received notice on 6 August – five days
  after the appeals court ruling – that union contracts would be terminated as a
  result. In a statement on the move, Doug Collins, secretary of veteran
  affairs, did not cite national security, but claimed cancelling the contracts
  would free up time and resources across the department. “There has not been a
  cancellation of union contracts on this scale in US history,” said Naveed
  Shah, political director of the veterans group Common Defense and a US Army
  veteran. “If the workers and veterans at the VA are not sacred enough to
  protect, then … every worker in the public and private sector should be
  concerned.” Shah warned that cancelling union contracts at the VA would make
  it harder for workers to advocate for their patients and have a safe
  workplace, thereby degrading the care veterans receive. “They have created
  division, anxiety and uncertainty in your daily life as a government
  employee,” said a nurse at the Department of Veterans Affairs in Queens, New
  York, who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation. “This attack on the
  working class in the government is just the first step.” Workers have won
  benefits and rights including the eight-hour workday, sick leave, workers’
  compensation, fairness in promotions and the ability to raise concerns through
  labor unions, the nurse said. “With the administration’s actions, they’ve
  taken that away,” they added. “With this administration coming in and
  politicizing the workforce and demonizing the work and the employee, it has
  taken away from our ability to really give the best to our veterans.” The VA
  has long faced threats of cuts and services being contracted out to
  privatization, the nurse argued. “They’ve taken away the one entity that stood
  in front of the agency and held them to the standard, held them to the law,
  held them to the contract, and was also the whistleblower on all of the things
  that were wrong,” they added. “This administration has made a major step
  towards diminishing the care that the vets get. The vets deserve a certain
  level of care. That’s why the VA was created.” ‘Canary in the coalmine’ On 8
  August – seven days after the appeals court ruling – workers at the
  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) received notice the agency was
  terminating all collective bargaining agreements with unions representing
  workers. “This is the greatest attack on labor rights since the Patco strike,”
  when about 12,000 air traffic controllers walked out in 1981, and Ronald
  Reagan responded by firing them and dissolving the union, said Justin Chen,
  president of the AFGE Council 238, which represents about 8,000 workers at the
  EPA. “And this is quite a bit worse.” He added: “We’re just the canary in the
  coalmine for the rest of the working class essentially.” The union is looking
  into additional legal avenues to protect their members, Chen said, as its
  lawsuit against the executive order is ongoing after the appeals court lifted
  the injunction. AFGE is currently backing a bill in Congress, the Protect
  America’s Workforce Act, that would restore collective bargaining rights to
  federal workers. The bill has 222 cosponsors in the House, including seven
  Republicans. In an April memo, the Chief Human Capital Officers Council (
  stated that collective bargaining agreements should not be terminated until
  the conclusion of litigation, or the agency provided further guidance.
  Attorneys representing the Trump administration had cited the memo to judges
  that agencies would wait to terminate the contracts. The office of management
  and budget did not respond to requests for comment on why union contracts were
  cancelled while the litigation over the executive order is ongoing. The Office
  of Personnel Management deferred to their director’s blog post. “The
  administration, they know us as a threat to their authoritarianism
  essentially, they know we are the ones who represent workers who are civil
  servants who pledge to both uphold the constitution and serve the mission of
  their agencies, which is supposed to be politically agnostic and serve the
  public,” added Chen. “It’s very obvious that this administration, despite them
  trying to portray themselves as some sort of defender of the working man, they
  attack popular programs like Medicaid, they attack popular agencies like the
  EPA and the VA.”
