  Australian skinks have evolved the means to resist snake venom by shutting
  down their muscles, suggests new research, which could help to inform future
  treatments for snakebites. Research led by the University of Queensland has
  found that multiple species of Australian skink have evolved venom resistance
  through changes to a critical muscle receptor. In other animals, the receptor
  is the target of venom neurotoxins, which cause rapid paralysis and death.

  UQ’s adaptive biotoxicology lab, said when venomous snakes arrived in
  Australia 25m to 30m years ago from Asia that skinks would have been their
  prey, resulting in evolutionary pressure to evolve venom resistance. “What was
  fascinating was that with the kind of mutations that we documented in the
  Australian … skinks that gave rise to resistance are the kind of mutations
  that we’ve seen in other animals outside Australia,” Fry said. Mongooses,
  which feed on cobras, are one such example. The researchers showed that the
  Australian major skink, Bellatorias frerei, had the same mutation that gave
  the honey badger its resistance to cobra venom. The researchers looked at 47
  skink species and found that 13 of these were resistant to snake venom. Of
  these 13 species, some had multiple types of resistance, leading the
  researchers to discover that the skinks had developed independent mutations
  conferring resistance on 25 occasions. Fry said the researchers had used
  tissue banks from museums across Australia rather than testing venom on live
  skinks. A study co-author and UQ researcher, Dr Uthpala Chandrasekara, said:
  “We used synthetic peptides and receptor models to mimic what happens when
  venom enters an animal at the molecular level and the data was crystal clear,
  some of the modified receptors simply didn’t respond at all.” “It’s
  fascinating to think that one tiny change in a protein can mean the difference
  between life and death when facing a highly venomous predator. “The more we
  learn about how venom resistance works in nature, the more tools we have for
  the design of novel antivenoms.” Dr Andrew Amey, collection manager of
  amphibians, reptiles and herpetology at Queensland Museum, who was not
  involved in the research, said there were more than 470 recognised species of
  Australian skink, with more being discovered all the time – with little known
  about them. “It is great to see research looking into how they deal with such
  an important predator that just might tell us more about how we can manage the
  effects of snakebite ourselves,” Amey said. The study was published in the
  International Journal of Molecular Sciences.
