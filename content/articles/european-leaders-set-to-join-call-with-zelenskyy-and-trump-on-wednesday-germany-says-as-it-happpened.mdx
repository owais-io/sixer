  … and on that note, it’s a wrap! US president Donald Trump said he was hoping
  for a “constructive” meeting to “feel out” the Russian position on Ukraine,
  claiming he “would know exactly” whether a deal could be made – but it
  wouldn’t be ultimately up to him to make it (16:44, 16:47). Trump expressed
  some annoyance with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy for his comments
  on the summit, but insisted he would talk to him about next steps and call him
  first after the meeting “out of respect.” He also confirmed plans to
  extensively consult with Ukraine and European leaders before the meeting
  (18:00). This comes after an earlier report from Berlin that Germany plans a
  phone call between a group of European leaders, Ukrainian president Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy and Trump and vice-president JD Vance on Wednesday, so the parties
  can coordinate before Trump’s meeting with Putin on Friday (16:21). The
  virtual call is expected to be attended by representatives of Finland, France,
  Germany, Italy, Poland, the UK, as well as the EU and Nato, who will have a
  chat first before joining Trump and Vance (16:33). The move comes after
  growing calls from European leaders to not get excluded them from this
  Friday’s Trump-Putin summit in Alaska (15:43), with Polish prime minister
  Donald Tusk revealing earlier that the US promised to consult the Europeans
  before the meeting (11:25). EU foreign ministers are meeting this afternoon to
  discuss the issue and the bloc’s position before the talks. In other news,
  Large parts of south-western Europe were seeing extreme temperatures on
  Monday, with growing concerns about possible further wildfires (12:15, 13:57,
  14:01, 14:11, 14:13, 15:19). Finland’s national prosecutor’s office said it
  has brought charges against the captain and first and second officers of the
  Eagle S oil tanker over cutting of undersea cables in the Gulf on Finland in
  December last year (13:20). French president Emmanuel Macron has warned that
  Israel’s plans to increase its military presence in Gaza amounted to “a
  disaster waiting to happen” (13:39). And that’s all from me, Jakub Krupa, for
  today. Have a great weekend! If you have any tips, comments or suggestions,
  email me at jakub.krupa@theguardian.com. I am also on Bluesky at
  @jakubkrupa.bsky.social and on X at @jakubkrupa. And Trump has just confirmed
  that he will be talking to the European leaders before his meeting with Putin,
  too. He praises them as “great people, great leaders,” but claims they are
  “tired” of the war and “want to get back to spending money on their
  countries.” He says he shas “extremely good” relationship with European
  leaders and confirms he will be taking to them, making a joke that there are
  “a lot of European leaders, but they rely on me.” “So I’m talking to the
  European leaders, I’ll be talking to President Zelenskyy. I’m going to get
  everybody’s ideas. I go into that thing fully loaded right up there, and we’re
  going to see what happens. Now, I think one of two things is going to happen.
  It could be a good meeting, and we’ll go a step further. We’ll get it done.
  I’d like to see a ceasefire very, very quickly, very quick. I’d like to see it
  immediately … And [so] we’re going to be dealing with the European leaders,
  and we’re going to be dealing with President Zelenskyy, and hopefully we’re
  going to have a great success.” Explaining his plan to end the war, Trump sums
  it up as: “Ultimately, I’m going to put the two of them in a room, I’ll be
  there or won’t be there, and I think it’ll get solved.” Asked if he can
  imagine a return to normal trade with Russia, Trump says: “I do. Russia has a
  very valuable piece of land if Vladimir Putin would go toward business instead
  of toward war.” Back to Trump, he just got asked about Zelenskyy’s attendance
  in the summit on Friday, and said “I would say he could go, but he’s gone to a
  lot of meetings.” He then added: “Well, we’re going to have a meeting with
  Vladimir Putin, and at the end of that meeting, probably in the first two
  minutes, I’ll know exactly whether or not a deal can be [made].” Asked why he
  was so confident about it, he replied: Because that’s what I do. I make deals.
  Separately, the Élysée Palace has confirmed plans for the call with Trump,
  with another call with the coalition of the willing. Speaking in the White
  House in the last few minutes, US president Donald Trump has claimed his
  meeting with Putin will “a feel out meeting,” but he thought that the Russian
  president “wants to get it over with.” He says: “I’m going in to speak to
  Vladimir Putin, and I’m going to be telling him, you have got to end this war,
  you got to end it.” He says he hopes for “a constructive” conversation with
  the Russian president, and says he will call the European leaders to debrief
  them on the chat shortly after leaving the room. He then says: “Then after
  that meeting, immediately, maybe as I’m flying out, maybe as I’m leaving the
  room, I I’ll be calling the European leaders who I get along with very well.
  And you know, I have a great relationship, I think, with all of them, and I
  get along with Zelensky, but, you know, I disagree with what he’s done, very,
  very severely disagree. This is a war that should have never happened … but
  I’ll be speaking to Zelensky. The next meeting will be with Zelensky and
  Putin, or Zelensky, and Putin to me I’ll be there if they need me.” He
  expressed some frustration with Zelenskyy again, saying: “I was a little
  bothered by the fact that Zelensky was saying, Well, I have to get
  constitutional approval. I mean, he’s got approval to go into war and kill
  everybody, but he needs approval to do a land swap? Because there’ll be some
  land swapping going on. I know that through Russia and through conversations
  with everybody to the good for the good of Ukraine, good stuff, not bad stuff,
  also some bad stuff for both. So it’s good and there’s bad, but it’s very
  complex, because you have lines that are very uneven. And there’ll be some
  swapping, there’ll be some changes in land.” He makes it clear he can
  negotiate the deal, but it will be up to Ukraine to accept or reject it. “I’m
  going to meet with him [Putin]. We’re going to see what the parameters are,
  and then I’m going to call up President Zelensky and the European leaders …
  and I’m going to tell them what kind of a deal. I’m not going to make a deal.
  It’s not up to me to make a deal. I think a deal should be made for both.”
  Ultimately, he says “I’d like to see a cease fire.” I’d like to see the best
  deal that could be made for both parties. You know, it takes two to tango,
  right? When it comes to timing of the expected Europe-Trump call, we’re
  expecting the internal European call at midday GMT (so 1pm BST, 2pm CEST),
  followed an hour later by a separate call with Trump and Vance. The so-called
  coalition of the willing is then expected to have another call later in the
  afternoon to consult on the next steps. Looks like a phone call between
  European leaders, Ukraine’s Zelenskyy and Trump could already be in the
  calendar, as the parties are keen to coordinate before Trump’s meeting with
  Putin on Friday. Germany said in the last few minutes that chancellor
  Friedrich Merz will host “virtual talks” between EU leaders – the leaders of
  the six nations that signed the joint statement over the weekend, so Finland,
  France, Germany, Italy, Poland, the UK (9:57) – who will be joined by the EU’s
  presidents von der Leyen and Costa and Nato’s secretary general Mark Rutte to
  speak with Zelenskyy, before joining a separate call with Trump and his
  vice-president, JD Vance. A statement by Merz’s office said the talks will
  focus on “further options for exerting pressure on Russia” and “the
  preparation of possible peace negotiations,” including “related issues of
  territorial claims and security.” The news of the call was first reported by
  the German press, including Welt and Süddeutsche Zeitung, and Politico. The EU
  ministerial meeting was scheduled to start around now, and it may not be
  before very late afternoon, early evening before we hear from the EU on the
  outcomes of the talks behind the closed doors. European leaders claiming
  Russia represents an existential threat to their continent are pushing for
  consultations with Donald Trump to spell out Europe’s red lines before his
  meeting with Vladimir Putin to discuss the Ukraine war on Friday in Alaska.
  The call for formal consultations is one of the outcomes expected from an
  emergency virtual meeting of EU foreign ministers convened by the EU external
  affairs chief, Kaja Kallas, on Monday. The meeting is also expected to demand
  that Russia agree to a ceasefire and hold talks with the Ukrainian president,
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Kallas, in advance of the EU meeting, insisted:
  “President Trump is right to say that Russia must end its war against Ukraine.
  The United States has the power to force Russia to negotiate seriously.” But,
  she said, “any agreement between the United States and Russia must include
  Ukraine and the EU because it is a security issue for Ukraine and for the
  whole of Europe.” Radosław Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, also
  asserted Europe’s relevance, saying: “Europe is paying for Ukraine to defend
  itself and we are sustaining the Ukrainian state. This is a matter of
  existential European security interests. We appreciate President Trump’s
  efforts but we will be taking our own decisions here in Europe. To get to a
  fair peace, Russia has to limit its war aims. The White House is insisting
  that the Alaska meeting is to gauge whether Putin is willing to make
  concessions for peace, including on accepting western security guarantees for
  Ukraine, an acceptance that would acknowledge the long-term legitimacy of the
  Kyiv government led by Zelenskyy. Trump, increasingly impatient with the
  Russian leader in recent months, has long said he does not see a ceasefire
  occurring until he meets Putin in person. In a post on X on Monday afternoon,
  Spain’s state meteorological office, Aemet, said temperatures in the
  Guadalquivir valley in Andalucía could reach 44C on Tuesday. “Although there
  will be a thermal decrease on Wednesday, the intense heat is likely to
  continue for the rest of the week,” it added. “Temperatures could rise again
  on Thursday and the heatwave could last a few more days.” Aemet has issued a
  red weather warning for the province of Seville on Tuesday, with orange
  warnings issued for large parts of the country, including most of Andalucia,
  as well as Madrid, Extremadura and parts of Navarra, the Basque Country,
  Aragón and Cataluña. We are getting some news lines from today’s Downing
  Street press briefing, with the UK prime minister’s official spokesman
  responding to journalists’ questions on Ukraine. Asked if Putin could be
  trusted, Starmer’s spokesperson said, via PA: “Never trust President Putin as
  far as you could throw him, but we obviously will support Ukraine. We will
  obviously support President Trump and European nations as we enter these
  negotiations.” He added: “We’re not going to leave it to trust. We’re going to
  ensure that we’re prepared such that we achieve a ceasefire. The coalition of
  willing and the security guarantees are in place... that learns the lessons of
  the past, where we clearly have not had those meaningful security guarantees
  in place, which did allow President Putin to re-arm and go again.” Reuters
  added that the spokesperson insisted that Ukraine’s borders are only for
  Ukraine to determine, and any peace deal must be built with its involvement.
  In fact, some parts of south-eastern Europe were already facing extreme
  conditions over the weekend, with wildfires raging in Albania, reportedly
  forcing evacuations and destroying homes in rural communities. AFP reported
  that over a dozen fires were active in the Balkan nation, after hundreds of
  firefighters and soldiers controlled most of nearly 40 fires that flared in
  the last 24 hours, according to the defence ministry. Around 800 Albanian
  troops have been deployed, along with military aircraft and helicopters from
  surrounding countries, to battle the wildfires. Several parts of the Balkans
  are tipped to climb above 40C this week, as a heatwave sweeps the region, with
  some of the highest temperatures expected in Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia.
  Brendan Wood for the MetDesk After a period of cooler weather, swaths of
  central and eastern Europe face another heatwave as hot air over south-western
  Europe pushes north-west. Since late July, large parts of the Iberian
  peninsula have endured persistent heat, with temperatures frequently climbing
  to the high 30s to low 40s celsius. With southern and south-western Europe
  already enduring intense heat, the arrival of this warm air into central and
  eastern parts is likely to mark the start of a widespread hot spell that could
  persist for several days. Deadly heat of up to 42C is searing southern Europe,
  as scientists warn of a “molotov cocktail” of climatic conditions that is
  fuelling vast wildfires across the Mediterranean. Météo-France placed more
  than half the country under heatwave warnings on Monday morning, with 12 out
  of 96 administrative units on the mainland under the highest red alert, while
  Spain’s Aemet warned of “extreme danger” in Zaragoza and the Basque Country as
  it issued yellow and orange warnings for almost all the rest of the country.
  Both weather agencies forecast temperatures above 40C over the coming days and
  called for vigilance amid forecasts of “a very intense, even exceptional”
  heatwave in parts of the continent. The high temperatures have alarmed experts
  as firefighters struggle to contain destructive wildfires. In France, which
  brought its biggest fire since 1949 under control on Sunday, authorities
  reported that one person had died in the blaze, while 20 firefighters and five
  civilians had been injured. French forecasters said heat records were likely
  to be broken on Monday and Tuesday as temperatures pass 42C in the south-west.
  Temperatures hit a record high of 41.4C in the village of Tourbes, near
  Béziers, at the weekend. In Spain, temperatures on Monday were expected to
  rise further in the Ebro basin, the southern and eastern thirds of the Iberian
  peninsula, and the eastern Cantabrian Sea. They were forecast to fall in the
  north-west, particularly in Galicia. In Italy, where temperatures of 40C are
  expected to hit Florence on Wednesday, tourist trails were closed on Mount
  Vesuvius on Sunday as firefighters fought a blaze on the slopes of the
  volcano. The world has warmed by about 1.4C because of fossil fuel pollution,
  which forms a heat-trapping blanket around the Earth, and the destruction of
  nature, which sucks carbon dioxide from the air. In Europe, which has warmed
  nearly twice as fast as the global average, a warm and dry air mass hanging
  over much of the Iberian peninsula and France has coincided with high levels
  of summer sunshine that have pushed temperatures even higher. As we are
  waiting for more updates on Ukraine – with EU foreign ministers set to meet in
  the next few hours – I am keeping an eye on the temperatures across the
  continent given the extreme heat warnings in parts of south-western Europe.
  Meteo France is reporting 38 Celsius – and more than 40 Celsius expected later
  today – in Toulouse and Bordeaux. Spain’s Aemet is showing 36-38 Celsius
  across large parts of the north of the country, with 39 Celsius in La Almunia
  de Doña Godina, and 38 Celsius in Zaragoza. Let’s cross to our Europe
  environment correspondent Ajit Niranjan for more. Meanwhile in France, the
  country’s president Emmanuel Macron warned that Israel’s plans to increase its
  military presence in Gaza amounted to “a disaster waiting to happen,” as he
  floated the idea of an international coalition with an UN mandate to help the
  territory, Reuters reported. For all the latest news on the situation in Gaza,
  follow our live blog here: Meanwhile, over in Finland, the country’s national
  prosecutor’s office said it has brought charges against the captain and first
  and second officers of the Eagle S oil tanker over cutting of undersea cables
  in the Gulf on Finland in December last year, Reuters reported. The three are
  suspected of aggravated criminal mischief and aggravated interference with
  communications, a statement by the prosecutor said. The prosecutor’s statement
  said the crew of the Cook Islands-registered Eagle S, which was carrying
  Russian oil in the Baltic Sea, are suspected of “cutting five submarine cables
  … by dragging … achor on the seabed for about 90 km.” It added that the
  incident caused a disruption to services and “at least” 60 million euros in
  damages. The Finnish customs service said at the time it had seized the
  vessel’s cargo and that the Eagle S was believed to belong to Russia’s
  so-called shadow fleet of ageing tankers that seek to evade sanctions on the
  sale of Russian oil. Back to Ukraine, the country’s president Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy has once again urged partners to step up pressure on Russia, saying
  it was “dragging out the war” and showed no interest in ending the war. In a
  post on social media channels, Zelenskyy said that “another week has ended
  without any attempt by Russia to agree to the numerous demands of the world
  and stop the killings.” Facing constant Russian attacks, “we are holding our
  positions and doing everything to destroy or drive out the occupier,”
  Zelenskyy said. We are defending the lives of our people and strengthening our
  air defences. This is what the situation in the war looks like. Turning to
  diplomacy, he said that “Russia refuses to stop the killings, and therefore
  must not receive any rewards or benefits.” This is not just a moral position –
  it is a rational one. Concessions do not persuade a killer. He reiterated that
  Ukraine was working with partners to “bring closer a genuine peace – peace
  through strength,” which he said was “the only kind of peace that can be
  achieved with Russia.” On France, AP noted that the red alert has been issued
  only eight times since it was created in 2004 after a deadly summer the year
  before. It is reserved for extreme, prolonged heat with major health risks and
  the potential to disrupt daily life. in Paris Twelve départements in the
  south-west of France were placed on the highest heatwave alert on Monday,
  including the Aude, Charente-Maritime, Dordogne and Lot. French forecasters
  said temperatures could exceed 42C in some places and it was likely that
  records would be broken. Separately, a swathe of France stretching from the
  Mediterranean coast up to the Jura was put on the second-highest heatwave
  alert. The health minister, Yannick Neuder, told BFMTV that Monday would be “a
  high risk day” and advised people to help those who were vulnerable. With
  parts of Europe on extreme heat alert today, let’s cross to Angelique
  Chrisafis for the latest from France. More than 100 former members of the
  European parliament have written to European Commission president Ursula von
  der Leyen and the EU’s chief diplomat Kaja Kallas urging them to suspend the
  EU-Israel association agreement. In a strongly worded letter they alleged the
  EU’s “failure” to take “robust action” against Israel over its actions in Gaza
  could expose member states to “complicity in war crimes”. The letter was
  signed by former MEPs across the political spectrum including those in the
  European Conservatives and Reformists, (ECR) which counts Giorgia Meloni’s
  party as a member; the conservative European People’s Party (EPP) group which
  put forward Von der Leyen as candidate to lead the EU, and the Greens and the
  Progressive Alliance of Socialists &amp; Democrats (S&amp;D) and ALDE/Renew
  centrist groups. “The current collective starvation of Gazans by the Israeli
  state is nothing short of a war crime. This violates the fundamental human
  rights on which all EU Association Agreements with third countries are based,”
  it says. They said: “We welcome the belated decision by the Commission on 28
  July to propose suspending Israel’s participation in the EU’s Horizon research
  programme. However, this is too little, too late. The Commission’s own review
  in June clearly showed Israel’s breach of Article 2 of the Agreement. In the
  absence of an end to the closure of border access to Gaza allowing unimpeded
  humanitarian access by the UN and associated NGOs we, as 110 former Members of
  the European Parliament, insist that the Commission urgently requests that
  Member States agree to fully suspend the EU-Israel Association Agreement. The
  Commission’s own review points to clear violations of the human rights clause
  of the agreement (Article 2).” As mentioned in the opening post, EU foreign
  ministers are meeting (virtually) later today to coordinate their next steps
  and present a united front. They will speak to Ukraine’s foreign ministry
  Andriy Sybiha at 3pm UK (4pm CEST), and carry on talking about other issues
  afterwards. Israel and the situation in Gaza is also on the agenda, so let’s
  cross to Lisa O’Carroll for the latest. Tusk says the US has pledged to
  consult with European partners before this Friday’s meeting with Putin. He
  adds that the importance of maintaining the integrity of Ukraine’s territory
  “is not just a matter of solidarity with our neighbour, but also of our own
  security.” He says he has “lots of fears and lots of hope” about the
  Trump-Putin meeting, as he notes Trump’s “tactic … of unpredictability at
  times, when it comes to various moves and actions.” He says that parts of
  Putin’s proposal on territory appear to be “one-sided” and it’s “difficult to
  see why it’s unacceptable” for Ukraine. That ends his press conference. Polish
  prime minister Donald Tusk is speaking right now, briefing the Polish media
  after this weekend’s consultations among European leaders, as he says they
  “remain united in their approach.” He says that “for Poland and our European
  partners, it must be clear that you cannot change borders with force,” and
  Russia must not be allowed to benefit from its invasion on Ukraine. “The West,
  including European countries, will not accept Russian demands which simply
  amount to the seizure of Ukrainian territory,” Tusk says. He warns against
  Russia getting the idea it can challenge other countries’ borders “with
  impunity.” Tusk also draws on Polish history to repeat the principle of
  “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.” “From history we know — and Poland
  has often been a victim of this — that when the great powers decided about
  other countries without the participation of those countries in negotiations,
  the consequences were grave.” in Kyiv It is unlikely that Vladimir Putin will
  arrive in Alaska on Friday to present Donald Trump with a territorial demand
  for the 49th state, sold by Tsar Alexander II to the US for $7.2m (£5.4m) in
  1867. The Russian president, after all, has another land deal on his mind – to
  persuade Trump of the merits of swapping parts of Ukrainian territory in
  return for him perhaps agreeing to the ceasefire the US president so
  desperately wants, but does not know how to get. Putin’s influential foreign
  affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov, said Alaska was an “entirely logical” location
  for the summit, as if the hop across the Bering Strait that divides the
  countries is a simple trip. The gap between the US and Russian mainlands may
  be 55 miles, but it is roughly a nine-hour flight from Moscow to Anchorage,
  Alaska’s largest city. Even for Trump, travelling from Washington DC on Air
  Force One, it will be not much less than eight hours. Alaska is a location of
  mutual inconvenience, which indicates that other factors are at play. The
  remote state is a long way from Ukraine and its European allies, and risks
  pushing both into the distant background. Though Trump seems open, in theory,
  to letting Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, attend, it is hard to
  imagine Putin being so welcoming. His prize, after all, are private talks with
  the occupant of the White House about sanctions, trade, the reach of Nato in
  Europe – negotiating tracks far beyond his latest proposals for dominating
  Ukraine. Above all, Alaska is a safe place for the Russian leader to visit.
  Putin is still wanted by the international criminal court, accused of war
  crimes in relation to the forced deportation of children from Ukraine to
  Russia in March 2023. There is an arrest warrant out, but neither Russia nor
  crucially the US recognise the court. Nor are there any unfriendly countries
  to overfly. A trip around the top of the globe is unlikely to run into
  unexpected difficulties that might make travelling over the Black Sea to
  Istanbul in Turkey unattractive. The Alaska meeting is only the fourth
  US-Russia summit since 2010 and, while it remains possible that the
  discussions will lead to a ceasefire in Ukraine, there are few grounds for
  optimism when the war continues to be fought so bitterly on the frontlines and
  in the rear, with Russia repeatedly bombing Ukrainian cities, trying to force
  its democratic neighbour into submission. The offer to thrash out a Ukrainian
  peace deal at a bilateral summit with Trump represents exactly the sort of
  great-power deal-making Putin has always craved. It will be his first trip to
  the US since 2007, with the exception of visits to the UN. Exactly how the
  Alaska summit will look is still unclear, with a particularly Trumpian kind of
  confusion and chaos accompanying its announcement. Kyiv, European capitals and
  even Trump’s own staff have been trying to understand what exactly was agreed
  in the Kremlin. As worrying for Kyiv as the planned format of the talks is the
  apparent Russian deal now on the table. The plan, as it has been reported
  after filtering through the Trump administration and then to European
  capitals, is that the Ukrainian army should unilaterally withdraw from the
  parts of Donetsk and Luhansk it still controls, which would presumably include
  the fortified military stronghold of Kramatorsk. In exchange, the Kremlin
  would agree to freeze the lines in other places. Zelenskyy’s public posture
  that Ukraine will never cede land is true up to a point. Kyiv is unlikely to
  renounce legal claims to its own territory, but the Ukrainian elite and much
  of Ukrainian society is increasingly ready for a deal that would recognise
  Russian de facto control, perhaps for a set period of time, in exchange for
  ending the fighting. The main problem with such a deal has always been what
  kind of guarantees Ukraine would receive that Russia would not simply use a
  ceasefire as time to regroup before attacking again. Brief discussions earlier
  this year about a European peacekeeping force to police a ceasefire were
  quickly scaled back to a “reassurance force” stationed far from the
  frontlines. Ukrainians would therefore have not much to rely on but Putin’s
  word, which they have learned from experience not to trust. Over the past few
  days, Zelenskyy and his team have been rallying support among European leaders
  and trying to put together an alternative, European plan. Unfortunately for
  Kyiv, previous experience suggests Trump is unwilling or unable to exert real
  pressure on Putin. “If Putin and Trump reach an agreement directly, Europe
  will be faced with a fait accompli. Kyiv – even more so,” said Roman Alekhin,
  a Russian war blogger, on Sunday. It is exactly that prospect Ukraine’s
  leadership will be doing their utmost to prevent in the days before Friday’s
  summit. A group of European leaders insisted over the weekend that “the path
  to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine” amid growing concerns
  about the US president Donald Trump’s plans to strike a deal with the Russian
  president, Vladimir Putin, when the pair meets in Alaska on Friday. A hastily
  arranged statement signed by the leaders of Finland, France, Germany, Italy,
  Poland, the UK, and the European Union reiterated that “a diplomatic solution
  must protect Ukraine’s and Europe’s vital security interests.” Speaking to the
  German broadcaster ARD, German chancellor Friedrich Merz said he hoped and
  assumed that Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, would also be involved
  in Friday’s summit in Alaska and that he made representations to Trump on this
  issue. “We cannot accept in any case that territorial questions are discussed
  or even decided between Russia and America over the heads of Europeans and
  Ukrainians,” he said. “I assume that the American government sees it the same
  way.” EU foreign ministers are meeting virtually for an emergency meeting
  today to discuss the next steps. On Sunday, Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy
  welcomed the support, saying on X: “The end of the war must be fair, and I am
  grateful to everyone who stands with Ukraine and our people today for the sake
  of peace in Ukraine, which is defending the vital security interests of our
  European nations. But there are still no guarantees as to what will happen
  next and what concessions Trump might be willing to agree to, leaving Kyiv and
  most European capitals deeply uncomfortable ahead of the summit on Friday, and
  they will want to use every minute to influence the US position. Let’s see
  what the day brings. Elsewhere, I will be also keeping an eye on another
  extreme heatwave in parts of Europe, with Spain and France among countries
  expecting to see temperatures close to or above 40 degrees Celsius once again.
  I will bring you all the key updates here. It’s Monday, 11 August 2025, it’s
  Jakub Krupa here, and this is Europe Live. Good morning.

… and on that note, it’s a wrap! US president Donald Trump said he was hoping for a “constructive” meeting to “feel out” the Russian position on Ukraine, claiming he “would know exactly” whether a deal could be made – but it wouldn’t be ultimately up to him to make it (16:44, 16:47). Trump expressed some annoyance with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy for his comments on the summit, but insisted he would talk to him about next steps and call him first after the meeting “out of respect.” He also confirmed plans to extensively consult with Ukraine and European leaders before the meeting (18:00). This comes after an earlier report from Berlin that Germany plans a phone call between a group of European leaders, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Trump and vice-president JD Vance on Wednesday, so the parties can coordinate before Trump’s meeting with Putin on Friday (16:21). The virtual call is expected to be attended by representatives of Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, the UK, as well as the EU and Nato, who will have a chat first before joining Trump and Vance (16:33). The move comes after growing calls from European leaders to not get excluded them from this Friday’s Trump-Putin summit in Alaska (15:43), with Polish prime minister Donald Tusk revealing earlier that the US promised to consult the Europeans before the meeting (11:25). EU foreign ministers are meeting this afternoon to discuss the issue and the bloc’s position before the talks. In other news, Large parts of south-western Europe were seeing extreme temperatures on Monday, with growing concerns about possible further wildfires (12:15, 13:57, 14:01, 14:11, 14:13, 15:19). Finland’s national prosecutor’s office said it has brought charges against the captain and first and second officers of the Eagle S oil tanker over cutting of undersea cables in the Gulf on Finland in December last year (13:20). French president Emmanuel Macron has warned that Israel’s plans to increase its military presence in Gaza amounted to “a disaster waiting to happen” (13:39). And that’s all from me, Jakub Krupa, for today. Have a great weekend! If you have any tips, comments or suggestions, email me at jakub.krupa@theguardian.com. I am also on Bluesky at @jakubkrupa.bsky.social and on X at @jakubkrupa. And Trump has just confirmed that he will be talking to the European leaders before his meeting with Putin, too. He praises them as “great people, great leaders,” but claims they are “tired” of the war and “want to get back to spending money on their countries.” He says he shas “extremely good” relationship with European leaders and confirms he will be taking to them, making a joke that there are “a lot of European leaders, but they rely on me.” “So I’m talking to the European leaders, I’ll be talking to President Zelenskyy. I’m going to get everybody’s ideas. I go into that thing fully loaded right up there, and we’re going to see what happens. Now, I think one of two things is going to happen. It could be a good meeting, and we’ll go a step further. We’ll get it done. I’d like to see a ceasefire very, very quickly, very quick. I’d like to see it immediately … And [so] we’re going to be dealing with the European leaders, and we’re going to be dealing with President Zelenskyy, and hopefully we’re going to have a great success.” Explaining his plan to end the war, Trump sums it up as: “Ultimately, I’m going to put the two of them in a room, I’ll be there or won’t be there, and I think it’ll get solved.” Asked if he can imagine a return to normal trade with Russia, Trump says: “I do. Russia has a very valuable piece of land if Vladimir Putin would go toward business instead of toward war.” Back to Trump, he just got asked about Zelenskyy’s attendance in the summit on Friday, and said “I would say he could go, but he’s gone to a lot of meetings.” He then added: “Well, we’re going to have a meeting with Vladimir Putin, and at the end of that meeting, probably in the first two minutes, I’ll know exactly whether or not a deal can be [made].” Asked why he was so confident about it, he replied: Because that’s what I do. I make deals. Separately, the Élysée Palace has confirmed plans for the call with Trump, with another call with the coalition of the willing. Speaking in the White House in the last few minutes, US president Donald Trump has claimed his meeting with Putin will “a feel out meeting,” but he thought that the Russian president “wants to get it over with.” He says: “I’m going in to speak to Vladimir Putin, and I’m going to be telling him, you have got to end this war, you got to end it.” He says he hopes for “a constructive” conversation with the Russian president, and says he will call the European leaders to debrief them on the chat shortly after leaving the room. He then says: “Then after that meeting, immediately, maybe as I’m flying out, maybe as I’m leaving the room, I I’ll be calling the European leaders who I get along with very well. And you know, I have a great relationship, I think, with all of them, and I get along with Zelensky, but, you know, I disagree with what he’s done, very, very severely disagree. This is a war that should have never happened … but I’ll be speaking to Zelensky. The next meeting will be with Zelensky and Putin, or Zelensky, and Putin to me I’ll be there if they need me.” He expressed some frustration with Zelenskyy again, saying: “I was a little bothered by the fact that Zelensky was saying, Well, I have to get constitutional approval. I mean, he’s got approval to go into war and kill everybody, but he needs approval to do a land swap? Because there’ll be some land swapping going on. I know that through Russia and through conversations with everybody to the good for the good of Ukraine, good stuff, not bad stuff, also some bad stuff for both. So it’s good and there’s bad, but it’s very complex, because you have lines that are very uneven. And there’ll be some swapping, there’ll be some changes in land.” He makes it clear he can negotiate the deal, but it will be up to Ukraine to accept or reject it. “I’m going to meet with him [Putin]. We’re going to see what the parameters are, and then I’m going to call up President Zelensky and the European leaders … and I’m going to tell them what kind of a deal. I’m not going to make a deal. It’s not up to me to make a deal. I think a deal should be made for both.” Ultimately, he says “I’d like to see a cease fire.” I’d like to see the best deal that could be made for both parties. You know, it takes two to tango, right? When it comes to timing of the expected Europe-Trump call, we’re expecting the internal European call at midday GMT (so 1pm BST, 2pm CEST), followed an hour later by a separate call with Trump and Vance. The so-called coalition of the willing is then expected to have another call later in the afternoon to consult on the next steps. Looks like a phone call between European leaders, Ukraine’s Zelenskyy and Trump could already be in the calendar, as the parties are keen to coordinate before Trump’s meeting with Putin on Friday. Germany said in the last few minutes that chancellor Friedrich Merz will host “virtual talks” between EU leaders – the leaders of the six nations that signed the joint statement over the weekend, so Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, the UK (9:57) – who will be joined by the EU’s presidents von der Leyen and Costa and Nato’s secretary general Mark Rutte to speak with Zelenskyy, before joining a separate call with Trump and his vice-president, JD Vance. A statement by Merz’s office said the talks will focus on “further options for exerting pressure on Russia” and “the preparation of possible peace negotiations,” including “related issues of territorial claims and security.” The news of the call was first reported by the German press, including Welt and Süddeutsche Zeitung, and Politico. The EU ministerial meeting was scheduled to start around now, and it may not be before very late afternoon, early evening before we hear from the EU on the outcomes of the talks behind the closed doors. European leaders claiming Russia represents an existential threat to their continent are pushing for consultations with Donald Trump to spell out Europe’s red lines before his meeting with Vladimir Putin to discuss the Ukraine war on Friday in Alaska. The call for formal consultations is one of the outcomes expected from an emergency virtual meeting of EU foreign ministers convened by the EU external affairs chief, Kaja Kallas, on Monday. The meeting is also expected to demand that Russia agree to a ceasefire and hold talks with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Kallas, in advance of the EU meeting, insisted: “President Trump is right to say that Russia must end its war against Ukraine. The United States has the power to force Russia to negotiate seriously.” But, she said, “any agreement between the United States and Russia must include Ukraine and the EU because it is a security issue for Ukraine and for the whole of Europe.” Radosław Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, also asserted Europe’s relevance, saying: “Europe is paying for Ukraine to defend itself and we are sustaining the Ukrainian state. This is a matter of existential European security interests. We appreciate President Trump’s efforts but we will be taking our own decisions here in Europe. To get to a fair peace, Russia has to limit its war aims. The White House is insisting that the Alaska meeting is to gauge whether Putin is willing to make concessions for peace, including on accepting western security guarantees for Ukraine, an acceptance that would acknowledge the long-term legitimacy of the Kyiv government led by Zelenskyy. Trump, increasingly impatient with the Russian leader in recent months, has long said he does not see a ceasefire occurring until he meets Putin in person. In a post on X on Monday afternoon, Spain’s state meteorological office, Aemet, said temperatures in the Guadalquivir valley in Andalucía could reach 44C on Tuesday. “Although there will be a thermal decrease on Wednesday, the intense heat is likely to continue for the rest of the week,” it added. “Temperatures could rise again on Thursday and the heatwave could last a few more days.” Aemet has issued a red weather warning for the province of Seville on Tuesday, with orange warnings issued for large parts of the country, including most of Andalucia, as well as Madrid, Extremadura and parts of Navarra, the Basque Country, Aragón and Cataluña. We are getting some news lines from today’s Downing Street press briefing, with the UK prime minister’s official spokesman responding to journalists’ questions on Ukraine. Asked if Putin could be trusted, Starmer’s spokesperson said, via PA: “Never trust President Putin as far as you could throw him, but we obviously will support Ukraine. We will obviously support President Trump and European nations as we enter these negotiations.” He added: “We’re not going to leave it to trust. We’re going to ensure that we’re prepared such that we achieve a ceasefire. The coalition of willing and the security guarantees are in place... that learns the lessons of the past, where we clearly have not had those meaningful security guarantees in place, which did allow President Putin to re-arm and go again.” Reuters added that the spokesperson insisted that Ukraine’s borders are only for Ukraine to determine, and any peace deal must be built with its involvement. In fact, some parts of south-eastern Europe were already facing extreme conditions over the weekend, with wildfires raging in Albania, reportedly forcing evacuations and destroying homes in rural communities. AFP reported that over a dozen fires were active in the Balkan nation, after hundreds of firefighters and soldiers controlled most of nearly 40 fires that flared in the last 24 hours, according to the defence ministry. Around 800 Albanian troops have been deployed, along with military aircraft and helicopters from surrounding countries, to battle the wildfires. Several parts of the Balkans are tipped to climb above 40C this week, as a heatwave sweeps the region, with some of the highest temperatures expected in Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia. Brendan Wood for the MetDesk After a period of cooler weather, swaths of central and eastern Europe face another heatwave as hot air over south-western Europe pushes north-west. Since late July, large parts of the Iberian peninsula have endured persistent heat, with temperatures frequently climbing to the high 30s to low 40s celsius. With southern and south-western Europe already enduring intense heat, the arrival of this warm air into central and eastern parts is likely to mark the start of a widespread hot spell that could persist for several days. Deadly heat of up to 42C is searing southern Europe, as scientists warn of a “molotov cocktail” of climatic conditions that is fuelling vast wildfires across the Mediterranean. Météo-France placed more than half the country under heatwave warnings on Monday morning, with 12 out of 96 administrative units on the mainland under the highest red alert, while Spain’s Aemet warned of “extreme danger” in Zaragoza and the Basque Country as it issued yellow and orange warnings for almost all the rest of the country. Both weather agencies forecast temperatures above 40C over the coming days and called for vigilance amid forecasts of “a very intense, even exceptional” heatwave in parts of the continent. The high temperatures have alarmed experts as firefighters struggle to contain destructive wildfires. In France, which brought its biggest fire since 1949 under control on Sunday, authorities reported that one person had died in the blaze, while 20 firefighters and five civilians had been injured. French forecasters said heat records were likely to be broken on Monday and Tuesday as temperatures pass 42C in the south-west. Temperatures hit a record high of 41.4C in the village of Tourbes, near Béziers, at the weekend. In Spain, temperatures on Monday were expected to rise further in the Ebro basin, the southern and eastern thirds of the Iberian peninsula, and the eastern Cantabrian Sea. They were forecast to fall in the north-west, particularly in Galicia. In Italy, where temperatures of 40C are expected to hit Florence on Wednesday, tourist trails were closed on Mount Vesuvius on Sunday as firefighters fought a blaze on the slopes of the volcano. The world has warmed by about 1.4C because of fossil fuel pollution, which forms a heat-trapping blanket around the Earth, and the destruction of nature, which sucks carbon dioxide from the air. In Europe, which has warmed nearly twice as fast as the global average, a warm and dry air mass hanging over much of the Iberian peninsula and France has coincided with high levels of summer sunshine that have pushed temperatures even higher. As we are waiting for more updates on Ukraine – with EU foreign ministers set to meet in the next few hours – I am keeping an eye on the temperatures across the continent given the extreme heat warnings in parts of south-western Europe. Meteo France is reporting 38 Celsius – and more than 40 Celsius expected later today – in Toulouse and Bordeaux. Spain’s Aemet is showing 36-38 Celsius across large parts of the north of the country, with 39 Celsius in La Almunia de Doña Godina, and 38 Celsius in Zaragoza. Let’s cross to our Europe environment correspondent Ajit Niranjan for more. Meanwhile in France, the country’s president Emmanuel Macron warned that Israel’s plans to increase its military presence in Gaza amounted to “a disaster waiting to happen,” as he floated the idea of an international coalition with an UN mandate to help the territory, Reuters reported. For all the latest news on the situation in Gaza, follow our live blog here: Meanwhile, over in Finland, the country’s national prosecutor’s office said it has brought charges against the captain and first and second officers of the Eagle S oil tanker over cutting of undersea cables in the Gulf on Finland in December last year, Reuters reported. The three are suspected of aggravated criminal mischief and aggravated interference with communications, a statement by the prosecutor said. The prosecutor’s statement said the crew of the Cook Islands-registered Eagle S, which was carrying Russian oil in the Baltic Sea, are suspected of “cutting five submarine cables … by dragging … achor on the seabed for about 90 km.” It added that the incident caused a disruption to services and “at least” 60 million euros in damages. The Finnish customs service said at the time it had seized the vessel’s cargo and that the Eagle S was believed to belong to Russia’s so-called shadow fleet of ageing tankers that seek to evade sanctions on the sale of Russian oil. Back to Ukraine, the country’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has once again urged partners to step up pressure on Russia, saying it was “dragging out the war” and showed no interest in ending the war. In a post on social media channels, Zelenskyy said that “another week has ended without any attempt by Russia to agree to the numerous demands of the world and stop the killings.” Facing constant Russian attacks, “we are holding our positions and doing everything to destroy or drive out the occupier,” Zelenskyy said. We are defending the lives of our people and strengthening our air defences. This is what the situation in the war looks like. Turning to diplomacy, he said that “Russia refuses to stop the killings, and therefore must not receive any rewards or benefits.” This is not just a moral position – it is a rational one. Concessions do not persuade a killer. He reiterated that Ukraine was working with partners to “bring closer a genuine peace – peace through strength,” which he said was “the only kind of peace that can be achieved with Russia.” On France, AP noted that the red alert has been issued only eight times since it was created in 2004 after a deadly summer the year before. It is reserved for extreme, prolonged heat with major health risks and the potential to disrupt daily life. in Paris Twelve départements in the south-west of France were placed on the highest heatwave alert on Monday, including the Aude, Charente-Maritime, Dordogne and Lot. French forecasters said temperatures could exceed 42C in some places and it was likely that records would be broken. Separately, a swathe of France stretching from the Mediterranean coast up to the Jura was put on the second-highest heatwave alert. The health minister, Yannick Neuder, told BFMTV that Monday would be “a high risk day” and advised people to help those who were vulnerable. With parts of Europe on extreme heat alert today, let’s cross to Angelique Chrisafis for the latest from France. More than 100 former members of the European parliament have written to European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and the EU’s chief diplomat Kaja Kallas urging them to suspend the EU-Israel association agreement. In a strongly worded letter they alleged the EU’s “failure” to take “robust action” against Israel over its actions in Gaza could expose member states to “complicity in war crimes”. The letter was signed by former MEPs across the political spectrum including those in the European Conservatives and Reformists, (ECR) which counts Giorgia Meloni’s party as a member; the conservative European People’s Party (EPP) group which put forward Von der Leyen as candidate to lead the EU, and the Greens and the Progressive Alliance of Socialists &amp; Democrats (S&amp;D) and ALDE/Renew centrist groups. “The current collective starvation of Gazans by the Israeli state is nothing short of a war crime. This violates the fundamental human rights on which all EU Association Agreements with third countries are based,” it says. They said: “We welcome the belated decision by the Commission on 28 July to propose suspending Israel’s participation in the EU’s Horizon research programme. However, this is too little, too late. The Commission’s own review in June clearly showed Israel’s breach of Article 2 of the Agreement. In the absence of an end to the closure of border access to Gaza allowing unimpeded humanitarian access by the UN and associated NGOs we, as 110 former Members of the European Parliament, insist that the Commission urgently requests that Member States agree to fully suspend the EU-Israel Association Agreement. The Commission’s own review points to clear violations of the human rights clause of the agreement (Article 2).” As mentioned in the opening post, EU foreign ministers are meeting (virtually) later today to coordinate their next steps and present a united front. They will speak to Ukraine’s foreign ministry Andriy Sybiha at 3pm UK (4pm CEST), and carry on talking about other issues afterwards. Israel and the situation in Gaza is also on the agenda, so let’s cross to Lisa O’Carroll for the latest. Tusk says the US has pledged to consult with European partners before this Friday’s meeting with Putin. He adds that the importance of maintaining the integrity of Ukraine’s territory “is not just a matter of solidarity with our neighbour, but also of our own security.” He says he has “lots of fears and lots of hope” about the Trump-Putin meeting, as he notes Trump’s “tactic … of unpredictability at times, when it comes to various moves and actions.” He says that parts of Putin’s proposal on territory appear to be “one-sided” and it’s “difficult to see why it’s unacceptable” for Ukraine. That ends his press conference. Polish prime minister Donald Tusk is speaking right now, briefing the Polish media after this weekend’s consultations among European leaders, as he says they “remain united in their approach.” He says that “for Poland and our European partners, it must be clear that you cannot change borders with force,” and Russia must not be allowed to benefit from its invasion on Ukraine. “The West, including European countries, will not accept Russian demands which simply amount to the seizure of Ukrainian territory,” Tusk says. He warns against Russia getting the idea it can challenge other countries’ borders “with impunity.” Tusk also draws on Polish history to repeat the principle of “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.” “From history we know — and Poland has often been a victim of this — that when the great powers decided about other countries without the participation of those countries in negotiations, the consequences were grave.” in Kyiv It is unlikely that Vladimir Putin will arrive in Alaska on Friday to present Donald Trump with a territorial demand for the 49th state, sold by Tsar Alexander II to the US for $7.2m (£5.4m) in 1867. The Russian president, after all, has another land deal on his mind – to persuade Trump of the merits of swapping parts of Ukrainian territory in return for him perhaps agreeing to the ceasefire the US president so desperately wants, but does not know how to get. Putin’s influential foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov, said Alaska was an “entirely logical” location for the summit, as if the hop across the Bering Strait that divides the countries is a simple trip. The gap between the US and Russian mainlands may be 55 miles, but it is roughly a nine-hour flight from Moscow to Anchorage, Alaska’s largest city. Even for Trump, travelling from Washington DC on Air Force One, it will be not much less than eight hours. Alaska is a location of mutual inconvenience, which indicates that other factors are at play. The remote state is a long way from Ukraine and its European allies, and risks pushing both into the distant background. Though Trump seems open, in theory, to letting Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, attend, it is hard to imagine Putin being so welcoming. His prize, after all, are private talks with the occupant of the White House about sanctions, trade, the reach of Nato in Europe – negotiating tracks far beyond his latest proposals for dominating Ukraine. Above all, Alaska is a safe place for the Russian leader to visit. Putin is still wanted by the international criminal court, accused of war crimes in relation to the forced deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia in March 2023. There is an arrest warrant out, but neither Russia nor crucially the US recognise the court. Nor are there any unfriendly countries to overfly. A trip around the top of the globe is unlikely to run into unexpected difficulties that might make travelling over the Black Sea to Istanbul in Turkey unattractive. The Alaska meeting is only the fourth US-Russia summit since 2010 and, while it remains possible that the discussions will lead to a ceasefire in Ukraine, there are few grounds for optimism when the war continues to be fought so bitterly on the frontlines and in the rear, with Russia repeatedly bombing Ukrainian cities, trying to force its democratic neighbour into submission. The offer to thrash out a Ukrainian peace deal at a bilateral summit with Trump represents exactly the sort of great-power deal-making Putin has always craved. It will be his first trip to the US since 2007, with the exception of visits to the UN. Exactly how the Alaska summit will look is still unclear, with a particularly Trumpian kind of confusion and chaos accompanying its announcement. Kyiv, European capitals and even Trump’s own staff have been trying to understand what exactly was agreed in the Kremlin. As worrying for Kyiv as the planned format of the talks is the apparent Russian deal now on the table. The plan, as it has been reported after filtering through the Trump administration and then to European capitals, is that the Ukrainian army should unilaterally withdraw from the parts of Donetsk and Luhansk it still controls, which would presumably include the fortified military stronghold of Kramatorsk. In exchange, the Kremlin would agree to freeze the lines in other places. Zelenskyy’s public posture that Ukraine will never cede land is true up to a point. Kyiv is unlikely to renounce legal claims to its own territory, but the Ukrainian elite and much of Ukrainian society is increasingly ready for a deal that would recognise Russian de facto control, perhaps for a set period of time, in exchange for ending the fighting. The main problem with such a deal has always been what kind of guarantees Ukraine would receive that Russia would not simply use a ceasefire as time to regroup before attacking again. Brief discussions earlier this year about a European peacekeeping force to police a ceasefire were quickly scaled back to a “reassurance force” stationed far from the frontlines. Ukrainians would therefore have not much to rely on but Putin’s word, which they have learned from experience not to trust. Over the past few days, Zelenskyy and his team have been rallying support among European leaders and trying to put together an alternative, European plan. Unfortunately for Kyiv, previous experience suggests Trump is unwilling or unable to exert real pressure on Putin. “If Putin and Trump reach an agreement directly, Europe will be faced with a fait accompli. Kyiv – even more so,” said Roman Alekhin, a Russian war blogger, on Sunday. It is exactly that prospect Ukraine’s leadership will be doing their utmost to prevent in the days before Friday’s summit. A group of European leaders insisted over the weekend that “the path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine” amid growing concerns about the US president Donald Trump’s plans to strike a deal with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, when the pair meets in Alaska on Friday. A hastily arranged statement signed by the leaders of Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, the UK, and the European Union reiterated that “a diplomatic solution must protect Ukraine’s and Europe’s vital security interests.” Speaking to the German broadcaster ARD, German chancellor Friedrich Merz said he hoped and assumed that Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, would also be involved in Friday’s summit in Alaska and that he made representations to Trump on this issue. “We cannot accept in any case that territorial questions are discussed or even decided between Russia and America over the heads of Europeans and Ukrainians,” he said. “I assume that the American government sees it the same way.” EU foreign ministers are meeting virtually for an emergency meeting today to discuss the next steps. On Sunday, Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed the support, saying on X: “The end of the war must be fair, and I am grateful to everyone who stands with Ukraine and our people today for the sake of peace in Ukraine, which is defending the vital security interests of our European nations. But there are still no guarantees as to what will happen next and what concessions Trump might be willing to agree to, leaving Kyiv and most European capitals deeply uncomfortable ahead of the summit on Friday, and they will want to use every minute to influence the US position. Let’s see what the day brings. Elsewhere, I will be also keeping an eye on another extreme heatwave in parts of Europe, with Spain and France among countries expecting to see temperatures close to or above 40 degrees Celsius once again. I will bring you all the key updates here. It’s Monday, 11 August 2025, it’s Jakub Krupa here, and this is Europe Live. Good morning.
