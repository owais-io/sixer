  Glory for Manchester United, who lifted the Premier League summer series on
  Sunday despite twice being pegged back by Everton to draw 2-2 in Atlanta. A
  degree of relief for West Ham, who beat Bournemouth to finish second in the
  competition despite all the gloomy prognostications about their campaign to
  come. In Seoul, meanwhile, there was a very Tottenham moment as they followed
  the glee of last week’s 1-0 win over Arsenal with a 1-1 draw against Newcastle
  in which James Maddison was stretchered off with a knee injury described by
  his manager Thomas Frank as “bad”. It all looks real, it sounds real and yet
  everybody knows it isn’t real. That even now, in this age of data and minute
  analysis, there remains an element of randomness, is one of soccer’s great
  joys as a sport. But that tendency is magnified in pre-season. The Premier
  League has been away for 10 weeks now. For those hooked on its soap opera, the
  wait is intolerable. The Club World Cup, the England men’s team being dreadful
  in June as they so often are, the Under-21s continuing their unfamiliar
  excellence, even the women’s Euros … none of it quite offers the same hit.
  Obsessing over transfers suffices only for so long; eventually there is a need
  to see them play. And so there are pre-season games, and there is is analysis.
  The best of it is skeptical, acknowledging the absurdity of making judgements
  on 45 minutes. The worst of it is breathlessly insistent – of Bryan Mbeumo and
  Matheus Cunha, the two senior players United have managed to sign, appearing
  together against Everton. What does it mean that Rasmus Højlund was only on
  the bench? Does that mean Benjamin Šeško is more likely to sign? The front
  three, with Mbeumo dropping deep and Cunha and Bruno Fernandes at times
  running beyond him, looked fluent. Fernandes and Mbuemo set up Amad Diallo,
  overlapping from wing-back to score the opener. This is the way Ruben Amorim’s
  3-4-3 is supposed to work. In that, at least, there is a sense of something
  tangible, a United that is, at last, able to execute their manager’s attacking
  plan. But Ayden Heaven’s own goal was a reminder that United remain as
  self-destructive as ever. Perhaps more significant was the equaliser conceded
  after Manuel Ugarte lost possession, the lack of urgency to get back. Did this
  happen because it was only a friendly and United are nowhere near peak fitness
  yet? Or because this is an irredeemably feckless bunch of players? This is
  smoke on a foggy day. Will any of it be relevant when the season begins for
  real? United fans will remember ruefully just how good they looked in
  pre-season under Louis van Gaal in 2014, only for the season itself to prove
  anticlimactic. The problem with assessing pre-season games is that different
  sides are at different stages of readiness. Some expect to hit the ground
  running from week one; others are building to peak in March or April, the
  differences magnified two weeks before the opening day. Some managers are
  working on specific plans and are less bothered by the whole, some are just
  hoping to get semi-competitive minutes into their players’ legs. In the old
  days, before Premier League teams went on foreign tours and everybody was
  desperately promoting themselves to a global audience, pre-season was about
  team bonding as much as anything else: the team that drinks together wins
  together, as the adage had it. The stories are legion: the Everton winger
  Peter Beagrie driving a motorbike through a plateglass window in San
  Sebastián; Sunderland’s diminutive but extremely tough full-back John Kay
  terrifying a much larger local who had threatened him by casually eating the
  antiseptic cubes from a urinal in Bristol; Arsenal’s French midfielder Gilles
  Grimandi joining five of his English teammates on a night out in Switzerland
  where the first round comprised 35 pints of lager and a dry white wine. Many
  managers, you suspect, would quite relish a return to the days, if not of
  booze, then at least of pre-season being a largely private affair rather than
  a projection of the club to the world. Very occasionally something
  consequential happens, such as Chelsea conceding four in the second half to an
  experimental New York Red Bulls led by Jesse Marsch in the summer of 2015, the
  first sign that something had gone badly wrong for José Mourinho’s side since
  winning the Premier League two months earlier; within five months, Mourinho
  had been sacked. (It was also the debut first-team appearance for Bournemouth
  and US national team midfielder Tyler Adams, then 16 years old.) Pre-season is
  very much the phoney war, the jockeying, the probing. It matters to the clubs,
  but to outsiders it is essentially like watching an artist mix his paints.
  There’s anticipation and a vague technical interest, but it means nothing
  until it starts being applied to the canvas. This is an extract from Soccer
