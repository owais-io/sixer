  A fire broke out in the historic mosque-turned-cathedral in Córdoba on Friday
  but the monument was saved as firefighters quickly contained the blaze, the
  Spanish city’s mayor has said. Widely shared videos had shown flames and smoke
  billowing from inside the tourist attraction visited by 2 million people a
  year. “The monument is saved. There will be no spread, it will not be a
  catastrophe, let’s put it that way,” José María Bellido said on Cadena
  television. The fire brigade had earlier said the fire was under control but
  not extinguished. The spectacular blaze broke out at about 9pm (8pm UK time),
  raising fears for the early medieval architectural gem and evoking memories of
  the 2019 fire that ravaged Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. ABC and other
  newspapers reported that a mechanical sweeping machine had caught fire on the
  site. Considered a jewel of Islamic architecture, the site was built as a
  mosque – on the site of an earlier church – between the 8th and 10th centuries
  by the southern city’s then Muslim ruler, Abd al-Rahman, an emir of the
  Umayyad dynasty. After Christians reconquered Spain in the 13th century under
  King Ferdinand III of Castile, it was converted into a cathedral and
  architectural alterations were made over following centuries.
