  Polly Toynbee is right to point out that while nuclear war has been pushed
  down the “league table of fear”, most recently by concerns about the climate
  crisis, the nuclear threat itself remains “as great or greater” and should be
  the subject of much more urgent debate (I changed my mind on banning the bomb,
  but the threat of nuclear war is growing – and so is complacency, 7 August).
  All the more surprising, then, that she overlooks some of the more promising
  steps towards nuclear disarmament. In particular, momentum is building behind
  the UN treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons, which came into force in
  2021 and is now supported by nearly half the countries in the world. The
  treaty was the focus of much of the debate in Hiroshima, where I attended the
  80th anniversary commemorations, and it deserves to be much better known. How
  disappointing, then, that the UK government is not only failing to support it
  but is actively trying to suppress information about the impact of nuclear war
  as one of just three countries to vote against the creation of a UN scientific
  panel on its effects. Instead, it’s choosing to accept a recommendation from
  the recent strategic defence review to run a PR campaign to convince people of
  the “necessity” of a growing nuclear arsenal. If we are to have any success in
  challenging this, we need to promote a public education campaign that sets out
  the existential threat posed by nuclear weapons, the flaws in so-called
  deterrence theory and measures that could immediately reduce risk – taking
  weapons off hair-trigger alert, for example, and joining China in a “no first
  use” policy. Recent polling from More in Common suggests that young people
  believe nuclear conflict is the greatest threat to Britain. We owe it to them
  not to give up. Caroline Lucas Vice-president, Campaign for Nuclear
  Disarmament; former Green party MP • I normally agree with Polly Toynbee, and
  was also on the Aldermaston marches as a child, but she is misguided in
  believing that a joint European nuclear capability would make us safer from
  Russian aggression. If Russian tanks were to roll into Poland, does she
  envisage Europe threatening to take out Moscow? If so, I hope that it would be
  an empty threat and hence useless; if a real threat, we are on the road to
  Armageddon. Maybe it would deter a nuclear attack or threat, but is such a
  situation conceivable? After all, Vladimir Putin could launch a nuclear attack
  on Ukraine, which has no nuclear umbrella. The more places that have such
  weapons, the more the risk of misjudged situations. In practice, the nuclear
  option is useless, unsafe and costly, as well as immoral. Gerry Weston
  Willesden Green, London • The dangerous myth that the nuclear bombing of
  Hiroshima ended the Pacific war is perpetuated in all the coverage of its 80th
  anniversary. When I attended an intensive summer course with my students,
  organised by Hiroshima City University in 2005, we discussed the evidence
  against this contention. Subsequently, Tsuyoshi Hasegawa, in his book Racing
  the Enemy: Stalin, Truman, and the Surrender of Japan, laid out the
  overwhelming evidence that it was the Soviet entry into the war that finally
  forced the surrender. Nuclear weapons kill people and may destroy the planet –
  they do not end war. Michael Newman Emeritus professor, London Metropolitan
