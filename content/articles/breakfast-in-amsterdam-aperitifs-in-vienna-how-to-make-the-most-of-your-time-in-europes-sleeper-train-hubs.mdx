  in Europe’s sleeper train hubs

  You may dash for your morning commuter train, but you won’t want to rush for
  the sleeper to Vienna. The Nightjet train to the Austrian capital is the most
  illustrious departure of the day from Amsterdam. There is an art to conducting
  the perfect departure and the perfect arrival, the bookends of a thrilling
  overnight journey. There are four major hubs for sleeper services across
  western and central Europe: Amsterdam, Berlin, Vienna and Zurich. Then there
  are secondary nodes at Budapest, Brussels, Milan, Munich, Paris and Prague.
  Most of the region’s night trains start or end in one of these 10 cities.
  Whatever your departure point, savour the moment by going for an aperitif and
  a relaxed dinner before boarding. And upon arrival, don’t just dash on –
  linger over a coffee and let the morning, and the city, develop around you.
  Amsterdam Centraal For ÖBB Nightjets to Basel, Innsbruck, Munich, Vienna and
  Zurich; and European Sleeper to Berlin, Dresden and Prague Don’t miss the
  excellent Grand Café Restaurant 1e Klas in the former first-class waiting room
  (entrance via platform 2B). It opens at 9.30am, so the perfect spot for
  breakfast after decanting from a Nightjet (or an early-morning Eurostar from
  London), and stays open till late evening, so also ideal for pre-departure
  supper. It serves fairly priced Dutch staples in a space that oozes retro
  flair. The Guardian, no less, has called it one of the “finest station
  eateries in Europe”. An alternative pre-departure option for drinks and dinner
  is Bistro Berlage in the undercroft of the former Beurs (stock exchange),
  seven minutes walk from the station. This can be a frustrating station, with
  fierce ticket barriers guarding platform access (luggage lockers in the east
  wing from €10 per day). It gets another black mark for the lack of showers for
  passengers arriving on overnight trains, but a big plus for being at the very
  heart of the city it serves – its enchanted canal network is right outside the
  station. Just head south from the station to hit the main sights. If, like me,
  you prefer to cut away from the crowds, then leave the station on the north
  side and hop on the F4 ferry for a free 15-minute ride to the NSDM Wharf, an
  old shipyard that is now a creative and cultural hub with many alt-vibe cafes.
  Berlin Hauptbahnhof For ÖBB Nightjets to Basel, Graz, Paris, Vienna and
  Zurich; SJ/RDC or Snälltåget to Stockholm; MÁV Euronight to Bratislava, Prague
  and Budapest; European Sleeper to Amsterdam and Brussels; and, from later this
  year, PKPIC night sleepers to Chelm and Przemyśl in eastern Poland A
  multi-level essay in glass with a striking vaulted roof, the station is on
  five levels, with level 0 in the middle and trains departing/arriving on
  levels -2 and +2 – all utterly confusing for a first-timer. The station isn’t
  the most relaxing spot to linger, but for the exalted few, Deutsche Bahn’s
  premium (first-class) lounge is an oasis of calm. For an extraordinary
  breakfast in a stunning setting, book a table at Käfer on the roof terrace of
  the Reichstag (900 metres from station, open daily from 9am). For a posh
  pre-departure dinner, Paris-Moskau at Alt-Moabit 141 (open from 6pm) is a
  traditional Berlin restaurant in a half-timbered building just 400 metres
  away. With time on your hands, catch the vibe of the German capital by
  wandering along the banks of the River Spree, passing the Reichstag en route
  to the Brandenburg Gate. Leave luggage at the DB Gepäck lockers (levels -1 and
  +1, from €2 for two hours or €4 a day). Shower for a fee at the “rail and
  fresh” facility on level 0. Vienna Hauptbahnhof For ÖBB Nightjets to
  Amsterdam, Berlin, Bregenz, Brussels, Cologne, Dresden, Hamburg, Hanover,
  Milan, Paris, Venice and Zurich (also until late September, additionally with
  ÖBB Nightjets to Florence, Rome and Verona); for Euronight to Kraków,
  Stuttgart and Warsaw; and other operators to Bucharest, Braşov, Kyiv and Lviv,
  plus summer-season overnight trains to Rijeka and Split Fully opened 10 years
  ago, Vienna’s Hauptbahnhof rates as one of Europe’s most efficient transport
  hubs and boasts a greater range of destinations than any other station in
  Europe. For a relaxed breakfast, skip the fast-food options in the station and
  head for Café Goldegg, with its elegant wood panelling and art nouveau style
  (on corner of Goldeggasse and Argentinierstrasse). Ask nicely and they’ll even
  knock you up a full English. For evening eats, I recently followed the advice
  of Mark Smith, the legendary Man in Seat 61, and tried the excellent Ringsmuth
  at Johannitergasse 1 (closed Sun and Mon), a traditional Viennese restaurant
  with schnitzel galore as well as fish and veggie options. Vienna Hauptbahnhof
  is south of the city centre. Three stops north on the U1 metro is
  Stephansplatz, where you can cleanse your soul at the lovely St Stephens
  Cathedral. Or go two stops south on the U1 to Reumannplatz to cleanse the body
  in art deco elegance at the wonderful Amelienbad indoor pool – a triumph of
  progressive socialist design. A visit will help make up for the lack of
  showers at the railway station for those arriving on night trains (but there
  are luggage lockers aplenty, from €2). Zurich Hauptbahnhof For ÖBB Nightjets
  to Amsterdam, Berlin, Bremen, Cologne, Graz, Hamburg and Vienna; and Euronight
  to Budapest, Dresden, Ljubljana, Prague and Zagreb Zurich’s main station is a
  place for grand arrivals – check out the colourful flying angel pivoting over
  the concourse. Then freshen up with a shower (mezzanine level, €12). And now
  it’s time for breakfast … My go-to spot is Roots on Lintheschergasse, just two
  minutes from the platforms. Power porridge and avocado toast go down a treat
  after a night on the rails, as do all sorts of shakes and juices. For
  pre-departure supper, try Maru, a little oasis of Japan on level 2 of the
  shopping complex under the station serving matcha and “Japanese comfort food”.
  I love Zurich for its small-town feel. Having arrived on a night train and
  lingered over breakfast, I usually wander down pedestrianised Bahnhofstrasse
  and make for St Peterhofstatt, a haven of calm in the historic heart of the
  city. London Paddington station for the GWR Night Riviera for 11 destinations
  in Cornwall; Euston station for Caledonian Sleeper trains to 40-plus stations
  in Scotland Let’s not forget London. The last direct night sleeper service to
  the continent stopped 45 years ago (that was the Night Ferry to Brussels and
  Paris, which for a spell even conveyed a through sleeping car to Switzerland)
  but you can slip between crisp, clean sheets in sleepers departing the UK
  capital for the Cornish coast or Scottish Highlands. Arriving passengers can
  benefit from posh arrival lounges with free showers at both Paddington and
  Euston, although the facilities at the latter are only for those who booked en
  suite accommodation on the train. Passengers departing Euston should board
  early and head straight to the Club Car (seats are limited) for dinner for a
  taste of Scotland and a wee dram as they head north. Those departing from
  Paddington to Cornwall should take a chilled bottle of champagne to enjoy in
  the GWR lounge (the former royal waiting room) on Platform 1. Nicky Gardner is
  co-author of Europe by Rail: The Definitive Guide. The 18th edition is
  available from the Guardian Bookshop for £20.99 (additional postage charges
  may apply)
