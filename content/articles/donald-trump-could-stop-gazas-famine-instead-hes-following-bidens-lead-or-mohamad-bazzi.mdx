  A global hunger-monitoring group declared last week that Gaza’s largest city
  and its surrounding area were suffering from an “entirely man-made” famine,
  mostly caused by Israel’s deliberate starvation strategy and continued siege
  of the territory. This news won’t surprise anyone who has paid even scant
  attention to the images and videos of emaciated children and desperate parents
  that have been coming out of Gaza for months. But the first confirmation of
  famine by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), which
  includes the World Food Programme, the World Health Organization and other aid
  agencies, is an important institutional marker. Years from now, it will serve
  as a reminder of how Israel used starvation as a weapon of war while western
  powers did nothing. And it will be a source of shame for all those who will
  inevitably claim that they didn’t realize the extent of Israel’s genocidal war
  on Gaza, despite dozens of Palestinian journalists being killed for conveying
  that reality to the world. Donald Trump can stop this famine – the US is
  Israel’s largest weapons supplier and most important political supporter. But
  he has chosen not to. Instead, Trump is backing the Israeli prime minister,
  Benjamin Netanyahu, in his latest plan to sow more death and destruction by
  invading Gaza City and displacing 1 million Palestinians. Last month, the US
  president said children in Gaza “look very hungry”, adding that scenes of
  suffering showed “real starvation”. Trump contradicted the Israeli
  government’s spurious claim that warnings about impending famine were fake
  news. Yet the Trump administration stayed silent after the IPC issued its
  latest report last week, confirming that Gaza City and its environs are in the
  midst of a full-blown famine. In order to declare a famine, the IPC requires
  that an area must cross three critical thresholds: at least 20% of households
  face an extreme shortage of food; at least 30% of children suffer from acute
  malnutrition; and at least two adults or four children out of every 10,000
  people die each day due to starvation, or disease and malnutrition. Since the
  IPC was founded in 2004 to warn of global food shortages, it had confirmed
  only three previous famines: in Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and Sudan
  last year. By the time a famine is declared, it’s often too late to stop an
  exponential rise in deaths due to starvation and malnutrition. When a
  drought-driven famine hit Somalia between 2010 and 2012, about half of the
  250,000 people killed had already died by the time the IPC found that the
  country had crossed famine thresholds. During past famines, the IPC’s
  declaration helped drive global attention and prompted international donors to
  rush aid to affected regions. But the world’s attention is already focused on
  Gaza, and the UN and other aid groups say they have enough food near Gaza’s
  borders to feed its entire population of 2.1 million for nearly three months.
  Israel simply refuses to allow much of that aid into the besieged territory –
  a deliberate starvation campaign supported by the Trump administration. As Tom
  Fletcher, the UN’s humanitarian aid chief, put it last week: “Food stacks up
  at borders because of systematic obstruction by Israel.” He added that the
  Gaza famine was “caused by cruelty, justified by revenge, enabled by
  indifference and sustained by complicity”. Fletcher then appealed to world
  leaders to pressure Netanyahu to lift the siege. That plea was ultimately
  intended for Trump, the only leader who can force Netanyahu to end Gaza’s
  suffering. But the Israeli prime minister and his government continue to defy
  global outrage, largely because they have Trump’s unwavering support. Since
  early 2024, the UN and international relief groups have been sounding alarms
  about the potential for widespread starvation in Gaza because of the Israeli
  military blockade that started within days of the October 2023 Hamas attack on
  Israel. As I wrote recently, Joe Biden ignored these warnings while his
  administration tried to undermine criticism of its unconditional weapons
  shipments to Israel. Throughout 2024, when parts of Gaza reached the brink of
  starvation, Israel would ease its siege allowing some food and supplies to
  reach desperate Palestinians – and averting a descent into full-blow famine.
  But Netanyahu abandoned that strategy in early March, when he imposed a new
  siege on Gaza, with Trump’s tacit approval, depriving Palestinians of food,
  medicine and other basic needs. Netanyahu, who worried that his extremist
  government coalition would collapse if he agreed to a permanent truce with
  Hamas, quickly resumed Israel’s war, breaking a ceasefire that was in place
  for two months. Since then, Israel has inflicted a more severe siege and
  starvation campaign on Gaza. On 18 August, Hamas announced that it had
  accepted a ceasefire deal that is virtually identical to one that Israel and
  the US had proposed a few weeks earlier. But as he has done for nearly two
  years, Netanyahu is dragging his feet and making new demands to obstruct
  negotiations and torpedo any potential deal. Ultimately, Netanyahu wants to
  prolong the war and stay in power. It seems Trump has been seduced by
  Netanyahu’s promise of a decisive victory with his latest plan to conquer Gaza
  City and other parts of the territory that are not yet occupied by the Israeli
  military. Speaking to reporters at the White House on Monday, Trump said the
  Gaza war would reach “a conclusive ending” in the next two or three weeks.
  Netanyahu has been promising – and failing to deliver – a “total victory” over
  Hamas for more than a year. “Total victory over Hamas will not take years,” he
  said confidently in a speech in February 2024. “It will take months.” Since
  then, Netanyahu expressed lofty ambitions to reshape the entire Middle East,
  but he continued to defy international and domestic pressure to specify
  Israel’s postwar plans for Gaza or how the war could end short of his
  amorphous goal of “total victory”. And that was a deliberate tactic: from the
  beginning, Netanyahu’s allies wanted a protracted war that would end with
  Israel occupying Gaza and ethnically cleansing its Palestinian inhabitants.
  Last week, a top Biden administration official confirmed in an interview aired
  by an Israeli TV channel that, soon after the October 2023 Hamas attack,
  Netanyahu was preparing for a grinding guerrilla war in Gaza which could last
  “for decades”. Matthew Miller, the former state department spokesperson who
  often defended the administration’s unconditional support for Israel, also
  said that Netanyahu had repeatedly sabotaged US-brokered ceasefire
  negotiations. (An Israeli TV report found the prime minister nixed deals or
  near-agreements seven times.) But the Biden administration consistently blamed
  Hamas for refusing to accept a ceasefire, and rarely called out Netanyahu for
  his obstinacy, thinking it would harden Hamas’s position. For 15 months, Biden
  provided the Israeli premier with political cover and billions of dollars in
  US arms, becoming more deeply complicit in Israel’s use of starvation as a
  weapon and other war crimes. Today, Trump is repeating the same ineffective
  and immoral strategy, enticed by Netanyahu’s empty promise of victory while
  famine spreads in Gaza. Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Hagop Kevorkian
