  Good afternoon. Australian goods imported into the US will continue to attract
  the baseline 10% tariff, with Australia dodging any tariff increase in the
  latest round of Donald Trump’s global trade war. A new executive order issued
  on Friday morning Australian time confirmed tariffs ranging from 10% to 41% on
  imports from dozens of countries and foreign locations, including 35% tariffs
  on Canada. The order stated that any countries not on the new list – such as
  Australia – would remain at a 10% tariff. Follow all the developments in our
  live blog. The trade minister, Don Farrell, labelled Australia being spared a
  “vindication” of the Albanese government’s “cool and calm negotiations with
  our trading partners”. Meanwhile, Labor insists drug prices under Australia’s
  pharmaceutical benefits scheme will not rise, despite Trump threatening a
  major crackdown on drug manufacturers who do not lower their US prices, and
  criticising nations “freeloading on US innovation”. Top news Australian
  activists allege they were ‘brutalised psychologically’ after Israeli military
  detained Gaza aid boat Wet, wintry weekend in store for NSW as some areas
  warned of heavy rainfall and damaging winds Five Labor MPs defy NSW premier
  and vow to attend pro-Palestine march across Sydney Harbour Bridge Trump to
  build ‘beautiful’ $200m ballroom at White House Virginia Giuffre wanted
  Epstein documents made public, siblings say Peaky Blinders creator Steven
  Knight set to write next James Bond movie In video With rising living costs,
  storage problems and an ever‑growing mountain of waste contributing to the
  climate crisis, why buy when you can borrow? Run by volunteers, the Sydney
  Library of Things has more than 700 mostly donated items in their catalogue.
  Members borrow via a click and collect system across four locations in
  Waverton, Lane Cove, Cromer and Randwick. Guardian Australia cadet Ima
  Caldwell went behind the scenes of the eclectic library’s Lane Cove and
  Waverton branches to learn how one might cook a new recipe, deep clean, go
  camping, have a beach day, garden, renovate or throw a party (yes, they have a
  fog machine) – without buying all the gear. What they said … *** “The reality
  is, we’ve had 18 years to make progress on Closing the Gap, but the same
  people and institutions are still in charge of deciding what we do and what
  changes are made. Where is the accountability? There is none.” As the 25th
  Garma festival begins in north-east Arnhem Land, the Uluru Dialogue group,
  architects of the Uluru statement, have criticised a “performative” Albanese
  government for maintaining a status quo that neglects the rights of First
  Nations Australians. The comments came a day after the latest Closing the Gap
  data showed key targets continuing to worsen, with just four of 19 measures on
  track to be met. Podcast From Palestine to jobseeker and keeping children safe

  Tanya Plibersek, one of Labor’s most recognisable political figures and the
