  As I sit here in Australia watching Israel starve Palestinians to death, I

  “Why can’t I have a pomegranate?” The little girl’s question sank his heart.
  How would my colleague, Hatem, explain to his daughter that there are no
  pomegranates, and barely any flour? How will he explain that real people are
  doing this to her on purpose? Starving her little stomach as a weapon? As I
  sit here in Australia, watching “our ally in the Middle East” deprive my
  family and friends of food, I can’t help but think: it could have been me. The
  only difference between me and Hatem’s daughter is a few thousand kilometres.
  Geographic luck is why I am safe, why I have clean water, a fridge full of
  food, a home without drones buzzing overhead. But it doesn’t save me from the
  guilt. I sit glued to the screen as my colleagues, with sunken cheeks and
  frail bodies – barely able to stand – try to document their own starvation for
  Americans, Australians, anyone, to take action. It doesn’t stop me from
  wondering why – as the UN secretary general calls this the highest number of
  people facing catastrophic hunger recorded by its system “anywhere, anytime” –
  my colleagues still need to “prove” their own starvation. It doesn’t stop me
  from feeling that perhaps, as humans, we are all unlucky. Because we are
  living in hell. We live in a global system that lets you bomb hospitals and
  starve children. We live in a world that allows this to happen. I stare at the
  empty Word document. I have tried to write this article for a week now but
  can’t seem to find the right words. What words could ever be enough? What
  sentence could capture the feeling of watching an entire people slowly vanish?
  What words can I offer if footage of a child with a distended stomach isn’t
  enough? If a mother crying over rice grain isn’t enough? If people fighting
  for food scraps dropped from the sky, hospital wards filled with toddlers but
  empty of medicine, and lines for nonexistent water, are not enough? What I
  feel is something more than heartbreak. It’s rage. No child should go to bed
  hungry, let alone die from it. No mother should have to choose which child
  gets to eat. No people should be punished simply for existing. No one should
  know what it’s like not to eat for days. Yet, here we are. Israel is
  deliberately starving Gaza to death. The starvation is not a byproduct of
  genocide – it is the genocide; deliberate, calculated and human-made. It is
  starving more than 2 million people slowly, painfully and publicly. Before
  that, it flattened our homes, burned people alive in their tents, displaced
  millions, and targeted schools and universities. It turned Gaza, a place once
  filled with life and joy, into rubble. It turned schools into a place children
  would sleep, learning only how to survive – or how to die. And now, finally,
  it is openly starving us to death. Parents watch their children go hungry,
  feeling helpless. Infants are born without the chance to grow. Supermarket
  shelves are empty. Aid trucks are blocked. People are dying, not only from
  bullets but from hunger. These are not statistics. These are my cousins, my
  neighbours, my friends. People I grew up with. People I used to share a
  sandwich with at school recess. It is hard for me to believe they are now skin
  and bone, counting their days without food. Some tell me they have stopped
  counting. You and I are watching a human-made starvation, with full internet
  access, with journalists risking their lives to show us. There is nothing
  hidden. Nothing secret. We know. And knowing comes with responsibility. To
  speak up. To protest. To donate. To demand our governments take real action.
  To refuse to be complicit. These acts may feel little, compared with this
  scale of human cruelty. But if I were watching my hungry daughter ask about
  pomegranates, I would want every human on this planet to try doing something.
  Anything. Because anything is infinitely more than nothing. • Plestia Alaqad
