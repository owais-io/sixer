  Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook has filed a lawsuit claiming Donald Trump
  has no authority to fire her. The lawsuit – filed by Cook in federal court in
  Washington on Thursday – sets the stage for a legal battle over the US
  president’s extraordinary bid for greater control of the central bank. We’ll
  get you the latest details as we go through the lawsuit. Minneapolis woke on
  Thursday to the aftermath of the mass shooting at a Catholic school in which
  two children were killed and 17 people injured, stunning the close-knit
  community and prompting the FBI to investigate the act as domestic terrorism
  and a hate crime targeting Catholics. A shooter at the Annunciation Catholic
  school in the south of the city killed two children, aged eight and 10, in
  church pews during morning mass. Fourteen other children, aged six to 15, were
  injured, two of them critically, though officials said they were expected to
  survive. The shooter killed themself. “This was a deliberate act of violence
  against innocent children and other people worshipping,” the Minneapolis
  police chief, Brian O’Hara, said. “The sheer cruelty and cowardice of firing
  into a church full of children is absolutely incomprehensible.” He said the
  incident took place just before 8.30am during a service marking the first week
  of school. The pews had been packed with teachers, parents and children
  listening to a psalm. Just before the congregants were to proclaim “Alleluia”,
  bullets were fired through the windows. “Down! Everybody down!” someone
  shouted as children ducked for cover behind wooden pews. One student threw
  himself on top of a friend and was shot in the back. A youth minister called
  her husband to say goodbye. People used a wooden plank to barricade a door and
  fled to a gymnasium. The shooting went on for several minutes, according to a
  man who lives near the church and said he heard as many as 50 shots. Dozens of
  law enforcement officers soon arrived at the school. Police said the suspect,
  Robin Westman, 23, was found dead behind the church. Westman’s mother once
  worked there, but otherwise the shooter had no known connection to the church
  and no motive has been revealed. The three injured adults were parishioners in
  their 80s, officials said. Read the full report from my colleagues below:
  Attorney general Pam Bondi said that federal law enforcement made another 105
  arrests in DC on Wednesday, including seizing 12 illegal firearms. Bondi said
  that this brings the arrest tally to 1,283 – since 7 August, when the surge of
  federal officers assisting local police began. Senator Bernie Sanders of
  Vermont, an Independent, who serves as the ranking member on the health,
  education, labor and pensions (Help) committee, said that Robert F Kennedy
  Jr’s attempt to fire Susan Monarez was “outrageous”. “The Sen. HELP Committee
  must hold a hearing with Kennedy &amp; the CDC Director as soon as possible.
  Vaccines save lives. Period,” Sanders said on X. As Monarez is a
  Senate-confirmed official (the first CDC director to receive this stamp),
  removal from office can only come from president, or an impeachment process by
  Congress. Monarez’s lawyers say that her termination is “legally deficient”,
  since it didn’t come from Trump himself. Donald Trump doesn’t have any
  public-facing events today, according to his official schedule. He’s due to
  sign executive orders later, but that remains closed to the press. If anything
  changes we’ll bring you the latest. We can expect to hear from White House
  press secretary Karoline Leavitt at 1pm today. She’ll hold a briefing, and we
  can expect questions on several topics: the school shooting in Minneapolis
  that killed two children and injured 17 people on Wednesday, the fallout of
  the CDC director’s firing, and the latest on foreign policy – particularly
  after Russian airstrikes on Kyiv killed at least 12 people overnight. Hello,
  I’m Shrai Popat, and welcome to today’s coverage of US politics live. The US’s
  top public health agency was plunged into chaos on Wednesday after the Trump
  administration moved to oust its leader, Susan Monarez, sworn in less than a
  month ago. But her lawyers said she would not resign and that she was being
  “targeted” for her pro-science stance. Monarez, the director of the Centers
  for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), was ousted on Wednesday evening,
  according to a statement from Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
  that offered no explanation its decision. “Susan Monarez is no longer director
  of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We thank her for her
  dedicated service to the American people,” HHS said in an unsigned statement
  posted to social media. Her lawyers pushed back in a statement, saying she had
  “neither resigned nor received notification” from the White House of her
  termination. Monarez, who was confirmed by the Senate just last month,
  appeared to have run afoul of Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US health secretary,
  after she declined to support sweeping changes to US vaccine policies,
  according to reporting from the Washington Post and the New York Times. “First
  it was independent advisory committees and career experts. Then it was the
  dismissal of seasoned scientists. Now, Secretary Kennedy and HHS have set
  their sights on weaponizing public health for political gain and putting
  millions of American lives at risk,” her lawyers, Mark Zaid and Abbe David
  Lowell, said in a statement. “When CDC director Susan Monarez refused to
  rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health
  experts, she chose protecting the public over serving a political agenda. For
  that, she has been targeted.” Democratic senator Patty Murray, who serves on
  the Senate health committee called for Kennedy to be fired and said he is “a
  dangerous man who is determined to abuse his authority to act on truly
  terrifying conspiracy theories and disinformation”. “If there are any adults
  left in the White House, it’s well past time they face reality and fire RFK
  Jr,” Murray said. Meanwhile, Dr Mandy Cohen, a former CDC director under
  president Joe Biden, said: “We lost exceptional leaders who have served over
  many decades and many administrations. The weakening of the CDC leaves us less
  safe and more vulnerable as a country.” The ousting has set off a wave of
  departures within the agency, with at least three other CDC leaders publicly
  resigning after the HHS announcement. The most explosive resignation letter
  came from Dr Demetre Daskalakis, who stepped down as the director of the
  National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, according to Inside
  Medicine, an industry newsletter that obtained the full statements. “I am not
  able to serve in this role any longer because of the ongoing weaponizing of
  public health. You are the best team I have ever worked with, and you continue
  to shine despite this dark cloud over the agency and our profession,”
  Daskalakis wrote. “Please take care of yourself and your teams and make the
  right decisions for yourselves.” Read our full report here: In other
  developments: Former British prime minister Tony Blair has attended a White
  House meeting with Donald Trump to discuss plans for postwar Gaza, the
  Guardian understands. After stepping down as prime minister in 2007, Blair
  took on the role of Middle East envoy until 2015 and spent time in Jerusalem
  trying to formulate a plan for a two-state solution. A federal judge ruled on
  Wednesday that Kilmar Ábrego García, who was already wrongfully deported once,
  cannot be deported again until at least early October. National guard troops
  have spent their last days of the summer mulching cherry trees, collecting
  trash and clearing homeless camps across Washington DC, as Donald Trump’s
  federal takeover of the capital evolved the guard from makeshift cops to armed
  jacks of all trades. Republicans in California are proposing a “two-state
  solution” for the Golden state, in a move that is unlikely to go anywhere but
  is reflective of partisan divisions amid a nationwide battle over control of
  Congress. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved updated Covid
  vaccines but has placed new restrictions on who can get them. Florida’s
  immigration jail known as “Alligator Alcatraz” will probably be empty of
  detainees within days, a state official has said, indicating compliance with a
  judge’s order last week that the facility must close. The Fulton county
  commission in Georgia will be fined $10,000 a day for violating a court order
  to appoint two Republicans associated with Trump-aligned groups pushing voter
  fraud conspiracies to the county’s election board.
