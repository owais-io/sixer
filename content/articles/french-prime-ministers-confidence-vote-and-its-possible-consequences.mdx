  The French prime minister, François Bayrou, has surprised France by calling a
  sudden confidence vote on 8 September, saying he needs backing from parliament
  for austerity measures to reduce the public debt. Bayrou is almost certain to
  lose the gamble. All opposition parties from the far right to the left have
  said they will vote to topple the prime minister and his minority government
  after only nine months in office. This would create a fresh political crisis.
  The French president, Emmanuel Macron, would have to decide whether to swiftly
  choose a replacement prime minister, while any new appointee could face the
  same difficulties as Bayrou in securing support. Macron could instead call a
  snap parliamentary election, but he recently said he was reluctant to do so.
  Last year’s snap election resulted in a divided parliament where no political
  grouping has an outright majority. Why has Bayrou called a confidence vote
  now? Bayrou, a centrist and long-term Macron ally, was struggling to get
  support for his unpopular plan for a €44bn budget squeeze and austerity
  programme to reduce France’s public debt. His proposals, including scrapping
  two public holidays and freezing most welfare spending, were contested across
  the political class. Bayrou knew he was facing a difficult autumn: he would
  have to force through the 2026 budget without a parliament vote and was likely
  to be toppled by a no-confidence motion in the coming months. Calling his own
  confidence vote on 8 September was a way of jumping before he was pushed. He
  is the least popular prime minister since 1958, with one poll this summer
  showing 80% of French people did not trust him. Bayrou was also braced for
  anti-government demonstrations and strikes on 10 September against his budget
  plans, which officials feared might grow to resemble the gilets jaunes (yellow
  vest) protest movement of 2018 and 2019. Will Macron appoint a new prime
  minister? If Bayrou falls, the most likely scenario is Macron chooses another
  prime minister. But it is not certain who, and they may have the same
  difficulties as Bayrou and struggle to pass a 2026 budget. One year ago,
  Macron appointed the rightwing Michel Barnier as prime minister, but
  parliament ousted him only three months later over budget disagreements. His
  replacement, Bayrou, will have lasted nine months by the time of the vote.
  Since Macron called an inconclusive snap election last June, the French
  parliament has been divided between three groups with no absolute majority. A
  left alliance won the largest number of seats but fell short of an absolute
  majority; Macron’s centrist grouping took losses but is still present; and the
  far-right National Rally gained seats but was held back from power by tactical
  voting from the left and centre. The Green leader, Marine Tondelier, said this
  week that Macron must now appoint a prime minister from the left. But the
  rightwing party Les Républicains, which has propped up the current government,
  would oppose that. Names that have previously circulated as potential prime
  ministers include the defence minister, Sébastien Lecornu, who was on the
  right before joining Macron’s centrists, and the former Socialist prime
  minister Bernard Cazeneuve. Could there be a snap parliament election? Macron
  gambled on a snap parliamentary election last summer in an attempt to head off
  the far right and bolster his authority, but the move backfired and parliament
  was left deadlocked. Macron told Paris Match earlier this month that he did
  not intend to hold another snap election. The justice minister, Gérald
  Darmanin, said this week that a snap election could not be ruled out. Some
  members of Macron’s centrist camp believe calling a parliamentary election may
  be the only solution, while others are opposed. Marine Le Pen is pushing for a
  snap election in the hope that her far-right National Rally party could gain
  seats. In last year’s snap election, the far right gained ground but was held
  back in the final round by tactical voting and a left alliance. If an election
  is called, it is likely that Macron’s centrist grouping would lose seats. A
  majority of French people want parliament to be dissolved and a fresh
  parliamentary election, according to polls by Ifop, Elabe and Toluna Harris
  Interactive. Could Macron resign? Macron’s second term as president runs until
  spring 2027 and he has always ruled out resigning. There were calls this week
  from some on the left, right and far right for Macron to resign but this is
  not expected. If the prime minister falls, would it affect the small boats
  crisis, as growing numbers cross the Channel from France to the UK? If Bayrou
  is ousted, the current French government would stay in place in a temporary,
  caretaker capacity to run domestic affairs until a new government is formed.
  This means policies on small boats would continue, including French policing
  of the northern coast, where people are departing for the UK. Keir Starmer
  announced a “one in, one out” returns deal with France earlier this year
  whereby the UK would send some people arriving by small boat back to France in
  exchange for asylum seekers with links to Britain. That will continue. French
  maritime authorities are continuing to study the possibility of a legal
  extension of French policing powers to the shallow waters off northern
  beaches, to prevent boats from departing.
