  My father, Derek Reffell, who has died aged 96, was a naval officer for more
  than 50 years, serving during the Falklands war and becoming controller of the
  navy in 1984. He was then appointed governor of Gibraltar. In his career as an
  admiral, a highlight was relieving Admiral Sandy Woodward as commander of the
  taskforce in the South Atlantic immediately after the Argentinian surrender,
  in 1982. Derek began his career early, joining Britannia Royal Naval College
  (BRNC Dartmouth), which had then been evacuated to Eaton Hall, Chester, aged
  13, in 1942. Early service as a midshipman included the Palestine patrol,
  where in 1947 his ship HMS Ajax arrested SS Exodus 1947, the former steamship
  President Warfield that was illegally carrying Jewish emigrants from Marseille
  to Palestine in the wake of the Holocaust. Later, in 1966 as commanding
  officer of HMS Sirius, he and his ship’s company represented Queen Elizabeth
  II at the coronation of Tāufaʻāhau Tupou IV of Tonga, where Derek was invited
  to eat suckling pig with the king. As the commander of BRNC Dartmouth from
  1968 to 1970 he had a reputation for kindness and good humour while his
  authority and memory for names of miscreants was never in doubt. In 1974 he
  returned to sea as captain of HMS Hermes, on board which was the helicopter
  pilot Flt Lt the Prince of Wales. While the ship was in Canada the following
  year, when Prince Charles was fortunately attending the Order of the Garter
  service in Windsor, the Canadian government attempted to impound the ship
  after two of its sailors had committed an offence, but my father gave orders
  to set sail, believing the order to be illegal. Born in Wanstead, Essex (now
  in the London borough of Redbridge), to Roy Reffell, a banker, and his wife,
  Murielle (nee Bland), Derek went to Culford school, Bury St Edmunds, before
  joining BRNC Dartmouth. He met my mother, Janne Gronow Davis, when she was a
  serving WRNS officer, and they married in 1956. On retirement from the navy,
  he relished his role as governor and commander-in-chief of Gibraltar
  (1989-93), and was described by Fabian Picardo, the present chief minister, as
  “a steadfast friend of Gibraltar” with “a legacy of integrity and service”. My
  parents then settled in Hindhead, Surrey, where they were involved in
  charities and their local church, including my father annually conducting the
  Christmas Eve carols in nearby Grayshott village square for Action Medical
  Research. Janne died in 2013. He is survived by his children, Jane and me, and
  two grandchildren, Laura and Tom.
