  Good morning. The Taliban has called for international aid as Afghanistan
  reels from an earthquake that killed more than 900 people and left thousands
  injured. Rescuers searched into the night on Monday for survivors after the
  quake struck on Sunday, destroying entire villages across the country’s
  eastern Kunar province, which borders Pakistan. Many people remained trapped
  under the debris of mud and stone houses built into steep valleys as rescuers
  struggled to reach remote areas due to rough mountainous terrain and inclement
  weather. What kind of earthquake was it? The quake, which struck at about
  midnight, was a magnitude 6.0 – but it was also a shallow earthquake, taking
  place just six miles beneath the Earth’s surface, making it particularly
  destructive. What did the Taliban say? Sharafat Zaman, a spokesperson for the
  health ministry in Kabul, called for international aid. “We need it because
  here lots of people lost their lives and houses,” he said. Leaked ‘Gaza
  Riviera’ plan dismissed as ‘insane’ attempt to cover ethnic cleansing A plan
  circulating in the White House to develop the “Gaza Riviera” as a string of
  hi-tech megacities has been dismissed as an “insane” attempt to provide cover
  for the large-scale ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian territory’s
  population. On Sunday, the Washington Post published a leaked prospectus for
  the plan, which would involve the forced displacement of Gaza’s entire
  population of 2 million people and put the territory into a US trusteeship for
  at least a decade. Named the Gaza Reconstitution, Economic Acceleration and
  Transformation Trust – or “Great” – the proposal was reportedly developed by
  some of the same Israelis who created and set in motion the US- and
  Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation with financial planning
  contributed by Boston Consulting Group. What’s the most controversial part of
  the plan? The 38-page plan suggests what it calls “temporary relocation of all
  of Gaza’s more than 2 million population” – a proposal that would amount to
  ethnic cleansing, potentially a genocidal act. Graham Greene, Dances with
  Wolves actor, dies age 73 Graham Greene, the prolific Oscar-nominated Canadian
  First Nations actor and Hollywood trailblazer, has died age 73 in a Toronto
  hospital after a long illness. “He was a great man of morals, ethics and
  character and will be eternally missed,” Greene’s agent, Michael Greene (no
  relation), told Deadline. “You are finally free.” Greene was born in 1952 in
  Ohsweken, on the Six Nations reserve in Ontario, Canada. His Hollywood
  breakthrough came when Kevin Costner cast him as real-life Lakota Sioux
  medicine man Kicking Bird (Ziŋtká Nagwáka) in his Academy Award-winning 1990
  western Dances with Wolves. Greene’s performance landed him an Academy Award
  nomination and launched his Hollywood career. What else was he in? After
  Dances with Wolves, he appeared in Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995), The Green
  Mile (1999) and The Twilight Saga: New Moon (2009). More recently, Greene
  appeared in Taika Waititi’s FX series Reservation Dogs, HBO’s dystopian series
  The Last Of Us and Taylor Sheridan’s series 1883 and Tulsa King. In other news
  … More than 1,000 people were killed in a landslide in western Sudan on
  Sunday, according to a rebel group that controls the area. The landslide,
  which followed heavy rain, destroyed a village in the Marra mountains area. A
  Labor Day rally in Chicago was one of hundreds of protests organized across
  the US as part of the national “Workers Over Billionaires” effort, a mass
  action calling for the protection of social safety nets such as social
  security. Doctors have found a bullet fragment lodged in the neck of a
  10-year-old boy who gave a widely shared account of how his friend helped
  protect him during the mass shooting in Minneapolis last week. Nevada sheriffs
  are asking for help in identifying a man found in a pool of blood in what
  police are treating as a homicide at the Burning Man festival. Don’t miss
  this: Donald Trump says he is not a dictator. Isn’t he? Speaking in the Oval
  Office this week, Donald Trump insisted he wasn’t a dictator. Yet his actions
  – deploying troops to Washington, threatening universities with funding cuts,
  targeting critics and demanding investigations into opponents, all while his
  family profits – suggest otherwise. None of these things are typical for a
  democratic leader. So … is Trump a dictator? … or this: why more people are
  tuning out the news News has never been more accessible – but for some, that’s
  exactly the problem. Flooded with information and relentless updates, more
  people around the world are tuning out. The reasons vary: for some it’s the
  sheer volume of news, for others the emotional toll of negative headlines or a
  distrust of the media itself. “Now that I don’t watch the news, I just don’t
  have that anxiety. I don’t have dread,” said Mardette Burr, an Arizona
  retiree. Climate check: global temperatures to remain above average despite
  return of La Niña, says UN The cooling La Niña weather phenomenon may return
  between September and November, but even if it does, global temperatures are
  expected to be above average, the United Nations has said, and it won’t stop
  human-induced climate change increasing temperatures and exacerbating extreme
  weather. Last Thing: Clanker! This slur against robots is all over the
  internet – but is it offensive? “Clanker”, first used for battle droids in a
  2005 Star Wars game, has become a popular online insult for robots and AI
  chatbots such as ChatGPT. Spread through memes and TikTok, it reflects
  frustration with fake content and fears over automation. Linguists are warning
  its normalisation risks echoing real-world prejudice, but for now the machines
  don’t seem too offended. Sign up First Thing is delivered to thousands of
