  Donald Trump appeared to confuse geography and history on Monday, saying on
  television that he planned to meet Vladimir Putin “in Russia” on Friday for
  their much-anticipated, high-stakes summit. It was the latest in a series of
  verbal slip-ups by the US president – though had he made it a little over a
  century and a half earlier, it would have been true. Alaska, with
  Novo-Arkhangelsk as its regional capital, remained part of the Russian empire
  under Tsar Alexander II until its sale to the US in 1867. When Putin’s jet
  touches down in Alaska, he will be greeted by traces of Russia’s former
  presence. From the wild, rugged shores of Baranof Island to Anchorage, the
  state’s largest city, Russian Orthodox churches with their distinctive
  onion-shaped domes still dot the landscape. Russia’s foothold in Alaska began
  not with armies, but fur. In the mid-18th century, merchants and adventurers
  pushed east across Siberia, spurred by the promise of lucrative sea otter
  pelts. By the 1780s, Catherine the Great had authorised the creation of the
  Russian-American Company, granting it a monopoly over trade and governance in
  the territory. Alexander Baranov, a hard-driving merchant, consolidated
  Russia’s hold on the region in the late 18th century, expanding settlements
  and ruthlessly suppressing resistance, most famously from the native Tlingit,
  who gave him the grim nickname “No Heart”. Russian Orthodox priests soon
  followed, establishing missions and building churches. In New Archangel (now
  Sitka), they raised St Michael’s Cathedral, its green dome rising against a
  backdrop of glaciers, still anchoring the town’s view, on the same site more
  than 150 years later. But by the mid-19th century, the Russian empire had come
  to see Alaska as more of a liability than an asset, and began quietly seeking
  a buyer. In the wake of its humiliating defeat in the Crimean war, the
  territory had become a drain on St Petersburg’s finances, compounded by
  mounting fears over Britain’s expanding naval presence in the Pacific. In a
  letter to a friend in July 1867, Eduard de Stoeckl, the Russian envoy in
  Washington and chief negotiator of the sale, admitted: “My treaty has met with
  strong opposition … but this stems from the fact that no one at home has any
  idea of the true condition of our colonies. It was simply a matter of selling
  them, or watching them being taken from.” The sale of Alaska emerged as a rare
  diplomatic win-win: for Russia, a way to recoup cash, gain a new, emerging
  ally across the Atlantic and sidestep a potential conflict with Britain; for
  the US, an opportunity to forestall European encroachment and assert its
  growing influence in the Pacific. Still, when the Russian empire agreed the
  sale in 1867, few on either side of the Pacific saw it at first as an outright
  triumph. In St Petersburg, it was viewed by some as the latest imperial
  humiliation. The colony, remote and costly to supply, had never been a jewel
  of the empire, yet the price – $7.2m – struck many as insultingly low. The
  liberal paper Golos dismissed the transaction as “deeply angering all true
  Russians”. “Is the nation’s sense of pride truly so unworthy of attention that
  it can be sacrificed for a mere six or seven million dollar[s],” the paper
  wrote. Across the US, the secretary of state, William H Seward, who negotiated
  the treaty, was ridiculed for spending what critics saw as an unreasonable sum
  on a frozen wilderness. The New-York Daily Tribune dismissed the acquisition
  as “the nominal possession of impassable deserts of snow”. “We may make a
  treaty with Russia,” its editorial complained, “but we cannot make a treaty
  with the North Wind or the Snow King.” Others wondered if the price was
  suspiciously low, and whether Russia had simply palmed off a worthless scrap
  of territory. “Russia has sold us a sucked orange. Whatever may be the value
  of that territory and its outlying islands to us, it has ceased to be of any
  to Russia,” the New York World wrote on 1 April 1867. Yet that perception
  would soon be dramatically overturned. The gold rushes of the late 19th
  century, and the discovery of oilfields decades later, transformed what had
  once been mocked as folly into one of the US’s most resource-rich territories
  – and one of history’s great bargains. The cheap sale remained etched in
  Russian memory and has occasionally inspired fringe nationalist calls to
  reclaim Alaska. In 1974, when Americans protested against the low price the
  USSR paid for wheat, the Soviet trade official Vladimir Alkimov drily noted
  that Alaska had been sold for only $7m. In 1867, the mood was different. For a
  short time, the Alaska sale opened a fleeting chapter of warmth between Russia
  and the US. The New York Herald lauded in 1867 what looked like a potential
  new ally in Russia, writing: “The cession of Russian Alaska becomes a matter
  of great importance. It indicates the extent to which Russia is ready to carry
  out her entente cordiale with the United States,” the paper continued. That
  warming of ties would culminate in 1871, when Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich
  led a naval squadron to New York, where he was greeted with military parades,
  gala receptions and civic honors. When Trump and Putin meet in Alaska this
  week, the backdrop will be the prospect of a historic renewal of ties. For
  Kyiv, the hope is that this time such warmth will not come at the expense of
  its territory – and that the era of trading land like currency in great power
  deals is in the past.
