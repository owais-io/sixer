  Iga Swiatek has finally had a brief moment to catch her breath. Her life has
  been on fast-forward for the last few hectic yet rewarding weeks, emerging
  from the heat and humidity of the Cincinnati Open with another significant
  title. Fourteen hours later she was on court in New York, throwing herself
  into two long days of competition alongside her new partner, Casper Ruud. The
  stakes were low for singles players in the mixed doubles this week but every
  point she played meant more mental energy expended. There is still little time
  for Swiatek to reflect on how the summer has developed, but with the final
  grand slam tournament of the year starting on Sunday it is clear the past few
  months have become a defining moment in her career. Swiatek started the season
  swimming upstream, still reeling from her doping case last year. She emerged
  from that difficult period with the most surprising, special victory of her
  career, a triumph on grass, her least favourite surface, at Wimbledon, which
  she sealed with a merciless 6-0, 6-0 demolition of Amanda Anisimova in the
  final. In stark contrast to the relief she felt after previous triumphs, this
  victory brought her only joy. That emotion has endured throughout Swiatek’s
  hard-court season, and as a result the Pole will begin the US Open as the
  favourite, seeking her seventh grand slam title. The competition, however, is
  varied and difficult. Aryna Sabalenka rightfully remains the world No 1,
  although she has repeatedly frozen in the most significant moments, despite
  how frequently she has put herself in position to win big titles. After two
  major finals and a semi-final this year, the Belarusian’s US Open title
  defence represents her last opportunity to end a year of near misses with a
  massive victory. Sabalenka’s challenges, however, pale in comparison with Coco
  Gauff’s struggles. It was reasonable to assume the American’s triumph at the
  French Open, where she established herself as a multiple slam champion, would
  have inspired more freedom and confidence in her game. Instead, her serve has
  completely deteriorated over the past few months. On the eve of the US Open,
  she took the decision to part ways with one of her coaches, Matthew Daly, and
  hire Gavin MacMillan, the biomechanics expert who helped to revive Sabalenka’s
  serve. It was a drastic move. As is always the case, a wide variety of
  characters can compete for the title, depending on how they are feeling in New
  York. Although Mirra Andreeva’s form has cooled over the past few months, the
  Russian has the talent to break through at any time. Madison Keys, the victor
  in Australia, and Anisimova had spectacular grand slam runs this year and can
  do so again on home soil. Elena Rybakina appears to be on the verge of
  rediscovering her top form. Perhaps the Canadian Open will turn out to be a
  sign of things to come, with the 18-year-old Victoria Mboko putting together a
  spectacular breakout title win and Naomi Osaka showing promising signs by
  reaching the final. In contrast to the notable shifts in women’s tennis this
  year, absolutely nothing has changed at the top of the men’s game. Just as in
  Paris, Wimbledon and the Masters 1000 events since, the question remains
  whether any challenger is prepared to take down just one of Jannik Sinner and
  Carlos Alcaraz. As the gap between them and the rest of the field continues to
  grow, they will start the US Open attempting to contest a third consecutive
  grand slam final and a fifth final this year overall. Novak Djokovic, now 38,
  has been the third-best player at the grand slam tournaments with three
  semi-finals. However, he has not competed since Wimbledon. After his
  straight-sets defeat by Sinner there in early July, Djokovic himself cast
  doubt on his ability to win his 25th grand slam title due to the physicality
  of these events across the best of five sets, which are increasingly difficult
  to navigate due to his ageing body. One of the most significant developments
  this summer has been Ben Shelton’s continued growth. He followed up his
  quarter-final run at Wimbledon by emerging from a bruising two weeks in
  Toronto with his first Masters 1000 title. Already a two‑time grand slam
  semi‑finalist, the 22-year-old American produces his best tennis at the major
  tournaments and in front of home crowds. The coming weeks are a chance for him
  to consolidate his status as a top contender. In the spring it was Jack Draper
  who seemed to have positioned himself as the younger player most likely to
  challenge Sinner and Alcaraz, but the Briton’s last few months have been
  complicated. After frustrating defeats at the French Open and Wimbledon, a
  left forearm injury forced Draper off the tour for three months and he has not
  competed in singles since losing in SW19. A year after his first big grand
  slam breakthrough, a rousing semi-final run, he returns to the US Open without
  any hard‑court preparation. Time is not on Draper’s side this week, but the
  qualities that have put him in this position as the fifth-best player in the
  world at a grand slam – his ability and ambition – mean he is more than
  capable of quickly finding his feet and taking another significant step
  forward.
