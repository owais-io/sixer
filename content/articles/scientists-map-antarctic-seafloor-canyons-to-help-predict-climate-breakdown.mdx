  Scientists have mapped 332 Antarctic canyon networks to help assess the future
  course of climate breakdown. The research, published in the journal Marine
  Geology, shows in high resolution submarine valleys that can reach down more
  than 4,000 metres, more than twice the depth of the Grand Canyon in the US.
  The resulting data shows that the canyons may have a bigger impact than
  thought on ocean circulation, ice-shelf thinning and climate change. The study
  was carried out by researchers from the Faculty of Earth Sciences at the
  University of Barcelona, Spain, and the marine geosciences research group at
  University College Cork, Ireland. The Antarctic canyons resemble those
  elsewhere “but tend to be larger and deeper because of the prolonged action of
  polar ice and the immense volumes of sediment transported by glaciers to the
  continental shelf”, said David Amblàs of the research team. He added: “That’s
  why we must continue to gather high-resolution bathymetric data in unmapped
  areas that will surely reveal new canyons, collect observational data … and
  keep improving our climate models to better represent these processes and
  increase the reliability of projections on climate change impacts.” Submarine
  canyons are carved valleys on the seafloor that play a crucial role in the
  movement of sediments, nutrients and the creations of biodiverse habitats.
  Antarctica’s canyons become enlarged because of the turbulent water currents
  that carry sediments at high speed through them. Scientists have been able to
  map in high resolution only 27% of the Earth’s seafloor, uncovering 10,000
  submarine canyons worldwide. But most of these canyons remain underexplored,
  especially in polar regions. Using data from the International Bathymetric
  Chart of the Southern Ocean, researchers produced high-resolution maps of 332
  Antarctic canyon networks, five times as many as previous studies had managed.
  The most spectacular of these are in east Antarctica and “characterised by
  complex, branching canyon systems”, said Amblàs. Maps of the Antarctic
  submarine canyons are increasingly recognised by scientists as essential for
  understanding the impact of the climate crisis. The canyons channel warm water
  from the open sea towards the coastline, thinning the floating ice shelves and
  contributing to the rise in global sea levels, said Riccardo Arosio, another
  of the researchers. Mapping the seafloor and its influence on the movement of
  water is necessary to build accurate ocean circulation models that can be used
  to predict the impact of the climate crisis, especially in vulnerable polar
  regions.
