  An off-the-shelf vaccine has shown promise in preventing the return of
  pancreatic and colorectal cancer, researchers have revealed. Cancer vaccines
  have been the subject of promising research in recent years. The NHS in
  England has been trialling various jabs in patients through the Cancer Vaccine
  Launch Pad (CVLP). Such vaccines train the body’s immune system to recognise
  cancer cells so any that return after treatments such as surgery can be hunted
  down and killed, reducing the risk of the disease coming back. Many cancer
  vaccines, including some of those based on mRNA technology, are personalised
  to the patient’s tumours. However, a study has suggested a non-personalised,
  experimental vaccine that is already being made at scale could help prevent
  the return of pancreatic and colorectal cancer. If borne out by further
  trials, experts say, the approach could be beneficial since the vaccine is
  likely to be cheaper and faster to access than mRNA jabs, as well as less
  toxic than some other therapies. “After a long-term follow-up of this study,
  we were able to demonstrate that the group of patients who mounted an immune
  response have a greater likelihood of not having their cancer return and
  living longer compared to historical expectation of what that patient would
  do,” said Prof Zev Wainberg, an oncologist at the University of California,
  Los Angeles, and a co-author of the study. The authors noted 90% of people
  with pancreatic cancer and 50% of those with colorectal cancer had mutations
  in the Kras gene. These mutations result in the production of altered Kras
  proteins that cause cells to divide and proliferate. Writing in the journal
  Nature Medicine, Wainberg and colleagues reported how they gave a vaccine
  called ELI-002 2P to 20 patients who had had surgery for pancreatic cancer and
  five who had been operated on for colorectal cancer. The vaccine contains
  peptides – long chains of amino acids, which are the building blocks of
  proteins. The vaccine works by training the T-cells of the body’s immune
  system to recognise and kill cancer cells with mutations that result in them
  producing the altered Kras proteins. At a median follow-up of almost 20
  months, the team found patients fell into two groups: 17 who had a strong
  immune response to the jab and eight who had a weaker response. The team found
  the former group experienced a longer period before their cancer returned and
  survived longer overall. Overall, four of those 17 patients died during
  follow-up, compared with seven of the eight who had a lower immune response.
  However, the study is early stage research designed primarily to assess
  safety, involved only 25 participants, had no controls, and looked at two very
  different types of cancer. Even so, experts said the results were worth
  noting. Siow Ming Lee, a professor of medical oncology at University College
  London, who was not involved with the work, suggested the ELI-002 2P vaccine
  could be combine with other kinds of immunotherapy, and might help a wider
  range of patients. “With promising early results and potentially fewer
  side-effects than current oral inhibitors, this off-the-shelf cancer vaccine
  could expand treatment options for Kras-driven cancers and warrants further
  testing in larger trials, including exploring its potential use in lung
  cancers driven by mutations in Kras gene,” he said. Dr Shivan Sivakumar of the
  University of Birmingham, who works on mRNA-based pancreatic cancer vaccines,
  said it was fascinating so many of the patients in the study showed a clear
  immune response to the off-the-shelf vaccine. But Sivakumar noted that a key
  advantage of personalised mRNA vaccines was that they did not have to rely on
  mutations in the Kras gene. He said it was now important to carry out
  randomised control trials of the ELI-002 2P vaccine and follow patients over a
  longer period. “How many times have we been down this garden path where we’ve
  got really excited about the science? But actually, ultimately, the real
  scientific experiment is in patients,” Sivakumar added.
