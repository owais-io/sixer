  Virgil van Dijk has acknowledged that Liverpool must improve defensively to
  retain the Premier League title, and backed the club to bring in more
  reinforcements before the end of the transfer window. Van Dijk revealed after
  the Community Shield on Sunday that he had spent the previous five days in bed
  with a virus. The defender was culpable for Palace’s first equaliser in the
  2-2 draw when he brought down Ismaïla Sarr for a penalty and Liverpool’s
  defence struggled to contain the Senegal forward, who scored his team’s second
  to take the game to a shootout won by Palace. Aside from a 5-0 win against
  Stoke last month behind closed doors, Liverpool have conceded in all of their
  pre-season matches and their captain admitted that must be resolved before the
  opening league fixture at home against Bournemouth on Friday night. “If it was
  that simple, I would have told you immediately and we would have fixed it,”
  Van Dijk said. “But it’s a combination. You defend as a team, you press as a
  team. “I don’t know how many chances we give away [against Palace], but I
  think there’s still maybe a handful in total. But the fact is that we conceded
  every game, apart from Stoke. That’s something we have to work on. “I’m not
  worried whatsoever, because there’s also a reason why we’re very defensively
  good last year. We have to get back to it.” Ryan Gravenberch missed the
  Community Shield because his partner gave birth on Saturday night and he is
  suspended for the Bournemouth game after being sent off against Palace on the
  final day of last season. Curtis Jones dropped into the Dutchman’s usual
  position in central midfield on Sunday and could retain his place, along with
  the new full‑backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez. Liverpool are interested
  in signing Marc Guéhi, but have yet to match Palace’s £40m valuation for their
  captain, who has entered the final year of his contract. Despite an impressive
  performance from Hugo Ekitiké against Palace, Liverpool are also expected to
  make another attempt to sign Alexander Isak from Newcastle after selling
  Darwin Núñez to Al-Hilal last week. Liverpool have also sold Luis Díaz to
  Bayern Munich. The Portugal forward Diogo Jota died in a car crash last month.
  They have spent nearly £300m on players. “I’m fully trusting the club to do
  the right thing,” Van Dijk said. “What they think is good for the club, we’ll
  see in the next couple of weeks.” Liverpool ended their last title defence,
  under Jürgen Klopp in 2020-21, third, 17 points behind the champions,
  Manchester City. “It was quite tough the year after we won it,” Van Dijk said.
  “We have to put it in our minds that whatever happened last season, happened
  last season. “As a team, as a club, it was always going to be a tough season,
  especially with everything that happened over the summer as well. But the only
  way to overcome this is to do it together as a collective.”
