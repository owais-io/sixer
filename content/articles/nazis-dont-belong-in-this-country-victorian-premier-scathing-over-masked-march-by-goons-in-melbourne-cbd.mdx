  The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has condemned “goons” who took part in a
  neo-Nazi march through the streets of Melbourne in the early hours of Saturday
  morning. About 100 people dressed in black with face coverings marched through
  the Melbourne CBD, including down Bourke Street, police said in a statement.
  Police said they responded to a “pop-up protest” at about 12.40am on Saturday.
  “The protest group, carrying Australian flags and chanting, eventually walked
  to Flagstaff Gardens, where they dispersed at about 1.25am,” the statement
  said. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Footage of the event seen by Guardian
  Australia showed rows of people marching in unison up the empty La Trobe
  Street, led by a group carrying a banner and flags, and playing drums and
  cymbals. They all wore black balaclavas or face coverings, except for the man
  at the front of the group. Allan said: “Nazis don’t belong in this country and
  they know it. That’s why they hide behind masks in the dark.” She added in a
  statement on Saturday: “I thank police who maintained the public order. It’s
  clear they need more powers, and we’re giving it to them. “Our criminal
  anti-vilification laws come into effect next month. We will introduce powers
  for police to unmask cowards at protests after that. “We’re not afraid of
  these goons – but we won’t tolerate them either.” Police alleged an
  altercation occurred during the protest when a 26-year-old man confronted the
  group and was assaulted. “The man, of no fixed place of abode, was taken to
  hospital with non-life-threatening injuries and the investigation into the
  assault remains ongoing,” the police said in a statement. “No arrests were
  made throughout the protest and police had a strong presence to maintain
  community safety and to prevent any breach of the peace. “Victoria police
  respects the right to protest. However, there is absolutely no place for
  antisemitic, racist or hate-based behaviour in our society and police will not
  tolerate such activity.” In a second incident police believe was linked the
  first, officers attended the Bacchus Marsh train station to monitor a planned
  event. “Members of local and specialist units responded to both the event and
  a counterprotest to that event, about 9am,” police said in a further
  statement. Police said there were no assaults and no arrests were made at the
  second gathering. The state opposition leader, Brad Battin, put out a
  statement on Saturday condemning “last night’s scenes of intimidation”.
  “Protesters are now travelling from interstate to join these hateful rallies,”
  Battin claimed. The shadow police minister, David Southwick, used a Saturday
  press conference to criticise the Victorian government, saying police were
  “doing their job with one arm tied behind their back”. Southwick argued that
  because Victoria was the only state without a permit registration system for
  protesters and without move-on laws, police at the overnight incident had “to
  chaperone the protesters because they can’t arrest them”. (The ACT’s National
  Capital Authority also does not require formal approval to conduct a
  demonstration.) Southwick called for the stronger anti-vilification laws to be
  introduced sooner. “Why wait till September for these laws to come into play?
  Bring them in now. We’re back in parliament next week. Let’s bring them
  forward. Let’s do whatever’s needed. Let’s bring the mask laws in.” He also
  suggested that the group behind the march led a “recruitment drive”
  immediately afterwards.
