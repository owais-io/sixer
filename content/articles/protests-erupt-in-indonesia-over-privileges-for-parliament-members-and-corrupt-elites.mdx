  Riot police have fired water cannon and rounds of teargas at thousands of
  stone-throwing protesters in Indonesia’s capital as anger over the lavish
  allowances of parliament members has fuelled public anger. Thousands of
  students, workers and activists demonstrated outside the nation’s parliament
  on Monday against a monthly housing allowance of 50 million rupiah ($US3,075)
  for MPs, which is almost 10 times the Jakarta minimum wage. The demonstrators
  demanded the abolition of what they view as lavish allowances, which are in
  addition to lawmakers’ salaries. They also protested against what they termed
  “corrupt elites” within the government and policies that benefit conglomerates
  and the military, according to a press releasee from student group, Gejayan
  Memanggil. The statement was an apparent reference to the growing role of the
  military in civilian life under the government led by former general, Prabowo
  Subianto. Indonesia passed a law in March allowing for the military to assume
  more civilian posts, while this month the government announced 100 new
  military battalions that will be trained in agriculture and animal husbandry.
  In July the government said the military would also start manufacturing
  pharmaceuticals. Some demonstrators on Monday were seen on television footage
  carrying a flag from the Japanese manga series One Piece, which has become a
  symbol of protest against government policies in the country. The anger comes
  amid strict austerity measures implemented by president Prabowo, including
  cuts to education, health and public works. Police on Monday fired teargas as
  the protesters tried to approach the parliament, while protesters fought back
  by hurling rocks and bottles at riot police and setting fires under a flyover
  near the heavily guarded parliament compound. Authorities blocked streets
  leading to the parliament building, including several toll roads, causing
  severe traffic jams in the city. More than 1,200 security personnel were
  deployed to secure the compound. There were no immediate reports of injuries
  from the clash. House speaker Puan Maharani told reporters on Saturday the
  allowances had been thoroughly considered and adjusted to current prices in
  Jakarta. Graft is endemic in Indonesia and activists say police and members of
  parliament are perceived as being widely corrupt in the country of more than
  280 million people. Monday’s protest comes after violent demonstrations in
  Central Java and Sulawesi, where thousands gathered in recent weeks to protest
  hikes in property taxes. Analysts say the sudden eruption of protests may
  indicate a new level of anger and dissent toward the Prabowo government. With
