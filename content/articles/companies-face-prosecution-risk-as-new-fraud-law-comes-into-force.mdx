  Companies could be prosecuted and face unlimited fines if they fail to prevent
  fraud that their firm profits from under a corporate offence coming into force
  on Monday. Under the new “failure to prevent fraud” law, large companies can
  be held criminally liable where an “employee, agent, subsidiary or other
  ‘associated person’” commits a fraud intending to benefit the organisation.
  Examples could include dishonest sales practices, hiding important information
  from consumers or investors, or dishonest practices in financial markets. If a
  company is prosecuted it will have to prove to the court that it had
  reasonable anti-fraud measures in place. The law will apply to large
  organisations that meet at least two of three criteria: having more than 250
  employees, £36m turnover or £18m in total assets. “Today marks a pivotal
  moment for businesses, and this new offence strengthens our anti-fraud culture
  to protect businesses, build corporate trust and support long-term economic
  growth,” said David Hanson, the fraud minister. “Fraud is a shameful crime and
  we are determined to bring those responsible to justice wherever it takes
  place.” The law firm Irwin Mitchell said it marked a “fundamental shift” in
  corporate accountability by removing the previous need to prove that senior
  management were complicit. It said that failure to comply with the new law,
  under the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act, could result in
  unlimited fines, reputational damage and criminal investigation by the Serious
  Fraud Office or Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). “The new offence will have a
  significant impact on organisations and their risk exposure,” said Colette
  Kelly, a regulatory specialist and partner at Irwin Mitchell. “[However],
  whether procedures are deemed to be sufficient will be a matter for the court
  to establish, and until we start to see the outcome of prosecutions this is
  somewhat of a watching brief.” Recent figures from the Office for National
  Statistics showed a 31% increase in fraud last year. The Home Office said the
  new offence was intended to encourage organisations to build an anti-fraud
  culture, in the same way the failure to prevent bribery legislation did when
  introduced in 2010. “The new law represents a major step forward in holding to
  account those who commit corporate crime,” said Hannah von Dadelszen, the
  CPS’s chief crown prosecutor leading on fraud and economic crime. “Large
  organisations must act to put robust fraud prevention systems in place or
  leave themselves open to legal action.” Irwin Mitchell said businesses should
  be undertaking a review of fraud risk assessments, update internal controls
  and ensure that staff and third parties were trained and aware of
  whistleblowing procedures.
