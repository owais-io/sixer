  47 min: It doesn’t take long for Minteh to cause Garner some more problems.
  The winger latches on to a ball in behind and wriggles past his marker but the
  cutback doesn’t find a Brighton player. 46 min: One change at half-time,
  Carlos Baleba, who has been short of full fitness after an injury in
  preseason, is withdrawn for Jack Hinshelwood. We’re back underway! Gary Naylor
  has landed on something here: Perhaps a new stadium is worth a goal because
  Brighton shouldn’t be behind here. It’s certainly been an entertaining half at
  Hill Dickinson but the visitors will be wondering how they aren’t at least
  level. Brighton have hit the post and bar, while missing two very simple
  chances. 45 min: How have Brighton not scored? That is awful from both teams.
  Firstly Tarkowski plays a no-look pass that puts O’Riley one-on-one with
  Pickford on the penalty spot. The outcome is just as bad from the Brighton
  man. With all the time in the world he tries to round Pickford, fails and then
  his low shot is easily saved. I cannot stress how simple a chance that was.
  Everton living a charmed life. We’ve got two minutes of added time. 41 min:
  Another moment of danger in the Brighton box as Grealish gets one-on-one with
  Wieffer again. The Everton man pokes is back to Garner to sweep in a deep
  cross which is headed back across goal where Grealish cannot bring it in. 40
  min: A couple of bookings in quick succession. First Iroegbunam goes in late
  on Ayari, then Wieffer is forced to bring down Grealish after Barry wins a
  decent first header. 38 min: Brighton hit the woodwork again! Who had Van
  Hecke 30-yarder on their bingo card? The defender lines up a shot from and
  beats an outstretched Pickford, who sees the shot ping back off the post. Kári
  Tulinius has emailed in with some praise for Everton’s goalscorer: Iliman
  Ndiaye is a brilliant footballer, which he showed by not only getting to the
  end of Grealish’s cross, but also pouncing on a loose ball in midfield and
  setting the attack in motion which netted him his historic goal. For Everton’s
  sake, they need to hold on to him. Hard to disagree with that. 34 min: Tim
  Iroegbunam goes close to doubling Everton’s lead. The midfielder does
  incredibly well to hold off two Brighton defenders and get the space to shoot
  but can’t find the target with his stinging strike. That was a good chance. 32
  min: Minteh is having a lot of joy down the right. This time Dunk picks him
  out and the winger’s first touch takes him away from James Garner and into the
  box. The ball comes to Welbeck but Everton do well to get back and block the
  shot. 28 min: De Cuyper is booked for a wrestle with Ndiaye that ends with the
  Everton man getting away and having his shirt pulled. 27 min: Brighton respond
  well to the outpouring of emotion from the home fans after the first goal as
  Matt O’Riley finds a pocket of space just outside the Everton box but his
  effort is neither a shot or a cross and it drifts harmlessly wide. That’s a
  historic goal and Grealish makes it! Barry does well to hold up the ball and
  Everton sweep it left to Grealish, who bursts into the box, stands up Wieffer
  and fires across goal for Ndiaye to nod in. It’s a great move and shows the
  value of having a player of Grealish’s quality in the team. 19 min: Brighton
  should be ahead. Welbeck misses a glorious chance after great work from Minteh
  to muscle Idriss Gueye off the ball. In truth the winger’s cutback is just
  behind Welbeck, who is off-balance and puts it over the bar. 18 min: Wow!
  Mitoma almost has the first goal at Hill Dickinson with an incredible effort
  that clips the top of the bar. It’s just a long ball from Verbruggen that
  neither Tarkowski or O’Brien deal with, Mitoma brings it down and flicks it
  over the centre-back’s head before crashing a shot that is dipping as it hits
  the bar. Pickford well beaten. 17 min: There’s a big roar as Barry gets
  slipped in behind the Brighton defence after Baleba gave the ball away in
  midfield. The pass was overhit and Barry was offside but that was a let-off
  for Brighton. 15 min: Wieffer v Grealish is going to be fun. The Everton man
  brings down a long, raking ball with a wonderful touch but is immediately
  clattered. 12 min: Brighton’s first shot comes in from Yasin Ayari after a
  tidy bit of football on the left. A free-kick gets awarded to Everton, not
  sure what that’s for. 10 min: The pattern has settled a little more now, with
  Brighton enjoying a spell of possession but not doing a lot with it. 7 min:
  Jordan Pickford makes a hurried dash out to the right to cut out a ball over
  the top to Yankuba Minteh. Brighton waste the throw. The visitors look a
  little nervy. 4 min: Iliman Ndiaye gets the first shot away as he wriggles
  away from Yasin Ayari but his effort from the edge of the box is easy enough
  for Bart Verbruggen. 2 min: Everton need to ride the positive emotions here in
  the opening stages. Grealish definitely feels that and gets the crowd up by
  battling doggedly for the ball up against Mats Wieffer. Brighton kick us off
  and we are underway! The players are out and there is a waft of blue smoke
  from the pre-match pyro. Kick-off next. The atmosphere is building at Hill
  Dickinson. They just interviewed Peter Reid on Sky and you could barely hear
  him over the noise in the stadium. Team out shortly. Everton v Brighton is not
  the only 2pm kick-off in the Premier League today. In Croydon we have ‘El
  CAS-ico’ as Nottingham Forest travel to Crystal Palace. Scott Murray is on for
  coverage of a testy one at Selhurst Park: As Moyes hinted at in his chat with
  Sky, the road to Hill Dickinson Stadium has not always been smooth for
  Everton. Now they are in, there are hopes it can transform both club and
  community. More from Andy Hunter: After the PSR issues that have dogged
  Everton in the last couple of seasons, Daniel Friedkin’s regime has loosened
  the purse strings. There’s been seven signings so far this summer for a total
  of around £80 million, with Tyler Dibling looking likely to take that figure
  above £100 million. Reports suggest the Southampton winger will be arriving in
  a deal worth around £42 million, but that wasn’t agreed in time for Dibling to
  be in the squad today. Andy Hunter with (second) first impression of Everton’s
  new home: Just arrived at Hill Dickinson Stadium and first impressions (not
  counting the previous first impressions from February’s test event) are
  extremely positive. It’s a beautiful day, so that helps, and thousands of fans
  were here early to check out Everton’s magnificent new home on the banks of
  the River Mersey. There were plenty of helpful stewards at Sandhills train
  station to guide people. And hand out Everton Mints at the exit. Nice touch.
  It took 16 minutes to walk from Sandhills to the entrance to the stadium on
  Regent Road. Inevitably, there appeared to be some teething issues with
  confusion over road closures, where coaches should park and which entrances to
  use. There was also some congestion in certain parts of the outside concourse.
  But it is day one as a fully functioning Premier League stadium. The media
  facilities are very impressive – a niche point, admittedly – and the same
  friendly faces who staffed the press room at Goodison Park for years
  (including floor manager Lisa Hynds) have transferred across. Tony Hibbert is
  here too. A real blast from the past. So Everton’s new stadium is up and
  running. Will the same be true of David Moyes’ team? David Moyes has had a
  quick chat with Sky Sports during the warmups. The Everton boss was say
  slightly awkwardly between Pien Meulensteen and Phil Jagielka but managed to
  say some nice things about leading out Everton today: “It’s a day in history
  for everyone here. We’ve got a fantastic, new-looking stadium, now we need a
  team to match it. I’m hugely privileged (to be in charge) – it was regularly
  talked about in my first spell here, but things kept falling down. For me to
  come back as the manager here, it’s a great thrill for me. I’m the fortunate
  one who gets to lead the team out today.” Everton XI: Pickford, O’Brien,
  Tarkowski, Keane, Iroegbunam, Garner, Gueye, Ndiaye, Dewsbury-Hall, Grealish,
  Barry. Subs: Onyango, Armstrong, Aznou, Alcaraz, Coleman, Chermiti, Beto,
  McNeil, Travers. Jack Grealish starts his first game, coming in for Carlos
  Alcaraz (not that one) and Thierno Barry comes in for Beto. Brighton XI:
  Verbruggen, Wieffer, van Hecke, Dunk, De Cuyper, Baleba, Ayari, Minteh,
  O’Riley, Mitoma, Welbeck. Subs: Steele,Gruda, Hinshelwood, Milner, Boscagli,
  Kadioglu, Gomez, Veltman, Coppola. Brighton’s one change is enforced,
  Georginio Rutter has a slight knock and drops out of the squad, that allows
  Danny Welbeck to start up top. It is more than a year since Brighton departed
  Goodison Park for the last time. It was an emotional day for the hosts, as
  what should have been a start to a glorious to the final season at their
  famous old home turned sour. By full-time, Everton fans were streaming out of
  the ground as Brighton eased to a 3-0 win. So it is that the Seagulls are also
  Everton’s first visitors of the season for the 2025-26 campaign, but much has
  changed in the last 12 months. Everton have a different manager in the dugout
  and a different owner in the stands. Ashley Young is no longer the starting
  right-back. Jack Grealish has arrived to try and earn a spot on the plane to
  North America for next summer’s World Cup. Am I missing something? Ah yes,
  we’re at Hill Dickinson Stadium now. A spaceship has landed at Bramley-Moore
  Dock in the shape of a 52,000-seater modern venue and there is, as is
  customary, a swell of positivity rolling in off the Mersey. David Moyes has
  already avenged that opening day rollicking from last season, by guiding
  Everton to an ugly 1-0 win at the Amex in January. His West Ham teams never
  did that well against Brighton but he has spoken about making Everton fans
  fall in love with their new surroundings. His side will need to be better than
  they were against Leeds on Monday night, at least. Fabian Hürzeler should have
  had his first win of the season already. Brighton’s performance against Fulham
  wasn’t that inspiring but to concede from a set-piece with almost the game’s
  last kick was cruel. The Seagulls are not known as heartbreakers. If anything
  they regularly provide a cure for long winless runs or spells of poor form -
  Dr Brighton, if you will. On any other occasion, this would be a game the
  Seagulls would be targeting for victory if they want to fulfil their owner’s
  lofty goal of European qualification. This Everton side represent a pretty
  good opportunity for an away win, but the new stadium is a complicating factor
  and also a point of interest. Let’s just hope it’s not 0-0.
