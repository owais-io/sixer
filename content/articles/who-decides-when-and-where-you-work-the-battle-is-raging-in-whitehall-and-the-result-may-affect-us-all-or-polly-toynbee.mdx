  Remember Jacob Rees-Mogg, Brexit opportunities and government efficiency
  minister, lurking round Whitehall offices to leave sarcastic printed cards on
  any empty desk: “Sorry you were out when I visited. I look forward to seeing
  you in the office very soon. With every good wish”? The following year his
  government ordered the entire civil service to attend the office a minimum of
  60% of the time. That has led to strikes and disputes over hybrid working,
  including at the Land Registry, among Metropolitan police civilians and at the
  Office for National Statistics (ONS). Covid taught many lessons: one of the
  best was discovering that people can work flexibly, need not waste time and
  money commuting, and can take jobs far from home while employers recruit the
  best from anywhere. The ONS is in so much trouble, from top to toe, you might
  think it would hasten to resolve this morale-lowering dispute, which appears
  symptomatic of what went wrong with its recently departed leadership. This
  week it hit yet more trouble, delaying crucial retail sales figures to carry
  out further data “quality assurance”. Public and Commercial Services Union
  (PCS) members have voted yet again to continue their 18-month-old dispute with
  the ONS: 68% voted for strike action on a 71% turnout. It’s been an oddly
  quiet dispute: staff went on working their usual hybrid patterns, for their
  usual pay. But ONS bosses feel obliged to follow the 2023 civil service edict
  to dragoon staff into the office. This time staff are taking zero-attendance
  action. “What impact has hybrid working had on the ONS?” I asked the ONS
  spokesperson: the nation’s statisticians should have the best grasp on any
  research. Being an honest outfit, the press officer said: “We don’t know … We
  suspect there might be a bad impact, especially on younger staff, but it’s
  hard to quantify.” He said there was flexibility, and department leaders made
  special arrangements for some. Indeed, I spoke to one half of a couple working
  for the ONS, who were mystified as to why one of them could work from home
  while the other had to attend five days a week. The PCS general secretary,
  Fran Heathcote, argued last year that “applying arbitrary targets on office
  attendance doesn’t increase productivity and is unpopular with staff”. She
  said that if the government “want a motivated, hard-working workforce,
  ministers should trust their own employees to have some say over their working
  conditions”. The employees are mostly data analysts, many not only with maths
  or science bachelor degrees, but masters too: I spoke to one among many with
  PhDs. They are hard to recruit and harder to retain: other government
  departments pay more and the private sector a lot more. That makes flexibility
  and good treatment especially valuable. Autonomy and flexibility are so highly
  prized that research from the global expert Nick Bloom, a British professor of
  economics at Stanford University, suggests that people value it as much as an
  8% pay increase, making them happier and more productive when working partly
  from home. Women are far more likely to quit if forced back to full-time
  office working: compelling a daily commute narrows their choices and widens
  the pay gap. This is a dilemma mostly of the higher-paid. About 60% of the
  workforce are fully at their place of work: you can’t serve in a shop, teach,
  nurse, care, cook, keep the sewers and electricity flowing or build from home.
  From scaffolders to surgeons, many have no choice, but the office-based are
  more likely to be graduates. WFH has settled into an average of a quarter of
  all working days, a revolutionary five-fold increase on pre-Covid figures. At
  first sight, Nigel Farage seems again to miss the popular heartbeat when he
  pledges “no more working from home” in the 10 councils his party controls. It
  was enjoyably typical that his party was caught out advertising nine
  organising jobs as “home working with occasional travel”. But he does catch
  that macho management spirit, anti-civil service, anti-office workers,
  anti-graduates by implication. It’s a class gesture. It chimes with the
  Trump-Musk assault echoed among the titans: JP Morgan Chase, BlackRock, Amazon
  and UPS re-imposed five days in the office. Google’s co-founder Sergey Brin
  sent a memo claiming, “60 hours is the sweet spot of productivity”. Like most
  posturing, this suggests insecurity and incapacity among managers: if they
  can’t see hands on keyboards, how do they know work is done? Some employers
  need to catch up with Angela Rayner’s radical shift in power towards the
  workforce, arriving soon with her employment rights bill. Employers will need
  to give good reasons for refusing what the Chartered Institute of Personnel
  and Development (CIPD) predicts will be more than a third asking for flexible
  and hybrid working. For those rooted to their workplace, they suggest
  alternatives such as compressed working in four-day weeks. Many employers do
  get the message: 41% tell a CIPD survey that increased home/hybrid working has
  led to increased productivity/efficiency; only 16% say the opposite. In a
  country where the best jobs are concentrated in London and the south-east,
  where housing is beyond the reach of most, hybrid working opens the door to
  the most competitive roles without the associated housing and commuting costs,
  letting employers choose from far afield. Flexibility has to work both ways –
  but most people want good contact with their offices. Sadly I hear of young
  people with London jobs wanting to work more from their office but unable to
  afford the commute. The ONS could lead the way out of this Rees-Mogg nonsense.
  Its confession that neither its employment figures nor its wealth statistics
  are reliable enough to use follows a devastating inquiry by the Commons public
  administration committee whose chair described a grossly dysfunctional
  hierarchy where the chief statistician behaved like a “hybrid of a Medici
  prince and Blofeld” in a “boosterish chumocracy”, while the ONS itself
  reported poor communication between the leadership and junior staff. Earlier
  this month the ONS acquired a new permanent secretary, with a chance to blow
  away old management and civil service attitudes. The PCS is optimistic.
  Abandoning needless presenteesism, the ONS might win back prizes it used to
  earn as a “best place to work”. All this is a destructive and pointless tug of
  war over power. Managers may prefer to see people at desks, but for many who
  take jobs while carefully calculating rents, house prices, commuting costs and
  childcare complexities, flexibility is not a nice-to-have feature but the
  difference between taking and leaving a job. It matters far more to the staff
  than to the Rees-Mogg/Faragist macho management poseurs. Roll on Rayner’s new
  law. Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist
