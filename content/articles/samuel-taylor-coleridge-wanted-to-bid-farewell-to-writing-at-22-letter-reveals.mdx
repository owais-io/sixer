  He would go on to write The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Kubla Khan, two of
  the greatest English poems. But in a letter written when he was 22, Samuel
  Taylor Coleridge revealed he was contemplating packing it all in and fading
  into obscurity. The letter, which is being offered for sale by the London rare
  books and manuscripts dealer Bernard Quaritch, details his low mood and
  disappointment in love, and appears to allude to an opium addiction. The young
  Coleridge writes he is finishing a work of “consequence”, believed to be his
  long philosophical-political poem Religious Musings. But he adds that he is
  planning to “bid farewell forever” to the stress of writing. “I mean to retire
  into obscure inactivity, where my feelings may stagnate into peace,” he
  writes. Donovan Rees, the head of English books and manuscripts at Bernard
  Quaritch, described it as a “sliding doors moment” for Coleridge. Rees said:
  “If his friends hadn’t stepped in at the right time, and taken him off to
  Bristol and to his future meeting with William Wordsworth, it is entirely
  possible his genius would never have revealed itself, and that his depression
  and laudanum addiction could have led to a very different fate. “Certainly on
  the basis of what he had published up to that point he would have only been a
  footnote in the history of English poetry.” The letter was written to his
  friend George Dyer, a leading English radical who championed the young
  Coleridge, in January 1795, shortly after he left the University of Cambridge.
  It almost certainly alludes to Coleridge’s infatuation with Mary Evans, with
  whom he had been in love since his schooldays. The news of her engagement to
  another man brought “bitter disappointment” – as he puts it in the letter. In
  what may be allusions to both lost love and opium, he says in the letter: “My
  delirious imagination had early concentrated all hopes of happiness in one
  point – an unattainable point! This circumstance has produced a dreaminess of
  mind, which too often makes me forgetful of others’ feelings.” He thanks Dyer
  for “a very flattering review of a very indifferent composition of mine”, The
  Fall of Robespierre, a three-act play that Coleridge and Robert Southey wrote
  with the intention of raising funds for “pantisocracy”. This was a scheme to
  found a commune in rural Pennsylvania with 12 men and 12 women who would marry
  and bring up their children in an equal society without private property.
  Coleridge is deprecating about some of his first poems, published in the
  newspaper the Morning Chronicle, though writes that two are “not so bad as the
  rest”. Soon after writing the letter, he headed to south-west England and met
  Wordsworth. In 1798, the pair published a joint volume of poetry, Lyrical
  Ballads, considered to be a starting point for the English romantic age. A
  standout in the collection was Coleridge’s The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. In
  1797, Coleridge put his quill pen down on the wondrous Kubla Khan, which he
  apparently wrote after experiencing an opium-influenced dream. Rees said it
  was possible Coleridge was being a little dramatic in the letter. “There is
  clearly an element of performance – Coleridge is writing to an older and more
  experienced man whose opinion he very much respected. “I think we see two
  sides of Coleridge here. He is both fishing for compliments and yet also
  self-critical and not satisfied with what he has written so far. “Luckily Dyer
  does seem to have risen to the occasion and provided Coleridge with enough
  encouragement that he didn’t retire into obscurity. His was a candle destined
  to burn bright and hard, not to fade and gutter.” The Coleridge letter, which
  has a price tag of £10,000, is one of 80 items in Bernard Quaritch’s new
  catalogue of English books and manuscripts from 1500 to 1840.
