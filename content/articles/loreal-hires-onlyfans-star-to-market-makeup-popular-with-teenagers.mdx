  Global cosmetics giant L’Oréal has recruited a model famous for filming
  pornographic content on the OnlyFans adult website to promote a makeup brand
  popular with teenagers. Ari Kytsya, a US-based adult performer, has been hired
  as a new brand ambassador for Urban Decay, a line of makeup sold in Boots and
  in other high street stores globally. Kytsya, who describes herself as a
  “mattress actress”, a euphemism for an explicit content creator, has a dual
  online persona. She produces hair and makeup tutorials and lifestyle
  influencer content for the more than 4.6 million followers she has on
  Instagram and TikTok. Her account on OnlyFans, the platform used by millions
  for its adult content, offers subscribers nude images and videos of her
  performing sex acts. Penny East, the new chief executive of the Fawcett
  Society, the UK’s leading charity campaigning for women’s rights and gender
  equality, said the brand’s decision to collaborate with an OnlyFans star broke
  a new threshold in the mainstreaming of the controversial website and its
  explicit content, warranting “legitimate concern”. The decision to work with
  Kytsya appears to contravene L’Oréal’s own “Value Charter”, which sets out the
  ethical standards that must be adhered to by influencers who are partnering
  with their brands. The charter says influencers must share L’Oréal’s “ethical
  principles” and must not previously have posted pornography and other “content
  which is at odds with our values of respect, tolerance and inclusion”. L’Oréal
  defended the collaboration, praising Kytsya for her openness in talking about
  “the joys, challenges, and risks of the industry she works in”. But the
  Fawcett Society CEO questioned whether Kytsya represented an appropriate
  choice by L’Oréal as a role model for the young women who buy its cosmetics.
  “We have concerns about the thousands of very young women joining the site in
  the hope of finding fame and fortune. The majority of OnlyFans creators make
  very little money and the pressure to find a niche is pushing women to make
  increasingly explicit content,” East said. “Ari Kytsya is one of the few
  successes. She is a hugely popular and engaging influencer, with a large
  following across all social media platforms. She also creates highly explicit
  and pornographic content on OnlyFans. The move to put OnlyFans content
  creators in high-street commercial makeup campaigns will only serve to make
  OnlyFans a more enticing prospect for young girls.” The advertisement, which
  has been viewed by more than 18.7 million people on Urban Decay’s TikTok page,
  contains pixellated images of Kytsya, with a sensitive content warning,
  beneath the headline “UD likes it raw”. Kytsya tells viewers that “censorship
  is out of control” and calls for “uncensored makeup” that performs “on stage,
  on camera and yes on mattresses”. Founded in 1996, Urban Decay was bought by
  L’Oréal in 2012 and is known for its provocatively named products, such as
  “Perversion” eyeliners, “Naked” eye shadows and “All Nighter” setting sprays.
  L’Oréal’s communications team supplied a comment on behalf of an Urban Decay
  spokesperson, saying: “Urban Decay partners with a diverse range of talent who
  represent the many facets of creative expression. Urban Decay chose US creator
  Ari Kytsya for her distinctive makeup artistry and her authenticity. She is
  known for her open and transparent dialogue with her community, fostering
  conversations about her personal experiences, including the joys, challenges,
  and risks of the industry she works in.” Kytsya frequently promotes the
  advantages of going into the adult content creation industry, promising TikTok
  followers that it can prove a lucrative career choice. “The thing about my job
  is if you go full out you can make enough money to start your own thing
  whether that’s buying houses or doing Airbnbs and investing,” she says. She
  also offers practical advice to followers who are considering working in this
  world, encouraging them to make sure they get tested regularly for sexually
  transmitted infections. She acknowledges that there are “dangers” involved in
  the work, and recommends that girls “who have just turned 18” should not rush
  into the adult industry. “Take time to think about it before you do it.”
  Concern about L’Oréal’s brand collaboration follows increasing unease about
  the extreme behaviour promoted by high-profile adult performers who share
  their material on the OnlyFans platform. Visa and the drinks brand Diageo last
  week pulled advertisements from a Channel 4 documentary 1,000 Men and Me about
  Bonnie Blue, another adult performer who became famous on the site. OnlyFans
  had refused to host videos of her attempt to have sex with 1,000 men. Farhad
  Divecha, CEO of AccuraCast, an international digital marketing agency, said he
  was unaware of other mainstream global brands using adult content creators to
  advertise their products. “Today’s society is much more accepting of
  advertising like this than it might have been five or 10 years ago. Brands
  want eyeballs. As a marketer, I see untapped potential in those sites,” he
  said. “It might not hurt Urban Decay if the controversy provokes extra
  visibility.” Kytsya thanked Urban Decay for hiring her, commenting: “Most
  brands tend to hesitate when it comes to collaborating with me because of the
  kind of content I create.” OnlyFans did not respond to an approach for
  comment.
