  New York City has declared the deadly legionnaires’ disease outbreak in
  central Harlem over, nearly three weeks since it began. On Friday, city health
  officials announced that there have been no new cases among residents who live
  or work in the area since 9 August. As of Friday, there have been 114 cases of
  legionnaires’ disease, with 90 people hospitalized – six of those remaining in
  hospital – and seven deaths. In a statement on Friday, New York City’s mayor,
  Eric Adams, said: “Today marks three weeks since someone with symptoms was
  identified, which means New Yorkers should be able to breathe a sigh of relief
  that residents and visitors to central Harlem are no longer at an increased
  risk of contracting legionnaires’ disease – but our job here is not done.” “We
  must ensure that we learn from this and implement new steps to improve our
  detection and response to future clusters, because public safety is at the
  heart of everything we do … This is an unfortunate tragedy for New York City
  and the people of central Harlem as we mourn the seven people who lost their
  lives and pray for those who are still being treated,” he added. The disease
  is a serious form of pneumonia caused by the legionella bacteria, which can be
  spread from water systems and devices to people. Such water systems include
  showerheads, sink faucets, hot tubs, decorative fountains, large plumbing
  systems and cooling towers. Following an investigation, health officials were
  able to trace the bacteria to cooling towers atop the city-run Harlem hospital
  and a nearby construction site overseen by the city. According to the Centers
  for Disease Control and Prevention, the most common way for someone to get
  sick is by breathing in mist containing legionella. Another way that the
  disease can be contracted is if someone accidentally swallows contaminated
  water and it enters their lungs, also known as aspiration. Most healthy people
  who are exposed to the bacteria do not get sick. Those who are more
  susceptible to contracting the disease include current or former smokers and
  people aged 50 years or older, as well as those with specific health issues.
  Symptoms usually develop two to 14 days after exposure to the bacteria and
  include cough, fever, headaches and muscle aches as well as shortness of
  breath. Other symptoms include confusion, diarrhea or nausea. Following the
  outbreak, all facilities with legionella-positive test results completed full
  cleaning and disinfection as directed by city officials. Michelle Morse, New
  York City’s acting health commissioner, said: “As the city’s doctor, my
  thoughts are with everyone who has been impacted by the spread of legionella,
  and our hearts are with the families who lost a loved one … We are working
  with building owners on next steps to protect the health and safety of Harlem
  residents and to prevent future clusters.” Following the outbreak, the Adams
  administration issued a slew of new proposals that include expanding the
  health department’s capacity to inspect the city’s cooling towers, requiring
  building owners to test for legionella at least every 30 days during the
  cooling tower operating period instead of the current 90-day requirement,
  expanding the health department’s sampling capacity to conduct proactive
  sampling of building cooling tower systems, and maintaining contracts to surge
  capacity when faced with novel issues during future clusters.
