  Ben Chifley called it a “glorious moment”. On 15 August 1945 half a million
  people poured on to the streets of Sydney to celebrate the end of six years of
  war. News spread quickly after Emperor Hirohito announced that Japan had
  accepted the allies’ demand for unconditional surrender. It was a devastating
  defeat for the Japanese, whose cities lay in ruins, but in Australia there was
  relief. “An entire city felt the burdens of six weary, war-laden years roll
  from its shoulders, and plunged headlong and full-throatedly into
  celebration,” the Sydney Morning Herald reported. For the 80th anniversary of
  Victory in Japan Day, Albert “Ron” Gee Kee recalls his wartime service. Now
  101, Gee Kee was 18 when he enlisted. The war in the Pacific had begun in 1941
  and, by 1943, Japan was on Australia’s doorstep. You could either run for your
  life or join up, he says. “After the bombing of Darwin, it seemed imminent
  that the invasion could come to Australia,” he says. Sign up: AU Breaking News
  email “Living in far north Queensland right up near the war zone, there were
  rumours at that particular time after I turned 18 that there was going to be
  conscription, because most of our Australian troops were caught in Singapore.”
  More than 130,000 allied troops were captured in the fall of Singapore in 1942
  and hundreds of thousands of Australians were serving in the Middle East,
  north Africa and the Mediterranean, leaving their home vulnerable. “I didn’t
  want to go to New Guinea to fight – so I joined the navy because I thought it
  would be a better life,” Gee Kee says. But the navy posted him to Milne Bay in
  New Guinea, which he calls the “worst place in the world” due to heat, rain
  and malaria. He worked as a coder. “No messages could be transmitted or
  telegraphed over the air unless all messages were put into code and that was
  my duty.” The station covered the Coral Sea and south Pacific – “We were kept
  busy.” After about a year there he spent nine months at Gen Douglas
  MacArthur’s headquarters in Brisbane before he was deployed to the Northern
  Territory. “I was in Darwin when the war ended and so our end-of-the-war
  celebration was just by ourselves at the wireless station,” he says. He adds:
  “VP Day brings back memories of how I lived and survived during that period,
  but also that I have to remember all my friends who have now passed away.”
  After the war Gee Kee became a farmer in Tully before moving to Sydney, where
  he married Betty Fatt. They had two daughters. He’s the uncle of the purple
  Wiggle, Jeff Fatt, and grandfather of the actor Nina Liu, and he still lives
  in Sydney. A senior historian at the Australian War Memorial, Dr Lachlan
  Grant, said in six years of war – beginning in September 1939 when Nazi
  Germany invaded Poland – 1 million Australians served in the armed forces,
  from a population of just 7 million. Grant said 40,000 Australians had died in
  the war and more than 30,000 had become prisoners of war. “The Second World
  War and the defeat of Nazi Germany, Fascism and Japanese militarism was one of
  the most defining events of the twentieth century,” he said. RSL NSW is
  holding a Victory in the Pacific commemoration service at the Cenotaph at
  Martin Place in Sydney on Friday. Other ceremonies will be held at the Shrine
  of Remembrance in Melbourne, the Australian War Memorial in Canberra and the
  State War Memorial in Perth.
