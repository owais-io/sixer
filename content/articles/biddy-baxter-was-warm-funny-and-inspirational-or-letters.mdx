  Despite her reputation as a formidable, sometimes controlling, editor of Blue
  Peter, when I met Biddy Baxter (Obituary, 11 August) she exuded nothing but
  warmth and fun, entertaining us immensely with all her anecdotes. The occasion
  was a long, leisurely lunch in 2008, along with her original producers. This
  was to celebrate the awarding of a coveted gold Blue Peter badge to my then
  husband for a scientific breakthrough, which coincided with the inclusion of
  an aspirational childhood letter of his in a book marking Blue Peter’s 50th
  anniversary. Biddy’s encouraging response to it, he wrote to her, helped put
  him firmly on the path to becoming a scientist. Catriona Lamont St
  Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex • Was the Biddy Baxter obituary one you “prepared
  earlier”? John Hinkly Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire • Have an opinion on
  anything you’ve read in the Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it
  will be considered for publication in our letters section.
