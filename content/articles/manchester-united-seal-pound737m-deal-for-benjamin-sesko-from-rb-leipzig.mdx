  Ruben Amorim believes Benjamin Sesko has “the right character” for the
  manager’s overhaul of his Manchester United forward line after the RB Leipzig
  striker signed a five-year deal worth up to £73.7m. Sesko passed his medical
  at Old Trafford on Saturday morning and was introduced before the pre-season
  their friendly against Fiorentina. United are paying Leipzig €76.5m (£66.3m)
  plus a potential €8.5m (£7.4m) in add-ons for their fourth major signing of
  the summer. Amorim said: “He has the characteristics that we needed. He is
  really young, he is good in the air, he is good running the channels and he is
  good on the ball, so I think he has great potential. I think he can improve a
  lot. For sure, he is going to feel at home in our club. He is the right
  character in this group, so we are really, really happy to have him.” The
  22-year-old said: “The history of Manchester United is obviously very special,
  but what really excites me is the future. When we discussed the project, it
  was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and
  compete for the biggest trophies again soon. “From the moment that I arrived,
  I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has
  created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil
  all of my ambitions. I can not wait to start learning from Ruben and
  connecting with my teammates to achieve the success that we all know we are
  capable of together.” The Slovenia international scored 13 times in the
  Bundesliga last season and is one of Europe’s most coveted young strikers.
  Sesko’s arrival takes United’s spending to around £214m after the signings of
  Matheus Cunha, Diego León and Bryan Mbeumo. Sesko is expected to be the
  fulcrum of an attacking trident, alongside Cunha and Mbeumo. Jason Wilcox,
  United’s director of football, said: “Benjamin possesses a rare combination of
  electrifying pace and the ability to physically dominate defenders, making him
  one of the most exceptional young talents in world football. “We have followed
  Benjamin’s career closely; all of our data analysis and research concluded
  that he has the required qualities and personality to thrive at Manchester
  United. Working under the guidance of Ruben and our excellent performance
  team, Benjamin is joining the perfect environment to support him to reach his
  world-class potential.” Sesko had been among Newcastle’s summer transfer
  targets, making a higher offer in transfer fee and wages, only for the player
  to say Old Trafford was his preferred move. Newcastle’s failure to land
  potential signings – they have recruited Anthony Elanga and Aaron Ramsdale but
  have missed out on Hugo Ekitiké, Sesko, James Trafford and João Pedro – has
  prompted suggestions that Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, which owns an
  85% stake, is not as engaged as it once was. The club’s manager, Eddie Howe,
  strongly rejects such speculation but has admitted the Isak situation has
  unsettled his squad. He said: “The owners are very much engaged, as much as
  they always have been. This has been a challenging period where there’ll be a
  lot of different opinions on different subjects, but can assure everybody
  connected with Newcastle that the owners are very much behind the project and
  fighting every day for the club.” Sesko moved to RB Salzburg as a teenager
  from Domzale in Slovenia. He spent two seasons, scoring 22 goals in 44
  appearances, on loan at Liefering, Salzburg’s second-tier team. In Saturday’s
  final friendly before the Premier League campaign gets under way, Amorim’s
  side ended an unbeaten pre-season with a 1-1 draw and shootout win over
  Fiorentina.
