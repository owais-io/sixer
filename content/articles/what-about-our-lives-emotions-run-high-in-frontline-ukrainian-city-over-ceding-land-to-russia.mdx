  ‘What about our lives?’: emotions run high in frontline Ukrainian city over
  ceding land to Russia

  The city of Zaporizhzhia, an industrial hub in south-east Ukraine, is as good
  a place as any to grasp the stakes of freezing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine
  along its current frontlines, or of implementing a “land swap for peace” deal
  as envisioned by Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. Since Russian troops began
  rolling into Ukraine in February 2022, Zaporizhzhia, with its broad avenues
  and Stalin-era apartment blocks, has been a 30-minute drive from the
  frontline. It has been under near-constant attack from missiles and drones. On
  Sunday, a Russian guided air bomb hit a bus station, wounding 24 people – just
  another day of suffering in a city that has known many of them. Plenty of
  people here and in other Ukrainian towns close to the frontline are so weary
  of the sleepless nights and disrupted lives of the past years that they are
  ready for Kyiv to sign a peace deal, even an imperfect one, if it means the
  attacks will stop. But many others have a very different opinion because they
  know first-hand what it means to give Russia control over Ukrainian territory:
  arrests, disappearances and the erasure of anything Ukrainian. As Moscow moves
  swiftly to Russify occupied territory, expelling or arresting active members
  of society and introducing new media outlets and school curricula heavy on
  propaganda, a few years of Russian control may make it almost impossible for
  Ukraine to regain these territories at a later date. About one in five people
  living in Zaporizhzhia are internally displaced, from places even closer to
  the frontline or from occupied parts of Ukraine. They are living in
  Zaporizhzhia until they are able to go home. On a recent visit to
  Zaporizhzhia, in a warehouse building where a group of volunteer women were
  making camouflage nets for the Ukrainian army there was a loud and resolute
  chorus of “No!” in response to the question of whether people would be happy
  to freeze the lines in exchange for peace. “And what about our homes, our
  lives, all the things we are waiting to go back for?” asked one of the women,
  quickly becoming tearful. “Our only hope is for Ukraine to take them back, or
  we can never go home again.” Apparently on the agenda at a summit between
  Putin and Trump in Alaska on Friday is a proposal that goes even further:
  Putin has reportedly pitched the idea that Ukraine should give up the parts of
  Donetsk and Luhansk regions it still holds, possibly in exchange for small
  parts of Kharkiv and Sumy regions held by Russia and the promise of a
  ceasefire – in essence, to swap Ukrainian land for other Ukrainian land.
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy has ruled out the idea that the Ukrainian army would
  simply walk out of some territories and leave the population to Russian rule.
  But Trump has suggested it is a good idea, talking of land swaps as though
  they are an easy and fair solution. “There’ll be some land swapping going on.
  I know that through Russia and through conversations with everybody. To the
  good, for the good of Ukraine. Good stuff, not bad stuff. Also, some bad stuff
  for both,” Trump said on Monday. This idea of land swaps as a simple
  transaction belies the grim reality that would be likely to accompany such a
  move. In most of the discussions over a peace settlement in the Ukraine
  conflict, the fate of people has appeared to be afterthought, secondary to
  questions of land, military and security issues. The casual talk of land swaps
  has taken this even further. Russia’s blueprint for how it works in occupied
  areas has been constant: it uses a mix of incentive and coercion to gain
  cooperation from local dignitaries. A minority of people welcome Russian rule
  and are happy to collaborate, others do so under pressure, while those who
  refuse are kicked out or arrested. In the building of a former technical
  institute in Zaporizhzhia, the mayors and local councils of towns in the
  region still under occupation work in exile, one to each room. Most of the
  mayors have stories of being put under pressure by Russias in the early days
  of the invasion, with some being arrested and threatened. In the room for
  Enerhodar, the town where the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is based, its
  mayor, Dmytro Orlov, said more than half of the town’s population had left
  since 2022. He had first been asked nicely, then threatened, to work with
  Russian occupiers. After his deputy was arrested, he went into hiding and then
  fled to Zaporizhzhia. “It became obvious I had to leave,” he said. Back then
  it was possible to cross the frontline but now it is sealed. On the day the
  Guardian visited, a man had just arrived at the office asking for help, having
  done a 10-day drive via Russia, Turkey and Europe to cover the short distance
  between Enerhodar and Zaporizhzhia. His brother had been jailed for helping
  the Ukrainian army; he himself had just been released from captivity. He had
  arrived in Zaporizhzhia with a couple of suitcases and nothing else and was
  appealing to the local authorities to help him start a new life. Every day
  there are new, similar stories as occupation ruins lives and splits up
  families. Many of those who resisted in the early days are still lost in
  Russia’s network of torture facilities and prisons for Ukrainian detainees.
  More recently, those considered “difficult” elements, such as teachers who
  refuse to teach the Russian curriculum, have been expelled from their homes
  and banned from “Russian territory” for decades. Those who have left or been
  forced out of occupied regions have been replaced by new arrivals from Russia.
  “The Russians have brought in a huge number of people,” said the regional
  governor, Ivan Fedorov. Some of them are pensioners from icy parts of Russia
  who are lured with the promise of a better climate; others are police,
  prosecutors, teachers and other functionaries who are brought in to prop up
  the occupation regime. The idea is that after a decade or two of population
  influx and the Russian school curriculum, few in these territories will
  consider themselves in any way Ukrainian. “Their main goal is to change the
  gene pool of our towns,” Fedorov said. For many Ukrainians from occupied
  areas, ceding control to Russia in a peace deal would mean saying goodbye to
  their homes for ever.
