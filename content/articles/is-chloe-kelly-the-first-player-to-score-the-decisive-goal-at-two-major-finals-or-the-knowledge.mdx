  “Chloe Kelly scored the goal that won Euro 2022 and the penalty that won Euro
  2025. Including penalty shootouts, has anybody else scored the winner in two
  major international tournaments? And which women have dominated a whole
  competition?” asks Emma Pollard. For a player who has never started a knockout
  match at a major tournament, Chloe Kelly has had … a reasonable impact. She
  scored the winner against Germany in extra time in 2022, and the winning
  penalty in the shootout against Spain on Sunday. Kelly also set up Alessia
  Russo’s equaliser in the final, played a key role in both goals against Sweden
  in the quarter-finals, kept England in the tournament with a nerveless penalty
  in the subsequent shootout, and then scored a 119th-minute winner against
  Italy in the semi-finals. We’re not done. In 2023, Kelly scored the winning
  penalty in the shootout against Nigeria in the World Cup last 16. If you
  include the Finalissima against Brazil earlier the same year, Kelly has scored
  the winning penalty in three shootouts for England. That’s more than every
  other man and woman in England combined. Eric Dier (Colombia, World Cup 2018)
  and Trent Alexander-Arnold (Switzerland, Euro 2024) are the only players to do
  it once. Kelly’s substitute role means she hasn’t dominated a World Cup or
  European Championship finals like Carli Lloyd in 2015 or, in the men’s game,
  Diego Maradona at Mexico ‘86. But she is the first player to score the
  decisive goal – shootouts included – in two World Cup or European Championship
  finals. Hers is a modern kind of glory: from the bench, often involving extra
  time and penalties. Some greats of the women’s game have stolen the show in
  different ways. Germany’s Birgit Prinz scored in – and you’ll like this – five
  finals between 1995 and 2009. Germany won them all, four in the Euros (1995,
  1997, 2005, 2009) and one World Cup in 2007. Prinz was also part of the team
  that won Euro 2001, more of which below, but failed to score in the final. To
  find a recent example of a player grabbing the headlines at the business end
  of a tournament, you only need to go back a couple of years. The Spain
  left-back Olga Carmona followed an 89th-minute winner against Sweden in the
  World Cup semi-final by rifling in the only goal of the final against England.
  The most dominant performance across a whole knockout stage probably belongs
  to the aforementioned Carli Lloyd. In 2015, she was player of the match in all
  four of the USWNT’s knockout games. She scored in all four, too, including the
  only goal against China in the quarter-finals, the opener against Germany in
  the semis – and a hat-trick inside the first 16 minutes of the final against
  Japan. For overall impact, that’s very difficult to beat. A few other players
  are worthy of mention, though: Pia Sundhage (Sweden, Euro 1984) Semi-final
  first leg: scored Sweden’s second equaliser in 3-2 win away to Italy
  Semi-final second leg: scored both goals in 2-1 win (5-3 agg) Final: scored
  Sweden’s only goal across the two legs against England, which ended 1-1 on
  aggregate, then scored the winning penalty in the shootout (NB: The tournament
  began at the semi-final stage) Vivianne Miedema (Netherlands, Euro 2017)
  Quarter-final: second goal in 2-0 win over Sweden Semi-final: opening goal in
  3-0 hammering of England Final: equalised in the 10th minute v Denmark, then
  scored in the 89th minute to seal a 4-2 win Megan Rapinoe (USA, World Cup
  2019) Last 16: scored two penalties in 2-1 win against Spain Quarter-final:
  scored both goals in 2-1 win over hosts France Semi-final: didn’t play v
  England due to injury Final: opened the scoring from the spot in 2-0 win over
  the Netherlands Those are the best examples we could find from the Women’s
  Euros and World Cup. But if you have any from other tournaments – or we’ve
  missed something obvious – please get in touch. Won in 60 seconds “Excluding
  added time, England were ahead for one minute in the knockout rounds of Euro
  2025,” notes Chris Williams. “Assuming this is a record, how does it compare
  to previous tournaments?” Kelly’s 119th-minute goal against Italy put England
  ahead for the only time in their three knockout games against Sweden, Italy
  and Spain. Including added time, they led for four minutes 52 seconds out of
  approximately six and a half hours. We’ll focus on here on how that compares
  to previous major women’s tournaments. We don’t have the added time for
  previous tournaments so, for purposes of comparison, we’ve counted each match
  as lasting 90 or 120 minutes. Before this tournament, the winners of the
  women’s Euros who spent the least time in front were Germany in 2001. They
  were ahead for a total of 33 minutes, but the context was very different.
  While England played 360 minutes of knockout football in this tournament,
  Germany played only 188 in 2001. There are two reasons for that: there were no
  quarter-finals and the final was decided by a golden goal. Germany won both
  their knockout matches 1-0. Sandra Smisek scored after 57 minutes against
  Norway, giving Germany a lead that lasted 33 minutes. The final against Sweden
  was settled by an iconic golden goal from Claudia Müller in the eighth minute
  of extra time. The moment she put Germany ahead, the tournament was over.
  Quarter-finals were introduced to the Euros in 2009. Since then, and before
  this year, this year the team who spent the least time in front were … England
  in 2022. The total was 107 minutes on that occasion: 24 in extra time v Spain,
  56 v Sweden and 27 in the final against Germany. The briefest frontrunners
  among the World Cup winners are Japan’s class of 2011, who were ahead for a
  combined total of 42 minutes out of a possible 330 across three knockout
  games. In the quarter-final against the holders Germany, Karina Maruyama
  scored the only goal after 108 minutes. Japan then came from behind to beat
  Sweden 3-1 in the semi-finals, a match in which they led for the last
  half-hour. In the final against the United States, Japan twice came from
  behind to draw 2-2, with Homare Sawa scoring in the 117th minute to take the
  match to penalties. Japan won the shootout 3-1. When the music stopped, they
  were in the winning chair. Any suggestions from further afield? Mail us with
  your answers. Michael and Michelle “At the age of 19, is Michelle Agyemang the
  youngest England player to win an individual award at a major tournament?”
  wonders Alex Smith. Agyemang’s impact on Euro 2025 had gone into English
  football folklore even before the tournament was over. The Arsenal forward
  still hasn’t started an international match but was a threat from the bench in
  every game and scored dramatic equalisers against Sweden and Italy in the
  quarter- and semi-finals. Her story resembles that of Michael Owen, who was
  even younger when he took France ‘98 by storm at the age of 18. Owen won
  Fifa’s young player of the tournament award after scoring against Romania and
  Argentina. “In my mind, Owen was the only good thing to come out of France
  98,” said Diego Maradona a few years later. “He had speed, cunning and balls.”
  As far as we’re aware, the other England players to receive official
  individual awards were all in their 20s and 30s: Golden Ball Beth Mead (aged
  27, Euro 2022) Silver Ball Lucy Bronze (27, World Cup 2019) Golden Boot Harry
  Kane (24, World Cup 2018) Gary Lineker (25, World Cup 1986) Beth Mead (27,
  Euro 2022, shared with Germany’s Alexandra Popp) Jodie Taylor (31, Euro 2017)
  Bronze Boot Ellen White (30, World Cup 2019) Golden Glove Mary Earps (29,
  World Cup 2023) Best young player Michael Owen (18, World Cup 1998) Michelle
  Agyemang (19, Euro 2025) Knowledge archive “Are the Lionesses the first team
  to win a major international tournament after going behind in every knockout
  game?” asks Danielle Patterson. We had a similar question last year, when
  England’s men’s team beat Slovakia, Switzerland and the Netherlands after
  conceding the first goal. They didn’t go on to win Euro 2024 – spoiler alert –
  and the only example we could find at that stage was China in the 2022 AFC
  Women’s Asian Cup. This is how they did it. Quarter-final China 3-1 Vietnam
  (from 1-0 down) Semi-final China 2-2 Japan (4-3 pens; China’s second equaliser
  came in the 119th minute) Final China 3-2 South Korea (China were 2-0 down
  after 67 minutes before a spectacular fightback culminated in Xiao Yuyi
  scoring an injury-time winner) We looked at other comeback kings and queens
  who didn’t go on to lift the trophy; the link is worth clicking just for the
  story for the crazy story of Jürgen Klinsmann’s South Korea at last year AFC
  Men’s Asian Cup. Can you help? “Lucy Bronze revealed after Sunday’s final that
  she had played throughout Euro 2025 with a fractured tibia,” writes Tom
  Walters. “What other examples are there of footballers playing some or all of
  a major international tournament with serious injuries?” “England’s two backup
  keepers at Euro 2025, Anna Moorhouse and Khiara Keating, have just won a major
  trophy despite both having zero caps,” notes Tim Spargo. “Has this happened
  before?” “With Hugo Ekitiké joining Liverpool, which other players with
  palindromic surnames have featured in the Premier League (and beyond)?”
  wonders Michael Martin. “Lauren James (four) and brother Reece (two) have won
  six trophies between them in the 2024-25 season. Have any other sets of
  siblings won more in a single campaign?” asks Magnus Blair. “We all love it
  when a goalie comes up for a last-minute set piece,” states Simon Buckton,
  correctly. “But has a goalkeeper ever been flagged for offside – or better
  still, had a goal disallowed for offside?” “Port Vale have played Everton at
  Priory Road, Anfield, Goodison Park and now the Hill Dickinson Stadium,” notes
  Kevin Doran. “Is there an example of any other team having played another team
  at four or more home grounds?” “This week I’m savouring a veritable feast of
  Luxo-British football in the Conference League: Differdange v The New Saints,
  followed by Strassen v Dundee United,” writes Martin Davies. “Both games will
  take place at Differdange’s stadium. Have two British teams played European
  ties in the same stadium within 48 hours of each other before, or am I going
  to witness a first?” Mail us with your questions and answers
