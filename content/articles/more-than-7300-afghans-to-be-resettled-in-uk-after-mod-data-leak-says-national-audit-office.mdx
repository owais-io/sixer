  More than 7,300 Afghans are expected to be resettled in the UK as a result of
  a major government data breach, according to a National Audit Office report
  that raises doubts over officials’ claims of a £850m cost. The accidental leak
  by an MoD official in 2022 of 18,700 Afghans’ details who had worked with or
  for the British government led to the opening of a new route by which those
  endangered could seek relocation to the UK from their home country. The MoD
  expects 7,355 people to be resettled through the Afghanistan response route
  (ARR) as a direct result of the breach, including the family members of those
  directly affected, the NAO said. The watchdog said the government was unable
  to calculate the exact cost of its response. The £850m estimate did not
  include legal costs or compensation claims, and doubts were raised by the NAO
  about the “completeness and accuracy” of the base figure. The NAO said: “The
  MoD estimates that, as of July 2025, the government had spent around £400m on
  resettling people through the ARR and that it would spend around a further
  £450m on the scheme. “The MoD estimated the costs to the whole of government
  to be £128,000 per resettled individual, of which an estimated £53,000 would
  be met by the MoD. At the time of publication, the MoD had not provided us
  with sufficient evidence to give us confidence regarding the completeness and
  accuracy of these estimates.” The spreadsheet accidentally shared by the MoD
  comprised 33,345 lines of data containing the names and contact details of
  applicants and, in some instances, information relating to the applicants’
  family members. The NAO said the MoD did not record exactly how much it had
  spent on resettling people through the ARR scheme because it did not
  separately identify these costs in its accounting system. The government said
  it did this to maintain the secrecy of the ARR scheme while a superinjunction
  was in place preventing disclosure of both the data breach and the existence
  of the injunction itself. After the discovery of the data breach on 25 August
  2023, the MoD had applied to the high court for an injunction to prevent the
  data loss becoming public. Seven days later, the court granted a
  superinjunction – which also prevented disclosure of the existence of the
  injunction itself, when a judge accepted the MoD’s assessment of risk to the
  safety and lives of many individuals and their families. A subsequent review
  in January 2025 suggested that the cost and scale of opening the new route for
  relocation was not proportionate to the additional risk to those whose data
  had been breached. The defence secretary, John Healey, closed the ARR and the
  injunction on reporting was dropped in July. Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the
  chair of the cross-party public accounts committee, said: “After the high
  court superinjunction was lifted earlier this year, confusion still remains
  over the reported £850m historic and future costs relating to the breach, with
  the MoD unable to provide sufficient assurance over their numbers. “This
  figure does not include all legal costs or compensation claims, which
  currently remain unknown. The PAC will be examining these issues in our
  inquiry next week and I will be following developments closely as the NAO
  conducts further work to provide transparency on the figures in their upcoming
  report on Afghan resettlement schemes, with many of those needing relocation
  yet to arrive in the UK.”
