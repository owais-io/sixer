  Carlos Alcaraz has won the Cincinnati Open for the first time in his career
  after the world No 1, Jannik Sinner, his great rival, was forced to retire
  from their highly anticipated final with illness while trailing 0-5 in the
  opening set. Sinner, who had looked under the weather from the start of the
  match, explained later that he had been struggling with illness since Sunday.
  “I’m super sorry to disappoint you,” the Italian said. “From yesterday I
  didn’t feel great. I thought that I would improve during the night. It came up
  worse. I tried to come out and make it at least a small match but I couldn’t
  handle more. I’m very, very sorry for all of you. I know some of you on Monday
  maybe had to work or do something else, so I’m very, very sorry.” In 31C (87F)
  heat and 57% humidity, extremely difficult conditions but temperatures they
  have both had to navigate since the early rounds, Sinner looked completely off
  from the beginning and his condition only appeared to worsen during his five
  games on the court. Sinner opened the match with a sloppy opening service
  game, missing three of his first four first serves as Alcaraz eased to an
  early break. From the start of the set, Sinner looked determined to keep
  points as short as possible as he lashed out at forehands and accordingly
  committed increasingly wild unforced errors. Between points, Sinner walked
  gingerly and his face looked flushed. As the set wore on, his movement and leg
  drive on his strokes deteriorated. Alcaraz has not always handled himself well
  when facing ailing opponents, including on Saturday night when he struggled
  briefly against a sick Alexander Zverev. To his credit, Alcaraz offered Sinner
  no free points, maintained his own intensity and made himself look incredibly
  difficult to beat. Down 0-4, Sinner requested the trainer out on the court but
  after serving a double fault to fall 0-5 behind, he decided it was time to end
  the match. After the pair embraced at the net, Alcaraz walked over to Sinner’s
  bench and put an arm around his rival’s shoulders. Sinner then explained to
  Alcaraz that he had not been feeling well for some time but he had “tried to
  come out for the fans”. Alcaraz responded: “Don’t worry at all.” Two years
  ago, Alcaraz lost an incredible match against Novak Djokovic in the Cincinnati
  final, a match that is widely considered one of the greatest three-set matches
  of all time. Although he returned to take the title, this was not how he
  imagined it. With the trophy in his hands, Alcaraz appeared lost for words as
  he addressed the crowd. “As you said, Jannik, this is not the way I want to
  win matches, to win the trophy. I just gotta say sorry. I know and understand
  how you can feel right now. I can’t say anything you don’t know already, but
  as I say many times you are truly a champion. I’m pretty sure from this
  situation you’re going to come back stronger. You always do – that’s what true
  champions do. You really are one. Sorry and come back stronger.” Alcaraz has
  now won eight ATP Masters 1000 titles by the age of 22 – only Rafael Nadal
  achieved eight Masters 1000 titles at a younger age. Sinner’s retirement ends
  his 26‑match winning run on hard courts. Swiatek wins women’s singles title
  Third-ranked Iga Swiatek captured the women’s singles title in Cincinnati by
  defeating world No 7 Jasmine Paolini 7-5, 6-4 on Monday night. Swiatek has won
  all six meetings against the Italian, dropping only one set in those matches.
  Paolini jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the first set but Swiatek roared back to
  go ahead 5-3. Paolini broke serve to get even at 5-5, but Swiatek closed out a
  first-set victory in 56 minutes. Swiatek’s eighth ace of the match gave her a
  5-3 lead in the second set. Paolini broke serve twice in the second set and
  was within 5-4, but Swiatek was able to serve out the match for her 24th
  career singles title. She had failed to advance past the semifinals in her six
  previous appearances at the Cincinnati Open. Swiatek reached the semifinals in
  Cincinnati each of the past two years, but lost to eventual champions Coco
  Gauff in 2023 and Aryna Sabalenka in 2024. Paolini is the first Italian woman
  to reach the finals in Cincinnati. Since she was a qualifier at the Cincinnati
  Open in 2023, Paolini has reached two Grand Slam singles finals, won a Grand
  Slam doubles title and an Olympic gold medal.
