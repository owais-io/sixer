  What does British summertime mean to you? Blackberries? Picnics? Festivals?
  Ticks? This summer has been the hottest on record in the UK. As human-caused
  climate breakdown intensifies, the outdoor areas we spend time in are changing
  – and so, too, are our relationships with the land and the ecosystems we live
  in. My home is in the south of England, near beautiful woodlands. Since moving
  there in 2016, the number of ticks my family has picked up in the woods has
  increased each year, but this summer has been astonishing. For a few weeks,
  our four-year-old came home from nursery with a tick almost every day. I’ve
  had many: some tiny nymphal ones that could be easily missed. We spend time in
  Scotland, too, and find ticks often when we go there now. We’ve become adept
  at removing the blighters with a special tool, protecting ourselves and
  checking the kids – but there are dangers. Lyme disease is increasing, and the
  potentially deadly tick-borne encephalitis has also been found in the UK. In
  the US, there are 500,000 new cases of Lyme disease per year. Sometimes I
  wonder if it’s only a matter of time before the risks of spending time in
  these woods – beloved spaces, like a second home – could outweigh the
  benefits. Last week, we went down to Kimmeridge Bay in Dorset. The weather was
  glorious, we saw pale blue cushion starfish and crabs, shrimps and fossils,
  but the surrounding yellowed, parched fields were eerie, and a reminder of the
  uncanniness of this moment. I felt a jolt of solastalgia, a word coined by the
  Australian philosopher Glenn Albrecht to describe the “distress that is
  produced by environmental change impacting on people while they are directly
  connected to their home environment”. It’s a complex experience, living in
  this time of climate crisis, with a human brain that is short-termist,
  generally optimistic and present-oriented. Maybe the fields were as yellow and
  dead at the end of August when I was a child? Maybe I imagine that we used to
  see more swifts? Or butterflies? Or hedgehogs? (This is shifting baseline
  syndrome, and the statistics show both consistent declines of species and
  hotter summers.) Day to day, our summer has been good because we’ve been able
  to be outside and enjoy the sunshine. Yes, a tree in our garden has died,
  drought possibly a factor. The frogs didn’t survive, perhaps because the pond
  dried up. I don’t swim as much in the local rivers – an activity I have found
  highly therapeutic – because of pollution levels. I’m getting used to the
  feeling of solastalgia. But it’s become harder to get used to how very hot it
  has been in the past few years. I hated the extreme heatwave of 2022, where
  temperatures reached 40C for the first time (since records began) in the UK.
  With a baby and young children at home, we simply couldn’t go outside. And
  when we could, everything was dead and quiet. It was depressing and
  frightening. With the extreme heat projected in the coming decades, going
  outside in the summer will be harder: festivals and outdoor sports events will
  be too dangerous; opportunities for people to unwind and relax in nature may
  decrease. The impacts of climate change on the British summer will be unequal
  across class, race and socioeconomic lines. More deprived areas are less
  likely to have tree cover for shade. The homes of lower-income families,
  renters, those with children and ethnic minority households are more likely to
  overheat. And the countries most vulnerable to severe climate-related
  breakdown – those in the global south, who are not responsible for climate
  change caused by human activity – are facing summers projected to be much more
  deadly and violent than those in the northern hemisphere. But in the UK’s new
  heatwaves and drought, the health of ecosystems – in other words, life – is
  threatened. Wildlife can become dehydrated and struggle to find food and
  water. Trees may die; plants may reduce flowering and seed production. Without
  food plants caterpillars can’t survive, which means fewer butterflies and
  moths. If fruit ripens early, it may not be around for winter migrants such as
  fieldfares or redwings, or for hibernating species such as dormice. High
  temperatures and falling water levels threaten freshwater ecosystems by
  shrinking habitats and concentrating levels of pollutants and sewage. When I
  approached our wildlife and nature NGOs about how the British summertime is
  playing out with the living world, they were keen to tell me what we can do to
  help our non-human neighbours. Suggestions included: increasing
  moisture-retaining wildflowers in public spaces and road verges; watering
  trees; keeping ponds topped up; leaving out shallow dishes of water with
  pebbles in them so bees and butterflies can safely drink too; letting areas of
  grass grow long; creating shade with log piles. We know what the government
  and business need to do. Stop burning fossil fuels. Our leaders are going for
  economic growth at any cost, even if any cost means the collapse of the
  precious web of life on Earth as we know it. How many more record-breaking
  summers will we ignore? Lucy Jones is a journalist and the author of Losing
