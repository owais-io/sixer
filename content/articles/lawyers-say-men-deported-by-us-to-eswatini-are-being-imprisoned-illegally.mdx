  Lawyers for five men deported by the US to Eswatini, formerly Swaziland, said
  they are being denied proper access to their clients, who they said are being
  imprisoned illegally. The men from Vietnam, Jamaica, Laos, Yemen and Cuba have
  criminal convictions, but had all served their sentences and been released in
  the US, their lawyers said. The US deported them to the small southern African
  country without warning in July, claiming they were “depraved monsters”. The
  US has sent migrants to several third countries, as Donald Trump’s
  administration ramps up deportations. Eight men were sent to South Sudan in
  July, Rwanda accepted seven migrants last week and Uganda has agreed to take
  in asylum seekers. The US also deported 252 Venezuelans, first sending them to
  a notorious prison in El Salvador for four months. The lawyers said they have
  been unable to have private conversations with their clients, who are allowed
  one short video call a week in the presence of prison staff. A local lawyer
  representing the five men has been prevented from visiting them in the maximum
  security Matsapha correctional centre. The Emaswati lawyer filed a case
  demanding access to the men, but a hearing scheduled for Monday was postponed
  when the judge did not show up, said Alma David, who is representing the
  Yemeni and Cuban men. When the men, who had all been in the US since they were
  children, were first deported, US assistant homeland security secretary Tricia
  McLaughlin claimed they were “so uniquely barbaric that their home countries
  refused to take them back.” In response, Jamaica’s foreign minister, Kamina
  Smith, said: “The government has not refused the return of any of our
  nationals to Jamaica,” and would work to return any deportees to the country.
  She later said that diplomats visited Orville Etoria in prison in Eswatini on
  21 August and found him “in good spirits”. Etoria, 62, came to the US legally
  in 1976, aged 12, said his lawyer Mia Unger, of the Legal Aid Society. He was
  convicted of murder and sentenced to 25 years in prison in 1997. He obtained
  an undergraduate degree in prison, was released on parole in 2021 and was
  working in a men’s shelter and studying for a master’s degree in divinity when
  he was deported. He had been reporting to Immigration and Customs Enforcement
  as required and obtained a Jamaican passport earlier this year at their
  request. His relatives told Unger he had first been put on a plane to Jamaica
  and then removed, she said, adding that his being sent to Eswatini “makes no
  sense”. Relatives of the four other men did not want their identities
  disclosed, their lawyers said. The Yemeni man, who served 22 years in prison
  for murder and was released in 2020, had been living in Michigan and is 70,
  his lawyer Alma David said. The Cuban man, who served nine years for murder,
  is in his mid-50s and had been working for a plumbing company in Florida. He
  was released from prison after serving a separate sentence, for grand theft
  auto in 2012, David said. She spoke to both men while all five deportees were
  with guards and the prison chief, who said that only the US embassy in
  Eswatini could grant access to the men. “Since when does the US embassy have
  jurisdiction over Eswatini’s national prisons?” she said. Tin Thanh Nguyen,
  representing the Vietnamese and Laotian deportees, said the men were aged 34
  and 45 and released in 2015 and 2023 respectively. The Laotian man’s relatives
  reported he was starting to show signs of depression. “The United States is
  outsourcing their detention … to purge the United States of immigrants and
  refugees and to make a spectacle of deportations,” Nguyen said. Last month, a
  group of Eswatini NGOs challenged the country’s acceptance of the deportees on
  constitutional grounds, arguing that parliament had not been consulted and
  that the men’s human rights were being violated. An Eswatini government
  spokesperson said they would not be responding while court cases were under
  way. Ice and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request
  for comment.
