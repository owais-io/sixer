  Luis Enrique has opened the door to a Premier League move for Gianluigi
  Donnarumma after dropping him from Paris Saint-Germain’s squad for the Super
  Cup, saying he requires a goalkeeper with different qualities and leaving the
  Italy captain “disappointed and disheartened”. Manchester City, Manchester
  United and Chelsea have all been linked with moves for Donnarumma, who shone
  in PSG’s triumphant Champions League run last season. The Ligue 1 winners
  appear to have signed his replacement in the highly-rated Lucas Chevalier, who
  joined from Lille last week. Luis Enrique emphasised that the decision to
  leave Donnarumma behind, and seemingly end his PSG career, had been a
  technical one. “These are always difficult decisions to make,” he said. “I can
  definitely talk about Gigi, because he’s one of the best players in his
  position, without a doubt. He’s even better as a person. We’re looking for a
  goalkeeping profile that is different to Donnarumma. It’s always difficult to
  make the decision in these kinds of situations. My decision is a decision
  that’s been taken, it’s been supported by my club.” Donnarumma offered his own
  perspective in an Instagram post that suggested his manager’s view was not
  shared. “Unfortunately, someone has decided that I can no longer be part of
  the group and contribute to the team’s success,” a section of it read. “I am
  disappointed and disheartened. I hope I have the opportunity to look the fans
  at the Parc des Princes in the eyes one more time and say goodbye as it should
  be done. If that doesn’t happen, I want you to know that your support and
  affection mean the world to me, and I will never forget it.” Even though Luis
  Enrique appeared to be implying that Donnarumma’s ability on the ball required
  improving on, a clamour for the 26-year-old’s services is expected in England
  and beyond. He has made 74 appearances for his country, winning Euro 2020, and
  has won four Ligue 1 titles since joining PSG from AC Milan in 2021. Premier
  League clubs will be on high alert for a player who has entered the last year
  of his contract and could be available at a cut price. “If we are champions of
  Europe, we owe him a lot,” said the PSG captain, Marquinhos. “He is part of
  this history and always will be. We’re so proud of what he’s done, we thank
  him from the bottom of our hearts. We don’t know if he’s staying or going yet
  and if he’s staying we welcome him with open arms.” PSG hope to back up their
  thrashing of Inter in Munich by defeating the Europa League winners Tottenham.
  They have added to their defensive ranks by signing Ilia Zabarnyi, the
  Ukrainian centre-back, from Bournemouth for an initial £54.5m. The 22-year-old
  joined Bournemouth in January 2023 from Dynamo Kyiv and made 86 appearances
  for the Premier League side. “I’m very happy to join Paris Saint-Germain, the
  best club in the world, with the best project,” he told the club’s website. “I
  am here to give everything I have on the pitch and I’m looking forward to
  making my debut and meeting the fans.” Bournemouth have been pushing to sign
  the Lille centre-back Bafodé Diakité as Zabarnyi’s replacement and have
  generated close to £150m from sales of defenders this summer, with Milos
  Kerkez and Dean Huijsen joining Liverpool and Real Madrid respectively.
