  The Conservatives are “not close to recognising” how badly they are positioned
  for the next election, the former cabinet minister David Gauke has said.
  Gauke, a former justice secretary who also worked in the Treasury under George
  Osborne, said many in the party were not willing to fully repudiate Liz Truss
  and Boris Johnson. The party was ignoring heartland voters in the home
  counties who had turned in droves to the Liberal Democrats and was spending
  too much time fighting on Reform UK’s turf, he added. “If the next election is
  going to be about immigration and the war on the woke, it’s not going to be
  the Conservative party that are the beneficiaries of that. It will be Nigel
  Farage and Reform,” he said, in an interview with the Guardian. “Trying to
  make those issues more salient is a strategic blunder. First and foremost the
  Conservatives need to fight the next election on the economy.” Gauke
  criticised his party for spending too much time on culture-war issues where
  Farage was the dominant voice. The former MP, who has authored a major
  sentencing review for Labour set to be made law this autumn, said it was not a
  foregone conclusion that Farage would become prime minister, but depended on
  Labour kickstarting economic growth. He said to do so would mean hard choices
  for Rachel Reeves on tax rises and the pensions triple lock, as well as
  seeking a much closer relationship with the EU, saying the Labour chancellor
  “needs to talk to the bond markets more than she needs to talk to the
  parliamentary party or the British public”. He said the Tory party had not yet
  fully confronted why it had become so unpopular and had not undergone the
  transformation that Labour had after defeat at the 2019 election. “Most of the
  Labour party [MPs] felt that the Jeremy Corbyn years were an aberration and
  that they wanted to revert to something different. They found it very easy to
  repudiate, whereas quite a lot of the Conservative party looks back at the
  Boris Johnson and Liz Truss time as being proper Conservatism,” he said. “I
  don’t think the Conservative party is close to recognising how badly placed
  they are, and all the thinking at the moment is the worry about Reform. Yes,
  Reform are taking Conservative votes, but a lot of that was because the
  Conservatives just no longer looked functional.” He said the party had no
  message that would resonate with the home counties. “The aspirational,
  successful, educated voter, they voted Conservative for economic competence,
  but now looks at the Conservative party and thinks, ‘you haven’t really been
  speaking to me for a very long time, probably not since the 2015 election’,”
  he said. Gauke, who had the Conservative whip removed by Johnson in 2019 for
  voting to stop a no-deal Brexit, said he believed the Labour government had to
  be more resilient to criticism and unpopularity – and that the Reform UK surge
  in the polls was not necessarily a sign Farage was on course to be PM. “There
  will be a lot of tactical voting against Reform. [Farage] is evidently
  beatable if Labour can deliver strong economic growth. I think it would be
  hard for the Conservatives to win the next election, but they can re-establish
  themselves as the main opposition,” he said. “But if both try to say ‘Nigel
  Farage is right, but please don’t vote for him’, then I think they’re in real
  trouble.” Instead of being surprised at the polls, Labour MPs should accept
  “that being in government you are going to be unpopular”, he said.
  “Governments used to come back from deep levels of unpopularity on a regular
  basis and it can still be done. All of that has become much harder but it’s
  still fundamentally true. But you have to have a programme and there’s not
  been enough of it.” Gauke said he wanted Reeves to succeed in driving economic
  growth but that would mean tough political choices because of the high debt
  interest Britain was paying. “We are on the naughty step. If we had the same
  gilt yields as Germany, we would be paying £50bn less in debt interest a
  year,” he said. The former chief secretary to the Treasury said it was “a
  delusion that’s very popular on the left of politics” that enough could be
  raised by just putting up taxes on the very wealthy. But he said long-term
  economic confidence would come only if Reeves was prepared to signal she would
  make hard choices, including on issues that might not immediately score with
  the Office of Budget Responsibility. “It would show she is facing up to some
  of those challenges on the pension’s triple lock, on the loss of fuel duty
  revenue because of moving to electric vehicles. None of these things are
  electorally popular, but if the markets think, ‘actually this is a serious
  government’, then you get into a virtuous circle,” he said. Keir Starmer and
  Reeves should also be prepared to ask for more from the EU in terms of trade
  ties, Gauke said. “They made some really good progress earlier this year,
  there was hardly any political reaction. Be bolder. Come back to that.
  Businesses would love it if we were prepared to be bolder on the EU.” Gauke,
  who has spent time with the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, said she had
  been lord chancellor with a “sense of direction” who was effectively driving
  change at the department. Mahmood is known to be seriously considering what
  the UK could do to reform its approach to the European convention on human
  rights, including whether the government could act unilaterally on how it
  interpreted some aspects of the convention when it came to prisons or
  immigration. But Gauke said he was concerned about the UK acting alone, and
  said it would be more effective for signatory countries to press for change as
  a collective. “My sense from where Shabana is – is can it be improved? Is the
  interpretation of it much broader than we would want? And I think those are
  the right questions to be asking,” he said. “If you try and set the dynamic up
  as ‘us against the rest’, then you’re just heading for a fall, but a lot of
  the concerns that the UK has about the operation of the ECHR is reflected in
  other signatories. You’re going to have to work with other countries.” He said
  he was deeply concerned his own party would embrace the policy of leaving the
  ECHR, a move favoured by the Tory leadership hopeful Robert Jenrick. “You just
  end up with a repeat of the Brexit episodes, of our international influence
  being diminished and our reputation damaged and a big practical issue in
  Northern Ireland. I don’t know why the country would be attracted to that as
  an offer,” he said.
