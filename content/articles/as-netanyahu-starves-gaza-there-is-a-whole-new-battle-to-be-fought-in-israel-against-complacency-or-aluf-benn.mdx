  The extreme heatwave that has hit our region this week does not distinguish
  between Israelis and Palestinians. But while we Israelis hide in our
  air-conditioned houses, offices and cars, the besieged residents of Gaza can
  only add the unbearable hot and humid atmosphere to their struggle to eat,
  drink and sleep, in constant fear of death. The starvation crisis that has
  exploded in Gaza this summer, following Israeli-imposed restrictions on the
  flow of humanitarian aid, continues to worsen despite mounting international
  pressure to allow in more food, medicine and critical supplies. And the
  killing has never stopped, while Israel is preparing for the next stage of the
  war to “annihilate Hamas”. Most Israelis are self-immunised to the horrors
  being endured by Palestinians in Gaza. Told by our government and mainstream
  media that there is no starvation, only Hamas propaganda and fake news spread
  by antisemites in the western media, they see no moral dilemma. And so, after
  almost two years of fighting, life in Tel Aviv recalls the antebellum days of
  endless partying. The beaches and restaurants are packed and Ben Gurion
  airport is busy again with summer vacationers flying to Greece. Israel’s
  economic data is outperforming expectations. Antiwar sentiment is limited to
  fear for the plight of Israeli hostages in Hamas tunnels, decreasing
  motivation to re-enlist in reservist units, and growing PTSD and suicide cases
  in the military. Nevertheless, most Israelis, even diehard critics of prime
  minister Benjamin Netanyahu, would give him carte blanche to continue with the
  ongoing punishment of Gaza. This public complacency allows Netanyahu to focus
  his attention on his favourite territory of political power-plays and media
  manipulation. His current aim is subordinating the military, and the ongoing
  war gives him an unprecedented opportunity. Zoom out: throughout his long,
  embattled political career, the chief rivals of Israel’s prime minister have
  been former military leaders. Having led the country’s most revered
  institution, they have been the epitome of its old liberal establishment,
  which Netanyahu vowed to crush and replace with new elites composed of his
  socially conservative and religious supporters. Beginning with Yitzhak Rabin
  in the 1990s, Netanyahu has fought them all – military heroes such as Ariel
  Sharon and Ehud Barak and uniformed apparatchiks including Benny Gantz and
  Gadi Eisenkot – and survived at the helm. But in a country fighting a
  permanent war, political control of the military is the key to leadership, and
  Netanyahu had been restrained by the de facto veto power of the Israel Defense
  Forces (IDF) and intelligence community over war-and-peace decision-making.
  Then came the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023, which the military and
  intelligence services had failed to anticipate and to contain in time. To most
  Israelis, it was the worst disaster in the country’s history. But not to
  Netanyahu, who sensed an unprecedented opportunity to consolidate his power
  and push aside his long-term rivals. He put the blame squarely on the
  shoulders of the military and intelligence top brass and prevented an
  independent inquiry. As the war has dragged on, security chiefs have been
  purged one after another, to be replaced by the prime minister’s loyalists.
  The purges have enabled him to spin the story and credit himself for the more
  successful moves against Hezbollah and Iran, and even for the downfall of the
  Assad regime in Syria. But self-praise was not enough to make the IDF an
  offshoot of the “Bibist” personality cult. Netanyahu could only envy his
  political partner and far-right leader Itamar Ben-Gvir, who had turned
  Israel’s police and prison service into his private militia by manipulating
  the senior appointments process. In March, Netanyahu made his move to take
  over the Kirya, Israel’s answer to the Pentagon, in central Tel Aviv,
  nominating Lt Gen Eyal Zamir as the new IDF chief of staff. A broad-shouldered
  tank commander who had served as the prime minister’s military aide a decade
  earlier, Zamir had close-up knowledge of his former boss and his inner circle.
  The rightwing politicians and twitterati praised him as an “offensive”
  commander who would defeat Hamas, unlike his unlucky predecessor, Herzi
  Halevi, who carried the burden of the 7 October failure. And he was widely
  expected to preserve the draft exemption for ultra-Orthodox men, relieving
  Netanyahu of a political hot potato. At first, Zamir was quick to adapt. On 18
  March, Israel breached a short-lived ceasefire with Hamas, intensifying its
  attacks and temporarily halting the flow of food and humanitarian aid into
  Gaza. In May, the military launched another operation to “eliminate Hamas” and
  appeared in sync with the stated goal of Netanyahu and the right wing: ethnic
  cleansing of Gaza by relocating its 2 million Palestinians into guarded
  enclaves, from which the only way out would be abroad. But it didn’t take long
  for the supposed Netanyahu crony to expose a different set of priorities.
  While showing no mercy for the Palestinians, Zamir behaved like the older,
  risk-averse version of his boss, putting the safety of his troops – and of the
  remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza – above all. And he stuck to his
  predecessor’s support of Haredi conscription, issuing thousands of draft notes
  to ultra-Orthodox youth. By early August, as Hamas would not surrender,
  Netanyahu and his far-right coalition pledged to occupy the remaining
  Palestinian enclaves even at the risk of harming the hostages. This was
  Zamir’s moment of rebellion. He reportedly threatened to resign if forced into
  a risky operation that would entail long-term occupation. Netanyahu was quick
  to seize the power-play opportunity, leading as usual from behind. Yair, the
  prime minister’s son and alpha dog whistler, accused Zamir of a
  banana-republic military coup. Matters came to a head in a heated security
  cabinet meeting on 6 August, at which the chief of staff warned against
  sending his troops into what was “tantamount … to a trap” and risking the
  hostages’ lives. The compromise was a decision to occupy only Gaza City, force
  its million inhabitants out and raze it – just as the IDF had already done in
  Rafah and Khan Yunis. A two-month deadline was given before implementation,
  leaving time for a last-minute hostages-for-ceasefire deal. The power
  struggle, however, did not stop after the cabinet decision, as defence
  minister Israel Katz kept up his pressure on Zamir to bow or leave. The once
  unthinkable idea of sacking the military chief after less than six months in
  office, an almost Stalinist pace of purging, has now been normalised in the
  public sphere. The supposed potential successor candidates are “more
  offensive” generals committed to obeying the prime minister and working
  towards Gaza’s total destruction. All this unfolds amid Gaza’s starvation
  crisis and hostages suffering in Hamas tunnels. On Sunday, a mass protest and
  strike has been organised, calling for an end to the war and the return of the
  hostages. It enjoys wide support in opinion polls, which Netanyahu is trying
  to ignore. Instead, he is doubling down on his dual mission of ethnic
  cleansing in Gaza and consolidating his autocracy in Israel. And so, in an
  unpredictable twist, Lt Gen Zamir has cast himself as the unlikely leader of
  resistance to both goals – just like Netanyahu’s age-old military rivals. True
  to form, Netanyahu likes to keep his options open, while leaving his opponents
  with uneasy choices and telling different, and often contradictory, stories to
  different people. Israeli pundits debate whether he wants to end the war,
  reach a partial deal, or keep a low-level and less costly fight. Only two
  things are clear: the prime minister has an insatiable quest for power and
  longevity in office; and the death toll in Gaza from bombing and malnutrition
  keeps rising, while Israelis keep looking the other way. Aluf Benn is the
