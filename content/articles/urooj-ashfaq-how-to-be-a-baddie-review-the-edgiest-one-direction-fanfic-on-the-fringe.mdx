  Urooj Ashfaq: How to Be a Baddie review – the edgiest One Direction fanfic on
  the fringe
sectionName: Stage

bodyText: >-
  On her first visit to the fringe, Urooj Ashfaq left as the surprise winner of
  the best newcomer award. Now she returns, to rebut a descriptor widely applied
  to that 2023 debut – specifically, that her comedy is mild and lacks edge. You
  want edge, she asks in How to Be a Baddie? I’ll give you edge! And so the show
  does, to a degree – if not a degree high enough to cancel out the
  29-year-old’s unshakeable amiability and charm. In part, she explains, the
  confusion was a cultural one: back home in India, there’s nothing conservative
  (to use one of her critics’ mots injustes) about Ashfaq. She’s a standup, for
  a start, in a country where that attracts not, ahem, intelligent reviews like
  this one, but vigilante attention and online insults. Ashfaq has a choice quip
  in response to one such, and another explaining why she’s off-putting to both
  Hindu and Muslim men. The promised combative material on religion does not
  then materialise; she reads the audience’s horoscopes instead. (One off-colour
  response prompts a deft running joke about how Ashfaq’s crowd-work is
  malfunctioning tonight.) More on-message with the bad-girl theme is the
  standout section on erotica. What starts as autobiographical standup about the
  books that fuelled Ashfaq’s sexual awakening leads to a recital of some One
  Direction fan fiction, Indian-style, in which our simpering heroine has been
  sold into slavery to the X Factor stars. Memories stir of Sofie Hagen’s whole
  show about her teenage Westlife fanfic. But the Mumbai native brings a style
  all of her own to this literary epic, which includes Zayn Malik with an Arabic
  accent and jokes about Indian tweens’ murderous feelings towards their
  would-be mothers-in-law. The later sections don’t re-ascend to these comic
  heights. A section on defending her sister’s honour at school might feel
  edgier to those who better comprehend its repeated Hindi term, randi – akin to
  whore or slut. A closer on Ashfaq’s recent surgery for haemorrhoids wrings
  less juice than you’d expect out of one of those perfect-for-comedy bodily
  indignities. You may not leave convinced of Ashfaq’s delinquency, but she
  certainly proves that 2023’s success was no flash in the pan. • At Monkey
  Barrel, Edinburgh, until 24 August • All our Edinburgh festival reviews
