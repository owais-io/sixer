  Two old family photos show the same group: a short-haired woman, a girl in a
  striped dress, and a man in uniform. But there is one difference between these
  well-preserved, sepia pictures: in one, the man wears a Wehrmacht uniform; in
  the other his military dress has been altered to conceal his wartime service.
  Donated to the Museum of Gdańsk by the son of the girl in the striped dress,
  these images feature in a new exhibition about the mass forced conscriptions
  of Pomeranians into the German army. Consisting of photo albums, family
  heirlooms and oral testimonies of Poles who served in the Wehrmacht, the show
  asks whether someone can be both a victim of and a soldier for an aggressor,
  and suggests that confronting these complexities is vital to the national
  identity. Unsurprisingly, the exhibition has proved extremely controversial.
  After the German invasion of September 1939, some Polish territories,
  including Pomerania, Silesia and Greater Poland, were directly incorporated
  into the Reich. The inhabitants of these regions were registered on the German
  People’s List (Deutsche Volksliste), which classified the inhabitants of
  occupied territories. For men of conscription age, this often entailed
  compulsory service in the Wehrmacht. Those who refused to serve, deserted, or
  attempted to join the Polish armed forces or partisan groups were condemned to
  death and sent to concentration camps. Historians estimate that between
  400,000 and 450,000 citizens of the Second Polish Republic served in the
  Wehrmacht, more than the number who served in the Home Army, the dominant
  resistance movement in German-occupied Poland – a painful reality which, the
  Gdańsk museum contests, needs to be accepted to allow a more truthful
  reckoning with its past.. It is also a reality that not everyone has been
  willing to accept in the form presented. Jarosław Kaczyński, president of the
  rightwing Law and Justice party, argued on X that Our Boys blurs
  responsibility for the second world war and even partially attributes it to
  Poles. Poland’s former president, Andrzej Duda, called the exhibition’s
  portrayal of conscripted Poles as “ours” a moral provocation, regardless of
  the reality of forced service. Several Law and Justice-linked protests took
  place outside the museum, with critics accusing the exhibition of whitewashing
  history and blurring the lines between victim and perpetrator. They objected
  to the ambiguous title, which references a term used for Luxembourgers in
  similar situations (ons jongen). The Warsaw Rising Museum, which is dedicated
  to the 1944 uprising, waded into the debate. A few days after the opening of
  the exhibition in Gdansk, it posted a picture of teenage insurgents on its
  Facebook profile, signed “our boys”. A heated discussion broke out about what
  “ours” means to different people. Andreas Kasperski, who donated the two
  photographs mentioned at the beginning of the article, says the backlash has
  made him fear for his mother’s safety. “I was afraid that, by going to see it,
  she might meet someone with extremely patriotic, confrontational views,” he
  says. “Until a year ago, this would not have crossed my mind.” The museum
  stood up to its critics. “We oppose unfair and superficial assessments,” it
  said in a statement. “We regret the exhibition is being used for ad hoc
  political purposes.” The title Our Boys, it said, was meant to acknowledge
  that these were individuals from Polish communities, not to glorify them. The
  museum received support from the Kashubian-Pomeranian Association, which said
  in a statement that many critics “are not familiar with the realities of life
  in the annexed regions of Pomerania, Kashubia and Kociewie”. According to the
  organisation, the exhibition was needed because it revealed “the complex fate
  of the inhabitants, who have been marginalised in the official policy of
  remembrance for years”. Roman Rakowski, a former Polish navy commander and
  member of the paramilitary Grey Ranks who turned 100 last year, wrote an open
  letter to the museum in response to the heated debate, in which he notes the
  harsh repression and forced displacement in Pomerania and calls for a
  remembrance of those who were forced to make hard choices. “These were our
  boys, boys of their families, forced into the enemy army to save loved ones,”
  he wrote. “It is easier to judge than to face such danger.” The curator of Our
  Boys, Andrzej Hoja, says that while this complex chapter in Poland’s wartime
  history is widely accepted in Pomerania, it was difficult to give personal
  stories a fair hearing at a national level, as the existence of the German
  People’s List is not common knowledge and plays only a marginal role in the
  national curriculum. “It’s no secret at the family level,” he says. “Many keep
  pictures from that era because they’re the only photos they have. In the
  national debate, however, having a relative who was conscripted by force can
  make you an easy target. During the 2005 presidential campaign, it was
  revealed that Donald Tusk’s Pomeranian grandfather served in the German army.
  Tusk, who is Poland’s prime minister, promptly lost that election. Cezary
  Obracht-Prondzyński, a history professor at the University of Gdańsk, says the
  controversy over Our Boys exposes deep differences in how Poland’s borderland
  and central regions perceive identity. These differences are rooted in
  post-second world war border changes and the Treaty of Versailles. In cities
  such as Warsaw, Kraków and Lublin, the Polish identity was clear – Polish was
  the primary language, and Catholicism unified the people. History in these
  places focused on uprisings and resistance to foreign oppressors, and the
  distinction between locals and outsiders was sharp. However, in regions such
  as Silesia, Kashubia, Warmia, Masuria, and the Eastern Borderlands, life was
  more mixed. People spoke several languages, practised different religions, and
  often had family members who served in different armies. Outsiders could still
  be neighbours or even family members. People from the “core” areas of Poland
  found it easier to follow a simple national story – us Poles against them.
  People from the borderlands, however, lived with more ambiguity and
  uncertainty. Polishness in Warsaw or Krakow in the 19th and 20th centuries was
  straightforward and clear, whereas in the borderlands it was complex, fragile
  and open to negotiation. After the war, the dominant narrative ignored the
  experience of people in those areas. “Do we have a right to our history, to
  our memory, to nuance and detail?” asks Obracht-Prondzyński. “Without this
  openness, a narrow and unifying model risks repeating dangerous patterns from
  Europe’s past. The exhibition’s debate should serve as both a lesson and a
  warning.” • Our Boys is on at the Museum of Gdańsk, Main Town Hall, until 10
  May 2026
