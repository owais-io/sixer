  ‘The jewel in the jacksie of south London this place’ll be!” Now getting a
  40th anniversary rerelease, this classic Brit comedy from screenwriter Hanif
  Kureishi and director Stephen Frears has for me the jaunty spirit of Ealing,
  maybe because the bleeping, burping, bubbling musical theme feels like a
  recurrent motif in The Man in the White Suit. It’s a vibrant, funny,
  complicated allegory of a down-at-heel launderette in a dreary London parade
  of shops, which gets laundered and cleaned up by south Asians who are
  subjected to nothing but racist abuse. It was formerly called Churchill’s
  Laundrette and now cheekily renamed Powders, in homage to washing powder or to
  income from a different powder which this place is going to launder. It is a
  sharp, smart picture, with English eccentricity, sly quirk and political
  subversion, that represents a brilliant and almost unique engagement with
  contemporary history in 80s British cinema: a satire of Mrs Thatcher’s Britain
  which involved playing Toryism at its own game. This was the world in which
  the Conservative government brought in the Enterprise Allowance Scheme to
  bring down the unemployment-claimant figures, but found that immigration
  stimulated enterprise. Kureishi’s writing was part of the new energy of
  postcolonial literature; it came from the same place as Salman Rushdie’s
  Midnight’s Children and Timothy Mo’s Sour Sweet. There are terrific
  performances from those titans of British-Indian acting: Roshan Seth and Saeed
  Jaffrey as brothers Nasser and Hussein Ali; Nasser is a melancholy
  intellectual socialist with a drinking problem; Hussein is a rackety
  businessman, poignantly in love with his white lover Rachel (Shirley Anne
  Field). Hussein hires Nasser’s apparently gormless son Omar (Gordon Warnecke)
  to run his crumbling launderette – and Omar figures out that with a little
  imagination and by siphoning off drug profits belonging to his cousin Salim
  (Derrick Branche) he can turn this into the most beautiful and lucrative
  launderette in London. But Omar has a secret: he is gay and in love with
  Johnny, played by Daniel Day-Lewis in his first lead film role, a white punk
  tearaway who once marched in the streets with the racists but now feels
  something for Omar and remembers Nasser’s kindness to him as a child. My
  Beautiful Laundrette is a vivid time capsule for the gloomy London streets of
  that time; it’s also an essay in gentrification, like Mike Leigh’s High Hopes
  and John Mackenzie’s The Long Good Friday – and it’s a reminder of a time when
  videotapes and VCRs were almost unimaginably exciting consumer goods.
  Day-Lewis at this stage had not quite evolved into the mature screen actor
  that he was soon to be, and tough-guy fisticuffs were not exactly his forte,
  but he always sold it with conviction; this was a homophobic era when gay
  love, presented clearly and unapologetically, was a rarity. Warnecke’s line
  readings feel perhaps a little bit theatrical sometimes, but he has enormous
  charm and presence. Rita Wolf is excellent as Tania, the exasperated cousin to
  whom Omar is expected to marry but who wants and demands more. “How could
  anyone call this silly little island home?” asks one of Omar’s relatives. But
  they do, and that complex, love-hate relationship is the film’s fabric. • My
  Beautiful Laundrette is in UK cinemas from 1 August.
