  Few had it made at the beginning of 2019 quite like Jussie Smollett, an actor
  and singer who successfully navigated child stardom on the way to becoming a
  fixture on the hit TV series Empire. That was until late January of that same
  year, when news broke that Smollett had been attacked outside his downtown
  Chicago apartment in a possible hate crime. (Smollett is Black and gay.) The
  breakout details that Smollett shared early on – specifically, that he had
  been jumped by two Maga foot soldiers who doused him in bleach before placing
  a noose around his neck – both galvanized public supporters and made them
  cynical. (Really? They shouted: “This is Maga country?” In Streeterville?)
  What’s more, the police didn’t do themselves many favors by registering their
  skepticism early and loudly. Ultimately, Smollett, who was suspected of
  staging the confrontation with help from two acting acquaintances, was charged
  with filing a false police report. When those charges were dropped in a deal
  with the county prosecutor’s office, prompting cries of favoritism, Smollett
  was re-indicted, found guilty of framing himself and sentenced to five months
  of county jail. All the while Smollett was reduced to an object of global
  derision, with everyone from Dave Chappelle to Charles Barkley getting licks
  in. Explaining himself only made matters worse. Even though Smollett would win
  a conviction reversal on appeal in 2024 and has stuck to his original story,
  this idea that he manufactured outrage for clout continues to cost him his
  reputation and career. But is his story truly that far-fetched? “That’s the
  thing about this case,” says director Gagan Rehill. “It has this gem-like
  quality where you turn it one way and it looks like one thing, depending on
  who you ask, depending on their experience, depending on who they are and
  their position in this case. There’s nothing definitive.” Rehill’s latest
  film, Netflix’s The Truth about Jussie Smollett?, feels like the kind of thing
  that might well wind up on a criminology class syllabus. At the very least you
  could spend 90 minutes watching this documentary instead of poring over the
  reams of studies that have been conducted over the decades about the
  inherently fragile nature of eyewitness testimony. The Truth is an intentional
  misnomer here; the film doesn’t find the real perpetrators and isn’t liable to
  leave viewers any more certain of the positions they’ve already staked out on
  Smollett’s guilt or innocence. All that can be said for certain is: this case,
  still a head scratcher, is fit for the times. “All you have to do is change a
  news channel, and you’re given an alternate reality of what’s going on out
  your window,” Rehill says. “But in this case you legitimately have two
  competing narratives existing together.” The film spares no effort in getting
  down to the bottom of what exactly happened to Smollett. In addition to
  reviewing the stockpiles of police evidence and trial transcripts, the doc
  visits with a number of the main players in the case – including Smollett in
  an exclusive. As he begins sharing his version of events, this time with CCTV
  and other file footage providing additional context, you gain an appreciation
  for why the man would abandon the comfort of his luxury high-rise, at 2am, to
  brave -3C conditions for a Subway sandwich. (He had just arrived from Los
  Angeles, the fridge was bare, etc) Even his claim to being assaulted by a pair
  of white men gains credibility from two eyewitnesses (a neighbor and a
  security guard, both strangers to Smollett) who recalled seeing two people who
  fit that description lingering outside of Smollett’s building – and testified
  to as much in court. Why wasn’t a bigger deal made of this? Well for a start
  Smollett was tried in Chicago, not Los Angeles or New York. For another,
  cameras were only allowed for Smollett’s post-trial sentencing – just in time
  for the world to watch the judge give him a good finger wag. “The trial needed
  to be reported in a kind of measured, factual way,” Rehill says. Instead, it
  became an opportunity for overeager pundits to wallow in the void where
  genetic evidence, crime-scene video and other smoking guns might hang. “I was
  defending myself against bullshit,” Smollett huffs at one point to camera. The
  documentary does now what the trial media should’ve done at the time: ask why
  we should believe the Chicago police. It bears reminding that four years
  before Smollett fell under suspicion, the city of Chicago came under fire for
  burying dashcam footage of an unarmed 17-year-old boy whom cops shot 16 times,
  sparking public outcry and protests. With help from investigative journalists
  Abigail Carr and Chelli Stanley, the film drops a few bombshells – not least
  footage from inside the county jail that appears to show the presumed
  attackers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, conspiring with police to throw Smollett
  under the bus. It lends credence to the idea that the fix was not only in, but
  that it came from on high. (Where else could police get the idea that Smollett
  hate-crimed himself as leverage for a higher Empire wage than from the mayor
  who came from the White House with the brother who happened to run one of
  Hollywood’s largest talent agencies?) Special prosecutor Dan Webb explicitly
  went out of his way, after Smollett’s conviction was overturned, to tell the
  public that this new state supreme court “has nothing to do with Mr Smollett’s
  innocence”. Even now Eddie Johnson, the ex-police chief who directed the
  investigation at the time, calls Smollett a “narcissistic and troubled young
  man”. The public even scoffed with police when Smollett refused to hand over
  his cellphone for the investigation. In the film, Smollett doesn’t just make
  the general case for his right to privacy. He reveals his true reason for
  contracting the Osundairo boys – to score a banned herbal supplement in
  Nigeria that might help him lose weight. And to think, semaglutides were just
  four years away from becoming widely available. “Every contributor has their
  own viewpoint,” Rehill says. “Some may call that an agenda. But these are just
  larger than life characters who just happen to be saying opposite things. It
  really makes you think about the nature of truth in society.” If Smollett
  can’t be called a perfect victim, the documentary makes clear that the police
  aren’t perfect villains either. Johnson, a Black Chicago native with roots in
  the Jim Crow South, took Smollett’s lynching suggestion deeply to heart. Chief
  detective Melissa Staples, who identifies as gay, was affected by empathy
  early on as well. Training his camera lens like a loupe, Rehill has a knack
  for holding focus on one side of his figurative gem long enough for viewers to
  appreciate the clarity before pivoting it just enough to expose the flaws.
  Where that leaves his outsized characters in the end is anyone’s guess.
  Smollett is slowly rebuilding his career, the Osundairo brothers are reveling
  in rightwing fame and the principal authorities have moved on – and yet so
  many of us are still stuck on this case. “I wanted to leave the viewer in the
  end, like, not sure,” says Rehill, “because I can see how one would not be
  sure. I understand why people would look into this case further. We live in a
  society where our trust in established institutions has eroded. So if people
  are going to go out and look at this again, why not put everything out there?”
  The Truth About Jussie Smollett? is available on Netflix on 22 August
