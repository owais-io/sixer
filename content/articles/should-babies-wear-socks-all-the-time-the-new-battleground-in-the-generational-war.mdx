  Should babies wear socks all the time? The new battleground in the
  generational war

  Emma, I hear parent-internet is abuzz about baby feet. Has Hemingway’s
  six-word story gone viral? Not this time, though some may find it just as
  heartbreaking. There’s a generational divide over whether or not babies need
  socks, and it’s confusing grandparents around the world. Young parents are
  opting for barefoot babes – on TikTok, in playgrounds, at the supermarket, in
  the comfort of their own warm and cosy home. Everywhere. Are young parents
  right, or just unconcerned with icy tootsies? If I’ve learned anything as a
  new parent, it’s that we’re all just trying to get to bedtime as peacefully as
  we can without being beaten up by the world and/or our kids in the process.
  But, to answer your question, new parents are often encouraged to give their
  babies lots of barefoot time, especially if they’re learning to roll or crawl,
  as it helps give them sensory input and doesn’t limit their developing feet.
  Babies also have trouble regulating their own temperature, so in some
  situations a synthetic sock will make little feet too sweaty. In others, it’s
  still recommended to cover their feet – if you’re going outside for a walk in
  winter, for example. They’re also annoying to keep on your child’s foot when
  it’s not necessary. So, when nan and pop visit and mention the lack of baby
  footwear, it can be a little frustrating for tired and overstimulated parents.
  And how are parents expressing this frustration? On TikTok, of course. Some of
  my favourites date back years; there’s the “Sock Scan Initiated”, the “You
  sure about that?” meme, running from a serial killer but it’s an old lady
  asking where your baby’s socks are. Then there’s the “Tell me your MIL watched
  the baby without telling me” trend. Simple. Effective. Relatable. But not all
  young parents feel the same. Look at these cutie ballerina sockies. And are
  gen X grandparents fighting back? Heart-shaped socks? Black hole socks? Before
  Sockrise? As far as I know, gen X poster boy Ethan Hawke hasn’t gone public
  with his opinion on baby socks yet – but then his kids are still kids. As
  usual, everyone has forgotten about gen X – who would be grandparents to some
  young parents. Most of the blame has been laid on boomers, which makes sense
  because a lot of first-time parents are millennials, and if there’s one
  generation guilty of talking too much about generations, it’s millennials.
  Right, so it’s more a case of shake, shake, shake your booties. Sock it to me,
  baby!
