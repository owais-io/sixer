  No one wants to hear about your dreams – unless you follow my golden rule |

  As everyone knows – or ought to know – there is nothing as boring as listening
  to someone tell you about a dream they have had. This is a shame, as there is
  some good, out‑there content going begging. There could be gold in there, if
  only the dreamer knew how to deliver it. This is the problem: not the dreams
  themselves, but how bad we are at sharing them. Keenly aware of the wondrous
  magic in some of my own dreams, and anxious for no one to miss out on hearing
  about them, I have been working on my dream-telling technique. And I’ve come
  up with some guidelines. Or, rather, one guideline. There is only the one: you
  have to keep it brief. Don’t get me wrong: the dream itself has to have
  something about it, but however good it is, you have only one short shot at
  relating it before you lose your audience completely. The top line, the
  headline, is as much as most people want to hear. I’m told this is often the
  case with my column, which is disappointing, because the headline is the one
  bit I don’t write. Setting my dismay aside, I urge you to embrace this
  unfortunate reality in your dream-telling. If you do so, you won’t fritter
  away your one opportunity to get the magic across. Allow yourself – and your
  listener – a maximum of one sentence. Don’t forget, you have all but lost your
  audience anyway the moment they realise what you are talking about. So make it
  snappy or you are doomed. Let’s say you have dreamed that your legs were
  carrots. In this case, you just say: “I dreamed my legs were carrots.” That
  one sentence is plenty. Leave them wanting more, which they almost certainly
  won’t, but they will certainly be waiting – with some dread – for the “and”.
  It’s even possible that they will say: “And …?” if only in a
  go-on-get-it-over-with way. Even then, say nothing, unless pressed, which you
  won’t be. If you don’t have something truly excellent with which to elongate
  the original sentence, don’t bother. In this case, something like “… and one
  of them turned into a cricket bat” might just pass muster. But that really has
  to be the end of it. If you ever hear yourself saying: “And then …” abandon
  ship at once. It’s over. Because with “and then” you are signalling the story
  could go on for ever – and you will have turned your dream into your
  listener’s nightmare. • Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian
