  An anti-immigration protest called March for Australia is planned to take
  place in cities across the country on Sunday. The march has been condemned as
  hateful by the Albanese government, and is being promoted by a grab-bag of
  neo-Nazis, so-called freedom fighters – who gained prominence during the
  pandemic – and other fringe groups. What have the government and MPs said
  about the March for Australia? The government opposes the event, saying: “all
  Australians, no matter their heritage, have the right to feel safe and welcome
  in our community”. “There is no place for any type of hate in Australia.” The
  home affairs minister, Tony Burke, said: “There is no place in our country for
  people who seek to divide and undermine our social cohesion. “We stand with
  modern Australia against these rallies – nothing could be less Australian.” Dr
  Anne Aly, the minister for multicultural affairs, said multiculturalism was an
  integral and valued part of Australia’s national identity. “We stand with all
  Australians, no matter where they were born, against those who seek to divide
  us and who seek to intimidate migrant communities. We will not be intimidated.
  “This brand of far-right activism grounded in racism and ethnocentrism has no
  place in modern Australia.” Some state politicians – and Queensland federal MP
  Bob Katter – have backed the march. Some have also said they plan to attend or
  speak during the event. How will police respond? Victoria police said it would
  establish a designated area across Melbourne’s CBD in case of any violence at
  the right-wing protest on Sunday. Supt Troy Papworth, from the north-west
  metro specialist operations unit at Victoria police, told ABC Radio Melbourne
  the entire CBD and south to the Shrine of Remembrance would be declared a
  designated area under the Control of Weapons Act. This means officers could
  randomly stop and search anyone or their vehicle without requiring a warrant
  or reasonable grounds. The designated area has been declared because of fears
  some right-wing figures attending the protest near Flinders Street would
  “cause violence and mayhem”, Papworth said on Friday. “In a week where we’ve
  lost two police officers … we are having to respond to [a] protest intended to
  cause violence in the city,” he said. He said a pro-Palestinian rally was
  organised for the area around the State Library. Organisers had been
  communicating with police and said they would avoid Flinders Street, but
  Papworth said he was worried the two groups might confront each other. NSW
  police have authorised the Sydney event but the CBD will be subject to
  widespread road closures and huge crowds attending the Sydney Marathon. Police
  in other states said they were planning a large presence in response to the
  march. Queensland police urged Brisbane drivers to expect delays in the CBD.
  The Western Australian police commissioner, Col Blanch, said organisers of the
  Perth protest wanted to have a “very peaceful” demonstration. But he said the
  force expected a counter-protest. What are the organisers of the rally saying?
  No group has publicly claimed responsibility for organising the protests.
  Promotions for the protest say: “It’s time to take our country back. It’s time
  to defend our heritage. It’s time to defend our culture. STOP MASS IMMIGRATION
  NOW.” The promotional material also says not to bring foreign flags to the
  protest, just the “blue ensign, red ensign, or the eureka flag”. Does the
  Porepunkah attack change anything? It could. Supporters of the march have been
  sharing conspiracy theories about why Dezi Freeman, the suspected Porepunkah
  gunman, was visited by police the same week the protests were planned to take
  place. Police said they were there to execute a warrant in relation to alleged
  sexual offending. Many people who claim to know Freeman have expressed support
  for the march, online.
