  east coast rain dump

  Heavy rainfall across Australia’s eastern states has prompted the cancellation
  of the Byron writers’ festival and a warning for participants in Sunday’s
  City2Surf race in Sydney to take care, after parts of the east coast received
  nearly double the typical August monthly rainfall in eight days. The Byron
  festival organisers said they were “devastated” to announce the cancellation
  of the annual event due to the condition of the festival site and ongoing
  rain, and that it was a “deeply regrettable but necessary decision”. “The
  forecast conditions make it impossible to continue the event safely,” the
  artistic director, Jessica Alice, said in a statement following the festival’s
  first day. Festivalgoers said that on the one day events did go ahead, the
  ovals of the festival ground flooded, people were slipping in the mud and one
  of the marquees lost power, causing an evacuation. “Everyone had their feet up
  on chairs because there was two inches of water in the tent,” one attendee
  said. This is not the first year the writers’ festival, of which Guardian
  Australia is a partner, has been affected by rain. In 2008, one day of the
  festival was cancelled due to extreme weather and in 2022, as the northern
  rivers region experienced devastating flooding, the festival changed its
  venue. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Alice said her team did a lot of site
  work to mitigate the effects of the weather: ensuring there was adequate
  drainage, creating pathways for people to move safely around and investing in
  sturdy marquees. But she said extreme weather was now something event
  organisers needed to plan for. “It’s absolutely something we now need to
  discuss more urgently,” Alice said. “This weather that we’ve had – we’re used
  to rain in the northern rivers … but it’s very unusual for it to be this wet
  at this time of year. “We’re feeling these effects in a different way.” A
  surface trough sitting off the coast of Queensland and pushing moisture down
  the east coast led to an extensive area of cloud stretching from central
  eastern Queensland through the New South Wales coast, and rainy conditions for
  much of the east coast, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. There were
  heavy rainfall totals along the eastern seaboard after Friday night, with 75mm
  to the north of Rockhampton, more than 50mm along the coast from Yamba towards
  Lismore and up to 50mm in Sydney’s east. Some parts of the NSW coast have
  already seen their average monthly rainfall dramatically exceeded in the first
  eight days of August, including Sydney, where average August rainfall has been
  about 80mm – and which, as of 9am on Saturday, has already received 140mm of
  rain. Rainfall in Newcastle has reached 147mm. “In the seven days to 9am this
  morning, the highest rainfall for NSW is 255mm at Careys Creek [in the Hunter
  region],” senior BoM meteorologist Jonathan How said. There were hazardous
  surf warnings in place for the K’gari coast and Sunshine Coast Waters in
  Queensland, said How, and a major flood warning remained in place for the
  Namoi River at Wee Waa, Bugilbone and Goangra, though How said the rainfall
  and flooding were subsiding. “Narrabri’s levels are subsiding, but our message
  is that the rivers still [have] a lot of water flowing through them, so
  reminding people to take care,” he said. How also flagged conditions for the
  annual City2Surf race in Sydney. “It’s looking to be quite a showery sort of
  morning for participants and quite chilly with that southerly wind coming
  through as well,” he said. “So, not the best conditions for running.” – with
