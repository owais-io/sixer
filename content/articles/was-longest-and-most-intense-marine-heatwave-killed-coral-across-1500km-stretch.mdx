  The “longest, largest and most intense” marine heatwave ever recorded in
  Western Australia has killed coral throughout an area that stretches 1,500km,
  according to state and federal scientists. More than 100 scientists and marine
  managers will gather in Perth on Tuesday for a special meeting to discuss the
  devastating event that bleached and killed corals on remote reefs earlier this
  year. The marine heatwave that hit reefs from the world heritage-listed
  Ningaloo to the remote Ashmore Reef left many scientists shocked. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email A group of scientists from state and federal government
  departments, agencies and universities, who monitor coral bleaching in Western
  Australia, will issue a detailed update on Tuesday. The heatwave, which
  started to build off the north-western WA coast in August 2024, caused heat
  stress in corals across the state’s northern reefs that lasted until May this
  year in “the most severe coral bleaching on record for Western Australian
  coral reefs”, the update said. Dr James Gilmour, a senior research scientist
  at the Australian Institute of Marine Science that coordinates the monitoring
  group, said on some coral reefs that were inspected, more than 90% of corals
  had either bleached or died. “When you have more than about 75% of corals that
  have bleached or died, it can be very hard to find any healthy corals,” he
  said. The update from the WA Coral Bleaching Group said the amount of
  bleaching and coral death on reefs ranged from medium (11%- 30%) to extreme
  (greater than 90%) across systems up to 1,500km apart. The worst-hit area was
  the Rowley Shoals, Gilmour said – a group of three remote reefs that had
  previously escaped the effects of global heating and had been a “hope spot”
  for many scientists. “The first time reefs bleach badly, the mortality tends
  to be quite high,” he said. Throughout the heatwave, scientists were
  monitoring a metric over reefs known as Degree Heating Weeks – a measure of
  accumulated heat stress. Gilmour said as a general rule, 8DHWs is high enough
  to cause some corals to die. During the marine heatwave, most WA reefs from
  Ningaloo north reached at least 15 DHWs, with some reefs off the Pilbara coast
  hitting 30DHWs. “At pretty much all of these reefs, it was the highest heat
  stress ever recorded,” he said. The marine heatwave in WA coincided with the
  most widespread global bleaching event on record that started in January 2023
  and is ongoing. More than 80% of the planet’s reefs have seen heat stress high
  enough to cause corals to bleach. Previous marine heatwaves in WA have been
  associated with La Niña patterns of ocean heat in the Pacific that see warmer
  waters pulled south by a current that sweeps down the coast. This extreme
  marine heatwave in WA happened in the absence of a La Niña. “We still got this
  dramatic warming, so we are only left with climate change [as a cause] after
  that,” said Dr Alistair Hobday, a marine heatwave expert at the CSIRO. Dr
  Claire Spillman, a member of the bleaching group from the Bureau of
  Meteorology, said the summer of late 2024 and early 2025 recorded the warmest
  ocean temperatures for the Australian region on a record going back to 1900.
  “The increased frequency of extreme and record-breaking ocean temperatures is
  associated with global warming,” she said. The WA coral bleaching played out
  at the same time as significant bleaching was also hitting the Great Barrier
  Reef on the east coast. Scientists there have recorded the biggest annual
  drops in coral cover “Climate change is driving these events, which are
  becoming more frequent, more intense and more widespread, giving our amazing,
  valuable coral reefs little time to recover,” Gilmour said. “And they need 10
  to 15 years to recover fully. “The key to helping coral reefs survive under
  climate change is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”
