  France is braced for another political crisis as the minority government of
  François Bayrou appears almost certain to be toppled in a confidence vote next
  month, amid deep political divisions over an unpopular austerity budget and
  debt-reduction plan. “I will fight like a dog,” the centrist prime minister
  told L’Express on Tuesday after his surprise decision to call a vote of
  confidence from parliamentarians. Bayrou, 74, a close ally of Emmanuel Macron,
  is expected to lose the vote as opposition parties on the far right and left
  said they would relish the opportunity to eject him after less than nine
  months in office. Boris Vallaud, the head of the Socialist parliamentary
  group, told BFM TV: “We need to change politics and for that we need to change
  prime minister.” Bayrou’s gamble – which involves Macron convening a special
  session of parliament on 8 September for a confidence vote that the prime
  minister has almost no chance of winning – has sparked fears of another
  political crisis less than a year after the previous government of Michel
  Barnier was toppled over budget disagreements after only three months. The
  Paris stock market tumbled, shares in French banks sank and the country’s
  borrowing costs rose on Tuesday as investors fretted. A planned protest
  movement against Bayrou’s proposed budget cuts, which gathered support on
  social media over the summer, as well as potential strikes and demonstrations
  by trade unions are expected to begin on 10 September, regardless of whether
  Bayrou is forced to quit. The beleaguered politician attended a meeting of the
  CFDT trade union on Tuesday where he urged French political parties to think
  carefully about the vote, noting they had 13 days to “say whether they are on
  the side of chaos or responsibility”. Bayrou said: “Is there or is there not a
  national emergency to rebalance the accounts, to escape excessive debt by
  choosing to reduce our deficits and produce more? That is the central
  question.” In what was seen as a last-minute appeal to the left, he said he
  was prepared to demand a “specific effort” from high-wealth individuals, after
  his budget proposals were widely criticised for affecting poor people and
  pensioners while having less impact on the very wealthy. If Bayrou is ousted,
  Macron would be dragged into domestic upheaval at a significant international
  moment for him, as he positions himself to play a role on Ukraine and the
  recognition of a Palestinian state. Under the French political system, the
  president, who is head of state and has authority on foreign policy and
  national security, directly appoints a prime minister as head of government to
  run domestic affairs. Macron could swiftly appoint a new prime minister but
  they too could risk being ousted over the budget. A source close to the
  far-right leader Marine Le Pen told Reuters it was hard to see how any new
  prime minister could escape being hit by a vote of no confidence. Le Pen’s
  party instead wants Macron to dissolve parliament and call a snap election.
  Macron said this summer he did not want to do this, but the justice minister,
  Gérald Darmanin, said on Tuesday that an election could not be ruled out.
  Since Macron called an inconclusive snap election last June, the French
  parliament has been divided between three groups with no absolute majority. A
  left alliance took the largest number of votes but fell short of an absolute
  majority; Macron’s centrist grouping took losses but is still present; and the
  far-right National Rally gained seats but was held back from power by tactical
  voting from the left and centre. The Green leader, Marine Tondelier, said
  Macron must now appoint a prime minister from the left. The interior minister,
  Bruno Retailleau, who leads the rightwing Les Républicains party that has
  propped up Bayrou, said it would be irresponsible and “against France’s
  interests” to vote for the government to fall. At the heart of the crisis is
  Bayrou’s unpopular and vague plan for a €44bn (£38bn) budget squeeze and
  austerity programme to reduce France’s public debt. This includes scrapping
  two public holidays and freezing welfare spending and tax brackets. Hospital
  staff are concerned about deep cuts to the public health service. Polls show
  voters on all political sides see the budget as unfair and letting the
  wealthiest off the hook. This summer, Bayrou became the least popular French
  prime minister since the start of the Fifth Republic in 1958, with one poll
  showing 80% of French people did not trust him.
