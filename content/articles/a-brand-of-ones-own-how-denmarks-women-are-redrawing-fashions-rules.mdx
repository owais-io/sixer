  Football fans will be familiar with the manager musical chairs, but fashion
  has been strangely similar over the last year. Since mid-2024 there have been
  17 new designers appointed to head up houses including Gucci and Dior. But, in
  an industry fuelled by womenswear, just four of these appointments have been
  women. And there are other depressing statistics. Of the top 30 luxury brands
  in the Vogue Business Index, a mere five creative directors are women. At
  Kering, the luxury conglomerate that owns Balenciaga and Valentino, there is
  just one: Louise Trotter at Bottega Veneta. At LVMH, the fashion behemoth that
  counts Loewe and Dior among its brands, again, just one label is helmed by a
  woman – Sarah Burton at Givenchy. There’s more. In February, research by
  1Granary found that 74% of students at top fashion programmes are female, yet
  88% of fashion’s top designer roles are held by men. The last time a woman won
  designer of the year at the Fashion awards was in 2012. And it’s not just
  designers. The majority of those in positions of power at brands, such as CEOs
  and executives, are also male. There is an anomaly, though. This week, the
  19th iteration of Copenhagen fashion week (CPHFW), known in the industry as
  the fifth fashion week, is being held in the Danish capital. Of the 42 brands
  participating, 26 are founded and led by females. Stine Goya – who now sells
  her eponymous label in over 30 countries, with the US being its second-biggest
  market outside Denmark – describes men’s continual domination of the fashion
  industry as “outdated”. Denmark’s structural approach to equality, she says,
  has become a key instigator of change, with policies aimed at improving wage
  equality and schemes to encourage women to return to work after having
  children. “Copenhagen has become an ecosystem for independent female-led
  brands,” she told me. “There is a spirit of collaboration here, and a
  willingness to do things differently. It has allowed women to take up space
  and build businesses on their own terms.” Stephanie Gundelach co-founded
  OpéraSport, a brand that specialises in creating contemporary wardrobe staples
  from upcycled materials, with Awa Malina Stelter in 2019. Gundelach says much
  of their motivation comes from the desire to overcome this type of gender
  inequality. “There is an unspoken bias in the fashion industry where often
  women have to work twice as hard to be seen as equally visionary. In
  Copenhagen, there is a shift happening. Women are building their own platforms
  rather than waiting for a seat at someone else’s table.” Fashion’s idea of
  what a woman should look like impacts everything, from the models who appear
  on the catwalks to the design of the clothes. In 2024, for instance, 1.4% of
  models on the catwalks at CPHFW were plus-size while in New York, London,
  Milan and Paris just 0.8% of models were plus-size. Cecilie Bahnsen, who
  popularised the idea of wearing intricate and romantic dresses with practical
  trainers, says that as a woman designing for other women her ethos is based
  around comfort. “There is an ease to my pieces. They don’t outshine you.” “A
  lot of women want to wear something different to what male designers suggest
  they should wear,” says Anne Sofie Madsen, who this week relaunched her
  namesake brand with a new co-creative director, the stylist Caroline Clante.
  “We look at clothing with a female gaze. Our customers are not only dressing
  to be desired or admired, but also to be themselves.” This season’s collection
  included a pair of “evening jeans”, as well as meme-able “rat bags”. While the
  creative jobs at the top of the fashion industry have become synonymous with
  burnout, Danish designers take a more holistic approach to work-life balance,
  in line with Danish work culture generally. Madsen, who prior to launching her
  own label in 2011 worked alongside designers including Alexander McQueen and
  John Galliano, credits fashion’s traditional gauntlet of endless travelling,
  long hours and expectations to produce more than six collections a year as a
  catalyst for her hitting pause on her brand in 2017. “I realised that I was
  living a life that I didn’t want to live,” she says. “I wanted to figure out a
  different way to be in fashion.” Now, Madsen and Clante are determined to
  build their brand to work around their lives, rather than making the brand
  their whole existence. Madsen is continuing to teach at the Scandinavian
  Academy of Fashion Design and Clante works as a freelance stylist. Bahnsen,
  who started showing in Paris in 2022, has kept her atelier based in
  Copenhagen, describing it as “her bubble”. She allows her team of 26 women and
  four men to work flexible hours and discourages working at weekends. Gundelach
  and Stelter will often finish work at 3pm in order to spend time with their
  families, and Bahnsen’s five-year-old son is a regular sight in her atelier.
  Livia Schück, co-founder of Rave Review – who this season showed delicate
  boho-inspired dresses and skirts made from deadstock – took her post-show bow
  while holding her five-month-old daughter. “We don’t have a culture where you
  need to stay until five or six because that’s not workable when you have small
  kids,” says Stelter. “Our workers know what we expect of them, but they have
  the freedom to work flexibly. As long as the work is getting done we are
  happy.” Many Danes talk about the “law of Jante”, a sort of Scandinavian
  social code based on the idea that no one is better than anyone else.
  Gundelach describes how it feeds into “a collaborative rather than competitive
  energy” and says that “there is a strong community of female creatives lifting
  each other up, which I feel is quite rare”. Goya credits “a sense of openness”
  and an “ambitious creative scene” as a driving force for independent female
  designers. “It’s not been about having an ego. It is about building a team, a
  brand and a community.” As Isabella Rose Davey, chief operating officer of
  CPHFW, points out, the women paving a new path in the industry hope that
  others will follow their lead. “It is modern, forward thinking like this that
  we need to see more of outside Denmark to ensure that women are not locked out
  of senior positions.” To read the complete version of this newsletter –
