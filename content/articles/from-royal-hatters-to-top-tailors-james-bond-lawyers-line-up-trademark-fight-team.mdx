  King Charles’s personal shirtmaker. The world’s oldest hatters, who designed
  fitments for Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation crown and boast fans including
  Winston Churchill. A luxury sports brand with a “spy-ready” ski-suit. Has
  James Bond assembled a crack team that can successfully take on his latest
  adversary? Lawyers representing Danjaq, the US company that controls the
  rights to worldwide James Bond merchandising in conjunction with the UK
  company Eon Productions, have filed evidence running to 227 pages as it
  battles to retain control of the superspy’s name across Europe. In February,
  the Guardian revealed that a Dubai-based property developer had filed claims
  in the UK and EU arguing that lack of use meant various protections had lapsed
  around James Bond’s intellectual property, including his name, his 007
  assignation and the catchphrase “Bond, James Bond”. Nearly all nine of the
  trademarks being challenged relate to the merchandising of goods and services
  under the Bond name, which can be challenged after five years of “non-use”.
  Josef Kleindienst, an Austrian who is building a $5bn (£3.7bn) luxury resort
  complex called the Heart of Europe on six artificial islands off Dubai, has
  argued that the trademarks have been commercially underexploited. Boehmert
  &amp; Boehmert, one of the largest intellectual property (IP) law firms in
  Europe, representing Danjaq, has hit back, filing evidence to the European
  trademark office from a who’s who of high-end partners still using the Bond
  name. The filing starts with the 140-year-old Jermyn Street tailor, Turnbull
  &amp; Asser, which describes itself as the “definitive British shirtmaker” and
  created shirts for Sean Connery in the first Bond film, 1962’s Dr No,
  continuing to do so since for Bond actors including Pierce Brosnan and Daniel
  Craig. The firm is the personal shirtmaker to the king, who bestowed the
  company with his first royal warrant when, as the Prince of Wales, he was
  given the power to do so in 1980. Turnbull &amp; Asser created the shirt
  Charles wore on his coronation day in 2023, and a year later he renewed its
  royal warrant. The evidence file also features Lock &amp; Co, the world’s
  oldest hatters with roots dating to 1676, whose heritage includes being
  responsible for fitting out first world war soldiers in their now familiar
  “Mark 1” tin helmets before being deployed overseas. The company, based in
  London’s St James’s Street, started its Bond relationship with one of its hats
  appearing in the now famous opening credit gun barrel scene in 1960’s Dr No.
  Lock &amp; Co was also behind henchman Odd Job’s famous lethal Coker, or
  bowler hat, in 1964’s Goldfinger. Bond fans can pay £537 for the James felt
  trilby, Dr No edition while women might take to the £662 Vesper, originally
  created for Eva Green to wear as Vesper Lynd in 2006’s Casino Royale. “In
  cases such as this the brand owner should respond by providing a robust
  package of evidence, assuming they are able to do so,” said Mark Caddle,
  partner and trademark lawyer at the European IP firm Withers &amp; Rogers.
  “Commercial use is often shown by sales figures and a selection of invoices to
  support them, as well as by evidence of marketing and communications activity,
  such as brochures, online advertising, physical advertising and social media
  posts.” Commercial information has also been provided for the luxury sports
  lifestyle brand Bogner. Willy Bogner Jr, who took over running the company
  founded by his father in 1932, has been credited for creating the world’s
  first action skiing scenes for 1969’s On Her Majesty’s Secret Service. He went
  on to create alpine scenes for Bond productions including The Spy Who Loved
  Me, For Your Eyes Only and A View to a Kill. Last year, the company launched
  its “spy-ready” ski range – the Bogner X 007 collection – with products priced
  from $290 to $2,300 (about £205 to £1,700). There is also product and
  commercial information from luxury cashmere and accessories brand N.Peal,
  founded in 1936 with a flagship store in London’s Burlington arcade, which
  stocks a modern take on Bond, including a pair of £245 No Time to Die combat
  trousers. Boehmert &amp; Boehmert has called the trademark action an
  “unprecedented assault” on the multibillion-pound global franchise. “We will
  file evidence of use for each trademark,” said Rudolf Böckenholt, at Boehmert
  &amp; Boehmert, in a defence filing. “Considering the number of goods/services
  at issue for each trademark, this will be a submission considerable in length
  and size, including numerous attachments and exhibits.” Kleindienst has
  extended his attempt to try to take control of the spy’s various brands by
  also submitting his own trademark for James Bond in Europe. He has not,
  however, done the same in the UK. The developer has said that he has launched
  the trademark action because he is concerned about the commercial future of
  the spy franchise, arguing that Bond “will not die” on his watch. Daniel
  Craig’s last outing as 007, in No Time to Die, was released in 2021. With no
  announcement yet of his replacement or timeline for production of the next
  film, the franchise is on track to beat the previous longest gap between
  instalments of six years and four months. Danjaq also co-owns the copyright to
  the existing Bond films, along with MGM Studios, which was acquired by Amazon
  for $8.5bn in 2021. Days after the report of Kleindienst’s legal challenges,
  it emerged that Amazon had paid more than $1bn to gain full “creative control”
  of the franchise from Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson, the longtime
  stewards of the Bond films. With creative control, Amazon now has the power to
  move forward with new films and potentially TV spin-offs, without approval
  from the two British-American heirs to the film producer Albert “Cubby”
  Broccoli, who had overseen the integrity of the character originally created
  in 1953 by the author Ian Fleming. Denis Villeneuve, the man behind the Dune
  franchise, is directing the next Bond film. And Steven Knight, who is the
  co-creator of the gameshow Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? and penned Peaky
  Blinders, has reportedly been brought on board to write the next 007 outing.
  In March, Amazon confirmed that Amy Pascal and David Heyman would produce the
  film, although no release date or lead actor has yet been named. Pascal has
  experience with the Bond series in her previous position as Sony’s chair of
  film, overseeing Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace and Skyfall. She also had
  producer credits on the latest Spider-Man series. Heyman is best known as the
  producer of the Harry Potter films as well as the Fantastic Beasts franchise
  and is now in pre-production on the HBO TV series adaptation of the stories.
  He is the second most commercially successful film producer of all time, with
  credits including Gravity, Paddington, Barbie, Wonka and Once Upon a Time … in
  Hollywood. “We have the utmost respect for the legacy of James Bond,” said
  Kleindienst in response to the latest developments in the trademark case. “Yet
  we must acknowledge a simple truth: there are clear trademark and copyright
  laws, which exist to prevent prolonged inactivity and ensure that cultural
  properties continue to serve the audiences that value them. Our goal is
  straightforward – to respect the legacy while ensuring that Bond remains
  relevant and accessible to all fans.” • This article was amended on 17 August
  2025 to correct the spelling both of the brand Bogner and of Willy Bogner Jr.
