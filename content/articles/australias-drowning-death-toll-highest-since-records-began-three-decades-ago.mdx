  Australians’ swimming skills are at crisis levels, lifesaving organisations
  warn, as a new report shows 357 people drowned last financial year, the
  highest drowning death toll since records began in 1996. The annual drowning
  report released by Royal Life Saving Australia and Surf Life Saving Australia
  on Tuesday recorded 357 deaths between 1 July 2024 and 30 June 2025 – 34 more
  than the previous year’s total of 323, and a 27% increase on the 10-year
  average. One-third of those who drowned were over the age of 65, and drowning
  deaths among those aged 75 or older had increased by 63% on the 10-year
  average, the report shows. Royal Life Saving Australia’s chief executive,
  Justin Scarr, said these increases were at least partly a consequence of the
  population ageing and not recognising or acknowledging how age and some health
  conditions or medications may affect their swimming skills. “Older people, men
  particularly, overestimate their ability,” said Scarr. “They fail to recognise
  that their skills are in decline, and they can often be completely unaware
  that the medication that they’re taking can cause loss of consciousness or
  other symptoms that make it very difficult for them to swim in the light of
  safety.” Sign up: AU Breaking News email The report expressed concern that
  Australians’ swimming skills may be at their lowest since the widespread
  adoption of school-based swimming programs in the 1970s. Coastal drownings,
  accounting for 43% of the national total, remained a particular concern for
  Surf Life Saving Australia, said its chief executive, Adam Weir. “Rip currents
  remain Australia’s number one coastal hazard, responsible for more than one in
  three beach drowning deaths – claiming more lives than sharks, floods or
  cyclones combined … More is being asked of surf lifesavers and lifeguards, as
  beach usage continues to grow and people explore a wider range of coastal
  locations.” New South Wales had the highest number of drowning deaths at 129,
  followed by Queensland at 90. But the rate of drowning was highest in Western
  Australia, at 1.65 drownings per 100,000 people and 49 deaths; and lowest in
  Victoria, at 0.75 per 100,000 people or 52 deaths. Of people whose country of
  birth was known (53%), 32% were born overseas. Deaths of children under the
  age of five remained low against the 10-year average, which Scarr attributed
  to decades of work, including pool fencing legislation and awareness raising.
  Deaths of children aged five to 14 accounted for 3% of all drownings, but the
  deaths of 15-to24-year-olds was four times that, at 12%. “Parents sign up
  [their kids to swimming lessons] at six months of age and they hang in there
  for as long as they can. But the research shows that children are leaving
  lessons between the ages of six and seven, and they almost never return,”
  Scarr said. The cost burden and patchy access to lessons and safe swimming
  places, among other factors, meant around half of children were leaving
  primary school unable to swim. If they left high school without those skills
  then they were at significant lifelong risk of drowning, Scarr said. “Swimming
  education has fundamentally got to be wet. We can’t paste over that problem by
  replacing all swimming education with a brochure or an online program.” Those
  in disadvantaged areas drowned at higher rates per population than in more
  advantaged areas, with children aged under 14 particularly vulnerable. “We
  need kids in pools, and we need kids learning how to swim and swim long
  distances and life-saving strokes. And we’ve got to make it fun and enjoyable
  … to prepare older children for exposure to water well away from their
  parents, and likely in unpatrolled, unlifeguarded areas,” Scarr said.
