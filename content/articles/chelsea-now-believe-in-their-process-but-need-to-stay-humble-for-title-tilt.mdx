  Off we go again. Just over a month has passed since Chelsea stunned Paris
  Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup final, Cole Palmer leading the destruction
  of the European champions. But there is no chance of life at Stamford Bridge
  slowing down. It has been another breathless summer and, while the vibe is as
  positive as it has ever been under the ownership of Clearlake Capital and Todd
  Boehly, there is also the unavoidable question of whether a relentless
  schedule is going to catch up with the new world champions further down the
  line. A compressed pre-season, limited to friendlies against Bayer Leverkusen
  and Milan last weekend, may pose complications for Enzo Maresca in the long
  run. Chelsea had a lucrative time in the US, earning an estimated £85m in
  prize money, but the riches on offer from Fifa’s expanded tournament come with
  potential costs. The unknown is how last season, stretching until 13 July,
  will affect Maresca’s players. They looked ready to go during convincing wins
  in the pair of friendlies, which suggests there will be no lethargy when they
  open their Premier League campaign with a testing home game against Crystal
  Palace on Sunday, but one theory is problems will come when the Champions
  League begins, the fixtures pile up and Christmas approaches There has already
  been one setback, the loss of Levi Colwill to an anterior cruciate ligament
  injury leaving a sizeable hole at the back. Chelsea do not intend to panic and
  sign a defender for the sake of it, despite Maresca saying on Friday he wanted
  a replacement for Colwill. Chelsea’s position is that they have depth and they
  will move only if someone suitable is available. Maresca feels his squad does
  not have anyone as proficient as Colwill at making his tactics work. “We know
  how important he has been,” he said last week. “I spoke with Levi and told him
  that if we achieved what we achieved last year it is also because of him.” It
  speaks volumes that Colwill was the one constant presence in central defence.
  His defending improved during the run-in, he has developed as a leader and his
  ability on the ball makes him crucial to the buildup. Chelsea feel they have
  internal solutions. Trevoh Chalobah, back in favour after being loaned to
  Palace at the start of last season, was outstanding against PSG. Wesley
  Fofana, who was first choice next to Colwill before breaking down last
  December, will be vital if he can stay fit. Other options include Benoît
  Badiashile and Tosin Adarabioyo, often seen acting as Palmer’s chaperone, and
  the young prospects Josh Acheampong and Aarón Anselmino. There is also a
  potential solution in Jorrel Hato, even if the new arrival from Ajax has been
  signed initially to compete with Marc Cucurella at left-back. It is hardly a
  crisis. The squad is deep and it is not a case of quantity over quality this
  time. There have been a lot of sales again – the intention is for Chelsea’s
  spending to be at net zero when the window shuts – but the business is better
  than last year. The attack has been upgraded with the signings of João Pedro
  and Liam Delap. Dário Essugo and Andrey Santos provide promising cover for
  Enzo Fernández and Moisés Caicedo in midfield. Jamie Gittens has replaced
  Jadon Sancho on the left and Estêvão Willian, a prodigious Brazilian talent
  who shone for Palmeiras during the Club World Cup, offered exciting glimpses
  against Leverkusen and Milan. Then there is the ice-cold Palmer, who took the
  first steps towards superstardom with his brilliant double against PSG. He is
  the team’s undoubted star, the key difference-maker, although it is important
  Chelsea are not reliant on one individual. Insiders stress this is a team
  effort. There is consistent praise for the youth-driven strategy implemented
  by the recruitment team of Paul Winstanley, Laurence Stewart, Sam Jewell and
  Joe Shields. The quartet have faced external criticism but were handed
  contract extensions this week. It is hard for anyone to argue that Chelsea,
  who also won the Conference League last season, are not on the right track
  after seeing how Maresca outdid Luis Enrique’s PSG. Two years after they
  finished 12th, a proper title challenge does not feel unrealistic. Chelsea
  have firepower and tactical flexibility, and they have belief after beating
  PSG. Inside the club, though, there is caution. Maresca is not facing demands
  from the board to win the title. The victory over PSG has been followed by
  reminders of the need for everyone to stay humble. There is a wariness about
  anyone involved in the project getting carried away. Chelsea are a young team
  and came close to missing out on Champions League qualification last season.
  Dips are to be expected and Robert Sánchez’s recent improvement has not fully
  allayed doubts over whether he is a title-winning goalkeeper. Maresca, too,
  was under pressure after Christmas. Chelsea, though, crave stability. They
  want mid-season managerial changes to be a thing of the past. They are not
  going to overreact if fatigue hits after Champions League games or during the
  festive period. Chelsea believe in their process. The trading can look
  ruthless but the model of handing out heavily incentivised deals has made it
  easier to move unwanted players. Noni Madueke has gone to Arsenal for an
  initial £48m. There were no issues shipping João Félix to Saudi Arabia. A
  bigger challenge is finding buyers for Raheem Sterling and Christopher Nkunku,
  both of whom were signed on big wages before Chelsea shifted their contract
  policy. Further incomings depend on more sales, with Ben Chilwell and Carney
  Chukwuemeka also hoping for fresh starts. Chelsea want to strengthen in the
  final third by signing Manchester United’s Alejandro Garnacho and RB Leipzig’s
  Xavi Simons but being fined by Uefa for breaching financial fair play rules
  heightens the need to raise money, which will most likely come through selling
  Nkunku, Nicolas Jackson and Tyrique George. It will be busy before the window
  shuts. It is never quiet at Chelsea. Maresca tried to play down their chances
  last season, saying they were not ready to challenge Liverpool and Arsenal,
  but silencing the title talk will be impossible if they hit the ground running
  this time.
