  Tis the season to be beside the seaside – and to hype and critique coastal
  towns in surveys and rankings. I suppose lists of this year’s “in” and “out”
  resorts help tourists decide where to go; no point going to Skegness for
  Michelin-starred food, or to Salcombe for a laugh and cheap beer. Less obvious
  coastal towns provide more nuanced fare. Perhaps the most alluring spots are
  those where we don’t forget the sea. These three towns are routinely ranked
  last resorts or else ignored altogether, but they offer more than stuff to
  eat, drink, buy and post on socials – and are close to swimmable beaches. Ayr,
  Ayrshire A century ago, Clyde steamers and the Glasgow and South Western
  Railway took thousands of sunseekers from inland towns to the Ayrshire coast.
  They came to escape the smoke and noise of industry, breathe in the briny air,
  and admire the Isle of Arran and tiny Ailsa Craig – from afar or up close on
  an excursion. The bed and breakfasts on elegant Park Circus (a sweeping
  crescent lined with cherry trees that blossom red on one side and white on the
  other) and the Georgian villas on Eglinton Terrace evoke something of the
  golden days of yore. It’s easy to imagine parasol-sporting ladies and
  tall-hatted gents strolling across the Low Green, a large field between the
  town centre and the beach. This open space – perfect for picnics, kite-flying
  and impromptu games – and the absence of any clutter on the prom make the
  seafront unusually peaceful. It’s as if Ayr has refused to become a
  traditional resort. No tat, no tack, not many tourists. There are places to
  play on swings and get an ice-cream or a pint, but lovers of amusement arcades
  and bucket-and-spade shops should probably stay away. On the short block
  beside the Low Green the buildings are mainly residential – including care
  homes, that standard fixture of coastal towns. The beach is a golden sweep
  about two miles in length, with the old harbour at the north end. Wharves and
  quays once bustled all along the River Ayr. By the 14th century, this was
  Scotland’s principal west coast port. In the 18th century, more than 300 ships
  were moored every year, unloading American tobacco, French wine, Spanish salt,
  English earthenware and slate from Easdale in the Firth of Lorn. Walk south
  and you come to the ruins of Greenan Castle, a 16th-century clifftop tower.
  The sunsets over Arran are life-enhancing. I watched a woman of retirement age
  do her tai chi moves while keeping her eyes fixed on the island – spiritually
  separate from the dog-walkers and prom-striders. Robert Burns was born near
  Ayr and baptised in the Auld Kirk. In Tam o’ Shanter he writes: “Auld Ayr,
  wham ne’er a town surpasses, / For honest men and bonny lasses”. A lively pub
  on the high street, which is set back a good mile from the beach, is named
  after the poem; it claims to be the oldest in Ayr, but so does the Black Bull
  on the opposite side of the river. The old bridge (or Auld Brig, if you
  prefer, which inspired another Burns poem) that takes you across is
  pedestrianised and a beauty. All the old pubs are enticing but I had my most
  enjoyable, peaceful beer and dram in the Twa Dugs – also named for a Burns
  poem. In Ayr’s Waterstones, I found a long-overlooked 1969 Booker-nominated
  novel by Gordon M Williams, From Scenes Like These, that provided a brutally
  realistic riposte to Burns-esque takes on rural Scotland. I read it in the
  boozers, the caffs, on benches. People in Ayr will tell you the town has
  declined. They’ll tell you that in nine out of 10 seaside resorts. But this
  column gets me around, and I can vouch for the town’s general busyness and
  good looks. Sedate, somewhat stern, bereft of traditional fun stuff, it’s an
  ideal hideaway for those who want to do beach walks, read or write, and check
  into small, friendly guest houses. Things to see and do: Rozelle House Museum,
  Robert Burns Birthplace Museum, Culzean Castle and Country Park Bangor,
  Gwynedd Bangor, the oldest city in Wales, came second from bottom in the
  Which? 2025 rankings and absolute bottom in 2024. Perhaps the latter partly
  anticipated the former. Casually saddle a place with derision and it takes a
  great effort to shake it off. As the gateway to the island of Ynys Môn
  (Anglesey), a university town and former royal capital, Bangor doesn’t need
  star ratings or hip amenities. The city’s origins stretch back to the founding
  of a monastery in the early sixth century. A cathedral was later built on the
  site. For centuries, Bangor was the spiritual and ecclesiastical hub for
  Gwynedd – a kingdom until the English came a-conquering – but remained a small
  settlement. Nonetheless, during the first flush of Welsh tourism, at the turn
  of the 18th and 19th centuries, pleasure steamers from Liverpool brought
  visitors to see the big church and the wild waters of the Menai Strait. The
  boom years came after 1826 with the completion of the Holyhead Road, linking
  London with Dublin – hitched to the recently created UK by the 1800 Acts of
  Union. The first major civilian state-funded road building project in Britain
  since the Roman era, the job was given to Thomas Telford. The road (much of it
  on the same route as today’s A5) swept through central Bangor, making the
  former big village a major staging post, and creating the longest high street
  in Wales. To replace the ferry-shuttles, Telford’s magnificent Menai
  Suspension Bridge opened in 1826. Two decades later, Robert Stephenson built a
  tubular bridge to carry the Chester-Holyhead railway across the straits. With
  communications much improved, Bangor became a proper little port, with
  shipbuilding, sail making, iron founding, smithing and timber yards, as well
  as slate yards. Walk to the natural end of this high street – which turns
  residential – and you come to the shore, a pier and a large park between
  neo-Norman Penrhyn Castle and the sea. You don’t have an in-town beach, which
  might be why some of the raters have a low opinion of Bangor. But the Wales
  Coast Path and the railway line link Bangor with beaches at Llanfairfechan and
  Penmaenmawr, eight and 10 miles away respectively. In fact, this might be the
  best-connected seaside town in the UK, with Eryri national park (Snowdonia),
  Unesco-listed Caernarfon Castle and Criccieth and the Llŷn peninsula
  accessible by bus, and of course Anglesey on the doorstep. Things to see and
  do: walk the Menai Suspension Bridge, kayaking off Caernarfon, Aber Falls
  Distillery Millom, Cumbria The Cumbrian coast is the most intriguing stretch
  of littoral in these islands. Backed by the towering, cloud-drawing fells of
  the national park, the shore is often beneath a blue dome. The towns along it
  are chapters in British social history. Whitehaven is like a Devon port town
  without the crowds. Workington is a fascinating ex-industrial town. Nethertown
  is a hidden hamlet in a spectacular setting. Millom, at the southern tip of
  the old county of Cumberland, is a stop on the coast-hugging railway line – a
  superlative train ride – between Barrow-in-Furness and Sellafield. Its main
  connection to the nexuses of nuclear war and power are the Millomites who
  commute south and north for work. Millom once had industry; hematite ore (iron
  oxide) was found at Hodbarrow in 1856 and mined till 1968, the population
  swelling to 10,000. Much of the land was transformed into an RSPB nature
  reserve, centred on the north-west’s largest coastal lagoon; little, common
  and sandwich terns breed on the islands and you can see ringed plovers,
  redshanks, great crested grebes and oystercatchers around the wetlands. Millom
  is tiny, but has none of the jams and crowds of the villages in the nearby
  Lakes. The Camra-rated Bear on the Square has real ales, good food and live
  music. The town has its own fell – Black Combe – and while only a 600-metre
  Marilyn, its isolation and proximity to the sea make it feel higher. The views
  from the summit are magnificent – with Blackpool Tower and Scafell Pike
  visible in clear weather. The poet Norman Nicholson (1914-1987) was born in
  Millom and spent almost all his life here, shunning metropolitan literary
  circles and asserting that the much-maligned “provincial” has more in common
  with people of other times and lands and consequently “may be all the more
  aware of that which is enduring in life and society”. The titles of his books
  reflect the locale: Rock Face (1948); The Shadow of Black Combe (1978); Sea to
  the West (1981). St George’s church has a stained-glass window designed by
  Christine Boyce that was inspired by Nicholson’s writing. His house is being
  restored, while Millom as a whole is undergoing a major rebuild with heritage
  and health projects afoot as well as a 7.5-mile walking and cycling trail. For
  a swim, head to Silecroft by train (one stop) or on foot (3.5 miles); Haverigg
  beach, though closer, often has pollution warnings. Things to see and do:
