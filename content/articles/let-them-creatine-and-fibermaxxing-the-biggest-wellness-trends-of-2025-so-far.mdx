  Staying up to date on wellness trends can be tough. What if you get sat next
  to an energy healer at a dinner party? What are you going to talk about? Raw
  milk is already sort of passé. Don’t worry, we’ve got you covered. Here are
  the wellness trends everyone is discussing in 2025, and what you need to know
  about them. Dopamine menu Down in the dumps? Try putting together a “dopamine
  menu” – a list of activities designed to boost your mood. The term first
  popped up in 2020, and has since taken off on social media, with thousands of
  users sharing what they “order” when they feel low. It’s helpful to think of a
  dopamine menu like a regular menu, Adrienne Matei explained, with “starters”
  that take little time and effort, more substantial “mains”, and “sides” that
  zest up the day. Matei spoke to several happiness experts about the items on
  their dopamine menus. These included giving people compliments, sitting in
  your favorite green space, cuddling with a loved one, and smashing objects to
  bits in a rage room. Whatever works for you! More about dopamine menus ***
  ‘Let them’ This year, millions of people realized they can’t control the
  actions of others – no matter how desperately they might want to. At the end
  of 2024, podcaster and self-help guru Mel Robbins published a book called The
  Let Them Theory. Its central thesis was simple: if someone is doing something
  that bothers you, let them. The book made a splash. It jumped to the top of
  bestseller lists. There were news articles and podcast episodes about the
  theory, and Oprah called it a “gamechanger”. People even got “Let them”
  tattoos. The theory was not without critics. Some claimed Robbins cribbed the
  idea from poet Cassie B Phillips, whose poem, Let Them, went viral in 2022.
  Others said the concept was obvious. But sometimes obvious advice is the most
  helpful. As one therapist said: “It’s a reminder that it’s OK to step back,
  let people be who they are, and stop carrying things that aren’t ours to
  carry.” More about the ‘let them’ theory *** Creatine Strength training has
  been the darling of the fitness world recently (deservedly so), and as more
  people spend time moving heavy weights, there is an increasing demand for
  products and supplements that help maximize each lift. Enter creatine. Long a
  favorite supplement among athletes and fitness professionals, creatine is a
  naturally occurring compound that helps power short bursts of high-impact
  activities – think sprints or heavy lifts. Synthetic creatine is often sold as
  a white, flavorless powder that one can mix with water or juice (some
  influencers take it dry as a stunt, but experts strongly discourage this as it
  could lead to choking). Creatine is considered safe for most healthy adults.
  And while research doesn’t fully support popular social media claims that
  creatine helps build muscle, it might do so indirectly by giving you more
  energy during intense workouts. More about creatine *** Deep plane facelifts
  In May, Kardashian matriarch Kris Jenner set the internet abuzz when she
  appeared at Lauren Sanchez’s Paris bachelorette party with a face that looked
  remarkably smooth and taut. (Is that the most cursed sentence I’ve ever typed?
  Who’s to say.) Online, many speculated that her youthful appearance was the
  result of a deep plane facelift – a technique that works with deeper layers of
  tissue than a traditional facelift. Searches for the term soared. (Jenner did
  not discuss or confirm any particular procedures.) A deep plane facelift is
  pricey, because it is a more complex procedure, and also tends to last a few
  more years. It can set a patient back anywhere from $30,000 to $100,000. By
  contrast, the average cost of a regular facelift in the US is about $11,395.
  More about deep plane facelifts *** Psyllium husk Psyllium husk has been
  touted by influencers as “nature’s Ozempic” – a cheap, non-prescription
  alternative to GLP-1 medications. But this comparison is “oversimplified and
  misleading”, warns Lena Beal, spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and
  Dietetics. Psyllium husk comes from the seed of a desert shrub, and is the
  leading ingredient in popular laxatives like Metamucil. When consumed with
  water, it’s simply a good source of soluble fiber, and has been found to help
  lower levels of “bad” cholesterol, slow down digestion and increase satiety.
  If psyllium husk isn’t your thing (some people don’t enjoy the gloopy,
  gel-like texture it develops in water) don’t fear. There are plenty of other
  good sources of fiber, like fruits, vegetables and legumes. More about
  psyllium husk *** Fibermaxxing As protein mania reaches a fever pitch,
  consumers are already looking toward the next nutrition trend. According to
  some on social media, the future is all about “fibermaxxing” – a trendy term
  for “eating a lot of fiber”. As one wellness influencer put it, fiber is
  “super cool”. Indeed, one study found a fiber-rich diet can improve heart
  health and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer. You could
  give psyllium husk a try – or just eat an apple. More about fibermaxxing
