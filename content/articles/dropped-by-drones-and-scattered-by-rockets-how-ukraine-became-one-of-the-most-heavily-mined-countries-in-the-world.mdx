  In north-east Ukraine, less than 50km from the Russian border, lies the city
  of Shostka. In the first months of the full-scale invasion it was blockaded,
  and ever since has faced constant shelling and drone strikes from the Russian
  army. But if and when the attacks stop, there will be an invisible danger that
  will linger for much longer: unexploded devices. Ukraine is now one of the
  most heavily mined countries in the world, with about a quarter of its
  territory – an area larger than England – contaminated with explosives. Even
  before Russia began increasing the scale of its bombardments this summer,
  Shostka and the wider Sumy region had been accumulating large numbers of
  unexploded mines and other ordnance. In Sumy that means roads villagers once
  trusted can no longer be used, parks and forests have become fraught with
  danger, and fields that once fed communities must be abandoned. “A few days
  ago, there were 40 Shahed drones over us. They can drop mines now, so even if
  nothing explodes right away, there’s always a chance something will go off
  later,” says Shostka resident and explosives specialist Yelyzaveta Kyseliova,
  21. “People usually call the Ukrainian military when they see something
  suspicious, but mines are everywhere now, dropped from drones, scattered by
  rockets. Two weeks ago, a family was killed on a road they’d driven for years.
  It wasn’t a hidden track. That mine was put there recently, probably by a
  drone,” she says. Local activists say incidents involving mines happen so
  frequently that some residents don’t even bother reporting them. In the south
  of Ukraine, in another heavily bombed frontline city, Kherson, Liudmyla
  Kryvorotko lives with the loss of two of her children to unexploded ordnance.
  In the winter of 2022, Kryvorotko and her four children left their town,
  recently liberated but still under Russian fire, to seek refuge with
  relatives. What they didn’t know was that on their way out, the retreating
  Russian army had used mines and explosives to turn the civilian roads into
  death traps. Kryvorotko’s car detonated one such landmine. “Two of my children
  – my 19-year-old son and my 22-year-old daughter – died on the spot. I lost
  consciousness and my youngest daughter was severely injured. My 14-year-old
  son, Mykhailo, sustained a concussion, but he dragged us out of the vehicle,”
  she says. They managed to walk to the nearest village before being rescued by
  Ukrainian soldiers. Kryvorotko had a punctured lung and broken ribs, and her
  youngest daughter was lucky to survive, with injuries to her face and chest.
  Two years on, she says, their bodies are still covered in scars. “We have
  nowhere to go that is safe, every place has been infected with the war.”
  Traditionally, mines consist of an explosive charge that is triggered by the
  victim; they are rigged to detonate when they are stepped on or when a trip
  wire is pulled, or even just when they are touched or moved. They come in all
  shapes and sizes depending on what they intend to target. Soviet forces used
  small butterfly-shaped explosives in Afghanistan that continue to maim
  children who pick them out of curiosity. These have also been found in Ukraine
  in previously occupied territories. Since the start of the full-scale
  invasion, just under 1,000 people have been injured and 359 killed by mines
  and explosive remnants of war, including at least 18 children, according to
  data shared by the state emergency service of Ukraine. UN mining expert Paul
  Heslop says there are already more than 1m mines scattered across Ukraine, and
  that Russian forces “widely booby trapped” parts of the country as they
  retreated. This includes bigger pressure-plate landmines (often called
  anti-tank or anti-vehicle mines) that contain a lot more explosive (5-10kg)
  and are triggered by heavier vehicles such as cars, tanks or military trucks.
  “There is also an awful lot of unexploded shells, rockets, grenades, mortars
  from the fighting, particularly in the buffer zone where artillery’s got
  roughly a 20-mile range,” says Heslop. “While clearing the areas, we are
  looking at a level of complexity, of scale, that we just haven’t seen before.”
  Ukraine has joined Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in recently
  announcing its withdrawal from the Ottawa Convention, which regulates and
  restricts the use of most types of landmines. They cite threats from Russia,
  which they share a border with, as a reason for their decision. In the case of
  Ukraine, however, the concerns are manifold, since the government’s demining
  operations continue even as it considers using mines to deter Russian
  advances. “In the context of an asymmetric threat, Ukraine is forced to ensure
  an adequate level of defence capability,” says Andrii Danyk, who is in charge
  of Ukraine’s demining efforts. Nonetheless, he says, “humanitarian demining
  remains one of the priorities of state policy”. Back in Sumy, Kyseliova is
  working with the Ukrainian Red Cross to allay the fears of local residents in
  and around Shostka trying to rebuild their lives. “We do a lot of educational
  activities. We tell people what to do and what not to do if they come across
  mines. We try to show how to be safer.” But even in places where information
  sessions are run, changing behaviour is difficult, says Kyseliova. “People get
  used to the war. As long as they don’t get killed, they think it’s fine.”
  Children and teenagers are particularly at risk. “Kids just grab things. And
  teens, they want to try risky stuff.”
