  Guardian writers’ predicted position: 8th (NB: this is not necessarily Tom
  Garry’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips) Last season’s
  position: 8th Prospects Everton are entering the season with a fairly
  unfamiliar sense of optimism. It marks a sharp contrast from the mood 12
  months ago and a troubled first half of the last campaign, when their
  threadbare squad was stretched, their serious injury list was mounting and the
  wider club was waiting agonisingly for news of a takeover. Amid that
  uncertainty and what was – at the time – a low budget, some were tipping
  Everton for relegation and the team had to wait until 17 November for their
  first league victory. But once they had won that Merseyside derby their
  confidence soared and the morale-boosting acquisition of the club by The
  Friedkin Group not only gave the players a lift but ensured there were funds
  to spend in January, and they enjoyed a much-improved second half of the
  season to finish a comfortable 14 points clear of the relegation zone in a
  respectable eighth place. Everton have strengthened their squad markedly this
  summer with some eye-catching signings, not least the arrival of three Japan
  internationals – the forward Yuka Momiki, full-back Hikaru Kitagawa and
  centre-back Rion Ishikawa – and their fans will be looking forward to
  welcoming back some longer-term knee-injury absentees from last season, such
  as the Spain forward Inma Gabarro, who has been in impressive form during
  pre-season after missing almost all of last term with an anterior cruciate
  ligament injury. Nobody should be getting too carried away – Everton have not
  suddenly become a team who will challenge for the league – but equally there
  is no reason for the club to fear the drop. A top-half finish is a realistic
  aim and they will certainly want to improve on last season. The manager Brian
  Sørensen, the second-longest-serving manager in the division behind Manchester
  United’s Marc Skinner, has been in charge since the summer of 2022 and is
  entering his fourth season. In April he signed a new deal until 2027. The Dane
  spent large parts of last season looking thoroughly dejected about Everton’s
  injury problems but he has a healthier squad and will surely have enjoyed the
  team’s pre-season trip to his homeland. Sørensen is a relatively quiet, family
  man with a good reputation for his style of football and it will be
  interesting to see what he can achieve with better resources. Off-field
  picture The Friedkin Group has reinvigorated the mood around the women’s team
  and there has been a significant uplift in the number of off-field staff. The
  biggest change, however, came with the historic move to make Goodison Park the
  women’s team’s new home. That not only ensured the 133-year-old ground was
  saved but dramatically improves the women’s team’s matchday facilities
  compared with their former base at Walton Hall Park, which had the league’s
  smallest capacity at just over 2,000. Star signing There is a lot of
  excitement concerning the Spain youth international winger Ornella Vignola,
  who has arrived from Granada. The former Barcelona youngster caught Everton’s
  eye because she likes to take defenders on and her direct running should offer
  the club’s attack a new dimension. She has plenty of experience for a
  20-year-old, including playing in the Champions League, and was part of the
  Spain squad that won the Under-20 World Cup alongside Gabarro in 2022.
  Everton’s loan acquisition of Katie Robinson from Aston Villa will give them
  another skilful option in wide areas. Stepping up Nearly 18 months ago Issy
  Hobson grabbed the headlines by becoming the WSL’s youngest goalscorer at the
  age of 16 with a last-gasp equaliser against Arsenal. The defender, now 17,
  gained valuable experience in the second tier during a loan with Sheffield
  United last term and it will be intriguing to see how much the England youth
  international can push on this season and how much more first-team exposure
  she can gain. There are also high hopes for Everton’s young player of last
  season, Martina Fernández, who made her switch from Barcelona permanent this
  summer after a loan. It was a good summer for … The Everton winger Toni Payne
  was part of the Nigeria side that triumphed in Morocco by winning the Women’s
  Africa Cup of Nations title, extending their record as the continent’s most
  successful team with their 10th title, and their first in seven years. Payne
  received a rapturous reception from her club-mates when she returned for
  pre-season after her country’s 3-2 victory over the hosts in the final. The
  30-year-old appeared in all 22 of Everton’s league fixtures last term and will
  be a key player againwith her pace and strong ball control. Main initiative to
  attract more fans As well as making Goodison Park their main home ground,
  Everton’s women are playing a fixture at the club’s new Hill Dickinson Stadium
  on the banks of the River Mersey. They will host Manchester United at the
  52,000-capacity venue on 12 October, hoping to attract more fans to support
  the women’s side. They are also attempting to boost the region’s grassroots
  prospects by letting out their former home, Walton Hall Park, to the
  third-tier club Liverpool Feds.
