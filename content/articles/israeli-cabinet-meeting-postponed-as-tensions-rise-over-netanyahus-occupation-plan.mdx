  An Israeli security cabinet meeting, which had been expected to discuss
  Benjamin Netanyahu’s call for the “full occupation” of Gaza, has been
  postponed amid mounting tensions over whether the plan is feasible. Amid a
  stalling of ceasefire negotiations with Hamas, Israeli officials had briefed
  local and international media that the prime minister was considering an
  expansive offensive, aimed at taking full control of the Palestinian territory
  after 22 months of war against the militant group Hamas. However, senior
  Israeli military officers and former senior commanders warned the plan would
  endanger the lives of the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas, risk
  further international isolation of Israel and require Israeli soldiers to
  administer a population in which Hamas fighters were still present. Any move
  towards full occupation is likely to be strongly resisted by large parts of
  the international community, already horrified by the conduct of Israel’s
  military campaign. On Tuesday, Trump declined to say whether he supported or
  opposed a potential military takeover of Gaza by Israel and said his
  administration’s focus was on increasing food access to the Palestinian
  territory . “I know that we are there now trying to get people fed,” Trump
  told reporters. “As far as the rest of it, I really can’t say. That’s going to
  be pretty much up to Israel.” Late on Tuesday, a senior UN official warned
  that expanding Israeli military operations inside the territory “would risk
  catastrophic consequences for millions of Palestinians and could further
  endanger the lives of the remaining hostages in Gaza”. Addressing the UN
  security council in New York, Miroslav Jenča, the assistant secretary general
  for Europe, central Asia and the Americas, said: “There is no military
  solution to the conflict in Gaza or the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict.”
  China’s deputy UN representative, Geng Shuang, expressed “great concern” about
  the reported plans for Gaza and added: “We urge Israel to immediately halt
  such dangerous actions.” He called for a ceasefire and urged countries with
  influence to take concrete steps to help bring one about. Israel’s
  scorched-earth campaign has obliterated large parts of Gaza, killed more than
  60,000 people, mostly civilians, forced nearly all of Gaza’s more than 2
  million people from their homes and created what a global hunger monitor last
  week called an unfolding famine. That has caused widespread international
  anger and prompted the UK to say it would recognise a Palestinian state next
  month if there was no ceasefire, amid mounting calls for sanctions against
  Israel. Several other European countries including Portugal and Finland have
  recently signed a statement declaring their willingness to recognize the state
  of Palestine as an essential step towards a two-state solution. The disquiet
  follows briefings to Israeli journalists on Monday saying that Netanyahu had
  decided the expanded offensive was a foregone conclusion. “The die has been
  cast. We’re going for the full conquest of the Gaza Strip – and defeating
  Hamas,” the unnamed sources said, quoting Netanyahu. By Tuesday, however,
  evidence had emerged of deep splits between Netanyahu and senior military
  officials, including the chief of staff, Eyal Zamir, who reportedly voiced
  opposition to the plan, prompting calls for his dismissal. Absent at a
  security cabinet meeting, Netanyahu did, however, meet security officials, but
  not in a decision-making setting. His office said later that the Israeli
  military would carry out any decision made in cabinet. During a visit to an
  army training facility earlier on Tuesday, Netanyahu said: “It is necessary to
  complete the defeat of the enemy in Gaza, to free all our hostages and to
  ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel.” Military analysts in
  the Israeli media, channelling some defence officials, were also sceptical.
  Writing in Yedioth Ahronoth, the military affairs commentator Yossi Yehoshua
  described the risks of the proposal. “Hostages … will die, large numbers of
  IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers will be killed as well as a serious
  logistical problem – where to house the roughly 1 million civilians who are
  now in Gaza City. “Currently, Israel simply doesn’t have legitimacy either to
  continue to fight in Gaza or to establish a city of refugees on its ruins.”
  Israeli officials have said Netanyahu discussed a plan with the White House as
  it attempted to portray Hamas as having walked away from ceasefire
  negotiations, a claim denied by Hamas, which blamed Israel for the protracted
  impasse. While the Trump administration has not commented on the Netanyahu
  proposal, it has been given some credence by leaked comments made by the US
  envoy Steve Witkoff to Israeli hostage families at the weekend, suggesting his
  proposal for a ceasefire in exchange for the release of half of the remaining
  living hostages had failed. Witkoff added that Donald Trump “now believes that
  everybody should come home at once. No piecemeal deals,” adding they were now
  pursuing an “all or nothing” plan. At the centre of the Netanyahu plan is the
  notion that, by surrounding areas where hostages are believed to be held,
  Israeli forces can raid those areas and rescue the captives, a policy that has
  broadly failed during the past two years of war. Amid questions over the
  practicality of a wider offensive, some have speculated that Netanyahu’s call
  may be more rhetorical than real in substance, aimed at keeping onboard
  far-right ministers who have demanded they be allowed to build settlements in
  Gaza. A Palestinian official close to the talks and mediation said Israeli
  threats could be a way to pressure Hamas to make concessions at the
  negotiation table. “It will only complicate the negotiation further, at the
  end, the resistance factions will not accept less than an end to the war, and
  a full withdrawal from Gaza,” the official told Reuters, requesting not to be
  named. Practically, too, it is unclear whether Israel has the capacity for the
  kind of expanded operation described. The IDF has struggled with manpower
  issues as the war drags on, with reservists being repeatedly called up amid
  concerns over a mental health crisis that has included a number of suicides.
  On Tuesday, during a visit to Gaza, Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz,
  suggested a less comprehensive long-term Israeli occupation, saying that
  Israel would maintain a permanent IDF presence in a “security buffer zone” in
  strategic areas of Gaza to prevent future attacks on Israeli communities and
  arms smuggling into the strip. “This is the main lesson of October 7,” said
  Katz. “As in other sectors, here, too, the IDF must stand between the enemy
  and our communities – not only to fight the enemy, but to separate it from our
  civilians.” Inside Gaza on Tuesday, Israeli gunfire and strikes killed at
  least 13 Palestinians, local health authorities said, including five people in
  a tent in Khan Younis and three people seeking food near Rafah in the south.
  Israeli tanks pushed into central Gaza earlier on Tuesday, but it was not
  clear if the move was part of a larger ground offensive. Agencies contributed

  version said that the situation in Gaza had prompted “several European
  countries to say they would recognise a Palestinian state next month if there
  was no ceasefire”. This is the particular position of the UK government;
  additional detail has been included about the position of some other European
  countries.
