  The UK’s plan to recognise a Palestinian state is compliant with international
  law, a minister has said, after a group of peers raised concerns that it did
  not meet the legal bar. Gareth Thomas, a business minister, said it was a
  “political judgment” that Palestine should be recognised and that the
  government believed it was compatible with the criteria for statehood under
  the Montevideo convention, a treaty signed in 1933. In a significant shift in
  the UK’s approach, Starmer said on Tuesday that recognition would take place
  before the UN general assembly in New York this September, unless Israel
  agreed to a series of conditions set out in the UK-led eight-point peace plan,
  which has been backed by allies. The conditions included Israel taking
  “substantive steps” to end the situation in Gaza, reaching a ceasefire,
  committing to no annexation in the West Bank and a long-term peace process. On
  Thursday, however, 40 members of the House of Lords, including high-profile
  lawyers, wrote to Richard Hermer, the attorney general, challenging the prime
  minister’s announcement. They said the move towards recognising Palestine may
  breach international law, questioning whether it met the conditions of having
  a defined territory, a permanent population, an effective government and the
  capacity to enter into relations with other states. Asked whether recognising
  Palestine would be compliant with international law, Thomas told Times Radio:
  “Yes, we believe it is. In the end, recognition of another state is a
  political judgment and over 140 countries have already recognised Palestine,
  and we’re determined to do so in September if Israel does not end the violence
  in Gaza, agree to a ceasefire and agree to a lasting route towards a two-state
  solution, and to no annexation in the West Bank.” In their letter to Hermer,
  the peers said there was no certainty over the borders of Palestine and no
  single government, as Hamas and Fatah were enemies. Thomas told Times Radio
  there was a “clear population” in Palestine and “we have made clear that we
  think you would recognise the state of Palestine, and that state of Palestine
  would be based on the 1967 borders”. In their letter, the peers added: “You
  have said that a selective, ‘pick-and-mix’ approach to international law will
  lead to its disintegration, and that the criteria set out in international law
  should not be manipulated for reasons of political expedience. “Accordingly,
  we expect you to demonstrate this commitment by explaining to the public and
  to the government that recognition of Palestine would be contrary to the
  principles governing recognition of states in international law.” Among the
  peers to have signed the letter are David Pannick – who represented the
  previous government at the supreme court over its Rwanda scheme – as well as
  the KCs Guglielmo Verdirame and Edward Faulks.
