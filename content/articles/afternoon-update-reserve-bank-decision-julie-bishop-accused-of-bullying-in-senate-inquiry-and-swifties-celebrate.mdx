  Good afternoon. The Reserve Bank of Australia has delivered a much-anticipated
  rate cut, lowering the official cash rate from 3.85% to 3.6% even as it warned
  Australians to brace for lower growth and wages in the future thanks to weaker
  productivity growth. Once lenders pass on the relief to their borrowers, the
  third rate cut of the year will deliver somebody with a $500,000 mortgage a
  $74 saving on their monthly interest payments, according to Canstar, bringing
  the total drop to $272. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said the rate cut was
  “very welcome relief for millions of Australians” that gave the government
  “confidence that we are on the right track”. Top news Taylor Swift announces
