  Nigel Farage has set out a plan that he claims would lead to the mass
  deportation of up to 600,000 asylum seekers if Reform were to be elected to
  power. The plan involves ripping up human rights law, building costly
  detention infrastructure and potentially paying corrupt and totalitarian
  regimes billions to accept people put on deportation flights. Here are the key
  planks of the policies – and what the moral and economic costs would be.
  Leaving the ECHR, repealing the Human Rights Act and disapplying international
  conventions The UK would be an outlier among European democracies, in the
  company of only Russia and Belarus, if it were to leave the European court of
  human rights (ECHR). Opting out of treaties such as the 1951 UN refugee
  convention, the UN convention against torture and the Council of Europe
  anti-trafficking convention would also be likely to do serious harm to the
  UK’s international reputation. It could undermine current returns deals,
  including with France, and other cooperation agreements on people-smuggling
  with European nations such as Germany. The Society of Labour Lawyers said the
  plan would “in all likelihood preclude further cooperation and law enforcement
  in dealing with small boats coming from the continent and so increase, rather
  than reduce, the numbers reaching our shores”. Farage said he would legislate
  to remove the “Hardial Singh” safeguards – a reference a legal precedent that
  sets limits on the Home Office’s immigration detention powers – in order to
  allow indefinite detention for immigration purposes. This would be highly
  vulnerable to legal challenge. As Adam Wagner, a barrister, points out, many
  of the rights protected by the ECHR and the Human Rights Act are rooted in
  British case law, so judges would be able to prevent deportations even without
  international conventions. ‘Payouts’ to countries like Iran &amp; Afghanistan
  for returns agreements Reform’s deportation plans rely on striking “returns
  agreements” with countries including Afghanistan, Iran, Eritrea and Sudan,
  offering financial incentives to secure these deals, alongside visa
  restrictions and potential sanctions on countries that refuse. These are
  countries where the Home Office’s risk reports warn of widespread torture and
  persecution. It would risk the scenario of making payments to countries such
  as Iran, whose regime the UK government has accused of plotting terror attacks
  on British soil. The Liberal Democrats called the payments “a Taliban tax”,
  saying the plan would entail sending billions “to an oppressive regime that
  British soldiers fought and died to defeat”. They said: “Not a penny of
  taxpayers’ money should go to a group so closely linked to terrorist
  organisations proscribed by the UK.” Reform’s Zia Yusuf told the BBC that £2bn
  had been earmarked for these deals, partly funded by the UK’s foreign aid
  budget. The party also proposes considering using Ascension Island or other
  remote UK territories to detain people who cannot be returned. Risking the
  Good Friday agreement Farage suggested the plan would require renegotiation of
  the Good Friday agreement, which No 10 denounced as “not serious”. The SDLP’s
  Colum Eastwood said it was “undermining our peace deal for a cheap headline”
  and would make the case stronger for a united Ireland. “These are
  fundamentally unserious proposals from unserious people who haven’t given a
  second’s thought to Northern Ireland, the layered complexities of our fragile
  society, the support for peace from the United States, Europe and others,” he
  said. It could also reignite support for Scottish independence. Cost of
  detention centres and deportation flights Reform UK’s briefing document says
  the scheme would cost £10bn over five years, far less than a near identical
  plan proposed by the former Reform UK MP Rupert Lowe, who estimated his would
  cost £47.5bn in its first five years. Asked why the costs were so different,
  Farage simply said: “Because Zia’s good at maths,” without further
  explanation. Yet the plan suggests building significant infrastructure, and
  with chartered flights is likely to cost tens of billions. It involves
  building new capacity to detain 24,000 people, as well more staffing. Farage
  has previously said Reform would use RAF sites in remote locations to house
  and deport people, but refused to say where they would be, making costs
  impossible to assess. Yusuf claimed that if they revealed the sites then
  Labour would “sell that land rapidly to developers or to green companies”.
  Reforn also proposes a new enforcement unit that will “fuse data from the Home
  Office, NHS, HMRC, DVLA, banks and police”, and says mandatory biometric
  capture will be introduced at police encounters. There is no associated cost
  in the document for this, and past attempts at cross-government databases have
  cost billions. Costs for police to run biometric capture at every encounter
  could run into the tens of millions. New legal obligations and rights removed
  A proposed new law would impose a duty on the home secretary to remove people
  who are in the country illegally, though it is unclear what the consequences
  of any failure to do so would be, or how it would be assessed. It would make
  it illegal for anyone who has arrived in the UK via an irregular route to
  claim asylum. The party claims this would mean courts would not consider any
  claims from those who arrive, for example, by small boats. But when a similar
  move was implemented under the Conservative government as they attempted to
  get the Rwanda scheme off the ground, it led to an enormous backlog and the
  consequence was thousands more people needing to be housed in asylum hotels.
