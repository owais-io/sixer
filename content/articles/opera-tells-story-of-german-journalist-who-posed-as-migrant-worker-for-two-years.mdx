  Few people have done more to change the way postwar Germany looks at itself
  than Levent “Ali” Sigirlioğlu. A 1985 bestselling book detailing the inhumane
  working conditions and everyday racism that the 26-year-old Turkish migrant
  worker endured at Ruhr valley steel plants, asbestos-infested building sites
  and fast-food restaurants was the first to expose the dark underbelly of a
  booming postwar economic revival. The only catch is that “Ali” was not a young
  Turk at all, but a then 43-year-old white German. Günter Wallraff, a
  journalist famed for his deep-cover investigative journalism, had spent two
  years living as “guest worker” Ali, hiding his true identity at the workplace
  with a black wig and darkened contact lenses. “Of course I wasn’t a real
  Turk,” he wrote in a foreword to Ganz Unten (“Lowest of the Low”), “But
  sometimes you have to put on a mask to unmask a society.” Forty years on, a
  new “docu-opera” considers whether Wallraff’s credo would withstand charges of
  brownfacing and cultural appropriation today, and investigates what drove the
  reporter’s transformation. “There’s something to be asked about why a man of
  that intelligence spent years with people who were desperate to just stay
  alive,” says Mehmet Ergen, the show’s Turkish director. “Something inside told
  him that he should do this.” The opera premiered at the Weimar Kunstfest
  festival this week before touring German cities and showing at Ergen’s own
  Arcola theatre in Dalston, London, next year. It dwells less on the precarious
  labour conditions that Wallraff’s reportage portrayed in painstaking detail:
  the temporary employment agencies that acted as de facto human traffickers,
  demanding inhumane working hours of Ali and his colleagues and offering them
  irregular pay and insufficient safety equipment in return. Instead, it
  discovers miniature Brechtian vignettes in Ali’s everyday encounters, such as
  with the funeral directors whom he asks to prepare for his imminent demise
  from exposure to toxic coke oven fumes, or the priests who turn heartless
  heathens when he asks them for a fast-tracked christening to avert an imminent
  deportation. And by asking what drove Wallraff to embark on his investigation,
  it finds universal dramatic themes. Born three years before the end of the
  second world war in Burscheid, western Germany, Wallraff was five years old
  when he was sent to an orphanage, where he was stripped of personal possession
  and his own clothes. “It was dehumanising, nothing remained of home,” he
  recalls in a phone call from his home in Cologne. “When I look back on Ganz
  Unten after intensive psychotherapy, I wonder whether this early trauma was
  not the trigger, the driving force and the opportunity to take on other
  identities later in life, to reinvent myself and assert myself. Lowest of the
  Low wasn’t a journalistic project for me, but an existential necessity.” In
  Ergen’s adaptation, the Anglo-German actor Ryan Wichert plays Günter but his
  alter ego is impersonated by the Turkish actor Burak Bilgili. The opera opens
  with a song, written by the composer Sabri Tuluğ Tirpan, that asks “Who am
  I?”. Before embarking on Lowest of the Low, Wallraff had made a name for
  himself with a trilogy of books that exposed the methods of the powerful
  tabloid Bild, where he had worked for three and a half months under the alias
  Hans Esser. He first experimented with his Ali alias in the early 70s, but
  shelved the project for a decade. A lack of talent for learning languages
  meant his adopted persona was easily blown. “I broke it off probably because I
  sensed what was in store for me,” he says. “I was simply afraid.” Wallraff
  re-embarked on Lowest of the Low in 1982, this time with an invented
  half-Greek parentage to explain his faltering Turkish, and soon found it
  difficult to stop. “I realised that I owed it to my colleagues, who had no
  choice because they needed the work for financial reasons or were in Germany
  illegally. Quitting would have felt like a betrayal.” Ergen, who interviewed
  Wallraff at length to research the play, said: “At Bild, he experienced a lack
  of solidarity. But in these terrible conditions at steel factories, he made
  many friends for life.” Lowest of the Low became an instant bestseller after
  it hit the shelves in 1985, with 2m copies going over the counter within the
  first five months of publication. The book has been translated for almost 40
  territories, including Turkey (though not the US: the publisher Little Brown
  made its offer dependent on being compensated by his German publisher if they
  were being sued). A film version, which used covertly filmed material, won a
  Bafta in 1988. His success brought Wallraff financial stability and
  international renown. The word wallraffa, meaning to do investigative
  journalism under a false identity, has made it into the Swedish Academy’s
  national dictionary. In 1993, he sheltered Salman Rushdie at his home after
  the Indian-born British-American writer went into hiding over the Ayatollah
  Ali Khamenei’s fatwa. From a contemporary perspective, there is a potential
  problem, however. In a foreword to a recent new edition of Lowest of the Low,
  the Turkish-German author Mely Kiyak asked why Ali’s story had to be written
  by a German in disguise when approximately a million “original” Alis lived in
  Germany at the time. Ultimately, Kiyak defends Wallraff’s decision to don
  Ali’s mask: “Social reportage is not a ‘safe space’, and must never be,” she
  writes. But a 2010 investigation into modern German racism, Black on White,
  for which the journalist sprayed himself with black paint and put on a curly
  wig to impersonate a Somali migrant, “Kwami Ogonne”, drew less polite
  criticism. One review described him as a “humourless Borat”. “Accusations of
  cultural appropriation, or whatever you want to call it, don’t affect me,” the
  journalist said. “What I was doing [with Lowest of the Low] was an approach,
  not appropriation. After publication, I received thousands of letters,
  especially from immigrants, who told me: ‘Finally, a German has experienced
  and exposed this. No one listens to us and no one believes us – you are one of
  us.’” Composer Tirpan, who lives in Vienna and recalls first encountering
  Lowest of the Low on his guest worker uncle’s bookshelf in Germany, said
  identity politics should not blind contemporary theatregoers to the book’s
  universal themes. “It’s not only a book about Germany,” Tirpan says. “There
  are lowest of the low in Turkey, in Britain, in the United States, in China,
  in Russia. And Günter Wallraff managed to open our eyes to them.”
