  Thousands of Airbus workers in the UK are to go on strike for 10 days in
  September in a row over pay that threatens to disrupt the production of
  aircraft wings. A series of two-day strikes are planned to begin on 2
  September and continue throughout the month at the company’s factories in
  Broughton, north Wales, and Filton, near Bristol, according to Unite. The
  union represents more than 3,000 Airbus fitters and engineers, with 8,500
  workers employed across the two sites. Unite said 90% of its members at the
  company had voted in favour of the industrial action and the strikes would go
  ahead unless the European aircraft manufacturer improved its pay offer. The
  factories could be forced to pause production during the strike. Wings for the
  A320, A330 and A350 planes, as well as the A400M military aircraft, are
  produced at Broughton and Filton. Any slowdown in production could put
  pressure on the supply chain. Unite said the strikes would disrupt production
  of wings for Airbus’s core commercial and military aircraft and would delay
  deliveries. However, Airbus said it was not concerned about the impact of the
  industrial action on its year-end deliveries. Sue Partridge, Airbus UK’s
  country manager for commercial aircraft, said: “We have made a competitive and
  fair pay offer in 2025 that builds on the strong foundations of pay increases
  totalling over 20% in the last three years and a £2,644 bonus payment made in
  April this year. “Our priority remains to find a resolution together with the
  trade union that ensures the long-term competitiveness and success of Airbus
  in the UK.” Unite called on Airbus to return to talks as it continued to seek
  a pay offer that accounted for inflation and cost of living increases. UK
  inflation rose again in July to a higher-than-expected 3.8%, according to
  official figures released on Wednesday, amid price increases for food and
  travel. Unite added that the offer should reflect “the value of members’
  highly specialised skills”, allowing Airbus to deliver aircraft on schedule.
  Sharon Graham, the union’s general secretary, said: “Airbus is generating
  billions in profit. Workers deserve a fair deal. Our members are simply
  seeking fairness not favours. Airbus workers have the total support of their
  union in this dispute.” The company describes Broughton as a “global centre of
  excellence for wing manufacturing”. Wing structures for Airbus aircraft have
  been produced at the site for more than 50 years. Filton is home to the
  largest concentration of aerospace engineers in northern Europe, according to
  the company, and leads in wing design and support. Airbus aims to increase
  production this year in response to demand from airlines.
