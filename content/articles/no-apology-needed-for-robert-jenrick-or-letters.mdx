  I heard Dr Krish Kandiah’s Thought for the Day on Radio 4 and agree with Alf
  Dubs and Tina Beattie – he was absolutely spot-on with his forthright comments
  on Robert Jenrick’s appalling article (BBC apologises over Thought for the Day
  ‘xenophobia’ claim against Jenrick, 13 August). Jenrick was unquestionably
  xenophobic and, in my and many others’ view, racist in his disgraceful
  terminology. I have volunteered with asylum seekers and refugees for some
  years and met and taught hundreds. The overwhelming majority are good, decent
  people, often highly skilled professionals and the sort of technical workers
  this country is crying out for. If Jenrick knows next to nothing about them,
  it’s because he hasn’t bothered to find out before voicing his ill-informed
  opinions. The BBC should not have apologised. The world needs people like Dr
  Kandiah, Lord Dubs and Marian Budde, the brave bishop who preached so
  eloquently at Donald Trump’s inauguration service, to speak truth to power and
  call xenophobia and racism exactly that when they hear it. Anne Johns Derby •
  I don’t understand the BBC’s reaction to the Thought for the Day that
  mentioned Robert Jenrick. The head of the Sanctuary Foundation, Krish Kandiah,
  quoted the shadow justice secretary as having said: “I certainly don’t want my
  children to share a neighbourhood with men from backward countries who broke
  into Britain illegally, and about whom we know next to nothing.” Kandiah went
  on: “These words echo a fear many have absorbed – fear of the stranger. The
  technical name for this is xenophobia. All phobias are, by definition,
  irrational. Nevertheless, they have a huge impact.” All true and topical, if
  trenchant. So why is it objectionable? If Jenrick doesn’t want to be
  associated with the echoing of xenophobic fears, maybe he should stop echoing
  xenophobic fears. Mark de Brunner Burn Bridge, North Yorkshire • It seems that
  nowadays you can’t call a xenophobe a xenophobe. It’s political incorrectness
  gone mad... Steven Julians Romford, London • Have an opinion on anything
