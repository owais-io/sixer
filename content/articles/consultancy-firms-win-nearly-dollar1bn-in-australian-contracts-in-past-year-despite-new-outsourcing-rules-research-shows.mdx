  The federal government signed contracts worth almost $1bn with consultants
  last financial year – a 48% increase on the previous one – despite committing
  to slash their use, according to research conducted by the parliamentary
  library. The analysis, commissioned by the Greens, shows that while the value
  of contracts with the big four consultancy firms fell from $138m to $114m,
  contracts with all firms increased from $653m to $968m. The increase comes
  months after the Albanese government outlined $6.4bn in future savings by
  cutting the use of consultants along with labour hire firms and “non-wage
  expenses”, including travel, property and hospitality. Sign up: AU Breaking
  News email “While there has been a notable decrease in contracts awarded to
  the largest consulting firms, federal expenditure for private consulting
  services has in fact only been redistributed to other Australian firms,” the
  parliamentary library analysis said. According to the analysis, the value of
  contracts signed with the big four firms – PwC Australia, KPMG, EY and
  Deloitte – has fallen by 47% from the 2021-22 financial year, from $218m to
  $114m. Part of this decline was influenced by the tax leaks scandal involving
  PwC Australia, which led to its entire government advisory unit being divested
  for just $1. This month the finance department lifted a ban on the firm
  competing for new government work. The parliamentary library found the value
  of contracts signed beyond the seven largest firms, which also include
  Accenture, Boston Consulting Group and McKinsey, increased from $496m to $803m
  last financial year, a 61% jump. The library assessed the value of contracts
  signed by departments, rather than the amount of money paid in a single year.
  Large, multi-year contracts could distort figures for any of the years
  assessed. The Greens senator Barbara Pocock, who commissioned the research,
  said the figures did not match the federal government’s rhetoric about its
  cuts to consultants. “While Labor says they’re spending less on consultants,
  this data shows that instead of spending as much on the big four consulting
  firms, the government is spending even more money, but just on other firms,”
  Pocock said. “What’s clear is that the government has been claiming that it
  has been reducing spending on consultants, but all they’re doing is arranging
  deck chairs on the Titanic.” The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, said the
  government had saved $5.3bn during its first term in office, including by
  reducing spending on external labour. “The job is not done,” Gallagher said.
  “We’ve always said that there will continue to be a role for external labour
  in providing specialist expertise, but we have made significant progress
  towards ensuring core public service work is delivered by public servants.
  “Our government is committed to reducing spending on contractors, consultants
  and labour hire and reversing the decade-long trend of outsourcing that became
  entrenched under the Coalition.” In May 2024 Gallagher said the use of
  consultants had dropped by $624m year-to-date compared with the same period in
  2021-22, during the Morrison government. Late last year the finance department
  set new rules for departments, advising them not to engage consultants for
  “core work”, which includes the development of cabinet submissions, drafting
  legislation and policy formulation. The analysis also found that the federal
  government had signed 90 contracts worth $76m in the first two weeks of the
  2025-26 financial year. This represented about 8% of the contracts signed a
  year earlier. The parliamentary library’s research came with several caveats,
  including that it was based on AusTender data, which is often updated and
  occasionally contains incorrect information uploaded by departments.
