  Grenada has vowed to step up its pursuit of an apology and reparations from
  King Charles after new research revealed that George IV personally profited
  from slavery on the Caribbean island. The research by independent scholar
  Desirée Baptiste shows that George IV, who ruled for a decade until 1830,
  received profits from enslaved labour on Grenadian plantations – a finding
  that experts say heightens pressure on the monarchy to confront its historical
  links to slavery. Baptiste found a 1823-24 document at the National Archives
  in London revealing a £1,000 ($1,343) payment – equivalent to around £103,132
  ($138,490) today – from two Crown-owned estates in Grenada where hundreds of
  enslaved people laboured in the 18th and 19th centuries. The funds were paid
  into King George IV’s private coffers, and contributed to his “lavish
  lifestyle”, said Baptiste, a researcher on colonialism and transatlantic
  slavery who has roots in Grenada. Arley Gill, the head of the Grenada
  Reparations Commission said: “We always knew that the Royal Family directly
  profited from the Atlantic slave trade and slavery, but now that we know that
  the Royal Family directly profited from the state of Grenada, we renew our
  call, even stronger now, for the royal family to apologise and to pay
  reparations.” King Charles expressed sorrow over slavery in a speech to
  Commonwealth leaders in 2022, and last year, amidst calls for discussions on
  reparations at the Commonwealth leaders’ summit, the monarch acknowledged the
  “painful aspects” of Britain’s past – but he did not directly address the
  thorny issue of reparations. Gill said the people of Grenada are calling on
  Charles to go further than vague expressions of regret, and make a full
  apology “because blood is on the hands of the British royal family”. “He is
  still the head of state of Grenada. And it will not be worthy of him to be the
  head of state of a country that he profited from in slavery and [for which he]
  failed to apologise and failed to make reparations. He will not be a worthy
  king,” Gill said. He argued the new revelations gave added urgency to efforts
  to remove the King as head of state in Grenada. Baptiste’s research was
  verified by a University of Manchester professor, Edmond Smith, and Nick
  Draper, founder of University College London’s Legacies of British
  Slave-ownership project. Smith, who is supervising a PhD study on the royal
  family’s role in slavery, said as more evidence is uncovered the monarchy’s
  profits from slavery will become clearer. He said this payment “might well
  just be the tip of the iceberg”. Buckingham Palace did not immediately respond
  to a request for comment. King Charles has backed the study led by Smith,
  following a 2023 Guardian report revealing that in 1689 King William III
  received £1,000 ($1,343) in shares in the Royal African Company, which
  trafficked thousands of enslaved Africans to the Americas. “This evidence fits
  with long-term patterns of colonial exploitation by the British royal family,
  including repeated efforts to find novel income streams from colonies in the
  Caribbean,” Smith told Reuters. Baptiste’s research, from her independent
  study “Slaves the Property of His Majesty: George IV and Grenada”, comes amid
  growing global momentum for reparations for slavery, especially across the
  Caribbean and Africa. During the centuries-long transatlantic slave trade more
  than 12.5 million Africans were kidnapped and forcibly transported to the
  Americas, where they were sold into slavery. In July, Caribbean leaders backed
  a petition from Jamaica to King Charles on reparations, which asked the
  monarch to use his authority to request legal advice from the London-based
  privy council – the final court of appeal for UK overseas territories and some
  Commonwealth countries – on whether the forced transport of Africans to
  Jamaica was lawful, if it constituted a crime against humanity, and whether
  Britain was under obligation to provide a remedy to Jamaica for slavery and
  its enduring consequences. Keir Starmer’s government has resisted discussions
  about the issue, with an official spokesperson saying last year, “we do not
  pay reparations”. With reporting by Reuters • This article was amended on 7
  August 2025 to remove a description of George IV as an ancestor of King
  Charles. George IV was Charles’s 4th great-granduncle but not a direct
  ancestor.
