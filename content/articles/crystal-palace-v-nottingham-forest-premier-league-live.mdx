  48 min: … but otherwise, it’s been a quiet start to the second half. Selhurst,
  usually so noisy, is strangely subdued at the moment. 46 min: Forest are
  immediately on the attack, and Ndoye wins a corner down the left. The set
  piece is a non-event. Forest get the second half underway. No changes.
  Half-time entertainment. Jonathan Wilson on today’s late kick-off. El Casico
  hasn’t been a classico, but Palace will be happy enough. They’ve been the
  better side and have their reward. 45 min +2: Wharton curls the free kick
  towards Guehi, who stoops on the right-hand corner of the six-yard box and
  pings a header off the base of the right-hand post. So close to 2-0! 45 min
  +1: Sarr is skittled over by Anderson, just to the left of the Forest D. A
  free kick in a dangerous position. 45 min: There will be one minute of
  additional time. 44 min: Sarr and Williams come together. Oliver Glasner
  thinks it’s a foul, and tells it the way he sees it to the fourth official. 42
  min: Mitchell tees up Hughes for a shot just to the left of the D. Hughes
  carves a screamer towards the bottom-right corner. Inches wide. Not sure Sels
  was getting to that. 41 min: … but having said that, replays show Murillo
  winning the ball, but also catching his man on the top of the foot. The good
  news is, Mateta is fine. 39 min: Guehi advances down the inside-left channel
  and slips a pass infield for Mateta, who is unceremoniously stopped in his
  tracks by Murillo. Palace want a free kick just to the left of the D, but
  they’re not getting one. Hard but fair. Palace suddenly move up a gear.
  Mitchell crosses from the left. It’s half cleared. Hughes switches play to
  Munoz on the right. Munoz crosses low. Sarr, eight yards out, sweeps into the
  bottom-right corner, Sels rooted to the spot. Selhurst erupts! 35 min:
  Gibbs-White plays a cute reverse pass down the left for Anderson, who crosses
  deep. Wood, on the right-hand edge of the six-yard box, hooks back to
  Gibbs-White, who had kept going, and finds himself in space on the penalty
  spot. Gibbs-White leans back and hoicks sky-high. A poor end to a fine move.
  That could have been a great goal. 33 min: The last six matches between these
  two teams: 1-1, 1-0, 1-1, 0-0, 1-1, 1-0. Forest won both of the 1-0s. So this
  is kind of going to form at the moment. These lads not given to goalfests. 31
  min: Devenny makes off down the left, chasing after a ball missed by Sangare.
  He wins a corner. Hughes swings it in for Lacroix, who steers a header
  goalwards, but it’s soft and easy for Sels. 29 min: Mateta has a bash from
  distance. Sels parries a ball heading towards the bottom left. A save he
  should make, even though there was power in the shot. 27 min: Hughes finds
  Mitchell in space on the left. Mitchell crosses low. Milenkovic hooks out for
  a throw with Mateta lurking. The resulting throw leads to a brief game of head
  tennis, before the whistle blows for a foul only the referee spots. Pressure
  off Forest. 26 min: Sarr has the chance to slip Mateta into the Forest box,
  down the inside-right channel on the underlap. But he overhits the pass.
  Palace belatedly waking up. 24 min: Munoz strides down the right, reaches the
  byline, and whips in a cross. Sels slaps it around his near post in a panic.
  But there’s no corner forthcoming, because the cross had already curled out of
  play for a goal kick. 22 min: Wharton drops deep to quarterback. From a deep
  position on the right, he tries to release Devenny into the Forest box down
  the left. His diagonal ping flies into the stand behind the goal. 21 min:
  Hudson-Odoi advances at speed down the left, but upon reaching the edge of the
  Palace box, clanks his shot straight into Richards. 20 min: El Casico is
  currently no classico. 18 min: Munoz has the opportunity to release Sarr down
  the right, but his pass is overhit, and Sarr’s first touch is clumsy. Goal
  kick. 16 min: Forest are slowly getting on top, but it’s a marginal thing,
  because nothing of any import is going on. 14 min: Gibbs-White knocks the ball
  down the right flank and prepares to chase after it. Lacroix hangs out a
  cynical leg to stop a promising attack. Into the book he goes. 12 min:
  Safeway, for example. Or Fine Fare. 10 min: Lacroix half-clears the corner;
  Sangare launches a volley from the edge of the box into the J Sainsbury car
  park behind the stand. Other popular-in-the-1980s supermarket chains are
  available. 9 min: Aina spins Mitchell and advances down the right. He crosses,
  looking for Wood. Lacroix is forced to concede the first corner of the
  afternoon. 7 min: The Forest fans are certainly in a chatty mood. Now they
  give Hughes, formerly of Derby County, the what-for. 5 min: Gibbs-White
  bustles his way past Mitchell down the right and crosses low for Wood, who
  flips a first-time shot wide right from six yards. Big chance. A brisk, fun
  start to this game. 3 min: … and then suddenly the match springs into life.
  Wood nearly gets the better of Mitchell in the race for a long ball. Not
  quite. Then Palace counter, and Devenny powers into the box from the left.
  He’s entitled to shoot, but tries to find Mateta in the middle instead.
  Murillo blocks and Sels smothers. 2 min: Nothing doing on the pitch yet. In
  the stands, the Forest fans launch the first aural salvo, informing the home
  support that Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis “does what he wants”. Palace get
  the ball rolling. El Casico is go! The teams are out. Palace sport their red
  and blue stripes, while Forest are in white shirts that pay homage to
  Nottingham’s Lace Market, incorporating [unfolds press release, adjusts
  monocle and squints] “a pattern that weaves together the club’s iconic crest
  and the NG postcode”. A fine atmosphere as ever at Selhurst, the home fans
  unveiling a tifo of Joel Ward lifting the FA Cup. We’ll be off in a couple of
  minutes. Oliver Glasner’s turn to talk to Sky Sports. “With [Eberechi Eze] we
  have lost one of our crucial players … one of our top players … but on the
  other side we could also win games without him … at Villa for example … this
  is what we have to do … trust this group of players … we have had a great
  start to the season … we will get the right players I’m pretty sure … we will
  have a good team as well … we always rely on each other … we want to play our
  football … that is what made us successful and will keep us successful.” As
  for the background noise regarding all matters CAS, Nuno says: “It is always
  very hard at Selhurst Park … today more, because there’s a lot of things going
  on … I always insist on the same narrative that it’s not us to blame … but we
  don’t have any way to avoid it … it is going to be intense and we have to be
  ready.” Nuno Espírito Santo talks to Sky Sports, and is asked if he’s trying
  to “engineer a way out of Nottingham Forest”. “That’s nonsense, it doesn’t
  make any kind of sense … we are focused on the game … making sure the players
  are ready to play this game … it will be very tough.” Does he want to continue
  in his role as Forest boss? “Of course. Of course.” Is there a need for talks
  between himself, Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis, and head of football Edu?
  “Yes, that’s what we need to do, and we’re gonna do it … today for sure not,
  because of the match, but soon, of course … there is no speculation around
  anything … we have to communicate and approach the final days of the market …
  prepare our boys.” Noises Off dept. Ed Aarons gauges opinions of the events
  that have led us to El Casico. Unsurprisingly, not too many meet in the
  middle. Crystal Palace make two changes to the side that started the
  Conference League qualifier against Fredrikstad. Tyrick Mitchell and Chris
  Richards come in for Borna Sosa and Jefferson Lerma. Nottingham Forest select
  exactly the same 11 players that started the opening-day 3-1 win over
  Brentford. They’ve still got the same manager as well. For now. Crystal
  Palace: Henderson, Richards, Lacroix, Guehi, Munoz, Wharton, Hughes, Mitchell,
  Sarr, Mateta, Devenny. Subs: Matthews, Benitez, Lerma, Clyne, Esse, Edouard,
  Sosa, Rodney, Cardines. Nottingham Forest: Sels, Aina, Milenkovic, Murillo,
  Williams, Sangare, Anderson, Ndoye, Gibbs-White, Hudson-Odoi, Wood. Subs:
  Gunn, Morato, Douglas Luiz, Kalimuendo, Igor Jesus, Hutchinson, Yates, McAtee,
  Boly. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Welcome to our coverage of a grudge
  match between the team that qualified for the Europa League but has for
  administrative failings been cashiered into the Conference League, against the
  team that qualified for the Conference League but has taken the Europa League
  place of the team that qualified for the Europa League but has for
  administrative failings been cashiered into the Conference League. The Court
  of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has a lot to answer for, one way or another.
  The game some have dubbed El Casico† – there’s rarely opportunity to say this
  these days, but thank you, the internet – kicks off at 2pm UK time. It’s on! †
  El Casico, though! That’s right up there with Yesterday and Ulysses for things
  I wish I’d written.
