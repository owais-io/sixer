  “It felt really scary … like being in the middle of a burning city during a
  night raid.” Dr Arwyn Edwards is not describing urban warfare but a recent hot
  and foggy day on a Svalbard glacier, where record-breaking summer heat turned
  his workplace into a cascade of meltwater and falling rocks. Edwards is a
  leading researcher in glacier ecology – the study of life forms that live on,
  within and around glaciers and ice sheets. Over two decades of polar research,
  he has always felt “relaxed and at home” on ice. But the accelerating climate
  breakdown is beginning to erode that sense of security. While mean global
  temperatures have not yet breached the 1.5C Paris target, the Arctic blew past
  that landmark long ago. Svalbard is heating seven times faster than the world
  average. Time is running out to understand these fragile ecosystems and the
  trillions of dollars in climate costs they could unleash. Edwards describes
  the cold-adapted microbes he studies as “the watchkeepers and arch-agitators
  of Arctic demise”. Recent research implicates snow and ice-dwelling microbes
  in positive feedback loops that can accelerate melting. With more than 70% of
  the planet’s freshwater stored in ice and snow – and billions of lives
  sustained by glacier-fed rivers – this has profound implications everywhere.
  Yet not all polar microbes amplify global heating. Emerging evidence suggests
  that certain populations are – for now – applying a brake to methane
  emissions. Frozen rainforests Until recent decades, most scientists assumed
  Arctic ice and snow were largely devoid of life. On Longyearbreen, a Svalbard
  glacier close to the world’s most northerly town, Edwards digs through the
  remnants of last winter’s snow pack, to explain how that assumption missed the
  mark. Edwards notes that all fresh snowfall contains microbes and, remarkably,
  microbes themselves can trigger snowflake formation. Each cubic centimetre of
  snow on the glacier contains hundreds to thousands of living cells, he says,
  and typically four times as many viruses – a microbial habitat as complex as
  topsoil. “The organisms that can survive here are very, very evolutionarily
  advanced,” Edwards says. During summer, snow surfaces can host red-pigmented
  algae that swim up and down through surface layers, seeking sunlight for
  photosynthesis without getting burned. Intense blooms create the phenomena
  known as ‘watermelon snow’ or “blood snow”, first described by Aristotle.
  Beneath the snow, Edwards’ shovel hits solid glacier ice – another rich
  habitat where microbes flourish despite intensely low temperatures, minimal
  nutrients, and extreme oscillations between perpetual winter darkness and the
  endless days of Arctic summer. “If I look at a glacier surface, I don’t see
  ice. I see … a three dimensional bioreactor,” Edwards says. Embedded in the
  ice are dark, soil-like fragments. Despite their unremarkable appearance,
  these “cryoconite granules” have been called the “frozen rainforests” of the
  ice. Each granule is a self-sustaining ecosystem in minature, containing
  diverse bacteria, fungi, viruses, protists and even tiny animals like
  tardigrades and worms. These microbial communities can exert influence on a
  global scale but Edwards is frustrated that many glaciologists treat them as
  mere “impurities”. “Oceanographers would not treat fish in the sea as
  impurities,” he says. Microbes that live in surface ice and snow produce
  dark-coloured pigments to harness sunlight and shield themselves from damaging
  UV light. They also trap dark-coloured dust and debris. Together, these
  factors darken snow and ice, causing it to absorb more heat and melt faster –
  a process known as “biological darkening”. Microbes also respond to global
  changes, such as increased nutrients from air pollution, wildfire smoke or
  wind-blown dust from receding glaciers and expanding drylands. “The snowpack
  chemistry is now different to preindustrial era snow,” Edwards says. Rising
  temperatures and longer melt seasons caused by global heating further
  accelerate the growth of ice-darkening microbes. Together, these factors have
  the potential to trigger an amplifying positive feedback loop: ice-darkening
  microbes nudge up temperatures and accelerate melt, exposing more
  nutrient-rich debris that encourage the growth of yet more microbes, which
  darken the surface further still. Each summer, a biologically darkened zone,
  visible from space, covering at least 100,000 sq km, appears on the
  south-western part of the Greenland ice sheet. According to a 2020 study,
  microbes there are responsible for 4.4 to 6.0 gigatons of runoff, representing
  up to 13% of total melt, from an ice mass that holds enough water to raise
  global sea levels by more than 7 metres. These effects are acknowledged in
  IPCC reports but not yet incorporated into climate projection models. Across
  the European Alps, Himalayas, central Asia and beyond, at least 2 billion
  people depend on glacial meltwater for drinking water, agriculture and
  hydropower. Yet even if the world meets Paris targets, half these glaciers
  will not survive this century. Methane eaters Beyond surface darkening lies a
  second threat: methane. In many parts of the Arctic, glaciers and permafrost
  cap vast underground stores of this potent greenhouse gas, preventing its
  release. Recent studies have also revealed that microbes thriving in the cold,
  dark, high-pressure world underneath glaciers can produce large volumes of
  fresh methane. Thawing permafrost and receding glaciers can trigger previously
  unanticipated methane emissions from deep underground. Across the fjord from
  Longyearbyen, Prof Andy Hodson, of the University Centre in Svalbard,
  demonstrates this at a collection of “pingos” – mounds formed when pressurised
  groundwater surges upward through frozen ground. The water that emerges is
  saturated with methane. Hodson likens the effect to glaciers and ice “fracking
  the landscape and pushing this gas out. We’ve got methane pissing out the
  ground from wherever fluids can migrate from beneath the permafrost.” On cue,
  a sudden belch of methane disturbs the surface of a pingo pool. “I’m not going
  to say there’s a 50 petagram methane bomb about to go off,” Hodson says. But
  with recent estimates suggesting emissions from Arctic feedback loops could
  add $25-70tn to climate costs, the stakes couldn’t be higher. One reason
  Hodson remains relatively calm about this particular site is because he and
  colleagues discovered recently that specific microbial communities living in
  the pingo can out-compete methane-producing microbes and actively consume
  methane. “This is where the methanotrophs [‘methane eaters’] are really saving
  the day,” Hodson says. Methanotrophs will certainly not curtail emissions
  everywhere but without them, much more methane would escape. ‘A terminally ill
  glacier’ Standing on the surface of Foxfonna, a central Svalbard glacier,
  Edwards describes how the ice surface here is 4 metres lower than it was last
  summer, with the glacier much diminished since his first visit in 2011. “This
  is a terminally ill glacier,” says Edwards, “This is palliative, and yet
  nobody cares.” Like every animal body, each glacier hosts its own unique
  microbiome, sometimes containing species found nowhere else. As Edwards
  searches in vain for a particular microbial habitat he studied last year,
  likely lost to melt and erosion, he likens his experience to coral reef
  biologists watching their study sites bleach and die. These imperilled snow-
  and ice-dwelling microbial species not only have intrinsic and scientific
  value, but potentially tremendous economic worth, too. Their genetic
  adaptations to extreme cold, darkness and low nutrients represent a library of
  possible biotechnological solutions for medicine, industry and waste
  management. As global heating advances, society is rapidly losing its
  opportunity to use, study, and conserve this unique trove of biological
  diversity. Edwards advocates for an international repository to preserve polar
  microbial diversity – analogous to Svalbard’s Global Seed Vault, which stores
  crop varieties in permafrost vaults nearby. “Ultimately, when I retire or die,
  I want [a microbial repository] to act as an enduring resource for future
  generations, because they will not have this glacier or that glacier, or that
  glacier over there,” he says, gesturing to the huge, endangered landscape.
  Many visitors come to witness Svalbard’s spectacular wildlife, which remains
  abundant – for now. On a boat trip to a central fjord, we encounter more than
  80 beluga whales. Yet even this thriving pod depends on invisible microbes:
  the whales feed on fish that consume plankton nourished by marine microbes,
  which themselves depend on nutrients released by nearby glaciers – habitats
  partly controlled by the microbes Edwards studies. It’s a reminder that polar
  microbes don’t just influence ice melt and global climate; they underpin
  entire ecosystems. Without them, this abundance would vanish. Edwards compares
  his regular trips to the Arctic to visiting his father suffering from vascular
  dementia in a care home. Each visit revealed further loss. “It’s a
  step-by-step progression,” he says. “You wouldn’t see it dwindling day by
  day.”
