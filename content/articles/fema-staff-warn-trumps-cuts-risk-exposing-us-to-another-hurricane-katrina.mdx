  Donald Trump’s attacks on the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) risk
  exposing the US to another Hurricane Katrina, staff at the agency have warned
  Congress in a withering critique that also takes aim at its current
  leadership. Writing in the run up to this week’s 20th anniversary of the
  devastating 2005 storm that killed 1,833 people and caused widespread
  destruction in New Orleans and the Gulf coast, more than 180 current and
  former Fema employees say the Trump administration’s policies are ignoring the
  mistakes that led to it. The letter, sent to members of Congress and a council
  formed to examine the agency’s future, follows months of criticism of Fema
  from Trump and senior administration officials, who have threatened to close
  it, prompting more than 2,000 staff – about one-third of its permanent
  workforce – to depart, leaving it short of institutional expertise in key
  positions. It comes after last month’s deadly flooding in Texas that left at
  least 135 – including 37 school children – dead. Experts said the death toll
  may have been inflated by the upheaval at Fema, claiming it diminished its
  capacity to respond quickly. The letter, entitled The Katrina Declaration,
  accused the Trump administration of disregarding the Post-Katrina Emergency
  Reform Act (PKERMA), passed in 2006 with the intention of absorbing the
  lessons of the disaster. “Hurricane Katrina was not just a natural disaster,
  but a man-made one,” the signatories wrote. “The inexperience of senior
  leaders and the profound failure by the federal government to deliver timely,
  unified, and effective aid to those in need left survivors to fend for
  themselves. “Two decades later, Fema is enacting processes and leadership
  structures that echo the conditions PKERMA was designed to prevent.” It is
  also scathing about Kristi Noem, who as homeland security secretary, has
  overall responsibility for Fema, and about two administrators who have been
  placed in charge of the agency since Trump’s inauguration. “Since January
  2025, Fema has been under the leadership of individuals lacking legal
  qualifications, Senate approval, and the demonstrated background required of a
  Fema administrator,” the signatories said. The letter identifies the current
  Fema acting administrator, David Richardson, who has no previous experience in
  disaster management, and his predecessor, Cameron Hamilton, who was appointed
  by Trump only to be fired after publicly saying he opposed plans to abolish
  the agency. “Decisions made [by Noem, Richardson and Hamiltion] … hinder the
  swift execution of our mission, and dismiss experienced staff whose
  institutional knowledge and relationships are vital to ensure effective
  emergency management,” it said. Noem has angered seasoned officials by
  demanding that contracts worth more more than $100,000 be personally approved
  by her – a stipulation specialists say significantly slowed the response to
  the Texas floods. Richardson’s suitability was questioned after he told staff
  that he did not know the US had a hurricane season – which lasts from the
  start of May till 30 November. His office later insisted he was joking. The
  letter states: “Our shared commitment to our country, our oaths of office, and
  our mission of helping people before, during, and after disasters compel us to
  warn Congress and the American people of the cascading effects of decisions
  made by the current administration.” Six statements of opposition in the
  letter include condemnation of “the ongoing failure to appoint a qualified
  FEMA administrator, as required by law”. It also includes criticism of the
  administration’s “censorship of climate science”. “This administration’s
  decision to ignore and disregard the facts pertaining to climate science in
  disasters shows a blatant disregard for the safety and security of our
  nation’s people and all American communities regardless of their geographic,
  economic or ethnic diversity,” the signatories write. A petition at the end of
  the letter demands that Fema be given full cabinet level agency status and
  defended from interference from the Department of Homeland Security. The
  department recently ordered Fema agents to assist Immigration, Customs and
  Enforcement (Ice) agents in immigration raids, threatening to fire those who
  refused. Trump, who has set up a review council headed by Noem to consider
  Fema’s future, has repeatedly said he favors its abolition, though he softened
  his rhetoric following the Texas floods, amid suggestions that it could be
  “rebranded” with more of its functions being devolved to the states.
  Thirty-six of the signatories – including some currently working at the agency
  – attached their names, leaving them open to possible retribution. Another 144
  withheld their identities. One signatory, Michael Coen, a former Fema chief of
  staff under Joe Biden and Barack Obama, told the Guardian in a statement: “I
  am proud of the current and former FEMA employees for having the courage to
  speak up. Lessons were learned from Katrina and Congress took action. Those
  lessons and actions are being disregarded by the Trump administration.” Daniel
  Llargués, Fema’s acting press secretary, dismissed the criticisms voiced in
  the letter. “It is not surprising that some of the same bureaucrats who
  presided over decades of inefficiency are now objecting to reform,” he told
  the New York Times. He said the Trump administration “is committed to ensuring
  Fema delivers for the American people” and to cutting “red tape, inefficiency
  and outdated processes” in the agency.
