  … and on that note, it’s a wrap! The US president, Donald Trump, has said he
  was not considering pulling US troops out of Poland (17:52, 18:08) and pledged
  to stand with Warsaw “all the way” during a meeting with the country’s
  conservative nationalist president, Karol Nawrocki, at the White House
  (15:50). Trump’s comments were welcomed by Polish leaders (19:49), offering
  some relief after months of speculations about the future of US military
  presence in Poland (18:28). During the meeting, Trump also said he was “not
  happy” with the number of people dying during the Russian invasion on Ukraine,
  and stressed he wanted it “stopped now” (18:18). The US president said he
  would respond to Putin’s decision on the peace process, warning: “If we are
  unhappy about it, you will see things happen” (17:55). The Washington meeting
  came just hours before tomorrow’s summit of the Coalition of the Willing in
  Paris, with Volodymyr Zelenskyy set to join a group of leaders for futher
  talks on security guarantees for Ukraine. The host, French president Emmanuel
  Macron, declared on Wednesday night that Europe was “ready to provide security
  guarantees” once a peace deal is agreed, signalling further progress in
  planning discussions behind the scenes (19:25). The leaders will talk with
  Trump on Thursday to discuss next steps, the Élysée Palace confirmed (18:50).
  Earlier on Wednesday, Zelenskyy met with the Nordic and Baltic leaders in
  Denmark (15:12, 15:16). Meanwhile, Russia’s president Vladimir Putin suggested
  he would be ready to meet with Zelenskyy if the Ukrainian president came over
  to Moscow (16:01, 16:22, 19:40), an offer immediately rejected by Kyiv
  (17:16). And that’s all from me, Jakub Krupa, for today. If you have any tips,
  comments or suggestions, email me at jakub.krupa@theguardian.com. I am also on
  Bluesky at @jakubkrupa.bsky.social and on X at @jakubkrupa. Despite domestic
  political disagreements in the build up to Nawrocki’s visit to Washington, a
  number of senior Polish government figures have welcomed Trump’s reassurances
  that he was not looking to reduce the number of US troops in Poland. Poland’s
  prime minister Donald Tusk, who will take part in tomorrow’s Coalition of the
  Willing summit in Paris, said: “President Trump has just declared that the
  United States had no plans, and does not plan in the future, to withdraw
  American troops from Poland. These are important words that confirm the
  timeless nature of our alliance.” Deputy prime minister and defence minister
  Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz said: “An important declaration by President
  @realDonaldTrump about the presence of American troops in Poland. This is
  proof that the strategic [Polish-American] alliance, which is one of the
  foundations of our security, is extremely strong.” Deputy prime minister and
  foreign minister Radosław Sikorski said: “It is good that President Trump
  confirmed the continued stationing of American troops in Poland. On matters of
  security, deterring Putin, and supporting Ukraine, the government and the
  opposition speak with one voice.” Here is a clip showing Vladimir Putin’s
  comments in Beijing, as he argued that Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy “should
  come to Moscow” for peace talks about the war. Spoiler alert: Ukraine is not
  keen (17:16). Aaaand just like that: Volodymyr Zelenskyy has just arrived at
  the Élysée Palace, welcomed by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, ahead of
  tomorrow’s talks with the Coalition of the Willing. In his opening remarks,
  Macron said that building on the preparatory work by military planners, Europe
  was “ready to provide security guarantees to Ukraine and the Ukrainians” once
  a peace accord is agreed. “The question now is to determine the sincerity of
  Russia and its successive commitments on peace talks made to the US,” he said.
  Curiously, two diplomatic sources told Reuters that US special envoy Steve
  Witkoff is also in Paris, ahead of tomorrow’s meeting. Meanwhile we are
  getting a bit more details on tomorrow’s summit of the Coalition of the
  Willing in Paris and online. The Élysée Palace has confirmed Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy’s suggestion earlier today (15:12), saying that the leaders will
  speak with US president Donald Trump by phone after their meeting. The French
  president’s office said that one of the aims of the meeting is to say “we are
  capable, with regard to our American partners, of honouring the commitments we
  have made, while it is up to them to maintain or increase pressure on Russia,”
  AFP reported. The call with Trump is expected around 1pm BST, 2pm CEST, with a
  press conference to follow later. Ukraine’s Zelenskyy is expected in Paris
  very shortly, where he will meet for talks and dinner with the host, Emmanuel
  Macron. One should always be cautious about judging the visit from its first
  half hour, but you bet that Nawrocki’s officials in Warsaw are very pleased
  with that they just heard. Concerns about the future of the US military
  presence in Poland and the broader region have featured very prominently in
  the Polish public debate in recent months, with rumours and speculations about
  potential reduction of US troops in the country amid signals about the US
  looking to shift its focus and prioritise the Indo-Pacific region. To get
  Trump to say in this meeting that he’s got no plans to do so (18:08) – or even
  that he could increase their presence (17:52) – is a big political win for
  Nawrocki and his allies. When Poland controversially skipped the recent
  Zelenskyy-Trump meeting in the White House, Nawrocki’s aides argued their
  primary focus was on a bilateral agenda with the US, and this issue would
  feature prominently on their list coming into today’s meeting. Obviously, you
  just never know with Trump as he can and often does change his views. But for
  now, that was exactly what Nawrocki and his team were hoping for. Asked what
  he will do to end the war, Trump says he will have a conversation with “him” –
  erm - “very shortly, and I will know pretty much what we are going to be
  doing.” (It’s not entirely clear if he means Putin or Zelenskyy or Nawrocki,
  as confirmed by a desperate journalist asking “but who”) “We’ve taken very
  strong action, as you know, and in other ways, we’ve taken very strong action,
  but I’ll be speaking to him over the next few days and we’re going to see,” he
  says. He adds that he is “not happy” with the number of people being killed
  every week there. “They’re human beings, their souls, they have parents. They
  wave goodbye to their parents, and their parents never see them again … I want
  to see it stopped now,” he says. He then blames Biden for the Russian invasion
  on Ukraine, saying: A big reason this war happened was sitting right in these
  chairs, this one in particular. He ends by saying he thought the Russian
  invasion on Ukraine wouldn’t be that difficult to end, and “would be in the
  middle of the pack, maybe on of the easiest,” but adds: “You never know with
  war. War is complex and dangerous and what a mess, what a bloody mess. It’s
  going to be done one way or the other. But they have to stop killing all of
  these souls.” And that ends the press spray in the Oval Office. Trump hails
  his tariff policy now. He also celebrates the US deal with the EU, saying “we
  made a deal with the European Union where they’re paying us almost a trillion
  dollars, and they’re happy to do it.” “You know that? They’re happy it’s
  done.” He talks about it in the context of the Supreme Court case on tariffs,
  which he says is going to be “very, very big.” Asked about the US-Polish
  relations, Trump says Poland is in “a very special relationship” category. He
  goes even further on his promise to not pull out any troops from Poland – but
  in the process confirms there are considerations about pulling some troops
  from other European countries. “It’s like the question about the soldiers that
  was asked. We never even thought in terms of removing soldiers from Poland. We
  do think about it with regard to other countries, but we would never … we’re
  with Poland all the way, and we will help Poland protect itself.” Poland’s
  Nawrocki then says “it is the first time in Polish history … that the Poles
  are happy to have foreign soldiers in Poland.” He says Poland is not a “free
  rider” within Nato as it spends 4.7% GDP on defence, and will reach the new 5%
  target soon. Trump notes that “Poland was one of two nations that paid more
  than they were supposed to within Nato.” Over the last few minutes, Trump has
  been mostly speaking about domestic US issues, including Venezuela and his
  anti-crime agenda. So, here is a picture from inside the Oval Office: Trump
  was also earlier asked about the Chinese military parade, saying it was a
  “beautiful ceremony” and “very, very impression.” He says the US should have
  been acknowledged in speeches “for helping China to gain its freedom.” “But I
  understood the reason they were doing it, and they were hoping I was watching,
  and I was watching. My relationship with all of them is very good. We’re going
  to find out how good it is over the next week or two.” Asked for his message
  to Russia’s Putin, Trump says: “I have no message to President Putin, he knows
  where I stand. He’ll make a decision one way or the other, whatever his
  decision is, we will either be happy about it or unhappy and if we’re unhappy
  about it, you’ll see things happen.” Trump angrily reacts to a suggestion from
  a Polish reporter that he has not followed up on his warnings to Putin,
  despite the Russian president still not agreeing to a meeting with Ukraine’s
  Zelenskyy. “How do you know this? How do you know there’s no action? Really?,”
  he says. He points to sanctions on India that “cost hundreds of billions of
  dollars.” “You call that no action, and I haven’t done phase two yet or phase
  three, but when you say there’s no action, I think you ought to get yourself a
  new job,” he says. Straight away, we have a big declaration that Poland will
  be very happy with. Asked about the US military posture in Poland and whether
  the US troops will remain there, Trump says: "I think so. I mean, do you know
  something I don’t? [I’m] very happy. If anything, we can put more there, if
  they want; they’ve long wanted to have a larger presence. We have some
  countries that have more, not too many, but no, they will be staying in
  Poland. We are very much aligned with Poland.” Trump and Nawrocki are now
  speaking from the Oval Office. Trump welcomes his guest saying “he had an
  incredible race” and “came from behind” to win it “very handily” in what he
  says was a “pretty tough, pretty nasty race.” “I don’t endorse too many
  people, but I endorsed him, and I was very proud of that the job he’s done,”
  he tells of Nawrocki. Nawrocki thanks him for his support during the campaign
  and hails “strong” relations with the US, paying tribute to the Polish
  diaspora in the country. The pair also pay tribute to the Polish F-16 pilot
  who died last week, maj Maciej “Slab” Krakowian, with Trump calling him “a
  legend.” Moving on to the meeting, Trump says they will talk about trade,
  among other things. If you want to follow Nawrocki’s visit, you can watch out
  stream below, which should show the leaders’ Oval Office chat when it begins
  soon-ish. I will obviously bring you all the key news lines here. Poland’s
  Nawrocki is arriving at the White House now, with Trump welcoming him outside.
  As part of the official welcome, the pair is also expected to watch a military
  flyover from the South Lawn, which is reported to involve F16 and F35 fighter
  jets. The F16 are reportedly involved to pay tribute to a Polish fighter jet
  pilot who died in a tragic accident at an airshow in Poland last week, Polish
  media were told. But there is also a commercial element to it: Poland is
  Nato’s top spender, spending billions on US military equipment, including on
  fighter jets. For background on the visit, read our full report: In the
  meantime, Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha responded to Putin’s
  non-starter of a suggestion that Zelenskyy could travel to Moscow for
  bilateral talks on ending the war (16:01). Sybiha said: “Right now, at least
  seven countries are ready to host a meeting between leaders of Ukraine and
  Russia to bring an end to the war. Austria, the Holy See, Switzerland,
  Türkiye, and three Gulf states. These are serious proposals and President
  Zelenskyy is ready for such a meeting at any point of time. Yet, Putin
  continues to mess around with everyone by making knowingly unacceptable
  proposals. Only increased pressure can force Russia to finally get serious
  about peace process.” As we wait for Nawrocki to leave Blair House in
  Washington and get en route to the White House (the whole 230m!), let me bring
  you an update from London. Earlier today, the UK government has sanctioned 11
  Russian officials and organisations allegedly involved in the Kremlin’s policy
  of forced deportations and indoctrination of Ukrainian children. The UK
  government said that “to date, more than 19,500 Ukrainian children have been
  forcibly transferred or deported by the Russian authorities to Russia and the
  temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine.” UK foreign secretary David Lammy
  said: “The Kremlin’s policy of forced deportations, indoctrination and
  militarisation of Ukrainian children is despicable, and demonstrates the
  depths of depravity that President Putin will reach to erase Ukrainian
  language, culture and identity.” More details about the package can be found
  here. Polish president Karol Nawrocki is expected at the White House in the
  next few minutes. His predecessor as Poland’s head of state, Andrzej Duda, who
  left the office in August after 10 years and also had close relations with
  Trump, has just been speaking to Republika TV. He said: “In today’s era of the
  resurgence of Russian imperialism, in today’s age of an unmistakable Russian
  threat, the necessity to strengthen Euro‑Atlantic ties, the necessity to
  deepen cooperation with the United States – of course from the standpoint of
  our own interest, of our security, but also our economic interest – is, in my
  view, absolutely fundamental. … This applies not only in terms of safeguarding
  the security of Nato’s entire eastern flank, but also in terms of securing the
  continued economic development of the entire European Union.” And that ends
  Putin’s press conference in Beijing. Good timing: given that we are expecting
  Poland’s Nawrocki at the White House in the coming hour, we will no doubt see
  Trump asked about some of the points raised about Putin in his press
  conference. Putin also got asked about his invitation, expressed during the
  Alaska summit, for Trump to visit Russia. He says there are no active
  preparations for any such visit, but the invitation remains open. Putin also
  suggested Russia could send a more senior representation for future talks with
  Ukraine. Asked about it, he said: “If there’s a need to increase the level of
  the representative group, we are prepared for this. I am not prepared to talk
  about specific people, but yes, we’re prepared … to lift it to a very high
  political level.” Putin was also asked about the prospect of more EU sanctions
  against Russia or its allies, including China and India. He said the leaders
  did not discuss this during their recent conversations. “This does not concern
  us. Events in Ukraine are just an excuse for economic decisions against
  certain countries,” he claimed. In another set of comments about the state of
  war, Putin said: “I believe that if common sense is there, then it is possible
  to agree an acceptable option or acceptable way of ending this conflict.” He
  praised the US administration saying “they have got the will and desire to
  find a solution.” “I think there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. We will
  see. Otherwise, we will be forced to resolve all our objective objectives
  through military means.” Putin also claimed that Russian forces were advancing
  on all fronts in Ukraine, and argued that in his view Ukraine was increasingly
  not capable of conducting large-scale offensive due to limited means. Putin
  was also asked about German chancellor Friedrich Merz’s comments calling him
  “a war criminal.” Rejecting his criticism, Putin replied it was “an awkward
  attempt to remove from himself - not from himself personally, but from the
  country - the responsibility for the tragedy that is taking place in Ukraine.”
  He then made a reference to the Minsk agreements, alleging that Europeans did
  not stand by the agreement. (Not saying anything about Russia’s non-observance
  of its provisions, though.) “We will never accept a situation where Russia is
  just observing how its rights are ignored,” he said. Here is the relevant
  excerpt from Putin’s press conference in Beijing: “I’ve never excluded the
  possibility of meeting with him. But does it make sense to meet with him?” He
  suggested that Zelenskyy’s term has expired with “no means of extending it,”
  once again questioning his legitimacy to hold the office without elections.
  “So does it make sense to meet with the current administration? We could do
  that; I’ve never refused to do that if that leads to some positive outcomes,”
  he argued. He said Trump asked him if it was possible to which he replied: “I
  said yes, it was possible, let him come to Moscow.” (Translation from the
  Russian via Sky News) We are getting some lines from Russian president
  Vladimir Putin, via Reuters, speaking about the prospects of a high-level
  meeting with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He is reported to have said “let
  Zelenskyy come to Moscow and the meeting will happen,” with a caveat that the
  meeting needs to be “well prepared.” I will bring you full quotes as soon as
  we have them. Poland’s conservative nationalist president Karol Nawrocki is
  due to meet Donald Trump at the White House in the first serious test of his
  foreign policy credentials. Backed by the populist rightwing opposition Law
  and Justice party, which ruled Poland between 2015 and 2023, Nawrocki
  unexpectedly won Poland’s presidential election after running a campaign under
  a Trumpesque slogan of “Poland first, Poles first”. The historian turned
  politician had met the US president before the election, securing his highly
  prized endorsement and presenting himself as someone who could safeguard
  Poland’s interests with the conservative US administration. When he won, Trump
  posted on Truth Social: “Such a great win in Poland by Karol Nawrocki. He will
  be a great president!” Nawrocki’s visit to the White House on Wednesday will
  be his first overseas trip since taking office last month, and is expected to
  focus on security issues, including Ukraine, but also on economic and energy
  cooperation. But the visit has also prompted fresh tensions with the nation’s
  pro-European government led by Donald Tusk. Nawrocki, a fierce critic of Tusk
  who has pledged to continue supporting Kyiv but opposes Ukraine’s membership
  in Nato and pushed for tightening the benefits paid out to Ukrainian refugees
  in Poland, publicly clashed with the government over his intention to pursue
  his foreign policy independently of the government. For more background, read
  the full story: In her comments, Frederiksen says that “maybe the most
  important part of future security guarantees in Ukraine is ensuring that you
  have a strong army – a well-equipped and trained Ukrainian army.” “We have
  said from the beginning of this war that you are not only fighting your own
  war, you are fighting for the entire future of Europe. And therefore we have
  to continue [our support],” she said. She also talked about the need for
  further security guarantees, which will be discussed at the Coalition of the
  Willing’s meeting on Thursday. Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Denmark’s
  Mette Frederiksen are now talking with journalists after the earlier NB8
  meeting on Ukraine. Zelenskyy stresses that Ukraine really counts on further
  support via the Nato’s PURL programme, and talks about the need for air
  defence system supplies which he describes as “absolutely strategic” ahead of
  winter. The Ukrainian president also says that he wants the future security
  guarantees for Ukraine to go further than the existing wartime arrangements to
  make sure that “it doesn’t matter who will be the leader of one or another
  country, this system has to work” to uphold peace. As a journalist invites him
  to criticise Trump for not putting more pressure on Russia, he elegantly
  sidesteps that question and stresses that Ukraine needs the US “on our side,
  in this crucial period.” He stresses that Ukraine needs more air defence
  systems, and “to be realistic, mostly United States has it.” But he eventually
  concedes that some decisions are progressing “very slow.” Zelenskyy also talks
  about the importance of further sanctions on Russia, pointing out that it’s
  been more than two weeks since Trump-Putin conversation, with Russia seemingly
  showing no interest in progressing the talks – despite the promise made to the
  US president. He reveals that the leaders taking part in the Coalition of the
  Willing meeting tomorrow “will try to connect with President Trump, and we’ll
  speak about it.” Asked if he could trust Putin’s word, he replies: Nobody
  trusts Putin. He adds: “Who can give you guarantees that Putin will not
  continue [the invasion]? Nobody. He lied so many times, so we can’t trust it.”
  Nato secretary general Mark Rutte said he expected tomorrow’s talks between
  European leaders in Paris to firm up plans on security guarantees for Ukraine,
  and pave the way to get a clearer picture on US involvement. “Tomorrow will be
  an important meeting, so I expect tomorrow, or soon after tomorrow, to have
  clarity on what collectively we can deliver,” Rutte told journalists at a
  press conference alongside Estonian president Alar Karis. “That means that we
  can engage even more intensely, also with the American side to see what they
  want to deliver in terms of their participation.” After a heavy night of
  Russian attacks in Ukraine, it’s another busy day for European diplomacy as
  leaders seek new ways to pressure Russia into engaging with the peace process
  and are confronted with a new geopolitical reality. Ukraine’s Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy is in Denmark, meeting with the Nordic and the Baltic leaders (the
  so-called NB8) to discuss further support for his country, while Poland’s
  president Karol Nawrocki is about to make his debut appearance on the
  international stage visiting US president Donald Trump at the White House. We
  should hear from all of them this afternoon. But then Slovak prime minister
  Robert Fico is in Beijing, where – fresh from meeting one-on-one with Russian
  president Vladimir Putin and talking about the need for “standardisation” of
  their bilateral relations – he joined a massive military parade intended to
  show China’s military might. Xi Jinping said the world was facing a choice
  between peace or war as he held China’s largest-ever military parade, joined
  by Putin and Kim Jong-un in a show of defiance to the west. Putin also invited
  Kim Jong-un to visit Russia during a lengthy meeting in Beijing on the
  sidelines of China’s biggest military parade, as Kim promised to do
  “everything I can to assist” Moscow. Let’s see what the day brings us. I will
  bring you all the key updates here. It’s Wednesday, 3 September 2025, it’s
  Jakub Krupa here, and this is Europe Live. Good afternoon.

… and on that note, it’s a wrap! The US president, Donald Trump, has said he was not considering pulling US troops out of Poland (17:52, 18:08) and pledged to stand with Warsaw “all the way” during a meeting with the country’s conservative nationalist president, Karol Nawrocki, at the White House (15:50).

We never even thought in terms of removing soldiers from Poland. We do think about it with regard to other countries, but we would never … we’re with Poland all the way, and we will help Poland protect itself.” Poland’s Nawrocki then says “it is the first time in Polish history … that the Poles are happy to have foreign soldiers in Poland.” He says Poland is not a “free rider” within Nato as it spends 4.7% GDP on defence, and will reach the new 5% target soon. Trump notes that “Poland was one of two nations that paid more than they were supposed to within Nato.” Over the last few minutes, Trump has been mostly speaking about domestic US issues, including Venezuela and his anti-crime agenda. So, here is a picture from inside the Oval Office: Trump was also earlier asked about the Chinese military parade, saying it was a “beautiful ceremony” and “very, very impression.” He says the US should have been acknowledged in speeches “for helping China to gain its freedom.” “But I understood the reason they were doing it, and they were hoping I was watching, and I was watching. My relationship with all of them is very good. We’re going to find out how good it is over the next week or two.” Asked for his message to Russia’s Putin, Trump says: “I have no message to President Putin, he knows where I stand. He’ll make a decision one way or the other, whatever his decision is, we will either be happy about it or unhappy and if we’re unhappy about it, you’ll see things happen.” Trump angrily reacts to a suggestion from a Polish reporter that he has not followed up on his warnings to Putin, despite the Russian president still not agreeing to a meeting with Ukraine’s Zelenskyy. “How do you know this? How do you know there’s no action? Really?,” he says. He points to sanctions on India that “cost hundreds of billions of dollars.” “You call that no action, and I haven’t done phase two yet or phase three, but when you say there’s no action, I think you ought to get yourself a new job,” he says. Straight away, we have a big declaration that Poland will be very happy with. Asked about the US military posture in Poland and whether the US troops will remain there, Trump says: "I think so. I mean, do you know something I don’t? [I’m] very happy. If anything, we can put more there, if they want; they’ve long wanted to have a larger presence. We have some countries that have more, not too many, but no, they will be staying in Poland. We are very much aligned with Poland.” Trump and Nawrocki are now speaking from the Oval Office. Trump welcomes his guest saying “he had an incredible race” and “came from behind” to win it “very handily” in what he says was a “pretty tough, pretty nasty race.” “I don’t endorse too many people, but I endorsed him, and I was very proud of that the job he’s done,” he tells of Nawrocki. Nawrocki thanks him for his support during the campaign and hails “strong” relations with the US, paying tribute to the Polish diaspora in the country. The pair also pay tribute to the Polish F-16 pilot who died last week, maj Maciej “Slab” Krakowian, with Trump calling him “a legend.” Moving on to the meeting, Trump says they will talk about trade, among other things. If you want to follow Nawrocki’s visit, you can watch out stream below, which should show the leaders’ Oval Office chat when it begins soon-ish. I will obviously bring you all the key news lines here. Poland’s Nawrocki is arriving at the White House now, with Trump welcoming him outside. As part of the official welcome, the pair is also expected to watch a military flyover from the South Lawn, which is reported to involve F16 and F35 fighter jets. The F16 are reportedly involved to pay tribute to a Polish fighter jet pilot who died in a tragic accident at an airshow in Poland last week, Polish media were told. But there is also a commercial element to it: Poland is Nato’s top spender, spending billions on US military equipment, including on fighter jets. For background on the visit, read our full report: In the meantime, Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha responded to Putin’s non-starter of a suggestion that Zelenskyy could travel to Moscow for bilateral talks on ending the war (16:01). Sybiha said: “Right now, at least seven countries are ready to host a meeting between leaders of Ukraine and Russia to bring an end to the war. Austria, the Holy See, Switzerland, Türkiye, and three Gulf states. These are serious proposals and President Zelenskyy is ready for such a meeting at any point of time. Yet, Putin continues to mess around with everyone by making knowingly unacceptable proposals. Only increased pressure can force Russia to finally get serious about peace process.” As we wait for Nawrocki to leave Blair House in Washington and get en route to the White House (the whole 230m!), let me bring you an update from London. Earlier today, the UK government has sanctioned 11 Russian officials and organisations allegedly involved in the Kremlin’s policy of forced deportations and indoctrination of Ukrainian children. The UK government said that “to date, more than 19,500 Ukrainian children have been forcibly transferred or deported by the Russian authorities to Russia and the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine.” UK foreign secretary David Lammy said: “The Kremlin’s policy of forced deportations, indoctrination and militarisation of Ukrainian children is despicable, and demonstrates the depths of depravity that President Putin will reach to erase Ukrainian language, culture and identity.” More details about the package can be found here. Polish president Karol Nawrocki is expected at the White House in the next few minutes. His predecessor as Poland’s head of state, Andrzej Duda, who left the office in August after 10 years and also had close relations with Trump, has just been speaking to Republika TV. He said: “In today’s era of the resurgence of Russian imperialism, in today’s age of an unmistakable Russian threat, the necessity to strengthen Euro‑Atlantic ties, the necessity to deepen cooperation with the United States – of course from the standpoint of our own interest, of our security, but also our economic interest – is, in my view, absolutely fundamental. … This applies not only in terms of safeguarding the security of Nato’s entire eastern flank, but also in terms of securing the continued economic development of the entire European Union.” And that ends Putin’s press conference in Beijing. Good timing: given that we are expecting Poland’s Nawrocki at the White House in the coming hour, we will no doubt see Trump asked about some of the points raised about Putin in his press conference. Putin also got asked about his invitation, expressed during the Alaska summit, for Trump to visit Russia. He says there are no active preparations for any such visit, but the invitation remains open. Putin also suggested Russia could send a more senior representation for future talks with Ukraine. Asked about it, he said: “If there’s a need to increase the level of the representative group, we are prepared for this. I am not prepared to talk about specific people, but yes, we’re prepared … to lift it to a very high political level.” Putin was also asked about the prospect of more EU sanctions against Russia or its allies, including China and India. He said the leaders did not discuss this during their recent conversations. “This does not concern us. Events in Ukraine are just an excuse for economic decisions against certain countries,” he claimed. In another set of comments about the state of war, Putin said: “I believe that if common sense is there, then it is possible to agree an acceptable option or acceptable way of ending this conflict.” He praised the US administration saying “they have got the will and desire to find a solution.” “I think there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. We will see. Otherwise, we will be forced to resolve all our objective objectives through military means.” Putin also claimed that Russian forces were advancing on all fronts in Ukraine, and argued that in his view Ukraine was increasingly not capable of conducting large-scale offensive due to limited means. Putin was also asked about German chancellor Friedrich Merz’s comments calling him “a war criminal.” Rejecting his criticism, Putin replied it was “an awkward attempt to remove from himself - not from himself personally, but from the country - the responsibility for the tragedy that is taking place in Ukraine.” He then made a reference to the Minsk agreements, alleging that Europeans did not stand by the agreement. (Not saying anything about Russia’s non-observance of its provisions, though.) “We will never accept a situation where Russia is just observing how its rights are ignored,” he said. Here is the relevant excerpt from Putin’s press conference in Beijing: “I’ve never excluded the possibility of meeting with him. But does it make sense to meet with him?” He suggested that Zelenskyy’s term has expired with “no means of extending it,” once again questioning his legitimacy to hold the office without elections. “So does it make sense to meet with the current administration? We could do that; I’ve never refused to do that if that leads to some positive outcomes,” he argued. He said Trump asked him if it was possible to which he replied: “I said yes, it was possible, let him come to Moscow.” (Translation from the Russian via Sky News) We are getting some lines from Russian president Vladimir Putin, via Reuters, speaking about the prospects of a high-level meeting with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He is reported to have said “let Zelenskyy come to Moscow and the meeting will happen,” with a caveat that the meeting needs to be “well prepared.” I will bring you full quotes as soon as we have them. Poland’s conservative nationalist president Karol Nawrocki is due to meet Donald Trump at the White House in the first serious test of his foreign policy credentials. Backed by the populist rightwing opposition Law and Justice party, which ruled Poland between 2015 and 2023, Nawrocki unexpectedly won Poland’s presidential election after running a campaign under a Trumpesque slogan of “Poland first, Poles first”. The historian turned politician had met the US president before the election, securing his highly prized endorsement and presenting himself as someone who could safeguard Poland’s interests with the conservative US administration. When he won, Trump posted on Truth Social: “Such a great win in Poland by Karol Nawrocki. He will be a great president!” Nawrocki’s visit to the White House on Wednesday will be his first overseas trip since taking office last month, and is expected to focus on security issues, including Ukraine, but also on economic and energy cooperation. But the visit has also prompted fresh tensions with the nation’s pro-European government led by Donald Tusk. Nawrocki, a fierce critic of Tusk who has pledged to continue supporting Kyiv but opposes Ukraine’s membership in Nato and pushed for tightening the benefits paid out to Ukrainian refugees in Poland, publicly clashed with the government over his intention to pursue his foreign policy independently of the government. For more background, read the full story: In her comments, Frederiksen says that “maybe the most important part of future security guarantees in Ukraine is ensuring that you have a strong army – a well-equipped and trained Ukrainian army.” “We have said from the beginning of this war that you are not only fighting your own war, you are fighting for the entire future of Europe. And therefore we have to continue [our support],” she said. She also talked about the need for further security guarantees, which will be discussed at the Coalition of the Willing’s meeting on Thursday. Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Denmark’s Mette Frederiksen are now talking with journalists after the earlier NB8 meeting on Ukraine. Zelenskyy stresses that Ukraine really counts on further support via the Nato’s PURL programme, and talks about the need for air defence system supplies which he describes as “absolutely strategic” ahead of winter. The Ukrainian president also says that he wants the future security guarantees for Ukraine to go further than the existing wartime arrangements to make sure that “it doesn’t matter who will be the leader of one or another country, this system has to work” to uphold peace. As a journalist invites him to criticise Trump for not putting more pressure on Russia, he elegantly sidesteps that question and stresses that Ukraine needs the US “on our side, in this crucial period.” He stresses that Ukraine needs more air defence systems, and “to be realistic, mostly United States has it.” But he eventually concedes that some decisions are progressing “very slow.” Zelenskyy also talks about the importance of further sanctions on Russia, pointing out that it’s been more than two weeks since Trump-Putin conversation, with Russia seemingly showing no interest in progressing the talks – despite the promise made to the US president. He reveals that the leaders taking part in the Coalition of the Willing meeting tomorrow “will try to connect with President Trump, and we’ll speak about it.” Asked if he could trust Putin’s word, he replies: Nobody trusts Putin. He adds: “Who can give you guarantees that Putin will not continue [the invasion]? Nobody. He lied so many times, so we can’t trust it.” Nato secretary general Mark Rutte said he expected tomorrow’s talks between European leaders in Paris to firm up plans on security guarantees for Ukraine, and pave the way to get a clearer picture on US involvement. “Tomorrow will be an important meeting, so I expect tomorrow, or soon after tomorrow, to have clarity on what collectively we can deliver,” Rutte told journalists at a press conference alongside Estonian president Alar Karis. “That means that we can engage even more intensely, also with the American side to see what they want to deliver in terms of their participation.” After a heavy night of Russian attacks in Ukraine, it’s another busy day for European diplomacy as leaders seek new ways to pressure Russia into engaging with the peace process and are confronted with a new geopolitical reality. Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy is in Denmark, meeting with the Nordic and the Baltic leaders (the so-called NB8) to discuss further support for his country, while Poland’s president Karol Nawrocki is about to make his debut appearance on the international stage visiting US president Donald Trump at the White House. We should hear from all of them this afternoon. But then Slovak prime minister Robert Fico is in Beijing, where – fresh from meeting one-on-one with Russian president Vladimir Putin and talking about the need for “standardisation” of their bilateral relations – he joined a massive military parade intended to show China’s military might. Xi Jinping said the world was facing a choice between peace or war as he held China’s largest-ever military parade, joined by Putin and Kim Jong-un in a show of defiance to the west. Putin also invited Kim Jong-un to visit Russia during a lengthy meeting in Beijing on the sidelines of China’s biggest military parade, as Kim promised to do “everything I can to assist” Moscow. Let’s see what the day brings us. I will bring you all the key updates here. It’s Wednesday, 3 September 2025, it’s Jakub Krupa here, and this is Europe Live. Good afternoon.
