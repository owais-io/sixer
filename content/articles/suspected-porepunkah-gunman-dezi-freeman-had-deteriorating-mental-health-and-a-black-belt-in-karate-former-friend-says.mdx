  The suspected Porepunkah gunman has a black belt in karate and is an expert
  bowhunter, according to a man who has known him since the 1990s. On the fifth
  day of the manhunt for Dezi Freeman, a former friend has questioned whether
  police were aware of his deteriorating mental health, suggesting that sending
  10 officers to his door to execute a warrant would have been “the worst thing
  for him”. Freeman, 56, is alleged to have killed two police officers and
  injured a third on Tuesday in Porepunkah, north-east of Melbourne. The man,
  who did not wish to be named because he still lives in the region where
  Freeman remains at large, first met the alleged gunman when he volunteered on
  a farm about three decades ago. At that time, the man said, Freeman was living
  out of his car and was known as Desmond Filby. The man regularly socialised
  with Freeman over the years, and described him as a fit and avid outdoorsman,
  who was a skilled bowhunter with a black belt in karate, something the man
  verified because of his own martial arts background. Sign up: AU Breaking News
  email But the man described Freeman as “unemployable” because of his issues
  with authority and his mental health. Freeman confirmed in documents he filed
  in the Victorian supreme court last year that he was a “disability pensioner”
  whose wife and three children survived on a single Centrelink payment. “He
  couldn’t hold a job because he had mental health issues … [and] as soon as
  there was any authority, he didn’t react to it well,” the former friend said.
  “He wasn’t violent or anything, he just didn’t tolerate it.” Freeman’s mental
  health appeared to deteriorate during a stint living in Myrtleford, from about
  2016 to 2019, the man said, and then spiralled further as he was drawn into
  the so-called freedom movement during the Covid-19 pandemic. The man, who said
  he last saw Freeman about two years ago, believed his intelligence was “one of
  his downfalls”, fuelling a curiosity that led to him being radicalised online.
  Given Freeman’s history with firearms and interactions with police, the man
  questioned the decision of officers to execute the warrant as they had on
  Tuesday. The Victorian chief police commissioner, Mike Bush, has confirmed
  that a risk assessment was done and that it had considered deploying the
  special operations group from Melbourne, but did not request the elite
  tactical unit. The appropriateness of that risk assessment is being
  investigated by police, as is how Freeman accessed guns given he did not have
  a firearms licence. “The worst thing for him would have been having 10 police
  showing up at his doorstop,” the man said. “Don’t get me wrong, what he did
  was horrible, but it was never going to end well. “He won’t harm civilians, I
  don’t think – he’s not that sort of person, but he’ll have a go at the cops,
  that’s for sure.” Freeman and his extended family have lived in the region for
  decades. James Filby, a younger brother, who also lives in the state’s
  north-east, has posted “my prayers are with the fallen police and their
  grieving familes (sic)” on social media. Freeman’s former friend suggested he
  would feel safe around the hamlet of Nug Nug, on the Buffalo River, to the
  west of Mount Buffalo. Freeman lived with his family for several years at Nug
  Nug, before moving to Myrtleford, and then on to the property at Porepunkah,
  where the shooting happened. This property also backed on to the Mount Buffalo
  national park. The western side of Mount Buffalo was steeper, the man said,
  with caves and crevasses that Freeman would be familiar with. The Nug Nug
  property Freeman was said to live on is near the end of a long dirt road,
  which passes bushland and a camp ground on the river before winding through
  sweeping green land in the foothills of the mountain. On Saturday, a tattered
  piece of faded police tape was tied around the letterbox at the roadside, next
  to the entrance to a long driveway. The house at the end of it was not visible
  from the road. The former friend hopes the bloodshed has finished, and that
  Freeman surrenders soon. “It’s just tragic … it’s sad it ended up like this.”
