  Inua Ellams was walking through the streets of Lagos, the bustling former
  capital of Nigeria, when he began noticing a recurring phrase, spray-painted
  on to the sides of homes. “This house is not for sale,” it read. “Beware of
  419.” The number refers to section four, chapter 19 of the Nigerian criminal
  code, which specifically deals with fraud – obtaining goods or property by
  false pretences – and the warnings were painted on houses to deter conmen who
  would access empty properties and sell them without the owner’s consent. Now
  the criminal code reference has become a catch-all term for Nigerian cons and
  illicit financial activity. The most famous form 419 takes in the west is the
  internet con, also known as the Spanish Prisoner, where the target (or “mark”)
  is offered a sizable cut from a sum of money that needs to be transferred out
  of the country, often by someone claiming to be working for a bank or a
  powerful figure (posing as the brother of the Nigerian dictator Sani Abacha
  was a popular tactic in the 00s). But in Nigeria the term has a universal
  meaning. “It covers everything,” Ellams tells me. “From a five-year-old trying
  to get extra sweets from his parents to a businessman embezzling money from
  his company.” The playwright first noticed the signs back in 2013. He had been
  in town to research his hit play Barber Shop Chronicles, the award-winning
  tale about African men and their relationships, when the seed for his latest
  project was planted. That project is The 419, a series of photographic
  portraits by Oluwamuyiwa “Logor” Logo and sonnets written by Ellams that
  combine to tell the story of how money and 419 culture weaves into every facet
  of Lagosian life. Actors will record Ellams’s sonnets so that you can hear the
  images “speak” as you gaze at them. The story starts with Zaria, an area boy –
  a thug for hire – who sells weed, before we meet a trader called Ronke who
  needs a guide to get her through a local market. Things slowly move up the
  food chain of Lagosian society to show how the lives of work-site foremen,
  architects and even a governor are all connected by the money that flows
  through the country. “Four one nine is the lubricant that greases the wheels
  of Nigerian localised capitalism,” says Ellams. Logor’s portraits will hang on
  the walls of the West Wing gallery at Somerset House in London and depict
  real-life Lagosians who Ellams met and interviewed and whose stories he
  stitched together into sonnets. Those verses bind together as a crown of
  sonnets – meaning each opening line can be combined to create a new sonnet.
  The language evolves as the story progresses and the subjects become more
  middle class and managerial, as pidgin makes way for more formal English. It’s
  a fittingly intricate setup for a work that unpicks a byzantine world of
  money, bartering and power. Ellams and Logor aren’t the first people to find
  inspiration in the phenomenon of Nigeria’s informal economy. In 2000, the
  Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto argued in his book The Mystery of Capital
  that the key to unlocking Nigeria’s potential lay in formalising the informal
  economy that 419 scams help to power. But Ellams’s new work has a different
  approach: perhaps, it posits, we’ve been thinking about 419 offences all
  wrong. What if this extra-legal system of money and power is entirely logical
  in a country without the kind of welfare state that Europeans take for
  granted? “The more I went back to Nigeria as an adult, the more I realised
  that what we termed as 419 often is the necessity of surviving in a country
  where there isn’t any sort of social safety net,” he says. “And there’s always
  this need to try and make more money to survive, literally to survive.” Ellams
  has a work-in-progress theory about the evolution of 419 in Nigeria. He thinks
  that the tradition of always ensuring you didn’t turn up to someone’s house
  empty-handed (a yam, or other produce, was expected as a gift) has morphed
  into the contemporary “cash is king” culture. “I suspect that when capitalism
  came, the demand or the expectation for goods became the expectation for cash,
  then became a demand for cash,” he says. “Somewhere it got corrupted.” The
  repurcussions of 419 culture are huge, linking the country with a reputation
  for corruption. The former prime minister Boris Johnson wrote in a Spectator
  column that young people had “an almost Nigerian interest in money”, while the
  current Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch announced that she no longer sees
  herself as Nigerian. “There are several things I think about Badenoch, none of
  them are good,” says Ellams. “I think she’s suffered various identity crises,
  which have only deepened since she became leader of the Conservative party.
  And I think in her appeal to be more British, she’s trying to cut off things
  that are undivorceable from her being, from her physical being, from her
  identity.” What does Ellams hope people take away from The 419? “Art at its
  most primal is simply a mirror,” he says. “It just shows you who you are and
  asks you to confront the world. And that’s what I’m trying to say: these are
  individuals, they live in a different place. That different place requires
  them to act in a specific way. How would you act if you were in those exact
  situations?” • The 419 is at Somerset House, London, 9-14 September
