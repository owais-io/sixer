  The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, has said he is ready to “pay a very
  heavy price” for resisting US attempts to dictate the country’s trade
  policies, as India took a defiant position in the wake of Trump’s punitive
  export tariffs. In an executive order signed on Wednesday, Trump slapped India
  with an additional 25% tariff, in a move he described as punishment for
  continuing to purchase large quantities of Russian oil and “fuelling Russia’s
  war machine”. It came on top of a 25% tariff for Indian exports already
  announced by the US president. India’s foreign ministry hit back almost
  instantly, calling the additional tariff “unfair, unjustified and
  unreasonable” and accusing the US of double standards, as other countries also
  importing Russian oil have not faced the same punitive action. In a speech on
  Wednesday night which did not directly mention Trump or the new tariffs, Modi
  appeared defiant as he addressed one of the biggest sticking points in India’s
  ongoing trade negotiations with the US over tariffs. According to Indian
  officials, the US has been pushing India to allow for the import of American
  genetically modified (GM) crops into the country and for duty-free imports on
  US farm and dairy products. However, protecting India’s hundreds of millions
  of farmers – who are a powerful political lobby – is seen as a highly
  sensitive area for the Modi government. Indian officials said these areas were
  “non-negotiable on principle” and were firm that “we can’t import GM”. That
  stance was reflected in Modi’s speech on Wednesday night. “India will never
  compromise on the interests of its farmers, livestock rearers and fisherfolk,”
  he said. “And I know that I will personally have to pay a very heavy price for
  this, but I am ready.” While trade negotiations continue between Indian and US
  officials, it was widely acknowledged they had been torpedoed by Trump’s
  announcement of a total 50% tariffs for India, which will come into effect on
  27 August unless another deal is agreed in time. Shashi Tharoor, an MP for the
  opposition Congress party, said the tariffs seemed to signal “some other
  hidden message from Washington” and declared that India should “also impose a
  50% tariff on US goods”. The Congress party president, Mallikarjun Kharge,
  slammed the US attempt to use tariffs to coerce India into shifting its trade
  and foreign policies, which have seen it maintain a relationship with Russia
  for decades. “India’s national interest is supreme,” said Kharge. “Any nation
  that arbitrarily penalises India for our time-tested policy of strategic
  autonomy … doesn’t understand the steel frame India is made of.” The
  opposition also directed anger towards the BJP government and the prime
  minister, with opposition MP Tejashwi Yadav accusing Modi of “dancing to
  America’s tune”. Not long ago, Indian media had been celebrating the “special
  relationship” between Modi and Trump and its benefits for India, but by
  Wednesday the mood had shifted, and anti-American and anti-Trump sentiment was
  rife across India’s newspapers and TV channels. “India’s sovereignty is
  non-negotiable and its foreign policy choices cannot be manipulated by other
  countries, no matter how significant their own ties with India are,” ran an
  editorial in The Hindu newspaper. In his Indian Express column, Pratap Bhanu
  Mehta called Trump “imperialism on steroids” and said that “capitulating to
  this emerging American imperial state, under the euphemisms of reform, realism
  or capitalist reset, is an affront to both India’s dignity and its interests”.
  Trump was widely accused of hypocrisy, as China – another major buyer of
  Russian oil – was not facing the same punishing tariffs and neither was
  Turkey. There was also deep-rooted scepticism that Trump was making the
  decision for the benefit of Ukraine and the feeling that the president had
  ultimately shot himself in the foot by turning on India. “Before the latest
  dust-up, India remained one of the few nations on earth where Trump was not
  deeply disliked,” wrote the author Jonah Blank. “In sorting through what went
  wrong, Indians should remember two pieces of advice often given to the
  lovelorn. First: it’s not you, it’s him. Second: he’s not capable of a
  relationship with anyone.” Walter Ladwig, a senior lecturer in international
  relations at King’s College London, who specialises in south Asia, emphasised
  that trade had long been a “testy issue” between New Delhi and Washington, but
  while “what’s happening now is not unprecedented, it is sharper in tone and
  more coercive in method”. “This is the most serious public rift in years, but
  neither side benefits from a rupture,” he said. “I expect India to hold firm
  on buying Russian oil, frame it as a matter of sovereignty and energy
  security, and quietly look for an off-ramp.” The US is India’s largest export
  market, where shipments totalled nearly $87bn (£65bn) in 2024. Experts said
  the economic impact of 50% tariffs on Indian exports to the US was likely to
  be sizeable, particularly in certain sectors such as textiles, ready-made
  clothes, auto-components, steel and gems, and would put India at a major
  disadvantage compared with regional competitors such as Vietnam, Bangladesh
  and China. “This is a severe setback. Nearly 55% of our shipments to the US
  will be affected,” said SC Ralhan, the president of the federation of Indian
  export organisations. Prerna Prabhakar, a senior associate at the Centre for
  Social and Economic Progress, a Delhi thinktank, emphasised that the US was
  “definitely a very important export destination for India”. She said that if
  the 50% tariffs do come into play “some sectors are going to have a very, very
  hard time”, with smaller textile and apparel firms likely to take a major hit.
  However, Prabhakar emphasised that India’s own high tariffs meant it still
  only accounted for 2% of exports globally. Rather than responding to Trump by
  raising tariffs, Prabhakar said that India’s approach should instead be to
  reduce them, to better integrate itself into global markets and open up other
  trade opportunities with regions such as the EU, Africa and Latin America. “If
  India wants to offset this problem of being at a disadvantage in the US
  market, it has to work on its own competitiveness issues,” she said.
  “Fundamental to that is lowering its own tariffs.”
