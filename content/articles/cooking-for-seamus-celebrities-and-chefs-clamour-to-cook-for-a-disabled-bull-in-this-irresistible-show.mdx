  Cooking for Seamus: celebrities and chefs clamour to cook for a disabled bull

  The YouTube comedy docuseries Cooking for Seamus has an irresistible premise:
  what if a huge disabled bull named Seamus was a food critic, on a cooking show
  that catered entirely to his sensibilities and tastes? The result is a show
  that’s not only eccentric and funny, but an utterly delightful meditation on
  the importance of food and care and community, featuring a very hungry animal.
  Seamus is a disabled bull who lives with palsy; when he was born he was
  considered too sick to live, but was saved by an animal rescuer, his “mum” BJ,
  who also pops up through the show. For months Seamus couldn’t even stand up or
  lift his head to feed, and as a result, quickly became enamoured with “human”
  food – and in large amounts. “All the farmers around here were laughing and
  taking bets on how long I can keep him alive,” recalls BJ. Cooking for Seamus
  was created by a laconic folk musician named Archer who now cares for Seamus
  and takes feeding him seriously. The pair live in a leaky caravan out near
  Castlemaine in Victoria, on a creek surrounded by other rescued animals,
  including Seamus’s best friend, a goat named Lillian. “I believe he has one of
  the most advanced palates in the history of the world,” Archer says, as part
  of the explanation of why he’s created an entire cooking show for his animal
  friend. Seamus, via Archer, rates his meals out of 10; after Seamus eats his
  meal, licking his chops with his ears flicking, Archer will watch him
  intently, trying to gauge whether the meal was a hit for its discerning
  critic. “I reckon he’s in the 9s, maybe a 9.2” Archer decides, after Seamus
  chows down a bucket of pumpkin penne pasta. Sign up for the fun stuff with our
  rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday
  morning Each episode, ranging between five and 20 digestible minutes,
  typically centres on a celebrity chef coming to cook a meal for Seamus – like
  the American musician Martha Spencer, who not only cooks a huge helping of
  Appalachian cornbread and pinto beans for Seamus, but spends much of the
  episode singing songs to an audience of rescue animals. Other guests include
  comedian and YouTube chef Nats What I Reckon, whose laid-back approach to
  cooking is a spiritual match to the docuseries. “What do you think of food
  critics?” asks Archer. “Not much,” drawls Nat. Probably my favourite guest was
  the legendary performer Kamahl, who explains that he doesn’t really like
  cooking and instead feeds Seamus 27 bananas while wearing a golden cape and
  reciting counterculture poetry. If it sounds funny, it’s meant to – everyone
  involved has a good understanding of the humour of the entire situation.
  There’s a recurring shot of Seamus being called for dinner and gently rolling
  down the hill in excitement. But it’s also a love letter to a certain kind of
  quiet living; not a huge amount happens in most episodes apart from some nice
  conversations, some beautiful folk songs and a bull eating mass amounts of
  human food, which really bucks the trend of YouTube’s more frenetic and gross
  offerings. It’s also a beautiful snapshot of how rewarding it is to care for a
  rescued animal and devote your life to them. Obviously Cooking for Seamus
  bears little resemblance to other cooking shows on TV – for one thing, it’s
  doubtful that anyone would be watching this hoping to learn how to cook the
  recipes that Seamus is eating, unless they also have a bull to cook for or
  perhaps a gaggle of children happy to eat out of a trough. It’s not that the
  food looks bad (in fact, it often looks amazing) but it’s not delivered in a
  step-by-step fashion designed to instruct. Instead, Cooking for Seamus
  explores the more important side of cooking. The love that Archer, BJ and
  everyone on the show has for Seamus is palpable. As humorous as the idea of
  him being a “food critic” is, we often make food for those we love, to show
  them that we love them. And Seamus returns this love, too; my favourite shots
  are where he gratefully rests his giant head against Archer, a move
  immediately recognisable to me with my own rescue animal, a traumatised
  ex-racing greyhound named Basil. It is a nice reminder that good food doesn’t
  require frills or Michelin stars – just enough care to show our love. Cooking
  for Seamus is available to watch on YouTube. The next episode drops on 27
  August
