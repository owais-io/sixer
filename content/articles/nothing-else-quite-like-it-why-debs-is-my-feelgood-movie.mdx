  “Are you kidding me?” snaps Ms Petrie, Holland Taylor’s power-suit loving
  intelligence chief, towards the end of the 2004 spy satire DEBS. “We conduct a
  nationwide manhunt for you, and you’re boning the suspect?!” In a nutshell,
  this is the basic premise of Angela Robinson’s 2004 debut feature film, a
  critically panned box office flop which has transformed into a cult classic
  over the last 20 years thanks to its refreshing and cheery nonchalance towards
  the subject of sexuality. The heavily sanitised trailer, which erased
  virtually all evidence of a sapphic storyline, meant that DEBS passed me by
  for years. Now, I’m making up for lost time. Though DEBS is far from being the
  first film to explore queerness through the lens of a criminal caper – bank
  heist thriller Set It Off, gory noir flick Bound and David Lynch’s classic
  Mulholland Drive all beg to differ – Robinson’s take on a longstanding trope
  stands out for its distinct lack of grit or peril. It is also an outlier
  compared with other, more lighthearted lesbian films of the same era. While
  more traditional romcoms such as Imagine Me and You and Saving Face also
  attempted to shift the dial, the shame and inner turmoil of their closeted
  lead characters wrestling with forbidden desires still provided much of the
  narrative thrust. And while Jamie Babbit’s equally tongue-in-cheek But I’m a
  Cheerleader has the most obvious similarities, that satire hinged on something
  much darker and more sinister, parodying the very real harm caused by gay
  conversion practices. DEBS, on the other hand, remains strangely notable to
  this day, for simply being a silly, over-the-top, low-stakes noughties
  thriller that just so happens to have some lesbians in it. Released the year
  after Charlie’s Angels gaudy, willfully silly sequel Charlie’s Angels: Full
  Throttle, DEBS put an even campier spin on the other high-octane thrillers
  that dominated in that era. The story centres on a group of teenage spies who
  have been handpicked for a life of paramilitary espionage on the strength of
  their high school SAT scores. Much like a pack of Fame Academy hopefuls, the
  gang live all together in a sorority-styled house and fight against organised
  crime, all while wearing tiny plaid skirts that help them to resemble extras
  from Britney Spears’s Baby One More Time music video. Their
  commander-in-chief, Ms Petrie, turns up frequently as a hologram to deliver
  classified briefings in the middle of the school canteen. Dominique, played by
  Devon Aoki, speaks in a farcical French accent, and permanently has a
  cigarette hanging out of her mouth, and a new man in her bed. Everything is
  going smoothly enough until a new sighting of DEBS’ terrifying arch-nemesis
  Lucy Diamond – a murderous supervillain with impeccable eyebrows and a thirst
  for bloodshed. Details on her origin story are amusingly thin – a bad breakup
  and an insatiable hatred for Australia are both alluded to – but one thing is
  even clearer than the girls’ super-reflective lip gloss: she must be stopped.
  And who better to defeat her than DEBS’ resident goody-two shoes, Amy Bradshaw
  – who is writing an entire thesis delving into Lucy Diamond’s warped inner
  psyche. There’s just one problem – Amy isn’t just concealing state secrets.
  She’s also lying to herself about who she really is, though the tofu scramble
  she orders for breakfast is a brilliantly on-the-nose hint about where things
  are headed. Once Amy learns that Lucy is into women after a failed stakeout of
  her terrible blind date with Russian assassin Ninotchka Kaprova, her
  fascination with the enemy only builds. Ultimately, our hero and villain end
  up running away together, faking Amy’s kidnap in order to head off on an
  extended romantic romp. While her friends obviously feel betrayed at first –
  her fellow DEB Janet scathingly labels her a “gay slut” after uncovering the
  scheme – they ultimately conspire against the government to help them flee and
  find happiness. Amy’s journey of self-discovery may come about through highly
  unusual means, but her coming-out story is a largely joyful one, and her
  sexuality is barely a source of plot tension. Though it’s certainly possible
  to read Amy’s propensity for lying as a deeper metaphor for concealed
  queerness, doing so would probably mean taking DEBS far too seriously. Here,
  things are simply not that deep, and 20 years on from its release, there’s
  still nothing else quite like it. DEBS is available to watch on the Criterion
  Channel in the US and to rent digitally in the UK and Australia
