  Merseyside police are investigating an allegation that the Bournemouth forward
  Antoine Semenyo was racially abused during his team’s defeat at Liverpool.
  Semenyo reported being racially abused by a Liverpool fan at Anfield, and a
  man in a wheelchair was escorted out of the stadium at half-time by three
  police officers. Liverpool’s head coach, Arne Slot, was incensed that the
  incident had detracted from a night of emotional tributes to the late Diogo
  Jota and his brother, André Silva, who were killed in a car accident in July.
  Slot went to console Semenyo immediately after Liverpool’s dramatic 4-2
  victory. A statement from Liverpool read: “Liverpool Football Club is aware of
  an allegation of racist abuse made during our Premier League game against AFC
  Bournemouth. We condemn racism and discrimination in all forms, it has no
  place in society or football. The club is unable to comment further as
  tonight’s alleged incident is the subject of an ongoing police investigation,
  which we will support fully.” Andoni Iraola, the Bournemouth head coach, said
  Semenyo was upset after the game but praised the Ghana international for
  maintaining his composure and scoring two fine goals at Anfield to draw the
  visitors level. “It’s a shame that in the first game of the Premier League
  season, with two teams playing a really good game, we have to be talking about
  something that should be in the past but is not in the past,” said Iraola. “It
  is something that is still a big problem. Antoine was calm in the heat of the
  moment. We asked him if he could continue and he was composed but he is asking
  why these things are happening today? It is a shame.” Semenyo later shared
  another racist message he had received on his Instagram account, accompanied
  by the message: “When will it stop......” Slot said the night should have been
  all about the emotional tributes to Jota, which left Mohamed Salah in tears
  after the game, and Liverpool’s thrilling victory. “It is unacceptable in any
  stadium, especially Anfield,” said the Liverpool head coach. “It shouldn’t
  happen but unfortunately we definitely have to talk about it. It should be
  about Diogo and how the tributes were. I spoke to Antoine after the game and
  said the club will do everything we can to find the person responsible. Big
  credit to him if something happens to him and he can perform like this. He is
  not only a great player but very strong mentally. But it is unacceptable.”
