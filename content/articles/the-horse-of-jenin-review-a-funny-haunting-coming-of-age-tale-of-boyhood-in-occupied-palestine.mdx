  The Horse of Jenin review – a funny, haunting coming-of-age tale of boyhood in
  occupied Palestine 
sectionName: Stage

bodyText: >-
  This is the story of a friendship between two boys and a giant model horse.
  Because the boys are Palestinian, and the horse is stationed at a roundabout
  in Jenin in the West Bank, this is not only a coming-of-age drama but also a
  look at the brutality of the Israeli occupation, endured by Palestinian
  civilians over many decades. In this case, the civilians are best friends
  growing up amid the rubble of repeated invasions, learning to play alongside
  it. The story begins long before 7 October 2023, although it finishes here,
  when the model horse is ripped down and destroyed by an Israeli tank. In tone,
  it is bouncy, droll and warm. Underneath it buzzes with suppressed suffering
  and fear, but also resilience. Writer and comedian Alaa Shehada begins in
  standup mode, cracking jokes, engaging the audience: “My name is Alaa, not
  Allah.” It is clear this will not be a sombre lesson on the Middle East
  conflict. Shehada now lives in Amsterdam but takes us back to a rambunctious
  childhood in Jenin, moving through the decades in picaresque strides, from his
  inseparable friendship with Ahmed, who is born on the same day as him, to
  school days, a disastrous romance, and the grandfather who gives him a small
  model horse. It is, he tells us, a symbol of freedom and, years later, a
  German artist comes to the West Bank to build a five-metre horse out of the
  rubble of the 2002 Israeli invasion, after the second intifada. In the
  foreground are Shehada’s exuberant tales of the 1990s and 00s. In the backdrop
  hover soldiers with automatic firearms at checkpoints, tanks flattening homes,
  rockets firing at ambulances, killing celebrated doctors. The parallels from
  then to now are appalling in their never-ending violent circularity. Artfully
  directed by Katrien van Beurden and Thomas van Ouwerkerk, the production is
  one of a number of Palestinian stories at this year’s fringe including My Name
  Is Rachel Corrie, Nowhere and Balfour Reparations. Shehada is very funny and
  full of energy, mixing English with Arabic, using commedia dell’arte masks and
  mime in funny and haunting ways, taking wry snipes at western media searches
  for tragic stories in the region. It builds to a gut-punch, although there is
  no self-pity or sentimentality. This is a production that chooses to find joy
  amid horror. Alaa’s friendship with Ahmed, in its innocence and loss, is
  deeply moving. And how can anyone fail to feel the resonance of this amid
  reports – rejected by the IDF – that the Israeli army is shooting at children?
  All that is left, in such abject circumstances, is storytelling – and Shehada
  knows it power. At Pleasance Dome, Edinburgh until 25 August. All our
  Edinburgh festival reviews
