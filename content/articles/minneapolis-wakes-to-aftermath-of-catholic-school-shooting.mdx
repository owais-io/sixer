  Minneapolis woke on Thursday to the aftermath of the mass shooting at a
  Catholic school in which two children were killed and 17 people injured,
  stunning the close-knit community and prompting the FBI to investigate the act
  as domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics. A shooter at the
  Annunciation Catholic school in the south of the city killed two children,
  aged eight and 10, in church pews during morning mass. Fourteen other
  children, aged six to 15, were injured, two of them critically, though
  officials said they were expected to survive. Police said the suspect, Robin
  Westman, 23, killed themself and was found dead behind the church. Online
  posts indicate that Westman’s mother worked at the church until 2021. The
  Minneapolis police chief, Brian O’Hara, told Minneapolis ABC affiliate KSTP
  that his office believes Westman had been a student at Annunciation. “This was
  a deliberate act of violence against innocent children and other people
  worshipping,”O’Hara said in a news conference on Wednesday. “The sheer cruelty
  and cowardice of firing into a church full of children is absolutely
  incomprehensible. Department of Homeland security secretary Kristi Noem called
  Westman a “deranged monster” in a statement later on Wednesday. “This level of
  violence is unthinkable. Our deepest prayers are with the children, parents,
  families, educators, and Christians everywhere. We mourn with them, we pray
  for healing, and we will never forget them,” Noem said. He said the incident
  took place just before 8.30am during a service marking the first week of
  school. The pews had been packed with teachers, parents and children listening
  to a psalm. Just before the congregants were to proclaim “Alleluia”, bullets
  were fired through the windows. “Down! Everybody down!” someone shouted as
  children ducked for cover behind wooden pews. One student threw himself on top
  of a friend and was shot in the back. A youth minister called her husband to
  say goodbye. People used a wooden plank to barricade a door and fled to a
  gymnasium. The shooting went on for several minutes, according to a man who
  lives near the church and said he heard as many as 50 shots. Dozens of law
  enforcement officers soon arrived at the school. The three injured adults were
  parishioners in their 80s, officials said. Many knew each other well in a
  community that is built around the century-old Catholic school and parish, a
  suburb better described as a small town. “I’m just asking [God]: ‘Why right
  now?’ It’s little kids,” said Aubrey Pannhoff, 16, a student at a nearby
  Catholic school who stood at the edge of the police cordon. Pope Leo XIV, who
  is American, said he was praying for the families of those killed and injured
  in the “terrible tragedy”. Westman grew up in Richfield, and applied in Dakota
  county to change their birth name from Robert to Robin Westman because they
  identified as a woman, according to court documents obtained by the Guardian.
  That request was granted in January 2020. A rifle, a shotgun and a pistol had
  been lawfully bought by the shooter recently, O’Hara said, adding it was
  believed they acted alone. He said Westman had scheduled a manifesto to be
  released on YouTube. The police said it “appeared to show him at the scene and
  included some disturbing writings”. The content had been taken down with the
  assistance of the FBI, he added. The videos were rambling, often showed
  writings in Russian, and contained a variety of references to things ranging
  from Donald Trump to antisemitic statements to gun rights. No motive for the
  attack has emerged. At a briefing, Minneapolis’s mayor, Jacob Frey, said:
  “Children are dead. There are families that have a deceased child … Don’t just
  say this is about thoughts and prayers right now. These kids were literally
  praying. It was the first week of school. They were in a church.” Later, Frey
  added: “Anybody who is using this as an opportunity to villainize our trans
  community has lost their sense of common humanity,” he said. “We should not be
  operating from a place of hate for anyone. We should be operating from a place
  of love for our kids. This is about them.” One of the documented victims in
  the shooting is 12-year-old Sophia Forchas, who “was shot during the attack
  and is currently in critical condition in the ICU”, per a GoFundMe that was
  set up for family to help with “ongoing ICU care, future surgeries, trauma
  counseling, lost income, travel, and the countless unknowns that lie ahead”.
  The GoFundMe notes that Forchas’s younger brother was also inside the school
  during the shooting and her mother, a pediatric critical care nurse, went to
  work to help during the tragedy, not knowing her daughter was critically
  injured. Associated Press contributed reporting
