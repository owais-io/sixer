  New season. New stuff. New camera angles. Director: “And cut to Ref Cam.”
  Suddenly we are transported from the gliding calm of a wide angle to GoldenEye
  on the Nintendo 64, except you are not James Bond, you are Simon Hooper
  peering up at a strange angle of Harvey Barnes. Stop looking around Simon,
  stand still Simon. As one correspondent to Guardian Football Weekly suggested,
  it’s the Professional Game Match Officials’ tribute to Uncut Gems. New season
  – wildly terrible predictions. My Premier League winners Manchester City won
  the title at Wolves on the opening weekend but are now sensationally out of
  the race after being outplayed by Spurs. Not sure anyone predicted Nuno
  Espírito Santo to be leading the sack race (nb: written before Grimsby). Who
  had Ange to lead Nottingham Forest to Europa League glory? New season – the
  constants that remind you that football never changes. Manchester United
  without a win – GRIMSBY! West Ham fans streaming out long before the final
  whistle. Joelinton avoiding a booking. Bournemouth/Wolves/Fulham fans
  complaining that you haven’t talked about Bournemouth/Wolves/Fulham enough.
  Existential crises north of the border. Speaking of existential crises … New
  season – more children concurrently reminding you of your own mortality and
  lack of general life achievements. Max Dowman: maybe the first Premier League
  player born after the Soccer AM “glory years” began (I presume that’s how
  everyone measures the passing of time). A 16-year-old scoring the winner for
  Liverpool at Newcastle (long after his bedtime, etc). Rio Ngumoha is 17 on
  Friday. You’re 16 until you’re 17. Happy birthday, Rio. New season – new
  directives from the PGMO. Oh, here we go, don’t spend too long on this one.
  Could holding in the box be the new handball? The thing that has us yelling at
  clouds. “I just don’t know the rules any more.” “This isn’t why people fell in
  love with the game.” Now the refs are mic’d up, it feels more NFL than ever.
  “Holding, No 3 on the DE-FENSE, penalty Manchester United.” Before the season,
  the head of the PGMO, Howard Webb, said: “If you get one of those situations
  where one player is clearly dragging another one to the floor in an extreme
  non-football action, even if it’s off the ball, we expect the referee to see
  it … If it’s a clear one, then the VAR will intervene and recommend the
  referee looks at it at the screen because it fits the criteria that we’ve laid
  out. An extreme non-footballing action which prevents an opponent from
  moving.” So we have Calvin Bassey v Mason Mount. Bassey very much the senior
  wrestler – the Ultimate Warrior, with Mount in the Barry Horowitz role. Mount
  commits himself and Bassey just rolls him, forgetting to pin him for the
  intercontinental title. Surprisingly Chris Kavanagh wasn’t knocked out by a
  chair by Sander Berge before giving the penalty. According to the laws, it is
  a penalty. But as many have pointed out, Luke Shaw is attempting a figure-four
  leg lock on Rodrigo Muniz at the same time. And then in the second half, Leny
  Yoro gets away with pushing Bassey in the back before heading the ball off
  Muniz and into the net. According to the VAR the level of contact “wasn’t
  impactful”. Now whether you think United taking the lead at Craven Cottage is
  impactful is a broader question. Perhaps not in the context of a universe that
  has existed for 13.7bn years, but it did have the impact of Bassey not being
  able to head the ball, giving Yoro a free header and United a goal. Perhaps
  the PGMO is thinking more deeply than the rest of us. So here is yet another
  imbalance weighted against defenders in the Premier League. Already they have
  to spend most of their time with their hands behind their back, defending
  against attackers who can move theirs around freely in all the natural
  positions arms go in. And now attackers can push defenders around with
  relative impunity. It has obviously always been the case that a defender risks
  more by pushing an attacker in the box than the other way round. If Mount
  pushes Bassey over (good luck with that, Mason), he might get away with it,
  and if he doesn’t, Fulham get a free-kick in their own box. The other way
  round, as happened on Sunday, and it’s a penalty. Rob Green explained
  excellently on the all-new (same) Match of the Day that Mount has no interest
  in winning the ball. He is just trying to stop Bassey – back to the NFL again
  – and blocking doesn’t feel too far away from a non-footballing action. You
  have to feel for the officials, because this is virtually impossible to police
  with any sort of consistency. Attackers can barge into defenders, create space
  for their teammates to get a free header, maybe get a penalty if they’re
  lucky, while defenders have to fend off the opposition running into them,
  without fending off the opposition running into them. And so much is happening
  in the penalty area that sometimes they’ll be given and sometimes they won’t.
  The extra scrutiny means there is a risk of more delays and more penalties.
  And we don’t need more penalties. Football is the best sport because goals are
  rare. More goals doesn’t make it better, especially penalties. The solution is
  to give the defence the advantage. If the VAR is staring at a crowded penalty
  area at a set piece, then if any defender is being fouled, regardless of the
  wrestling elsewhere, the free-kick goes in their favour. So a new season, a
  new directive to get confused about. Let’s hope it’s not as impactful as a
  two-handed shove in the back, however impactful that is. On Thursday 11
  September, join Max Rushden, Barry Glendenning and newly announced panellists:
