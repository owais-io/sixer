  Australia’s largest superannuation fund has divested more than $26m of shares
  in poker machine giant Aristocrat from its “socially aware” option, after
  sustained criticism of its support for the gambling industry. The decision was
  made after a review of investments to ensure the fund was meeting the
  expectations of its ethically minded members. On Wednesday AustralianSuper
  confirmed its socially aware option had a higher percentage of overall
  investments in Aristocrat than its default balanced fund as of 31 December.
  The socially aware fund held $26.8m of Aristocrat shares, with a portfolio
  weighting of 0.61%. In June 2023, the weighting was 0.61%. But on Friday,
  AustralianSuper confirmed the socially aware fund no longer held any shares in
  the poker machine giant. AustralianSuper has confirmed the shares have been
  sold, rather than allocated to other funds. AustralianSuper said the decision
  was made to “better meet member expectations”. Previously, the socially aware
  fund only excluded the tobacco industry. It has now banned investments in
  companies linked to gambling, nuclear weapons, animal welfare concerns and
  palm oil. As part of new screening rules, the socially aware fund will not
  invest in companies that generate more than 5% of revenue from the gambling
  industry. This includes companies that “license their brand name to gambling
  products”. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Despite this change,
  AustralianSuper’s default balanced fund, according to latest disclosures,
  holds $1.74bn of shares in Aristocrat. In June 2022, this option held $920m in
  Aristocrat shares. These shares account for 0.73% of the default fund’s
  overall listed investments, up from 0.54% in June 2023. An AustralianSuper
  spokesperson said the fund was continuing to review Aristocrat’s “initiatives
  in responsible gambling”. In recent months, AustralianSuper had been
  increasing its holdings in Aristocrat. The company’s latest disclosures showed
  the fund held more than 7% of the company’s shares. In June 2022, the fund
  held 5.05% of Aristocrat’s shares. It was not yet clear how the divestment
  announced on Friday would change that percentage. Before the announcement, an
  Aristocrat spokesperson said the company offered legal products in a highly
  regulated industry with risk management processes. “We’re striving to
  continuously improve our sustainability performance, in line with our focus on
  long-term business performance, the expectations of our stakeholders and our
  company values,” the spokesperson said. AustralianSuper is not the only fund
  to have increased investments in Aristocrat, despite sustained warnings of
  rising gambling harm across the country. Australian Retirement Trust had
  confirmed it now had about $226m in Aristocrat shares in its default balanced
  fund, which was described as “a modest increase over time”. UniSuper’s
  holdings in Aristocrat had increased from $139m in June 2022 to $283m. The
  super fund described the increase as a combination of the share price rising
  and “an increase in funds under management in UniSuper’s balanced option”. The
  value of Aristocrat shares in Aware Super’s default fund had increased from
  $273m to $292m since June 2023, according to latest disclosures. A
  spokesperson for the fund said its overall shares in Aristocrat had decreased
  during this period. The Morningstar Sustainalytics executive director,
  Michelle Cameron, said Aristocrat was “a high-performing business averaging
  7.8% net income margin over recent years, outperforming the industry average”.
  “From an investor perspective it has a strong balance sheet with a history of
  positive returns, yet its core business in gambling is ethically highly
  debated and contentious from a social harm perspective,” Cameron said. “This
  is the dilemma for super funds as they balance strong financial returns.” The
  Alliance for Gambling Reform’s chief executive, Martin Thomas, said
  AustralianSuper’s divestment from its socially aware fund was “highly
  significant”. “While the numbers are slight in comparison to its overall
  investment, the recognition from our largest superannuation fund that gambling
  stocks are not an appropriate investment in an ethically minded fund is highly
  significant,” Thomas said. “We believe that any ethical investor should divest
  themselves of gambling stocks. It appears bizarre and shortsighted that
  investors divest themselves from oil and gas stocks but go all in on gambling
  stocks.” Gamblers in New South Wales lost $2.17bn to poker machines in the
  first 90 days of this year. This equates to an average of $1m an hour to poker
  machines across the state, or more than $24m every day. Last month, a report
  commissioned by the Victorian government found the social cost of gambling in
  the state had doubled – from $7bn in 2014-15 to $14bn in 2022-23 – despite
  fewer people gambling. • In Australia, Gambling Help Online is available on
