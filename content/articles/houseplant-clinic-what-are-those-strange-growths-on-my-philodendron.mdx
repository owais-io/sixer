  What’s the problem? My philodendron has long, white, string-like growths
  coming out of the stems. Is my plant OK and can I cut them off? Diagnosis
  These curious structures are known as aerial roots, and are completely
  natural. Philodendrons originate from tropical rainforests, where they climb
  trees. These aerial roots help it anchor itself, absorb moisture and draw
  nutrients directly from the humid air. Indoors, however, they can give the
  plant a slightly wild appearance. Prescription There’s no need for any concern
  or immediate action. Aerial roots are a sign of a healthy plant. If you find
  them visually unappealing, gently guide the roots on to a support, such as a
  moss pole or bamboo stake, to encourage your plant to climb. This helps it
  develop larger leaves and gives it an attractive shape. If you prefer to trim,
  use clean, sharp scissors to avoid damage or introducing infections.
  Prevention There’s no need to prevent aerial root growth, but providing your
  plant with adequate support will keep it looking neat and encourage lush
  foliage. Got a plant dilemma? Email saturday@theguardian.com with ‘Houseplant
