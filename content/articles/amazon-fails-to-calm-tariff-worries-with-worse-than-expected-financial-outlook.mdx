  Amazon failed to quiet concerns over how Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs would
  affect its e-commerce business as it reported its latest quarterly results on
  Thursday. Wall Street’s affinity for the tech giant faltered in response. The
  top line numbers from Amazon’s second quarter earnings report exceeded Wall
  Street’s projections. The tech company beat expectations with its revenue up
  13.3% year over year to $167.7bn. Market experts had estimated the company
  would report around $162bn in revenue and 9% percent growth. The company’s
  Amazon Web Services cloud computing division reported its sales reached
  $30.9bn in an increase of 17.5% year over year. However, the company may not
  meet expectations on its operating income, reporting that it would bring in
  between $15.5bn and $20.5bn compared with expectations of about $19.4bn.
  Despite the generally positive revenue numbers, Amazon’s share price fell over
  3% in after hours trading, a sign investors lacked confidence in the company’s
  immediate future. Amazon’s stock was up about 6% so far this year before
  Thursday’s earnings call, following a rough first quarter that saw a decline
  due to uncertainty around how Trump’s tariffs would hurt its reliance on
  international sellers. The administration also criticized Amazon in April
  following a report that the company planned to itemize tariff-related price
  increases on its platform. No such itemization appeared on Amazon’s
  marketplace. Amazon’s earnings come as the company is engaged in big tech’s
  fevered spending race to dominate the artificial intelligence market.
  Companies including Google, Meta and Microsoft are pledging to spend tens of
  billions to advance the technology, while Amazon announced it would spend
  $100bn in 2025 with the “vast majority” of that going towards enhancing its AI
  capabilities. The company’s CEO, Andy Jassy, touted Amazon’s AI investments in
  an earnings press release, claiming that it had deeply integrated AI services
  into many of its products and operations. “Our AI progress across the board
  continues to improve our customer experiences, speed of innovation,
  operational efficiency, and business growth, and I’m excited for what lies
  ahead,” Jassy said. Amazon has invested billions of dollars into huge
  datacenters to power its Amazon Web Services cloud business and expand its use
  of generative AI. In June, it announced a plan to spend $20bn building two
  facilities in Pennsylvania. Governor Josh Shapiro described it as the largest
  private sector investment in the state’s history. Another Amazon facility in
  Indiana, the company’s biggest yet, stretches over 1,200 acres of land and is
  set to host at least 30 datacenters. The e-commerce giant has partnered with
  Anthropic, one of the biggest artificial intelligence startups to emerge from
  the recent boom, to increase its stature in the AI world and integrate the
  technology into its variety of services. Amazon has already invested $8bn in
  the AI company and may make another multibillion-dollar investment soon,
  according to a Financial Times report from this month. Amazon also struck a
  deal earlier this year with the New York Times to use some of their content
  for AI training purposes or for generating summaries with its products such as
  Alexa, with the Wall Street Journal reporting this week that the tech company
  would pay between $20m and $25m a year for the licensing rights.
