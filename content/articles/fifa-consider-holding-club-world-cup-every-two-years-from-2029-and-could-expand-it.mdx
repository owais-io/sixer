  Fifa will consider holding the Club World Cup every two years from 2029 in a
  move that would put more pressure on the international calendar and trigger
  another backlash from the Premier League and Uefa. The next Club World Cup is
  due to take place in four years’ time, following the first expanded 32-team
  tournament held in the US this summer, but the world governing body is under
  pressure from leading clubs to make it a biennial event. Real Madrid are
  understood to have raised the issue of moving to a two-year cycle during talks
  with Fifa in Miami in June, a proposal that has gained support from other
  clubs who failed to qualify for this year’s tournament, including Barcelona,
  Manchester United, Liverpool and Napoli. Chelsea received £85m in prize money
  for winning the competition and other big European clubs want the opportunity
  to take advantage of Fifa’s huge revenue streams, which are being funded
  largely by Saudi Arabia’s Surj Sports Investments. Liverpool in particular
  were unfortunate not to take part this year, as they met one of the qualifying
  criteria by being among the top eight ranked clubs in Europe, but missed out
  as Fifa opted to admit a maximum of two sides from a country. Chelsea and
  Manchester City took the English slots as recent Champions League winners.
  There is an exception to the limit if more than two clubs from a country win
  their continental competition during the qualifying period, as was the case
  with Brazil this year. Fifa sources said that while there is no serious
  consideration being given to staging the Club World Cup in 2027, the situation
  is likely to change after 2029, with the prospect of another tournament being
  held in 2031 to be explored. Fifa’s hands are tied in the short-term as the
  international match calendar is fixed until 2030, with only the 2029 Club
  World Cup in the schedule, as part of a memorandum of understanding signed
  between Fifa and the European Clubs Association two years ago. With Fifa
  already facing legal action from World Leagues, an international lobby group
  that includes the Premier League, there is no appetite to inflame it further
  by ripping up the current schedule. World Leagues has filed a legal complaint
  to the European Commission with support from the global players’ union Fifpro,
  accusing Fifa of “abuse of dominance” for allegedly failing to consult them
  over the scheduling of the Club World Cup. Staging the new competition every
  two years would increase tensions still further, but there is an
  acknowledgement on both sides that the entire global calendar after 2030 is
  open for negotiation. As part of a quid pro quo for moving into the club game,
  sources have indicated that Fifa may be willing to remove the June
  international break to ease player workloads and create space for events such
  as the Club World Cup, although that would be opposed by Uefa, which uses
  summer dates to stage the finals of its Nations League competition. In a
  pre-season address last week the Premier League chief executive, Richard
  Masters, outlined his concerns with expanding the Club World Cup, although the
  biggest top-flight clubs appear to disagree. “Fifa was put on earth really to
  regulate the global game and to run international football, and the Club World
  Cup is a move into club football,” Masters said. “The leagues and the players
  have not been consulted at all on the timing and scheduling of the
  competition, and I think whatever iteration of it may come next, we do need to
  be consulted on that. “Obviously, it does have an impact on the scheduling of
  the Premier League season, that much is clear. We’re asking for a seat at the
  table, a proper discussion for the leagues.” Fifa is the process of reviewing
  the qualifying criteria for the 2029 Club World Cup and may lift the cap of
  two clubs per country, and as previously reported by the Guardian it is
  consulting on whether to increase the number of teams involved from 32 to 48.
  The men’s World Cup next year and the 2031 Women’s World Cup will involve 48
  teams for the first time, so expanding the Club World Cup would be consistent
  with Fifa’s tournament model. Having awarded hosting rights to this year’s
  competition to the US without inviting tenders, Fifa is planning to run formal
  bidding process for future tournaments. Qatar, Spain and Morocco have all
  expressed interest in staging the 2029 Club World Cup, with details of the
  tender process expected later this year.
