  The Canadian province of Alberta says it will temporarily pause its
  controversial book ban “to ensure that our classic literary works remain in
  school libraries” after novels, including several warning of dystopian
  government overreach, were pulled from shelves. Premier Danielle Smith said
  the temporary pause would allow officials time to rework new rules that focus
  on how gender identity, sexual orientation or human sexuality are discussed in
  classrooms. “It’ll be paused for a couple of hours while the ministerial order
  is rewritten,” she told reporters on Tuesday afternoon. “The direction will be
  to take books with pornographic images out of the libraries and to leave the
  classics alone. I think that there was some misunderstanding of the order, so
  it’s being made clear.” The rules, set to go into effect on 1 October, reflect
  a lobbying success by socially conservative “parents’ rights” groups in the
  province and mirrors a trend in the United States. But the ambiguity over what
  constitutes “explicit sexual content” has also provoked protest from school
  boards. Highlighting what it felt were inconsistencies in the new rules,
  Edmonton’s school board drew up a list of more than 200 books it said must be
  removed from library shelves in order to comply with the ministerial order.
  Among those books were dystopian classics such as The Handmaid’s Tale by
  Margaret Atwood, 1984 by George Orwell and Brave New World by Aldous Huxley.
  The Color Purple by Alice Walker and I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings by Maya
  Angelou were also targeted, as were Jaws by Peter Benchley and It by Stephen
  King. Atwood, whose book was turned into a critically acclaimed television
  series, mocked the ban on social media, posting a short story that critiqued
  the heavy-handed approach by the province. “I’m due to be in Calgary, Alberta,
  in November. That should be fun,” she wrote on Substack. “Especially since
  Albertans are per capita the top readers in Canada, and last time I looked
  they were pretty independent-minded. I expect they will have a few things to
  say. On Tuesday, Alberta’s education and childcare minister, Demetrios
  Nicolaides, told board officials to pause any restrictions on books “until
  further notice” and said more information would be sent to schools shortly.
  Premier Smith, who previously said the move was never about “banning books”,
  has complained that school boards were using “vicious compliance” to protest
  the rule and pulling books that should remain on shelves. “I’m going to be
  more explicit than usual so there is no misunderstanding this policy,” Smith
  wrote on X on Tuesday. “1. Get graphic pornographic images out of school
  libraries. 2. Leave the classics on the shelves. 3. We all know the difference
  between the items in 1 and 2. Let’s not play any more games in implementing
  this policy for our kids.”
