  A shellshocked Ruben Amorim apologised to fans and questioned his players’
  desire, saying they “spoke really loud about what they want” after Grimsby’s
  penalty shootout win dumped Manchester United out of the Carabao Cup. United
  trailed 2-0 at the break following goals from Charles Vernam and Tyrell
  Warren. The panicked visitors forced penalties via Bryan Mbeumo’s 75th-minute
  strike and Harry Maguire’s header 60 seconds from the end. But when Mbeumo
  missed his second kick and 26th of the tie‑breaker United had lost against
  fourth-tier opposition for the first time in the competition, 12‑11 on
  penalties. Amorim was clear the defeat has to be the nadir. “I think this is a
  little bit the limit,” he said. “Something has to change. In this moment, we
  need to focus on the weekend and then we have time to think. “Everything [was
  wrong]. The way we started the game, we were not even here. When everything is
  so important in our club, everything that happened – it’s a problem in our
  club. We should do so much better. I just have to say sorry to our fans. I
  felt my players spoke really loud today about what they want.” Amorim was
  asked to expand on the last comment. “I think it’s easy for you [to know],”
  the head coach said. “Let’s focus on the next game and then we have the stop
  for the international games. We will think things through. I think football
  was really fair today. The best team won.” Amorim was asked if he could
  believe what had been witnessed. “No, but I’m the manager,” the Portuguese
  said. “It should be my job to understand what happened. Again, I’m really
  sorry for our fans. Let’s focus on the next game.” Last season United finished
  in a record Premier League low 15th. Amorim admitted that his side has not
  improved. “That is more than a result. That is the biggest problem in the
  team. I think it was really clear today. I would like to say very smart things
  and very important things but I have nothing to say. “This is the biggest
  problem also – to see the same mistakes. I’m really sorry for our fans. It’s
  too much sometimes. You cannot change so much – you cannot change everything
  in one summer. You need to win games. You need to not show this kind of
  performance. “At half-time, I said: ‘We have 45 minutes to try to win the
  game.’ In the first half, I told them that they were speaking really loud to
  me – I understand what you are doing, what I am seeing. Let’s try to change
  that in the last 45 minutes.”
