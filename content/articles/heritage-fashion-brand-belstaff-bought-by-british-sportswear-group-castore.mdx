  Belstaff, the struggling British fashion brand known for its heritage
  motorcycle gear, has been bought by the sportswear group Castore from the
  billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s Ineos. Under the deal, the terms of which have
  not been disclosed, Ineos will make a “significant strategic investment” in
  Castore’s holding company. Belstaff has reported losses every year since it
  was bought by Ratcliffe’s oil and chemicals empire in 2017, with the most
  recent published accounts showing a pre-tax loss of £18.3m in the year to
  December 2023. Sales fell 3.6% to £57.6m, according to accounts filed at
  Companies House. Belstaff was founded in 1924 in Stoke-on-Trent,
  Staffordshire, and is known for its waxed jackets once promoted by Kate Moss
  and David Beckham. It was bought by Ineos in 2017 from JAB Holding, the German
  investment firm which owns the British coffee shop chain Pret a Manger and
  previously owned the luxury footwear brand Jimmy Choo. Ratcliffe, who has a
  net worth of £17bn, according to this year’s Sunday Times Rich List, became
  one of Britain’s wealthiest men after building a chemicals empire from the
  £84m purchase of a Belgian oil refinery in 1998. However, he has faced growing
  concerns over the state of his heavily-indebted, loss-making chemicals group,
  alongside other business interests including the Premier League strugglers
  Manchester United. Tom Beahon, the co-founder and chief executive of Castore,
  whose backers include the British tennis player Andy Murray, said Belstaff had
  returned to operating profit, which doesn’t include certain costs, in 2023.
  “Belstaff is a truly iconic brand with unparalleled heritage, and I have
  personally been a huge fan for a very long time,” he said. “Ineos and the
  management team at Belstaff have done a phenomenal job in steering the company
  back to profitability following a challenging period for the retail sector. To
  have the opportunity to take Belstaff through the next stage of its growth
  journey is a dream come true and a huge privilege. “We are also delighted that
  Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s Ineos is investing in Castore, which is a demonstration of
  commitment to our business and global growth ambitions, and we look forward to
  working together to deliver on this vision.” Ashley Reed, the chair of
  Belstaff, said: “Castore is disrupting the sportswear market and has
  demonstrated phenomenal growth and resilience in recent years. Having
  witnessed their journey, we saw a unique opportunity to join forces and
  accelerate Belstaff’s transformation through shared knowledge and resources.”
  The companies said Castore aimed to drive Belstaff’s growth using its online
  retail networks and expertise and supply chain. Founded in Liverpool in 2015
  by the brothers Tom and Phil Beahon, Castore is now based in Manchester and
  has grown rapidly. In 2024 it acquired the professional team sports licence
  for Umbro for key markets including the UK, Germany, Austria, Switzerland,
  Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark.
