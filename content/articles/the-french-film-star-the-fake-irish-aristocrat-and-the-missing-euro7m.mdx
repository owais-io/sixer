  One of France’s most popular actors will have a starring role in court when a
  fake Irish aristocrat goes on trial accused of cheating him out of millions of
  euros. Dany Boon, director and star of Bienvenue chez les Ch’tis (Welcome to
  the Sticks), France’s biggest box office hit, says an alleged conman, who
  claimed to be an Oxford-educated maritime lawyer, stole nearly €7m (£6m) from
  him as part of an elaborate scam. Next month, the court in Nice will seek to
  unpick a bizarre and convoluted story that could have come straight out of one
  of Boon’s movies, featuring luxury yachts, tax havens, multiple aliases, royal
  connections and an international manhunt. The man Boon says he knew as Terry
  Birles – whose real name is Thierry Fialek-Birles – reportedly appeared
  completely at home when he dined at the Royal Cork Yacht Club in November
  2021. Fellow sailing enthusiasts told the Irish Independent the smooth-talking
  and smartly dressed young man in his 30s came across as cultured, classy and
  wealthy. He allegedly led them to believe he came from an “ancient” Irish
  family and that his parents had died in a helicopter crash in Connemara when
  he was nine. He owned two classic racing yachts and had bought a 17-bedroom
  property in Youghal, County Cork, which he was planning to restore while
  commuting between Ireland and Monaco where his girlfriend, a successful
  Chinese business executive, was an adviser for the Prince Albert of Monaco
  Foundation, he allegedly said. Several months before the dinner,
  Fialek-Birles, who claimed he had been educated in Britain and Italy and had a
  master’s degree from Oxford University, had reportedly met Boon in Monaco and
  been engaged to renovate the actor’s recently acquired yacht, Umaren, a
  21-metre vessel estimated at €3.5m. In hearings in 2022 and 2023, an Irish
  court was told the actor transferred more than €2.2m to a Dublin-registered
  company, South Seas Merchants Mariners Ltd Partnership (SSMM), which
  Fialek-Birles said had been founded by his family more than a century before,
  for the maintenance, management and insurance of Umaren. A few months later,
  Fialek-Birles is alleged to have convinced the comedian to invest €4.5m, via
  SSMM, in a scheme with the Irish Central Bank that paid 3.25% annual interest
  tax free. When a suspicious Boon – alerted by an anonymous person who claimed
  to have had dealings with the alleged conman – asked for his money back, he
  said Fialek-Birles replied that SSMM had been sold to an Italian family and he
  should sue them for his millions, it was reported. Fialek-Birles then
  apparently disappeared. Boon hired private investigators, who reportedly
  discovered the “Irish aristocrat” had at least two passports, a network of
  companies, and addresses in Paris, Roquebrune-Cap-Martin on the French
  Riviera, Monaco, on the West Indian island of St Kitts and in Guadeloupe in
  the Caribbean. In a hearing at the Dublin high court three years ago that led
  to the freezing of Fialek-Birles’s assets, Boon’s counsel, Rossa Fanning SC,
  now the Irish attorney general, said the French actor had been the victim of
  an “elaborate fraud” and had been told “lie after lie”. Fanning told the court
  one of Fialek-Birles’s network of companies turned out to be a hardware store
  in Samoa. Boon’s representatives said they had discovered that neither the
  investment scheme nor the Italian family existed and Fialek-Birles, listed as
  a municipal councillor in the Paris suburb of Le Chesnay in 2008, was believed
  to have transferred the actor’s money to offshore accounts in Panama and South
  Korea. The only online reference for one of the accused’s other aliases, is a
  “Commodore Sir Thierry Waterford-Mandeville” of the West Indies Yacht Club.
  None of the website links work, the number listed appears not to exist, and
  when the Guardian messaged the email address it was returned as address not
  known. Fialek-Birles was arrested in Panama in February 2024 after Interpol
  issued an international search notice and extradited him to France six months
  later. He initially denied the accusations, but last month applied to be
  released on bail before his trial. At the hearing he was reported as saying he
  wanted to “make amends” and repay Boon. The court refused his application. His
  trial on charges of fraud, money laundering, forgery and use of forged
  documents will begin in Nice on 26 September. It is not known if Boon, whose
  real name is Daniel Farid Hamidou and who did French voiceovers in Shark Tale
  and Frozen 2, will attend. The actor has made no comment.
