  Nineteen people, among them the four suspected gunmen, went on trial in Moscow
  on Monday over a concert hall attack that claimed 149 lives, one of the worst
  terrorist attacks in modern Russia. Four armed men from the former Soviet
  republic of Tajikistan allegedly stormed the Crocus City Hall on the outskirts
  of Moscow on 22 March last year, opening fire and then setting the building
  alight, injuring hundreds of people. Isis-K, the Islamic State affiliate
  active in central and south Asia, claimed responsibility for the attack.
  Moscow, however, has alleged – without presenting credible evidence – that the
  attack was carried out “in the interests” of Ukraine. The four suspected
  attackers and another 15 people accused of being accomplices appeared in court
  on Monday. About 30 survivors were also present. A military court opened the
  case behind closed doors, with additional hearings scheduled for later this
  week. The attack shocked Russia and was widely seen as the result of a
  catastrophic security failure, with the country’s security services distracted
  by the war in Ukraine and a crackdown on domestic anti-war dissent. In the
  weeks before the assault, western intelligence agencies had privately and
  publicly warned Moscow of “imminent plans to target large gatherings” in the
  city. But just three days before the attack, Putin dismissed the warnings as
  “an attempt to scare and intimidate our society”. Nearly half of the victims
  were killed by smoke and carbon monoxide inhalation from the fire that broke
  out, not from gunfire, the state TASS news agency reported on Sunday, citing
  case materials. The four men accused of having carried out the gruesome
  murders were identified as Saidakrami Murodali Rachabalizoda, Dalerdzhon
  Barotovich Mirzoyev, Shamsidin Fariduni and Muhammadsobir Fayzov. Human rights
  groups have criticised Russia’s treatment of the suspects, noting that when
  the men first appeared in court shortly after the attack, there were clear
  signs of torture. A video published online at the time of their arrest showed
  one of the captives – apparently in the custody of Russian military personnel
  – having his ear sliced off and forced into his mouth, while being ordered to
  eat it. The men had reportedly been living in Moscow and its surrounding
  areas, part of the roughly 1.5 million Tajik migrants who have left the
  poverty and unemployment of their home towns and villages in search of a
  better future in Russia. They were apparently then recruited and radicalised
  by Isis-K. The attack has fuelled a new wave of anti-migrant sentiment across
  Russia, with central Asian migrants increasingly being subjected to police
  searches and arrests, and in some cases, forcibly conscripted to fight for
  Russia in Ukraine. Despite overwhelming evidence that Isis-K was solely
  responsible, Russia has repeatedly sought to implicate Ukraine and the west in
  the attack. “This inhuman crime was planned and committed in the interests of
  the current leadership of Ukraine in order to destabilise the political
  situation in our country,” Russian investigators said in a statement last
  month. Kyiv has called these allegations baseless and absurd. The head of
  Russia’s FSB security service, Alexander Bortnikov, previously said that he
  “believes” the US, Britain and Ukraine were behind the attack.
