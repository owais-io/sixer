  Good morning. All eyes will be on Alaska this Friday for a peace summit aimed
  at ending the war in Ukraine. The meeting will be between Donald Trump and
  Vladimir Putin. Even more striking: Ukraine, the country under invasion and
  with parts of its territory occupied, has not been invited. But behind the
  buzz of diplomacy lies the fog of war. Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned that
  Russia is not preparing to end the conflict, but “making movements that
  indicate preparations for new offensive operations”. What exactly this new
  offensive will entail remains uncertain. But just days before the Trump-Putin
  summit, Zelenskyy admitted in a press briefing that groups of Russians
  advanced about 10km in several places, as part of their bid to seize full
  control of the Donetsk region. To understand how the upcoming summit and
  reports of fresh Russian incursions might shape the course of the war and any
  potential peace settlement, I spoke to Dan Sabbagh, the Guardian’s defence
  editor, who is reporting from the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. That’s after the
  headlines. Five big stories Immigration | More than 50,000 people have crossed
  the Channel in small boats since Keir Starmer became prime minister, official
  figures have confirmed. Gaza | Gaza is facing a new threat as diseases
  resistant to antibiotics spread across the devastated territory. Medical
  supplies are scarce and tens of thousands of people have been injured or
  weakened by malnutrition in the 22-month war. UK news | The Treasury is
  looking at ways to raise more money from inheritance tax amid growing pressure
  on the country’s finances ahead of the autumn budget, sources have told the
  Guardian. Wildfires | Almost 6,000 people have been evacuated from their homes
  in northern, central and southern Spain as wildfires continue to burn amid a
  heatwave that could bring temperatures of 44C to some parts of the country. US
  news | National guard troops arrived at their headquarters in Washington DC on
  Tuesday as Democratic mayors warned Donald Trump against expanding his law and
  order power grab in other major cities. In depth: Ukraine under pressure
  During the presidential campaign last year, Donald Trump repeatedly vowed to
  end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours of taking office. But eight months into
  his presidency, the war rages on into its fourth year. In that time, Russia
  has been building up its industrial capability. It is now manufacturing about
  100 Shahed drones a day, while ramping up missile production, especially
  Iskander ballistic missiles, which are very hard for Ukraine to intercept, Dan
  tells me. “They’ve started using these in combination and in greater numbers,”
  Dan says. “In spring, we saw more regular missile attacks on Kyiv, which
  included all-night drone raids. In one attack, dozens of people were killed.
  The biggest was in the western city of Lutsk, near a Ukrainian airbase, when
  about 700 drones came in one night. We’re seeing the Russian
  military-industrial complex grinding along, trying to win through attrition.”
  Russia started to slightly dial down its attacks on Ukrainian urban centres
  after complaints by the US, but that changed this week. And there’s more
  movement on the frontlines, with reports that raiding parties have broken
  through a few kilometres from Donetsk. “These are small, about 30 to 50
  troops, but the point is psychological: to make Americans and negotiators
  think Ukraine is in trouble,” Dan says. “Ahead of this much-hyped Trump-Putin
  summit in Alaska, the Russians are trying to create ‘facts on the ground’.”
  *** What about Ukraine’s offensive into Russia? Last year, Ukrainian forces
  crossed the border into Russia’s Kursk region in a surprise incursion that
  caught Russia off guard. “It was a big morale-boosting operation,” Dan says.
  But by the spring of this year, Russia had successfully repelled the attack.
  Reclaiming the region occurred during a crucial time: the big row between
  Trump and Zelenskyy in the Oval Office that was seen around the world. Shortly
  after that diplomatic spat, the Americans briefly withheld intelligence
  sharing, which is crucial for targeting and knowing where the enemy is, and
  paused weapons shipments for the first time. “The Russians gained a lot of
  territory in a few days. Even though both were later switched back on, a lot
  of momentum was lost,” Dan says. “So, Ukraine lost what might have been a
  bargaining chip in future negotiations.” *** What will happen at the Alaska
  peace summit? There are reports that Ukrainians only knew about the peace
  summit after it had been arranged. And they have not been invited – despite
  pleading from European leaders that Zelenskyy be at the negotiating table. The
  relationship between Trump and Zelenskyy can best be described as rocky. But
  Dan says that Trump has seemed to lose patience with Putin. He gave the
  Russian leader a 50-day deadline to agree to a Ukraine ceasefire or face US
  sanctions on oil exports, and began to threaten secondary sanctions on China
  and India for buying Russian oil. Then, Trump’s negotiator Steve Witkoff went
  to Moscow last week, and news broke that Trump would meet the Russian
  president this week. It will be the first US-Russia leadership summit since
  Joe Biden met his counterpart in Geneva in June 2021. “Trump wants the
  headline ‘I stopped the war’, but may not care what that looks like,” cautions
  Dan. “The two leaders agreed to meet in Alaska, a kind of midpoint between the
  two countries, though geopolitically nowhere. European leaders aren’t invited.
  Zelenskyy isn’t invited. This is purely bilateral and it’s Trump and Putin’s
  first face-to-face since Helsinki 2018. “The Ukrainian fear is that Russia
  will offer a ceasefire in exchange for Ukraine giving up the rest of Donetsk
  oblast, which is about 9,000 sq km, including heavily fortified cities like
  Sloviansk and Kramatorsk.” In a press briefing attended by Dan, Zelenskyy said
  that Ukraine would never accept this, because it’s strategically vital
  territory and giving it away would invite future Russian offensives. The
  region sought by Russia amounted to “about 90,000 square kilometres” of the
  country, he said. He adds that Ukraine’s counteroffer is a ceasefire on
  current frontlines, prisoner and child returns, and then talks on territory
  and security guarantees. They refuse any voluntary handover of cities Russia
  hasn’t taken. But Putin has thus far refused to meet Zelenskyy. *** What do
  ordinary Ukrainians want? Dan has been in Kyiv every August since 2022. That
  year, the city was recovering after repelling Russian attempts to seize it. In
  2023, the counteroffensive was under way but the future remained uncertain. By
  2024, after the Kursk incursion, there was renewed optimism. “There’s now a
  growing weariness. People want to see what happens with this diplomatic track,
  but no one expects a military miracle. People get very tired when there’s a
  run of missile and drone attacks, they lose sleep and real life becomes hard
  work. People are sheltering in the metro station and if you’ve got a family
  you’re thinking ‘what am I doing here?’ But when those stop the city comes
  back to life. It’s a resilient place,” Dan says. The Ukrainian people want the
  war to end – nearly everyone has lost someone or been displaced – but they
  won’t accept peace at any price, Dan added. And while there’s growing
  acceptance that Ukraine can’t reconquer all their lost territory, there’s also
  a hard line on not giving up more. What is on the mind of people in the
  country is what role Trump is going to play. “Ukrainians, particularly the
  negotiators, want to be very careful here. No one wants to alienate the US
  leader for obvious reasons. If there is a world where Trump is going to be a
  mediator, the guy who can bring Putin and Zelenskyy round the table, the guy
  who can make this a threeway summit to end the war, or at least stop the
  fighting, then in Ukraine’s view Trump can be a hero,” Dan says. “But if Trump
  is going to try to negotiate with Putin and then try to force Ukrainians to
  accept that negotiated peace, if he is less of an honest broker, then that’s
  something to fear and not something they want” The problem is no one knows
  which Trump will turn up in Alaska. What else we’ve been reading Shocking
