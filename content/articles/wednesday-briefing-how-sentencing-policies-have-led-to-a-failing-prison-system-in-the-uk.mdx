  system in the UK

  The UK’s prison system is in serious trouble. That sentence should come as no
  surprise to regular readers. But a damning independent review by former
  prisons watchdog Dame Anne Owers has revealed the whole system came close to
  total collapse on three separate occasions within a 12 month period. The
  report lays the blame squarely at the feet of successive governments. Between
  autumn 2023 and summer 2024, ministers repeatedly failed to get a grip on the
  growing crisis – so much so that experts were left wondering whether inaction
  was a political choice. Senior civil servants, fearing a total breakdown of
  the criminal justice system, kept meticulous records of key decisions and
  documents in case there was ever a public or parliamentary inquiry. In October
  2023, the government started releasing prisoners 18 days early. That number
  was soon bumped up to 35 days, and then 70. When Labour took office last year,
  one of its first acts was to announce even earlier releases for prisoners who
  have served 40% of their sentence. Despite these measures, the system is still
  buckling. Prisons are running at nearly 97.5% capacity, and this weekend could
  bring fresh pressure, with large-scale protests expected. To understand why
  prisons seem trapped in this endless loop of crisis, and what it might take to
  actually fix things, I spoke to Nick Hardwick, former chief inspector of
  prisons and current chair of Nacro (National Association for the Care and
  Resettlement of Offenders). Five big stories Gaza | An Israeli security
  cabinet meeting that had been expected to discuss Benjamin Netanyahu’s call
  for the “full occupation” of Gaza has been postponed amid mounting tensions
  over whether the plan is feasible. Immigration | YouGov has released polling
  on attitudes to immigration that shows a clear link between having hardline
  anti-immigrant views and being ignorant about the level of illegal immigration
  to the UK. Technology | Google has outlined its latest step towards artificial
  general intelligence (AGI) with a new model that allows AI systems to interact
  with a convincing simulation of the real world. Japan| The mayor of Hiroshima
  has led calls for the world’s most powerful countries to abandon nuclear
  deterrence, at a ceremony to mark 80 years since the city was destroyed by an
  American atomic bomb. Music | Terry Reid, the British musician whose soaring
  and soulful voice earned him the nickname “Superlungs”, and whose career
  intersected with the likes of the Rolling Stones and Jimmy Page, has died aged
  75. In depth: The point of prisons To really understand what’s going wrong,
  you have to ask: what are prisons actually for? According to Hardwick, prisons
  are meant to do four things. First, incapacitation: locking up people who are
  dangerous so they can’t hurt others. Second, deterrence: both general (so the
  rest of us don’t break the law) and specific (so that someone who’s been to
  prison doesn’t want to go back). Then there’s rehabilitation: the idea that
  time in prison could help someone change. And finally, punishment: not because
  it necessarily helps the offender, but because society wants to show that
  serious wrongdoing has consequences. The trouble, according to Hardwick, is
  that we’re failing on every level. “You can incapacitate people when they’re
  in prison, but most people are going to come out again, and you have to hope
  they don’t come out worse. There’s no evidence to support the idea that giving
  people longer sentences works as a deterrent,” Hardwick said. “And we know
  that it’s very difficult to rehabilitate people.” Punishment, Hardwick said,
  is the most powerful reason people support prison and it’s what lands
  politically. “Whether you’re reading the Guardian or the Telegraph, there’s
  widespread anger over certain offences and a belief that harsher punishment is
  the answer.” But the political appetite for punishment is part of the problem.
  We’ve become gluttons for punishment, to repurpose a saying – addicted to the
  performance of toughness, even when it breaks the very system it’s meant to
  uphold. *** The arithmetic of the prison crisis The report criticises what it
  calls a “salami-slicing approach” to dealing with the crisis, with politicians
  tinkering at the edges rather than addressing the core problems. That comes as
  no surprise to Hardwick. “The prison crisis was entirely predictable. I taught
  students back in 2021 that there’d be a crisis in 2023 and 2024 because the
  arithmetic was perfectly clear.” To explain why, Hardwick returns to a
  metaphor from his conversation with my colleague Archie Bland last year: think
  of a bath. “The water’s coming in at the same rate, but the outflow is being
  blocked because people aren’t being released as quickly as they were, so the
  bath fills and overflows. You have to address the basic arithmetic of the
  prison crisis: you have to stop the prison population growing faster than you
  can grow capacity.” *** The factors at play Hardwick argued the increase in
  the prison population is partly down to the increase in longer prison
  sentences. He pointed to official statistics (pdf) that show that the average
  sentence length for all types of offences has increased from 13.7 months in
  2010 to 20.9 months in 2023. There was a particularly sharp increase from 2020
  to 2023, when average sentences increased from 17.1 months to 20.9 months.
  “How we work out whether a sentence is correct is how they relate to one
  another. If you make sentences longer at the top end of the sentencing range,
  for murder or knife offences, that has a consequence of pulling all other
  sentences, including less serious offences, along with them,” Hardwick said.
  The second factor, and perhaps the most important, is that we’re recalling
  more people to prisons, Hardwick added. “Most people who leave prison are
  going to be on a licence, there are conditions they have to meet and if they
  don’t they’ll be recalled back to prison. We now recall a much higher
  proportion of people than we’re used to, not because they’ve committed an
  offence, but because they’ve broken some rule.” *** Reforms are unpopular The
  problem with the prison crisis is that many of the most effective solutions
  are politically unpopular, across the spectrum. That’s especially true of one
  of the most impactful: cutting sentencing down. Politicians, both left and
  right, talk instead about building more prisons. “But unless they do something
  about sentences, they’re going to run out of space again,” Hardwick said. What
  could have broader political resonance is the argument that £10bn of taxpayer
  money is being spent on building new prison provision and hundreds of millions
  every year on running them, despite there being no evidence that it’s
  achieving what we want it to, he said. “In any other area of public
  expenditure you would say that is crazy,” Hardwick said. “You can spend that
  money in much better ways. I’m not a prison abolitionist and I think it’s
  correct in some cases to mark society’s anger and displeasure at what’s being
  done with prison sentences. But I don’t think that should happen to such an
  extent that it does more harm than good.” What else we’ve been reading A
  hopeful read about the surge in young progressives who saw Zohran Mamdani’s
  NYC Democratic mayoral primary win as a sign that better things are possible.
  It has generated a spike in leftist policies and zeal for shoe-leather
  campaigning. Phoebe Victoire Ingabire is one of a number of political
  dissidents who are facing brutal repression for fighting for human rights. Her
  son Rémy Amahirwa writes a moving piece on the strain it has put on their
  family. Aamna As a fan of The Office I am partial to an interview with any of
  the old faces. After the show, actor Ralph Ineson says he spent 20 years
  trying to convince people he wasn’t a misogynistic Yorkshireman. Phoebe Dr
  Graeme Groom has visited Gaza 40 times. It is chilling to read his description
  of the terrible toll the war is having on children and families, alongside the
  inaction by European leaders. Aamna This piece on the magic of Allan Ahlberg’s
  stories is a trip down memory lane – I loved these books growing up and read
  them to my nieces now. Phoebe Sport Cricket | England’s attempt to regain the
  Ashes this winter will be broadcast live in the UK by TNT Sports. After
  agreeing a one-year deal over the weekend TNT now has the rights for all of
  England’s winter tours. Rugby | Wearing boots designed for men causes
  discomfort for a majority of female rugby players, according to new research
  which finds as many as 89% of them experience pain from wearing shoes not
  built for women’s feet. Football | The former Arsenal footballer Thomas Partey
  has appeared in court charged with six sexual offences. The 32-year-old was
  bailed to appear at the Old Bailey for trial later this year over allegations
  of rape and sexual assault. The front pages The Guardian has a full-width

  of an apocalypse”. The Mirror has “Epstein, the Queen and the royal box” while

  Baron The Upside A bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all bad
  Wular was once among Asia’s largest freshwater lakes. It was renowned for its
  high-quality lotus plants which sustained the livelihoods of more than 5,000
  people who harvested and sold nadru – the edible lotus stem cherished as a
  delicacy in Kashmiri households. Then, in 1992, devastating floods hit the
  region. They choked the lake bed with silt, wiping out the lotus plants and
  plunging families into poverty. In 2020, authorities began a dredging
  programme to restore the lake’s depth. More than 7.9m cubic metres of silt
  have been removed and the lotus flowers are blooming again after an absence of
  three decades. “Now that it’s back, we’re preparing dishes the way our
  grandmothers did,” said Tavir Ahmad, a chef in a Kashmir market. Sign up here
