  I’m rolling these gnocchi out of yesterday’s leftover baked potato and feeling
  rather chuffed with myself, because when you’re able to cut out a step from a
  normally scratch-cook dish such as gnocchi, it makes life easier. Crisp up the
  leftover potato skins in a pan with sea salt to enjoy as a snack, or freeze
  them for making loaded potato skins (recipe coming next week). Baked potato
  gnocchi with broad beans, pecorino and mint A great way to make
  extra-flavourful fluffy pillows of gnocchi is to make them with leftover baked
  potato. Baking the potatoes instead of boiling them reduces their moisture
  content, meaning less flour is required, which in turn results in a lighter,
  less pasty gnocchi. Leftover baked potato also saves about an hour of prep
  time. This recipe serves two, using just one leftover baked potato, which I’ve
  turned into a one-pot wonder with seasonal broad beans, feta and mint. I
  wouldn’t recommend baking a single potato just for this, not least because the
  recipe is designed to make use of leftovers. If you’d like to make it from
  scratch, plan a baked potato meal earlier in the week and make one extra.
  Otherwise, steaming is a good, efficient alternative. If you want to get
  ahead, gnocchi freeze well. Lay them flat on a tray to freeze, then transfer
  to a sealed bag or container and store for up to three months. Cook straight
  from frozen, and give them a few extra minutes to rise to the surface. As a
  wholefood chef, I use wholemeal spelt flour, which adds flavour and nutrition,
  and also helps reduce waste by retaining the bran and wheat germ. To save
  money and potential waste, instead of using an egg yolk to bind the mix, I add
  a pinch of baking powder to lighten the dough. Serves 2 For the baked potato
  gnocchi 1 medium-large cooked baked potato, flesh scooped out to yield
  200-250g 50-60g wholemeal flour (I used spelt), plus extra for dusting ½ tsp
  baking powder Salt and black pepper For the broad bean, feta and mint topping
  Juice of ½ lemon, plus the finely grated zest if organic and unwaxed 2 tbsp
  extra-virgin olive oil 2 large sprigs mint 150g broad beans (from roughly 450g
  pods), or frozen broad beans 100g feta, crumbled Put the potato flesh in a
  bowl, add the flour and baking powder, then mix and knead into a ball; if it’s
  a little sticky, add a little more flour. Split into 16 similar-sized pieces,
  then, using your hands, roll each one into the shape of a rugby ball and
  arrange in a single layer on a floured tray. Cook the gnocchi either by frying
  them in a little oil until golden brown all over, or by dropping them into
  boiling salted water for about 60 seconds, or until they float to the surface.
  Lift out, drain and serve with your favourite topping. At this time of year, I
  like to serve gnocchi with broad beans, feta and mint. In a small bowl, mix
  the lemon juice (and, if it’s organic and unwaxed, the grated zest, too) with
  the oil. Pick the leaves off the mint sprigs, then finely chop the stalks, add
  these to the dressing bowl and season generously. Blanch the broad beans in
  boiling salted water for five minutes, then lift out and drain. Meanwhile,
  cook the gnocchi either by frying them in a little oil until golden brown all
  over or by dropping them into boiling salted water for about 60 seconds, until
  they float to the surface, then lift out and drain. Stir in the blanched beans
  and dressing, garnish with the crumbled feta and the reserved mint leaves, and
  tuck in.
