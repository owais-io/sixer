  Tottenham are hopeful of signing João Palhinha on loan after opening talks
  with Bayern Munich over the Portugal midfielder. Palhinha, who joined Bayern
  from Fulham last summer in a deal worth up to £47.4m, is understood to be keen
  to return to the Premier League having rarely featured under Vincent Kompany.
  He is wanted by the new Spurs manager, Thomas Frank, to provide extra options
  in central midfield, with talks over a deal for the 30-year-old continuing. It
  appears likely Bayern will sanction Palhinha’s departure, although it remains
  to be seen whether any deal would include an option or obligation to make the
  deal permanent. Tottenham beat Arsenal 1-0 in a pre-season friendly at Hong
  Kong’s Kai Tak Stadium on Thursday in the first north London derby to be
  played overseas thanks to a long-range strike from Pape Matar Sarr. Signing
  Palhinha would undoubtedly provide much-needed experience in central midfield
  given he made almost 80 appearances in the Premier League during his two
  seasons at Fulham after joining from Sporting. Spurs have signed Mathys Tel
  from Bayern this summer for around £30m after the Frenchman spent the second
  half of last season on loan in north London. They have also added Mohammed
  Kudus from West Ham, but failed in their pursuit of Nottingham Forest’s Morgan
  Gibbs-White.
