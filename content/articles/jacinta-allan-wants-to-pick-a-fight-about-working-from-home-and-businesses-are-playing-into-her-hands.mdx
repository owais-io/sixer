  During the middle of the federal election campaign, amid relentless leaking
  about her unpopularity, claims she was dragging down Labor’s vote and whispers
  of a possible challenge to her leadership, the Victorian premier Jacinta Allan
  had a realisation. “I’ve decided I just don’t care what they think any more,”
  one of Allan’s ministers says she told them in mid-April. According to the
  minister, Allan said she was “done” second-guessing herself and looking over
  her shoulder for threats – particularly from within her own party. She said
  was going to do what she thought was right, trust her political judgment and
  block out the noise. She even began starting her day with “a few minutes of
  yoga”, the minister says. Around the same time, Allan also hired a new
  chief-of-staff and social media team, hiring those who forged a huge online
  following for the former Queensland premier Steven Miles. As the news cycle
  focused on the federal election, then the latest battle in the never-ending
  internal war within the Victorian Liberal party, Allan and her team got to
  work. The results were on show at Labor’s state conference earlier this month.
  Allan arrived to a standing ovation. The conference room at Moonee Valley
  racecourse had been primed by her deputy, Ben Carroll, and a slick
  campaign-style video ending with a slogan: “Labor is on your side”. Sign up:

  legislate the right to work from home two days a week for those who can
  reasonably do so. Ministers say the policy came directly from the premier and
  her office. The coordinating ministers’ committee of cabinet – senior
  ministers representing each government department – were only told during a
  Zoom meeting the day before. That briefing came so late that it’s likely the
  Labor-red “work-from-home works” backdrop had already been delivered to 1
  Treasury Place. How the state government will legislate this right, given
  Victoria handed its industrial relations powers to the commonwealth years ago,
  remains unclear. But this populist policy is one of Allan’s most politically
  astute moves to date – and a sharp contrast to Peter Dutton’s attempt to force
  public servants back to the office, a plan he was forced to abandon
  mid-campaign. Allan, a mother of two who works from her home in Bendigo two
  hours from Melbourne on most Fridays, understands how companies demanding a
  return to the office can create fear and uncertainty for people trying to
  balance work and family life. The policy gives her a way to connect with
  women, who often bear the brunt of that balancing act but are as a group yet
  to warm to her, party sources say. It also lets her use a trick out of former
  premier Daniel Andrews’ political playbook, another minister says. “He always
  said you have to pick a fight with someone,” they say. In her conference
  speech, Allan made her target clear: “There are plenty of bosses who will
  fight us on this … if it’s a fight they want, they’ll get it.” The backlash
  from business and property groups to the proposal was swift – but Jessie
  McCrone, a managing partner at FMRS Advisory and former senior adviser to
  Andrews, says it was likely welcomed by the government. “Good communications
  is about clarity, authenticity and repetition, and that is what Premier Allan
  has here. She’s picked an issue that has salience and combustibility – that is
  clearly something she welcomes,” McCrone says. “At the same time, the Liberals
  are in a lose-lose situation. If they talk about it, they’re basically doing
  the government’s job for them. But if they don’t talk about it, the business
  community is not going to be very happy with them.” McCrone draws similarities
  between work from home and Allan’s other signature policy of increasing
  housing density across the suburbs, which she announced late last year in
  well-heeled Brighton. “They are both targeting key voter groups and they’ve
  got the same message: ‘I’m on your side’,” McCrone says. Then, she railed
  against nimbys and boomers. Now, Allan says she’s backing “workers, especially
  women, single mums, carers” against big bosses. But unlike the housing
  announcement, which was gatecrashed by local Liberal MP James Newbury and
  angry locals, the state opposition have resisted taking the bait. The federal
  member for Goldstein, Tim Wilson, was less cautious and compared the work from
  home policy to apartheid. Even if, once legislated, the policy faces a court
  challenge – as many expect – Allan’s team is likely to frame it as another
  chance to fight for workers and yet another opportunity to talk about it. She
  has been talking about it all week: on Tuesday, she announced consultation on
  the plan was open (and as of Friday it had received more than 10,000
  responses, a number most government surveys don’t reach in months). On
  Wednesday, she stood with plumbers who said they didn’t “begrudge” those able
  to work from home, countering the argument used by Wilson and others that
  tradies would oppose the plan. On Thursday, Allan appeared with a cafe owner
  who credited people working from home for their success, countering another
  argument that it’s bad for small businesses. Several MPs, including some
  within the oppositions ranks, said she appeared more confident. This extended
  to the chamber, where the government used almost all its allotted ministerial
  statements – the state’s version of a Dorothy Dixer - to spruik the benefits
  of working from home. Some links to the policy were tenuous at best –
  including the minister for outdoor recreation, Steve Dimopoulos, saying it
  would give people “three hours back” each week to enjoy the state’s parks,
  waterways and lakes. It left the opposition and reporters alike bored – but
  they’re not the audience. As one Labor MP said: “By the time you and I are
  sick of hearing of it, that’s when we know it’s cut through to the public.” •
