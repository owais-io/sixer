  Proclamations about the inevitability of China’s dominance of the global
  economic system, or the so-called Chinese century, were made long before
  Donald Trump’s attempts to stymie its trade with the US. Common concerns about
  coercive politics and human rights aside, some notions of China as an
  unstoppable economic, technological and military behemoth sit alongside others
  focused more on an increasingly sclerotic, over- centralised political
  economy, that depends on wasteful economic stimulus, and features poor
  governance and institutions. The fusion of these notions suggests that we may
  already have reached “peak China”. At the time of the 2008 financial crisis,
  China’s official, and probably exaggerated, GDP was about $14tn (£10.4tn), or
  about a third of that of the US. By 2021, it had risen to three-quarters of
  America’s $23.7tn, and there was widespread talk about in which year of the
  2020s China would overtake the US. By 2024, however, China’s $18tn economy had
  fallen back to just over 62% of the almost $30tn of the US. In GDP per head
  terms, China is still no more than 20% of the US. A rising China uniquely
  lifted its share of global GDP between 2000 and 2021 from 3.5% to 18.5%, but
  since then it has slipped back to about 16.5%. There is no question that
  China’s rise is at least stalling. The working age and total population are
  now in relentless decline. The urbanisation rate, just over 60%, is flattening
  out. Productivity growth has stalled. The long surge in China’s share of
  global manufacturing exports and production has levelled off, and the external
  environment for China is now much harder and more hostile. A 90-day pause in
  the US-China tariff war was extended for a further 90 days on Monday night.
  Part of the problem is that China has reached the end of extrapolation. The
  past really is another country. Some of its growth engines could only ever
  fire once: for example, enrolling children in primary and secondary schools;
  improving basic healthcare; reaping the demographic dividend of falling
  dependency rates; and moving people from the countryside to
  higher-productivity, urban jobs. Some growth also flowed from a number of
  highly effective policy initiatives such as those captured by the era of
  reform and opening-up, inspired by Deng Xiaoping: joining the World Trade
  Organization; creating a genuine market in housing, and exploiting
  globalisation. None of these can happen again. China’s growth model, moreover,
  based on unrealistically high growth targets and uniquely high investment and
  savings rates, is becoming swamped by stagnant productivity, debt service
  difficulties and misallocation of capital. At the Central Economic Work
  Conference in December last year, China’s premier, Li Qiang, summarised his
  country’s condition by saying candidly that the foundation for sustained
  economic recovery and growth was not strong, demand was weak, and there were
  pressures on job creation and “fiscal difficulties” among several local
  governments. Although consumption has been made a top priority, actual policy
  measures to make it so have been underwhelming, partly because redistributing
  economic power to companies and citizens also entails changes in political
  power, which are anathema to the Communist party. The structural downturn in
  the property sector, which at one stage accounted for more than a quarter of
  the economy, is likely to shrink for the foreseeable future, dogged by lower
  rates of household formation and smaller cohorts of first-time buyers, linked
  to demographics as well as a chronic oversupply of unsold and uncompleted real
  estate. The government has softened its approach to private enterprises and
  approved a new private economy promotion law to bolster AI, technology
  clusters and hubs, and reduce regulatory barriers. Low business confidence,
  though, is not really about regulations but about political interference, and
  weak demand and profits. The super-globalisation from which China benefited is
  pretty much over, and the world’s biggest export nation is now confronted by a
  fragmenting and fracturing trade and investment environment in which commerce
  within blocs is holding up better than trade between them. China’s bloc
  includes a majority of the world’s population, but very small proportions of
  world GDP, investment and wealth. At the same time, developed and
  middle-income economies, as well as emerging nations, are pushing back against
  what they perceive to be predatory trade policies by a mercantilist China.
  Peak China does not stem from doubts about China’s industrial prowess and
  pedigree. It is, though, about two things that can be simultaneously true:
  China can have world-class companies and trendsetters such as Alibaba,
  Tencent, BYD, CATL, Huawei and DeepSeek, as well as an economy with systemic
  imbalances, debt capacity limits, and political and economic contradictions.
  Put another way, China has islands of technological excellence and leadership
  in a sea of macroeconomic turbulence and trouble. This characterised Peak
  Japan 40 years ago, and China is shaping up for the encore. George Magnus is a
  research associate at Oxford University’s China Centre and at Soas University
  of London. He is the author of Red Flags: Why Xi’s China is in Jeopardy
