  Electricity companies are leaking millions of litres of oil underground
  throughout the UK, the Guardian can reveal. In the past 15 years, 3m litres
  (660,000 gallons) of oil has been spilt under southern England from cables
  owned by the electricity distribution company UK Power Networks. But leaks are
  occurring UK-wide; the largest single leak reported in recent years was in
  Edinburgh, when 24,000 litres was spilt from a ScottishPower Energy Networks
  (SPEN) cable. The oil is inside ageing electricity cables that were mainly
  installed in the 1950s to 1970s. It acts as an insulating fluid and helps to
  keep the cables cool, but as the cables age they leak increasingly. One
  scientist who has researched the cables said the leaks presented a huge
  problem for the environment, while Greenpeace has described the findings as
  extremely concerning. The Energy Networks Association (ENA), which represents
  the electricity distribution companies, said heavy oil had not been used in
  new cables for 40 years and many cables had been replaced. UK Power Networks
  said it had made investments to reduce leakage and was committed to replacing
  the cables entirely in the long term. Dr Susmit Basu researched the
  underground cables between 2015 and 2018, when he worked at a science and
  technology company that conducted research and development for a UK Power
  Networks project focusing on reducing oil leaks from them. He said the leaks
  presented a “huge problem for the environment” and were slowly contributing to
  major biodiversity loss over long periods of time. Basu visited one site in
  Norfolk where a cable was leaking oil continuously and had saturated the soil.
  The oil had seeped into the bodies of trees via the roots, then damaged leaves
  and caused them to become yellowish in colour and develop spots. The
  oil-soaked soil had to be removed and replaced with fresh soil. But no one
  knew “how much of the fluid the rainwater took with it – that was anyone’s
  guess”, Basu said. Usually an underground oil leak caused no immediate danger,
  Basu said; it was rarely the case that “this night there was a leak and
  tomorrow it was a disaster zone”. But with time the oil travelled through the
  soil into the nearest water bodies including rivers, lakes or the sea, killing
  useful fungi, bacteria, fish and other aquatic life. Maintenance workers often
  topped up cables when a drop in oil levels caused them to stop working
  effectively, Basu said. “Where’s those few thousands of litres going?” He said
  the leaked oil would “not simply disappear” and would stay in the environment
  for thousands or millions of years. Basu said companies were introducing
  solutions to the leaks, but doing so was costly and could be complicated. He
  also suggested there was little public pressure to act: “The leaking is
  invisible to the public eye … nobody cares [about the leaks], nobody knows,
  nobody can see. Those materials should not be in the soil … we need
  electricity but we also need the environment and our surrounding atmosphere to
  be clean.” Companies and regulators do not publish information about precisely
  where leaks have occurred or oil-filled cables are located, though freedom of
  information requests from environmental regulators reveal leaks have happened
  underneath cities, residential areas, riverbeds and arable fields. Lily-Rose
  Ellis, a campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: “This is really concerning and is
  yet more evidence of the urgent need to update our crumbling energy
  infrastructure. “These cables are at best outdated, but some are virtually
  antiques and are urgently in need of replacement. The UK electricity grid was
  designed and built for the energy system of the last century.” UK Power
  Networks is responsible for more electricity cable leaks than any other
  company, freedom of information requests to the energy regulator, Ofgem, have
  confirmed. Electricity North West, Northern Powergrid, Scottish and Southern
  Electricity Networks (SSEN), SPEN and National Grid Electricity Distribution
  (formerly Western Power Distribution) all also own fluid-filled cables. The
  largest single spill recorded in recent years was underneath Edinburgh. A
  single SPEN cable leaked 24,000 litres of oil between late 2023 and its being
  sealed in early 2024. An additional ScottishPower cable leaked a further 6,000
  litres in Edinburgh in 2023. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency
  refused freedom of information requests for details on the Edinburgh leaks on
  the grounds that an investigation was taking place. SPEN stated at the time:
  “Neither leak has resulted in oil contamination of watercourses, and no
  enforcement actions or undertakings resulted from the two incidents notified
  to the regulator.” A spokesperson for ENA said the electricity distribution
  companies had not used heavy oil in newly laid fluid-filled cables for about
  40 years and now used biodegradable substances, solid insulation and sealed
  cabling. It said 310 miles of older cables had been replaced in the past 10
  years, and oil-filled cables made up less than 1% of the grid around London
  and the south-east. UK Power Networks said it had made significant investments
  to reduce oil leakage since 2011, replacing 78 miles of oil-filled cables, and
  was committed to replacing them entirely. It said it worked with the
  Environment Agency for reporting and mitigation and adhered to relevant
  operating codes. It said: “During repairs, the company recovers as much cable
  fluid as possible.” This included fluid pumped into containers and oil
  absorbed in contaminated soil, which is removed in sealed skips and disposed
  of by specialists. Ofgem said it had made it clear to companies that they
  should do everything possible to mitigate the impact on the environment,
  including preventing leaks by ensuring their assets were well maintained and
  reliable. Research for this article was supported by the Dark Green programme,
