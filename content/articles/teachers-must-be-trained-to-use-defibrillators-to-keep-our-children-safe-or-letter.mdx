  Children across England are preparing to return to school this week following
  the summer break, but parents should be concerned for their safety and
  wellbeing while they are in school. After years of campaigning after the
  tragic death of my son Oliver to sudden cardiac arrest, I strongly welcomed
  the commitment given by the previous government to ensure that all
  state-funded schools across England received life-saving defibrillators. The
  rollout of the programme was significant and marked a giant step forward in
  improving emergency medical readiness, and potentially saving lives in schools
  across England. Now I am urging the current Labour government to go a step
  further by ensuring that all school staff receive appropriate and up-to-date
  training on how to use defibrillators confidently and effectively. Through our
  work at the Oliver King Foundation, we have heard first-hand from headteachers
  and teaching staff across the country that this life-saving equipment is not
  being used and instead being stored in cupboards because the training on how
  to use it has not been provided. The presence of defibrillators in schools
  alone is not going to solve the problem. Providing adequate training is
  crucial as a means of maximising the valuable investment made by the former
  government and in ensuring that every child, teacher and visitor in our
  schools is as safe as possible in the event of a cardiac emergency. Failure to
  provide this training is putting lives needlessly at risk. Cardiac conditions
  such as sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (Sads) kill 12 young people under the
  age of 35 every single week in the UK. The need to ensure our schools are
  prepared to deal with unexpected emergencies such as cardiac arrest could not
  be clearer. This is not a partisan issue, but a matter of safeguarding the
  health and lives of our children. Regardless of political affiliation, we can
  all agree that schools should be safe spaces where teachers are equipped to
  respond effectively in emergencies. Training is a commonsense solution that
  transcends political lines and reflects a shared commitment to the wellbeing
  of every child in England. As the new school year approaches, I am urging the
  government to act quickly. Mark King The Oliver King Foundation
