  His performances defined an era, and his life story has been dissected in
  tell-all books as well as on the big screen. But now further revelations may
  open up an unknown chapter in the life of Freddie Mercury. The question of
  whether or not Mercury had a secret daughter, whom he told no one about and
  would now be 48-years-old, has divided fans and the closest people in his
  life. A forthcoming book by Lesley-Ann Jones tells of a woman known only as B,
  who claims that the woman is in fact the Queen frontman’s daughter – conceived
  during a fling with the wife of a close friend in 1976. “Freddie Mercury was
  and is my father,” she says in a handwritten letter. “We had a very close and
  loving relationship from the moment I was born and throughout the final 15
  years of his life. He adored me and was devoted to me.” Little is known about
  B other than her age and the fact she is a medical professional working in
  Europe. She claims Mercury entrusted her with 17 journals that cover the final
  years of his life, which Jones says are “the closest thing to a Freddie
  Mercury autobiography that the world will ever know”. The claims, which first
  emerged in May and were apparently common knowledge among Mercury’s inner
  circle, have been met with mounting pushback from some people who knew the
  singer best. When asked about B, the Queen guitarist Brian May said he wanted
  to remain “neutral”. However, his wife, the former EastEnders star Anita
  Dobson, dismissed the claims as “fake news”. Mary Austin, a close friend of
  the singer, also doubted whether Mercury would have kept the fact he had a
  daughter secret from his inner circle. “Freddie had a glorious openness, and I
  cannot imagine he would have wanted to, or been able to, keep such a joyful
  event a secret, either from me or other people closest to him,” Austin told
  the Sunday Times. Austin inherited about half of an estimated £9m estate that
  Mercury left after the singer, who was diagnosed with Aids in 1987, died aged
  45 of bronchial pneumonia in 1991. Mercury had relationships with men and
  women (including Austin) and described himself as bisexual. “The truth is that
  I am simply not the guardian of such a secret,” said Austin. “I’ve never known
  of any child, or of any diaries. If Freddie had indeed had a child without me
  knowing anything about it, that would be astonishing to me.” The woman
  referred to as B responded by saying she was “devastated” by Austin’s
  comments. Jones – whose book Love, Freddie will be published next month –
  defended the validity of the claims when they first emerged, saying that a DNA
  test had been conducted that supported the version of events presented in her
  Mercury biography. She also pointed to the lack of a vocal rejection of the
  claims by the remaining members of Queen as further evidence that the details
  in her book were true. “What I would say is that the real inner circle – the
  other members of Queen and Freddie’s sister – would have denied this if they
  could, weeks ago, when the story broke,” Jones said. “They cannot because, as
  Freddie’s daughter says, they know that it is true.” Jones, who has written a
  series of books about music’s biggest names, has been talking up more
  revelations that appear in Love, Freddie – claiming she has been “crafting a
  narrative that will overturn everything we thought we knew about him and his
  legacy”.
