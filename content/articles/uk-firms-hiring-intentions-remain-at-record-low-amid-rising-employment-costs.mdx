  Hiring intentions among Britain’s businesses remain at a record low as they
  grapple with rising employment costs and worry about the economic outlook,
  with young people hit hardest by the drop in recruitment. Three separate
  surveys issued on Monday painted a gloomy picture on hiring activity, pay and
  business confidence, with claims that bosses were “stuck in limbo” and waiting
  for greater clarity in the autumn budget. Only 57% of private sector employers
  plan to recruit staff in the next three months – down from 65% in autumn 2024
  as they deal with the combined £25bn rise in employer national insurance
  contributions (NICs) that took effect in April and other rising costs,
  according to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD).
  Another report, from KPMG and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation
  (REC), showed that recruitment across the UK fell sharply in July, for
  permanent and temporary jobs. This was often linked to employers’ gloomy
  outlook, and increased pressure on recruitment budgets. The report showed the
  steepest reduction in vacancies since April, while availability of staff rose
  at a rate that was among the fastest since the survey began in 1997. This has
  hit pay growth, with starting salaries rising at the weakest rate in almost
  four and a half years, it said. Demand for permanent staff was said to be down
  across all 10 employment categories apart from engineering. Retail remained at
  the bottom of the table with “a rapid fall in vacancies”, while the smallest
  decline happened in the construction sector. “With starting salaries and temp
  pay rising only modestly, it was right to cut interest rates last week,” said
  Kate Shoesmith, the REC deputy chief executive. “More action like this, to
  stabilise the business cost-base, is what will support growth and boost the
  jobs market this year. That is what the chancellor should be keeping firmly in
  mind when preparing this year’s autumn budget.” On Thursday, the Bank of
  England cut interest rates for the fifth time in a year as it warned that
  rising food prices could drive inflation to 4%, amid mounting concerns about
  the strength of the UK economy. Shoesmith noted that construction, a key
  economic bellwether, “has seen a rise in temp vacancies – an early sign of
  confidence returning”, adding: “Demand for blue-collar temp roles and
  permanent engineering jobs also remains steady, offering another glimmer of
  optimism.” The hospitality and care sectors, and organisations that hire young
  people, had been hit the hardest by mounting employment costs, the CIPD said.
  About 37% of employers that hired people under 21 reported that the NICs
  changes had increased their employment costs to a large extent, compared with
  23% of employers that do not hire young people, despite under-21s being exempt
  from employer NICs. The organisation is urging the government to step up
  efforts to support the employment and training of young people and ensure that
  proposed changes to the employment rights bill do not act as a further barrier
  to their recruitment. James Cockett, the senior labour market economist at the
  CIPD, said: “Business confidence is faltering further under rising employment
  costs.” Meanwhile, weak GDP growth and high labour and energy costs coupled
  with continued uncertainty around Donald Trump’s global tariffs continue to
  weigh on confidence, the business advisory firm BDO’s latest monthly snapshot
  showed. Scott Knight, the head of growth at BDO, said: “There are signs of
  recovery but they are fragile … Business leaders are stuck in limbo, waiting
  for clearer signals from the government that further investment will be worth
  the gamble.”
