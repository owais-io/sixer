  Is being happy at work the key to the UK government’s goal of boosting
  productivity and economic growth? The former Waitrose boss turned big company
  adviser Mark Price certainly thinks so. Solving widespread worker unhappiness
  would be good for the UK’s army of workers and getting people back into the
  workforce, as well as being the answer to many of Britain’s economic woes, he
  says. Since leaving a decades-long career in retail, followed by a stint in
  government as trade minister, Lord Price – known during his days running the
  supermarket chain as the “Chubby Grocer” – has embarked on a mission to make
  organisations recognise the value of a happy workforce, while empowering
  employees to gain more satisfaction from their toil. “If people are happy in
  their jobs they don’t leave, you retain knowledge, you have lower levels of
  sick absence, all of which leads to more profitable and more effective
  organisations. And it’s good for individuals,” says Price. He has the data to
  back this up, thanks to the 1.5 million workers globally, half of whom are in
  the UK, who have completed the How Happy Are You at Work? survey run by
  Price’s organisation WorkL. Britons are, on average, the unhappiest workers in
  the G20 group of nations, a fact he believes has a direct link with the
  economy’s productivity problem, where the UK also has the unhappy position as
  bottom of the G20. One of the aims of the Labour government is to get more
  people back to work – which has been a pervasive problem in Britain since the
  pandemic, far more than in its European neighbours – and which ministers
  believe is the best way of cutting the benefits bill. Reeling off a list,
  Price says: “All our research shows that if you are happy in your job, you
  work harder, you’re more productive, you’ll give extra discretionary effort,
  you’re more likely to be paid more highly than your unhappy colleagues, you’re
  more likely to be promoted, your mental health will be better and your
  wellbeing in general will be better.” WorkL – the L doesn’t stand for
  anything, Price says, although some presume the name stands for “work-life” –
  is paid to advise large employers including the retailer Next, the restaurant
  chains Burger King and Wagamama, as well as many of the UK’s universities, who
  tend to score poorly for employee satisfaction. The organisation was also
  called in to advise the Scottish brewer and bar chain BrewDog during the
  tenure of the previous chief executive, James Watt, following accusations by
  former workers that Watt presided over a “culture of fear”. Price’s focus on
  happiness will resonate at a time of continual tussles between employers and
  their staff in the post-pandemic world of work. Many workers have come to
  expect a certain degree of flexibility in where and when they fulfil their
  duties. There have, however, been warnings that such flexibility is not
  offered to nurses, transport and retail workers among others, dividing Britain
  into a two-tier workforce. Price is calling for a contract between all kinds
  of employees and their employers, a “work happiness charter” which he outlines
  in his latest book, Work Happier, to be published next month. He believes that
  recent decades have brought great strides in workplace safety and in legal
  rights for employees, without telling them “how work should feel”. The burden
  has traditionally been placed on employers to improve treatment of their
  teams, or to offer them training to allow them to advance. Price believes that
  people have a “right to be happy at work”, along with other rights including
  fair pay, to be equipped with the tools to carry out the job, but also to be
  “well informed”, “treated with respect” and “given the opportunity to show
  your ability”. In return, he says employees have responsibilities and should
  commit to give their best effort, to be punctual and positive, take
  responsibility and keep the best interests of their organisation in mind. Such
  a mutual undertaking would allow workers to figure out whether they can
  improve their current position, advance through training, or whether they
  should consider moving roles within an organisation or even look for a new job
  elsewhere, even in a different sector. Just under a third of respondents to
  WorkL’s survey are “very unhappy”, Price says, which can harm workers’ mental
  health and damage relationships with their friends and family, who have to
  listen to their complaints. The research has also found that sectors such as
  technology tend to have happier workers, while defence scores bottom; the
  retail and hospitality sectors also tend to have staff who are less content.
  Price traces his interest in workplace happiness back to his 34 years at the
  John Lewis Partnership, the owner of John Lewis department stores and the
  Waitrose supermarket chain, where he rose from graduate trainee to deputy
  chair. John Spedan Lewis established the co-owned business in 1929, when he
  decided to transfer all the shares in the family business he had inherited
  into a trust. Price says he was told on his very first day that, rather than
  commercial considerations, the partnership’s “supreme purpose … was the
  happiness of its workers”. More than a decade after leaving, he still does not
  have a bad word to say about a business he describes as “magical” and “very
  forward-looking”, although he concedes it “may have made a few mis-steps” in
  recent years. Indeed, the retailer has had a tricky few years since the
  pandemic, and it has not paid a bonus to its staff for three of the past four
  years. Meanwhile, hourly pay rates at Waitrose are below most of its main
  supermarket rivals, as well as the discounters Aldi and Lidl. Pay, according
  to WorkL’s data, is not the main motivator for most employees, with workers
  reporting they “want to feel that they’re being paid fairly for the job that
  they’re doing”. This holds true for jobs across all sectors, even lower-paid
  or lower-skilled roles. “People want to feel valued,” Price says. “It’s not a
  pay issue. It’s about how you are being treated in the workplace, the value
  that you feel you are getting from that, and how your employer is developing
  you.” Since the pandemic, surveys have shown that work-life balance now ranks
  more highly than pay for many employees. Despite the string of
  return-to-office mandates from large employers in recent months, Price says
  WorkL’s data shows that hybrid working does not have a positive or negative
  effect on productivity, but being able to work in a hybrid way makes most
  employees happier. “All our data clearly points to the fact that the people
  who are happiest have that blend of some time in the office, doing office
  things and connecting, and some time at home.” Price, a Conservative peer,
  believes that the Labour government’s employment rights bill, expected to
  become law in the autumn, “misses the really big point, it should be about how
  people feel at work”. This, he says, would also help it with its goals of
  cutting the welfare bill and encouraging people back into the workforce. “Work
  is a noble thing. You’re helping yourself, you’re helping your family, you’re
  helping society … Working is good and I think we have lost sight of that,” he
  says.
