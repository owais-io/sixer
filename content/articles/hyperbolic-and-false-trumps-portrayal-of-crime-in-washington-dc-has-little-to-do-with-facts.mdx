  Donald Trump is deploying the national guard in Washington DC and seizing
  control of its police force, claiming that the nation’s capital has become
  “lawless” and is “one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the world”. The
  president portrayed himself as DC’s savior, vowing to rid it of “crime,
  bloodshed, bedlam, and squalor and worse”. He demanded unhoused people leave
  the city, or face eviction. Trump’s portrayal of Washington DC, where he has
  been forced to reside as president, cutting short his time in his beloved
  Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, did not come as a surprise. He’s presented DC as
  a “nightmare of murder and crime” before, and already in February was reported
  to be mulling a law-enforcement crackdown. Nor is it the only major American
  city in his crosshairs. “Los Angeles has been invaded and occupied by Illegal
  Aliens and Criminals. Now violent, insurrectionist mobs are swarming and
  attacking our Federal Agents to try and stop our deportation operations,”
  Trump said in June, while deploying the national guard to quell protests
  there. Just as Los Angeles in June wasn’t overrun with insurrectionist mobs –
  the protests were largely confined to a few city blocks – Trump’s portrayal of
  crime in Washington DC has little to do with facts, but instead, are rooted in
  false and misleading claims about crime and homelessness, experts say. Muriel
  Bowser, the Democratic mayor of DC, responded, saying: “Any comparison to a
  war-torn country is hyperbolic and false.” Violent crime in DC is at a 30-year
  low In his announcement on Monday, Trump focused on DC’s 2023 crime rates,
  saying murders that year “reached the highest rate probably ever”. Washington
  DC did experience a sharp increase in homicides in 2023, with 274 killings, a
  jump from the 203 lives lost the year prior. It was a devastating toll for
  communities in the city, many of which struggled to emerge from the pandemic.
  But crime trends have dramatically changed since. In January, the Metropolitan
  police department and US attorney’s office released a report indicating that
  total violent crime in DC in 2024 was down 35% from the prior year, marking
  the lowest rate in over 30 years. The overall violent crime reduction included
  a 32% decline in homicides, a 39% decline in robberies, a 53% decline in armed
  carjackings and a 27% decline in assaults with a dangerous weapon, compared to
  2023. The progress, US attorney Matthew Graves said at the time, was based on
  a strategy that focused on specific groups and drug trafficking networks
  targeting certain neighborhoods. “Overall, there’s an unmistakable and large
  drop in violence [in DC] since the summer of 2023, when there were peaks in
  homicide, gun assaults, robbery, and carjacking,” Adam Gelb, the president of
  the Council on Criminal Justice, a non-partisan thinktank, said in a
  statement. The group has reported that DC’s homicide rate fell 19% in January
  through June of this year compared to the same period last year. Youth arrests
  have declined in DC Trump began discussing a return to federal control of the
  city and the use of national guard to quell street crime after a former Doge
  staffer, Edward Coristine, appeared to have been attacked by a group of young
  people last week near his car. In statements on Monday, the president put
  forward a dramatic portrayal of offenses committed by minors in the capital,
  saying: “Caravans of mass youth rampage through city streets at all times of
  the day. They’re on ATVs, motorbikes. They travel pretty well.” At the same
  time, he indicated he wants law enforcement to take a more aggressive
  response. “They fight back, until you knock the hell out of them. Because it’s
  the only language they understand,” he said. DC police have made roughly 900
  arrests of youth this year, nearly 20% fewer than the same timeframe last
  year, according to the Washington Post. About 200 of those are arrests were
  for alleged violent crimes, with more than 40 for carjacking. Insha Rahman,
  the vice-president of advocacy and partnerships at Vera Institute of Justice,
  a non-profit that supports reforms, noted that data shows DC has had success
  in reducing youth violence through community-based programs instead of
  expanding police operations or enacting harsher punishments. She cited a
  restorative justice diversion program that allows youth to avoid prosecution
  and make amends outside the legal system and a program focused on mediating
  disputes. “DC’s most promising reductions in youth violence have come from
  community-led, accountability-driven interventions – not punitive crackdowns,”
  she said in an email. Unhoused people are victimized at high rates Trump’s
  recent push to crack down on homelessness through an executive order linked
  unhoused people to crime, saying: “Endemic vagrancy, disorderly behavior,
  sudden confrontations, and violent attacks have made our cities unsafe.” Data,
  however, has consistently shown that unhoused people are more likely to be
  victims than perpetrators of violent crime. In one of the largest studies of
  homelessness in decades, researchers at the University of California, San
  Francisco (UCSF) surveyed thousands of unhoused people in 2021 and 2022 and
  found that 36% of all participants reported experiencing physical violence
  during their current homelessness episode. Of those, half reported that the
  violence was committed by a stranger. “People experiencing homelessness are at
  an extraordinarily high risk of being a victim of crime, often committed by
  people who are housed and people who are total strangers to them,” said Dr
  Margot Kushel, a UCSF professor of medicine and director of the Benioff
  Homelessness and Housing Initiative. With unhoused people increasingly
  criminalized and targeted for sweeps, she added: “That victimization happens
  in the shadows. They don’t feel they can approach the police and report
  violence.” Meanwhile, the latest available data shows that while cities across
  the US have been grappling with surges in homelessness since the pandemic, the
  Washington DC region reported a slight decrease in its unhoused population
  this year. The 2025 annual survey, a rough estimate from a single day,
  recorded 9,659 people experiencing homelessness in the region, a decrease of
  115 people from the year prior, marking a 1% drop. The survey, conducted in
  January of this year, recorded a 10% decrease in unsheltered single adults,
  meaning people living outside. That marked the first year-over-year decline
  after several years of increases. Trump’s falsehoods about other cities Before
  Trump federalized law enforcement in Washington DC, the president focused on
  Los Angeles, deploying thousands of national guard members and marines to the
  city to quell protests against his administration’s immigration politics.
  Then, too, Trump sought to portray the city as one in chaos. He claimed on
  social media that “mobs are swarming and attacking our Federal Agents”. His
  FBI director, Kash Patel, said LA was “under siege by marauding criminals”.
  The image was sharply contradicted by what was happening on the ground. The
  sustained protests were largely confined to a 10-block area of downtown LA,
  and while there were violent incidents, the protests were largely considered
  peaceful. Police made hundreds of arrests, but many were for minor, nonviolent
  offenses, such as failure to disperse. The Department of Homeland Security and
  the Trump-appointed US attorney for the LA region have repeatedly accused
  protesters and others of violence against immigration officers, but have seen
  some of their claims contradicted by video footage. The Department of Justice
  has been forced to dismiss several felony assault charges it filed against
  demonstrators and people accused of interfering with immigration agents. Trump
  suggested on Monday that Los Angeles could see further intervention, again
  suggesting crime was rampant in those municipalities. So could Baltimore and
  Chicago, the president said. But those cities have also seen drops in crime
  similar to the trends in DC. Baltimore officials last month said the city was
  seeing the lowest number of homicides year-to-date in five decades. LA mayor
  Karen Bass said last month that the city was experiencing a roughly 20% dip in
  homicides in the first half of the year and was on pace for its lowest
  homicide total in nearly 60 years. “Trump is wrong that ‘crime is out of
  control in DC’ and other cities,” Rahman said. “The cities that Trump cited at
  his press conference – Chicago, Baltimore, and Los Angeles – have all
  experienced unprecedented crime declines since 2023, before Trump took
  office.” Thomas Abt, the founding director of the Center for the Study and
  Practice of Violence Reduction at the University of Maryland, questioned
  Trump’s decision to have Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, and Terry Cole,
  the Drug Enforcement Administration administrator, take over the DC police:
  “If violent crime has been dropping for 18 months, it’s unclear to me how
  those two people – neither who have local law enforcement experience – can
  improve upon the good job that local law enforcement is doing.” Pulling FBI
  and other federal agents away from their jobs to patrol DC also means fewer
  resources dedicated to serious crime, he added: “It’s not clear this will make
  DC any safer, and could potentially make the rest of the country less safe.”
