  Long Story Short: this Jewish family comedy from the creator of BoJack
  Horseman is painfully beautiful

  Like schoolboys, my friend Charlie and I send each other coded messages. One
  of these is “Am back on the horse”, which means “Rewatching BoJack Horseman”,
  which means “Having a mental health crisis”. The recipient knows to go to the
  other’s house with Danish pastries and some grass to touch. That show changed
  my life. The Simpsons had redefined what a cartoon could be, Ren &amp; Stimpy
  and South Park were transgressive thrill-rides. But Raphael Bob-Waksberg’s
  tale of a washed-up actor chasing redemption wasn’t just adult; it was
  profound. So I was worried, approaching the new animated series from that
  show’s creators. It’s not about celebrity. There are no talking dogs or
  porcupines, or underwater worlds. No Will Arnett. How could I watch without
  expectation? It feels unfair yet unavoidable to keep an artist’s previous work
  in mind. Isn’t that like comparing a current partner with an ex? While it
  lacks a famous horse, Long Story Short (Netflix, from Friday 22 August) is its
  own beast, and no less ambitious. It’s a family saga told in multiple
  timelines. The Schwoopers are an argumentative, chaotic Jewish household. Each
  episode focuses on a character or relationship, swooshing back and forward in
  time, from the 1950s to the 2020s, as they navigate romance, coming of age,
  marital breakdown, parenting, old wounds, joy, death and purpose. Basically,
  it’s Bluey meets Tolstoy. The Jewishness is not incidental. The show is Jewish
  inside and out, defiantly, delightedly so. Naomi Schwartz is presented as a
  classic Jewish matriarch, impossibly critical yet overbearingly proud of her
  children. Daughter Shira is more modern. (“We’re a lesbian couple with
  biracial, Jewish sons. We’re impressive,” as her partner Kendra puts it.) In
  the episode Yoshi’s Bar Mitzvah, teenager Danny (voiced by Dave Franco)
  celebrates his friend’s public speaking. “Dude, your davening was on point!”
  he hypes. “Mr Leibowitz was kvellin’ like a felon!” It almost goes without
  saying: melancholy. Most dramas have a primary time and place, flashing back
  in a limited way. Long Story Short doesn’t privilege any of its periods or
  people. There is only the equalising process of decades passing or rolling
  back. The time-hopping is extraordinarily effective, bringing characters back
  from the dead, fleshing out relationships, grounding us in moral complexity.
  We feel the painful beauty of our bounded lives. It almost even more goes
  without saying: funny. Long Story Short delights in language games,
  subversion, absurdity and surprise. Hapless Yoshi gets conned into becoming a
  salesman for explosive mattresses in a tube. (Yes, there’s a soft launch.)
  Avi’s daughter Hannah’s school has been invaded by wolves, but no one seems
  concerned. Kendra and Shira have a dog, named the Undeniable Isadora Duncan. I
  guess there are animals in this one. Characters talk a mile a minute,
  particularly at the Schwoopers’ dinner table, and it takes a while to key into
  the frenetic pace. But BoJack Horseman also took a minute to find its hooves.
  (In fact, the first season improved so drastically in its second half, website
  IndieWire changed its reviewing strategy to only award scores after watching
  entire seasons.) Here, I was locked in by the second episode. It’s rare for me
  to actually LOL, watching comedies. But I did, repeatedly – such as when Shira
  is flummoxed by a reCAPTCHA asking her to pick out squares containing
  bisexuals. (“How am I supposed to …?”) Kendra is unimpressed. “Where are your
  glasses? It says bicycles.” But above all, it’s beautiful. The show is
  interested in the moments when one’s heart splits open. The final scene of an
  episode in which Kendra attends shul for mercenary reasons pierced me with its
  humanity. The poignancy is baked into its innovative structure, reminding me
  of the Sondheim musical Merrily We Roll Along, perhaps a little of Pachinko
  and the film Boyhood. It wears its formal brilliance lightly, and at 10
  episodes of 30 minutes, Long Story Short doesn’t outstay its welcome. It’s
  rewarding company, even if you don’t catch every Fiddler on the Roof
  reference. I’m glad it’s already been renewed. As with loved ones I have lost,
  I want more time.
