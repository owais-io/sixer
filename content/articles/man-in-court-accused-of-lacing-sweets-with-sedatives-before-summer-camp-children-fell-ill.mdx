  A man has been remanded in custody charged with child cruelty offences after
  children became unwell at a summer camp in Leicestershire. Jon Ruben, 76,
  appeared in Leicester magistrates court after being charged with three counts
  of wilfully assaulting, ill-treating, neglecting, abandoning or exposing
  children in a manner likely to cause them unnecessary suffering or injury to
  health, where he was told he would be remanded in custody and appear at
  Leicester crown court on Friday 29 August. The charges relate to three boys
  becoming ill while staying at a summer camp at Stathern Lodge in Stathern,
  north Leicestershire, between 25 July and 29 July. The court was told it was
  in connection with sweets allegedly being laced with sedatives. Ruben, of
  Ruddington, Nottinghamshire, spoke on Saturday morning only to confirm his
  name, date of birth and address during the four-minute hearing and gave no
  indication of how he would plead. Leicestershire police arrived at the camp
  after receiving reports that children were feeling unwell, with eight boys,
  all between the ages of eight and 11, and one adult admitted to hospital as a
  precaution before being discharged. Ruben was arrested on Monday evening at a
  nearby pub on suspicion of administering poison or a noxious thing with intent
  to injure, aggrieve or annoy. Neighbours at the scene described seeing
  distressed parents outside the village hall in nearby Plungar, which was used
  as a triage centre for the children. The police watchdog, the Independent
  Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), has said it is investigating Leicestershire
  police’s handling of the incident after it emerged that officers responding to
  the scene allegedly gave conflicting accounts of what happened, including
  whether the incident took place on the Sunday or the Monday. Police have
  stated that the owners of the lodge at which the camp took place are not being
  investigated, saying the “owners and operators of Stathern Lodge are
  independent from those people who use or hire the lodge and are not connected
  to the incident”.
