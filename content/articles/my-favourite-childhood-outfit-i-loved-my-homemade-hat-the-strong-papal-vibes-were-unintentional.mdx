  My favourite childhood outfit: ‘I loved my homemade hat – the strong papal
  vibes were unintentional’

  I would love to have picked something super cute: a sparkly tutu; an adorable
  pair of Mary Janes. Or something cool: an oversized denim jacket with the
  collar popped, perhaps. But no. Here is an entirely unhinged photograph of me
  aged four wearing a homemade (obviously) hat – strong papal vibes
  unintentional – embellished with drawings of my teddy (name: Ted) and with
  actual Ted himself affixed to the hat. I am also wearing two anchoring hair
  slides because of the weight of this magnificent creation. This is a look that
  speaks to the boundless creativity of childhood, of making your own fun as the
  rest of the family snoozes in the late afternoon sun, in a time before the
  attention economy was monopolised by algorithms. I am holding my favourite
  stuffed toy, an elephant named Elephant (shut up). Elephant is wearing his own
  similarly styled hat, but he has his own likeness on it. I agree that this
  could be said to lack humility on Elephant’s part, but I should also point out
  that Mick Jagger is frequently photographed in Rolling Stones T-shirts.
  American art collective MSCHF think they are being outre with their Big Red
  Boot, but nothing since circa 1994 (when this picture was taken, on a holiday
  in Mallorca) has come close to the majestic whimsy of these hats. Nothing.
  Fashion is a notoriously circular phenomenon. I see gen Z wearing the same
  outfits I did as a teenager, and few things are more humbling than finding out
  that clothes you stopped wearing not long ago are now considered “vintage
  pieces”. But you will not find these hats on Depop. If there were any justice
  in the world, you would find them in the Costume Institute at the Met. I still
  love a hat. Like all women who sleep with women, I am no stranger to a
  Carhartt beanie; and I have recently entered my Cap Era. I like to think I’m
  giving “off-duty celebrity”, but it is possible that I am giving “undercover
  cop being very bad at being undercover”. There are other elements from my
  juvenescent style that I retain: mostly a deep and enduring love of corduroy
  in all its forms, sweatshirts louder than the sun, and trousers that are
  oversized (but these days purposely so) – but my DIY approach to accessories
  is no longer. I stopped at beaded friendship bracelets and “personalising” my
  jelly shoes with permanent marker as a tween – so I have a lot of respect for
  adults who knit their own clothes and tie-dye old T-shirts, YouTube tutorial
  playing in the background. But, look, sometimes you just have to quit while
  you – and your toy elephant – are ahead.
