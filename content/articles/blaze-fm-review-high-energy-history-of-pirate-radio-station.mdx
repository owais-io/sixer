webTitle: Blaze FM review – high-energy history of pirate radio station
sectionName: Stage

bodyText: >-
  This story of a pirate radio station is also the story of a marginalised
  community. When they hear a bang on the door, the DJs of the illegal Blaze FM,
  youngsters and veterans alike, assume the authorities have spotted their
  antenna and come to shut them down. That is only rarely the case. As the early
  years of this century slip by, many other flashpoints from the outside world
  find their way into the Hackney council flat from where they broadcast. The
  attack on the World Trade Center brings anti-Muslim reprisals; violence
  associated with the drill scene leads to the banning of songs; the
  proliferation of knives results in the death of a friend; and redevelopment
  brings the threat of gentrification. The past, too, makes its mark: new
  information about the death of PC Keith Blakelock in the Broadwater Farm riots
  of 1985 gets the police interested in Hughbert Smith (Andrew Brown), the radio
  station founder who, under the government’s hostile environment, faces
  deportation. It is a grim tally, made harder to swallow by the station’s
  evident role in community cohesion. The dialogue can sometimes be clunky as
  the play races through the years, and the novelty of YouTube turns into the
  novelty of podcasting, but the seriousness of the theme and the sheer
  exuberance of the live music keeps energy levels high. Co-written by James
  Meteyard and grime MC Jammz, it is briskly directed by Maggie Norris for The
  Big House, which supports care-affected young people. Taking turns on the mic,
  a reticent Jason (Alexander Lobo Moreno) reinvents himself as Big J, a
  formidable MC, impressing fellow rappers Alpha (Aliaano El-Ali) and Pritstik
  (Marcus Reiss), plus the sweet-voiced Aisha (Anais Lone), an aspiring lawyer.
  Their grime and jungle beats are the defiant response of a community under
  siege. At Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 25 August All our Edinburgh
  festival reviews
