  Labour MP Jess Phillips has said the UK has got “fat” from the free labour of
  women for decades. The minister for safeguarding and violence against women
  and girls said the country has relied on women providing charity, adding it
  was a “fundamentally sexist” practice that meant the government was less
  willing to provide the service itself. She said she “hated” the title of her
  role and added that safeguarding against gender-based violence should be
  “business as usual in every single government department”. The Birmingham
  Yardley MP also suggested there was an issue in Whitehall where government
  departments viewed violence against women and girls as solely a Home Office
  issue. Phillips said she had to push for the safety of women and girls to be a
  “mainstream concern”, which she said had not always made her “popular as a
  government minister”. Asked what pushback she had received from ministers or
  civil servants, she said: “People directly say things like, ‘That’s the Home
  Office’s job’. “Why is it my job to do healthy relationship education in
  schools? Why is it my job to provide mental health support for whatever reason
  it is that you ended up in that [situation]?’ “Do you know what it is? Free
  labour of women is where it comes from. “It comes from a fundamentally sexist
  place in that women didn’t have these services, so a load of women across the
  country got together and made these services and offered them to other women
  for free, and they didn’t get paid for their labour. “So they put down a
  mattress and made a refuge. They set up counselling services and got people
  who were trained to be therapists and got their voluntary hours and set it up
  for free.” Phillips said people do not recognise how heavily the UK has relied
  on women providing support that previously did not exist She added: “Nobody
  offered diabetes medicine for free. Pharmaceutical companies didn’t go, ‘Wow,
  this is really important. People will die without this. We’ll just give it
  away for free.’ “That is what the women in our country did in the 1960s and
  1970s and 1980s and we got fat on that expectation that that service will be
  provided for free. “And we also belittled it as an issue that wasn’t
  absolutely, fundamentally mainstream to the safety and security of our nation.
  “Undoing that is really hard and it’s going to take a long time.”
