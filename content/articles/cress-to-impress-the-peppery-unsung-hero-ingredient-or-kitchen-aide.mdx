  Growing cress with my daughter is a fun activity, but she’s intolerant to eggs
  so can’t have the classic sandwich I grew up with. What else can we make with
  cress? Sophie, via email This is also a pressing matter for Rosie Birkett,
  author of the A Lot on her Plate Substack, because her daughter recently
  returned home from nursery with a yoghurt tub containing cress: “It might be
  tiny, but cress is mighty – peppery punchy, and full of character, almost like
  a mini rocket leaf.” And if eggs are off the menu, Birkett’s first port of
  call would be to harness the young seedlings’ ability to accessorise: “Do your
  usual mashed avocado with a little lemon and olive oil, spread that over bread
  or toast, then top with a scattering of cress. It will add brilliant bite,
  freshness and pepperiness.” The same goes for bruschetta, or toasts with
  hummus, olive oil and gentle spices such as cumin, says Anna Jones, author of
  Easy Wins. She’s no stranger to growing cress, either: “I did it with my own
  kids, and it’s a really good lesson in seeing and feeling where food comes
  from.” She also recommends using the stuff where you might watercress, rocket,
  salad leaves or fresh, summery herbs (think chives). “I would love a cream
  cheese sandwich with a bit of salt, a bit of cucumber and lots of cress,” she
  says. “On a hot day, that would feel quite fun and afternoon tea-ish.” In a
  similar vein, Birkett might stir cress through cream cheese or ricotta for a
  “super-simple spread” to spoon on to sandwiches or jacket potatoes, or for
  spreading on crackers. Otherwise, simply stir cress into hummus or, if there’s
  yoghurt in the fridge, another slam-dunk dip would be “thick strained yoghurt,
  a squeeze of lemon, maybe some grated garlic and finely chopped cress”, which
  would be perfect for scooping up with cucumber sticks or pitta chips. Cress is
  also a good gateway to greens, says Georgia Levy, author of The Lunch Box
  Substack: “It’s a very good way to get children familiar with seeing flecks of
  green in their food,” she says. “Try stirring some through a bowl of macaroni
  cheese or their favourite pasta dish, and then, in future, that can be
  replaced by spinach or herbs.” Well, that’s the hope, anyway. If, however,
  your children are already au fait with herbs, Jones would be inclined to throw
  her cress into a salad: “I often make a herb salad with basil, mint, a bit of
  parsley and cress.” But be sure to dress it with something slightly sweet, she
  adds: “A bit of honey, say, or maybe maple syrup.” Finally, mix cress into
  spuds, Birkett says: “Scatter homegrown cress on a buttery potato or sweet
  potato mash to add a lovely freshness and a touch of grown-up flavour that
  little palates might just surprise you by loving.” In theory at least,
  children should be more open to trying new foods if they’ve had a hand in
  growing them, Birkett says: “That sprinkle of cress will feel like a proud
  moment for them, as well as a sweet garnish.” Got a culinary dilemma? Email
