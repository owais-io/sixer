  Cycling is one of the most rewarding activities around. It’s good for your
  physical and mental health, offers a carbon-free way of getting from A to B,
  and can often be the quickest and most cost-effective form of transport –
  particularly if you live in a city. Once you’re hooked, there are a few bits
  of kit that will improve your experience immeasurably, whether that’s
  comfortable clothing to curtail chaffing, or a water bottle to help you
  hydrate without stopping. In summer, the longer days and generally favourable
  conditions mean you can forgo additional accessories such as bike lights,
  mudguards and head-to-toe waterproofs – although they can’t be avoided forever
  if you become a year-round, all-weather rider. Another bit of good news is
  that while cycling has a reputation for being an expensive pursuit, it doesn’t
  have to be, and many of my favourite bits of kit have more affordable price
  tags. In the almost three decades since I set off stabiliser-free for the
  first time, I’ve dabbled in all types of cycling – from a teenage fling with
  BMXing to inner-city commuting and ultra-distance off-road escapades. In that
  time, I’ve tested all manner of clothing, tools and accessories, pushing them
  to the limit during races, events, training rides and the daily grind. Here’s
  my favourite gear that I reach for before setting off on a summer ride. ***
  Summer cycling essentials *** Jersey Although it performs a similar function
  to a generic sports base layer, a jersey is the first “proper” bit of cycling
  gear worth investing in because of the additional comfort it offers. Made from
  a lightweight, breathable fabric, a jersey will wick away moisture from
  hotspots, while a full-length zip means you can “ventilate” on the go. Three
  rear pockets store essentials such as food, tools and a phone, and unlike a
  running or gym top, the cut is slightly longer at the back for extra coverage
  when riding leant forward. My favourites, which perform well without breaking
  the bank, are Italian-designed Sportful SRK, which includes an extra zipped
  compartment for keys; the 100% recycled Rapha Core; the DHB Blok and its
  women-specific range, Moda; and the sub-£40 Madison Flux, which comes with a
  lifetime guarantee. Rapha Core women’s jersey From £55 at Rapha Sportful men’s
  SRK jersey £48.75 at Sportful DHB Moda women’s short-sleeve jersey 2.0 £55 at
  Sports Direct DHB Blok men’s classic short-sleeve jersey £55 at Sports Direct
  From £109.99 at Amazon Madison Flux men’s short-sleeve jersey £33.99 at Fawkes
  Cycles £35.99 at Cycle Store *** Shorts Bib shorts might seem like an
  indulgent (and expensive) purchase, but you get what you pay for – and your
  nether regions will let it be known if you’ve skimped. Fitted with a
  saddle-shaped section of foam in the crotch (known as a chamois), the shorts
  add an extra layer of padding beneath your perineum that keeps the area dry
  and cushioned on long rides. Just don’t wear underwear, as this can negate the
  benefits. The straps may make the item resemble a wrestler’s singlet, but they
  keep the shorts in place more comfortably than a waistband, which can dig in
  over time. As the male and female anatomy are quite different down there, it’s
  worth opting for a gender-specific set. Albion’s ABR1 are my go-to for
  ultra-distance exploits, arriving with handy pockets on each thigh and one at
  the rear for extra storage. The Gregarius Essential from Q36.5, meanwhile, are
  soft and supportive against the skin, and breathable too. And for women,
  “Petrichor Projects’ PP002 offer unbeatable comfort, with a cargo pocket,
  easy-pee design and sleek aesthetics,” says Katherine Moore, author of Gravel
  Rides South West England, who also recommends Velocio’s Luxe line for all-day
  epics. “They’re made from a super-soft, compressive material with a built-in
  base layer front and lovely raw-finish leg hem. A thicker-style chamois pad is
  the go-to for longer rides.” Albion ABR1 men’s pocket bib shorts £185 at
  Condor Cycles £185 at Albion Cycling Q36.5 Gregarius Essential bib shorts £140
  at Q36.5 Petrichor Projects PP002 women’s bib shorts £169 at Petrichor
  Projects Velocio women’s Luxe bib shorts £217 at Velocio *** Undershorts If
  you’d rather cover your modesty with a normal set of shorts, then opt for a
  pair of undershorts instead. Secured at the waist, rather than the shoulders,
  this padded set from Endura will soften the sting of any terrain (as I found
  out when mountain biking in Colorado), while the stretchy mesh fabric
  minimises the buildup of sweat, even when worn under non-technical clothing.
  Endura men’s padded Clickfast liner shorts £24.99 at Tredz £32.99 at Endura
  Endura women’s padded Clickfast liner shorts £21.99 at Merlin Cycles £29.99 at
  Endura *** Cap Cotton caps were originally designed to protect bare heads from
  the sun, although today’s peloton professionals will rarely wear one. Since
  you’re unlikely to be chasing every watt on your commute, though, a cycling
  cap under your helmet is a good way to shield from the sun or take off the
  chill on cooler mornings, all while adding a splash of colour to your riding
  wardrobe. Prendas specialises in vintage cotton caps, with the Mapei design of
  the 90s and early 00s team one of the loudest around. The Giro
  d’Italia-inspired cap from the General Classification is a bit more subtle but
  oozes style. Mapei retro cotton cycling cap £11.99 at Condor Cycles £18.55 at
  Amazon Tour of Italy cotton cycling cap £19.95 at the General Classification
  *** Helmet Helmets are a source of contentious debate, but if you want a model
  that goes above and beyond the EN1078 European standard (which every cycling
  helmet sold is required to pass by law), the ARO3 Endurance by Oakley is a
  good choice. It includes an internal Mips (multi-directional impact protection
  system) layer, which can move independently of the outer shell in the event of
  a crash, helping to protect the brain. Its 19 vents keep the air flowing even
  on the warmest days, and the antimicrobial liner minimises odour, ride after
  ride. Oakley AR03 Endurance Mips helmet From £78.99 at Tredz From £73.99 at
  Amazon *** Socks Although your feet are fairly static when riding a bike, all
  of those revolutions will soon have you working up a sweat inside your shoes.
  Any sports sock will do the job, but a cycling-specific pair will be much more
  comfortable, providing ventilation on the tops of your feet and padded toes to
  support every pedal stroke. Like caps, socks can enable you to add a splash of
  personality, and the fluoro finish of Aussie brand Maap’s training sock is
  sure to get nods of approval at the traffic lights. Maap training sock £18 at
  Cycle Project Store £15 at All4cycling *** Sunglasses Oversized sports
  sunglasses are a must-have fashion accessory this summer, but if you’re more
  interested in conquering hills than the catwalk, you should prioritise a set
  that provides good coverage against sun, rain and unsuspecting insects – as
  well as ventilation to prevent you from fogging up. Decathlon’s Van Rysel
  brand is renowned for its premium products, and its RoadR 900 shades can stand
  up to models from Oakley for a fraction of the cost. This pair comes with a
  photochromic, UV-filtering nylon lens that automatically adjusts depending on
  the sun’s intensity, meaning no need to swap between lenses and cover them in
  grubby fingerprints in the process. The lens has also undergone an
  oil-repelling treatment that helps rain and road spray run from its surface.
  Decathlon Van Rysel RoadR 900 Perf sunglasses £74.99 at Decathlon ***
  Insulated water bottle Most riders will need to drink at least 500ml of fluids
  an hour when cycling, and even more if it’s hot. You can use any water bottle,
  but a bidon comes with an easy-to-open valve that allows you to refresh as you
  ride, so you don’t need to stop to unscrew any lids. The Camelbak Podium is a
  time-honoured design that can carry up to 710ml, allowing you to ride for
  longer without running dry, and its insulated version keeps contents cold.
  Camelbak Podium water bottle £9.49 at Tredz £10.99 at Halfords ***
  Sports-specific sunscreen Road cyclists take pride in their tan lines, but
  protecting your skin is more important than chasing a golden glow. A
  sports-specific sunscreen will handle sweat better than an everyday cream, and
  Ultrasun’s Sports Gel does the job without leaving any greasy marks on your
  clothes. The fast-absorbing gel is easier to apply than a spray, and means you
  can quickly see whether you’ve covered all your exposed skin before setting
  off. Ultrasun sports gel SPF30 £22.40 for 200ml at Look Fantastic £22.40 for
  200ml at Sephora *** Phone mount Instead of forking out for a dedicated
  cycling computer for navigation and tracking, your phone can perform a similar
  function if you arm it with the right apps (see below). To keep an eye on
  directions or distance covered, you’ll want to attach it to your bike front
  and centre with a mount on your stem (the part that joins your handlebars to
  your fork). Quad Lock’s offering might look simple, but its twist and
  dual-lock system means you can trust it will hold your phone in place, and the
  included cable ties will fix it firmly to your bike. Quad Lock Bike Mount Pro
  stem mount £19.99 at Tweeks Cycles £22.99 at Amazon Quad Lock Mag case for
  iPhone £31.99 at Freewheel From £31.99 at Amazon *** Small toolkit Cycle
  enough and you’ll eventually come a cropper with a mid-ride mechanical. A
  puncture is the most common culprit, so it’s a good idea to arm yourself with
  the tools and knowhow to fix one. Tyre levers and a pump are a must, and
  carrying an inner tube or two that are the same size as those installed on
  your wheels will be the quickest fix. A puncture-repair kit is always a good
  backup too. For other issues, such as loose fittings or a broken chain,
  Crankbrothers’ pocket-sized F16 multitool has the hex bolt bits to get you out
  of most scrapes. If you have any carbon fibre components, Topeak’s Ratchet
  Rocket Lite NTX+ includes a torque gauge to stop you overtightening (and
  damaging) your bike. Crankbrothers F16 Multitool £50.38 at Rare Waves £54.54
  at Tweeks Cycles Topeak Ratchet Rocket Lite NTX+ £60.65 at Halfords £59.99 at
  Amazon Pedro’s tyre levers £8.99 at Amazon Decathlon inner tube repair patch
  replacement kit £1.99 at Decathlon Lezyne V2 ABS pressure-drive hand pump
  £29.89 at Tweeks Cycles £29.99 at Halfords *** Anti-chafe cream A solid pair
  of shorts will go a long way to helping you avoid saddle sores, but applying a
  layer of chamois cream to the area pre-ride is a belt-and-braces approach. You
  need to apply only a small amount of this cooling, rehydrating formula from
  Assos to keep everything supple and chafe-free – even after 12 hours in the
  saddle. Assos chamois creme £22 at Condor Cycles £22 at Tiso *** Bag There’s a
  cycling bag for every type of ride – from panniers perfect for the daily grind
  to the office, to big bikepacking setups that could survive a round-the-world
  expedition. For everyday exploring, though, you can’t beat a handlebar bag.
  The 3.4l Lil Presto Barrel Bag by Wizard Works can comfortably carry a
  waterproof layer, nutritional provisions and a multitool, and its hard-shell
  Cordura construction will keep contents protected from the elements (with the
  rigidity making it easy to unzip on the go). Wizard Works Lil Presto barrel
  bag £65 at Wizard Works *** Sports gels The cafe stop is a sacrosanct staple
  of any bike ride, and can sometimes be the sole motivation for saddling up.
  But cycling longer distances will require you to refuel well before you can
  tuck into your cappuccino and cake. Sports gels deliver a convenient, compact
  and easy-to-digest hit of carbohydrates, with a dose recommended every 20-30
  minutes. Veloforte’s energy gels are half the size of those from most other
  manufacturers, while the use of concentrated fruit juice rather than
  flavourings means you won’t suffer from the flavour fatigue of more
  synthetic-tasting alternatives. Clif Bloks are a good option for those who
  prefer a more solid sugar hit. Veloforte Primo natural energy gel From £6.87
  for three at Veloforte Clif Bloks Energy Chews From £53 for 18 packs at
  Halfords £56.99 for 18 packs at Amazon *** Navigation Looking for some local
  ride inspiration, or planning something farther afield? There are a host of
  navigation apps that can suggest tailored tours based on duration, distance
  and difficulty, and their cycling-specific nature means you’re rarely led
  astray (or on to a dual carriageway). Komoot is great for finding
  off-road-leaning trails and has its own easy-to-use route planner that
  includes user-recommended highlights. And if you already subscribe to Strava,
  in addition to tracking and displaying your speed and distance, the app has a
  route tool that can generate a loop based on the most popular roads and paths.
  For those who prefer printed guides, Jack Thurston’s Lost Lanes books are a
  brilliant resource and offer well-researched routes with accompanying
  downloadable directions. Komoot Premium from £4.99 Strava Premium from £8.99
  Lost Lanes Southern England £14.99 at Guardian Bookshop £12.39 at Amazon ***
  Massage gun for recovery Pounding the pedals can leave you with sore muscles,
  so ramp up your recovery with a massage gun. Theragun’s third-generation Mini
  packs an almighty punch considering its size, and is small enough to stow in a
  pannier if you’re out on a multi-day adventure. Its three-head attachments can
  delve deep into aches and pains in your quads, calves and lower back, and its
  guided routines are handy for those new to knot-busting. Theragun mini third
  generation £199 at Therabody £199 at Argos For more, read our roundup of the
  best massage guns *** Charlie Allenby is a health and fitness journalist who
  puts running and cycling gear through its paces on increasingly ridiculous
  endurance challenges
