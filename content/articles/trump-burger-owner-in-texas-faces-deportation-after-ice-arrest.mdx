  The owner of a Donald Trump-themed hamburger restaurant chain in Texas is
  facing deportation after immigration authorities under the command of the
  president detained him. Roland Mehrez Beainy, 28, entered the US as “a
  non-immigrant visitor” from Lebanon in 2019 and was supposed to have left the
  country by 12 February 2024, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice)
  spokesperson told the Guardian. Citing the Department of Homeland Security
  (DHS), Texas’s Fayette County Record newspaper reported that Beainy applied
  for legal status after purportedly wedding a woman – but the agency maintained
  there is no proof he ever lived with her during the alleged marriage. Ice said
  its officers arrested Beainy on 16 May – five years after he launched the
  first of multiple Trump Burger locations – and placed him into immigration
  proceedings, an agency statement said. “Under the current administration, Ice
  is committed to restore integrity to our nation’s immigration system by
  holding all individuals accountable who illegally enter the country or
  overstay the terms of their admission,” the agency’s statement also said.
  “This is true regardless of what restaurant you own or political beliefs you
  might have.” In remarks to the Houston Chronicle, Beainy denied Ice’s charges
  against him, saying: “Ninety percent of the shit they’re saying is not true.”
  He is tentatively scheduled for a hearing in immigration court on 18 November.
  Trump Burger gained national attention after Beainy opened the original
  location in Bellville, Texas, in 2020, the same year Trump lost his bid for a
  second presidential term to Joe Biden. Replete with memorabilia paying
  reverence to Trump as well as politically satirical menu items targeting his
  enemies, Beainy’s chain expanded to other locations, including Houston. Trump
  won a second presidency in January, and his administration summarily began
  delivering on promises to pursue mass deportations of immigrants. Political
  supporters of Trump in the US without papers, at least in many cases, have not
  been spared. One case which generated considerable news headlines was that of
  a Canadian national who supported Trump’s plans for mass deportation of
  immigrants – only for federal authorities to detain her in California while
  she interviewed for permanent US residency and publicly describe her in a
  statement as “an illegal alien from Canada”. In another instance, Ice
  reportedly detained a Christian Armenian Iranian woman who lost her legal
  permanent US residency, or green card, after a 2008 burglary conviction and
  incarcerated her at a federal detention facility in California despite her
  vocal support of Trump. Her husband, with whom she is raising four US citizen
  children, subsequently blamed the couple’s plight on Biden’s “doing for open
  borders”, as Newsweek noted. Beainy’s detention by Ice is not his only legal
  plight, according to the Houston Chronicle. He sued the landlord of a Trump
  Burger location in Kemah, Texas, whom Beainy claimed forcibly removed staff
  and took over the restaurant. The landlord responded with his own lawsuit
  accusing Beainy of unpaid debts and renamed the Kemah restaurant Maga Burger.
  In 2022, Beainy told the Houston Chronicle he endured threats to have Trump
  Burger burned down when the first one opened its doors. But the brand had
  since gained a loyal following and a portion of its profits were set aside to
  aid Trump’s fundraising, Beainy said to the outlet. “I would love to have
  [Trump’s] blessing and have him come by,” Beainy said at the time. “We’re
  hoping that he … sees the place.”
