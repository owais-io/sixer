  BBCSO/Lintu review – ​there’s a good reason these Boulez and Mahler works
  aren’t often performed

  In an age of hand-wringing over supposedly populist programming on BBC Radio 3
  and in a Proms season packed with obvious crowd-pleasers, this BBC Symphony
  Orchestra concert seemed designed for the diehards. On the one hand: the
  Mahlerians, drawn by the rare opportunity to hear the composer’s long, early
  cantata Das klagende Lied, a “concert folk tale” based on a text he penned
  aged 17, in the original version he completed at 20. On the other: the
  Boulezians – better catered for than usual in his centenary year – who
  thronged for his Rituel in Memoriam Bruno Maderna, performed by the same
  orchestra who premiered it, with Boulez conducting, in 1975. The fact that
  Boulez also conducted the first Proms performance of Mahler’s Das klagende
  Lied (again with the BBCSO) in 1976 presumably encouraged this Prom’s pairing
  of works. But the juxtaposition did these pieces few favours. In the first
  half, a slimmed-down BBCSO revelled in Boulez’s analogue spatial audio
  effects. Rattles were exchanged on snare drums, cymbals and güiros, like
  enormous snakes facing off across the Royal Albert Hall. There were flurries
  of chirruping woodwind and abrupt, abrasive cadences, snatched into silence by
  conductor Hannu Lintu, who stood almost motionless except for swift,
  absolutely economical gestures. Gongs and tam-tams hung on a vast rack were
  played by two percussionists, two beaters each, their slow dance amid so much
  metalwork strangely compelling. But the work’s fragmentary nature and peculiar
  form made for a long half hour. Mahler’s cantata felt longer still. His score
  offers glimpses of the mature composer to come: surges of symphonic power,
  natty rhythmic corners, beautiful chiaroscuro effects. But there are also
  numerous less persuasive turns of phrase. His teenaged pseudo-folk tale
  meanders repetitively and his text-setting poses real challenges for the solo
  singers. The adults – Natalya Romaniw, Jennifer Johnston, Russell Thomas and
  James Newby – fared better here than the two heftily miked boy choristers, but
  there were nevertheless balance problems throughout. The BBC Symphony Chorus
  and Constanza Chorus injected warmth and vigour and much of the orchestral
  playing was a deluxe, Mahler-in-HD affair. But not even that, alas, could save
  the piece from itself. • Listen again on BBC Sounds until 12 October. The
  Proms continue until 13 September
