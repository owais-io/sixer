  In the introduction to his book The Image of the Architect (1983), Andrew
  Saint wrote: “We are at present in the midst of a widespread transformation of
  ‘architectural history’, with its emphasis on aesthetics, design and
  authorship, into ‘building history’, which has broader social and economic
  preoccupations.” Continuing this shift was his life’s work, and Saint, who has
  died of lymphoma aged 78, also inspired and influenced several generations of
  writers on buildings and their social contexts. His first book was Richard
  Norman Shaw (1976), a brilliant monograph on a late Victorian architect –
  effectively a doctoral thesis, begun while he was a lecturer at Essex
  University. The years 1850 to 1914 remained his focus and he had a lifelong
  involvement with the Victorian Society. He completed the book after joining
  the Greater London council (GLC) in 1974 to work on the long-running Survey of
  London project. Originated in 1894, the survey researches London buildings by
  district, and has so far published 55 volumes. The experience of working on
  the survey was formative for Saint, who recalled how Francis Sheppard, then
  its general editor, had recently begun to “treat areas of London in a holistic
  way, drawing urban development, architecture and social and economic history
  together”. In the final decade before the GLC was abolished in 1986, Andrew
  and others from the survey made lasting alliances with members of the
  council’s historic buildings division, then flexing its muscles to win
  conservation battles by the quality of its research and advocacy, notably over
  Covent Garden, which was under threat of redevelopment. Saint’s research then
  took a different turn. Admirers of Stirrat Johnson-Marshall, an architect
  dedicated to public service who died in 1981, were keen to celebrate his
  memory and that of a like-minded generation. Saint accepted the task of
  writing up the story, for which the GLC gave him six months’ leave. Knowing
  individuals such as David and Mary Medd, famous for their role in the
  Hertfordshire schools building programme, gave Saint an exemplar of
  interdisciplinary collaboration through the chain from patronage and
  innovative construction to the grace notes of murals and sculpture. He
  organised public reminiscence sessions at the Architectural Association in
  1984 that reunited many involved in Hertfordshire schools, as well as projects
  such as the Festival Hall, the Alton estate in Roehampton and the rebuilding
  of Coventry. Published in 1986 as Towards a Social Architecture, the resulting
  book showed how technical and humanist aims were integrated in such projects.
  A year later came the first listing of a post-1945 building and the
  instigation of the “30-year rule” that allowed buildings in England to qualify
  for listing on reaching that age. Once the GLC was dissolved, its historic
  buildings division remained under English Heritage. Saint moved across,
  joining old friends such as Robert Thorne, and new recruits, including Elain
  Harwood, Roger Bowdler and Steven Brindle, and setting the pace for the team
  researching threatened buildings. Monday morning team meetings always ended in
  the pub. At the start of the 1990s, the minister for the environment, Baroness
  Blatch, encouraged a more active approach to listing postwar buildings and an
  innovative study programme was established with an expert committee. Martin
  Cherry of English Heritage, who directed the research, said that Saint’s
  “commitment to it was important in providing confidence to senior policymakers
  that it was worthwhile and had substance: his academic reputation helped, but
  also his ability to demonstrate that postwar building, particularly housing
  and schools, was a force for good”. Taking a quote from Auden, A Change of
  Heart, as a title, Saint wrote the text for a pamphlet that launched the
  project in public in 1992. In 1995, he was headhunted for a newly created
  chair at the University of Cambridge School of Architecture, where he
  experienced a less congenial working culture. His belief that architects were
  not as important as they thought themselves was strengthened, and he began
  work on his longest book, Architect and Engineer – a study in “sibling
  rivalry”, published in 2007, that sought to understand their different
  characteristics. At Cambridge, he struggled to persuade colleagues to publish
  for the new Research Assessment Exercise, but became a notable supervisor of
  doctorates, with students including James Campbell and Timothy
  Brittain-Catlin, who have altered the Cambridge course to become more grounded
  and practical in ways he desired. Saint was happy to take voluntary severance
  from Cambridge in 2006. He returned to the Survey of London as general editor,
  invigorating the research and publishing programme by completing work already
  in hand on Clerkenwell and, with colleagues, adding volumes on Woolwich,
  Battersea and South Marylebone. He personally undertook most of the volume on
  Oxford Street before stepping down to half time and then, in 2015, to
  retirement, by which time the survey was being administered by the Bartlett
  School of Architecture at UCL. Saint continued to be active as an author and
  editor, with a book on late Victorian London published in 2021, and editorship
  of the Victorian Society’s journals and its series of monographs. A book on
  Waterloo Bridge and its Surrey side hinterland awaits posthumous publication.
  Born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, Andrew was the younger son of Elisabeth (nee
  Butterfield) and the Rev Arthur Maxwell Saint (known as Max). The family moved
  to Cheltenham, where Andrew went to Dean Close junior school, and then to
  Christ’s Hospital school, Horsham. Andrew relished Latin and Greek, singing
  and playing the cello, while hating sports, and made strong friendships. His
  interest in architecture came from “church crawling” with his parents, from
  the Aston Webb buildings of his school, and later from Oxford, where he
  studied classics. When his father became chaplain of Guy’s hospital, he lived
  in London for the first time and loved the abandoned feeling of the Southwark
  riverside. Taking Oxford entrance a year early, he got an exhibition to
  Balliol College, and spent time in Italy at the British School at Rome. A
  master’s degree at the Warburg Institute in London on Ruskin led to his first
  part-time teaching job in the art department at Essex University. From the
  early 1970s until the late 80s, Saint was the partner of Ellen Leopold, an
  American architect and academic, and they had two daughters, Lily and
  Catherine. After the relationship ended, Ellen, Lily and Catherine settled in
  the US, while Saint remained in London, living in a Duchy of Cornwall terrace
  house in Kennington. He had another daughter, Leonora, from a relationship
  with Annachiara Cerri. In later life, his partner was the Dutch art historian
  Ida Jager. He is survived by Ida and his daughters. • Andrew John Saint,
  architectural historian, born 30 November 1946; died 16 July 2025 • This
  article was amended on 17 August 2025. The 1983 book by Andrew Saint was
  entitled The Image of the Architect, rather than The Idea of the Architect.
