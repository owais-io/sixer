  When I walk into the house with the dog ahead of me, I already know what I’m
  going to say when my wife asks, “How was that?” I’m going to say: “It was just
  awful.” But my wife isn’t in the house; she’s in the garden weeding, and only
  briefly looks up when the dog starts circling her. In the end, I have to go
  out there and stare at a bush. “Lots of weeds,” my wife says. I stare, and say
  nothing. “What’s wrong with you?” she says. My prepared answer does not fit
  this question; I’m obliged to improvise. “I don’t want to talk about it,” I
  say, stepping into my office shed and shutting the door. The thing I don’t
  want to talk about is an incident with another dog, on a nearly deserted patch
  of open scrubland. Possibly I should have seen it coming; the other dog was
  small, and small dogs have a way of going on the offensive early, before
  suddenly changing their minds. But we had already given this dog, and the
  couple who owned it, a wide berth. At this point they were just dots on the
  horizon, and I was throwing our dog’s ball in the other direction. Our dog ran
  after it and brought it back, over and over. “And then she suddenly drops the
  ball and hares off toward them,” I tell my wife eventually. “From, like,
  almost a football pitch away.” What our dog saw, even from that distance, was
  another ball being thrown. She is a thief of balls, but people are mostly
  understanding about this. “I could see she was being friendly with the little
  dog, if a little too interested in the ball,” I say. “And so I started
  trudging over there. I was about halfway when the whole thing kicked off.” The
  dogs were barking and running in tight circles and the woman was screaming and
  the man was swearing. It’s the kind of chaotic scene you sometimes see from a
  distance in a park and think: I’m glad that has nothing to do with me. “How
  bad did it get?” my wife says. “At that point I was running, so I couldn’t
  really see,” I say. By the time I caught hold of the dog’s collar, it was
  over. The woman checked her dog for injuries – it had none – while I
  apologised profusely, and probably still insufficiently. “She’s been so well
  behaved,” my wife says. “This was not the time to bring that up,” I say. I
  spend the rest of the afternoon in my office, even though it’s a Saturday. The
  incident has opened up a big gulf between how I am and how I wish to seem, and
  I figure I will just sit there until the gulf closes up again, even if that’s
  never. But then I get hungry. “All year I’ve been experiencing bouts of
  anxiety,” I say, opening the fridge. “I’ve noticed,” my wife says. “Which I
  put down to some combination of stress, grief, ageing and the general tide of
  world events. But now I think it’s just from having a dog.” It’s been a whole
  year of worrying the dog will run off, or get kidnapped, or eat something
  poisonous, or be carried out to sea, or leap off a cliff in pursuit of a
  grasshopper, or lose a fight with another dog, or win one. “Anyway, I’ve
  ordered a muzzle,” my wife says. A pause follows. “That seems a bit drastic,”
  I say. “I know, but I can’t have you going on like this,” she says. For a long
  moment, I think the muzzle is for me. “Fine,” I say, trying to imagine how
  walking a dog with a muzzle will make me feel. And more importantly, how it
  will make me seem. The next day, the muzzle arrives in the post. My wife takes
  it out of the package in front of me. “It’s supposed to be a soft one,” she
  says, holding it up. “But it doesn’t look very nice.” “The thing is,” I say,
  “she doesn’t actually bite.” “You were the one who went on and on about how
  awful it was,” she says. “I suppose I was mostly worried about how I came out
  of it,” I say. “Anyway, we have it in case,” she says, putting the muzzle in a
  drawer. We both look at the dog lying on the sofa, one open eye staring back
  up at us. The dog’s tail thumps twice against the cushion. “It would never
  have happened if I was there,” my wife says. “Here we go,” I say.
