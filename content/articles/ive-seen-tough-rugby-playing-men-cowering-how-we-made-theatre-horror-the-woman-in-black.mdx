  Susan Hill, novelist When my first daughter was five, I asked a friend’s
  daughter, who was a medical student, to look after her in the summer holiday
  so I might get something written. I had limited time before my daughter went
  back to school and having that deadline was a very good thing. I’d always
  liked ghost stories – MR James and so on – but they were always short. Many
  are unsatisfactory because they have a buildup, then scramble to an end, and
  that’s it. I thought there ought to be more than that. But it is hard to
  sustain tension and fear over a longer book. You can’t just have somebody
  being terrified every chapter. I made a list of the essential ingredients,
  beginning with a ghost. I remember writing down “weather”: I loved reading
  ghost stories that began in foggy conditions. The setting then had to be
  isolated, a place where nobody would talk about this thing – a conspiracy of
  silence. I always write by hand. The medical student said: “My sister’s doing
  a typing course and is looking for things to type.” I sent her the first few
  chapters but she came back saying her sister couldn’t read my handwriting. She
  suggested a Dictaphone so I bought a cheapo recorder and read into that. Then
  she came back and said: “My sister says it’s going to be a bit slow because
  she is too frightened to do it when she is alone in the house.” That sister
  was Jane Tranter, who went on to be controller of drama commissioning at the
  BBC. She still remembers it. She said: “I could not listen to it because your
  voice got very sinister when it was reading certain bits.” The book was
  published in 1983 and the play opened four years later in Scarborough, where I
  was born and brought up. The adaptation complemented the book: in a small
  theatre, it’s like you are the reader alone in the house. I’ve occasionally
  sat at the back of the theatre at a matinee and watched these inner-London
  boys of 16 with a look on their faces that says: “Go on then – frighten me.”
  It takes about 10 minutes and then they all start clutching each other. They
  change completely. Robin Herford, director In the late summer of 1987, I was
  working at the Stephen Joseph theatre in Scarborough while Alan Ayckbourn was
  away at the National. I got to the end of my second year and found I had
  £5,000 of the budget left. I thought I’d do an extra show over Christmas and
  figured a ghost story might be a good idea. We had enough money for four
  actors and we could do it in the bar, where you can get 70 seats in. Stephen
  Mallatratt, the resident playwright, wasn’t terribly impressed by my idea but
  he came back a few days later and said: “Have you read The Woman in Black?”
  I’m a wimp as far as horror is concerned, but this was a human story about a
  woman who was forced to give up her baby. I was blown away by it, but it had
  15 characters. “You haven’t been listening, Stephen!” I told him. He said:
  “I’ve had an idea about that. I might even be able to give you some change.”
  He proceeded to write an adaptation for three actors: Jon Strickland, Dominic
  Letts and Lesley Meade. The designer, Michael Holt, came up with the idea of
  using gauze: if you light it from one side you can’t see through it, but from
  the other, it’s transparent. It gave us one of the first rough-magic tools.
  It’s embarrassingly simple. You can do an extraordinary amount with very
  little. I commandeered the bar’s kitchens for my five Revox reel-to-reel tape
  machines, so we could do the sound without hearing “clunk, click”. We sold out
  almost immediately. I put in extra midnight performances and there was quite a
  buzz about it. It’s rare to really frighten a theatre audience, so it
  surprised us in Scarborough when people said: “I didn’t sleep for three nights
  after seeing your show.” A year to the day after opening in Scarborough, we
  had the read-through for the first London production, which opened at the
  Lyric Hammersmith in January 1989. Had I had a decent budget, instead of
  mopping up £5,000’s worth of local authority grant, I could have done a super
  production, but it wouldn’t have engaged the imagination and wouldn’t have run
  at the Fortune theatre in London for 33 years. Since then, it has starred
  actors including Frank Finlay, Edward Petherbridge, Joseph Fiennes and Martin
  Freeman and I’ve seen tough rugby-playing men cowering amid the screams in the
  auditorium. • The Woman in Black is touring from 24 September to 18 April,
  beginning at Storyhouse, Chester
