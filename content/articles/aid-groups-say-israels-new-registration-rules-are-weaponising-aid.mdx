  More than 100 aid organisations working in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank
  have accused Israel of dangerously “weaponising aid” in its application of new
  rules for registering groups involved in delivering humanitarian assistance.
  The letter represents the latest broadside from the international aid
  community against Israel after the EU, Britain and Japan on Tuesday called for
  urgent action to stop “famine” spreading in the Gaza Strip. The letter was
  published as Gaza’s health authority reported continuing deaths from
  malnutrition in the besieged Palestinian territory, and amid threats by Israel
  to take full military control of the coastal strip with reports in Hebrew
  media suggesting the country may be planning to mobilise up to 100,000
  reservists for the new offensive. The letter, signed by organisations
  including Oxfam, Médecins Sans Frontières and Care, was written in response to
  registration rules announced by Israel in March that require organisations to
  hand over lists of their donors and Palestinian staff for vetting. The groups
  contend that doing so could endanger their staff and give Israel broad grounds
  to block aid if groups are deemed to be “delegitimising” the country or
  supporting boycotts or divestment. The registration measures were “designed to
  control independent organisations, silence advocacy and censor humanitarian
  reporting”, they said. The letter added: “This obstruction has left millions
  of dollars’ worth of food, medicine, water and shelter items stranded in
  warehouses across Jordan and Egypt.” On Tuesday, Israel’s ministry for
  diaspora and combating antisemitism said it had revoked the work permits of 10
  NGOs that had applied for authorisations. Under the new rules, which are vague
  and broad-reaching, a team led by the diaspora ministry can refuse
  registration to aid groups if they or their members published calls to boycott
  Israel in the past seven years; if there is “reasonable basis to assume” that
  they oppose Israel’s existence as a Jewish and democratic state; or if they
  “actively advance delegitimisation activities against the state of Israel”.
  The aid groups’ letter said the rules violated European data privacy
  regulations, noting that in some cases aid groups had been given only seven
  days to comply. “Instead of clearing the growing backlog of goods, Israeli
  authorities have rejected requests from dozens of NGOs to bring in lifesaving
  goods, citing that these organisations are ‘not authorised to deliver aid’,”
  the letter added, saying that 60 requests from 29 organisations were denied in
  July citing this justification. Cogat, the Israeli military body in charge of
  humanitarian aid to Gaza, denied the letter’s claims, adding without evidence
  that aid groups were being used as cover by Hamas to “exploit the aid to
  strengthen its military capabilities and consolidate its control”, despite the
  fact that Israel already claims to control 75% of Gaza. The aid groups
  stressed on Thursday that most of them had not been able to deliver “a single
  truck” of life-saving assistance since Israel implemented a blockade in March.
  The vast majority of aid is not reaching civilians in Gaza, where tens of
  thousands of people have been killed, most of the population has been
  displaced and famine is taking hold. UN agencies and a small number of aid
  groups have resumed delivering assistance, but say the number of trucks
  allowed in remains far from sufficient. The letter was published as Israel’s
  far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, backed plans for a major
  settlement development outside Jerusalem, which he said would represent the
  “final nail in the coffin” of Palestinian ambitions for their own state. The
  E1 settlement plan for more than 3,000 housing units – which critics,
  including much of the international community, say would split the West Bank
  from occupied East Jerusalem – is highly likely to be approved by a planning
  body next week. But it still remains uncertain whether the plan, which has
  been frozen for more than five years, will advance, given the likely
  international fallout. While his support for the plan was announced by
  Smotrich at a press conference on Thursday, it remains uncertain how much
  backing it has from the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, as does
  the attitude of Donald Trump’s White House. Smotrich’s comments come after
  many countries said they would recognise a Palestinian state in September.
  “This reality finally buries the idea of a Palestinian state, because there is
  nothing to recognise and no one to recognise,” said Smotrich, whose extremist
  party has experienced a collapse in support.
