  A New York woman has found a 2.30-carat colorless diamond in an Arkansas state
  park and repurposed it as her engagement ring. Micherre Fox, 31, of Manhattan,
  New York, went on a month-long hunt in July to the state’s Crater of Diamonds
  state park to search for gems and came up lucky on the last day, according to
  Arkansas state parks. “Having never seen an actual diamond in my hands, I
  didn’t know for sure, but it was the most ‘diamond-y diamond’ I had seen,” Fox
  told the park service. The service said it was the third largest of 366
  diamonds found in the park this year. It describes the Crater of Diamonds – a
  37-acre, eroded surface of a volcanic crater near Murfreesboro, as “the only
  place in the world where the public can search for real diamonds in their
  original volcanic source”. “Any rock or mineral you find is yours to keep,” it
  says. “You may bring your own mining equipment to search with (no
  battery-operated or motor-driven mining tools allowed), or rent tools from the
  park.” Waymon Cox, assistant superintendent of the park, said Fox’s digging
  story “highlights the fact that, even when putting forth your best effort,
  being in the right place at the right time plays a part in finding diamonds”.
  Fox’s story comes with a message of self-determination. She decided two years
  ago that she wanted to find her own diamond for an engagement ring, telling
  the park service that “there’s something symbolic about being able to solve
  problems with money, but sometimes money runs out in a marriage. You need to
  be willing and able to solve those problems with hard work.” Her partner, and
  presumably prospective husband, was supportive of the project. “I was willing
  to go anywhere in the world to make that happen,” Fox said. “I researched, and
  it turned out that the only place in the world to do it was right in our back
  yard, in Arkansas.” When she spotted something glistening at her feet, Fox
  thought it could be a dew-covered spiderweb. But she soon realized it was a
  shiny stone. The park identified it as a diamond. “I got on my knees and
  cried, then started laughing,” she said. Most of the diamonds found in the
  volcanic crater are white, brown and yellow. In total, more than 75,000
  diamonds have been unearthed there since diamonds were discovered in 1906. The
  largest discovered, at 40.23 carats, is named Uncle Sam, and now sits on
  display in the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History. The
  dig-your-own/bring-a-trowel trend may catch on as a signal of commitment,
  since the allure of diamonds is on the rocks. Lab-grown diamonds, created in
  plasma reactors, have badly damaged the natural diamond market, the Guardian
  reported earlier this year. Prices for both, lab-grown and natural, are
  falling fast and show no signs of stopping. De Beers, the biggest name in
  diamonds, said it began 2024 with a huge $2bn stockpile of diamonds and had
  not managed to shift it by the year’s end. The company has cut production in
  its mines by 20%, and its owner, Anglo American, has put it up for sale.
