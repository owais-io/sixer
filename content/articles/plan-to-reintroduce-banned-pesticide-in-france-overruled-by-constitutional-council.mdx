  Plan to reintroduce banned pesticide in France overruled by constitutional
  council

  France’s top constitutional authority has ruled against the reintroduction of
  a pesticide that is harmful to ecosystems, saying it is unconstitutional. The
  decision on Thursday night deals a blow to the government. It comes after
  weeks of opposition from the left, environmentalists and doctors, and a
  record-breaking 2m signatures on a petition against a bill that would have
  allowed a pesticide banned in France in 2020 to come back into use. The
  “Duplomb law” – named after the conservative lawmaker Laurent Duplomb who
  proposed it – had been presented in parliament as a bid to free up French
  farmers, who have repeatedly expressed frustration over bureaucratic
  constraints on the agricultural sector, unfair foreign competition, and what
  they called stringent regulations, including on pesticides. But in a rebuke of
  the government on Thursday night, the constitutional council found that the
  law’s provision to reintroduce acetamiprid – a chemical known to be toxic to
  pollinators such as bees – did not abide by France’s environmental charter,
  which guarantees the “right to live in a balanced and healthy environment”.
  The constitutional authority also raised questions over provisions for water
  reservoirs in the bill. The president, Emmanuel Macron, had “taken good note
  of the decision”, his office said on Thursday night, and was expected to
  swiftly validate the bill without these contested sections. The Green leader,
  Marine Tondelier, said she was “very relieved” by the verdict. The Socialist
  party said the verdict was a rebuke to the “irresponsibility of the prime
  minister, François Bayrou, and his government”. The insecticide in question
  was particularly sought after by beet and hazelnut growers, who said they had
  no alternative against pests and faced unfair competition. Some growers also
  argued that acetamiprid, allowed in other EU countries, was vital to fight
  virus yellows, which cut yields by 30% in 2020 and slashed sugar output. The
  petition on the website of France’s lower-house National Assembly called the
  measure a “frontal attack on public health”. Beekeepers have described the
  chemical as “a bee killer”, and its effects on humans are also a source of
  concern, though its risk remains unclear in the absence of large-scale
  studies. The student-led petition against the bill garnered more than 2m
  signatures after lawmakers adopted its reintroduction on 8 July, when it was
  rushed through a deeply divided lower house of parliament without a proper
  debate. Agence France-Presse contributed to this report
