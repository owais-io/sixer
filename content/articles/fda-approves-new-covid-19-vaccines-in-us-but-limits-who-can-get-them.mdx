  The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved updated Covid-19
  vaccines but has placed new restrictions on who can get them. The agency has
  authorized Covid vaccines for people 65 and older, who are known to be more at
  risk from serious illnesses from Covid infections. Younger people, though,
  will only be eligible if they have an underlying medical condition that makes
  them particularly vulnerable. This means that the upcoming fall and winter
  seasons will be the first where the US government hasn’t recommended
  widespread Covid vaccinations. Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US health secretary,
  said in a post on Twitter/X that Covid vaccine “mandates” under Joe Biden are
  now rescinded and that the vaccines will be available to those at high risk.
  For children, Kennedy said that the Moderna vaccine is approved for those
  older than six months, the Pfizer vaccine for those older than five years and
  the Novavax shot for those older than 12. “These vaccines are available for
  all patients who choose them after consulting with their doctors,” Kennedy
  said in his social media post. “The American people demanded science, safety,
  and common sense. This framework delivers all three.” Kennedy, who previously
  founded an anti-vaccine group, has long questioned the proven benefits of
  vaccines and spread unfounded concerns about their safety. As health
  secretary, Kennedy has cut $500m in funding for flu and Covid vaccines and his
  agency has started to ague that the risks of Covid shots outweigh the
  benefits. Vinay Prasad, the administration’s top vaccine regulator, has
  overruled career scientists to limit Covid vaccine approvals, including for
  Moderna’s vaccine, several times in recent months. Earlier this month, the
  Guardian revealed that the FDA was considering not renewing Pfizer’s Covid
  vaccine for young children, which would have removed the only remaining such
  vaccine for children under five. In recent years, rates of vaccine use have
  dropped in the US, to about 23% of all adults and 13% of people under the age
  of 18, according to the Centers for Disease Control. While proponents of
  vaccine restrictions argue that only those most at risk should get shots,
  critics point out that children can still get seriously sick from Covid. “Our
  healthcare system is now solidly anti-children and anti-science,” Fatima Khan,
  co-founder of the Protect Their Future group, which advocates for vaccine
  access for children, told CNN. “The data are clear: young children –
  especially infants – remain highly vulnerable to severe illness and
  hospitalization from Covid-19. By restricting access to safe, evidence-based
  vaccines, federal leaders are choosing ideology over science.”
