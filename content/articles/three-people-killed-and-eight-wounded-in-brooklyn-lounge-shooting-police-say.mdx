  Three people were killed and eight others wounded when multiple gunmen opened
  fire inside a crowded Brooklyn hookah lounge and restaurant early on Sunday
  morning, according to authorities. Police officers responded to reports of a
  shooting inside the Taste of the City lounge in Crown Heights just before
  3.30am, the New York police department (NYPD) commissioner, Jessica Tisch,
  said at a press briefing later on Sunday. Citing a preliminary, ongoing
  investigation, Tisch said it appeared the shooting stemmed from gang violence.
  The three people who were killed were all men and were all pronounced dead at
  the scene. They were ages 19, 27 and 35, police said. Attributing the
  information to friends, the New York Daily News identified one of those slain
  as 35-year-old Jamel Andre Childs. Childs was killed while trying to stop a
  fight that preceded the shooting, the Daily News reported. Of 11 victims,
  Tisch added, eight were men and three were women. Their known ages ranged from
  27 to 61. The eight wounded victims – five men and three women – were taken to
  local hospitals with what police said were non-life-threatening injuries.
  Tisch said there were at least four different shooters who fired dozens of
  rounds in the lounge, striking numerous bystanders. She also said officers had
  collected at least 42 shell casings inside the lounge that came from 9mm and
  .45-caliber guns. Officers had recovered one gun near the scene of the
  shooting, and they were trying to determine whether it was connected to the
  case, Tisch said. Investigators did not immediately name any suspects or
  announce arrests. Tisch made it a point to say New York City had registered
  “the lowest number of shooting incidents and shooting victims seven months
  into the year … on record”. Nonetheless, “it’s a terrible thing that’s
  happened”, she said. “It’s a terrible shooting,” Tisch added. “There’s no
  other way to describe it.” “I can easily stand here and tell you that we have
  driven down crime, that we have removed over 2,000 illegal guns off our
  streets,” New York’s mayor, Eric Adams, said at a briefing. “I can give you
  those numbers and those stats. But that does not comfort those who are victims
  of gun violence.” Taste of the City Lounge, located less than a half mile from
  the historic Brooklyn Museum serves American and Caribbean plates with a full
  bar, hookah and DJs. The business opened three years earlier and was the scene
  of another shooting in November 2024. That earlier case was non-fatal. The
  typically Jewish and West Indian area where the shooting occurred has been
  undergoing rapid gentrification in recent years. In 2017, a bar advertising
  its “bullet-ridden” wall caused outrage, with residents accusing the owner of
  insensitive stereotyping that overlooked the realities and toll of gang
  violence. As of Sunday, there had been more than 270 mass shootings in the US
  this year – or 1.18 a day, according to the non-partisan Gun Violence Archive.
  The online resource defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more
  victims are wounded or killed. The US’s perennially high rates of such
  shootings have prompted calls from some in the country for more substantial
  gun control. But Congress has largely been unable or unwilling to heed those
  calls.
