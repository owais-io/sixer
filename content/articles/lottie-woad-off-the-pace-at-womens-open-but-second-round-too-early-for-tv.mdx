  It might even have been a relief to the organisers of this Women’s Open that,
  as shadows lengthened, Lottie Woad did not blast her way towards the front of
  the queue. Woad may well be the name on everyone’s lips but, on day two, she
  will barely feature on anybody’s screens. Perhaps it is a sign of this major’s
  rapid growth that everyone wants more. Nonetheless, fans will find it
  unsatisfactory that, with daily television coverage beginning at noon, Woad –
  plus Nelly Korda and Lydia Ko – will play the vast majority of her second
  round minus the eyeballs of anyone not in attendance at Royal Porthcawl. This
  is now a recurring theme after Leona Maguire took to social media to point out
  her hole in one at the recent Evian Championship was not caught on camera.
  Woad begins day two at 8.09am, with Ko for company and Korda two groups
  behind. Sky Sports, which screens the Women’s Open in the UK, has a
  partnership with the R&amp;A which it understandably will not compromise by
  criticising this tournament’s officials. Insiders at the broadcaster insist
  they would be keen on extended live hours from next year. For that to happen,
  the R&amp;A would need to bestow significant funds on European Tour
  Productions, which provides a world feed for television companies to use. At
  Porthcawl, that coverage begins at 12 o’clock. The R&amp;A did increase the
  prize fund for 2025 by $250,000 (£190,000) and player facilities are a notable
  upgrade on the vast majority of women’s golf events; but what of seeing it to
  be it? The men’s Open coverage at Royal Portrush two weeks ago began at 6.30am
  on Thursday and Friday. In the toughest of Thursday’s conditions Woad signed
  for a level-par 72. The highlight of the 21-year-old’s day was a birdie putt
  from off the green at the 6th. Another birdie, at the last, ensured she sits
  five from the lead. “It was OK, a bit mixed,” Woad said. “It was one of those
  rounds that could definitely have got away from me so I am happy with the way
  I hung in there.” Mimi Rhodes has won three times on this year’s Ladies
  European Tour, a matter that has been somewhat lost in fevered excitement over
  Woad. Rhodes served the latest notice of her ability with a 69 and can be
  added to the Friday morning blackout list. Ko’s title defence began with a
  one-over-par 73. The New Zealander was harmed by a birdie-free back nine of
  38. Korda’s 70 felt notable. The world No 1 tied second in this event last
  year. Wales’s Darcey Harry and the Australian Minjee Lee were among those to
  match Korda’s score. Japanese golfers otherwise dominate the early
  leaderboard. Eri Okayama and Rio Takeda posted matching 67s to head the field.
  Miyu Yamashita is one adrift, with the three under group including Shiho
  Kuwaki, Mao Saigo and Chisato Iwai. Georgia Hall is minus one. The former
  champion has her fiance, Paul Dunne, on the bag. A decade ago, Dunne led the
  Open Championship at St Andrews before injury and loss of form took hold.
  “That’s more a question for him I think,” said Hall when asked if Dunne will
  return to competitive golf. “Obviously right now he’s not playing and he’s
  just kind of supporting me, which I am very grateful for. He’s a very good
  player. He doesn’t give himself enough credit. Obviously I’m not complaining,
  I feel very lucky to have him with me.”
