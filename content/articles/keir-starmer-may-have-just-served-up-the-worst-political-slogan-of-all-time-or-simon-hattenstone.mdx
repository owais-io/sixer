  “Delivery, delivery, delivery”. That’s what the prime minister promised as he
  announced yet another government reboot, insisted he would get all asylum
  hotels closed “as quickly as possible” and was filmed with the ubiquitous
  union flag in the background. (“Look, I’m the leader of the Labour party who
  put the union jack on our Labour party membership cards,” he boasted.) Let’s
  quote Keir Starmer’s deliverance speech in context: “We are now into phase two
  of the government, which is where we focus on delivery, delivery, delivery and
  start to show what a difference a Labour government really makes.” Which, of
  course, can be happily soundbited as “delivery, delivery, delivery”. That’s
  the thinking, anyway. But if there’s one thing that sums up why Starmer is a
  useless politician, it’s this mantra. You can see what the PM is trying to do.
  He’s echoing Tony Blair – again. “Education, education, education”. The same
  trick. One word repeated three times. Even the same number of syllables, so we
  can chant it from memory. There’s only one problem. “Delivery, delivery,
  delivery” (which he tried out in a practice run last December in Scotland)
  doesn’t mean anything. It’s vacuous nonsense. What’s more, “delivery” is
  almost impossible to remember as a word, let alone a slogan. Not even the Post
  Office could get away with it. (Nor the Royal College of Obstetricians and
  Gynaecologists for that matter). “Delivery, delivery, delivery” might just be
  the worst political slogan of all time. “Education, education, education”
  works because it’s real. We know what education is and think it’s important.
  Most of us don’t know what delivery means, and I reckon the few who do don’t
  actually want it delivered. Take the cuts to Pip by tightening eligibility
  rules or restricting the winter fuel allowance to the poorest pensioners. We
  didn’t want that delivered, so the government had to backtrack earlier this
  year. Or take the demonising of asylum seekers and the suspension of family
  reunion applications. Most traditional Labour voters don’t want that delivered
  either because, as the great Labour peer Alf Dubs said yesterday, the
  government has to argue for morality, rather than try to out-Reform Reform on
  the bigotry front. Dubs’s life was almost certainly saved when he fled Prague
  on the Kindertransport in 1939 and was offered refuge in Britain. Now that
  kind of delivery was something we could be proud of. The sad thing is that
  Starmer is an able man, and was once an admirable lawyer who fought for the
  underdog. But as a politician he is clumsy, leaden-footed and pusillanimous.
  And as a creator of winning catchphrases, he is second to all. Remember
  “security, prosperity, respect”, “secure, protect, rebuild”, “a new
  leadership” or, possibly my favourite, “another future is possible”? No, I
  thought not. And let’s not forget, Starmer is the (staunchly anti-Brexit)
  fella who was convinced he could co-opt the Brexit slogan “take back control”
  and make it his. Hard-right campaigners outside hotels “hosting” asylum
  seekers have shown who really owns that sentiment. Starmer should focus on
  delivering more hope in the decency of British people and embrace the many
  counter-arguments to the anti-migrant gutter rhetoric. Asylum seekers have
  escaped unimaginable horrors. And it is our duty to support refugees under the
  1951 refugee convention. We know as well that migrants boost the economy
  (figures consistently show that overall they pay more tax than they receive in
  benefits), and they fill posts in vital public services (about 20% of NHS
  employees in England are non-UK nationals). If the prime minister did this,
  there may still be time for him to win back some disillusioned Labour
  supporters. But even if he did decide to dedicate himself to delivering the
  moral argument, “delivery, delivery, delivery” would still be a rubbish
  catchphrase. As it is, when he’s applying it to lowest-common-denominator
  politics, it might ring more true sense as “populism, populism, populism” or
  “utterbollocks, utterbollocks, utterbollocks”. Simon Hattenstone is a features
