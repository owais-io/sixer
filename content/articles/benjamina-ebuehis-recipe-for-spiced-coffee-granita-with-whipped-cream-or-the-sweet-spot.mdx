  A low-effort dessert inspired by café de olla, which is a drink I consumed
  daily while on holiday in Oaxaca, Mexico. It’s a black coffee gently spiced
  with cinnamon and cloves, and sweetened with piloncillo (an unrefined sugar).
  Here, I’ve turned it into something refreshing for summer, using dark brown
  sugar instead, not least because it’s easier to find. I can never resist a
  post-dinner coffee, and this scratches both that caffeine and sugar itch.
  Spiced coffee granita with whipped cream Prep 5 min Cook 15 min, plus cooling
  Freeze 2 hr 30 min+ Serves 4 500ml freshly brewed coffee, or espresso 1 stick
  cinnamon 3 cloves 75g dark brown sugar 120ml double cream Pinch of flaky sea
  salt Pour the coffee into a small pan, add the cinnamon, cloves and sugar and
  heat gently until it comes to a simmer. Leave to simmer for five minutes,
  until the sugar dissolves and the mixture starts smelling fragrant. Take off
  the heat, leave to cool completely, then strain into a shallow,
  freezer-friendly container. Freeze the mixture for an hour, then mix it with a
  fork and return to the freezer for 20-30 minutes. Mix again to break up the
  ice crystals, then repeat this process two to three times more, until you have
  lots of crystals. Lightly whip the double cream with a pinch of flaky salt. To
  serve, spoon the granita into small glasses and top each one with a dollop of
  cream.
