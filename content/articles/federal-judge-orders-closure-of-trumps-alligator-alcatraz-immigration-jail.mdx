  A federal judge in Miami late on Thursday ordered the closure of the Trump
  administration’s notorious “Alligator Alcatraz” immigration jail within 60
  days, and ruled that no more detainees were to be brought to the facility
  while it was being wound down. The shock ruling by district court judge
  Kathleen Williams builds on a temporary restraining order she issued two weeks
  ago halting further construction work at the remote tented camp, which has
  attracted waves of criticism for harsh conditions, abuse of detainees and
  denial of due process as they await deportation. In her 82-page order,
  published in the US district court’s southern district of Florida on Friday,
  Williams determined the facility was causing severe and irreparable damage to
  the fragile Florida Everglades. She also noted that a plan to develop the site
  on which the jail was built into a huge tourist airport was rejected in the
  1960s because of the harm it would have caused the the land and delicate
  ecosystem. “Since that time, every Florida governor, every Florida senator,
  and countless local and national political figures, including presidents, have
  publicly pledged their unequivocal support for the restoration, conservation,
  and protection of the Everglades,” she wrote. “This order does nothing more
  than uphold the basic requirements of legislation designed to fulfill those
  promises.” No further construction at the site can take place, she ruled, and
  there must be no further increase in the number of detainees currently held
  there, estimated to be about 700. After the 60-day period, all construction
  materials, fencing, generators and fixtures that made the site a detention
  camp must be removed. The ruling is a significant victory for a coalition of
  environmental groups and a native American tribe that sued the state of
  Florida and the federal government. Williams agreed that the hasty, eight-day
  construction of the jail at a disused airfield in late June damaged the
  sensitive wetlands of a national preserve and further imperiled federally
  protected species. “This is a landmark victory for the Everglades and
  countless Americans who believe this imperiled wilderness should be protected,
  not exploited,” said Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the
  Everglades, one of the groups that filed the lawsuit. “It sends a clear
  message that environmental laws must be respected by leaders at the highest
  levels of our government, and there are consequences for ignoring them.” The
  alliance plans to hold a press conference on Friday morning to discuss the
  ruling in detail. Conversely, the ruling is a blow to the detention and
  deportation agenda of the Trump administration. The president touted the camp,
  which recently held as many as 1,400 detainees, as a jail for “some of the
  most vicious people on the planet”, although hundreds of those held there have
  no criminal record or active criminal proceedings against them. There was no
  immediate reaction to Williams’s ruling from the Florida department of
  emergency management, which operates the jail on behalf of the Immigration and
  Customs Enforcement agency (Ice), or from the Department of Homeland Security.
  But lawyers for the state told Williams in court last week that they would
  appeal any adversarial ruling, the Miami Herald reported. In addition,
  hundreds of detainees were moved from “Alligator Alcatraz” to other
  immigration facilities at the weekend in anticipation that Williams would
  order its closure, the outlet said. Ron DeSantis, Florida’s Republican
  governor, announced earlier this month that the state will soon open a second
  immigration jail at a disused prison near Gainesville to increase capacity.
