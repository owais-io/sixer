  dump, critics say

  Critics of Australia’s Aukus submarine deal say the government has given
  itself the power to nominate any place in Australia as a potential nuclear
  waste dump, without proper consultation with communities and Indigenous
  landowners. Australia has agreed to take sole responsibility for the
  management, security and storage of all nuclear waste from its fleet of
  proposed nuclear-powered submarines, including the spent fuel from the
  submarines’ reactors – high-level nuclear waste that will be radioactive for
  millennia once the submarines are decommissioned from the early 2050s. The
  spent fuel is also a nonproliferation risk: Australia’s nuclear submarines
  will run on highly enriched uranium which can be reprocessed to make nuclear
  weapons. The spent fuel will require military-grade security to safeguard it.
  Other navies use low enriched uranium, which cannot be used in a warhead, to
  power their submarines, but requires refuelling every few years. A
  spokesperson for the Australian Submarine Agency said the government was
  “committed to the highest levels of nuclear stewardship, including the safe
  and secure disposal of waste”, and that the “selection of any designated zone
  for high-level waste will be informed by extensive consultation with the
  community and key stakeholders”. Sign up: AU Breaking News email But critics
  argue the Australian naval nuclear power safety bill 2024, passed in October
  last year, is far more broadly drawn, allowing the government to “pick any
  place on a map, then the next day make a nuclear waste dump there”. The Greens
  defence spokesperson, senator David Shoebridge, said Aukus was a “slow-motion
  disaster” that would leave Australia with a toxic legacy for millennia. He
  said the legislation, as passed, failed to protect the rights of communities.
  “This law allows the minister to pick any place on a map, then the next day
  make a nuclear waste dump there. It sounds impossible, but the way the law is
  written could make your neighbourhood, or the defence facility next door, a
  nuclear waste dump almost overnight. “The second this law passed, Perth and
  Adelaide became home to two nuclear waste dumps. The local community was not
  informed, they were not consulted, and they are not being told what is
  happening now.” Shoebridge said the government, instead of learning the
  lessons of previous failed attempts to build a national nuclear waste
  facility, had “decided the best course of action was to make sure the public,
  First Nations people, and environmental groups had no way to protect the
  land”. The legislation, as passed, designates HMAS Stirling off Perth and the
  Osborne naval shipyard in Adelaide as “designated zones” for nuclear
  activities, including storage of radioactive waste: low- and
  intermediate-level nuclear waste from Australia, UK and US submarines will be
  stored there. But the legislation also grants the government the power to
  establish “any other area in Australia that is prescribed by the regulations
  to be a designated zone”. Draft regulations, circulated by the government,
  state the government regulator must be satisfied “that meaningful consultation
  has been undertaken” with communities, Indigenous landowners and the wider
  public, over a proposed nuclear waste facility. But the legislated new
  Australian Naval Nuclear Power Safety Regulator will sit within defence,
  answerable to the defence minister, raising concerns over the independence of
  the proposed new body. The law was amended last year to prohibit the US and UK
  dumping high-level radioactive material – such as spent fuel or irradiated
  nuclear reactors – in Australia. But both countries will dispose of low- and
  intermediate-level nuclear waste from their nuclear submarines in Australia.
  Former South Australian senator Rex Patrick, an ex-submariner and Aukus
  critic, is currently waging a freedom of information battle in the federal
  court to get access to a November 2023 defence department report – examining
  potential sites for a nuclear waste site – but to which he has been refused
  access. Patrick said his opposition to Aukus was related to the project’s cost
  – at last estimate $368bn – and the increasing risk it would fail, and leave
  without the Australia the naval defences it required. “But I also am
  frustrated by the fact that they haven’t costed this thing out from cradle to
  grave. The $368bn that has been allocated to this project does not include the
  nuclear waste storage and disposal, and there has been no attempt to explain
  to the Australian people how this is going to work.” Patrick said the secrecy
  surrounding the Aukus details, and the lack of parliamentary and public
  discussion around the agreement, meant that critical details were being kept
  from the Australian people, undermining public confidence and the project’s
  social licence. “The government has had a roadmap for Aukus for a long time …
  they are just not telling the Australian public. I’m not asking for the secret
  makeup of the fuel inside a nuclear-powered submarine … I’m simply saying,
  ‘How are they going to dispose of this radioactive nuclear material?’ But all
  of this has been wrapped in secrecy.” Australia currently stores low- and
  intermediate-level waste from medical, laboratory and research use: but there
  is no permanent storage facility. Successive Australian governments have
  wrestled with how and where to dispose of nuclear waste for nearly three
  decades without finding a permanent solution. Since 1998, governments have
  proposed three separate sites – Woomera and Kimba in South Australia, and
  Muckaty Station in the Northern Territory. In each case, fierce opposition
  from local communities and Indigenous landowners saw the proposal rejected and
  abandoned. Defence officials told parliament in 2020 that an evaluation of
  four possible sites on defence land found none were suitable. “The defence
  assessment determined that the siting of the National Radioactive Waste
  Management Facility at any of the four sites identified in the request could
  not be achieved,” officials said in evidence to the Senate. As far back as
  2004, released cabinet documents show, the Howard government noted “there is a
  pressing need to make progress on establishing a radioactive waste management
  facility”. Cabinet agreed to make “field assessments [of] Christmas Island, as
  the preferred location, and two onshore locations (Pine Gap and Tindal Royal
  Australian air force base and related locations in the Northern Territory,
  with a preference for the related locations). The “related locations” were not
  specified. In March 2023, the defence minister, Richard Marles, said the
  nuclear reactors from decommissioned nuclear submarines would be stored on
  “defence land, current or future”, raising the prospect that a site could be
  identified and then declared “defence land”. Marles said “we will, within the
  next 12 months, establish a process” for identifying a nuclear waste storage
  site that would be “remote from populations”. That process has not yet been
  established. A spokesperson for the Australian Submarine Agency said the
  disposal of high-level radioactive waste would not be required until the
  2050s, when Australia’s first nuclear-powered submarine is expected to be
  decommissioned. “Selection of any designated zone for high-level waste will be
  informed by extensive consultation with the community and key stakeholders.
  “Intermediate and high-level waste, including spent nuclear fuel, will be
  stored and disposed on the current or future defence estate.” There is
  currently no permanent storage facility anywhere in the world for permanent
  high-level nuclear waste storage. The US and UK, which have run nuclear
  submarines for decades, have still not built permanent storage facilities.
  Finland has spent more than 40 years and more than €1bn building a
  100,000-year underground storage facility which is currently undergoing
  trials.
