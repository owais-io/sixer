  An innovative contest by a city in formerly communist east Germany to curb
  depopulation by offering a fortnight of free housing has stunned local
  officials with its success. The competition drew more than 1,700 applications
  from around the world to try living in Eisenhüttenstadt, a Soviet-style
  planned city on the Polish border, near Berlin, which was built around a steel
  plant in the aftermath of the second world war. “We ourselves were very
  surprised by the reach our Probewohnen (trial living) project has had,” Julia
  Basan, the municipal economic development officer spearheading the campaign,
  told reporters on Thursday. She said those who had thrown their hat into the
  ring since May had “the most wide-ranging motives” including one foreign man
  who simply said he “wanted to marry a German woman”. But the majority were
  “very realistic applications”, Basan said. The two winners, both German
  professionals, will move into spacious furnished flats in the city centre in
  September and be treated to a red-carpet orientation programme. Melanie
  Henniger, a 49-year-old IT consultant and self-described “empty nester” living
  in the north-western city of Bremen, said she had grown up in nearby Frankfurt
  an der Oder and was interested in returning to her eastern roots. “This is a
  great chance to get to know the region again, because otherwise I wouldn’t
  have any opportunities at all as I don’t know anyone there any more,” she
  said. “In the best case scenario, I can put down new roots there again.” The
  other successful applicant, 39-year-old Jonas Brander, is a Berlin-based
  film-maker working on a documentary about Eisenhüttenstadt. “I’m very
  interested in the city and its people and I want to get very close to life in
  my work,” Brander said, adding that he was drawn to its “living history”.
  Eisenhüttenstadt, which is celebrating its 75th anniversary, was the first
  city to be founded – in east or west Germany – after the Nazi period. It was
  built according to a socialist model designed to blend work and family life
  for the good of all. But the years since national reunification in 1990 have
  been hard on the town, which has fewer than half the 53,000 residents it
  counted before the fall of the Berlin Wall. The shrinking and ageing
  population has compounded a skilled labour shortage for local industry, in
  what economists say can easily turn into a death spiral. A palpable sense of
  decline has spurred support for the far-right Alternative für Deutschland
  party, which won nearly 40% of local votes in the February general election.
  The strength of the anti-migrant, anti-Islam party in many east German regions
  is often cited as a deterrent to new residents, especially highly qualified
  people from abroad. However, Basan said the programme had allowed
  Eisenhüttenstadt to put its best foot forward, touting its renovated and
  affordable neoclassical housing, verdant surroundings perfect for swimming and
  cycling, and plentiful childcare and work opportunities. “We even had one
  family, from another European country, who heard about us via the Probewohnen
  programme and are moving here on their own steam. They’ve already signed a
  work contract with a local company,” she said. “They did it all themselves and
  we’re just thrilled.”
