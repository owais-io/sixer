  medal ambitions

  ‘I feel OK,” says Kirsty Muir. “It’s slightly overwhelming but somehow
  strangely feels normal.” The air at the Team GB media summit in Edinburgh
  crackles with a familiar Olympic buzz. Athletes from across winter disciplines
  navigate the bustling hall as they complete their press duties to mark six
  months until the 2026 Games in Italy. Some pass the time with a game of rock,
  paper, scissors, a fleeting moment of levity during the interviews and
  photoshoots. For many seasoned competitors this media cycle is a well-worn
  path, but for the Scottish freestyle skier the experience is distinctly new.
  Despite her debut at Beijing 2022 as a 17-year-old, the pandemic cast a shadow
  over the experience, transforming it into something far removed from the
  traditional Olympic spectacle. “I feel like this is my first proper Games
  because last time it was during Covid,” she says. “All my interviews were on
  Zoom so I’ve not done this. “There’s so much that is different this time. Last
  time I was still in school, so that was taking up a big part of my focus. I’ve
  finished school now, have had a few more results under my belt and been
  progressing in my skiing. I feel like I will get the whole Olympic experience
  this time. “I was also very shy and since then I’ve come out of my shell. I
  feel I belong more in the sport, have a place in it. I feel it’s a lot cooler
  than when I was 17.” Muir’s journey to elite freestyle skiing began early with
  her time in Beijing, but the pervasive Covid restrictions created an
  environment that felt isolating. The unconventional start, she says, may have
  reduced the external pressure as she received much fanfare for finishing
  eighth in the slopestyle final. “You always hear stories about the Games and I
  was there with other athletes that had been to them before so they were always
  telling me about what was missing,” she says. “You could tell it was
  different. We were all in one village but there wasn’t as much mingling as
  usual. Each morning you got up and you straight away got a swab up your nose
  before you even went to breakfast. “But the positive was that there wasn’t
  much pressure. Or as much pressure as I think there will be this time around.
  I just did the best I could and ended with a pretty good finish for a
  debutant.” Wanting to continue her upwards trajectory, Muir continued to
  compete, but tore an anterior cruciate ligament, sustaining meniscus damage
  during a Big Air final in December 2023 where, remarkably, she still managed
  to secure a bronze medal despite feeling a “niggle” in her knee. That led to
  surgery in January 2024. Separately, she needed shoulder surgery two months
  later, leading to a full year of intensive rehabilitation. “I didn’t know I’d
  done the injury until I had the MRI,” she says. “I could have had that for a
  long time. Initially, I just completely broke down into tears. It’s quite a
  common one in our sport, but it’s one of the longest injuries you can face and
  I was shocked.” Not only was the timing of the setback frustrating, occurring
  when she was demonstrating peak performance and consistency, but the fact that
  her body was still changing and growing made it all the more frustrating for
  him. At moments she felt as if she had to relearn the most basic of movements.
  “I was really trying to celebrate the little goals. When you’re on crutches
  for a few weeks, getting back to normal walking, that’s a success. When you’re
  getting in the gym and you’re back to doing squats – even if it’s body weight
  – that’s a success. “I was trying to have fun with it in that way. It’s a
  difficult time and there’s no way around that, but I was just trying to be
  positive. “During my injury I set a goal to grow myself personally as well as
  get back to the sport and I did that. I learned a bit more about what I need
  and what my body needs as it continues to mature. “Everyone’s different. Some
  people can have months of pressure. Some people need a break and it’s just
  about learning those sorts of behaviours. You have to listen to your body. My
  body did a lot of growing up in the last few years.” Most athletes would
  expect a grace period after a year out of action, but Muir’s return to the
  World Cup circuit in January 2025 was immediately successful, as she qualified
  for finals in her first competition back. Two months later, she secured her
  first World Cup gold medal in slopestyle in Tignes, her first top-three finish
  since 2023. “No matter what injury you have you can sometimes think, ‘Will I
  come back strong? Will I come back the same?’ Especially for someone that
  overthinks a bit like I sometimes do, you always just have those doubts. “So
  winning gold did eliminate those doubts because I felt I didn’t just come
  back, I came back stronger. That was my goal. I knew for sure that I could
  trust myself and trust my knee. I had the muscle memory, I worked hard and I
  just had to trust myself in that moment. I am still working on finding that
  peace and trusting myself every time I am at the top of the slope.” But now
  the big test is approaching. Can she find the same Zen at Milano Cortina 2026?
  “The goal is to win a medal. That’s why I am going. I just really want to take
  it all in. This time, it’ll be the real thing. So I really want to just push
  myself, take everything I can from the experience and have a good time.”
