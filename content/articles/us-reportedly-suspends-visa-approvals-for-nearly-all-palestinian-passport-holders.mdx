  The United States has suspended visa approvals for nearly everyone who holds a
  Palestinian passport, the New York Times reported on Sunday. The restrictions
  go beyond those Donald Trump’s administration had previously announced on
  visitors from Gaza. They would prevent Palestinians from traveling to the
  United States for medical treatment, attending college and business travel,
  the newspaper reported, citing unidentified officials. The state department
  said two weeks ago that it was halting all visitor visas for individuals from
  Gaza while it conducts “a full and thorough” review, a move that has been
  condemned by pro-Palestinian groups. On Friday, the US began denying and
  revoking visas from members of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and
  Palestinian Authority (PA) in advance of the UN assembly meeting in September,
  the state department confirmed. Under an agreement as host of the UN in New
  York, the US is not supposed to refuse visas for officials heading to the
  world body for the general assembly, but the state department said it was
  complying with the agreement by allowing the Palestinian mission to attend.
  “The Trump administration has been clear: it is in our national security
  interests to hold the PLO and PA accountable for not complying with their
  commitments, and for undermining the prospects for peace,” the state
  department said in a statement. The new measure further aligns the Trump
  administration with Israel’s rightwing government, which adamantly rejects a
  Palestinian state. Jason Burke contributed reporting
