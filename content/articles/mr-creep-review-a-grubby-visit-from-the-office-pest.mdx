  The clue is in the fingers. Rubbery, bulbous things, they look as if they
  would leave a trail of slime if they touched you. And they probably want to
  touch you. They belong to Martin, aka Mr Creep, the alter ego of Theodora van
  der Beek, all lank hair, faux leather jacket and grubby 70s aesthetic. To call
  Martin a character would be stretching a point: he does not actually do very
  much in this entertaining show, half lecture, half film screening. He is more
  object than protagonist. He is a symbol of every office pest, every man who
  gets uncomfortably close on public transport, every bloke with a warped sense
  of his sexual attractiveness to younger women. He eats a lot of ham. The show
  is a product of lockdown when the performer and her six-strong household
  decided to throw an office party at home, seeing as none of them had an office
  of their own. They took on roles from intern to boss and Van der Beek came as
  the office creep. Getting to know the enemy, she found Martin, with his
  perfumed breath and poor spatial awareness, strangely compelling. What if she
  could look at the world through his eyes? Now, reading from cue cards, she
  takes us through a series of movies, AI-generated fantasies and TV clips to
  talk about the objectifying lens of the male gaze and men’s almost
  imperceptible encroachments on female space (elsewhere in Edinburgh, Red Like
  Fruit has a similar theme). Some sections are more fully realised than others
  in a show Van der Beek admits is developing all the time, but she has
  inventiveness and eccentric charm to carry her through, not to mention a
  particularly disgusting way with processed meat. The show’s tone is quirky,
  messy and wry, even while its message is on point. At Banshee Labyrinth,
  Edinburgh, until 24 August All our Edinburgh festival reviews
