  The timing could not have been better for Todd Greenberg, the new chief
  executive of Cricket Australia. The month before he settled into his Jolimont
  office in March this year, his associates at the England and Wales Cricket
  Board did him an extraordinary favour. Their process to sell minority stakes
  in teams playing in The Hundred, the short-form franchise cricket competition
  similar to the Big Bash League, raised £520m ($1.06bn). Greenberg – the
  respected former NRL and Australian Cricketers’ Association CEO – followed
  Nick Hockley in the role. But while the position as one of the figureheads of
  Australian sport came with prestige and power, Greenberg was also restricted
  by the actions of his predecessor. The extension of the local broadcast deal
  with Foxtel and Channel Seven was signed by Hockley in 2023 amid strained
  relations between the sport and its free-to-air partner. Whether the roughly
  $215m per year arrangement was fair value or not, Greenberg came into the role
  handcuffed: cricket’s single biggest revenue line item was locked in until
  2031. Seeking options – more so-called “financial levers” – at the start of
  his tenure as CEO, Greenberg acted quickly following the The Hundred sale
  process. Alongside chair Mike Baird, Greenberg commissioned CA’s long-time
  consultants of choice, Boston Consulting Group, to assess the best paths of
  growth for the BBL. The recommendations of that report were revealed on
  Tuesday in the Sydney Morning Herald, and include selling a minority stake in
  the eight BBL teams to private investors. Whether it came from a genuine leak,
  or a plant by CA to test public support for the controversial proposal, the
  news has been hailed by proponents of private investment. Cricket Australia
  addressed the speculation on Wednesday, confirming the recommendations
  included optimising the schedule and increasing the salary cap to attract top
  players, the potential for expansion, and private investment. Baird said
  although “no decisions have yet been made”, work is now under way alongside
  cricket, commercial and broadcast partners “to consider the recommendations on
  how this value can be unlocked”. Player agent and cricket dealmaker, Neil
  Maxwell, believes the opportunity not only provides access to capital but also
  new investors’ business acumen and networks. “It shouldn’t have taken this
  long,” he says. “The BBL has built a decent product, initially it was a second
  mover [after the IPL], and it had that advantage over other leagues, but it
  set itself back by not keeping pace with commercial reality. The major factor
  there is it hasn’t been able to compete internationally through one of the
  main products that people require, and that’s access to the best players.”
  Private equity in the BBL has been considered since 2010, before a ball in the
  new competition had been bowled. At that time, the CA’s head of strategy was
  Andrew Jones, who now works as a management consultant. A decade later, Jones
  wrote an article in The Age describing the period titled: “There is always
  free cheese in a mousetrap”. The “free cheese” in a private equity deal is the
  up-front investment. The “mousetrap” is the money, control and strategic
  flexibility lost forever. Selling BBL stakes to private investors was “the
  single worst idea in my time in cricket,” Jones wrote in 2021. “Not much has
  changed.” Since 2021 however, IPL team valuations continue to rise, and a sale
  of the Gujarat Titans this year pegs the team at around $1.3bn. There has been
  increasing investment in franchise T20 leagues such as those in South Africa
  and the UAE, which compete against the BBL in its traditional summer school
  holiday window. Eric Windholz, associate professor in Faculty of Law at Monash
  University and an expert in sports law says CA “would be derelict in their
  duties” if they were not monitoring these global trends. “It’s only natural
  that the authorities in charge of cricket in Australia are looking at what’s
  happening around the world and properly investigating what are the
  opportunities for cricket here,” he says. But he noted public sentiment
  remained sceptical about private equity’s benefits. “We, the public, feel like
  we own the sport, so whenever we hear about private equity coming in to own an
  asset that we think we own, we obviously have an unease about it,” he says.
  Greenberg appeared to address those who might be uncomfortable with the notion
  with his comments on Wednesday, when he said “any action we take achieves this
  potential and is in the best interests of Australian cricket and cricket
  fans”. Some of that discomfort may be alleviated by the release of more
  information about the proposed BBL deals. Selling 49% of a franchise will be
  too large a share for some states to stomach, even if they retain majority
  control of an entity valued as high as six figures. The franchises will also
  require veto rights over the investors. The Adani Group, which had interest in
  the recent Gujarat Titans sale process, buying a stake in Brisbane Heat is
  unlikely to go down well. But there are also competing views over how any
  capital injection would be spent. Under The Hundred’s sale, 10% of the revenue
  was quarantined for grassroots cricket, with the rest split between the
  counties and the MCC. Much of that money appears set to be used to prevent the
  collapse of some counties, and reduce hundreds of millions of pounds in debt.
  Cricket Australia lost $32m in 2023-24, but its cash reserves are set to rise
  to around $70m after the coming Ashes Tour, largely thanks to the success of
  red ball cricket. At this stage at least, the sport doesn’t need external
  funding to help prop it up. Some within cricket believe a proportion of any
  private equity windfall should be placed in a so-called “future fund” to
  deliver market returns long into the future, or to provide security for the
  next pandemic. Some look at the diversified assets of the NRL, which has
  bought into real estate in recent years, with envy. Others have raised the
  prospect of infrastructure upgrades within the sport. All agree that at least
  some needs to be spent on the BBL, to attract more prominent players and
  improve its global standing. Yet there is concern that cricket’s diverse
  stakeholders may make competing claims on any newfound riches, and turn a
  once-in-a-lifetime investment injection into a short-term sugar hit. Maxwell,
  as a player agent, believes athletes must be better paid, but only as part of
  a broader plan for growth. “It’s not ‘pay the players and then build a
  strategy’, it’s the other way around,” Maxwell says. “The players fill that
  gap and they support that strategy.” Windholz agrees there are positives in
  having an injection of private capital, “but the owners of the private capital
  aren’t doing this out of the goodness of their hearts,” he says. “They want a
  return on their investment, and that’s where the risk lies.”
