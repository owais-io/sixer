  People in the US: share your views on the FDA’s new restrictions on Covid jabs
  for under-65s

  New eligibility rules for Covid-19 vaccines have been authorized by the Food
  and Drug Administration (FDA), with people under 65 only eligible if they have
  an underlying medical condition that makes them particularly vulnerable. The
  move will make the upcoming fall and winter seasons the first time during
  which the US government hasn’t recommended widespread Covid vaccinations since
  the pandemic. It comes as the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, cut
  $500m in funding for flu and Covid vaccines, and his department has questioned
  the safety of mRNA-based vaccines, a technology credited with helping end the
  pandemic and saving millions of lives. We want to hear from you. What are your
  thoughts on the FDA’s updated guidance on Covid vaccines? What could the
  policy change mean for you or your family members this fall and winter? Will
  you now no longer be able to get inoculated? Do you have concerns? If you’re
  having trouble using the form click here. Read terms of service here and
