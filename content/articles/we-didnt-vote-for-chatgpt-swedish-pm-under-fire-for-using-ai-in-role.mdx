  The Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, has come under fire after
  admitting that he regularly consults AI tools for a second opinion in his role
  running the country. Kristersson, whose Moderate party leads Sweden’s
  centre-right coalition government, said he used tools including ChatGPT and
  the French service LeChat. His colleagues also used AI in their daily work, he
  said. Kristersson told the Swedish business newspaper Dagens industri: “I use
  it myself quite often. If for nothing else than for a second opinion. What
  have others done? And should we think the complete opposite? Those types of
  questions.” Tech experts, however, have raised concerns about politicians
  using AI tools in such a way, and the Aftonbladet newspaper accused
  Kristersson in a editorial of having “fallen for the oligarchs’ AI psychosis”.
  “You have to be very careful,” Simone Fischer-Hübner, a computer science
  researcher at Karlstad University, told Aftonbladet, warning against using
  ChatGPT to work with sensitive information. Kristersson’s spokesperson, Tom
  Samuelsson, later said the prime minister did not take risks in his use of AI.
  “Naturally it is not security sensitive information that ends up there. It is
  used more as a ballpark,” he said. But Virginia Dignum, a professor of
  responsible artificial intelligence at Umeå University, said AI was not
  capable of giving a meaningful opinion on political ideas, and that it simply
  reflects the views of those who built it. “The more he relies on AI for simple
  things, the bigger the risk of an overconfidence in the system. It is a
  slippery slope,” she told the Dagens Nyheter newspaper. “We must demand that
  reliability can be guaranteed. We didn’t vote for ChatGPT.”
