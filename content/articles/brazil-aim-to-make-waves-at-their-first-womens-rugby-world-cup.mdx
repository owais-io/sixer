  Sixteen. That is how many Tests Brazil’s women’s rugby union team have played,
  only six more than England played in 2024 alone. The Yaras have recorded five
  wins but one of those was history-making: a first victory against Colombia
  last June that secured qualification for the Rugby World Cup. They will be the
  first South American country at the women’s tournament and the first Brazil
  team, male or female, to compete in rugby’s global showpiece. “It is
  incredible,” says their captain, Eshyllen Coimbra. The remarkable story began
  in 2008 with their first international match. Brazil lost 10-0 to the
  Netherlands in what would be their sole fixture before an 11-year hiatus,
  mainly due to a lack of regional opponents. Brazil’s union focused on women’s
  sevens and rugby league before the 15s team were revived in 2019. One of the
  main reasons for doing so was the potential for World Cup qualification. For
  the 2021 tournament (staged in 2022 due to the Covid-19 pandemic) Brazil were
  beaten by Colombia in a qualifier, the victors going on to lose to Scotland in
  a playoff. However, for the expanded 2025 tournament, South America was
  granted a guaranteed qualification spot. That place was decided in a
  winner-takes-all encounter between Brazil and Colombia. Brazil came away with
  a convincing 34-13 victory in which Coimbra was one of the try-scorers. The
  captain was emotional when the full-time whistle blew, but World Cup
  qualification was not the first thing on her mind. “It was a very unbelievable
  thing to win the game against Colombia because we had about six or seven
  losses before that game, it was the first time we won,” says Coimbra, who has
  a full-time player contract with Brazil and is also studying journalism. “I
  wasn’t thinking about the Rugby World Cup, it was the first win, and I
  couldn’t believe it. “I started to think about the World Cup the next day and
  I just thought: ‘I cannot believe I am in the tournament.’ I’m so glad we made
  it and it is incredible to achieve it.” The playoff was only the second win in
  the team’s history, the first coming against Portugal in December 2023.
  Emiliano Caffera took charge just after the Portugal victory and the head
  coach, who is also in charge of the men’s team, focused on developing the
  players’ skills for the 15-a-side game, with many of the players transitioning
  from sevens. He says: “All of the skills of sevens start the preparation for
  15s. I had to work on the weaknesses which were the scrum, maul, defence and
  kicking game. We really focused there. The scrum-half, the No 10s, didn’t have
  the knowledge of 15s, so we had to start from scratch … that was the key to
  start making that history that we didn’t have.” Many of the squad also bring
  rugby league knowledge. One of the most experienced players is Edna Santini,
  who is poised to become the first player to appear at a Rugby World Cup, Rugby
  World Cup Sevens, Sevens World Series, Olympic Games and a Rugby League World
  Cup. The 33-year-old says: “It is a very important personal milestone. Having
  the opportunity to play each tournament is really meaningful to me. To conquer
  everything with Brazil rugby, it’s so important.” Santini and the rest of
  squad are keen to make it clear they are not at the 2025 tournament just to
  make up the numbers. They want to make an impact, while acknowledging the
  difficulty of their pool. Pool D contains South Africa, Italy and France,
  three opponents they have never played, all of whom will be favourites.
  Positive results may be difficult to come by so what will success look like?
  The message is clear throughout the squad. “It is an opportunity to show the
  Brazilian way to play rugby,” Coimbra says. “We want to do our best, without
  looking at results. We want to surprise people and make people see what Brazil
  rugby is about. Each game there are expectations to play the best rugby we can
  but the main goal is to show Brazilian rugby for the first time.” Santini
  says: “Brazil being in the World Cup is new, we have high expectations in
  terms of doing our best, playing the hardest we can. We want to show we
  trained really hard to represent the Brazil rugby union in the best way we
  could.” Performance and pride in the shirt may be the main objectives but the
  best opportunity for a surprise win will be their opener against South Africa.
  While the Springboks have far more experience, Italy and France are another
  step ahead. Caffera believes his side are capable of causing an upset. The
  46-year-old, who played for Uruguay at the men’s 2003 Rugby World Cup, says:
  “For me it is the game that, if we do all good things and we have an amazing
  day, maybe we can do it. I don’t think it’ll happen against Italy or France.
  But with the weaknesses of South Africa and our strengths, maybe that can be
  the day.” Regardless of results, the coach believes the tournament will hugely
  benefit his squad. He says the experience of playing Tier 1 nations will be
  significant but to continue to progress they need more games. The creation of
  a South American tournament would be the answer for Caffera but he understands
  the challenges – nations such as Argentina and Chile do not have established
  women’s teams. The coach adds: “It’s [about] playing with big countries and
  playing in big tournaments. At the moment we don’t have that and we don’t have
  that on the continent, it’s going to be hard for us growing in the future
  without a 15s tournament. We really need a South American tournament to grow
  this team and grow the young players too. If we want to be a good team in the
  future we need to grow the young players and for me tournaments and games like
  that are key. “WXV [World Rugby’s annual global women’s 15s competition]
  started some things but it is only one tournament for us. We don’t have Six
  Nations, we don’t have a strong club league, we don’t have Super Rugby
  Americas for women, we need to send players to other clubs and countries. That
  is going to be the start because here we don’t have anything. It is going to
  be really hard for World Rugby to give us more games. Players have to go to
  other countries like England, Italy, Spain, USA, New Zealand. We have good
  players, they need to play more.” Brazil will break new ground at this World
  Cup; the next challenge is ensuring it is not their last. This is an extract
