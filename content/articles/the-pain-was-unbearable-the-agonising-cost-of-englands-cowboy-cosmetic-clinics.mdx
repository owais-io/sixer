  Plans to cut down on “cowboy” cosmetic procedures have been introduced by the
  government, meaning that only qualified healthcare professionals will be able
  to perform high-risk treatments. Clinics administering fillers and Botox will
  need to meet strict standards to obtain a licence as part of the Department of
  Health and Social Care proposals to protect people from “rogue operators” with
  no medical training who often provide “invasive” procedures in homes, hotels
  and pop-up clinics. Officials said that people have been left “maimed” by
  beauty procedures, with some deaths linked to poor care. One woman who was
  left with significant injuries after such a treatment told the Guardian she
  had been left with issues that could last a lifetime. Triggs, 40, from Leeds,
  was left with significant bruising and swelling after paying £100 for a fake
  Endolift, a non-surgical laser treatment used for skin tightening and fat
  reduction on the face and body. The laser works by inserting a thin,
  microoptical wire deep into the skin layer, which is used to boost collagen
  and melt little pockets of fat. Triggs said: “I had visited this particular
  clinic before, for other cosmetic treatments such as skin boosters and waxes,
  so I thought I was in safe hands when they offered me a treatment to tighten
  and lift my face. “As soon as the treatment began I knew something was not
  right. The pain was unbearable and the bruising started instantly.” Although
  the procedure was advertised as an Endolift, Triggs received a counterfeit
  version of the treatment, which usually costs about £2,000 when administered
  by a medical specialist. EndoliftX® has said it has seen a 250% rise in
  non-medics administering counterfeit versions of its device over the past
  year. Triggs said: “I was left with significant bruising and swelling which
  lasted months, and I have now just found out that I have post inflammatory
  pigmentation issues which, if not treated by a professional, will last a
  lifetime.” She added: “It is so important to me to warn others about what to
  look for when booking in a treatment, and that undergoing an unregulated,
  counterfeit procedure will more than likely cause much more harm than good.
  Find a trained, well-established professional who has experience in the
  treatment you are looking for and has the knowledge on safety. I am now months
  down the line trying to fix my mistake.” Dr Priya Verma, a registered
  EndoliftX® practitioner and aesthetic doctor, said that alongside a lack of
  regulation within the cosmetic industry, counterfeit laser machines were a
  rising concern. “Increasingly patients are seeking out non-surgical
  facelifting procedures or body-contouring procedures, and actually there’s a
  rise in the ability of people to acquire skin-tightening treatments on
  websites like Alibaba for as little as £400,” Verma said. “They’re fuelling
  the problem further because they are then training other non-medical
  practitioners in how to do these procedures unsafely.” Alice Webb, a
  33-year-old mother of five, is believed to be the first person in the UK to
  die after a non-surgical Brazilian butt-lift procedure last year. Webb, who
  died at Gloucestershire Royal hospital last September, is believed to have had
  a procedure that involved dermal filler being injected into the buttocks. In
  an interview with ITV News, Webb’s partner, Dane Knight, said her death could
  have been avoided if these regulations had come into place sooner. “Knowing
  the risks in the complications, it wouldn’t have happened,” Knight said. “I
  hope something gets put in place before it happens again and another family is
  ripped apart and destroyed. Because it will, if something’s not done sooner
  rather than later.” Knight added: “It’s a shame that it’s taken someone’s life
  for it now to be pushed out and for people in power to start listening and to
  enforce this law to stop other families and other people’s lives being
  destroyed.”
