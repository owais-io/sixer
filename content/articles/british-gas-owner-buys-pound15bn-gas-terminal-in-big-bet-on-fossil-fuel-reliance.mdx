  The owner of British Gas has placed a £1.5bn bet on the UK’s future reliance
  on fossil fuel imports after striking a deal to buy Europe’s biggest gas
  import terminal. Centrica plans to partner with a US private equity firm to
  acquire the Isle of Grain terminal in Kent, which can import 15m tonnes of
  liquefied natural gas a year, even after Britain’s gas demand fell last year
  to its lowest level since the early 1990s. The pair will buy the gas terminal
  from the FTSE 100 energy company National Grid, which in recent years has sold
  off its interests in Britain’s gas infrastructure in favour of investing in
  electricity grids. Chris O’Shea, the chief executive of Centrica, said the
  “strategic asset” would continue to support the UK’s energy security “for many
  decades to come” during the transition to net zero. The deal comes after
  Centrica’s £20bn deal with Norway’s state energy company earlier this summer
  to buy enough gas to meet nearly 10% of the UK’s needs for the next decade.
  Under the agreement, Centrica will buy around 5bn cubic metres of gas from
  Equinor – enough to supply 5m UK homes – every year from this winter until
  2035 at the prevailing market rate. O’Shea has also called on the government
  to support a £2bn project to upgrade its Rough gas storage facility, the
  largest gas store in Britain, as a “very valuable insurance policy” for when
  the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow. Britain’s gas imports tumbled
  by 47% last year to lows not recorded since before the pandemic, despite
  falling homegrown production of North Sea oil and gas, as the overall demand
  for gas slumped to its lowest level since 1992. British households are
  expected to continue using gas for heating and cooking for decades as efforts
  to replace gas boilers with electric heat pumps have struggled to meet the
  government’s goal of installing 600,000 a year. But the electricity sector is
  expected to cut dramatically its reliance on gas power plants in the years
  ahead. The UK has already reduced significantly its use of gas to generate
  electricity owing to a rise in electricity imports from Europe and lower
  energy demand overall. Wind power generated more electricity than gas in 2024,
  contributing 30% of the UK’s power needs against just over 26% from gas plants
  as low carbon generation hit a record high. By the end of the decade, the
  government hopes gas plants will be used as a last resort option in the UK’s
  electricity market and generate just 5% of the UK’s power under its plans to
  create a virtually carbon-free power system. Last month, Centrica struck a
  deal to take a 15% stake in the planned Sizewell C nuclear power plant on the
  Suffolk coast, which is expected to begin operating in the mid- to late 2030s.
