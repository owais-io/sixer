  You know how it is. One moment you’re on a romantic walk in the woods with
  your saintly, supportive husband as he convinces you to stand for election as
  prime minister, the next you are that prime minister (with the shorter but
  still flattering haircut to prove it). You’re knee-deep in a cancer drug
  supply crisis and about to meet with the French president who alone can solve
  your problem, when news arrives that your saintly, supportive husband – who
  is, of course, a doctor with Doctors Without Borders – and his team have been
  abducted by unknown terrorists in French Guiana. What is a Suranne Jones with
  a Netflix budget behind her to do? That is the set-up from which five punchy
  hours – Hostage fully swerves the curse of streamer-bloat – of great,
  globetrotting fun proceeds. Jones is the no-nonsense (in a good way, not a
  Thatcher way) politician-turned-PM Abigail Dalton; Julie Delpy is the icy
  president and master strategist Vivienne Toussaint; and Ashley Thomas is Dr
  Alex Anderson, Dalton’s blameless and soon deeply traumatised husband. Before
  news of the kidnappings arrives, Dalton is hoping to cut a deal with Toussaint
  that will involve the UK taking in a boatful of Ebola-ravaged refugees that
  were refused entry at Calais in return for France giving the UK a large amount
  of lifesaving medicine. Deux political crises averted with une stone, you see.
  Then the terrorists step in and demand as their ransom Dalton’s resignation by
  1pm the next day. I should add that also in the mix are: Abigail and Alex’s
  semi-stroppy daughter Sylvie (Isobel Akuwudike) and Abigail’s dying father Max
  (James Cosmo), both of whom are strongly of the opinion that she should resign
  and bring Alex home; private secretary Kofi Adomako (Lucian Msamati), an
  appointee of the previous government and as yet unsure of his new boss’s
  fitness for purpose; Adrienne Pelletier (Jehnny Beth), the ice queen’s warmer
  and surely trustworthy assistant; and last but decidedly not least,
  Toussaint’s stepson Matheo (Corey Mylchreest), who deplores his stepmother’s
  political shift to the right, and his new girlfriend Saskia (Sophie
  Robertson). Think of them as a quiverfull of arrows ready to be fired the
  moment we need another plot twist, red herring, complication, revelation or
  downright treachery, and always landing on target. Offshore accounts, leaks,
  misplaced and well-placed loyalties abound, with ever-changing political
  considerations and their ramifications woven credibly in. Oh, and did I
  mention that Dalton is considered to have “gutted the military” to fund her
  promises to fix the NHS? Though I’m sure this won’t have repercussions if and
  when she needs their help to rescue her husband and his equally saintly,
  supportive team. The first rescue mission, however, is by the French because
  it is their territory. Alas, it is aborted at the last minute when Toussaint
  receives a very effective blackmail video that threatens her leadership and
  would, if she were ousted, leave the way clear for a truly fascistic candidate
  to stand, which is what her apparent pandering to the right-wing has been
  designed to deflect. Hidden depths, you see, and subtleties. Hostage
  onion-skins its episodes very nicely. It’s a rollicking, propulsive and
  compulsive yarn that also manages to give two great parts to two women of a
  certain age then leaves them to get on with it as characters rather than
  symbols. There is perhaps a little too much of Dalton kicking off her high
  heels in relief every time she’s alone, but other than that the two leaders
  are as unremarkably female as the usual players would be unremarkably male. Of
  course, this shouldn’t still be rare, but it is, and feels refreshing and
  worthy of note. As losses mount, the question of how much a leader should be
  expected to sacrifice for her country comes under greater scrutiny. Does there
  come a point when you have to give in to terrorists? How do you appraise a
  concept like the greater good, which has become so emptied of meaning in
  modern times? And what if the great British public has been baying for your
  blood beforehand? And the sympathy they have for your predicament lasts no
  longer than the next viral video showing the death or suffering of an
  individual unable to procure the drugs they need? Everyone is terrific in
  this, and the budget is well spent on location shoots in French Guiana (or
  somewhere very like it), with Jones doing her usual sterling work as an
  everywoman in extraordinary circumstances. Or at least everywoman as prime
  minister in extraordinary circumstances. I do find myself occasionally wishing
  that she would treat herself and us to a comedy – or something with a comic
  aspect – more often, but when the dramas are this much fast, furious,
  intelligent fun, I suppose we shouldn’t ask for more. • Hostage is on Netflix
