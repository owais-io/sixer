  The wooden walls of the village hall in Charles Town, Jamaica, are adorned
  with a procession of shadowy figures: a tribute to the resistance struggle of
  the Maroons – African people who escaped enslavement and created their own
  free communities in remote and hilly parts of the island. Set in the lush
  embrace of majestic Jamaican hills and mountains, the idyllic settlement is
  quiet, but for the crowing of unseen roosters. Maroon spiritual leader Gloria
  Simms, affectionately called Mama G, warmly greets neighbours as she walks
  towards the hall – hair wrapped, her colourful dress moving with the gentle
  breeze. Simms, who was honoured with the chieftain title of Gaa’mang in
  Suriname, exudes a regal air as she sits among the rows of benches to tell the
  story of her Maroon ancestors. It began on the plantations where people from
  across west Africa were taken in shackles after being kidnapped from their
  homes. Some had stood in markets, while plantation owners examined their
  bodies to determine their value. Some had felt the searing pain of the iron
  brand after purchase. And on the plantations they had witnessed and
  experienced unspeakable horrors that led them to conclude it was better to die
  seeking liberty than to live as a slave. Centuries later, five main Maroon
  communities in Jamaica are still thriving: the Accompong, Charles Town, Moore
  Town, Scott’s Hall and Flagstaff Maroons. Each has at least a few hundred
  residents who follow the customs of their ancestors, such as forms of
  governance, medicinal approaches, music, and cleansing and religious rituals.
  Similar communities survive in other countries, including Suriname, Brazil and
  Colombia. Maroon councils are said to be so effective in managing disputes
  that crime in their settlements is lower than in other parts of Jamaica. They
  also typically do not pay land tax, citing the terms of peace treaties signed
  with the British government in the late 1730s. Mama G is among a group of
  Maroons who have dedicated their lives to preserving and promoting Maroon
  culture – and to pursuing justice for past wrongs. Mama G describes Jamaica’s
  1838 proclamation of the abolition of slavery as “empty words on blank paper”
  that was more beneficial to “oppressors than to the oppressed”, and that
  ensured systemic economic deprivation for the descendants of the enslaved. For
  her, true emancipation requires a restoration of what was taken from African
  people and the future that was snatched away from their displaced descendants.
  “When Europeans first came to Africa they saw us in all our glory. We walked
  on gold … Our crowns … [were] created from the raw material we had. So, they
  took many examples from us to build their kingdoms and destroyed ours,” she
  says. Europeans, she adds, weren’t just looking for free labour, they were
  intent on taking over. “We were identified as ‘ugly’ and ‘backwards’ because
  of our physical features such as our dark skin, big nose and thick, broad
  lips. They wanted to humiliate us, a chosen people, to bring us down because
  of jealousy, envy and greed. “Restoration is reparation – repairing the damage
  done by the transatlantic slave trade,” she says. Mama G is concerned that
  some view slavery, and the enduring impacts it has created such as systemic
  racism and discrimination, “like it’s nothing, like you can just throw it
  under the carpet, and we must be strong and be a part of society, even though
  they’ve blocked us from everything … and tied our hands.” Vivian Crawford, a
  Maroon who sits on Jamaica’s National Council on Reparations, said that the
  plight of enslaved and displaced Africans and the impact on their descendants
  are still not given equal weight to other acts of genocide throughout history.
  He argued that the Maroons’ revolt and self-emancipation – and their ability
  to match armed colonisers and form structured communities, despite coming from
  different nations in Africa with different customs and languages – was a
  testament to their ingenuity and resilience. “Our ancestors did not allow
  themselves to be subjected to other people. And my role is to take on that
  baton that they have handed to me and not to drop it. I am to carry on that
  track to the winning post. The journey is not complete,” he said. In recent
  times, there has been a growing global momentum for reparations for slavery,
  and repatriation of valuable objects taken by the British, especially across
  the Caribbean and Africa. In July, Caribbean leaders backed a petition to King
  Charles, asking the monarch to use his authority to request legal advice from
  the London-based privy council – the final court of appeal for UK overseas
  territories and some Commonwealth countries – on whether the forced transport
  of Africans to Jamaica was lawful, if it constituted a crime against humanity,
  and whether Britain was under obligation to provide reparations to Jamaica for
  slavery and its enduring consequences. Mama G sees such calls as divine
  intervention. “They talk about upholding human rights, but when it comes to
  them dealing with us, it’s like there’s no justice. So this crying that we
  have been making for so long – as a people who have been through one of the
  worst criminal [acts] against humanity – it gets stronger because our
  ancestors and the almighty God are intervening for justice to be done.” Mama G
  paused to greet drummer and youth leader Oniel Green, 42, and Samantha
  Douglas, 18, who had just arrived at the hall and are part of the next
  generation who say they are working to keep the Maroon traditions alive.
  Sharing the wisdom and culture of the Maroons across Jamaica is key to the
  Maroon goals and supports crime reduction, she says. “Without culture, there
  is a loss of identity and a disconnection from their roots. And as our
  Honourable Marcus Garvey said, ‘a people without the knowledge of their past
  history, origin and culture, is like a tree without roots’, which will surely
  fall.”
