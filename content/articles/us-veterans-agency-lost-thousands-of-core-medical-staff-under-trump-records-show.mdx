  The Department of Veterans Affairs has lost thousands of healthcare
  professionals deemed “core” to the system’s ability to function and “without
  which mission-critical work cannot be completed”, agency records show. The
  number of medical staff on hand to treat veterans has fallen every month since
  Donald Trump took office. The VA has experienced a net loss of 2,000
  registered nurses since the start of this fiscal year, the data show, along
  with approximately 1,300 medical assistants, 1,100 nursing assistants and
  licensed practical nurses, 800 doctors, 500 social workers and 150
  psychologists. The numbers are at odds with claims by the VA secretary, Doug
  Collins, that veterans’ healthcare would not be affected by an agency-wide
  reduction of 30,000 workers to be completed this year through a combination of
  attrition, a hiring freeze and deferred resignation program. The reduction in
  medical staff is also feeding fears that the Trump administration is seeking
  to transform the VA, which currently operates the largest integrated
  healthcare system in the United States, into a private voucher program. “It’s
  a betrayal,” said Manuel Santamaria, 42, a disabled veteran who served as a US
  army medic and paratrooper in Iraq and Afghanistan. “It takes away the
  government’s accountability to veterans who have sacrificed for them.” The VA
  said in a statement to the Guardian that the fear of privatization “is a
  far-left canard” and that “anyone who says VA is cutting health care and
  benefits is not being honest”. The decline in the number of health workers,
  documented by the VA’s monthly workforce dashboard, comes as the agency has
  experienced an influx of nearly 500,000 patients with complex medical issues
  linked to war-time toxic exposure. Bipartisan legislation passed by Congress
  in 2022 dramatically expanded veterans’ eligibility for care for toxic
  exposure. Patricia Fieldings, a registered nurse who is an associate director
  of the National Nurses United labor union and works in the spinal cord injury
  unit at the VA hospital in Augusta, Georgia, said the departures were creating
  “very unsafe” conditions for her patients, many of whom lost the use of their
  neck or became paraplegic due to war wounds. Fieldings spoke to the Guardian
  as a union member. Because of staffing shortages, nurses are being pulled from
  other parts of the hospital, who lack adequate training to “safely care for a
  spinal cord patient”, she said. Veterans and employee unions note that even
  before these departures the VA was already understaffed. Last August, the VA’s
  inspector general reported that 86% of the agency’s 170 medical centers and
  more than 1,000 clinics reported a “severe” shortage of doctors, while 82% of
  facilities reported severe shortages of nurses. The staff reductions reported
  by VA this year represent an additional 2% decrease in the number of nurses
  and 3% decline in the number of doctors, exacerbating the existing shortages.
  In response to a detailed list of questions, the VA press secretary, Peter
  Kasperowicz, did not dispute that the VA employed fewer doctors and nurses
  under President Trump, but said “a nationwide shortage of healthcare workers”
  had made “hiring and retention difficult for the last 15 years across the
  entire healthcare sector, including at some VA locations”. However, agency
  data shows that under Biden, the VA was able to attract doctors and nurses.
  The VA added approximately 10,000 “mission-critical” healthcare professionals,
  between May 2023 and January 2025, agency dashboards show. Kasperowicz said
  the VA “has several strategies to navigate shortages while ensuring veterans
  continue to receive timely, high-quality health care”, which include referrals
  to private healthcare providers and telehealth. He dismissed the “severe
  shortages” of doctors and nurses reported by the VA inspector general saying
  the watchdog’s congressionally mandated report was “completely subjective, not
  standardized and unreliable”. Collins has made cutting employee headcount a
  priority, arguing the agency is bloated and can improve healthcare quality
  while shedding 30,000 jobs. Collins said his goal was “reducing bureaucracy”
  by consolidating “costly administrative functions”. Documents reviewed by the
  Guardian, however, show the agency is also losing healthcare providers. So far
  this year, VA nurses represented by the labor union National Nurses United
  have filed 116 notices, known as “assignment despite objection”, the union
  said, to protest about situations they believe put patient health and safety
  at risk. One written by a shift supervisor in the intensive care unit in the
  Bronx in June, reported three nurses had been tasked with treating three
  patients each, contrary to established safety standards that stipulate
  critical care nurses should not care for more than two patients at a time. Six
  nurses cared for 15 patients at the ICU in the Bronx during the nurse’s shift,
  they wrote: 10 had been placed in isolation, all were listed as “high risk” of
  falls. The nurse also reported that equipment was broken and that nurses had
  to work through breaks and meal times. At the VA in Augusta, Georgia,
  Fieldings filed five reports alleging conditions that “posed a serious threat
  to health and safety of patients” in the spinal cord unit between April and
  July. On 6 June, she wrote that two registered nurses had been tasked with
  caring for 10 patients, seven of whom were on ventilators and all of whom were
  at high risk of falls. On 24 July, she reported three nurses were charged with
  taking care of nine veteran patients, all of whom had been placed in
  isolation. “Staff were not properly trained,” she indicated, and the unit was
  staffed with “unqualified” or “inappropriate personnel”. “These are some of
  our most vulnerable patients,” Fieldings said in an interview. “They have
  difficulty eating. Many have broken their necks.” She said departures had also
  led to regular forced overtime for nurses, leaving them exhausted. “Nurses
  stay until their moral distress is so great that they can’t take it any more
  and then they leave,” she said. In its statement, the VA said reports of
  unsafe conditions in Augusta’s spinal cord unit were “false”and that “the unit
  is fully staffed”. The VA did not respond to reports alleging unsafe
  conditions at the agency’s hospital in the Bronx. It said the Guardian was
  “cherry picking issues that are mostly routine, limited to a handful of sites
  and in many cases were worse under the Biden administration”. On Wednesday,
  the agency said it was terminating labor agreements with unions that represent
  most of its health workers, citing a March executive order from President
  Trump that sought to eliminate collective bargaining rights on “national
  security” grounds. The termination of union agreements eliminates the VA’s
  obligation to respond to these reports of unsafe working conditions. Contract
  language requiring nurses be provided professional training has also been
  voided, along with rules that require management to “float”, or temporarily
  reassign nurses to cover parts of the hospital experiencing staffing
  shortages, “based on qualifications and competencies of the RN”. In
  statements, the AFL-CIO, National Nurses United and the American Federation of
  Government Employees, which represents 320,000 VA workers, said the VA was
  retaliating against workers for speaking up for patients. The agency says the
  end of collective bargaining means “staff will spend more time with Veterans”
  and allow the agency to “manage its staff according to Veterans’ needs, not
  union demands”. The unions, who say their right to bargain collectively cannot
  be voided on “national security” grounds, said they would press their case in
  the courts. At the VA Northport medical center on Long Island, a virtual town
  hall on 30 July with the hospital director, Antonio Sanchez, devolved; the
  chat function in Microsoft Teams burst with complaints. “We are desperate. We
  are getting burnt out,” a clinician in the facility’s inpatient medical unit
  wrote. “We are not able to keep pace with our cut in staff.” Others raised
  concerns about short staffing and patient care across other critical care
  units at Northport, the Teams chat shows, including the intensive care unit,
  post-anesthesia care unit and community living centers, the VA’s version of
  nursing home care. Near the end of the meeting, Sanchez responded that he was
  “working hard” to bring staff onboard as soon as possible. Veterans advocates
  and employee unions allege the Trump administration is consciously seeking to
  starve the veterans healthcare system so it can be turned into a private
  voucher program. The administration’s budget proposal for 2026 includes a
  major realignment of priorities – a 50% increase in taxpayer funding for
  private healthcare for veterans, $11bn, paid for by a corresponding cut to the
  existing public system. During his Senate confirmation hearing to be the VA’s
  undersecretary for health on 23 July, John Bartrum, a retired air force major
  general, said it was time to “revisit the balance” between private and
  government veterans healthcare. In a statement to the Guardian, the VA
  rejected the idea that it was seeking to privatize the agency and said it had
  opened 13 healthcare clinics since January. Advocates said those facilities
  had been in the works for years. The same day as Bartrum’s hearing, the Access
  Act, a bill that would make it dramatically easier for veterans to seek
  private healthcare with taxpayer support, cleared a key House committee on a
  12-11 party-line vote. A blue-ribbon commission established by the agency last
  year found veterans received significantly better care at lower cost from the
  public system. Private providers operated with little oversight, they wrote,
  and “are not required to demonstrate competency in diagnosing and treating the
  complex care needs of veterans nor in understanding military culture, which is
  often critical to providing quality care for veterans”. Independent studies
  from the Congressional Budget Office and Rand Corporation have similarly found
  that veterans in the private system face longer wait times and poorly
  coordinated healthcare at higher costs to the taxpayers. In Las Vegas,
  Santamaria bristled at the suggestion the VA was bloated. He said difficulties
  scheduling appointments have “gotten much worse” under Trump – and that he now
  often spends more than two hours on hold. In addition to post-traumatic stress
  disorder, Santamaria suffers from psoriasis, a skin disease that causes a rash
  with itchy scaly patches that disrupt his sleep and make it hard to
  concentrate. In February, when his medication ran out, Santamaria sought to
  switch to a different drug, but was unable to schedule an appointment with the
  VA until May. By then his entire body was covered by cracked, bleeding welts.
  Psoriasis is among the conditions presumed to be connected to wartime toxic
  exposure under the Pact Act, the 2022 law that extended healthcare and
  benefits eligibility. According to the VA, the wait time for new dermatology
  patients at the VA hospital in southern Nevada was 137 days as of 7 August. In
  its statement, the VA blamed the delays Santamaria faced on a lack of
  communication from the private dermatologist he saw through the agency’s
  “community care” voucher program. Once that doctor filled out the proper
  paperwork, “new medication was mailed out just five days later”, the agency
  said. The agency said the average wait time on phone calls placed to the VA in
  southern Nevada was one minute and 47 seconds. Santamaria said VA workers
  typically answer the phone relatively quickly, before putting him on hold for
  two hours or more. The Guardian asked the VA for data in order to compare
  patient wait times during the Trump and Biden administrations at each VA
  facility. The VA did not provide it, but shared a chart that indicated wait
  times for some health services had marginally improved this fiscal year, while
  others had worsened. The fiscal year covers the final three and a half months
  of the Biden administration and first six months of Trump’s second term. The
  VA’s workforce dashboards show the decline in staffing was accelerating. In
  February, the VA reported a net loss of 223 registered nurses and 94 doctors;
  in June the VA lost an additional 409 registered nurses and 147 doctors. The
  VA declined to answer questions on the acceleration in the reduction of
  “mission-critical” medical workers employed in agency hospitals and clinics.
  Those staffing losses do not include 10,000 VA workers who accepted deferred
  resignation offers early in Trump’s second term, whose last day on the books
  will be 30 September. In response to a Freedom of Information Act request
  filed by the War Horse, a non-profit news outlet focused on veterans issues,
  the VA provided a list of occupations held by these workers. In addition to
  thousands of human resources professionals, management analysts and other
  government bureaucrats, 214 nurses will also leave the agency, along with
  dozens of doctors, social workers and psychologists.
