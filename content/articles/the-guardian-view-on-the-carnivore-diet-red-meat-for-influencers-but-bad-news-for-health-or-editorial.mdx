  The Guardian view on the carnivore diet: red meat for influencers, but bad
  news for health | Editorial

  Once, it seemed that much of the world was intent on drastically cutting back
  on meat for health and environmental reasons. Vegetarian and vegan options
  appeared on restaurant menus and the very idea of a bloody red steak became
  almost unthinkable in liberal circles. And yet the carnivore diet is now all
  over Instagram and TikTok, prompting health bodies to start issuing warnings.
  Followers of this diet eat meat, fat, seafood, eggs and butter, avoiding all
  vegetables, fruits, grains and legumes as if plants were, as Paul Saladino, an
  advocate of this diet alleged, “poison”. Dr Saladino is a US psychiatrist and
  health influencer with a range of supplements called Heart and Soil that
  contain dried animal organ meat. He appears shirtless on social media,
  denouncing vegetables, which he says will harm us. Other Instagrammers tuck
  into plates of huge steaks and seven or more eggs for breakfast. It’s not just
  for weight loss. Joe Rogan has claimed on TikTok that his brain was working
  better after a week of meat, fat, bacon and eggs, and nothing else. Others
  show off huge muscles or say their skin has improved. There’s something
  messianic in their insistence that going carnivore has changed their life.
  This is a virtually zero-carbohydrate, high-fat diet, whose antecedents are
  the Banting diet, promoted as early as 1863, the Atkins diet in 1972 and the
  ketogenic diet, originally developed in the 1920s as a treatment for epilepsy,
  but reborn in the 1990s for weight loss. They force the body to burn energy
  from its fat stores, instead of glucose from carbohydrates, inducing a state
  known as ketosis. People on low-carb diets can lose the initial pounds
  quickly. But studies comparing the results with those of people eating a mixed
  diet found that after a year, the weight loss was the same. What works best is
  the diet that you can stick to. The British Heart Foundation says that the
  carnivore diet could be harmful. “Extreme diets high in saturated fat and low
  in fibre are known to raise cholesterol levels, increasing the risk of heart
  attack and stroke,” it warned last month. Eating protein and fat does not
  raise blood sugar levels as much as carbohydrates, but cutting down on carbs –
  not cutting them out – is the answer, or you lose fibre that is crucial for
  the immune system, as well as other nutrients. Reports that parents are
  putting infants on these diets are particularly alarming. But protein is
  trending, and no longer just for bodybuilders and sports enthusiasts.
  Supermarkets are full of protein-packed snacks, ready-meals and shakes for
  shoppers who have heard that it will build them a better body. Yet almost
  everyone eats more protein than they need: a minimum of 0.75g per kilogram of
  body weight, according to NHS-backed guidelines, although athletes and older
  people may need more. That’s around 56g a day for an average man and 46g for
  an average woman, equivalent to a bowl of cereal with skimmed milk, a Greek
  yoghurt and a lean chicken breast. Nutrition shouldn’t be a fashion item. Fad
  diets don’t work. Balanced eating is best for health, most experts say, as in
  the Mediterranean diet, which includes a wide variety of fruits, vegetables,
  wholegrains and seeds, and even permits a bit of red wine. It may not go viral
  on TikTok, but it works. We should all drink to that. Do you have an opinion
