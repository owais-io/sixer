  Destination X 9pm, BBC One “Where the X am I?” That’s what the contestants are
  going to need to work out at each stage of this discombobulating new
  competition, which turns Europe into a board game. Rob Brydon is the man in
  charge, sending the gang across the continent in windowless coaches. By the
  end of each episode, they need to guess where they are on a map, after being
  fed clues (some of them fake) at stops along the way. Whoever’s guess is the
  furthest away is eliminated and out of the chance of winning the £100,000
  prize at the final destination. Hollie Richardson Fire Country 8pm, Sky
  Witness The new series of the action drama starts with a crash-bang, when a
  helicopter goes down. The ensuing chaos provides ex-con Bode (Max Thieriot)
  with an opportunity to prove that firefighting really is “the only healthy
  addiction I’ve ever had”, while bride Gabriela (Stephanie Arcila) can explain
  her hesitancy at the altar. Ellen E Jones The Moors Murders: A Search for
  Justice 9pm, BBC Two It might feel there’s absolutely no need for another
  documentary on Ian Brady, Myra Hindley and their atrocious crimes. This
  two-parter, though, promises to use newly discovered documents and recordings
  to find missed opportunities – and new evidence that could lead to finding the
  body of the final missing victim, Keith Bennett. HR Long Lost Family: Born
  Without Trace – What Happened Next 9pm, ITV1 One of this week’s weepy stories
  started in a 2022 episode, when two estranged sisters who had been left in
  toilets as babies were reunited. Davina McCall and Nicky Campbell revisit
  Natasha and Lee-Ann, who are still looking for their parents. HR Japan’s
  Master of Restoration 9pm, BBC Four It’s BBC One’s The Repair Shop meets Akira
  Kurosawa’s Ikiru, as an expert antiques restorer and his apprentice son travel
  Japan, bringing new life to exceptional works of art. In this first episode of
  three, Koji “The God Hand” Mayuyama is in Osaka, taking a look at an
  800-year-old vase and a 16th-century tea bowl. EEJ Bookish 8pm, U&amp;Alibi
  The final double bill of Mark Gatiss’s arch and unashamedly queer whodunnit,
  set in 1940s London. When an army captain is poisoned at a hotel bar, exiled
  royalty and disgruntled staff are in the frame for murder. But will you spot
  the red herrings before bibliophile-turned-detective Gabriel Book (Gatiss)?
  Hannah J Davies Film choice Threads (Mick Jackson, 1984), 11.15pm, BBC Four
  For anyone who loves spending their summers being bummed out,Mick Jackson’s
  real-world nuclear horror show is a must. A startling, ferocious depiction of
  the aftermath of a nuclear attack on Sheffield, the film’s impact cannot be
  overstated. The terror doesn’t just come from the initial firestorm, but the
  illnesses and societal breakdown that follow. Threads put the fear of God into
  people right when it needed to the most and, quite frankly, the upcoming
  remake can’t get here soon enough. Stuart Heritage Live sport Golf: Women’s
  Open Noon, Sky Sports Golf. The first day of the major championship from Royal
  Porthcawl in Mid Glamorgan.
