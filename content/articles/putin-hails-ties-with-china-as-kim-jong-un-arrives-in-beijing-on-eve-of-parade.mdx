  Vladimir Putin has hailed Russia’s “unprecedentedly” high level of ties with
  China, as dozens of leaders including the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un,
  arrived in Beijing on the eve of a massive military parade intended to
  showcase a Chinese-led global order. Putin called China’s leader, Xi Jinping,
  a “dear friend” after the two held talks at the Great Hall of the People and
  then at Xi’s personal residence. “Our close communication reflects the
  strategic nature of Russia-China relations, which are at an unprecedentedly
  high level,” Putin told Xi, according to a video on the Kremlin’s Telegram
  channel. “We were always together then, and we remain together now.” Putin,
  described by Xi on Tuesday as his “old friend”, is the most prominent of a
  roster of autocrats who have gathered in China this week for a double bill of
  events designed to project the might of the world’s second-biggest economy and
  geopolitical rival to the US. Hours after the Putin-Xi talks, Kim arrived in
  China in an armoured train accompanied by his daughter, Kim Ju-ae, who was
  making her international debut after years of being seen next to him at
  domestic events and is considered by South Korean intelligence to be her
  father’s most likely successor. A Kremlin aide told the Russian Interfax news
  agency that Putin was likely to hold talks with Kim on Wednesday. At the
  Victory Day parade on Wednesday, thousands of soldiers are due to march
  through the streets of the capital in a show of Chinese military might.
  Rumbling tanks and powerful fighter jets will also be on display for the
  event, which is being held to commemorate 80 years since the defeat of Japan
  in the second world war. The gathering of global autocrats – leaders from
  Iran, Myanmar and Zimbabwe will also be present, along with a host of other
  non-western dignitaries – has been described as the “axis of upheaval” by
  analysts. Putin also met Slovakia’s Moscow-friendly prime minister, Robert
  Fico, the only EU leader in attendance, whom he praised for his country’s
  “independent” position. Fico has repeatedly criticised Kyiv and stalled
  European Union sanctions against Moscow, arguing they put Slovakia’s energy
  security at risk. Putin suggested that Bratislava cut off gas supplies to
  Ukraine. “Ukraine receives a significant volume of energy resources through
  its neighbours in eastern Europe. Shut off gas supplies that go in reverse,”
  he told Fico. On Ukraine, Putin said he had never opposed Ukraine’s potential
  membership of the European Union. “As for Ukraine’s membership of the EU, we
  have never objected to this … As for Nato, this is another issue.” The Russian
  president also said he had no intention of attacking Europe. Putin’s comments
  on the Russia-China relationship came as the two countries signed a deal that
  will sharply increase Beijing’s imports of Russian gas over the next 30 years.
  Putin and Xi agreed to build the Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline, which will
  allow the transit of 50bn cubic metres of gas to China each year. China’s
  purchases of Russian energy and the booming bilateral trade between the two
  countries have been an economic lifeline for Moscow since the start of the war
  in Ukraine. The pipeline will travel through Mongolia. Like Putin, Mongolia’s
  president, Khurelsukh Ukhnaa, was in China for the annual Shanghai Cooperation
  Organisation summit, which took place in Tianjin on Sunday and Monday. Xi said
  on Tuesday: “The more chaotic the international situation becomes, the more
  China, Russia and Mongolia should strengthen solidarity and cooperation.”
  Chinese state media reported on Tuesday that Putin and Xi signed more than 20
  bilateral cooperation documents during talks in Beijing. China also announced
  it would extend visa-free travel privileges to Russian passport holders,
  starting from 15 September. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, also
  attended the SCO summit, in a sign that China-India relations are thawing
  after the imposition of heavy US tariffs on Indian exports. Kim arrived in
  Beijing for the parade on a specially armoured train, in his first visit to
  China since 2019. It is also the first time since 1959 that a North Korean
  leader has attended an international event of this scale. Kim’s trip comes
  after a period in which ties between Russia and North Korea have deepened,
  with Pyongyang sending tens of thousands of troops to fight for Russia in the
  war in Ukraine. About 600 North Korean soldiers have been killed fighting for
  Russia in the Kursk region, according to South Korea’s intelligence agency,
  which believes Pyongyang is planning another deployment. Xi, speaking at the
  SCO summit on Monday, proposed a “global governance initiative”, the latest in
  a slew of Chinese “global initiatives” to reshape the world order according to
  principles favoured by Beijing.
