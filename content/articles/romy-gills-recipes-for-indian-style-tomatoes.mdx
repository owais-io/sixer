  Tomatoes are a staple in Indian cooking, bringing vibrant colour, tanginess, a
  little sweetness and depth to countless recipes. Their sheer versatility often
  helps bring a dish together, while their natural acidity balances spices
  beautifully. Firm ripe tomatoes are essential in cooking, because they hold
  their texture better, release only just enough juice without turning mushy,
  and also provide that crucial balance between sweet and sour. Today’s two
  dishes are prime examples of Indian home cooking and comfort food at its best.
  Tamatar rice (rice cooked in tomatoes and spices; pictured top) Serve this
  with any dal or meat curry, though if you ask me it’s best eaten by itself
  with yoghurt or a tomato raita – to make the latter, mix a small chopped,
  deseeded tomato into 150g yoghurt, then stir in 25ml milk, a small handful of
  chopped fresh coriander, a teaspoon of toasted crushed cumin seeds and season
  to taste. Prep 10 min Soak 15 min Cook 30 min Serves 4 250g basmati rice 250g
  firm ripe tomatoes (about 2 large ones), roughly chopped 6 tsp melted ghee 20g
  cashew nuts 1 tsp black mustard seeds 1 tsp cumin seeds 10-12 fresh curry
  leaves 2 banana shallots, peeled and thinly sliced 1 tsp salt Juice of ½ lemon
  Yoghurt, to serve Soak the rice in cold water for 15 minutes, then drain and
  rinse thoroughly under the cold tap. Put the chopped tomatoes in a blender and
  blitz smooth. Once pureed, strain through a sieve into a bowl, reserving the
  liquid for later. Put two teaspoons of melted ghee in a wide pan or wok for
  which you have a lid, put it on a low heat, then lightly toast the cashew nuts
  – lift them out as soon as they start to change colour. Add the remaining four
  teaspoons of melted ghee to the same pan, tip in the mustard and cumin seeds
  and, as soon as they start to pop, stir in the curry leaves and thinly sliced
  shallots. Turn up the heat to high and cook, stirring, for three minutes. Pour
  in the reserved tomato liquid, cook over a medium heat for four minutes, then
  add the salt and rice, and stir to combine. Pour in 450ml just-boiled water,
  bring everything to a boil, then turn down the heat and stir in the toasted
  cashew nuts and lemon juice. Cover the pan with a lid and leave to cook for
  eight minutes – the idea is to let the rice absorb all the liquid, so don’t
  touch it. After eight minutes, take the pan off the heat and leave to rest for
  at least five minutes before serving. Tamatar ki sabzi (tomato curry) Prep 10
  min Cook 35 min Serves 3-4 30ml rapeseed oil 1 tsp cumin seeds 1 tsp black
  mustard seeds 10-12 fresh curry leaves 1 medium onion, peeled and thinly
  sliced 20g piece fresh ginger, peeled and cut into julienne strips 3 green
  finger chillies, slit open lengthways 475g firm ripe tomatoes, cut into
  quarters 1 tsp sea salt 1 tsp ground turmeric 1 tsp sambar powder 1 tsp brown
  sugar 15g chopped fresh coriander leaves, to garnish Rice or bread, to serve
  Put the oil in a deep, wide saucepan on a medium heat, and add the cumin and
  mustard seeds. As soon as they start to pop, add the curry leaves and sliced
  onion, and cook, stirring, over a high heat for three minutes. Add the ginger
  and green chillies, cook, still stirring, for two minutes more, then turn down
  the heat to medium, add the tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, for five
  minutes. Stir in the salt, turmeric, sambar powder and sugar, then pour in
  500ml just-boiled water and leave to bubble away gently for 10 minutes. Take
  off the heat, sprinkle the chopped coriander over the top and leave to rest
  for 10 minutes. Serve with rice or bread. Romy Gill is a chef, food writer and
