  Last year, the Guardian featured the plight of Fiona Porter, whose British Gas
  account was showing £1,525 in credit before it was migrated to the company’s
  new billing platform. She was promised a refund when her house was sold but,
  instead, received a bill for a similar sum she reluctantly paid. She
  complained, and the company decided that it, in fact, owed her £2,650. The
  promised cheque never came. Instead, she received a bill for £3,000. That’s
  where I came in. British Gas blamed a faulty meter for the confusion and said
  an agent had erroneously recorded the £2,650 credit. It refunded her an
  unexplained £1,201 and declared the account clear. Unconvinced, Porter took
  her case to the energy ombudsman, which ordered British Gas to recalculate
  five years’ of bills. The result? A year after the house was sold, that £2,650
  popped up again, as a debt. Back I went to British Gas. And, guess what? It
  says an agent recorded the £2,650 debt in error while implementing the
  ombudsman recommendations – just as agent error had apparently conjured a
  £2,650 credit months earlier. British Gas now says the account is actually in
  credit to the tune of £424. If you are a British Gas customer, beware. Based
  on this case, its arithmetic would seemingly shame a primary school class. We
  welcome letters but cannot answer individually. Email us at
