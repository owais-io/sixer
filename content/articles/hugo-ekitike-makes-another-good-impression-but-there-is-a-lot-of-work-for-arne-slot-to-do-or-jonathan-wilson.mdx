  To take a side who have just won the league and make four major changes cannot
  be anything but a risk. There will always be at least some process of
  adaptation, particularly given the slight change of shape the arrival of
  Florian Wirtz has entailed. The danger for Liverpool is that they give up
  points that could prove costly if this is a tight title race. While that
  transition goes on, results perhaps matter more than performances, so long as
  the trend of those performances is towards a greater cohesion. Improvement
  certainly is needed. Liverpool cannot give up goals as easily as they did in
  the Community Shield and here if they are to defend their title. But they
  found a way to get the three points, the key goal coming from the most
  unlikely source of Federico Chiesa, and started the season with a win. And for
  all the talk of personnel changes and tactics, the image of Mohamed Salah
  standing alone before the Kop after the final whistle, wiping the tears away
  with his cuff as fans sang the Diogo Jota song, was a poignant image of how
  difficult this season will inevitably be for Liverpool’s players. It’s not
  invalid to talk of the mundanities of football – indeed it’s a necessary part
  of the process – but equally this served as a reminder that grief is woven
  inevitably through this season. The football soap opera will perhaps struggle
  to find a vocabulary to discuss something so personal, so unpredictable, so
  potentially debilitating, but that does not mean that it is not there. The
  tributes before kick-off were moving and the minute’s silence for Jota and his
  brother reverently observed, but there was still a match to be played, for
  football, life, always goes on. Some of Liverpool’s new signings, it’s fair to
  say, have settled in rather better than others. Hugo Ekitiké embellished the
  good impression he had made in the Community Shield, but Milos Kerkez is
  finding settling in rather harder. The 21-year-old Hungarian had an awkward
  afternoon last Sunday, dragged about by Ismaïla Sarr, and he no more enjoyed
  facing his former team-mate Antoine Semenyo. There was a strange jitteriness
  to Kerkez throughout, as though he had begun to doubt himself and, in trying
  to rectify that with decisive contributions, had lost a degree of judgment. He
  was fortunate an early lunge on the Ghanaian made minimal contact but didn’t
  get away with an even wilder flying challenge on Adam Smith and was rightly
  booked. Not, it should be said, that Andy Robertson fared much better, having
  replaced Kerkez on the hour. Semenyo had darted in front of Kerkez to meet a
  low cross from Adrien Truffert early on and it was a very similar move that
  led to Bournemouth’s first goal four minutes later, David Brooks this time
  delivering the cross. The sense perhaps is that whatever unease Kerkez may be
  feeling after his step up, there is also a broader tactical issue. The
  Community Shield and this game maintained the pattern Liverpool had
  demonstrated during pre-season of looking very exciting going forward but far
  less impressive at the back. The adoption of a more man-to-man pressing system
  seems to have rendered them vulnerable to direct running into the tracts that
  are mystifyingly appearing behind or in front of the back four. The equaliser
  was perhaps an extreme example as Semenyo surged 60 yards through mysteriously
  unoccupied space as Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konaté retreated before
  whacking his finish past Alisson. The shame is that what should have been an
  excellent night for Semenyo also involved him reporting an incident of racial
  abuse to the referee Anthony Taylor. Ekitiké made a rather more positive
  impression, although, as in the Community Shield, there was bewilderment that
  having taken one chance supremely well, he then fluffed a seemingly easier
  opportunity soon after. The goal he scored, though, was remarkable as he
  received the ball with six Bournemouth players around him, bundled through
  Marcos Senesi and then finished with a calm certainty. But more than the
  individuals the question mark is over the tweak to the system. Perhaps
  everything will look better when Ryan Gravenberch returns from suspension and
  can take up his place at the back of midfield. Certainly it’s hard to imagine
  him, whatever the diktats of the pressing system, leaving the centre of
  defence as exposed as it was for the Bournemouth equaliser. Dominik Szoboszlai
  has not convinced in the deeper role and it may be that his immediate future
  is as back-up to Wirtz. One of the issues thrown up by the Community Shield
  was the isolation of Salah but that, at least, looks as though it may be
  readily resolved. His link-up with Jeremie Frimpong is a work in progress, but
  there were early signs of an understanding with Ekitiké and he played a
  decisive role in Liverpool’s late surge for victory, his cross leading, via a
  series of shots, blocks and half-clearances, to Chiesa’s volleyed goal before
  he got the fourth with a typically decisive finish. This is a long way from
  the controlled Liverpool of last season but it remains, for now, a winning
  Liverpool.
