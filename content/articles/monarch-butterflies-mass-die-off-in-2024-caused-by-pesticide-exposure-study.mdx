  A 2024 mass monarch butterfly die-off in California was probably caused by
  pesticide exposure, new peer-reviewed research finds, adding
  difficult-to-obtain evidence to the theory that pesticides are partly behind
  dramatic declines in monarchs’ numbers in recent decades. Researchers
  discovered hundreds of butterflies that had died or were dying in January 2024
  near an overwintering site, where insects spend winter months. The butterflies
  were found twitching or dead in piles, which are common signs of neurotoxic
  pesticide poisoning, researchers wrote. Testing of 10 of the insects revealed
  an average of seven pesticides in each, and at levels that researchers suspect
  were lethal. Proving that pesticides kill butterflies in the wild is a
  challenge because it is difficult to find and test them soon after they die.
  Though the sample size is limited, the authors wrote, the findings provide
  “meaningful insight” into the die-off and broader population decline. “The
  incident gave us a rare opportunity to directly document pesticide exposure
  and its impacts on monarchs in the real world,” said Staci Cibotti, the
  study’s lead author, and an entomologist and pesticide program specialist with
  the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation. She added: “Even though
  laboratory studies and population models have shown that pesticides are
  harmful to monarchs, it can be difficult to capture the impacts of pesticides
  in the field on wild populations. This study helps to fill that gap.” As much
  as 90% of the monarch butterfly population in some US regions has been wiped
  out in recent decades, and evidence has pointed to pesticides, climate crisis
  and habitat loss as the drivers. The butterflies were found adjacent to the
  Pacific Grove Monarch Sanctuary, one of about 400 wintering sites along
  California’s coast that are crucial points in the monarchs’ migratory and
  reproductive cycles. Xerces counted about 6,600 butterflies overwintering at
  Pacific Grove in November 2023. Though an investigation by a state
  agricultural official did not determine a source of the die-off, pesticide
  residues on crops, lawns and ornamental flowers are a poisoning risk for
  monarch larvae, and for adults eating nectar. Pesticide run off in shallow
  water sources near where high numbers of butterflies collectively drink
  present a risk for the type of mass die-off at Pacific Grove. All the
  butterflies showed high levels of the same three pyrethroids, a pesticide
  class widely used in California on agricultural and residential land. The
  residential applications are not reported, and Cibotti said the presence of
  the same types of pyrethroids in all the samples points to a nearby
  residential exposure as the source. Some of the pyrethroid levels found in the
  monarchs are known to be lethal, and researchers suspect the combined levels
  of multiple pesticides also probably contributed. Combinations of pesticides
  can have a synergistic effect that makes them even more toxic. The solution,
  Cibotti said, is less pesticides. “These clustering events occur during
  especially sensitive phases of the migratory cycle, so reducing pesticide
  exposure during these times is essential not only to prevent immediate losses,
  but also to improve the population’s chances of rebounding the following
  spring and support its long-term recovery,” Cibotti said.
