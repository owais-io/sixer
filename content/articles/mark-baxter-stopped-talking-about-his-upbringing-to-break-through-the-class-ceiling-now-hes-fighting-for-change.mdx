  “Mark went to a state school but we won’t hold that against him.” Former
  corporate high-flyer Mark Baxter heard variations of this phrase from senior
  leaders in the early years of his career. Baxter’s corporate executive career
  has included working at large financial organisations in Australia and abroad.
  But after leaving university in the 1980s, he realised his working-class
  background was a barrier to progression and inclusion in the workplace. He was
  raised by a single mother on a widow’s pension and attended a public school in
  regional Victoria. Baxter later chose not to discuss his educational
  background with colleagues. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “It’s an awful
  admission,” he said. “I ended up having to mask and just sort of avoid those
  sorts of discussions. I found it frustrating … that people still put a really
  big weight on where you went to school.” For almost 30 years, Sydney-based
  Baxter didn’t talk about his upbringing and public school education. Now,
  Baxter mentors young people in the corporate world, particularly people from
  socially disadvantaged backgrounds and LGBTQ+ employees. “I’m the first to
  admit, I’ve been sort of socially mobile, but there’s been lots of speed humps
  along the way,” he said. The often invisible barrier of social class is what
  Diversity Council Australia (DCA) labels the “class ceiling”. Preliminary
  findings from the council’s latest Class Inclusion at Work report suggest this
  holds many Australians back. Of those surveyed, 44% of “class marginalised
  workers” said they had been offered career development opportunities in the
  past year, including progression opportunities such as secondments or acting
  in a more senior role. This compared with 76% classified as privileged by
  their social class. Only 4% of leaders surveyed reported being class
  marginalised, while 40% said they were class privileged. Despite the
  disparity, just under a quarter (24%) of leaders surveyed recognised that
  social class made a difference in Australia, compared with 33% of other
  workers. DCA uses the term “class marginalised” to refer to those in the
  lowest 20% of household incomes. “Middle class” is for those earning above
  that and up to the “class privileged” – people with the highest 20% of
  household incomes. The council’s research found 22% of class marginalised
  workers felt valued and respected in their team compared with 41% of class
  privileged workers. Baxter recalled being considered for a work promotion and
  being told “you’re not quite the right person for this”. “I think it was coded
  for ‘you’re not really in the right networks’ or ‘you’re not one of us’,” he
  said. “I was just told … Mark, you’re not the type of person that we want to
  promote at the moment.” Baxter, a co-founder and chair of advocacy group
  Australian LGBTQ+ Board &amp; Executive Inclusion and a former NSW Labor board
  member, said it has been difficult to pull apart the discrimination he has
  faced as a member of the LGBTQ+ community and being from a low-socioeconomic
  background. “I can never decide which one has actually created the most
  barriers,” he said. The complete findings from the DCA report, which will be
  published in October, draw on a nationally representative sample of 3,000
  workers and a survey of workers and Diversity and Inclusion (D&amp;I)
  practitioners. Catherine Hunter, the chief executive of DCA, says the findings
  show social class remains “one of the most powerful yet least acknowledged”
  barriers to inclusion at work. Dr Rose D’Almada-Remedios, DCA’s interim
  research director, says there is a persistent myth that Australia is a
  classless society. “More and more people are starting to recognise that’s not
  the case because the divide is becoming more and more obvious. But I do think
  that the legacy of that myth is that people have this low understanding around
  class literacy in Australia,” D’Almada-Remedios said. She said one theme in
  the research was the financial barrier of networking outside work hours that
  some class marginalised people face. She pointed to one respondent who said
  they recognised networking was important but had to choose between those
  opportunities and paying household bills. “We heard lots of stories like that,
  that really brought home how much of a real problem this is in Australian
  organisations, and how important it is that we work towards building class
  inclusion,” she said. DCA published its first Class at Work report in 2020. It
  concluded that, more than any other diversity demographic, class was the most
  strongly linked to workers’ experience of inclusion and one of the most
  strongly related to exclusion. It found that more than 40% of lower-class
  workers reported having experienced discrimination and/or harassment in the
  workplace in the past 12 months, compared with 26% of higher-class workers.
  The same cohort was more likely to report missing out on opportunities and
  privileges compared with middle-class workers and higher-class workers.
