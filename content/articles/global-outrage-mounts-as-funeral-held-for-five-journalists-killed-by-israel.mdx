  The death of the prominent Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif, killed along
  with four colleagues in an Israeli airstrike on Sunday, prompted condemnation
  from around the world, as hundreds of mourners carried their bodies through
  the streets of Gaza City. Sharif, one of Al Jazeera’s most recognisable faces
  in Gaza, was killed while inside a tent for journalists outside al-Shifa
  hospital in Gaza City on Sunday night. Seven people were killed in the attack,
  including the Al Jazeera correspondent Mohammed Qreiqeh and the camera
  operators Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal and Moamen Aliwa, according to the
  Qatar-based broadcaster. On Monday, the Guardian visited the site where the
  journalists were killed. Wadi Abu al-Saud, a Palestinian journalist who was
  near the tent when the Israeli strike occurred on Sunday, said the attack
  happened at 11.22pm, just after he had finished filming his latest news
  bulletin. “I entered the tent opposite theirs, raised my phone to make a call,
  and then the explosion occurred, Saud said. “A piece of shrapnel hit my phone.
  I looked back and saw people burning in flames. I tried to extinguish them.
  Anas and the others had died instantly from the strike.” In two videos of the
  aftermath of the strike, Saud can be seen carrying the bodies of those killed.
  “From now on, I will not continue the coverage,” he said. “I will return to my
  life as a citizen. The truth has died and the coverage has ended.” The Israel
  Defense Forces (IDF) admitted carrying out the attack, claiming Sharif was the
  leader of a Hamas cell responsible for rocket attacks against Israel – an
  allegation that Al Jazeera and Sharif had previously dismissed as baseless. It
  was the first time during the war that Israel’s military has swiftly claimed
  responsibility after a journalist was killed in a strike. Pro-Israel advocates
  on social media hailed the killing of Sharif and posted photos handed out by
  the IDF of photos the journalist took with the former Hamas leader Yahya
  Sinwar, taken before Hamas’s attack on 7 October. Sara Qudah, the Middle East
  and north Africa director at the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), said:
  “Israel’s pattern of labelling journalists as militants without providing
  credible evidence raises serious questions about its intent and respect for
  press freedom.” In July, Sharif told CPJ that he lived with the “feeling that
  I could be bombed and martyred at any moment”. Reporters Without Borders
  condemned the “acknowledged murder by the Israeli army” of Sharif in Gaza and
  called on the international community to intervene. Keir Starmer’s
  spokesperson said: “We are gravely concerned by the repeated targeting of
  journalists in Gaza. Reporters covering conflicts are afforded protection
  under international humanitarian law and journalists must be able to report
  independently without fear, and Israel must ensure journalists can carry out
  their work safely.” The UN human rights office condemned the targeting of the
  journalists’ tent, saying it was “in grave breach of international
  humanitarian law”. Al Jazeera said the attack was “a desperate attempt to
  silence voices in anticipation of the occupation of Gaza” and called Sharif
  “one of Gaza’s bravest journalists”. People gathered at Sheikh Radwan cemetery
  in the heart of the Gaza Strip to mourn the journalists, whose bodies lay
  wrapped in white sheets at al-Shifa hospital before their burial. Friends,
  colleagues and relatives embraced and consoled one another. The area where the
  attack took place was crowded with media workers on Monday, some speaking to
  cameras or mobile phones, others taking photos. Islam al-Za’anoun, a news
  correspondent for Palestine TV and several Arab channels who participated in
  the funeral, said Sunday’s attack was “a turning point in the world of
  journalism”. She said: “Despite all the threats he received and the Israeli
  media’s incitement against him, al-Sharif continued reporting. Now one
  question haunts me: Who will be next on the list? Will it be me?” Bilal Abu
  Khalifa, a presenter at Al Jazeera, said he had met Sharif four days ago. “He
  told me he was in danger,” Abu Khalifa said. “I asked him not to go out or
  appear publicly too often. He gave me a very simple answer: Bilal, I will not
  leave Gaza except to the sky! I will not leave Gaza even if I am killed. I
  know I am on the assassination list, but I will continue to expose the crimes
  of the Israeli army against my people and show the world, and everyone who
  stands by them, the truth.” In a final message, which Al Jazeera said had been
  written on 6 April and which was posted to Sharif’s X account after his death,
  the reporter said he had “lived through pain in all its details, tasted
  suffering and loss many times, yet I never once hesitated to convey the truth
  as it is, without distortion or falsification.” He continued: “Allah may bear
  witness against those who stayed silent, those who accepted our killing, those
  who choked our breath, and whose hearts were unmoved by the scattered remains
  of our children and women, doing nothing to stop the massacre that our people
  have faced for more than a year and a half.” After the Hamas attacks on 7
  October 2023, Israel barred international journalists from entering Gaza – one
  of the rare moments when international reporters have been denied access to an
  active war zone. Since then, the task of documenting the war has fallen
  heavily on Palestinian journalists, often at the cost of their lives –
  themselves caught in its devastation, displaced multiple times, their homes
  reduced to rubble, friends and relatives killed, and at times queueing for
  food at perilous distribution points. According to Gaza’s government media
  office, 238 journalists have been killed by Israel since the war started. CPJ
  said at least 186 journalists had been killed in the Gaza conflict. Israel
  denies deliberately targeting journalists. In a report released this year, the
  Watson School of International and Public Affairs’ costs of war project said
  more journalists had been killed in Gaza than in both world wars, the Vietnam
  war, the wars in Yugoslavia and the US war in Afghanistan combined.
