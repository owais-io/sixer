  An aid group that coordinates medical care in the United States for badly
  injured children from Gaza has said it is “distressed” by the US state
  department’s decision to stop issuing visitor visas for Palestinians after a
  far-right influencer complained directly to the secretary of state about their
  work. Laura Loomer, who has previously described herself as a “proud
  Islamophobe”, told the New York Times that she had spoken to Marco Rubio on
  Friday night to warn the secretary of state of what she called the threat
  posed by “Islamic invaders”. The aid group, Heal Palestine, said in a
  statement that it was “an American humanitarian nonprofit organization
  delivering urgent aid and medical care to children in Palestine, including
  sponsoring and bringing severely injured children to the US on temporary visas
  for essential medical treatment not available at home”. “After their treatment
  is complete, the children and any accompanying family members return to the
  Middle East,” the charity added, to rebut Loomer’s false claim that the
  visitors were part of a secret wave of “Islamic immigration”. “This is a
  medical treatment program, not a refugee resettlement program,” the aid group
  stressed. At least two Republican members of Congress, Chip Roy and Randy
  Fine, thanked Loomer on social media for bringing their attention to the
  medical visas for wounded children from Gaza. Roy celebrated the suspension of
  the visas as a first step. Fine suggested the visas had been “issued by deep
  state actors” and that it was necessary to now “get to the bottom of how this
  national security risk was allowed”. Rubio told CBS News on Sunday that his
  office had stopped issuing the medical-humanitarian visas to visitors from
  Gaza after concerns were raised by “numerous congressional offices” about
  allegations that groups “bragging about and involved in acquiring these visas
  have strong links to terrorist groups like Hamas”. Rubio did not cite any
  evidence those allegations were true, but Loomer tried to link Heal
  Palestine’s founder, Steve Sosebee, to Hamas on social media on Sunday by
  drawing attention to his effort to reopen a hospital in Gaza that Israel’s
  military had destroyed after alleging the Islamist militant group used it for
  cover. She also criticized him for having once praised the late Palestinian
  poet Refaat Alareer, who had joked before his death about a debunked claim
  that an Israeli baby, killed in the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023, had
  been found in an oven. The Guardian has contacted Sosebee for comment. Another
  group Sosebee founded, Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, was responsible for
  bringing a two-year-old Palestinian girl named Rahaf, and her mother, Israa
  Saed, from Gaza to St Louis, Missouri, for medical treatment in December.
  After being fitted with prosthetic legs, Rahaf met and danced with the
  children’s presenter Ms Rachel. In addition to being in frequent contact with
  Trump, Loomer is followed on social media by senior administration officials,
  including: Rubio; JD Vance, the vice-president; Pete Hegseth, the defense
  secretary; Kash Patel, the FBI director; and Stephen Miller, the chief
  domestic policy adviser.
