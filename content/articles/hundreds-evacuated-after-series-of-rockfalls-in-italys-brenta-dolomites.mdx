  Hundreds of hikers and tourists were evacuated and dozens of trails closed
  after a series of rockfalls on the slopes of Cima Falkner in the Brenta
  Dolomites in the north of Italy, as experts warned of a sharp rise in
  landslides in the area linked to thawing permafrost. In recent days, visitors
  reported hearing loud booms followed by rockfalls and thick clouds of dust
  rising from Monte Pelmo in the Val di Zoldo after rocky pinnacles broke away
  and crashed down into the valley below in the municipality of Selva di Cadore
  in Italy’s Belluno province. Another collapse was recorded on Cima Falkner,
  where experts say the entire area is undergoing a process of erosion linked to
  rising temperatures and the wider climate emergency. No one was injured and
  the falling debris came to a stop higher up the mountain. “Multiple rockfalls
  have occurred on both the western and eastern slopes of Cima Falkner in the
  Brenta Group,” read a statement by authorities in the region of Trentino-Alto
  Adige. “As a result, all climbing routes and hiking trails directly affected
  by the area have been immediately closed. “All hikers in the area have been
  evacuated. We urge everyone to pay maximum attention and strictly follow the
  ordinances to ensure their own safety.” Following reports of rockfalls, a
  technical inspection was conducted on Tuesday by the geological service with
  the support of a helicopter unit, which confirmed that “the entire summit is
  affected by an ongoing geomorphological process, likely linked to permafrost
  degradation”. Rockfalls have always occurred in the Dolomites, but experts
  this year warned of a striking rise in the number of collapses, driven by
  extreme heat and weather events intensified by the climate crisis. “Never
  before have we seen such an incredible increase in rockfalls,” Piero Carlesi,
  president of the scientific committee of the Italian Alpine Club (CAI), told
  la Repubblica. “Landslides are on the rise, and the main cause is the climate
  crisis. There’s no doubt about it.” He added: “Mountains, by definition, are
  destined to collapse – they won’t remain as we know them for ever. What’s
  different now is that we’re seeing a clear acceleration of these processes,
  driven by heat and extreme weather events intensified by the climate crisis.”
  Cold temperatures, causing water seeping into rock fractures to freeze, acted
  as a kind of glue, holding the rocks together. But now, Carlesi said, with
  rising temperatures, that glue was disappearing and fractured rock was
  increasingly breaking off and tumbling down gullies. “It’s happening more and
  more often,” he said. Last year, Italian scientists who took part in a
  campaign launched by the environmentalist group Legambiente said the Marmolada
  glacier – the largest and most symbolic in the Dolomites – could melt
  completely by 2040. Their report said Marmolada was losing between 7cm and
  10cm of depth a day and that over the past five years, 70 hectares (173 acres)
  of its surface had disappeared. Since the beginning of scientific measurements
  in 1888, the Marmolada glacier has withdrawn by 1,200 metres in an
  “irreversible coma”. In 2022, a collapse on the Marmolada mountain sent an
  avalanche of ice, snow and rock downslope and killed 11 people. Erosion and
  rockfalls are on the rise not only in the Dolomites but across the entire
  Alpine range, according to mountaineers and experts. In late June 2025, Mont
  Blanc experienced a record-breaking heatwave with temperatures remaining above
  zero for an extended period at high altitudes, including the summit. Bernard
  Vion, a 66-year-old mountain guide, has been walking and climbing in the
  French Alps around Pralognan-la-Vanoise since he was a child and accompanies
  visitors on climbs. He said rockfalls and other dangers caused by climate
  change had complicated work for him and his colleagues. “We have never seen
  rock falls of such intensity and regularity before. The permafrost, which is
  like a kind of cement holding the rocks together, is melting, meaning they
  have no cohesion and they collapse,” he said. Vion opened his phone to show a
  message from another guide with pictures of a large rockfall near a mountain
  refuge at about 2,800 metres above Pralognan-la-Vanoise on Monday. “He was
  really shocked. He said he never expected it to happen there,” Vion said. “For
  several years now we have had to develop the ability to observe these
  phenomenon and spot the warning signs. In some cases we’ve had to totally
  modify our itineraries to reduce the risk to our clients. Even for us guides
  this is difficult and I worry about amateur climbers who don’t have the same
  mountain culture.” He said “of course” this was due to climate breakdown.
  “You’d have to be blind not to see it. Anyone who doubts this should come to
  the mountains.”
