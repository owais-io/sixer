  Troops from the Australian defence force have joined the search for Dezi
  Freeman in Victoria’s north-east a week after the fugitive allegedly shot two
  police officers, the deputy prime minster, Richard Marles, confirmed. Speaking
  to ABC’s 7.30 last night, Marles – who is also the minister for defence – said
  the ADF had provided a planning specialist and air surveillance assets
  following a request from Victoria police. “The Australian defence force will
  work with the Victorian police as they request our assistance in terms of the
  particular assets and capabilities that we have to bring Dezi Freeman to
  justice,” Marles told Sarah Ferguson. Separately, the deputy PM told the
  program he “fully expects” the Australian government will meet with US
  president Donald Trump “in the not-too-distant future”, describing a “sense of
  optimism” about the alliance. Marles met with Trump’s right-hand man, US
  vice-president JD Vance, and US counterpart Pete Hegseth last week to discuss
  the bilateral economic relationship, critical minerals, national security and
  Aukus. US defence officials initially denied the Australian defence minister
  and US counterpart had met during the last-minute trip to Washington, but
  later clarified a meeting had indeed taken place. “Ours is a relationship
  where we feel a sense of optimism about how we can manage the alliance with
  the Trump administration and indeed the meetings I had last week only affirmed
  that,” Marles told 7.30. AustralianSuper is the country’s largest super fund.
  It has more than 3.6 million members and $385bn in funds under management.
  “I’ve said this behind closed doors and in front of the cameras and I’ll say
  it again: it would be a disaster for members if governments tried to tell us
  what to invest in,” Schoder will say in the speech. “Members carry the
  investment risk, and it is their money.” He says governments can build assets,
  with the plan to sell or lease them later to long-term investors such as super
  funds. But he warns part of government’s role is to build things that are
  important for the country but which don’t necessarily make the kind of
  financial return super funds need. “We must break the piggy bank mentality,”
  Schroder says. “Super is not a trillion-dollar fix-all. It cannot – and should
  not – be used to solve every complex national problem.” The boss of
  Australia’s biggest superannuation fund says it would be “a disaster” if
  governments started directing investments from the country’s $4.2tn retirement
  savings pool. AustralianSuper chief executive, Paul Schroder, will address the
  National Press Club in Canberra today, speaking about superannuation’s role in
  national renewal. Schroder will say super funds should be involved much
  earlier in discussions with governments about the assets they build and run,
  so investment opportunities which meet a national or community need are
  identified. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has pushed super funds to send
  capital towards opportunities that are in “the national interest”. He wants
  backing for “big national priorities” such as housing and infrastructure. Good
  morning and welcome to our live politics blog. I’m Martin Farrer with the best
  overnight stories before Krishani Dhanji takes the controls for the bulk of
  the day. The boss of Australia’s biggest superannuation fund will warn today
  that it would be “a disaster” if governments started to try to dictate how the
  industry invests its $4.2tn retirement savings pool. In a speech to the
  National Press Club later today, AustralianSuper chief executive, Paul
  Schroder, will say the super pot is not a “fix-all” for the nation’s problems.
  More coming up. The army has joined the search for the Porepunkah shooting
  suspect, Dezi Freeman, Richard Marles told ABC’s 7.30 last night, providing a
  planning specialist and air surveillance help following a request from
  Victoria police. It comes as an expert on the terrain says Freeman could be
  evading police heat detection devices by hiding in the area’s disused mines.
  More details shortly. The former human rights commissioner, Chris Sidoti, has
  urged Australia to take stronger action against Israel after the ICJ’s ruling
  last year that it had acted illegally against the Palestinian people. Sidoti
  told Labor MPs yesterday that the government must do more than offer “pious
  expressions of support”.
