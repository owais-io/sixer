  The observation by architect Louis Kahn that you “can only really see a
  building … once the building becomes a ruin” runs through this book like the
  Hooghly river through India’s former capital. There’s no better Indian ruin
  than Kolkata, a city that still clings to the centrality of its role in the
  19th-century intellectual renaissance that buttressed the case for Indian
  self-rule. The adage back then was that “what Bengal thinks today, India
  thinks tomorrow”. Great Eastern Hotel, the second novel from the author of The
  Last Jet-Engine Laugh, is 920 pages and well over 300,000 words long. The
  staff of your local Waterstones will kindly describe it as “an undertaking”.
  It is set in and around the still-standing, now eye-wateringly expensive Great
  Eastern Hotel, which is, as the book points out, a model for the city itself:
  a place that was once the confluence for an entire subcontinent, where
  conquerors and subjugated, foreigners and natives met and danced and governed
  and suffered. When the book opens in 1941, instead of today’s sunburnt German
  tourists, we have whisky, secret societies, spies, anti-colonial firebrands
  and over-rouged raciness, with the hotel as the stage on and around which the
  characters play out their political struggles, love lives and artistic
  endeavours. The book revolves around young communist revolutionary Nirupama,
  whose ill-fated romance with an African American soldier leaves her with a
  semi-orphan son, Saki (named after the freshly Oppenheimered city). He is our
  future narrator, assembling history out of scraps of memories, inventions and
  outright fabrications. The narrative combines the story of her political and
  emotional development in the chaos of the Japanese yomp through south-east
  Asia, filtered through that of her son in the years after Indian independence
  as he struggles to find his voice as an artist, stuck between the two worlds
  of his parental inheritance. There are a host of other characters – confused
  apple-cheeked young bluestocking Imogen, gin-soaked upper-crust intellectual
  artist Kedar, pickpocket turned hidden market impresario Gopal and many other
  Indians, British, Americans and French of varying political and alcoholic
  affiliations. The communists did end up winning, of course, for a while,
  ruling West Bengal as the longest democratically elected communist government
  in the world. They even ran the titular hotel as a state enterprise for 30
  long, mouldy, complaint-stacked, orgiastically corrupt years, before it was
  mercilessly or mercifully privatised to resounding success, sold off in the
  2000s by the last stuttering communists, lacking fluency in India’s modern
  electoral language of multi-ethnic sectarian clientelism. They were the ones
  who changed the city’s name to Kolkata, a wan attempt to appeal to Bengali
  linguistic nationalism, but it wasn’t enough – it never is. The hotel isn’t as
  central to the plot as it was to that other great novel about Calcutta hotel
  intrigues, Sankar’s Chowringhee, with its glamour, gossip and Grand Hotel
  rococo raffishness, and there’s none of the densely plotted balletic
  regimentation of Amor Towles’s hotel-bound A Gentleman in Moscow. What we have
  instead is a panoramic view of second world war-era Calcutta, with alcoholic
  artists, rambunctious chefs, wily servants, plotting communists, smoky jazz
  bars, rattan chairs and indolent ceiling fans. The Bengal famine lurks in the
  background, rural peasants slowly stumbling into the big city, “skeletons
  whispering in dialects we rarely heard in Calcutta”, first a trickle, then a
  flood. The hotel isn’t just a model of the city by the end, it is “alive and
  constantly moving across the planet, sliding from Bengal to Biafra to Cambodia
  and then back to Bengal, and then going god knows where else” – a metaphor for
  the horrible glamour of life and death, feast and famine, stalking the 20th
  and 21st centuries. Joshi has a vast canvas to play with here, and it’s heady,
  sensually described, deeply felt stuff. He has a gift for evocative,
  Technicolor phrases. Doors are “like two lovers parting in a puppet opera”,
  the British are “dried‑up rinds of lime in the evaporated gin and tonic of
  your Empire”, a character’s eyebrows are Molotov and Ribbentrop. There’s a
  slight relentlessness to the English and Banglish wordplay – a “be-mansioned
  and be-knighted” character and his employee are “Sir and Sir-vant” – with
  nicknames and political in-jokes aplenty. Despite its panoramic approach, the
  novel does often stray into the hotel genre’s greatest pitfall, familiar to
  anyone who ever opened a doorstopper from its 70s maximalist heyday, wherein
  characters become types, mere bits of stage scenery to take us places and
  deliver lines: the naive young British woman, the outrageously plucky street
  thief, the unscrupulous proto-Greene American eyeing the rotting carcass of
  empire. There’s a sometimes cloying tendency by the protagonist-narrator to
  announce themselves as “an architect-engineer” constructing a “story-hotel”
  “room by room”, and that there is “no way that I … could have forged a proper
  narrative, but it was useful to try”. These retrospective passages, narrated
  by Saki from his abortive career as an architectural historian in 1970s Paris,
  are the novel’s weakest – too knowing, too wry, too pat. But Joshi’s ability
  to render place and time is truly first-rate. I’ve not read a book by an
  author this year who so clearly loves what he’s writing about. There’s an
  absurd combination of fun and wonder and horror on every page. We can only
  hope that having taken 25 years to write his second novel, he’ll be back
  sooner with his next. • Rahul Raina is the author of How to Kidnap the Rich
  (Little Brown). Great Eastern Hotel by Ruchir Joshi is published by 4th Estate
  (£18.99). To support the Guardian, order your copy at guardianbookshop.com.
