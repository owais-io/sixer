  In the Pacific territory of Guam shortly before lunchtime on Tuesday, Sam
  Mabini’s phone began to ping. A tsunami warning had been issued after an
  8.8-magnitude quake struck a remote part of the Russian coast. Authorities had
  put out the alert over concerns that destructive waves could slam the
  shoreline in the coming hours, and urged people to move away from the coast.
  Mabini, a former Guam senator, took action. “I went to higher ground just in
  case,” she said. Her family lives in the lower area of Tamuning and they moved
  to a more elevated part of the village. She joined other residents who
  evacuated to Agana Heights, a higher part of Hagåtña, the capital of the US
  island in the western Pacific Ocean. In villages, towns and cities across the
  world’s largest ocean, from Russian and Chinese ports to Japanese fishing
  communities and coastal cities across the US west coast and farther south in
  Latin America, warnings and evacuation orders rang out after the quake, one of
  the strongest ever recorded. Workers were sent home and businesses locked down
  as they braced for what might hit in the hours ahead. Over the course of
  Wednesday, governments in many countries including the US and Japan downgraded
  their initial tsunami alerts, but not until after countless people across
  multiple time zones had fled as a precaution, many in the middle of the night.
  In parts of Russia, waves of up to 4 metres were recorded and authorities
  urged people to move away from the shoreline. In Japan, footage by the public
  broadcaster NHK showed many people on the roof of a building on the northern
  island of Hokkaido, sheltering under tents from the beating sun, while fishing
  boats left harbours to avoid potential damage from the incoming waves. About
  200 people evacuated to a Buddhist temple that sits on high ground overlooking
  Kamaishi, in Iwate prefecture, a city that lost about 1,250 residents in the
  devastating March 2011 tsunami. The Senjuin temple is a designated municipal
  tsunami evacuation area. The chief priest, Keio Shibasaki, told the Mainichi
  Shimbun newspaper: “Considering that more than 1,000 people took refuge here
  after the [2011] earthquake, the number of evacuees is relatively small, but
  we have started preparing lunch with stored food in case of unforeseen
  circumstances such as power outages. We are prepared for a long stay.”
  Evacuees included staff from the city hall, the post office, and children and
  teachers from the nearby Kamaishi kindergarten. “We evacuated when the tsunami
  warning was issued,” the kindergarten head, Keito Fujiwara, told the Mainichi
  Shimbun. “We stored emergency food supplies at the temple and have been
  preparing accordingly. During the 2011 earthquake, there were cases where
  parents went to pick up their children and became victims, so we communicated
  via group LINE [a popular Japanese messaging app] that under no circumstances
  should anyone go to pick up their children.” In 2011, the tsunami waves swept
  over the Kamaishi tsunami protection breakwater, a decades-long $1.5bn project
  that had been completed two years previously, inundating the city in scenes
  that were captured on video and seen around the world. The only death related
  to Wednesday’s tsunami appeared to be in Japan, where a 58-year-old woman was
  reported to have died after her car fell from a cliff as she evacuated to
  higher ground, according to local media. In Hawaii, tsunami warning sirens
  blared twice on Tuesday afternoon on multiple islands including Oahu, where
  the capital, Honolulu, is located, and Kauai. Evacuations were ordered for
  some coastal areas as the Honolulu department of emergency management warned:
  “Take action! Destructive tsunami waves expected.” As residents raced to get
  out, traffic backed up in some Honolulu neighbourhoods. Even though it is
  summer break for pupils, some schools issued alerts cancelling sports and
  other activities. On Kauai shortly after the tsunami warning was issued, staff
  at the National Tropical Botanical Garden suspended tours on its south shore
  and moved all visitors and employees out of the inundation zone to higher
  ground. Still, blue skies and breezy conditions prevailed as many in Hawaii
  left work early heading for home or for designated safe areas away from the
  islands’ heavily populated coastline. Residents have become particularly
  sensitive to phone warnings and civil defence sirens after Hawaii’s emergency
  management agency issued a false alert warning of an inbound “ballistic
  missile threat” in 2018, causing widespread panic. All islands activated
  emergency operating centres, shelters began opening, and people in coastal
  areas were advised to head to higher ground immediately. Kauai police asked
  the public to stay off the road unless absolutely necessary. When the waves
  arrived, they were not as destructive as feared, and Hawaii’s emergency
  management agency said evacuation orders had been lifted and there were no
  reports of major damage. In Guam, residents were urged to remain out of the
  water and told to move away from beaches and harbours, at least 100ft (30
  metres) inland and 50ft above sea level. The port authority and other
  government agencies suspended operations, while marina users and local
  residents were told to evacuate to higher ground. Workers in some businesses
  and in the Guam visitors bureau in the coastal district of Tumon were sent
  home. But some were not worried by the warnings. Tessa Borja, a policy analyst
  from Tumon, did not feel evacuating was necessary and stayed in her
  second-floor flat. “We are protected by the reef,” she said. In nearby Saipan,
  the largest island and capital of the Northern Mariana Islands, similar
  warnings were issued. Government offices were closed and businesses in
  low-lying areas shut their doors. Petrol stations had long queues of vehicles
  wanting to fill up. Some residents living near the shoreline in Saipan, an
  island of about 43,000 people, fled to higher ground as they waited for the
  all clear from authorities. Tsunami drills by emergency authorities have been
  held regularly in on the island. As the ripples of the earthquake spread
  across the Pacific, Latin America was one of the last places to be hit.
  Peruvians received beeping alerts and text messages on their phones from the
  National Civil Defence Institute, warning them to stay away from the beach and
  telling authorities to close coastal access points along the country’s
  1,864-mile (3,000km) Pacific-facing coastline. In the capital Lima, the
  coastal road was closed, though La Punta, a low-lying peninsula in the nearby
  port district Callao, was not evacuated. R Adm Jorge Vizcarra, a spokesperson
  for the Peruvian navy, said: “The train of waves will be noticeable, but it
  will not be high enough to have a significant impact on the population.”
