  The US government has taken an unprecedented 10% stake in Intel under a deal
  with the struggling chipmaker and is planning more such moves, according to
  Donald Trump and the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, the latest
  extraordinary intervention by the White House in corporate America. Lutnick
  wrote on X: “BIG NEWS: The United States of America now owns 10% of Intel, one
  of our great American technology companies. Thanks to Intel CEO @LipBuTan1 for
  striking a deal that’s fair to Intel and fair to the American People.” Trump
  met with Lip-Bu Tan on Friday and posed for a photo with Lutnick. The
  development follows a meeting between Tan and Trump earlier this month that
  was sparked by the US president’s demand for the Intel chief’s resignation
  over his ties to Chinese firms. “He walked in wanting to keep his job and he
  ended up giving us $10bn for the United States. So we picked up $10bn,” Trump
  said on Friday. While Trump did not provide detail on the $10bn, the equity
  stake is about equal to the amount Intel is set to receive in grants from the
  government under the Chips and Science Act to help fund the building of chip
  plants in the US. The Intel investment would be the latest of several unusual
  deals struck by the Trump administration with US companies, including agreeing
  to allow the AI chip giant Nvidia to sell its H20 chips to China in exchange
  for the US government receiving 15% of those sales. Chipmaker AMD struck a
  similar deal. The Pentagon is also slated to become the largest shareholder in
  a small mining company to boost output of rare-earth magnets and the US
  government negotiated for itself a “golden share” with certain veto rights as
  part of a deal to allow Nippon Steel to buy US Steel. The US government’s
  broad intervention in corporate matters has worried critics who say Trump’s
  actions create new categories of corporate risk. Trump’s move follows a $2bn
  capital injection from SoftBank Group in what was a major vote of confidence
  for the troubled US chipmaker in the middle of a turnaround. Daniel Morgan,
  senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, said Intel’s problems were beyond a
  cash infusion from SoftBank or equity interest from the government. “Without
  government support or another financially stronger partner, it will be
  difficult for Intel foundry unit to raise enough capital to continue to build
  out more Fabs at a reasonable rate,” he said, adding Intel “needs to catch up
  with TSMC [Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company] from a technological
  perspective to attract business”. A 10% stake at current share prices would be
  worth roughly $10bn. Lutnick said this week any stake would be non-voting,
  meaning it would not enable the US government to tell the company how to run
  its business. Federal backing could give Intel more breathing room to revive
  its loss-making foundry business, analysts said, but it still suffers from a
  weak product roadmap and challenges in attracting customers to its new
  factories. Tan, who took the top job at Intel in March, has been tasked to
  turn around the American chipmaking icon, which recorded an annual loss of
  $18.8bn in 2024 – its first such loss since 1986.
