  The Trump administration said it would cut terrorism prevention funding for
  New York City, according to a grant notice posted days after a gunman killed
  four people inside a Manhattan skyscraper. The Federal Emergency Management
  Agency (Fema) stated in a grant notice posted on Friday that New York City
  would receive $64m less this year from its urban area security fund. The
  amount was listed in a single line of an 80-page Fema notice on the grant
  program. US Congress created the program to help cities prevent terrorist
  attacks. “It makes absolutely no sense, and no justification has been given to
  cut NY’s allocation given the rise in the threat environment,” a spokesperson
  for the New York state division of homeland security and emergency services
  said in a statement on Monday afternoon. Manhattan has been the site of two
  attacks on high-profile corporate executives in the last year. The most recent
  attack came from a gunman armed with an assault-style rifle in late July, who
  killed four people inside an office building that houses the headquarters of
  the NFL and several major financial firms. New York governor Kathy Hochul, a
  Democrat, highlighted the attack in her late July letter to the US homeland
  security secretary Kristi Noem, asking why the Trump administration had not
  announced the amounts each city would receive from the program this year. Fema
  is part of the Department of Homeland Security. Noem’s office did not respond
  to two messages from Reuters asking why the federal government cut New York’s
  funding. In December 2024, the chief executive of insurance giant
  UnitedHealthcare, Brian Thompson, was shot dead on the street in Manhattan in
  a targeted attack. And security has been particularly tight in New York City
  ever since the al-Qaida terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, which killed
  almost 3,000 people in lower Manhattan when Islamist extremists flew hijacked
  passenger jets into the twin towers of the World Trade Center. Fema uses “an
  analysis of relative risk of terrorism” to decide how much money cities will
  receive, according to the grant notice posted on Friday. The agency may change
  the amounts later, according to the notice. In 2023, the agency considered
  city visitor counts, population density and proximity to international
  borders, among other factors, to determine the totals, according to a report
  signed by then Fema administrator Deanne Criswell. Fema has been decreasing
  terrorism prevention money for New York City each year since at least fiscal
  year 2022. The drop is much more drastic this year at 41% year-over-year. The
  New York City police department has used the funding in the past to pay for
  the Domain Awareness System, a network of cameras, license plate readers and
  detection devices, according to a 2016 statement from the former mayor Bill de
  Blasio’s office.
