  The banning of books, it would be easy to think, is a relic of less
  enlightened ages. The Catholic church, in a last spasm of rectitude, added
  Jean-Paul Sartre, Alberto Moravia and Simone de Beauvoir to its Index of
  Forbidden Books during the 1940s and 50s, but then abandoned the list, which
  had lasted four centuries, in 1966. Public book burnings by Nazis or
  McCarthyites, too, might be assumed to be nothing more than a baleful warning
  from the past. Yet the burning of books still appears an irresistible act to
  some – even in the country with the strongest statutory protection of free
  speech, the United States. In 2019, students at Georgia Southern University
  burned copies of visiting Cuban-American author Jennine Capó Crucet’s Make
  Your Home Among Strangers, some shouting “Trump 2020!”. In 2022, the Nashville
  pastor Greg Locke held a public bonfire for “demonic” books, including the
  Harry Potter and Twilight series. Censorship used to occur largely at the
  level of governments or other transnational authorities. It still does in
  authoritarian countries such as Iran and China, but western states generally
  liberalised in the mid-20th century. Yet a weaker form of censorship has long
  persisted within the American school system, where individual books are
  subject to “challenge” by parents who consider them inappropriate material for
  their children. Often, school boards will respond by removing those books from
  school libraries, in which case they have effectively been banned. The
  phenomenon has accelerated in recent years. The machinery of school censorship
  in the US has also become significantly more corporate. According to the
  American Library Association’s analysis of its 2024 data, “the majority of
  book censorship attempts are now originating from organised movements.
  Pressure groups and government entities that include elected officials, board
  members and administrators initiated 72% of demands to censor books in school
  and public libraries.” Between 2001 and 2020, such groups challenged an
  average of 46 titles per year. Last year, they challenged 4,190 titles in 12
  months. Donald Trump’s crusade against diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI)
  programmes in schools and universities has led some school districts in Texas
  and Florida to proactively remove shelf-fulls of potential offenders within
  the last 12 months. Earlier this year, meanwhile, a man went into a public
  library in Ohio, checked out a number of books on Jewish, Black and LGBTQ+
  history, and burned them all. The caption to a video of the bonfire read: “We
  are cleansing our libraries of degenerate filth.” Joseph Goebbels would have
  approved. Here, then, is a selection of other books that have been considered
  degenerate filth … Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood Atwood’s 2003
  post-apocalyptic fantasia, whose heroes smoke weed and watch very bad things
  on the internet before their everyday lives are swept away by a global
  pandemic, is among the most widely sanctioned by American schools. The
  particularly censorious Utah State Board of Education even bans pupils from
  carrying a copy into school to read in their personal time. All such perilous
  tomes, advises the board, must not be given away or resold but instead sent to
  a specified warehouse in a box clearly marked “sensitive materials”. Not to be
  outdone, in 2024 a Texas school district banned Oryx and Crake because it
  promoted “gender fluidity”. Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone by JK
  Rowling The famous children’s books about witches and wizards might be more
  likely to attract opprobrium these days on the grounds of the author’s
  political opinions, but long before that, Potterphobes were trying to get the
  books off school shelves in the US on the grounds that they glorify the occult
  or actually “promote witchcraft”. They succeeded in a few cases, such as
  Zeeland, Michigan in 1999, and Nashville, Tennessee, in 2019. Which begs the
  question, can you promote something if it doesn’t exist? Milk and Honey by
  Rupi Kaur The Indian-Canadian poet rose to fame on Instagram, and this
  collection of social media-friendly minimalist verse was initially
  self-published in 2014 before coming out commercially and going on to sell
  more than 11m copies. Popularity, however, is no defence against the
  literary‑prohibition complex, which in this case cited not Kaur’s refusal to
  employ upper-case letters but the fact that some of her poems explore themes
  of sexual assault. It was the joint-ninth most-banned book by US school
  districts in the 2022-23 school year and remains off limits in districts
  across eight states. The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini Hosseini’s 2003 novel
  set in Afghanistan before the Soviet occupation and then under the Taliban,
  which has sold more than 8m copies worldwide, has long been among the most
  banned books in US school districts, for its depictions of homosexuality,
  violence, or inter-Afghan ethnic tensions. The 2007 film adaptation was banned
  in Afghanistan itself under the government of Hamid Karzai. The Kite Runner is
  now one of many books removed from shelves in schools run by the US Department
  of Defense pending a review announced in 2024 – a ban that chimes with Donald
  Trump’s targeting of DEI. Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell Orwell’s story
  of totalitarian truth-twisting may have been partly inspired by his experience
  of working for the BBC, but the Soviets felt it was obviously aimed at them,
  and so the novel was banned in the USSR until 1988, along with homegrown
  masterworks such as Vasily Grossman’s second world war epic Life and Fate. But
  Orwell’s relevance has not since diminished: Russians protesting against the
  Ukraine war have been arrested for giving out free copies of Nineteen
  Eighty-Four, while it remains forbidden to mention the novel’s title on
  Chinese social media. The Satanic Verses by Salman Rushdie The man who stabbed
  Rushdie in 2022, in an attempt to fulfil the Iranian fatwa, said at his
  sentencing that the writer “wants to bully other people. I don’t agree with
  that.” Apparently trying to kill people doesn’t count. Rushdie’s 1988 novel,
  which contains a dream-sequence riff on the life of the prophet Muhammad, was
  publicly burned in Bolton and Bradford, and banned in many countries including
  Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sudan, Sri Lanka and Venezuela. In India, though, the
  original banning order seems to have been lost, leading a court to state in
  2024 that it may no longer be valid. The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison
  Morrison’s debut novel, a fable about a young Black girl in the US who wishes
  her eyes would turn blue so that she would be perceived as beautiful, remains
  surprisingly controversial for a book that was published 55 years ago, coming
  in third on the American Library Association’s list of most frequently
  challenged books in 2024, and being banned in 29 school districts in the
  2022-3 school year. Her later novel Beloved is almost as popular a target,
  proving that winning a Nobel prize in literature does not suffice to make your
  work suitable for teenagers. Persepolis by Marjane Satrapi This graphic novel
  about a young woman growing up during the Islamic revolution in Iran was
  originally published in French in 2000. It was banned (as the author had
  foreseen) in Iran and for a while in Lebanon, but controversy struck when it
  was banned by the public schools of Chicago in 2013. That decision was later
  reversed, but Persepolis continues to be challenged and banned in states
  including, in 2023 and 24, Alaska, Iowa and Wisconsin. Such bans usually cite
  the book’s “graphic language and images” (a graphic novel is indeed likely to
  contain graphic images), though one complaining parent wrote to her Illinois
  school board to ask “why a book about Muslims was assigned on September 11”.
  China Dream by Ma Jian If you wanted to curry favour with the Chinese
  Communist party, you probably wouldn’t use as your novel’s title a phrase
  taken from President Xi himself, which he uses to describe a “great
  rejuvenation of the Chinese nation”, or indeed have as narrator an ambitious
  provincial political operative whose job is, as Ma has explained, “to suppress
  memories of the past and control speech in the present”. This 2018 novel is of
  course banned in China, as all Ma’s work has been since 1987, but it was the
  first that no Hong Kong publisher would touch, either. The party, he says, has
  “an army of censors”. Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov The novel that made Nabokov’s
  fortune was first published in France in 1955, since no American publisher
  would risk it. Its English-language publisher in France, Olympia Press, lost a
  lawsuit with the government the following year and the book was banned from
  sale. Meanwhile in Britain, it was illegal to import such “utter filth” and
  publication in the UK, as well as in Argentina and South Africa, was banned
  for several years: in New Zealand, it became legal only in 1964. For the New
  York Times in 1958 (when the French ban was lifted), Orville Prescott judged
  the novel “dull, dull, dull in a pretentious, florid and archly fatuous
  fashion”, and also “repulsive”. It is currently banned in three American
  school districts. Nineteen Minutes by Jodi Picoult This 2007 novel about a
  school shooting has the dubious honour of currently being the most widely
  sanctioned book by school districts in the US, according to writers’ group PEN
  America, with 98 bans. Does suppressing fiction about school shootings reduce
  the number of actual school shootings? This remains to be demonstrated. In any
  case, the most commonly cited reason for deeming Picoult’s novel unsuitable
  for teenagers is, as she explained at the Hay festival last year, her use on
  page 313 of the word “erection”. Lady Chatterley’s Lover by DH Lawrence The
  subject of the most celebrated obscenity trial of the 20th century, Lawrence’s
  pastoral romp was banned in Britain and other countries after its original
  private publication in 1928, though heavily expurgated versions were made
  available in the US and UK in 1932. Not until 1960 did a mainstream publisher,
  Penguin Books, attempt to bring out the full text, prompting a showdown with
  the government. “Is it a book you would have lying around in your own house?”
  asked the lead prosecutor on behalf of the Crown. “Is it a book you would even
  wish your wife or your servants to read?” The answer seemed to be yes, as
  Penguin won. Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher TV adaptations are usually good
  news for novels. After the 2017 Netflix adaptation of Asher’s YA teen-suicide
  novel hit the screens, the book was banned by school districts in eight US
  states. Some argued that the more sensationalised TV version was much more
  likely to have encouraged a seeming rash of real-life suicides in the
  following months. Banning the text, the author told a PBS interviewer, was
  likely to be counterproductive: “If we say issues of teen suicide, drinking,
  sex or sexual assaults are inappropriate, we’re telling teens who may identify
  with those themes that there isn’t a safe space for them.” Lysistrata by
  Aristophanes Aristophanes’s 2,500-year-old comedy about women who go on sex
  strike in order to stop the Greek city states from fighting each other is
  plainly likely to sap the masculine spirit of any modern nation-state that
  emphasises marital virtue. Logical, then, that it should have been banned in
  its homeland under the Nazi occupation and then under the military junta that
  took over Greece in 1967. From 1873, meanwhile, it was also banned in the US
  under the Comstock laws that prohibited lewd or obscene material from being
  sent through the post, a ban that was successfully overturned only in 1954.
  The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas Thomas’s much-admired YA novel about a Black
  teenager who sees her close friend shot by a police officer has, predictably,
  come high on the lists of books that are “most challenged” in American school
  districts since it was published in 2017. The various reasons include
  profanity, drug use and sexual references but also “racially insensitive
  language” – the latter a concern cited by the white superintendent of the Katy
  Independent School District in Texas, who personally pulled copies off the
  shelves. “You’re basically telling the kids … that their stories shouldn’t be
  told,” Thomas responded. “Well, I’m going to tell them even louder. Thanks for
  igniting the fire.” Fanny Hill by John Cleland Cleland wrote this pioneering
  18th-century tract of very bawdy fiction – ostensibly the “memoirs of a woman
  of pleasure” – while in debtors’ prison. Within a year of its publication his
  publishers had been hauled to court on suspicion of “corrupting the King’s
  subjects” and the book was officially withdrawn, though samizdat copies
  continued to circulate. In the early 19th century a pirated version was
  published in the US, leading to that publisher’s conviction in Massachusetts
  for printing something so “lewd and obscene”. Remarkably, police seized a new
  edition of the novel in London in the 1960s under the Obscene Publications Act
  of 1959, and the unexpurgated Fanny was not legally revealed until 1970. The
  Witches by Roald Dahl Dahl’s oeuvre has recently been the subject of
  enthusiastic Bowdlerisation by Puffin, which released politically corrected
  versions of his texts in 2023 that, among other things, removed the word
  “fat”. But The Witches (1983) had already long been the subject of complaints
  in American schools. While liberal critics thought it misogynist because Dahl
  writes that witches are always women, concerned American parents had it banned
  in Dallas, Oregon for promoting occultism, and in Dublin, Ohio on the curious
  grounds that it was “derogatory to children”. American Psycho by Bret Easton
  Ellis Ellis’s satirical masterpiece of men’s fashion, 1980s music pedantry and
  ultraviolence, having been dropped by its original publisher Simon &amp;
  Schuster only three months before its publication date and then rescued by
  Vintage, has excited outrage in the censorially minded forever after. In the
  late 1990s Germany restricted sales to adults only, and for many years it was
  officially banned from sale in the state of Queensland, Australia, though in
  one of literary freedom’s smallest ever victories it can now be purchased
  shrink-wrapped, as long as you are over 18. The Handmaid’s Tale by Margaret
  Atwood Any author who appears twice on such a list must be doing something
  right. Since her most famous novel is about a future United States devolving
  into a repressive sexist theocracy, the routine rightwing attempts to remove
  it from schools in the present-day US do come across as a case of protesting
  too much. The Handmaid’s Tale has been removed from school libraries in at
  least 10 US states. After it was made unavailable to high-school students in
  Madison County, Virginia, in 2023, Atwood suggested that perhaps the
  censorious wonks hoped to get teenagers interested in sex again by making
  mentions of it in print forbidden – and so irresistible. It remains banned in
  67 US school districts. Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut Vonnegut’s first
  bestseller, centring on the firebombing of Dresden (which he had witnessed
  first-hand), but also with a satirically freewheeling attitude to matters
  religious, sexual and cosmic, was something of a pioneer in the school-banning
  stakes. A mere three years after its 1969 publication, it was banned in
  schools in Oakland, Michigan for being, as a judge thought, “depraved,
  immoral, psychotic, vulgar and anti-Christian”. In 1973, copies were burned in
  North Dakota because of its “obscene language”. In 2010 a college professor
  complained: “This is a book that contains so much profane language, it would
  make a sailor blush with shame.” In 2024, the novel was banned by school
  boards in Texas and Florida. So it goes. • To browse the books in this article
