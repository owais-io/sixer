  Johnny Vegas on swapping comedy for ceramics: ‘You’ve got to be hungry for it,
  and right now, I’m hungry for sculpture’

  In a cavernous room in an old pottery factory, Johnny Vegas is approaching his
  work and his face is a delight. “Is it wrong to love your own pieces?” he
  says, seeing his sculptures for the first time in the place they will be
  shown, on a table lit by beams of dusty sunlight. Called Just Be There, and
  made in collaboration with the sculptor Emma Rodgers, each form is the result
  of two people embracing around a soft clay column. The huggers are mostly from
  Stoke-on-Trent, where Vegas’s work in the British Ceramics Biennial, one of
  more than 60 artists included, is being shown. Some are collapsed – thanks to
  a bear hug. Some are more restrained, the clay holding the imprint of people’s
  feelings about personal space. They’re robust and beautiful, and Vegas looks
  absolutely thrilled. The first time he produced a body of work to be on public
  show, it was for his ceramics degree finals and it ended up accidentally being
  thrown in a skip. To his tutors’ dismay he insisted on making sculpture rather
  than the technical ceramics he was supposed to be doing, and had produced a
  series of abstract female forms. He adds with a laugh: “At our final show,
  everybody kept writing, ‘I like your candlesticks’.” That, the skip and a
  third-class degree meant Vegas went off in what he calls “my little huff”, and
  became a successful comic instead, his former life relegated to a gag (he has
  sent up the potters’ wheel love scene from the film Ghost more than once). “In
  a way, I feel I’ve cheated myself,” he says, when we leave his work to be
  installed. Showbiz, he says, was “a big detour. I never made the time [for
  art], and I wish I had. I have so much time to make up for.” Now, in his 50s,
  he is doing just that. Last month’s Channel 4 documentary followed Vegas as he
  made a public art installation in St Helens, Merseyside, where he lives, and
  his joint exhibition with Rodgers at Liverpool’s Walker Art Gallery ended in
  June after more than a year. In the 90s, comedy replaced what he had been
  trying to do in art. Standup, realised Vegas, “was something I could do on my
  own creative terms. It’s yours, rise or fall.” Often drunk, unruly and
  anarchic, his stage persona Johnny Vegas was a vulnerable but demonic figure –
  the counterweight to his more anxious and sensitive real self, Michael
  Pennington. His 1997 Edinburgh show brought awards, attention and, inevitably,
  TV offers. “Then when you go into TV, everybody has an opinion and that slowly
  seeps into you.” Television tamed him. On panel shows, adverts and presenting
  jobs, the character of Johnny had lost that edge. “You wonder what younger
  comics make of you,” says Vegas. “As you get older, you also go: how much time
  have you got left to make a difference? Rather than just have a career, and
  cling on to it? Don’t make telly for the sake of making telly.” It was the
  same feeling, he says, that made him not want to sit at a wheel, turning out
  pots. “I’m really fortunate that whenever I’ve needed it most – in education,
  in later life – art turned up and rescued me, and gave me a different sense of
  purpose.” A chance meeting a few years ago with the renowned Wirral-based
  sculptor Rodgers led to an invitation to spend a day at her studio. She helped
  Vegas make a Jester, a forlorn figure representing Vegas’s unease. “That was a
  big point in my career where you’re going, what is success? Where has it took
  you?” Returning to art was “like this light had come on that had been dimming.
  There’s still a self-conscious, working-class part of me, but Emma really made
  me go, ‘you’re an artist, your ideas are valid’.” Vegas now has space in her
  studio, working in several media including clay, bronze and 3D printing, and
  Rodgers has become a mentor, chivvying him when he needs it, or making him
  stop before he goes too far on a piece. For many years Vegas had also been
  appalled at “the constant decline of art in education”. In 2022, he was
  diagnosed with ADHD, which explained a lot about his life. As a child, growing
  up in the 70s and 80s, “I was just seen as this slacker: ‘He refuses to try,
  or to concentrate.’ But I just wasn’t interested.” Art was what he was
  interested in – his father, a joiner, lobbied for Vegas to get a place doing
  A-level art, because of his obsessive drawing – and it worries him that we’re
  not providing the same opportunities to children today. “If they’re not
  necessarily academic, but they have gifts that lie elsewhere, they are being
  ignored. As we’re becoming more neurodiverse aware, we’re stepping further
  away from something where [many of those] children can excel.” Throughout the
  time Vegas was considering all this, and his rediscovery of art, the world was
  afflicted by the pandemic. He spent the first lockdown working out of his
  local pub, doing food drops for frontline workers and sourcing PPE. “It was
  the most rewarding thing I’ve done in years,” he says. He was busy, felt
  useful and his son was living with him (he has two children from two former
  marriages). The later lockdowns were harder – he spent them in isolation and
  struggled. He’d had a kiln installed at home but wasn’t creating much. The
  negative aspects of his then-undiagnosed ADHD “flourished and took over”. He
  developed agoraphobia which, for someone in the public eye, was particularly
  difficult. “Never leaving the house, this fear of expectations of what people
  want. Then everyone was back to the ‘new normal’, and I just couldn’t make the
  adjustment. It had a much more adverse effect on me than I thought, which is
  why, I suppose, now a lot of my work is still about re-engaging with people,
  society, and finding acceptance as ‘Michael’.” The idea for this current work
  came out of that period, “of how the first time somebody hugged me, it felt
  strange. Being so averse to a hug had suddenly become so alien. I want to
  investigate this idea of reconnection, and I wanted to find a way of capturing
  moments in time, how people interpret a hug.” A hug can feel overwhelming, or
  “it just lasts too long with somebody. It can be interpreted like an invasion
  of space.” Mostly though, he was aiming to express “the robust nature of love”
  – some of the “huggers” were couples, but others were friends, or parents and
  children. “I think those pieces are going, ‘Have a bit more faith in what
  you’ve got around you, family and friends, and society. Don’t give up’.” Vegas
  is about to tour the live stage show of the beloved cult BBC sitcom Ideal, but
  he can’t really see a return to standup comedy. “You’ve got to be hungry for
  it, and right now, I’m hungry for sculpture.” The idea of flight is prevalent
  in his previous work. The clay form, the result of a hug with his partner
  Vikki, is daubed with slip which looks like wings. When he was a child, he had
  a recurring dream he could fly. “And then from about the age of nine I never
  had that dream again. I think it was the first time I started experiencing
  anxiety and that replaced that hopefulness. So there’s that I’m always
  chasing.” Does he care what people think about his work, if they like it or
  not? “I’ve always cared what people think,” he says. “I think that’s what
  created Johnny – he became a defence mechanism.” But with art, he says, he
  craves a debate. “It takes me back to being a teenage student in the pub and
  people going, ‘Why do I pay my taxes so you can make bloody ashtrays?’ I
  embraced being an outsider in art. It was the first time that I went, I’m
  grateful to be different. I don’t want to be a total outcast but I’m grateful
  that this winds you up, that you would have such a reaction to art.” He laughs
  and says, “I’m absolutely prepared for somebody to go, ‘You haven’t finished
  it off. It’s got no handles. Did you drop that?’” In his standup shows, he
  loved a good heckle, as long as it was considered, rather than plain abusive.
  The difference with comedy, he says, is “it’s you in a room, with everybody
  listening, it’s the arena of the unwell. The beauty of making an object and
  leaving it open to interpretation is far more freeing.” • The British Ceramics
  Biennial is at various venues in Stoke-on-Trent from 6 September to 19 October
