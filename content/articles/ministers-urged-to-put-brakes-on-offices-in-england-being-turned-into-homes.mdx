  Dozens of organisations have signed an open letter calling on the government
  to scrap office-to-residential conversions in England, which analysis has
  found led to the loss of almost 28,000 affordable homes. Local government
  campaigners, housing providers and homelessness charities have all joined the
  call to abolish some permitted development rights (PDR), which grant automatic
  planning permission to building projects and are often used to convert office
  blocks into housing. A major point of contention is that PDR developments are
  not required to make affordable housing contributions. New analysis by the
  Local Government Association (LGA) has found that nearly 28,000 affordable
  homes have been lost due to office-to-residential conversions under PDR in the
  past 11 years. An amendment to the planning and infrastructure bill – the
  government’s flagship planning changes designed to speed up housebuilding –
  that would remove many PDR allowances is being debated in parliament on
  Monday. Dorothy Thornhill, a vice-president of the LGA who brought the
  amendment, said: “The impact of certain PDR rules has gone much further than
  was ever anticipated when they were first bought in. It is time they were
  scrapped. Councils and communities are losing out significantly because
  developers are able to circumvent the democratic planning process.” A letter
  signed by 39 campaigners, experts and groups, including Shelter, the Town and
  Country Planning Association, the National Association of Local Councils and
  the Association of Directors of Public Health, calls on the government to
  support the amendment. The letter calls the PDR policy “indefensible” and says
  the government needs to “ensure that the homes built today are not the
  poor-quality housing problems of tomorrow”. “Many would not meet the most
  basic fire safety and habitability standards had they been subject to the
  planning process,” the letter states. “Communities lose twice: on the quality
  and suitability of the homes, and on the schools, transport, green spaces and
  health services that make neighbourhoods thrive.” The LGA estimates more than
  110,000 new houses have been converted from offices under PDR since 2013,
  meaning councils were unable to enforce affordable housing contributions, or
  ensure the new homes were good quality, climate resilient or suitably located.
  Studies have shown that homes created through PDR are more likely to be
  substandard, smaller, darker, poorly ventilated and in unsuitable locations
  such as industrial estates and business parks. In Bristol there is a campaign
  to stop people being housed in a former office block that the housing charity
  Shelter says has been plagued with issues of damp, mould, disrepair,
  overcrowding, antisocial behaviour and rat infestations. More than 500 people,
  including local GPs and charities, signed an open letter calling on Bristol
  city council to move people out of Imperial Apartments, a three-storey office
  block converted into 466 flats under PDR. Residents report the heavy security
  and fire doors from its office days make it unsuitable for family living, and
  say the walls are thin and poorly insulated. LGA analysis found that a quarter
  of the 130,000 families living in temporary accommodation could be living in
  an affordable home if office conversions had contributed to affordable housing
  targets. Louise Gittins, the chair of the LGA, said the amendment “could be a
  gamechanger”. She said: “PDR allows developers to avoid contributing to
  affordable housing in the local area which has a real-world impact. A quarter
  of families in temporary accommodation could be permanently housed.” A
  spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government
  said: “The government is delivering the biggest boost to social and affordable
  housing in a generation backed by £39bn investment. “We recognise there has
  been criticisms of delivering homes using permitted development rights and
  that is why we continue to keep these rights under review.”
