  In 2014, a sergeant at a California state prison sent James “JJ’88” Jacobs,
  who was 25 at the time, to “the hole” – solitary confinement in a 6-by-6 cell.
  One bunk, one strip of a window. Jacobs had already been incarcerated for a
  decade by then; at 15, he was given a double life sentence for second-degree
  murder. Alone in the hole, Jacobs thought, as he always did, about the most
  devastating month of his life, April 2004: on the 16th, he shot and killed a
  young man in Bellflower, California. Three days later, another young man shot
  and killed his beloved older brother Victor. For years, Jacobs was caught in a
  terrible cycle of grief – for what he had done, for what had been done to him.
  In the hole, Jacobs would lie on the floor, eyes closed, and imagine his life
  outside prison. He’d make beats by pounding on his bunk or chest. A talented
  singer and rapper, he began to compose songs on notebook paper, along with
  treatments for imagined music videos. His lyrics that grappled with healing
  and reckoning – how to maintain self-worth in the face of devastating
  interpersonal and systemic violence, how to reconcile the worst thing you’ve
  ever done with your dignity as a human being. The prison kept Jacobs in the
  hole for 2.5 months – far longer than the 15 days the United Nations
  recognizes as torture. “Being in here, death always feels imminent,” Jacobs
  says in a recorded prison phone call at the beginning of the remarkable new
  documentary Songs from the Hole. “I have to manufacture hope. And the way I
  manufacture hope is by writing music.” Jacobs eventually managed to record
  rough demos of his tracks as JJ’88 and, a few years later, played some of them
  for Contessa Gayles, a documentary director then filming The Feminist on
  Cellblock Y at the prison. Jacobs and his co-facilitator of a prison reading
  group, richie reseda, “had a keyboard on a trash can in the corner of the gym
  – richie was on the keys and 88 was singing and rapping”, Gayles recalled
  recently. “I just saw how incredibly talented they were and how beautiful and
  intimate the storytelling was in 88’s lyrics.” The three stayed in touch, and
  once reseda was released, began working on an idea, finally realizing a music
  video or two based on Jacobs’s original treatments. The result is Songs from
  the Hole, a deeply moving and unconventional documentary that weaves Jacobs’s
  musical visions first developed in solitary – bits of his handwritten “first
  drafts/treatments for the visual album” appear on screen – with more
  traditional narrative footage of his life and loved ones outside prison. “At
  the outset, we were really trying to be intentional about it not feeling like
  a traditional or familiar incarceration film,” said Gayles. “We always
  understood this as not just an incarceration doc, but a music film, first and
  foremost. Creative expression was at the center.” Fittingly, much of Songs
  from the Hole plays out as the hip-hop visual album Jacobs initially
  envisioned in solitary – stories of his family, the west coast gang culture in
  which he was raised, and the prison industrial complex that entraps and
  punishes Black men, with actors playing his younger self and Victor. Gayles,
  reseda and Jacobs maintained an analog collaboration for years, some of which
  plays out on screen – handwritten snail mail, prison phone calls always capped
  at 15 minutes (“I didn’t always know when they were coming in, so I just had
  to be ready with the phone and the recorder,” said Gayles). The production
  team would mail stills from the dailies, printed on paper, back to Jacobs for
  his input. Though the film includes recreations of incarceration as well as
  photos and audio from prison, the trio were “intentional to not include any
  voices from the system”, said Gayles, instead focusing on the experience of
  incarcerated people and their loved ones. Over many months and appeals to the
  state for clemency, Gayles checks in on his mother, Janine, father William,
  sister Reneasha, and his partner Indigo, whom Jacobs met when she visited
  prison as part of a group working for restorative justice. The goal, said
  Gayles, was to make Jacobs “feel as present as possible while also putting the
  audience in a position of experiencing him in a similar way as his loved ones
  do – at a distance, primarily through the phone and letters”. In song and in
  those 15-minute prison phone calls, Jacobs describes how he followed his
  brother into life on the street and turned to violence as “a tool that I used
  for everything”. Guns were easy to come by. Jacobs describes, with hard-earned
  clarity, his adolescent mindset; at 15, he believed that shooting someone
  would earn him respect, make him a man. That belief shattered quickly,
  compounded and twisted by the rage and grief he felt at losing Victor three
  days later. “Part of what compelled me a lot about [Jacobs’s] story was the
  fact that he and his family were in this position of being on both sides of
  that type of deadly violence,” said Gayles. “He had the experience of taking a
  life, and then having a life taken from him.” For years, Jacobs felt angry and
  hopeless. He contemplated suicide. Then he met a fellow incarcerated man named
  Jay, who spoke with genuine contrition, remorse and grace about the life he
  took as a young man. Jay inspired Jacobs to think deeply about the family he
  had irrevocably harmed, a path forward that did not foreground anger. (The
  family, never named, did not participate in the film.) Jacobs’s journey toward
  forgiveness, both for himself and for his brother’s killer, comes to a head in
  a latter-half scene that left my jaw on the floor – both at the human capacity
  for compassion despite everything, and at the carceral system’s total lack of
  interest in it. Time and again, the California correctional system continued a
  cycle of violence, predicated on vengeance, that Jacobs sought to escape.
  “Violence isn’t the only answer to violence,” said Gayles. “When harm and
  violence happens, we don’t need to answer it by introducing more harm and
  violence through punishment, revenge, retribution, incarceration.” Jacobs’s
  partner Indigo puts it more bluntly: “My healing is not found in someone
  else’s punishment.” Despite the heavy subject matter, Songs from the Hole is
  anything but a portrait of despair. Jacobs endeavors to find joy – in
  education, in his family and fiancee, in the fact of being alive, in the
  “manufactured hope” of his art. And, finally, freedom – in 2020, California’s
  governor, Gavin Newsom, commuted Jacobs’s sentence based on the age at which
  he committed his crime and his rehabilitative work, making him immediately
  eligible for parole. In 2022, after 18 years in prison, Jacobs walked free.
  The film ends with footage of him in the studio recording new music, singing,
  enjoying the freedom to mess up a track, then record again. Jacobs’s
  burgeoning music career is evidence that “there are brilliant artists who are
  incarcerated, who have stories to tell that will impact and shift culture,”
  said Gayles. At one point in the film, still incarcerated and defeated by
  another legal setback, Jacobs made a list of reasons to keep living. It
  included his family, his partner, his art. The last one was a belief: “My
  shortcomings do not diminish my good.” Over 106 minutes, Songs from the Hole
  makes as good a case as one can to believe it. “We all have things in our
  lives that we need to heal from – harm that we have experienced and harm that
  we have caused,” said Gayles. “I hope that this film is just an entry point,
  and potentially a tool, for folks to heal.” Songs from the Hole is out now on
  Netflix This article was amended on 13 August 2025. An earlier version
  erroneously referred to a shooting outside a nightclub in Long Beach. It
  occurred in Bellflower, California, and was not outside a nightclub.
