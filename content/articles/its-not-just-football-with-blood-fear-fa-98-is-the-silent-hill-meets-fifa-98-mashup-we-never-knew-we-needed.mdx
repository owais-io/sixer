  ‘It’s not just football with blood’: Fear FA 98 is the Silent Hill meets Fifa
  98 mashup we never knew we needed

  Sometimes it’s the weirdest combinations that go best together: bacon and
  ice-cream, pilchards and custard, erm … Alison Hammond and Dermot O’Leary. But
  surely no one has thought of putting Silent Hill and Fifa 98 together before
  now. Billed as “the world’s first online survival horror football game,” Fear
  FA 98 (pronounced Fear-fa, like Fifa) has you pulling out knives, rusty
  scissors and syringes, summoning demons and using decapitated heads as the
  ball, in moves that make the likes of Diego “handball” Maradona and Luis
  “bitey” Suárez look like angelic stalwarts of the Fifa fair play guide.
  “People say this is just football with blood, but there’s a lot more to it
  than that,” says 35-year-old solo developer Jacob Jazz. “I’m mixing survival
  horror games like Silent Hill and Resident Evil with the gameplay of Fifa and
  eFootball Winning Eleven [Pro Evolution Soccer in the UK]. You need to play
  football to keep progressing in the story mode of a classic survival horror
  game.” The plot goes like this: Earth’s core has become a nest of colossal
  twisted serpents due to an event called the Transmigration, which saw an
  invasion of monsters from a dark and forbidden civilisation. Now, the bowels
  of the world churn with insatiable horror – like the terraces at Old Trafford
  come the Manchester derby. There’s an array of modes – one player,
  third-person horror, story, competitive and online – and whichever you go for,
  you’ll want to arm your team with serial killers, sectarians and psychopathic
  nurses to play at stadiums including the Backrooms, Sematary Hill and
  Chainsaws United. A quiet kickabout down the park this most certainly isn’t.
  Fear FA 98 has taken a year to develop and a successful Kickstarter campaign
  has now reached its €5,000 (£4,300) goal for a hopeful Halloween 2025 release
  on Steam. Switch, Xbox and PS5 ports may follow if Jazz can raise
  substantially more investment. A stand-alone tie-in with Nike – Nike Mare 98,
  featuring football-playing zombies in Nike trainers – is available to download
  for PC now. Jazz has been making games for 17 years. His portfolio includes
  the Baobabs Mausoleum horror series, which features the 8-bit retro adventure
  series Flamingo’s Creek, on Steam, Xbox and PS4. His other project, horror
  game Tamarindos Freaking Dinner, is coming soon to the Switch. Until now, he’s
  been testing his skills in the lower divisions of the PC games scene. Fear FA
  98 could help bring him to the premier league. • Fear FA 98 is set for release
  on PC in autumn
