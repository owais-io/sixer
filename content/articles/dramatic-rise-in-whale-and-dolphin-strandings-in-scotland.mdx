  The number of marine mammals stranded in Scotland has risen dramatically in
  the past 30 years, a study has found. From 1992 to 2022, 5,147 cetaceans died
  on Scottish shores, and a new paper shows steep increases in the rate of
  strandings of up to 800% in some species, continuing exponentially every year.
  The paper, by the University of Glasgow’s Scottish marine animal stranding
  scheme (Smass), follows this summer’s extraordinary sequence of rarely seen,
  deep-diving whale species stranding on northern European shores. Over a period
  of just over two weeks, 36 beaked whales and pilot whales were found in
  locations from western and southern Ireland to Orkney, Norfolk, the
  Netherlands and southern Sweden. The animals appeared to have entered shallow
  seas where they could not forage for their usual foods such as deep-sea squid.
  The widespread locations of these events is provoking serious concern,
  especially among volunteer groups who work to save the stranded whales –
  without success, in all of the above cases. “Clusters of beaked whales should
  raise suspicions,” said Dr Andrew Brownlow, the director of Smass. It is
  believed that sonic disturbance can cause deep-diving whales to strand. Rachel
  Lennon, the lead author of the paper published in the journal Scientific
  Reports, said that in Scotland “sources of anthropogenic noise are abundant,
  including seismic survey air guns and drilling from industrial construction”.
  The new paper does not cite concerns that military sonar exercises in the open
  ocean are a known factor in such events. Brownlow noted that a “globally
  unprecendented number” of 118 stranded beaked whales off Ireland and western
  Scotland in 2018 was traced to a single sound source off the continental
  shelf. The paper appears only weeks after Smass scientists attended the
  strandings of four northern bottlenose whales – another beaked whale species –
  and a pod of 23 pilot whales on the Orkney islands. The pilot whale stranding
  came almost exactly a year after a record 77 of the same species stranded on
  the same Orkney beach. A total of 150 animals have mass stranded off Scotland
  this year. Smass scientists are also concerned that the number of stranded
  baleen whales such as fin, minke and humpback whales has risen sharply over
  the survey period. This may be due to more animals moving north as waters warm
  due to climate breakdown. It may also be a delayed result of the cessation of
  whale hunting – Lennon noted that “as populations begin to recover from the
  impacts of historic whaling, reports of entanglement have increased”. As
  surface feeders, baleen whales are prone to being caught in fishing gear,
  leading to protracted deaths from starvation or infection. The paper also
  shows an increase in the number of stranded common dolphins and harbour
  porpoises, which can be vulnerable to collisions with leisure craft. The
  30-year report shows that stranded whales and dolphins act as “sentinels” –
  visible warning signs of how human activity is affecting the marine
  environment. “Clearly the oceans are changing,” Brownlow said, “and Scotland
  is on the edge of this flux. We now get sperm whales calving off our shores
  whereas we never saw females in these northern waters before. Beaked whales
  only used to be recorded in small numbers in the autumn. Temperature,
  salinity, distribution of prey, oceanic heatwaves – the pattern is moving, and
  we need to be better at working out where these animals are, and when. “This
  is the new normal, and we must tread as softly as we can.”
