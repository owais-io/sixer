  Chelsea have agreed to pay an initial €40m (£35.5m) for Jorrel Hato, with the
  teenage Ajax defender set to sign a seven-year contract at Stamford Bridge
  having already agreed personal terms. The Netherlands defender is due to fly
  to London for his medical in the coming days after Chelsea finalised the terms
  of the deal, which it is understood includes significant add-ons. The
  19-year-old has made more than 100 appearances for Ajax’s first team and is
  capable of playing as a left-back or in central defence. He fits Chelsea’s
  policy of signing promising young players on long-term deals. Hato was not
  included in Ajax’s squad for pre-season competition the Como Cup on Sunday in
  anticipation of his impending move to Chelsea. In 2023 he became the youngest
  player to captain Ajax aged 17 and made his senior international debut a few
  weeks later. He is regarded as one of Europe’s brightest prospects and was
  part of the Netherlands Under-21 side that lost to England in the semi-finals
  of the European Championship in Slovakia last month. He will become Chelsea’s
  seventh signing of the summer after the arrivals of Liam Delap, João Pedro,
  Jamie Gittens, Estêvão, Dário Essugo and Mamadou Sarr. They are also in talks
  with RB Leipzig over a move for Xavi Simons, with the Netherlands forward
  thought to be valued at around €70m. The 22-year-old, who is capable of
  playing in several attacking roles, joined Leipzig from Paris Saint-Germain in
  January for €50m after two successful loan spells. Simons has also attracted
  interest from Bayern Munich but is thought to prefer a move to the Premier
  League. Chelsea have already sanctioned the departures of Kepa Arrizabalaga,
  Noni Madueke and Djordje Petrovic, while João Félix joined the Saudi Pro
  League side Al-Nassr on Tuesday after a £44m deal was agreed.
