  Manchester United – bloody hell: after a chaotic display in regular time that
  somehow pulled them back to 2-2 and penalties, Ruben Amorim’s rabble lost a
  fevered shootout 12-11. When Bryan Mbeumo’s kick smacked Christy Pym’s bar
  Grimsby entered the nirvana of a cup-shock for the ages and the faithful’s
  song of “Oh when the Town go steaming in” sweetly summed up what they did to
  United. United were two down by the interval and appeared heading out after
  Charles Vernam and Tyrell Warren first-half strikes had the 20-times English
  champions facing a humiliating oblivion from the Carabao Cup. But a
  75th-minute Mbeumo finish handed United a lifeline before Maguire’s stooping
  header squeezed in at the near post took the game to the penalty lottery.
  Amorim’s men lost it, so, let the inquest begin. On a smooth green sward that
  allowed no excuse the XI Amorim sent out in search of an opening win of the
  campaign that showed eight changes. Alongside Mainoo, Benjamin Sesko, André
  Onana, Harry Maguire and Manuel Ugarte were other headline acts given first
  starts and who failed to quieten a rambunctious home fancy in a chastening 45
  minutes. Cameron McJannet’s clatter on Amad Diallo that left the No 10
  collapsed telegrammed what David Artell’s team were about. Then, when Cam
  Gardner rose to “oohs” from the Mariners congregation the centre-forward had a
  chance to beat Onana but headed into his gloves. United were under the pump. A
  Vernam corner from the left threatened to arrow over Onana and in before the
  goalkeeper scurried back and tipped over. Artell had drilled his men to tap
  the ball about around halfway then up tempo to stampede at United. Or rush up
  to a man in red to squeeze them: precisely how they took the lead. Under
  pressure Diallo miscontrolled, tried to retrieve the ball, he and Ugarte
  bumped into each other, pratfalled, and Grimsby tookover. A quick right-left
  Darragh Burns diagonal turned United, put Vernam in, and he beat Onana at his
  near post: the Cameroonian should have saved so here was the latest howler
  from a man between United’s sticks. Amorim fielded repeated volleys of “you’re
  getting sacked in the morning” from an ecstatic Grimsby support whose volume
  matched the whirling energy of their men. Next all entered dreamland. A short
  Vernam corner on the left was returned to the No 30 whose delivery sliced in
  menacingly. Onana rose above a thicket of players and, farcically, missed a
  clearing punch, the ball dropped to Tyrell Warren, who rolled home against the
  club he left in 2019. This time the chants from fans were a cutting, ‘Can we
  play you every week,’ and ‘Premier League/you’re having a laugh’. They had a
  point. Grimsby were in cruise control, toying with their shellshocked guest.
  When Sesko managed a header you were reminded that United were allowed to
  attack, too. At the interval Amorim had to start earning his lucrative wage.
  Tyler Fredericson, Patrick Dorgu and Ugarte were hooked for Matthijs De Ligt,
  Bryan Mbuemo and Bruno Fernandes. Calling for the cavalry crystallised how
  dire United were. An early foray had Cunha nodding into Pym’s hands. This was
  positive but Amorim’s face broke to bitter disappointment. In rain bucketing
  down the League Two side poured forward and a Burns effort went for a corner
  as, again, United’s noses were bloodied. The downpour, becoming biblical, had
  the surface greasy and skiddy – perfect for a side on a mission to pen an
  immortal chapter in the club history. United were jammed in a catch-22 of
  needing to press in the quest to pull a goal back while not daring to leave
  space for Artell’s ruthless unit to prosper once more. Example: Grimsby moved
  along their right, swapped passes, and lifted a high-ball in – the omnipotent
  Vernam leaped and bounced a header into the ground and for a moment you
  wondered if Onana might mishandle. But, he clutched the ball safely. So far
  Amorim’s substitutions had failed to engineer any dominance or create any
  regular openings. When Diallo, down the right, was flagged offside Amorin
  dipped his head in anguish – a regular feeling for him. Better was a Fernandes
  shoulder-dip-then-unload: the ball skimmed across the water for Pym’s left
  corner but the keeper dove and held admirably. Amorim, despairing, sent for a
  favourite player, Mason Mount, who replaced Ayden Heaven. When Mbeumo’s strike
  came United still seemed a universe away from levelling. But they do possess
  spirit, as personified by Maguire with his equaliser.
