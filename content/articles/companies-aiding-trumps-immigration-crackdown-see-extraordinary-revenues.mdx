  The tech, surveillance and private prison providers arming Donald Trump’s
  massive expansion and weaponization of immigration enforcement are running a
  victory lap after reporting their latest financial results. Palantir, the tech
  firm, and Geo Group and CoreCivic, the private prison and surveillance
  companies, said this week that they brought in more money than Wall Street
  expected them to, thanks to the administration’s crackdown on immigrants.
  “Well, as usual, I’ve been cautioned to be a little modest about our bombastic
  numbers,” said Alex Karp, the Palantir chief executive, in an investor call
  earlier this week. Then he crowed about the company’s “extraordinary numbers”
  and his “enormous pride” in its success. Private prison company executives,
  during their respective calls, could barely contain their excitement, flagging
  to investors opportunities for “unprecedented growth” in the realm of
  immigration detention. Palantir saw 53% growth in revenue from US government
  contracts in the second quarter of 2025 compared with the same period the year
  prior and surpassed $1bn in total quarterly revenue for the first time.
  Analysts had expected the company to bring in $939.4m in revenue. The company,
  which connects and analyzes disparate sets of data to enable its customers to
  build products with that information, brings in the majority of its revenue
  from government contracts. Its biggest US customer is the Department of
  Defense, where the US army, which announced a $10bn agreement with Palantir
  last week, is housed. On the immigration side, the Department of Homeland
  Security (DHS) has deepened its partnership with Palantir since the start of
  the Trump administration, which it’s been working with since 2011. Immigration
  and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the agency primarily engaged in arresting,
  detaining and deporting immigrants, most recently announced a $30m contract
  with Palantir to build a database that makes its deportation and detention
  machine more efficient. “Palantir gets attacked just because we help make this
  country even better, because we support the values, because we defend it,”
  Karp said. “And us being able to win while having an opinion does have an
  impact on the world, if only because the people who think we are wrong are not
  good, have to be a little jealous and suffer.” While Palantir is making it
  easier to deport immigrants, private prison corporations GeoGroup and
  CoreCivic are bringing in more money than expected helping detain them.
  GeoGroup reported $636.2m in revenue this quarter, beating analyst predictions
  of $623.4m, while CoreCivic announced $538.2m in the second quarter of this
  year, a 9.8% increase from last year’s second quarter. George Zoley, the
  GeoGroup company chief executive, said its detention facilities are fuller
  than they’ve ever been, with Ice using 20,000 beds across 21 GeoGroup
  detention centers, about one-third of the estimated 57,000 beds in Ice
  detention centers across the country. GeoGroup executives also said in the
  call they have begun exploring detention centers at US military sites, one of
  the many “unprecedented growth opportunities” Zoley spoke of during the call.
  Waiting for the surveillance boom While there has been a big boost to
  GeoGroup’s detention business, its surveillance subsidiary is not yet seeing
  the massive growth company executives predicted earlier this year. Executives
  said they expected the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP) – an
  immigrant monitoring initiative run by the company’s subsidiary BI Inc for 20
  years – would expand beyond its previous peak of 370,000 immigrants being
  monitored. The number of immigrants who are currently being surveilled by Ice
  has hovered around 183,000 for the past few months. “[ICE hasn’t] communicated
  at this time the expansion of ISAP,” Zoley said on the investor call. “Their
  focus is intensely on scaling up the detention capacity.” That said, the
  company expects ISAP numbers to start increasing next year once “detention
  capacity is maximized”. The Trump administration has signaled a desire to
  increase the number of immigrants surveilled by ankle monitors. Many
  immigrants have described ISAP surveillance as intrusive, at times physically
  painful and inefficient. In the call with investors, CoreCivic executives
  revealed they have offered Ice around 30,000 beds to detain immigrants
  throughout the company’s nationwide network. Ice’s expansion heralds future
  financial gain The One Big Beautiful Bill Act legislation was passed by
  Congress and signed by Trump last month, providing DHS a massive influx of
  cash. Ice was given $45bn to expand its detention network. Ice currently has
  funds for around 41,500 beds but is currently detaining around 57,000 people
  throughout its detention network. With the incoming influx of cash, the agency
  will have the funds to likely detain thousands upon thousands more – and
  private prison contractors are ready. “Our business is perfectly aligned with
  the demands of this moment,” said Damon T Hininger, the CEO of CoreCivic,
  during Thursday’s call with investors. “We are in an unprecedented
  environment, with rapid increases in federal detention populations nationwide
  and a continuing need for solutions we provide.” As the office of management
  and budget readies the finances from the spending package, private prison
  companies have wasted no time in selling their services to immigration
  officials. “As we know, budgets are moral documents, and last month Congress
  decided to fully fund cruelty aimed at immigrant communities at the expense of
  vital programs that serve all Americans,” said Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy
  director for the Detention Watch Network. “Private prison companies have been
  giddy since last November about the prospect of making money at the expense of
  all of us.” Since Trump took office again this year, CoreCivic has modified,
  extended or signed new contracts to detain immigrants at eight different
  facilities, according to company financial disclosures. Geo Group has done the
  same with five different facilities. The earning calls from the two companies
  come as immigrant rights organizations and human rights groups criticize
  conditions inside immigration jails nationwide. Setareh added that private
  prison companies’ profits come from “the destruction of human lives as
  directed by the Trump administration and made possible by the majority
  Congress”. A CoreCivic facility in New Mexico where immigrants and federal
  prisoners are detained, the Cibola correctional facility, is currently under
  investigation by the FBI for an “epidemic” of drug trafficking, as the
  Guardian recently revealed. At least 15 people have died inside that facility
  since 2018. Last September, the company pitched Cibola to Ice as an ideal
  place to detain more immigrants.
