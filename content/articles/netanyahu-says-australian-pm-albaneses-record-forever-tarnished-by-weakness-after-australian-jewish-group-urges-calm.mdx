  Benjamin Netanyahu has doubled down on his criticism of Anthony Albanese as a
  “weak” leader amid a bitter row, claiming the Australian prime minister has
  “forever tarnished” his reputation. Tensions between the Netanyahu and
  Albanese government have escalated this week following the cancellation of a
  visa for far-right Israeli politician Simcha Rothman to visit Australia,
  culminating in a week-long diplomatic jousting match. In an interview with Sky
  News commentator Sharri Markson on Thursday night, the Israeli prime minister
  said Albanese’s record is “forever tarnished” after announcing his intention
  to recognise a Palestinian state. “I’m sure he has a reputable record as a
  public servant, but I think his record is forever tarnished by the weakness
  that he showed in the face of these Hamas terrorist monsters,” Netanyahu said.
  “It is wrong because to offer [Hamas] a state, when they had a state, a de
  facto state in Gaza, and they used it for murder, pillage and monstrous crimes
  is to reward terrorism, and I think that’s a sign of weakness, that, as I
  said, will tarnish the prime minister’s record.” The health minister, Mark
  Butler, described Netanyahu’s comments to Sky News as “frankly ridiculous”,
  adding Australia would not change its position “because of a particular
  position taken by any other world leader”. The fresh comments came a day after
  Australia’s peak Jewish group, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry
  (ECAJ), labelled Israeli prime minister Netanyahu’s attack on Albanese as
  “inflammatory and provocative”, and a “clumsy intervention” which had affected
  Australia’s Jewish community. Albanese initially played down Netanyahu’s first
  statement on Wednesday, in which he described the Australian prime minister as
  a “weak politician who betrayed Israel and abandoned Australia’s Jews”. “I
  don’t take these things personally. I engage with people diplomatically, he
  [Netanyahu] has had similar things to say about other leaders,” he said. The
  16-minute interview on Thursday night canvassed a number of issues, including
  a two-state solution and the humanitarian and aid crisis in Gaza. Netanyahu
  said Australia’s decision to recognise a Palestinian state, which follows
  similar decisions by the UK, France and Canada, was “appeasement” to Hamas,
  comparing the move to Adolf Hitler’s invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1938.
  “We’re not going to repeat that,” he said. “They want to put Israel at
  tremendous risk by giving this strategic piece of land right next to Jerusalem
  and Tel Aviv, to these Palestinians who want to destroy Israel, they don’t
  even hide it … we’re not going to repeat the mistakes that were made prior to
  world war two.” The shadow defence minister, Angus Taylor, told Sky Albanese’s
  decision to recognise Palestine showed he had “capitulated to the left of his
  party” and was an “unrealistic” for Israel to accept while Hamas remained in
  control of Gaza. Netanyahu also dismissed as “lies” reports Israel is
  deliberately starving the Gazan population and said media outlets reporting
  the humanitarian crisis “should be ashamed of themselves for propagating
  this”. In July, the World Health Organisation warned Gazans were suffering
  from a man-made mass starvation caused by Israel’s blockade of aid into the
  territory. UN officials reported that the Israeli military had killed more
  than 1,000 Palestinians trying to reach food distribution sites between the
  end of May and end of July. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The Palestinian
  ministry of foreign affairs on Wednesday called Netanyahu’s criticism of
  Australia and France in recent days “unjustifiable and hostile to peace”. “The
  ministry affirms that conflating recognition of the state of Palestine with
  antisemitism and interfering in the internal affairs of France and Australia
  is unjustifiable, hostile to peace, and contrary to the international
  consensus on the principle of the two-state solution,” it said. France’s
  president, Emmanuel Macron, had hit back at Netanyahu’s claim antisemitism was
  rising in the country as “erroneous” and “abject”, adding it “will not go
  unanswered”. On Tuesday, Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, announced he
  would revoke the visas of three Australian diplomats to the Palestinian
  Authority working in the West Bank city of Ramallah following Australia’s
  decision to cancel Rothman’s visa. Sa’ar accused the Australian government of
  “choosing to fuel” antisemitism through the decision against the backdrop of
  its intention to recognise a Palestinian state. Australia’s foreign affairs
  minister, Penny Wong, labelled the reaction “unjustified” at a time when
  “dialogue and diplomacy are needed more than ever”. The foreign affairs
  department’s Smartraveller site was updated on Thursday to confirm Australia’s
  operations in Ramallah had been suspended as a result. “Our ability to provide
  consular assistance in the Occupied Palestinian Territories is extremely
  limited,” it said. “Australians in need of consular assistance should contact
  the Australian Embassy in Tel Aviv or Australian Embassy in Jordan.”
