  When we first met, 12 years ago, my husband and I didn’t waste any time in
  starting the sexual part of our relationship. He warned me he was a sex
  addict, and I am enthusiastic about sex. On our first night together I was
  aware of some erectile dysfunction – he wasn’t entirely hard and benefited
  from holding himself when penetrating me – though this didn’t stop us reaching
  climax. We joked about how many times I would orgasm and neither of us seemed
  inhibited. Over time, my husband needed more and more help with ejaculating
  and would often lose his erection during sex. He has shown less interest in
  any form of intimacy with me, while I have been trying to show my attraction
  to him in other ways, like hugging and holding hands. About six months into
  our relationship, I became aware he was using online pornography while I was
  out of the house. It seemed that it was porn he was addicted to, rather than
  the act of sex. It upset me, as I know people who have been exploited in the
  industry. We discussed this, and he seemed to understand, but his porn use
  became more entrenched, while our sex life has diminished. On the odd occasion
  when we try to have sex, he struggles to achieve an erection, whether it’s me
  or him initiating. When we do start, his erection fades away within moments. I
  try to reassure him, but I feel embarrassed and worthless as a partner, and I
  miss him terribly. It has been more than a year since we last tried to be
  intimate. Is there any way back? Compulsivity of thought or actions, no matter
  how it is expressed, is related to anxiety and other psychological issues.
  Your husband’s compulsivity – in relation to porn use and perhaps to other
  things as well – seems to have become so entrenched that it is now a problem
  for both of you, for which he probably needs treatment and you need support.
  But it is not necessarily the reason for your dwindling sex life. In fact, he
  may be using porn to try to achieve erections and prove that he is capable of
  them in a situation where he will not feel judged. A man’s relationship with
  his penis is complex. If it doesn’t work as well as he or his partner want it
  to, he experiences shame and anxiety and, the next time he tries to become
  erect, his anxiety can lead to repeat failure as a self-fulfilling prophecy.
  With continued failure, a man will often withdraw from sex with a partner (no
  matter how understanding they are) because he simply cannot face another
  failure. Erectile dysfunction is treatable, and it is important to find the
  cause. And repeated erectile failures need to be investigated because they can
  be a symptom of a serious medical condition. Try to persuade him to seek
  professional consultation. Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based
  psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders. If you would
  like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your
  concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don’t send attachments).
  Each week, Pamela chooses one problem to answer, which will be published
  online. She regrets that she cannot enter into personal correspondence.
