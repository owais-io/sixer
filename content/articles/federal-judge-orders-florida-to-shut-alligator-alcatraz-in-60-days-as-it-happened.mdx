  This concludes our running chronicle of the second Trump administration for
  Thursday, but we will be back on Friday morning. In the meantime, here are
  some of the latest developments: California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, signed a
  law to hold a special election in November in which voters will be asked to
  approve a new congressional map, tilted in favor of Democrats, for the 2026,
  2028 and 2030 elections, if Texas goes ahead with a plan to do the same for
  Republicans. Donald Trump ventured from the White House in his motorcade
  through the not all that mean streets of Washington DC to deliver pizza and
  hamburgers to law enforcement officers and National Guard troops, and regale
  them with his plans to upgrade the grass in the district to make it look more
  like one of his golf courses. “I know more about grass than any human being I
  think anywhere in the world”, the commander-in-chief told the officers. A
  federal judge ruled that Trump’s former lawyer and campaign surrogate, Alina
  Habba, has been unlawfully serving as the the top federal prosecutor in New
  Jersey. A New York state appeals court tossed out a half-billion-dollar
  penalty that Trump had been ordered to pay after a judge found the president
  fraudulently overstated the value of his properties and other assets to
  bolster his family business. Despite the president falsely claiming the ruling
  to be a “total victory”, the five-judge panel let the lower court’s fraud
  verdict stand, which paves the way for New York attorney general Letitia James
  to appeal the decision to the state’s highest court. The Trump administration
  ratcheted up pressure on the Federal Reserve to remove governor Lisa Cook,
  after the economist declared she had “no intention of being bullied” into
  stepping down. A federal judge on Thursday barred the DeSantis and Trump
  administrations from bringing new detainees to the detention facility called
  Alligator Alcatraz and ordered the state begin closing operations at the
  immigration detention site within 60 days. In her order, US district judge
  Kathleen Williams barred the state and federal governments from bringing new
  detainees to the detention center and stopped any expansion of the facility,
  including new lighting or any new buildings, including tents. As the Miami
  Herald reports, the temporary injunction comes in response to a lawsuit filed
  by environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe in which they argue that the
  state and federal governments cut corners when erecting the site in a matter
  of days. The environmental groups argue that the hasty construction of the
  facility violated the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires
  federal agencies to consider alternatives, consult the public and assess the
  environmental impact of building projects. The White House has released a
  social media video highlighting the start of Donald Trump’s remarks to law
  enforcement officers and National Guard soldiers on Thursday, which begins
  with the president mocking his predecessor, Joe Biden, for once falling as he
  walked up a flight of stairs to Air Force One. The video, which was recorded
  by Margo Martin, a special assistant to the president and communications
  advisor, captures the beginning of Trump’s rambling 12-minute speech in which
  he essentially congratulated himself on successfully walking down a single
  step as he began his remarks. “You gotta be very careful; you don’t want to
  slip or fall like somebody else I know”, Trump said, to laughter from the
  officers. “We don’t want that to happen”. The video then cuts, to omit the
  part of the original recording in which Trump turned to Martin and said,
  “Where are we going Margo, over here?” The president then thanked the
  assembled officers, who are taking part in his federal takeover of policing in
  the district. “The numbers are down like we wouldn’t believe, but we believe
  it”, Trump added. The administration has repeatedly suggested without evidence
  that data gathered by the DC police, and released by the justice department,
  showing that violent crime was at a 30-year low when Trump returned to office
  in January, and had declined by a further 26% since then, had been manipulated
  to hide what Trump has called a terrifying crime wave. Video of Joe Biden
  falling, repeatedly, while boarding Air Force One in 2021, when he was 79, was
  widely seen and helped cement the idea that he was too old to be president. In
  June, the week Trump turned 79, video of him stumbling and nearly falling
  while climbing the stairs to Air Force One was also widely seen. The supreme
  court ruled by a 5-4 vote on Thursday that the Trump administration can cut
  $783m of research funding for health projects that promote diversity, equity
  and inclusion, what the government calls “gender ideology” and vaccine
  hesitancy, the supreme court decided on Thursday. The court lifted a judge’s
  order blocking cuts made by the National Institutes of Health to align with
  Donald Trump’s priorities. The court split 5-4 on the decision. The chief
  justice, John Roberts, was among those who wouldn’t have allowed the cuts,
  along with the court’s three Democratic appointees. The high court did keep
  the Trump administration’s anti-DEI directive blocked for future funding with
  a key vote from justice Amy Coney Barrett, however. The decision marks the
  latest supreme court victory for Trump and allows the administration to forge
  ahead with canceling hundreds of grants while a lawsuit brought by 16
  Democratic state attorneys general and public-health advocacy groups
  continues. The plaintiffs said the decision is a “significant setback for
  public health”, but keeping the directive blocked means the administration
  can’t use it to cut more studies. The justice department, meanwhile, has said
  funding decisions should not be “subject to judicial second-guessing” and
  efforts to promote policies referred to as DEI can “conceal insidious racial
  discrimination”. The lawsuit addresses only part of the estimated $12bn of NIH
  research projects that have been cut. The plaintiffs unsuccessfully argued
  that defunding studies midway through halts research, ruins data already
  collected and ultimately harms the country’s potential for scientific
  breakthroughs by disrupting scientists’ work in the middle of their careers.
  Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote a lengthy dissent in which she criticized
  both the outcome and her colleagues’ willingness to continue allowing the
  administration to use the court’s emergency appeals process. “This is
  Calvinball jurisprudence with a twist. Calvinball has only one rule: there are
  no fixed rules. We seem to have two: that one, and this administration always
  wins,” she wrote, referring to a fictional game in the comic strip Calvin and
  Hobbes in which rules are made up on the fly. Lloyd Doggett, a Democratic
  Texas congressperson, who has represented his hometown of Austin for over 50
  years in the state legislature and Congress, announced on Thursday that he
  would not run for reelection if a new Republican-drawn map is used, which
  would pit him against fellow Democrat Greg Casar in the 2026 midterms.
  Doggett, who is 78, said that he had decided not to run against Casar, 36, who
  is less than half his age. Texas Republicans are pushing ahead with the rare
  mid-decade redistricting requested by Donald Trump. Part of the plan to create
  more Republican-leaning seats is to pack as many Democrats into a single
  Austin district as possible, rather than keeping the city’s two
  Democratic-majority districts. “With the approval of the crooked Trump maps
  imminent, the future of redistricting turns next to the courts,” Doggett said
  in his statement. “If this racially gerrymandered Trump map is rejected, as it
  should be, I will continue seeking reelection in Congressional District 37 to
  represent my neighbors in the only town I have ever called home. If the courts
  give Trump a victory in his scheme to maintain control of a compliant House, I
  will not seek reelection in the reconfigured CD37, even though it contains
  over 2/3rd of my current constituents.” Doggett also noted that he had hoped
  that Casar would try to hold on to his seat in a redrawn district around San
  Antonio, but had chosen to run for the Austin seat instead. “I had hoped that
  my commitment to reelection under any circumstances would encourage
  Congressman Casar to not surrender his winnable district to Trump”, Doggett
  said. “While his apparent decision is most unfortunate, I prefer to devote the
  coming months to fighting Trump tyranny and serving Austin rather than waging
  a struggle with fellow Democrats.” If the Trump-directed “extreme
  gerrymandering prevails”, Doggett added, “I wish Congressman Casar the best.”
  California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, signed legislation on Thursday that will
  ask the state’s voters to decide in November if they approve of redrawn
  congressional districts that tilt heavily in favor of Democrats, as a way of
  neutralizing a similarly partisan map in Texas. “They fired the first shot,
  Texas,” Newsom said before signing the bill, noting that California’s new map
  would only be used if Texas uses new maps tilted in favor of Republicans. “We
  wouldn’t be here had Texas not done what they just did; Donald Trump didn’t do
  what he just did. He went so far as to follow up and say that he didn’t just
  want those five seats, he said he’s, quote-unquote, entitled to those five
  seats. Just pause and reflect on that. Everything should have just stopped
  there. The president of the United States claiming he’s ‘entitled’ to five
  seats. That should put chills up your spine, every Republican, not just
  Democrat and independent, every American.” Newsom also said that California
  would be “the first state in US history to, in the most democratic way, to
  submit to the people of our state the ability to determine their own maps”.
  The map that could give California Democrats five more seats was drawn by Paul
  Mitchell, founder of Redistricting Partners, a nonpartisan local redistricting
  firm, who previously created maps for independent redistricting commissions
  across California. “All of us support independent redistricting, here in
  California and in every state in this union” Mike McGuire, another Democratic
  state leader and senate president pro tempore, said. “One thing that we do not
  support is unilateral disarmament, when the fairness of the 2026 election is
  being threatened.” California lawmakers have authorized a November special
  election to ask voters to redraw the state’s congressional boundaries and
  create five new potentially Democratic US House seats. The state legislature
  voted to advance the redistricting plan on Thursday after hours of debate. The
  state’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, who has led the redistricting push,
  is expected to sign the bill shortly. The effort in California is an answer to
  the Republican redistricting push in Texas, sought by Donald Trump, aimed at
  tilting the map in his party’s favor before next year’s midterm elections. The
  nation’s two most populous – and ideologically opposed – states were racing on
  parallel tracks toward consequential redistricting votes, potentially within
  hours of each other. As Democrats in Sacramento advanced a legislative package
  that would put their “election rigging response act” before voters in a
  special election this fall, Republicans in Austin were nearing a final vote on
  their own gerrymandering pursuit. The California legislature on Thursday
  approved a plan to hold a special election in November in which voters will be
  asked to approve new congressional districts, redrawn in favor of Democrats,
  as a means of nullifying a gerrymandered map on its way to final approval in
  Texas. The effort in California is an answer to the Republican redistricting
  push in Texas, sought by Donald Trump and aimed at tilting the map in his
  party’s favor before next year’s midterm elections. The nation’s two most
  populous – and ideologically opposed – states raced on parallel tracks to
  redistrict ahead of the 2026 midterms. So far, what was billed as a
  “ride-along” with law enforcement on the streets of Washington DC, has turned
  out to be mostly Donald Trump giving a short rally-style address to about 300
  officers from the DC Metropolitan Police, the FBI, the National Guard,
  homeland security investigations, the DEA, ATF and US Marshals service. The
  president repeated his familiar attacks on renewable energy, telling the
  officers: “It’s it’s a very expensive form of energy, and we’re not doing the
  wind”. He also boasted about his legal victory on Thursday, when a New York
  appeals court threw out a multi-million dollar financial penalty against him
  after his conviction for fraud. Although the fraud conviction remains in
  place, Trump falsely implied that the judges had overturned his conviction.
  “We’re having a lot of victories. I had a victory today”, he said. “You know,
  they stole $550 million from me with a fake case, and it was overturned. They
  said this was a fake case. It’s a terrible thing, but it’s a nice victory, you
  know? I mean, it’s not bad, we all have, we all have our limits. But this was
  a terrible thing that it was a witch hunt”. He then invited several cabinet
  members and aides, including the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, and
  the interior secretary, Doug Burgum, to make remarks, which were focused on
  praising the president. Among Trump’s comments was a promise to clean up
  Washington DC, including its grass. “One of the things we are going to be
  redoing is your parks. I’m very good at grass ‘cause I have a lot of golf
  courses all over the place. I know more about grass than any human being I
  think anywhere in the world”, the president told the officers. “And we are
  going to be re-grassing all of your parks, all brand-new new sprinkler
  systems, the best that you can buy. Just like Augusta. No dead- it’ll look
  like Augusta. It will look like, more importantly, Trump national golf club,
  that’s even better”, he added, comparing his own golf course to the one in
  Augusta, Georgia where The Masters is held each spring. “We’re going to have
  all brand-new, beautiful grass. You know, like everything else, grass has a
  life. Do you know that? Grass has a life. You know, we have a life, and grass
  as a life. And the grass here died about 40 years ago”, the president said. He
  added that he had brought the officers “great hamburgers cooked by the White
  House” with him, as well as pizzas from a local chain, Wiseguy Pizza. “I’ll
  eat with you and we’re going to have a little fun, we’re going to celebrate,
  then we’re going to get back to work and we’re going to take care of these
  criminals”. Donald Trump’s motorcade just arrived at the United States Park
  police headquarters in Anacostia, in south-east Washington DC. He was handed a
  mic and boasted to assembled officers that his crackdown on crime in the
  capital has been a success and went on to repeat many of his familiar talking
  points, including the boast that his trip to Saudi Arabia was successful at
  bringing in investments and that he is building a ballroom at the White House.
  Her also claimed that his federal takeover of Washington DC had encouraged
  people to go out to dinner again. In fact, restaurant owners have reported a
  sharp drop in reservations during the period. Donald Trump’s motorcade has
  just left the White House, with the president expected to join an evening
  patrol of Washington DC’s streets by national guard troops and police officers
  he placed under federal control to fight a crime wave that statistics suggest
  is imaginary. The president was joined by his attorney general, Pam Bondi, his
  domestic policy adviser, Stephen Miller, and his chief of staff, Susie Wiles.
  Trump referred to the made-for-TV photo op as a “secret” in a radio interview
  earlier on Thursday, but the White House has invited journalists along and set
  up a YouTube live stream to allow the public to follow his performance in real
  time. The staged event follows a similar outing on Wednesday by three top
  administration officials to visit national guard troops keeping the Shake
  Shack at Union Station safe. The administration’s commitment to producing
  content on a daily basis seems to echo the satirical praise Stephen Colbert
  lavished on George W Bush at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner in 2006
  when he said: I stand by this man. I stand by this man because he stands for
  things. Not only for things, he has stood on things. Things like aircraft
  carriers and rubble and recently flooded city squares. And that sends a strong
  message, that no matter what happens to America, she will always rebound with
  the most powerfully staged photo ops in the world. A federal judge ruled on
  Thursday that Donald Trump’s former lawyer, Alina Habba, has been unlawfully
  serving as the the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey. In his order
  disqualifying Habba from prosecuting three defendants who challenged her
  appointment, chief US district judge Matthew Brann wrote: The Executive branch
  has perpetuated Alina Habba’s appointment to act as the United States Attorney
  for the District of New Jersey through a novel series of legal and personnel
  moves. Along the way, it has disagreed with the Judges of the United States
  District Court for the District of New Jersey and criminal defendants in that
  District about who should or may lead the office. Faced with the question of
  whether Ms. Habba is lawfully performing the functions and duties of the
  office of the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey, I
  conclude that she is not. The judge found that Habba’s term as the interim US
  attorney ended in July, and the Trump administration’s maneuvers to keep her
  in the role without getting confirmation from the US Senate did not follow
  procedures required by federal law. Brann said he’s putting his order on hold
  pending an appeal. Habba, the daughter of Iraqi immigrants who unsuccessfully
  defended Trump in his New York fraud trial, also served as a frequent campaign
  surrogate for him in 2024. After being appointed to the interim role in March,
  she said the state could “turn red”, a rare, overt political expression from a
  prosecutor, and said she planned to investigate the state’s Democratic
  governor and attorney general. She then brought a trespassing charge, which
  was eventually dropped, against Newark’s mayor, Ras Baraka, stemming from a
  confrontation with federal agents during his visit to an immigration detention
  center. Habba later charged a Democratic congresswoman, LaMonica McIver, with
  assault for resisting the detention of the mayor in the same incident, a rare
  federal criminal case against a sitting member of Congress other than for
  corruption. She denies the charges and has pleaded not guilty. In late July
  her four-month temporary appointment was coming to a close and it became clear
  that she would not get support from home state senators Cory Booker and Andy
  Kim, both Democrats, meaning her chances of Senate approval were nil. Trump
  then withdrew her nomination and federal judges in New Jersey exercised their
  power under the law to replace Habba with a career prosecutor when Habba’s
  temporary appointment lapsed. The attorney general, Pam Bondi, retaliated by
  firing that prosecutor and moved to re-install Habba as acting US attorney.
  The California state assembly just advanced a constitutional amendment to
  temporarily suspend the state’s congressional boundaries, drawn by a
  voter-approved independent commission, and replace them with a map that
  creates five new Democratic House seats. It’s now heading to the Senate where
  it’s sure to pass. It’s the first of three bills that make up redistricting
  plan – spearheaded by California governor Gavin Newsom. A reminder that this
  is a response to Texas Republicans lawmakers passing a gerrymandered map that
  nets five new GOP-house seats in 2026. We can expect that to receive Senate
  approval later today, before heading to governor Greg Abbott’s desk. A New
  York state appeals court has thrown out a half-billion-dollar penalty that
  Donald Trump had been ordered to pay after a judge found the president
  fraudulently overstated the value of his properties and other assets to
  bolster his family business. And despite the president falsely claiming the
  ruling to be a “total victory”, the five-judge panel was deeply divided.
  Ultimately they lower court’s fraud verdict stand, which will pave the way for
  New York attorney general Letitia James to appeal the decision to the state’s
  highest court. The Trump administration is ratcheting up pressure on the
  Federal Reserve to remove governor Lisa Cook, after the economist declared she
  had “no intention of being bullied” into stepping down. The justice department
  plans to investigate Cook, with a top official informing Fed chair Jerome
  Powell of the probe and encouraging him to remove her from the board,
  according to a report by Bloomberg. When it comes to DC, the president said
  that he will join federal law enforcement and National Guard troops today in
  the nation’s capital. In a radio interview he confirmed his plans to patrol,
  but didn’t provide any more details on the length or specific location. As a
  reminder, the California plan is designed to flip as many as five
  Republican-held seats in California – the exact number of additional GOP seats
  Trump has said he is “entitled to” in Texas. “This is a new Democratic party,
  this is a new day, this is new energy out there all across this country,”
  Newsom said on a call with reporters on Wednesday. “And we’re going to fight
  fire with fire.” The redistricting tit-for-tat is an extraordinary deviation
  from the norm. Traditionally, states redraw congressional maps once a decade
  based on census data, with both the Texas and California maps originally
  intended to last through 2030. Prior to Thursday’s vote, California
  Republicans pleaded with their Democratic colleagues to oppose what they
  derisively called a “Gavinmander”. “The problem when you fight fire with fire
  is you burn it all down,” James Gallagher, the state assembly Republican
  leader, said at a news conference. The California assembly on Thursday
  approved the first in a series of three bills designed to redraw congressional
  boundaries and create five potential new Democratic US House seats. The effort
  in California is an answer to the Republican redistricting push in Texas,
  sought by Donald Trump and aimed at tilting the map in his party’s favor
  before next year’s midterm elections. The California assembly passed the
  measure in a 57-to-20 vote, sending it next to the state senate. Democrats
  hope to pass all three related bills by early afternoon. The state’s
  Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, who has led the redistricting push, intends
  to sign the bill as soon as it arrives on his desk. “We will not let our
  political system be hijacked by authoritarianism. And today, we give every
  Californian the power to say no,” said the Democratic assembly speaker Robert
  Rivas, in floor remarks before the vote. “To say no to Donald Trump’s power
  grab and yes to our people, to our state and to our democracy.” The California
  state assembly advanced the first in a series of three bills to temporarily
  suspend the state’s congressional boundaries, drawn by a voter-approved
  independent commission, and replace them with a map that creates five new
  Democratic seats. The lower house, which has a Democratic supermajority,
  approved the measure 57-20 along party lines. It now awaits a vote in the
  Senate where it’s likely to pass, and then will be put before voters in a
  special election on 4 November. California’s aim – spearheaded by governor
  Gavin Newsom – is to offset Texas’s gains, after Republican lawmakers passed a
  gerrymandered map that nets five new GOP-house seats in 2026. An effort that
  came at Donald Trump’s behest, and has now escalated into a nationwide
  redistricting battle. JD Vance took the stage in Peachtree City, talking about
  tax cuts and tariffs. “If you’re building it here, if you’re making it here
  ... we’re going to give you a big fat tax cut and that’s a good thing,” the
  vice president said. “But if you do it overseas and do it with a foreign then
  you’re going to pay a big fat tariff before you bring that back to the United
  States of America.” Workers will see a take home pay increase of $10,000 over
  a period of years because of the “Big Beautiful Bill,” Vance argued, claiming
  that it created the “biggest tax cut for working families in history.”
  President Donald Trump promised that the “only people who are going to lose
  access to health care are illegal aliens who shouldn’t be in this country to
  begin with,” Vance said. “I happen to believe that Medicaid belongs to working
  people.” The Trump administration is ratcheting up pressure on the Federal
  Reserve to remove governor Lisa Cook, after the economist declared she had “no
  intention of being bullied” into stepping down. Cook, who was appointed to the
  US central bank’s powerful board of governors by Joe Biden, has been accused
  by Donald Trump’s officials of committing mortgage fraud. The allegations are
  unconfirmed. The US president has waged an extraordinary war on the Fed’s
  independence, breaking with precedent to demand interest rate cuts and urge
  its chair, Jerome Powell, to resign. Trump promptly called on Cook to quit on
  Wednesday. The Department of Justice is reported to have indicated it is
  investigating the allegations, with a top Trump official telling Powell the
  case “requires further examination” – and calling on him to remove Cook from
  the Fed’s board. “At this time, I encourage you to remove Ms Cook from your
  Board,” Ed Martin, the official, wrote in a letter, according to Bloomberg
  News. “Do it today before it is too late! After all, no American thinks it is
  appropriate that she serve during this time with a cloud hanging over her.”
  Despite Martin’s demand, the Fed chair has no authority under the Federal
  Reserve Act to remove another member of the board of governors. On Wednesday,
  the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump had discussed how to fire Cook for
  cause, citing an unnamed administration official. As the president prepares to
  join federal law enforcement and National Guard troops for an evening patrol
  today, Maryland governor Wes Moore has invited Donald Trump to join the
  Baltimore mayor and local law enforcement for “a public safety walk” next
  month. “While we are not done delivering results for the people in our
  neighborhoods, I am deeply encouraged by our progress,” Moore wrote in a
  letter to the president. “We are currently on track to have the lowest number
  of homicides in Baltimore City since we began officially keeping crime
  statistics.” Trump has routinely criticised the Democratic governor’s handling
  of crime in Baltimore, despite a decrease in violent crime. Homicides in the
  city, for example, dropped by 23% according to local police data. My
  colleague, George Chidi, is in Peachtree City, Georgia and flags that vice
  president JD Vance has taken the stage. Donald Trump said that he will join
  federal law enforcement and National Guard troops in Washington DC on
  Thursday. In an interview on the Todd Starnes Show, the president confirmed
  his plan to join patrol efforts: I’m going out tonight, I’m going to keep it a
  secret. You’re the only one that knows. You and your lots of listeners…I’m
  going to be going out tonight I think with the police and with the military of
  course. He didn’t provide any more details on the length of the patrol, or
  specific locations where he’d join the police and National Guard. New York
  attorney general Letitia James announced that her office will appeal today’s
  decision to throw out the nearly half-billion-dollar penalty in the state’s
  civil fraud case against Donald Trump. James wrote: It should not be lost to
  history: yet another court has ruled that the president violated the law, and
  our case has merit. We will seek appeal to the Court of Appeals and continue
  to protect the rights and interests of New Yorkers.” The court’s
  deeply-divided opinion ultimately let the lower court’s fraud verdict stand –
  providing James the ability to appeal today’s ruling to New York’s highest
  court. Crowds have gathered for remarks this afternoon by vice president JD
  Vance at a factory in Peachtree City, Georgia. So have the state’s political
  hopefuls. Derek Dooley, former Tennessee coach turned US senate candidate, is
  mingling with the Republican faithful, as are primary contestants Republican
  congressmen Mike Collins and Buddy Carter of Georgia. Agriculture commissioner
  Tyler Harper and GOP representative Rich McCormick are also working the crowd.
  Vance is expected to highlight the budget and tax cuts at ALTA Refrigeration
  Inc., a family-owned industrial refrigeration firm. Business is robust, said
  Zane Piper, operations manager for the firm. ATLA makes refrigerators for
  supermarkets and other businesses. Almost all of its clients are domestic, and
  tariffs have had a limited effect on its material sourcing so far. “We have
  not seen a dramatic increase in price yet, but we are seeing suppliers of our
  issue special assessments.” Florida’s Republican governor Ron DeSantis sent a
  work crew in the dead of night to paint over a rainbow crosswalk outside an
  Orlando nightclub where 49 mostly LGBTQ+ victims lost their lives in a 2016
  mass shooting, outraged Democrats said Thursday. The move, branded a “cruel
  political act” by Orlando’s mayor Buddy Collins, reported by WESH News,
  followed a directive from the Trump administration in July to remove what it
  saw as political banners on US roadways. “Taxpayers expect their dollars to
  fund safe streets, not rainbow crosswalks,” transportation secretary Sean
  Duffy said in a 1 July tweet giving states 60 days to comply. DeSantis, who
  has pursued a vigorous anti-LGBTQ+ agenda in his six and a half years as
  governor, moved to eradicate the memorial outside the former Pulse nightclub
  “without any supporting safety data or discussion,” Dyer said in a statement
  Thursday. Democratic state senator Carlos Guillermo Smith, who is openly gay,
  said in a post to TikTok that DeSantis had “vandalized” his city: “This
  rainbow crosswalk was placed here by our community with approval from the
  state not only to remember those 49 mostly LGBTQ people of color who were
  murdered here at this site, but also it was intended to keep pedestrians safe,
  so many visitors who have come to pay their respects to those who were taken,”
  he said. The state department has fired a press officer responsible for
  drafting Trump administration talking points about policy toward Israel and
  Gaza after complaints from the US embassy in Jerusalem, the Associated Press
  reports. Officials said Shahed Ghoreishi, a contractor working for the Bureau
  of Near East Affairs, was terminated over the weekend following two incidents
  last week in which his loyalty to Trump administration policies was called
  into question. Ghoreishi was also targeted yesterday following his dismissal
  by far-right activist and Trump loyalist Laura Loomer, who accused him of not
  being fully supportive of the administration’s policies in the Middle East.
  According to Ghoreishi and two current US officials, Ghoreishi drew the ire of
  a senior official at the embassy in Jerusalem and then top aides to secretary
  of state Marco Rubio for drafting a response to a query from AP last week. The
  question related to discussions between Israel and South Sudan about the
  possible relocation of Palestinian people from Gaza to South Sudan. The draft
  response included a line that said the US does not support the forced
  relocation of Gazans, something that Donald Trump and his special envoy Steve
  Witkoff have said repeatedly. However, according to Ghoreishi and the
  officials, that line was rejected by the embassy in Jerusalem, leading to
  questions about policy back in Washington. Ghoreishi also said he questioned a
  statement from the embassy that referred to the (occupied) West Bank as “Judea
  and Samaria”, the biblical term for the Palestinian territory that some
  far-right Israeli officials prefer. Mike Huckabee, US ambassador to Israel,
  also has repeatedly backed referring to the West Bank by Judea and Samaria.
  Donald Trump has hailed an appeals court’s decision to throw out the nearly
  half-billion-dollar judgment against him in his New York civil fraud case as a
  “total victory” and called for the judge who imposed the fine to be
  “admonished for abuse”. In a lengthy post on Truth Social, the president
  called the case a “political witch hunt” and claimed “everything I did was
  absolutely CORRECT and, even, PERFECT”. Per my earlier post on this, it was
  far from a “total victory” for the president. The appeals court was
  splintered, with two judges finding that Trump was properly held liable, and
  the case “vindicated a public interest”, but found that the penalty was an
  excessive fine that violated the US constitution. Two other judges also found
  there was authority to sue, but a new trial was necessary because the trial
  judge should not have held Trump liable for fraud at the outset. Only the
  fifth judge said the case against Trump should have been dismissed. The
  justice department plans to investigate Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook,
  with a top official informing Fed chair Jerome Powell of the probe and
  encouraging him to remove her from the board, Bloomberg News is reporting. A
  letter to Powell from Ed Martin, a DOJ official who has led similar
  investigations into senator Adam Schiff of California and New York attorney
  general Letitia James, said Cook’s case “requires further examination,”
  according to Bloomberg’s report. “At this time, I encourage you to remove Ms.
  Cook from your Board,” Martin wrote. “Do it today before it is too late! After
  all, no American thinks it is appropriate that she serve during this time with
  a cloud hanging over her.” Asked about the report, a Fed spokesperson referred
  Reuters to Cook’s statement yesterday, when she said she had no intention of
  resigning after Donald Trump called for her to step down on the basis of
  allegations made by a member of his administration about mortgages she holds
  in Michigan and Georgia, intensifying Trump’s effort to gain influence over
  the US central bank. The Federal Reserve Act provides no authority for a Fed
  chair to remove another member of the board of governors. The president has
  repeatedly broken with precedent in recent months to demand the Fed cut rates
  and urge Powell to quit after disregarding such calls. Cook, whose current
  term on the Fed’s board extends until 2038, previously served on the council
  of economic advisers under Barack Obama. When she took office in May 2022, she
  became the first black woman to sit on the central bank’s board. A New York
  state appeals court has thrown out an approximately half-billion-dollar
  penalty that Donald Trump had been ordered to pay after a judge found the
  president fraudulently overstated the value of his properties and other assets
  to bolster his family business. The decision by a five-judge panel of the
  appellate division in Manhattan represented a defeat for New York attorney
  general Letitia James, whose office brought the civil fraud lawsuit against
  Trump in 2022. James’ case had been among Trump’s biggest legal losses in a
  slew of lawsuits against him in recent years. Lawyers for Trump did not
  immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. James’ office did not
  immediately respond to similar requests. The appeals court was splintered. Two
  judges found Trump was properly held liable, and James “vindicated a public
  interest” by pursuing her fraud case, but the penalty was an excessive fine
  that violated the US constitution. Two other judges also found James had
  authority to sue, but a new trial was necessary because the trial judge should
  not have held Trump liable for fraud at the outset. The fifth judge said the
  case against Trump should have been dismissed. Trump was appealing a judgment
  entered by Justice Arthur Engoron in a state court in Manhattan, following a
  three-month nonjury trial. Engoron found Trump had inflated his wealth over
  several years before first becoming president in 2017, to dupe lenders and
  insurers into providing better terms to the Trump Organization. Trump has
  denied wrongdoing. His lawyers argued that the penalty was too high and that
  James had overreached. In February 2024, the judge ordered Trump to pay
  $454.2m in penalties plus interest, which has continued to accrue. Trump was
  personally liable for nearly 98% of the judgment, with his eldest sons, Donald
  Trump Jr and Eric Trump, and former Trump Organization chief financial officer
  Allen Weisselberg responsible for the remainder. Referring to Trump and other
  Trump Organization figures, Engoron said their “complete lack of contrition
  and remorse borders on pathological”. Engoron also banned Trump and the Trump
  Organization from applying for loans from banks registered in the state for
  three years, and effectively barred Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump from
  running the business for two years. The appeals court put these restrictions
  on hold during the appeals process, while letting a court-appointed monitor
  for the Trump Organization continue her work. Members of the press travelling
  with vice president report that Vance, the second lady and EPA administrator
  Zeldin have landed in Georgia. The vice president is heading to a Republican
  National Committee meeting first that will not be open to the press. Donald
  Trump again called for the release of a former election clerk in Colorado who
  was convicted for her role in breaching election data in a quest to find
  fraud, threatening he would take “harsh measures” if she wasn’t let out of
  prison. “FREE TINA PETERS, a brave and innocent Patriot who has been tortured
  by Crooked Colorado politicians, including the big Mail-In Ballot supporting
  the governor of the State,” Trump said on Truth Social. “Let Tina Peters out
  of jail, RIGHT NOW. She did nothing wrong, except catching the Democrats cheat
  in the Election. She is an old woman, and very sick. If she is not released, I
  am going to take harsh measures!!!” Peters did not find evidence of Democrats
  cheating in the election. She was charged for allowing access to county voting
  equipment by an outside election activist, who was given security credentials
  under a different name. Materials and passwords were then published online on
  Telegram and on the rightwing outlet the Gateway Pundit. Peters was found
  guilty by a jury in Mesa county in 2024 of seven counts related to misconduct,
  conspiracy and impersonation, four of which were felony charges. She was
  sentenced later that year to nine years in prison. Her attorneys had argued
  for probation instead of prison time. Also, earlier today, the president took
  to Truth Social to say that Ukraine’s strategy has been purely focused on
  defence. “It is very hard, if not impossible, to win a war without attacking
  an invaders country,” Trump wrote. “It’s like a great team in sports that has
  a fantastic defense, but is not allowed to play offense. There is no chance of
  winning! It is like that with Ukraine and Russia. Crooked and grossly
  incompetent Joe Biden would not let Ukraine FIGHT BACK, only DEFEND.” This
  comes after the president’s meeting on Monday with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and
  several European leaders, where Trump said that the America would help to
  coordinate security guarantees for Ukraine. The White House later confirmed
  that no US troops would be on the ground in Ukraine, but hinted that some form
  of air support could be possible. A reminder that my colleague, Jakub Krupa,
  is following the latest developments in Europe. Donald Trump intends to leave
  Russia and Ukraine to organize a meeting between their leaders without
  directly playing a role for now, according to administration officials
  familiar with the situation, taking a step back from the negotiations to end
  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The next stage in Trump’s eyes to end the war in
  Ukraine remains a bilateral meeting between Vladimir Putin, the Russian
  president, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, the officials
  said. Trump has told advisers in recent days that he intends to host a
  trilateral meeting with the two leaders only after they have met first,
  although whether that initial conference takes place remains unclear and Trump
  does not intend to become involved in that effort. In some more news from
  Texas, GOP congressman Chip Roy has announced a bid for attorney general,
  ahead of next year’s first open contest for the job in more than a decade.
  “I’ll always defend the conservative values our Texas families cherish,” Roy
  said in his campaign video. “Today we draw a line in the sand, Texas’ next
  attorney general must have a proven record of fighting to preserve, protect
  and defend our legacy.” There are already several Republican candidates set to
  battle it out in a primary to succeed outgoing attorney general Ken Paxton –
  who has launched a challenge to unseat senator John Cornyn. Roy, who served as
  Paxton’s assistant attorney general before joining Congress, where he’s become
  an outspoken member of the conservative wing, and serves in the Freedom
  Caucus. Roy has also clashed with Donald Trump, most recently when he opposed
  the president’s proposal to raise the debt ceiling last year. In retaliation,
  Trump called for Roy to be primaried. An update from the press pool travelling
  with vice president JD Vance today to Peachtree, Georgia. Vance will headline
  a messaging event at 2pm for the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which is now
  being rebranded by the administration as ‘working families tax cuts’. The vice
  president is also travelling with second lady Usha Vance, and Lee Zeldin,
  administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Donald Trump has made
  several unusual moves to elongate the era of coal, such as giving the industry
  exemptions from pollution rules. But the gambit to keep one Michigan
  coal-fired power station running has been extraordinary – by forcing it to
  remain open even against the wishes of its operator. The hulking JH Campbell
  power plant, which since 1962 has sat a few hundred yards from the sand dunes
  at the edge of Lake Michigan, was just eight days away from a long-planned
  closure in May when Trump’s Department of Energy issued an emergency order
  that it remain open for a further 90 days. On Wednesday, the administration
  intervened again to extend this order even further, prolonging the lifetime of
  the coal plant another 90 days, meaning it will keep running until November –
  six months after it was due to close. The move, taken under emergency powers
  more normally used during wartime or in the wake of disaster, has stunned
  local residents and the plant’s operator, Consumers Energy. “My family had a
  countdown for it closing, we couldn’t wait,” said Mark Oppenhuizen, who has
  lived in the shadow of the plant for 30 years and suspects its pollution
  worsened his wife’s lung disease. “I was flabbergasted when the administration
  said they had stopped it shutting down,” he said. “Why are they inserting
  themselves into a decision a company has made? Just because politically you
  don’t like it? It’s all so dumb.” Attorney general Pam Bondi said that there
  have been 630 arrests since the beginning of the federal law enforcement surge
  in the nation’s capital earlier this month. In her post on X, she added that
  agents have also seized 86 illegal guns in this period. When Donald Trump’s
  administration escalated immigration raids in Los Angeles earlier this summer,
  protest organizers responded with actions staged in an unusual setting: the
  hotels where immigration officers were staying. Protests took place at several
  southern California hotels where Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and
  Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents had been spotted. Some activists
  launched “No sleep for Ice” rallies, with chants and music blaring through the
  night, in hopes of pressuring the hotels to kick agents out. Now, public
  records shared with the Guardian show that the protests indeed sent federal
  agencies scrambling to find hotels for their officers in LA where they would
  not be “harassed”. A 16 June email from the US marines shows that military
  officials made a list of “LA Hotels to Avoid”. The information came from
  multiple law enforcement agencies who were tracking the community backlash to
  Ice and the border patrol, the marines said. The list was written by Army
  North, the domestic defense command deployed on the ground during the
  protests, and reviewed by the navy’s south-west division. And when it comes to
  California’s redistricting efforts, a new poll from Politico and UC Berkeley
  Citrin Center found that while 70% of Democrats think that partisan
  gerrymandering is “never acceptable”, 63% do support the plan to counter
  Texas’ new GOP-drawn map by responding with a redistricting plan that offsets
  Republican gains in the US House. More broadly, 42% of all respondents to the
  poll said that voters are most harmed by partisan redistricting. On Wednesday
  night, the California state supreme court declined an emergency request by
  Republican lawmakers, which sought to block the Democratic plan to temporarily
  get rid of the maps drawn by a voter-approved independent redistricting
  commission. Now the California legislature will vote today on three bills that
  would allow for a November special election to redraw the state’s
  congressional boundaries – creating five new Democratic House seats in the
  process. The aim is to offset Texas’s gains, after Republican lawmakers passed
  a gerrymandered map that nets five new GOP-house seats in 2026. An effort that
  came at Donald Trump’s behest, and has now escalated into a nationwide
  redistricting battle. The new Texas map now heads to the state senate today
  for approval – where it is sure to advance – before being signed into law by
  the governor, Greg Abbott. Meanwhile, Democrats have a supermajority at the
  Sacramento capitol, and will probably pass the new maps. It’s important to
  note that California’s proposed legislation has language that stipulates it
  only goes into effect if Texas’s new GOP-drawn map is approved. My colleague
  Lauren Gambino has been covering the latest and notes that California’s
  redistricting counter-effort, spearheaded by Governor Gavin Newsom, has
  “caused angst among some Democrats and independents who have fought for years
  to combat gerrymandering”. The president doesn’t have any public events today,
  according to his official schedule. He’ll receive an intelligence briefing at
  11am ET, and then will sign executive orders in the Oval Office at 3pm ET. For
  the moment that’s closed to the press, but we’ll update you if that changes.
  The California state legislature was poised on Thursday to vote on a plan to
  redraw its congressional boundaries and create five potential new Democratic
  House seats – an answer to the Republican redistricting push in Texas, sought
  by Donald Trump, aimed at tilting the map in his party’s favor ahead of next
  year’s midterm elections. The nation’s two most populous – and ideologically
  opposed – states were racing on parallel tracks toward consequential
  redistricting votes, potentially within hours of each other. As Democrats in
  Sacramento worked to advance a legislative package that would put their
  “election rigging response act” before voters in a special election this fall,
  Republicans in Austin were nearing a final vote on their own gerrymandering
  pursuit. Approval by the Texas senate, which is expected as early as Thursday,
  would conclude a dramatic showdown with the state’s outnumbered Democratic
  lawmakers whose two-week boycott captured national attention and set in motion
  a coast-to-coast redistricting battle. The California plan, led by the state’s
  Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, is designed to flip as many as five
  Republican-held seats in California – the exact number of additional GOP seats
  Trump has said he is “entitled to” in Texas. “This is a new Democratic party,
  this is a new day, this is new energy out there all across this country,”
  Newsom said on a call with reporters on Wednesday. “And we’re going to fight
  fire with fire.” The redistricting tit-for-tat is an extraordinary deviation
  from the norm. Traditionally, states redraw congressional maps once a decade
  based on census data, with both the Texas and California maps originally
  intended to last through 2030. The California state legislature, where
  Democrats have a supermajority, is expected to easily approve new
  congressional maps despite sharp Republican objections. Newsom’s signature
  would send the measure to the ballot in a special election this November. The
  California changes would only take effect in response to a gerrymander by a
  Republican state – a condition that would be met when the Texas legislatures
  sends the maps to the state’s governor, Greg Abbott, for his promised
  signature. The government lost its bid to unseal grand jury transcripts in the
  sex-trafficking case against Jeffrey Epstein. Richard Berman, a federal judge
  in New York, said the transcripts pale in comparison to the documents the
  government already has on Epstein and that disclosing them could harm victims.
  The ruling comes after a different judge ruled against disclosure in a
  separate effort to unseal transcripts in a case against Ghislaine Maxwell,
  Epstein’s former girlfriend. Maxwell is in prison on a 20-year sentence after
  she was convicted of sex trafficking for aiding Epstein’s sexual abuses.
  Epstein, who died by suicide in custody in 2019 while awaiting trial, sexually
  abused hundreds of girls and women and operated a sex-trafficking ring over
  decades. He was connected with some of the world’s most powerful people.
  Documents related to his conduct could reveal his connections, how he made his
  money and how he was able to evade justice for so long. The government was
  seeking to unseal 70 pages of grand jury transcripts, exhibits including a
  PowerPoint presentation, four pages of call logs and letters from victims and
  their attorneys, from proceedings that took place in 2019. The motions to
  unseal the documents came as the Trump administration is under intense
  scrutiny from its supporters over failure to release Epstein files in its
  possession. Trump had previously promised to release the files, a longtime
  goal for the Maga movement, and now has sought to tamp down fury among his
  Maga acolytes over the files. Trump and Epstein were once friends, and his
  entanglements have come under renewed examination. JD Vance was booed and
  heckled with chants of “Free DC!” during a photo op with national guard troops
  at Union Station in Washington on Wednesday afternoon. Handing out burgers to
  troops deployed last week by Donald Trump, at the station’s Shake Shack
  alongside the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, and White House deputy chief of
  staff, Stephen Miller, Vance told soldiers “we appreciate everything you’re
  doing” and asserted: “We brought some law and order back.” Meanwhile, a crowd
  of demonstrators protested outside. The crowd shouted slogans such as “Free
  DC!” and “From DC to Palestine, occupation is a crime.” Some also shouted
  expletives as the three men walked into Union Station and gathered at the
  restaurant, and continued as they tried to speak to reporters and eventually
  left. Asked why the troops were at the station instead of parts of the city
  where crime rates were statistically higher, Vance claimed it was being
  overrun with “vagrants, drug addicts, the chronically homeless and the
  mentally ill” and that visitors didn’t feel safe. “This should be a monument
  to American greatness,” he said, later adding: “We do not have to live like
  this.” Addressing the protests, Vance said: It’s kind of bizarre that we have
  a bunch of old, primarily white people who are out there protesting the
  policies that keep people safe when they’ve never felt danger in their entire
  lives. Donald Trump has called on a Federal Reserve governor to immediately
  resign, renewing his extraordinary attack on the central bank’s independence
  as officials mull next steps on interest rates. A close Trump ally accused
  Lisa Cook, an appointee of Joe Biden, of “potentially committing mortgage
  fraud” and urged the US Department of Justice to investigate. The claims have
  not been confirmed, and this evening Cook said she had “no intention of being
  bullied” into stepping down. The US president has repeatedly broken with
  precedent in recent months to demand the Fed cut rates and urge its chair,
  Jerome Powell, to quit after disregarding such calls. On Wednesday, Trump
  leaped on the allegations about Cook. The governor “must resign, now!!!”, he
  wrote on Truth Social, his social media platform. Cook, whose current term on
  the Fed’s board extends until 2038, previously served on the council of
  economic advisers under Barack Obama. When she took office in May 2022, she
  became the first Black woman to sit on the central bank’s board. President
  Donald Trump said on Thursday that any California school district that did not
  adhere to his administration’s transgender policies would not be funded. On
  Truth Social, he wrote: Any California school district that doesn’t adhere to
  our Transgender policies, will not be funded. Thank you for your attention to
  this matter! Amid the Donald Trump administration’s heavy-handed review of
  Smithsonian museums, the Guardian has seen a document compiled by the White
  House that details examples of how the widely visited cultural institutions
  have overly negative portrayals of US history. The document, based on public
  submissions shared with the administration, points to what it says are
  problematic exhibits at seven different museums, including a Benjamin Franklin
  exhibit that links his scientific achievements to his ownership of enslaved
  people and a film about George Floyd’s murder that it says mischaracterizes
  the police. “President Trump will explore all options and avenues to get the
  Woke out of the Smithsonian and hold them accountable,” a White House official
  said. “Until we get info from the Smithsonian in response to our letter, we
  can’t verify the numbers of artifacts that have been removed because the
  Smithsonian has removed them on their own.” Trump announced the initiative on
  Truth Social earlier this week, writing: “The Smithsonian is OUT OF CONTROL,
  where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery
  was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been.” The seven museums that
  have so far been flagged for review include the National Museum of American
  History, National Museum of the American Latino, National Museum of Natural
  History, National Museum of African Art, National Portrait Gallery,
  Smithsonian American Art Museum and National Museum of Asian Art. Uganda has
  entered an agreement with the United States to take in nationals from third
  countries who may not get asylum in the US but are reluctant to return to
  their countries of origin, the foreign affairs ministry said on Thursday.
  President Donald Trump aims to deport millions of immigrants who entered the
  US illegally and his administration has sought to increase removals to third
  countries, including by sending convicted criminals to South Sudan and
  Eswatini, Reuters reported. “This is a temporary arrangement with conditions
  including that individuals with criminal records and unaccompanied minors will
  not be accepted,” Vincent Bagiire Waiswa, the ministry’s permanent secretary,
  said in a statement. Waiswa added that Uganda would prefer to receive people
  from African nationalities under the agreement. “The two parties are working
  out the detailed modalities on how the agreement shall be implemented,” he
  said. On Wednesday, another Ugandan foreign affairs official had denied a US
  media report that the East African country had agreed to take in people
  deported from the United States, saying it lacked the facilities to
  accommodate them. Barack Obama waded into states’ efforts at rare mid-decade
  redistricting efforts, saying he agreed with California governor Gavin
  Newsom’s plan to counter the new Texas congressional map by launching an
  effort to redraw his own state’s map and create more Democratic-friendly
  districts, calling it “a responsible approach”. “I believe that governor
  Newsom’s approach is a responsible approach. He said this is going to be
  responsible. We’re not going to try to completely maximize it,” Obama said at
  a Tuesday fundraiser on Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts. “We’re only going
  to do it if and when Texas and/or other Republican states begin to pull these
  maneuvers. Otherwise, this doesn’t go into effect.” Obama also called Newsom’s
  strategy “measured”, as it only temporarily grants the California legislature
  the ability to redraw maps mid-decade. While noting that “political
  gerrymandering” is not his “preference,” Obama said that, if Democrats “don’t
  respond effectively, then this White House and Republican-controlled state
  governments all across the country, they will not stop, because they do not
  appear to believe in this idea of an inclusive, expansive democracy”.
  According to organizers, the event raised $2m for the National Democratic
  Redistricting Committee and its affiliates, one of which has filed and
  supported litigation in several states over Republican-drawn districts. The
  former House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Eric Holder, who served as Obama’s
  attorney general and heads up the group, also appeared. Most Americans believe
  that efforts to redraw U.S. House of Representatives districts to maximize
  partisan gains, like those under way in Texas and California, are bad for
  democracy, a new Reuters/Ipsos poll found. More than half of respondents - 57%
  - said they feared that American democracy itself was in danger, a view held
  by eight in 10 Democrats and four in 10 in president Donald Trump’s Republican
  party. The six-day survey of 4,446 US adults, which closed on Monday, showed
  deep unease with the growing political divisions in Washington - where
  Republicans control both chambers of Congress - and state capitals. The poll
  found that 55% of respondents, including 71% of Democrats and 46% of
  Republicans, agreed that ongoing redistricting plans - such as those hatched
  by governors in Texas and California in a process known as gerrymandering -
  were “bad for democracy.” At Trump’s urging, Republican Texas governor Greg
  Abbott has called a special session of the state legislature to redraw the
  state’s congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, aiming to help
  Republicans defend their 219-212 US House majority. When Texas Republicans
  redrew their congressional map this month at the urging of Donald Trump, they
  faced a difficult task. They needed to find a way to pick up five seats that
  the president wanted ahead of the midterm elections next year without
  spreading their voters too thin and jeopardizing the 25 seats they already
  held. Here is a visual breakdown of the redrawn congressional maps… Hello and
  welcome to the US politics live blog. My name is Tom Ambrose and I will be
  bringing you all the latest news lines over the next few hours. We start with
  news that the Texas legislature’s lower chamber passed a contentious new
  electoral map on Wednesday that aims to help Donald Trump’s Republican party
  retain its razor-thin US House majority in the 2026 midterm elections, AFP
  reported. The vote had been delayed by two weeks after Democratic legislators
  fled the southern state to halt the redistricting drive, which carves out five
  new Republican-friendly districts. More than 50 Democrats walked out, stalling
  legislative business and generating national headlines as they sought to draw
  attention to the rare mid-decade redistricting push. The Democratic lawmakers
  returned this week, but not before their protest had set off a national
  map-drawing war, with Trump pressuring his party’s state-level officials to do
  everything they can to protect the majority in the US House of
  Representatives. The stakes are sky-high for Trump, who will be bogged down in
  investigations into almost every aspect of his second term if Democrats manage
  to flip the handful of districts nationwide needed to win back the House in
  next year’s midterm elections. Trump hailed the “Big WIN for the Great State
  of Texas“ on Wednesday night. “Everything Passed, on our way to FIVE more
  Congressional seats and saving your Rights, your Freedoms, and your Country,
  itself,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform. “Texas never lets us down.”
  The president also suggested Florida, Indiana and other states were looking
  into pursuing similar redistricting to benefit Republicans while once again
  calling to “STOP MAIL-IN VOTING.” Trump - who has long railed against postal
  ballots, even though they have benefited his party and he has voted by mail -
  said in a separate post: END MAIL-IN VOTING, AND GO TO PAPER BALLOTS. 100
  additional seats will go to Republicans!!!” In other developments: The
  vice-president, JD Vance, the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, and the White
  House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, staged a photo op with National
  Guard troops at Union Station in the nation’s capital. They were roundly booed
  and jeered on their way in and out of the station. A federal judge denied the
  justice department’s bid to unseal records from the grand jury that indicted
  Jeffrey Epstein in 2019. US district judge Richard Berman said the small
  number of documents seen by the court pale in comparison with the 100,000
  records the government already has on Epstein and that disclosing them could
  harm victims. Lisa Cook, the Federal Reserve governor Trump has called on to
  immediately resign over an accusation that she falsely declared a property she
  obtained a mortgage on was her primary residence, responded on Wednesday that
  she has “no intention of being bullied to step down”. Trump has bought at
  least $100m of bonds since he returned to office in January, according to a
  CNBC analysis of new filings from the president with the US Office of
  Government Ethics. A young American citizen who was violently arrested by
  federal immigration officers in Los Angeles county in June, after he objected
  to the arrest of an older man in a Walmart parking lot, was charged with
  conspiracy to impede a federal officer.

This concludes our running chronicle of the second Trump administration for Thursday, but we will be back on Friday morning. In the meantime, here are some of the latest developments: California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, signed a law to hold a special election in November in which voters will be asked to approve a new congressional map, tilted in favor of Democrats, for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections, if Texas goes ahead with a plan to do the same for Republicans. Donald Trump ventured from the White House in his motorcade through the not all that mean streets of Washington DC to deliver pizza and hamburgers to law enforcement officers and National Guard troops, and regale them with his plans to upgrade the grass in the district to make it look more like one of his golf courses. “I know more about grass than any human being I think anywhere in the world”, the commander-in-chief told the officers. A federal judge ruled that Trump’s former lawyer and campaign surrogate, Alina Habba, has been unlawfully serving as the the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey. A New York state appeals court tossed out a half-billion-dollar penalty that Trump had been ordered to pay after a judge found the president fraudulently overstated the value of his properties and other assets to bolster his family business. Despite the president falsely claiming the ruling to be a “total victory”, the five-judge panel let the lower court’s fraud verdict stand, which paves the way for New York attorney general Letitia James to appeal the decision to the state’s highest court. The Trump administration ratcheted up pressure on the Federal Reserve to remove governor Lisa Cook, after the economist declared she had “no intention of being bullied” into stepping down. A federal judge on Thursday barred the DeSantis and Trump administrations from bringing new detainees to the detention facility called Alligator Alcatraz and ordered the state begin closing operations at the immigration detention site within 60 days. In her order, US district judge Kathleen Williams barred the state and federal governments from bringing new detainees to the detention center and stopped any expansion of the facility, including new lighting or any new buildings, including tents. As the Miami Herald reports, the temporary injunction comes in response to a lawsuit filed by environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe in which they argue that the state and federal governments cut corners when erecting the site in a matter of days. The environmental groups argue that the hasty construction of the facility violated the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies to consider alternatives, consult the public and assess the environmental impact of building projects. The White House has released a social media video highlighting the start of Donald Trump’s remarks to law enforcement officers and National Guard soldiers on Thursday, which begins with the president mocking his predecessor, Joe Biden, for once falling as he walked up a flight of stairs to Air Force One. The video, which was recorded by Margo Martin, a special assistant to the president and communications advisor, captures the beginning of Trump’s rambling 12-minute speech in which he essentially congratulated himself on successfully walking down a single step as he began his remarks. “You gotta be very careful; you don’t want to slip or fall like somebody else I know”, Trump said, to laughter from the officers. “We don’t want that to happen”. The video then cuts, to omit the part of the original recording in which Trump turned to Martin and said, “Where are we going Margo, over here?” The president then thanked the assembled officers, who are taking part in his federal takeover of policing in the district. “The numbers are down like we wouldn’t believe, but we believe it”, Trump added. The administration has repeatedly suggested without evidence that data gathered by the DC police, and released by the justice department, showing that violent crime was at a 30-year low when Trump returned to office in January, and had declined by a further 26% since then, had been manipulated to hide what Trump has called a terrifying crime wave. Video of Joe Biden falling, repeatedly, while boarding Air Force One in 2021, when he was 79, was widely seen and helped cement the idea that he was too old to be president. In June, the week Trump turned 79, video of him stumbling and nearly falling while climbing the stairs to Air Force One was also widely seen. The supreme court ruled by a 5-4 vote on Thursday that the Trump administration can cut $783m of research funding for health projects that promote diversity, equity and inclusion, what the government calls “gender ideology” and vaccine hesitancy, the supreme court decided on Thursday. The court lifted a judge’s order blocking cuts made by the National Institutes of Health to align with Donald Trump’s priorities. The court split 5-4 on the decision. The chief justice, John Roberts, was among those who wouldn’t have allowed the cuts, along with the court’s three Democratic appointees. The high court did keep the Trump administration’s anti-DEI directive blocked for future funding with a key vote from justice Amy Coney Barrett, however. The decision marks the latest supreme court victory for Trump and allows the administration to forge ahead with canceling hundreds of grants while a lawsuit brought by 16 Democratic state attorneys general and public-health advocacy groups continues. The plaintiffs said the decision is a “significant setback for public health”, but keeping the directive blocked means the administration can’t use it to cut more studies. The justice department, meanwhile, has said funding decisions should not be “subject to judicial second-guessing” and efforts to promote policies referred to as DEI can “conceal insidious racial discrimination”. The lawsuit addresses only part of the estimated $12bn of NIH research projects that have been cut. The plaintiffs unsuccessfully argued that defunding studies midway through halts research, ruins data already collected and ultimately harms the country’s potential for scientific breakthroughs by disrupting scientists’ work in the middle of their careers. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote a lengthy dissent in which she criticized both the outcome and her colleagues’ willingness to continue allowing the administration to use the court’s emergency appeals process. “This is Calvinball jurisprudence with a twist. Calvinball has only one rule: there are no fixed rules. We seem to have two: that one, and this administration always wins,” she wrote, referring to a fictional game in the comic strip Calvin and Hobbes in which rules are made up on the fly. Lloyd Doggett, a Democratic Texas congressperson, who has represented his hometown of Austin for over 50 years in the state legislature and Congress, announced on Thursday that he would not run for reelection if a new Republican-drawn map is used, which would pit him against fellow Democrat Greg Casar in the 2026 midterms. Doggett, who is 78, said that he had decided not to run against Casar, 36, who is less than half his age. Texas Republicans are pushing ahead with the rare mid-decade redistricting requested by Donald Trump. Part of the plan to create more Republican-leaning seats is to pack as many Democrats into a single Austin district as possible, rather than keeping the city’s two Democratic-majority districts. “With the approval of the crooked Trump maps imminent, the future of redistricting turns next to the courts,” Doggett said in his statement. “If this racially gerrymandered Trump map is rejected, as it should be, I will continue seeking reelection in Congressional District 37 to represent my neighbors in the only town I have ever called home. If the courts give Trump a victory in his scheme to maintain control of a compliant House, I will not seek reelection in the reconfigured CD37, even though it contains over 2/3rd of my current constituents.” Doggett also noted that he had hoped that Casar would try to hold on to his seat in a redrawn district around San Antonio, but had chosen to run for the Austin seat instead. “I had hoped that my commitment to reelection under any circumstances would encourage Congressman Casar to not surrender his winnable district to Trump”, Doggett said. “While his apparent decision is most unfortunate, I prefer to devote the coming months to fighting Trump tyranny and serving Austin rather than waging a struggle with fellow Democrats.” If the Trump-directed “extreme gerrymandering prevails”, Doggett added, “I wish Congressman Casar the best.” California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, signed legislation on Thursday that will ask the state’s voters to decide in November if they approve of redrawn congressional districts that tilt heavily in favor of Democrats, as a way of neutralizing a similarly partisan map in Texas. “They fired the first shot, Texas,” Newsom said before signing the bill, noting that California’s new map would only be used if Texas uses new maps tilted in favor of Republicans. “We wouldn’t be here had Texas not done what they just did; Donald Trump didn’t do what he just did. He went so far as to follow up and say that he didn’t just want those five seats, he said he’s, quote-unquote, entitled to those five seats. Just pause and reflect on that. Everything should have just stopped there. The president of the United States claiming he’s ‘entitled’ to five seats. That should put chills up your spine, every Republican, not just Democrat and independent, every American.” Newsom also said that California would be “the first state in US history to, in the most democratic way, to submit to the people of our state the ability to determine their own maps”. The map that could give California Democrats five more seats was drawn by Paul Mitchell, founder of Redistricting Partners, a nonpartisan local redistricting firm, who previously created maps for independent redistricting commissions across California. “All of us support independent redistricting, here in California and in every state in this union” Mike McGuire, another Democratic state leader and senate president pro tempore, said. “One thing that we do not support is unilateral disarmament, when the fairness of the 2026 election is being threatened.” California lawmakers have authorized a November special election to ask voters to redraw the state’s congressional boundaries and create five new potentially Democratic US House seats. The state legislature voted to advance the redistricting plan on Thursday after hours of debate. The state’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, who has led the redistricting push, is expected to sign the bill shortly. The effort in California is an answer to the Republican redistricting push in Texas, sought by Donald Trump, aimed at tilting the map in his party’s favor before next year’s midterm elections. The nation’s two most populous – and ideologically opposed – states were racing on parallel tracks toward consequential redistricting votes, potentially within hours of each other. As Democrats in Sacramento advanced a legislative package that would put their “election rigging response act” before voters in a special election this fall, Republicans in Austin were nearing a final vote on their own gerrymandering pursuit. The California legislature on Thursday approved a plan to hold a special election in November in which voters will be asked to approve new congressional districts, redrawn in favor of Democrats, as a means of nullifying a gerrymandered map on its way to final approval in Texas. The effort in California is an answer to the Republican redistricting push in Texas, sought by Donald Trump and aimed at tilting the map in his party’s favor before next year’s midterm elections. The nation’s two most populous – and ideologically opposed – states raced on parallel tracks to redistrict ahead of the 2026 midterms. So far, what was billed as a “ride-along” with law enforcement on the streets of Washington DC, has turned out to be mostly Donald Trump giving a short rally-style address to about 300 officers from the DC Metropolitan Police, the FBI, the National Guard, homeland security investigations, the DEA, ATF and US Marshals service. The president repeated his familiar attacks on renewable energy, telling the officers: “It’s it’s a very expensive form of energy, and we’re not doing the wind”. He also boasted about his legal victory on Thursday, when a New York appeals court threw out a multi-million dollar financial penalty against him after his conviction for fraud. Although the fraud conviction remains in place, Trump falsely implied that the judges had overturned his conviction. “We’re having a lot of victories. I had a victory today”, he said. “You know, they stole $550 million from me with a fake case, and it was overturned. They said this was a fake case. It’s a terrible thing, but it’s a nice victory, you know? I mean, it’s not bad, we all have, we all have our limits. But this was a terrible thing that it was a witch hunt”. He then invited several cabinet members and aides, including the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, and the interior secretary, Doug Burgum, to make remarks, which were focused on praising the president. Among Trump’s comments was a promise to clean up Washington DC, including its grass. “One of the things we are going to be redoing is your parks. I’m very good at grass ‘cause I have a lot of golf courses all over the place. I know more about grass than any human being I think anywhere in the world”, the president told the officers. “And we are going to be re-grassing all of your parks, all brand-new new sprinkler systems, the best that you can buy. Just like Augusta. No dead- it’ll look like Augusta. It will look like, more importantly, Trump national golf club, that’s even better”, he added, comparing his own golf course to the one in Augusta, Georgia where The Masters is held each spring. “We’re going to have all brand-new, beautiful grass. You know, like everything else, grass has a life. Do you know that? Grass has a life. You know, we have a life, and grass as a life. And the grass here died about 40 years ago”, the president said. He added that he had brought the officers “great hamburgers cooked by the White House” with him, as well as pizzas from a local chain, Wiseguy Pizza. “I’ll eat with you and we’re going to have a little fun, we’re going to celebrate, then we’re going to get back to work and we’re going to take care of these criminals”. Donald Trump’s motorcade just arrived at the United States Park police headquarters in Anacostia, in south-east Washington DC. He was handed a mic and boasted to assembled officers that his crackdown on crime in the capital has been a success and went on to repeat many of his familiar talking points, including the boast that his trip to Saudi Arabia was successful at bringing in investments and that he is building a ballroom at the White House. Her also claimed that his federal takeover of Washington DC had encouraged people to go out to dinner again. In fact, restaurant owners have reported a sharp drop in reservations during the period. Donald Trump’s motorcade has just left the White House, with the president expected to join an evening patrol of Washington DC’s streets by national guard troops and police officers he placed under federal control to fight a crime wave that statistics suggest is imaginary. The president was joined by his attorney general, Pam Bondi, his domestic policy adviser, Stephen Miller, and his chief of staff, Susie Wiles. Trump referred to the made-for-TV photo op as a “secret” in a radio interview earlier on Thursday, but the White House has invited journalists along and set up a YouTube live stream to allow the public to follow his performance in real time. The staged event follows a similar outing on Wednesday by three top administration officials to visit national guard troops keeping the Shake Shack at Union Station safe. The administration’s commitment to producing content on a daily basis seems to echo the satirical praise Stephen Colbert lavished on George W Bush at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner in 2006 when he said: I stand by this man. I stand by this man because he stands for things. Not only for things, he has stood on things. Things like aircraft carriers and rubble and recently flooded city squares. And that sends a strong message, that no matter what happens to America, she will always rebound with the most powerfully staged photo ops in the world. A federal judge ruled on Thursday that Donald Trump’s former lawyer, Alina Habba, has been unlawfully serving as the the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey. In his order disqualifying Habba from prosecuting three defendants who challenged her appointment, chief US district judge Matthew Brann wrote: The Executive branch has perpetuated Alina Habba’s appointment to act as the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey through a novel series of legal and personnel moves. Along the way, it has disagreed with the Judges of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey and criminal defendants in that District about who should or may lead the office. Faced with the question of whether Ms. Habba is lawfully performing the functions and duties of the office of the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey, I conclude that she is not. The judge found that Habba’s term as the interim US attorney ended in July, and the Trump administration’s maneuvers to keep her in the role without getting confirmation from the US Senate did not follow procedures required by federal law. Brann said he’s putting his order on hold pending an appeal. Habba, the daughter of Iraqi immigrants who unsuccessfully defended Trump in his New York fraud trial, also served as a frequent campaign surrogate for him in 2024. After being appointed to the interim role in March, she said the state could “turn red”, a rare, overt political expression from a prosecutor, and said she planned to investigate the state’s Democratic governor and attorney general. She then brought a trespassing charge, which was eventually dropped, against Newark’s mayor, Ras Baraka, stemming from a confrontation with federal agents during his visit to an immigration detention center. Habba later charged a Democratic congresswoman, LaMonica McIver, with assault for resisting the detention of the mayor in the same incident, a rare federal criminal case against a sitting member of Congress other than for corruption. She denies the charges and has pleaded not guilty. In late July her four-month temporary appointment was coming to a close and it became clear that she would not get support from home state senators Cory Booker and Andy Kim, both Democrats, meaning her chances of Senate approval were nil. Trump then withdrew her nomination and federal judges in New Jersey exercised their power under the law to replace Habba with a career prosecutor when Habba’s temporary appointment lapsed. The attorney general, Pam Bondi, retaliated by firing that prosecutor and moved to re-install Habba as acting US attorney. The California state assembly just advanced a constitutional amendment to temporarily suspend the state’s congressional boundaries, drawn by a voter-approved independent commission, and replace them with a map that creates five new Democratic House seats. It’s now heading to the Senate where it’s sure to pass. It’s the first of three bills that make up redistricting plan – spearheaded by California governor Gavin Newsom. A reminder that this is a response to Texas Republicans lawmakers passing a gerrymandered map that nets five new GOP-house seats in 2026. We can expect that to receive Senate approval later today, before heading to governor Greg Abbott’s desk. A New York state appeals court has thrown out a half-billion-dollar penalty that Donald Trump had been ordered to pay after a judge found the president fraudulently overstated the value of his properties and other assets to bolster his family business. And despite the president falsely claiming the ruling to be a “total victory”, the five-judge panel was deeply divided. Ultimately they lower court’s fraud verdict stand, which will pave the way for New York attorney general Letitia James to appeal the decision to the state’s highest court. The Trump administration is ratcheting up pressure on the Federal Reserve to remove governor Lisa Cook, after the economist declared she had “no intention of being bullied” into stepping down. The justice department plans to investigate Cook, with a top official informing Fed chair Jerome Powell of the probe and encouraging him to remove her from the board, according to a report by Bloomberg. When it comes to DC, the president said that he will join federal law enforcement and National Guard troops today in the nation’s capital. In a radio interview he confirmed his plans to patrol, but didn’t provide any more details on the length or specific location. As a reminder, the California plan is designed to flip as many as five Republican-held seats in California – the exact number of additional GOP seats Trump has said he is “entitled to” in Texas. “This is a new Democratic party, this is a new day, this is new energy out there all across this country,” Newsom said on a call with reporters on Wednesday. “And we’re going to fight fire with fire.” The redistricting tit-for-tat is an extraordinary deviation from the norm. Traditionally, states redraw congressional maps once a decade based on census data, with both the Texas and California maps originally intended to last through 2030. Prior to Thursday’s vote, California Republicans pleaded with their Democratic colleagues to oppose what they derisively called a “Gavinmander”. “The problem when you fight fire with fire is you burn it all down,” James Gallagher, the state assembly Republican leader, said at a news conference. The California assembly on Thursday approved the first in a series of three bills designed to redraw congressional boundaries and create five potential new Democratic US House seats. The effort in California is an answer to the Republican redistricting push in Texas, sought by Donald Trump and aimed at tilting the map in his party’s favor before next year’s midterm elections. The California assembly passed the measure in a 57-to-20 vote, sending it next to the state senate. Democrats hope to pass all three related bills by early afternoon. The state’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, who has led the redistricting push, intends to sign the bill as soon as it arrives on his desk. “We will not let our political system be hijacked by authoritarianism. And today, we give every Californian the power to say no,” said the Democratic assembly speaker Robert Rivas, in floor remarks before the vote. “To say no to Donald Trump’s power grab and yes to our people, to our state and to our democracy.” The California state assembly advanced the first in a series of three bills to temporarily suspend the state’s congressional boundaries, drawn by a voter-approved independent commission, and replace them with a map that creates five new Democratic seats. The lower house, which has a Democratic supermajority, approved the measure 57-20 along party lines. It now awaits a vote in the Senate where it’s likely to pass, and then will be put before voters in a special election on 4 November. California’s aim – spearheaded by governor Gavin Newsom – is to offset Texas’s gains, after Republican lawmakers passed a gerrymandered map that nets five new GOP-house seats in 2026. An effort that came at Donald Trump’s behest, and has now escalated into a nationwide redistricting battle. JD Vance took the stage in Peachtree City, talking about tax cuts and tariffs. “If you’re building it here, if you’re making it here ... we’re going to give you a big fat tax cut and that’s a good thing,” the vice president said. “But if you do it overseas and do it with a foreign then you’re going to pay a big fat tariff before you bring that back to the United States of America.” Workers will see a take home pay increase of $10,000 over a period of years because of the “Big Beautiful Bill,” Vance argued, claiming that it created the “biggest tax cut for working families in history.” President Donald Trump promised that the “only people who are going to lose access to health care are illegal aliens who shouldn’t be in this country to begin with,” Vance said. “I happen to believe that Medicaid belongs to working people.” The Trump administration is ratcheting up pressure on the Federal Reserve to remove governor Lisa Cook, after the economist declared she had “no intention of being bullied” into stepping down. Cook, who was appointed to the US central bank’s powerful board of governors by Joe Biden, has been accused by Donald Trump’s officials of committing mortgage fraud. The allegations are unconfirmed. The US president has waged an extraordinary war on the Fed’s independence, breaking with precedent to demand interest rate cuts and urge its chair, Jerome Powell, to resign. Trump promptly called on Cook to quit on Wednesday. The Department of Justice is reported to have indicated it is investigating the allegations, with a top Trump official telling Powell the case “requires further examination” – and calling on him to remove Cook from the Fed’s board. “At this time, I encourage you to remove Ms Cook from your Board,” Ed Martin, the official, wrote in a letter, according to Bloomberg News. “Do it today before it is too late! After all, no American thinks it is appropriate that she serve during this time with a cloud hanging over her.” Despite Martin’s demand, the Fed chair has no authority under the Federal Reserve Act to remove another member of the board of governors. On Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump had discussed how to fire Cook for cause, citing an unnamed administration official. As the president prepares to join federal law enforcement and National Guard troops for an evening patrol today, Maryland governor Wes Moore has invited Donald Trump to join the Baltimore mayor and local law enforcement for “a public safety walk” next month. “While we are not done delivering results for the people in our neighborhoods, I am deeply encouraged by our progress,” Moore wrote in a letter to the president. “We are currently on track to have the lowest number of homicides in Baltimore City since we began officially keeping crime statistics.” Trump has routinely criticised the Democratic governor’s handling of crime in Baltimore, despite a decrease in violent crime. Homicides in the city, for example, dropped by 23% according to local police data. My colleague, George Chidi, is in Peachtree City, Georgia and flags that vice president JD Vance has taken the stage. Donald Trump said that he will join federal law enforcement and National Guard troops in Washington DC on Thursday. In an interview on the Todd Starnes Show, the president confirmed his plan to join patrol efforts: I’m going out tonight, I’m going to keep it a secret. You’re the only one that knows. You and your lots of listeners…I’m going to be going out tonight I think with the police and with the military of course. He didn’t provide any more details on the length of the patrol, or specific locations where he’d join the police and National Guard. New York attorney general Letitia James announced that her office will appeal today’s decision to throw out the nearly half-billion-dollar penalty in the state’s civil fraud case against Donald Trump. James wrote: It should not be lost to history: yet another court has ruled that the president violated the law, and our case has merit. We will seek appeal to the Court of Appeals and continue to protect the rights and interests of New Yorkers.” The court’s deeply-divided opinion ultimately let the lower court’s fraud verdict stand – providing James the ability to appeal today’s ruling to New York’s highest court. Crowds have gathered for remarks this afternoon by vice president JD Vance at a factory in Peachtree City, Georgia. So have the state’s political hopefuls. Derek Dooley, former Tennessee coach turned US senate candidate, is mingling with the Republican faithful, as are primary contestants Republican congressmen Mike Collins and Buddy Carter of Georgia. Agriculture commissioner Tyler Harper and GOP representative Rich McCormick are also working the crowd. Vance is expected to highlight the budget and tax cuts at ALTA Refrigeration Inc., a family-owned industrial refrigeration firm. Business is robust, said Zane Piper, operations manager for the firm. ATLA makes refrigerators for supermarkets and other businesses. Almost all of its clients are domestic, and tariffs have had a limited effect on its material sourcing so far. “We have not seen a dramatic increase in price yet, but we are seeing suppliers of our issue special assessments.” Florida’s Republican governor Ron DeSantis sent a work crew in the dead of night to paint over a rainbow crosswalk outside an Orlando nightclub where 49 mostly LGBTQ+ victims lost their lives in a 2016 mass shooting, outraged Democrats said Thursday. The move, branded a “cruel political act” by Orlando’s mayor Buddy Collins, reported by WESH News, followed a directive from the Trump administration in July to remove what it saw as political banners on US roadways. “Taxpayers expect their dollars to fund safe streets, not rainbow crosswalks,” transportation secretary Sean Duffy said in a 1 July tweet giving states 60 days to comply. DeSantis, who has pursued a vigorous anti-LGBTQ+ agenda in his six and a half years as governor, moved to eradicate the memorial outside the former Pulse nightclub “without any supporting safety data or discussion,” Dyer said in a statement Thursday. Democratic state senator Carlos Guillermo Smith, who is openly gay, said in a post to TikTok that DeSantis had “vandalized” his city: “This rainbow crosswalk was placed here by our community with approval from the state not only to remember those 49 mostly LGBTQ people of color who were murdered here at this site, but also it was intended to keep pedestrians safe, so many visitors who have come to pay their respects to those who were taken,” he said. The state department has fired a press officer responsible for drafting Trump administration talking points about policy toward Israel and Gaza after complaints from the US embassy in Jerusalem, the Associated Press reports. Officials said Shahed Ghoreishi, a contractor working for the Bureau of Near East Affairs, was terminated over the weekend following two incidents last week in which his loyalty to Trump administration policies was called into question. Ghoreishi was also targeted yesterday following his dismissal by far-right activist and Trump loyalist Laura Loomer, who accused him of not being fully supportive of the administration’s policies in the Middle East. According to Ghoreishi and two current US officials, Ghoreishi drew the ire of a senior official at the embassy in Jerusalem and then top aides to secretary of state Marco Rubio for drafting a response to a query from AP last week. The question related to discussions between Israel and South Sudan about the possible relocation of Palestinian people from Gaza to South Sudan. The draft response included a line that said the US does not support the forced relocation of Gazans, something that Donald Trump and his special envoy Steve Witkoff have said repeatedly. However, according to Ghoreishi and the officials, that line was rejected by the embassy in Jerusalem, leading to questions about policy back in Washington. Ghoreishi also said he questioned a statement from the embassy that referred to the (occupied) West Bank as “Judea and Samaria”, the biblical term for the Palestinian territory that some far-right Israeli officials prefer. Mike Huckabee, US ambassador to Israel, also has repeatedly backed referring to the West Bank by Judea and Samaria. Donald Trump has hailed an appeals court’s decision to throw out the nearly half-billion-dollar judgment against him in his New York civil fraud case as a “total victory” and called for the judge who imposed the fine to be “admonished for abuse”. In a lengthy post on Truth Social, the president called the case a “political witch hunt” and claimed “everything I did was absolutely CORRECT and, even, PERFECT”. Per my earlier post on this, it was far from a “total victory” for the president. The appeals court was splintered, with two judges finding that Trump was properly held liable, and the case “vindicated a public interest”, but found that the penalty was an excessive fine that violated the US constitution. Two other judges also found there was authority to sue, but a new trial was necessary because the trial judge should not have held Trump liable for fraud at the outset. Only the fifth judge said the case against Trump should have been dismissed. The justice department plans to investigate Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, with a top official informing Fed chair Jerome Powell of the probe and encouraging him to remove her from the board, Bloomberg News is reporting. A letter to Powell from Ed Martin, a DOJ official who has led similar investigations into senator Adam Schiff of California and New York attorney general Letitia James, said Cook’s case “requires further examination,” according to Bloomberg’s report. “At this time, I encourage you to remove Ms. Cook from your Board,” Martin wrote. “Do it today before it is too late! After all, no American thinks it is appropriate that she serve during this time with a cloud hanging over her.” Asked about the report, a Fed spokesperson referred Reuters to Cook’s statement yesterday, when she said she had no intention of resigning after Donald Trump called for her to step down on the basis of allegations made by a member of his administration about mortgages she holds in Michigan and Georgia, intensifying Trump’s effort to gain influence over the US central bank. The Federal Reserve Act provides no authority for a Fed chair to remove another member of the board of governors. The president has repeatedly broken with precedent in recent months to demand the Fed cut rates and urge Powell to quit after disregarding such calls. Cook, whose current term on the Fed’s board extends until 2038, previously served on the council of economic advisers under Barack Obama. When she took office in May 2022, she became the first black woman to sit on the central bank’s board. A New York state appeals court has thrown out an approximately half-billion-dollar penalty that Donald Trump had been ordered to pay after a judge found the president fraudulently overstated the value of his properties and other assets to bolster his family business. The decision by a five-judge panel of the appellate division in Manhattan represented a defeat for New York attorney general Letitia James, whose office brought the civil fraud lawsuit against Trump in 2022. James’ case had been among Trump’s biggest legal losses in a slew of lawsuits against him in recent years. Lawyers for Trump did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. James’ office did not immediately respond to similar requests. The appeals court was splintered. Two judges found Trump was properly held liable, and James “vindicated a public interest” by pursuing her fraud case, but the penalty was an excessive fine that violated the US constitution. Two other judges also found James had authority to sue, but a new trial was necessary because the trial judge should not have held Trump liable for fraud at the outset. The fifth judge said the case against Trump should have been dismissed. Trump was appealing a judgment entered by Justice Arthur Engoron in a state court in Manhattan, following a three-month nonjury trial. Engoron found Trump had inflated his wealth over several years before first becoming president in 2017, to dupe lenders and insurers into providing better terms to the Trump Organization. Trump has denied wrongdoing. His lawyers argued that the penalty was too high and that James had overreached. In February 2024, the judge ordered Trump to pay $454.2m in penalties plus interest, which has continued to accrue. Trump was personally liable for nearly 98% of the judgment, with his eldest sons, Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump, and former Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg responsible for the remainder. Referring to Trump and other Trump Organization figures, Engoron said their “complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological”. Engoron also banned Trump and the Trump Organization from applying for loans from banks registered in the state for three years, and effectively barred Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump from running the business for two years. The appeals court put these restrictions on hold during the appeals process, while letting a court-appointed monitor for the Trump Organization continue her work. Members of the press travelling with vice president report that Vance, the second lady and EPA administrator Zeldin have landed in Georgia. The vice president is heading to a Republican National Committee meeting first that will not be open to the press. Donald Trump again called for the release of a former election clerk in Colorado who was convicted for her role in breaching election data in a quest to find fraud, threatening he would take “harsh measures” if she wasn’t let out of prison. “FREE TINA PETERS, a brave and innocent Patriot who has been tortured by Crooked Colorado politicians, including the big Mail-In Ballot supporting the governor of the State,” Trump said on Truth Social. “Let Tina Peters out of jail, RIGHT NOW. She did nothing wrong, except catching the Democrats cheat in the Election. She is an old woman, and very sick. If she is not released, I am going to take harsh measures!!!” Peters did not find evidence of Democrats cheating in the election. She was charged for allowing access to county voting equipment by an outside election activist, who was given security credentials under a different name. Materials and passwords were then published online on Telegram and on the rightwing outlet the Gateway Pundit. Peters was found guilty by a jury in Mesa county in 2024 of seven counts related to misconduct, conspiracy and impersonation, four of which were felony charges. She was sentenced later that year to nine years in prison. Her attorneys had argued for probation instead of prison time. Also, earlier today, the president took to Truth Social to say that Ukraine’s strategy has been purely focused on defence. “It is very hard, if not impossible, to win a war without attacking an invaders country,” Trump wrote. “It’s like a great team in sports that has a fantastic defense, but is not allowed to play offense. There is no chance of winning! It is like that with Ukraine and Russia. Crooked and grossly incompetent Joe Biden would not let Ukraine FIGHT BACK, only DEFEND.” This comes after the president’s meeting on Monday with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and several European leaders, where Trump said that the America would help to coordinate security guarantees for Ukraine. The White House later confirmed that no US troops would be on the ground in Ukraine, but hinted that some form of air support could be possible. A reminder that my colleague, Jakub Krupa, is following the latest developments in Europe. Donald Trump intends to leave Russia and Ukraine to organize a meeting between their leaders without directly playing a role for now, according to administration officials familiar with the situation, taking a step back from the negotiations to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The next stage in Trump’s eyes to end the war in Ukraine remains a bilateral meeting between Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, the officials said. Trump has told advisers in recent days that he intends to host a trilateral meeting with the two leaders only after they have met first, although whether that initial conference takes place remains unclear and Trump does not intend to become involved in that effort. In some more news from Texas, GOP congressman Chip Roy has announced a bid for attorney general, ahead of next year’s first open contest for the job in more than a decade. “I’ll always defend the conservative values our Texas families cherish,” Roy said in his campaign video. “Today we draw a line in the sand, Texas’ next attorney general must have a proven record of fighting to preserve, protect and defend our legacy.” There are already several Republican candidates set to battle it out in a primary to succeed outgoing attorney general Ken Paxton – who has launched a challenge to unseat senator John Cornyn. Roy, who served as Paxton’s assistant attorney general before joining Congress, where he’s become an outspoken member of the conservative wing, and serves in the Freedom Caucus. Roy has also clashed with Donald Trump, most recently when he opposed the president’s proposal to raise the debt ceiling last year. In retaliation, Trump called for Roy to be primaried. An update from the press pool travelling with vice president JD Vance today to Peachtree, Georgia. Vance will headline a messaging event at 2pm for the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which is now being rebranded by the administration as ‘working families tax cuts’. The vice president is also travelling with second lady Usha Vance, and Lee Zeldin, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Donald Trump has made several unusual moves to elongate the era of coal, such as giving the industry exemptions from pollution rules. But the gambit to keep one Michigan coal-fired power station running has been extraordinary – by forcing it to remain open even against the wishes of its operator. The hulking JH Campbell power plant, which since 1962 has sat a few hundred yards from the sand dunes at the edge of Lake Michigan, was just eight days away from a long-planned closure in May when Trump’s Department of Energy issued an emergency order that it remain open for a further 90 days. On Wednesday, the administration intervened again to extend this order even further, prolonging the lifetime of the coal plant another 90 days, meaning it will keep running until November – six months after it was due to close. The move, taken under emergency powers more normally used during wartime or in the wake of disaster, has stunned local residents and the plant’s operator, Consumers Energy. “My family had a countdown for it closing, we couldn’t wait,” said Mark Oppenhuizen, who has lived in the shadow of the plant for 30 years and suspects its pollution worsened his wife’s lung disease. “I was flabbergasted when the administration said they had stopped it shutting down,” he said. “Why are they inserting themselves into a decision a company has made? Just because politically you don’t like it? It’s all so dumb.” Attorney general Pam Bondi said that there have been 630 arrests since the beginning of the federal law enforcement surge in the nation’s capital earlier this month. In her post on X, she added that agents have also seized 86 illegal guns in this period. When Donald Trump’s administration escalated immigration raids in Los Angeles earlier this summer, protest organizers responded with actions staged in an unusual setting: the hotels where immigration officers were staying. Protests took place at several southern California hotels where Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents had been spotted. Some activists launched “No sleep for Ice” rallies, with chants and music blaring through the night, in hopes of pressuring the hotels to kick agents out. Now, public records shared with the Guardian show that the protests indeed sent federal agencies scrambling to find hotels for their officers in LA where they would not be “harassed”. A 16 June email from the US marines shows that military officials made a list of “LA Hotels to Avoid”. The information came from multiple law enforcement agencies who were tracking the community backlash to Ice and the border patrol, the marines said. The list was written by Army North, the domestic defense command deployed on the ground during the protests, and reviewed by the navy’s south-west division. And when it comes to California’s redistricting efforts, a new poll from Politico and UC Berkeley Citrin Center found that while 70% of Democrats think that partisan gerrymandering is “never acceptable”, 63% do support the plan to counter Texas’ new GOP-drawn map by responding with a redistricting plan that offsets Republican gains in the US House. More broadly, 42% of all respondents to the poll said that voters are most harmed by partisan redistricting. On Wednesday night, the California state supreme court declined an emergency request by Republican lawmakers, which sought to block the Democratic plan to temporarily get rid of the maps drawn by a voter-approved independent redistricting commission. Now the California legislature will vote today on three bills that would allow for a November special election to redraw the state’s congressional boundaries – creating five new Democratic House seats in the process. The aim is to offset Texas’s gains, after Republican lawmakers passed a gerrymandered map that nets five new GOP-house seats in 2026. An effort that came at Donald Trump’s behest, and has now escalated into a nationwide redistricting battle. The new Texas map now heads to the state senate today for approval – where it is sure to advance – before being signed into law by the governor, Greg Abbott. Meanwhile, Democrats have a supermajority at the Sacramento capitol, and will probably pass the new maps. It’s important to note that California’s proposed legislation has language that stipulates it only goes into effect if Texas’s new GOP-drawn map is approved. My colleague Lauren Gambino has been covering the latest and notes that California’s redistricting counter-effort, spearheaded by Governor Gavin Newsom, has “caused angst among some Democrats and independents who have fought for years to combat gerrymandering”. The president doesn’t have any public events today, according to his official schedule. He’ll receive an intelligence briefing at 11am ET, and then will sign executive orders in the Oval Office at 3pm ET. For the moment that’s closed to the press, but we’ll update you if that changes. The California state legislature was poised on Thursday to vote on a plan to redraw its congressional boundaries and create five potential new Democratic House seats – an answer to the Republican redistricting push in Texas, sought by Donald Trump, aimed at tilting the map in his party’s favor ahead of next year’s midterm elections. The nation’s two most populous – and ideologically opposed – states were racing on parallel tracks toward consequential redistricting votes, potentially within hours of each other. As Democrats in Sacramento worked to advance a legislative package that would put their “election rigging response act” before voters in a special election this fall, Republicans in Austin were nearing a final vote on their own gerrymandering pursuit. Approval by the Texas senate, which is expected as early as Thursday, would conclude a dramatic showdown with the state’s outnumbered Democratic lawmakers whose two-week boycott captured national attention and set in motion a coast-to-coast redistricting battle. The California plan, led by the state’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, is designed to flip as many as five Republican-held seats in California – the exact number of additional GOP seats Trump has said he is “entitled to” in Texas. “This is a new Democratic party, this is a new day, this is new energy out there all across this country,” Newsom said on a call with reporters on Wednesday. “And we’re going to fight fire with fire.” The redistricting tit-for-tat is an extraordinary deviation from the norm. Traditionally, states redraw congressional maps once a decade based on census data, with both the Texas and California maps originally intended to last through 2030. The California state legislature, where Democrats have a supermajority, is expected to easily approve new congressional maps despite sharp Republican objections. Newsom’s signature would send the measure to the ballot in a special election this November. The California changes would only take effect in response to a gerrymander by a Republican state – a condition that would be met when the Texas legislatures sends the maps to the state’s governor, Greg Abbott, for his promised signature. The government lost its bid to unseal grand jury transcripts in the sex-trafficking case against Jeffrey Epstein. Richard Berman, a federal judge in New York, said the transcripts pale in comparison to the documents the government already has on Epstein and that disclosing them could harm victims. The ruling comes after a different judge ruled against disclosure in a separate effort to unseal transcripts in a case against Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s former girlfriend. Maxwell is in prison on a 20-year sentence after she was convicted of sex trafficking for aiding Epstein’s sexual abuses. Epstein, who died by suicide in custody in 2019 while awaiting trial, sexually abused hundreds of girls and women and operated a sex-trafficking ring over decades. He was connected with some of the world’s most powerful people. Documents related to his conduct could reveal his connections, how he made his money and how he was able to evade justice for so long. The government was seeking to unseal 70 pages of grand jury transcripts, exhibits including a PowerPoint presentation, four pages of call logs and letters from victims and their attorneys, from proceedings that took place in 2019. The motions to unseal the documents came as the Trump administration is under intense scrutiny from its supporters over failure to release Epstein files in its possession. Trump had previously promised to release the files, a longtime goal for the Maga movement, and now has sought to tamp down fury among his Maga acolytes over the files. Trump and Epstein were once friends, and his entanglements have come under renewed examination. JD Vance was booed and heckled with chants of “Free DC!” during a photo op with national guard troops at Union Station in Washington on Wednesday afternoon. Handing out burgers to troops deployed last week by Donald Trump, at the station’s Shake Shack alongside the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, and White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, Vance told soldiers “we appreciate everything you’re doing” and asserted: “We brought some law and order back.” Meanwhile, a crowd of demonstrators protested outside. The crowd shouted slogans such as “Free DC!” and “From DC to Palestine, occupation is a crime.” Some also shouted expletives as the three men walked into Union Station and gathered at the restaurant, and continued as they tried to speak to reporters and eventually left. Asked why the troops were at the station instead of parts of the city where crime rates were statistically higher, Vance claimed it was being overrun with “vagrants, drug addicts, the chronically homeless and the mentally ill” and that visitors didn’t feel safe. “This should be a monument to American greatness,” he said, later adding: “We do not have to live like this.” Addressing the protests, Vance said: It’s kind of bizarre that we have a bunch of old, primarily white people who are out there protesting the policies that keep people safe when they’ve never felt danger in their entire lives. Donald Trump has called on a Federal Reserve governor to immediately resign, renewing his extraordinary attack on the central bank’s independence as officials mull next steps on interest rates. A close Trump ally accused Lisa Cook, an appointee of Joe Biden, of “potentially committing mortgage fraud” and urged the US Department of Justice to investigate. The claims have not been confirmed, and this evening Cook said she had “no intention of being bullied” into stepping down. The US president has repeatedly broken with precedent in recent months to demand the Fed cut rates and urge its chair, Jerome Powell, to quit after disregarding such calls. On Wednesday, Trump leaped on the allegations about Cook. The governor “must resign, now!!!”, he wrote on Truth Social, his social media platform. Cook, whose current term on the Fed’s board extends until 2038, previously served on the council of economic advisers under Barack Obama. When she took office in May 2022, she became the first Black woman to sit on the central bank’s board. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that any California school district that did not adhere to his administration’s transgender policies would not be funded. On Truth Social, he wrote: Any California school district that doesn’t adhere to our Transgender policies, will not be funded. Thank you for your attention to this matter! Amid the Donald Trump administration’s heavy-handed review of Smithsonian museums, the Guardian has seen a document compiled by the White House that details examples of how the widely visited cultural institutions have overly negative portrayals of US history. The document, based on public submissions shared with the administration, points to what it says are problematic exhibits at seven different museums, including a Benjamin Franklin exhibit that links his scientific achievements to his ownership of enslaved people and a film about George Floyd’s murder that it says mischaracterizes the police. “President Trump will explore all options and avenues to get the Woke out of the Smithsonian and hold them accountable,” a White House official said. “Until we get info from the Smithsonian in response to our letter, we can’t verify the numbers of artifacts that have been removed because the Smithsonian has removed them on their own.” Trump announced the initiative on Truth Social earlier this week, writing: “The Smithsonian is OUT OF CONTROL, where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been.” The seven museums that have so far been flagged for review include the National Museum of American History, National Museum of the American Latino, National Museum of Natural History, National Museum of African Art, National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian American Art Museum and National Museum of Asian Art. Uganda has entered an agreement with the United States to take in nationals from third countries who may not get asylum in the US but are reluctant to return to their countries of origin, the foreign affairs ministry said on Thursday. President Donald Trump aims to deport millions of immigrants who entered the US illegally and his administration has sought to increase removals to third countries, including by sending convicted criminals to South Sudan and Eswatini, Reuters reported. “This is a temporary arrangement with conditions including that individuals with criminal records and unaccompanied minors will not be accepted,” Vincent Bagiire Waiswa, the ministry’s permanent secretary, said in a statement. Waiswa added that Uganda would prefer to receive people from African nationalities under the agreement. “The two parties are working out the detailed modalities on how the agreement shall be implemented,” he said. On Wednesday, another Ugandan foreign affairs official had denied a US media report that the East African country had agreed to take in people deported from the United States, saying it lacked the facilities to accommodate them. Barack Obama waded into states’ efforts at rare mid-decade redistricting efforts, saying he agreed with California governor Gavin Newsom’s plan to counter the new Texas congressional map by launching an effort to redraw his own state’s map and create more Democratic-friendly districts, calling it “a responsible approach”. “I believe that governor Newsom’s approach is a responsible approach. He said this is going to be responsible. We’re not going to try to completely maximize it,” Obama said at a Tuesday fundraiser on Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts. “We’re only going to do it if and when Texas and/or other Republican states begin to pull these maneuvers. Otherwise, this doesn’t go into effect.” Obama also called Newsom’s strategy “measured”, as it only temporarily grants the California legislature the ability to redraw maps mid-decade. While noting that “political gerrymandering” is not his “preference,” Obama said that, if Democrats “don’t respond effectively, then this White House and Republican-controlled state governments all across the country, they will not stop, because they do not appear to believe in this idea of an inclusive, expansive democracy”. According to organizers, the event raised $2m for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee and its affiliates, one of which has filed and supported litigation in several states over Republican-drawn districts. The former House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Eric Holder, who served as Obama’s attorney general and heads up the group, also appeared. Most Americans believe that efforts to redraw U.S. House of Representatives districts to maximize partisan gains, like those under way in Texas and California, are bad for democracy, a new Reuters/Ipsos poll found. More than half of respondents - 57% - said they feared that American democracy itself was in danger, a view held by eight in 10 Democrats and four in 10 in president Donald Trump’s Republican party. The six-day survey of 4,446 US adults, which closed on Monday, showed deep unease with the growing political divisions in Washington - where Republicans control both chambers of Congress - and state capitals. The poll found that 55% of respondents, including 71% of Democrats and 46% of Republicans, agreed that ongoing redistricting plans - such as those hatched by governors in Texas and California in a process known as gerrymandering - were “bad for democracy.” At Trump’s urging, Republican Texas governor Greg Abbott has called a special session of the state legislature to redraw the state’s congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, aiming to help Republicans defend their 219-212 US House majority. When Texas Republicans redrew their congressional map this month at the urging of Donald Trump, they faced a difficult task. They needed to find a way to pick up five seats that the president wanted ahead of the midterm elections next year without spreading their voters too thin and jeopardizing the 25 seats they already held. Here is a visual breakdown of the redrawn congressional maps… Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. My name is Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest news lines over the next few hours. We start with news that the Texas legislature’s lower chamber passed a contentious new electoral map on Wednesday that aims to help Donald Trump’s Republican party retain its razor-thin US House majority in the 2026 midterm elections, AFP reported. The vote had been delayed by two weeks after Democratic legislators fled the southern state to halt the redistricting drive, which carves out five new Republican-friendly districts. More than 50 Democrats walked out, stalling legislative business and generating national headlines as they sought to draw attention to the rare mid-decade redistricting push. The Democratic lawmakers returned this week, but not before their protest had set off a national map-drawing war, with Trump pressuring his party’s state-level officials to do everything they can to protect the majority in the US House of Representatives. The stakes are sky-high for Trump, who will be bogged down in investigations into almost every aspect of his second term if Democrats manage to flip the handful of districts nationwide needed to win back the House in next year’s midterm elections. Trump hailed the “Big WIN for the Great State of Texas“ on Wednesday night. “Everything Passed, on our way to FIVE more Congressional seats and saving your Rights, your Freedoms, and your Country, itself,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform. “Texas never lets us down.” The president also suggested Florida, Indiana and other states were looking into pursuing similar redistricting to benefit Republicans while once again calling to “STOP MAIL-IN VOTING.” Trump - who has long railed against postal ballots, even though they have benefited his party and he has voted by mail - said in a separate post: END MAIL-IN VOTING, AND GO TO PAPER BALLOTS. 100 additional seats will go to Republicans!!!” In other developments: The vice-president, JD Vance, the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, and the White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, staged a photo op with National Guard troops at Union Station in the nation’s capital. They were roundly booed and jeered on their way in and out of the station. A federal judge denied the justice department’s bid to unseal records from the grand jury that indicted Jeffrey Epstein in 2019. US district judge Richard Berman said the small number of documents seen by the court pale in comparison with the 100,000 records the government already has on Epstein and that disclosing them could harm victims. Lisa Cook, the Federal Reserve governor Trump has called on to immediately resign over an accusation that she falsely declared a property she obtained a mortgage on was her primary residence, responded on Wednesday that she has “no intention of being bullied to step down”. Trump has bought at least $100m of bonds since he returned to office in January, according to a CNBC analysis of new filings from the president with the US Office of Government Ethics. A young American citizen who was violently arrested by federal immigration officers in Los Angeles county in June, after he objected to the arrest of an older man in a Walmart parking lot, was charged with conspiracy to impede a federal officer.
