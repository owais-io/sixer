  August is another bright sky month in the northern hemisphere so we’re having
  to look for late night and early morning events featuring bright celestial
  objects. Luckily, Venus has us covered. The planet reaches its highest
  altitude in the morning sky this month, rising more than three hours earlier
  than the Sun at mid-northern latitudes and shining brilliantly in the eastern
  sky. This week, the planet is located in the constellation of Gemini, the
  Twins. It will be unmistakably bright, shining with an apparent magnitude of
  –4, making it brighter than everything else in the sky, except the Sun and the
  moon. This will mean it is visible even from the most light-polluted urban
  environments. If you have a small telescope to hand, the crescent phase of
  Venus will be clearly visible – but stop observing before sunrise, as even a
  glimpse of the Sun through a telescope can cause permanent eye damage.
  Observers in the southern hemisphere can also enjoy Venus in the early
  morning, but it will appear lower on the eastern horizon. Thankfully, its
  dazzling brightness should still make it obvious. The chart is a heads up for
  next week. On 12 August, Venus and Jupiter will meet in the pre-dawn skies.
  The chart shows the view looking east from London at 5am BST.
