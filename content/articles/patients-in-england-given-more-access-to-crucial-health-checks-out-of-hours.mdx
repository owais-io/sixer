  Patients in England now have greater access to important tests such as MRI
  scans and endoscopies in the evenings and weekends, the government has said,
  after increasing the number of community diagnostic centres (CDCs) offering
  out of hours services. There are 170 CDCs operating in England, which are
  often in shopping centres, football stadiums and on university campuses.
  Patients can access them through a referral from their GP or clinical teams at
  hospitals. The government has revealed that 100 CDCs are open 12 hours a day,
  seven days a week – an increase of 37 CDCs with such opening hours compared
  with July 2024 – with the hope that the service will allow patients greater
  and speedier access to diagnosis. The move to provide more convenient care is
  part of the government’s plan for change which, it says, aims to transform
  healthcare and make the NHS fit for the future, with an expansion of
  community-based services a key part of the approach. Wes Streeting, the health
  secretary, said: “This government is determined to offer healthcare that fits
  around working people’s lives and not the other way around. “From early
  morning MRI scans to late evening blood tests, we’re meeting patients where
  they need it most by extending the operating hours for community diagnostic
  centres and putting patients first.” The government has also committed to
  building up to five more CDCs in 2025-26 and is planning to extend opening
  hours for all CDCs at evenings and on weekends. It said latest data showed the
  NHS delivered more than 1.6 million more tests and scans from July 2024 to
  June 2025 compared with the same time the previous year. Sarah Sleet, the
  chief executive at Asthma + Lung UK, welcomed the expansion of opening hours
  for CDCs. “Making it easier for people to access tests close to home is
  crucial to improve diagnosis rates for lung conditions,” she said. “Receiving
  an early and accurate diagnosis is essential for treating and managing
  someone’s lung condition, it can lead to a reduction in hospital admissions
  and even lengthen their life. We hope this focus on neighbourhood diagnostics
  will lead to quicker diagnosis of lung conditions, the UK’s third biggest
  killer, at a time when a historic lack of access to tests is leaving tens of
  thousands of people breathless and anxious.” Laura Challinor, the senior
  policy manager at Blood Cancer UK, also welcomed the expansion of out-of-hours
  appointments but said further action was needed given blood cancer was the
  UK’s third biggest cancer killer and survival rates were lagging behind those
  of similar countries. “For CDCs to be of most benefit to people with blood
  cancer, we also want to see a commitment to end regional variation in
  diagnostic testing practice, including full blood count (FBC) tests available
  for those presenting with non-specific symptoms, and timed diagnostic pathways
  developed for blood cancers,” she said. Charlotte Beardmore, the executive
  director of professional policy at the Society of Radiographers, said CDCs
  offered patients improved access to routine imaging investigations, while
  timely diagnostics through CDCs were essential to ensure patients could access
  treatments sooner. But while Beardmore said the location, and extended opening
  hours of CDCs, could make it easier for patients to attend, she stressed a
  growing demand for imaging meant the government must invest in the radiography
  workforce. “This means investment in new NHS posts for radiographers to ensure
  all CDCs offer the capability, flexibility and the range of services for
  patients in their local community,” she said. “Without radiographers CDCs
  cannot function.”
