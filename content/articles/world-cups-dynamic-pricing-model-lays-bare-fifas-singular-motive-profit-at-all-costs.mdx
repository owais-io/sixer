  all costs

  If there’s the tiniest sliver of an upside to the latest news about ticketing
  for the 2026 World Cup, it’s that we can finally dispense with the pretense
  that Fifa is interested in growing the game any more. Fifa confirmed on
  Wednesday that it will, for the first time, use a dynamic ticket pricing model
  for the tournament, which will be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and
  Canada. While tickets will initially range from $60 for the cheap seats in
  some group-stage matches to $6,730 for the best vantage point at the final,
  those prices will then be algorithmically handed over to the market to respond
  to demand, which will probably cause them to skyrocket. After all, the first
  tranche of tickets goes on sale through an application and lottery system next
  week, but the World Cup draw will not take place until December. The gap
  between ticket sales and the assignment of teams to those actual matches all
  but guarantees a surge of demand for a diminished supply. Effectively, Fifa
  has absorbed the secondary market of ticket sales – the bit of the ticket
  hustle that arbitrages the market – in the name of protecting the fans, while
  subjecting fans to the exact same extortion. But rather than being a lone tout
  loitering outside a stadium, hoping to scalp a few tickets for a profit, it’s
  Fifa itself making the deals. Dynamic pricing – or price-gouging, as it was
  traditionally called – feels like a betrayal of the unspoken covenant of
  fandom, where you agree to give away a decent amount of your money in exchange
  for a performance by a team or band or show you like. It does not give the
  event license to ask for every penny they can shake loose from you.
  Instituting it for the world’s most popular sporting event is another
  mask-off, you’re-just-customers-to-us moment from Fifa. The global governing
  body once spread around World Cup hosting duties on the basis of the sport’s
  expansion, strategically picking nations, or co-hosts, not necessarily by
  potential profit margins but by regional footprint. It went to South Africa in
  2010 and Brazil in 2014 not because they were the most moneyed markets, but to
  spread the sport around the globe. That was the supposed impetus for going to
  tiny Qatar in 2022 as well, a first Arab World Cup. This World Cup, it is ever
  more plain, will be here in North America because the most disposable income
  is here. And Fifa will help itself to as much of it as it can. “It’s key to
  highlight Fifa’s mission and Fifa’s objective of providing funding, providing
  opportunities, providing growth to our sport across all the 211 member
  associations,” Heimo Schirgi, Fifa’s World Cup 2026 chief operating officer,
  told the Associated Press. “And as part of that mission … we’re looking at
  optimizing the revenue, but also optimizing attendance in the stadium, right?
  So, it’s always a balance between different factors.” It claims to do so out
  of a kind of fiduciary duty to its member federations, but to further
  constrain attendance at the sport’s signature event to the lucky few who can
  afford it gives the lie to serving the best interests of the sport writ large.
  Fifa also justifies its use of dynamic pricing on the argument that this is
  simply how business is conducted in North America and what the consumer
  expects. If this assertion is shaky – a YouGov poll shows that Americans, in
  fact, think dynamic pricing for sporting events is unfair by a 2-1 ratio,
  among the highest margins in the world – it’s worth looking at how dynamic
  pricing has been greeted by fans at other high-profile events. After
  widespread anger erupted at the dynamic pricing that more than doubled the
  cost of some Oasis reunion tour tickets in the United Kingdom, the band
  ditched the model for its US dates. Taylor Swift reportedly declined to price
  tickets to the Eras Tour dynamically as well, even though it probably meant
  leaving (even more) money on the table. “She didn’t want to do that to her
  fans,” an AEG executive explained in an interview. Even Wendy’s faced
  ferocious backlash when it announced that it would introduce dynamic pricing
  in its fast-food restaurants, before it backed down. The argument in favor of
  dynamic pricing is that it’s also possible for the cost of tickets to drop, as
  they did when the get-in-the-building prices for the Fluminense-Chelsea Club
  World Cup semi-final tumbled from almost $500 to just $13 in July. But this
  time around, Fifa will institute a price floor of $60 – the initial face value
  – to foreclose the possibility of losing revenue. Fifa is doing nothing
  illegal. Dynamic pricing is legal in North America so long as it doesn’t
  violate anti-trust laws, while UK legislators have taken an interest and
  Australia has moved to ban it. Some states, like New York, require a
  disclosure. It is also legal to use the data you have on your customers – a
  browsing history suggesting, for instance, a desperation to snag tickets to a
  particular game – to set prices, which is known as “surveillance pricing”.
  Under former US president Joe Biden, the Federal Trade Commission looked into
  this practice, but that inquiry was swiftly abandoned by the Trump
  administration. Fifa, then, isn’t breaking any rules. And it was probably
  naive to expect any other approach in the way it would monetize its cash cow
  event. But it confirmed, once more, that it is less a custodian of the sport
  than a proprietor expecting to maximize its return. Leander Schaerlaeckens’
  book on the United States men’s national soccer team is out in the spring of
  2026. You can preorder it here. He teaches at Marist University.
