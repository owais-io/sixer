  Nostalgia for the 1990s remains heavy. Just look at all those stadiums and
  parks the Gallaghers are filling. Football from the late 20th century has a
  similar cachet. No video assistant referees, no sportswashing; just good,
  hard, honest, simple fare, when men were men and pressing was what you did to
  your Burton suit. If the past is a foreign country then a recent BBC Archive
  release is a primary source of a time when the continental import remained
  exotic and not the dominant division of labour. “Is English Football In
  Crisis?” asks an edition of On The Line in October 1993, broadcast the night
  before Graham Taylor’s England played a key World Cup qualifier in Rotterdam.
  You know the match: Brian Moore correctly reading Ronald Koeman’s free-kick –
  “he’s gonna flick one” – and the pathos of Taylor’s hectoring of the linesman
  as England’s hopes of qualifying for USA ’94 sink into the briny. Such is the
  soap opera of the English game – its warring factions, its unrelenting thirst
  for cash – that a crisis is often close, though now further down the food
  chain than the England team and the Premier League. A televised meeting of
  2025’s key actors is near unimaginable considering the secrecy many owners
  maintain, the global span from whence they come and many battles already being
  in camera through lawyers. The number of talking heads and influencers willing
  to step into the gaps is almost too grotesque to countenance. Snapshot to 1993
  however, 14 months into the life of the Premier League, an entity barely
  mentioned over 40 minutes, and a room of football men are vehemently defending
  their corners. Just one woman is visible; the future sports minister Kate
  Hoey, and just one black face; that of Brendon Batson, deputy chief executive
  of the Professional Footballers’ Association. He remains wordless. A
  raven-haired John Inverdale operates as a Robert Kilroy-Silk/Jerry Springer
  figure as various blokes in baggy suits – “some of the most influential and
  thoughtful people in football” is Inverdale’s billing – fight their corners.
  Here is a time before gym-buff execs, when male-pattern baldness is still
  legally allowed in boardrooms and exec boxes, when a moustache is anything but
  ironic. “The whole game is directed towards winning rather than learning,”
  complains John Cartwright, recently resigned coach at the Lilleshall national
  academy, a less than gentle loosener. England’s Football Association is
  swiftly under attack from Hoey over being “out of touch”. Enter Jimmy Hill, a
  Zelig of football as player, manager, chair, the revolutionary behind the 1961
  removal of the maximum wage, major figure – on and off screen – behind
  football’s growth as a television sport. Few have filled the role of English
  football man so completely and his responses to Hoey are dismissive,
  truculent. “You can only attack one question at a time and I find the attacks
  are so ignorant,” he rails, defending English coaching. Hill’s stance has not
  travelled well. Within three years, Arsène Wenger, among others, would be
  upending the sanctity of English coaching exceptionalism. A short film from
  the ever gloomy Graham Kelly follows. The then-Football Association chief
  executive dolefully advertises his body’s youth development plan before David
  Pleat’s description of English youngsters as merely “reasonable” rather blows
  Kelly’s cover. Former Manchester City manager Malcolm Allison, by 1993 a
  long-lost 1960s revolutionary, declares England’s kids were behind Ajax’s as
  early as the late-1950s. “Big Mal”, demeanour far more On The Buses than On
  The Line, cuts the dash of ageing rebel, an Arthur Seaton still restless in
  his dotage, cast to the fringes as Cassandra. Next the programme’s wild card;
  Eamon Dunphy, footballer turned bestselling writer. The irascible face of
  Irish punditry for many decades seizes the stage with typical barbed lyricism,
  hunting down the stuffed shirts who run the game, full j’accuse mode adopted
  from his opening words. “English football has historically drawn its talent
  from the streets but unfortunately it has left its inspiration in the gutter,”
  he begins his own short film. Dunphy then lashes the “merchant class” that
  “have always wielded power”, kicks against the “subservient”, celebrating
  football’s “free spirited” outsiders. “Football’s greatest men have usually
  been its saddest – ignored, betrayed or patronised,” says Dunphy, soon enough
  labelling English football media coverage as “banal”. “Where is football’s
  Neville Cardus?” he asks, referencing the Guardian’s legendary cricket writer,
  setting a slew of fellow journalists, including the late David Lacey, also of
  this parish, on defensive footings. Cast in 1993 as rabble-rousing agent of
  chaos from across the water, Dunphy would declare himself an Anglophile in his
  2013 autobiography, appreciative of the freedom found in 1960s Manchester
  compared to the illiberal Ireland he came from. Here he despairs for what made
  English football once so magical, bemoaning Allison’s estrangement and that
  Hill’s experience was also confined to the sidelines. Arsenal vice-chairman
  David Dein, a prime Premier League’s architect, is next for a Dunphy dagger.
  “You seem exceedingly smug about the idea of kids having to pay more for their
  identity” is a laser-guided attack on replica shirts being replaced each
  summer. It proves a tinderbox moment. Hill and Professional Footballers’
  Association chair Gordon Taylor soon fly at each other. “Get yer facts right,
  Jim,” hisses Taylor as the subject of player wages ignites a bonfire fanned
  further by agent Eric Hall’s “monster monster” smirks. Inverdale calls for
  order and concludes with a round-robin from which Pleat’s “you need an
  impossible man, a democratic dictator right at the top of football” sounds
  positively frightening. Somewhere in Pleat’s logic may lie the UK government’s
  imminent imposition of an independent football regulator, a process that led
  today’s power brokers into a sustained, bloody battle against such
  interference. Fast-forward 32 years, through Premier League and Champions
  League dominance, international failures and successes, foreign talent and
  investment, profit and sustainability, splintering media landscapes, women’s
  football embodying national pride, much has changed and yet self-interest
  remains the darkest heart of English football.
