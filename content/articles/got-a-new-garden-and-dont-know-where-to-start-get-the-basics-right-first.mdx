webTitle: Got a new garden and don’t know where to start? Get the basics right first

  One of the questions I’m often asked when I speak at events usually comes from
  someone – perhaps half of a couple – who seems wide-eyed with optimism and
  overwhelm. “We’ve just moved into a new house and it has this garden,” they’ll
  begin. They don’t know what to do with it; where should they start?
  Invariably, I tell them to ignore the traditional advice of waiting for a year
  to see what comes up. Granted, you may dig up some ancient bulbs, like these
  grape hyacinths, but it’s your garden now and these risks are yours to take.
  The last place we moved to was a pretty blank canvas but I was rather more
  green in my own gardening experience. After nearly a decade of balcony
  gardening, I went wild on the plant catalogues and the prettier corners of
  Instagram, manically demanding Sarah Raven-level splendour from my newly
  carved bed of crap clay soil in south London. Perhaps this is a phase we all
  have to go through, but now I’m staring down on another blank slate of a
  garden. With nothing in it bar buddleia and a lone orange dahlia, which a
  friend accurately described as a “cellar spider” variety, making a bulb order
  feels vaguely fantastical. Instead, I want to get the fundamentals right. The
  fences are pretty shoddy. We don’t intend to move for some time, so we may as
  well invest in the boundaries now rather than having to replace them once the
  garden’s got going. Sorry, roof fund, I’m going to be biting the bullet and
  having some awkward conversations with the new neighbours. Next, I want to get
  my composting sorted. I’ve evolved from an Aerobin (ideal for speedier
  composting in small spaces) and I’m now hankering after a proper bay system.
  Good gardens come from decent soil, decent soil can be made from things that
  already exist – but infrastructure helps. Speaking of closed-loop systems, I
  intend to stash the bricks scattered liberally around the place and redeploy
  them for paving down the line. Failing that, I’ll have them crushed on site
  and folded into the inevitable substrate-based part of the garden that will
  emerge with time. I’ve loved growing in gravel, and this approach (similar to
  those used by brownfield gardeners John Little and Jo McKerr) feels the next
  logical step to take. Anything in a container came with me from the old plot,
  including some trees, which are sorely needed here. New plants, I trust, will
  arrive in time. But for now they feel like scatter cushions and paint colours:
  the stuff that gets thought about with time, looking and living – and
  hopefully generous hand-me-down cuttings.
