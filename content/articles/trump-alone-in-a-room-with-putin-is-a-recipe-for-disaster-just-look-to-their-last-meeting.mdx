  The lessons of Helsinki are clear: putting Donald Trump alone in a room with
  Vladimir Putin is an unpredictable – and often dangerous – affair. It was 2018
  when the two leaders met at the invitation of Sauli Niinistö, the Finnish
  president, to discuss a collapse in US-Russia relations, accusations of
  elections interference, and the grinding war in east Ukraine, among other
  topics. By the time he came out of the room, Trump looked dazzled by the
  Kremlin leader. Asked at a press conference about the conclusions of the US
  intelligence community that Russia had interfered in the elections, Trump
  said: “President Putin says it’s not Russia. I don’t see any reason why it
  would be.” Fiona Hill, Trump’s senior Kremlin adviser on the US national
  security council, later said that she had considered pulling a fire alarm or
  faking a medical emergency to end the press conference. Somehow, the stakes
  are even higher as Trump and Putin plan to meet on Friday in Anchorage,
  Alaska, where Trump has said the two will discuss “land swapping” in Putin’s
  first meeting with a G7 leader since his invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
  European leaders are fearful that Trump could once again emerge from a
  closed-door meeting preaching the Kremlin gospel. The White House has been
  lowering expectations for the summit – a sign that no concrete deal is on the
  table. “This is really a feel-out meeting, a little bit,” Trump said during a
  news conference on Monday. He said he would know within the first few minutes
  whether or not Putin was ready for a ceasefire and would pass that on to
  Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders. “I may say, ‘Lots of luck,
  keep fighting.’ Or I may say, ‘We can make a deal,’” he said. But Putin will
  still try his luck to shape Trump’s image of what a peace deal could entail in
  a way that will bring maximum benefit to the Kremlin. Putin “wants a deal with
  Trump that will be presented to Kyiv and other European capitals as a fait
  accompli,” wrote John Herbst, senior director of the Atlantic Council’s
  Eurasia Center and a former ambassador to Ukraine. The lack of invites for
  European leaders “has the smell of the Yalta Conference in 1945 … where the
  United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom decided the fate of
  half of Europe over the heads of those nations”. Europe and Ukraine have
  pushed back. Ahead of the summit, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine would not cede
  Russia territory that it could use to launch a new offensive, effectively
  ruling out Trump’s predictions that “there will be some [land] swapping”. The
  ad-hoc nature of Trump’s approach to foreign policy can play into the hands of
  the US’s foreign adversaries – but it has frustrated them too. Leaders such as
  Xi Jinping, the president of China, are said to prefer more advance work
  before getting into the room with Trump specifically because of his
  unpredictability. Russia too has become frustrated with the lack of process in
  the Trump administration. But that has not stopped Putin from taking his
  chances by stepping into the ring with Trump for their first one-on-one
  meeting of this administration. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press
  secretary, said on Tuesday that the meeting between Trump and Putin would be
  one-on-one, and a “listening exercise” for Trump during which he could suss
  out the Russian point of view. “That’s the way Trump does it. He just wings
  it,” said Hill, the former presidential aide. “And Putin likes sparring … he
  prides himself on being able to be light on his feet in these kinds of
  settings,” she said. The lack of advisers in the room has raised a key
  question: will any agreements made in a private setting, even if interpreters
  or other notetakers are present, lead to lasting outcomes? “It’s kind of like
  a meeting falling in the forest,” said Hill. A similar event took place during
  the Helsinki summit, when Trump exited the room and said that he had made an
  agreement with Putin for US law enforcement to have access to the GRU
  operatives accused of influencing the US elections. Putin later said in turn
  that he would have access to Americans responsible for pushing for the
  anti-corruption Magnitsky Act. “Of course, that went nowhere,” Hill said.
  “Trump hadn’t fully understood what Putin had said to him.” “In other words,
  [just because] there is a meeting doesn’t [mean it will] solidify into
  something,” she said.
