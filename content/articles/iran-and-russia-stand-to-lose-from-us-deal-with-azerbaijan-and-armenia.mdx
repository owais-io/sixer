  Iran expressed concern about foreign interference on Saturday, fearing it had
  been carved out of a declaration brokered by Donald Trump between Azerbaijan
  and Armenia. The two countries have come closer to ending 35 years of enmity
  by signing a peace treaty in Washington and agreeing to a US private
  consortium taking control of a strategic corridor on Iran’s border. The
  corridor passing through southern Armenia will link Azerbaijan with its
  exclave Nakhchivan, a longstanding demand of Baku. The US will operate the
  corridor under Armenian sovereignty on a 99-year land lease, changing the
  balance of power in the region. Some Iranian commentators claimed the deal
  amounts to “Iran’s geopolitical suffocation in the region”. Control of the
  corridor that runs along the border between Armenia and northern Iran has been
  the single biggest block to a peace deal between the two countries. The deal
  is also a further blow to Russia’s diminished influence in the region, as
  Armenia’s prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, guides his Christian-majority
  country towards the west, and eventually the EU. Russia – which still has a
  military base in Armenia – seems unable to resist the Trump initiative, partly
  due to its preoccupation with Ukraine. In a statement on Saturday the Iranian
  foreign ministry said: “Establishing communication networks will serve the
  security, and economic development of the nations of the region when it is
  done within the framework of mutual interests, respecting the national
  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the countries of the region, and
  without foreign interference”. Abbas Mousavi, former Iranian ambassador to
  Baku and a deputy presidential spokesperson, described Trump’s direct
  involvement in the issue of relations between Azerbaijan and Armenia as
  “interesting, offensive and dangerous”. But there is little Iran can do to
  block a deal that the US, Armenia and Azerbaijan see as in their mutual
  interest. Armenia and Azerbaijan have been in conflict since the late 1980s
  when Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous Azerbaijani region mostly populated by
  ethnic Armenians, broke away from Azerbaijan with support from Armenia.
  Azerbaijan, the superior military power which is largely run as an
  authoritarian dictatorship, wrested back full control of the region in 2023 by
  force, prompting almost all of the territory’s 120,000 ethnic Armenians to
  flee to Armenia. In the most novel part of the deal, an – as yet unformed – US
  consortium will take control of a 20-mile-long transit corridor connecting
  Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave. It will be named the “Trump Route for
  International Peace and Prosperity”. The proposal, first discussed during the
  Biden administration, raises the prospect of a US presence right on the
  Iranian border. Tehran worries such a development might cut off its access to
  the Black Sea as well as to Europe via Georgia. A further opening of the
  border with Turkey would integrate Armenia into the Middle Corridor project,
  an economic trade route between Europe and China that bypasses Russia and
  Iran. Armenian leaders have long seen economic benefits in this project for
  their landlocked country. The White House said the new transport corridor
  would “enable unhindered connectivity between the two countries, while
  respecting the sovereignty, territorial integrity and people of Armenia”. The
  route is billed to include roads, railways, oil and gas pipelines and
  fibre-optic lines. A US commercial presence lowers the incentive for either
  side to resort to military solutions. As part of the Washington accord, the
  two sides have also agreed to end other border disputes, but Azerbaijan’s
  president, Ilham Aliyev, stressed in press briefings that a final agreement
  required the Armenian constitution to be amended to eliminate “baseless
  territorial claims” against Azerbaijan, adding to not do so would be seen as
  “an act of disrespect” by the US. Armenia is expected to hold a referendum on
  the constitution in 2027, but the more Aliyev highlights his demand, the more
  hostility will grow inside Armenia. But Aliyev, and his ally Turkey, gain
  greatly from the agreement so may not look for obstacles. As part of the
  agreement, for instance, restrictions on military cooperation between
  Azerbaijan and the US can be lifted. Aliyev said: “We have pre-signed the
  Peace Agreement, which has been negotiated for a long time, and the fact that
  it is pre-signed in the capital of the No 1 superpower, in the world’s No 1
  office, and in the presence of the great president of the USA, means that
  there should be no doubt that any of the parties will make a step back.” He
  also called for Trump to be awarded the Nobel peace prize.
