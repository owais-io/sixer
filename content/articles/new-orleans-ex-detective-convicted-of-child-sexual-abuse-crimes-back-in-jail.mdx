  A former child sexual abuse crimes detective who for years has been
  incarcerated on and off after admitting that he molested minors during his
  Louisiana policing career – and has been investigated as a possible serial
  killer – is back behind bars again. Stanley Burkhardt, 74, was jailed in New
  Orleans on 15 July on allegations that he illegally used social media in 2019
  to leave suggestive comments under young men’s pictures, according to court
  records reviewed by WWL Louisiana reporting partner the Guardian on Tuesday.
  Those charges essentially stem from a case that was left unresolved when he
  underwent intensive therapy in a federal prison in North Carolina for people
  legally considered sexually dangerous, a course from which he was released
  with conditions in August 2024. In May, state prosecutors in New Orleans filed
  a document known as a bill of information that basically reinitiated the
  unsettled case from roughly six years earlier, setting the stage for his
  latest return to custody. Burkhardt had been working as a clerk at a Robért
  Fresh Market store in New Orleans. He is no longer employed there after being
  jailed again and is temporarily being held without bond, court records show.
  Wearing an orange jumpsuit and shackles, he appeared in New Orleans criminal
  court on Tuesday. The judge presiding over his case, Rhonda Goode-Douglas, is
  tentatively scheduled to consider setting a bond for him on 19 August. His
  attorney, public defender Tessa Silverman, declined comment. Burkhardt once
  enjoyed a reputation as a crusading police officer who built cases against
  child abusers in the 1970s and 1980s. Yet his career ended in disgrace and
  temporary imprisonment after he was convicted of mailing child abuse imagery
  to undercover agents. He later admitted again peddling child abuse imagery –
  and he separately pleaded guilty to sexually molesting a nine-year-old girl to
  whom he was related by marriage. Federal prosecutors sought to keep Burkhardt
  in prison for as long as possible by availing themselves of a law affording
  involuntary, lifelong commitments for people determined to be “sexually
  dangerous”. One federal judge found Burkhardt met that definition in 2011 and
  sent him to a specialized prison in Butner, North Carolina. But after four
  years of treatment, another judge, James Dever, effectively granted Burkhardt
  a conditional parole. Louisiana state police alleged in 2019 that Burkhardt
  violated that parole by failing to gain permission to use an email address and
  username that he made for himself to suggestively comment under young people’s
  photos on a picture-sharing platform. His password for that account allegedly
  was “boyz4me!”, and he purportedly communicated with email addresses
  containing the prefixes “boys6to12” and “lovelyyoungpp”. State police troopers
  also contended that Burkhardt had violated his parole conditions by removing a
  stamp from his driver’s license that identified him as a convicted sex
  offender when he applied for a job with a New Orleans casino. Prosecutors
  dismissed that particular case after Burkhardt was ordered back to Butner for
  another round of treatment. That stint ended on 9 April 2024, when he was sent
  to a New Orleans halfway house. He was released from that facility on 14
  August on the condition that he obey dozens of restrictions to avoid
  reincarceration, including coming within 100ft of places primarily frequented
  by children or using websites that promote casual sexual encounters. Media
  reports and an investigative podcast titled New Orleans Unsolved have explored
  links between Burkhardt, the drowning death of a teen that he has been
  publicly accused of claiming responsibility for, the strangulation murders of
  three teenagers with ties to the city, and a case centering on the sexually
  abusive leaders of a Boy Scout troop that produced numerous criminal
  convictions. Burkhardt, while being questioned in court after the initial
  filing of the 2019 charges, denied committing murder. State police
  investigators who took a fresh look at the deaths of the teens in Burkhardt’s
  orbit at one point testified under oath that Burkhardt was not considered a
  murder suspect. The podcast caught Burkhardt’s attention, according to host
  Anna Christie in an episode released in early January. After his 2024 release
  from Butner, Christie recounted how videos related to two particular New
  Orleans Unsolved episodes were liked by an account named after obscure details
  that would only be meaningful to Burkhardt. She said she asked the account if
  the user was trying to get in touch with her. “Thinking and praying about it,”
  the user replied. Christie said her former podcast co-host, New Orleans
  broadcast journalist Thanh Truong, later called her and – almost in disbelief
  – told her that he had just encountered Burkhardt at church. According to her,
  Truong recalled Burkhardt telling him that he was trying to reach out to
  Christie. Christie subsequently messaged the account she concluded belonged to
  Burkhardt and offered to meet him at a public place, Christie said on the
  show. Christie described how Burkhardt thanked her but was “still in prayer
  regarding conversation with” her. Burkhardt had not reached back out by the
  time of the episode’s release, said Christie, who questioned whether the
  creation of the account with which he was communicating with her complied with
  his parole. A copy of the conditions governing Burkhardt’s August 2024 release
  from Butner says he must not “create or use any electronic communications
  service accounts used for user communications, dissemination and/or storage of
  digital media files … unless previously approved” by officers supervising him.
  “This includes but is not limited to email accounts, social media accounts and
  cloud storage accounts,” the conditions say. After his arrest in mid-July,
  Burkhardt faces one charge of improper use or access of social media by a sex
  offender and two of failing to provide information required of such offenders.
  He has pleaded not guilty to the charges, each of which in many cases could
  carry up to 10 years in prison under Louisiana law.
