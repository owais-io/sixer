  ‘Even Puerto Rico paid its bill’: Thames Water creditor suggests backers are

  The largest creditor to struggling water company Thames Water has said it is
  confident that it will not lose money, joking that the UK was comparable to
  Puerto Rico, which paid lenders to its water company despite a crippling debt
  crisis. Dominic Frederico, the chief executive of US insurer Assured Guaranty,
  suggested that the UK government would not impose losses on creditors. The
  company – which has an exposure of $2.4bn (£1.8bn) to Thames Water’s bonds –
  was “well protected in terms of the legal structure” from losing money, he
  told investors on a call on 8 August. “The joke I make internally, and I’ll
  put it out here over some criticism, is that even in Puerto Rico’s case, they
  paid the water bill,” he said. “So I’m assuming the UK government will do the
  same.” Puerto Rico, a US territory, went through the biggest municipal default
  in modern history, beginning in 2014. However, its water company debts were
  not hit, preserving returns for investors. The comments underline the scale of
  Thames Water’s crisis, as well as the expectation of some its senior creditors
  that they will not lose their money. Thames Water has been under the effective
  control of its senior creditors, which hold the bulk of its £17.7bn debt pile
  since shareholders walked away from the company last year. The creditors have
  proposed a £5.3bn injection of equity and debt to take formal control of
  Thames Water and try to turn it around. However, the creditors insist that no
  recovery is possible without leniency on pollution fines from Ofwat, the water
  regulator for England and Wales. That proposal is deeply controversial and has
  led to a standoff, with the environment secretary, Steve Reed, insisting that
  Thames Water must continue to meet the same environmental standards as rivals.
  The government has faced calls for it to place Thames Water into special
  administration, effectively a temporary nationalisation that would probably
  impose significant losses on creditors. However, Assured Guaranty has said
  that it is confident it will not lose money, and that Thames Water will stay
  out of government control. Frederico said that he was “very comfortable” that
  the creditor plan would be approved. Assured Guaranty’s exposure to UK water
  companies has risen to more than $16bn in June, up from $10.6bn in March 2022,
  according to quarterly filings. Its biggest exposure was $2.8bn on Southern
  Water, another British water company that has faced financial difficulties.
  The insurer has said that it feels “pretty good” about its exposure to
  Britain’s privatised water companies. Its chief financial officer, Benjamin
  Rosenblum, said in February: “The UK government has stated that they really
  don’t plan to nationalise the water utilities and frankly, they don’t really
  seem to have the room in their budget to do so, and they would like to see
  additional investment. So I think the macroeconomic background for the UK
  water sector looks pretty good.” Dieter Helm, an Oxford University professor
  who has advised previous Labour and Conservative governments on energy and
  water policy, said this week that the creditor offer was “a plan designed to
  protect their debt” and that it did not appear to address Thames Water’s
  long-term problems. Helm said that “Thames is, in principle, a very viable
  asset” because of rising bills that guarantee revenues but added that
  creditors are not likely to back debt write-offs that would impose losses on
  themselves. Several of the creditors bought the debt at a discount from the
  original lenders, meaning they could still make large profits even with a
  large cut in the amount Thames owes. A Thames Water spokesperson said: “A
  special administration regime doesn’t fix Thames Water’s problems. It will
  delay the delivery of improvement for our customers and the environment. It
  will be disruptive, add risk and uncertainty, increase costs, hinder our
  operational turnaround, destabilise our stakeholders and colleagues, and will
  not fix the balance sheet. “A market-led recapitalisation is the quickest and
  most effective route to financial stability, sustainable investment and better
  outcomes for customers and the environment.” Assured Guaranty and the Thames
  Water senior creditor group were approached for comment.
