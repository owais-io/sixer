  integrate’

  “You don’t call it Opel, you call it Vauxhall,” says Will Still. “A Corsa,
  little black thing that eventually died. Actually, no, Nico, my younger
  brother crashed it … it was crap, though, it didn’t even have a radio.” Still,
  who grew up in Grez-Doiceau, near Brussels, laughs as he recounts his days
  driving to work as an unpaid video analyst at Sint-Truiden while living at
  home with his mother, Jane. “Best time of my life, to be honest. It was like
  the dream was coming true.” Twelve years on, the 32-year-old, one of the most
  intriguing managers in the game, has been tasked with returning Southampton to
  the Premier League after impressing with Lens. The only other time he lived in
  England was as a teenager when he spent two years studying at Myerscough
  College in Lancashire, where his degree included coaching Preston’s under-14s.
  At the time Still felt like “the little posh Belgian kid” but that period
  provided a handy lesson in English football-speak. “I remember getting to
  college and people were like: ‘Bounce it!’ I haven’t got a clue what that
  means, mate, sorry. Or ‘man on’. By the end, I was like: ‘God, English
  football is the place to be.’ We were playing Stockport reserves and people
  turned up to watch that game – a lot of people. It was like: ‘Why are you
  coming to watch a bunch of college players playing Stockport reserves?’” Still
  spoke English at home and French at school but had to get to grips with Dutch
  after joining Sint-Truiden’s academy aged 10. He recalls telling his father,
  Julian, that his teammates did not understand him. “Growing up in Belgium, not
  many people are ginger and speak English. I’ve always stuck out. Like a sore
  thumb. I think football’s always helped me integrate and be a part of
  something. And it just became like the one thing that I was actually quite
  good at.” Still, talking in the boardroom at Southampton’s New Forest training
  base, makes absorbing company as he trawls through his journey, including
  coaching Hugo Ekitiké at Reims and shadowing Thomas Frank during his pro
  licence; enrolling meant the Ligue 1 club were no longer fined £22,000 every
  time he took charge of a game, a viral story that meant his profile exploded.
  “The world the way it is, people just expect it [success] to happen,” he says,
  clicking his fingers. “And it’s like: ‘Oh, social media told us that you can
  do it.’” There is another myth to dispel. It wasn’t just a case of Still
  tapping the spacebar of his laptop playing Football Manager and landing in
  Ligue 1; at 30, he became the youngest manager in Europe’s top five leagues
  when appointed at Reims, having managed Lierse and then Beerschot in Belgium,
  taking the reins at the former aged 24. Still’s grounding also led to an easy
  tag. “They called us laptop managers in France,” he says. Still enjoyed
  playing the video game – he was trying to win the Belgian second division with
  Sint-Truiden while working for the club – but it hardly propelled him into
  frontline management. He acknowledges, though, that Football Manager had its
  uses. “When you’re working at clubs in Belgium that have no budget, everyone
  looks at it [as a data and information tool]. Transfermarkt [football website]
  … everyone looks at it. Everyone looks at Fifa [video game] ratings. I’d be
  stupid not to at least look at it because it’s there. But it didn’t form my
  perspective or make me understand tactics better because, you know what
  Football Manager is like, you can play any system in the world and tweak it
  slightly and win the Champions League with Rochdale. I’m just a normal person.
  If I go on my summer holidays, I’ll sit down and probably play Football
  Manager.” Still will not have the luxury of saving the game in advance of
  kick-off in case things go wrong against Wrexham, a team energised after three
  promotions on the spin, on Saturday. “Exactly,” he says. “We need to get back
  to the Premier League. We want to do it this year. I’ve been told if it’s not
  this year, then it probably has to be next year. But I want to be competitive,
  I want to be challenging myself, people around me … I was looking at footage
  last week of when Poch was here,” he says, puffing his cheeks and recalling
  Mauricio Pochettino’s spell, “and that was a seriously good Southampton team.
  And there is potential to do that again, to build something not just this year
  but over the next two or three years.” What led Still to relive that period
  under Pochettino? “[To see] what Saints fans want to see, what got them
  excited, what style of football, what brand of player as well.” He bumped into
  Pochettino in Girona during pre-season when Southampton played Espanyol,
  another of the Argentinian’s former clubs. Pochettino, now the US national
  team manager, wished Still good luck and the pair discussed Damion Downs, the
  US striker Southampton signed from Cologne this summer. Pochettino was in the
  opposing dugout when Still took charge of his first top-flight game, a 0-0
  draw against PSG with Reims. “They were playing Mbappé, Messi, Neymar – all
  that lot – and you think: ‘I hope they stay calm for this one.’” There was an
  emotional pull to return to England. Last year his partner, the Sky Sports
  broadcaster Emma Saunders, was seriously ill, first with thyroid cancer then
  encephalitis. “I was going to games and travelling back and forth and
  thinking: ‘I shouldn’t be standing on this training pitch. I don’t even know
  why I’m here.’ I needed to be closer to home and, ultimately, Emma is home. I
  just tried to do my best and, honestly, finishing eighth in Ligue 1 last
  season, having sold all the players we did, was one of my proudest
  achievements and doing it with my brothers was pretty special.” It was a
  rewarding but draining season. “I won’t miss the Eurostar, as good as their
  service is.” Still asked Ed and Nicolas, his older and younger brothers
  respectively, to follow him to Southampton but personal reasons meant the
  timing was tricky. He sounded out Marshall Munetsi, the Wolves midfielder with
  whom he worked at Reims, to get his take on St Mary’s. Still has coached
  several Premier League stars including Abdukodir Khusanov and Kevin Danso at
  Lens, but none more high profile than Ekitiké, Liverpool’s £79m summer
  signing. “I think going to PSG [in 2022-23] actually helped him massively …
  because he was a star in Reims, but he wasn’t a star in PSG. And he grew up,
  he was a boy and turned into a teenager and then turned into a sort of young
  adult. He’s so sharp; he sees the goal when no one else sees it.” For all
  parties, it is a fresh start but Still acknowledges there is unlikely to be
  much letup in a division famous for its punishing schedule. So, how does he
  switch off? “This is the one thing that the French never understood: watching
  cricket,” he says, smiling. Still bowled for Belgium’s under-16s, for whom Ed
  also played – “I mean, we were all expats” – and, detailing summer trips to
  Lord’s and Trent Bridge, tells how the sport takes him to a different place.
  “We played Gillingham and Valenciennes [in pre-season] and on the Sunday we
  had a day off and it was like: ‘Em, shall we go and watch some village
  cricket?’ So we packed some food, sat on a bench and watched village cricket,
  up in St Albans. It was crap … but that’s one thing I’ve discovered does
  actually stop the brain thinking too much. I love cricket, even watching it on
  TV. But cricket only goes on until about September, so then I’m struggling a
  bit.”
