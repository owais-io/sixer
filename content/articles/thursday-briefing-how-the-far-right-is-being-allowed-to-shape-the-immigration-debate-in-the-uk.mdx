  Good morning. Just how many migrants in the UK are undocumented? Tabloid
  headlines can make it seem like the number is huge, so perhaps a new YouGov
  poll suggesting a significant gap between public perception and reality should
  be no surprise. Nearly half of Britons (47%) believe there are more
  undocumented migrants living in the UK than those here legally. Meanwhile, 45%
  of respondents said they support stopping all immigration and carrying out
  deportations of people who have arrived in recent years. Tensions are playing
  out on the streets, with protests outside hotels housing asylum seekers
  attracting national attention, including in Epping, Essex, where hundreds of
  people gathered over several weekends after the arrest of a resident on
  suspicion of sexual assault. More protests are expected over the next few
  days. Adding to the pressure, police are also preparing for possible protests
  in support of Palestine Action over the weekend, despite the group’s recent
  proscription as a terrorist organisation. Officers have warned that anyone
  carrying placards or banners expressing support could face arrest and
  incarceration in our already overcrowded prisons. So who is behind the
  anti-immigration protests, and what’s driving them? And could this weekend
  become a flashpoint? To explore this further, I spoke to the Guardian’s senior
  reporter Ben Quinn, who has spent years reporting on the far right. Five big
  stories US immigration | A new report found hundreds of credible reported
  cases of human rights abuses in US immigration detention centres. The alleged
  abuses uncovered include physical and sexual abuse of detainees. Protest |
  Naomi Klein and Angela Davis are among dozens of international scholars and
  writers who have signed a letter to the Guardian calling on the UK government
  to reverse the ban on Palestine Action. Russia | Vladimir Putin and Donald
  Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff have held talks in Moscow, two days before a
  Friday deadline the US president set for Russia to reach a peace deal in the
  Ukraine war. Spain | A local authority in south-east Spain has banned Muslims
  from using public facilities such as civic centres and gyms to celebrate the
  religious festivals Eid. The ban in Jumilla, in Murcia, is a first in Spain.
  UK news | The Bank of England is poised to cut interest rates on Thursday
  despite a growing divide between its policymakers over the dangers to the
  economy from high inflation and rising unemployment. In depth: It’s not just a
  far-right problem Estimates of the population of undocumented migrants living
  in the UK range from 120,000 to 1.3 million, with Reform UK’s Zia Yusuf
  recently putting the figure at 1.2 million. Regardless, that number doesn’t
  come close to those living in the UK legally: the 2021-22 census (pdf) put the
  entire foreign-born population of the UK at 10.7 million. But lies travel fast
  on social media – especially if they chime with existing worries or prejudice.
  The news last year that three girls attending a dance class in Southport were
  stabbed to death sent out shockwaves. As the local community gathered to
  mourn, a piece of disinformation – that the attacker had come to the UK on a
  small boat – quickly spread on social media. That sparked protests, which were
  very quickly exploited by far-right activists. The protests exploded, with
  anti-migrant rioters attacking mosques, setting fire to asylum hotels, and
  assaulting black and minority ethnic people. It’s been a year since, but the
  anger has not dissipated. Instead, it is slowly hardening into a movement.
  Anti-immigration protests have taken place across the country and while most
  have remained peaceful, some have not. The BBC reported that 15 people across
  the country have been arrested in recent days while protesting outside hotels
  used to house asylum seekers. “We’re in what Joe Mulhall of Hope Not Hate
  calls the ‘post-organisational era’ of the far right,” says Ben. “It’s not
  about formal parties and memberships. It’s about individuals loosely linked
  via social media, people who might never meet in person but have significant
  influence, especially on platforms like X. That all feeds into gatherings and
  protests, which then spill over into violence, as we saw after Southport.” He
  added that protests outside asylum hotels have always happened. The Bell Hotel
  in Epping, which has seen recent large scale protests, has actually been
  targeted since 2021. But these protests, once considered fringe events, are
  becoming a fixture. “If you place Reform UK as a hard-right populist party,
  the groups we’re seeing at the protest sit further to the right,” Ben told me.
  “For a while, Patriotic Alternative was the main far-right group, but it’s in
  decline now, as a result of infighting. A newer group, Homeland Party, was set
  up by former far-right members and has drawn people away from Patriotic
  Alternative.” But he warned that we have to be careful when discussing who is
  involved. “They are clearly organised far-right activists who are attempting
  to exploit local grievances and are using misinformation to whip up feelings,
  but in some cases, such as Epping, the protests have included local people who
  are unaffiliated with organised far-right groups. There is a grey area which
  is difficult to determine in some cases.” He added that the big shadow over
  all of this is Tommy Robinson. “He’s the epitome of that post-organisational
  far right. He’s an influencer and clearly an activist, and he’s got a universe
  of people around him, who in many cases include football hooligans.” Robinson
  tried to amplify protests in Islington and Canary Wharf, targeting hotels
  thought to house asylum seekers, Ben explained. There are also other figures
  forming a constellation of newer far-right influencers who have attached
  themselves to this. *** Are all the protesters far-right agitators? While
  notable far-right figures have been spotted speaking at the protests, Ben has
  spoken to many who wouldn’t align themselves with those groups, but are still
  frustrated with the country’s asylum policies. “It’s really important to not
  discount the fact that people in these communities have agency of their own to
  go and protest and they can feel very strongly about things. They have views
  on the asylum system, they have views on events in the news,” Ben said. “There
  is a debate to be had, and many media organisations will be having it, about
  how these protests should be described. I spoke to a local woman in Essex who
  said ‘we’re turning up here because a teenager was allegedly sexually
  assaulted by a man who was in this hostel. We want to turn up and show we’re
  not happy with this’. Are they far right purely for taking part in that
  protest? They would say of course not. But should they turn away from a
  protest when it becomes clear that it is being hijacked by neo-Nazis and
  far-right groups? Some would say, yes, they should.” *** Will this weekend be
  a flashpoint? There is widespread reporting of a “no asylum day of action”
  today, but Ben believes it is not clear whether it’s a real national action or
  a meme that has taken on a life of its own. He pointed to an incident last
  year where someone published a list of immigration advice centres across the
  country, but the protests didn’t materialise. There is some evidence to show
  that momentum around some of these protests is beginning to slow down. “It
  feels like the heat has come out of Epping a little bit. At the last protest,
  anti-racism activists and trade unionists outnumbered the protest against that
  hotel. And that was a place far-right activists had very clearly wanted to
  turn it into pilgrimage every weekend. But now it seems that perhaps the focus
  has shifted. It might be because lots of local people were turned off by the
  violence which erupted on the sidelines of those protests. But the problem is,
  we now have lots of others elsewhere,” Ben said. There is now widespread
  attention in Nuneaton because of another alleged sexual assault case there,
  involving a 12-year-old alleged victim. Reform council leader George Finch
  made comments that may be in contempt of court and have inflamed tensions, Ben
  said. Protests are planned at the council HQ. Other hotspots include Cannock
  and Waterlooville, which recently saw a thousand people protesting, he added.
  “In places like London and Essex, anti-racist activists can mobilise very
  quickly in large numbers and also draw some local support and outnumber the
  far right. But you also have other places where there are large groups of
  local people who are unattached with the far right, gathering in large numbers
  and then you have the far right exploiting them.” *** How has the government
  responded? There has been a notable difference in the government’s response to
  this year’s protests outside asylum hotels. “After Southport, Keir Starmer
  called them ‘far-right riots’. He hasn’t done that this time, even though the
  far right is heavily involved. Labour seems worried about alienating voters on
  immigration,” Ben said. He added that many are also critical of Starmer and
  Yvette Cooper for failing to condemn the racist language heard at some of
  these protests. And the possibility of further national riots loom. “There’s
  potential,” said Ben, “because we’re in August. The weather’s hot and rain is
  always one of the things that keeps people off the street. You have
  misinformation, the far right and others colonising local Facebook groups,
  with Nigel Farage and Reform amplifying many of the messages from the
  protests. “And then you have a stretched police force as well” – stretched not
  only by anti-migrant protests, but by a wave of demonstrations this weekend,
  with hundreds expected to defy terrorism legislation to rally in support of
  Palestine Action. The two protests will paint a stark picture of modern
  Britain. On one side, police in soft caps are expected to make mass arrests,
  mostly of elderly people or students, with little anticipation of violence. On
  the other, riot vans and officers in full gear will line the streets at
  anti-migrant demonstrations, prepared for the possibility that unrest could
  erupt once again. What else we’ve been reading As many as 80,000 people in
  Hiroshima were killed instantly when the US dropped the first nuclear bomb
  this week in August 1945. A year later, John Hersey published an astonishingly
  accomplished and shocking account of life for six survivors in the immediate
  aftermath. In these dark times, it is vital, devastating reading – as are
  Justin McCurry’s conversations with survivors (above) today. Craille Maguire
  Gillies, newsletters team This jaw dropping joint investigation by the
  Guardian’s Harry Davies and +972 Magazine’s Yuval Abraham reveals how the
  Israeli military stored a giant trove of Palestinians’ phone calls on
  Microsoft’s servers in Europe. Aamna Ian Sample sorts fact from social media
  fiction to look at whether sunscreen is toxic and how it actually works.
  Craille Sense and Sensibility returns to UK cinemas three decades after it
  first premiered. I loved this review by the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw and I
  will definitely be catching it on the big screen. Aamna I enjoyed Jason
  Okundaye’s account of his first trip to the Caribbean, for The Long Wave (sign
  up here). He gleaned a “thrilling education in its heritage and history” – and
  made time for some fun, admitting the Foreday Morning Jam in Bridgetown,
  Barbados, “completely unravelled me”. Craille Sport Football | News that the
  former Arsenal midfielder Thomas Partey, who appeared in a London court on
  Tuesday charged with rape and sexual assault, is poised to join Villarreal has
  upset fans, with hundreds signing a petition urging a halt to a deal. Football
  | Everton have completed the signing of midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall from
  Chelsea for a fee that could rise to £28m. Cricket | An unnamed former county
  cricket coach has been suspended from the sport for nine months after
  admitting charges of sexual misconduct. The independent cricket discipline
  panel has declined to identify the individual due to a “serious risk of harm”
  if his name were made public. The front pages The Guardian print edition leads
  with “Leading academics call on UK to reverse ban on Palestine Action”. The
  Times has “Wealthier areas face big rises in council tax” while the Telegraph
  says “Starmer’s pledge on tax thrown into chaos” (by the black hole). The
  Express claims “Labour’s tax war is harming economy”, citing poll results.
  “I’m a doctor, get me out of here!” – the Metro reports one in five want to
  emigrate. The i paper runs with “Labour’s minister for homelessness ejects her
  tenants – and hikes rent”. The Financial Times hauls on an oft-tolled alarm
  bell: “Company directors’ exodus gathering pace after non-dom tax breaks
  halted”. The Daily Mail brings us “HMRC staff hold class on ‘guilt of being
  British’” and adds that “Kemi” is against it. “Cosmetic cowboys crackdown” –
  dodgy surgery will be stamped out after a “Mirror campaign” says that paper.
  Today in Focus Has the digital nomad dream turned sour? Alex Holder loves her
  new life in Lisbon but has become increasingly uneasy that people like her
  might be damaging the cities they love. Cartoon of the day | Martin Rowson The
  Upside A bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all bad Last
  week, the award-winning environmental journalist Alec Luhn set out on a
  four-day solo walk in Norway’s remote Folgefonna national park, home to one of
  the world’s biggest glaciers. On Monday, Luhn, a seasoned mountain walker, was
  reported missing after he didn’t turn up for his flight home to the UK. A
  volunteer search and rescue team from the Red Cross, police, dogs and drones
  searched throughout Monday for Luhn but were hampered by poor weather. The
  search continued and on Wednesday, Luhn – a Pulitzer Center fellow – was found
  alive after surviving almost a week with a seriously injured leg. “I can’t
  remember us finding someone alive after so many days,” said Stig Hope, head of
  the operations leadership team at Folgefonna and a Red Cross volunteer. Luhn’s
  sister, Drew Gaddis, thanked the many rescuers involved in finding him: “We
  can breathe again!” Sign up here for a weekly roundup of The Upside, sent to
