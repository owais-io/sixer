  If Richard Curtis had shot his romcom classic Notting Hill over the past
  month, things might have turned out very differently. Julia Roberts would have
  had to stumble past huge concrete blocks while losing the hand of her British
  sweetheart and Hugh Grant might have missed his departing lover as he
  struggled to exit the area in an overstuffed Peugeot 406. This is because of
  new rules that ban all cars from Portobello Road between 10am and 4pm, where
  much of the 1999 film was shot. In some sections of the famed street market
  the restrictions cover the whole week, while in others only three days. To
  enforce the new rules, large grey concrete slabs and garish red barriers have
  been placed along the street. Amid the bustle of Portobello Road market on
  Friday afternoon, tourists were lining up outside Will Thacker’s famed blue
  door to have their picture taken. “It feels like I’m watching the movie
  again,” said Ella, 14, a fan of the hit romantic comedy. Metres away from the
  door, which was replaced after being sold at auction for £5,750 in 1999, sat
  the concrete blocks and imposing barriers. If Notting Hill were filmed today,
  the visible restrictions “would take away” from the movie, said Ella’s mother,
  Katie Alasky. The barriers and travel restrictions were put in place on the
  advice of counter-terror police who have warned of the potential threat of
  vehicle attacks. The 44-year-old lawyer, who was visiting London from New
  Orleans, said: “We love it here, it’s a great atmosphere with all of the
  stands and the unique things, minus the barriers. It’s so unfortunate – seeing
  them is a sign of how we live now.” James Darcy, 33, who works in
  construction, has seen Notting Hill about “20 times”. He was visiting the blue
  door from Melbourne, Australia. “If filmed today, it probably wouldn’t be the
  same, that’s for sure.” While he acknowledged the new restrictions had been
  imposed for everybody’s safety, he said they detracted “from the historic and
  vintage vibe”. While some regard the roadblocks as an eyesore, there have been
  practical and financial consequences for market traders. Some have struggled
  to restock their stalls as vehicles are not allowed behind the barriers before
  4pm. Charlotte Preval-Reed, 47, sells prints that promote “positive thoughts”.
  “If Notting Hill was filmed here today, I think it would look a bit sad,” she
  said. Preval-Reed said business had been significantly affected by the
  measures and that footfall had plummeted since they had been erected. She said
  it had been “100% the worst” period of trading since Covid. “If it carries on,
  I could potentially not be able to run my business at all because it just
  wouldn’t be worth it in terms of how much of an income loss I’ve suffered,”
  she said. Local residents have also been affected. “I’m not a designer but I’m
  sure I could design something better than that,” said Patrick Somers, 65, a
  former lawyer who lives in a side-road behind the market. Somers said people
  had only found out about the restrictions a few days before they had been
  implemented on 1 July. He is now leading a legal challenge, with the help of
  the law firm Broadfield, on behalf of residents and traders against Kensington
  and Chelsea council, who enacted the changes. “They have not thought this
  through. We’ve got all sorts of unintended consequences here,” said Somers. He
  feared the curtailed access could pose a danger in an emergency situation. “My
  wife’s mother was very ill and unfortunately died in April. We had a call that
  she was getting to that end-of-life stage in the middle of the afternoon.” If
  the barriers had been in place at the time, they would not have been able to
  drive out of his road, Somers said. Recently, an ambulance had been unable to
  get past barriers to attend to a child who was having respiratory problems,
  Somers said. “The ambulance arrived but couldn’t get in.” They parked farther
  away and had to carry “huge backpacks” with them, but “didn’t have the right
  equipment so had to go all the way back again”. Somers said the child was fine
  in the end but “might not have been”. He said: “We can’t be having a situation
  where there’s not easy access for an emergency vehicle.” The council said
  emergency services had been consulted about the scheme and maintained they
  were able to access the road. Somers conceded that the area did need
  anti-terror measures, as long as they were introduced in the right way. “There
  should be bollards but they’ve done it in the wrong way. We’ve seen them being
  implemented and managed really effectively in other parts of London.” While
  the concrete slabs are meant to be a security deterrent, many tourists are
  using them for something else. “They’re great for sitting,” said Anna Twigg,
  39, an artist who was visiting London from Oban, Scotland, with her mother,
  Dolina, 65, a former social worker. The two women agreed there should be some
  form of barrier to act as an anti-terror measure, but thought there was room
  for improvement. “They could be a wee bit more attractive,” said Dolina. A
  Kensington and Chelsea council spokesperson said: “Our top priority remains
  the safety and wellbeing of everyone in the community and we believe the
  current measures strike a reasonable balance between protecting the public and
  supporting the needs of individuals. “We continue to speak with residents and
  businesses, addressing concerns case by case to help inform proposals for a
  permanent scheme.”
