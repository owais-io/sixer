  overcharging

  Britain’s biggest bailiff company overcharged people it was pursuing for
  unpaid debts and has been forced to launch a refunds programme, the Guardian
  can reveal. Marston Holdings, which is used by companies and state-funded
  bodies including Transport for London to recover debts and fines, has
  apologised to consumers after overcharging “enforcement fees” related to
  unpaid road traffic penalties it was chasing. The body that oversees the
  bailiff sector in England and Wales said the company’s behaviour was
  “unacceptable” and had breached regulations designed to protect the public
  from overcharging. In England and Wales, when a bailiff – or “enforcement
  agent” – visits someone’s home, a fixed fee of £235 is added to the debt.
  Sources said thousands of individuals may have been overcharged after the
  company added multiple enforcement fees to their debts. Marston did not say
  how many people may be affected but said fewer than 0.3% of its debtor
  caseload have been affected. Minutes of a trade body meeting last month – seen
  by the Guardian – stated that Marston was alerted to this issue in April, and
  that an investigation by an industry oversight body “revealed breaches in
  multiple cases where more than one [£235] enforcement fee had been charged
  instead of the cases being linked under one fee”. Marston said “the [systems]
  issue has been fixed” and refund cheques had been sent to “all of those
  affected”. However, the minutes from last month’s meeting said Marston had
  initiated a review of seven years’ worth of cases, and the company was
  committed to rectifying the errors via a full refunds scheme, with a dedicated
  call centre, that would operate for three years. Marston works with dozens of
  local authorities as well as official bodies including TfL, HM Courts &amp;
  Tribunals Service (HMCTS) and Highways England (now National Highways). It
  boasts of recovering “over £850m each year on behalf of the taxpayer” and also
  works for private companies. TfL said Marston “are not carrying out any
  enforcement work for us at the moment. Their contract is under review.” The UK
  bailiff sector is big business: every year, millions of people are on the
  receiving end of enforcement action, with data showing there were 8m cases in
  2024, with a total value of £5.2bn. In 2023 the Guardian reported that the
  profits of leading bailiff firms had seen risen to record levels during the
  cost of living crisis. It is estimated that well over half of the cases where
  bailiffs are called in involve unpaid road traffic and parking fines and
  penalties, including congestion charges and penalties relating to Ulez
  (ultra-low emission zone) and driving in a bus lane. Chris Nichols, chief
  executive of the Enforcement Conduct Board (ECB), the independent oversight
  body for the bailiff sector in England and Wales, said: “It is very concerning
  to see breaches of regulations that are there to protect the public from
  overcharging. “This is unacceptable behaviour, and the ECB is taking strong
  action to ensure that people who have been impacted are found and refunded,
  and that this behaviour is never repeated. “We have ensured that Marston has
  signed up to a robust action plan to put this right.” In a refund letter sent
  by Marston Recovery – one of the group’s brands – to one of those affected
  last month the company apologised for a “mistake” with the enforcement fees
  applied to the person’s debt, and said: “We’ve now fixed this issue, and
  you’re due a refund.” The letter included a reference to “HMCTS” – however,
  Marston says the overcharging issue does not involve fines imposed by HMCTS
  and that an administrative error led to this wording not being removed. The
  letter included a cheque for a sum approaching £250, made up of a refund of
  £235, plus interest. Marston said the three-year period for the refunds scheme
  is a precautionary measure to account for scenarios such as this, and it would
  make every effort to reach everyone affected. Earlier this summer the
  government announced a package of measures designed “to deliver a fairer
  system of debt enforcement”. A spokesperson for Marston Recovery said: “In the
  spring of this year an issue was identified where some individuals with
  multiple unpaid road traffic penalties had been overcharged enforcement fees.
  The issue has been fixed. “Letters, with cheques for a full refund plus
  interest at 8%, have been sent out to all of those affected. Those letters
  include an apology and guidance on how to contact us if there are any
  questions or help is required.” They added: “Since the issue first came to
  light, we have worked closely with the ECB … and all of our clients. We take
  full ownership and have worked hard to do the right thing by repaying people
  back what they are owed.”
