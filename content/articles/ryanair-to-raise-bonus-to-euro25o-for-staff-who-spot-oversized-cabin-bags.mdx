  Ryanair will pay airport staff increased and unlimited bonuses of €2.50 for
  every non-compliant carry-on bag they take from passengers, the airline’s boss
  has announced. Passengers whose cabin cases exceed the maximum dimensions for
  a small suitcase are charged fees of up to £75 and their luggage is taken into
  the hold. The fines have outraged some travellers – especially when it emerged
  that staff at the boarding gate have been incentivised to spot oversized bags.
  However, an unrepentant Michael O’Leary, the chief executive of Ryanair, said
  the airline would be upping the bonuses to keep baggage to the correct size.
  He said: “We’re going to raise it from €1.50 to €2.50, probably from the start
  of the winter schedule in November this year. And I make absolutely no apology
  for it whatsoever.” O’Leary said the airline would also remove the cap on
  bonuses of €80 a month, to encourage staff to stop as many non-compliant bags
  as possible. He added: “We should encourage people – I want our
  ground-handling people to be catching people who are scamming the system.” All
  passengers are allowed to bring on a small bag for free, that fits under the
  seat, at a maximum dimension of 40x30x20cm. A second cabin bag, typically a
  small wheelie suitcase, of up to 55x40x20cm, can be bought for a fee, normally
  lower than the price paid to put baggage in the hold. It was reported earlier
  this year that Swissport staff handling easyJet flights were paid bonuses of
  £1.20 per bag to enforce similar rules at the boarding gate. O’Leary said
  anxiety over punitive charges for small infractions was exaggerated: “I go
  regularly and do boardings in Dublin, and we don’t have an issue with the
  small bag, this kind of mythical, oh, only the zip was outside – if the zip
  was the only thing that was outside the sizer, it gets on, there’s no issue.”
  But, he said: “I am still mystified by the number of people with rucksacks who
  still think they’re going to get through the fucking gate, and we won’t notice
  the rucksack. We will. And you will be paying for the rucksack. You’re not
  getting on if it doesn’t fit.” O’Leary said the number of people paying fees
  was going down as more brought on compliant cases. He said: “We’re not trying
  to catch people out here. Most people, 99.9% of our passengers, comply with
  the rules. The amount of people who pay a gate bag fee is less than 0.1% of
  our passengers, and that’s still 200,000 passengers a year. “So we have more
  work to do to get rid of them, but the numbers who are paying a gate fee is
  tiny. They get a disproportionate amount of news or of coverage but frankly we
  don’t really care.” He told journalists at a press conference in London: “Keep
  covering it because we want everybody to comply with the rules, if you comply
  with the rules, no issues. “We are running a very efficient, very affordable,
  very low-cost airline, and we’re not letting anybody get in the way.”
