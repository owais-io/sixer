  Donald Trump has insisted he won’t let Vladimir Putin “mess around” with him
  at their high-stakes summit over Ukraine and is giving the talks a 75% chance
  of success. Amid concerns from European leaders that the Russian president
  will cajole Trump into imposing a settlement on Ukraine, the US president told
  reporters on the eve of Friday’s talks in Alaska: “I am president, and he’s
  not going to mess around with me. “I’ll know within the first two minutes,
  three minutes, four minutes or five minutes... whether or not we’re going to
  have a good meeting or a bad meeting. And if it’s a bad meeting, it’ll end
  very quickly, and if it’s a good meeting, we’re going to end up getting peace
  in the pretty near future.” Meanwhile in Washington DC, the White House said
  there would be a round-the-clock presence of local and federal law enforcement
  officers after Trump’s federal takeover of its police department and dispatch
  of national guard troops. Here are the key US politics stories at a glance:
  Trump says Putin ready to make Ukraine deal Donald Trump has said he believes
  Vladimir Putin is ready to make a deal on the war in Ukraine as the two
  leaders prepare for their Alaska summit, but his suggestion the Russian leader
  and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy could “divvy things up” may alarm
  some in Kyiv. The US president implied there was a 75% chance of Friday’s
  Alaska meeting succeeding, and that the threat of economic sanctions may have
  made Putin more willing to seek an end to the war. He also said a second
  meeting – at present not confirmed – between himself, Putin and Zelenskyy
  would be the more decisive. Read the full story Trump tightens grip on DC
  policing The president falsely claimed crime in Washington DC was the “worst
  it’s ever been”, amid an ongoing federal takeover of the city’s police
  department and deployment of the national guard and federal agents in the
  city. “Washington DC is at its worst point,” Trump said from the Oval Office
  on Thursday. “It will soon be at its best point.” He also baselessly accused
  DC law enforcement officials of giving “phony crime stats” and said “they’re
  under investigation”. Read the full story Bondi threatens to prosecute leaders
  not complying with immigration officers Pam Bondi, the attorney general, said
  she had sent “sanctuary city” letters to the mayors of 32 cities and a handful
  of county executives warning that she intends to prosecute political leaders
  who are not in her view sufficiently supportive of immigration enforcement.
  “You better be abiding by our federal policies and with our federal law
  enforcement, because if you’re not we’re going to come after you,” she told a
  Fox News reporter on Thursday. “Our leaders have to support our law
  enforcement.” Read the full story Texas Democrats prepare to return to state
  after two-week absence Democratic lawmakers in Texas said they were ready to
  return to the state under certain conditions, ending a nearly two-week-long
  effort to block Republicans from passing a new congressional map that would
  add five GOP seats. The lawmakers said on Thursday they would return as long
  as the legislature ended its first special session on Friday, which
  Republicans have said they plan to do. The Texas governor, Greg Abbott, has
  said he will immediately call another special session. Read the full story
  Melania Trump demands retraction of comments linking her to Epstein The first
  lady has demanded that Hunter Biden retract comments linking her to the sex
  offender Jeffrey Epstein and has threatened to sue if he does not. Biden, the
  son of the former president Joe Biden, alleged in an interview this month that
  Epstein had introduced Melania Trump to Donald Trump. The statements were
  false, defamatory and “extremely salacious”, Melania Trump’s lawyer, Alejandro
  Brito, said in a letter to Biden. Read the full story Medical journal rejects

  the journal’s editor told Reuters. Read the full story What else happened

  immigration jail as a federal judge weighs whether to close the facility in
  the Everglades known as “Alligator Alcatraz”. Catching up? Here’s what
