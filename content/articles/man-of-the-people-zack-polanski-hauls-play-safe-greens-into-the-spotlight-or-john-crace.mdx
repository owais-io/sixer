  The invitation promised that the results of the Green party leadership
  election would be one of the most consequential political events of the
  autumn. That might be pushing it, but they were certainly more consequential
  than Kemi Badenoch’s “drill, baby, drill” keynote speech in Aberdeen. Not a
  single broadcaster could be bothered with that one. It might as well not have
  happened. Shame. Because as well as receiving a scholarship to Stanford
  University to study medicine at 16, it’s a little-known fact that Kemi was
  also invited to be a visiting professor in climate science at Harvard at the
  age of 11. One day her true talents will be revealed. But not today. Tuesday
  morning was all about the Greens, and Harriet Lamb, the party’s chief
  executive, seemed rather overwhelmed by the attention. Standing room only at
  the Coin Street neighbourhood centre in central London. A phalanx of news
  cameras and journalists. It’s been a while since there’s been this much
  interest in the Greens. Lamb bobbed up and down behind the lectern, gulping
  nervously. This was a pivotal moment for the whole country, she said. The
  Greens were poised to help create the next government. Er … Run that one past
  me again. Just who will the Greens be going into coalition with, given that
  they’ve ruled out any deals with Reform, the Tories and Labour? That just
  leaves Jeremy Corbyn’s as yet unnamed party and possibly the Lib Dems. If they
  aren’t too rightwing. Not sure I can see that coalition getting enough seats
  to form a government. But maybe I’m just nit picking. In any case, this wasn’t
  a time to sweat the small stuff. If you can’t dare to dream on your first day
  in the new job, than when can you? For this day was all about Zack Polanski.
  Everyone knew that Zack was going to win weeks ago: the only question was by
  how much. Even so, nobody quite expected the scale of the victory, with
  Polanski getting 85% of the vote. A landslide. Out with the old, easy-does-it,
  Lib Dem-adjacent gradualism of previous Green leaders. In with a more radical,
  leftist eco-populism. Zack was all smiles. Big hugs for the defeated Ellie
  Chowns and Adrian Ramsay. You would never have guessed the leadership campaign
  had been a fairly bad-tempered affair. For the Greens, that is. During an LBC
  debate, Ramsay had refused to say whether he liked Polanski or not. I think we
  can assume not. But for now, all was forgiven. Then came the victory speech.
  Mainly a list of thank yous and tributes. Starting with the four Green MPs.
  Just as well. Zack is only a member of the London assembly and is going to
  have to work closely with his Westminster colleagues. No point alienating
  anyone just yet. “I stand on the shoulders of giants,” he said. Starting with
  Ramsay. Adrian had been brilliant. Just brilliant. Couldn’t have managed
  without him. Same with Ellie. Her work in holding the government to account
  over the genocide in Gaza had been matchless. It made you wonder what all the
  problems between them had been. Carla Denyer and Siân Berry both got a
  drive-by accolade. They were great because they just were. Let bygones be
  bygones. Zack was there for everyone. Not just those who voted for him.
  Everyone in the party had a common cause, but no one had to feel the same way
  about everything. Finally he took aim at the enemy. The water companies
  pumping sewage into rivers. The charlatans of Reform who were part of the
  millionaires’ cabal. Last, but not least, the Labour party. The lowest of the
  low. A party that had pretended to be on the side of workers but was no better
  than Reform. He didn’t even mention the Tories because everyone now treats
  them as irrelevant. We’re not here to work with Labour, Polanski declared.
  We’re here to replace you, Keir Starmer. We will have the people’s back. We
  will talk truth to power. In the blink of an eye, Westminster would be full of
  Green MPs. This was a pivotal moment in the country’s politics. The day the
  world changed. Those of us with long memories might feel we have heard all
  this before. Not just from Corbyn when he became Labour leader, but from every
  party leader who has ever been elected. But Zack sounded as if he believed it
  more than most. This was his moment and he was going to make the most of it.
  After a brief interlude in which the deputy leaders were announced, Polanski
  took to the stage once more to take questions from journalists. The first
  reporter asked why Zack felt he could succeed with a radical left agenda where
  Corbyn had previously failed. He would succeed because he would succeed. The
  people wanted what he had to offer. Nationalising the utilities. Taxing the
  billionaires. Acting on climate change. Not so much radical leftism as a
  no-brainer. Zack began to warm to his theme. He would think big. Aim to win 30
  Westminster seats. Within half an hour he had increased that to 40. Who knows
  where we would have been if the interviews had gone on any longer? It wasn’t
  all about him, he insisted. It was the members who decided policy. But just at
  this moment it did feel all about him. The man who wanted to take on Farage at
  his own social media game. The man who would deal with “despicable” Starmer
  only if he had a brain transplant. The man who doesn’t think twice about
  calling people fascist. It’s been quite the journey for Polanski. From actor
  to hypnotherapist promising to increase women’s breast size. Bygones, he says.
  From Lib Dem to eco-populist. It’s also been quite the journey for the Greens.
  No longer playing it safe. Choosing a leader who is not afraid to say what he
  thinks. Fighting fire with fire. Happy to make enemies. Leave Nato? Why ever
  not? Doing anything for attention. Just desperate not to be ignored. They’ve
  had enough of that.
