  Ministers in Scotland are facing intense criticism over a sluggish increase in
  exam passes by teenagers from deprived areas after repeated promises to
  greatly improve performance. Opposition parties and Scotland’s largest
  teaching union said progress in closing the attainment gap – the difference
  between exam passes for pupils from the wealthiest areas and those from the
  most deprived – was too slow and too patchy. In 2016, Nicola Sturgeon, then
  the first minister, published her government’s legislative programme with the
  promise that “substantially eliminating” the attainment gap by 2026 would be
  her government’s “defining mission”. This year’s exam results showed that the
  attainment gap had closed slightly year on year for pupils sitting National
  5s, the Scottish equivalent to GCSEs, falling from 17.2 percentage points last
  year to 16.5 points this year. For Scottish Highers, the standard
  qualification for university applications and roughly equivalent to A-levels,
  the gap this year fell marginally to 17.1 points from 17.2 points in 2024,
  then the highest on record. Scottish Labour said education was stagnating
  under the Scottish National party. Data from the Scottish Qualifications
  Authority showed this year’s attainment gap was very similar to that of 2019,
  the year before the Covid crisis hit, when the gap for National 5s was 17
  points. Pam Duncan-Glancy, Scottish Labour’s education spokesperson, accused
  Jenny Gilruth, the education secretary, of deflecting questions about the
  failure to meet its target when she was questioned on BBC Radio Scotland on
  Tuesday morning. “It is damning that Jenny Gilruth cannot say whether the
  attainment gap will be closed by next year,” Duncan-Glancy said. “This once
  again proves that any promises made by the SNP are simply not worth the paper
  they are written on.” Gilruth said they were measuring progress against
  literacy and numeracy levels in schools, and on improving access to
  university, not on exam passes. On both counts, attainment was improving, she
  said. The universities clearing house, Ucas, said on Tuesday a record number
  of Scots from the most deprived areas had won university places, up by 5.5
  points year on year to 2,060 people. However, only 16% of the 18-year-olds
  given places were from the poorest areas, compared with 43.6% from the most
  advantaged. Gilruth said the Covid crisis and Scotland’s funding levels from
  the UK government were significant factors. “I’m absolutely committed to our
  continued work to close the attainment gap, but I am in no way shirking away
  from the challenge we’ve seen in terms of the Covid pandemic and austerity in
  our schools,” she said. Thousands of pupils across the Western Isles, Arran,
  Orkney and Shetland received their results late after Monday’s severe storm
  delayed postal deliveries. The overall results showed pass rates for National
  5s and Highers had increased beyond the rate in 2019, with A-grade passes at
  their highest level. Andrea Bradley, the general secretary of the EIS teaching
  union, said “further solid steps” were needed to tackle poverty. “If Scotland
  is to eradicate the poverty-related attainment gap and deliver an education
  system that truly and equitably meets the diverse needs of all learners, then
  greater investment in schools and colleges, in resources and in teaching and
  support staff is essential,” she said.
