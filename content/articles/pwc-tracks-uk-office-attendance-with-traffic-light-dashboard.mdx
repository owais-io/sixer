  The big four accountancy firm PwC has intensified the way it tracks how often
  its UK employees come into the office by monitoring swipes of work passes and
  connections to wifi, prompting concerns among staff. Bosses use a dashboard to
  record attendance and check whether workers are adhering to the company policy
  that requires them to spend three days a week, or 60% of their time, with
  clients or in the office. The panel shows staff as “amber” if they fall below
  the 60% threshold, while workers show as “red” if they drop below 40%. The
  dashboard was first available for use by supervisors in April, while the
  office attendance data can reportedly be viewed by business unit leaders, as
  well as PwC’s chief financial, administrative and people officers. Employees
  are also able to access their own data. Employees’ wifi connections from their
  laptop are traced by the system to check whether they are working from client
  sites on the days expected, according to the Financial Times, which first
  reported details of the system. This is then cross-referenced with information
  from staff time sheets and the company’s HR platform. The increased scrutiny
  of office attendance is causing unease among PwC’s 23,000-strong UK workforce,
  and one senior staff member told the FT they had “lost count” of the number of
  colleagues who had shared concerns about the monitoring. Another person
  reportedly said workers were seeking more transparency from their employer
  about the tracking. Employees who breached the accountancy and consultancy
  firm’s office attendance policy could face formal sanctions that could affect
  their bonus and performance rating, according to the report, which said those
  unable to meet the attendance rules because of sickness or for family reasons
  can request allowances. PwC told UK employees last September that it was going
  to start tracking their working locations from January, to ensure that all
  workers spend “a minimum of three days a week” in the office or at client
  sites amid a clampdown on remote working. The company told staff in a memo it
  would track their locations in the same way it monitors how many chargeable
  hours they work, as the company looked to place “more emphasis on in-person
  working”. The rival firm EY began monitoring office attendance at the start of
  last year using staff turnstile data in an effort to crack down on breaches of
  its hybrid working policy. PwC UK’s chief people officer, Phillippa O’Connor,
  told the House of Lords home-based working committee in April that the
  company’s monitoring was “not clocking people in and out”. She added: “This is
  not an old-school manufacturing world; it is about empowered flexibility –
  they have attended an office in our world. Where we do not have that data, we
  look at shared IP.” PwC said there were “clear benefits to in-person work for
  both our people and clients” and the approach was “consistent with other
  businesses” and “recognised and accepted by the vast majority of our people”.
  A spokesperson said: “We always listen to feedback and are committed to
  regular, clear and transparent communications about expectations … The
  dashboard ensures our people have easy access to their attendance data, so
  they can manage and plan their time in a way that works for them, our teams
  and our clients.” PwC said the firm remained “committed to flexibility” and
  allowed employees to condense their usual working hours and finish early on
  Friday lunchtime for six weeks over the summer.
