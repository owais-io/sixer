  The Trump administration said on Tuesday that it will look for “anti-American”
  views, including on social media, when assessing the applications of people
  wanting to live in the United States. In an announcement, US Citizenship and
  Immigration Services, which handles requests to stay in the United States or
  become a citizen, said it would expand vetting of the social media postings of
  applicants and that “reviews for anti-American activity will be added to that
  vetting”. “America’s benefits should not be given to those who despise the
  country and promote anti-American ideologies,” said agency spokesperson
  Matthew Tragesser. “US Citizenship and Immigration Services is committed to
  implementing policies and procedures that root out anti-Americanism and
  supporting the enforcement of rigorous screening and vetting measures to the
  fullest extent possible. Immigration benefits – including to live and work in
  the United States – remain a privilege, not a right.” The US Immigration and
  Nationality Act, which dates back to 1952, defines anti-Americanism, which at
  the time primarily focused on communists. Since taking office in January, the
  Trump administration has moved aggressively to deny or rescind short-term
  visas for people deemed to go against US foreign policy interests, especially
  on Israel. The latest guidance on immigration decisions said that authorities
  will also look at whether applicants “promote anti-Semitic ideologies”. The
  Trump administration has accused students and universities of antisemitism
  over protests against Israel’s war in the Gaza Strip, charges denied by the
  activists. In April, the administration revoked or changed the legal status of
  hundreds of international students, only to reinstate them several weeks
  later. In May, student visa interviews were temporarily halted, and then, in
  June, new social media vetting measures were introduced for international
  students applying to study in the US. Under the new measures, US diplomats are
  directed to review applicants’ social media profiles to look for “any
  indications of hostility toward the citizens, culture, government,
  institutions, or founding principles of the United States” before issuing
  visas. On Monday, the state department said it had revoked 6,000 student visas
  since the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, took office in January. It said
  that 4,000 of the cases involved violations of the law – “the vast majority
  being assault, DUI, burglary and support for terrorism” a state department
  official said.
