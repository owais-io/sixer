  Expanding Heathrow would result in increased carbon dioxide emissions and
  could put the UK further off track on its climate goals, but the government is
  claiming it can offset that by investing in research on new low-carbon fuels
  for aircraft and on electric planes. However, any such technology is still
  decades away, if it ever reaches commercial scale, making it certain that any
  new runway in the near future would be used by the same kerosene-fuelled,
  high-carbon aircraft that we have today. The Climate Change Committee, the
  government’s statutory adviser on net zero, has warned repeatedly that airport
  expansion would breach the UK’s carbon budgets, which are set years in advance
  on a pathway to meet the goal of net zero emissions by 2050. While the CCC
  cannot prescribe government policy, especially in the case of specific
  decisions, it has noted that any expansion of airports would be possible
  within the UK’s carbon budgets only if far steeper cuts in greenhouse gas
  emissions are made elsewhere within the economy. In its most recent report to
  parliament, the committee said: “Any plan to increase airport capacity needs
  to be based on realistic projections of future demand. These demand
  projections need to be consistent with climate change targets and take account
  of the costs to the sector of getting aviation to net zero emissions.”
  Campaigners do not believe it is possible for an expanded Heathrow to operate
  within the UK’s carbon budgets. Alethea Warrington, the head of aviation at
  the climate charity Possible, said: “It is unlikely that this expansion can be
  done within the current carbon budget as a new runway would bring additional
  flights, with a huge chunk of additional emissions, with no way of removing
  them.” Doug Parr, the policy director of Greenpeace UK, said: “Anyone who is
  serious about tackling climate change would be very cautious about making that
  problem even bigger without a coherent plan for dealing with it. Wishful
  thinking about future technological advances and cost reductions are not a
  coherent plan, and certainly not a plausible basis to allow the huge increase
  in emissions from a third runway at Heathrow. This policy amounts to
  announcing infrastructure now and kicking the carbon cost down the road for a
  future government to deal with.” Yet there could be alternatives if the
  government is brave enough to grasp them. The CCC has advised that the
  aviation sector should be forced to “pay for permanent engineered removals to
  balance out all remaining emissions”. That would be expensive – ways of
  permanently removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, such as capturing the
  gas and storing it, are still under development. Simpler than that, why not
  substitute train journeys for flying? In 2021, there were more than 3m flights
  within the UK between July to September alone and there are 15 flights a day
  to Brussels, which is just over two hours away by train from London. But
  flights are often cheaper than trains, even over short distances – flying is
  in effect subsidised, through the tax system. To encourage people on to trains
  instead of domestic flights, the government would need to make rail journeys
  cheaper or flights more expensive. The former would require investment, and
  the latter would annoy some middle-class voters. Therefore neither seems
  likely.
