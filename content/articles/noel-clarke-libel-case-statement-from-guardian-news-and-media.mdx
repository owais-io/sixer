  Katharine Viner, editor-in-chief, Guardian News &amp; Media, said: “We welcome
  the decision of the High Court today, in a judgment handed down by Mrs Justice
  Steyn in the case of Noel Clarke vs Guardian News &amp; Media. The judge
  ruled, in extremely clear language, that the Guardian’s reporting was
  substantially true, and our belief that the reporting was in the public
  interest was undoubtedly reasonable. “This judgment is a deserved victory for
  those women who suffered because of the behaviour of Noel Clarke. Going to
  court is difficult and stressful, yet more than 20 women agreed to testify in
  the High Court, refusing to be bullied or intimidated. “This is also a
  landmark judgment for Guardian journalism, and for investigative journalism in
  Britain. It was important to fight this case. This was a deeply-researched
  investigation by some of the Guardian’s best reporters, who worked diligently
  and responsibly. The judgment is clear that our investigation was thorough and
  fair, a template for public interest journalism. “I hope today will give
  encouragement to other women in similar situations who have been too fearful
  to raise their voices for fear of the consequences.”
