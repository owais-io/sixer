  Police arrested 13 people at a protest in Norfolk on Saturday on suspicion of
  showing support for the proscribed group Palestine Action. A group assembled
  outside City Hall in St Peters Street, Norwich, holding placards referencing
  the organisation, Norfolk police said. The force said they were arrested on
  suspicion of displaying an item in support of a proscribed organisation,
  contrary to section 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000. It added: “Five of those
  arrested have been taken to Wymondham police investigation centre for
  questioning, where they remain. The remaining eight people were spoken to by
  officers and provided their details for further investigation. They were
  therefore de-arrested. “A 14th person had their sign seized by officers during
  the protest and provided their details when requested.” Supt Wes Hornigold of
  Norfolk police said: “We will always work to facilitate peaceful protest and
  protect the democratic right to assembly, however the actions of this group
  were unlawful. “Our officers’ role is to prevent disorder, damage and
  disruption in the local community and they will use their powers to do this.
  Any breaches of the law will be dealt with.” The arrests came a day after the
  Metropolitan police said a further 60 people will be prosecuted for alleged
  support of Palestine Action. The force said this followed the arrest of more
  than 700 people since the group was banned on 5 July, including 522 in central
  London last Saturday. More prosecutions are expected in the coming weeks and
  arrangements have been put in place “that will enable us to investigate and
  prosecute significant numbers each week if necessary”, the Met said. The Met
  last week confirmed the first three charges in England and Wales for offences
  under the Terrorism Act relating to Palestine Action. On Friday, organisations
  including Greenpeace and Human Rights Watch wrote to the attorney general for
  England and Wales arguing that protesters arrested for supporting the
  organisation should not be prosecuted until a legal challenge to a ban on the
  group has been heard. Palestine Action was proscribed last month by the home
  secretary, Yvette Cooper, after the group claimed responsibility for damage to
  jets at RAF Brize Norton, and was also linked to allegations of a serious
  assault on staff and police officers at a business premises in south
  Gloucestershire.
