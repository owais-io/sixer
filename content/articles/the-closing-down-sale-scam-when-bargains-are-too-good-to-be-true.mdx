  After 40 years, an elderly couple have decided to retire and close their
  business. Or a clothes retailer says that it is with sadness he has decided to
  shut up shop and needs to get rid of his remaining stock. But the “sadness” of
  a business closing also brings an opportunity to bag a bargain – perhaps a
  cut-price leather jacket, or 50% off the last merino wool sweaters in the
  warehouse. Such ads are commonplace on social media, but, in some cases, they
  are simple scams where you hand over money only to receive nothing. Or perhaps
  you will end up with a jacket or sweater that barely resembles what was
  advertised, or is of a much lower quality than expected. Marta Mallavibarrena,
  a cybersecurity researcher based in Madrid, was browsing Instagram when she
  saw four different shops all using the same language (“Sadly, we are closing
  …”) about a sale. Some were offering men’s jackets, while others were selling
  animal print clothing. When she searched the ad library of Meta (owner of
  Facebook and Instagram), she found 50,000 ads had used the same phrase, and
  1,600 were still active at the time. Most of the accounts which published the
  ads had been around for a short time, and those that were older had typically
  changed their profile names in recent weeks. Using similar marketing tactics
  is not a crime, says Mallavibarrena. But often real images from reputable
  shops were being taken and used across the “closing down” ads. In cases where
  buyers actually get something delivered, the products will often come from
  large, cheap online retailers or so-called “drop shipping” sites: third party
  companies which ship products directly to consumers. “While you might get
  something delivered, it’s not going to be reflective of what’s there on the
  ad,” says Mallavibarrena. “It’s going to be something like a polyester T-shirt
  with the knitting pattern printed on it, instead of an actual knitted
  sweater.” Serpil Hall, a consultant on fraud and economic crime, says hundreds
  of such accounts can be set up at once using emotive language with a sense of
  urgency to draw people in. “In many cases no goods are ever shipped – the site
  disappears after collecting payments. In some other cases, counterfeit, or
  poor-quality goods arrive (sweatshirts, watches, trainers), often traced to
  very low-cost bulk suppliers,” she says. The accounts will often be abandoned,
  or renamed, once negative reviews start to build up on them. What the scam
  looks like The post will say that a company is closing down and has a limited
  amount of stock available. This tactic uses the scarcity principle, which says
  that people place a higher value on things which are limited in availability.
  Sometimes there will be bigger discounts if you buy more than one item – for
  example, 20% off one and 40% off for two. Often the accounts that post the ads
  will look slick and – when glanced at very quickly – genuine. They may give an
  address, and sometimes have the city they claim to be based in as part of the
  name – such as London or St Louis. In reality, these formats can be endlessly
  repeated with false information and have no grounding in reality. Often the
  pictures that appear on them – of the founders, say – can be AI-generated. In
  one case highlighted by consumer group Which?, a boutique called Thompson
  Oxford said it had a “heavy heart and tears in my eyes” and could not compete
  with larger stores, so it had to close down and sell on its stock. Hall says
  that often the sites are not sophisticated. “They’re industrialised social
  engineering – leveraging cheap ads, fake urgency and rapid rebranding to take
  money from thousands of consumers before disappearing.” What to do The age-old
  adage says that “if it is too good to be true, then it probably is”. And this
  is the case here. The fraudsters rely on people reacting quickly when faced
  with the offer of a bargain. So take a step back and immediately question
  whether the ad you are looking at could be a scam. Start with the comments on
  the profile page of the account which will give you an indication of whether
  people got the goods they ordered, and what the quality was like. You can
  check Meta’s ad library to see whether the text from the ad is replicated
  elsewhere. Doing a reverse image search, on Google Images for example, will
  allow you to see where else the pictures may be appearing. You can complain to
  Meta about misleading contents, or a possible scam on its platforms. Its rules
  say that ads “must not promote products, services, schemes or offers using
  identified deceptive or misleading practices, including those meant to scam
  people out of money or personal information”.
