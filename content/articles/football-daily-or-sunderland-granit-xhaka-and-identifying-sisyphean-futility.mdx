  XHAKA CAN Correctly installed as lava-hot favourites to be relegated back to
  the Championship, seconds after the final whistle was blown at the end of
  their last-gasp playoff final win over Sheffield United, Sunderland promptly
  lost their standout player, Jobe Bellingham, to a far more successful club who
  might conceivably win a trophy more prestigious than Fizzy Cup in the next 70
  years. Instead of raging about cosy cartels, the unfairness of PSR and the
  fact their billionaire owner isn’t allowed to spend money on players that the
  football club he owns hasn’t earned, mackems have since looked on with
  increasing intrigue as their club’s hierarchy have unveiled a series of new
  signings that, while unlikely to prompt talk of a serious title tilt, may at
  least ensure that Sunderland do not feature in any conversational comparisons
  with Derby County and their record low Premier League points tally of 11 in
  the coming months. It’s a near-certainty that Enzo Le Fée, Habib Diarra, Simon
  Adingra, Chemsdine Talbi, Noah Sadiki and Reinildo Mandava won’t all go on to
  achieve Hall of Fame status on Wearside. But, in signing the six players, the
  club have shown they at least intend to make a decent fist of trying to stay
  up, while also putting the Sunderland ‘Til I Die days of Jack Rodwell on
  £70,000-per-week in League One, paying £4m for Will Grigg in an ill-advised
  deadline-day panic buy and that Oxbridge fop in the red trousers sound
  checking Ibiza anthems over the Stadium of Light PA long behind them. Of
  course, this being Sunderland, the possibility of sky-high farce and a snake
  belly low league position can never be discounted and despite these signings,
  the club’s head coach, Régis Le Bris, looked at risk of embarking on his first
  ever Premier League campaign with a callow and whey-faced squad boasting
  little or no top-flight experience. A grizzled old hand was required. Ideally
  a handsome, tough-tackling midfield veteran with more than a century of caps.
  A man whose leadership skills were held in such high regard by his peers that
  he famously topped the players’ poll for the position of Arsenal captain in
  2019 without recourse to a recount. A man so impervious to the slings and
  brickbats of his once-adoring public that he would go on to … er, lose that
  captaincy after throwing a strop in the face of fan derision for being
  substituted against Crystal Palace. A man who realised the Sisyphean futility
  of trying to win a title at the Emirates and went to Germany to win one
  instead. And a man who realised he was unlikely to win another one because
  Leverkusen are now managed by Erik ten Hag. What Sunderland needed was the
  man, the warrior, the myth and the occasionally contrary red and yellow
  card-magnet that is Granit Xhaka. And hell’s bells, if they haven’t gone and
  got him, in the process landing the kind of transfer coup which suggests that
  if they are to eventually go down next season, they will at least do so
  swinging haymakers of both the metaphorical and literal variety. “I’m very
  proud to be here,” roared the man who finished 16th on last year’s Ballon d’Or
  list and has signed a three-year deal for a fee of around £20m. “When I spoke
  to the club, I was excited and I felt the energy and the mentality that all
  the people and players have. It’s exactly what I wanted and I have a very good
  feeling.” Having made it clear before his move that he was hell-bent on moving
  to Sunderland, Xhaka’s arrival has prompted several questions, the most
  pertinent of which seems to be why exactly he was so hell-bent on going to
  Sunderland. “We are back to where this club needs to be, and we want to stay
  here to write our own history,” yodelled the Swiss legend to his adoring
  public from the central tower of Durham Cathedral. “I feel that I’m ready to
  help the team with my experience but with quality as well.” And while history
  is famously written by the winners, there isn’t a mackem alive who won’t be
  delighted if next season it’s chronicled by the team finishing 17th. QUOTE OF
  THE DAY “We have done this immediately, following an assessment by engineering
  specialists who can no longer confirm that the North Stand is safe for
  spectator use” – after yesterday’s Football Daily, Sheffield city councillor
  Joe Otten reveals the outlook is even more grim for Wednesday fans after they
  were been banned from opening Hillsborough’s North Stand to spectators due to
  safety concerns, with the new season little more than a week away. FOOTBALL
  DAILY LETTERS Perhaps the reason for Sheffield Wednesday’s 10-man, 16-0 defeat
  to Halliwell FC in 1887 (yesterday’s Football Daily) was that not all members
  of the 1896 FA Cup-winning squad were trusting of the Victorian time machine
  technology that the club were clearly using at that time?” – Garreth Cummins
  (and others). Although the number is the same as Football Daily’s pedants, my
  only knowledge of ‘Bonnie Blue’ is that I thought it was an affectionate name
  for Cowdenbeath’s home kit. And that’s the story I’m sticking with” – Simon
  Mazier (and 1,056 others). Re: Forest’s ownership. Guy Stephenson is partially
  correct (yesterday’s Football Daily letters); it is the same Evangelos
  Marinakis who put his shares into a blind trust earlier in the year, but it’s
  also the Evangelos Marinakis that reversed the situation in June when it
  became apparent it wasn’t required” – Jim Hearson. If you have any, please
  send letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. Today’s winner of our prizeless
  letter o’ the day is … Rollover. Terms and conditions for our competitions,
  when we run them, are here.  RECOMMENDED BOOKING On Thursday 11 September,
