  There was vindication as well as a place in the Liverpool history books for
  Rio Ngumoha with the ice-cool finish he swept past Nick Pope at St James’ Park
  on Monday. The 16-year-old has announced himself on the Premier League stage,
  as every one of his coaches predicted he would, though it is debatable his
  name would have registered so quickly without a bold decision taken a year
  ago. Ngumoha was considered one of the brightest English prospects in the
  Premier League academy system when he stunned Chelsea last summer by leaving
  for Liverpool. If it was a wrench to leave the club he had joined aged eight,
  and for a Newham-born boy to leave London days after his 16th birthday, then
  the clearer route to first-team football that Ngumoha envisaged at Liverpool
  was compensation. The dramatic 100th-minute winner at Newcastle on Monday,
  when the teenager replaced Ben Woodburn as the youngest goalscorer in
  Liverpool’s history, aged 16 years and 361 days, justified that call. Chelsea
  made several contract offers to Ngumoha and were so miffed when he left that
  they sought to guard against future poaching by banning Liverpool’s scouts
  from attending academy matches at their training ground. It is understood that
  terse words were exchanged at executive level. Chelsea knew what they were
  losing. “This boy is and will be a top player,” the club’s former captain John
  Terry said. For Ngumoha, it came down to pathways. Chelsea have hoovered up
  some of the best young talent in the world. Would there be opportunities for
  him? Enzo Maresca gave a debut to the 16‑year‑old midfielder Reggie Walsh last
  season but competition for places is fierce. Chelsea, after all, have just
  added the 18‑year‑old Brazilian winger Estêvão Willian to their squad and will
  bring in the Portuguese winger Geovany Quenda from Sporting Lisbon next
  summer, when he will be 19. “A good player who needed to leave,” one source
  said. “He’s a lovely kid but he’d be playing youth football at Chelsea this
  season.” Sources with knowledge of youth football believe Ngumoha was right to
  leave. One figure, who expects him to rise to the top, says Ngumoha was
  regarded at Chelsea as less talented than Tyrique George had been at the same
  age. George, 19, broke into Chelsea’s first team last season but is likely to
  be sold before the window closes on Monday. There is a sense the winger’s game
  time at Chelsea has turned him into an asset and that Liverpool focus more on
  a player’s talent and less on how much could be made from selling them.
  Ngumoha’s career is on fast‑forward. He is not eligible to sign the first
  professional contract of his career until Friday, when he turns 17. At
  Liverpool he was immediately thrust into the under‑18s. He impressed and was
  promoted to the under-21s, where the coach Barry Lewtas worked on improving
  Ngumoha’s end product and teamwork. There was also a full debut for Arne
  Slot’s senior side in January when he started the FA Cup third-round win
  against Accrington Stanley at Anfield. Ngumoha announced himself at a Premier
  League and global level on Monday but Liverpool fans became well acquainted
  with his precocious talents in pre-season. He stepped up seamlessly, scoring
  fine individual goals against Yokohama F Marinos and Athletic Bilbao while
  catching the eye with his pace, technique and improved awareness. He presented
  a strong argument for the champions not signing a direct replacement for Luis
  Díaz long before he increased Newcastle’s torment at Liverpool’s hands.
  Ngumoha’s willingness to learn is a recurring theme among his coaches, from
  academy level to Slot, who had no hesitation in giving first-team squad places
  to Ngumoha and Trey Nyoni after their impressive summers. Terry Bobie,
  Ngumoha’s former youth coach at Chelsea, has credited the player’s older
  brother James as a key influence. “I’d start at four o’clock in the afternoon
  and finish at eight in the evening,” Bobie said. “Rio would be there the whole
  time with his brother. What stood out was how demanding James was with him.
  They argued at times, but it always came from the right place. James saw Rio’s
  talent and wanted to push him to reach his potential. They worked
  relentlessly. Not many people saw that side of it, but it was every single day
  for years – week in, week out, day in, day out.” Ngumoha’s receptiveness to
  new ideas and his grounded character were evident in a post-match interview
  with LFCTV on Monday. The adrenaline was still clearly flowing after an
  incredible finale at St James’ Park, one that carried the hallmark of
  champions, but he did not get swept along in the moment. “Normally, last
  season especially, the academy coaches and even the first-team coaches are
  always saying: ‘Make the back post, make the back post.’ The fact that I made
  the back post is just crazy,” Ngumoha said of the goal that made him the first
  16‑year‑old to score a Premier League winner since Wayne Rooney for Everton
  against Arsenal in 2002. “The fans, I heard them screaming my name and that’s
  a sensational moment I would say. But you can’t get too carried away with all
  the noise because I probably do that finish 100 times on the training ground
  so it’s no different with the fans [present]. “I’m 16 but I don’t want my age
  to show that I can’t play with the older players. I want to prove a point that
  I can play with not just people my age but many ages above. There are people
  at the club who are always helping me and I’m always learning and improving,
  so I can’t complain.” But Chelsea might.
