  In interviews this morning Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, confirmed that
  the government will be contacting international students telling them that if
  they overstay their visas, they will be removed. The Home Office is concerned
  about the growing number of people who come to the UK legally on student visas
  but then claim asylum when they are meant to return home. According to the
  BBC, students will be sent text messages and emails saying: If you submit an
  asylum claim that lacks merit, it will be swiftly and robustly refused. Any
  request for asylum support will be assessed against destitution criteria. If
  you do not meet the criteria, you will not receive support. If you have no
  legal right to remain in the UK, you must leave. If you don’t, we will remove
  you. In an interview with BBC Breakfast this morning, Cooper said there was a
  problem with international students “claiming asylum as they come to the end
  of their visa, even when things haven’t changed in their home country”. She
  went on: If nothing has changed in their country, people should not be
  claiming asylum at the end of a student course. We need to clamp down on that
  and that’s why we’re sending these messages to be very clear to people – the
  asylum system is not for people who just want to extend their visas. Good
  morning. Kemi Badenoch has a big speech this morning (albeit one extensively
  trailed), the Greens are announcing the results of their leadership contest,
  but there is still considerable focus on what is happening in Downing Street,
  where Keir Starmer will chair the first cabinet to be attended by Darren Jones
  in his new role as chief secretary to the PM. As Pippa Crerar and Jessica
  Elgot report in the Guardian’s splash, Starmer’s mini-reshuffle is being seen
  as an attempt “to wrest back control of economic policy from the Treasury”.
  Other papers have offered a more brutal intepretation, writing this up as
  Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, being marginalised. This morning Yvette Cooper,
  the home secretary, has been touring the studios. Mostly her interviews have
  focused on the asylum system (more on that soon), but she was also asked about
  the Downing Street shake-up. Asked on Sky News if Reeves was being sidelined,
  Cooper replied: I don’t think so at all. Quite the reverse. I think the prime
  minister and the chancellor have always worked extremely closely together and
  continue to do so. The mini-reshuffle means that Starmer, who has not had an
  heavyweight economic adviser in No 10 with the clout to take on the Treasury
  toe-to-toe, now has Jones, previously Reeves’s well-regarded deputy, and
  Minouche Shafik, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, reporting
  directly to him. Asked if the reshuffle meant No 10 would have more input into
  this year’s budget than it had last year, Cooper replied: In my experience
  through successive chancellors through very many years, ultimately, the
  chancellor always writes the budget, because that’s the nature of the complex
  mix of things, but always with conversations and discussions with the prime
  minister throughout, so you get that strong support. (The more accurate answer
  is ‘yes, of course, that’s the whole point’ – as Pippa and Jess explain in
  their story.) Of course, you would expect Cooper to reply like this. But
  Reeves will probably welcome what she said. And Reeves needs some good news.
  As Graeme Wearden reports, long-term government borrowing costs have just hit
  their highest level for 27 years. Here is the agenda for the day. 11am: The
  Green party of England and Wales announces the results of its leadership
  contest. As Aletha Adu reports, Zack Polanski is expected to win. 11am: Keir
  Starmer chairs cabinet. 11am: Kemi Badenoch gives a speech to the Society of
  Petroleum Engineers Offshore Europe conference in Aberdeen. As the Tories have
  been briefing since the weekend, she will say that a future Conservative
  government would maximise the extraction of oil and gas from the North Sea.
  11.30am: David Lammy, the foreign secretary, takes questions in the Commons.
  Noon: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. After 12.30pm: MPs start debating
  the second reading of the English devolution and community empowerment bill.
  Also, at some point today, the government is publishing its new sentencing
  bill. If you want to contact me, please post a message below the line when
  comments are open (normally between 10am and 3pm at the moment), or message me
  on social media. I can’t read all the messages BTL, but if you put “Andrew” in
  a message aimed at me, I am more likely to see it because I search for posts
  containing that word. If you want to flag something up urgently, it is best to
  use social media. You can reach me on Bluesky at
  @andrewsparrowgdn.bsky.social. The Guardian has given up posting from its
  official accounts on X, but individual Guardian journalists are there, I still
  have my account, and if you message me there at @AndrewSparrow, I will see it
  and respond if necessary. I find it very helpful when readers point out
  mistakes, even minor typos. No error is too small to correct. And I find your
  questions very interesting too. I can’t promise to reply to them all, but I
  will try to reply to as many as I can, either BTL or sometimes in the blog.
