  The Trump administration’s immigration policies are affecting workers and
  driving, in part, a decline in tourism, including international tourists, to
  Las Vegas, according to workers and the largest labor union in the state of
  Nevada. Visitors to Las Vegas overall dropped 11.3% in June 2025, compared to
  the same month last year. According to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors
  Authority, international visitors to one of the world’s largest tourist
  destinations dropped 13% in June. “A lot of departments are having a lot of
  layoffs,” said Norma Torres, a housekeeper for eight years at Mandalay Bay and
  a member of the Culinary Union, who has worked in the hospitality industry
  since she was 18 years old. “In the housekeeping department, the people on
  call are barely called into work.” Canada is Nevada’s largest international
  market. Flair Airlines, a Canadian airline, reported a 55% drop in passengers
  compared to last year. Air Canada reported a 13.2% drop in passengers from May
  to June this year to Las Vegas, and one third lower compared to last year.
  Trump administration officials have reportedly pushed for Immigration and
  Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents to arrest 3,000 people a day as part of their
  anti-immigration agenda. They have subsequently denied that those quotas
  exist. But they have continued to revoke immigration statuses, delayed action
  for childhood arrivals, and other humanitarian immigration programs. “If you
  tell the rest of the world you’re not welcome, they are going to listen. Our
  members are telling us that they’re quite nervous, and that’s why they’re
  calling it a Trump slump,” said Ted Pappageorge, secretary treasurer of
  Culinary Workers Union Local 226. But the Ice raids, trade wars with trading
  partners and fears that rising tariffs will hit the finances of potential
  visitors are all having an impact on Sin City tourism. “You have Canadians
  that have said, ‘We’re going to go elsewhere.’ Some of our best customers are
  Mexican tourists. But the biggest one is southern California and visitation is
  down because they’re nervous about raids, the tariffs, the economy riled up,”
  added Pappageorge. “The way these kind of chaotic immigration policies have
  been handled have a direct impact, we think, on what’s happening with this
  slowdown in Las Vegas and our members are quite concerned.” The union noted
  its members come from 178 different countries and speak 40 different
  languages. The union represents 60,000 workers in Las Vegas and Reno, and 45%
  of its members are immigrants. Nearly a quarter (24%) of Nevada’s workforce
  are immigrants, and an even higher share of Nevada’s leisure and hospitality
  industry are immigrants. Immigrants contribute an estimated $20.2bn to
  Nevada’s economy annually. Norma Torres, who was born in Mexico, currently has
  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) immigration status, a policy
  enacted in 2012 for immigrant individuals brought to the US as children.
  Torres explained she is worried about how the Trump administration will impact
  her immigration status. “Before I had a Daca, I was living in fear. Since I’ve
  had DACA, I’ve been living free, I’ve been working, I’ve been having the best
  life with my daughters, but now with this administration that we have going on
  with Daca and TPS, they are in danger and again I’m living in fear,” said
  Torres. “I can be driving on the street, they can pull me over. I can be
  separated from my daughters, they are US citizens who were born here and just
  thinking about that makes me afraid. For me and my family, we live in fear
  now.” Nery Martinez, a bartender at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas and Culinary
  Workers Union Local 226 member for 10 years, has been in the US for decades
  under temporary protected status from El Salvador and is worried about the
  push from the Trump administration to revoke TPS for thousands of immigrants
  from El Salvador and other countries. “That would be devastating, not only for
  me but for thousands of families,” said Martinez. “After 25 years in this
  place, what would I do if they separate me from my children, from my wife,
  from my life I had built from scratch? Those things hurt not just me and
  people like me, but also hurt citizen children, the community and the economy
  we help sustain.” He said he loves working in Las Vegas, working alongside
  others from all around the world and interacting with tourists from abroad and
  throughout the US, but emphasized he now worries about what is going to happen
  to his immigration status. “We are working people with families who love this
  country. We don’t want privilege, just that we are allowed to stay here
  legally as we have done for decades. Our families are American, I also feel
  part of this nation. Taking away TPS (temporary protected status) would be
  tearing away my life. I can’t have a nice night, go to bed, wake up the next
  day, because every night I have those thoughts about what’s going to happen.”
  Ted Pappageorge noted that for 20 years the culinary union has secured in
  their contracts that any worker who has their immigration status removed or
  expired is able to maintain their job, seniority, and pay until they get their
  status resolved, a support mechanism he argues should be legally provided to
  all workers. “The idea that you’re bringing in Marines and arresting
  dishwashers or landscapers, people that actually contribute to society, pay
  taxes, that go to our churches, their kids go to our schools, they’re
  neighbors, is just crazy. This is just chaos what’s going on here,” concluded
  Pappageorge. “There needs to be a complete 180 course correction on this
  damage being done to the travel, tourism, and hospitality industry, that’s
  ground zero here in Las Vegas.” The Nevada governor’s office did not respond
  to multiple requests for comment.
