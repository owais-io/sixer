  The water regulator is scrutinising payments worth £1.3m made to the boss of
  Yorkshire Water via an offshore parent company, after the Guardian revealed
  the existence of the extra money. A government spokesperson said Ofwat, the
  watchdog for England and Wales, would “assess” the payments to the utility’s
  chief executive, Nicola Shaw, to ensure they complied with rules banning
  bonuses for water company bosses. Shaw received pay of £1.3m from Yorkshire
  Water’s parent company, the Jersey-incorporated Kelda Holdings, between April
  2023 and March 2025. The company revealed the size of the pay packets only
  after the Guardian raised questions about the ability of MPs and billpayers to
  scrutinise the sums awarded. A Yorkshire Water spokesperson said it complied
  fully with Ofwat’s requirements on pay disclosure and bonus payments, and that
  the extra payments relating to work for Kelda Holdings were paid by
  shareholders rather than billpayers. Executive pay at water companies has come
  under close scrutiny in recent years amid public anger over sewage overflows
  into Britain’s rivers and seas. That prompted the government first to ban
  water companies from using money from customer bills to pay bonuses, and then
  to ban bonuses for the chief executives and finance bosses of companies
  responsible for serious environmental pollution. Yorkshire Water, which was
  allowed to raise average annual household bills by 41% to £607, was one of the
  six companies banned from paying bonuses. However, the extra money paid by
  Kelda Group meant Shaw still made more than £1.3m during the 2024-25 financial
  year – nearly double the salary reported by Yorkshire Water Services, the
  subsidiary regulated by Ofwat. The Department for the Environment, Food and
  Rural Affairs said: “We are aware of these payments, which Ofwat are currently
  assessing as a matter of urgency. “Undeserved bonuses for water company bosses
  have now been banned as part of the government’s plan to clean up our rivers,
  lakes and seas for good. Any instances of companies trying to circumvent the
  new rules are completely unacceptable. “The government will leave no stone
  unturned in clawing back any payments if found to be against the rules.”
  However, a person with knowledge of Ofwat’s thinking has suggested that the
  payments are not likely to contravene rules that are narrowly focused on
  “performance-related” pay, meaning remuneration that does not change from year
  to year would not be banned. Ofwat has previously raised concerns about the
  use of offshore corporate structures by water companies, pushing for several
  of them to close subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands jurisdiction. Ofwat’s
  bonus rules would ban performance-related pay even from offshore parent
  companies, but non-variable fees are unlikely to be covered. Yorkshire Water
  declined to provide the accounts for Kelda Holdings, which are not publicly
  available, so it is unclear how the payments were explained. A spokesperson
  for the utility previously said the fees of £660,000 a year had been
  “introduced from 1 April 2023 and have remained the same for both years”. The
  spokesperson added that the fees were in recognition of “work for the benefit
  of the Kelda Group”, including “promoting long-term financial investment in
  the Yorkshire Water business as well as investor engagement, financial
  oversight, oversight of the Kelda group as a whole and regulatory compliance”.
  The revelation of Shaw’s extra pay has provoked anger from campaigners. The
  Ilkley Clean River Group has written to Vanda Murray, the chair of Kelda
  Holdings and Yorkshire Water, suggesting that the extra payments from Kelda
  Holdings undermined a gesture made by Shaw when she publicly turned down a
  bonus in May 2023 – a month after the offshore payments had been quietly
  introduced. In June 2023 Shaw said she would forgo a bonus of between £600,000
  and £800,000, saying: “I get why people are angry. Seeing sewage in our rivers
  and seas isn’t right.” Shaw joined Yorkshire Water in May 2022, after a senior
  job at the National Grid and as chief executive of the High Speed 1 railway
  line. Including the offshore company payments, she has been awarded £3.8m in
  total pay over three years. Ilkley is a picturesque West Yorkshire spa town
  whose river, the Wharfe, was granted bathing water status in 2020, although
  persistent pollution has threatened that designation. The campaigners, led by
  Prof Becky Malby, wrote: “It appears that the payments from Kelda Holdings
  bring Ms Shaw’s salary to the level she would expect if she had taken her
  bonuses. “To the customer the additional payments to Ms Shaw look like a way
  of ‘working around’ the fact that bonuses were causing public outrage and
  subsequently banned by government. There is in effect no change to
  eye-watering salaries at the top of Yorkshire Water.” Yorkshire Water declined
  to comment further.
