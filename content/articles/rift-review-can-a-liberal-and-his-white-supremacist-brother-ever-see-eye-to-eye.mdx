  eye?

  Families fell out over Brexit. They split over Trump. But few schisms can have
  been more severe than that of playwright Gabriel Jason Dean and his brother.
  It is a relationship that inspired this probing two-hander in which a bookish
  student at the start of a literary career (Blake Stadnik) visits his
  incarcerated sibling (Matt Monaco), hoping to help with his legal claim for
  release. As their meetings unfold over years and then decades, one becomes a
  celebrated champion of liberal values, while the other emerges as a white
  supremacist. What hope for reconciliation when each brother has views
  antithetical to the other’s? It is a theme that was explored by Chris Thorpe
  in Confirmation (2014), which described the playwright’s real-life attempt to
  see eye to eye with a Holocaust denier. That play was needling and unsettling
  in a way this one is not, but what Rift has on its side is the fraternal bond
  at its heart. With head shaved and swastika tattoo showing beneath his orange
  jumpsuit, Monaco frightens you with the ferocity of his stare and his air of
  volatility. In contrast, Stadnik could hardly look prissier with his neat
  business suit and ethical reading list. Yet these men are not strangers and
  cannot entirely discount each other. Their childhood history, in particular
  their repressed memories of abuse, gives them a bond that transcends matters
  of political difference. Directed with verve and intensity by Ari Laura Kreith
  for Luna Stage and Richard Jordan Productions, the play is at its most
  affecting when it reveals the vulnerable boys behind the damaged adults. If
  there is hope for a polarised culture, this is where it lies. There is
  humanity and understanding here – joining a far-right brotherhood may be a
  rational choice if your life depends on it – but Rift lets the audience off
  lightly by skirting the most awkward questions. At the Traverse, Edinburgh,
  until 24 August. All our Edinburgh festival reviews
