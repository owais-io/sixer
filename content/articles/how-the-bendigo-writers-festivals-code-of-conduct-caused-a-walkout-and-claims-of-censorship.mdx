  Last Wednesday, just two days before opening, Bendigo writers’ festival sent
  its lineup of more than 90 participants an email that would end up derailing
  the three-day event. The email contained a code of conduct, including
  directions to “avoid language or topics that could be considered inflammatory,
  divisive, or disrespectful”. Speakers on panels presented by festival sponsor
  La Trobe University were also required to comply with La Trobe’s anti-racism
  plan, including the contentious definition of antisemitism adopted by
  Universities Australia in February. The response was swift. By Thursday
  evening, high-profile participants including the Palestinian Australian author
  and academic Dr Randa Abdel-Fattah and the Stella prize-winning First Nations
  poet Dr Evelyn Araluen had withdrawn from the festival, citing censorship
  concerns. And by Friday afternoon, about 30 participants had pulled out,
  including high-profile authors such as the La Trobe University academic Prof
  Clare Wright, Paul Daley, Jock Serong, Thomas Mayo and Jess Hill, forcing the
  cancellation of the opening night address. On Monday, BWF confirmed to
  Guardian Australia that 53 participants had withdrawn, resulting in 22
  sessions – a third of the program – being cancelled, including the closing
  ceremony on Sunday night. The boycott and controversy are the latest in a
  string of high-profile tussles over freedom of expression involving
  pro-Palestine artists, including the sacking (and reinstatement) of Lebanese
  Australian artist Khaled Sabsabi as Australia’s representative to the Venice
  Biennale, and the stripping of a government-funded writing fellowship from the
  First Nations author K A Ren Wyld. Writers’ festivals have become fraught
  events, but never before has a backlash been so swift or produced such
  debilitating results as in Bendigo. ‘A vote of no confidence’ On Monday, the
  festival said it was still tallying the cost of refunding tickets – but the
  reputational damage had already been deeply felt. Its founding director,
  Rosemary Sorensen, accused the festival of exercising an “authoritarian abuse
  of power”; Noongar author Claire G Coleman called the code of conduct
  “condescending and insulting”; and Abdel-Fattah, sharing her withdrawal letter
  on Instagram, wrote: “At a time when journalists are being permanently
  silenced by Israel’s genocidal forces, it is incomprehensible that a writers’
  festival should also seek to silence Palestinian voices.” Samuel Cairnduff, a
  lecturer in culture and communication at the University of Melbourne,
  described the mass withdrawal as “a vote of no confidence in institutional
  leadership that has forgotten why it exists”. Abdel-Fattah had been scheduled
  to appear on a La Trobe-sponsored panel titled On Reckonings, speaking about
  her new novel Discipline, which reflects on the silencing of Palestinians in
  academia and the media. “How ironic that they would invite me, knowing what my
  book is about, on a panel called ‘reckonings’, where I’m going to be
  discussing a book on silencing Palestinians – and then attempt to silence me,”
  she told Guardian Australia. Abdel-Fattah said her withdrawal was more than a
  matter of principle. After receiving the code of conduct, she believed
  participating in the BWF “would have resulted … in some kind of media coverage
  demonising me”. She believes this is part of a larger move to silence
  Palestinian voices. “[For] most institutions and organisations, it becomes a
  cost-benefit risk analysis: I become a Palestinian who is dealt with in terms
  of risk. I’m a risk management crisis.” A festival spokesperson said: “The
  City [of Greater Bendigo which runs the festival] and La Trobe University, as
  the Festival’s Presenting Partner, agreed to issue a one-page Code of Conduct
  to emphasise the importance of safety and wellbeing for all participants.” The
  code of conduct “was never intended to silence anyone, but rather to allow
  discussions to happen while ensuring the safe participation and inclusion of
  everyone,” the spokesperson said. BWF did not respond directly to Guardian
  Australia’s questions about whether the code of conduct was issued at the
  request of La Trobe, instead directing questions to the university. Nor did
  BWF respond to a question about why the code was sent just two days before the
  festival opened. A spokesperson for the university said: “La Trobe will always
  take seriously any concerns raised about community safety and inclusion –
  including cultural safety – and we welcome feedback on our public events and
  engagement.” On Monday, it was revealed that the Australian Academic Alliance
  Against Antisemitism, or 5A, group wrote to La Trobe and BWF in July, urging
  them to “implement immediate measures” concerning the inclusion of
  Abdel-Fattah; and characterising her as a person who “perpetually dehumanises
  people who hold Zionist views”. It’s not clear whether the letter played any
  part in the decision to issue the code of conduct, and La Trobe and BWF
  refused to comment on the matter. The risks of risk management The timing of
  the email announcing the code has been criticised as well as its content.
  “When you consider how long ago I was invited to the festival, [this] was an
  unacceptably short time to consider such a change,” Coleman said in her letter
  to the festival, shared on Instagram. Cairnduff wrote that the festival’s
  last-minute approach is part of a broader trend of late-stage risk mitigation
  – “a governance approach that frequently generates greater controversy than it
  prevents because it fundamentally alters the terms of engagement after
  commitments have been made”. Louise Adler, the director of Adelaide Writers’
  Week, which has faced criticism and withdrawal of sponsorship over its
  programming of Palestinian and pro-Palestine authors, says the BWF “debacle”
  is “symptomatic of the current environment” in the arts. Other high profile
  controversies included actors wearing keffiyehs at a Sydney Theatre Company
  curtain call; pianist Jayson Gillham suing the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra
  for cancelling one of his concerts, after he made a statement criticising
  Israel’s targeting of journalists in Gaza; and the National Gallery of
  Australia covering up two Palestinian flags in a textile work by the Aotearoa
  New Zealand collective SaVĀge K’lub. “We have witnessed a succession of
  pre-emptive buckles by arts managers second-guessing risk-averse boards who
  collectively (with management) are concerned about the reputational damage,
  the withdrawal of desperately needed sponsorship, and the relentless media
  campaigns that lobby groups can and do orchestrate with the help of News Ltd,”
  Adler says. “The arts community needs boards that have courage and [who]
  understand their role, the importance of curatorial independence and that the
  artists who choose to work with these organisations are entitled to
  full-throated and unwavering support.” Adler says the Adelaide writers’
  festival’s code of conduct is limited to “compliance with Australian laws
  regarding racial discrimination, vilification, hate speech and incitement to
  violence”. “During my tenure there has not been a single incident requiring
  intervention,” she says. Denis Muller, a senior research fellow with the
  University of Melbourne’s Centre for Advancing Journalism, describes the
  festival’s code of conduct as “extremely vague and oppressive”, one that “no
  self-respecting journalist or writer is going to adhere to”. “The body politic
  in Australia is in the process of recalibrating the whole idea of where moral
  authority rests in the Middle East. This is a period of transition, and it’s
  extremely tense,” he says. In a previous piece for the Conversation, Muller
  wrote about the “fraught position” writers’ festivals are now in: “They
  navigate the frontier between social media’s echo chambers of outrage and the
  traditional public square’s conventions, where restraint, reason and tolerance
  in the face of opposing views are the basis for civilised debate.” The lessons
  from Bendigo Cairnduff says there are lessons for institutions in how they
  communicate with and consult artists – but argues a more fundamental reckoning
  needs to occur. “Arts organisations should be questioning what kinds of
  restrictions that they – as platforms for creative people – should be
  imposing,” he says. “The idea of arts and cultural expression is about freedom
  of expression and engaging in some of those more challenging and difficult
  areas of a broader social discourse … restricting speech and freedom of
  expression – that’s exactly the antithesis of what a cultural organisation in
  contemporary Australian society should be doing.” On the opening night of
  Adelaide writers’ week in 2023, as the festival faced criticism over the
  inclusion of a Palestinian speaker and a Palestinian-American speaker, the
  South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, admitted he had been under
  immense pressure to axe its funding – had even considered it – but decided it
  would set a dangerous precedent if a government determined who was allowed to
  speak. “If I was to unilaterally defund writers’ week … what path does that
  take us down?” he said. “It’s a path to a future where politicians decide what
  is culturally appropriate … a path, in fact, that leads us into the territory
  of Putin’s Russia.” Adler told the Guardian at the time: “These matters are
  complex. None of this is simple. “People are free to deeply object. They don’t
  have to come. Or come, and you don’t need to agree with what people think. But
  people listened. These steadfast Adelaide audiences came out in their
  thousands and listened with courtesy and respect for the conversation. It
  should be something that lifts the spirits of all of us.”
