  Britain’s biggest police force is to more than double its use of live facial
  recognition to up to 10 deployments a week. The move by the Metropolitan
  police comes as it restructures to cover the loss of 1,400 officers and 300
  staff amid budget shortages. Live facial recognition – which involves the
  matching of faces caught on surveillance camera footage against a police
  watchlist in real time – will now be used up to 10 times a week across five
  days, up from the current four times a week across two days. The tactic will
  be deployed at the Notting Hill carnival over the August bank holiday. An
  older form of the technology was trialled at the event in 2016 and 2017.
  Earlier this month, the Met revealed it had made 1,000 arrests using live
  facial recognition to date, of which 773 had led to a charge or caution.
  Charlie Whelton, a policy and campaigns officer at Liberty, said: “It’s
  incredibly concerning to see an expansion of facial recognition, especially at
  a time when there is a complete lack of regulation governing its use. “Any
  tech which has the potential to infringe on our rights in the way scanning and
  identifying millions of people does needs to have robust safeguards around its
  use, including ensuring that proper independent oversight is in place. “The
  government must legislate now to regulate this technology, protect people’s
  rights, and make sure that the law on facial recognition does not get outpaced
  by the use.” The Met commissioner, Mark Rowley, said the technology was used
  responsibly. He said: “We’re only using it to look for serious offenders like
  wanted offenders and registered sex offenders. “We routinely put it out there
  and capture multiple serious offenders in one go, many of whom have committed
  serious offences against women or children, or people who are wanted for armed
  robbery. “It’s a fantastic piece of technology. It’s very responsibly used,
  and that’s why most of the public support it.” Part of the Met’s overhaul will
  see officers moved to bulk up the force’s public order crime team, as the
  force said it has faced increased demand linked to protest-related crimes in
  the past two years. The squad will go from 48 to 63 officers due to a rise in
  the number of protests, particularly related to Israel and Palestine, as well
  as environmental issues. Last month, retailers warned that major high streets
  such as Oxford Street in the West End of London were at risk without urgent
  national action on crime. While shoplifting hit a record high in 2024, with
  the number of offences exceeding 500,000 for the first time, High Streets UK,
  a group that represents 5,000 UK businesses, called for wider action to deal
  with all types of crime affecting high streets. In May, a joint investigation
  by the Guardian and Liberty Investigates found that police believe live facial
  recognition cameras may become “commonplace” in England and Wales, according
  to internal documents, with the number of faces scanned having doubled to
  nearly 5m in the last year. Police forces scanned nearly 4.7m faces with the
  technology last year, more than twice as many as in 2023. Live facial
  recognition vans were deployed at least 256 times in 2024, according to
  official deployment records, up from 63 the year before. Forces almost doubled
  the number of retrospective facial recognition searches made last year using
  the police national database (PND) from 138,720 in 2023 to 252,798. The PND
  contains custody mugshots, millions of which have been found to be stored
  unlawfully, of people who have never been charged with or convicted of an
  offence. The Home Office has been working with the police to establish a new
  national facial recognition system, known as strategic facial matcher. The
  platform will be capable of searching a range of databases including custody
  images and immigration records.
