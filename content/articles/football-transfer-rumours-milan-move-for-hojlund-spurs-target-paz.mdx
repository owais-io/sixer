  Farewell, Benjamin Sesko. The Slovene has been churned through the Mill but is
  finally moving past the tittle-tattle to something more concrete. He’s on the
  way to Manchester United, such a great, welcoming place in recent years for
  developing forwards. Godspeed. What does this mean for Newcastle, who were in
  for him too and are in dire need of anyone, anyone, to walk through the door?
  They continue to be linked with Chelsea’s Nicolas Jackson and Brentford’s
  Yoane Wissa, while the Daily Mail says Wolves’ Jørgen Strand Larsen is in
  their thoughts, too. Uncertainty lingers over their prized possession,
  Alexander Isak, denied the joys of the grill but, claims the Times, still
  desired by Liverpool – even after their £110m offer was rejected. With Sesko
  the new leading man at Old Trafford, Rasmus Højlund’s future comes into
  question; Milan could be the answer, potentially taking the former Atalanta
  striker back to Serie A. Chelsea are developing a habit for United wingers:
  Jadon Sancho on loan last year, Alejandro Garnacho this time round, with
  perhaps more permanence. The Argentinian international has apparently been
  given a price tag of £50m. Bournemouth have had their impressive backline
  picked apart by the big boys. Illia Zabarnyi finds himself on the way to Paris
  Saint-Germain after the departures of Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid and Milos
  Kerkez to Liverpool, as well as the end of Kepa Arrizabalaga’s loan. But the
  French connection goes both ways. Lille’s Bafodé Diakité is getting lined up
  for a move to the south coast. Bournemouth are also having to deal with
  interest in their forward line; Dango Ouattara has reportedly caught the
  attention of Brentford after seven goals and four assists in the league last
  season. Tottenham, shorn of the services of James Maddison for the near future
  after his anterior cruciate ligament injury, are said to like the look of the
  Como midfielder Nico Paz, though the Cesc Fàbregas-run outfit like him exactly
  where he is. Ademola Lookman has made clear he wants out of Atalanta after
  “many months of broken promises”, with Inter launching bids for the
  London-born forward. But how about a return to the capital? Some are chucking
  Arsenal’s name into the mix of interested parties. John McGinn was mentioned
  on these pages on Thursday as an option for Newcastle – anyone, please, anyone
  – but the Athletic says Aston Villa are ready to talk about a new deal for
  their skipper.
