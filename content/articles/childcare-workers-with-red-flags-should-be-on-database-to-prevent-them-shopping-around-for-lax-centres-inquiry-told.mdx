  The head of the New South Wales police child sexual abuse squad has called for
  the creation of a national database of childcare workers who have had “red
  flags” raised that fall short of criminal prosecution. Giving evidence before
  a government inquiry into the early childhood education sector in NSW, Det
  Supt Linda Howlett said such a database would allow centres to share
  intelligence about former employees who have faced serious allegations that
  didn’t result in criminal charges. They are still allowed to work with
  children. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “I personally would like to see a
  database that actually has all those red flags included in it,” Howlett said
  on Thursday. “At the end of the day, the offenders that we’ve actually
  charged, and a number of them are quite high profile, have never had a
  criminal history. They have a working with children check and that’s the
  issue.” Howlett’s call goes significantly further than the proposed “national
  register” of childcare workers that has been put forward by the federal
  education minister, Jason Clare, in the wake of horrifying allegations of
  sexual abuse of children at daycares across Melbourne by a childcare worker.
  Clare has suggested a register – containing details of staff and where they
  have worked – would assist in protecting children. However, a Guardian
  investigation last month revealed that most childcare workers who are reported
  to police or the childcare regulators for allegations of child abuse are
  allowed to continue working with children, because police and childcare
  regulators struggle to block them from continued employment if the claim
  doesn’t result in a criminal conviction. A 2023 review of the childcare
  regulatory system, conducted by the Australian Children’s Education and Care
  Quality Authority (Acecqa), found many cases of alleged abuse came down to “a
  child’s word against an educator’s” resulting in “unsubstantiated claims where
  no further action is taken”. Childcare services “have no way to share this
  information with another approved provider considering employing that person
  unless they are contacted as a referee,” it said. Howlett said that she
  understood there were legal and privacy issues regarding any database that
  tracked allegations that had not been proven. But she said child safety
  concerns should take precedence. She said perpetrators “need access to the
  children, that’s the main aim, and they will do anything to get that”. “So
  they’ll stay under the radar … what they’ll do is they shop around. They’ll
  look for centres that aren’t doing the right thing, and that’s where they have
  the opportunity to offend.” Howlett said some of red flags that might be noted
  on a database could include people who work across many centres, whom she said
  may be “centre shopping”; as well as reasons people have been fired from a
  previous childcare centre. It could also detail any allegations about their
  behaviour. “Obviously, we can’t crucify people. You know, people have got
  their rights … but that’s why I think a database should exist … so then that
  information should be recorded,” she said. Rachael Ward, the acting children’s
  guardian for NSW, said it could be beneficial to implement a register for
  childcare workers similar to the one for the out-of-home care system in NSW.
  “We have an out-of-home care register, which has a flag system … and that does
  alert other out-of-home care providers if there is a red flag. “It just means
  ‘contact me for further information’. It doesn’t say what the allegations are,
  it’s just that ‘I have … information that may be of use to you if you’re going
  to employ this person’. I do wonder if there would be a register that could be
  created in a similar vein.” Howlett warned that parents who suspect their
  children have been abused at a childcare centre should not notify the centre
  director – but instead go straight to police or the regulator to report
  incidents. “My advice to parents and my advice to anyone would be, do not
  approach the director of the centre,” said Howlett. “They shouldn’t be doing
  that, as far as I’m concerned, they’re tipping off the educator or the centre
  about what’s taken place.” Howlett said that childcare directors who receive
  reports of abuse from parents may act out of “self-preservation” and
  potentially downplay the allegations and seek to discourage parents from
  official reporting. “I’m sorry, I’m probably a little cynical, but the
  director, first of all, doesn’t want to lose the business. Money’s involved
  and they don’t want this centre to get a bad reputation.”
