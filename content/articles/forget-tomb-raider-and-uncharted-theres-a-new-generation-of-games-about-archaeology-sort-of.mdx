  The game I’m most looking forward to right now is Big Walk, the latest title
  from House House, creators of the brilliant Untitled Goose Game. A cooperative
  multiplayer adventure where players are let loose to explore an open world,
  I’m interested to see what emergent gameplay comes out of it. Could Big Walk
  allow for a kind of community archaeology with friends? I certainly hope so.
  When games use environmental storytelling in their design – from the
  positioning of objects to audio recordings or graffiti – they invite players
  to role play as archaeologists. Game designer Ben Esposito infamously joked
  back in 2016 that environmental storytelling is the “art of placing skulls
  near a toilet” – which might have been a jab at the tropes of games like the
  Fallout series, but his quip demonstrates how archaeological gaming narratives
  can be. After all, the incongruity of skulls and toilets is likely to lead to
  many questions and interpretations about the past in that game world, however
  ridiculous. I used to work as an archaeologist in the analogue world, where my
  work consisted of excavations, fieldworks and assessment of potential
  development sites across the UK. Now I’m doing a computer science PhD focusing
  in video game archaeology, where I get to come up with novel ways to record
  gameplay experiences, like doing in-game walking interviews with players in
  the MMO Wurm Online, or recording the location of player messages in Elden
  Ring. Because I know what being an archaeologist entails, I often find myself
  thinking about games that just have you play as a person with that job title,
  such as Tomb Raider or Uncharted, versus those that have you engage in work
  similar to what we do in the field. Walking sims like Gone Home and What
  Remains of Edith Finch invite you to explore a space and interpret what all of
  the objects left behind in the landscape mean. Dr Melissa Kagen, assistant
  teaching professor in interactive media and game development at Worcester
  Polytechnic Institute, refers to this interpretive gameplay in walking
  simulators as “archival adventuring”. It’s not just walking sims though. There
  is a growing genre of puzzle games that I would argue also puts you in the
  role of an archaeologist, piecing together clues about the past from material
  remains and archival material. Some people refer to these games as
  “Metroidbranias”, but I’m personally quite fond of them. Essentially,
  “information games” (as developer Tom Francis calls them) require players to
  come up with theories based on the information they have, to in turn use those
  theories to acquire more knowledge. With its central mechanic of deciphering
  an ancient language, Heaven’s Vault is an obvious candidate, but I would argue
  that other information games like Return of the Obra Dinn, Her Story and Outer
  Wilds (which literally has a special “archaeologist edition”) also encourage
  you to role play as an archaeologist, searching for clues in the environment
  and past records. In my own work I investigate how to preserve contemporary
  games, as carefully as you would an ancient artefact. So I’ve been thinking a
  lot about parallels in the game world too: how players record their own
  experiences through screenshots, map-making and diaries, and these are also
  methods used by real world archaeologists. Some games use these recording
  methods as central game mechanics. A great example is Season: A Letter to the
  Future, in which you document the world on the eve of its destruction in your
  journal. Games that inspire you to take notes also arguably result in a record
  of the gameplay experience – a good example is 2025’s puzzle sensation Blue
  Prince, which explicitly encourages players to record anything interesting
  they see in each of the clue-filled rooms as they explore an ever-shifting
  estate. Rather than raiding tombs, if you want to be a video game
  archaeologist, look out for those skulls next to toilets. Better yet, record
  them. A future games archaeologist will thank you! What to play We’re seeing a
  lot of classic 80s arcade games being rediscovered at the moment, with Gradius
  Origins pleasing shoot-em-’up purists and Bandai Namco’s Shadow Labyrinth
  thrillingly reimagining Pac-Man. Next, here comes Sega with Shinobi: Art of
  Vengeance, a compulsive and stylish adventure platformer based on its classic
  series of ninja brawlers. A vast range of fighting skills, weapons and combos
  come into play as you leap across hand-drawn cyberpunk environments, all rich
  in detail. French developer Lizardcube has done amazing work marrying the old
  school immediacy of the original titles with modern features and considerable
  Gallic visual flair. Come for the nostalgia, stay for the blistering execution
  moves, which let you take out multiple enemies in a claret-soaked dance of
  death. Available on: PC, PS4/5, Xbox Estimated playtime: 15 hours What to read
  Want to find out more about Nintendo’s approach to game design? Forthcoming
  book Super Nintendo, from Pushing Buttons’s own Keza MacDonald, is now
  available for pre-order. It’s an in-depth look behind the scenes at the
  legendary game and console maker, with incredible access to the design teams,
  including Miyamoto himself. Essential stuff. Over 450 Diablo developers have
  voted to unionise, according to theCommunications Workers of America union. As
  Team 3 Senior Software Engineer Nav Bhetti puts it: “My entire career as a
  developer has seen my peers and I paying the ‘passion tax’ for working in an
  industry that we love.” Have you heard of “friendslop”? Nicole Carpenter dives
  into the emerging genre of social games such as Peak, Lethal Company and
  Content Warning, and asks what developers can learn from their emphasis on
  essentially messing about with your mates. What to click Ghost of Yōtei
  preview – a determined outsider seeks revenge in feudal Japan Little Problems
  preview – a cute detective game with no violence or victims Mythmatch preview
  – taking on ancient Greek tech bros to rebuild a broken world The Séance of
  Blake Manor preview – a gothic horror that explores the creepier side of Irish
  mythology Esoteric Ebb: a Dungeons &amp; Dragons-style campaign that lets you
  be as stupid as you like Keeper is the ecological ‘fever dream’ where you play
  as – checks notes – a lighthouse Question Block This week’s straightforward
  question comes from Richard B via email: “Are the console wars over?” This is
  a question the whole industry seems to be pondering at the moment. In
  February, Xbox chief, Phil Spencer, told XboxEra that he was no longer looking
  to take gamers from PlayStation or PC. Three months later, the previously
  exclusive title Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was released on PS5, and
  Gears of War: Reloaded is also bound for Sony’s platform. Meanwhile, Sony has
  brought Helldivers 2 to Xbox and more titles are likely to follow, if a
  recently spotted Sony job advert is to be believed. Of course, cross play –
  the feature of online games such as Fortnite and Apex Legends which allows
  people to compete against each other whatever machine they’re using – started
  us off in this direction. Now, in an industry where smartphone gaming is
  dominating (figures by NewZoo indicate mobile games were worth $92.5bn to the
  global economy in 2024, compared to $50.3bn for console), and the idea of two
  games hardware titans expensively competing on proprietary tech and software
  exclusives seems increasingly anachronistic. And yet … Gamers are
  intrinsically territorial and always have been, while brand loyalty is a key
  facet of fandom (and, let’s face it, capitalism) – see also Nikon v Canon,
  Nike v Reebok or Android v iPhone. Tech specs are only ever part of these
  conflicts – style, image and identity come into play too. So don’t expect Xbox
  and PlayStation to, in the near future, become mere apps on a multitude of
  faceless platforms. Several battles may be over, but the war lumbers on. If
