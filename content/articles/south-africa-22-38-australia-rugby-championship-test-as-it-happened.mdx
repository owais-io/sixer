  I’m sorry folks. I can’t find any reaction from the players or coaches. Maybe
  that’ll be a relief to Springboks fans. Those in the ground looked shell
  shocked. They saw their team take a 22-0 lead on 18 minutes and, like me, must
  have expected a romp. They got one alright, just not the sort that was
  promised on the tin. Australia were brilliant. Totally and utterly brilliant.
  They deserve to celebrate long into the night having secure victory in
  Johannesburg for the first time in the professional era. Where do the Boks go
  from here? We’ll find out next week if they’ve righted the many wrongs as the
  two teams once again square up in Cape Town. I’ll be there to call it live.
  Hope you’ll join me. Here’s the match report from the wire. Keep an eye out
  for some analysis from yours truly. See you next week! The live feed from Sky
  has just cut out. I’ll try get some reaction quotes from the players elsewhere
  before I close shop. If you’ve got any thoughts on this stunning upset I’d
  love to read them. HenryC has written in adding to the theme: “Thanks to the
  Boks for putting the Lions victory in perspective!!” ‘Maybe puts the Lions’
  achievements into perspective!’ That’s a to-the-point email from Iain Moore.
  Australia have done it! Totally deserve this. They kept South Africa scoreless
  for more than an hour and absolutely hammered them. Six tries to three.
  Complete dominance at the breakdown, some blistering scores, resolute defence,
  just brilliant. Well done Australia. 80 min: The Springboks fans are utterly
  stunned. I don’t think one of them saw this coming. Not in their darkest
  nightmares…. 79 min: One last chance for more? The Wallabies have the line-out
  within touching distance after another penalty call goes their way. They set
  the maul then go through the hands. McDermott snipes. Five out… GAME OVER! The
  fans are shocked! Stunned silence at Ellis Park as Wright counters after an
  Esterhuizen fumble in Australia’s half. The fullback runs upfield, easily
  beats Willemse’s weak tackle and slides over. Unbelieveble. O’Connor slams
  home the conversion from the right tram. This is a hiding for the world
  champions on their own patch. 75 min: Frost plucks the line-out and Gleeson,
  on off the pine, canters upfield. 73 min: McReight has won yet another penalty
  on the ground inside his 22. That is the game. That is why Australia are going
  to win in Johannesburg for the first time since 1963. Unbelievable effort from
  the Wallabies. 71 min: Australia steal another line-out. We knew they’d be a
  handful at the breakdown but did we foresee their presence at the set piece?
  They fully deserve their lead. South Africa are now back on halfway. Reinach
  kicks. Moodie wins it but there’s a South African knock-on. Wright kicks it
  but it goes straight out so South Africa have a line-out just beyond
  Australia’s 22. They have to score from here or it’ll be game over. 70 min:
  Australia win the ball, yet again, inside their own 22. This followed a
  Reinach burst around the fringe. They now have an 11 point lead and have 11
  minutes to defend it. 68 min: The camera cuts to Erasmus and he looks utterly
  shocked. His team need to pull this out of the fire and they need to do it
  quick fast. NO WAY!!! I cannot believe what I’m seeing. South Africa kick-off
  and the Wallabies just scream up field with slick hands and accurate passing
  and there Jorgensen is, on the right wing, beating his man and running clear
  through for a try. How on earth has this happened!? Australia have simply been
  immense! South Africa are falling apart. O’Connor ignores the boos and slots
  the conversion from out wide. WHAT IS GOING ON!? My word, who saw this coming?
  This is remarkable. Australia are rampant. Wright wriggled past three tacklers
  from his own half and just kept going. He had Wilson in support to his right
  and the skipper was away, holding off challengers with a hand-off before
  sliding under the poles. O’Connor can’t miss from there and Australia are 15
  minutes away from a very famous win. 63 min: The world champions have to dig
  deep here. They’ve not had it their own way and haven’t scored a point since
  the 18th minute. Libbok lifts a cross kick which Arendse spills in the air.
  Australia have another knock-on advantage and are countering… 60 min: That try
  is a result of the Boks’ growing frustrations. Libbok tried to force the
  issue. They know they should be well clear and have left plenty of points on
  the cutting room floor. Full credit to the Wallabies. Other teams would have
  folded after going 22-0 down in Johannesburg. Momentum is with them now as
  South Africa cough up more possession as Mbonambi, on for Marx, chucks a
  line-out skew so the Wallabies have the scrum on halfway. Joseph picks Manie’s
  pocket! The young superstar has plucked an intercept and sprinted clear of the
  chasing Boks. He had Williams and van der Merwe, two of the quickest South
  Africans around, cashing him. But he breezed clear. O’Connor slots the
  conversion and we have a game on! Wow, the Wallabies have shown immense
  spirit. They are growing in this and you wouldn’t bet against them from here.
  Anyone have a baker who serves humble pie? I might have to put an order in. 56
  min: Again slick handling and passing, as well as strong carries through the
  phases, take South Africa to within touching distance of the Australian try
  line. Again they leave empty handed. This time it’s a knock-on from Williams
  as he cantered upfield to offer support for Willemse and van der Merwe.
  Earlier du Toit showed great work in the left tram with Mostert also carrying
  well. But close is not good enough. Australia are still in this. 54 min: What
  a let off for South Africa. The Aussies have their line-out pinched. The
  Springboks go down the line and get the ball to Willemse, on the field, but
  the pass is wayward so Australia have a line-out. The Wallabies can’t keep it
  tidy themselves and knock on soon after. It all ends with the Boks having the
  scrum feed about 10 metres inside their own half. 52 min: Jorgense plucks a
  bouncing ball from a kick ahead and he’s tearing upfield! Now Australia have a
  penalty advantage. They’re going through the hands as the ball spirals from
  left to right. They’re swarming forward until the move is stifled by van
  Staden who is pinged for being off-side. All Australia now. Can they get the
  ball bacl down the left. They can, but the pass to Jorgensen isn’t accurate
  and Arendse catches it. No matter, they have the penalty which is nudged to
  the corner. O’Keefe gives a team warning. One more indiscretion and he’ll
  bring out the yellow card. 50 min: Another penalty on the ground for
  Australia! Hooper with the steal about two metres from his own line. That is
  massive. First the Wallabies line-out maul held firm which forced Williams to
  go down the line. Marx and Etzebeth had charges but couldn’t make the ground
  before Hooper swooped in to nick the ball on the deck. Wonderful from the
  Aussies who have held on in this fight. 49 min: Water is wet. South Africa win
  a scrum penalty. Libbok nudges it to the corner. But we’ll wait while Ikitau
  receives treatment for a “serious injury,” as O’Keefe calls it. 47 min: Wright
  almost plucks a worldie grab that would have seen him score upfield! Libbok
  unfurled a cross-kick, looking for van der Merwe on the right wing, but Wright
  beat the Bok winger to the ball and almost held on inside his own 22. If he
  had, my money was him going the distance. As it is we’ll have a South African
  scrum all the way on the right inside Australia’s patch. 47 min: White hoofs a
  box kick after the Aussie scrum held firm. White is having a great game. 45
  min: Pieter-Steph du Toit knocks on at the base of a ruck about five metres
  short of the Wallabies line! That was really good from the Boks before then.
  Williams and Libbok sniped through gaps around the fringe. Du Toit had the
  ball in the left tram and made good ground. They kept coming and Williams was
  fizzing passes, but when du Toit came in to keep the move alive and possible
  go for a dart himself, he spilled it. Australia scrum with Wilson’s heels
  touching his own line. What a line from the skipper! Excellent from Wilson who
  hit the line to perfection, collecting Bell’s short pass that totally
  flummoxed the Boks defence. Earlier Bell, on at half-time, muscled Marx with a
  strong carry to give the Wallabies go forward after the line-out. O’Connor
  hits the conversion and we have a game on. Can Australia continue to boss the
  breakdown and cause trouble at the line-out? 42 min: I asked how the Wallabies
  can get a way back into this and we’ve just seen the roadmap. South Africa
  lose another line-out – their fourth of the game – and give away a penalty on
  the ground having lost the ball in the air. Add all three of those variables
  together and you have Australia with a line-out in the Boks 22. They have to
  make this count. And we’re back! I’m not sure how the Wallabies get back in
  this. They’ve won the breakdown battle but they’ve not managed to dominate the
  gainline either with their carries or through finding an edge. The Boks look
  more imposing either side of the ball. Perhaps the introduction of Gleeson and
  a switch to a higher tempo might help? But then where does the punch in the
  tight channels come from? Skelton hasn’t been as imposing as he was against
  the Lions. Different gravy against South African meat. The ball is spilled in
  the line-out and White kicks it out. That brings an end to a one-sided half
  that looked like being a lot worse for the Wallabies when Kolisi scored his
  team’s third try after just 18 minutes. The Springboks were imperious before
  the Wallabies fought back and bagged a try of their own. The tourists have a
  mountain to climb, but thanks to swift work at the breakdown and some fight in
  patches, they can at least see the summit. Back in a bit. 40 min: South
  Africa’s pack consumes the Wallabies in the scrum. They get the advantage and
  spiral the ball down the line. Fassi joins from fullback and stands up a
  tackler before off-loading. He can’t stitch the move together. Kriel mops up
  and straightens the attack but it goes nowhere. They come back for the penalty
  which Libbok nudges a little closer to the corner. 38 min: Frost nips in and
  wins a South African throw. O’Connor then gathers and launches a monster kick.
  It bounces. And keeps bouncing. And keeps bouncing until it goes out of play
  at the far end of the pitch. That’s so unlucky because it means South Africa
  will get the scrum from where O’Connor kicked it, which is just beyond the
  Aussie 22 with a short blind on the right. 36 min: Ten phases and the Boks
  come within inches of the Australian line. Libbok and Williams were made to
  work swiftly thanks to aggressive Wallaby defence, but brilliant play from
  Etzebeth, Esterhuizen and du Toit, as well as Kolisi who has been hovering in
  space in the tram all game, means the Boks make metres. Things fray at the
  seams eventually before Libbok floats a wide pass right. Kolisi charges and
  feeds Esterhuisen who is isolated a metre short. Wright and Ikitau make the
  hit and win the ball back. There’s a penalty call – holding on I think,
  actually, no idea – and O’Connor can hoof it long. South Africa have been
  really good through the phases. They look menacing the longer these moves
  stretch on. No dice this time, though. 33 min: Really good from Australia.
  Penalty kick becomes a line-out which becomes a break down the line.
  Jorgensen, off his wing, found Kellaway in the left tram with a floater. He
  burst down upfield and nudged ahead for Ikitau. Arendse had to scamper across
  and clean up. Luckily for the Boks, the kick bobbled over the try-line so
  Arendse could fall on it and win back possession. After the early blitz the
  Wallabies have grown into the contest. 31 min: After scoring the try,
  Australia show composure and exit well. A long kick pins the Boks back. But
  they’re upfield once more thanks to Kolisi gathering a Marx line-out over the
  top. Ezterhuizen is now on the charge, carrying Ikitau on his back as he
  motors through the gears. Pietsch cops a Kolisi shoulder to the face. This
  could be a broken jaw. He’s been replaced by Kellaway. It wasn’t illegal, just
  the sudden change of direction which meant the Aussie winger was in a bad
  position to make the tackle. Australia do get a penalty, though, after an
  obstruction call following the Ezterhuizen break. That’s much better from the
  Wallabies! They had the advantage, yet again winning a penalty as a Bok
  strayed off side. They kept it in the hands before Ikitau stood up a tackler
  in front of him and created space to his left. The ball just needed to go down
  the hands, which it did, and find Pietsch. The winger with the shaved head had
  a simple run to the corner, though O’Connor couldn’t convert from out wide. 27
  min: A fourth breakdown penalty goes Australia’s way. First Jorgensen plucked
  a high kick in the right tram and off-loaded back infield. He couldn’t find a
  mate and Marx grabbed the loose ball. But the South African hooker was
  isolated and picked off on the ground. Australia have to make this territory
  count as they go for another line-out in the Boks 22. 24 min: Another penalty
  on the ground for the Wallabies. That is one area where they’re at least
  holding their own. Three breakdown penalties in a row going their way.
  O’Connor kicks long again and this time SA don’t challenge in the air. A
  little kick ahead from White makes life difficult for the covering defence
  under their own poles but van der Merwe was across from right win to mop up.
  Great cover. They eventually secure the ball and Libbok nails a spiralling
  kick with his apparent weaker foot, finding touch on halfway from his own
  try-line. 23 min: Solid work from the Boks. Stiff scrum despite the second
  shove from the Wallabies. A couple of big carries – from Esterhuizen and Nche
  – before a Williams raking box kick towards halfway. That is a slick exit. 22
  min: Pollard throws skew! How frustrating. Etzebeth jumps up to make it a
  contest which means the throw has to be straight. It’s not. So it;s a scrum to
  the Boks. 21 min: Australia get a penalty in front of the posts just outside
  the SA 22. Skelton around the corner attracted three tacklers and one of them
  strayed off-side after not rolling away. That was more like it from Australia
  with Ikitau also involved. O’Connor nudges this penalty towards the corner. No
  choice but to go for it. 20 min: Suaalii has a bloody nose, embodying the
  battering his team has copped so far. But McReight is holding his own and
  comes up with another steal on the ground. The visitors need to get a grip
  here. O’Connor bangs a long touch finder. They need a solid attacking set from
  this line-out. Just relentless. Even after McReight stole the ball the Boks
  kept hammering the line. They’re insatiable this afternoon. The intensity is
  just insane as wave after wave of green carriers crash over gold tacklers.
  Arendse, then Etzebeth and then Kolisi with the finishing touches right under
  the poles. Nothing intricate to analyse there/. It’s just raw power from the
  Boks skipper. Libbok slots it over from bang in front. 18 min: McReight makes
  a huge steal on the ground after 10 South African phases. But the Boks have it
  back, the Wallaby didn’t have any support. It’s a little scrappy as Libbok
  flings a pass left. Arendse picks up the bouncing ball. There’s a penalty
  advantage of a high tackle… 16 min: Australia can’t get over the gainline.
  Skelton and then Wilson are hammered in contact. O’Connor has no choice but to
  go to the boot, raking a grubber towards the South African 22. It’s a good
  kick that puts the home team under pressure. Etzebeth wins the line-out and
  then Arendse beats Jorgensen in the air so SA have it on halfway. Kolisi finds
  Fassi. Kriel gets past the gainline. Nche rumbles over Tupou. The supporting
  cast at the clear-out is effective. They continue make progress and a strong
  drive from van Staden has them up to the 22. Stunning from the Springboks! And
  that’s Esterhuizen’s first try for his country. And what a try. Coast to
  coast, Kriel found an edge and slipped a tackle down the right, beating White
  who couldn’t lay a glove on him. Kriel passed inside for the supporting du
  Toit who then fed Esterhuizen looping round from midfield with an off-load.
  Just so slick from the world champions. Australia can’t live with them at the
  moment. Libbok hits the post so can’t add the extras. 11 min: Back and forth!
  Pietsch knocks on after winning the ball in the air. The Boks don’t capitalise
  and Fassi makes an aimless kick straight to Wright. O’Connor is smoked in
  midfield and spills the ball. Marx hacks it ahead where van der Merwe gathers
  and runs down the right tram. Pietsch scampers back and makes a great recover
  tackle, nudging the Boks winger out of touch. A breathless passage ends with a
  Wallaby throw and White hoofing it long. Easy swing of the right boot and it’s
  over. He’s had his problems from the tee but that’s two from two for Manie. 7
  min: The Aussie scrum holds and they manage to get the ball up to the edge of
  the 22 with a strong carry. White clears with a lengthy box that finds touch
  just inside his own half. Australia then pinch the line-out. Esterhuizen lands
  a big blow in midfield so kills momentum before Marx makes amends with a
  well-timed steal on the ground after thumping Wilson with a tackle. Penalty to
  South Africa about 40 metres out and right in front of the poles. South Africa
  are bossing this. 6 min: Grant Williams has the ball on a string. From the
  line-out he boxes and finds Etzebeth who was always going to win the ball in
  the air. The Williams dinks a kick to the corner and finds Arendse who runs
  straight and hard at Jorgensen. The Aussie makes the tackle and also forces
  the knock on. Wallabies scrum in their own 22 all the way on their right. 5
  min: Australia secure the line-out. They go right then back down the blind on
  the left. Ikitau dinks a kick that finds ground inside the Boks 22. Van der
  Merwe mops up and dopes well to wriggle under the tackle of Pietsch and is
  tackled high. So it’ll be a relieving penalty for South Africa inside their
  own patch. 4 min: A similar kick-off for the Wallabies is fielded by de Jager.
  The Boks keep the ball until Fassi overcooks a kick. The Wallabies get the
  line-out inside SA territory. What a start for the Springboks! It started with
  Wright fumbling a Williams box kick and then it was all momentum. Just about
  every player was involved. Du Toit, Kolisi and more had strong carries until
  the cracks opened. Fassie joined from fullback to play the final pass to his
  left where Arendse had a simple run in. That move went several phases and 70
  metres. Libbok nails the conversion from the left. 1 min: De Jager takes the
  kick-off. Wright spills a box kick so the Boks attack with Libbok to Kriel
  down the right. Van der Merwe makes room off the right wing and the Boks are
  upfield. Kolisi has a stroing carry. They’re up to the Wallabies 22 with du
  Toiut charging… The anthems are done. The team talks are over. The referee Ben
  O’Keefe has the whistle in his mouth. Let’s play! The Impis are making their
  appearance. Want to learn more about the Zulu warriors? I’ve got you covered.
  The live coverage has started on Sky, picking up the South African broadcast
  from SuperSport. Matt Pearce has highlighted the bench splits with the
  Wallabies going 6-2 and the Boks going 5-3. What is this, Freaky Friday?
  Australia are looking for their first win in Johannesburg since 1963. They
  have an aggregate score of 201-107 against in the City of Gold from their six
  games there in the professional era. Their most recent visit ended with a
  35-17 defeat in the first round of the 2019 Championship. Incidentally, the
  Boks had the same midfield combo that game, had the same second row combo ,
  played an attacking fly-half (Elton Jantjies) and had Cobus Reinach coming off
  the bench alongside two other backs. Hey, if it ain’t broke. It’s easy to
  forget that the Wallabies were in the doldrums back in September 2023. The
  pasting they received at the hands of Fiji at the World Cup meant they failed
  to get out of their group. Eddie Jones inevitably got the sack and there were
  questions over whether the code had a future at all. This redemption narrative
  isn’t complete, but it’s on track. The team is on the up. Fans are returning.
  Interesting is rising. The Rugby Championship is another opportunity to keep
  the fire burning. The 35-year-old James O’Connor has been picked at at
  fly-half, playing his first game for Australia in three years. If the veteran
  can get the ball out wide the Aussies will be in business with the combative
  Dylan Pietsch and the slippery Max Jorgensen waiting in the trams. First,
  O’Connor will need front foot ball and here is where the game will be won and
  lost. The back row of skipper Harry Wilso, Tom Hooper and Fraser McReight will
  need to boss their sphere of influence. Keep an eye out for the cameo of Langi
  Gleeson off the bench. Wallabies: 1 – Slipper, 2 – Pollard, 3 – Tupou, 4 –
  Frost, 5 – Skelton, 6 – Hooper, 7 – McReight, 8 – Wilson (c); 9 – White, 10 –
  O’Connor; 11 – Pietsch, 12 – Ikitau, 13 – Suaalii, 14 – Jorgensen; 15 –
  Wright. Replacements: 16 – Paenga-Amosa, 17 – Bell, 18 – Nonggorr, 19 –
  Williams, 20 – Gleeson, 21 – Champion de Crespigny, 22 – McDermott, 23 –
  Kellaway. Rassie Erasmus named his team on Monday and it’s one that promises
  loads of running. Manie Libbok at fly-half will be keen to let the ball sing
  and has a freewheeling scrum-half inside him in Grant Williams, arguably the
  fastest man among the 46 involved today. Siya Kolisi plays at No. 8 and there
  are five forwards and three backs on the bench, a departure from the Bomb
  Squad tactic that has brought so much success over the past six years. Eben
  Etzebeth’s battle with Will Skelton in the tight exchanges could swing the
  contest. Springboks: 1 – Nche, 2 – Marx, 3 – Louw, 4 – Etzebeth, 5 – de Jager,
  6 – van Staden, 7 – du Toit, 8 – Kolisi (c); 9 – Williams, 10 – Libbok; 11 –
  Arendse, 12 – Esterhuizen, 13 – Kriel, 14 – van der Merwe; 15 Fassi.
  Replacements: 16 – Mbonambi, 17 – Wessels, 18 – Ntlabakanye, 19 – Mostert, 20
  – Smith, 21 – Reinach, 22 – Moodie, 23 – Willemse. There’s a saying in cricket
  that you can’t judge a pitch until both sides have had a bat. Here’s my
  equivalent for rugby: You can’t judge the power of a pack until it’s gone toe
  to toe with the Springboks. The Wallabies might have lost the series against
  the British &amp; Irish Lions, but some of their big boys left with
  reputations enhanced. Will Skelton, Rob Valetini, Taniela Tupou, Nick Frost,
  Tom Hooper, Langi Gleeson; where there were concerns about the Aussies ability
  to mix it with big boys there’s now confidence in the tall timber. Well, let’s
  see how hard they really are. Because bullying the Lions is one thing.
  Standing firm against the double world champions on their own patch is
  something else entirely. They’ll have to do it without Valetini, for my money
  the most destructive loose forward in the world (Pieter-Steph du Toit fans, I
  said ‘destructive’, not ‘best’). But, with six forwards on the bench compared
  to the Boks’ five in reserve, Joe Schmidt still has enough to cause a seismic
  upset. Or does he? We’ll find out in a bit when the old frenemies lock horns
  at the Home of Rugby that is Ellis Park in Johannesburg. Get in touch if you
  want to share something with the group. Reckon the Wallabies have the
  requisite meat? Will the Boks razzle-dazzle with a zippy backline? Want to
  pull me up on anything I’ve said already? My door is open. Kick-off at 4:10 pm
  local time, 0:10 am AEST. Teams and other bits to come.

I’m sorry folks. I can’t find any reaction from the players or coaches. Maybe that’ll be a relief to Springboks fans. Those in the ground looked shell shocked. They saw their team take a 22-0 lead on 18 minutes and, like me, must have expected a romp. They got one alright, just not the sort that was promised on the tin. Australia were brilliant. Totally and utterly brilliant. They deserve to celebrate long into the night having secure victory in Johannesburg for the first time in the professional era. Where do the Boks go from here? We’ll find out next week if they’ve righted the many wrongs as the two teams once again square up in Cape Town. I’ll be there to call it live. Hope you’ll join me. Here’s the match report from the wire. Keep an eye out for some analysis from yours truly. See you next week! The live feed from Sky has just cut out. I’ll try get some reaction quotes from the players elsewhere before I close shop. If you’ve got any thoughts on this stunning upset I’d love to read them. HenryC has written in adding to the theme: “Thanks to the Boks for putting the Lions victory in perspective!!” ‘Maybe puts the Lions’ achievements into perspective!’ That’s a to-the-point email from Iain Moore. Australia have done it! Totally deserve this. They kept South Africa scoreless for more than an hour and absolutely hammered them. Six tries to three. Complete dominance at the breakdown, some blistering scores, resolute defence, just brilliant. Well done Australia. 80 min: The Springboks fans are utterly stunned. I don’t think one of them saw this coming. Not in their darkest nightmares…. 79 min: One last chance for more? The Wallabies have the line-out within touching distance after another penalty call goes their way. They set the maul then go through the hands. McDermott snipes. Five out… GAME OVER! The fans are shocked! Stunned silence at Ellis Park as Wright counters after an Esterhuizen fumble in Australia’s half. The fullback runs upfield, easily beats Willemse’s weak tackle and slides over. Unbelieveble. O’Connor slams home the conversion from the right tram. This is a hiding for the world champions on their own patch. 75 min: Frost plucks the line-out and Gleeson, on off the pine, canters upfield. 73 min: McReight has won yet another penalty on the ground inside his 22. That is the game. That is why Australia are going to win in Johannesburg for the first time since 1963. Unbelievable effort from the Wallabies. 71 min: Australia steal another line-out. We knew they’d be a handful at the breakdown but did we foresee their presence at the set piece? They fully deserve their lead. South Africa are now back on halfway. Reinach kicks. Moodie wins it but there’s a South African knock-on. Wright kicks it but it goes straight out so South Africa have a line-out just beyond Australia’s 22. They have to score from here or it’ll be game over. 70 min: Australia win the ball, yet again, inside their own 22. This followed a Reinach burst around the fringe. They now have an 11 point lead and have 11 minutes to defend it. 68 min: The camera cuts to Erasmus and he looks utterly shocked. His team need to pull this out of the fire and they need to do it quick fast. NO WAY!!! I cannot believe what I’m seeing. South Africa kick-off and the Wallabies just scream up field with slick hands and accurate passing and there Jorgensen is, on the right wing, beating his man and running clear through for a try. How on earth has this happened!? Australia have simply been immense! South Africa are falling apart. O’Connor ignores the boos and slots the conversion from out wide. WHAT IS GOING ON!? My word, who saw this coming? This is remarkable. Australia are rampant. Wright wriggled past three tacklers from his own half and just kept going. He had Wilson in support to his right and the skipper was away, holding off challengers with a hand-off before sliding under the poles. O’Connor can’t miss from there and Australia are 15 minutes away from a very famous win. 63 min: The world champions have to dig deep here. They’ve not had it their own way and haven’t scored a point since the 18th minute. Libbok lifts a cross kick which Arendse spills in the air. Australia have another knock-on advantage and are countering… 60 min: That try is a result of the Boks’ growing frustrations. Libbok tried to force the issue. They know they should be well clear and have left plenty of points on the cutting room floor. Full credit to the Wallabies. Other teams would have folded after going 22-0 down in Johannesburg. Momentum is with them now as South Africa cough up more possession as Mbonambi, on for Marx, chucks a line-out skew so the Wallabies have the scrum on halfway. Joseph picks Manie’s pocket! The young superstar has plucked an intercept and sprinted clear of the chasing Boks. He had Williams and van der Merwe, two of the quickest South Africans around, cashing him. But he breezed clear. O’Connor slots the conversion and we have a game on! Wow, the Wallabies have shown immense spirit. They are growing in this and you wouldn’t bet against them from here. Anyone have a baker who serves humble pie? I might have to put an order in. 56 min: Again slick handling and passing, as well as strong carries through the phases, take South Africa to within touching distance of the Australian try line. Again they leave empty handed. This time it’s a knock-on from Williams as he cantered upfield to offer support for Willemse and van der Merwe. Earlier du Toit showed great work in the left tram with Mostert also carrying well. But close is not good enough. Australia are still in this. 54 min: What a let off for South Africa. The Aussies have their line-out pinched. The Springboks go down the line and get the ball to Willemse, on the field, but the pass is wayward so Australia have a line-out. The Wallabies can’t keep it tidy themselves and knock on soon after. It all ends with the Boks having the scrum feed about 10 metres inside their own half. 52 min: Jorgense plucks a bouncing ball from a kick ahead and he’s tearing upfield! Now Australia have a penalty advantage. They’re going through the hands as the ball spirals from left to right. They’re swarming forward until the move is stifled by van Staden who is pinged for being off-side. All Australia now. Can they get the ball bacl down the left. They can, but the pass to Jorgensen isn’t accurate and Arendse catches it. No matter, they have the penalty which is nudged to the corner. O’Keefe gives a team warning. One more indiscretion and he’ll bring out the yellow card. 50 min: Another penalty on the ground for Australia! Hooper with the steal about two metres from his own line. That is massive. First the Wallabies line-out maul held firm which forced Williams to go down the line. Marx and Etzebeth had charges but couldn’t make the ground before Hooper swooped in to nick the ball on the deck. Wonderful from the Aussies who have held on in this fight. 49 min: Water is wet. South Africa win a scrum penalty. Libbok nudges it to the corner. But we’ll wait while Ikitau receives treatment for a “serious injury,” as O’Keefe calls it. 47 min: Wright almost plucks a worldie grab that would have seen him score upfield! Libbok unfurled a cross-kick, looking for van der Merwe on the right wing, but Wright beat the Bok winger to the ball and almost held on inside his own 22. If he had, my money was him going the distance. As it is we’ll have a South African scrum all the way on the right inside Australia’s patch. 47 min: White hoofs a box kick after the Aussie scrum held firm. White is having a great game. 45 min: Pieter-Steph du Toit knocks on at the base of a ruck about five metres short of the Wallabies line! That was really good from the Boks before then. Williams and Libbok sniped through gaps around the fringe. Du Toit had the ball in the left tram and made good ground. They kept coming and Williams was fizzing passes, but when du Toit came in to keep the move alive and possible go for a dart himself, he spilled it. Australia scrum with Wilson’s heels touching his own line. What a line from the skipper! Excellent from Wilson who hit the line to perfection, collecting Bell’s short pass that totally flummoxed the Boks defence. Earlier Bell, on at half-time, muscled Marx with a strong carry to give the Wallabies go forward after the line-out. O’Connor hits the conversion and we have a game on. Can Australia continue to boss the breakdown and cause trouble at the line-out? 42 min: I asked how the Wallabies can get a way back into this and we’ve just seen the roadmap. South Africa lose another line-out – their fourth of the game – and give away a penalty on the ground having lost the ball in the air. Add all three of those variables together and you have Australia with a line-out in the Boks 22. They have to make this count. And we’re back! I’m not sure how the Wallabies get back in this. They’ve won the breakdown battle but they’ve not managed to dominate the gainline either with their carries or through finding an edge. The Boks look more imposing either side of the ball. Perhaps the introduction of Gleeson and a switch to a higher tempo might help? But then where does the punch in the tight channels come from? Skelton hasn’t been as imposing as he was against the Lions. Different gravy against South African meat. The ball is spilled in the line-out and White kicks it out. That brings an end to a one-sided half that looked like being a lot worse for the Wallabies when Kolisi scored his team’s third try after just 18 minutes. The Springboks were imperious before the Wallabies fought back and bagged a try of their own. The tourists have a mountain to climb, but thanks to swift work at the breakdown and some fight in patches, they can at least see the summit. Back in a bit. 40 min: South Africa’s pack consumes the Wallabies in the scrum. They get the advantage and spiral the ball down the line. Fassi joins from fullback and stands up a tackler before off-loading. He can’t stitch the move together. Kriel mops up and straightens the attack but it goes nowhere. They come back for the penalty which Libbok nudges a little closer to the corner. 38 min: Frost nips in and wins a South African throw. O’Connor then gathers and launches a monster kick. It bounces. And keeps bouncing. And keeps bouncing until it goes out of play at the far end of the pitch. That’s so unlucky because it means South Africa will get the scrum from where O’Connor kicked it, which is just beyond the Aussie 22 with a short blind on the right. 36 min: Ten phases and the Boks come within inches of the Australian line. Libbok and Williams were made to work swiftly thanks to aggressive Wallaby defence, but brilliant play from Etzebeth, Esterhuizen and du Toit, as well as Kolisi who has been hovering in space in the tram all game, means the Boks make metres. Things fray at the seams eventually before Libbok floats a wide pass right. Kolisi charges and feeds Esterhuisen who is isolated a metre short. Wright and Ikitau make the hit and win the ball back. There’s a penalty call – holding on I think, actually, no idea – and O’Connor can hoof it long. South Africa have been really good through the phases. They look menacing the longer these moves stretch on. No dice this time, though. 33 min: Really good from Australia. Penalty kick becomes a line-out which becomes a break down the line. Jorgensen, off his wing, found Kellaway in the left tram with a floater. He burst down upfield and nudged ahead for Ikitau. Arendse had to scamper across and clean up. Luckily for the Boks, the kick bobbled over the try-line so Arendse could fall on it and win back possession. After the early blitz the Wallabies have grown into the contest. 31 min: After scoring the try, Australia show composure and exit well. A long kick pins the Boks back. But they’re upfield once more thanks to Kolisi gathering a Marx line-out over the top. Ezterhuizen is now on the charge, carrying Ikitau on his back as he motors through the gears. Pietsch cops a Kolisi shoulder to the face. This could be a broken jaw. He’s been replaced by Kellaway. It wasn’t illegal, just the sudden change of direction which meant the Aussie winger was in a bad position to make the tackle. Australia do get a penalty, though, after an obstruction call following the Ezterhuizen break. That’s much better from the Wallabies! They had the advantage, yet again winning a penalty as a Bok strayed off side. They kept it in the hands before Ikitau stood up a tackler in front of him and created space to his left. The ball just needed to go down the hands, which it did, and find Pietsch. The winger with the shaved head had a simple run to the corner, though O’Connor couldn’t convert from out wide. 27 min: A fourth breakdown penalty goes Australia’s way. First Jorgensen plucked a high kick in the right tram and off-loaded back infield. He couldn’t find a mate and Marx grabbed the loose ball. But the South African hooker was isolated and picked off on the ground. Australia have to make this territory count as they go for another line-out in the Boks 22. 24 min: Another penalty on the ground for the Wallabies. That is one area where they’re at least holding their own. Three breakdown penalties in a row going their way. O’Connor kicks long again and this time SA don’t challenge in the air. A little kick ahead from White makes life difficult for the covering defence under their own poles but van der Merwe was across from right win to mop up. Great cover. They eventually secure the ball and Libbok nails a spiralling kick with his apparent weaker foot, finding touch on halfway from his own try-line. 23 min: Solid work from the Boks. Stiff scrum despite the second shove from the Wallabies. A couple of big carries – from Esterhuizen and Nche – before a Williams raking box kick towards halfway. That is a slick exit. 22 min: Pollard throws skew! How frustrating. Etzebeth jumps up to make it a contest which means the throw has to be straight. It’s not. So it;s a scrum to the Boks. 21 min: Australia get a penalty in front of the posts just outside the SA 22. Skelton around the corner attracted three tacklers and one of them strayed off-side after not rolling away. That was more like it from Australia with Ikitau also involved. O’Connor nudges this penalty towards the corner. No choice but to go for it. 20 min: Suaalii has a bloody nose, embodying the battering his team has copped so far. But McReight is holding his own and comes up with another steal on the ground. The visitors need to get a grip here. O’Connor bangs a long touch finder. They need a solid attacking set from this line-out. Just relentless. Even after McReight stole the ball the Boks kept hammering the line. They’re insatiable this afternoon. The intensity is just insane as wave after wave of green carriers crash over gold tacklers. Arendse, then Etzebeth and then Kolisi with the finishing touches right under the poles. Nothing intricate to analyse there/. It’s just raw power from the Boks skipper. Libbok slots it over from bang in front. 18 min: McReight makes a huge steal on the ground after 10 South African phases. But the Boks have it back, the Wallaby didn’t have any support. It’s a little scrappy as Libbok flings a pass left. Arendse picks up the bouncing ball. There’s a penalty advantage of a high tackle… 16 min: Australia can’t get over the gainline. Skelton and then Wilson are hammered in contact. O’Connor has no choice but to go to the boot, raking a grubber towards the South African 22. It’s a good kick that puts the home team under pressure. Etzebeth wins the line-out and then Arendse beats Jorgensen in the air so SA have it on halfway. Kolisi finds Fassi. Kriel gets past the gainline. Nche rumbles over Tupou. The supporting cast at the clear-out is effective. They continue make progress and a strong drive from van Staden has them up to the 22. Stunning from the Springboks! And that’s Esterhuizen’s first try for his country. And what a try. Coast to coast, Kriel found an edge and slipped a tackle down the right, beating White who couldn’t lay a glove on him. Kriel passed inside for the supporting du Toit who then fed Esterhuizen looping round from midfield with an off-load. Just so slick from the world champions. Australia can’t live with them at the moment. Libbok hits the post so can’t add the extras. 11 min: Back and forth! Pietsch knocks on after winning the ball in the air. The Boks don’t capitalise and Fassi makes an aimless kick straight to Wright. O’Connor is smoked in midfield and spills the ball. Marx hacks it ahead where van der Merwe gathers and runs down the right tram. Pietsch scampers back and makes a great recover tackle, nudging the Boks winger out of touch. A breathless passage ends with a Wallaby throw and White hoofing it long. Easy swing of the right boot and it’s over. He’s had his problems from the tee but that’s two from two for Manie. 7 min: The Aussie scrum holds and they manage to get the ball up to the edge of the 22 with a strong carry. White clears with a lengthy box that finds touch just inside his own half. Australia then pinch the line-out. Esterhuizen lands a big blow in midfield so kills momentum before Marx makes amends with a well-timed steal on the ground after thumping Wilson with a tackle. Penalty to South Africa about 40 metres out and right in front of the poles. South Africa are bossing this. 6 min: Grant Williams has the ball on a string. From the line-out he boxes and finds Etzebeth who was always going to win the ball in the air. The Williams dinks a kick to the corner and finds Arendse who runs straight and hard at Jorgensen. The Aussie makes the tackle and also forces the knock on. Wallabies scrum in their own 22 all the way on their right. 5 min: Australia secure the line-out. They go right then back down the blind on the left. Ikitau dinks a kick that finds ground inside the Boks 22. Van der Merwe mops up and dopes well to wriggle under the tackle of Pietsch and is tackled high. So it’ll be a relieving penalty for South Africa inside their own patch. 4 min: A similar kick-off for the Wallabies is fielded by de Jager. The Boks keep the ball until Fassi overcooks a kick. The Wallabies get the line-out inside SA territory. What a start for the Springboks! It started with Wright fumbling a Williams box kick and then it was all momentum. Just about every player was involved. Du Toit, Kolisi and more had strong carries until the cracks opened. Fassie joined from fullback to play the final pass to his left where Arendse had a simple run in. That move went several phases and 70 metres. Libbok nails the conversion from the left. 1 min: De Jager takes the kick-off. Wright spills a box kick so the Boks attack with Libbok to Kriel down the right. Van der Merwe makes room off the right wing and the Boks are upfield. Kolisi has a stroing carry. They’re up to the Wallabies 22 with du Toiut charging… The anthems are done. The team talks are over. The referee Ben O’Keefe has the whistle in his mouth. Let’s play! The Impis are making their appearance. Want to learn more about the Zulu warriors? I’ve got you covered. The live coverage has started on Sky, picking up the South African broadcast from SuperSport. Matt Pearce has highlighted the bench splits with the Wallabies going 6-2 and the Boks going 5-3. What is this, Freaky Friday? Australia are looking for their first win in Johannesburg since 1963. They have an aggregate score of 201-107 against in the City of Gold from their six games there in the professional era. Their most recent visit ended with a 35-17 defeat in the first round of the 2019 Championship. Incidentally, the Boks had the same midfield combo that game, had the same second row combo , played an attacking fly-half (Elton Jantjies) and had Cobus Reinach coming off the bench alongside two other backs. Hey, if it ain’t broke. It’s easy to forget that the Wallabies were in the doldrums back in September 2023. The pasting they received at the hands of Fiji at the World Cup meant they failed to get out of their group. Eddie Jones inevitably got the sack and there were questions over whether the code had a future at all. This redemption narrative isn’t complete, but it’s on track. The team is on the up. Fans are returning. Interesting is rising. The Rugby Championship is another opportunity to keep the fire burning. The 35-year-old James O’Connor has been picked at at fly-half, playing his first game for Australia in three years. If the veteran can get the ball out wide the Aussies will be in business with the combative Dylan Pietsch and the slippery Max Jorgensen waiting in the trams. First, O’Connor will need front foot ball and here is where the game will be won and lost. The back row of skipper Harry Wilso, Tom Hooper and Fraser McReight will need to boss their sphere of influence. Keep an eye out for the cameo of Langi Gleeson off the bench. Wallabies: 1 – Slipper, 2 – Pollard, 3 – Tupou, 4 – Frost, 5 – Skelton, 6 – Hooper, 7 – McReight, 8 – Wilson (c); 9 – White, 10 – O’Connor; 11 – Pietsch, 12 – Ikitau, 13 – Suaalii, 14 – Jorgensen; 15 – Wright. Replacements: 16 – Paenga-Amosa, 17 – Bell, 18 – Nonggorr, 19 – Williams, 20 – Gleeson, 21 – Champion de Crespigny, 22 – McDermott, 23 – Kellaway. Rassie Erasmus named his team on Monday and it’s one that promises loads of running. Manie Libbok at fly-half will be keen to let the ball sing and has a freewheeling scrum-half inside him in Grant Williams, arguably the fastest man among the 46 involved today. Siya Kolisi plays at No. 8 and there are five forwards and three backs on the bench, a departure from the Bomb Squad tactic that has brought so much success over the past six years. Eben Etzebeth’s battle with Will Skelton in the tight exchanges could swing the contest. Springboks: 1 – Nche, 2 – Marx, 3 – Louw, 4 – Etzebeth, 5 – de Jager, 6 – van Staden, 7 – du Toit, 8 – Kolisi (c); 9 – Williams, 10 – Libbok; 11 – Arendse, 12 – Esterhuizen, 13 – Kriel, 14 – van der Merwe; 15 Fassi. Replacements: 16 – Mbonambi, 17 – Wessels, 18 – Ntlabakanye, 19 – Mostert, 20 – Smith, 21 – Reinach, 22 – Moodie, 23 – Willemse. There’s a saying in cricket that you can’t judge a pitch until both sides have had a bat. Here’s my equivalent for rugby: You can’t judge the power of a pack until it’s gone toe to toe with the Springboks. The Wallabies might have lost the series against the British &amp; Irish Lions, but some of their big boys left with reputations enhanced. Will Skelton, Rob Valetini, Taniela Tupou, Nick Frost, Tom Hooper, Langi Gleeson; where there were concerns about the Aussies ability to mix it with big boys there’s now confidence in the tall timber. Well, let’s see how hard they really are. Because bullying the Lions is one thing. Standing firm against the double world champions on their own patch is something else entirely. They’ll have to do it without Valetini, for my money the most destructive loose forward in the world (Pieter-Steph du Toit fans, I said ‘destructive’, not ‘best’). But, with six forwards on the bench compared to the Boks’ five in reserve, Joe Schmidt still has enough to cause a seismic upset. Or does he? We’ll find out in a bit when the old frenemies lock horns at the Home of Rugby that is Ellis Park in Johannesburg. Get in touch if you want to share something with the group. Reckon the Wallabies have the requisite meat? Will the Boks razzle-dazzle with a zippy backline? Want to pull me up on anything I’ve said already? My door is open. Kick-off at 4:10 pm local time, 0:10 am AEST. Teams and other bits to come.
