  Having a mardy person sitting next to you in the car can be a distraction at
  the best of times, but it is all the worse when the grump is your driving
  examiner. In an effort to avoid additional “potential anxiety” during tests
  and bolster pass rates among female candidates, a report commissioned by a
  government agency has suggested asking people taking a test whether they would
  like their examiner to be “chatty” or “formal”. The report by the transport
  research group TRL said men were found to be less affected by their examiner’s
  demeanour, while women were more likely to notice and interpret it, and that
  this might prompt self-judgment and worry about how they were doing. Men are
  more likely than women to pass a driving test, according to records dating
  back to 2007, with the annual pass rate for male candidates ranging from 47%
  to 55%, compared with 41% to 48% for female candidates. The TRL study on the
  gender imbalance was commissioned by the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency
  (DVSA), which oversees driving tests in Great Britain. It found that people
  were intimidated when their examiner did not make any pleasantries. The
  research was based on interviews with learner drivers, people who had recently
  passed their test, instructors and examiners. Among the interviewees, one
  successful candidate said their examiner had been “very down to business” with
  “no pleasantries”, which made them “feel just a little bit more intimidated”.
  But an instructor said a “really chatty examiner” could end up “distracting
  the student”. Another instructor said having a conversation with a candidate
  could “slightly distract” the learner when they wanted to be “100%
  concentrating”. In the report’s recommendations about how to reduce “potential
  inequalities around gender”, it noted that examiners’ communication approaches
  could be interpreted in various ways by different candidates. It said:
  “Examiners could ask candidates at the beginning of the test what kind of
  communication (‘formal’, ‘chatty’) would put them in the best frame of mind
  for driving to the best of their ability. “Such a change would enable
  examiners to remain focused on ability and outcomes but do so in such a way
  that does not introduce potential anxiety that is unrelated to driving
  competence in candidates.” Emma Bush, the managing director of AA Driving
  School, told the PA Media agency: “It is probably asking a lot of examiners to
  act ‘formal’ or ‘chatty’ on demand. Candidates probably don’t want a sergeant
  major nor a comedian examining them. “What all candidates want is a reassuring
  voice and presence, combined with a fair and professional approach to the
  test.” The study found no evidence that the gender of examiners had a direct
  impact on the candidates’ test experience. It noted that female candidates
  were more likely than their male counterparts to pass the driving theory test,
  which it attributed to women generally doing more preparation. A spokesperson
  for the DVSA said it was “committed to equality, diversity and inclusion” and
  wanted all candidates to “receive the highest level of customer experience”.
  They added: “This is an important piece of research by TRL and we’re now
  reviewing the considerations put forward to reduce inequality in driver
  testing in Great Britain, and help us further develop the guidance available
  to learner drivers as they prepare for their tests.” The average waiting time
  for a driving test in Great Britain as of the end of June was 22.3 weeks.
