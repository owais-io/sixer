  Multiple structures burned in a historic Gold Rush town in northern California
  on Tuesday night, after thousands of lightning strikes ignited a spate of
  fast-moving fires in the rural dry foothills of the eastern Sierra. Chinese
  Camp, about 57 miles (92km) east of Stockton and named for the Chinese miners
  who settled there, is a registered California landmark filled with historic
  structures, and home to roughly 60 residents. Officials have not yet released
  details on the scale of the damage, but footage from the fire line showed
  buildings leveled and engulfed in flames, as firefighters battled through the
  night. By Wednesday morning, eight fire conflagrations collectively named the
  TCU September Lightning Complex spread across more than 12,400 acres (5,000
  hectares), with 0% containment. “You can see the scale of destruction from
  this fire,” local news KCRA reporter Peyton Headlee said in a social media
  video as she walked down the main road of Chinese Camp, now laden with
  smoldering rubble on all sides. The blaze had already jumped Highway 120 and
  Highway 49, she said. “When a historic building burns, it’s a piece of history
  we lose,” Stephen Provost, who authored the book Chinese Camp: The Haunting
  History of California’s Forgotten Boomtown, told the San Francisco Chronicle.
  “When a whole town like that goes – I mean, wow … I just can’t. It’s just
  devastating.” California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, secured a grant from the
  Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) to support fire suppression efforts
  his office announced on Tuesday, and pre-deployed firefighting resources to
  five counties across the northern part of the state facing elevated risks. “We
  are securing all available resources – including support from our federal
  partners – to fight this growing lightning complex fire in Calaveras and
  Tuolumne counties,” Newsom said in a statement. Along with the eight blazes
  that are considered part of the TCU September Lightning Complex, dozens of
  other fires are burning in the state, with months left before the high-risk
  conditions begin to subside. It’s already been a devastating year of fire in
  California, starting with the fire storm that swept into communities across
  Los Angeles in January, killing 31 people. Overall, there have been more than
  6,500 wildfires in the state in 2025, collectively burning close to half a
  million acres. Significant fire potential is forecast to be above normal in
  September across northern California, according to an analysis from the
  National Interagency Fire Center issued on Monday, and high risks are likely
  to linger into October. The Associated Press contributed reporting
