  UK public transport: share your views on clamping down on music being played
  out loud
sectionName: UK news

bodyText: >-
  Transport for London (TfL) is launching a campaign to target people who play
  music or videos out loud on public transport. The posters targeting “headphone
  dodgers” will appear on the Elizabeth line and other services including buses
  later this week. A TfL survey of 1,000 people found that 70% described loud
  music and phone conversations without headphones to be a nuisance. The
  Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats have said they would tighten the law,
  proposing on-the-spot fines. Regulations are already in place with TfL bylaws
  banning passengers from singing or playing music out loud anywhere on the
  network, unless they have written permission, such as the licence granted to
  approved buskers. The behaviour can be prosecuted if it causes the “annoyance
  of any person”. If you’re having trouble using the form click here. Read terms
