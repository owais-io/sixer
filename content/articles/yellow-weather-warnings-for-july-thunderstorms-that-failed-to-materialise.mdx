  Living in central Bedfordshire on the edge of East Anglia, now subject to a
  long drought, repeated Met Office yellow weather warnings for thunderstorms in
  July were welcome. The gardeners with empty water butts were positively
  enthusiastic. In a 10-day period when there were repeated yellow warnings, a
  large area of southern and eastern England was subject to an amber threat,
  with Leighton Buzzard firmly in the middle of the danger zone. To be fair it
  did rain during the amber alert – there were a series of small showers and one
  clap of thunder. Altogether, though, it was barely enough water to wet the
  parched ground. Watching the weather forecasts on both the ITN and BBC late
  news during that period, the track of the storms repeatedly differed on the
  maps displayed by the two channels by 50 miles, and as much as 100, across
  Bedfordshire, Cambridge and eastwards. It is clear that the forecasters were
  using different computer models and their summaries sensibly came with the
  warning “do not take the track of these showers literally” – just as their
  maps showed the storms drifting over Bedfordshire. Finally when the warnings
  ceased it rained hard in the middle of the night, when the “odd rogue shower”
  had been mentioned in passing. Relief at last.
