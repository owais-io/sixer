  England’s chief regulator of exams has put up a staunch defence of Ofqual
  after it was forced to withdraw a decade of statistics detailing the number of
  students granted extra time and other assistance for A-levels and GCSEs. In
  his first interview with a national media organisation since his permanent
  appointment as head of Ofqual, and just weeks after the data was dramatically
  pulled, Sir Ian Bauckham said there had been no error in the figures, blaming
  instead the way they had been interpreted. He also denied that the data
  “misunderstanding”, which comes five years after Ofqual’s disastrous attempt
  during Covid to award GCSE and A-level grades by algorithm, had further
  undermined confidence in the organisation, saying: “We’ve got a qualification
  system in this country to be proud of.” In an interview with the Guardian, the
  chief regulator also addressed the debate surrounding the government’s
  curriculum and assessment review, warning against any wholesale move from
  exams to coursework because of concerns about students’ growing use of AI. He
  also urged caution over the introduction of digital exams, saying that any
  assessment innovation must be secure and deliverable, and should not
  disadvantage poorer students who may not have had the same access to digital
  devices and software as their wealthier peers. Ofqual, which was set up in
  2010 to regulate qualifications in England, shocked the education sector when
  it announced on 17 July that it was withdrawing official statistics for
  special access arrangements for exams going back to 2014, because they
  “significantly overstated” the number of students. Access arrangements are
  adjustments to exams for students with special needs, disabilities or
  injuries, with 25% extra time being the most common. In 2012-13, 107,000
  students in England were granted extra time, but in 2024 Ofqual said it was
  nearly 420,000 students, an increase of nearly 300%. The data appeared to show
  that 30% of students had been granted 25% extra time last year, with
  particularly high rates in private schools where nearly 42% of students
  received adjustments. Ofqual now thinks the actual rate is far lower. Bauckham
  said the confusion had arisen because, rather than showing access arrangements
  solely for students entered for GCSEs and A-levels in one particular year, the
  data includes a much broader list of access arrangements. Each access
  arrangement lasts two years. There can be duplicate applications for the same
  student, and the list may include pupils with special arrangements in place
  who did not sit exams that year at all. “It wasn’t an error, because the
  published data only ever claimed to be the long list of approved access
  arrangements,” Bauckham said. “It never claimed to be that data mapped against
  actual exam entries, but it was interpreted as that. “I’ve been clear that
  moving forward … we need to publish actual granted access arrangements that
  relate to actual entries in the year in question.” He said the final figure is
  likely to be much more in line with the proportion of pupils in England with
  special education needs and disabilities (Send), which according to the most
  recent official statistics stands at 19.5%, including those with education,
  health and care plans “Just because this figure is significantly lower,
  doesn’t mean that there may not have been a rising trend,” Bauckham added. “I
  would be very surprised indeed if the final data, when we’re able to pinpoint
  it, doesn’t indicate a rising trend. So I don’t think it takes away the
  problem, but it alters the scale of what we’re thinking about.” On what
  appeared to be a growing gap between the use of access arrangements between
  private and state schools, he said: “Of course in independent schools there is
  a slightly higher proportion of Send than there is in state-funded schools. “I
  don’t think it’s unreasonable to hypothesise that there will still be a
  difference between state-funded schools and independent schools, not least
  because of that higher Send figure, but I’m absolutely clear that we must have
  data that informs the public debate on this issue.” Bauckham, who after a year
  as interim chief regulator was permanently appointed in February, said Ofqual
  had moved on a long way from the chaos of Covid when exams were cancelled and
  grades calculated using an algorithm had to be scrapped. “Five years later,
  we’ve moved back to examinations which are widely trusted as the fairest way
  to accredit and assess what students know, understand and can do,” he added.
  On the government’s curriculum and assessment review, due to report later this
  year, the Ofqual chief acknowledged concerns about the volume of exams pupils
  currently face, but he warned against reducing assessment to a single paper
  per subject. Students “really value the opportunity to have at least two bites
  at the cherry, by which I mean two opportunities in two separate exam papers
  in the same subject”,” he said. He is in favour of AI being used to support
  teaching and students’ learning. “But I would be very concerned about moving
  wholesale to a system where exams were replaced by extended writing
  coursework, because that would, in current circumstances, be open to
  malpractice.” “I’m not worried about the future of qualifications,” Bauckham
  said. “I think qualifications are going to be needed more than ever in the
  future, but I think in education, we’ve got to be clear that students still
  need rigorous intellectual training. They still need mastery of key knowledge.
  “We still need to set our sights high for them and we mustn’t succumb to the
  confused thinking that says, because AI will enable future workplaces, we
  don’t need students to know, understand and be able to do skills and
  demonstrate knowledge at a high level, because I think the opposite is true.”
