  Members of a far-right nationalist party are helping to organise protests
  outside hotels used to house asylum seekers across the UK, according to a
  series of Facebook posts and groups created in recent weeks. Activists for the
  Homeland party, which was formed as a splinter organisation from Patriotic
  Alternative, Britain’s biggest far-right group, have set up a number of online
  groups in an attempt to spread the protests that recently engulfed a hotel in
  Epping. Their involvement adds to concerns raised by some campaigners that the
  protests are being infiltrated and bolstered by people with far-right
  connections. Protests are expected to take place over the weekend in 20 towns
  and cities across the UK. The Facebook groups show that Homeland has been
  active in various spots around the country, including Epping, Wethersfield,
  Peterborough and Nuneaton. One group, Nuneaton Says No, is run by five people:
  Tom King, Jennifer Jardine, Matt Alexander, Adam Clegg and Andrew Piper. It
  has been advertising a protest on Saturday under various labels, including
  “Stop the Boats” and “Women Wear Pink” – a reference to the “Pink Ladies”
  protests outside the Bell hotel in Epping. In the comments section, one member
  posted: “Should’ve maybe done this on a Friday. You know. When the Council are
  actually in their offices, as opposed to when it’s just an empty building.”
  Clegg and Piper were recently named in the Times as members of Homeland and
  have been pictured holding the party’s campaign material. Both were also
  involved in trying to organise the Epping protests. King’s profile photo
  resembles that of Tom Huburn-King, Homeland’s West Midlands regional
  organiser. Jardine’s profile picture shows her posing in front of a Homeland
  party sign. Alexander’s Facebook photos show him having recently visited the
  Eagle’s Nest in Germany, built by the Nazis close to Adolf Hitler’s alpine
  holiday home. Another group, Wetherfield Says No, is run in part by Callum
  Barker, another person named recently by the Times as being a Homeland
  activist. Barker was one of three people to run the Epping Says No group along
  with Clegg and Piper. Barker and Piper both recently posted Facebook messages
  saying: “If you live in an area that has a hotel occupied by asylum seekers,
  start organising. Gather family, friends, locals and protest; make your voices
  heard. We are united in this struggle and in the end we will win.” A smaller
  group has been set up to organise protests around a hotel in Peterborough, the
  profile of which prominently shows Homeland-branded signs. The Guardian has
  attempted to contact all of the named individuals and the Homeland party but
  has not received a response. The attempts by far-right campaigners to organise
  protests outside migrant hotels have amplified concerns about extremists
  seeking to use the current controversy in Epping to stir up wider racial
  conflict. When Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, recently attended
  the Epping protest, he was pictured close to Eddy Butler, a former British
  National party strategist and a well-known figure in far-right circles. The
  anti-fascist group Hope Not Hate said on Friday that the recent spate of union
  and St George’s flags appearing on lamp-posts had been organised in part by a
  longtime ally of Tommy Robinson (whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon).
  Ministers are braced for a wave of protests across the weekend following a
  ruling by the high court stopping asylum seekers being placed at the Bell
  hotel. The hotel became the focus of anti-migrant protests after an asylum
  seeker living there was charged with sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl.
  The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said on Friday that ministers were working
  to close hotels housing asylum seekers “as swiftly as possible” as part of an
  “orderly” programme that avoids creating problems for other areas. “That is
  the reason for the Home Office appeal in this case, to ensure that, going
  forward, the closure of all hotels can be done in a properly managed way right
  across the country – without creating problems for other areas and local
  councils,” she said. The security minister, Dan Jarvis, said: “This government
  will close all asylum hotels and we will clear up the mess that we inherited
  from the previous government.” He added: “We’ve made a commitment that we will
  close all of the asylum hotels by the end of this parliament, but we need to
  do that in a managed and ordered way. And that’s why we’ll appeal this
  decision.” On Friday night Nigel Farage said Reform would carry out “mass
  deportation” of small boat arrivals. In an interview with the Times, he said
  the plans could see hundreds of thousands of people deported, with five
  charter flights leaving the UK every day. The Clacton MP said: “The aim of
  this legislation is mass deportations. We have a massive crisis in Britain. It
  is not only posing a national security threat but it’s leading to public anger
  that frankly is not very far away from disorder. “There is only one way to
  stop people coming into Britain and that is to detain them and deport them.”
