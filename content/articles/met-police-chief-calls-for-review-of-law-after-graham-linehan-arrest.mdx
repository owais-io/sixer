  The Metropolitan police have declined to drop their investigation into the
  comedy writer Graham Linehan for tweets about trans issues, and said that the
  law used by officers to detain him needs reviewing. The Met commissioner, Sir
  Mark Rowley, said on Wednesday officers should not be “policing toxic culture
  wars debates”, and while any review took place, officers would investigate
  only more serious cases concerning online messages. Rowley said “policing has
  been left between a rock and a hard place by successive governments”. The new
  Met statement followed a largely hostile reaction to the arrest of Linehan on
  Monday as he arrived at Heathrow airport on a flight from the US. He was
  arrested for allegedly inciting violence and detained by officers at the
  airport, who are routinely armed. In a statement, Rowley said: “On Monday,
  officers arrested a man in his 50s at Heathrow in relation to allegations of
  inciting violence, linked to posts on X. The officers involved in the arrest
  had reasonable grounds to believe an offence had been committed under the
  Public Order Act. “While the decision to investigate and ultimately arrest the
  man was made within existing legislation – which dictates that a threat to
  punch someone from a protected group could be an offence – I understand the
  concern caused by such incidents given differing perspectives on the balance
  between free speech and the risks of inciting violence in the real world.
  “Most reasonable people would agree that genuine threats of physical violence
  against an identified person or group should be acted upon by officers. Such
  actions can and do have serious and violent real-world implications. “But when
  it comes to lesser cases, where there is ambiguity in terms of intent and
  harm, policing has been left between a rock and a hard place by successive
  governments who have given officers no choice but to record such incidents as
  crimes when they’re reported. Then they are obliged to follow all lines of
  inquiry and take action as appropriate. “I don’t believe we should be policing
  toxic culture wars debates and officers are currently in an impossible
  position. I have offered to provide suggestions to the Home Office on where
  the law and policy should be clarified. Greater clarity and common sense would
  enable us to limit the resources we dedicate to tackling online statements to
  those cases creating real threats in the real world. If agreed, we could be
  ready to test new approaches quickly, within a matter of weeks. “As an
  immediate way of protecting our officers from the situation we find ourselves
  in today, we will be putting in place a more stringent triaging process to
  make sure only the most serious cases are taken forward in future – where
  there is a clear risk of harm or disorder. “But officers across the country
  will have to make similar decisions in future unless the law and guidance is
  changed or clarified. I hope to see this happen without delay so policing’s
  focus can be squarely on tackling priority issues like street crime and
  serious violence.” Linehan, 57, is best known as the co-writer of the Father
  Ted comedy series and has been vocal about trans issues on social media. The
  Guardian understands the Met is now talking to the Crown Prosecution Service,
  which decides whether criminal charges should be brought. Linehan said he was
  met by five armed officers after flying in from Arizona and told he was under
  arrest over the tweets. Writing on Substack, the 57-year-old said he was taken
  to a cell and then questioned over the posts, published on X in April. He said
  the posts related to him challenging a “trans-identified male” in a
  “female-only space”. Linehan said after questioning by police that his blood
  pressure “was over 200 – stroke territory” and he was taken to hospital and
  kept under observation before being discharged and released on bail. In its
  first statement the Met said: “On Monday, 1 September, at 1pm officers
  arrested a man at Heathrow airport after he arrived on an inbound American
  Airlines flight. “The man in his 50s was arrested on suspicion of inciting
  violence. This is in relation to posts on X. “After being taken to police
  custody, officers became concerned for his health and he was taken to
  hospital. His condition is neither life-threatening nor life-changing. He has
  now been bailed pending further investigation. “The arrest was made by
  officers from the MPS aviation unit. It is routine for officers policing
  airports to carry firearms. These were not drawn or used at any point during
  the arrest.”
