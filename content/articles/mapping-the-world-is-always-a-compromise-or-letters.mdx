  The Mercator projection is not a product of European chauvinism (African Union
  joins calls to end use of Mercator map that shrinks continent’s size, 15
  August). All map projections are compromises geared to a particular use, as a
  direct transference of a sphere on to a flat surface is mathematically
  impossible. The Mercator projection was a brilliant solution to a critical
  need of 16th-century pilots: a map on which they could plot a straight line
  that would be a “straight” line on the Earth. A mathematical marvel first put
  to paper by Gerard Mercator in 1569, it was not until 30 years later that the
  English mathematician Edward Wright sufficiently solved the complexities to
  make it practical. The Equal Earth map promoted by the African Union, like all
  others, simply makes different compromises for a different purpose. The
  African Union could well argue that the venerable Mercator projection is not
  the ideal choice for everyday use, but the notion that it marginalises Africa
  is a pointless distraction from real issues. European civilisation is guilty
  of centuries of crimes against the global south, but the Mercator projection
  is not one of them. Thomas Suárez London • Your article doesn’t acknowledge
  that the surface of a sphere cannot be represented on a plane without
  distortion. This was proved mathematically by Carl Friedrich Gauss in the
  early 1800s. A raft of algorithms must be chosen from to translate what we see
  on the surface of the Earth into a two-dimensional map. This process is known
  as projection, and there are numerous techniques; each affects how a map
  ultimately looks. Every projection comes with trade-offs in shape, distance,
  direction, and land area. The 16th-century Mercator projection preserves the
  shape of land masses (which is why it is so commonly used in schools) as well
  as direction (which is why it is used by navigators and Google Maps). What the
  Mercator projection sacrifices, however, is size representation, which is most
  distorted at the poles – meaning Africa is rendered smaller than it really is.
  The Gall-Peters projection, meanwhile, nigh-on perfectly preserves land size,
  but heavily distorts shape. With the dawn of satellites and GPS, the Mercator
  projection has fallen from favour because it is no longer needed to aid
  navigation. Modern cartographers are free to blend equal-area maps, such as
  the Gall-Peters, with shape-preserving projections, such as the Mercator – and
  split a difference between size and shape. But there is no “correct” map
  projection, and the idea that the Mercator projection is symptomatic of
  European imperialism is a modern critique. The fairest way to see the Earth is
  to study a globe. Hamish Monk Chelmsford, Essex • Have an opinion on anything
