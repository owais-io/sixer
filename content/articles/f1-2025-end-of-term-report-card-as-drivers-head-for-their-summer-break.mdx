  Top of the class Oscar Piastri Leading the world championship and has earned
  his place at the top. He has not only been quick in the best car on the grid,
  but consistent and calm. This has not been the stuff of fireworks, but
  relentless precision. His execution and attitude have no little of the Alain
  Prost about them and he is shaping up to be a similarly formidable opponent as
  The Professor. He has gone toe to toe with his teammate, Lando Norris, in
  these opening 14 meetings and, overall, come out on top. There have been six
  wins and only twice has he failed to reach the podium. The three consummate
  victories in a row in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Miami made his title ambitions
  clear, while errors have been few and far between. A spin in the wet in
  Australia and a safety car infringement at Silverstone are the only blots on
  an otherwise immaculate copybook. Next best Lando Norris Entered the season as
  favourite and when the McLaren duly proved to be the class of the field was
  expected to exploit it. However, after a strong start in Australia it became
  clear the MCL39 was not quite giving him the feel for the front grip of the
  car that he likes. It proved costly, particularly in qualifying, and Norris
  was typically forthright and honest that it was up to him to adapt. Errors
  compounded his problems, not least crashing in qualifying in Saudi Arabia and
  hitting his teammate in Canada. In Budapest, he revealed an intriguingly
  nihilist approach, noting in regards to the title race: “In 200 years no one
  is going to care. We’ll all be dead.” Rather than settling down to contemplate
  the meaninglessness of existence in a darkened room the Briton has doggedly
  stuck at his task and returned some impressive wins with fine drives in Monaco
  and Austria and an inspired strategy coup on Sunday in Budapest. If he can
  eliminate the faults Norris will be challenging his teammate to the end. Room
  for improvement Max Verstappen Before the weekend began in Hungary, Verstappen
  ended speculation over his future by stating he would be with Red Bull next
  year, but did not say whether he would see out his contract that runs to 2028.
  The world champion has acknowledged the title is beyond him this year, but he
  still craves performance and stability within the team. However, over these 14
  races, the form of the car has been sorely lacking, while bringing an end to
  the turbulence of the past two years and soothing the ruffled brows of the
  Verstappen camp was at least part of the purpose of the removal of Red Bull’s
  team principal of 20 years, Christian Horner. Verstappen has still succeeded
  in wrestling repeated results, including two impressive wins, from a car that
  is barely manageable, but he and the team’s focus is now on the future. There
  are major exams coming up in the form of the new regulations for next season
  and, for the second half of this one, the question that will dominate is how
  do Red Bull under their new boss, Laurent Mekies, now adapt? If the Frenchman
  fails to deliver, the internal politicking at the team could be fascinating.
  And brutal. Best newcomer Gabriel Bortoleto When Sauber brought in a new floor
  in Spain the 20-year-old Brazilian rookie came alive, showing promise given
  his team’s relatively uncompetitive car. He is in good company in the new
  intake. At Racing Bulls, Isack Hadjar has been a standout adapting quickly to
  F1 with consistent, confident performances and largely outdriving his
  teammate, Liam Lawson, whom Red Bull had rated enough to promote, briefly, to
  the senior squad at the start of the season. Kimi Antonelli has demonstrated
  his potential at Mercedes, but has been inconsistent in a car George Russell
  muscled to a win in Canada. Bortoleto has given the impression he may have so
  much more to come. After Sauber applied upgrades in Barcelona, Bortoleto took
  his first points in Austria including challenging Fernando Alonso for seventh
  place. A crash at Silverstone followed while on slicks in the wet, but he took
  points in Belgium and in Hungary he was flying. He qualified seventh, 12
  places in front of his experienced teammate, Nico Hülkenberg, and claimed
  sixth in the race after a battling drive. If he can repeat it in the second
  half of the season, Audi, as Sauber will be next season, have a genuine asset.
  Earned a holiday Lewis Hamilton Left dejected after two races of, by his own
  admission, below-par performances – with 16th on the grid in Spa and a 12th in
  qualifying in Hungary he described as “absolutely useless” before finishing
  the race in 12th – Lewis Hamilton even appeared to cast doubt on his future in
  F1. It was a response, likely a blip, from a driver worn down by having to
  deal with adapting to his new team under such scrutiny as well as
  dissatisfaction at how they, and he, are performing. It is unusual for
  Hamilton to be so publicly hard on himself and perhaps represents real
  frustration with Ferrari, but he has proved repeatedly he is nothing if not a
  fighter. A step back after what has been a gruelling opening with a new team
  is clearly required even if, as is believed, he feels there is still enormous
  work to be done at the Scuderia. Hamilton accepted the process to adapt would
  take time, but that frustration in Hungary suggests he could be disillusioned
  despite his belief Ferrari have everything needed to return to the top. He
  said rather dejectedly in Budapest he would “hopefully” return after the
  summer break. The touch is still there, as he proved in Silverstone and Spa,
  but he, perhaps like no other driver, could benefit from a reset over the
  summer break.
