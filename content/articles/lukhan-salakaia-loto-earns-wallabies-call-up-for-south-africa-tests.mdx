  Powerful lock Lukhan Salakaia-Loto has earned a return to the Wallabies’ squad
  for the two Tests in South Africa to kick off this year’s Rugby Championship,
  but injuries in the halves have forced coach Joe Schmidt to call on Nic White
  a week after his supposed retirement from international rugby. The Wallabies
  showed progress in the series against the British &amp; Irish Lions and won
  the third Test to prevent a whitewash, but they cannot afford to rest heading
  into the clashes with the top-ranked Springboks, who beat the All Blacks in
  the 2023 World Cup final. The 35-player squad is similar to the one selected
  for the Lions series and includes Rob Valetini, the John Eales Medal winner
  who missed the third Test due to a calf injury, as well as veteran No 10 James
  O’Connor. But there are also some new faces, including three uncapped players.
  Salakaia-Loto, who has been out of the Australian squad so far this year, wins
  a place after starring for the First Nations &amp; Pasifika XV against the
  Lions three weeks ago. He played off the bench in the last of his 41 Wallabies
  appearances against Ireland late last year. Schmidt said the group has made
  “some positive steps” during the start of the international season but there
  is work ahead. “It’s pleasing to be able to keep the core of the group
  together, while also leaning on some depth and fresh bodies,” he said. “We’re
  very conscious of how difficult it is going to be, playing South Africa on
  their home turf over two consecutive weekends.” Fly half Tane Edmed has been
  called up due to the concussion suffered by Tom Lynagh in Sydney. Lynagh
  himself was only thrust into the starting lineup for the Lions series
  following the neck injury to Noah Lolesio. Ben Donaldson has the inside
  running to start at No 10, having been named on the bench for all the Lions
  Tests, but O’Connor is well placed to don the gold again for the first time
  since 2022. Edmed made his Wallabies debut last year against Ireland but it
  ended three minutes after he came on due to a concussion. He has struggled to
  cement the No 10 at the Waratahs this year, and has signed a contract with the
  Brumbies to replace Lolesio, who is leaving Super Rugby to play in Japan. The
  24-year-old said he thought he was in the mix for selection but to be named
  again is an honour. “Despite the Super [Rugby] comp probably not going the way
  I would have liked, I always felt like I was a chance,” he said. “Everyone
  potentially could get injured or stuff can happen, so you can never kind of
  count yourself out. I’ve been ready and I’ve stayed ready.” There is more
  uncertainty at scrumhalf due to the hamstring injury to Jake Gordon that saw
  him miss the third Test. It means an SOS to White, who takes his place
  alongside Tate McDermott and the uncapped Brumby Ryan Lonergan in the squad.
  Lonergan’s teammate in the ACT, winger Corey Toole, and new Queensland Reds
  recruit Aidan Ross are the other uncapped players named, although Ross played
  a single Test for New Zealand in 2022. He has moved from the Chiefs to the
  Reds this year. Western Force hooker Brandon Paenga-Amosa keeps his place
  after his belated call-up for the third Lions Test. His selection was made
  more likely by the retirement announcement this week of David Porecki. Young
  centre Josh Flook and hooker Josh Nasser joined their Reds teammate
  Salakaia-Loto as new faces in the squad, which will play the first Test
  against the Springboks in Johannesburg on 16 August. The second Test is a week
  later in Cape Town. Edmed, who will travel to South Africa for the first time,
  said the presence of strong forwards Valetini and Will Skelton in the squad
  gives the Wallabies confidence, but the players are well aware of the task in
  front of them. “I’m not delusional to the fact that it’s going to be a very
  tough couple of games and I’m sure the squad’s the same, but we’re going to
  prepare as best we can, and I’m sure Joe and the squad are ready for the
  challenge,” he said. Wallabies squad Forwards: Angus Bell, Nick Champion De
  Crespigny, Langi Gleeson, Tom Hooper, Fraser McReight, Josh Nasser, Zane
  Nonggorr, Brandon Paenga-Amosa, Billy Pollard, Tom Robertson, Aidan Ross,
  Lukhan Salakaia-Loto, Will Skelton, Carlo Tizzano, Taniela Tupou, Rob
  Valetini, Jeremy Williams, Harry Wilson Backs: Ben Donaldson, Tane Edmed, Josh
  Flook, Len Ikitau, Max Jorgensen, Andrew Kellaway, Ryan Lonergan, Tate
  McDermott, James O’Connor, Dylan Pietsch, Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii, Nic White,
