  Iran’s involvement in clandestine violence and espionage overseas takes many
  forms, but all have a single aim – to win advantage for Tehran by striking
  unexpectedly at the “soft underbelly” of enemies. It’s a strategy that dates
  back to the 1979 revolution, and is rooted in a pragmatic if regretful
  assessment of Iran’s continuing weakness on the conventional battlefield.
  Australian authorities have not revealed exactly what convinced them that Iran
  was behind a series of antisemitic attacks in the country in recent months,
  but the charge is plausible, experts say. “We don’t know the full details, but
  the Australians wouldn’t [publicly blame Iran] unless they were pretty
  confident,” said Matthew Redhead, an expert in state threats and intelligence
  at London’s Royal United Services Institute. “Iran sees this as a cheap way of
  fighting an undeclared war against its opponents and of rallying audiences its
  wants to impress in the Middle East … They don’t have the resources to fight
  any other way. There is a long history here.” One of Iran’s goals is to
  distract enemies and so divert any concerted direct attack. Until recently,
  analysts were able to argue that the strategy had been relatively successful,
  fending off foes at limited cost. Yet it failed this summer. The damage done
  to the country’s nuclear programme in the two-week war with Israel and the US
  in June may be unclear, but few doubt Tehran came off worst in the
  hostilities. Iran promised “everlasting consequences” against the US at a time
  and place of its choosing. In reality, Tehran was already committed to a
  rolling programme of disruption, sometimes deadly, on its enemies’ territory.
  One long-term target has been dissidents and groups that might threaten the
  regime politically. The US, UK, Canada and 12 European countries issued a
  joint condemnation in July of “the attempts of Iranian intelligence services
  to kill, kidnap and harass people in Europe and North America in clear
  violation of our sovereignty”. Tehran rejected the allegations as “blatant
  fabrications … designed as part of a malicious Iranophobia campaign aimed at
  exerting pressure on the great Iranian nation”. Other targets include Jewish
  community centres and synagogues, such as those targeted with arson attacks in
  Australia. One objective is simply to hurt, frighten and demoralise. Another
  is to sow communal tension and so destabilise countries considered hostile.
  Researchers have identified more than 200 plots linked to Iran around the
  world since 1979, and Washington and its allies have reported a sharp rise in
  recent years. There have been at least 33 assassination or abduction attempts
  in the west since 2020 in which local or Israeli authorities allege an Iranian
  link. Some targets are very high profile. The US government unsealed an
  indictment in November against a 51-year-old Afghan national in connection
  with an alleged Iranian plot to assassinate Donald Trump. A British minister
  recently described how “direct action against UK targets has substantially
  increased over recent years with more than 20 Iran-backed plots presenting
  potentially lethal threats to British citizens and UK residents since the
  start of 2022”. For the most part, the plots originate with the Islamic
  Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), founded in the immediate aftermath of the
  overthrow of the shah to provide the new regime with an ideologically
  committed force that would defend the revolution, its leaders and its values.
  Some are the work of Iran’s intelligence ministry. The IRGC is extremely
  powerful, answering directly to the supreme leader, Ali Khamanei, and with its
  own vast financial resources. It cut its teeth putting down unrest among
  Iran’s ethnic and religious minorities before being deployed in an
  increasingly central role in the war with Iraq from 1981 until 1988. It was
  also already involved in more distant operations, organising assassination
  attempts against shah-era officials who had fled overseas and against the US,
  France, Israel and other perceived enemies. Two huge bombs that killed
  hundreds of US diplomats and military forces in Lebanon in 1982 were linked to
  senior figures in Iran’s new regime and the emergent Islamist militia,
  Hezbollah, which was formed with help of the IRGC around the same time. So too
  were bombings against Israeli forces and in Kuwait. A recent trend is use of
  criminals as proxies. Matthew Levitt, a leading authority on Iran’s overseas
  operations wrote last week: “Even in the midst of the 12-day Israel-Iran war,
  Iran reportedly reached out to organised crime groups in Europe … pressing
  them to quickly carry out attacks targeting Israeli and American interests
  there.” The use of criminals may be a tacit admission of weakness. If the IRGC
  had assets on the ground, it would not have to hire unreliable proxies. So too
  may be the targeting of Australia, which has never been a priority. For
  Redhead, the Australia attacks “smacked of desperation”. “It seems more about
  the Iranians signalling that they are still active than anything else. We
  shouldn’t get overexcited about their capabilities,” he said.
