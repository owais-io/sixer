  After more than 150 years, golden eagles could be set to return to England, as
  a study is expected to confirm there are enough suitable sites to support the
  reintroduction of the UK’s most iconic bird of prey. Golden eagles, which can
  have a wingspan of more than 2 metres, are occasionally seen in areas such as
  Northumberland. However, these birds come from a growing population in
  southern Scotland. A recent project to reintroduce the birds in Scotland is
  likely to be a model for any reintroduction in England. Owing to persecution
  from gamekeepers and farmers, the species has been in effect extinct in
  England for about 150 years. The last native golden eagle, which lived alone
  on a reserve in the Lake District, disappeared in 2015. But after a decision
  to legally release beavers in England – a pair of the animals were released in
  Dorset in March – the environment secretary, Steve Reed, is overseeing plans
  that could lead to golden eagles being brought back. Forestry England has
  carried out a feasibility study into whether and how the species could be
  reintroduced. While this is not due to be published for several months, it is
  understood that it concludes there is the capacity to support a population of
  the birds. Reintroducing extinct species is a complex process and needs to
  follow guidelines set out by the France-based International Union for
  Conservation of Nature (IUCN), as well as being licensed by Natural England,
  the government’s nature watchdog. The South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project
  offers a recent example to follow. While there are thriving populations of the
  birds in the Western Isles and Hebrides and in the north of mainland Scotland,
  with up to 600 breeding pairs in all, there were formerly only a handful in
  the south of the country. However, an official reintroduction programme begun
  in 2018 has led to the population growing from little more than three or four
  pairs to more than 50 – more than had been recorded in the region for more
  than 300 years. According to Duncan Orr-Ewing, the head of species and land
  management at the bird charity the RSBP, an English scheme would most likely
  follow the same model, with the focus likely to be the north of England. In
  the Scottish scheme, single chicks were taken from broods of two in
  established populations when they were about six to eight weeks old and then
  fed remotely with minimal human contact before they were released at specially
  chosen sites, with food initially provided until they could hunt for
  themselves. Such a method has also been used in reintroducing red kites and
  sea eagles, and has tended to work well, Orr-Ewing said, with high survival
  rates for the southern Scotland golden eagle project. While this depended on
  there being enough suitable sites containing sufficient prey, in the north of
  England this is unlikely to be an issue. Orr-Ewing said: “The main prey of
  golden eagles are things like grouse, rabbits, hares. But they can also take
  other things like deer calves, we’ve seen badgers, fox cubs, all of these sort
  of things. And you’ve got grouse moor estates. So I don’t think prey
  availability is going to be a problem.” The Department for Environment, Food
  and Rural Affairs (Defra) said a reintroduction programme for England would
  also look at public engagement and would consider the impact on other species
  and the wider environment. A Defra spokesperson said: “The recovery of golden
  eagles offers hope for the future of the species in Britain. Any next steps of
  their reintroduction in England will be set out in due course.” Comeback
  stories Reintroducing birds and animals to places where they were previously
  extinct is a complex process, but there have been a series of examples in
  recent years. Beavers The Eurasian beaver is native to Britain but was hunted
  to extinction about 400 years ago. About 20 years ago some were seen in
  Scotland, believed to have been illegally released into the wild. A formal
  reintroduction scheme in Scotland began in 2021 and the country now has an
  estimated population of about 1,500. After a similar scheme was begun in
  England, the first legally released animals were set free in Dorset in May. In
  July it emerged that no subsequent licences for beaver release had been
  granted, despite 40 expressions of interest. Bison In 2022, three bison were
  released into Kent woodland, the first wild examples of the creature in
  Britain for thousands of years. While this has so far been a one-off, the herd
  has expanded to six, and the impact of the bison on the area has been credited
  with boosting biodiversity. The same conservation project has since also
  released a species known as the iron age pig, a cross between wild boar and
  domestic pigs that are similar to the wild pigs that roamed much of Europe
  thousands of years ago. It has also released longhorn cattle and Exmoor
  ponies. Red kites Red kites had been common but loss of habitat and egg
  stealing meant that by the 1980s they had gone from England, with only a few
  pairs in Wales. In July 1990, two Welsh red kites and 11 from Spain – the
  chicks were brought in on a British Airways flight – were released in the
  Chiltern Hills, a process repeated over the next four years, with similar
  schemes happening in other areas. Red kites are now commonly seen in the
  Chilterns and there are an estimated 2,000 breeding pairs in England,
  distributed across almost the whole country.
