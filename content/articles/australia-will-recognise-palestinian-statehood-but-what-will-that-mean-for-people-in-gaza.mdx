  The Australian government will recognise a Palestinian state at the United
  Nations general assembly next month, with the prime minister, Anthony
  Albanese, saying a two-state solution was “humanity’s best hope to break the
  cycle of violence in the Middle East and to bring an end to the conflict,
  suffering and starvation in Gaza”. But what does recognising Palestinian
  statehood mean, and will it do anything to help civilians starving or facing
  violence in Gaza? Why is Australia recognising Palestinian statehood? Albanese
  said Australia believed a two-state solution in the Middle East – that is,
  recognising both an Israeli and a Palestinian state – was vital to ending the
  war, and Australia’s move was “part of a coordinated global effort”. “Until
  Israeli and Palestinian statehood is permanent, peace can only be temporary,”
  Albanese said. More than 60,000 civilians have been killed during Israel’s
  bombing campaign in Gaza, local health authorities report, after the 7 October
  2023 terror attack by Hamas where 1,200 Israelis were killed and dozens taken
  hostage. Australian allies including the United Kingdom, Canada and France
  have recently announced pledges to recognise Palestine. Albanese and the
  foreign minister, Penny Wong, pointed to reforms promised by the Palestinian
  Authority, which administers part of the West Bank territory, and demands from
  the Arab League of Middle Eastern nations, for Hamas to end its rule in Gaza.
  Albanese and Wong said “these factors mean that this is the best opportunity
  Australia may ever have to support moderate voices for peace in the region, to
  undermine extremism and to further isolate Hamas. This is the movement to
  which Australia and so many countries are seeking to add momentum.” At a press
  conference, Albanese said: “The international community’s vision for a just
  and lasting peace in the Middle East always encompassed two states living side
  by side with internationally recognised borders, a State of Israel and a State
  of Palestine with security for the people of both nations.” Anne Aly, the
  minister for multicultural affairs and Australia’s first Muslim woman in
  cabinet, said a “circuit breaker” was required to end the war in Gaza and
  protect civilians, and believed the global push toward Palestinian statehood
  would have an impact on Israel’s conduct. How many other countries recognise
  Palestine? Lots. The United Nations said in June 2024 that a Palestinian state
  was recognised by 146 UN member states at the time – around three-quarters of
  UN membership. That list has grown in recent weeks as key Australian allies
  including the United Kingdom, Canada and France announced their own pledges to
  recognise Palestine. What does it mean to recognise statehood? At the moment,
  it’s not clear what immediate changes will follow. Wong said practical steps,
  such as an Australian embassy presence or conferring full embassy status to
  the Palestinian delegation to Australia, would be tied to commitments from the
  Palestinian Authority. She conceded there was “much more work to do in
  building a Palestinian state”, and that the international community would
  “help build the capacity of the Palestinian Authority”. Wong said the growing
  global push toward a Palestinian state was a “chance to forge hope from
  despair”. Albanese said it was “an opportunity to isolate Hamas”. What are the
  conditions of Australia recognising Palestine? Albanese has had discussions
  with Mahmoud Abbas, head of the Palestinian Authority. While that group has
  influence in the West Bank, the other Palestinian territory, Hamas has been
  the governing body in Gaza. Albanese said Abbas had made pledges about the
  future of a Palestinian state, including: A demilitarised Palestine.
  Recognising Israel’s right to exist in peace and security. Holding elections
  and undertaking governance reforms. No role for terror group Hamas in a future
  Palestinian state. He also said the government wanted Israeli hostages
  released. However critics of the decision, including Jewish-Australian groups
  and the Coalition, said the government had not outlined what it would do if
  those conditions were not met. Wong wouldn’t specifically answer on that
  point, but said the international community would hold the Palestinian
  Authority to account, and that there was a focus on “progress” on the
  commitments. What have Palestinian groups said? The General Delegation of
  Palestine to Australia, the equivalent of the Palestinian embassy, welcomed
  the announcement, calling it a “principled decision” which would contribute to
  peace in the region. The delegation added that while it was a “vital starting
  point”, recognition alone “will do nothing to change or alleviate the
  unbearable human suffering of our people on the ground in Gaza unless
  accompanied by concrete actions to protect Palestinian civilians and human
  dignity, and to ensure the full and equal application of international law”.
  The Australia Palestine Advocacy Network called it a “political fig leaf”
  which would do little to stop the war in Gaza or address Israel’s military
  campaign. “Palestinian rights are not to be gifted by western states. They are
  not dependent on negotiation with or behaviour or approval of their colonial
  oppressors. Nor are they the crumbs to be thrown to Palestinians by Western
  states in lieu of taking the real action they are legally bound to take,” said
  APAN’s Nasser Mashni. Mashni also called on Australia to impose country-level
  sanctions on Israel and extend existing sanctions on two Israeli ministers to
  all members of Benjamin Netanyahu’s cabinet. Labor Friends of Palestine, the
  internal campaign group of rank-and-file members, welcomed the decision but
  said the Australian public were still “demanding more than words”. They urged
  the government to impose sanctions on more members of Netanyahu’s government,
  put more aid and mobile hospitals into Gaza, and a humanitarian visa pathway
  for Palestinians. What have critics said? Hours before the decision, Netanyahu
  said Australia and European nations were “shameful” for considering
  recognising a Palestinian state. He called such moves a “rabbit hole” and
  “canard”. The Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ) called the
  government’s decision a “betrayal” and a “disappointment”. Its president
  Daniel Aghion said the government had not confirmed what it would do if
  Israeli hostages were not returned, and that Israel “will feel wronged and
  abandoned by a longstanding ally”. “This commitment removes any incentive or
  diplomatic pressure for the Palestinians to do the things that have always
  stood in the way of ending the conflict,” he said. The Coalition said it had
  “serious concerns” about the decision. The opposition leader, Sussan Ley, was
  critical that Australia was “at odds with the United States”. “Despite his
  words today the reality is Anthony Albanese has committed Australia to
  recognising Palestine while hostages remain in tunnels under Gaza and with
  Hamas still in control of the population of Gaza. Nothing he has said today
  changes that fact,” Ley and the foreign affairs spokesperson, Michaelia Cash,
  said. “As it stands today the decision by the Albanese government does not
  appear to make the world a safer place, expedite the end of the conflict,
  deliver a two-state solution, see the free flow of aid, support the release of
  hostages or put an end to the terrorist group Hamas.”
