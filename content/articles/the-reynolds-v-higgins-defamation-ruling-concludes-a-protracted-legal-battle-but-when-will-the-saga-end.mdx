  Two Liberal staffers entered Linda Reynolds’ ministerial suite in Parliament
  House in the early hours of 23 March 2019. That night and how those around
  them responded in the years after have become one of the most contested events
  in Australia’s political history. And more than six years later, the legal
  fallout continues. The Western Australian supreme court ruled this week that
  Reynolds was defamed twice by Brittany Higgins on social media after she first
  went public in 2021 to accuse her former boss of mishandling her rape
  allegation. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The ruling marks the end of a
  protracted legal battle between Reynolds and Higgins, her former employee,
  unless the latter decides to appeal against the decision. But the long-running
  saga has not yet reached its conclusion. How did we get here? The train had
  been set in motion once Higgins decided to go public about her version of
  events. Higgins told news.com.au and The Project in February 2021 that she had
  been raped in Reynolds’ ministerial office by an unnamed former colleague,
  later publicly identified as Bruce Lehrmann, and claimed that Reynolds had not
  supported her adequately. A criminal trial over the matter was abandoned
  because of juror misconduct and a second attempt was aborted owing to concerns
  for Higgins’ mental health. Last year, in a defamation case brought by
  Lehrmann, Justice Michael Lee found that on the balance of probabilities,
  Lehrmann had raped Higgins on the minister’s couch. Upon watching the Project
  interview, Reynolds is alleged to have called Higgins a “lying cow” in front
  of her staff, in relation to the lack of support claim, which was then leaked
  to the media. She later said “she did not mean it in the sense it may have
  been understood” and that it was about Higgins’ allegations that she was not
  supported. Higgins and Reynolds agreed to a settlement in March 2021, with
  Reynolds issuing a public apology to Higgins. The agreement also included a
  non-disparagement clause to prevent either party from speaking negatively
  about the other in relation to it. But the public jabs at one another didn’t
  stop there. In January 2022, almost a year after Higgins went public with her
  allegations, her partner, now husband, David Sharaz posted on X that Reynolds
  could be asked in court about her involvement in making Higgins feel
  “pressured by the office not to continue” her police complaint against
  Lehrmann. Higgins responded to Sharaz’s tweet, saying “I have no words”,
  ending with a zipper mouth emoji. This week, the WA supreme court ruled those
  four words and single emoji were defamatory, and because she couldn’t prove
  their truth or otherwise prove a defence, they would cost Higgins $135,000 in
  damages to Reynolds. In July 2023, Reynolds revealed she would refer Higgins’
  $2.445m personal injury settlement to the federal anti-corruption body. In
  response, Higgins took to social media to accuse Reynolds of continuing a
  harassment campaign “through the media and in the parliament”. “My former boss
  who has publicly apologised for mishandling my rape allegation. Who has had to
  publicly apologise to me after defaming me in the workplace … This has been
  going on for years now. It is time to stop,” Higgins wrote in the Instagram
  story in July 2023. The court ruled that it was also defamatory, and because
  she couldn’t prove it was true or otherwise establish a defence, Higgins
  should pay Reynolds $180,000 in damages for the post. Higgins’ legal team was
  successful in defending against defamation for another social media post in
  July 2023, in which she likened Reynolds’ submission to the ACT Board of
  Inquiry to “silencing” sexual assault victim-survivors. The ruling found
  Higgins’ lawyers had successfully established the defence of honest opinion,
  fair comment and qualified privilege. The ruling also showed Reynolds had
  failed to prove Higgins and Sharaz had concocted a conspiracy to publicly
  release the details of Higgins’ alleged rape with the “sole or predominant
  purpose” of destroying the former senator’s reputation. Is that the end of
  these legal battles? The WA supreme court’s ruling should mark the end of the
  dispute between Reynolds and Higgins, but it is still possible, Higgins could
  decide to appeal against the judgment. Missing from the supreme court’s
  decision this week, however, was a ruling on Sharaz’s case. Reynolds had also
  taken defamation action against Sharaz for comments he made on social media in
  2022. Sharaz said he would not challenge Reynolds’ defamation claim in April
  2024 because he could not afford to pay his legal costs. The judge has yet to
  deliver his ruling on Sharaz’s case. Beyond this defamation fight, there are
  other cases afoot. In June, the National Anti-Corruption Commission found “no
  corruption issue” with the $2.445m payout to Higgins, including that “there
  was no inappropriate intervention” by the former attorney general Mark
  Dreyfus. Dreyfus responded to the Nacc’s finding that he regretted “the
  baseless allegation of corruption has been so widely publicised ahead of this
  finding and hope future matters can be resolved in a more timely manner”. But
  Reynolds will also test her concerns about the settlement process in the
  federal court. The former senator said she had been denied the opportunity to
  defend herself against claims by Higgins that she had not supported her
  adequately and had mishandled the allegation. In her statement of claim,
  Reynolds accused Dreyfus of “misfeasance of public office” by denying her
  defence and claimed Dreyfus had a conflict of interest because of critical
  comments he made against her. Dreyfus declined to respond at the time of
  reporting. A case management hearing is listed for October. Documents released
  to the Western Australian supreme court last year showed Reynolds was asked
  not to attend the mediation in December 2022 or make any public commentary
  about Higgins and to maintain confidentiality of information related to the
  settlement and civil claims in order to give the commonwealth the “best
  position to achieve a resolution at the mediation”. The settlement was signed
  a week later. Where to from here for Higgins and Reynolds? In the immediate
  sense, Higgins has been ordered to pay $341,000 in damages and interest to
  Reynolds for two posts found defamatory by the courts. But she will also be on
  the hook for Reynolds’ and her own legal and court fees. That sum could push
  past $1m. In mid-2024, a spokesperson for Higgins said she was “forced to sell
  her home” in France to pay for legal costs associated with the defamation
  case. Reynolds’ financial challenges have also been publicly revealed with her
  lawyer, Martin Bennett, telling the WA supreme court the former senator had
  “mortgaged [her] house to the hilt to pay for litigation”.
