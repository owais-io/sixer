  Liverpool are advancing in talks with Crystal Palace over Marc Guéhi and are
  considering a move for the Parma centre-half Giovanni Leoni as they attempt to
  increase Arne Slot’s defensive options. Guéhi has been Liverpool’s main
  defensive target all summer and the club were encouraged to make an approach
  by an admission from the Palace chair, Steve Parish, that it would be better
  to sell the England international than lose him on a free next summer. Palace
  rejected bids of up to £70m from Newcastle for the 25-year-old defender last
  summer and Liverpool refused to consider the initial asking price at the start
  of this transfer window. However, with Palace taking a financial hit after
  losing their Europa League place and Guéhi in the final year of his contract,
  the Premier League champions hope to secure a deal for £35m. Negotiations are
  understood to have progressed smoothly on Tuesday. Liverpool are also
  interested in the 18-year-old Leoni, who impressed in the second half of last
  season for Parma and is regarded as one of the best defensive prospects in
  Europe. The club would like to add him and Guéhi to their squad. Leoni is also
  wanted by Inter. Their coach, Cristian Chivu, was in charge at Parma last
  season and could prove an influential factor in the player’s decision,
  although Liverpool have greater financial resources. Liverpool are ready to
  step up their interest in the 6ft 5in defender if they receive encouragement
  that he is open to leaving Italy. The Merseyside club have not made an
  approach to Parma. Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konaté are the only
  established central defenders available to Slot for the Premier League opener
  against Bournemouth on Friday. Liverpool have sold Jarell Quansah to Bayer
  Leverkusen and Joe Gomez missed the final games of pre-season with a minor
  achilles injury. Slot admitted after the Community Shield penalty shootout
  defeat against Palace that Liverpool’s defending in pre-season had been a
  cause for concern. Manchester United are exploring a move for Carlos Baleba,
  but are expected to have to pay a transfer record for an African player if
  they can persuade Brighton to sell the Cameroon midfielder. The 21-year-old
  has three years on his contract, which Brighton have an option to extend by 12
  months. Sources close to Baleba have indicated he is keen to join United if an
  agreement can be reached. Brighton are adamant he is not for sale, and it
  would require an offer well above the £72m Arsenal paid Lille for the Ivory
  Coast forward Nicolas Pépé in 2019 to tempt them into changing their stance.
  It may take more than £100m to sign a player rated as one of the best emerging
  talents in world football. Any United bid for Baleba is understood to be
  dependent on players being moved on, with Chelsea still in talks over a deal
  for Alejandro Garnacho and Milan interested in Rasmus Højlund. They have been
  trying to offload two others attackers, Jadon Sancho and Antony, who are on
  big wages. United have spent more than £200m this summer on the forwards
  Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, another Cameroon
  international. Baleba, who joined Brighton in 2023 from Lille for £23m, told
  the Guardian in March that he was happy at Brighton but said: “I want to be a
  big midfielder, to be a legend, across the world.” Brighton’s chief executive,
  Paul Barber, said last week at a fans’ forum that United had yet to be in
  touch, but acknowledged Baleba could leave. “Carlos is a fantastic talent,” he
  said. “We hope he’ll be here for years to come – but it’s subject to the
  dynamics of the football world, which isn’t always predictable.” West Ham’s
  opening offer of £30m for Mateus Fernandes has been rejected by Southampton.
  Fernandes is their top target in midfield, but the clubs are a long way apart
  on his valuation and a compromise is not close. Southampton, who signed
  Fernandes for £15m from Sporting last year, have quoted £50m for the
  21-year-old. West Ham are understood to have offered an initial £28m plus £2m
  in add-ons. They believe Southampton, one of the favourites for promotion from
  the Championship, want too much for a player with one season of Premier League
  football behind him. West Ham are prepared to explore alternative targets.
  They like Jacob Ramsey, but face a battle to convince the Aston Villa
  midfielder to join them. Newcastle have been linked with Ramsey. West Ham are
  also tracking Lille’s Ngal’ayel Mukau. Graham Potter wants more energy,
  dynamism and creativity in midfield. He regards Fernandes as a No 8 and is
  also keen to bring in a No 6, but West Ham will need sales if they are to sign
  more than one midfielder. They are struggling to find buyers for Edson
  Álvarez, Guido Rodríguez and Tomas Soucek. Álvarez is available for £20m, but
  is on big wages.
