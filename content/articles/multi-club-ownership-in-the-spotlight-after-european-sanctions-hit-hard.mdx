  Uefa is facing pressure to push back its deadline for separating ownership
  structures after a turbulent summer in which a handful of clubs, including
  Crystal Palace, were denied access to European competitions due to multi-club
  ownership rule-breaches. It is understood that a number of smaller sides
  within multi-club operations will lobby Uefa to put back the 1 March date by
  which they must demonstrate compliance with the regulations. Clubs are barred
  from appearing in the same competition if one individual is deemed to have
  decisive influence over them both; Palace were controversially found to have
  broken MCO rules because their then-largest shareholder, John Textor, also
  held a controlling stake in Lyon. Both teams qualified for the Europa League
  and Palace were ultimately demoted to the Conference League, beginning their
  campaign on Thursday with a 1-0 victory against Fredrikstad in the playoff
  first leg. Any change agreed by Uefa would mean backtracking on last season’s
  move to bring forward the deadline from 1 June. Palace believe that change was
  critical to their fate: they qualified for Europe by winning the FA Cup in May
  and claimed, with that prospect looking distant at the start of March, they
  had not been placed to meet the cut-off. That argument was rejected by Uefa’s
  club financial control body, whose decision was upheld on appeal by the court
  of arbitration for sport. The League of Ireland side Drogheda and Dunajska
  Streda, from Slovakia, also fell foul of the rules and were kicked out of
  Europe altogether after qualifying for the Conference League, alongside clubs
  to which they were connected. Multiple sources at governance and ownership
  levels agree changes are needed to ensure no repeats of this year’s confusion.
  It is an ongoing discussion in the corridors of power, although the nature of
  any resolution remains unclear. Uefa is understood to be reluctant to amend
  its regulations so soon after imposing the 1 March deadline, but its executive
  committee will discuss the situation when it meets in Tirana next month. The
  European Club Association, which runs all European competitions as part of a
  joint venture with Uefa, has sympathy with those affected and may be willing
  to intervene on their behalf if it receives a formal proposal in the next few
  weeks. “Uefa changed the rules as they concluded that 1 June was too close to
  the start of the qualifying rounds, but demanding clubs make governance
  changes during the middle of the season on the off-chance of having a good run
  seems a disproportionate response,” a source in one multi-club group said.
  “There would be no sporting integrity issues raised if they were given more
  time. And the smaller clubs, without huge scale and resources, will always be
  the ones most affected.” Ironically, another argument against the 1 March
  deadline stems from the case of Nottingham Forest, who have benefited from
  Palace’s problems by being promoted to the Europa League in their place,
  having made strong legal representations to Uefa and Cas. Before the Palace
  issue emerged, the Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis, had put his shares in
  the club into a blind trust in case they qualified for the Champions League
  along with his other club, Olympiakos. That ultimately proved unnecessary as
  Forest finished seventh in the Premier League last season to initially earn a
  Conference League place. Forest were effectively placed in a blind trust for
  all of six weeks. “To go through that process without it being required feels
  strange,” said a source at Uefa. The blind trust workaround is queried by some
  figures in the game, who doubt its effectiveness as a distancing strategy. One
  club owner notes that Marinakis hardly looked disengaged from Forest when
  confronting their manager, Nuno Espírito Santo, on the pitch after a draw with
  Leicester in May. There is a sense blind trusts will become increasingly
  common while remaining little more than a fig leaf. Few expected owners to
  change their strategies mid-course as a result of recent controversies. There
  is little anecdotal evidence of this summer’s problems deterring clubs from
  pursuing multi-club operations, or putting off investors in general. In the
  Premier League alone, Burnley’s owners, Velocity Sport Limited, bought a
  minority stake in Espanyol in July, while Fenway Sports Group is in talks with
  several Spanish clubs about joining their Liverpool-led stable. Nonetheless,
  the multi-club landscape looks certain to evolve over the coming years and
  different models are emerging. “Investors are likely to become more cautious
  and structured in how they manage multi-club relationships,” says Xander
  Czaikowski, chief executive of Estrella Football Group. “It pushes the
  industry towards more professionalised frameworks and clearer rules of
  engagement.” Estrella, who recently bought a stake in the Portuguese club
  Cascais and is in the final stages of several other deals, aims to invest in
  minority shares at between 10 and 20 smaller clubs. They would be treated
  non-hierarchically and share a digital club management platform; the thinking
  is that value can be created across multiple similarly sized operations rather
  than by prioritising the sporting results of one team. “We typically take
  minority stakes, precisely because of the regulatory environment,” Czaikowski
  says. “The shift is from a top-down, controlling MCO approach to one that is
  horizontal and collaborative.” Whether or not such approaches catch on,
  existing models will undoubtedly continue to face intense scrutiny. Earlier
  this week Ultra Boys 90, a Racing Strasbourg fan group, announced they will
  continue to fight against the ownership of Chelsea’s holding company, BlueCo,
  despite a relatively successful 2024-25 season that brought Conference League
  qualification. “The issues we’ve been raising have not magically disappeared,”
  their statement said. “Racing is no longer a club that makes decisions in its
  own interest.” Czaikowski is among those who believe Uefa’s rules focus
  disproportionately on ownership structures, while a deeper problem in the form
  of unsustainable financial models remains inadequately addressed. In the short
  term there is, at least, a consensus that recent mishaps must not be recur.
  Drogheda, whose owners also run Walsall and the Danish club Silkeborg, felt
  miscommunication over the regulations was a significant factor in their fate.
  “There’s a balance to be struck between encouraging investment and good
  governance, and we’re comfortable with where we are in general,” another
  source at Uefa added. “A bigger issue is whether all clubs and potential new
  investors actually know the rules. There’s more we can do to educate and help
  them I’m sure.”
