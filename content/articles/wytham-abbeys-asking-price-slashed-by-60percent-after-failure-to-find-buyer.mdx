  Wytham Abbey, a 15th-century grade I-listed manor that was once planned as a
  hub for technologists and philosophers to solve some of the world’s toughest
  problems, has had its sale price slashed by 60% to £5.95m as its charity
  owners struggle to find a buyer. The Effective Ventures Foundation (EVF),
  formerly the Centre for Effective Altruism, bought the 27-bedroom, 18-bathroom
  Oxfordshire estate in April 2022. Backed by the Facebook co-founder Dustin
  Moskovitz’s Open Philanthropy fund, EVF envisioned the property as a hub for
  global thinkers combining effective altruism and artificial intelligence to
  “benefit others as much as possible”. The charity’s other funders included
  Skype’s billionaire investor, Jaan Tallinn and Sam Bankman-Fried, the FTX
  founder who was jailed after his company collapsed. But EVF was forced to put
  the manor and extensive grounds up for sale for £15m last year after its
  backers withdrew support for the events venue. The property portal Rightmove
  said it was one of its five most-viewed homes of 2024 but with no sale agreed
  the asking price was reduced to £12m in June. It was cut again in August with
  the UK’s luxury property market struggling amid cooling interest from the
  world’s super rich and Labour’s tax changes. EVF said: “As part of its ongoing
  effort to maximise sale proceeds directed to high-impact charities, Effective
  Ventures has taken advice from leading surveyors and decided to lower the
  property’s guide price to encourage offers from actively interested
  prospective buyers.” Savills, the agency marketing the property, declined to
  comment. Over its six centuries, the abbey has welcomed guests including Queen
  Elizabeth I, Oliver Cromwell and Queen Victoria. Set in 9 hectare (23 acres)
  of grounds and parkland and built around 1480 from locally quarried limestone,
  it retains Tudor arched doorways. The Earl of Abingdon lavished money on
  improvements in the 19th century, adding to its grandeur. It has eight
  reception rooms, a Georgian-oak staircase, stained glass panels and a marble
  fireplace. At the time of its decision to sell the property, an EV
  spokesperson said: “Effective Ventures agreed with the abbey’s major donors at
  the time of the original purchase that they could recommend that EV sells the
  property if they believed there were higher-impact uses of the asset.” EVF’s
  parent group, Effective Ventures, repaid nearly $27m (£20m) last year to the
  FTX estate – equal to all the funds it received from entities linked to
  Bankman-Fried. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison in March 2024 for
  defrauding customers and investors of his crypto empire, which collapsed into
  bankruptcy from a valuation of $32bn.
