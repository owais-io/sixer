  On Tuesday, it was “Pressure rises on Reeves”, last Friday it was “a lift” for
  the chancellor (29 August). Before that, it was a “challenge” for Rachel
  Reeves (12 August)(22 July), a “gloomy autumn” (22 July)“UK economy shrinks
  unexpectedly in blow to Rachel Reeves” (14 March) and a “generational shift”
  in investment (10 June). Reeves must feel like Mary Earps, keeping goal with
  balls flying at her from multiple directions! But the more serious take on
  this is the tendency for the media, including the Guardian, to push the
  narrative of a fragile economy whose health is subject to very short-term,
  daily events. This is a narrative derived from the bond markets, which strive
  to reduce long-term stability to short-term volatility in order to multiply
  transactional opportunities. The time has long passed to exert the kinds of
  control on “casino capitalism” that were scrapped in the 1970s, and to
  reassert the priority of long-term thinking. There is no sign of Reeves doing
  that – in fact, almost the opposite. Some bond marketeers seem confident that
  the chancellor needs to keep the bond markets onside. Does she really? Perhaps
  we should start by challenging the narrative. Prof Saville Kushner Liverpool •
  With the British government’s need to balance the budget by raising taxes, why
  is there not more discussion about taxing people for polluting, given the
  worsening climate crisis? Why not consider bringing back vehicle taxes based
  on emissions (though be realistic about what plug-in hybrid electric vehicles
  (PHEVs) do – mine averages 120 miles per gallon, not the 250mpg claimed);
  increase taxes on aviation fuel, tax frequent flyers, tax heavy SUVs that
  enter cities, tax cruise ships that use diesel generators when they are
  docked. There are many taxes that can help reduce such harm to our planet. So,
  Rachel Reeves, take the blinkers off please, and also don’t be so afraid to
  tell greedy vested interests to get stuffed. This government has, to its
  credit, started an incentive for production to buy EVs produced using greener
  methods, so why not tax producers who use the most polluting methods? Dave
