  Alterations Almost 10 years after his death and nearly 50 after it was
  written, Guyana-born British playwright Michael Abbensetts’ tailoring comedy
  arrived at the National Theatre in February for Rufus Norris’s final season.
  Its director, Lynette Linton, hailed the decision to put it on “one of the
  biggest stages in the country, and highlight how incredible this man and his
  generation of writers were”. A triumph for Linton, it should encourage others
  to delve into the NT’s Black Plays Archive. Available from NT at Home from 12
  August. Bach’s St John Passion There’s more transfixing tailoring in this 2024
  dance production marking the 300th anniversary of Bach’s oratorio. The always
  arresting German choreographer Sasha Waltz introduces her dancers, in the
  nude, adjusting their smocks at sewing machines before donning the costumes
  for a spellbinding performance. On Arte. Trance Tianzhuo Chen’s 12-hour
  “theatre-rave” Trance, recently staged at London’s Southbank Centre, provokes
  some extreme reactions. “People say it’s the best performance ever,” says
  Chen. “They feel healed, cleansed.” Then again: “Some people really don’t like
  it!” Incredibly, the whole thing – shot in 2024 – is on YouTube, so you can
  make up your own mind. Don’t Cry for Me Argentina It’s the song of the summer
  in the West End, enchanting passersby outside the Palladium where it’s
  delivered from the balcony by Rachel Zegler (and her alternate, Bella Brown,
  who also has an incredible voice) in an alfresco swerve during Jamie Lloyd’s
  production. If you can’t catch it live, Zegler’s recording of the Tim
  Rice-Andrew Lloyd Webber perennial is now available. Statues The mix tape is
  having a moment, thanks to a new BBC romantic drama. But in playwright and
  performer Azan Ahmed’s solo show, the tape unspools a teacher’s relationship
  with his father. Esme Allman’s production, seen at the Bush theatre in 2024,
  is available from the Theatre Channel. Errol’s Garden With music and lyrics by
  Caroline Wigmore and Jen Green, Golden Toad Theatre’s audio musical on YouTube
  is based on the book by Gillian Hibbs about a green-fingered boy whose
  gardening projects grow all over his family’s flat. Aimed at children aged
  three to eight, it should brighten up summer journeys or rainy days at home.
  OOTFest25 (Un)seen IJAD Dance Company is on a mission to put technology at the
  heart of performance in order to “future-proof the arts and transform audience
  engagement”. In June it presented a hybrid theatre festival both online and at
  Hammersmith Studios. Five of those shows are now available on demand at Open
  Online Theatre until 4 August. Poor Clare Arsema Thomas, who landed a breakout
  role in Bridgerton prequel Queen Charlotte shortly after leaving Lamda, makes
  her professional stage debut at Richmond’s Orange Tree in a comedy spun from
  the stories of Saint Clare and Saint Francis of Assisi. Written by Chiara
  Atik, it’s directed by Blanche McIntyre and co-stars Freddy Carter. Available
  12-15 August.
