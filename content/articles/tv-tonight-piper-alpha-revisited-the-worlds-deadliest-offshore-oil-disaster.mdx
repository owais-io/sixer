  Disaster at Sea: The Piper Alpha Story 9pm, BBC Two In July 1988, 167 men died
  after a series of explosions tore apart the Piper Alpha oil platform off the
  coast of Aberdeen – it was the world’s deadliest offshore oil disaster. This
  three-part documentary details what happened and uses actors to deliver the
  testimonies given during the public inquiry. It also speaks to survivors and
  family members of victims as they still search for answers. The story starts
  with industrial decline and mass unemployment in 70s Britain. Hollie
  Richardson Fake Or Fortune: What Happened Next? 6.30pm, BBC One It’s the final
  episode of this series which revisits investigations into the provenance of
  paintings. It looks at a picture by Canadian impressionist Helen McNicoll,
  whose previous appearance led to a former owner coming forward. But did it end
  up being sold at auction? Alexi Duggins The Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo:
  75th Anniversary 8pm, BBC One After a public military tattoo called Something
  About a Soldier was held in Princes Street Gardens in the Scottish capital in
  1949, the first official tattoo took place the following year. As the event
  celebrates its 75th anniversary, the city is marking its 900th anniversary –
  so expect an even bigger showcase than usual. HR Jamie: Eat Yourself Healthy
  8pm, Channel 4 Jamie Oliver’s new series is all about finding convenient ways
  to cook healthy meals. In place of the demon Turkey Twizzlers, he is serving
  up a tasty chicken dish paired unexpectedly with blueberries. And, if salad’s
  more your speed, he also has an Insta-friendly recipe as colourful as it is
  nutrient-rich. Ellen E Jones University Challenge 8.30pm, BBC Two Amol Rajan
  oversees a clash between Cambridge’s Trinity College and Oxford’s Linacre
  College as the first-round heats of the brainy battle royale continue. Trinity
  has been overall champion three times – most recently in 2014 – so its squad
  may be feeling the pressure to rack up a good enough score to advance. Graeme
  Virtue Stacey Dooley Sleeps Over 9pm, U&amp;W The recent Bonnie Blue
  documentary failed to get inside the mind of a woman whose business model
  includes having sex with more than 1,000 men in a day. But Stacey Dooley is
  the exact person to sensitively interview Lily Phillips who, similarly to
  Blue, makes tabloid headlines with OnlyFans content and having sex with 100
  men in a day. HR Film choice The Godfather Part II (Francis Ford Coppola,
  1974), 10pm, BBC Two Francis Ford Coppola’s Oscar-winning return to the
  Corleone clan splices two narratives the viewer is invited to compare and
  contrast. In the present day, Michael struggles to grow his empire in the face
  of power plays and betrayals; in 1901, his father, Vito, arrives as a boy in
  New York and rises to criminal prominence. Robert De Niro is convincing as the
  young adult Vito, making his mark in a lovingly recreated Italian expat
  community, but Al Pacino has the greater impact as his successor – distant and
  controlling with his family but haunted by his choices. Simon Wardell Live
  sport Premier League Football: Newcastle v Liverpool 6.30pm, Sky Sports Main
  Event Kick-off at St James’ Park from 8pm.
