  When Christopher Stephens was a student at Oxford in the early 2000s, a friend
  asked him a favour: would he visit a man at his home in east Oxford each week
  and read to him? That man was Roger Butler, who was blind, in his 60s and
  initially wary of having a stranger come to his house. Before their first
  meeting, Butler asked their mutual friend whether Stephens was “one of us”, by
  which he meant gay. The pair soon established a bond, as Stephens read books
  by Alan Hollinghurst and Edmund White to Butler over a bottle of red wine.
  Sometimes Butler would ask him to read excerpts from his own autobiographical
  essays which told of his life growing up gay in postwar Britain. In 1960,
  Butler had joined forces with two colleagues from the Homosexual Law Reform
  Society and written a letter to national newspaper editors outing themselves.
  Beginning the letter with “Sir, we are homosexuals”, all were risking their
  freedom at a time when sex between men was illegal. The Light of Day tells the
  parallel stories of Stephens’s burgeoning friendship with Butler in his
  twilight years, and the latter’s life as a pioneer of gay liberation. While
  Stephens reads the chapters detailing his visits to Butler’s home, Griff
  Mellhuish narrates the sections about Butler’s early life. The audio version
  also features delightfully crackly home recordings made by Butler in which he
  discusses his parents and catches up on his correspondence. In a moving final
  clip, he notes that he doesn’t regret the blindness that struck in his 30s
  since it led to “the most miraculous thing”, which was moving to Oxford and
  meeting Stephens. • Available via Headline, 9hr 43min Further listening The
  Undisputed King of Selston Danny Scott, John Murray, 9hr 10min A poignant and
  funny memoir of life in a coal-mining town in the 1970s. Read by the author.
  The Violet Hour James Cahill, Sceptre, 12hr 46min Andrew Wincott narrates this
  gripping thriller about duplicity and power struggles in the art world.
