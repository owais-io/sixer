  You can get it if you really want. You really can. You can get it. Getting it
  is a distinct and achievable outcome. There is just one caveat. You do have to
  actually show some sign of wanting to get it, to throw a little risk to the
  wind. This seemed to be the catch for Mikel Arteta at Anfield, on a day where
  for long periods his Arsenal team were in the ascendancy, dishing up a
  performance that was assured and compact, but also a bit like watching a
  politician giving a campaign interview on live TV where the idea is to simply
  say nothing, wear the right tie, filibuster, convinced that if nothing happens
  then good things are probably happening. This felt like a kind of high-end
  Starmer-ball. Hold the line. Let the other guy lose. From the start Arsenal
  played in a way that said, well, it’s going to take something special to beat
  us today. The only problem with this is that quite often something special
  actually does happen. There is an irony in the fact a game of poker‑faced
  sideways manoeuvring was decided by the most brutally direct of moments. Or
  perhaps not irony. This was simply good sense and a case of seizing your
  moment when it arrives. Dominik Szoboszlai’s execution for the only goal of
  the game was stunning, beautifully pure and also notable for its blatant lack
  of disguise. Curtis Jones took the ball on the half turn and was fouled 32
  yards out. Szoboszlai stood alone over the free‑kick, no decoy, no
  misdirection, a straight run that said this is going nowhere except at goal.
  Watch while I put this ball into the top corner past David Raya’s flailing
  right hand. And so he did, taking six paces, striking the ball up and over the
  top of the wall, sending it curving and dipping away from David Raya’s
  flailing right hand and into the top corner. Arteta later dismissed this as a
  moment of brilliance, something you just can’t plan for. And, to be fair,
  football is always absurdly outcome-based in its narratives. Why didn’t you
  just try to win, Mikel? Why not score goals, why not lay on a banquet of
  free-flowing devastation, seizing the day, blowing smoke from your nostrils.
  Thrilling us all with your cold, hard will to power? Why not do that? But
  sport is always telling you things. And this was also a great game for Arne
  Slot, whose repurposed right-back, the princely Szoboszlai, has now won a huge
  league game late on twice in a week. Whereas for Arsenal that sense of a
  missed opportunity will linger, because there was more here for them than they
  ever tried to take. Anfield had been drenched in watery late summer sun at
  kick-off, the pitch a perfect soft lime green. The opening act was a hard,
  flat, pre-planned Arsenal touch finder over the head of Szoboszlai, a Rob
  Andrew-style move for position and structure up the pitch. The approach seemed
  fair. No quarter. Keep the zero with which you came into the game. But Arsenal
  also played well enough early on to create a sense of something more. Arteta
  had picked a conservative-looking team, with three solid central midfielders
  up against Slot’s more chancy Gravenberch‑Mac Allister pivot. Alexis Mac
  Allister had started one game since April. Arsenal are a weather front in
  midfield. They began, if not to dominate then to gain a numerical hand. And
  then, nothing happened. A splinter had been prised away from the door. Nobody
  crashed through it. And this kept happening. Szoboszlai isn’t a specialist
  right-back, doesn’t have the grooved defensive body shapes, the muscle memory.
  He must have been delighted to face Gabriel Martinelli, who presents only one
  challenge – a straight-line foot race. You don’t pick Martinelli for goals.
  You pick him for yardage. He’s a diesel estate player, a fleet car player,
  low-risk motorway miles. With nine minutes gone Martinelli led a
  four‑versus‑three break and just shielded the ball all the way to the byline.
  Guys, we’re definitely not conceding from this breakaway attack. Is this the
  way to win a league? With a super quick winger who basically spends 90 minutes
  doing shuttle runs near a game of football? Another advantage had presented
  itself. Again, nothing happened. Arsenal had other points of strength, most
  notably a right‑footed right‑winger and a No 9 in the box. Noni Madueke seemed
  to have the run of Milos Kerkez. He didn’t see the ball enough, didn’t get it
  quickly enough, had to wait as the system scrolled through its patterns. In
  the centre Arteta came to Anfield with a bullocking centre-forward, and rare
  opportunity to at least disturb Virgil Van Dijk, whose game is as act of
  minimalism these days. Less Van Dijk is more Liverpool. Unmussed, unbothered
  Van Dijk is a barometer of victory. What’s his sweat reading? Is the hair
  still perfect? Instead Viktor Gyökeres touched the ball twice in the opening
  half hour. He wrestled endlessly with Ibrahima Konaté, all flailing arms and
  legs and biceps. Again, an opportunity went unexplored. Arsenal did
  successfully rack up five corners, then watched Declan Rice spoon and punt and
  swirl them into weird areas. Meanwhile Liverpool stuttered a little. They
  played in bursts. By half-time it felt like a game still firing up the warp
  drive, plotting the angle of ascent. And this was always a problem for
  Arsenal, because it was also their chance to win it. Before long Liverpool had
  re-geared, with Curtis Jones on and more space on Mo Salah’s flank. Arteta did
  the right thing, bringing on Martin Ødegaard and Eberechi Eze. But the tension
  had relaxed. Liverpool always looked like the only team that was going to win
  from there. It would still be unfair to call this a big chance missed. It was
  more a failure to try hard enough to make it one, to be happy instead with a
  cagey, processed parity, sport without rage or risk. By the end a close 1-0
  defeat felt a little more than a close 1-0 defeat, shot through with a sense
  of flinching with the moment there to be seized.
