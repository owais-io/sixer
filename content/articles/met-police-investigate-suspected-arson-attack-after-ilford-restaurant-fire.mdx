  Scotland Yard is investigating a suspected arson attack on a restaurant in
  Ilford, east London, which has left three people in a life-threatening
  condition. Police, paramedics and firefighters were called to the scene in
  Woodford Avenue, Gants Hill, at about 9pm on Friday. Firefighters rescued five
  people from the restaurant after part of the ground floor was damaged, with
  nine others able to get out beforehand, London fire brigade said. Five people
  were injured, three of them in a life-threatening condition, the Metropolitan
  police said. They were all treated at the scene for burns and smoke inhalation
  before being taken to hospital. A London fire brigade spokesperson said: “The
  brigade’s control officers received seven calls about the fire and mobilised
  crews from Ilford, Hainault, Leytonstone and Woodford fire stations to the
  scene. The fire was extinguished by 10.32pm. “The cause of the fire is being
  investigated by the brigade and the Metropolitan police service.” No arrests
  have been made. A local resident, Edward Thawe, 43, stepped outside his nearby
  home with his 12-year-old son to see whether he could help after hearing
  screaming on the road. The police and ambulance were already at the scene,
  which Thawe, a hospital porter, described as “horrible” and “more than scary”
  and something you did not “want to look at twice”. He said: “I heard screaming
  and people saying they had called the police. I came outside [the shop] and
  there was a man with his skin peeled off. His skin was burnt. I did not want
  to look at it.” DCI Mark Rogers, of the Met’s central specialist crime north
  unit, said: “We understand this incident will cause concern within the
  community. My team of specialist detectives are working at speed to piece the
  incident together. “Locals can expect to see a large police presence in the
  area. If you have any concerns, please speak to those officers on the ground.”
  Uniformed officers guarded the police cordon in place on Saturday as forensic
  officers in protective clothing examined the scene. A trail of what appeared
  to be bloody footprints along the pavement were found by a forensic officer.
  The health secretary, Wes Streeting, MP for Ilford North, posted on X: “Huge
  thanks to @metpoliceuk @LondonFire @Ldn_Ambulance for their response to a
  serious incident on Gants Hill/Woodford Avenue this evening. “Please avoid the
  area for now. Further updates will follow from @RedbridgeLive and emergency
  services.” Anyone with information is urged to contact the Met via 101,
  quoting 7559/22AUG. Those who wish to remain anonymous can speak with
  Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
