  Two-term Iowa Republican senator Joni Ernst has decided to officially bow out
  of a re-election bid. “After a tremendous amount of prayer and reflection, I
  will not be seeking re-election in 2026”, Ernst said in a video announcement.
  Ernst is the first woman combat veteran to serve in the Senate, where
  Republicans hold a narrow 53-47 majority. A group of the US’s leading climate
  scientists have compiled a withering review of a controversial Trump
  administration report that downplays the risks of the climate crisis, finding
  that the document is biased, riddled with errors and fails basic scientific
  credibility. More than 85 climate experts have contributed to a comprehensive
  434-page report that excoriates a US Department of Energy (DOE) document
  written by five hand-picked fringe researchers that argues that global heating
  and its resulting consequences have been overstated. The Trump administration
  report, released in July, contains “pervasive problems with misrepresentation
  and selective citation of the scientific literature, cherry-picking of data,
  and faulty or absent statistics”, states the new analysis, which is written in
  the style of the authoritative Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
  (IPCC) reports. “This report makes a mockery of science,” said Andrew Dessler,
  a climate scientist at Texas A&amp;M University. “It relies on ideas that were
  rejected long ago, supported by misrepresentations of the body of scientific
  knowledge, omissions of important facts, arm waving, anecdotes and
  confirmation bias. This report makes it clear DOE has no interest in engaging
  with the scientific community.” Amy Coney Barrett, the conservative supreme
  court justice whose controversial fast-track confirmation at the end of Donald
  Trump’s first presidency led directly to the panel’s vote to strike down
  abortion rights nationally, has expressed in a new memoir her belief that the
  ruling “respected the choice” of the American people. Barrett was paid a $2m
  advance for her book Listening to the Law, according to CNN, which obtained a
  copy and published brief extracts on Tuesday, a week before its 9 September
  publication. “[T]he court’s role is to respect the choices that the people
  have agreed upon, not to tell them what they should agree to,” Barrett writes,
  according to CNN. The outlet framed Barrett’s comment as reflecting her belief
  that her predecessors’ 7-2 vote in Roe v Wade had “usurped the will of the
  American people”. Rudy Giuliani’s hospital discharge comes a day after Donald
  Trump said he will award him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s
  highest civilian honor, the Associated Press reported. The decision places the
  award on a man once lauded for leading New York after the September 11, 2001,
  attacks and later sanctioned by courts and disbarred for amplifying false
  claims about the 2020 US presidential election. Giuliani, the former New York
  mayor, was also criminally charged in two states; he has denied wrongdoing.
  Trump on his Truth Social platform called Giuliani the “greatest Mayor in the
  history of New York City, and an equally great American Patriot”. Rudy
  Giuliani has been discharged from the hospital and is “progressing well”
  following a car collision in New Hampshire on Saturday, his spokesperson Ted
  Goodman said. “The mayor would like to thank the New Hampshire State Police,
  paramedics, Elliot Hospital, and all the physicians and nurses who provided
  incredible care” Goodman added. California governor Gavin Newsom responded to
  his state’s federal court win that Trump’s deployment of national guard troops
  in Los Angeles this summer was illegal. “DONALD TRUMP LOSES AGAIN” Newsom
  posted on X. “The courts agree -- his militarization of our streets and use of
  the military against US citizens is ILLEGAL.” According to Reuters, the Trump
  administration is planning to announce that it will relocate the headquarters
  of US Space Command from Colorado Springs, Colorado, to Huntsville, Alabama,
  sources familiar with the deliberations told the outlet. The decision is a
  reversal of the Biden administration’s choice in 2023, when Colorado Springs
  was selected as the permanent home for the military’s newest combatant command
  after an extensive review process. Space Command currently operates from
  Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado Springs on an interim basis, where it
  has been headquartered since its reestablishment under Trump in 2019. A live
  streaming link ahead of the 2pm ET Trump announcement posted by the Defense
  Visual Information Distribution Service (DVIDS), the US military’s official
  media distribution arm, describes the event as a “US Space Command HQ
  Announcement”. A Washington judge has found that Trump illegally deployed
  National Guard troops during immigration enforcement operations in Los Angeles
  this summer. Judge Charles Breyer ruled that sending military personnel
  alongside immigration agents violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars the
  armed forces from domestic law enforcement. California brought the legal
  challenge against the federal government. The Trump administration argued the
  troops were only protecting federal officers, not conducting arrests
  themselves. The judge did not order the remaining military personnel to be
  withdrawn. Nadler is one of the most influential House Democrats in office,
  and represents a high-profile Manhattan district steeped in prominent
  fundraising and media attention. A member of the progressive caucus, the
  78-year-old built a reputation as a reliable voice on issues like abortion
  rights, LGBTQ rights, and government accountability. Unlike Democratic party
  leaders and New Yorkers Hakeem Jeffries and senator Chuck Schumer, Nadler
  endorsed Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani ahead of the general
  election. New York representative Jerry Nadler officially announced that he
  will relinquish his seat next election after serving over three decades in
  Congress. “This decision has not been easy” he wrote in the statement. “But I
  know in my heart it is the right one and that it is the right time to pass the
  torch to a new generation”. There are murmurs that instead the “exciting
  announcement” will be about renaming the Department of Defense to the
  “Department of War” – it’s former name previously discontinued in 1947. A
  number of news outlets reported ahead of Labor Day that the White House had
  been working up plans for the reverted name, citing a White House official. In
  his latest posting on Truth Social, Trump wrote: “CHICAGO IS THE MURDER
  CAPITAL OF THE WORLD!” In late August, Pentagon sources told the Washington
  Post and Rolling Stone that planning was actively underway for a national
  guard operation in Chicago, though no final decision had been announced. When
  asked at the time, a Pentagon official told the Guardian “we won’t speculate
  on further operations” and that the department is “continuously working” with
  other agencies on “plans to protect federal assets and personnel”. It’s still
  unclear what the announcement will touch on, but the White House rapid
  response team shared a Trump post from Truth Social this morning saying that
  “Chicago is the worst and most dangerous city in the World, by far’” and added
  “[governor JB] Pritzker needs help badly, he just doesn’t know it yet”. “I
  will solve the crime problem fast, just like I did in DC”, he wrote. Donald
  Trump’s “exciting announcement” expected at 2pm ET will be “related to the
  Department of Defense”, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.
  Representatives Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna plan to hold a news conference
  tomorrow with survivors of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse as the political
  fallout from the saga continues to engage Congress on several fronts. The two
  lawmakers hope to receive the necessary signatures on their discharge petition
  to force a floor vote on a measure compelling the release of the Epstein
  files. Democrats are eager to keep pressing on the Epstein files, especially
  after the Trump administration reneged on pledges for transparency, AP
  reports. The case for years has been the subject of online conspiracy theories
  and speculation about who may have been involved or aware of the wealthy
  financier’s abuse. The House left Washington in July in the midst of
  disagreements among Republicans about whether they should force the Trump
  administration to release more information on the sex trafficking
  investigation into the late Epstein. The arrest of a US army veteran who
  protested against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown has raised
  alarms among legal experts and fellow veterans familiar with his service in
  Afghanistan. Bajun Mavalwalla II – a former army sergeant who survived a
  roadside bomb blast on a special operations mission in Afghanistan – was
  charged in July with “conspiracy to impede or injure officers” after joining a
  demonstration against federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) in
  Spokane, Washington. Legal experts say the case marks an escalation in the
  administration’s attacks on first amendment rights. Afghanistan war veterans
  who know him say the case against Mavalwalla appears unjust. “Here’s a guy who
  held a top secret clearance and was privy to some of the most sensitive
  information we have, who served in a combat zone,” said Kenneth Koop, a
  retired colonel who trained the Afghan military and police during Mavalwalla’s
  deployment. “To see him treated like this really sticks in my craw.” The 11
  June protest against Ice that led to Mavalwalla’s arrest was confrontational,
  leaving a government van’s windshield smashed and tires slashed, but
  Mavalwalla was not among the more than two dozen people arrested at the scene.
  More than a month passed before the FBI arrived at his door on 15 July. The
  35-year-old, who used his GI Bill to earn a degree in sustainable communities
  from Sonoma State University, was set to move into a 3,000-sq-ft house that
  day, which he had bought with his girlfriend, a nurse and fellow Afghanistan
  war veteran, with the help of a loan backed by the Department of Veterans
  Affairs. Woody Allen has said he was impressed by the acting abilities of
  Donald Trump when he directed the now-president in the 1998 film Celebrity.
  Speaking on Bill Maher’s Club Random, Allen said Trump was “a pleasure to work
  with and a very good actor”. He continued: “He was very polite, hit his mark,
  did everything correctly and had a real flair for show business. I could
  direct him now. If he would let me direct him now that he’s president, I think
  I could do wonders.” In Allen’s ensemble film starring Leonardo DiCaprio,
  Trump has a fleeting scene in which he’s interviewed about his forthcoming
  projects by a TV reporter. In a rare – scripted – instance of irony and
  deprecation, Trump replies that he’s “working on buying St Patrick’s
  Cathedral. Maybe doing a little rip-down job and putting up a very, very tall
  and beautiful building.” Allen went on to say that Trump had a “charismatic
  quality” in front of the camera, was “pleasant, very professional, very
  polite” and that he was “surprised he wanted to go into politics”. Nine former
  officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have said that
  Robert F Kennedy Jr’s leadership of the US health and human services
  department is “unlike anything our country has ever experienced” and
  “unacceptable”. They also warned that Kennedy’s leadership “should alarm every
  American, regardless of political leanings”. In a guest essay for the New York
  Times, the former CDC leaders said Kennedy’s actions were “unlike anything we
  have ever seen at the agency”. The letter comes days after Kennedy sought to
  dismiss Susan Monarez, the CDC director he appointed just months earlier.
  Monarez refused to leave her post, and was later fired by Donald Trump.
  Monarez said through lawyers the clash came after she refused to sign off on
  Kennedy’s directives. In the essay, titled We Ran the C.D.C.: Kennedy Is
  Endangering Every American’s Health, the former leaders, including Rochelle P
  Walensky, Mandy Cohen and Tom Frieden, said they were concerned Kennedy is
  “focusing “on unproven ‘treatments’ while downplaying vaccines” and cancelling
  medical research “that will leave us ill prepared for future health
  emergencies”. The former officials accused Kennedy of replacing “experts on
  federal health advisory committees with unqualified individuals who share his
  dangerous and unscientific views”. Representative Jerry Nadler, a Democrat
  from Manhattan who played a major role in both impeachments of president
  Donald Trump, will not seek re-election in 2026 after holding his seat for 34
  years, the New York Times reported on Monday, citing an interview with Nadler.
  His office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request to confirm the
  report. Nadler, 78, a liberal voice in Congress since 1992, said he believed
  it was time for a younger generation of Democrats to emerge. Questions
  surrounding leadership age and generational change rocked the Democrats in
  2024, when president Joe Biden, then 81, stepped down late in the presidential
  campaign amid concerns about his age. “Watching the Biden thing really said
  something about the necessity for generational change in the party, and I
  think I want to respect that,” Nadler told the Times. Donald Trump said on
  Monday he would award Rudy Giuliani the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the
  nation’s highest civilian honor, two days after his longtime political ally
  was seriously injured in a car crash. The decision places the award on a man
  once lauded for leading New York after the September 11, 2001, attacks and
  later sanctioned by courts and disbarred for amplifying false claims about the
  2020 US presidential election. Giuliani, the former New York mayor, was also
  criminally charged in two states; he has denied wrongdoing. Trump on his Truth
  Social platform called Giuliani the “greatest Mayor in the history of New York
  City, and an equally great American Patriot”. For much of the past two
  decades, Giuliani’s public life has been defined by a striking rise and fall.
  After leading New York through the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, he mounted a
  brief campaign for the Republican presidential nomination and became one of
  the most recognizable political figures in the country. But as Trump’s
  personal lawyer, he became a central figure in efforts to overturn the 2020
  election. Courts repeatedly rejected the fraud claims he advanced, and two
  former Georgia election workers won a $148m defamation judgment against him.
  Donald Trump is scheduled to make an announcement from the Oval Office on
  Tuesday afternoon at 2pm ET, according to the White House, which has yet to
  release further information. Some speculation suggests the announcement could
  be to do with plans to send national guard troops to Chicago. The Department
  of Homeland Security secretary, Kristi Noem, and the border tsar, Tom Homan,
  have both said Ice raids will intensify nationwide starting this week,
  possibly including staging operations from the Great Lakes naval station near
  north Chicago. The city’s mayor said his office is preparing for the
  deployment of federal officers by the end of the week. As Labor Day rallies
  took place across the US, the Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson sharply denounced
  the Trump administration’s threat to deploy federal troops to the city as part
  of an immigration crackdown. “No federal troops in the city of Chicago,” said
  Johnson on Monday to a gathered crowd at the “Workers over Billionaires”
  demonstration in Chicago’s West Loop neighborhood. Johnson added: “We’re going
  to defend our democracy … we’re going to protect the humanity of every single
  person in the city of Chicago.” Johnson later led the crowd in chants of “No
  troops in Chicago” and “Invest in Chicago”, the New York Times reported, amid
  speculation that national guard troops could be deployed as early as this
  week. Protesters also met outside the Trump Tower in the city’s River North
  neighborhood, carrying anti-Trump posters and chanting “Lock him up”,
  according to footage posted to social media. Monday’s rally in Chicago was one
  of hundreds of protests organized across the country as part of the national
  “Workers Over Billionaires” effort, a mass action calling for the protection
  of social safety nets such as Social Security; the funding of public schools,
  healthcare, and housing; amid other demands. “Together we will demand a
  country that puts workers over billionaires,” said the May Day Strong group, a
  coalition to labor unions, in a statement about the event. Hello and welcome
  to the US politics liveblog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all
  the latest news lines over the next few hours. We start with the news that
  Congress returns from a month-long summer break on Tuesday with less than a
  month left for lawmakers to agree on a deal to keep the government funded past
  30 September. Failure to do so would trigger a part-shutdown and amid deep
  partisan divisions, as well as Democratic anger over the Trump
  administration’s decision not to spend some congressionally approved funds,
  tempers have reached boiling point. The annual spending battle will dominate
  the September agenda, along with a possible effort by Senate Republicans to
  change their chamber’s rules to thwart Democratic stalling tactics on
  nominations, AP reports. In the House, Republicans will continue their
  investigations of the former president Joe Biden while the speaker, Mike
  Johnson, navigates a split in his conference over whether the Trump
  administration should release more files in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation.
  But the most urgent task for Congress is to avoid a government shutdown at the
  end of the month, when federal funding runs out, and it’s so far unclear if
  Republicans and Democrats will be able to agree on how to do that. “Trump is
  rooting for a shutdown,” senator Chris Murphy posted on social media on
  Friday. Congress will have to pass a short-term spending measure to keep the
  government funded for a few weeks or months while they try to finish the
  full-year package. But Republicans will need Democratic votes to pass an
  extension, and Democrats will want significant concessions. The Trump
  administration’s efforts to claw back previously approved spending could also
  complicate the negotiations. Republicans passed legislation this summer that
  rescinded about $9bn in foreign aid and public broadcasting funds and Trump
  notified Congress again on Friday that he will block $4.9bn in congressionally
  approved foreign aid. In other developments: President Donald Trump is
  scheduled to make an announcement from the Oval Office on Tuesday afternoon at
  2pm ET, according to the White House, which has yet to release further
  information. Some speculation suggests the announcement could be to do with
  plans to send national guard troops to Chicago. The Department of Homeland
  Security secretary, Kristi Noem, and the border tsar, Tom Homan, have both
  said Ice raids will intensify nationwide starting this week, possibly
  including staging operations from the Great Lakes naval station near north
  Chicago. The city’s mayor said his office is preparing for the deployment of
  federal officers by the end of the week. Representatives Thomas Massie and Ro
  Khanna plan to hold a news conference tomorrow with survivors of Jeffrey
  Epstein’s sexual abuse as the political fallout from the saga continues to
  engage Congress on several fronts. The two lawmakers hope to receive the
  necessary signatures on their discharge petition to force a floor vote on a
  measure compelling the release of the Epstein files, ABC News reports.
  Missouri Republicans are poised to redraw their state’s congressional lines to
  help maintain the Republican majority in the House. Governor Mike Kehoe
  announced a special legislative session to draw a new voting map would start
  on Wednesday. Trump’s attempt to influence the US Federal Reserve could pose a
  “very serious danger” for the world economy, the head of the European Central
  Bank has warned. Christine Lagarde, the president of the ECB, said Trump
  undermining the independence of the world’s most powerful central bank would
  have an impact for the US and other countries. Nine former officials at the
  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have said that Robert F Kennedy
  Jr’s leadership of the US health and human services department is “unlike
  anything our country has ever experienced” and “unacceptable”. They also
  warned that Kennedy’s leadership “should alarm every American, regardless of
  political leanings”. Guatemala is ready and willing to receive about 150
  unaccompanied children of all ages each week from the US, the country’s
  president has said, a day after a US federal judge halted the deportation of
  10 Guatemalan children. Those children had already boarded a plane when a
  court responded to an emergency appeal on Sunday. They were later returned to
  the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement. The president said on
  Monday he would award Rudy Giuliani the nation’s highest civilian honour, the
  Presidential Medal of Freedom, two days after his longtime political ally was
  seriously injured in a car crash. The decision places the award on a man once
  lauded for leading New York after the 11 September 2001 attacks and later
  sanctioned by courts and disbarred for amplifying false claims about the 2020
  US presidential election. Giuliani, the former New York mayor, was also
  criminally charged in two states; he has denied wrongdoing. Hundreds of
  protests organised as part of the national “workers over billionaires” effort
  – a mass action calling for the protection of social safety – were held in
  cities large and small across the country, including New York, Houston,
  Washington DC and Los Angeles on Monday. As the Labor Day rallies took place,
  Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson sharply denounced the Trump administration’s
  threat to deploy federal troops to the city as part of an immigration
  crackdown. Woody Allen wants Donald Trump to star in another of his films,
  apparently. Trump shared the Variety story on Truth Social. “I’m one of the
  few people who can say he directed Trump. I directed Trump in [‘Celebrity’],”
  Allen said. “He was a pleasure to work with and a very good actor.”

In the essay, titled We Ran the C.D.C.: Kennedy Is Endangering Every American’s Health, the former leaders, including Rochelle P Walensky, Mandy Cohen and Tom Frieden, said they were concerned Kennedy is “focusing “on unproven ‘treatments’ while downplaying vaccines” and cancelling medical research “that will leave us ill prepared for future health emergencies”. The former officials accused Kennedy of replacing “experts on federal health advisory committees with unqualified individuals who share his dangerous and unscientific views”. Representative Jerry Nadler, a Democrat from Manhattan who played a major role in both impeachments of president Donald Trump, will not seek re-election in 2026 after holding his seat for 34 years, the New York Times reported on Monday, citing an interview with Nadler. His office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request to confirm the report. Nadler, 78, a liberal voice in Congress since 1992, said he believed it was time for a younger generation of Democrats to emerge. Questions surrounding leadership age and generational change rocked the Democrats in 2024, when president Joe Biden, then 81, stepped down late in the presidential campaign amid concerns about his age. “Watching the Biden thing really said something about the necessity for generational change in the party, and I think I want to respect that,” Nadler told the Times. Donald Trump said on Monday he would award Rudy Giuliani the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, two days after his longtime political ally was seriously injured in a car crash. The decision places the award on a man once lauded for leading New York after the September 11, 2001, attacks and later sanctioned by courts and disbarred for amplifying false claims about the 2020 US presidential election. Giuliani, the former New York mayor, was also criminally charged in two states; he has denied wrongdoing. Trump on his Truth Social platform called Giuliani the “greatest Mayor in the history of New York City, and an equally great American Patriot”. For much of the past two decades, Giuliani’s public life has been defined by a striking rise and fall. After leading New York through the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, he mounted a brief campaign for the Republican presidential nomination and became one of the most recognizable political figures in the country. But as Trump’s personal lawyer, he became a central figure in efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Courts repeatedly rejected the fraud claims he advanced, and two former Georgia election workers won a $148m defamation judgment against him. Donald Trump is scheduled to make an announcement from the Oval Office on Tuesday afternoon at 2pm ET, according to the White House, which has yet to release further information. Some speculation suggests the announcement could be to do with plans to send national guard troops to Chicago. The Department of Homeland Security secretary, Kristi Noem, and the border tsar, Tom Homan, have both said Ice raids will intensify nationwide starting this week, possibly including staging operations from the Great Lakes naval station near north Chicago. The city’s mayor said his office is preparing for the deployment of federal officers by the end of the week. As Labor Day rallies took place across the US, the Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson sharply denounced the Trump administration’s threat to deploy federal troops to the city as part of an immigration crackdown. “No federal troops in the city of Chicago,” said Johnson on Monday to a gathered crowd at the “Workers over Billionaires” demonstration in Chicago’s West Loop neighborhood. Johnson added: “We’re going to defend our democracy … we’re going to protect the humanity of every single person in the city of Chicago.” Johnson later led the crowd in chants of “No troops in Chicago” and “Invest in Chicago”, the New York Times reported, amid speculation that national guard troops could be deployed as early as this week. Protesters also met outside the Trump Tower in the city’s River North neighborhood, carrying anti-Trump posters and chanting “Lock him up”, according to footage posted to social media. Monday’s rally in Chicago was one of hundreds of protests organized across the country as part of the national “Workers Over Billionaires” effort, a mass action calling for the protection of social safety nets such as Social Security; the funding of public schools, healthcare, and housing; amid other demands. “Together we will demand a country that puts workers over billionaires,” said the May Day Strong group, a coalition to labor unions, in a statement about the event. Hello and welcome to the US politics liveblog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest news lines over the next few hours. We start with the news that Congress returns from a month-long summer break on Tuesday with less than a month left for lawmakers to agree on a deal to keep the government funded past 30 September. Failure to do so would trigger a part-shutdown and amid deep partisan divisions, as well as Democratic anger over the Trump administration’s decision not to spend some congressionally approved funds, tempers have reached boiling point. The annual spending battle will dominate the September agenda, along with a possible effort by Senate Republicans to change their chamber’s rules to thwart Democratic stalling tactics on nominations, AP reports. In the House, Republicans will continue their investigations of the former president Joe Biden while the speaker, Mike Johnson, navigates a split in his conference over whether the Trump administration should release more files in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. But the most urgent task for Congress is to avoid a government shutdown at the end of the month, when federal funding runs out, and it’s so far unclear if Republicans and Democrats will be able to agree on how to do that. “Trump is rooting for a shutdown,” senator Chris Murphy posted on social media on Friday. Congress will have to pass a short-term spending measure to keep the government funded for a few weeks or months while they try to finish the full-year package. But Republicans will need Democratic votes to pass an extension, and Democrats will want significant concessions. The Trump administration’s efforts to claw back previously approved spending could also complicate the negotiations. Republicans passed legislation this summer that rescinded about $9bn in foreign aid and public broadcasting funds and Trump notified Congress again on Friday that he will block $4.9bn in congressionally approved foreign aid.

The city’s mayor said his office is preparing for the deployment of federal officers by the end of the week. Representatives Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna plan to hold a news conference tomorrow with survivors of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse as the political fallout from the saga continues to engage Congress on several fronts. The two lawmakers hope to receive the necessary signatures on their discharge petition to force a floor vote on a measure compelling the release of the Epstein files, ABC News reports. Missouri Republicans are poised to redraw their state’s congressional lines to help maintain the Republican majority in the House. Governor Mike Kehoe announced a special legislative session to draw a new voting map would start on Wednesday. Trump’s attempt to influence the US Federal Reserve could pose a “very serious danger” for the world economy, the head of the European Central Bank has warned. Christine Lagarde, the president of the ECB, said Trump undermining the independence of the world’s most powerful central bank would have an impact for the US and other countries. Nine former officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have said that Robert F Kennedy Jr’s leadership of the US health and human services department is “unlike anything our country has ever experienced” and “unacceptable”. They also warned that Kennedy’s leadership “should alarm every American, regardless of political leanings”. Guatemala is ready and willing to receive about 150 unaccompanied children of all ages each week from the US, the country’s president has said, a day after a US federal judge halted the deportation of 10 Guatemalan children. Those children had already boarded a plane when a court responded to an emergency appeal on Sunday. They were later returned to the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement. The president said on Monday he would award Rudy Giuliani the nation’s highest civilian honour, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, two days after his longtime political ally was seriously injured in a car crash.

Hundreds of protests organised as part of the national “workers over billionaires” effort – a mass action calling for the protection of social safety – were held in cities large and small across the country, including New York, Houston, Washington DC and Los Angeles on Monday. As the Labor Day rallies took place, Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson sharply denounced the Trump administration’s threat to deploy federal troops to the city as part of an immigration crackdown. Woody Allen wants Donald Trump to star in another of his films, apparently. Trump shared the Variety story on Truth Social. “I’m one of the few people who can say he directed Trump. I directed Trump in [‘Celebrity’],” Allen said. “He was a pleasure to work with and a very good actor.”
