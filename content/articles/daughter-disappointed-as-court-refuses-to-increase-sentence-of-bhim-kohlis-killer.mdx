  The daughter of an 80-year-old man who was killed last September has said she
  is “disappointed” after the court of appeal refused to increase the sentence
  of a teenage boy convicted of his death. Susan Kohli, whose father, Bhim
  Kohli, died after being assaulted by two teenagers while walking his dog near
  his home in Braunstone Town, Leicestershire, has called for sentencing
  guidelines to be changed, feeling that the duo who killed him should have
  faced harsher sentences than they received in June. “We need to go to
  parliament to get these guidelines changed, to hold these youths responsible
  for what they do,” she said. “We should not have to lose somebody else to
  these youngsters.” The boy, aged 15 at the time of sentencing, was found
  guilty of manslaughter in April. He received a seven-year custodial sentence,
  while his accomplice, a girl aged 13, was given a three-year rehabilitation
  order with a six-month curfew and community service. Neither can be named for
  legal reasons. The solicitor general, Lucy Rigby, who referred the boy’s
  sentence to the court of appeal under the unduly lenient sentence scheme, said
  she believed the case’s seriousness qualified the sentence for reconsideration
  but respected the court’s decision, and that her thoughts were with Kohli’s
  “friends and family, and everyone impacted by this horrendous crime”. The
  boy’s defence team attempted to have the sentence reduced. At a hearing on
  Wednesday, Lady Justice Macur, who assessed the case alongside Mrs Justice
  Cutts and Mr Justice Murray, said the current sentence was neither unduly
  lenient nor excessive, calling it a “very significant sentence and necessarily
  so”. She said the sentence was “entirely warranted by the seriousness of the
  offence. It is unarguable that the sentence was manifestly excessive.”
  Speaking after the pair were first sentenced in June, Susan Kohli claimed her
  father had been repeatedly targeted by youths in the area, with the abuse
  being racially motivated, something that both teenagers denied while standing
  trial. She also claimed that the police were aware of the problem and should
  have had a greater presence in the area. Kohli, who was found by his family
  after the beating, told a paramedic that he had been called slurs during the
  assault, which resulted in a broken neck and three broken ribs. He was taken
  to hospital but died the next day. During the trial the court was shown
  footage recorded by the girl that showed the boy, wearing a balaclava,
  assaulting Kohli while the girl laughed. A separate video showed Kohli lying
  motionless on the ground. Other footage recovered by police from the girl’s
  phones included a video of an unknown man being accosted by a group of
  children, one of them calling him a “paki bastard” and hitting him while the
  girl could be heard laughing.
