  Five Palestinian journalists were killed in an Israeli double-tap strike on
  Nasser hospital in southern Gaza on Monday. Israel struck a building at the
  hospital, killing Reuters journalist Hussam al-Masri and others. Then, after
  journalists and rescue workers ran to the scene to help their colleagues, a
  second bomb hit the same spot 15 minutes later. The five journalists join
  their now more than 247 Palestinian colleagues killed in Gaza over the last 22
  months, according to UN statistics. This is the deadliest conflict for
  journalists recorded, killing more journalists than both world wars, the
  Vietnam war, the Yugoslavia wars and the US war in Afghanistan combined. The
  strike on Nasser hospital was captured by a live broadcast and showed unarmed
  medics and journalists holding up their hands to shield themselves moments
  before they were killed. The images of their deaths have provoked outrage
  across the globe and calls to protect Palestinian journalists while they are
  doing their jobs. Here are their stories. Moaz Abu Taha Moaz Abu Taha was a
  27-year-old freelance video journalist whose work had been published by
  Reuters, among other outlets. Journalism had not been Abu Taha’s original
  career, but he felt compelled to begin filming during the Gaza war and soon
  found a passion in photography and video journalism. He could not afford a
  proper camera, so he filmed and photographed with his phone. Over the last
  five months, as Gaza’s humanitarian crisis worsened and hunger began to spread
  throughout the strip, his family said Abu Taha began to work as a
  humanitarian. He focused on specific cases through his video reports, sending
  urgent appeals for sick children and the wounded who needed aid. He had been
  preparing for his engagement when he was killed. “Moaz was the youngest in our
  family, the spoiled one. He loved his work deeply, even though it hadn’t been
  his original career. He was very social and enjoyed making new friends
  everywhere,” said Adly Abu Taha, Moaz’s older brother. Hussam al-Masri Hussam
  al-Masri was a 48-year-old cameraman who worked with Reuters and was the
  father of two sons and two daughters. Al-Masri started his career at a young
  age, helping his father, a journalist, set up his a camera. “He held his first
  camera in 1993 and from that year until now, almost 32 years, there was never
  a day without a camera by his side,” said Ezz al-Din al-Masri, Hussam’s
  father. He was known for his bravery in the field and his commitment to the
  story. His father recounted how he was the last journalist to remain in Nasser
  hospital during Israel’s first invasion of Khan Younis in southern Gaza. “To
  my surprise, he called me, saying he was still broadcasting from inside the
  hospital as the army surrounded them. I fought with him, demanding he leave
  immediately,” Ezz al-Din said. Al-Masri continued his coverage throughout the
  war, despite his wife’s deteriorating health as she struggled to get treatment
  for cancer. In the days before his death, he had been seeking her evacuation
  from Gaza. His friends and fellow journalists have kept up his appeal,
  advocating for her medical evacuation. “Hussam, even though he was nearing 49
  years old, always carried the spirit of a child and an innocent, tender heart.
  I never felt that he could grow old or become an elder. I always treated him
  as my mischievous little boy,” Ezz al-Din said. “But now, after his death, I
  was struck by the fact that he had aged without me realising it.” Ahmed Abu
  Aziz Ahmed Abu Aziz was a 29-year-old freelance journalist who worked for
  various outlets, such as Middle East Eye and Quds Feed. He was described as
  “the journalist who never stopped” by his colleagues at Middle East Eye, and
  was known for his bravery. He travelled across the Gaza Strip to get his
  story, despite the danger it posed. He based himself in Nasser hospital, where
  he covered the impact of Israel’s attacks on people across Gaza. Abu Aziz was
  acutely aware of the danger he was in as a journalist in Gaza. He lost two
  colleagues dear to him early on in the war, driving home how fragile his own
  safety was. Writing a first-person piece for Middle East Eye last year, he
  said his work often made him feel lonely, but he would persist. “It felt like
  I was all alone and the only one left on the ground as so many more of my
  colleagues were being killed,” Abu Aziz wrote. Abu Aziz married in July 2024.
  His wife, Lurzan Abu Aziz, who found his body after the strike, described how
  much he supported and encouraged her to further her education. She was
  studying for her PhD in law, and he a PhD in media. “His dream was for us to
  earn our doctorates together. He always urged me to defend my dissertation no
  matter what, and he encouraged me endlessly. We were supposed to defend our
  theses together this year, but he left and I am alone, grieving his loss,”
  said Lurzan, 28. Mohammad Salama Mohammad Salama was a 24-year old
  photojournalist and cameraman who worked with Al Jazeera. He grew up just east
  of Khan Younis and knew he wanted to be a photojournalist from a young age,
  earning a diploma in photography and shadowing more established journalists.
  He joined Al Jazeera in Feburary 2024. According to the news outlet, he was
  known for his professionalism, dedication, cheerful smile and lighthearted
  spirit. On his birthday in November, Salama become engaged to fellow
  journalist Hala Asfour. He and Asfour were excitedly planning their wedding
  day, to be held after a ceasefire in Gaza. He was the 10th Al Jazeera
  journalist killed in the Gaza war. Mariam Dagga Mariam Abu Dagga was a
  33-year-old photojournalist and mother of a 13-year-old boy, Ghaith. She
  studied journalism at university and began working in 2015, covering major
  events in Gaza such as the 2018 “great march of return”. During the Gaza war,
  she began working for the Associated Press and Independent Arabia, primarily
  covering humanitarian issues. Her photography highlighted the human suffering
  in Gaza, with pictures depicting starving children and people grieving their
  loved ones after Israeli strikes. Her last report for the Associated Press
  covered the plight of malnourished children in Nasser hospital, where she was
  killed on Monday. Fellow journalists said Dagga was always ready to work, even
  in dangerous areas of Gaza, to get the story out to the world. Friends and
  family said she was overwhelmingly kind and an inspiration to those around
  her. “Mariam loved her work, was passionate about it, very fast in covering
  events and never stopped documenting everything. She was very kind and deeply
  cared about her family. She loved everyone and everything,” said Siddiq Abu
  Dagga, Mariam’s brother. Outside work, Dagga was a dedicated mother, speaking
  to her son Ghaith daily. She left behind a letter for him, in which she told
  him how proud she was. “You are my love, my heart, my support, my soul and my
  son whom I am always proud of,” Dagga wrote in a letter to Ghaith before she
  was killed.
