  A rejigged Shergar Cup at Ascot sees an end to the Ladies team that had been
  part of the contest since its inception and a move to what are described as
  more “geographically based” teams representing Asia, Great Britain &amp;
  Ireland, Europe and the Rest of the World. It remains a little contrived at
  times – Robbie Dolan, for instance, last year’s Melbourne Cup-winning jockey,
  moved to Australia nearly a decade ago but is in the GB &amp; Ireland lineup –
  but it is aimed at a slightly different audience to the remainder of Ascot’s
  programme and there are even more unfamiliar faces than usual this time
  around. Five of the 12 riders – Karis Teetan, Delphine Santiago, Katie Davis,
  Suraj Nerradu and Dario Di Tocco – will be riding in Britain for the first
  time, while Ryusei Sakai, Mirai Iwata, Per-Anders Gråberg and Dolan have had
  fewer than two-dozen rides in Britain between them. Perhaps as a result, the
  betting market likes the chances of the “home” side, with GB &amp; Ireland –
  Hollie Doyle, Joanna Mason and Dolan – priced up at about 6-4 for the win.
  There is a wealth of experience in all four teams, however, and the Rest of
  the World – Davis, Teetan and Hugh Bowman – could be a better bet at about 9-4
  to make the most of several decent chances throughout the six-race card. Four
  of Bowman’s five rides, meanwhile, are priced up at 6-1 or shorter, and he is
  a solid 9-2 shot to be the day’s top points scorer. Ascot 1.35 First-time
  cheekpieces drew an abrupt return to form from Venture Capital at Hamilton
  last weekend and, while headgear does not always get the same result second
  time around, anything close to that level would give Teetan a fine chance to
  make his first ride in Britain a winning one. Ascot 2.10 The lightly raced La
  Vita Nova ran well over a mile and five furlongs last time but is likely to
  improve further for this return to two miles and can give Jessica Harrington a
  second success in this contest in three runnings. Haydock 2.25 David O’Meara’s
  new recruit Sunfall needed the run at Epsom in June but showed plenty of
  improvement to win her final start last term and is a decent each-way shot at
  about 10-1. Ascot 2.45 Ian Williams’s Dream Harder was a close second in this
  last year and ran well off Saturday’s mark on his only other start over course
  and distance last month. Haydock 3.00 This return to 10 furlongs should do the
  trick for Haatem, who just lacked the necessary turn of foot in a higher grade
  over a mile at Ascot last time. Ascot 3.20 Prince Of India has improved by the
  race in five outings this season and put up another career best to quicken
  more than three lengths clear of a big field at Newmarket’s July festival last
  time. He has further scope for progress even after an 11lb hike in the
  weights. Newmarket 3.40 The impeccably bred Dance To The Music – a full sister
  to the Breeders’ Cup Mile winner Space Blues – should take this step into
  Group Three company in her stride. Ascot 3.55 William Haggas’s Tenability was
  a decisive winner on his handicap debut over course and distance a fortnight
  ago and will be a winner for Delphine Santiago, France’s leading female rider,
  if anywhere close to that form. Ascot 4.30 Bowman can round off the Shergar
  Cup card with a winner on Urban Lion. Jack Channon’s four-year-old put up a
  career best to run fifth in the Royal Hunt Cup on the straight course here
  last time, and is just 1lb higher.
