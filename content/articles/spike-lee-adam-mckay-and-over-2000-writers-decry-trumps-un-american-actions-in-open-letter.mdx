  More than 2,300 members of the Writers Guild of America, including Spike Lee
  and Adam McKay, have signed an open letter decrying the actions of Donald
  Trump’s administration that represent “an unprecedented, authoritarian
  assault” on free speech. The letter, a combined effort from the WGA East and
  West branches, cites the US president’s “baseless lawsuits” against news
  organizations that have “published stories he does not like and leveraged them
  into payoffs”. It specifically references Paramount’s decision to pay Trump
  $16m to settle a “meritless lawsuit” about a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala
  Harris. The letter notes that Trump “retaliated against publications reporting
  factually on the White House and threatened broadcasters’ licenses”, and has
  repeatedly called for the cancellation of programs that criticize him.
  Additionally, the letter blasts Republicans in Congress who “collaborated”
  with the Trump administration to defund the Corporation for Public
  Broadcasting “in order to silence PBS and NPR”. And it says the FCC, led by
  Trump-appointed chair Brendan Carr, “openly conditioned its approval of the
  Skydance-Paramount merger on assurances that CBS would make ‘significant
  changes’ to the purported ideological viewpoint of its journalism and
  entertainment programming. “These are un-American attempts to restrict the
  kinds of stories and jokes that may be told, to silence criticism and
  dissent,” the letter reads. “We don’t have a king, we have a president. And
  the president doesn’t get to pick what’s on television, in movie theaters, on
  stage, on our bookshelves, or in the news.” Signees include Tony Gilroy, David
  Simon, Mike Schur, Ilana Glazer, Lilly Wachowski, Celine Song, Justin
  Kuritzkes, Desus Nice, Gillian Flynn, John Waters, Liz Meriwether, Kenneth
  Lonergan, Alfonso Cuarón, Shawn Ryan and many other prominent names in film
  and television. The letter, released on Tuesday, calls on elected
  representatives and industry leaders to “resist this overreach”, as well as
  their audiences to “fight for a free and democratic future” and “raise their
  voice”. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting announced last Friday that it
  would shut down after 57 years in operation, following the decision by the
  Republican-controlled House last month to eliminate $1.1bn in CPB funding over
  two years, part of a $9bn reduction to public media and foreign aid programs.
  The corporation, established by Congress in 1967 to ensure educational and
  cultural programming remained accessible to all Americans, distributed more
  than $500m annually to PBS, NPR and 1,500 local stations nationwide. Despite
  the federal grants, stations mostly relied on viewer donations, corporate
  sponsorships and local government funds to stay afloat. The Trump
  administration has also filed a lawsuit against three CPB board members who
  refused to leave their positions after Trump attempted to remove them. “This
  is certainly not the first time that free speech has come under assault in
  this country, but free speech remains our right because generation after
  generation of Americans have dedicated themselves to its protection,” the
  letter concludes. “Now and always, when writers come under attack, our
  collective power as a union allows us to fight back. This period in American
  life will not last forever, and when it’s over the world will remember who had
  the courage to speak out.”
