  Suri 2.0 electric toothbrush review: does this sustainable brush live up to
  the hype?

  When I wrote the Filter’s guide to the best electric toothbrushes, one brand I
  didn’t need a sample from was Suri. I already owned one of its brushes, drawn
  in by its impressive commitment to sustainability in a sector that seemed
  blissfully unbothered by the climate crisis unfolding around us.
  Unfortunately, a few things held it back from taking the top spot, and I’m
  pleased to say that these have mostly been addressed with Suri 2.0. Is it the
  best you can buy? Still not quite, but the gap has significantly closed, and
  there are fewer caveats than ever when giving it a recommendation. If you care
  about sustainability in any way, it’s the best choice. And now there are fewer
  drawbacks to doing the right thing. View at Suri View at Boots *** How I
  tested It doesn’t take a great deal of imagination to figure out how you test
  a toothbrush: brush, brush and brush again. Fortunately, Suri was decent
  enough to give early reviewers a month-long loan, rather than expecting us to
  burn through several tubes of toothpaste in a matter of hours. Equally
  fortunate was the fact that, although I’d donated most of the toothbrushes
  from the group test to Causeway (as explained here), I held on to our current
  favourite, the Spotlight Sonic Pro, as a point of reference. Plus, I already
  had my personal Suri toothbrush, so I could really see where the improvements
  existed. *** Suri 2.0 electric toothbrush: what you need to know View at Suri
  View at Boots My beef with the original Suri toothbrush was essentially
  twofold. First, it didn’t feel as powerful as its rivals, offering 33,000
  brush strokes per minute (BPM), compared with others that went as high as
  62,000. The second was a deeper problem: the spring pin chargers felt
  temperamental, and I personally got through three over the years, deeply
  damaging the sustainability of the product as a whole. This was likely partly
  my fault (from not adequately drying brushes before charging, causing them to
  rust), but I wasn’t the only one with the problem. Suri has addressed both of
  these weaknesses, and some others that hadn’t bothered me. While the first is
  a relatively minor tweak – it still vibrates at 33,000 BPM, but with what I’m
  told is a “more powerful sweeping motion, delivering 25% higher intensity”,
  whatever that means – Suri 2.0 now charges via wireless induction, both on the
  charging stand and in the bundled carry case. No more spring pins to rust or
  snap. Other improvements include the introduction of a pressure sensor, a
  quieter motor (50dB rather than 54), a bundled plant-based brush head cover if
  you want to ditch the travel case, and a travel lock to stop it turning on by
  mistake. As someone whose luggage was once delayed by an electric toothbrush
  prompting a bomb threat, I can’t believe “not being mistaken for a terrorist”
  wasn’t on my wishlist of upgrades, but there we go. Finally, the travel case
  has been upgraded to include a battery. This isn’t for charging the brush, but
  to power a built-in UV-C light to kill bacteria on the go. The UV light was a
  feature on the original brush, too, but it required a USB-C cable to work,
  making it a little-used extra for me. All of this comes in the form of a brush
  that looks virtually indistinguishable from the original, as you’ll see in the
  photos. This feels like an odd choice from a marketing perspective, but it
  does have the advantage of meaning the recyclable plant-based heads are
  interchangeable between Suri 1.0 and 2.0. *** Specifications Type: sonic
  Modes: two (clean and polish) Power: 33,000 BPM Pressure sensor: yes Battery
  life: 1+ month App: no Warranty: one year (extended to two years with
  registration) *** What we love The main thing we love about Suri 2.0 is the
  same thing we loved in the original – the heads are plant based, made from
  cornstarch with castor oil bristles. Suri will recycle these free of charge,
  and provide a self-addressed compostable bag to put your used heads in when
  you’ve collected four. A pack of three costs £14.99, but if you subscribe,
  you’ll get two sent out every six months for £8.98. Cheaper than some of the
  big brands, but more expensive than some third-party heads. As a brush, it’s
  light and easy to use. One press of the button turns it on, with a friendly
  buzz every 30 seconds reminding you to move on to the next quarter of your
  mouth before it shuts itself down after two minutes. There are two modes, one
  gentle and one slightly firmer for a stronger clean. As for those refinements,
  the pressure sensor is a very good addition indeed. If you push too hard, the
  brush will buzz three times and then fall asleep. As soon as you reduce the
  pressure, it’ll stop playing possum, with the timer continuing from where you
  left off. (Note that you can inadvertently turn this off – something that
  wasn’t in the review unit’s manual, causing me to think the device might be
  broken. If your pressure sensor stops working, try pressing and holding the
  power button for five seconds with the brush switched on. When a light
  flashes, turn the brush off and back on, and the pressure sensor should be
  restored.) The new wireless charging system is a huge improvement, too. Just
  pop Suri 2.0 on to the USB-C charging stand or into the case (connected to a
  USB-C cable), and charging starts immediately. Despite losing the unreliable
  spring pins, the new stand is still magnetic, so the brush handle won’t topple
  without a push. Speaking of magnets, one of my favourite design elements of
  the original is back. Each Suri comes with a magnetic wall mount to prevent
  cabinet clutter. No screws required: just remove the tab and stick it to a
  wall or mirror with the pre-applied adhesive. While the brush looks nearly
  identical to the original, the case is far nicer to hold and carry, with
  smoother edges, rather than the sharp angles from the first generation. The
  built-in battery makes it easier to get into the habit of using the UV-C
  light, even if it’s not what I’d call an essential feature. There’s also now a
  plant-based head cover in the box. To prevent accidental activation, a travel
  lock mode has been added, requiring a five-second press to switch on and off.
  This is extremely handy if luggage is at an absolute premium and even the
  slimline case is too bulky, letting you keep your toothbrush head free from
  fluff and other detritus. *** What we don’t love I generally agree with Suri
  that toothbrush features such as Bluetooth and connected apps are pointless
  gimmicks. However, having tested a whole host of sonic toothbrushes, I do
  think that 33,000 BPM is still a touch underpowered, even with the supposed
  higher intensity. To put that into perspective, on the Spotlight Pro, the
  30,000 BPM setting is called “gentle”, and it has four settings that go all
  the way up to 50,000 BPM. Whether it’s down to the speed or less
  planet-friendly bristles, all I can say is that after a cider-heavy night at
  the pub, Spotlight remains notably more effective at eliminating that
  disgusting furry tooth feel than Suri. (This is not one of my regular
  toothbrush tests, but it’s an effective one.) Using both Suri 1.0 and Suri 2.0
  side by side, I couldn’t feel much of a difference, though it’s possible that
  things are still happening on a level only visible to dentists. While the
  travel case was an optional extra before, it now comes with every brush. The
  company says most people wanted the case, so it made sense to include it, but
  it does mean the starting price has risen to compensate, as well as creating
  more e-waste in the long run. While you can still buy a Suri 1.0 brush for
  £75, the starting price for Suri 2.0 with the case has risen to £105. Finally,
  it’s a pity that there’s currently no way to trade in the Suri 1.0 brush for
  its successor. While the company is yet to confirm this, I would be surprised
  if this remained the case forever, given its commitment to minimising e-waste.
  *** Sustainability On that note, Suri’s sustainability credentials remain
  second to none in the world of toothbrushes. Admittedly, this isn’t especially
  high praise, but nonetheless, the company’s visible positive environmental
  choices should be applauded. The plant-based heads can be recycled free of
  charge, as previously mentioned, but that’s really just the tip of the
  iceberg. The body is built from aluminium, the packaging is moulded paper, and
  the product is carbon neutral with offsetting. There are limitations to this.
  There is still a lithium-ion battery on the inside, and some plastic involved,
  as well as a battery in the mandatory travel cases (something Suri previously
  avoided on environmental grounds). But there are practical reasons for these
  ecological compromises, and the company holds itself to account with tracking
  from ClimatePartner and annual sustainability reports. You can read the 2024
  document here, which explains the rationale for limited plastic and
  lithium-ion battery use, among other things. *** Suri 2.0 electric toothbrush:
  should I buy it? All in all, Suri 2.0 is a huge improvement over the original.
  The enhancements are thoughtful and address real gripes I had, while not
  feeling the need to lean into gimmicks such as Bluetooth connectivity. A
  toothbrush I could previously only endorse with a “but” is now an easy
  recommendation, even if it’s still not the most powerful brush around.
  Ironically, I’ll now add a “but” – albeit one I imagine Suri will be happy to
  read. As the company itself points out, every toothbrush that has ever been
  built still exists, whether it’s in a cabinet or a landfill, broken or
  working. With that in mind, if you need an electric toothbrush, then Suri 2.0
  should definitely be on your radar. If you already have one that works well
  enough, make a mental note and consider picking one up when the time comes
  (and when it does, you can find out where to recycle your old electric
  toothbrush locally here). View at Suri View at Boots *** Alan Martin is a

  degree of aptitude that has largely satisfied dentists
