  Leaders from countries united in their opposition to the west will gather in
  Beijing this week in a show of support for China’s president, Xi Jinping, at a
  second world war commemoration parade designed to show off China’s military
  strength and geopolitical might. Described by western analysts as “the axis of
  upheaval”, the military, economic and political collaboration between Russia,
  China, Iran and North Korea has been on display on the battlefield in Ukraine
  and in the Middle East this year. But on Wednesday it will be Beijing that
  takes centre stage as the world’s second-largest economy and rising superpower
  presents itself as an alternative to a western-led global order. The tightly
  choreographed military parade through Beijing’s Tiananmen Square to
  commemorate 80 years since the defeat of Japan in the second world war –
  referred to in China as the war of resistance against Japanese aggression –
  will be attended by 26 heads of state. As well as Russia, North Korea and
  Iran, leaders from Myanmar, Mongolia, Indonesia, Zimbabwe and central Asian
  countries will witness China’s unveiling of a range of combat-ready weaponry.
  The only western leaders on the guest list published by China’s ministry of
  foreign affairs are from Serbia and Slovakia. “Xi Jinping is trying to lay out
  his ambition for the global order,” said Yu Jie, a senior research fellow at
  Chatham House. In Xi’s view, “the world should be multipolar, led by China,
  and joined by many non-western countries,” Yu said. Vladimir Putin, Russia’s
  president, is already in China, having attended the Shanghai Cooperation
  Organisation summit in Tianjin over the weekend. India’s president, Narendra
  Modi, also attended the annual gathering of Eurasian leaders, a sign of
  thawing China-India relations at a time when India has been hit by 50% tariffs
  by the US as a punishment for purchases of Russian oil. As well as showing
  Beijing’s power to gather non-western leaders, the parade – two months after
  US’s own lacklustre military parade held on Donald Trump’s 79th birthday in
  mid-June – provides a direct comparison of US and Chinese military strength
  that Beijing will be comfortable with. Wednesday’s bonanza comes “quite
  shortly after the awful US parade”, said Siemon Wezeman, a senior researcher
  at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. It would “rub it in
  from the Chinese side”, he said, telling the US that “if you do parades, we
  can do it better than anyone else”. In recent months China has been stressing
  the importance of its narrative about the defeat of Japan in the second world
  war, which minimises the role of the west. In May, when Xi visited Moscow for
  Russia’s Victory Day parade, he wrote an article calling for the “correct
  historical perspective” on the war. Xi said China and the Soviet Union were
  the principle theatres of war in Asia and Europe, and that the two countries
  “served as the mainstay of resistance against Japanese militarism and German
  nazism, making pivotal contributions to the victory of the world anti-fascist
  war”. Xi’s article made no mention of the US or European contributions against
  the axis forces in the war. Several recent blockbuster films have also focused
  on China’s experience of the war. Dead to Rights, a film about the Nanjing
  massacre, in which more than 200,000 Chinese people in Nanjing were killed by
  Japanese troops in 1937, took more than 500m yuan (£52m) in the first four
  days of its release in Chinese cinemas in July. Another film, Dongji Rescue,
  tells the story of British prisoners of war who were rescued by Chinese
  fishers from a bombed Japanese cargo liner, while the Chinese government has
  enthusiastically promoted a documentary on the same topic. Yu said the
  legitimacy of the ruling Chinese Communist party was based in part on its
  defeat of Japan 80 years ago, making the historical narratives particularly
  important as Beijing grapples with challenging economic forces and a trade war
  with the US that threatens to undermine the prosperity of ordinary Chinese
  people. Analysts will be closely watching Wednesday’s parade for signs of
  China’s military upgrade, especially anything that could be of particular
  relevance to an assault on Taiwan. “Taiwan is the great unspoken piece of the
  parade,” said Charles Parton, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United
  Services Institute. By projecting military might, he said, Beijing is “sending
  a message to the Taiwanese that resistance is futile”. In May, Chinese
  weaponry appeared to prove itself in a conflict between India and Pakistan,
  when Pakistan used Chinese J10-C jets to shoot down several Indian fighter
  jets. The role of Chinese kit in that conflict, while never officially
  acknowledged by Beijing, was nonetheless highlighted in Chinese media as a
  success story for China’s military capabilities. Even more advanced jets could
  be on display at this week’s parade. Wezeman expects to see so-called
  “fifth-generation” fighter jets such as the J-20, a more advanced and stealthy
  version of the J-10C jets used by Pakistan in May. Crucially, Chinese jets are
  increasingly made with Chinese rather than Russian engines, part of China’s
  military modernisation plan, which stresses the importance of self-reliance.
  “The whole point for China is to be totally independent of anybody else,
  including the Russians,” Wezeman said. That desire for military
  self-sufficiency comes at a time when China’s key ally on the world stage,
  Russia, has been propped up by Chinese economic support and North Korean
  troops during its war in Ukraine. Many analysts believe Beijing is learning
  lessons from that conflict to inform its thinking about a potential conflict
  with Taiwan, a self-governing island that China claims as part of its own
  territory. And while it is difficult to showcase China’s naval progress in a
  parade through the concrete streets of Beijing, there may be certain
  technology, such as supersonic drones and large underwater drones, that could
  show China’s ability to “deter anyone coming to the aid of Taiwan via the
  sea”, Wezeman said.
