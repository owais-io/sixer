  The Inheritance 9pm, Channel 4 Liz Hurley is dead. Well, for the benefit of
  this Traitors-style gameshow she is. Her executor Robert Rinder is overseeing
  her inheritance: he shows clips of Hurley setting daily challenges for the 13
  players battling it out to take their stake. “God, she looks good. If I look
  that good when I’m dead I’ll be absolutely thrilled,” says Pat, who is one to
  watch. The rules are a tad confusing, as is the opening task, but it’s the
  bitching and backstabbing that keep it juicy. And at the Division Ceremony,
  where players must vote for who gets the first chunk of cash, one of them
  causes so much beef that Rinder shouts: “Decorum please! This is the
  Deceased’s house.” It’s camp, devious and heaps of fun. Hollie Richardson
  Parenthood 7.10pm, BBC One We’re in the jungle for the final episode of David
  Attenborough’s ode to the highs and lows of animal parenting. In Jamaica, the
  bromeliad crab lives in a pool of water in the leaf of a jungle floor plant –
  and the tricks she does to raise her babies and harden their shells are
  mindblowing. HR Educating Yorkshire 8pm, Channel 4 It’s more than a decade
  since we first met the staff and pupils of Thornhill Community Academy. There
  have been changes – the inspirational Mr Burton is now the headteacher – and
  there are new challenges, from rising teen anxiety to phone addiction. In this
  opener, 12-year-old Amy adjusts to secondary school with Tourette syndrome.
  Ali Catterall Murder Case: Who Killed Kiesha? 9pm, BBC Two A bleak but
  fascinating new series offering insights into murder cases as the
  investigations play out. It begins in Elgin, north-east Scotland, with the
  killing of Lucretia “Kiesha” Donaghy, a 32-year-old mother who, it turned out,
  was heavily involved in drugs. As the circumstances around her death unfurl,
  it remains meticulous and nonjudgmental. Phil Harrison I Fought the Law 9pm,
  ITV1 Sheridan Smith is on shattering, career-best form in this true-crime
  drama. She plays Ann Ming, who fought for justice after the murder of her
  22-year-old daughter Julie in 1989. When Julie went missing, the police
  promised nothing happened to her in her home – but two months later Ming found
  her body in the bathroom. This failing was just the start of her long journey
  to challenge and change laws. HR King &amp; Conqueror 9.10pm, BBC One A nude
  brawl is the highlight as the backstory of the Battle of Hastings continues,
  with future English king Harold (James Norton) and his future usurper William
  (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) uneasy allies for now. When everyone has calmed down
  and put their scratchy tunics back on, a hostage rescue goes south. Jack Seale
