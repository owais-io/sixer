  as well’

  Forget the numerous occasions when Alex Iwobi has played at the Emirates
  Stadium, Goodison Park and Craven Cottage, or even when he faced Ivory Coast
  in Abidjan in the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations final. The most nervous he has
  been was in Dubai this summer – and not when the dog-loving Fulham midfielder
  headed out for a walk with a lion, which he did in June at a local zoo. It was
  a request from Ramz, the British rapper Iwobi has collaborated with on Hop
  Out, the latest single the Nigeria international has released under his
  pseudonym 17, to join him on stage for a live performance that really struck
  fear into him. “I thought: ‘I’m not sure yet. I’m just not sure yet,’” Iwobi
  says. “But maybe in the near future I might start. I’ve done one live
  performance which felt a bit weird – there was a live band playing the drums
  and I had to literally use it as an instrument, which felt crazy, but I
  enjoyed it. It’s all about timing …” On the evidence of Iwobi’s appearance on
  Uefa’s Champions League Off Pitch show on YouTube that was recorded in April
  when Hop Out was released, he could be on to something. It has been some time
  since footballers releasing singles was a semi-regular occurrence – think
  Glenn Hoddle and Chris Waddle’s duet on Diamond Lights in 1987 or Ian Wright’s
  Do the Right Thing in 1993. But music is in the blood for Iwobi, who started
  out freestyling on the back of the bus on his way to school in Essex,
  progressed to his own studio at home, and whose uncle Jay-Jay Okocha, the
  Bolton and Nigeria legend, released a 1994 single I I Am Am J J. “Looking at
  them, especially Ian Wright, he literally did whatever he wanted,” Iwobi says.
  “He expressed himself, gave 100% in football, but also enjoyed his life. So I
  would also use him as a role model that I still give 100% in my football. But
  I like to have fun on the pitch as well as off the pitch, so that’s my way
  with music, with fashion, with charity stuff. There’s a lot of things I do
  just to … I wouldn’t say get distracted, but just, like, have a moment or just
  to breathe.” Iwobi visited Paris fashion week on his summer holidays and was
  interviewed about his “dog-fit” outfit for walking his two four-year-old
  huskies – “it’s the clothes I wear and I don’t mind them just getting dog
  hair; when I’m with my dogs, literally I turn into a husky all the time” – but
  football remains his main passion. He is speaking a few days after his team,
  also featuring Nottingham Forest’s Callum Hudson-Odoi, were beaten in a
  penalty shootout at his annual Project 17 tournament, which teamed up with the
  African Caribbean Leukaemia Trust (ACLT) to raise money and awareness about
  the severe shortage of donors in the black community. He says he has recovered
  from the disappointment of not making the final and suggests there may have
  been “bit of cheating” from Tyrique Hyde, a former Love Island contestant and
  semi-professional player who is one of Iwobi’s best friends from childhood. “I
  said I was not going to leave my tournament, or leave the stadium, until we
  win,” Iwobi says with a laugh. “Unfortunately I had to get escorted off
  because we did not win. It doesn’t matter – well, it kind of does matter who
  wins, but I’m telling myself it doesn’t! Using my football platform, we also
  brought ACLT to educate and teach people about people that are going through
  blood problems or stem cell problems. You never know who’s going through it so
  it’s just nice to educate people about that as well.” Such is Iwobi’s love for
  the game that during a spell at Everton when he wasn’t playing he donned a
  balaclava to hide his trademark dreadlocks so he could join his friends in a
  five-a-side game in Manchester. “The sort of hair I have, I wouldn’t want it
  to cause another story. It just shows that I really do enjoy playing football,
  especially with my friends. Inside it would be frustrating because everyone
  just wants to play football. When you’re not going to get an opportunity to
  play football I just took it as like: ‘Well, I need to showcase and improve
  and show that I have the ability to be starting, to be playing.’” Iwobi, who
  joined Fulham in September 2023, has just enjoyed his best campaign, as he
  referenced in his only live musical performance with the line: “Comments on
  the tweets saying ‘stay focused’ and ‘stick to the ball’ but look at this
  season, check out the stats, drop a couple tunes and the footie’s on track.”
  He registered nine goals and six assists as the club picked up a record 54
  points, but Marco Silva’s side still finished outside the top 10 and he
  believes a tight-knit group who socialise regularly off the pitch are capable
  of more. “We were so close to achieving a European spot so it’s another
  ambition that we want to fulfil,” he says. As for his own ambitions, Iwobi has
  surpassed Mikel John Obi’s record for Premier League appearances by a Nigerian
  and is hoping to emulate his famous uncle by winning the Afcon, even if the
  new mid-December start for this year’s tournament in Morocco may disrupt
  things at home. “It’s not nice for us [to have to choose],” he says. “But with
  all due respect to Fulham I would like to go to the Afcon.” In another of his
  songs from 2024, What’s Luv?, Iwobi references the number of properties he
  owns as 27, although he says “the portfolio has gone up” thanks to advice from
  Okocha when he broke into Arsenal’s first team as a teenager. “He showed my
  dad the blueprint and ever since I signed my first professional contract,
  almost all my investments go into properties, and my dad manages that for me,”
  he says. “Obviously, football is a short career. I wouldn’t want anyone going
  bankrupt easily or immediately after football. I’m just grateful that I had my
  parents and my uncle to guide me and tell me what’s best for my future as well
  as the life I’m living currently.” With his 30th birthday coming in May, Iwobi
  knows time is of the essence. He remembers what it was like to be the next
  emerging star at Arsenal’s academy with a famous relative and has no regrets
  about the way things have turned out. “I’m so blessed and I’m so happy to be
  in the position I am today,” he says. “I’m obviously grateful to Arsenal
  because they always produce youngsters. I saw Myles Lewis-Skelly and Ethan
  Nwaneri during the off-season and you wouldn’t think that they’re 18 – they’re
  both very mature and carry themselves really well. “No matter what age you
  are, I feel like you have to give 100%. But yeah, I am kicking on. I’m going
  to be 30 next season. So I’m no longer a young kid but hopefully next season
  I’ll make another big statement.”
