  Ethnic minorities and people living in the most deprived areas of England are
  at increased risk of dying due to excess heat, according to research. A study,
  published in BMJ Public Health, is the first of its kind to assess the role of
  socio-environmental factors in the risk of heat-related deaths. Previous
  figures from the University College London (UCL) found almost 600 people were
  expected to die in the heatwave that took place in early June across England,
  with more than 10,000 people having died prematurely in summer heatwaves
  between 2020 and 2024. The report analysed the records of more than 430,000
  patients across England who died between 2016 and 2020, and used relative
  effect modification, or REM, which indicates whether a risk, such as dying due
  to extreme heat, affects some groups more than others. If the REM is 1, it
  means both groups are affected the same while if higher than 1, the group
  being compared is more affected. The study found that black people had a REM
  index of 1.27, and for Asian people it was 1.1, meaning that the effect of
  heat on the risk of dying was 27% higher for black people compared with their
  white counterparts, and 10% higher for people from an Asian background. This
  data suggests heat has a more harmful impact on these groups, possibly due to
  differences in housing, access to cooling, underlying health issues or other
  social and economic factors that all affect health outcomes more generally.
  People in the two most deprived groups across England had a higher risk of a
  heat-related death than their counterparts from the two least deprived groups.
  The study did not find a significant association with the middle groups of
  deprivation. “These findings provide important further evidence on the role of
  climate change in exacerbating existing health inequalities,” said Dr Ross
  Thompson, principal environmental public health scientist at theUKHSA and lead
  author of the study. He added: “Despite increases in heat-related deaths in
  England in recent years, there are still gaps in our knowledge around the risk
  that extreme heat presents to each individual, which hinders targeted
  prevention, and so these findings enhance our understanding. “These findings
  will help the healthcare sector in developing strategies to identify and
  subsequently prioritise patients at the highest risk during heat events, and
  it is vital that we work with our partners to capitalise on these insights to
  protect those in need as extreme heat becomes more common.’’ Figures show
  there were 2,985 excess heat deaths recorded in England after the heatwaves of
  2022, when temperatures reached in excess of 40C. Heat deaths across England
  and Wales are expected to rise in the coming years, and scientists say 30,000
  people a year could die from heat-related causes by the 2070s. Prof Lea
  Berrang Ford, the head of the UKHSA Centre for Climate and Health Security,
  said that it was clear that even with adaptation, heat-related deaths across
  the UK would increase due to climate change and an ageing population. “Of
  particular importance is the distinction identified in this study between
  clinical vulnerability and risk,” she added. “When identifying those most at
  risk, these findings highlight the need to take into account a number of
  contextual factors … which will have important implications for how patients
  are prioritised by clinicians during periods of heat in the future.’’ Matthew
  Bazeley-Bell, the deputy chief executive of the Royal Society for Public
  Health, said: “The climate crisis is a public health crisis and this alarming
  research underpins the need for urgent action. As well as reducing emissions,
  it is vital that policymakers put robust plans in place to protect communities
  that are disproportionately impacted by rising temperatures.”
