  Texas Democrats who left the state say they experienced a bomb threat at their
  Illinois hotel on Wednesday morning amid an ongoing clash with Texas
  Republicans over their effort to block a new congressional map from going into
  place. John Bucy III, a Democrat who represents Austin in the state
  legislature, confirmed the threat on X on Wednesday and said the lawmakers had
  been evacuated. “This is what happens when Republican state leaders publicly
  call for us to be ‘hunted down’. Texas Democrats won’t be intimidated,” he
  said. “We are safe, we are secure, and we are undeterred,” three other members
  of the Texas house Democratic caucus, representatives Gene Wu, Ramón Romero
  and Barbara Gervin-Hawkins, said in a statement. They thanked Illinois’s
  governor, JB Pritzker, and law enforcement officials “for their quick action
  to ensure our safety”. The showdown between Texas Republicans and the
  Democrats who fled the state to block redistricting plans escalated late on
  Tuesday when Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, filed an emergency petition asking
  the state supreme court to remove Wu, the top Democrat in the state house of
  representatives, and declare his seat vacant. “Fearing one of eighteen items
  on the Special Session agenda, Democrat members of the Texas House claim an
  entitlement to abdicate their official duties by refusing to show up for
  work,” lawyers for Abbott’s office wrote in the filing, asking the court to
  rule on his request by Thursday. “These members have abandoned their official
  duties required by the Constitution.” In a statement on Tuesday evening, Wu
  said he would not be intimidated by Abbott’s request. “This office does not
  belong to Greg Abbott, and it does not belong to me. It belongs to the people
  of House District 137, who elected me. I took an oath to the constitution, not
  a politician’s agenda, and I will not be the one to break that oath,” he said
  in a statement. “Let me be unequivocal about my actions and my duty. When a
  governor conspires with a disgraced president to ram through a racist
  gerrymandered map, my constitutional duty is to not be a willing participant.”
  Texas Republicans already hold 25 of Texas’s 38 congressional seats, but
  Abbott agreed to redraw the state’s congressional districts at the request of
  Donald Trump to add more GOP-friendly districts. Republicans hold a narrow
  219-212 advantage in the US House, and the Texas redraw is a brazen effort to
  try to shore up Republicans’ advantage before next year’s midterm elections,
  when Republicans are expected to lose seats. A new map unveiled last week
  would favor Republicans in 30 of 38 seats and weaken the influence of Hispanic
  voters throughout the state. Abbott’s effort is considered a long shot, legal
  experts told the Texas Tribune. In 2021, the Texas supreme court made clear
  that the state constitution both allows state lawmakers to break quorum and
  allows for mechanisms for lawmakers to bring them back. “I am aware of
  absolutely no authority that says breaking quorum is the same as the intent to
  abandon a seat,” Charles “Rocky” Rhodes, a constitutional law expert at the
  University of Missouri law school, told the Tribune. “That would require the
  courts extending the premise to the breaking point. It’s inconsistent with the
  very text of the Texas Constitution.” The Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton,
  a Republican, has said he also plans to take legal action to try to remove the
  lawmakers from office. On Tuesday, the US senator John Cornyn asked the FBI to
  assist in returning the lawmakers to Texas. Trump said on Tuesday that the FBI
  “may have to” get involved. “The governor of Texas is demanding they come
  back,” Trump said. “You can’t just sit it out. You have to go back. You have
  to fight it out. That’s what elections are all about.” The FBI has declined to
  comment. Under rules enacted by the legislature, lawmakers also face a $500
  daily fine for each day they are not present in the capitol. Many of the costs
  so far, including a private charter to Illinois, meals and lodging have been
  picked up by Powered by People, a political group started by the former
  representative Beto O’Rourke, the Texas Tribune reported. Paxton announced on
  Wednesday he was investigating the group’s funding of the effort. Trey
  Martinez Fischer, a Democratic representative of San Antonio in the state
  legislature, said in an interview he was unfazed by the possibility of racking
  up fines. “Not concerned about it at all,” he said. “We’ve had rules set aside
  before, and courts don’t have to interpret the rules the way Republicans want
  them to be interpreted.” “The group is very committed and we recognize that
  this is much bigger, it’s much bigger than anybody’s individual congressional
  district, it’s much bigger than anybody’s individual city, and it’s even
  bigger than the state of Texas,” he added. Other states appear to be following
  Texas’s lead and considering mid-cycle redistricting. Ohio is already set to
  redraw its congressional map this year because of a unique state law, and is
  expected to add more GOP-friendly seats. Republicans in Missouri and Indiana
  are also reportedly considering redrawing maps to add GOP-friendly districts.
  Democratic governors have threatened to redraw the maps in their states, too,
  to offset Republican gains, though they do not have the power to draw as many
  seats as Republicans do. The biggest opportunity for Democrats is in
  California, which has 52 seats in Congress. Governor Gavin Newsom is
  reportedly moving ahead with a referendum this fall to ask to adopt a new map
  that would add Democratic seats and override an independent redistricting
  commission.
