  Attorney general Pam Bondi said today that there have been 1,007 arrests in DC
  since the beginning of the federal law enforcement surge earlier this month.
  She said that on Sunday night alone there were 86 arrests, which included the
  apprehension of a suspected member of the Tren de Aragua gang. Following up
  from my last post, Kilmar Ábrego García’s lawyers have filed a federal lawsuit
  in Maryland. At a press conference outside the Ice facility in Baltimore,
  where Ábrego García was detained, his lawyer said this would be to challenge
  any planned deportation to Uganda. Kilmar Ábrego García, who was wrongly
  deported to El Salvador earlier this year and released just days ago from
  criminal custody in Tennessee, has been taken into Immigration and Customs
  Enforcement (Ice) custody in Baltimore. Ábrego García turned himself into the
  Ice field office today, after the Trump administration vowed to detain him if
  he was released from criminal custody. He’s currently awaiting trial on human
  smuggling charges, and allegations that he is a member of the notorious MS-13
  gang. “To me, happiness is being with my family, and being able to spend
  simple memories with them,” he said to throngs of supporters outside the Ice
  facility earlier. “Those moments will continue to give me hope, to continue in
  this fight.” US immigration officials said they intend to deport Ábrego García
  to Uganda, after he declined an offer to be deported to Costa Rica in exchange
  for remaining in jail and pleading guilty to human smuggling charges,
  according to a Saturday court filing. Ábrego García declined to extend his
  stay in jail and was released on Friday to await trial in Maryland with his
  family. Later that day, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) notified his
  attorneys that he would be deported to Uganda and should report to immigration
  authorities on Monday. Ice also directed Ábrego to report to its Baltimore
  office on Monday, according to records posted online. We can expect to hear
  from the president at least a couple of times today. At 10am ET, he’ll sign
  executive orders in the Oval Office. Then he’ll welcome the president of South
  Korea, Lee Jae Myung, to the White House at noon ET for a bilateral meeting. A
  proposed mega-merger of two of the largest railroad companies in the US will
  hurt jobs, raise costs for consumers and increase the risk of more
  catastrophic train crashes, according to workers and unions. Union Pacific
  proposed a $85bn deal to buy Norfolk Southern last month, which would create
  the first transcontinental railroad network in the US. As executives at Union
  Pacific seek approval from federal regulators the Surface Transportation
  Board, union leaders warn the deal heightens fears around safety – two years
  after the derailment of a Norfolk Southern train in East Palestine, Ohio,
  resulted in the release of plumes of toxic chemicals. “The entirety of the
  workers” is against the merger, claimed John Samuelsen, the president of the
  Transport Workers Union. “We’re hoping that the stakeholders in DC that are
  making determinations are going to listen and understand that when something
  like East Palestine happens, the chances of that happening under a mammothly
  merged new entity become greater and greater,” he said. “Anything that
  empowers the freight rail carriers makes them more profitable and just
  increases the levels of power that they can press is dangerous for workers,
  and actually dangerous for everybody,” Samuelsen added. “They’re already an
  incredibly difficult employer to deal with. And if they’re twice as big,
  they’ll be twice as difficult to deal with, and they’re going to move to
  reduce headcount.” The two firms expect their merger to create an “annualized
  synergy opportunity” worth $2.75bn. Samuelsen cited such savings cannot be
  achieved without reducing the workforce, a longstanding issue in the railroad
  industry. The justice department is alleging in a new court filing that three
  Smartmatic executives who were indicted last year on bribery and
  money-laundering charges transferred money from a 2018 voting machine contract
  with Los Angeles county into slush funds that were originally set up to pay
  bribes to election officials in Venezuela and the Philippines between 2012 and
  2016 to obtain and retain lucrative election contracts. Prosecutors say one of
  the executives transferred an undisclosed amount from the $282m LA county
  contract into the slush funds in 2019 but did not say if anyone actually
  received bribes from the county’s money at that point. The government is
  seeking to prove the funds were part of a long pattern of bribing election
  officials by Smartmatic, the voting machine company, which sued Fox News for
  defamation after the 2020 election. A separate court filing in a lawsuit
  brought by Fox News against LA county to obtain records about Smartmatic’s
  relationship with Dean Logan, LA county’s registrar-recorder and county clerk
  who oversees elections and the Smartmatic contract, Fox News asserts that
  Logan may have received inappropriate gifts from the company in the form of
  business-class travel and upscale restaurant meals. Logan is supposed to
  report vendor gifts above $50 on annual disclosure forms, but records obtained
  by Fox News and included in the court filing show he did not report some gifts
  from Smartmatic. Logan maintains he was not required to report the travel or a
  meal that Fox highlights in its filing. Fox News is seeking the records from
  LA county to support its defense against a defamation suit filed against it by
  Smartmatic in 2021. France summoned the American ambassador Charles Kushner
  after he wrote a letter to president Emmanuel Macron alleging France had
  failed to do enough to stem antisemitic violence, a French foreign ministry
  spokesperson said on Sunday. Kushner, who is Jewish and whose son is married
  to US President Donald Trump’s daughter, published the open letter in the Wall
  Street Journal amid deep divides between France and the US and Israel.
  Kushner’s letter to Macron noted that Monday was “the 81st anniversary of the
  Allied Liberation of Paris, which ended the deportation of Jews from French
  soil” under Nazi German occupation. He wrote: “I write out of deep concern
  over the dramatic rise of antisemitism in France and the lack of sufficient
  action by your government to confront it... “In France, not a day passes
  without Jews assaulted in the street, synagogues or schools defaced, or
  Jewish-owned businesses vandalized,” he added. In the letter, he urged French
  president Emmanuel Macron to more urgently enforce hate-crime laws and tone
  down criticism of Israel, saying French government statements about
  recognising a Palestinian state have fuelled antisemitic incidents in France.
  National guard troops patrolling the streets of Washington DC as part of what
  President Donald Trump said was his crackdown on crime will begin carrying
  weapons on Sunday night, two officials said. The exact number of troops who
  would carry their weapons was fluid, but they will either carry their M17
  pistols or M4 rifles, according to the officials who spoke on condition of
  anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the matter. Hundreds of
  unarmed national guard troops have been in Washington’s streets for the past
  two weeks after Trump declared a crime emergency in the district. Defense
  secretary Pete Hegseth last week authorized the troops to carry weapons. The
  guard’s Joint Task Force-DC said in a written statement on Sunday that its
  personnel would only use force “as a last resort and solely in response to an
  imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm.” South Korean president Lee
  Jae Myung said it was difficult for Seoul to accept a US demand to adopt
  “flexibility” over operations of the U.S. military now stationed in South
  Korea, the Yonhap News Agency reported on Monday. Lee made the comment on a
  flight to Washington where he is scheduled to hold a summit meeting with US
  president Donald Trump on Monday. Lee said he expected to discuss national
  security issues, South Korea’s defence spending and details of a trade
  agreement that was agreed by the countries in late July, Yonhap said.
  President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order on Monday that aims to
  eliminate “cashless bail” for arrested suspects in Washington, DC, Axios
  reported on Monday. Reuters could not immediately verify the report. Rahm
  Emanuel, a Democratic former Illinois congressman, chief of staff to former
  president Barack Obama, and a former mayor of Chicago, also appeared on CNN on
  Sunday urging people to reflect that Trump, in two terms of office, had only
  ever deployed US troops in American cities, never overseas. Emanuel said if he
  was still mayor he would call on the president to act like a partner and,
  although crime was coming down, to “work with us on public safety” to combat
  carjackings, gun crime and gangs and not “come in and act like we can be an
  occupied city”. He added about Trump’s agenda: He gave his speech in Iowa, he
  said ‘I hate’ Democrats, and this may be a reflection of that.” The speech was
  in July, when Trump excoriated Democrats in Congress who refused to vote for
  his One Big Beautiful Bill, the flagship legislation of the second Trump
  administration so far that focuses on tax cuts for the wealthy, massive boosts
  for the anti-immigration agenda and benefits cuts to programs such as
  Medicaid, which provides health insurance for poor Americans. Hakeem Jeffries,
  House minority leader and New York Democratic congressman, said Donald Trump
  has “manufactured a crisis” to justify sending federalized national guard
  troops into Chicago next, over the heads of local leaders. Jeffries, appearing
  on CNN’s State of the Union, accused the US president of “playing games with
  the lives of Americans” with his unprecedented domestic deployment of the
  military, which has escalated to include the arming of troops currently
  patrolling Washington, DC – after sending troops into Los Angeles in June. The
  mayor of Chicago, Brandon Johnson, said any such plan from Trump was
  perpetrating “the most flagrant violation of our constitution in the 21st
  century”. Late on Friday, Pentagon officials confirmed to Fox News that up to
  1,700 men and women of the national guard were poised to mobilize in 19 mostly
  Republican states to support Trump’s anti-immigration crackdown by assisting
  the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (Ice) with “logistical support
  and clerical functions”. Jeffries said he supported a statement issued by the
  Democratic governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker, that Trump was “abusing his
  power” in talking about sending the national guard to Chicago, and distracting
  from the pain he said the president was causing American families. Jeffries
  said in an interview with CNN on Sunday morning: We should continue to support
  local law enforcement and not simply allow Donald Trump to play games with the
  lives of the American people as part of his effort to manufacture a crisis and
  create a distraction because he’s deeply unpopular.” He continued: I strongly
  support the statement that was issued by governor Pritzker making clear that
  there’s no basis, no authority for Donald Trump to potentially try to drop
  federal troops into the city of Chicago.” Illinois senator Tammy Duckworth has
  said in a statement that Trump’s national guard plan for Chicago “distracts
  the military from executing its core mission of keeping Americans safe from
  real adversaries”. In a statement, she said: We know this isn’t about ‘law and
  order’ because Trump is once again refusing to coordinate with state and local
  officials. And if he really cared about ‘health and safety,’ he wouldn’t have
  cut millions of dollars in gun violence prevention funding just weeks ago.
  This is just another attempt to distract the American people from the price
  increases his own policies are causing and the various personal scandals he
  wants to change the subject from. Forcing the military, uninvited, into
  Chicago to intimidate Americans in their own communities does not make our
  nation stronger, it simply distracts the military from executing its core
  mission of keeping Americans safe from real adversaries who wish us harm.
  Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi also responded to reports that president
  Donald Trump is planning to send national guard troops to Chicago. In a
  statement, he accused Trump of mounting an “illegal attempt to militarize
  Chicago” and called the president’s actions a “flagrant abuse of power”. He
  said: President Trump’s illegal attempt to militarize Chicago will do nothing
  but spark chaos and create spectacle. There is no emergency in Illinois that
  warrants federalizing our national guard or deploying active-duty troops into
  our communities – just as there was no justification in Washington or Los
  Angeles. Donald Trump’s flagrant abuses of power must end. Our brave
  servicemen and women are not pawns in his political games. Hello and welcome
  to the US politics live blog. My name is Tom Ambrose and I’ll be bringing you
  the latest news lines over the next few hours. We start with news that Donald
  Trump has been accused of “turning the military on American citizens” after a
  Pentagon official confirmed that planning is under way to send National Guard
  troops to Chicago. Illinois attorney-general Kwame Raoul also told CBS News
  that the president’s actions are both “un-American” and “unwise
  strategically”. Accusing the president of “turning our military on American
  citizens in his ongoing attempts to move our nation toward authoritarianism,”
  he added: His actions are not just un-American. They are unwise strategically.
  Our cities are not made safer by deploying the nation’s service members for
  civilian law enforcement duties when they do not have the appropriate
  training. To be clear: We have made no such request for the type of federal
  intervention we have seen in Los Angeles or Washington DC. There is no
  emergency in the state of Illinois. It comes as lieutenant-governor Juliana
  Stratton accused Trump of pursuing “political theatrics, not safety,” since
  crime in Chicago is already declining and there was no local request for
  troops. In a statement to ABC7 Chicago, she said: Tonight’s reporting from the
  Washington Post that President Trump is preparing to deploy federal troops in
  Chicago proves what we all know: he is willing to go to any lengths possible
  to create chaos if it means more political power-no matter who gets hurt. As
  lieutenant-governor and throughout my career, I’ve fervently fought for the
  reformation of our criminal legal system and under the Pritzker-Stratton
  administration, we’ve made tremendous progress. Crime in Chicago is declining
  and there’s absolutely no rationale for this decision, other than to distract
  from the pain Trump is inflicting on working families with his dangerous
  agenda. Illinois, governor Pritzker and I are here to stand for your rights,
  your freedoms, and will protect you against whatever storms of hate and fear
  come our way. Earlier on Sunday, Hakeem Jeffries, House minority leader and
  New York Democratic congressman, said Donald Trump has “manufactured a crisis”
  to justify sending federalized national guard troops into Chicago next, over
  the heads of local leaders. Read our full report here: In other developments:
  France summoned the American ambassador Charles Kushner after he wrote a
  letter to president Emmanuel Macron alleging France had failed to do enough to
  stem antisemitic violence, a French foreign ministry spokesperson said on
  Sunday. Sergei Lavrov, Moscow’s most senior diplomat, praised efforts by
  Donald Trump to end the war, in an interview on NBC on Sunday, while US
  vice-president JD Vance said Washington would “keep on trying” to broker talks
  in the absence of a deal. In the opening weeks of Donald Trump’s second term,
  Gavin Newsom wagered that peacemaking was best: a tarmac greeting for Air
  Force One, an Oval Office visit and a podcast slot for Maga’s biggest names.
  But then Trump came for California, and its governor dropped the niceties.
  Read the full report here. The president and his allies have been accused of
  executing a “pattern of lawfare” akin to those exerted by authoritarian
  regimes in Hungary and Russia after adopting a new strategy to target
  political opponents: allegations of mortgage fraud. Read the full report here.
