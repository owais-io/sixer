  Facing images of violent white mobs defending racial segregation, the
  condemnation of the world and of its own citizens, Congress in 1965 passed the
  Voting Rights Act, a law meant to end the hypocrisy of a democratic country
  that denied Black people the power of their vote. Sixty years later, race
  remains at the center of American politics. Cases before the US supreme court,
  and a platoon of Texas legislators fleeing the state to prevent redistricting,
  demonstrate how the Voting Rights Act – and its erosion – remains on the
  frontline of the political battlefield. “Democracy is at stake,” said Todd
  Cox, associate director-counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Even as
  voting rights advocates use the act to win additional congressional
  representation in Alabama and press cases in Louisiana and North Carolina, a
  conservative supreme court makes gains precarious, he said. “We wouldn’t be
  under such a threat if we weren’t doing so well in making sure our communities
  were engaged, that they were turning out and that their rights were
  protected,” Cox said. “This is a cyclical part of history, that when we see
  some success in advancing rights, there’s always backlash.” Veterans of the
  struggle for civil rights view passage of the act as a revolutionary,
  historical demarcation point equal to the signing of the Declaration of
  Independence, Confederate general Robert E Lee’s surrender at Appomattox or
  the establishment of women’s suffrage. Enforcement of the Voting Rights Act
  fundamentally rewrote politics in America. “I know I stand on the shoulders of
  folks … who fought and died in some cases,” Cox said. Though constitutional
  amendments passed after the American civil war ended slavery and commanded
  racial equality before the law, American lawmakers regularly found ways to
  keep Black citizens from exercising political power. Literacy tests, poll
  taxes, separate ballot boxes for Black and white voters, white-only primary
  elections, purges of Black voters from the rolls and discriminatory district
  lines rigged elections for white voters in the US’s Jim Crow era. Each time a
  court struck down a state law or demanded the end of a discriminatory
  practice, obstructionist local lawmakers – mostly but not exclusively in
  southern states – would quickly adapt, often enacting new election changes
  without enough time for a court to intervene. Civil rights laws at the time
  held insufficient authority to stop the practice. After years of campaigns for
  voting rights and racial equality across the south, the civil rights struggle
  came to a head in March 1965 in Selma, Alabama. The death of Jimmie Lee
  Jackson, a Baptist deacon and local voting rights activist, at the hands of
  state troopers led 600 people to march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. State
  troopers attacked demonstrators with truncheons and teargas. As networks
  broadcast the assault, the US watched future US representative John Lewis get
  beaten into unconsciousness by white police officers live on national
  television. Support crystalized for civil and voting rights after the events
  of the “Bloody Sunday” broadcast. Congress wrote the Voting Rights Act to
  prevent the case-by-case whack-a-mole games local lawmakers were playing with
  election rules. It forced jurisdictions with a history of discrimination to
  clear elections changes with the Department of Justice before they could go
  into effect. It banned literacy tests to vote and allowed challenges to
  district maps when those maps would not allow proportional representation for
  minority voters. The principles of the Voting Rights Act have shaped the way
  lawmakers from the halls of Congress to a city council hearing room have to
  respond politically to voters of color. Congress has reauthorized the Voting
  Rights Act four times since its enactment, each time under a Republican
  president. But the law’s protections have suffered a death of a thousand cuts.
  In the Shelby County v Holder case of 2013, the US supreme court held that the
  data defining jurisdictions with a history of discrimination was too old to be
  relied upon; Congress must update it for the Voting Rights Act’s pre-clearance
  rules in Section 5 to remain constitutional, the court ruled. Republicans in
  Congress have blocked legislation – the John Lewis voting rights advancement
  act – updating the law, effectively ending pre-clearance. “It was a pretty
  significant blow to the project of ensuring voting free of racial
  discrimination in this country,” said Sophia Lin Lakin, director of the ACLU’s
  voting rights project. “I think it really accelerated in this moment the
  attacks on voting access across the country.” States previously restricted by
  pre-clearance enacted a wave of election legislation following the ruling,
  closing polling places, changing voter registration rules and redrawing
  district lines unhindered. The 5-4 decision in Rucho v Common Cause in 2019
  further eroded the power of the Voting Rights Act, by explicitly permitting
  political gerrymandering, even as racial gerrymandering remained off-limits.
  The mid-decade redistricting in Texas proposed by Donald Trump presents a
  particularly vivid example of the consequences of an end to pre-clearance and
  recent supreme court decisions. Democratic state representatives have fled the
  state to deny Republicans a quorum to pass the redistricting legislation,
  which would likely grant Republicans an additional five congressional seats in
  Texas by concentrating some minority voters into fewer districts while
  diluting clusters of other voters. “Those maps would have had to be reviewed
  by the federal government coming in after the fact to challenge them, and
  winning,” Lakin said. In 2003, the eighth circuit federal appellate court
  further restricted the use of the Voting Rights Act, ruling in Arkansas State
  Conference NAACP v Arkansas Board of Apportionment that private groups do not
  have a right to challenge state election laws under the act; only the
  Department of Justice can bring a voting rights case to court. A second eighth
  circuit decision extended the ban on private voting rights suits from
  redistricting cases to suits challenging restrictions on voter assistance. Of
  the 180 or so successful claims brought under the Voting Rights Act, only 15
  have been brought by the Department of Justice, said Jacqueline De León,
  senior staff attorney with the Native American Rights Fund. The Department of
  Justice’s voting rights division used to have about 30 staff attorneys; under
  the Trump administration, it has lost all but two or three, she said. “We know
  the Department of Justice is not going to be in the business of enforcing
  voting rights,” De León said. “Right now, we don’t know if there will be a
  future where a Voting Rights Act is available to our country. This is really a
  moment for concern and reflection on this anniversary.” Lakin said she expects
  the eighth circuit ruling to be appealed to the supreme court. Meanwhile, a
  case in Louisiana that has reached the US supreme court threatens the last leg
  standing of the Voting Rights Act. On Friday, the court signaled that it will
  consider the constitutionality of section 2, asking for supplemental briefs in
  Louisiana v Callais. The case, to be heard later this year, asks whether the
  state’s creation of a majority-minority congressional district violates the
  14th or 15th amendment to the constitution. “I think this is, unfortunately,
  another opportunity for the court to continue to attack this pillar of our
  democracy, the Voting Rights Act,” Lakin said. In Callais, a group of
  “non-African-American voters” filed suit against the state of Louisiana,
  arguing that lawmakers acting on the order of the federal court drew a
  congressional district map that unconstitutionally considered race. The Equal
  Protection Clause of the US constitution and the 15th amendment’s guarantee
  that the right to vote cannot be denied because of race says that lawmakers
  cannot consider race predominantly over other factors when redistricting
  without a compelling reason. But section 2 of the Voting Rights Act requires
  lawmakers to consider race when it is necessary to ensure that the voting
  power of racial minorities has fair representation. The cases are an effort to
  create conflict between the Voting Rights Act and the constitution as a
  rationale for a conservative court to chip away, Lakin said. “Congress can
  enact laws to ensure the 14th and 15th amendments are given life,” she said.
  “I think that there’s an attempt to create tensions around this and say that
  there’s a disconnect with the Voting Rights Act. But as the supreme court has
  stated … the act is a properly, constitutionally authorized use of Congress’s
  powers.” Such a finding would turn hard-fought civil rights law on its head.
  It would establish a legal basis for white voters to challenge laws meant to
  protect minority voters from discrimination. “I would say it’s a perversion of
  what the Department of Justice has symbolized, specifically what its historic
  role, its purpose was meant to be,” Lakin said.
