  Set a target income Retiring in your 50s can seem like a pipe dream,
  particularly with the high costs of living and restrictions on accessing your
  pension until the age of 55 – rising to 57 in 2028. However, with careful
  planning and consistent saving, you can increase your chances of an early
  escape from working life. Start by working out how much income you will need
  in retirement. According to the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association, a
  single person now needs about £31,700 a year for a moderate lifestyle, while a
  couple needs £43,900 between them. These figures cover the cost of running a
  car, an annual overseas holiday and an off-peak long weekend break in the UK.
  Early retirees often spend more at first, packing in travel and hobbies while
  they are still active. One way to guarantee an income for a set period, or the
  rest of your life, is to buy something called an annuity. In exchange for a
  lump sum, you get regular payments, but how big these are depend on your
  health and your age, and if you buy one in your 50s, you will get less each
  year than if you wait until you are older. According to the financial firm
  Hargreaves Lansdown, someone earning £26,000 a year and contributing the
  standard 8% (5% from their earnings and 3% from their employer) to their
  pension from age 22 to 68 could build a fund of about £235,000. This could
  generate an annuity income of about £16,000 a year in retirement on top of the
  state pension (now £11,973 a year). If they stopped making contributions and
  bought an annuity at age 57, their fund might be closer to £143,000 – reducing
  their annual income to about £8,000 before the state pension. To retire at 57
  with a £16,000 income from a personal pension, they would probably need to
  contribute about 13% of their salary throughout their working life on top of
  the 3% employer contribution. “Even for some very high earners, the pressures
  of mortgages, raising a family, supporting elderly parents and an elevated
  cost of living can make a retirement in the early 50s a tough ask,” says David
  Little of the wealth manager Evelyn Partners. “With improved life
  expectancies, that might mean a 40-year retirement or more.” Start early and
  maximise tax breaks Building up pension savings early is vital if you want to
  finish work in your 50s. Under current rules, you can pay up to £60,000 a year
  into a pension, or up to 100% of your annual earnings, whichever is lower, and
  still benefit from tax relief. Even modest contributions snowball because
  every year’s gains are reinvested and start earning their own returns. Check
  whether your employer will match any extra contributions you make or let you
  use salary sacrifice, as both will boost your pension savings. Salary
  sacrifice boosts your pension because it reduces your gross salary, meaning
  you and your employer pay less in national insurance. Some employers pass
  their NI saving on to your pension, too, which can increase the total
  contribution. One partner can boost another’s future income by making
  contributions for them. Up to £3,600 a year can go into a pension for a
  non‑earner and still receive basic‑rate relief. (You do not have to be
  married/civil partnered). Because pensions are locked until at least age 55
  (rising to 57 in 2028), many people planning for early retirement also save
  into an Isa. You can put up to £20,000 a year into an Isa and benefit from
  tax-free growth and withdrawals, giving you a ready‑made bridge between
  quitting work and tapping your pension. Invest for growth, then protect
  Historically, stocks and shares have typically produced much higher returns
  than cash. “£1,000 invested in a global tracker fund 20 years ago would have
  grown to more than £5,000 today,” says Dan Coatsworth, an investment analyst
  at the investment platform AJ Bell. “The same amount in a cash Isa earning an
  average rate over the same time period would be worth about £1,500. “Global
  equity funds are popular with people in their 20s, 30s and 40s as they offer
  broad exposure. You can choose low-cost passive options like the Fidelity
  Index World fund, which tracks more than 1,300 companies across developed
  markets, including big names like Microsoft and Apple.” The £5,000 figure
  mentioned is based on investments in a stocks and shares Isa, but the
  principle of long-term compounding applies to Isa and pension investments. As
  you approach your target retirement age, Coatsworth recommends shifting
  strategy. “Once you’re within five years of retiring, think about how your
  pension will be structured. That could mean moving some of your pot into
  income-generating assets and potentially dialling down risk.” Some pension
  providers will automatically gradually reduce investment risk as you get
  nearer to retirement through something known as “lifestyling”, but it is worth
  checking where your investments are held. Lifestyling usually starts anything
  between five and 15 years before retirement. However, your pension provider
  may need to be told your intended retirement age if it is earlier than the
  default age. Cut costs and clear debts Reducing your expenses can make
  retiring in your 50s more achievable. High-interest debts, particularly credit
  cards and loans, should be paid off as soon as possible. Downsizing your home
  or relocating somewhere cheaper could free up equity and reduce your
  outgoings, and reviewing bills, insurance and subscriptions could also reveal
  some easy savings. Even small reductions in spending can reduce the sum you
  need to live on each year, helping your money last longer. Bridge the gap to
  state pension Retiring early means covering the years before the state pension
  kicks in. Helen Morrissey, the head of retirement analysis at Hargreaves
  Lansdown, says: “The state pension age is on the way up – [it’s] currently 66
  and due to hit 68 by the mid-2040s. Given the important role that the state
  pension plays in people’s retirement income, much more will need to be saved
  in the pension to bridge this gap.” The state pension is now just under
  £12,000 a year. “If it increased by 2.5% per year over a period of 10 years,
  then that would be about £150,000 extra that would need to be saved into a
  pension to cover that period if you were looking to retire early,” Morrissey
  says. You need 35 qualifying years of NI contributions to receive the full
  amount. Beware that gaps in your NI record to raise children or care for
  others can mean you fall short of the 35 years needed for the full state
  pension. This is a particular risk if you are aiming to retire early, as you
  will have fewer working years to make up the shortfall. You may be able to
  receive NI credits if you are caring for another, or in receipt of child
  benefit, or have been unemployed but looking for work. You can also pay
  voluntary NI contributions to fill gaps in your record. You can take up to 25%
  of your pension pot tax-free from age 55 (rising to 57 from 2028). This is
  often taken as a lump sum, but you can also take it in stages. The rest of
  your pension withdrawals will be taxed as income. Some early retirees buy
  fixed-term annuities with part of their pension to provide a guaranteed income
  until state pension age – rates are more attractive now than in recent years.
  Little warns against cashing in the 25% tax-free pension lump sum too early:
  “Taking it all at once in your 50s can deplete your pot quickly. Taking it in
  tranches makes it last longer.” Track and adjust Retirement plans don’t need
  to be set in stone. Stock markets fluctuate, living costs rise, and plans
  change. Reviewing your savings annually can help you spot problems early and
  make adjustments. Most pension providers offer online tools to let you test
  different scenarios. If you are falling behind, you may need to boost your
  contributions. If your investments perform better than expected, you might
  gain extra flexibility. “Early retirement is achievable, but it takes
  discipline and regular checks,” Morrissey says. “It’s worth setting a reminder
  to review your plans each year.” • This article was amended on 6 August 2025
