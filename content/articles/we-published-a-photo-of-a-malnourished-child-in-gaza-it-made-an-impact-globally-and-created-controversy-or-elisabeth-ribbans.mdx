  Between April and mid-July this year, more than 20,000 children in Gaza were
  admitted to hospital for treatment for acute malnutrition, 3,000 of whom were
  severely malnourished, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase
  Classification (IPC), a global initiative whose members include UN agencies
  such as the World Health Organization, World Food Programme and Unicef, as
  well as NGOs and research institutes. Over this period, and in the weeks
  since, the Guardian has published many images of hungry children, among them
  at least 20 shown in an emaciated condition. (It does so working to an
  editorial code that gives special protection to children, publishing on
  matters that may intrude into their welfare only when there is a strong public
  interest to do so.) But one photograph, which appeared on the homepage of the
  website on 23 July and on the front of the print edition the next day,
  prompted fierce controversy. The picture was powerful and pitiful: an
  18-month-old boy, Muhammad Zakariya Ayyoub al-Matouq, cradled in his mother’s
  arms; his bare back skeletal, his diaper a black plastic bag. This image, as
  well as others of the same child, were published widely by major news
  organisations. Freelance journalist and antisemitism campaigner David Collier
  accused the media that published the photos of doing so “to push a lie about
  famine”. He said a May 2025 medical report he had seen stated the boy had
  cerebral palsy. This was not the face of famine, Collier wrote in his blogpost
  on 27 July, but a child who “has needed specialist medical supplements since
  birth”. “What we can see from [unpublished] pictures is that both Mohammed’s
  mother and his older brother look healthy and are not suffering from any type
  of starvation that would be necessary to cause the thinness suffered by
  Mohammed,” he said. A reader who contacted me directly decried the image as “a
  fake”. Another said: “Definitely this poor child is suffering. But is it from
  starvation? It is from several medical conditions Muhammad was born with … You
  need to make sure your readers know the real ‘WHY’ behind this picture.” It
  seems unarguable that readers want to know the “real why” in whatever they are
  seeing. But its availability is not always as straightforward. War is chaotic
  and individual circumstances invariably complex. Foreign journalists are
  barred by Israel from entering Gaza, meaning they rely on local journalists,
  including photographers, working in difficult and dangerous conditions. The
  Guardian receives about 1,000 images a day from Gaza, provided by or via major
  picture agencies. The pictures of Muhammad came through Getty Images from the
  Turkish state-run Anadolu agency. In the wake of the accusations, Anadolu
  published an article that quoted Suzan Marouf, a doctor treating the boy at
  the Patient’s Friends hospital in Gaza City, saying doctors there had
  diagnosed him the previous month with “moderate malnutrition on top of
  congenital health problems, including brain complications and muscle atrophy”
  but that these issues were “not significantly affecting his weight” until the
  hospital’s nutritional supplements became depleted. Since then, he had
  developed severe malnutrition, she said. Separately, Anadolu distributed an
  image from Muhammad’s bedside showing a picture of him before he lost weight.
  Muhammad’s mother said he dropped from 9kg to 6kg in recent weeks. The
  Guardian was not aware until after it published the images (the first was in a
  picture gallery on 22 July) that the boy had other medical conditions. Should
  they have sought to ask? The relevant editors I have spoken to here each told
  me that seeing his wasted frame did not stand out as unusual; they had
  “consistently seen similar pictures for months”. In a hunger crisis, they
  point out, experts attest to how children and those with existing medical
  conditions are among those most at risk. According to the WHO, of the 63
  malnutrition‑related deaths recorded in July, 24 were children under five.
  That is 38%, when under-fives make up around 15% of the total population of
  Gaza. Children with developmental disorders can have special nutritional
  needs. One paediatrician, speaking to me for background, said diagnosis was
  frequently challenging in settings without access to early identification
  tools, which meant that with cerebral palsy, for example, definitive diagnosis
  is sometimes not made until the age of two. Editors say reference to
  Muhammad’s existing health issues would have been included if known – and the
  picture captions have now been amended – but they consider that the images
  still stand, saying a sick child who is starving is “not any less deserving of
  our attention than any other child”, as previous reporting featuring
  malnourished infants with underlying feeding conditions has demonstrated. In
  other words, the face of malnourishment is most often the face of the already
  vulnerable. For my part, I agree that the missing information was relevant to
  a fuller reading of the picture. But the Guardian has not, as some claim,
  relied on this image alone to illustrate reporting of what the IPC days later
  termed (though Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, rejects the
  assessment) an “unfolding” famine. And if we recognise that it is the most
  vulnerable who are most impacted by lack of food and health services,
  publication of this picture of real suffering did not, in my view, act to
  deceive. Elisabeth Ribbans is the Guardian’s global readers’ editor
