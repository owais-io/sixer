  Another Lions tour added to the annals, and everyone is more or less happy.
  The British &amp; Irish Lions take a series win, just about, and Australia
  have a pivotal moment at the end of the second Test to whinge about, or
  console themselves over, depending on your viewpoint. Certainly, these days,
  it is difficult to know what disciplinary outcome may pertain to each incident
  in the cut and thrust of elite rugby. Most people with eyes can appreciate
  there was no head contact when Jac Morgan tried to clear out the jackling
  Carlo Tizzano in the buildup to Hugo Keenan’s winning try, but there is no
  doubt, either, that Tizzano was in an exposed position, just as that
  particular split-second represented an impossible situation for Morgan. Had he
  gone any lower he would have made contact with the head, higher and he would
  have missed the clearout altogether. Beyond the noise of yet more grownups who
  should know better carrying on as if they were the first to find themselves on
  the wrong side of a contentious decision, a wider question has bubbled up
  again – and this one has been brewing for a while – about whether the time has
  come to put the jackal to sleep once and for all. Indeed, lexically, World
  Rugby has tried to do just that. In the latest amendment to its law book, all
  mentions of “the jackal” and its variations have been replaced by “the
  stealer”. This may be because of the conjugation of a verb that did not exist
  in the English language until rugby came along. Before it removed them
  altogether, World Rugby chose to spell the inflections of the verb “to jackal”
  so that they matched those of the verb “to tackle”, rather than “to pedal”,
  causing mayhem in editorial offices across the world. Some people consider the
  jackal sacrosanct, the ultimate embodiment of the contest for the ball that
  distinguishes rugby union from various other collision sports. Once upon a
  time it tended to be the preserve of the openside flanker. Nowadays, with
  hundreds of tackles a match, a team need multiple players proficient at the
  skill. But once upon a time really is not very long ago in this case. The
  jackal is a phenomenon of the professional era. A few years ago, in the
  Welford Road press room, discussing it were a couple of former internationals;
  one who retired just before the game turned pro, the other whose career
  started just after. When they were asked who first became renowned for their
  jackling, there was a moment’s silence. The international from the amateur era
  looked blank. The one from the pro era, after some thought, offered Josh
  Kronfeld, the All Blacks openside of the late 1990s. Which feels about right.
  This is not to say no one ever went for the ball after a tackle in the amateur
  era, but there was not a name for the practice, and the window of opportunity
  was brief, with “hands off” called the moment an opponent bound on to form a
  ruck. There are two main arguments for querying the jackal’s pervasiveness in
  the modern game. The first is a safety matter, although why we should pick on
  that area above any other is not obvious. Rugby is a dangerous game. The
  sooner the authorities recognise that by reserving their sanctions for
  deliberate acts of recklessness, the fewer impossible disciplinary quandaries
  there will be to resolve. Jacklers, though, do place themselves in vulnerable
  positions – and it is not just the head that is exposed. A team doctor in the
  Premiership mused about 15 years ago that there was a new injury in rugby,
  which had been seen previously only in surfing, when the surfer is hit by a
  wave while crouched on the board. That injury, a serious one, is called an
  avulsion, when the hamstring is torn from the bone, and it is the jackler who
  suffers it if hit hard enough by a clearout. So much for the safety. There is
  also a compelling argument on rugby grounds. The great poser these days is how
  to get players back into the ruck. The game has never been more vibrant and
  entertaining on the field, but insofar as there are bad games, which of course
  there are, they usually play out to the relentless thud of hit-up after hit-up
  as defenders fan across the field. The main reason they can do that is that
  they need to send only one player in at every tackle to jackal, who in turn
  invites two or three of the attacking side to clear out, thus tilting the
  balance beyond the ruck in favour of the defending side. Make it illegal to
  use hands after the tackle, so the theory goes, and the ruck will become the
  primary contest for the ball at each tackle. A turnover can be won when the
  first defender steps over the ball. Thus teams will need to resource the rucks
  if they want to maintain possession or win it back. That should create space
  elsewhere. It sounds reasonable, but there will almost certainly be downsides,
  as there always are in rugby’s eternal quest for the perfect set of laws. A
  personal view is that far too much latitude has been extended to the jackler,
  who is now granted rights to handle the ball, if the first one there, long
  after any ruck has formed. At the very least, rugby might consider a return to
  what used to be lore: that all hands come off the moment a ruck is formed. A
  happy side-effect might be to calm the ardour of the clearout, where players
  almost panic at the sight of a jackler and charge in desperation. Any
  situation that permits a defender to put the attacking side in an impossible
  situation needs reviewing. The jackler is a prime example. Coming to a law
  trial near you … This is an extract taken from our weekly rugby union email,
