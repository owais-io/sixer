  A Democratic candidate has defeated an extremist Republican in a state senate
  election in Iowa, claiming that voters are “waking up” to realise Donald
  Trump’s party “sold the working class a bill of goods”. Catelin Drey flipped
  Iowa state senate district 1, beating Christopher Prosch in a special election
  held on Tuesday to fill the seat of the late senator Rocky De Witt. Prosch had
  aligned himself with Trump’s Maga movement, floating conspiracy theories about
  the 2020 presidential election and climate crisis. He also compared abortion
  access to the Holocaust. But Drey, a 37-year-old marketing executive, won with
  55% of the vote to Prosch’s 44%, representing a swing of more than 20 points
  from Trump’s performance last year in the district, which covers most of Sioux
  City. Describing herself as “thrilled” with the result, Drey said on
  Wednesday: “We delivered a message that resonates with voters. People right
  now are frustrated with the way things are going. Iowa’s economy is last in
  the country, we’re last for maternal healthcare providers per capita, and
  people are ready for a change.” Asked whether the outcome delivered a verdict
  on Trump’s Maga agenda, Drey said: “It speaks to the level of authenticity and
  transparency that’s necessary to win in this environment. People want to make
  a connection with their candidate and they want to believe that person is
  going to be looking out for their best interests.” The founder of the
  grassroots organisation Moms for Iowa added: “Folks are waking up to the fact
  that Republicans in Iowa and, frankly, across the country have sold the
  working class a bill of goods and they are ready for policies that actually
  work for them.” Despite Democrats’ struggles in Washington, this is the second
  Iowa state senate district they have flipped this year, after a January
  victory in a district Trump won by more than 20 percentage points. Democrats
  have consistently overperformed in special legislative elections across the
  country, including winning another Trump-friendly seat in the state senate in
  Pennsylvania in March. The trend potentially spells trouble for Trump before
  next year’s midterm elections for the US House of Representatives and Senate.
  An Economist/YouGov poll last week found that 40% of Americans approve of
  Trump’s handling of the presidency while 56% disapprove. Republicans have also
  faced rowdy town halls in their congressional districts. Heather Williams,
  president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said: “As Trump
  and Republicans wreck the economy and erode democracy with power-grabbing
  schemes, Democrats’ special election wins should send a flashing warning to
  the GOP: voters are rejecting the failing Maga agenda and leaving Republican
  candidates in the dust.” Drey had raised $165,385 and spent $75,066 on the
  campaign as of 21 August, the Des Moines Register newspaper reported, while
  Prosch raised $20,020 and spent $18,425 as of the same date. Both candidates
  received substantial in-kind support from their state parties. The Democratic
  National Committee (DNC) also deployed 30,000 volunteers for “get out the
  vote” efforts and hosted text and phone banks in conjunction with the Iowa
  Democratic party for Drey’s campaign. Ken Martin, chair of the DNC, said:
  “Iowans are seeing Republicans for who they are: self-serving liars who will
  throw their constituents under the bus to rubber-stamp Donald Trump’s
  disastrous agenda – and they’re ready for change. “They are putting
  Republicans on notice and making it crystal clear: any Republican pushing
  Trump’s unpopular, extreme agenda has no place governing on behalf of Iowa
  families.” Republicans poured scorn on the intervention by national Democrats
  as a sign of desperation. Jeff Kaufmann, chair of the Iowa Republican party,
  said: “National Democrats were so desperate for a win that they activated
  30,000 volunteers and a flood of national money to win a state senate special
  election by a few hundred votes. “If the Democrats think things are suddenly
  so great again for them in Iowa, they will bring back the caucuses.” Drey’s
  victory breaks a Republican supermajority in the Iowa state senate for the
  first time since the 2022 election. The new chamber margin is 33 Republicans
  to 17 Democrats. This gives Democrats the ability to block governor Kim
  Reynolds’s picks for state agencies, boards and commissions. Matt McDermott, a
  Democratic pollster and strategist, on the X social media platform posted: “If
  you’re wondering why Republicans are rigging maps, this is what they’re afraid
  of.”
