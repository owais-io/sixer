  When The Salt Path came out in 2018, it was a publishing phenomenon, going on
  to sell more than 2m copies globally. As even those who haven’t read it are
  likely to know by now, the book charted Raynor Winn and her husband Moth’s
  emotionally and physically transformative long-distance walk along the South
  West Coast Path in the wake of utter disaster: a financial collapse that cost
  them their home, and Moth’s diagnosis with an incurable neurological disorder.
  Winn followed it with two further books in a similar vein, The Wild Silence
  and Landlines, also bestsellers. Earlier this year came a film of The Salt
  Path, starring Gillian Anderson and Jason Isaacs. That original book by a
  first-time writer had become what writers, editors and booksellers all dream
  of: a bestselling, spin-off generating brand. But it wasn’t the first nature
  memoir to top the charts, by any means. In 2012, Wild by Cheryl Strayed
  described the 26-year‑old’s hike across the west coast of America in the wake
  of her mother’s death and the end of her marriage, and after soaring up the
  book charts it was made into a film starring Reese Witherspoon two years
  later. That same year, H Is for Hawk by Helen Macdonald was a surprise
  bestseller, telling the story of a year spent training a Eurasian goshawk as a
  journey through grief after the death of their father. In 2016, Amy Liptrot’s
  The Outrun saw her return to the sheep farm on Orkney where she’d grown up in
  order to recover from addiction through contact with nature; it was also
  recently filmed, with Saoirse Ronan in the lead role. Meanwhile, in last
  year’s bestselling Raising Hare, foreign policy adviser Chloe Dalton describes
  moving to the countryside, rescuing a leveret and rediscovering her
  relationship with the land. There is clearly a thriving market for this
  particular blend of nature writing, personal memoir and a specific form of
  self-help in which the embattled individual – or in the case of The Salt Path,
  a couple – finds solace, sustenance and even redemption by withdrawing from
  everyday society and launching themselves into the great outdoors. It’s not
  difficult to see why such narratives are attractive, but what do they tell us
  about ourselves and our relationship with the natural world? And what damage
  might The Salt Path affair do to this genre of nature memoir? It is not given
  to any of us to know the definitive truth, of course, and any memoir is
  subject to the pitfalls of perception, memory and judgment. But the two most
  significant accusations levelled against Winn are that, some time before the
  journey described in The Salt Path, she embezzled large amounts of money from
  an employer, and that she exaggerated the severity of Moth’s illness. She
  denies both, and is particularly insistent that neither she nor Moth intended
  to suggest that their travels were a miracle cure for his condition. However,
  the book tapped into a strong desire among readers for narratives of healing
  through nature. For Melissa Harrison, author of novels for adults and children
  as well as nonfiction ranging from memoir to nature guides, these kinds of
  nature books represent “proxies through which we can relate to the natural
  world in a way that most of us don’t have the time or the inclination to in
  real life”. Reading about someone else’s deep dive into forest, field or water
  furnishes us with the sense that we’re participating in an environment that,
  for much of the time, is at arm’s length. “That mediated experience is
  reassuring: it tells us that we still have the capacity for a certain depth
  and intensity of feeling, and that one day, when whatever the circumstances
  are that prevent us from doing so currently are over, we can pick up our
  relationship with nature where we left off – most likely in adolescence – and
  find meaning and belonging again.” Harrison adds a cautionary note, however,
  about the “healing narrative” or “quest structure” in such nature writing.
  Having admired Dalton’s work, for example, she observes that “for every
  Raising Hare there are five books in which it seems the author simply wanted
  to write a nature memoir and cast about for some kind of experience to
  structure the book. Readers deserve better – and publishers should do better
  than this.” Harrison is not the only writer I speak with to bring up the issue
  of publishers’ responsibilities. Indeed, the post-Salt Path conversation has
  included criticism of Winn’s publisher, Penguin Random House, and its
  perceived failure to carry out due diligence on her manuscript. While the more
  trenchant comments seem tinged with a post-hoc lack of realism – can editors
  really be expected to play detective and, for example, interview a prospective
  writer’s wider circle to establish veracity? – there is more justification for
  the feeling that the industry will publish relentlessly into an area it deems
  likely to achieve mainstream success, even if that means green-lighting
  repetitive or imitative work. Mo Hafeez, a commissioning editor at Faber,
  agrees that there has been a certain homogenisation of writing about the
  natural world, especially in work coming through after the pandemic. “People
  were engaging in nature more, purely by virtue of being in lockdown and not
  being able to see each other,” he says. “There was this surge of nature
  writing that came through, and often, instead of it being career-long
  naturalists or academics or people who had been writing in this area for a
  long time, it was everyday people’s engagements with nature. Which in a way
  was very lovely, and it democratised the genre quite a lot, but it got to a
  point where it was quite a saturated area of the market.” The challenge, he
  thinks, is to resist expectations of what a nature memoir should look like,
  and remain open to work from unexpected angles – he has recently been reading
  the poet Jason Allen-Paisant’s nonfiction exploration of rural landscapes in
  the UK and in Jamaica, for example. There are numerous writers who sit within
  the genre but are writing according to their own imperative, rather than a
  notional market: an incomplete list might include Noreen Masud, whose book A
  Flat Place observes trauma through the lens of different landscapes; poet
  Polly Atkin, author of a biography of Dorothy Wordsworth and a memoir, Some of
  Us Just Fall, in which she contemplates her own chronic illness; and Natasha
  Carthew, writer and founder of the Nature Writing prize for working class
  writers. It’s likely that none of these writers will compete with Raynor Winn
  in terms of sales. Bestselling books become so because idea, execution,
  publishing knowhow and the zeitgeist combine in precisely the right way and at
  the right moment to capture readers’ imagination. One can certainly see what
  made The Salt Path successful: a compelling piece of storytelling in its own
  right, it tapped into deeply held anxieties about the sudden loss of home and
  health, and countered them with a portrait of resilience against the odds. It
  is the accusation that Winn misrepresented her husband’s illness, and that the
  books allowed, if not encouraged, readers to believe that the couple’s walks
  and wild camping had led to an improvement in his condition, that has provoked
  the most vehement negative reactions. That strength of feeling is telling.
  “What I’m interested in,” says Rachel Hewitt, author of In Her Nature, “is
  that use of physical illness as morally unambiguous. It’s a shield, isn’t it?”
  She argues that the full story – whatever the truth of it – would have made a
  more interesting narrative. But it is easier to market the more crafted tale,
  which is “actually very simple: a walk from illness to recovery, a walk from
  homelessness to finding a new concept of home. You know, all those things are
  quite simple, and there’s clearly something within publishing houses or within
  readers that really responds to that.” Writing about illness is an intensely
  personal and immensely delicate undertaking, both in terms of the challenges
  it holds for the writer and the impact it can have on the reader. Susan Sontag
  famously outlined the dangers in Illness As Metaphor; Hilary Mantel counselled
  that “illness strips you back to an authentic self, but not one you need to
  meet. Too much is claimed for authenticity. Painfully we learn to live in the
  world, and to be false.” Hewitt suggests that there might be an inherent
  smoothing over of complication in the stories that publishers find it easiest
  to present to the public; and that a woman in her 50s, with a necessarily
  involved past, constitutes a challenge to that narrative simplicity. Hewitt is
  currently contemplating writing about grief from the perspective of her own
  widowhood, and has become increasingly aware of “these sort of neat, linear
  narratives that have become such a staple of nature writing, but don’t
  represent human experience”. In terms of writing about the natural world,
  author Nic Wilson believes this approach is symptomatic of “much wider
  societal attitudes towards nature and the transactional way that quite a lot
  of our society goes into the relationship with nature”. Her debut book, Land
  Beneath the Waves, has been published recently, and she explains how she
  initially resisted the idea of writing about her family history and her own
  chronic illness in relation to nature, deterred partly by an awareness of the
  limitations of memory, and partly by a belief that her story was too
  “ordinary”. “I think perhaps even some of the books that are billed as healing
  narratives are more complex than that. It’s just that this becomes sort of a
  trope that’s talked about. And I think it simplifies things, and sets a
  precedent that other books are expected to follow, which is not helpful to
  [having] a diversity of voices within memoir, particularly within nature
  memoir, because the greater diversity of voices we have, the more people’s
  individual experiences are validated and spoken to.” Through all these
  conversations, there’s a clear insistence that we need to see “nature” not as
  a resource, but as a multifaceted and interdependent series of contexts and
  environments. “Let’s be honest, it’s full of death, isn’t it?” says James
  Rebanks, whose accounts of his life as a farmer in The Shepherd’s Life and
  English Pastoral have recently been joined by The Place of Tides, a memoir
  about time spent with a wild duck farmer on a Norwegian island. As he points
  out, nature is “full of death and disease and failure and decline. It isn’t
  all butterflies, sunshine and healing, is it? In my last book, I was trying to
  make it more complicated: nature can be lonely. Nature can be too quiet. It
  can be too isolated. It can lead to you not being in the right place. And
  nature itself is broken, so it can make you depressed. It’s falling apart
  around you. I find it more interesting when it’s less about personal
  redemption and more of a mirror on the big things that I care about: the
  politics, the economics, what’s actually really happening in the world.”
  Rebanks, who loves Tolstoy and the American writer Wendell Berry and thinks of
  himself in the tradition of the agrarian radical, is an engaging presence,
  both off and on the page and, like the best writers on nature, is alive to the
  frequent contradictions in portraying it in either fiction or nonfiction.
  Helen Macdonald, too, whose prize-winning H Is for Hawk has been made into a
  film with Claire Foy and Brendan Gleeson, is acutely aware of the expectations
  we bring to the genre. “Nature is considered to be the one place free of human
  artifice, the place where deep universal truths can be uncovered that are not
  to do with us,” Macdonald says, “which, of course, is bullshit. That’s not the
  case. We put all our deepest human meanings into nature. We sort of force them
  in there, and then we use them to prove the veracity of our own concepts back
  at us, which is what nature writing does all the time.” Macdonald highlights a
  literary-critical tradition that is useful in understanding both the success
  of The Salt Path and the reaction to its alleged departures from fact. “Tramp”
  or “vagabonding” literature, which flourished in the 19th and 20th centuries,
  was by its nature highly individualistic and accepted to contain fabrications;
  it encompassed writing by those who were marginalised from society, and those,
  like George Orwell, who put themselves in that position in order to analyse
  societal structures. It’s a world away from contemporary memoir and the idea
  that nature can be instrumental in making us feel better. So is the genre now
  facing an existential crisis? Is there still room in the market for stories of
  journeys into the wilderness, complete with a healing narrative? For Jessica
  Lee, author of books for both adults and children and the founder of The
  Willowherb Review, which ran from 2018 to 2022 and aimed to provide a platform
  for writers of colour, the issues raised by The Salt Path furore present us
  with an opportunity to explore innovative ways of writing about nature. “If
  we’re talking about wanting to write about the natural world,” Lee says, “we
  can’t get rid of ourselves. We can’t write ourselves out of the narratives;
  we’re the ones telling the story. But what we can do is allow the world to
  inform the shape that we take.” That means resisting the idea of linear
  progression, or redemptive arcs, in favour of the cyclical and the messy. “The
  personal, with us at the centre, can be the door that opens the story. But
  then we really need to be very proactively seeking to undo that the second
  we’ve opened that door.” Meanwhile, the fallout from such microscopic
  attention to a huge bestseller offers us a window into the realities of nature
  publishing, where experimentation and complexity persist, but often do so
  without the resources afforded to more commercially appealing narratives. A
  salutary lesson, perhaps, but not one likely to deter the most adventurous and
  committed of those attempting to survey our threatened environment and to
  capture both its wonders and its fragility.
