  Something is rotten in tertiary education – not in the classrooms, but in the
  boardroom. Every glossy announcement masks the same reality: cuts, closures
  and a hollowing-out of the very institutions meant to serve the public good. I
  am a lecturer in education at University of Technology Sydney. My colleagues
  are outstanding, the students dedicated. And yet, despite newly developed and
  accredited teacher education courses and courses that have been delivered for
  35 years, our education programs are being “temporarily” suspended from autumn
  2026. While the announcement avoids the term “closure”, in this sector that is
  what’s likely to follow. This means the suspension of secondary and primary
  education degrees, alongside teaching English to speakers of other languages
  (Tesol) and applied linguistics – the very programs designed to address
  teacher shortages. And the justification? “Low student enrolments.” But these
  numbers come from auditors looking at spreadsheets, not classrooms. Education
  and commerce students, for example, are coded separately, even though in
  practice they sit within the education or business cohorts for all of their
  subjects. On paper the numbers might look thin; in reality, the rooms are
  full. Once these programs are paused, they are almost impossible to bring
  back. Student intake stops, momentum is lost, expertise disperses,
  partnerships dissolve and whole areas of knowledge are lost. The consequences
  will be far-reaching. Schools and communities will be left without a trusted
  partner; aspiring teachers will lose access to high-quality, practice-based
  training. Nationally, we will lose vital research capacity – especially in the
  areas related to vulnerable and multilingual communities. What has taken
  decades to build can be dismantled in a single budget cycle. UTS is a public
  university with a legislated obligation to “meet the needs of the community”.
  Its charter clearly states that the university exists for the public good. If
  preparing teachers for New South Wales schools during an ongoing teacher
  shortage isn’t a public good, what is? The NSW Department of Education reports
  a daily shortfall of nearly one-third of its casual teachers. Primary and
  secondary teachers are the second and third-largest occupations in shortage,
  according to the Australian government’s 2024 Occupational Shortage List. And
  yet, one of Australia’s leading universities is suspending the very programs
  that feed this workforce. The burden of proof should be on the university to
  explain how cutting teacher education fulfils its mission. Beyond the numbers,
  it is worth remembering who these programs serve. For years UTS has been a
  pipeline for teachers equipped to work with refugee-background students, newly
  arrived migrants, learners from linguistically diverse communities, and
  “second chance” adult learners with basic literacy and numeracy needs. As an
  English as an additional language or dialect (EAL/D) teacher and researcher, I
  have seen the difference that skilled, culturally responsive teachers can
  make. Suspending these courses doesn’t just threaten teacher numbers – it
  threatens the right of some of our most vulnerable students to an equitable
  education. The social justice implications are profound. UTS is one of the
  preferred providers of EAL/D-trained and adult literacy and numeracy teachers
  to government and other schools, and adult education centres. In a state as
  multicultural as NSW – with more than a third of students from language
  backgrounds other than English – gutting these subjects is indefensible.
  Closing down or “suspending” programs like these doesn’t just affect UTS. It
  removes national capacity in areas core to access, equity and social cohesion,
  as well as economic productivity. Once more it seems that teacher education is
  in the firing line. If the public is constantly told, “Teachers can’t read and
  write! They only need an Atar of 50!”, why would anyone sign up? If
  hardworking and dedicated teachers are told they’re “only in it for the
  holidays”, why would they stay? And now, a university is seemingly dismantling
  the courses that educate the teachers themselves. This is more than
  shortsighted – it’s self-sabotage. When we hollow out the teaching profession,
  we undermine our children’s future. When we strip away specialist programs
  like Tesol, adult literacy and numeracy and EAL/D, we deepen inequality,
  leaving the most vulnerable students further behind. Something is rotten in
  the state of Denmark. And the question is: what happens to the state of NSW
  when there are no teachers left to hold it up? Dr Isobel Crealy is an academic
  and educator with expertise in EAL/D and refugee education
