bodyText: "That wicket makes India strongish favourites to square the series, but England’s merry band of run-chasers won’t go quietly. One way or another, tomorrow should be the last day of this terrific series. Goodnight. Fantastic bowling from Mohammed Siraj! He changed the field as if for the short ball, only to hit Crawley with a perfect yorker that sneaked under the bat and rammed into the stumps. A fantastic way to end another compelling day. It was the fifth ball of the over This morning, during a charming interview on Sky Sports, Siraj said that when he goes to bed at night he needs to know he has given absolutely everything on the field. If not, he struggles to settle. He’ll sleep like a baby tonight. Crawley backs away just as Siraj is about to bowl the second ball of the over. Unlike at Lord’s he isn’t timewasting as this was always going to be the final over. Shubman Gill folds his arms and smiles; Crawley also breaks into a little grin. Oh to be a fly on the wall when the two teams get together tomorrow night for an end-of-series chat. Oh my, Crawley isn’t smiling now! Mohammed Siraj has bowled him with a spectacular yorker! Time for one more over before the close. Mohammed Siraj will bowl it. 13th over: England 50-0 (Crawley 14, Duckett 34) Crawley ends his mini drought with a tight single to mid-on off Krishna. Duckett then punches a couple to bring up another fifty partnership with his cricketing BFF, this one in exactly 13 overs. Apparently we now live in a world in which two England openers add 50 in 13 overs in a Test match and it feels on the slow side. 12th over: England 44-0 (Crawley 13, Duckett 30) Siraj jumps wide on the crease to zip a cracking delivery past Crawley’s attempted drive. India would love to take one of their beloved opponents with them before the close. Crawley started fluently and scored 13 from his first 11 balls; since then he’s made 0 from 18. “Robinho!” hics Simon McMahon, who really does sound like if he’s high on sausages and cider. “Is there anything better on a Saturday evening than getting a lift home from the ever understanding and loving Mrs McMahon after being at a sausage and cider festival all day and arriving home in time to see the end of the days play and then switch to Celebrity Pointless watching Crawley and Duckett make early inroads into what not long ago would have seemed an impossible target, but that now wouldn’t be all that remarkable were it to be reached. That’s Bazball’s greatest achievement, right? Backing yourself, trusting in the process. Talent plus self belief. How else would I have been able to neck 18 pints and eat three foot longs today?” 11th over: England 43-0 (Crawley 13, Duckett 29) That was a really nasty blow. And though Duckett is okay to continue, he’s clearly still in a bit of pain. 10.4 overs: England 42-0 (Crawley 13, Duckett 28) Krishna changes ends to replace Deep. He beats Duckett twice, then pins him on the bottom hand with a brutish delivery. Duckett is in a fair bit of pain and the physio has come onto the field. 10th over: England 42-0 (Crawley 13, Duckett 28) Duckett gets four more with an edge over gully off Siraj. It hasn’t been easy – the odd ball is moving sharply off the seam – but England have started well. 9th over: England 37-0 (Crawley 13, Duckett 23) Duckett times Deep pleasantly down the ground for a couple, then scrunches wide of the sprawling Jadeja at mid-on for three. So far so good for England’s openers, even if they haven’t recaptured the audacity of their first-innings partnership. England need another 337 to win. 8th over: England 32-0 (Crawley 13, Duckett 18) With just over 30 minutes remaining, Mohammed Siraj is let off the leash by Shubman Gill. His third delivery is too full and punched emphatically through mid-off for four by Duckett. After 16 consecutive dot balls, England need that hit of oxygen. “I was surprised to read your statement on Tongue currently being the top wicket-taker despite only playing three Tests,” writes Tom Van der Gucht. “He seems to fall in that bracket of bowlers (along with the likes of Steven Finn and Devon Malcolm) who take wickets but are mistrustedby captains and selectors due to their economy rates. “Do you think England have not got the balance between dependability and maverick wicket-takers quite right this series? I know they were aiming for the knock-out blow in the last Test, hence sticking with Archer and Carse despite them being knackered. But the golden balance seems to be a steady Woakes / Potts seamer, pacier and more metronomic Atkinson/Carse and tearaway stumps rattler Archer/Wood/Tongue and Stokes... Or maybe I’m going too much down a Michael Vaughan Cricket Manager 2007 PC rabbit hole (and if I was, I’d end up doing something ludicrous like drop Stokes for Curran in order to get some left arm angles) in order to cheat the algorithm.” It’s possibly more nuanced than that, and I’m not sure I’d agree with the categorisation of Archer and Carse. I suppose one of the few downsides of having a big group of quick bowlers is that you have to decide which three to pick for each game based on fitness, morale, the pitch, the opposition and so on. For 15 years, with a handful of exceptions, England only had to choose one quick bowler for each match. 7th over: England 27-0 (Crawley 13, Duckett 13) The pressure is building. Crawley, hit on the thigh by the previous delivery, tries to smear Deep into outer space and is beaten. Two maidens in a row – that can’t have happened too often against Crawley and Duckett – and just one run from the last 17 deliveries. 6th over: England 27-0 (Crawley 13, Duckett 13) Duckett feels for a good delivery from Krishna and is beaten. At least he didn’t leave it. Krishna completes a rare maiden, just the third of the match for India. Duckett usually starts the English car but tonight he’s straining for rhythm. His 13 has come from 24 balls, Crawley’s from 13. 5th over: England 27-0 (Crawley 13, Duckett 13) A few words between Duckett and Deep enliven an otherwise quiet over. No contact to report, yet. “I agree with you, I think (with hindsight) I would have rested Jofra for Old Trafford and played him here,” says John Swan. “I guess the difficulty is, who would have the self-discipline to have Jofra available and not pick him...? Maybe there was an element too of expecting a more traditional Old Trafford wicket? Even though it’s well-known to be a slab, at least this year...” Yeah, in this case it’s hindsight-driven but I do think England are slightly inflexible, perhaps even macho, with their use of fast bowlers. Gus Atkinson, for example, was way down on speed by the end of the New Zealand tour after playing 11 Tests out of a possible 12 in less than six months. 4th over: England 24-0 (Crawley 13, Duckett 10) Duckett tries to pull Krishna, doesn’t make proper contact and clonks the ball over mid-off for a single. Crawley, whose game looks in much better order than it did at the start of the series, times a lovely cut past backward point for four. 3rd over: England 16-0 (Crawley 7, Duckett 8) Crawley is beaten, chasing a very wide short ball from Deep. England desperately need these two to set the tone as they did in the big run-chase at Headingley. And when England chased 378 against India at Edgbaston in 2022, Crawley and Alex Lees added 107 in 21.4 overs. (Lees also produced one of the great sledging retorts.) After carving his first boundary behind square, Crawley is hit on the right bicep by an exceedingly nasty lifter. It hit the fleshy part of the arm so he’s fine to continue once the pain subsides. India are very chirpy in the field, as they should be in this position. Deep’s second over ends with a grotesque seaming lifter, barely legal. It beats Duckett all ends up and almost clears the leaping Jurel. Good luck playing that. Duckett, a man who would probably retain a resting heart rate if you dropped a marmot in his bath, looks at the pitch and smiles wryly. 2nd over: England 10-0 (Crawley 2, Duckett 8) India have a cover sweeper in place for Crawley, so a trademark thump yields only one run rather than four. There’s nobody on the boundary when Duckett helps himself to successive boundaries from errant deliveries on leg stump. The first was tucked off the hip, the second chipped over backward square leg. 1st over: England 1-0 (Crawley 1, Duckett 0) Eeeyyyyyyyyah, almost the perfect start for India. Deep’s fifth ball seamed and bounced sharply to hit Duckett on the top of the pad; they went up for LBW before rightly concluding it would have bounced over the top. Prasidh Krishna will share the new ball, a change of policy from the first innings. Mohammed Siraj has been at his best with an ageing ball. There are still 25 overs remaining tonight, not that we’ll get them in. Akash Deep is about to open the bowling. England need 374 to win. They chased 371 in the first Test at Headingley. We all love it when the end of a story references the beginning, don’t we? Josh Tongue picks up a five-for in the usual style – caught midwicket off a skier. Washington launched him miles in the air and was well caught by Crawley, who almost collided with Pope as he took the catch. That’s a terrific effort from Tongue, who has bowled 30 overs in the second innings alone. He finishes with 5 for 125 in the innings, 8 for 182 in the match and 19 in the series – that’s the most on either side, though Siraj should overtake him in the next 24 hours. Washington smacked a brutal 53 from 46 balls and added 39 for the last wicket with Prasidh Krishna, who faced precisely two deliveries. 87th over: India 396-9 (Washington 53, Krishna 0) Even the mishits are working out for Washington. He clonks the last ball from Atkinson over mid-on for … a single, which allows him to keep the strike. “Is there anything better,” begins Simon McMahon, who sounds like he’s high on sausages and cider, on a Saturday teatime in early August than being at a sausage and cider festival watching the last recognised batsman throwing the bat with No. 11 at the other end as the bowling side get more and more frustrated and the crowd lap it up?” 86.5 overs: India 395-9 (Washington 52, Krishna 0) Washington slashes and pulls Atkinson for successive boundaries – then launches a monstrous six over midwicket to reach his fifty from only 39 balls. At one stage he had 17 from 27! This is a thrilling assault from a player of enormous substance. That six has done such damage to the ball that it will need to be changed. 86th over: India 379-9 (Washington 36, Krishna 0) The value of that bye becomes apparent when Washington hooks Tongue for two sixes in three balls. Big ones, too, almost a mirror image of Ian Botham at Old Trafford in 1981. Tongue bowls successive wides before Washington takes a single off the fifth legitimate delivery of the over. Krishna has one ball to survive… and Tongue spears it down the leg side. India lead by 356. 85th over: India 364-9 (Washington 23, Krishna 0) Washington goes into T20 mode, lifting a full ball from Atkinson for a big six over midwicket. Atkinson tries to hide the last delivery to keep Washington down at that end; Krishna thwarts him by stealing a bye to the keeper. 84th over: India 357-9 (Washington 17, Krishna 0) Ah, that’s why Siraj was keen to go upstairs – he got a very thin inside edge. Sudharsan and Jurel wasted reviews earlier in the innings. “Cheers for pointing me towards that OBO of England v India in the T20 World Cup years ago,” writes John Davis. “I always enjoy reading those with the benefits of hindsight. Particularly enjoyed this little gem later on: ‘Anderson - a good bowler, maybe very good, but still laughably overrated in this country’.” For some reason, I had a wart on my fanny over Anderson throughout the summer of 2009. I don’t mind getting it wrong – everyone does – but I wish I could take back some of the sneering, arrogant language. Josh Tongue picks up his seventh wicket of a match in which he has blown hot and cold. He gets Siraj out of there straight away with a full, quick delivery that hits the pad in front of middle and leg. Siraj considers a review, then realises India don’t have any left. I think it would have hit leg stump. Ravindra Jadeja had never previously scored 300 runs in a Test series. He finishes this one with 516 runs at an average of 86 – including 315 at 315 in the second innings. Ravindra Jadeja has been dismissed in the second innings of a Test match. He snicked Tongue to second slip, where Brook took the catch to his right. There was no celebration from Brook, only a look of slight disgust because of the earlier dropped catches. 83rd over: India 356-7 (Jadeja 53, Washington 16) A huge inducker from Atkinson beats Jadeja all ends up and hits him on the pad, leading to a strangled shout for LBW from England. It did so much that it would have missed leg stump. Probably too high as well. “Have to say this is the best pitch this series,” writes Arul Kanhere. “A shame those who could have most exploited it are not playing in this match. Nevertheless, the cricket has been good, aside from the drops. Not that I am complaining.” Yep, it’s a much better contest. At the start of the Bazball era England were praised for concentrating only on the game in front of them, a welcome change from the confused selection policy in the previous winter’s Ashes. But if they had their time again, I wonder whether they would have rested Jofra Archer or Brydon Carse in the fourth Test to save them for this game. 82nd over: India 354-7 (Jadeja 52, Washington 15) Jadeja cuts Josh Tongue for four to reach another half-century, his fifth of the series in addition to the century at Old Trafford. Champions turn failure into fuel. Jadeja has responded to a lean winter, when he averaged 26 across eight Tests, by having easily the best series of his career with the bat/ 81st over: India 345-7 (Jadeja 47, Washington 11) England are such a bunch of weirdos – no that was a compliment – that they’ll still fancy their chances of winning this game. Gus Atkinson takes the new ball and steels himself for what he hopes will be one last spell. Washington takes a tight single to mid-on, one of three from the over. 80th over: India 342-7 (Jadeja 45, Washington 10) Washington whips Root stylishly through mid-on for four. And with that, it’s time for the second new ball. India lead by 319. 79th over: India 338-7 (Jadeja 45, Washington 6) Jadeja nails a pull for four off Overton. He’s averaging 102 in this series and has scored 307 runs without being dismissed in the second innings of the five Tests. If/when Jadeja gets out, his second innings average across the whole series will be second only to Sunil Gavaskar against West Indies on the famous 1970-71 tour. 67*, 64*, 117*, 220 = 468 runs at an average of 468 “You wrote ‘This is a nice opportunity for Jurel to remind the selectors of his batting ability’” says Nick Lezard. “Could you say something complimentary about Washington, please?” I’ve heard good things about Pearl Street Warehouse!! (Been a long series, sorry.) 78th over: India 330-7 (Jadeja 38, Washington 5) Two left-handers at the crease now, so Root replaces Bethell at the Match Up End. Three singles from a forgettable over. Let’s just move on, CAN WE? 77th over: India 327-7 (Jadeja 36, Washington 4) Jadeja and Washington, the Old Trafford centurions, are reunited. Washington gets going with a pair of twos. “I’ve basically loved Jadeja since just after the second world war,” writes Robert Wilson. “I’ve regularly pelted you OBO-jockeys with my early-adopter passion. Yes, I know Ashwin was the connoisseur’s choice but I am not a sophisticated guy. Jadeja is basically left-arm orthodox’s Darren Gough, all arse and attitude. “He’s also the worst kind of all-rounder for opposition teams. The all-rounder who is not even meant to be an all-rounder. That is simply an insult. Particularly to specialist batsmen on a bad run, scraping and sweating over a two-hour twenty something and who then have to watch Ravindra come out and smack it all over like a cut-price Errol Flynn. l “A Jadeja 30 or 40 is a wonderfully bargain-bin affair, all own-brand and bruised fruit. All his shots look like he downloaded them illegally but there’s nothing he can’t play. And when he tweaks one during his 25-second overs, he can make any one look like a tit. I’d loved to be sledged by him. I bet he’s good at that too.” Sixteen years ago – sixteen years ago – Jadeja played a match-losing innings against England at Lord’s in the T20 World Cup. Fair to say it reinforced his clarity: since then he’s been on the winning side in 218 international matches. And quite a few of those victories have come off his own bat/ball/arse/attitude. Jamie Overton picks up his second wicket. Jurel plays down the wrong line of a fuller delivery that straightens to hit the flap of the back pad. That’s plumb. For some reason Jurel decides to spaff India’s last review before walking off. 76th over: India 323-6 (Jadeja 35, Jurel 34) This is a nice opportunity for Jurel to remind the selectors of his batting ability. Were it not for him, it would have been 2-2 going into the final Test between these sides 18 months ago. When Jadeja’s time comes, a middle order of Gill, Pant, Washington and Jurel would score oodles of runs. And you’d have a world-class wicketkeeper. And Rishabh Pant could play as a specialist batter. It might free him up, as he can be a bit self-conscious with the bat. “As every day, week, month and year passes, Don Bradman becomes greater and greater,” writes Will Ellen. 2No one can touch him. No one can even get close to touching him. This has been a batting series that dreams are made of for Shubman Gill, but he has still ‘only’ averaged 75.4, 25 odd less than the Don. (The fact he averages 99.94, rather than say 100.3, reminds us he’s human) “In terms of the greatest, Messi has Pele and Maradona, Djokovic has Federer and Nadal, O’Sullivan has Hendry and Davis, F1 probably has a few people who are good at driving round in circles (I wouldn’t know, I don’t watch it). But in batting terms Bradman is just peerless.” Yep, it’s almost mind-blowing how superior he is to everybody else who has played the game apart from Andy Ganteaume. His average is almost akin to a three-minute mile. 75th over: India 320-6 (Jadeja 34, Jurel 33) Red Bloke puts a beige jumper over his shirt, prompting applause from the crowd and a thumbs-up from Jadeja. Overton, summoning energy from goodness knows where, rams a terrific short ball that Jadeja top-edges straight over the keeper’s head for four. India lead by 297. 74th over: India 312-6 (Jadeja 27, Jurel 32) A man in a suit asks Red Bloke to move; Red Bloke declines his kind offer. Then a chap wearing a bib emblazoned with the word MANAGER wanders over, leading to this bit of commentary on Sky. Nasser Hussain “The manager’s gonna have a word.” Stuart Broad (deadpan) “How d’you know he’s the manager?” 73rd over: India 310-6 (Jadeja 27, Jurel 30) Jamie Overton returns after tea, confirmation that Atkinson and Tongue will take the second new ball. The poor buggers have already bowled 49 overs between them! A quiet over from Overton is dominated by a fella behind the sightscreen whose red polo shirt is putting the Indian players off. Said fella is oblivious to this and looks very confused when he seems himself on the big screen for the second time in 30 seconds. “A lot of tennis matches have been decided by “unforced errors “ and crucial double faults,” says Krishnamoorthy V. “Dropped catches amount to the same in a cricket match. England may still chase what needs to be chased but I get a feeling that they might end up regretting these drops and fall just short.” Agree. I find it weird and dispiriting that every England defeat needs to be framed as some kind of moral failing, or decisive evidence in the case of R v. Bazball. At times in this game England’s bowling and catching has been poor; India have been the better team. I’m not sure there’s any more to it than that. 72nd over: India 307-6 (Jadeja 27, Jurel 27) India’s batters have a dilemma: do they try to pummel England’s part-time spinner(s) until the second new ball available or accumulate sensibly and build India’s lead? For now it’s the latter – three singles from Bethell’s over. “Shelve the cricket for a moment,” writes Brian Rafferty. “I’d just like to say a huge thank you to you and the team, and to fellow OBO contributors, for the warmth and companionship when it is needed most. “The tributes to Thorpey were lovely to read yesterday but the quality of writing in here is something else. You are all watching and responding at the same time and still manage to express yourselves in such beautiful ways. Thank you. There – that’s my hug back to you all.” Thanks Brian. It’s Daniel Harris and the readers who deserve credit for yesterday’s coverage; I’ll be sure to pass it on. The evening session The players are back on the field. This will be an extended session to make up some of the time lost on the first day. Jacob Bethell is going to start. 71st over: India 304-6 (Jadeja 26, Jurel 25) Jurel finishes the session with a flourish, driving and pulling Tongue for back-to-back boundaries. A thick edge for two brings up India’s 300, then he clips the last ball of the session for three more. India go to tea with a lead of 281. They definitely have enough this time. They might have enough. They probably have enough. Is this even enough? Enough already! 70th over: India 291-6 (Jadeja 26, Jurel 12) Joe Root starts a new spell with a pie that is gobbled up by Jurel. We shouldn’t forget that he’s a proper player who averages almost 50 in first-class cricket. Talking of proper players, Jadeja has yet to be dismissed in the second innings in this series: he’s 288 not out. Spinners are supposed to come to the party in the second innings but that’s ridiculous. 69th over: India 284-6 (Jadeja 25, Jurel 6) “Even though Overton’s likelihood for the next series is declining, there seems to be a drift against Sam Cook too,” says John Starbuck. “Atkinson and Tongue are obviously going to travel but there doesn’t seem to be any favourites from the County Championship. All the established one are crocked or, at least, liable to be crocked again.” One problem, made by Yas on the excellent Wisden podcast, is that county pitches have been very flat all summer so most of the England contenders are averaging in the 30s. Fitness permitting, England will take Atkinson, Archer, Wood, Tongue, Carse and maybe one more. Contenders include Sam Cook, Matt Potts, Olly Stone, Dillon Pennington, maybe even Eddie Jack. My hunch is it’ll be Stone or Pennington. 68th over: India 282-6 (Jadeja 24, Jurel 5) Jurel flashes Atkinson through the vacant backward point region for his first boundary. Later in the over an LBW shout is caught in the throat because of an inside edge. India lead by 259. “I find myself feeling pretty ambivalent about the result of this Test,” says Joshua Keeling. “Yes, I’d like England to win, but we can’t lose the series, and to be honest, it’s been such a close series between two evenly matched teams, a draw feels about right.” It’ll be a bit of a travesty if India lose 2-1, never mind 3-1. Mind you, this time last week I thought England were going to win 4-1; in that context a draw would be a little deflating. I guess the historical merit of a 2-2 draw – and I’m not saying this is right – will be determined by what happens in the Ashes. 67th over: India 278-6 (Jadeja 24, Jurel 1) Replays show Jadeja thought he was out too; he only reviewed the LBW after encouragement from Dhruv Jurel. Yep, the decision is overturned. He was hit on the toe by a sizzling inswinging yorker from Tongue, a delivery so persuasive that Kumar Dharmasena raised the finger even though it hit Jadeja outside the line. The decision was overturned on review but now Jadeja needs treatment after having his toe crushed by that delivery from Tongue. I think he’ll be okay to continue. Jadeja is out LBW to Tongue – but he’s reviewed and I think it’ll be overturned. 66th over: India 276-6 (Jadeja 22, Jurel 1) The wicket leads to a change of plan from England: Root off, Atkinson on. The new batter Jurel is sent back by Jadeja and has to scramble to make his ground; Duckett’s throw missed the stumps but I’m pretty sure he would have been safe. “This is gone innit?” says Phil Harrison. “Shame. Still, silver linings yet? We now know that Atkinson can make an impression against players a level above the ones he’s faced so far. We know that Tongue has got something, even if he keeps it incredibly well hidden sometimes. And we know that Overton really hasn’t.” Overton has been a bit unlucky, I think, though I wouldn’t have selected him and it won’t be a surprise if he becomes a two-Test wonder. 65th over: India 273-6 (Jadeja 20, Jurel 0) Are England still in this game? I honestly have no idea. A strength can be a weakness. Yashasvi Jaiswal has fallen to what has been his favourite shot in this innings, cutting Tongue straight down the throat of Overton at deep backward point. He walks to a fully deserved ovation after making a superb, probably matchwinning 118 from 164 balls. 64th over: India 272-5 (Jaiswal 118, Jadeja 19) Jaiswal blasts Root towards extra cover, where Duckett dives to make a good stop. Root has started economically, with two overs for a single. Sooner rather than later, however, he is going downtown. 63rd over: India 271-5 (Jaiswal 118, Jadeja 18) Jaiswal tries to uppercut a wide short ball from Tongue, so wide that he can’t reach it. He gets an orthodox cut away for a couple later in the over, with Overton sliding to save the boundary. England’s three quick bowlers will struggle to feel their legs tomorrow morning. 62nd over: India 268-5 (Jaiswal 116, Jadeja 17) Well I’ll be dipped in dipping: Joe Root is coming on to bowl for the first time in the match. You feel like Jaiswal has waited all day for this… but he starts by playing out a maiden from Root. There was only one big shot which he mistimed; there will be more to come. 61st over: India 268-5 (Jaiswal 116, Jadeja 17) An inswinger from Tongue to Jadeja goes down the leg side for five byes. India are winning the Extras War hands down: they lead 61-11 across the whole game. “On the subject of penalising fielding sides that consistently fall behind the over rate,” begins Kim Thonger. “How about simply limiting bowler run ups until the over rate is back to where it should be?” Couldn’t we make the bowlers wear clown shoes until they catch up, then go to a public vote? 60th over: India 263-5 (Jaiswal 115, Jadeja 17) Jadeja flashes a short ball from Overton over the solitary slip for four, then steers a dreadful delivery to the same part of the boundary. England’s seamers look shattered. “\uFEFFRobster!” says Simon McMahon, who sounds like he might be high on sausage and cider. “Is there anything better than a Saturday afternoon at a sausage and cider festival a series deciding Oval Test match? All results still possible, and both teams going hard at it. Who’s your money on? Can England chase 350?” I’m not willing to discuss the result of this series but my sources tell me I should listen out for one particular name on Sunday evening: Desmond. 59th over: India 255-5 (Jaiswal 115, Jadeja 9) A bowling change, but there’s still no sign of the part-time spinners. Josh Tongue – who has bowled 19 overs in the innings and 35 in the match – replaces Atkinson and starts with two deliveries down the leg side to Jadeja. He gets his line right thereafter and the only run comes a thick inside-edge by Jadeja. India lead by 232. 58th over: India 254-5 (Jaiswal 115, Jadeja 8) Thanks Tanya, hell- oh there’s another dropped catch. Jaiswal fences Overton to the left of Duckett at leg slip; he can’t hang on to a very tough low chance and the ball runs away for four. That’s the sixth dropped catch of the innings. Overton follows up with a hooping yorker that is well defended by Jaiswal. 57th over: India 246-5 (Jaiswal 109, Jadeja 6) Pope is off again, communing with his overlord(s). Jadeja plays and misses at Atkinson, then four byes evade Jamie Smith, who has had a busy time behind the stumps. And here comes DRINKS, so I will hand over to Rob, who will expertly take you through to the close. Thanks for your company – bye! 56th over: India 239-5 (Jaiswal 109, Jadeja 2) Jadeja drives Overton with a tonk to pick up a couple, Jaiswal ignore the last juicy offering as it whispers in his ear. 55th over: India 234-5 (Jaiswal 108, Jadeja 1) Replays show that wicket-taking ball from Atkinson taking off like a jumping jack. And a sudden mood changer as Jaiswal takes a step forward and fires Atkinson through the covers for four – with feeling. Clutches his back leg in sudden, cramping pain afterwards. Done by some extra bounce from Atkinson, and Smith holds on! Huge relief for the Crawley-Brook axis and Karun, who never quite settled, shuffles off. 54th over: India 225-4 (Jaiswal 104, Karun 13) Oh my: catch number five goes down for England, in the slips again. Karun is squared up by Overton, Crawley dives delicately left and gets right in the eyeline of Brook, who watches the ball, but lets it slip through his fingers. Karun gets a life on 12. 53rd over: India 224-4 (Jaiswal 104, Karun 12) Nair still nervous, drives Atkinson with hasty abandon. \"England regretting going into consecutive Tests without a spinner.” Ooof Adam Roberts, that’s a bit much after lunch. I am looking forward to Rehan Ahmed playing an Ashes Test or two though. 52nd over: India 221-4 (Jaiswal 104, Karun 9) Tongue gets a rest, Overton takes his turn on the merry-go-round. Another four zips fine on leg side. The lights are on at The Oval, though most of the crowd are still in short sleeves. A shadow of a ghostly Chris Woakes drifts past the dressing-room window. 51st over: India 216-4 (Jaiswal 100, Karun 9) And there it comes, with a single – his fourth Test century against England. He jumps for joy, pulls off his helmet and gloves, dumps them on the ground, blows kisses to the balcony, and sends them a love heart. Goes back for a hug with Karun Nair, and then remembers he needs to re-gather his equipment. Karun tickles Atkinson for four round the corner. 50th over: India 209-4 (Jaiswal 97, Karun 5) Crawley is sent to wait for the upper cut. Jaiswal darts, nervously flittish, at Tongue. Time for some calming words from the dressing room tucked in a new pair of gloves. A misdirected bouncer, well half-stopped by SMith. 49th over: India 205-4 (Jaiswal 95, Karun 5) A single, that has to be quick thanks to a smart pick up and throw by Pope. An unconvincing four off the glove for Karun, past the leaping Smith. Then Karun is hit on the front pad. He’s oozing awkward teenager at a party. Good stuff from Atkinson. 48th over: India 200-4 (Jaiswal 94, Karun 1) A full-throated lbw appeal by Tongue, going legside, then a juicy floater which Jaiswal cuts to the rope. I remember Sharda Ugra telling me that the young Indian players all had immaculately cultivated beards as modelled by Virat Kohli. Now Gill and Jaiswal are clean shaven, there might be a new breed of less hirsute players coming through. Anyway, Jaiswal hiccups into the 90s. 47th over: India 193-4 (Jaiswal 87, Karun 1) Jaiswal has a hasty flash at a ball on a good length from Atkinson. He misses and Smith catches, surprised by the speed, tumbling onto his backside. Then Jaiswal plumps for the ramp and misses again – England should make the most of this nervous eighties. Too many emails to print about Pope looking for guidance from above, as the man himself directs his field. 46th over: India 192-4 (Jaiswal 86, Karun 1) Tongue from the Vauxhall end. Karun drives loosely and misses his first ball by a sneeze. Then a nasty bouncer that Karun ducks. Harry Brook bites his nails at slip. India must rebuild. 45th over: India 190-4 (Jaiswal 85, Karun 0) England start with a prolonged huddle, and Atkinson with an on-the-money full nip-backer which smacks Gill on the front pad. So he finishes tamely after a magnificent series - 754 runs at an average of 74. Atkinson greets Karun Nair with a shortish ball that he makes a horlicks of, shrinks into, and gets hit on the hand. The post-lunch over that England ordered. First ball! The umpire takes an age to make his mind up but eventually raises his finger. It looks very out, but Gill reviews… no bat on ball and ball tracking sends him merrily on his way, hitting the top of off stump. A fabulous segment on walking cricket on Sky. My own dad has taken it up at 78 and he is absolutely in love with it, having thought he’d never play again. Rob Smyth wrote a really nice piece about it last year. If you’re thinking about it, do take the plunge. “Since Ben Stokes has a busted right shoulder and Chris Woakes a busted left shoulder, perhaps England should consider gaffer-taping them together to make a complete functional cricketer?” types Matthew Lawrenson. “Nothing seems too outlandish in BazWorld these days.” How about Stokes’s heart, Archer’s speed, Josh Hull’s youth, Mark Wood’s yorker… help me out here. A potted highlights at lunch – what an awesome series this has been. But on a more mircro level, Stuart Broad thinks England should park Joe Root at one end after lunch and see what happens. He is, adds Broad, the leading Test wicket taker for England on the pitch. India’s session – as weary England troop off. They are missing Chris Woakes, and the dropped catch didn’t help either morale or the Test equation. Akash Deep provided bonus runs and India start after lunch with the dangerous Gill and Jaiswal hungry for more. I’m going to grab something to eat, back shortly. 44th over: India 189-3 (Jaiswal 85, Gill 11) The last over before lunch. Tongue the bowler, Gill leans in and drives a tired ball through the covers for a four delicious enough to be served up in The Oval’s swanky balcony restaurant. Jaiswal gets a sudden attack of cramp to to ensure there are no more overs, but it seems to have resolved itself as he walks off the field. England have a few gentle words in his ear. 43rd over: India 181-3 (Jaiswal 84, Gill 4) Gill shakes gloves and exchanges grins, with Akash Deep as the two pass – Akash Deep to huge applause. Gill gets off the mark with a waft of the wand at a short wide ball from Overton – four. Next ball, Overton follows through almost to Gills’ boots, giving him a stern look. Gill smiles boyishly back. At last! A leading edge which balloons up and Atkinson gulps it down at backward point. 42nd over: India 177-2 (Jaiswal 84, Akash Deep 66) On India plough – the hundred partnership comes up, in which Akash Deep has outscored Jaiswal two to one, as Akash Deep edges past a diving Duckett at gully. Then a top edged pull over the keeper for four more. Pope breathes a deep breath of exasperation. Tongue wipes his brow. Then a stolen single. 41st over: India 167-2 (Jaiswal 83, Akash Deep 57) The Oval has clouded over. Overton thunders in again, his shirt looks like it has had a boil wash too many. Oooof, Akash Deep edges a nice ball through third slip and gully, and down to the rope. Overton brings both hands to his head. Four byes to finish the over, as the ball takes off and flies legside past Jamie Smith. 40th over: India 158-2 (Jaiswal 82, Akash Deep 53) Atkinson looks weary – he’s not had much cricket in his legs this season, so this will be quite the work out. 39th over: India 155-2 (Jaiswal 80, Akash Deep 51) Overton, who seems to have given up on the short-ball tactics. Just a -quick- single off it. Hello Guy Hornsby. “They’re going to rue those drops as the runs tick by, especially when Jaiswal gets to his ton. Losing Woakes was massive, but England seemed to paper over that in the first innings. Now we look a bowler short with the pitch doing less and right at the time The Oval usually sees big runs in Championship games. India have a great chance to bat England out of the game today. I know we’ll fancy anything, and if batting gets easier, perhaps we’ll have a good go, but it feels things are turning pretty fast here.” England’s secret weapon is they won’t be scared to chase anything. And they’ve conditioned us and the opposition to think that way too. 38th over: India 154-2 (Jaiswal 80, Akash Deep 51) And Akash Deep reaches his maiden Test fifty with a cheeky inside edge four to the square leg boundary. He uppercuts the south London air, gets a big hug from Jaiswal. A grinning (helmetless) Gill appears on the balcony too, to give him whooping applause. 37th over: India 150-2 (Jaiswal 80, Akash Deep 47) A welcome maiden. A glance of Shubman Gill waiting in the Indian dressing room. He’s got his helmet on. Hope he hasn’t been wearing it for an hour and a half. “Australia must be licking their lips looking at the English attack for the last two Tests,” writes Brendan Large, “and when they can’t even catch their chances...might be a painful winter.” So much depends on how much Stokes can bowl. And how many Tests Archer can play. And if Wood is fit… 36th over: India 150-2 (Jaiswal 80, Akash Deep 47) England have slowed the run rate a bit over the last few overs – and as I write that, Deep tucks in to a wider ball from Atkinson, sending it spinning through gully for four . And another, a short fat one that he saws down to the rope. Without Stokes and Woakes, England will need to turn to one of their part-timers soon. 35th over: India 142-2 (Jaiswal 80, Akash Deep 39) Overton varies short and full – Broad think he should go full on with the short stuff. Akash Deep nearly gets one under his bat, kicks it away in a hurry. A wide. 34th over: India 139-2 (Jaiswal 79, Akash Deep 38) Akash Deep takes aim at Atkinson’s first ball back and sends it flying over midwicket for four A beautifully angled Jaiswal bat brings four past the slips. Winviz gives India a 65 per cent chance of winning – which, despite this morning’s antics, seems premature. Good morning Sandy Carrington! “I am curious about a line in your 28th over summary : “The cameras spot Pope in the dressing room, taking orders from above” . In scenarios like this when someone is a stand-in for the captain, who really calls the shots? “On a normal day, captains have a say on several aspects including who is in the team and who is out, on-field decisions etc. But when someone is standing in for an injured captain, does the stand-in captain get a say on these? Or are they expected to be a proxy for the real captain (and follow their orders)?” I have consulted with our man at The Oval. “It’s probably a blend of the two ... “ says Ali Martin. “Maybe last year when Stokes missed the SL series, Pope had greater autonomy. And sure he has to a degree here ... but obvious running off for ideas suggests it’s still Stokes calling a fair few of the shots.” 33rd over: India 129-2 (Jaiswal 74, Akash Deep 33) Overton with some short stuff, the field awaits. Bethell lurks on the rope, Crawley at third man, Duckett at gully. Deep steals a single and Jaiswal ducks two a row. 32nd over: India 127-2 (Jaiswal 73, Akash Deep 32) Tongue is looking the man most likely this morning. But India are not in any tearing hurry and just watchfully leave him alone/ show a straight bat. They take drinks, with the lead inching up to 104 and no joy for England – other than that dropped catch by Crawley. 31st over: India 126-2 (Jaiswal 73, Akash Deep 32) Overton starts with a juicy half volley, that Jaiswal can only fiddle for a single. Akash Deep reaches his highest Test score and Jaiswal closes the over out with a sudden, slightly over hasty pull, but only picks up a single. 30th over: India 121-2 (Jaiswal 71, Akash Deep 29) The fifty partnership comes up between Jaiswal and Akash Deep, in 12 overs. Jaiswal gives his partner a heartfelt pat on the shoulder. Two beauties from Tongue slither past a lunging Akash Deep. 29th over: India 118-2 (Jaiswal 70, Akash Deep 27) The result of the consultation with the brain’s trust is a change of bowler. Jamie Overton it is – Jaiswal leans back like a bear scratching his back on a tree and ramps him over the slips for four. Good morning Luke Woodward! “Yesterday’s post lunch turnaround from India had me wondering what goes on during a typical test match lunchtime. Would there have been big speeches from Gill and Gambhir? Does everyone sit down together and have a hot meal? How influential are the breaks on the course of the match? If you or any OBOers know, I’d be interested to hear.” The breaks are important, like half time in football but with feeling, but I don’t know exactly what goes on. Any intel gratefully received. 28th over: India 112-2 (Jaiswal 64, Akash Deep 27) The cameras spot Pope in the dressing room, taking orders from above. Akash Deep takes advantage of a loose ball from Tongue and picks up four through fine leg. The first 45 minutes are definitely India’s. 27th over: India 107-2 (Jaiswal 64, Akash Deep 22) Four drops in 27 overs. We spy Ben Stokes through a glass darkly in the dressing room. Without him, and Anderson, England are almost placid in the field. 26th over: India 105-2 (Jaiswal 63, Deep 20) Akash Deep is a lucky boy,. Hit in the ribs first ball from Tongue. Given not out lbw to the second – England review with certainty, but it is umpire’s call on leg stump. And next ball he is dropped by Crawley at third slip, who dives across Harry Brook – ball in and out, like a hot potato. He shakes his head ruefully. 25th over: India 105-2 (Jaiswal 63, Deep 20) Atkinson purrs unobtrusively in. Jaiswal tries to reign in his attacking instincts. An absorbing battle. And a huge OBO hello to Raman Kamboh and friends, also in the first session, but of an Amsterdam stag do. “We have configured a whole stag in Amsterdam around watching the first session. A pub in rRmbrandtsplein, tom jones “sex bomb” playing and Jaiswal finding form at the most pivotal session in 23 days of cricket. “The stag (Ash) is wearing a very tasteful outfit and ready for a full day of being a proud british Indian supporting India.” Have a wonderful day Ash, may you all be in fine fettle to watch the evening session.” 24th over: India 103-2 (Jaiswal 62, Deep 20) A lovely buzz from the Saturday-happy crowd at The Oval, many in Graham Thorpe headbands. 23rd over: India 101-2 (Jaiswal 61, Deep 19) A couple of singles then a well-run two from the last ball that brings up the hundred. Lots of flag waving from the Indians in the crowd and applause from the team, feet up on the balcony. “I dont know if my plaintive plea will be heard,” writes Will Ellen, “but if, or rather when, Harry Brook comes on to bowl please please please can whoever’s in charge of the Sky graphics have the courage of their convictions. In light of the hideous pies he was chucking down towards the fag end of the Old Trafford Test, Slow Right Arm filth seems fairly appropriate.” I will ask Ali to pass on your request. Things won’t be going to plan for England if he bowls today though… 22nd over: India 97-2 (Jaiswal 58, Deep 18) A friend of mine once said of a boyfriend that he was “dipped in Dettol.” Jaiswal also has this look, neat as a freshly laundered shirt. He doesn’t play like that though, and picks up four through the slips off Tongue – a risky flay that he gets away with. Four more from Deep, steered between gully and backward point. India motoring nicely this morning. 21st over: India 88-2 (Jaiswal 53, Deep 14) Bethell’s bowling stint is done – he was purely a devise so the bowlers could switch ends. On comes Atkinson, the pick of England’s bowlers. Deep lets fly at a a very full ball and picks up another useful four. A no ball adds to the total. Good morning Andrew Benton. “ India need a win to draw, and England need a draw to win. It’s been such a competitive series and is surely better for England’s preparation for the Ashes than if it had been a whitewash either way.” Very true. “What learning do you think they will take from it? Getting Joe Root not to take the bantz to heart is certainly something to work on.” 20th over: India 82-2 (Jaiswal 52, Deep 10) Josh Tongue at the other end, who bowled much better and with more venom yesterday evening than he had in the first innings. Starts with one that swings down the legside, but then on the money. India are watchful. 19th over: India 81-2 (Jaiswal 51, Deep 10) Jacob Bethell with the ball, which wasn’t what I was expecting. He seems to have modelled his hair on Robin Smith. Deep swipes him for four third ball. And again, on one knee – but just for two this time. Here come the players. Jaiswal fiddles with his bat grip and squats behind the boundary as Jerusalem plays over the sound system. “India can’t win today, says Dinesh Karthik, “but they can lose.” “Has Allen MacDonald seen Sunday’s weather forecast?” asks Matthew Doherty. As you mention it, I’ve checked. It doesn’t look too bad? Cloudy with spells of light rain. Nasser asks Broad if he misses the dressing room. No, says Broad, because he’s walked into another, with Sky. “I feel really content,” he says. Long may it continue. Nasser Hussain and Stuart Broad are wandering around the England dressing room at The Oval. Ollie Pope has 14 bats in his locker. There’s also an ice bath and sauna. The biggest bat throwers of their different eras? YJB and Stokes and Nasser himself and Ramprakash. Time for a quick coffee, back shortly. An email! “Good morning Tanya! Hello there, Allan MacDonald. ”Looking forward to seeing how they manage to stretch *this* Test to the 5th day… ”Will be solely relying on your own excellent updates until after the Rugby’s over. ”In some ways think it’s probably time for this grumpy series to end, great though it’s been. But will miss the companionship of you and your colleagues!” Thank you! We will miss it too. For all the issues, good and bad, of the Hundred, the disappearance of Test cricket in August has been the hardest to digest. Though having said that, next year Pakistan’s men come over and play two Tests in August. Sky are showing England’s three drops yesterday evening. Alas, poor Liam Dawson. Letting Jaiswal slip through the fingers twice is certainly sub-optimal. Michael Atherton is very exercised by Akash Deep putting his arm around Duckett after dismissing him – “cricket is a non-contact sport and should stay that way.” And Barney’s rhapsody to Gus Atkinson – I’m very keen on his description of Duckett’s Hedgehog Sweep. Incidentally, he mentions Sonny Baker, who took three wickets at pace yesterday as Hampshire pressed Worcestershire at New Road. This was Ali’s take on a memorable day two: Good morning! After the fiery furnace of day two, we roll into day three - which could be the crucial one in the series. And yes, we have been here before. The pitch is spicy, the players tetchy, the house full – and the weather promises to behave – barring the odd light shower. India have a 52 run lead, eight wickets left, and Jaiswal, whose series has drifted, will have his eyes on three figures and beyond. England’s stand-in fast bowers, Atkinson excepted, will want to perform with more bells and fewer whistles second time around. Play starts at 11am, don’t miss a ball of the last Test Saturday of the summer."

That wicket makes India strongish favourites to square the series, but England’s merry band of run-chasers won’t go quietly. One way or another, tomorrow should be the last day of this terrific series. Goodnight. Fantastic bowling from Mohammed Siraj! He changed the field as if for the short ball, only to hit Crawley with a perfect yorker that sneaked under the bat and rammed into the stumps. A fantastic way to end another compelling day. It was the fifth ball of the over This morning, during a charming interview on Sky Sports, Siraj said that when he goes to bed at night he needs to know he has given absolutely everything on the field. If not, he struggles to settle. He’ll sleep like a baby tonight. Crawley backs away just as Siraj is about to bowl the second ball of the over. Unlike at Lord’s he isn’t timewasting as this was always going to be the final over. Shubman Gill folds his arms and smiles; Crawley also breaks into a little grin. Oh to be a fly on the wall when the two teams get together tomorrow night for an end-of-series chat. Oh my, Crawley isn’t smiling now! Mohammed Siraj has bowled him with a spectacular yorker! Time for one more over before the close. Mohammed Siraj will bowl it. 13th over: England 50-0 (Crawley 14, Duckett 34) Crawley ends his mini drought with a tight single to mid-on off Krishna. Duckett then punches a couple to bring up another fifty partnership with his cricketing BFF, this one in exactly 13 overs. Apparently we now live in a world in which two England openers add 50 in 13 overs in a Test match and it feels on the slow side. 12th over: England 44-0 (Crawley 13, Duckett 30) Siraj jumps wide on the crease to zip a cracking delivery past Crawley’s attempted drive. India would love to take one of their beloved opponents with them before the close. Crawley started fluently and scored 13 from his first 11 balls; since then he’s made 0 from 18. “Robinho!” hics Simon McMahon, who really does sound like if he’s high on sausages and cider. “Is there anything better on a Saturday evening than getting a lift home from the ever understanding and loving Mrs McMahon after being at a sausage and cider festival all day and arriving home in time to see the end of the days play and then switch to Celebrity Pointless watching Crawley and Duckett make early inroads into what not long ago would have seemed an impossible target, but that now wouldn’t be all that remarkable were it to be reached. That’s Bazball’s greatest achievement, right? Backing yourself, trusting in the process. Talent plus self belief. How else would I have been able to neck 18 pints and eat three foot longs today?” 11th over: England 43-0 (Crawley 13, Duckett 29) That was a really nasty blow. And though Duckett is okay to continue, he’s clearly still in a bit of pain. 10.4 overs: England 42-0 (Crawley 13, Duckett 28) Krishna changes ends to replace Deep. He beats Duckett twice, then pins him on the bottom hand with a brutish delivery. Duckett is in a fair bit of pain and the physio has come onto the field. 10th over: England 42-0 (Crawley 13, Duckett 28) Duckett gets four more with an edge over gully off Siraj. It hasn’t been easy – the odd ball is moving sharply off the seam – but England have started well. 9th over: England 37-0 (Crawley 13, Duckett 23) Duckett times Deep pleasantly down the ground for a couple, then scrunches wide of the sprawling Jadeja at mid-on for three. So far so good for England’s openers, even if they haven’t recaptured the audacity of their first-innings partnership. England need another 337 to win. 8th over: England 32-0 (Crawley 13, Duckett 18) With just over 30 minutes remaining, Mohammed Siraj is let off the leash by Shubman Gill. His third delivery is too full and punched emphatically through mid-off for four by Duckett. After 16 consecutive dot balls, England need that hit of oxygen. “I was surprised to read your statement on Tongue currently being the top wicket-taker despite only playing three Tests,” writes Tom Van der Gucht. “He seems to fall in that bracket of bowlers (along with the likes of Steven Finn and Devon Malcolm) who take wickets but are mistrustedby captains and selectors due to their economy rates. “Do you think England have not got the balance between dependability and maverick wicket-takers quite right this series? I know they were aiming for the knock-out blow in the last Test, hence sticking with Archer and Carse despite them being knackered. But the golden balance seems to be a steady Woakes / Potts seamer, pacier and more metronomic Atkinson/Carse and tearaway stumps rattler Archer/Wood/Tongue and Stokes... Or maybe I’m going too much down a Michael Vaughan Cricket Manager 2007 PC rabbit hole (and if I was, I’d end up doing something ludicrous like drop Stokes for Curran in order to get some left arm angles) in order to cheat the algorithm.” It’s possibly more nuanced than that, and I’m not sure I’d agree with the categorisation of Archer and Carse. I suppose one of the few downsides of having a big group of quick bowlers is that you have to decide which three to pick for each game based on fitness, morale, the pitch, the opposition and so on. For 15 years, with a handful of exceptions, England only had to choose one quick bowler for each match. 7th over: England 27-0 (Crawley 13, Duckett 13) The pressure is building. Crawley, hit on the thigh by the previous delivery, tries to smear Deep into outer space and is beaten. Two maidens in a row – that can’t have happened too often against Crawley and Duckett – and just one run from the last 17 deliveries. 6th over: England 27-0 (Crawley 13, Duckett 13) Duckett feels for a good delivery from Krishna and is beaten. At least he didn’t leave it. Krishna completes a rare maiden, just the third of the match for India. Duckett usually starts the English car but tonight he’s straining for rhythm. His 13 has come from 24 balls, Crawley’s from 13. 5th over: England 27-0 (Crawley 13, Duckett 13) A few words between Duckett and Deep enliven an otherwise quiet over. No contact to report, yet. “I agree with you, I think (with hindsight) I would have rested Jofra for Old Trafford and played him here,” says John Swan. “I guess the difficulty is, who would have the self-discipline to have Jofra available and not pick him...? Maybe there was an element too of expecting a more traditional Old Trafford wicket? Even though it’s well-known to be a slab, at least this year...” Yeah, in this case it’s hindsight-driven but I do think England are slightly inflexible, perhaps even macho, with their use of fast bowlers. Gus Atkinson, for example, was way down on speed by the end of the New Zealand tour after playing 11 Tests out of a possible 12 in less than six months. 4th over: England 24-0 (Crawley 13, Duckett 10) Duckett tries to pull Krishna, doesn’t make proper contact and clonks the ball over mid-off for a single. Crawley, whose game looks in much better order than it did at the start of the series, times a lovely cut past backward point for four. 3rd over: England 16-0 (Crawley 7, Duckett 8) Crawley is beaten, chasing a very wide short ball from Deep. England desperately need these two to set the tone as they did in the big run-chase at Headingley. And when England chased 378 against India at Edgbaston in 2022, Crawley and Alex Lees added 107 in 21.4 overs. (Lees also produced one of the great sledging retorts.) After carving his first boundary behind square, Crawley is hit on the right bicep by an exceedingly nasty lifter. It hit the fleshy part of the arm so he’s fine to continue once the pain subsides. India are very chirpy in the field, as they should be in this position. Deep’s second over ends with a grotesque seaming lifter, barely legal. It beats Duckett all ends up and almost clears the leaping Jurel. Good luck playing that. Duckett, a man who would probably retain a resting heart rate if you dropped a marmot in his bath, looks at the pitch and smiles wryly. 2nd over: England 10-0 (Crawley 2, Duckett 8) India have a cover sweeper in place for Crawley, so a trademark thump yields only one run rather than four. There’s nobody on the boundary when Duckett helps himself to successive boundaries from errant deliveries on leg stump. The first was tucked off the hip, the second chipped over backward square leg. 1st over: England 1-0 (Crawley 1, Duckett 0) Eeeyyyyyyyyah, almost the perfect start for India. Deep’s fifth ball seamed and bounced sharply to hit Duckett on the top of the pad; they went up for LBW before rightly concluding it would have bounced over the top. Prasidh Krishna will share the new ball, a change of policy from the first innings. Mohammed Siraj has been at his best with an ageing ball. There are still 25 overs remaining tonight, not that we’ll get them in. Akash Deep is about to open the bowling. England need 374 to win. They chased 371 in the first Test at Headingley. We all love it when the end of a story references the beginning, don’t we? Josh Tongue picks up a five-for in the usual style – caught midwicket off a skier. Washington launched him miles in the air and was well caught by Crawley, who almost collided with Pope as he took the catch. That’s a terrific effort from Tongue, who has bowled 30 overs in the second innings alone. He finishes with 5 for 125 in the innings, 8 for 182 in the match and 19 in the series – that’s the most on either side, though Siraj should overtake him in the next 24 hours. Washington smacked a brutal 53 from 46 balls and added 39 for the last wicket with Prasidh Krishna, who faced precisely two deliveries. 87th over: India 396-9 (Washington 53, Krishna 0) Even the mishits are working out for Washington. He clonks the last ball from Atkinson over mid-on for … a single, which allows him to keep the strike. “Is there anything better,” begins Simon McMahon, who sounds like he’s high on sausages and cider, on a Saturday teatime in early August than being at a sausage and cider festival watching the last recognised batsman throwing the bat with No. 11 at the other end as the bowling side get more and more frustrated and the crowd lap it up?” 86.5 overs: India 395-9 (Washington 52, Krishna 0) Washington slashes and pulls Atkinson for successive boundaries – then launches a monstrous six over midwicket to reach his fifty from only 39 balls. At one stage he had 17 from 27! This is a thrilling assault from a player of enormous substance. That six has done such damage to the ball that it will need to be changed. 86th over: India 379-9 (Washington 36, Krishna 0) The value of that bye becomes apparent when Washington hooks Tongue for two sixes in three balls. Big ones, too, almost a mirror image of Ian Botham at Old Trafford in 1981. Tongue bowls successive wides before Washington takes a single off the fifth legitimate delivery of the over. Krishna has one ball to survive… and Tongue spears it down the leg side. India lead by 356. 85th over: India 364-9 (Washington 23, Krishna 0) Washington goes into T20 mode, lifting a full ball from Atkinson for a big six over midwicket. Atkinson tries to hide the last delivery to keep Washington down at that end; Krishna thwarts him by stealing a bye to the keeper. 84th over: India 357-9 (Washington 17, Krishna 0) Ah, that’s why Siraj was keen to go upstairs – he got a very thin inside edge. Sudharsan and Jurel wasted reviews earlier in the innings. “Cheers for pointing me towards that OBO of England v India in the T20 World Cup years ago,” writes John Davis. “I always enjoy reading those with the benefits of hindsight. Particularly enjoyed this little gem later on: ‘Anderson - a good bowler, maybe very good, but still laughably overrated in this country’.” For some reason, I had a wart on my fanny over Anderson throughout the summer of 2009. I don’t mind getting it wrong – everyone does – but I wish I could take back some of the sneering, arrogant language. Josh Tongue picks up his seventh wicket of a match in which he has blown hot and cold. He gets Siraj out of there straight away with a full, quick delivery that hits the pad in front of middle and leg. Siraj considers a review, then realises India don’t have any left. I think it would have hit leg stump. Ravindra Jadeja had never previously scored 300 runs in a Test series. He finishes this one with 516 runs at an average of 86 – including 315 at 315 in the second innings. Ravindra Jadeja has been dismissed in the second innings of a Test match. He snicked Tongue to second slip, where Brook took the catch to his right. There was no celebration from Brook, only a look of slight disgust because of the earlier dropped catches. 83rd over: India 356-7 (Jadeja 53, Washington 16) A huge inducker from Atkinson beats Jadeja all ends up and hits him on the pad, leading to a strangled shout for LBW from England. It did so much that it would have missed leg stump. Probably too high as well. “Have to say this is the best pitch this series,” writes Arul Kanhere. “A shame those who could have most exploited it are not playing in this match. Nevertheless, the cricket has been good, aside from the drops. Not that I am complaining.” Yep, it’s a much better contest. At the start of the Bazball era England were praised for concentrating only on the game in front of them, a welcome change from the confused selection policy in the previous winter’s Ashes. But if they had their time again, I wonder whether they would have rested Jofra Archer or Brydon Carse in the fourth Test to save them for this game. 82nd over: India 354-7 (Jadeja 52, Washington 15) Jadeja cuts Josh Tongue for four to reach another half-century, his fifth of the series in addition to the century at Old Trafford. Champions turn failure into fuel. Jadeja has responded to a lean winter, when he averaged 26 across eight Tests, by having easily the best series of his career with the bat/ 81st over: India 345-7 (Jadeja 47, Washington 11) England are such a bunch of weirdos – no that was a compliment – that they’ll still fancy their chances of winning this game. Gus Atkinson takes the new ball and steels himself for what he hopes will be one last spell. Washington takes a tight single to mid-on, one of three from the over. 80th over: India 342-7 (Jadeja 45, Washington 10) Washington whips Root stylishly through mid-on for four. And with that, it’s time for the second new ball. India lead by 319. 79th over: India 338-7 (Jadeja 45, Washington 6) Jadeja nails a pull for four off Overton. He’s averaging 102 in this series and has scored 307 runs without being dismissed in the second innings of the five Tests. If/when Jadeja gets out, his second innings average across the whole series will be second only to Sunil Gavaskar against West Indies on the famous 1970-71 tour. 67*, 64*, 117*, 220 = 468 runs at an average of 468 “You wrote ‘This is a nice opportunity for Jurel to remind the selectors of his batting ability’” says Nick Lezard. “Could you say something complimentary about Washington, please?” I’ve heard good things about Pearl Street Warehouse!! (Been a long series, sorry.) 78th over: India 330-7 (Jadeja 38, Washington 5) Two left-handers at the crease now, so Root replaces Bethell at the Match Up End. Three singles from a forgettable over. Let’s just move on, CAN WE? 77th over: India 327-7 (Jadeja 36, Washington 4) Jadeja and Washington, the Old Trafford centurions, are reunited. Washington gets going with a pair of twos. “I’ve basically loved Jadeja since just after the second world war,” writes Robert Wilson. “I’ve regularly pelted you OBO-jockeys with my early-adopter passion. Yes, I know Ashwin was the connoisseur’s choice but I am not a sophisticated guy. Jadeja is basically left-arm orthodox’s Darren Gough, all arse and attitude. “He’s also the worst kind of all-rounder for opposition teams. The all-rounder who is not even meant to be an all-rounder. That is simply an insult. Particularly to specialist batsmen on a bad run, scraping and sweating over a two-hour twenty something and who then have to watch Ravindra come out and smack it all over like a cut-price Errol Flynn. l “A Jadeja 30 or 40 is a wonderfully bargain-bin affair, all own-brand and bruised fruit. All his shots look like he downloaded them illegally but there’s nothing he can’t play. And when he tweaks one during his 25-second overs, he can make any one look like a tit. I’d loved to be sledged by him. I bet he’s good at that too.” Sixteen years ago – sixteen years ago – Jadeja played a match-losing innings against England at Lord’s in the T20 World Cup. Fair to say it reinforced his clarity: since then he’s been on the winning side in 218 international matches. And quite a few of those victories have come off his own bat/ball/arse/attitude. Jamie Overton picks up his second wicket. Jurel plays down the wrong line of a fuller delivery that straightens to hit the flap of the back pad. That’s plumb. For some reason Jurel decides to spaff India’s last review before walking off. 76th over: India 323-6 (Jadeja 35, Jurel 34) This is a nice opportunity for Jurel to remind the selectors of his batting ability. Were it not for him, it would have been 2-2 going into the final Test between these sides 18 months ago. When Jadeja’s time comes, a middle order of Gill, Pant, Washington and Jurel would score oodles of runs. And you’d have a world-class wicketkeeper. And Rishabh Pant could play as a specialist batter. It might free him up, as he can be a bit self-conscious with the bat. “As every day, week, month and year passes, Don Bradman becomes greater and greater,” writes Will Ellen. 2No one can touch him. No one can even get close to touching him. This has been a batting series that dreams are made of for Shubman Gill, but he has still ‘only’ averaged 75.4, 25 odd less than the Don. (The fact he averages 99.94, rather than say 100.3, reminds us he’s human) “In terms of the greatest, Messi has Pele and Maradona, Djokovic has Federer and Nadal, O’Sullivan has Hendry and Davis, F1 probably has a few people who are good at driving round in circles (I wouldn’t know, I don’t watch it). But in batting terms Bradman is just peerless.” Yep, it’s almost mind-blowing how superior he is to everybody else who has played the game apart from Andy Ganteaume. His average is almost akin to a three-minute mile. 75th over: India 320-6 (Jadeja 34, Jurel 33) Red Bloke puts a beige jumper over his shirt, prompting applause from the crowd and a thumbs-up from Jadeja. Overton, summoning energy from goodness knows where, rams a terrific short ball that Jadeja top-edges straight over the keeper’s head for four. India lead by 297. 74th over: India 312-6 (Jadeja 27, Jurel 32) A man in a suit asks Red Bloke to move; Red Bloke declines his kind offer. Then a chap wearing a bib emblazoned with the word MANAGER wanders over, leading to this bit of commentary on Sky. Nasser Hussain “The manager’s gonna have a word.” Stuart Broad (deadpan) “How d’you know he’s the manager?” 73rd over: India 310-6 (Jadeja 27, Jurel 30) Jamie Overton returns after tea, confirmation that Atkinson and Tongue will take the second new ball. The poor buggers have already bowled 49 overs between them! A quiet over from Overton is dominated by a fella behind the sightscreen whose red polo shirt is putting the Indian players off. Said fella is oblivious to this and looks very confused when he seems himself on the big screen for the second time in 30 seconds. “A lot of tennis matches have been decided by “unforced errors “ and crucial double faults,” says Krishnamoorthy V. “Dropped catches amount to the same in a cricket match. England may still chase what needs to be chased but I get a feeling that they might end up regretting these drops and fall just short.” Agree. I find it weird and dispiriting that every England defeat needs to be framed as some kind of moral failing, or decisive evidence in the case of R v. Bazball. At times in this game England’s bowling and catching has been poor; India have been the better team. I’m not sure there’s any more to it than that. 72nd over: India 307-6 (Jadeja 27, Jurel 27) India’s batters have a dilemma: do they try to pummel England’s part-time spinner(s) until the second new ball available or accumulate sensibly and build India’s lead? For now it’s the latter – three singles from Bethell’s over. “Shelve the cricket for a moment,” writes Brian Rafferty. “I’d just like to say a huge thank you to you and the team, and to fellow OBO contributors, for the warmth and companionship when it is needed most. “The tributes to Thorpey were lovely to read yesterday but the quality of writing in here is something else. You are all watching and responding at the same time and still manage to express yourselves in such beautiful ways. Thank you. There – that’s my hug back to you all.” Thanks Brian. It’s Daniel Harris and the readers who deserve credit for yesterday’s coverage; I’ll be sure to pass it on. The evening session The players are back on the field. This will be an extended session to make up some of the time lost on the first day. Jacob Bethell is going to start. 71st over: India 304-6 (Jadeja 26, Jurel 25) Jurel finishes the session with a flourish, driving and pulling Tongue for back-to-back boundaries. A thick edge for two brings up India’s 300, then he clips the last ball of the session for three more. India go to tea with a lead of 281. They definitely have enough this time. They might have enough. They probably have enough. Is this even enough? Enough already! 70th over: India 291-6 (Jadeja 26, Jurel 12) Joe Root starts a new spell with a pie that is gobbled up by Jurel. We shouldn’t forget that he’s a proper player who averages almost 50 in first-class cricket. Talking of proper players, Jadeja has yet to be dismissed in the second innings in this series: he’s 288 not out. Spinners are supposed to come to the party in the second innings but that’s ridiculous. 69th over: India 284-6 (Jadeja 25, Jurel 6) “Even though Overton’s likelihood for the next series is declining, there seems to be a drift against Sam Cook too,” says John Starbuck. “Atkinson and Tongue are obviously going to travel but there doesn’t seem to be any favourites from the County Championship. All the established one are crocked or, at least, liable to be crocked again.” One problem, made by Yas on the excellent Wisden podcast, is that county pitches have been very flat all summer so most of the England contenders are averaging in the 30s. Fitness permitting, England will take Atkinson, Archer, Wood, Tongue, Carse and maybe one more. Contenders include Sam Cook, Matt Potts, Olly Stone, Dillon Pennington, maybe even Eddie Jack. My hunch is it’ll be Stone or Pennington. 68th over: India 282-6 (Jadeja 24, Jurel 5) Jurel flashes Atkinson through the vacant backward point region for his first boundary. Later in the over an LBW shout is caught in the throat because of an inside edge. India lead by 259. “I find myself feeling pretty ambivalent about the result of this Test,” says Joshua Keeling. “Yes, I’d like England to win, but we can’t lose the series, and to be honest, it’s been such a close series between two evenly matched teams, a draw feels about right.” It’ll be a bit of a travesty if India lose 2-1, never mind 3-1. Mind you, this time last week I thought England were going to win 4-1; in that context a draw would be a little deflating. I guess the historical merit of a 2-2 draw – and I’m not saying this is right – will be determined by what happens in the Ashes. 67th over: India 278-6 (Jadeja 24, Jurel 1) Replays show Jadeja thought he was out too; he only reviewed the LBW after encouragement from Dhruv Jurel. Yep, the decision is overturned. He was hit on the toe by a sizzling inswinging yorker from Tongue, a delivery so persuasive that Kumar Dharmasena raised the finger even though it hit Jadeja outside the line. The decision was overturned on review but now Jadeja needs treatment after having his toe crushed by that delivery from Tongue. I think he’ll be okay to continue. Jadeja is out LBW to Tongue – but he’s reviewed and I think it’ll be overturned. 66th over: India 276-6 (Jadeja 22, Jurel 1) The wicket leads to a change of plan from England: Root off, Atkinson on. The new batter Jurel is sent back by Jadeja and has to scramble to make his ground; Duckett’s throw missed the stumps but I’m pretty sure he would have been safe. “This is gone innit?” says Phil Harrison. “Shame. Still, silver linings yet? We now know that Atkinson can make an impression against players a level above the ones he’s faced so far. We know that Tongue has got something, even if he keeps it incredibly well hidden sometimes. And we know that Overton really hasn’t.” Overton has been a bit unlucky, I think, though I wouldn’t have selected him and it won’t be a surprise if he becomes a two-Test wonder. 65th over: India 273-6 (Jadeja 20, Jurel 0) Are England still in this game? I honestly have no idea. A strength can be a weakness. Yashasvi Jaiswal has fallen to what has been his favourite shot in this innings, cutting Tongue straight down the throat of Overton at deep backward point. He walks to a fully deserved ovation after making a superb, probably matchwinning 118 from 164 balls. 64th over: India 272-5 (Jaiswal 118, Jadeja 19) Jaiswal blasts Root towards extra cover, where Duckett dives to make a good stop. Root has started economically, with two overs for a single. Sooner rather than later, however, he is going downtown. 63rd over: India 271-5 (Jaiswal 118, Jadeja 18) Jaiswal tries to uppercut a wide short ball from Tongue, so wide that he can’t reach it. He gets an orthodox cut away for a couple later in the over, with Overton sliding to save the boundary. England’s three quick bowlers will struggle to feel their legs tomorrow morning. 62nd over: India 268-5 (Jaiswal 116, Jadeja 17) Well I’ll be dipped in dipping: Joe Root is coming on to bowl for the first time in the match. You feel like Jaiswal has waited all day for this… but he starts by playing out a maiden from Root. There was only one big shot which he mistimed; there will be more to come. 61st over: India 268-5 (Jaiswal 116, Jadeja 17) An inswinger from Tongue to Jadeja goes down the leg side for five byes. India are winning the Extras War hands down: they lead 61-11 across the whole game. “On the subject of penalising fielding sides that consistently fall behind the over rate,” begins Kim Thonger. “How about simply limiting bowler run ups until the over rate is back to where it should be?” Couldn’t we make the bowlers wear clown shoes until they catch up, then go to a public vote? 60th over: India 263-5 (Jaiswal 115, Jadeja 17) Jadeja flashes a short ball from Overton over the solitary slip for four, then steers a dreadful delivery to the same part of the boundary. England’s seamers look shattered. “﻿Robster!” says Simon McMahon, who sounds like he might be high on sausage and cider. “Is there anything better than a Saturday afternoon at a sausage and cider festival a series deciding Oval Test match? All results still possible, and both teams going hard at it. Who’s your money on? Can England chase 350?” I’m not willing to discuss the result of this series but my sources tell me I should listen out for one particular name on Sunday evening: Desmond. 59th over: India 255-5 (Jaiswal 115, Jadeja 9) A bowling change, but there’s still no sign of the part-time spinners. Josh Tongue – who has bowled 19 overs in the innings and 35 in the match – replaces Atkinson and starts with two deliveries down the leg side to Jadeja. He gets his line right thereafter and the only run comes a thick inside-edge by Jadeja. India lead by 232. 58th over: India 254-5 (Jaiswal 115, Jadeja 8) Thanks Tanya, hell- oh there’s another dropped catch. Jaiswal fences Overton to the left of Duckett at leg slip; he can’t hang on to a very tough low chance and the ball runs away for four. That’s the sixth dropped catch of the innings. Overton follows up with a hooping yorker that is well defended by Jaiswal. 57th over: India 246-5 (Jaiswal 109, Jadeja 6) Pope is off again, communing with his overlord(s). Jadeja plays and misses at Atkinson, then four byes evade Jamie Smith, who has had a busy time behind the stumps. And here comes DRINKS, so I will hand over to Rob, who will expertly take you through to the close. Thanks for your company – bye! 56th over: India 239-5 (Jaiswal 109, Jadeja 2) Jadeja drives Overton with a tonk to pick up a couple, Jaiswal ignore the last juicy offering as it whispers in his ear. 55th over: India 234-5 (Jaiswal 108, Jadeja 1) Replays show that wicket-taking ball from Atkinson taking off like a jumping jack. And a sudden mood changer as Jaiswal takes a step forward and fires Atkinson through the covers for four – with feeling. Clutches his back leg in sudden, cramping pain afterwards. Done by some extra bounce from Atkinson, and Smith holds on! Huge relief for the Crawley-Brook axis and Karun, who never quite settled, shuffles off. 54th over: India 225-4 (Jaiswal 104, Karun 13) Oh my: catch number five goes down for England, in the slips again. Karun is squared up by Overton, Crawley dives delicately left and gets right in the eyeline of Brook, who watches the ball, but lets it slip through his fingers. Karun gets a life on 12. 53rd over: India 224-4 (Jaiswal 104, Karun 12) Nair still nervous, drives Atkinson with hasty abandon. "England regretting going into consecutive Tests without a spinner.” Ooof Adam Roberts, that’s a bit much after lunch. I am looking forward to Rehan Ahmed playing an Ashes Test or two though. 52nd over: India 221-4 (Jaiswal 104, Karun 9) Tongue gets a rest, Overton takes his turn on the merry-go-round. Another four zips fine on leg side. The lights are on at The Oval, though most of the crowd are still in short sleeves. A shadow of a ghostly Chris Woakes drifts past the dressing-room window. 51st over: India 216-4 (Jaiswal 100, Karun 9) And there it comes, with a single – his fourth Test century against England. He jumps for joy, pulls off his helmet and gloves, dumps them on the ground, blows kisses to the balcony, and sends them a love heart. Goes back for a hug with Karun Nair, and then remembers he needs to re-gather his equipment. Karun tickles Atkinson for four round the corner. 50th over: India 209-4 (Jaiswal 97, Karun 5) Crawley is sent to wait for the upper cut. Jaiswal darts, nervously flittish, at Tongue. Time for some calming words from the dressing room tucked in a new pair of gloves. A misdirected bouncer, well half-stopped by SMith. 49th over: India 205-4 (Jaiswal 95, Karun 5) A single, that has to be quick thanks to a smart pick up and throw by Pope. An unconvincing four off the glove for Karun, past the leaping Smith. Then Karun is hit on the front pad. He’s oozing awkward teenager at a party. Good stuff from Atkinson. 48th over: India 200-4 (Jaiswal 94, Karun 1) A full-throated lbw appeal by Tongue, going legside, then a juicy floater which Jaiswal cuts to the rope. I remember Sharda Ugra telling me that the young Indian players all had immaculately cultivated beards as modelled by Virat Kohli. Now Gill and Jaiswal are clean shaven, there might be a new breed of less hirsute players coming through. Anyway, Jaiswal hiccups into the 90s. 47th over: India 193-4 (Jaiswal 87, Karun 1) Jaiswal has a hasty flash at a ball on a good length from Atkinson. He misses and Smith catches, surprised by the speed, tumbling onto his backside. Then Jaiswal plumps for the ramp and misses again – England should make the most of this nervous eighties. Too many emails to print about Pope looking for guidance from above, as the man himself directs his field. 46th over: India 192-4 (Jaiswal 86, Karun 1) Tongue from the Vauxhall end. Karun drives loosely and misses his first ball by a sneeze. Then a nasty bouncer that Karun ducks. Harry Brook bites his nails at slip. India must rebuild. 45th over: India 190-4 (Jaiswal 85, Karun 0) England start with a prolonged huddle, and Atkinson with an on-the-money full nip-backer which smacks Gill on the front pad. So he finishes tamely after a magnificent series - 754 runs at an average of 74. Atkinson greets Karun Nair with a shortish ball that he makes a horlicks of, shrinks into, and gets hit on the hand. The post-lunch over that England ordered. First ball! The umpire takes an age to make his mind up but eventually raises his finger. It looks very out, but Gill reviews… no bat on ball and ball tracking sends him merrily on his way, hitting the top of off stump. A fabulous segment on walking cricket on Sky. My own dad has taken it up at 78 and he is absolutely in love with it, having thought he’d never play again. Rob Smyth wrote a really nice piece about it last year. If you’re thinking about it, do take the plunge. “Since Ben Stokes has a busted right shoulder and Chris Woakes a busted left shoulder, perhaps England should consider gaffer-taping them together to make a complete functional cricketer?” types Matthew Lawrenson. “Nothing seems too outlandish in BazWorld these days.” How about Stokes’s heart, Archer’s speed, Josh Hull’s youth, Mark Wood’s yorker… help me out here. A potted highlights at lunch – what an awesome series this has been. But on a more mircro level, Stuart Broad thinks England should park Joe Root at one end after lunch and see what happens. He is, adds Broad, the leading Test wicket taker for England on the pitch. India’s session – as weary England troop off. They are missing Chris Woakes, and the dropped catch didn’t help either morale or the Test equation. Akash Deep provided bonus runs and India start after lunch with the dangerous Gill and Jaiswal hungry for more. I’m going to grab something to eat, back shortly. 44th over: India 189-3 (Jaiswal 85, Gill 11) The last over before lunch. Tongue the bowler, Gill leans in and drives a tired ball through the covers for a four delicious enough to be served up in The Oval’s swanky balcony restaurant. Jaiswal gets a sudden attack of cramp to to ensure there are no more overs, but it seems to have resolved itself as he walks off the field. England have a few gentle words in his ear. 43rd over: India 181-3 (Jaiswal 84, Gill 4) Gill shakes gloves and exchanges grins, with Akash Deep as the two pass – Akash Deep to huge applause. Gill gets off the mark with a waft of the wand at a short wide ball from Overton – four. Next ball, Overton follows through almost to Gills’ boots, giving him a stern look. Gill smiles boyishly back. At last! A leading edge which balloons up and Atkinson gulps it down at backward point. 42nd over: India 177-2 (Jaiswal 84, Akash Deep 66) On India plough – the hundred partnership comes up, in which Akash Deep has outscored Jaiswal two to one, as Akash Deep edges past a diving Duckett at gully. Then a top edged pull over the keeper for four more. Pope breathes a deep breath of exasperation. Tongue wipes his brow. Then a stolen single. 41st over: India 167-2 (Jaiswal 83, Akash Deep 57) The Oval has clouded over. Overton thunders in again, his shirt looks like it has had a boil wash too many. Oooof, Akash Deep edges a nice ball through third slip and gully, and down to the rope. Overton brings both hands to his head. Four byes to finish the over, as the ball takes off and flies legside past Jamie Smith. 40th over: India 158-2 (Jaiswal 82, Akash Deep 53) Atkinson looks weary – he’s not had much cricket in his legs this season, so this will be quite the work out. 39th over: India 155-2 (Jaiswal 80, Akash Deep 51) Overton, who seems to have given up on the short-ball tactics. Just a -quick- single off it. Hello Guy Hornsby. “They’re going to rue those drops as the runs tick by, especially when Jaiswal gets to his ton. Losing Woakes was massive, but England seemed to paper over that in the first innings. Now we look a bowler short with the pitch doing less and right at the time The Oval usually sees big runs in Championship games. India have a great chance to bat England out of the game today. I know we’ll fancy anything, and if batting gets easier, perhaps we’ll have a good go, but it feels things are turning pretty fast here.” England’s secret weapon is they won’t be scared to chase anything. And they’ve conditioned us and the opposition to think that way too. 38th over: India 154-2 (Jaiswal 80, Akash Deep 51) And Akash Deep reaches his maiden Test fifty with a cheeky inside edge four to the square leg boundary. He uppercuts the south London air, gets a big hug from Jaiswal. A grinning (helmetless) Gill appears on the balcony too, to give him whooping applause. 37th over: India 150-2 (Jaiswal 80, Akash Deep 47) A welcome maiden. A glance of Shubman Gill waiting in the Indian dressing room. He’s got his helmet on. Hope he hasn’t been wearing it for an hour and a half. “Australia must be licking their lips looking at the English attack for the last two Tests,” writes Brendan Large, “and when they can’t even catch their chances...might be a painful winter.” So much depends on how much Stokes can bowl. And how many Tests Archer can play. And if Wood is fit… 36th over: India 150-2 (Jaiswal 80, Akash Deep 47) England have slowed the run rate a bit over the last few overs – and as I write that, Deep tucks in to a wider ball from Atkinson, sending it spinning through gully for four . And another, a short fat one that he saws down to the rope. Without Stokes and Woakes, England will need to turn to one of their part-timers soon. 35th over: India 142-2 (Jaiswal 80, Akash Deep 39) Overton varies short and full – Broad think he should go full on with the short stuff. Akash Deep nearly gets one under his bat, kicks it away in a hurry. A wide. 34th over: India 139-2 (Jaiswal 79, Akash Deep 38) Akash Deep takes aim at Atkinson’s first ball back and sends it flying over midwicket for four A beautifully angled Jaiswal bat brings four past the slips. Winviz gives India a 65 per cent chance of winning – which, despite this morning’s antics, seems premature. Good morning Sandy Carrington! “I am curious about a line in your 28th over summary : “The cameras spot Pope in the dressing room, taking orders from above” . In scenarios like this when someone is a stand-in for the captain, who really calls the shots? “On a normal day, captains have a say on several aspects including who is in the team and who is out, on-field decisions etc. But when someone is standing in for an injured captain, does the stand-in captain get a say on these? Or are they expected to be a proxy for the real captain (and follow their orders)?” I have consulted with our man at The Oval. “It’s probably a blend of the two ... “ says Ali Martin. “Maybe last year when Stokes missed the SL series, Pope had greater autonomy. And sure he has to a degree here ... but obvious running off for ideas suggests it’s still Stokes calling a fair few of the shots.” 33rd over: India 129-2 (Jaiswal 74, Akash Deep 33) Overton with some short stuff, the field awaits. Bethell lurks on the rope, Crawley at third man, Duckett at gully. Deep steals a single and Jaiswal ducks two a row. 32nd over: India 127-2 (Jaiswal 73, Akash Deep 32) Tongue is looking the man most likely this morning. But India are not in any tearing hurry and just watchfully leave him alone/ show a straight bat. They take drinks, with the lead inching up to 104 and no joy for England – other than that dropped catch by Crawley. 31st over: India 126-2 (Jaiswal 73, Akash Deep 32) Overton starts with a juicy half volley, that Jaiswal can only fiddle for a single. Akash Deep reaches his highest Test score and Jaiswal closes the over out with a sudden, slightly over hasty pull, but only picks up a single. 30th over: India 121-2 (Jaiswal 71, Akash Deep 29) The fifty partnership comes up between Jaiswal and Akash Deep, in 12 overs. Jaiswal gives his partner a heartfelt pat on the shoulder. Two beauties from Tongue slither past a lunging Akash Deep. 29th over: India 118-2 (Jaiswal 70, Akash Deep 27) The result of the consultation with the brain’s trust is a change of bowler. Jamie Overton it is – Jaiswal leans back like a bear scratching his back on a tree and ramps him over the slips for four. Good morning Luke Woodward! “Yesterday’s post lunch turnaround from India had me wondering what goes on during a typical test match lunchtime. Would there have been big speeches from Gill and Gambhir? Does everyone sit down together and have a hot meal? How influential are the breaks on the course of the match? If you or any OBOers know, I’d be interested to hear.” The breaks are important, like half time in football but with feeling, but I don’t know exactly what goes on. Any intel gratefully received. 28th over: India 112-2 (Jaiswal 64, Akash Deep 27) The cameras spot Pope in the dressing room, taking orders from above. Akash Deep takes advantage of a loose ball from Tongue and picks up four through fine leg. The first 45 minutes are definitely India’s. 27th over: India 107-2 (Jaiswal 64, Akash Deep 22) Four drops in 27 overs. We spy Ben Stokes through a glass darkly in the dressing room. Without him, and Anderson, England are almost placid in the field. 26th over: India 105-2 (Jaiswal 63, Deep 20) Akash Deep is a lucky boy,. Hit in the ribs first ball from Tongue. Given not out lbw to the second – England review with certainty, but it is umpire’s call on leg stump. And next ball he is dropped by Crawley at third slip, who dives across Harry Brook – ball in and out, like a hot potato. He shakes his head ruefully. 25th over: India 105-2 (Jaiswal 63, Deep 20) Atkinson purrs unobtrusively in. Jaiswal tries to reign in his attacking instincts. An absorbing battle. And a huge OBO hello to Raman Kamboh and friends, also in the first session, but of an Amsterdam stag do. “We have configured a whole stag in Amsterdam around watching the first session. A pub in rRmbrandtsplein, tom jones “sex bomb” playing and Jaiswal finding form at the most pivotal session in 23 days of cricket. “The stag (Ash) is wearing a very tasteful outfit and ready for a full day of being a proud british Indian supporting India.” Have a wonderful day Ash, may you all be in fine fettle to watch the evening session.” 24th over: India 103-2 (Jaiswal 62, Deep 20) A lovely buzz from the Saturday-happy crowd at The Oval, many in Graham Thorpe headbands. 23rd over: India 101-2 (Jaiswal 61, Deep 19) A couple of singles then a well-run two from the last ball that brings up the hundred. Lots of flag waving from the Indians in the crowd and applause from the team, feet up on the balcony. “I dont know if my plaintive plea will be heard,” writes Will Ellen, “but if, or rather when, Harry Brook comes on to bowl please please please can whoever’s in charge of the Sky graphics have the courage of their convictions. In light of the hideous pies he was chucking down towards the fag end of the Old Trafford Test, Slow Right Arm filth seems fairly appropriate.” I will ask Ali to pass on your request. Things won’t be going to plan for England if he bowls today though… 22nd over: India 97-2 (Jaiswal 58, Deep 18) A friend of mine once said of a boyfriend that he was “dipped in Dettol.” Jaiswal also has this look, neat as a freshly laundered shirt. He doesn’t play like that though, and picks up four through the slips off Tongue – a risky flay that he gets away with. Four more from Deep, steered between gully and backward point. India motoring nicely this morning. 21st over: India 88-2 (Jaiswal 53, Deep 14) Bethell’s bowling stint is done – he was purely a devise so the bowlers could switch ends. On comes Atkinson, the pick of England’s bowlers. Deep lets fly at a a very full ball and picks up another useful four. A no ball adds to the total. Good morning Andrew Benton. “ India need a win to draw, and England need a draw to win. It’s been such a competitive series and is surely better for England’s preparation for the Ashes than if it had been a whitewash either way.” Very true. “What learning do you think they will take from it? Getting Joe Root not to take the bantz to heart is certainly something to work on.” 20th over: India 82-2 (Jaiswal 52, Deep 10) Josh Tongue at the other end, who bowled much better and with more venom yesterday evening than he had in the first innings. Starts with one that swings down the legside, but then on the money. India are watchful. 19th over: India 81-2 (Jaiswal 51, Deep 10) Jacob Bethell with the ball, which wasn’t what I was expecting. He seems to have modelled his hair on Robin Smith. Deep swipes him for four third ball. And again, on one knee – but just for two this time. Here come the players. Jaiswal fiddles with his bat grip and squats behind the boundary as Jerusalem plays over the sound system. “India can’t win today, says Dinesh Karthik, “but they can lose.” “Has Allen MacDonald seen Sunday’s weather forecast?” asks Matthew Doherty. As you mention it, I’ve checked. It doesn’t look too bad? Cloudy with spells of light rain. Nasser asks Broad if he misses the dressing room. No, says Broad, because he’s walked into another, with Sky. “I feel really content,” he says. Long may it continue. Nasser Hussain and Stuart Broad are wandering around the England dressing room at The Oval. Ollie Pope has 14 bats in his locker. There’s also an ice bath and sauna. The biggest bat throwers of their different eras? YJB and Stokes and Nasser himself and Ramprakash. Time for a quick coffee, back shortly. An email! “Good morning Tanya! Hello there, Allan MacDonald. ”Looking forward to seeing how they manage to stretch *this* Test to the 5th day… ”Will be solely relying on your own excellent updates until after the Rugby’s over. ”In some ways think it’s probably time for this grumpy series to end, great though it’s been. But will miss the companionship of you and your colleagues!” Thank you! We will miss it too. For all the issues, good and bad, of the Hundred, the disappearance of Test cricket in August has been the hardest to digest. Though having said that, next year Pakistan’s men come over and play two Tests in August. Sky are showing England’s three drops yesterday evening. Alas, poor Liam Dawson. Letting Jaiswal slip through the fingers twice is certainly sub-optimal. Michael Atherton is very exercised by Akash Deep putting his arm around Duckett after dismissing him – “cricket is a non-contact sport and should stay that way.” And Barney’s rhapsody to Gus Atkinson – I’m very keen on his description of Duckett’s Hedgehog Sweep. Incidentally, he mentions Sonny Baker, who took three wickets at pace yesterday as Hampshire pressed Worcestershire at New Road. This was Ali’s take on a memorable day two: Good morning! After the fiery furnace of day two, we roll into day three - which could be the crucial one in the series. And yes, we have been here before. The pitch is spicy, the players tetchy, the house full – and the weather promises to behave – barring the odd light shower. India have a 52 run lead, eight wickets left, and Jaiswal, whose series has drifted, will have his eyes on three figures and beyond. England’s stand-in fast bowers, Atkinson excepted, will want to perform with more bells and fewer whistles second time around. Play starts at 11am, don’t miss a ball of the last Test Saturday of the summer.
