  It is hailed as a global endeavour to explore the hidden universe – a powerful
  telescope comprising more than 130,000 antennae being built in outback Western
  Australia. Along with a sister telescope in South Africa, the Square Kilometre
  Array Observatory is a €2bn (A$3.6bn) project tasked with mapping the first
  billion years of the universe. One day, the SKAO’s antennae – which look like
  metal Christmas trees scattered across the desert – could confirm the
  existence of extraterrestrial life, prove Einstein’s theory of relativity and
  explain how galaxies have evolved over time. But while the venture is being
  lauded as one of the most significant scientific endeavours of the 21st
  century, the Guardian can reveal that the organisation managing the funds of
  16 member states has been rocked by allegations of financial misconduct. The
  organisation has denied any wrongdoing. The Australian government contribution
  to the SKAO has blown out by more than $150m from 2020 to 2024 compared with
  its initial budget, with the additional expenditure partly attributed to
  funding shortfalls for the project. In March this year, as the telescope in
  Australia captured its first images of faraway galaxies using just 1% of its
  capacity, a former senior employee of the project was filing a “protected
  disclosure” report calling for an investigation into the SKAO’s financial
  management. As an intergovernmental organisation, the Square Kilometre Array
  Observatory is not subject to national laws or regulatory oversight in
  Australia where the employee is based, so the complaint went directly to the
  organisation’s global chair, the Italian astrophysicist Filippo Maria Zerbi.
  The concerns outlined in the disclosure had previously been raised with senior
  staff internally. In response to the whistleblower’s report, an email from
  Zerbi – sent in May 2025 and seen by the Guardian – confirms the organisation
  is conducting an external independent evaluation of the litany of allegations
  made against it. The email states that the chair is taking “all necessary
  actions” in response to the concerns raised, and given the volume of disclosed
  information, “further external and independent investigation into specific
  elements is necessary before reaching any conclusions and proceeding with the
  next steps”. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The whistleblower has also raised
  concerns with the financial reporting council in the UK where the SKAO is
  headquartered, claiming the structure of the organisation had created a
  “regulatory blind spot” that had allowed for the “systematic deception of 16
  sovereign governments”. The Square Kilometre Array Observatory was established
  by an international treaty in 2019, endowing it with special legal status; it
  is immune from normal legal processes and exempt from paying tax.
  International staff employed on the project in Australia are hired on
  diplomatic visas. While the UK and Australia are majority shareholders in the
  project, the total financial contributions of each member nation are not
  disclosed. The Australian government announced in 2021 that it would
  contribute $387m to the SKAO over a decade for the construction and operation
  of the telescope, with $141m committed over the four-year forward estimates.
  At the time, the then prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the project would
  “help our scientists make more discoveries than we can imagine today, whether
  it’s better understanding the origin and future of our stars and galaxies, to
  how gravity works across the universe”. Portfolio budget statements for the
  Department of Industry, Science and Resources published since show the total
  amount spent is substantially more than this, with a total spend of $475m from
  2021 to 2025. A department spokesperson said the additional spending included
  Australia’s member state contributions to the SKAO Observatory and
  “Australia’s other commitments to the SKA project, including investment in the
  Australian SKA Regional Centre and site readiness and local communities”.
  “Part of the investment is also leveraging the Australian SKA site’s fibre
  optic connection to provide connectivity for two communities nearby to the
  site – the Pia Wadjarri Remote Aboriginal Community and the Murchison
  Settlement,” the spokesperson said. The amount spent between 2020 and 2024 was
  $164m more than initially budgeted in 2020. The spokesperson said there had
  been changes to the administered budgeted expenses for the SKA project “due to
  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, adjustments to economic parameters,
  and the reprofiling of funds as part of regular updates to budget estimates”.
  In the 2025-26 budget, the government announced an additional $47.9m in the
  budget’s contingency reserve “to address funding shortfalls for the SKA
  project” alongside other member nations. In response to the disclosure, a copy
  of which has been seen by the Guardian, Zerbi has initiated an investigation
  into claims that public funds from member states have been lost through
  trading accounts – and then covered up by the organisation through the
  shuffling of funds internally. At the centre of the misconduct allegations is
  a claim that at least £12m (A$25.1m) was lost through investment in three
  money market funds, with one fund allegedly losing 45% of its value. The
  Guardian has seen balance sheet extracts and statements that appear to confirm
  the investments by the SKAO, which is headquartered at the Jodrell Bank
  Observatory near Manchester. The report also calls for an investigation into
  claims funds are being shifted within the organisation, and currency
  fluctuations being fabricated to conceal these losses from the governing
  council overseeing the project. A spokesperson for the SKAO denied the
  allegations, but confirmed it was “assisting an independent, external
  investigation” into them. “No capital loss has been incurred in these
  investment holdings. Money market funds are inherently low-risk, highly liquid
  investments and were selected for SKAO’s investment portfolio for this
  reason,” the spokesperson said. “Any reduction seen in the investment balances
  relates to amounts being redeemed (withdrawn) from the investments to support
  SKAO’s normal cash requirements, for example to pay suppliers and staff
  salaries.” “SKAO follows recognised best practice, and its financial
  activities and reports are subject to rigorous internal audits and independent
  external audits which are reported to Finance Committee and Council. No
  adverse findings of note have been reported.” Other complaints detailed in the
  whistleblower’s report include allegations that procurement budgets have been
  mismanaged, leading to delays and change in scope. One example is the
  project’s failure to build a permanent power supply to the telescope at the
  Australian site, which is now being run on temporary diesel generators. The
  SKAO website claims power for the project’s central processing plant “is
  provided by a photovoltaic plant [solar] and energy storage system backed up
  by diesel generators, generating renewable energy a majority of the time to
  power the antennas and all site infrastructure”. However, no solar plant has
  yet been built. The project is yet to award a tender for the power plant and
  is allegedly spending more than $1m a year on diesel to power the plant. A
  tender document published by the SKAO in March reveals that a “phase one”
  diesel-operated system for the site is “expected to be operational in early
  2026”, with the tender seeking interest to build a “phase two” power plant to
  integrate renewable energy. The SKAO spokesperson confirmed that the project
  would be running on diesel generators until the long-term solar-based plant
  was operational – expected in late 2028. “An expert team is implementing a
  complex multi-stage power procurement process that will result in a long-term
  power purchase agreement with an independent power provider to build and
  operate a radio quiet power station with a very high fraction of power
  generated from solar photovoltaic cells and using a substantial battery energy
  storage system.” The Guardian can also reveal that a €5m European Commission
  grant claimed by the SKAO consortium for infrastructure development was
  partially clawed back. A letter sent from the European Research Executive
  Agency to the UK-based deputy director general of the SKAO, Simon Berry,
  indicates that the commission was seeking repayment of €3.4m that had already
  been paid. It is understood that the amount ultimately recognised by the
  European Commission was €2.5m of the original €5m grant after many of the
  claimed costs were deemed ineligible. The grant, allocated under the Horizon
  2020 program, had been intended to support “the detailed design of the
  infrastructure required” for the telescope sites in Australia and South
  Africa. The SKAO spokesperson said the grant had been overseen by the SKA
  organisation – the predecessor company to the SKAO that is in the process of
  being wound up. “As is often the case, with a complex major project of this
  sort, there were some costs deemed ineligible, but by the closeout of the
  project these were modest in nature and the arrangements resolved amicably
  between all the project partners and the EC, with the full knowledge and
  approval from the Organisation’s governance structures,” the spokesperson
  said. An “internal update” circulated within the organisation in early July
  suggests there have also been changes to the project’s scope and schedule.
  According to the update, a “programme and schedule risk review” had
  established “extensions to our Mid and Low schedules”. (“Low” refers to the
  Australian telescope, while “Mid” refers to the project in South Africa.) The
  document also refers to a “budget gap” that will be assessed over the coming
  months. “Then we’ll look at how we can manage this, through reducing or
  deferring some of our scope.” The circular states that the organisation is
  aware that “our current contingency budget is insufficient to cover the
  expected ECPs [engineering change proposals] and remaining risk” of the
  project. In response to questions from the Guardian about the project’s
  changed scope, the SKAO spokesperson said: “The scope and schedule of the SKA
  project, a massive undertaking to deliver the world’s two largest and most
  complex radio telescopes, are under constant review. “SKAO Council, comprising
  representatives of the governments of the member states that make up SKAO and
  supported by its Finance Committee, has oversight of all such issues. A recent
  schedule update has been notified to Council and the wider scientific
  community, and is driven by programmatic not financial reasons,” he said.
