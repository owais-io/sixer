  The ticket resale website StubHub may have failed to prevent breaches of
  consumer law on its platform when it allowed a prolific tout to advertise more
  than 300 tickets for a Lewis Capaldi concert, experts have said. StubHub and
  fellow secondary ticketing platform Viagogo are under intense scrutiny from
  ministers, who are considering whether to ban for-profit ticket resale in an
  effort to protect fans. Despite the increased attention, analysis of listings
  on StubHub indicates the use of business practices that consumer groups and
  music industry figures and ticketing experts believe are likely to be
  unlawful. One company, TG Cyprus Event Services Ltd (TGCES), was listing
  tickets for Oasis, Billie Eilish, the England v India cricket Test series and
  autumn rugby internationals, as of early July. TGCES, whose name StubHub is
  required to disclose because the company sells more than 100 tickets a year,
  also advertised Wimbledon final seats for £41,900 each. But the event that
  appears to have been most heavily targeted by TGCES was the opening night of a
  hotly anticipated series of arena shows by Capaldi. The tour, the
  singer-songwriter’s first after a two-year period in which he has struggled
  with his mental health, sold out within seconds. Disappointed fans expressed
  their outrage when resale sites including Viagogo and StubHub began
  advertising tickets at large markups soon afterwards. Both companies say they
  do not set the prices charged by sellers on their platforms and provide
  guarantees to ensure fans are protected if anything goes wrong. According to
  listings analysed by the Guardian, TGCES advertised at least 306 seats for
  Capaldi’s tour opener at the Sheffield Arena on StubHub on 6 September. The
  tickets were on sale for up to £248, more than three times their face value.
  Ticketing experts questioned whether it was possible for one company to
  advertise so many tickets without breaking the law. “These listings give very
  clear reason to suspect industrial-scale criminality,” said Reg Walker, a
  ticketing and security expert. “There is no legal way to harvest tickets in
  such bulk,” he said, adding that many touts did so by using illegal methods
  such as automated bots or multiple identities, to bypass purchase limits.
  “That would be fraud,” Walker said. StubHub said it did not condone the use of
  bots but said they were “an issue that takes place on primary platforms” – the
  authorised tickets sales agents – and said these websites should do more to
  tackle them. Walker said the only plausible alternative explanation for TGCES
  listing so many tickets was that it was engaging in a different, but also
  fraudulent, practice known as speculative selling. In the touting world,
  “spec” selling is when professional ticket traders list and sell tickets that
  they don’t have. They then try to source a ticket for a lower price elsewhere,
  leveraging their touting contacts and knowledge of the ticketing market. If
  they are successful, they pocket the difference. If they are not, they
  typically cancel the transaction and process a refund, leaving the buyer
  disappointed. The Guardian has previously published evidence that touts have
  used StubHub and Viagogo to profit from speculative listings. Resale platforms
  receive a commission on every sale. StubHub did not address the TGCES listings
  directly but said it did not permit speculative selling on its platform. Lisa
  Webb, a law expert at the consumer group Which?, said the Capaldi listings
  were “yet another example of a broken ticketing industry that desperately
  needs fixing”. “Which? is calling on ministers to urgently put a stop to the
  touts and introduce a price cap to ensure that tickets can only be resold on
  secondary sites at the original price paid,” she said. “Resale platforms must
  also be forced to verify that the seller owns a ticket before it can be listed
  on their site.” Last year, the Guardian revealed that TGCES was advertising
  1,596 tickets for the long-anticipated Oasis reunion tour, which proved to be
  a feeding frenzy for professional touts. StubHub removed the listings shortly
  after the Guardian approached the company for comment but appears to have
  allowed TGCES to return to the platform. A spokesperson for StubHub said: “We
  enforce strict measures to protect consumers. Any ticket listings found not to
  be compliant with our requirements are removed.” TGCES did not return requests
  for comment sent to its website and multiple employees on LinkedIn, including
  a person whose corporate records suggest is the company’s director, Nikolas
  Karasamanis. It has previously also failed to respond to requests for comment.
  A spokesperson for Ticketmaster, one of the primary ticket agents for
  Capaldi’s tour, said: “Ticketmaster has capped resale prices at face value
  since 2018. We fully support the government’s plans for an industry-wide cap
  that would remove the incentive for touts to exploit fans and prevent them
  from paying inflated prices on unauthorised sites. “We also urge the
  government to take further action by cracking down on bots and banning
  speculative ticket sales.” Ticketmaster is the subject of a separate
  investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority over whether it broke
  consumer law in the way it sold more than 900,000 tickets for Oasis’s reunion
  tour last year.
