  The chancellor has said she has “full confidence” in Angela Rayner as more
  details emerged about when the deputy prime minister became aware she had
  underpaid tax. Rayner has referred herself to the government’s independent
  ethics adviser and HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) after making the admission.
  The leader of the opposition, Kemi Badenoch, has called for Rayner to resign,
  but Keir Starmer has backed his deputy, telling MPs he was “very proud to sit
  alongside” her. Rayner said in a statement on Wednesday that when she bought a
  £800,000 flat in Hove she took legal advice that suggested she was “liable to
  pay standard stamp duty”, but had then sought further advice from a leading
  tax counsel after headlines about the arrangement. She learned that the
  initial advice had been inaccurate and she was liable to pay additional stamp
  duty. That was because she had put her stake in her constituency home in
  Ashton-under-Lyne into a trust set up in 2020 for her disabled son. It is
  further understood that Rayner was given three separate pieces of legal advice
  before buying the property in Hove. Sources said a conveyancer and two experts
  in trust law had all suggested that the amount of stamp duty she paid on the
  property was correct and that she acted on the advice she was given at the
  time. Speaking to Sky News, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said: “I have full
  confidence in Angela Rayner. She’s a good friend and a colleague. She has
  accepted the right stamp duty wasn’t paid. That was an error; that was a
  mistake. “She is working hard now to rectify that, in contact with HMRC, to
  make sure that the correct tax is paid. “Anyone that saw Angela’s statement
  yesterday, saw her interview yesterday, I think will have a lot of sympathy
  with some of the challenging family circumstances around this, around Angela’s
  disabled son.” Reeves said Rayner received “definitive” advice on Wednesday.
  Earlier on Sky News, the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said she
  received initial advice on Monday – on the same day the prime minister gave a
  full-throated defence of his deputy in an interview with Matt Chorley on BBC 5
  Live. Phillipson told Sky News: “The deputy prime minister sought advice at
  the point of purchase of the house, which enacted in line with the advice that
  she received. “She then subsequently sought expert advice on that. That
  original version returned on Monday, but it wasn’t later clarified until the
  Wednesday, further questions that were addressed through the advice.” She
  added that it was only once a court order preventing discussion of Rayner’s
  tax affairs was lifted “on Tuesday evening” and “once final legal advice [was]
  returned on Wednesday” that the position could be set out. Asked whether the
  prime minister had known Rayner had underpaid tax on Monday, Phillipson said:
  “The deputy prime minister has been clear for some time that she believed she
  had acted in good faith, that she had paid what was required of her through
  that house purchase. “It then became clear subsequently that that wasn’t the
  case, that additional stamp duty was owed. “That was following new, fresh
  legal advice, but as I say there were limitations on what could be discussed
  given the existence of a court order that was there to protect her family and
  to protect her son.”
