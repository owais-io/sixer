  The creator of the Freddo chocolate bar would be rolling in his grave if he
  could see the prices being charged for a treat that cost 10p back in its 1990s
  heyday, his daughter has said. Leonie Wadin said she once waited impatiently
  for her father, Harry Melbourne, to come home with boxes of Freddos, but has
  now vowed never to buy another one. “Dad was disgusted with how small it is
  now and how much they charge for it,” Leonie Wadin, 74, told Sky News from her
  home in Melbourne. “He’d roll over in his grave if he could see it now; he’d
  be disgusted. It was a penny chocolate. Since Dad died, I haven’t bought a
  Freddo.” Melbourne created the chocolate at the age of 14, Wadin said. In
  1930, he changed the mind of a boss who wanted a chocolate mouse. “He said
  children are scared of mice, so why not a frog? Because kids go down to the
  lake and catch tadpoles,” Wadin said. The chocolate, named after his “best
  mate”, Fred, was launched in Australia about a year later, selling for a
  penny. In 1973, it had a brief stint on British shelves, before gaining
  widespread popularity in the UK after relaunching in the 1990s. A Cadbury’s
  Freddo now commonly sells for about 30p or 35p – though there have been
  examples of the bars selling for up to £1 each. Some have claimed this
  inflation is emblematic of a country in which even simple pleasures have
  become unsustainably expensive. However, Sky’s analysis suggested that, by
  some measures, a Freddo has become less expensive than it was in the 1990s.
  For example, it said it now represents a smaller proportion of an hour’s work
  at minimum wage. Wadin told the broadcaster she wanted her children and
  grandchildren to remember her father’s achievement. “They’re very proud of
  their great-grandad, they still buy them, they love them. “Carry on through
  every heritage, that’s what I want. The Freddo has to be passed on, Freddo is
  never going to die. It will always be there … I just want it all passed down,
  so that the frog is always in our lives.” Mondelēz International, which owns
  Cadbury, said: “Whilst it’s important to stress that as a manufacturer we do
  not set the retail prices for products sold in shops, our manufacturing and
  supply chain costs have increased significantly over the past 50 years, and
  Freddo has become more expensive to make. “We have absorbed these increased
  costs wherever possible, however on occasion we have made changes to our list
  prices or multipack sizes to ensure that we can continue to provide consumers
  with the Freddo that they love, without compromising on the great taste and
  quality they expect.”
