  Bowl?

bodyText: >-
  This will be the year of … The Micah Parsons revenge tour. Ignore the nonsense
  coming out of Dallas. Jerry Jones’s claim that Parsons hurt the Cowboys’ run
  defense is laughable. So is the idea that Parsons’ ego was an issue. NFL
  history is filled with game-breaking pass-rushers with big egos or, umm,
  personality quirks. What matters is production, and Parsons is a one-of-a-kind
  pass-rushing force, capable of detonating the pocket from any alignment. No
  defender has generated more pressures since Parsons entered the league. With
  him on the field, the Cowboys had the No 1 defense in the league; when he was
  off the field, they fell to the second-worst unit in the league. If he needed
  any extra motivation, the Cowboys booting him on the way out should provide
  it. OC The running quarterback. Not the quarterback who can get outside the
  pocket with mobility, but the quarterback who is a legitimate running threat.
  In pro football history, including the postseason, there have been eight
  seasons in which a quarterback ran for more than a 1,000 yards in a season.
  Two of those examples happened in 2024 – Lamar Jackson’s 1,035 yards, and
  Jayden Daniels’ 1,026. Add in QBs like Josh Allen, Jalen Hurts and Kyler
  Murray, and the league’s designed quarterback run concepts could be amplified
  in 2025. DF You do not trade away star edge-rushers in their prime. Jones’s
  idiotic decision to trade Parsons to Green Bay is set to be franchise-altering
  for both teams. How it plays out for both sides will be the talk of the
  league. MJ This is the beginning of the end. First-down technology is here,
  the chain gang merely standing idle to measure the distance in case their
  robot overlords fail. In 30 years, when we are watching a AI infused VR
  simulation of a simulation of the NFL, you will see the folly of all this.
  Bring back Gene Steratore’s magic paper, before it’s too late! GS An exciting
  youth movement at quarterback. Six quarterbacks (Daniels, Michael Penix Jr, CJ
  Stroud, Brock Purdy, Bo Nix and JJ McCarthy) 25 or under will start for teams
  that are likely to be in playoff contention. Daniels, Stroud, and Purdy could
  become MVP candidates and lead their teams deep into the postseason. The
  25-and-under quarterbacks whose teams are projected to miss the playoffs (Cam
  Ward, Bryce Young, and Caleb Williams) will also draw national attention. AS
  Best team that won’t make the playoffs … Daniels is a phenom. But the
  Commanders are relying on ageing and declining stars to fill out key
  positions. Despite having a 24-year-old quarterback, the Commanders have the
  oldest roster since 2012. Maybe pairing that veteran savvy with Daniels’ magic
  will click. More likely, injuries will bite, the team’s pass-rush will remain
  sub-par, and they will fall away before January. OC Yes, the Vikings managed a
  14-3 regular-season record in the brutal NFC North last year, but they did on
  the back of Sam Darnold’s unpredictably great season … until it wasn’t. I
  don’t have the same faith in McCarthy to make that kind of leap, even with a
  fine head coach, Kevin O’Connell, in his corner. DF Ben Johnson had options,
  and he chose Chicago, seemingly with a plan to develop Williams. The Bears
  used their first three picks this year on offensive players. Look for Chicago
  to start gelling as the season goes on, before the brutal trifecta of the
  Packers, 49ers, and Lions in the Bears’ final three games sees them fall just
  short of the postseason. MJ The Rams would walk into the postseason if
  everything goes their way. However a 37-year-old Matthew Stafford dealing with
  a herniated disc feels like a case of when, not if, he is replaced by Jimmy
  Garoppolo. The underpowered backup quarterback will leave his team short. GS
  Joe Burrow and Ja’Marr Chase, leading one of the NFL’s most explosive
  offenses, will solidify themselves as the league’s top quarterback-wide
  receiver duo. However, that will not be enough to overcome deficiencies on
  defense. Al Golden has implemented a new defensive scheme, but without a
  drastic overhaul, the Bengals will fall short of the playoffs again. AS The
  most underrated team this year is … Last season ended with a playoff win, but
  it still felt underwhelming thanks to an offensive line that hung Stroud out
  to dry. That’s been patched, if not fixed. It’s the defense, though, that will
  drag the Texans deep into the postseason. They have gamechanging players at
  all three levels. OC The Bears may not win a ton of games in the loaded NFC
  North, but Johnson will make the most of Williams in the QB’s second season,
  and new defensive coordinator Dennis Allen could reform the Monsters of the
  Midway. Not a playoff team in 2025, but an opponent nobody will want to face.
  DF The Broncos are probably underdiscussed rather than underrated. Nix was
  overshadowed by Daniels in the rookie of the year conversation, not to mention
  Patrick Mahomes in his own division. Sean Payton has been overshadowed by Andy
  Reid and Jim Harbaugh. Yet Payton reminded everyone that he is a coaching
  wizard, turning Nix into a force and making the playoffs. With last season’s
  Defensive Player of the Year, stud corner Patrick Surtain II, leading an elite
  defense, the Broncos have the tools to make a run. MJ If Murray and Marvin
  Harrison Jr find some chemistry then the Cardinals could make waves in the
  playoffs. They should have one of the meanest defensive fronts in the NFL
  after picking up pass rusher Josh Sweat, so if the offense can step up they
  have great potential. GS Stroud will be a top 10 quarterback with help from
  offensive weapons Nico Collins, Nick Chubb, and rookie Jayden Higgins.
  Defensively, the Texans will cause havoc for opposing quarterbacks, with edge
  rushers Will Anderson Jr and Danielle Hunter leading the way. AS One bold
  prediction … Rodgers will end his career on the bench. It’s all kumbaya in
  Pittsburgh for now. But once the games start, the Rodgers of New York will
  turn up: skittish in the pocket, inaccurate, unable to create on the fly. If
  the Steelers stumble, Tomlin will need to pivot to rookie sixth-rounder Will
  Howard. OC Mike Tomlin’s Steelers tenure will come to an end. The Rodgers
  experiment looks like a flameout for all kinds of reasons, and while I think
  it will be more about Tomlin’s own frustration than the franchise’s desire to
  move on, there’s always that one shocking coaching move ... DF Bill Belichick
  returns to the NFL … to coach the Dolphins. Mike McDaniel’s struggles from
  last season look likely to continue as Belichick’s might after a rather
  inauspicious start with the Tar Heels. Surely a very late career move to sunny
  Florida makes sense? He certainly knows the division quite well. GS Saquon
  Barkley will again rush for over 2,000 yards, this time breaking Eric
  Dickerson’s record of 2,105. Go big or go home, right? The record falls this
  season as the Eagles continue Barkley’s astronomical workload behind that
  stellar offensive line. Why tinker with success as long as Barkley’s body can
  handle it? MJ Shedeur Sanders will end the season as QB 1 for the Browns. Joe
  Flacco, 40, will serve as the starter for the first month or two. Dillon
  Gabriel will get an opportunity to start during midseason. But as the losses
  pile up, the fans and local media will call for Sanders to get a shot. He will
  be the sole reason the Browns garner national viewership in December. AS
  Johnny Manziel disaster waiting to happen department The Browns and Saints
  will have worse records, but the Colts’ season could spiral faster. GM Chris
  Ballard and head coach Shane Steichen are already on the hot seat, and they
  have new owners to please. Starting Daniel Jones over Anthony Richardson is
  understandable, but it is leading the team nowhere. Put me down for Lou
  Anarumo as interim head coach by Christmas. OC The Cowboys. Without Parsons,
  Dallas’ defense won’t be a patch on what it was, Dak Prescott is 32 and
  injury-prone, and though getting receiver George Pickens should improve the
  passing game, do we want to take odds on the first time he melts down on the
  field? DF Rodgers and DK Metcalf. Two volatile weirdos in Pittsburgh. What
  could go wrong? MJ Rodgers and the Steelers are going down in flames. The
  reasoning behind moving on from Russell Wilson and Justin Fields is sound but
  bringing in another has-been, only one who is much, much older at 41, is just
  not going to improve an offense in need of fresh ideas. That said, they will
  be more fun to watch. GS Jones said that his team would improve defensively by
  trading Parsons, but it only ensures that the Cowboys’ 30-year Super Bowl
  drought will continue. AS MVP ... Patrick Mahomes, QB, Kansas City Chiefs. The
  Chiefs won 14 games and made the Super Bowl last season, but it was a down
  year for Mahomes. Behind a fragile offensive line, the Chiefs’ offense turned
  into a three-yard snooze-fest. This season, they’re betting on a pair of debut
  linemen to solve any concerns on the left side. That’s a big ask, but it’s
  doable. Around Mahomes, they’ve added much-needed speed with rookie running
  back Brashard Smith and free-agent cast-off Tyquan Thornton. The Chiefs will
  be more explosive, Mahomes won’t turn the ball over and he will have the
  comeback narrative on his side. OC Lamar Jackson, QB, Baltimore Ravens. Last
  season, Jackson led the NFL in nearly every statistical category that counted,
  and he was better in the postseason than people think. This year, Jackson
  snags his third MVP award, and hands the NFL a bit of comeuppance after his
  snub last time around. DF Jackson has already won two MVPs and enters 2025
  feeling snubbed after Allen got the award in 2024, and frustrated with the
  loss to Allen’s team in the playoffs. Look out, Buffalo. More so, look out
  NFL. MJ Jayden Daniels, QB, Washington Commanders. His ridiculous first season
  is the type of platform hall of fame careers are built from while Washington
  have improved the offensive rookie of the year’s working conditions by beefing
  up the offensive line and receiving crew. Another year working in Kliff
  Kingsbury’s system allows Daniels to confirm he is a legit superstar. GS This
  season, Allen and Jackson will remain in the MVP hunt with challenges from
  Mahomes, Hurts, Daniels, Stroud, Purdy and Jordan Love. But Jackson will prove
  to be the most dominant, earning his third MVP award. AS The best rookie will
  be … Abdul Carter, LB, New York Giants. The answer is obviously Travis Hunter.
  But let’s go with Giants edge-rusher Carter, who will be an immediate
  game-breaker. Pair him with Dexter Lawrence and Brian Burns, and the Giants
  quietly have one of the most fearsome pass-rushes in the league. Parsons had
  13 sacks as a rookie. Carter could flirt with that number. OC Cam Ward, QB,
  Tennessee Titans. Last season, Ward was the NCAA’s best quarterback throwing
  from the pocket, which you don’t expect when you watch his plays outside
  structure. As was the case for Daniels last season, Ward will find that this
  transfers very well to the NFL, and he has better targets than one might
  expect for a guy taking over a 3-14 team. DF Ashton Jeanty, RB, Las Vegas
  Raiders. From vision to explosiveness, Jeanty has all the tools to transform a
  franchise desperately in need of a lightning bolt. Running backs that go in
  the top half of the first round usually excel. See Jahmyr Gibbs and Bijan
  Robinson in 2023. MJ Carter. The hype has him breaking the rookie sack record
  with 15. If he even gets close to that mark the defensive rookie of the year
  award is heading to the Giants. Jared Verse only needed 4.5 sacks to take it
  last season. GS Raiders head coach Pete Carroll and offensive coordinator Chip
  Kelly are known for emphasizing the run, and Jeanty will be the centerpiece of
  their offense. Hunter will challenge for rookie of the year, but Jeanty’s high
  total yards from scrimmage will give him the edge. AS AFC East champ The
  Patriots are improving, but the Bills will waltz through the division. They
  still have the most balanced offense in the league and Allen at quarterback.
  There are plenty of questions about the Bills’ defense, but they won’t be
  answered until the postseason. OC I have some serious concerns about Buffalo’s
  defense, and the Patriots should be an upcoming force, but there will be just
  enough on the offensive side of the ball for the Bills to win their sixth
  straight AFC East title. DF There is plenty of momentum on offense and
  reinforcements on the Bills defense. Shockingly, there is ongoing drama
  brewing with Tyreek Hill in Miami as players opted not to make him a captain.
  The Jets are trotting out Justin Fields and Drake Maye is still developing for
  the Pats. No one will touch Buffalo. MJ The Bills are the biggest division
  lock across the NFL. A lot of maybes hang over the trio attempting to knock
  one of the most consistent teams off their perch. Allen appears only to be
  growing stronger, and so does his team’s grip on the division. GS Expect the
  AFC East to be more competitive this year as the Dolphins, Jets, and Patriots
  have added significant pieces and are trending in the right direction. Allen
  and the Bills will win the division for the sixth year in a row, but it won’t
  be as easy this time around. AS AFC North champ The Ravens. It’s an indictment
  of the Bengals’ front office that this isn’t closer. Expecting a significant
  turnaround from Cincy’s defense without any major offseason additions is
  nonsensical. Burrow and the offense cannot play any better than last season.
  Most have penciled in a repeat performance, but if the group falls back to
  Earth even slightly, they’ll miss the playoffs again. OC The Ravens have a
  top-tier defense, the ageless Derrick Henry, a receiver group that’s better
  than you think, a great offensive line when healthy, and one Lamar Demeatrice
  Jackson Jr, the best player in the NFL. That will be enough to get them past
  the Rodgers drama in Pittsburgh, and the defense-lite Bengals, no matter how
  well Burrow plays. DF The Ravens rival the Eagles for most stacked roster in
  football, especially with the additions of Jaire Alexander and Malaki Starks
  to the secondary. The division will be competitive thanks to Pittsburgh’s
  defense and Cincinnati’s still-promising offense. MJ The Ravens and Bengals
  offenses are stacked with talent but defense will earn Baltimore another year
  on top. Addressing their pass coverage by bringing in Alexander signals the
  Ravens’ intent to go all the way. GS In the toughest division in the NFL, each
  Sunday will be a battle. The Steelers will remain competitive under Tomlin,
  the Bengals will score a slew of points, and the Ravens are in Super Bowl or
  bust mode. After the final snap, Jackson and the Ravens will be the last team
  standing in the division. AS AFC South champ It’s hard not to get caught up in
  the Jacksonville hype train. No team has a higher floor or ceiling given the
  weapons on offense and the new coaching staff. But the offensive line is too
  leaky and the staff too green to clinch a division race over the Texans. OC
  The Texans offense is solid enough, while their defense is among the league’s
  best, with the NFL’s best cornerback in Derek Stingley Jr, and a host of
  dominant players. DF The Titans should at least be entertaining as they start
  their rebuild with Ward. We can’t say the same about the Colts, who are
  rolling out Daniel Jones as their win-now option. Houston easily win the
  division with their top-five defense, and if new OC Nick Caley can turn Stroud
  back into a superstar, the Texans could toy with the AFC’s best. MJ
  Jacksonville are an exciting prospect with a rookie head coach providing an
  unknown quantity after Doug Pederson’s stale, shambling Jaguars. That said, an
  offensive line now hopefully able to protect Stroud and a brutal defense led
  by Anderson should be good enough to seal the Texans another divisional title.
  GS The Texans will take care of business and possibly surprise a few teams in
  the playoffs. The Jaguars won’t make the playoffs, but will be a fun team to
  watch as Hunter plays both sides of the ball and Trevor Lawrence aims to prove
  that he can live up to the $275m contract extension. AS AFC West champ This
  could be the year the Chiefs’ grip on the division falls. The Broncos are
  loaded on both sides of the ball. They have the best four-man pass-rush in the
  NFL and the league’s best blitz designer. Nix doesn’t need to take a major
  leap forward for Denver to be a force. Still, it’s hard to bet against the
  Mahomes-Reid axis. OC The Broncos last won the AFC West in 2015, when they
  also won the Super Bowl with the NFL’s best defense. The 2025 Broncos also
  have the NFL’s best defense, and the Nix/Payton relationship will bear
  unexpected dividends for the offense. DF Payton reminded everyone what a good
  coach he is. Jim Harbaugh’s Chargers are teeming with potential, though the
  Rashawn Slater season-ending injury was a massive loss. Both have playoff
  potential. But it’s the Chiefs until it ain’t. Kansas City’s new offensive
  line will need to perform but reviews for rookie tackle Josh Simmons have been
  mostly good. MJ The Chiefs should come out on top. But the Broncos are
  starving for success, have a league-leading defense and a coach who can match
  Reid. GS The Chiefs will win the AFC West for the 10th year in a row, but
  they’ll face more challenges from division foes. The Payton-led Broncos were
  one of only three teams to defeat the Chiefs last year. Harbaugh’s Chargers
  will also take aim at KC as they fight for a playoff slot. Carroll will lead
  the Raiders’ rebuilding efforts and guide young talent such as All-Pro tight
  end Brock Bowers and Jeanty. AS NFC East champ The defending Super Bowl champs
  steamrolled through the playoffs last season, but it’s easy to forget they
  were not a juggernaut for all of 2024. The Eagles’ defense dominated from the
  off, but the offense lacked rhythm, relying on a boom-or-bust style that hit
  in the postseason. If new offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo can help bring
  some precision to Hurts’ game, Philly will be even better this year. OC The
  Eagles have enough to hold off the Commanders, mostly on defense (when you
  have Vic Fangio as your defensive coordinator, that’s an edge in and of
  itself). Even if Saquon Barkley regresses from one of the best running back
  seasons ever, there’s still enough on the ball for the defending champs. DF Is
  there a more foolproof roster in the NFL than the Eagles? Daniels’s presence
  automatically makes Washington a threat. The less said about Dallas and New
  York the better. MJ The Eagles will be wary as the Commanders have
  strengthened the offense around Daniels, but the Super Bowl champions’
  stronger defense should edge the division. GS The Eagles will win back-to-back
  division titles as they hold off the surging Commanders. Daniels will build on
  his impressive rookie of the year campaign, but the Commanders’ defensive
  weaknesses will be the key reason they fail to take over the division. The
  Cowboys are coping with Jones’s decision to trade Parsons, and the Giants are
  no longer the most important team in New York. AS NFC North champ The Packers
  have everything a contender needs. They can run the ball. They can create
  chunk plays in the passing game. Their secondary force turnovers, even if they
  gag up big plays. Oh, and they have excellent coaching and a top-tier
  quarterback. With the addition of Parsons, they will have a potent pass-rush.
  OC The Lions are dealing with losing offensive coordinator Johnson and
  defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn. The Vikings need to insert McCarthy,
  essentially a rookie, in as quarterback. The Bears have improved but are not
  quite there yet. That leaves the Packers, with a healthy Love, rookie Matthew
  Golden as the No 1 receiver, and Parsons to lead an underrated defense. DF
  This is where the Parsons trade becomes division altering. If he is the same
  player we saw in Dallas, and if Love can stay healthy, the Packers are in
  tremendous shape. Detroit are offensive powerhouse but demons from last
  season’s playoffs and major turnover on the coaching staff will leave them
  just short of the division. Minnesota are also a strong contender if McCarthy
  can step up. Everything else is in place. MJ The frozen north was looking open
  considering that Green Bay, Detroit and Minnesota all made the playoffs last
  season. And all three could do so again. However the Parsons trade has given
  the Packers a huge boost on defense while likely providing a similar bump to
  the team’s confidence. The Lions and Vikings will be fighting for wildcards.
  GS The Packers will hold off the Lions as Parsons anchors Green Bay’s top-five
  defense and Love leads an improved offense. The Vikings will also remain in
  the mix, but Darnold’s absence will be felt. AS NFC South champ The Buccaneers
  have the most well-rounded roster in the division, including the best
  offensive line in the league – when Tristan Wirfs is healthy. Tampa’s ceiling
  is the NFC title game, depending on how well Baker Mayfield gels with his new
  offensive play-caller. OC Buccaneers quarterback Mayfield is coming off his
  best season to date, and has great receivers. Bucky Irving may be the NFL’s
  most underrated running back, the offensive line is led by Wirfs, the best
  offensive lineman in the NFL, and Todd Bowles got enough pass-rush
  reinforcement in the draft and free agency to improve a unit he was unhappy
  with in 2024. DF Mayfield’s phenomenal 2024 may not be an outlier, given the
  Buccaneers’ cadre of elite receivers. Plus, this is another win-by-default
  situation given the rest of the division is in rebuild mode. MJ The Panthers’
  last crown came 10 years ago when they monstered the league with a 15-1
  record. No such dominance will be forthcoming from them or their rivals, none
  of whom have shown any significant signs of improvement in the offseason, so
  this division is there for the taking. If Young can keep his run of form going
  from the backend of last season then the Panthers could spring a huge
  surprise. GS A two-team race between the Buccaneers and Falcons. The Bucs are
  a more balanced team, but the Falcons boast a high-powered offense that will
  make them a threat in the NFC. Similar to last season, the division will be
  decided by one or two games. The Falcons’ offensive firepower will be the
  difference-maker and lead a return to the playoffs for the first time in seven
  years. AS NFC West champ A second bold prediction: the Seahawks will have the
  best defense in the NFL. But Darnold, in a new environment and behind a flaky
  offensive line, will keep them from winning the division. Every year the
  Niners have been healthy under Kyle Shanahan, they’ve made the big dance. But
  they’re neither healthy nor as talented as in previous years, particularly
  along the defensive line. Stafford’s health remains a going concern in LA. The
  Cardinals sneak it with a solid offense and a chaotic defense. OC We’re
  assuming two things here – first, that Stafford’s back issues play into the
  season, and that Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak can make the most
  of Darnold. Seattle may have a top-five defense, and that could be enough in a
  division where too much is uncertain elsewhere. DF With all due respect to
  Garoppolo, the resurgent Rams’ Super Bowl hopes lie on the back of Stafford.
  And that back is healthy enough … for now. The Rams are so well-coached and
  stacked that barring injury, they may coast to the division title. The 49ers
  will sneak into the postseason via wildcard thanks to the NFL’s easiest
  schedule and Robert Saleh back leading the defense. MJ San Francisco endured a
  feature length nightmare in 2024. That cursed 6-11 season puts head coach Mike
  Shanahan under pressure to deliver a deep playoff run or move on. And while
  the Rams and Cardinals are going to provide very stiff competition, the 49ers
  have a point to prove. GS Purdy is a sleeper MVP candidate, and the return of
  Saleh as defensive coordinator brings the 49ers back to Super Bowl form. The
  Rams stand as the biggest hurdle for San Francisco, but the health and age of
  Stafford could be a major concern as the season unfolds. AS AFC wildcard teams
  Broncos, Bengals, Jaguars. OC Chiefs, Bengals, Chargers. DF Broncos, Bengals,
  Chargers. MJ Chiefs, Bengals, Jaguars. GS Steelers, Chargers, Broncos. AS NFC
  wildcard teams Seahawks, Lions, Vikings. OC Rams, Lions, Commanders. DF Lions,
  Commanders, 49ers. MJ Commanders, Lions, Cardinals. GS Commanders, Lions,
  Buccaneers. AS AFC championship game Ravens over Bills. OC Broncos over
  Ravens. DF Bills over Ravens. MJ Ravens over Bills. GS Ravens over Chiefs. AS
  NFC championship game Packers over Eagles. OC Packers over Eagles. DF Eagles
  over Lions. MJ Lions over Commanders. GS Eagles over Packers. AS Super Bowl LX
  Ravens over Packers. It’s now or never for this version of the Ravens. The
  Ravens have finished fifth and seventh all-time in DVOA over the past two
  seasons. Jackson’s brilliance alone keeps them in contention; now, he finally
  has his best supporting cast. Coaching snafus hamstrung the Ravens at the
  start of last year, costing them home-field advantage through the playoffs.
  Securing the No 1 seed this year will be essential. If they can overcome
  worries on the interior of their offensive line, Jackson will make – and win –
  the first Super Bowl of his career. OC Broncos over Packers. It’s a Super Bowl
  XXXII rematch, with the resurgent Packers and Parsons falling just short, and
  the Broncos picking up their fourth Lombardi Trophy. As much as the Packers’
  defense should scare Nix and company, Payton will have enough answers, and
  there isn’t a better defense in the NFL than Denver’s. DF Eagles over Bills.
  Buffalo will make it to the promised land in their seventh-straight playoff
  appearance. Most of the Super Bowl week hoopla will be focused on Allen and
  the special nature of Bills fans. All very heartwarming until the reality of
  the game reminds the world that the Eagles are the kings of roster-building.
  Simply put, the Eagles have the same roster as last year. It was the best
  then, and best now. This squad will also have the advantage of not being
  overwhelmed by the unique nature of the Super Bowl. MJ Ravens over Lions. The
  key for the Ravens is depth. For instance, Baltimore picked Mike Green, a pass
  rusher who would start for most teams, in the first round of the 2024 draft.
  He is conceivably their fourth-best option for getting to the QB this year. If
  and when the injury bug bites they can ride out the storm with depth like this
  across the board and lift the Lombardi. GS Eagles over Ravens. The Super Bowl
  has become the Kansas City Chiefs’ invitational in recent years. It’s not wise
  to go against the majestic Mahomes, but this time around, Jackson and the
  Ravens will finally get over the AFC Championship hump. In the NFC, the Eagles
  will take out the feisty Packers in a quest to win back-to-back titles. A
  showdown between Jackson and Hurts will feature theatrics as two of the
  league’s most exciting quarterbacks perform under the big lights. After three
  quarters of back-and-forth scoring, the game will be decided by which offense
  controls the ball in the final two minutes. Expect the more experienced Eagles
  to find a way to score in the waning moments to secure Super Bowl LX. AS

This will be the year of … The Micah Parsons revenge tour. Ignore the nonsense coming out of Dallas. Jerry Jones’s claim that Parsons hurt the Cowboys’ run defense is laughable. So is the idea that Parsons’ ego was an issue. NFL history is filled with game-breaking pass-rushers with big egos or, umm, personality quirks. What matters is production, and Parsons is a one-of-a-kind pass-rushing force, capable of detonating the pocket from any alignment. No defender has generated more pressures since Parsons entered the league. With him on the field, the Cowboys had the No 1 defense in the league; when he was off the field, they fell to the second-worst unit in the league. If he needed any extra motivation, the Cowboys booting him on the way out should provide it. OC The running quarterback. Not the quarterback who can get outside the pocket with mobility, but the quarterback who is a legitimate running threat. In pro football history, including the postseason, there have been eight seasons in which a quarterback ran for more than a 1,000 yards in a season. Two of those examples happened in 2024 – Lamar Jackson’s 1,035 yards, and Jayden Daniels’ 1,026. Add in QBs like Josh Allen, Jalen Hurts and Kyler Murray, and the league’s designed quarterback run concepts could be amplified in 2025. DF You do not trade away star edge-rushers in their prime. Jones’s idiotic decision to trade Parsons to Green Bay is set to be franchise-altering for both teams. How it plays out for both sides will be the talk of the league. MJ This is the beginning of the end. First-down technology is here, the chain gang merely standing idle to measure the distance in case their robot overlords fail. In 30 years, when we are watching a AI infused VR simulation of a simulation of the NFL, you will see the folly of all this. Bring back Gene Steratore’s magic paper, before it’s too late! GS An exciting youth movement at quarterback. Six quarterbacks (Daniels, Michael Penix Jr, CJ Stroud, Brock Purdy, Bo Nix and JJ McCarthy) 25 or under will start for teams that are likely to be in playoff contention. Daniels, Stroud, and Purdy could become MVP candidates and lead their teams deep into the postseason. The 25-and-under quarterbacks whose teams are projected to miss the playoffs (Cam Ward, Bryce Young, and Caleb Williams) will also draw national attention. AS Best team that won’t make the playoffs … Daniels is a phenom. But the Commanders are relying on ageing and declining stars to fill out key positions. Despite having a 24-year-old quarterback, the Commanders have the oldest roster since 2012. Maybe pairing that veteran savvy with Daniels’ magic will click. More likely, injuries will bite, the team’s pass-rush will remain sub-par, and they will fall away before January. OC Yes, the Vikings managed a 14-3 regular-season record in the brutal NFC North last year, but they did on the back of Sam Darnold’s unpredictably great season … until it wasn’t. I don’t have the same faith in McCarthy to make that kind of leap, even with a fine head coach, Kevin O’Connell, in his corner. DF Ben Johnson had options, and he chose Chicago, seemingly with a plan to develop Williams. The Bears used their first three picks this year on offensive players. Look for Chicago to start gelling as the season goes on, before the brutal trifecta of the Packers, 49ers, and Lions in the Bears’ final three games sees them fall just short of the postseason. MJ The Rams would walk into the postseason if everything goes their way. However a 37-year-old Matthew Stafford dealing with a herniated disc feels like a case of when, not if, he is replaced by Jimmy Garoppolo. The underpowered backup quarterback will leave his team short. GS Joe Burrow and Ja’Marr Chase, leading one of the NFL’s most explosive offenses, will solidify themselves as the league’s top quarterback-wide receiver duo. However, that will not be enough to overcome deficiencies on defense. Al Golden has implemented a new defensive scheme, but without a drastic overhaul, the Bengals will fall short of the playoffs again. AS The most underrated team this year is … Last season ended with a playoff win, but it still felt underwhelming thanks to an offensive line that hung Stroud out to dry. That’s been patched, if not fixed. It’s the defense, though, that will drag the Texans deep into the postseason. They have gamechanging players at all three levels. OC The Bears may not win a ton of games in the loaded NFC North, but Johnson will make the most of Williams in the QB’s second season, and new defensive coordinator Dennis Allen could reform the Monsters of the Midway. Not a playoff team in 2025, but an opponent nobody will want to face. DF The Broncos are probably underdiscussed rather than underrated. Nix was overshadowed by Daniels in the rookie of the year conversation, not to mention Patrick Mahomes in his own division. Sean Payton has been overshadowed by Andy Reid and Jim Harbaugh. Yet Payton reminded everyone that he is a coaching wizard, turning Nix into a force and making the playoffs. With last season’s Defensive Player of the Year, stud corner Patrick Surtain II, leading an elite defense, the Broncos have the tools to make a run. MJ If Murray and Marvin Harrison Jr find some chemistry then the Cardinals could make waves in the playoffs. They should have one of the meanest defensive fronts in the NFL after picking up pass rusher Josh Sweat, so if the offense can step up they have great potential. GS Stroud will be a top 10 quarterback with help from offensive weapons Nico Collins, Nick Chubb, and rookie Jayden Higgins. Defensively, the Texans will cause havoc for opposing quarterbacks, with edge rushers Will Anderson Jr and Danielle Hunter leading the way. AS One bold prediction … Rodgers will end his career on the bench. It’s all kumbaya in Pittsburgh for now. But once the games start, the Rodgers of New York will turn up: skittish in the pocket, inaccurate, unable to create on the fly. If the Steelers stumble, Tomlin will need to pivot to rookie sixth-rounder Will Howard. OC Mike Tomlin’s Steelers tenure will come to an end. The Rodgers experiment looks like a flameout for all kinds of reasons, and while I think it will be more about Tomlin’s own frustration than the franchise’s desire to move on, there’s always that one shocking coaching move ... DF Bill Belichick returns to the NFL … to coach the Dolphins. Mike McDaniel’s struggles from last season look likely to continue as Belichick’s might after a rather inauspicious start with the Tar Heels. Surely a very late career move to sunny Florida makes sense? He certainly knows the division quite well. GS Saquon Barkley will again rush for over 2,000 yards, this time breaking Eric Dickerson’s record of 2,105. Go big or go home, right? The record falls this season as the Eagles continue Barkley’s astronomical workload behind that stellar offensive line. Why tinker with success as long as Barkley’s body can handle it? MJ Shedeur Sanders will end the season as QB 1 for the Browns. Joe Flacco, 40, will serve as the starter for the first month or two. Dillon Gabriel will get an opportunity to start during midseason. But as the losses pile up, the fans and local media will call for Sanders to get a shot. He will be the sole reason the Browns garner national viewership in December. AS Johnny Manziel disaster waiting to happen department The Browns and Saints will have worse records, but the Colts’ season could spiral faster. GM Chris Ballard and head coach Shane Steichen are already on the hot seat, and they have new owners to please. Starting Daniel Jones over Anthony Richardson is understandable, but it is leading the team nowhere. Put me down for Lou Anarumo as interim head coach by Christmas. OC The Cowboys. Without Parsons, Dallas’ defense won’t be a patch on what it was, Dak Prescott is 32 and injury-prone, and though getting receiver George Pickens should improve the passing game, do we want to take odds on the first time he melts down on the field? DF Rodgers and DK Metcalf. Two volatile weirdos in Pittsburgh. What could go wrong? MJ Rodgers and the Steelers are going down in flames. The reasoning behind moving on from Russell Wilson and Justin Fields is sound but bringing in another has-been, only one who is much, much older at 41, is just not going to improve an offense in need of fresh ideas. That said, they will be more fun to watch. GS Jones said that his team would improve defensively by trading Parsons, but it only ensures that the Cowboys’ 30-year Super Bowl drought will continue. AS MVP ... Patrick Mahomes, QB, Kansas City Chiefs. The Chiefs won 14 games and made the Super Bowl last season, but it was a down year for Mahomes. Behind a fragile offensive line, the Chiefs’ offense turned into a three-yard snooze-fest. This season, they’re betting on a pair of debut linemen to solve any concerns on the left side. That’s a big ask, but it’s doable. Around Mahomes, they’ve added much-needed speed with rookie running back Brashard Smith and free-agent cast-off Tyquan Thornton. The Chiefs will be more explosive, Mahomes won’t turn the ball over and he will have the comeback narrative on his side. OC Lamar Jackson, QB, Baltimore Ravens. Last season, Jackson led the NFL in nearly every statistical category that counted, and he was better in the postseason than people think. This year, Jackson snags his third MVP award, and hands the NFL a bit of comeuppance after his snub last time around. DF Jackson has already won two MVPs and enters 2025 feeling snubbed after Allen got the award in 2024, and frustrated with the loss to Allen’s team in the playoffs. Look out, Buffalo. More so, look out NFL. MJ Jayden Daniels, QB, Washington Commanders. His ridiculous first season is the type of platform hall of fame careers are built from while Washington have improved the offensive rookie of the year’s working conditions by beefing up the offensive line and receiving crew. Another year working in Kliff Kingsbury’s system allows Daniels to confirm he is a legit superstar. GS This season, Allen and Jackson will remain in the MVP hunt with challenges from Mahomes, Hurts, Daniels, Stroud, Purdy and Jordan Love. But Jackson will prove to be the most dominant, earning his third MVP award. AS The best rookie will be … Abdul Carter, LB, New York Giants. The answer is obviously Travis Hunter. But let’s go with Giants edge-rusher Carter, who will be an immediate game-breaker. Pair him with Dexter Lawrence and Brian Burns, and the Giants quietly have one of the most fearsome pass-rushes in the league. Parsons had 13 sacks as a rookie. Carter could flirt with that number. OC Cam Ward, QB, Tennessee Titans. Last season, Ward was the NCAA’s best quarterback throwing from the pocket, which you don’t expect when you watch his plays outside structure. As was the case for Daniels last season, Ward will find that this transfers very well to the NFL, and he has better targets than one might expect for a guy taking over a 3-14 team. DF Ashton Jeanty, RB, Las Vegas Raiders. From vision to explosiveness, Jeanty has all the tools to transform a franchise desperately in need of a lightning bolt. Running backs that go in the top half of the first round usually excel. See Jahmyr Gibbs and Bijan Robinson in 2023. MJ Carter. The hype has him breaking the rookie sack record with 15. If he even gets close to that mark the defensive rookie of the year award is heading to the Giants. Jared Verse only needed 4.5 sacks to take it last season. GS Raiders head coach Pete Carroll and offensive coordinator Chip Kelly are known for emphasizing the run, and Jeanty will be the centerpiece of their offense. Hunter will challenge for rookie of the year, but Jeanty’s high total yards from scrimmage will give him the edge. AS AFC East champ The Patriots are improving, but the Bills will waltz through the division. They still have the most balanced offense in the league and Allen at quarterback. There are plenty of questions about the Bills’ defense, but they won’t be answered until the postseason. OC I have some serious concerns about Buffalo’s defense, and the Patriots should be an upcoming force, but there will be just enough on the offensive side of the ball for the Bills to win their sixth straight AFC East title. DF There is plenty of momentum on offense and reinforcements on the Bills defense. Shockingly, there is ongoing drama brewing with Tyreek Hill in Miami as players opted not to make him a captain. The Jets are trotting out Justin Fields and Drake Maye is still developing for the Pats. No one will touch Buffalo. MJ The Bills are the biggest division lock across the NFL. A lot of maybes hang over the trio attempting to knock one of the most consistent teams off their perch. Allen appears only to be growing stronger, and so does his team’s grip on the division. GS Expect the AFC East to be more competitive this year as the Dolphins, Jets, and Patriots have added significant pieces and are trending in the right direction. Allen and the Bills will win the division for the sixth year in a row, but it won’t be as easy this time around. AS AFC North champ The Ravens. It’s an indictment of the Bengals’ front office that this isn’t closer. Expecting a significant turnaround from Cincy’s defense without any major offseason additions is nonsensical. Burrow and the offense cannot play any better than last season. Most have penciled in a repeat performance, but if the group falls back to Earth even slightly, they’ll miss the playoffs again. OC The Ravens have a top-tier defense, the ageless Derrick Henry, a receiver group that’s better than you think, a great offensive line when healthy, and one Lamar Demeatrice Jackson Jr, the best player in the NFL. That will be enough to get them past the Rodgers drama in Pittsburgh, and the defense-lite Bengals, no matter how well Burrow plays. DF The Ravens rival the Eagles for most stacked roster in football, especially with the additions of Jaire Alexander and Malaki Starks to the secondary. The division will be competitive thanks to Pittsburgh’s defense and Cincinnati’s still-promising offense. MJ The Ravens and Bengals offenses are stacked with talent but defense will earn Baltimore another year on top. Addressing their pass coverage by bringing in Alexander signals the Ravens’ intent to go all the way. GS In the toughest division in the NFL, each Sunday will be a battle. The Steelers will remain competitive under Tomlin, the Bengals will score a slew of points, and the Ravens are in Super Bowl or bust mode. After the final snap, Jackson and the Ravens will be the last team standing in the division. AS AFC South champ It’s hard not to get caught up in the Jacksonville hype train. No team has a higher floor or ceiling given the weapons on offense and the new coaching staff. But the offensive line is too leaky and the staff too green to clinch a division race over the Texans. OC The Texans offense is solid enough, while their defense is among the league’s best, with the NFL’s best cornerback in Derek Stingley Jr, and a host of dominant players. DF The Titans should at least be entertaining as they start their rebuild with Ward. We can’t say the same about the Colts, who are rolling out Daniel Jones as their win-now option. Houston easily win the division with their top-five defense, and if new OC Nick Caley can turn Stroud back into a superstar, the Texans could toy with the AFC’s best. MJ Jacksonville are an exciting prospect with a rookie head coach providing an unknown quantity after Doug Pederson’s stale, shambling Jaguars. That said, an offensive line now hopefully able to protect Stroud and a brutal defense led by Anderson should be good enough to seal the Texans another divisional title. GS The Texans will take care of business and possibly surprise a few teams in the playoffs. The Jaguars won’t make the playoffs, but will be a fun team to watch as Hunter plays both sides of the ball and Trevor Lawrence aims to prove that he can live up to the $275m contract extension. AS AFC West champ This could be the year the Chiefs’ grip on the division falls. The Broncos are loaded on both sides of the ball. They have the best four-man pass-rush in the NFL and the league’s best blitz designer. Nix doesn’t need to take a major leap forward for Denver to be a force. Still, it’s hard to bet against the Mahomes-Reid axis. OC The Broncos last won the AFC West in 2015, when they also won the Super Bowl with the NFL’s best defense. The 2025 Broncos also have the NFL’s best defense, and the Nix/Payton relationship will bear unexpected dividends for the offense. DF Payton reminded everyone what a good coach he is. Jim Harbaugh’s Chargers are teeming with potential, though the Rashawn Slater season-ending injury was a massive loss. Both have playoff potential. But it’s the Chiefs until it ain’t. Kansas City’s new offensive line will need to perform but reviews for rookie tackle Josh Simmons have been mostly good. MJ The Chiefs should come out on top. But the Broncos are starving for success, have a league-leading defense and a coach who can match Reid. GS The Chiefs will win the AFC West for the 10th year in a row, but they’ll face more challenges from division foes. The Payton-led Broncos were one of only three teams to defeat the Chiefs last year. Harbaugh’s Chargers will also take aim at KC as they fight for a playoff slot. Carroll will lead the Raiders’ rebuilding efforts and guide young talent such as All-Pro tight end Brock Bowers and Jeanty. AS NFC East champ The defending Super Bowl champs steamrolled through the playoffs last season, but it’s easy to forget they were not a juggernaut for all of 2024. The Eagles’ defense dominated from the off, but the offense lacked rhythm, relying on a boom-or-bust style that hit in the postseason. If new offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo can help bring some precision to Hurts’ game, Philly will be even better this year. OC The Eagles have enough to hold off the Commanders, mostly on defense (when you have Vic Fangio as your defensive coordinator, that’s an edge in and of itself). Even if Saquon Barkley regresses from one of the best running back seasons ever, there’s still enough on the ball for the defending champs. DF Is there a more foolproof roster in the NFL than the Eagles? Daniels’s presence automatically makes Washington a threat. The less said about Dallas and New York the better. MJ The Eagles will be wary as the Commanders have strengthened the offense around Daniels, but the Super Bowl champions’ stronger defense should edge the division. GS The Eagles will win back-to-back division titles as they hold off the surging Commanders. Daniels will build on his impressive rookie of the year campaign, but the Commanders’ defensive weaknesses will be the key reason they fail to take over the division. The Cowboys are coping with Jones’s decision to trade Parsons, and the Giants are no longer the most important team in New York. AS NFC North champ The Packers have everything a contender needs. They can run the ball. They can create chunk plays in the passing game. Their secondary force turnovers, even if they gag up big plays. Oh, and they have excellent coaching and a top-tier quarterback. With the addition of Parsons, they will have a potent pass-rush. OC The Lions are dealing with losing offensive coordinator Johnson and defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn. The Vikings need to insert McCarthy, essentially a rookie, in as quarterback. The Bears have improved but are not quite there yet. That leaves the Packers, with a healthy Love, rookie Matthew Golden as the No 1 receiver, and Parsons to lead an underrated defense. DF This is where the Parsons trade becomes division altering. If he is the same player we saw in Dallas, and if Love can stay healthy, the Packers are in tremendous shape. Detroit are offensive powerhouse but demons from last season’s playoffs and major turnover on the coaching staff will leave them just short of the division. Minnesota are also a strong contender if McCarthy can step up. Everything else is in place. MJ The frozen north was looking open considering that Green Bay, Detroit and Minnesota all made the playoffs last season. And all three could do so again. However the Parsons trade has given the Packers a huge boost on defense while likely providing a similar bump to the team’s confidence. The Lions and Vikings will be fighting for wildcards. GS The Packers will hold off the Lions as Parsons anchors Green Bay’s top-five defense and Love leads an improved offense. The Vikings will also remain in the mix, but Darnold’s absence will be felt. AS NFC South champ The Buccaneers have the most well-rounded roster in the division, including the best offensive line in the league – when Tristan Wirfs is healthy. Tampa’s ceiling is the NFC title game, depending on how well Baker Mayfield gels with his new offensive play-caller. OC Buccaneers quarterback Mayfield is coming off his best season to date, and has great receivers. Bucky Irving may be the NFL’s most underrated running back, the offensive line is led by Wirfs, the best offensive lineman in the NFL, and Todd Bowles got enough pass-rush reinforcement in the draft and free agency to improve a unit he was unhappy with in 2024. DF Mayfield’s phenomenal 2024 may not be an outlier, given the Buccaneers’ cadre of elite receivers. Plus, this is another win-by-default situation given the rest of the division is in rebuild mode. MJ The Panthers’ last crown came 10 years ago when they monstered the league with a 15-1 record. No such dominance will be forthcoming from them or their rivals, none of whom have shown any significant signs of improvement in the offseason, so this division is there for the taking. If Young can keep his run of form going from the backend of last season then the Panthers could spring a huge surprise. GS A two-team race between the Buccaneers and Falcons. The Bucs are a more balanced team, but the Falcons boast a high-powered offense that will make them a threat in the NFC. Similar to last season, the division will be decided by one or two games. The Falcons’ offensive firepower will be the difference-maker and lead a return to the playoffs for the first time in seven years. AS NFC West champ A second bold prediction: the Seahawks will have the best defense in the NFL. But Darnold, in a new environment and behind a flaky offensive line, will keep them from winning the division. Every year the Niners have been healthy under Kyle Shanahan, they’ve made the big dance. But they’re neither healthy nor as talented as in previous years, particularly along the defensive line. Stafford’s health remains a going concern in LA. The Cardinals sneak it with a solid offense and a chaotic defense. OC We’re assuming two things here – first, that Stafford’s back issues play into the season, and that Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak can make the most of Darnold. Seattle may have a top-five defense, and that could be enough in a division where too much is uncertain elsewhere. DF With all due respect to Garoppolo, the resurgent Rams’ Super Bowl hopes lie on the back of Stafford. And that back is healthy enough … for now. The Rams are so well-coached and stacked that barring injury, they may coast to the division title. The 49ers will sneak into the postseason via wildcard thanks to the NFL’s easiest schedule and Robert Saleh back leading the defense. MJ San Francisco endured a feature length nightmare in 2024. That cursed 6-11 season puts head coach Mike Shanahan under pressure to deliver a deep playoff run or move on. And while the Rams and Cardinals are going to provide very stiff competition, the 49ers have a point to prove. GS Purdy is a sleeper MVP candidate, and the return of Saleh as defensive coordinator brings the 49ers back to Super Bowl form. The Rams stand as the biggest hurdle for San Francisco, but the health and age of Stafford could be a major concern as the season unfolds. AS AFC wildcard teams Broncos, Bengals, Jaguars. OC Chiefs, Bengals, Chargers. DF Broncos, Bengals, Chargers. MJ Chiefs, Bengals, Jaguars. GS Steelers, Chargers, Broncos. AS NFC wildcard teams Seahawks, Lions, Vikings. OC Rams, Lions, Commanders. DF Lions, Commanders, 49ers. MJ Commanders, Lions, Cardinals. GS Commanders, Lions, Buccaneers. AS AFC championship game Ravens over Bills. OC Broncos over Ravens. DF Bills over Ravens. MJ Ravens over Bills. GS Ravens over Chiefs. AS NFC championship game Packers over Eagles. OC Packers over Eagles. DF Eagles over Lions. MJ Lions over Commanders. GS Eagles over Packers. AS Super Bowl LX Ravens over Packers. It’s now or never for this version of the Ravens. The Ravens have finished fifth and seventh all-time in DVOA over the past two seasons. Jackson’s brilliance alone keeps them in contention; now, he finally has his best supporting cast. Coaching snafus hamstrung the Ravens at the start of last year, costing them home-field advantage through the playoffs. Securing the No 1 seed this year will be essential. If they can overcome worries on the interior of their offensive line, Jackson will make – and win – the first Super Bowl of his career. OC Broncos over Packers. It’s a Super Bowl XXXII rematch, with the resurgent Packers and Parsons falling just short, and the Broncos picking up their fourth Lombardi Trophy. As much as the Packers’ defense should scare Nix and company, Payton will have enough answers, and there isn’t a better defense in the NFL than Denver’s. DF Eagles over Bills. Buffalo will make it to the promised land in their seventh-straight playoff appearance. Most of the Super Bowl week hoopla will be focused on Allen and the special nature of Bills fans. All very heartwarming until the reality of the game reminds the world that the Eagles are the kings of roster-building. Simply put, the Eagles have the same roster as last year. It was the best then, and best now. This squad will also have the advantage of not being overwhelmed by the unique nature of the Super Bowl. MJ Ravens over Lions. The key for the Ravens is depth. For instance, Baltimore picked Mike Green, a pass rusher who would start for most teams, in the first round of the 2024 draft. He is conceivably their fourth-best option for getting to the QB this year. If and when the injury bug bites they can ride out the storm with depth like this across the board and lift the Lombardi. GS Eagles over Ravens. The Super Bowl has become the Kansas City Chiefs’ invitational in recent years. It’s not wise to go against the majestic Mahomes, but this time around, Jackson and the Ravens will finally get over the AFC Championship hump. In the NFC, the Eagles will take out the feisty Packers in a quest to win back-to-back titles. A showdown between Jackson and Hurts will feature theatrics as two of the league’s most exciting quarterbacks perform under the big lights. After three quarters of back-and-forth scoring, the game will be decided by which offense controls the ball in the final two minutes. Expect the more experienced Eagles to find a way to score in the waning moments to secure Super Bowl LX. AS
