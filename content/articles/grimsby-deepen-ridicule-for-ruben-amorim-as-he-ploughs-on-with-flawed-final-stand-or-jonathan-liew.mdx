  Further and deeper into the jungle. Taunted by the quivering vines, mocked by
  the rubber trees, bitten and bruised by the asphyxiating vileness of nature.
  Ropes groaning, extras muttering, mud and rock resisting. Rasmus Højlund to
  Napoli, maybe tomorrow, maybe not. Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea, maybe this
  week, maybe next. Grimsby in the evening. Grim faces in the morning. Kobbie
  Mainoo wants out. Carlos Baleba wants in but is not going to go on strike or
  down tools; plenty of time for that once he actually gets to Old Trafford.
  There will be suffering and there will be ridicule, and there is no shortage
  of parasites to feed on your corpse. A man on the radio thinks you’re a
  disgrace. An influencer in a padded chair is shouting “athleticism in
  midfield” into a webcam. Both are earning handy six figures a year for doing
  so. The jungle plays tricks on your senses. It’s full of lies and illusions,
  the stench of disease, the ghosts of dead men, Nicky Butt’s latest take for
  BetMGM, Bruno Fernandes in a reconfigured midfield double‑pivot. Can you still
  tell the difference between the reality and the hallucination, between
  everyday life and the dream? Why haul a steamship across the jungle? Why bring
  the opera to Iquitos? But of course if you have to ask these questions, you
  shall never know the answers. Werner Herzog famously dragged a real 320-tonne
  steamship over the Andes while making his monumental, disaster‑strewn 1982
  film Fitzcarraldo. Reflecting on the deeply troubled production, during which
  several crew members were injured and the shoot was marred by delays and
  screaming rows, Herzog dubbed himself the “Conquistador of the Useless”, a man
  driven by allegorical obsession and against his better judgment to see his
  pointless and morbidly outlandish vision into flesh. Which feels, amid the
  collateral damage and human wreckage, like a pretty on-the-nose description of
  Ruben Amorim right now. No special effects, no scale models, no shortcuts;
  just a fever of warped dreams and misshapen feelings projected at operatic
  pitch. Amorim will outperform you. He will outrubber you. He will outnumber
  you all over the pitch. He wants his opera house in the jungle and will
  ultimately get his opera house in the jungle. But first, he’s got to shift
  Antony and Jadon Sancho and squeeze Amad Diallo into a slightly awkward right
  wing-back role. Of course the tickling feather of ridicule has now come for
  Amorim himself. He’s a mad ideologue, an expensive folly, stubborn and
  inflexible, wedded to his doomed hulk of a 3-4-3 system, the last man on earth
  unable to clock that it isn’t working. He keeps saying and doing stupid
  things. He plays with a little magnetic tactics board. He crouches on the
  touchline and wears trainers, which is not inherently ludicrous, but we can
  work with it for now. This has basically become one long endless bit, the gag
  that keeps giving, an entire arm of the football content industry deeply
  embedded in the idea of Manchester United being bad at football forever.
  Against which it makes little difference to point out that United have quietly
  stopped doing all the things for which they were lampooned in the past: not
  having a defined identity, not having a footballing structure, throwing huge
  sums at ageing players on huge contracts. Whatever the problems were, they
  must now be the opposite: too much identity, too much structure, not enough
  proven quality. Nor does it help to explain that Amorim’s 3-4-3 is not some
  stone tablet but merely the framework into which his tactical flexibility is
  built: allowing for a low block or an aggressive high press, short possession
  football or long diagonals, stuffing the centre or loading the flanks. Or that
  10 months and two windows is really very little time to undo expensive
  mistakes made years before he arrived. Or that Amorim’s United have actually
  looked sporadically dangerous in their two league games this season. The fine
  details, after all, are largely irrelevant. What matters is the cloak of
  thorns, the constant needling, those sweet rageful feelings. The 1-1 draw with
  Fulham – a very good performance marred by a missed penalty and ultimately
  hobbled by neuroses and self-doubt – was a kind of case study in seeing what
  you wanted to see. Two games in and already the takes are being thrown out of
  the pram. Ditch Amorim now. Ditch the 3-4-3. And then what? Another rebuild?
  Another period of crude adaptation, another coach forced like Erik ten Hag to
  compromise and lose a piece of himself in the process? Another bouquet of
  fresh-cut dreams? Well, yes. This is what the United industrial complex has
  always demanded: more turmoil, more upheaval, more bloated failure and waste
  matter for the detritivores of the MUFC cinematic universe to consume. United
  can never simply be allowed to breathe, to brood, to be OK at football for a
  bit. Too much satire in this body politic; too much traffic to drive. We went
  into football media to tell the untold stories, find the hidden angles, and
  ended up surrendering to the numbers and leaning into United content in
  perpetuity. It’s not just the Glazer family that has been bleeding the club
  dry all these years. The institutional decay is basically terminal at this
  point; the long-term finances abject, the ownership malignant, the happiness
  of today mortgaged against the returns of tomorrow and the cultural lucre of
  yesterday. The ridicule is endemic. The roof is quite literally falling in.
  The fanbase, by small degrees, has been emotionally disengaging for the past
  decade. What remains? Who in their right mind can still believe in this? In
  which light, amid which maelstrom, Amorim’s flawed and final stand begins to
  take on a faintly devotional quality. Perhaps he may even be the last real
  thing at United, the only person still taking this project at face value, the
  only one treating this football club like a football club rather than an
  asset, a cash machine, an advertising space, a content source, a punchline, a
  theatre of the absurd. The jungle devours. The vines reclaim. The river always
  wins. The terrain is unfathomably hostile and every bright new thing must
  ultimately be strangled. Even the idea of imposing discipline and order on
  this rampant chaos feels like arch futility, a kind of category madness. Yet
  perhaps the futility is the point, a silken sporting vision to set against
  United’s hard corporate edges, a blanket of hallucinations that feels more
  real than the real. This is his mountain, his jungle, his steamship. And no
  opera house ever built itself.
