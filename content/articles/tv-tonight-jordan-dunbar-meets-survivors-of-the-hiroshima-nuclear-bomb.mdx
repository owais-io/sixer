  What Happened at Hiroshima 8.30pm, BBC One Eighty years after the atomic bomb
  attack, a flame burns in the middle of Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park in Japan.
  It will only go out when all nuclear weapons are destroyed, but we are moving
  further and further away from that point. Jordan Dunbar meets survivors and
  campaigners who share how horrified they are about the state of the nuclear
  threat today. It is moving and pressing, but limited to just half an hour.
  Hollie Richardson Panorama: Why I Joined a Riot 8pm, BBC One It has been a
  year since the Southport attacks – in which three girls were killed – and the
  national riots that followed. Darragh MacIntyre, who reported on those events,
  returns to speak with three people who took part, as well as Ibrahim Hussein,
  the imam of Southport mosque. HR Michael Mosley: Secrets of the Superagers
  8pm, Channel 4 In the last series he recorded before his death, Michael Mosley
  – TV’s favourite doctor – meets people keeping healthier for longer. Is gentle
  tai chi more beneficial than vigorous cardio? And can an 86-year-old really
  cycle his way to getting the immune system of a twentysomething? The doc finds
  the right people to ask. HR Human 9pm, BBC Two During one of the coldest eras
  in history, humans entered the Americas – “a world that was magical, pristine
  and primal”, as Ella Al-Shamahi discovers. Here they faced colossal predators
  including 12ft prehistoric bears (“the stuff that nightmares are made of”).
  Yet as the climate changed, they adapted through innovation, eventually
  planting the seeds of farming – and civilisation. Ali Catterall Chloe Ayling:
  My Unbelievable Kidnapping 9pm, BBC Three In July 2017, 20-year-old model
  Chloe Ayling was lured from the UK to Milan for a photoshoot that became a
  six-day abduction ordeal. In this expansive new three-parter, Ayling reflects
  on her traumatic experience and the hostile reactions she subsequently
  received on social media. Graeme Virtue The Gilded Age 9pm, Sky Atlantic
  Julian Fellowes’s Yankee Downton is now on its third season, and is belatedly
  becoming quite the treat. This week, Larry is back from his business trip in
  Arizona but his father, George, has some bad news for the Russell scion. And
  just who is spilling the tea about the family to the press? Hannah J Davies
