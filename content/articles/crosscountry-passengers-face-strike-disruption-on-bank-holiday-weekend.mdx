  Rail passengers have been warned that a strike by rail workers could disrupt
  services on the bank holiday weekend when transport networks are expected to
  be packed with holidaymakers. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport
  (RMT) union at the operator CrossCountry are going on strike on Saturday 23
  August and bank holiday Monday over pay and conditions. The company, whose
  network is centred around Birmingham and runs to cities across Great Britain
  from Aberdeen in the north to Cornwall in the south, said it would offer a
  reduced timetable over the weekend with no services on Saturday and
  cancellations expected across all routes on Sunday. Visit England has reported
  that more than 11 million Britons are planning an overnight trip in the UK
  over the bank holiday break in England and Wales, which would mark an increase
  on the same weekend a year earlier. CrossCountry is advising passengers not to
  travel on Saturday but to travel instead on either side of the weekend, or to
  claim a full refund. The train operator said a “very limited” service would
  operate on Monday between 8am and 6pm, and advised passengers to check their
  journeys before departing. Further journey details will be available on
  CrossCountry’s website in the coming days but it said there would be no
  service between Birmingham, Reading and the south coast, and no service
  between Leicester, Cambridge and Stansted airport. Only very limited services
  will run to south-west England and north of York. Planned engineering work in
  the West Midlands is also expected to have an impact on the CrossCountry
  services that are running, meaning some journeys will take longer. Shiona
  Rolfe, the managing director of CrossCountry, which is owned by Arriva UK
  Trains, said: “It is hugely disappointing to not operate any services on
  Saturday, knowing the inevitable disruption to many of our passengers’
  journeys over the bank holiday weekend. We are committed to reaching an
  agreement with the RMT and remain available to continue talks.” An RMT
  spokesperson said: “Our members have voted strongly in favour of industrial
  action and we are seeking further talks with management to bring about a
  negotiated settlement.” In June, RMT members at CrossCountry began an overtime
  ban and also started to refuse to work on rest days, as they accused the
  company of declining to negotiate over increased pay for overtime and rest-day
  working, which it said went against previously agreed commitments. The coach
  operator National Express said it was increasing capacity on its intercity
  services over the bank holiday weekend in response to strike action, adding
  9,000 extra seats on routes including Birmingham, Cardiff, London, Leeds,
  Manchester and Nottingham. Motorists have been warned they could face long
  delays on the roads over the weekend, when 18m car journeys are expected to
  take place, while the RAC has advised travellers to set off as early as
  possible. The heaviest congestion is expected in the south-east and south-west
  of England, while delays are expected on the M20 in Kent for drivers crossing
  the Channel from Dover or Folkestone.
