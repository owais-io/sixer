  US immigration agents will have access to one of the world’s most
  sophisticated hacking tools after a decision by the Trump administration to
  move ahead with a contract with Paragon Solutions, a company founded in Israel
  which makes spyware that can be used to hack into any mobile phone – including
  encrypted applications. The Department of Homeland Security first entered into
  a contract with Paragon, now owned by a US firm, in late 2024, under the Biden
  administration. But the $2m contract was put on hold pending a compliance
  review to make sure it adhered to an executive order that restricts the US
  government’s use of spyware, Wired reported at the time. That pause has now
  been lifted, according to public procurement documents, which lists the US
  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) as the contracting agency. It means
  that one of the most powerful stealth cyberweapons ever created – which was
  produced outside the US – is now in the hands of an agency that has repeatedly
  been accused by civil and human rights groups of violating people’s due
  process rights. The story was first reported by journalist Jack Poulson on his
  All-Source Intelligence Substack newsletter. Neither Paragon nor Ice
  immediately responded to a request for comment. When it is successfully
  deployed against a target, the hacking software – called Graphite – can hack
  into any phone. By essentially taking control of the mobile phone, the user –
  in this case, Ice – can not only track an individual’s whereabouts, read their
  messages, look at their photographs, but it can also open and read information
  held on encrypted applications, like WhatsApp or Signal. Spyware like Graphite
  can also be used as a listening device, through the manipulation of the
  phone’s recorder. An executive order signed by the Biden administration sought
  to establish some guardrails around the US government’s use of spyware. It
  said that the US “shall not make operational use of commercial spyware that
  poses significant counterintelligence or security risks to the United States
  government or significant risks of improper use by a foreign government or
  foreign person”. The Biden administration also took the extraordinary step of
  placing one of Paragon’s rival spyware makers, NSO Group, on a commerce
  department blacklist, saying the company had knowingly supplied foreign
  governments to “maliciously target” the phones of dissidents, human rights
  activists and journalists. Paragon has sought to differentiate itself from NSO
  Group. It has said that, unlike NSO – which previously sold its spyware to
  Saudi Arabia and other regimes – that it only does business with democracies.
  It has also said it has a no tolerance policy and will cut off government
  clients who use the spyware to target members of civil society, like
  journalists. Paragon also refuses to disclose who its clients are and has said
  it does not have insight into how its clients use the technology against
  targets. Spyware makers like Paragon and NSO have said their products are
  intended to be used to prevent crime and terrorist attacks. But both companies
  software has been used in the past to target innocent people, including
  individuals who have been perceived to be government enemies. John
  Scott-Railton, a senior research at the Citizen Lab at the University of
  Toronto, who is one of the world’s leading experts on cases in which spyware
  like Graphite has been abused by governments, said in a statement that such
  tools “were designed for dictatorships, not democracies built on liberty and
  protection of individual rights”. “Invasive, secret hacking power is
  corrupting. That’s why there’s a growing a pile of spyware scandals in
  democracies, including with Paragon’s Graphite,” he said, referring to a
  controversy in Italy that erupted last last year. Paragon broke off its ties
  to Italy after it was revealed that 90 people, including journalists and
  members of civil society, in two dozen countries, had been targeted with the
  spyware. The individuals who were targeted by the Italian government included
  human rights activists who have been critical of Italy’s dealings with Libya.
  Several journalists were also targeted, though it is still unclear who ordered
  those hacking attacks. The US government has in the past resisted using
  spyware technology made outside the US because of concerns that any company
  that sells technology to multiple government agencies around the world
  represents a potential security risk. “As long as the same mercenary spyware
  tech is going to multiple governments, there is a baked-in counterintelligence
  risk. Since all of them now know what secret surveillance tech the US is
  using, and would have special insights on how to detect it and track what the
  US is doing with it,” Scott-Railton said. “Short of Paragon cancelling all
  foreign contracts, I’m not sure how this goes away.”
