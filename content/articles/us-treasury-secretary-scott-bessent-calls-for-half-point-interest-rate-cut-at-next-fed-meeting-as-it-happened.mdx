  With that, we’re wrapping up for the day. Thank you for reading. We’ll be back
  tomorrow. Take care! – JK Bessent also said that the unprecedented
  revenue-sharing agreement struck by the White House with US chipmakers Nvidia
  and AMD could be rolled out to other industries. Under pressure from Donald
  Trump, Nvidia and AMD agreed to give the US government 15% of their Chinese
  chip sales in exchange for export licences. Bessent told Bloomberg TV today: I
  think we could see it in other industries over time. I think right now this is
  unique, but now that we have the model and the beta test why not expand it? US
  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has reiterated his call for a half-point
  interest rate reduction at the Federal Reserve’s next meeting in September,
  and called for a series of rate cuts. His comments come after data showed
  inflation held steady at 2.7% in July. He said the central bank’s benchmark
  ought to be at least 1.5 percentage points lower than it is now. Bessent said
  in a television interview on Bloomberg Surveillance today: I think we could go
  into a series of rate cuts here, starting with a 50 basis point rate cut in
  September. f you look at any model [it suggests that] we should probably be
  150, 175 basis points lower. Fed policymakers kept their benchmark at a target
  range of 4.25% to 4.5% at their last policy meeting on 30 July. Bessent
  reiterated his view that they might have cut rates in June and July, had
  officials been aware of the revised data on the labor market that were
  released two days. I suspect we could have had rate cuts in June and July.
  Bessent said, referring to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on
  1 August that downwardly revised payroll gains in May and June by 258,000. The
  NHS landlord Assura is to be taken over by another UK healthcare investor in a
  £1.8bn deal after securing backing from shareholders, while a rival offer from
  US private equity firm KKR has lapsed. Primary Health Properties said on
  Tuesday it had secured acceptances for 62.9% of Assura shares for its bid. It
  is thought that KKR and its investment partner Stonepeak, both based in New
  York, will sell their 5% stake into the offer. PHP won backing from Assura’s
  board in June for its cash and shares offer worth £1.79bn at the time, after a
  lengthy bidding war with KKR. Both PHP and Assura invest in buildings housing
  GP practices, while Assura also bought a portfolio of private UK hospitals
  worth £500m last year. including Cancer Centre London and the Edgbaston
  hospital in Birmingham. Assura has been buying healthcare properties at a time
  when the NHS is under immense pressure to reduce long waiting times for
  operations and other treatments, and demand for private care has increased.
  The pound has hit its highest level in three weeks against the dollar, as
  investors are betting that US interest rates will fall more quickly than UK
  ones, following a steady US inflation figure. Headline US inflation stayed at
  2.7% in July versus forecasts of an uptick, while a core measure that excludes
  volatile items such as energy and food rose to 3.1%, reflecting the increased
  cost of some goods and services, as new trade tariffs kicked in. But markets
  are focusing on the more benign aspects of the inflation data and in any case,
  the Federal Reserve will be watching another measure, the personal consumption
  expenditures index, closely, which is out of 29 August. US treasury secretary
  Scott Bessent has upped the ante, calling for a half-point rate cut at the
  Fed’s next meeting on 16-17 September. Sterling has gained more than 8%
  against the dollar this year, and was last 0.5% higher at $1.3572. It has
  risen by nearly 2.4% in August against the greenback, and is on track for its
  biggest monthly increase since April (if maintained). The Bank of England cut
  interest rates last week but the next move might only come in November. While
  the UK labour market is cooling, with vacancies falling, the central bank has
  has voiced concerns over rising food prices, which could push inflation to 4%.
  Global oil supply will rise faster than expected this year and next as members
  of the oil cartel Opec and allies ramp up output, while countries outside the
  group are also pumping more, according to the International Energy Agency. The
  Paris-based group estimates that supply will by 2.5m barrels per day (bpd) in
  2025, up from its previous forecast of 2.1m bpd, and by a further 1.9m barrels
  next year. Opec+ – the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries,
  along with Russia and other allies – is adding more crude to the market, as
  the group decided to unwind its most recent output cuts more quickly than
  planned. This, along with concerns that Donald Trump’s tariffs could disrupt
  the world economy, has been a drag on oil this year. Oil prices extended
  losses after the report was published. Brent crude, the global benchmark, fell
  by 0.5% to $65.79 a barrel Supply is rising far faster than demand in the
  IEA’s view. It expects world oil demand to rise by 680,000 bpd this year and
  700,000 bpd next year, both 20,000 bpd lower than its previous forecast. The
  agency said in its monthly report: The latest data show lacklustre demand
  across the major economies and, with consumer confidence still depressed, a
  sharp rebound appears remote. Oil market balances look ever more bloated. OPEC
  on Tuesday maintained its forecast for demand to rise by 1.29m bpd this year -
  almost double the IEA figure. The big four accountancy firm PwC has
  intensified the way it tracks how often its UK employees come into the office
  by monitoring swipes of work passes and connections to wifi, prompting
  concerns among staff. Bosses use a dashboard to record attendance and check
  whether workers are adhering to the company policy that requires them to spend
  three days a week, or 60% of their time, with clients or in the office. The
  panel shows staff as “amber” if they fall below the 60% threshold, while
  workers show as “red” if they drop below 40%. The dashboard was first
  available for use by supervisors in April, while the office attendance data
  can reportedly be viewed by business unit leaders, as well as PwC’s chief
  financial, administrative and people officers. Employees are also able to
  access their own data. A Chinese firm is reportedly a leading contender to buy
  Thames Water if the heavily indebted company collapses in coming weeks. Hong
  Kong’s CKI, which invests in power and other utility companies in the UK, is
  among those lining up to acquire the water and sewerage supplier if it enters
  a special administration regime (SAR), according to the Times. It has
  reportedly said it would be prepared to operate under tougher penalties for
  environmental breaches than Thames’s class A creditors, who have put together
  their own purchase bid. The creditor group has said the company cannot afford
  to operate with an expected £1bn of fines coming down the track, which are
  levied by the regulator for breaches such as illegally dumping sewage. In May,
  Thames was hit with a record £104m fine over environmental breaches involving
  sewage spills. The UK’s Chartered Trading Standards Institute is issuing an
  urgent warning about the growing number of counterfeit “Labubu” dolls being
  sold in the UK. The plush toys that have gone viral on social media – quirky
  fang-toothed “monster elf” figures made popular by Chinese toymaker Pop Mart –
  have become a global collector’s craze. This has triggered a surge in fakes,
  many being sold by third-party sellers on online marketplaces and in local
  shops that are breaking the law. Trading Standards teams have seized thousands
  of unsafe counterfeit Labubu dolls in recent weeks. In just one month, more
  than 2,000 were confiscated from 13 retailers in North Tyneside, with more
  found in Greater Manchester, Humberside, North Somerset, and Scotland. Many of
  these items were discovered after tip-offs from concerned parents. Counterfeit
  Labubu dolls are poorly made and unsafe. Many contain small, detachable parts
  such as eyes, hands, and feet, which present a serious choking hazard to young
  children. Loose stitching and exposed stuffing increase the risk of
  suffocation. These fakes often breach the UK’s toys safety regulations,
  lacking CE or UKCA safety markings, importer details, and required safety
  warnings. They may also contain toxic substances such as lead, harmful dyes,
  or banned plasticisers. Genuine Labubu dolls have a distinctive elf-like
  design and include authenticity features such as a holographic POP MART
  sticker, a scannable QR code linking to the official Pop Mart website, and on
  newer editions a subtle UV stamp on one foot. Fakes can be spotted via their
  overly vibrant colours and an incorrect teeth count, with authentic Labubus
  having nine. Kerry Nicol, external affairs manager at CTSI, said: These dolls
  are fast becoming the latest must have craze, which is being amplified by
  social media influencers promoting and showcasing ‘unboxing’ of the products
  on platforms such as TikTok and Instagram. Supply and demand means that
  legitimate Labubu dolls are almost impossible to find. Parents understandably
  want to be able to get their hands on these toys for their children and
  rightly expect the toys they buy to be safe, but dangerous counterfeits are
  finding their way into the market. These fake products bypass the rigorous
  safety checks and compliance requirements the law demands, meaning they could
  contain choking hazards, toxic materials, or faulty components that put
  children at serious risk. Everyone involved in the supply chain – from
  manufacturers and fulfilment houses to sellers and marketplaces should have a
  role to play in ensuring unsafe toys never reach the hands of children. The
  Treasury is looking at ways to raise more money from inheritance tax amid
  growing pressure on the country’s finances ahead of Rachel Reeves’ autumn
  budget, sources have told the Guardian, our City edito Anna Isaac reports.
  Officials have been tasked with examining whether tightening rules on the
  gifting of money and assets could be one way of addressing a gap between
  revenue and spending that is estimated to reach more than £40bn. Although no
  decisions have been taken, the government has been careful not to rule out tax
  rises later this year amid slowing economic growth, higher-than-hoped
  inflation and unemployment at a four-year high. Labour MPs have been pushing
  the idea of a wealth tax, but changes to inheritance tax (IHT) thresholds
  could be similarly controversial. World shares have risen to record levels
  while the dollar fell amid hopes of an interest rate cut in the US in
  September. The MSCI all country world index climbed for a second day, rising
  as high as 950.13, an all-time high. Japan’s Nikkei hit an all-time closing
  high for the second day in a row. Last night, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq
  reached fresh peaks on Wall Street. European stocks, on the Stoxx 600 Europe
  index, rose by 0.4%, with Germany’s Dax 0.7% ahead. Technology and defence
  stocks such as BAE Systems are among the biggest gainers. The FTSE 100 index
  has edged 0.1% higher to 9,157. The dollar has lost 0.4% against a basket of
  other major currencies. US treasury secretary Scott Bessent increased the
  pressure on the Federal Reserve, America’s central bank, calling for a
  half-point rate cut at its next meeting on 16-17 September. Joshua Mahony, an
  analyst at Scope Markets, said Yesterday’s US inflation report provided a
  somewhat perverse situation where markets become increasingly confident in Fed
  easing despite a five-month high for the core consumer price index metric
  (3.1%). It is unlikely that we will see that core CPI figure get anywhere near
  the 2% Fed target this year, but markets are confident that the Fed will
  overlook the data to slash rates in the months to come. Market pricing for a
  rate cut at each of the remaining three meetings of 2025 have tipped above the
  50% mark, meaning that it is now the base case scenario that we see rates at
  least 75bp lower by year-end. No wonder markets are in buoyant mood, with a
  goldilocks scenario developing where the Fed will cut rates based on poor jobs
  data that could be lagging in nature given the trade uncertainty that has
  largely been clarified. Donald Trump continues to wreak havoc on the status
  quo, with the president threatening to sue Jerome Powell as he pressures the
  chair to cut rates immediately. The ability to sue Powell remains
  questionable, but the fact is that the jobs report has at least provided the
  FOMC with a justification of drastic action should they need it. That could
  include a 50bp cut, or a cut prior to the September meeting. Meanwhile,
  Trump’s new Bureau of Labor Statistics chief has suggested shifting the
  monthly jobs report to a quarterly format in a bid to end the kind of huge
  data revisions seen of late. Nonetheless, this appears to be a case of Trump
  simply hiding the data that he does not like, providing the president with the
  ability to simply talk up the economy without the pesky facts. With the Fed
  having to take policy decisions based on the data, would the decision to
  remove one of the most important economic surveys mean that Fed
  decision-making becomes even more lagging in nature? Rolls-Royce’s efforts to
  power artificial intelligence (AI) datacentres with its nuclear reactors could
  turn it into the UK’s most valuable company, according to its boss. The
  engineering firm recently reported a 50% rise in half-year profits of £1.7bn
  as strong demand for its jet engines and power generators for AI data centres
  underpinned its turnaround efforts. This drove its share price to a record
  high of £11.085, taking the company’s market value above £90bn for the first
  time. In October 2020, the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, its share
  price fell below 40p. Its power systems business had a significant increase in
  interest from datacentres, which the chief executive, Tufan Erginbilgiç,
  confirmed was linked to the AI boom. Orders for datacentres rose by 85%
  compared with last year. The company expects a 20% increase in datacentre
  orders every year to 2030. Rolls-Royce has signed deals to supply small
  modular reactors (SMRs) to the UK and Czech governments to power AI-driven
  data centres. Use of AI has shot up in recent years across many sectors, but
  the technology uses a of energy. This morning, Rolls-Royce chief executive
  Erginbilgiç told the BBC it has the “potential” to become the UK’s biggest
  company on the back of its SMR deals, overtaking Shell and AstraZeneca. He
  said: There is no private company in the world with the nuclear capability we
  have. If we are not market leader globally, we did something wrong. Since he
  took the helm in January 2023, Rolls-Royce’s share price has increased
  ten-fold. Today, the shares rose by almost 1% to £11.01, valuing the firm at
  almost £93bn. Shell is worth £155.7bn while AstraZeneca’s market value is
  £175bn. He has ruled out the idea of a New York share listing, as British chip
  designer Arm has done. Shell and AstraZeneca have also considered it in the
  pursuit of higher valuations. Half of Rolls-Royce’s shareholders and customers
  are US-based. It’s not in our plan. I don’t agree with the idea you can only
  perform in the US. That’s not true and hopefully we have demonstrated that.
  Prof Costas Milas, of the University of Liverpool’s Management School, points
  out that the US Federal Reserve does not target consumer price index
  inflation, which held steady at 2.7% in July, but inflation as measured by the
  personal consumption expenditures index (PCE). The next relevant PCE reading
  comes out of 29 August. The two measures are heavily correlated. His own
  estimates (based on the co-movements of the two inflation measures) suggest
  that PCE inflation is likely to drop to 2.3% in July (from 2.6% in June).
  Then, the Fed might have difficulty rejecting a call for a cut by 50 basis
  points in the Fed Funds rate! The troubled Chinese property developer
  Evergrande said its Hong Kong shares will be delisted, marking the end of an
  era for the once biggest Chinese developer whose demise is now synonymous with
  the country’s property bust. The Guangzhou-based company said the Hong Kong
  stock exchange has decided to cancel its listing, according to a filing to the
  bourse on Tuesday. The shares will be removed on 25 August and the company
  will not apply for a review of the decision. The property crisis dragged down
  China’s economic growth. Evergrande’s demise began with its first default on a
  dollar bond in December 2021. It was once the country’s largest developer by
  sales, worth more than $50bn at its peak in 2017. Since then, it has become
  the world’s most indebted property developer, with more than $300bn in debts.
  It is one of dozens of Chinese companies that have collapsed since 2020 under
  official pressure to rein in excessive borrowing that the ruling Communist
  party views as a threat to the economy. In a separate filing, court-appointed
  liquidators said Evergrande’s debt load is far bigger than previously
  estimated, and any “holistic” restructuring is out of reach. Evergrande shares
  were suspended from trading in late January last when it received a
  liquidation order from a Hong Kong court. Shareholders have seen the value of
  their investments plummet in recent years. The shares last traded at less than
  20 Hong Kong cents on 29 January, 2024, giving it a market value of HK$2.15
  billion ($274m). Its founder Hui Ka Yan has a 60% stake. Kristy Hung, a
  Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said before the announcement: Whether or not
  there’s a delisting, Evergrande’s shareholders will likely have to prepare for
  near-total loss. The developer’s liquidation and substantial claims from
  creditors who are ahead in the order suggests equity holders face material
  risk of getting nothing. Donald Trump has also been vocal, hitting out at
  Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, saying the bank had been wrong to predict
  tariffs would hurt the economy and questioning whether Solomon should lead the
  Wall Street institution. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said it was mostly
  foreign companies and governments absorbing the cost of his tariffs. But David
  Solomon and Goldman Sachs refuse to give credit where credit is due. They made
  a bad prediction...on both the Market repercussion and the Tariffs themselves.
  Trump said Solomon should maybe focus on being a DJ, a hobby Solomon abandoned
  some time ago, “and not bother running a major Financial Institution”. The
  bank CEO is the latest corporate boss to become the target of Trump’s ire.
  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial
  markets and the world economy. Global stocks rallied and US markets hit new
  all-time peaks after US inflation defied expectations of an uptick and stayed
  steady last month. The figure eased concerns that Donald Trump’s tariff hikes
  would push up imported goods inflation. US treasury secretary Scott Bessent is
  now calling for a half-point interest rate cut in September. The inflation
  data was a mixed bag – headline inflation held at 2.7% but core inflation,
  which strips out energy and food, was higher than expected at 3.1%. Even so,
  investors’ bets on a rate cut in September increased, as goods prices were
  more subdued while services inflation picked up. Bessent said in an interview
  on Fox Business yesterday: The real thing now to think about is should we get
  a 50 basis-point rate cut in September. He said that two days after the US
  Federal Reserve left rates unchanged on 30 July, revised data showed weaker
  job growth for May and June than official figures had previously indicated,
  suggesting the Fed “could have been cutting in June, July”. “Cut that rate!”
  summed up Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank. Yesterday, US
  inflation data was mixed, but the market reaction was not. Normally, core
  inflation is the measure the Federal Reserve (Fed) focuses on when deciding
  monetary policy. In that context, the market could have reacted by scaling
  back expectations of a September rate cut. But no — investors instead
  increased September cut expectations, thinking that imported goods inflation
  remained lower than feared as companies continued to absorb tariff costs. As a
  result, the US 2-year yield fell after the data release, the probability of a
  September cut jumped to 94% from 80% beforehand, and the US dollar slipped
  back. The dollar has slipped a further 0.1% against a basket of other major
  currencies. Investors cheered the news, driving the S&amp;P 500 and the
  tech-heavy Nasdaq to new all-time highs, up 1.1% and 1.4% respectively.
  Japan’s Nikkei also closed at fresh record high, 1.3% higher on the day, while
  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng jumped by 2.4%. Inflation in Germany eased to 1.8% in
  July from 2% in June, the federal statistics office confirmed this morning.
  The yield on 30-year German government bonds are down today, after hitting a
  14-year high yesterday. Analysts pointed to Dutch pension reforms, which are
  expected to reduce demand for long-dated bonds, and expectations for a big
  increase in German government spending as the main reasons behind Tuesday’s
  sell-off. Markets are turning their attention to the summit in Alaska between
  Trump and Vladimir Putin on Friday to discuss ending Russia’s war in Ukraine.

Although no decisions have been taken, the government has been careful not to rule out tax rises later this year amid slowing economic growth, higher-than-hoped inflation and unemployment at a four-year high. Labour MPs have been pushing the idea of a wealth tax, but changes to inheritance tax (IHT) thresholds could be similarly controversial. World shares have risen to record levels while the dollar fell amid hopes of an interest rate cut in the US in September. The MSCI all country world index climbed for a second day, rising as high as 950.13, an all-time high. Japan’s Nikkei hit an all-time closing high for the second day in a row. Last night, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq reached fresh peaks on Wall Street. European stocks, on the Stoxx 600 Europe index, rose by 0.4%, with Germany’s Dax 0.7% ahead. Technology and defence stocks such as BAE Systems are among the biggest gainers. The FTSE 100 index has edged 0.1% higher to 9,157. The dollar has lost 0.4% against a basket of other major currencies. US treasury secretary Scott Bessent increased the pressure on the Federal Reserve, America’s central bank, calling for a half-point rate cut at its next meeting on 16-17 September. Joshua Mahony, an analyst at Scope Markets, said Yesterday’s US inflation report provided a somewhat perverse situation where markets become increasingly confident in Fed easing despite a five-month high for the core consumer price index metric (3.1%). It is unlikely that we will see that core CPI figure get anywhere near the 2% Fed target this year, but markets are confident that the Fed will overlook the data to slash rates in the months to come. Market pricing for a rate cut at each of the remaining three meetings of 2025 have tipped above the 50% mark, meaning that it is now the base case scenario that we see rates at least 75bp lower by year-end. No wonder markets are in buoyant mood, with a goldilocks scenario developing where the Fed will cut rates based on poor jobs data that could be lagging in nature given the trade uncertainty that has largely been clarified. Donald Trump continues to wreak havoc on the status quo, with the president threatening to sue Jerome Powell as he pressures the chair to cut rates immediately. The ability to sue Powell remains questionable, but the fact is that the jobs report has at least provided the FOMC with a justification of drastic action should they need it. That could include a 50bp cut, or a cut prior to the September meeting. Meanwhile, Trump’s new Bureau of Labor Statistics chief has suggested shifting the monthly jobs report to a quarterly format in a bid to end the kind of huge data revisions seen of late. Nonetheless, this appears to be a case of Trump simply hiding the data that he does not like, providing the president with the ability to simply talk up the economy without the pesky facts. With the Fed having to take policy decisions based on the data, would the decision to remove one of the most important economic surveys mean that Fed decision-making becomes even more lagging in nature? Rolls-Royce’s efforts to power artificial intelligence (AI) datacentres with its nuclear reactors could turn it into the UK’s most valuable company, according to its boss. The engineering firm recently reported a 50% rise in half-year profits of £1.7bn as strong demand for its jet engines and power generators for AI data centres underpinned its turnaround efforts. This drove its share price to a record high of £11.085, taking the company’s market value above £90bn for the first time. In October 2020, the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, its share price fell below 40p. Its power systems business had a significant increase in interest from datacentres, which the chief executive, Tufan Erginbilgiç, confirmed was linked to the AI boom. Orders for datacentres rose by 85% compared with last year. The company expects a 20% increase in datacentre orders every year to 2030. Rolls-Royce has signed deals to supply small modular reactors (SMRs) to the UK and Czech governments to power AI-driven data centres. Use of AI has shot up in recent years across many sectors, but the technology uses a of energy. This morning, Rolls-Royce chief executive Erginbilgiç told the BBC it has the “potential” to become the UK’s biggest company on the back of its SMR deals, overtaking Shell and AstraZeneca. He said: There is no private company in the world with the nuclear capability we have. If we are not market leader globally, we did something wrong. Since he took the helm in January 2023, Rolls-Royce’s share price has increased ten-fold. Today, the shares rose by almost 1% to £11.01, valuing the firm at almost £93bn. Shell is worth £155.7bn while AstraZeneca’s market value is £175bn. He has ruled out the idea of a New York share listing, as British chip designer Arm has done. Shell and AstraZeneca have also considered it in the pursuit of higher valuations. Half of Rolls-Royce’s shareholders and customers are US-based. It’s not in our plan. I don’t agree with the idea you can only perform in the US. That’s not true and hopefully we have demonstrated that. Prof Costas Milas, of the University of Liverpool’s Management School, points out that the US Federal Reserve does not target consumer price index inflation, which held steady at 2.7% in July, but inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures index (PCE). The next relevant PCE reading comes out of 29 August. The two measures are heavily correlated. His own estimates (based on the co-movements of the two inflation measures) suggest that PCE inflation is likely to drop to 2.3% in July (from 2.6% in June). Then, the Fed might have difficulty rejecting a call for a cut by 50 basis points in the Fed Funds rate! The troubled Chinese property developer Evergrande said its Hong Kong shares will be delisted, marking the end of an era for the once biggest Chinese developer whose demise is now synonymous with the country’s property bust. The Guangzhou-based company said the Hong Kong stock exchange has decided to cancel its listing, according to a filing to the bourse on Tuesday. The shares will be removed on 25 August and the company will not apply for a review of the decision. The property crisis dragged down China’s economic growth. Evergrande’s demise began with its first default on a dollar bond in December 2021. It was once the country’s largest developer by sales, worth more than $50bn at its peak in 2017. Since then, it has become the world’s most indebted property developer, with more than $300bn in debts. It is one of dozens of Chinese companies that have collapsed since 2020 under official pressure to rein in excessive borrowing that the ruling Communist party views as a threat to the economy. In a separate filing, court-appointed liquidators said Evergrande’s debt load is far bigger than previously estimated, and any “holistic” restructuring is out of reach. Evergrande shares were suspended from trading in late January last when it received a liquidation order from a Hong Kong court. Shareholders have seen the value of their investments plummet in recent years. The shares last traded at less than 20 Hong Kong cents on 29 January, 2024, giving it a market value of HK$2.15 billion ($274m). Its founder Hui Ka Yan has a 60% stake. Kristy Hung, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said before the announcement: Whether or not there’s a delisting, Evergrande’s shareholders will likely have to prepare for near-total loss. The developer’s liquidation and substantial claims from creditors who are ahead in the order suggests equity holders face material risk of getting nothing. Donald Trump has also been vocal, hitting out at Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, saying the bank had been wrong to predict tariffs would hurt the economy and questioning whether Solomon should lead the Wall Street institution. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said it was mostly foreign companies and governments absorbing the cost of his tariffs. But David Solomon and Goldman Sachs refuse to give credit where credit is due. They made a bad prediction...on both the Market repercussion and the Tariffs themselves. Trump said Solomon should maybe focus on being a DJ, a hobby Solomon abandoned some time ago, “and not bother running a major Financial Institution”. The bank CEO is the latest corporate boss to become the target of Trump’s ire. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Global stocks rallied and US markets hit new all-time peaks after US inflation defied expectations of an uptick and stayed steady last month. The figure eased concerns that Donald Trump’s tariff hikes would push up imported goods inflation. US treasury secretary Scott Bessent is now calling for a half-point interest rate cut in September. The inflation data was a mixed bag – headline inflation held at 2.7% but core inflation, which strips out energy and food, was higher than expected at 3.1%. Even so, investors’ bets on a rate cut in September increased, as goods prices were more subdued while services inflation picked up. Bessent said in an interview on Fox Business yesterday: The real thing now to think about is should we get a 50 basis-point rate cut in September. He said that two days after the US Federal Reserve left rates unchanged on 30 July, revised data showed weaker job growth for May and June than official figures had previously indicated, suggesting the Fed “could have been cutting in June, July”. “Cut that rate!” summed up Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank. Yesterday, US inflation data was mixed, but the market reaction was not. Normally, core inflation is the measure the Federal Reserve (Fed) focuses on when deciding monetary policy. In that context, the market could have reacted by scaling back expectations of a September rate cut. But no — investors instead increased September cut expectations, thinking that imported goods inflation remained lower than feared as companies continued to absorb tariff costs. As a result, the US 2-year yield fell after the data release, the probability of a September cut jumped to 94% from 80% beforehand, and the US dollar slipped back. The dollar has slipped a further 0.1% against a basket of other major currencies. Investors cheered the news, driving the S&amp;P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq to new all-time highs, up 1.1% and 1.4% respectively. Japan’s Nikkei also closed at fresh record high, 1.3% higher on the day, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng jumped by 2.4%. Inflation in Germany eased to 1.8% in July from 2% in June, the federal statistics office confirmed this morning. The yield on 30-year German government bonds are down today, after hitting a 14-year high yesterday. Analysts pointed to Dutch pension reforms, which are expected to reduce demand for long-dated bonds, and expectations for a big increase in German government spending as the main reasons behind Tuesday’s sell-off. Markets are turning their attention to the summit in Alaska between Trump and Vladimir Putin on Friday to discuss ending Russia’s war in Ukraine. The Agenda 9am BST: IEA Oil market report
