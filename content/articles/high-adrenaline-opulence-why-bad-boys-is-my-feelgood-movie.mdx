  Sitcoms Martin and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air were still on the air when Bad
  Boys hit theatres 30 years ago. Their leading men, Martin Lawrence and Will
  Smith, respectively, brought a lot of that goofy small-screen banter – this
  time loaded with testosterone and F-bombs – to a buddy cop movie. Bad Boys
  opens with an announcement of their arrival. Lawrence’s Marcus Burnett and
  Smith’s Mike Lowrey are cruising around Miami in a Porsche 911, doing a sitcom
  bit as they bicker over French fries and cupholders, before a pair of car
  thieves catch them by surprise and hold them up at gunpoint. When Smith’s Mike
  warns that they’re cops, one of the car jackers dismisses him – “Well, I’m a
  stand-up comedian, and I suck” – as if speaking for an audience unconvinced
  that these two comic personalities could plausibly exist in their new roles.
  An elbow to the head and kick to the groin later – Smith and Lawrence making a
  trope-y takedown appear convincingly cool – leaves that same doubter laid
  flat, looking up at Will Smith as he calmly points a gun at him (and the
  audience) while responding: “Now, let’s hear one of them jokes, bitch.” For
  any kid like myself weaned on Martin and Fresh Prince – for whom the latter
  especially would dictate our fashion sense and goofball sensibilities – that
  moment landed like an exhilarating coming-of-age. Our household icon just
  graduated to badass movie-star status, even growing his baby mustache into a
  goatee, while basking in the golden hues director Michael Bay, in his
  feature-film debut, would bathe him in. It’s a feeling I first experienced as
  a 13-year-old sneaking into a very R-rated movie on opening day, and relive
  every time I revisit Bad Boys – whether in whole or just the part when Smith’s
  sprinting through Miami streets in slow motion, his shirt open to reveal a
  glistening Adonis-like physique. Sure, Bad Boys is riddled with cliches and
  groaners. It’s a formulaic action movie about two narcotics detectives hunting
  down heroin stolen from their own precinct. They have to role-play as each
  other because of a contrived plot device involving a witness (Téa Leoni, also
  fabulous) whose desperate demands set up the duplicity. But Smith and Lawrence
  make all the flaws go down easy, needling each other with their hilarious
  rapport, while Leoni easily holds her own against the comic stars. Bay
  elevates the material with his high-adrenaline opulence. The director’s
  swooping slow-motion camera work and operatic low-angle shots of action heroes
  as gods would reach parodic levels in follow-up movies like The Island,
  Transformers and even Bad Boys II. But in his first time out, Bay’s bombastic
  aesthetic (with some shots and production design elements lifted from his
  music video for Meatloaf’s I’ll Do Anything for Love) was an exciting calling
  card for a director who would later be referred to as a vulgar auteur. Who
  else would stage a splashy bathroom brawl, where heads are smashed into
  urinals, with gothic romantic candlelight? Instead of drowning out his stars
  with this maximalism, Bay’s style instead puts them on a pedestal. That feels
  especially ground-breaking since this was the rare studio action movie at the
  time starring not one but two Black leads. Before Bad Boys, buddy-cop movies
  favored the tempered chocolate-and-vanilla pairings of 48 Hrs. (Eddie Murphy
  and Nick Nolte), Lethal Weapon (Danny Glover and Mel Gibson) and The Last Boy
  Scout (Damon Wayans and Bruce Willis). That wouldn’t have worked for a
  premise, originally conceived as a comedy for SNL stars Dana Carvey and Jon
  Lovitz, where the two stars have to swap identities. Casting both Smith and
  Lawrence, and giving them the room to make the movie completely their own, set
  the stage for an action movie with distinct swagger, transcending the way
  Black-led movies at the time were pigeon-holed as strictly for “urban”
  audiences. The hip-hop, R&amp;B and dancehall on the soundtrack added to that
  sensation, pairing tracks from 2Pac, Warren G, Babyface, Diana King and Ini
  Kamoze with Mark Mancina’s adrenaline rush of a score (that man went hard on
  those strings!). Lawrence and Smith clearly understood what it meant for them
  to step up to these roles, and take up that rarified space, which is why
  throughout Bad Boys they keep paying homage to those who came before them.
  “Wesley Snipes, Passenger 57!” Lawrence yells out in that opening announcing
  their arrival, following that up with comically timed shout-outs to Shaft,
  Action Jackson and Jim Brown, the former football star who starred in The
  Dirty Dozen and 100 Rifles. These were the Black action heroes that Smith and
  Lawrence grew up with, just as we would grow up with them. Bad Boys is
  available to rent digitally in the US, on Now/Sky in the UK and Netflix in
  Australia
