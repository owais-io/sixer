  About 600 former Israeli security officials, including previous heads of the
  Mossad and the military, have urged Donald Trump to pressure Israel to end the
  war in Gaza as the country’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, considers
  expanding the conflict. In an open letter, the former officials said an end to
  the war was the only way to save hostages still held by Hamas. “Your
  credibility with the vast majority of Israelis augments your ability to steer
  prime minister Netanyahu and his government in the right direction: end the
  war, return the hostages, stop the suffering,” they wrote. They added that
  they thought Hamas no longer posed a strategic threat to Israel. The letter
  comes as pressure mounts for the Israeli government to end the war, even as
  Netanyahu considers intensifying the offensive. Thousands of protesters took
  to the streets in Israel over the weekend after two videos were released of
  emaciated hostages held in Gaza. One video in particular, which depicted a
  skeletal Evyatar David digging what he said could be his own grave, prompted a
  wave of outrage across Israel. On Sunday night, the Hostages and Missing
  Families Forum headquarters released a statement that accused Netanyahu of
  “leading Israel and the kidnapped to doom”. Netanyahu said on Monday he would
  convene his security cabinet this week to discuss how to instruct the military
  to meet his war goals in Gaza, with Israeli media reporting the prime minister
  was inclining towards expanding the offensive and seizing the entire
  Palestinian territory. According to Israeli media, Netanyahu wants to try
  “pushing for the release of the hostages through decisive military victory”.
  Intensifying military activity in the Palestinian territory would placate the
  far-right ministers in Netanyahu’s governing coalition, who have consistently
  advocated against a ceasefire. The Israeli government is exploring the idea of
  intensified military operations as ceasefire negotiations seemed to have
  stalled – which it blames on Hamas. The US and Israel withdrew their
  negotiators from Doha 10 days ago and said they would explore “alternative
  options” to retrieve the hostages. An expansion of the war would be contrary
  to what Trump’s Middle East envoy told the families of hostages over the
  weekend was the US position. Steve Witkoff said Washington was backing a
  comprehensive end to the Gaza war that would bring hostages home and assured
  the families that would not mean more fighting. Any expansion of the conflict
  would risk worsening the already catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza.
  A UN-affiliated humanitarian body said the territory was experiencing famine,
  as the approximately 2.1 million people who live there experience mass
  starvation. Despite the announcement of expanded aid measures in Gaza,
  humanitarian groups say Israel is still not letting nearly enough aid into the
  territory. Israel denies there is starvation in Gaza and blames the UN for not
  distributing aid efficiently. At least 40 Palestinians were killed by Israeli
  gunfire and airstrikes in Gaza on Monday, in addition to five people who died
  of starvation, health authorities said. At least 10 of those who were killed
  were shot as they queued for food outside distribution centres run by the
  private US Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). A nurse at al-Aqsa hospital was
  also killed when an airdropped pallet of aid fell on him in Deir al-Balah,
  central Gaza. Another man was taken to the hospital after a crate of aid fell
  on his tent. The World Health Organization announced it was delivering
  medicine and blood units to hospitals across Gaza – a rare delivery to bolster
  the Palestinian territory’s devastated healthcare system. Almost 61,000 people
  have been killed in Gaza since the war began. Israel launched the war in
  response to an attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 in which Hamas-led militants
  killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostage. Families of the hostages
  rejected the idea of further fighting in Gaza, which they said on Sunday
  “endangers the lives of the kidnapped, who are already in immediate danger of
  death”. The former Israeli security officials also warned against an expansion
  of the war, arguing that Israel had long since achieved its military
  objectives in Gaza. “At first this war was a just war, a defensive war, but
  when we achieved all military objectives, this war ceased to be a just war,”
  Ami Ayalon, the former head of the Shin Bet security agency, said in a video
  on Sunday night. “This [war] is leading the state of Israel to the loss of its
  security and identity.” A demonstration was also held outside the prime
  minister’s office in Jerusalem in protest against plans to sack Israel’s
  attorney general, Gali Baharav-Miara. The government voted for her dismissal
  on Monday, despite the Israeli supreme court saying she should not be replaced
  until her term has ended. In March, the Israeli justice minister started the
  process of firing the attorney general. Baharav-Miara, who was appointed by
  the previous government, had come into conflict with Netanyahu on a number of
  issues including his indictments over allegations over bribery and fraud. The
  government has accused her of deliberately blocking its policy initiatives and
  for conducting politically motivated “witch-hunts”. She has also made public
  statements against the undermining of the separation of powers, understood to
  be a response to Netanyahu’s controversial judicial overhaul. Israel’s high
  court of justice issued an injunction against the government’s decision to
  dismiss the attorney general, leaving her in position for the time being. The
  government is expected to appeal against the decision to block the firing.
  Israeli ministers have said they will stop inviting Baharav-Miara to hearings
  and committee meetings, regardless of the injunction. The move to dismiss the
  attorney general has been widely criticised by opposition parties and rights
  monitors. The chair of the Democrats party, Yair Golan, accused the government
  of trying to fire Baharav-Miara to safeguard Netanyahu’s political interests.
  “The agenda for the upcoming meeting: increased security for Netanyahu and his
  family and the dismissal of the attorney general,” Golan said in a post on X,
  alleging the prime minister did not care about the lives of Israeli hostages.
