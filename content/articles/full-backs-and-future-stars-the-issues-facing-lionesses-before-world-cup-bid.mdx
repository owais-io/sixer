  The shiny ticker-tape had not even been cleared from the pitch at St
  Jakob-Park when the gauntlet was thrown down. As England celebrated their Euro
  2025 triumph, King Charles wrote on the royal family’s Instagram account:
  “Well done, Lionesses. The next task is to bring home the World Cup in 2027 if
  you possibly can!” No pressure, then. The short-term future for England
  players will centre around two things; a holiday – unless you are a National
  Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) player like Jess Carter, who had to fly straight
  back to the US to play club football – and more accolades, the latest of which
  came on Friday as the National Football Museum announced every squad member
  and Sarina Wiegman will all be inducted into their Hall of Fame. More awards
  will surely follow but, eventually, everyone will catch up with the king’s
  mindset and focus attention on 2027. Having become the first senior England
  football team to win a major trophy overseas, and the first to defend a title,
  the next obstacle to overcome is to win the nation’s first Women’s World Cup,
  with the next tournament to be staged in Brazil as it heads to South America
  for the first time. The Lionesses have come very close, reaching the
  semi-finals in 2015 and 2019 before losing 2023’s final, and their retained
  status as European champions will see many tipping them for glory in a couple
  of years. But how will this team evolve before then and what is there for all
  concerned to ponder? New coaches, new ideas Wiegman’s team now enter a new era
  as they say farewell to her long-serving assistant Arjan Veurink, often hailed
  as key to their tactical success, as he heads off to become the Netherlands
  head coach. Geraint Twose, part of Wiegman’s backroom team for both of their
  Euro-winning campaigns, is also moving on to take up a new position as
  England’s lead transition coach, supporting players in the youth pathway.
  Arriving from the Netherlands are Janneke Bijl and Arvid Smit, and it will be
  interesting to see how, if at all, England’s style changes with them in place.
  The right-back conundrum Lucy Bronze has made it clear she wants to play at
  the next World Cup. She will be 35-and-three-quarters when the tournament
  comes around and while her experience, leadership skills and mentality will
  ensure she is still England’s first-choice right-back if fit, the Lionesses
  need a plan B, just in case sports science discovers an injury so severe that
  Bronze cannot play through it, unlike a seemingly minor problem of a – checks
  notes – fractured tibia at the Euros. England had the Manchester United
  captain, Maya Le Tissier, waiting in the wings this summer, someone Wiegman
  sees as a right-back despite the fact she has played every match for her club
  at centre-back. Also in contention is Tottenham’s Ella Morris, who has
  impressed at right-back through England’s youth teams but suffered an anterior
  cruciate ligament injury in May. The left-back dilemma England have been
  without a consistently selected left-back for a generation, with no one making
  that position their own since the centurion Rachel Unitt more than a decade
  ago. Alex Greenwood did well in that position against Spain but she commonly
  plays at centre-back for Manchester City, and that is where Wiegman had
  intended to play the 31-year-old before the tournament began. Niamh Charles,
  who also played well when called upon from the bench, will be another option,
  but she will want to start more games for Chelsea between now and the World
  Cup. Who might break into the starting XI? England are blessed with attacking
  options and Michelle Agyemang and Aggie Beever-Jones in particular are likely
  to provide Wiegman with welcome headaches during the next two seasons. Chloe
  Kelly’s standing will also continue to rise, while Wiegman will be keen to
  give more opportunities to the technically gifted midfielders Grace Clinton
  and Jess Park, both of whom played prominent roles during the recent Nations
  League campaigns. Who will be England’s strongest challengers? World champions
  Spain will be a huge threat in Brazil, as will the hosts, who have been in
  good form and reached the Olympic final last year. The USA, managed by Emma
  Hayes, will probably be the favourites, while the younger generation of stars
  breaking through with Germany and France will see them in contention too.
  Japan, who played some eye-catching football during their victory over the
  United States in the SheBelieves Cup in California in February, will also be a
  threat. England’s qualifying campaign begins next year.
