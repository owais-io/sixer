  Foreign criminals from 15 more countries face deportation before they have a
  chance to appeal in an expansion of the UK government’s “deport first, appeal
  later” scheme. Ministers are extending the scheme, which applies in England
  and Wales and was restarted in 2023, to cover 23 countries including India,
  Bulgaria, Australia and Canada. The policy, which was introduced by the
  Conservatives in 2014, removes the right of foreign criminals to appeal
  against their conviction in the UK unless they show they are at risk of harm
  if they are deported to their country of origin. It is already operational in
  eight countries including Tanzania, Finland, Estonia and Belize. Other
  countries brought under the scheme by Labour ministers include Angola,
  Botswana, Brunei, Canada, Guyana, Indonesia, Kenya, Latvia, Lebanon, Malaysia,
  Uganda and Zambia. The move is part of the Labour government’s efforts to step
  up the deportations of foreign criminals to deal with overcrowded prisons and
  public concerns about crime. Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, announced
  proposals on Sunday to allow foreign criminals given fixed-term sentences to
  be deported immediately after sentencing and barred from re-entering the UK.
  Those serving life sentences, such as terrorists and murderers, are exempt and
  will serve their full prison sentence in the UK before being considered for
  deportation. The policy has come under fire from two former Conservative
  justice secretaries who say it risks making the UK a soft touch for foreign
  criminals, because offenders would not be serving sentences at home. The
  former justice secretary Alex Chalk told the Guardian: “I have real misgivings
  about this, and it could make people in Britain a magnet for crime from
  foreign national offenders.” He told Times Radio that “rapists, people who
  commit child cruelty, aggravated burglars, knife crimers, domestic abusers”
  who were deported to their home countries “would not have to spend a day in
  custody”. “If you have been the victim of an appalling rape that has shattered
  your life, and you pluck up the courage to go to court, the jury convict this
  guy [and] within two weeks he’s in Tirana, drinking a cocktail paid by the
  British taxpayer, and on TikTok laughing at his victim,” Chalk said. “The real
  danger is you’re giving a green light to foreign national offenders. You come
  to Britain, you’re not going to get punished. You’re thinking: the worst that
  happens to me is I’m released immediately and put on a plane.” He added:
  “You’ve got to have a measure of justice so if you come to our country and
  commit a crime, you expect punishment. I would urge parliament to scrutinise
  this extremely carefully”. Robert Buckland, another former justice secretary,
  said Chalk was right to express concerns. “Many victims of these crimes want
  justice to be served here first before deportation. Has the government taken
  the views of victims into consideration in all of this?” The Ministry of
  Justice confirmed to the Guardian that foreign offenders deported under the
  expansion of the “deport first, appeal later” scheme would not necessarily
  face prison in their home country. After a legal challenge, the supreme court
  ruled in 2007 that the “deport first, appeal later” system was unlawful
  because it infringed on people’s right to give live evidence to their appeal.
  The government dealt with the court’s concerns by setting up agreements with
  several countries for foreign criminals to give live evidence to their appeal
  hearings using a video link. The scheme was restarted in 2023. Yvette Cooper,
  the home secretary, said that “for far too long, foreign criminals have been
  exploiting our immigration system, remaining in the UK for months or even
  years while their appeals drag on. That has to end. “Those who commit crimes
  in our country cannot be allowed to manipulate the system, which is why we are
  restoring control and sending a clear message that our laws must be respected
  and will be enforced.” David Lammy, the foreign secretary, said ministers were
  in talks with several countries about extending the scheme. Foreign offenders
  make up about 12% of the prison population in England and Wales, with each
  prison place costing an average of £54,000 each year, according to the
  government. Of the new countries covered by the scheme, only Indians are in
  the top nationalities in the prison population. Officials said that in the
  year since Labour came to power in July 2024, 5,179 foreign nationals who had
  been convicted of crimes had been deported, a 14% increase on the year before.
