  No one understands the joy of seeing a band from the 00s quite like an ageing
  millennial. At Bloc Party’s Melbourne show this past Sunday, my bestie and I
  followed the growing crowds of 30-and-older, skinny jean wearing, middle-aged
  hipsters towards John Cain Arena, excited to revel in the nostalgic music of
  our youth. Because we’re old now, we did the sensible thing and booked
  reserved seating. But like any reasonable gig-goer, we knew implicitly that
  just because the seats are there, it doesn’t mean everyone is expected to sit
  in them for the duration of the set. I would have thought it obvious that
  attending a rock gig entails a certain commitment to bodily movement. It’s
  nice that we can choose to bow out of the sweaty, heaving, foot-crushing, back
  pain-inducing revelry of the mosh pit but having a seat doesn’t mean we’re
  completely dead yet, it just means we’re selective about when we dance and no
  longer have the capacity to stand for more than 20 minutes straight without
  discomfort. So when the band broke into the first banger of the night,
  Helicopter, a moderate number of people in the premium reserved seating stalls
  stood up to have a boogie. Nothing wild was going on – some head bopping, foot
  tapping – the usual Melbourne hipster dance moves. One of these pioneers
  happened to be an exceptionally tall man in the first few rows. And the
  audience member seated behind him was not having a bar of it. Cue shouting,
  gesturing and repeated attempts to make the dancer sit down. As the show went
  on, this exchange erupted again and again. The dancer eventually shouted, arms
  opened wide in disbelief, “It’s a gig, mate! It’s a gig!”, while some of us in
  the rows behind them started chiming in with, “Let the man dance!” I observed
  this with some dismay. Now, I’ll be honest and admit that I have on occasion
  expressed annoyance at people standing in front of me at gigs. Not to them,
  obviously, because I’m not that entitled, but I’ve muttered a few choice words
  to my friends about how annoying it is when a dancer blocks my view. It is
  annoying. I’m very short and can almost never see the stage. But just because
  something annoys you doesn’t mean it’s actually “wrong” – and it certainly
  doesn’t mean that you’re entitled to ruin someone else’s experience at a
  public event where they’re really just doing what it says to do on the label.
  Buy a ticket to a gig? People might dance. Some people will dance while
  standing up. Not everyone who goes to a Bloc Party show is going to be content
  to sit with their arms crossed and tap their feet as if they’re at the opera
  (I actually have no idea what people at the opera do). The thing that most
  struck me was that everyone at that show – and I feel confident saying this
  based on the fact that I didn’t see a single face that looked under 30 – was
  there because they loved the music in that special way that you do when it was
  the soundtrack to your coming of age. We all swayed to So Here We Are and we
  all screamed the words to Positive Tension – I’m sure many of us were
  remembering doing the exact same things at house parties when we were 17. It
  was a lovely moment of solidarity and common experience, the way that all live
  music always reminds me how special art is, and how lucky we are when we
  experience it together. So to have someone turn a good night into a nightmare
  because they can’t handle being in public with other people without trying to
  control their every movement was a real bummer. At the end of the show, every
  single person in our seated section surged to their feet to dance to Ratchet
  but the miserable man who had started the argument stayed seated, his every
  side crowded by dancing bodies. I hope making his point was worth it. He
  missed out on a very good boogie. • Zoya Patel is a writer and editor based in
