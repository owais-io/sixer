  I’m not exaggerating when I say that was one of the best games of rugby I’ve
  ever watched. There’s a tendency to over hype the women’s game. To compensate
  for the unjust inequities, the blatant sexism and the years of neglect.
  There’s also an understandable need to focus less on results and the quality
  of rugby and shine a light on the stories of the individuals involved, to
  champion those heroes who have sacrificed so much to represent their nations.
  No need on this one. This was just a brilliant, breathtaking dig-dong affair.
  Two wonderful sides, producing moments of magic with just enough error to keep
  things open. It was by a distance the game of the tournament and will take
  some beating before the whole show comes to an end. Luke McLaughlin was
  fortunate enough to see it with his own eyes in York. Here’s his match report:
  So, have Australia done enough? If they beat England next week they’re
  through. That won’t happen. A bonus point for four tries scored or a defeat of
  seven points or less will also be enough. I don’t either of those things will
  happen either. So it’ll come down to points differences – in my opinion.
  Currently the USA are 135 points behind Australia so it would need to be a
  dramatic swing. Australia beat Samoa 73-0. The USA, you’d think, would need to
  better that. As Group A stands, England are on top top 10 points. Australia
  are second with 8. The USA are third with 3. The last word goes to Sione
  Fukofuka, the USA head coach: I am proud of the players, we went down and
  fought for the game and I thought we had it as well. You can’t predict
  Australia. The message is stay in process, stay in position, gain the points
  and hopefully we beat them. Jo Yapp, the Wallaroos coach, is next on the mic:
  On the whole we’re a bit disappointed and a bit flat. We let them into the
  game in the second half where our penalty count allowed them to gain access.
  Ultimately our discipline let us down and we weren’t very accurate. We have to
  reflect on that ahead of a big game next week. Now the Eagles captain, Kate
  Zackary: We knew it was going to be a back and forth match. Every time we got
  hit we hit back a little harder. That fight is what we’ll carry into the next
  game. The biggest message is we fought back. We’ve earned ourselves another
  shot. Let’s get more reaction. Here’s the Aussie skipper, Emily Chancellor:
  It’s a bit mixed. Right now we’re a little flat because we wanted that game
  really bad. It feels like both teams lost it. Frustrating. We made it hard for
  ourselves. We have to go back to the drawing board for England. Our player of
  the match, hat-trick hero Freda Tafuna, speaks. She doesn’t say much. Thanks
  to crowd, gives “glory to God” and gives credit to her teammates. Players are
  in tears. It was that sort of game. I’m just about in tears. Australia had the
  ball but kicked ahead. Then Sharp mopped up but with her heels just about
  touching her own try line, and with no mates around her, she decided to kick
  it out and bring the game to an end. An extraordinary game. It’ll come down to
  points difference. Australia are on +73. The USA are on -62. Will bonus points
  make a difference? It ends in a draw! It was an anticlimactic end to what was
  one of the best games of rugby I’ve ever seen. 80 min: The scrum is clean. The
  ball flies out to Miller on the left wing who tears up field. Duck has to mop
  up a loose pass. They’re back inside their own half but still have the ball.
  They have to go again. 78 min: The USA get a penalty at the scrum! . The USA
  hoof it out. Not very far, but it is out and they get a line-out that Ehrecke
  wins. But the Wallaroos win the ball back! They keep the ball tight and
  unplayable from the maul. They’re a long way out. About 6 metres or so. But
  they could definitely score. What they don’t want to don’t want to give away
  another penalty. 77 min: Jarrell-Searcy spills the ball in contact on halfway.
  Time for a deep breath. I genuinely have no idea which way this is going.
  Australia have a chance to make some ground and possibly set a drop goal?
  Maybe eke a kickable penalty? Who knows. I just don’t want this to end. WHAT
  THE WHAT!!! I can’t remember a more entertaining game of rugby. Australia,
  from the close line-out, set the maul. It rumbled close, within touching
  distance. But stalled. So it was up to some strong carries around the fringe.
  Eventually Karpani decided to take matters in her own hands and barrelled
  over. Wood missed the conversion. We’re even. Can you believe it?! 73 min:
  Maher strays offside from a USA clearing kick so Halse drills this penalty
  into the corner. She’s been so good kicking out of hand. Now the Aussies have
  a line-out about six out. They have to score. THE USA TAKE THE LEAD! The
  towering lock has had an immense game and she gets a deserving try with a pick
  and go from bang in front. It was wave after wave of women in blue crashing
  over tacklers in green. Rogers – twice – Maher, Brody, just about every player
  was involved in that. Even Hawkins, who held firm in contact. The conversion
  from Hawkins is good. Where is this game going? 71 min: The USA go down the
  blind side after faking the maul. They make metres. Now they spiral the ball
  from the left wing to the right. They cam back infield. Up to the 22. Rogers
  with a big carry – she’s had some game in the close quarters. 10 phases.
  Hawkins has to carry herself. Maher involved. Into the 22. Rogers again over
  the gainline. They’re 10 short. Brody makes ground…. 69 min: Another penalty
  on the floor for the Eagles. This one on halfway. Hawkins can’t make great
  ground with the kick but the line-out gives them a chance to set an attack
  from inside Australia’s half. TAFUNA GETS A HAT-TRICK! My goodness, what a
  game! The USA go back to their maul and it pays off. They’re so cohesive and
  once they get a second shove on there’s no stopping them. Hawkins, from the
  right, slots the sticks and it’s a two point game. 66 min: The USA get a
  penalty a metre short of the Australian line. They kept hammering and
  hammering and hammering at the wall but couldn’t find a breach. Hawkins tried
  to find Henrich with a cross-field kick coast to coast but skewed it. So we
  come back for the lengthy advantage which Hawkins nudges to the corner. They
  have to score here. 63 min: A massive turnover from the Wallaroos defensive
  maul. The Eagles went back to what worked earlier in the piece but the Aussies
  were wise to them. They took the intial hit, absorbed the momentum and swamped
  the ball carrier, denying Bergell a chance to get her hands on it. Australia’s
  exit play, as it has been all game, is decent though the clearing kick doesn’t
  find touch. The USA come back at them. 62 min: The USA keep the ball alive in
  midfield and get a penalty. Nice touches from Taufoou. A stiff carry down the
  blindside from Maher. Bargell kept it thrumming and Hawkins kicks it out for a
  line-out throw on the Aussie 22. They need to score here. The teenager bags a
  brace! Australia are showing their class and stretching their lead. With a
  penalty advantage they keep the ball in play. Swift hands under pressure from
  Moleka kept it moving. Miller could have had a dart herself but it was Halse
  who finishes it off down the left. The conversion from out wide in the left
  tram is good as well. Sensational stuff from the Wallaroos. What can the
  Eagles do in response? 59 min: It’s not quite to the corner but Australia win
  the line-out, and then get a penalty advantage, on the USA’s 22. 56 min: This
  has been, by a staggering distance, the best game of the competition. I’m
  thrilled to be calling it. The USA are back on the ball though Wood manages to
  charge down Bargell’s box kick. Then there’s a knock on from an American so
  it’s Australia who will get the scrum feed inside American territory. My
  goodness, momentum is moving this way and that the arm of a grandfather clock.
  Australia win the scrum penalty and will surely nudge it to the corner. A
  DOUBLE FOR MILLER! What a game we have on our hands. Tuinakauvadra won a
  penalty on the floor straight from the restart which was kicked to the right
  corner. Australia got the maul rumbling before playing out the back with
  Moleka spiralling a long pass to Miller. The winger squared up her defender,
  put in a strong hand off and slid over in the left corner. What a finish! The
  conversion is missed but the Aussies are back in front. The Eagles maul over!
  They’re in the lead thanks to a formidable rumbling maul that was formed
  quickly and stayed connected even after the Wallaroos looked to fracture the
  pack. Tafuna was not to be denied as she wrestled the ball down following a
  second burst. This time Hawkins slots the extras from out to the right. What a
  comeback from the Americans. Momentum is all with them. 50 min: The USA from
  the line-out are motoring forward with Sagapolu once more on the ball. But
  Friedrichs strips the ball loose and now the Wallaroos are on the attack.
  Possession changes once more. Ding dong stuff from both teams. Bargell box
  kicks and causes trouble for the Australian back three though tghey eventually
  mop up. But there’s another penalty on the ground! Maher once more. She’s such
  a menace at the breakdown. Hawkins hoofs it towards the corner. The USA are on
  fire in this second half. 48 min: Halse runs onto a high ball and catches it
  while sliding. That is impressive work from the fullback. Australia recycle
  the ball down the line where Miller has it be she is swamped by women in blue.
  The USA get in and win another penalty on the floor. Momentum all with them
  once more. They win the line-out with Zackary inside Australia’s half and set
  another attack. They’re over! It’s the big prop who busts over. Johnson came
  close moments earlier but the Australian defence held firm. But there was no
  stopping Sagapolu. Brilliant build up as the Americans showed greater patience
  through the phases. The conversion hits both posts but doesn’t go over.
  Hawkins really should have slotted that. 44 min: Taufoou wins another penalty
  and Australia give another penalty. That’s three in a row already this half.
  Hawkins unfurls a cross kick which Emba plucks from the air to keep the move
  alive. Maher goes in to clean the ruck and picks the ball up herself. They’re
  up to the 22. Johnson’s pass is almost intercepted but the Americans find the
  edge on the left with Coulibaly running full tilt. They’re about seven short
  now. Five with a strong close carry. Three. They’re so close. 42 min: No
  changes for either side at the break. Moleka’s restart is low and flat and
  soon after the Eagle’s win a penalty on the floor. Hawkins, now kicking into
  the wind, can’t make too much ground with her punt but the USA have the line
  throw which Taufoou wins. They set the maul before Henrich gets over the
  gainline. Another penalty against Australia for holding onto the tackler.
  Bargell, who has had a good game, stays prone on the ground clutching her
  torso. The players are back on the field. This is going to be epic. There’s so
  little between the teams but the Americans are edging a few of the stats.
  They’d made more metres in the carry, have made more runs with ball in hand,
  had had greater success at the ruck and have dominated territory. But they’d
  not been able to capitalise and must now produce a massive 40 minute
  performance if they want to take part in the quarterfinals. Shoutout to Paul
  Hughes who is keeping in touch with the rugby, and writing in, from Kyiv. Hope
  you’re well Paul and thanks for your email. Nope, they decide they’ve had
  enough and punt it out after winning the scrum. Brilliant game. I’d be
  staggered if a better 40 has been played this World Cup. Australia took their
  chances. The USA coughed up too many of theirs. That’s the difference as the
  two teams head into the sheds with the game in the balance. 40 min: Sharp
  spills a bouncing ball so Australia have a scrum inside the Eagles’ turf and a
  chance to add more points before the break. What a try! Brilliant from the
  Wallaroos. Naden went short with the line-out. Then the maul was set. The
  Americans held firm so Wood sent it towards the midfield where Halse, up from
  fullback, joined the line with a superb run and found a gap to slide under the
  poles. Wood took an age to convert from right in front but she made no
  mistake. 38 min: The clearing kick from Hawkins doesn’t go very far. Just to
  the 22 where Australia will have the line-out throw. It’s too long and the USA
  come away with it. But there’s a penalty against the Eagles. Was that
  obstruction? Halse doesn’t ask questions. She punts to the corner once more.
  Naden has to find her jumper five out. 36 min: From the line-out close to
  halfway Smith and then Maher carry through midfield for the USA. But there’s a
  spill in contact so now Australia have a scrum feed with space on both sides
  and wingers primed. A slightly shorter blindside down the left with both Halse
  and Moleka standing right behind the scrum. They do go left for Miller who
  makes great ground. Now they go right through the hands. Back towards the
  left. Wood is zipping it across the park. Seven phases. Halse involved
  throughout. Tafuna lands a big hit but the Aussies continue. Duck finds an
  opening, she’s into the 22 but loses her footing. Australia retain possession
  and look for Stewart on the right wing but the flat pass is not accruate and
  goes straight out. The USA will have the throw deep inside their own 22. 33
  min: The USA win a penalty on the ground! The Aussies won the line-out but
  couldn’t set the maul. Duck charged and was knocked back. Australia stuck with
  the blindside which played into the hands of the Americans who had the numbers
  to get over the ball and win the relieving penalty. 31 min: Like the USA’s
  line-out, the Australian scrum has worked as it should. It gives Moleka a
  platform to hoof a long kick forward. Sharp carries it back for the Eagles and
  is nailed by Duck (insert your own joke here). That forces the mistake and the
  Wallaroos swarm, winning the turnover on the deck. Halse finds touch five out.
  Chance to strike back. 29 min: Another penalty goes the way of the USA.
  Straight from the restart, Australia lose their cool and feet at the
  breakdown. A free exit for the USA who once again win the line-out. Tafuna
  with another big carry – she’s having a stormer of a game. Momentum all with
  the Americans. Up to halfway. Hawkins tries to force the issue as she looks
  for an edge but the ball drifts forward as she tries to find Zackary – also
  having a stormer – on the support line. Swift line speed from the Aussies was
  the difference there. They’re there! You can’t say they don’t deserve that. It
  started with a ropey line-out that found prop Sagapolu at the back. He held on
  before passing to her skipper Zackary who stormed forward, making great
  ground. From there they needed to secure they ball. They did before Tafuna
  powered over from close range. The wind blew the ball off the tee as Wawkins
  went to convert and she ran out of time before she could reset. 26 min: The
  USA’s line-out has functioned well and Jarrell hauls down another one. Duck
  puts in a monster hit but soon strays off side as she searches for quick line
  speed. This time Hawkins finds touch inside the Wallaroos turf. This line-out
  doesn’t work but it still lands in Sagapolu’s hands. She feeds it on for
  Zackary who storms forward, what a run that is from the skipper. They’re now
  five out. penalty advantage… 24 min: Moleka shows great hands and times her
  pass for Miller to her left to perfection. They’re working the blindside well
  until an Australian hand spills it in contact. Bergell box kicks. Australia
  come back until Maher stoops low to make the turnover on the deck. 23 min: A
  big bomb of a kick is allowed to bounce by the Wallaroos back three and
  Zackary tears after it. She can’t get there but that is a sign that the bounce
  of a ball could be the difference tonight. Oh, they’re coming back for another
  look at a Tuinakauvadra tackle earlier in the piece. Seems she’ll get away
  with it despite it looking high. It is a penalty but the USA make another
  mistake, not finding touch with the kick. 22 min: Wood nails a clearing kick
  after Australia’s scrum provides the platform and gives her space to do so. A
  great bounce means the ball bobbles out inside the USA’s patch. The Americans
  have the libne-out but cough up possession. Now Australia are on the charge
  with Tuinakauvadra carrying with intent. Seven phases go left then back
  towards the right, inching forwards. Wood delays her pass as she waits for her
  mates to find their shape. Halse gets her head up and sees open space towards
  the left wing and puts in a lovely kick for Miller to chase. The ball drifts
  over Emba’s head but bounces out before Miller can grab it. 19 min: This time
  Australia’s clearing kick doesn’t find touch and Emba grabs the bouncing ball
  and runs it back. The Eagles keep the ball until Bargell tries an audacious
  pop pass back inside from the base of a ruck and finds nothing but air. It’s
  so rushed. Not sure why. They’re bossing the point of contact and playing some
  neat rugby. They just need to show a bit more patience. Easy to say from here,
  to be fair. 16 min: Australia’s scrum, like their scramble defence, is
  holding. It gives Moleka a platform to set her clearing kick from inside her
  22. She gets a good piece of it but the wind spirals it out shorter than she
  was aiming. USA win the line-out off the top and attack through their
  midfield. Maher again with a carry. Sharp joins from fullback. Emba has it on
  the right win but is bundled out of touch after a double tackle with Miller
  playing the lead role. The Australian defence really has been impressive. 15
  min: Australia win the scrum and carry away with Smith. But Maher makes an
  incredible steal after making the tackle and the USA have the ball back inside
  Australia’s 22. They panic and rush things, yet again spilling the ball. How
  many times are they going to blow opportunities? 13 min: Australia’s exit play
  is slick with Halse thumping a clearing kick from her own 22 and putting it
  out 25 metres up field. The USA’s line-out is just as slick as they go off the
  top and crash through midfield with Maher. Bargell picks and snipes around the
  fringe. They’re into the 22. Prop Sagapolu carries. So does no. 8 Johnson.
  Over 10 phases now and they’re 10 metres short. But yet again it’s so sloppy.
  A nothing pass to no-one is spilled forward and that is a huge let-off for the
  Aussies. The Eagles are currently their own worst enemies. 10 min: The scrum
  was good and Henrich and Tafuna both had stiff carries. But the skipper,
  Zackary, drops the ball under no pressure, taking her eyes off it at the
  crucial moment. Soft possession switch there. Australia have the scrum on
  their own 22. 9 min: Moleka drops the restart. USA will have the scrum just
  beyond Australia’s 22. They need to strike back. They get it wide and score!
  After hammering the line with close carries for more than 10 phases, Wood,
  with a penalty advantage, decided to send it wide. The final pass from Moleka
  was swift and Miller, with pace to burn, found the edge and the corner. The
  conversion from out wide is good and the Aussies are up and running. 8 min:
  Australia set the maul but that falters so Wood spirals it wide. They go
  through eight phases. Nine. They’re a metre short with a penalty advantage.
  All short carries. Right under the poles… 5 min: America’s scrum struggled
  against England but they resist a second shove from Australia. Maher has her
  first carry and gets over the gainline. Then they kick but there are chasers
  who strayed beyond the kicker. So Australia get a penalty. Soft from the
  Eagles. halse thumps it out to set up a Walleroo line-out about 10 out. 3 min:
  America keep the ball as chants of ‘USA, USA’ ring out. But another skew kick
  lands in Miller’s pouch and the Aussie winger is carrying hard. Australia are
  up to the 22. They manage to get the ball back from a maul that had formed but
  spill the ball. This already has all the makings of a physical classic. Scrum
  to the Eagles. 2 min: America kick off. Naden carries it up for the Wallaroos.
  Emba has it back for the USA and she skews a kick out. Australian ball but the
  linbe-out is over thrown. Righto, here we go! it’s anthem time. Two
  chest-thumpers. The Aussies belt theirs out first before the Yanks get a go.
  I’m not sure the music was perfectly aligned on either as it seemed the
  players were out of synch. They’re full of smiles though. The Beeb has just
  switched to York where a blustery breeze is blowing scarves and flags. It’s
  starts and stripes and starts and Union Jacks. A reminder that a win here
  would see Australia go through to the quarters. If the USA win they’ll have
  their destiny in their own hands. It’s a sellout at the Community Stadium.
  We’ve had a series of blowouts and one-sided games. I’m expecting this to be
  the first genuinely close contest of the World Cup. That is, if both teams
  deliver. For those just joining us, England crushed Samoa 92-3 in Northampton.
  Here’s Sarah Rendell’s report: Now or never for the Eagles. Defeat would see
  them crash out and take the most marketable rugby player on the planet with
  them. There are nine changes to the team that was swatted aside by England
  last Friday as head coach Sione Fukofuka has rolled the dice for this must-win
  clash. There’s no room for sentiment as three-time Olympian Alev Kelter has
  been dropped. Elsewhere wingers Cheta Emba and Erica Coulibaly will have to
  step up and deal with Australia’s lightening edges. There is plenty of
  pressure on Emily Henrich’s shoulders but the 25-year-old showed last week she
  is more than capable of handling it. Strong in defence and full of power, she
  and Ilona Maher will provide plenty of questions for Australia’s midfield.
  Expect straight running and big collisions. USA: Sharp; Emba, Maher, Henrich,
  Coulibaly, Hawkins, Bargell; Rogers, Treder, Sagapolu, Taufoou,
  Jarrell-Searcey, Tafuna, Zackary (c), Johnson. Replacements: Stathopoulos,
  Leatherman, Jacoby, Ehrecke, Brody, Ortiz, Cantorna, Ibarra. For Australia, it
  is all about getting the job done. Winger Desiree Miller already has three RWC
  2025 tries to her name and will be one to watch, while co-captains Emily
  Chancellor and Kaitlin Leaney continue in the absence of injured Siokapesi
  Palu. Second-row Michaela Leonard is set to win her 40th cap - just the third
  Wallaroo to reach such a mark. A formidable athlete and a former skipper,
  Leonard will be out to stamp her authority on this momentous fixture. “The
  focus is about us, we’ve done a lot coming into this competition around our
  try lines and try line defence and generally our collision dominance,” said
  their coach, Jo Yapp. Australia: Halse; Stewart, Friedrichs, Smith, Miller,
  Moleka, Wood; Pohiva, Nadem O’Gorman, Leaney (c), Leonard, Duck, Chancellor,
  Tuinakauvadra. Replacements: Amosa, Kavoa, Karpini, Codey, Marsters, Morgan,
  Pomare, Hinds. Australia are flying under the radar this World Cup and are
  still a very outside bet at winning the thing. But they’re a team on the rise.
  Don’t be surprised if they do something special this evening. Are mismatches
  bad for the game? Not according to those in charge: England have just thumped
  Samoa. I reckon this will be much, much tighter The equation is simple for the
  USA. Win and they live to fight another day. Lose and the inaugural winners of
  the World Cup will be out of the competition. “This is the game of the round,”
  says our man Aaron Bower. I fully agree. The World Cup has had everything
  apart from jeopardy and close games. This one promises both. The Wallaroos are
  a team on the rise. Quarterfinalists three years ago, they’ve benefited from
  an influx of sevens stars and increased attention and funding. Their most
  recent game against the Eagles ended with a 27-19 victory in the Pacific Four
  Series in May and they’ll be full of confidence after thrashing Samoa in an
  11-try, 73-0 rout. Does that make them favourites? Not accordinng to Alivia
  Leatherman, the USA’s prop who told reporters this week, “We should win,”
  adding, “we have everything we need” to get the result. I love it. I want a
  bit of needle and a bit of chest thumping in the sport I consume and there’ll
  be plenty of that, I’m sure of it. Australia’s coach Jo Yapp has said she’s
  not interested in her team playing “pretty” rugby. All she cares about is the
  win. That sort of do-or-die attitude is what makes World Cups the unmissable
  showstoppers that they are. I can’t wait for this one! Team news, some quality
  reading and other bits and bobs to follow. Kick off is at 7.30pm BST/4.30am
  AEST/2.30pm EDT. Wherever you are in the world I’d love to hear from you.

I’m not exaggerating when I say that was one of the best games of rugby I’ve ever watched. There’s a tendency to over hype the women’s game. To compensate for the unjust inequities, the blatant sexism and the years of neglect. There’s also an understandable need to focus less on results and the quality of rugby and shine a light on the stories of the individuals involved, to champion those heroes who have sacrificed so much to represent their nations. No need on this one. This was just a brilliant, breathtaking dig-dong affair. Two wonderful sides, producing moments of magic with just enough error to keep things open. It was by a distance the game of the tournament and will take some beating before the whole show comes to an end. Luke McLaughlin was fortunate enough to see it with his own eyes in York. Here’s his match report: So, have Australia done enough? If they beat England next week they’re through. That won’t happen. A bonus point for four tries scored or a defeat of seven points or less will also be enough. I don’t either of those things will happen either. So it’ll come down to points differences – in my opinion. Currently the USA are 135 points behind Australia so it would need to be a dramatic swing. Australia beat Samoa 73-0. The USA, you’d think, would need to better that. As Group A stands, England are on top top 10 points. Australia are second with 8. The USA are third with 3. The last word goes to Sione Fukofuka, the USA head coach: I am proud of the players, we went down and fought for the game and I thought we had it as well. You can’t predict Australia. The message is stay in process, stay in position, gain the points and hopefully we beat them. Jo Yapp, the Wallaroos coach, is next on the mic: On the whole we’re a bit disappointed and a bit flat. We let them into the game in the second half where our penalty count allowed them to gain access. Ultimately our discipline let us down and we weren’t very accurate. We have to reflect on that ahead of a big game next week. Now the Eagles captain, Kate Zackary: We knew it was going to be a back and forth match. Every time we got hit we hit back a little harder. That fight is what we’ll carry into the next game. The biggest message is we fought back. We’ve earned ourselves another shot. Let’s get more reaction. Here’s the Aussie skipper, Emily Chancellor: It’s a bit mixed. Right now we’re a little flat because we wanted that game really bad. It feels like both teams lost it. Frustrating. We made it hard for ourselves. We have to go back to the drawing board for England. Our player of the match, hat-trick hero Freda Tafuna, speaks. She doesn’t say much. Thanks to crowd, gives “glory to God” and gives credit to her teammates. Players are in tears. It was that sort of game. I’m just about in tears. Australia had the ball but kicked ahead. Then Sharp mopped up but with her heels just about touching her own try line, and with no mates around her, she decided to kick it out and bring the game to an end. An extraordinary game. It’ll come down to points difference. Australia are on +73. The USA are on -62. Will bonus points make a difference? It ends in a draw! It was an anticlimactic end to what was one of the best games of rugby I’ve ever seen. 80 min: The scrum is clean. The ball flies out to Miller on the left wing who tears up field. Duck has to mop up a loose pass. They’re back inside their own half but still have the ball. They have to go again. 78 min: The USA get a penalty at the scrum! . The USA hoof it out. Not very far, but it is out and they get a line-out that Ehrecke wins. But the Wallaroos win the ball back! They keep the ball tight and unplayable from the maul. They’re a long way out. About 6 metres or so. But they could definitely score. What they don’t want to don’t want to give away another penalty. 77 min: Jarrell-Searcy spills the ball in contact on halfway. Time for a deep breath. I genuinely have no idea which way this is going. Australia have a chance to make some ground and possibly set a drop goal? Maybe eke a kickable penalty? Who knows. I just don’t want this to end. WHAT THE WHAT!!! I can’t remember a more entertaining game of rugby. Australia, from the close line-out, set the maul. It rumbled close, within touching distance. But stalled. So it was up to some strong carries around the fringe. Eventually Karpani decided to take matters in her own hands and barrelled over. Wood missed the conversion. We’re even. Can you believe it?! 73 min: Maher strays offside from a USA clearing kick so Halse drills this penalty into the corner. She’s been so good kicking out of hand. Now the Aussies have a line-out about six out. They have to score. THE USA TAKE THE LEAD! The towering lock has had an immense game and she gets a deserving try with a pick and go from bang in front. It was wave after wave of women in blue crashing over tacklers in green. Rogers – twice – Maher, Brody, just about every player was involved in that. Even Hawkins, who held firm in contact. The conversion from Hawkins is good. Where is this game going? 71 min: The USA go down the blind side after faking the maul. They make metres. Now they spiral the ball from the left wing to the right. They cam back infield. Up to the 22. Rogers with a big carry – she’s had some game in the close quarters. 10 phases. Hawkins has to carry herself. Maher involved. Into the 22. Rogers again over the gainline. They’re 10 short. Brody makes ground…. 69 min: Another penalty on the floor for the Eagles. This one on halfway. Hawkins can’t make great ground with the kick but the line-out gives them a chance to set an attack from inside Australia’s half. TAFUNA GETS A HAT-TRICK! My goodness, what a game! The USA go back to their maul and it pays off. They’re so cohesive and once they get a second shove on there’s no stopping them. Hawkins, from the right, slots the sticks and it’s a two point game. 66 min: The USA get a penalty a metre short of the Australian line. They kept hammering and hammering and hammering at the wall but couldn’t find a breach. Hawkins tried to find Henrich with a cross-field kick coast to coast but skewed it. So we come back for the lengthy advantage which Hawkins nudges to the corner. They have to score here. 63 min: A massive turnover from the Wallaroos defensive maul. The Eagles went back to what worked earlier in the piece but the Aussies were wise to them. They took the intial hit, absorbed the momentum and swamped the ball carrier, denying Bergell a chance to get her hands on it. Australia’s exit play, as it has been all game, is decent though the clearing kick doesn’t find touch. The USA come back at them. 62 min: The USA keep the ball alive in midfield and get a penalty. Nice touches from Taufoou. A stiff carry down the blindside from Maher. Bargell kept it thrumming and Hawkins kicks it out for a line-out throw on the Aussie 22. They need to score here. The teenager bags a brace! Australia are showing their class and stretching their lead. With a penalty advantage they keep the ball in play. Swift hands under pressure from Moleka kept it moving. Miller could have had a dart herself but it was Halse who finishes it off down the left. The conversion from out wide in the left tram is good as well. Sensational stuff from the Wallaroos. What can the Eagles do in response? 59 min: It’s not quite to the corner but Australia win the line-out, and then get a penalty advantage, on the USA’s 22. 56 min: This has been, by a staggering distance, the best game of the competition. I’m thrilled to be calling it. The USA are back on the ball though Wood manages to charge down Bargell’s box kick. Then there’s a knock on from an American so it’s Australia who will get the scrum feed inside American territory. My goodness, momentum is moving this way and that the arm of a grandfather clock. Australia win the scrum penalty and will surely nudge it to the corner. A DOUBLE FOR MILLER! What a game we have on our hands. Tuinakauvadra won a penalty on the floor straight from the restart which was kicked to the right corner. Australia got the maul rumbling before playing out the back with Moleka spiralling a long pass to Miller. The winger squared up her defender, put in a strong hand off and slid over in the left corner. What a finish! The conversion is missed but the Aussies are back in front. The Eagles maul over! They’re in the lead thanks to a formidable rumbling maul that was formed quickly and stayed connected even after the Wallaroos looked to fracture the pack. Tafuna was not to be denied as she wrestled the ball down following a second burst. This time Hawkins slots the extras from out to the right. What a comeback from the Americans. Momentum is all with them. 50 min: The USA from the line-out are motoring forward with Sagapolu once more on the ball. But Friedrichs strips the ball loose and now the Wallaroos are on the attack. Possession changes once more. Ding dong stuff from both teams. Bargell box kicks and causes trouble for the Australian back three though tghey eventually mop up. But there’s another penalty on the ground! Maher once more. She’s such a menace at the breakdown. Hawkins hoofs it towards the corner. The USA are on fire in this second half. 48 min: Halse runs onto a high ball and catches it while sliding. That is impressive work from the fullback. Australia recycle the ball down the line where Miller has it be she is swamped by women in blue. The USA get in and win another penalty on the floor. Momentum all with them once more. They win the line-out with Zackary inside Australia’s half and set another attack. They’re over! It’s the big prop who busts over. Johnson came close moments earlier but the Australian defence held firm. But there was no stopping Sagapolu. Brilliant build up as the Americans showed greater patience through the phases. The conversion hits both posts but doesn’t go over. Hawkins really should have slotted that. 44 min: Taufoou wins another penalty and Australia give another penalty. That’s three in a row already this half. Hawkins unfurls a cross kick which Emba plucks from the air to keep the move alive. Maher goes in to clean the ruck and picks the ball up herself. They’re up to the 22. Johnson’s pass is almost intercepted but the Americans find the edge on the left with Coulibaly running full tilt. They’re about seven short now. Five with a strong close carry. Three. They’re so close. 42 min: No changes for either side at the break. Moleka’s restart is low and flat and soon after the Eagle’s win a penalty on the floor. Hawkins, now kicking into the wind, can’t make too much ground with her punt but the USA have the line throw which Taufoou wins. They set the maul before Henrich gets over the gainline. Another penalty against Australia for holding onto the tackler. Bargell, who has had a good game, stays prone on the ground clutching her torso. The players are back on the field. This is going to be epic. There’s so little between the teams but the Americans are edging a few of the stats. They’d made more metres in the carry, have made more runs with ball in hand, had had greater success at the ruck and have dominated territory. But they’d not been able to capitalise and must now produce a massive 40 minute performance if they want to take part in the quarterfinals. Shoutout to Paul Hughes who is keeping in touch with the rugby, and writing in, from Kyiv. Hope you’re well Paul and thanks for your email. Nope, they decide they’ve had enough and punt it out after winning the scrum. Brilliant game. I’d be staggered if a better 40 has been played this World Cup. Australia took their chances. The USA coughed up too many of theirs. That’s the difference as the two teams head into the sheds with the game in the balance. 40 min: Sharp spills a bouncing ball so Australia have a scrum inside the Eagles’ turf and a chance to add more points before the break. What a try! Brilliant from the Wallaroos. Naden went short with the line-out. Then the maul was set. The Americans held firm so Wood sent it towards the midfield where Halse, up from fullback, joined the line with a superb run and found a gap to slide under the poles. Wood took an age to convert from right in front but she made no mistake. 38 min: The clearing kick from Hawkins doesn’t go very far. Just to the 22 where Australia will have the line-out throw. It’s too long and the USA come away with it. But there’s a penalty against the Eagles. Was that obstruction? Halse doesn’t ask questions. She punts to the corner once more. Naden has to find her jumper five out. 36 min: From the line-out close to halfway Smith and then Maher carry through midfield for the USA. But there’s a spill in contact so now Australia have a scrum feed with space on both sides and wingers primed. A slightly shorter blindside down the left with both Halse and Moleka standing right behind the scrum. They do go left for Miller who makes great ground. Now they go right through the hands. Back towards the left. Wood is zipping it across the park. Seven phases. Halse involved throughout. Tafuna lands a big hit but the Aussies continue. Duck finds an opening, she’s into the 22 but loses her footing. Australia retain possession and look for Stewart on the right wing but the flat pass is not accruate and goes straight out. The USA will have the throw deep inside their own 22. 33 min: The USA win a penalty on the ground! The Aussies won the line-out but couldn’t set the maul. Duck charged and was knocked back. Australia stuck with the blindside which played into the hands of the Americans who had the numbers to get over the ball and win the relieving penalty. 31 min: Like the USA’s line-out, the Australian scrum has worked as it should. It gives Moleka a platform to hoof a long kick forward. Sharp carries it back for the Eagles and is nailed by Duck (insert your own joke here). That forces the mistake and the Wallaroos swarm, winning the turnover on the deck. Halse finds touch five out. Chance to strike back. 29 min: Another penalty goes the way of the USA. Straight from the restart, Australia lose their cool and feet at the breakdown. A free exit for the USA who once again win the line-out. Tafuna with another big carry – she’s having a stormer of a game. Momentum all with the Americans. Up to halfway. Hawkins tries to force the issue as she looks for an edge but the ball drifts forward as she tries to find Zackary – also having a stormer – on the support line. Swift line speed from the Aussies was the difference there. They’re there! You can’t say they don’t deserve that. It started with a ropey line-out that found prop Sagapolu at the back. He held on before passing to her skipper Zackary who stormed forward, making great ground. From there they needed to secure they ball. They did before Tafuna powered over from close range. The wind blew the ball off the tee as Wawkins went to convert and she ran out of time before she could reset. 26 min: The USA’s line-out has functioned well and Jarrell hauls down another one. Duck puts in a monster hit but soon strays off side as she searches for quick line speed. This time Hawkins finds touch inside the Wallaroos turf. This line-out doesn’t work but it still lands in Sagapolu’s hands. She feeds it on for Zackary who storms forward, what a run that is from the skipper. They’re now five out. penalty advantage… 24 min: Moleka shows great hands and times her pass for Miller to her left to perfection. They’re working the blindside well until an Australian hand spills it in contact. Bergell box kicks. Australia come back until Maher stoops low to make the turnover on the deck. 23 min: A big bomb of a kick is allowed to bounce by the Wallaroos back three and Zackary tears after it. She can’t get there but that is a sign that the bounce of a ball could be the difference tonight. Oh, they’re coming back for another look at a Tuinakauvadra tackle earlier in the piece. Seems she’ll get away with it despite it looking high. It is a penalty but the USA make another mistake, not finding touch with the kick. 22 min: Wood nails a clearing kick after Australia’s scrum provides the platform and gives her space to do so. A great bounce means the ball bobbles out inside the USA’s patch. The Americans have the libne-out but cough up possession. Now Australia are on the charge with Tuinakauvadra carrying with intent. Seven phases go left then back towards the right, inching forwards. Wood delays her pass as she waits for her mates to find their shape. Halse gets her head up and sees open space towards the left wing and puts in a lovely kick for Miller to chase. The ball drifts over Emba’s head but bounces out before Miller can grab it. 19 min: This time Australia’s clearing kick doesn’t find touch and Emba grabs the bouncing ball and runs it back. The Eagles keep the ball until Bargell tries an audacious pop pass back inside from the base of a ruck and finds nothing but air. It’s so rushed. Not sure why. They’re bossing the point of contact and playing some neat rugby. They just need to show a bit more patience. Easy to say from here, to be fair. 16 min: Australia’s scrum, like their scramble defence, is holding. It gives Moleka a platform to set her clearing kick from inside her 22. She gets a good piece of it but the wind spirals it out shorter than she was aiming. USA win the line-out off the top and attack through their midfield. Maher again with a carry. Sharp joins from fullback. Emba has it on the right win but is bundled out of touch after a double tackle with Miller playing the lead role. The Australian defence really has been impressive. 15 min: Australia win the scrum and carry away with Smith. But Maher makes an incredible steal after making the tackle and the USA have the ball back inside Australia’s 22. They panic and rush things, yet again spilling the ball. How many times are they going to blow opportunities? 13 min: Australia’s exit play is slick with Halse thumping a clearing kick from her own 22 and putting it out 25 metres up field. The USA’s line-out is just as slick as they go off the top and crash through midfield with Maher. Bargell picks and snipes around the fringe. They’re into the 22. Prop Sagapolu carries. So does no. 8 Johnson. Over 10 phases now and they’re 10 metres short. But yet again it’s so sloppy. A nothing pass to no-one is spilled forward and that is a huge let-off for the Aussies. The Eagles are currently their own worst enemies. 10 min: The scrum was good and Henrich and Tafuna both had stiff carries. But the skipper, Zackary, drops the ball under no pressure, taking her eyes off it at the crucial moment. Soft possession switch there. Australia have the scrum on their own 22. 9 min: Moleka drops the restart. USA will have the scrum just beyond Australia’s 22. They need to strike back. They get it wide and score! After hammering the line with close carries for more than 10 phases, Wood, with a penalty advantage, decided to send it wide. The final pass from Moleka was swift and Miller, with pace to burn, found the edge and the corner. The conversion from out wide is good and the Aussies are up and running. 8 min: Australia set the maul but that falters so Wood spirals it wide. They go through eight phases. Nine. They’re a metre short with a penalty advantage. All short carries. Right under the poles… 5 min: America’s scrum struggled against England but they resist a second shove from Australia. Maher has her first carry and gets over the gainline. Then they kick but there are chasers who strayed beyond the kicker. So Australia get a penalty. Soft from the Eagles. halse thumps it out to set up a Walleroo line-out about 10 out. 3 min: America keep the ball as chants of ‘USA, USA’ ring out. But another skew kick lands in Miller’s pouch and the Aussie winger is carrying hard. Australia are up to the 22. They manage to get the ball back from a maul that had formed but spill the ball. This already has all the makings of a physical classic. Scrum to the Eagles. 2 min: America kick off. Naden carries it up for the Wallaroos. Emba has it back for the USA and she skews a kick out. Australian ball but the linbe-out is over thrown. Righto, here we go! it’s anthem time. Two chest-thumpers. The Aussies belt theirs out first before the Yanks get a go. I’m not sure the music was perfectly aligned on either as it seemed the players were out of synch. They’re full of smiles though. The Beeb has just switched to York where a blustery breeze is blowing scarves and flags. It’s starts and stripes and starts and Union Jacks. A reminder that a win here would see Australia go through to the quarters. If the USA win they’ll have their destiny in their own hands. It’s a sellout at the Community Stadium. We’ve had a series of blowouts and one-sided games. I’m expecting this to be the first genuinely close contest of the World Cup. That is, if both teams deliver. For those just joining us, England crushed Samoa 92-3 in Northampton. Here’s Sarah Rendell’s report: Now or never for the Eagles. Defeat would see them crash out and take the most marketable rugby player on the planet with them. There are nine changes to the team that was swatted aside by England last Friday as head coach Sione Fukofuka has rolled the dice for this must-win clash. There’s no room for sentiment as three-time Olympian Alev Kelter has been dropped. Elsewhere wingers Cheta Emba and Erica Coulibaly will have to step up and deal with Australia’s lightening edges. There is plenty of pressure on Emily Henrich’s shoulders but the 25-year-old showed last week she is more than capable of handling it. Strong in defence and full of power, she and Ilona Maher will provide plenty of questions for Australia’s midfield. Expect straight running and big collisions. USA: Sharp; Emba, Maher, Henrich, Coulibaly, Hawkins, Bargell; Rogers, Treder, Sagapolu, Taufoou, Jarrell-Searcey, Tafuna, Zackary (c), Johnson. Replacements: Stathopoulos, Leatherman, Jacoby, Ehrecke, Brody, Ortiz, Cantorna, Ibarra. For Australia, it is all about getting the job done. Winger Desiree Miller already has three RWC 2025 tries to her name and will be one to watch, while co-captains Emily Chancellor and Kaitlin Leaney continue in the absence of injured Siokapesi Palu. Second-row Michaela Leonard is set to win her 40th cap - just the third Wallaroo to reach such a mark. A formidable athlete and a former skipper, Leonard will be out to stamp her authority on this momentous fixture. “The focus is about us, we’ve done a lot coming into this competition around our try lines and try line defence and generally our collision dominance,” said their coach, Jo Yapp. Australia: Halse; Stewart, Friedrichs, Smith, Miller, Moleka, Wood; Pohiva, Nadem O’Gorman, Leaney (c), Leonard, Duck, Chancellor, Tuinakauvadra. Replacements: Amosa, Kavoa, Karpini, Codey, Marsters, Morgan, Pomare, Hinds. Australia are flying under the radar this World Cup and are still a very outside bet at winning the thing. But they’re a team on the rise. Don’t be surprised if they do something special this evening. Are mismatches bad for the game? Not according to those in charge: England have just thumped Samoa. I reckon this will be much, much tighter The equation is simple for the USA. Win and they live to fight another day. Lose and the inaugural winners of the World Cup will be out of the competition. “This is the game of the round,” says our man Aaron Bower. I fully agree. The World Cup has had everything apart from jeopardy and close games. This one promises both. The Wallaroos are a team on the rise. Quarterfinalists three years ago, they’ve benefited from an influx of sevens stars and increased attention and funding. Their most recent game against the Eagles ended with a 27-19 victory in the Pacific Four Series in May and they’ll be full of confidence after thrashing Samoa in an 11-try, 73-0 rout. Does that make them favourites? Not accordinng to Alivia Leatherman, the USA’s prop who told reporters this week, “We should win,” adding, “we have everything we need” to get the result. I love it. I want a bit of needle and a bit of chest thumping in the sport I consume and there’ll be plenty of that, I’m sure of it. Australia’s coach Jo Yapp has said she’s not interested in her team playing “pretty” rugby. All she cares about is the win. That sort of do-or-die attitude is what makes World Cups the unmissable showstoppers that they are. I can’t wait for this one! Team news, some quality reading and other bits and bobs to follow. Kick off is at 7.30pm BST/4.30am AEST/2.30pm EDT. Wherever you are in the world I’d love to hear from you.
