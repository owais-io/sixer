  The EU is a step closer to closing a controversial trade deal with South
  America’s Mercosur bloc first mooted 25 years ago. The deal will be presented
  to the European Commission college of commissioners later today for approval.
  But it must be approved by EU members and is expected to resurface divisions
  between Germany and France, which has strongly opposed the deal in the past,
  arguing farmers needed protection rather than more competition. The arrival of
  Donald Trump in the White House means others who have in the past sided with
  France, such as Ireland, may now give it their support. The European Union and
  the bloc of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay dragged the free trade
  agreement over the line last December, some 25 years after negotiations were
  launched. Just in: The UK service sector grew more strongly than first
  estimated last month. Data firm S&amp;P Global has reported that service
  sector output rose at the steepest rate since April 2024 in August. Output
  growth accelerated, and new orders rebounded, they say, lifting business
  optimism rises to a 10-month high. This pushed the S&amp;P Global UK Services
  PMI Business Activity Index up to 54.2 in August, up from 51.8 in July. That’s
  the highest reading for 16 months, and better than the ‘flash’ reading of 53.0
  recorded in mid-August. Encouragingly, UK services firms reported the first
  rise in new export orders since March, led by rising sales to clients in the
  EU and US. Tim Moore, economics director at S&amp;P Global Market
  Intelligence, says: “August data highlights a welcome acceleration of output
  growth and a swift rebound in order books after July’s dip, leaving the UK
  service economy on a much stronger footing as the end of summer comes into
  view.” Back in the bond market, UK government borrowing costs have dipped back
  a little after hitting their highest level since 1998. The yield, or interest
  rate, on 30-year gilts jumped as high as 5.75% at 8.45am today, but has since
  slipped back to 5.71%, still a little higher than yesterday’s close.
  Newsflash: Rachel Reeves’s autumn budget will take place on 26 November, the
  Treasury has announced. The late November budget date will give the chancellor
  time to prepare the ground for potential tax changes, and address the likely
  budget ‘black hole’ that could have been widened by the sell-off in the bond
  markets. My colleague Richard Partington explains: Reeves is understood to
  have been exploring several tax-raising measures over the summer months amid
  concern that rising borrowing costs, a sluggish growth outlook, higher
  inflation and welfare U-turns could expose a shortfall in the government
  finances worth up to £40bn. The chancellor and the prime minister have,
  however, committed to sticking to Labour’s manifesto promise not to raise
  taxes on “working people”, including through income tax, national insurance
  and VAT. The latest healthcheck on Europe’s economy won’t calm fears that
  growth remains sluggish. A survey of purchasing managers at euro area
  companies has found that the eurozone economy continued to expand at a
  sluggish pace last month, with growth slowing in the services sector. Data
  firm S&amp;P Global’s Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks activity across
  the economy, has risen to 51.0 for August, up from 50.9 in July. That’s a
  12-month high, but still only slightly above the 50-point mark showing
  stagnation. Dr Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank,
  says: “Riding a bike too slowly can make you tip over. That’s the risk facing
  the eurozone. Yes, the economy has been growing since the start of the year,
  but the pace is painfully slow. In August, the HCOB Composite PMI Business
  Activity Index stood at 51.0 – barely above stall speed. Political tensions in
  France and Spain, uncertainty around the EU-US trade deal, and ongoing
  troubles in the key automotive sector aren’t helping. On the bright side,
  increased defense spending across Europe and Germany’s infrastructure program
  offer hope that the economy might keep moving forward – and avoid falling off
  the bike. Right now, the services sector feels more like stagflation than
  recovery. The rate of expansion has slipped even further from an already slow
  pace, while cost pressures have increased and selling price inflation nudged
  slightly higher We should note that the sell-off in UK government bonds has
  focused on longer-dated debt. Five-year gilts, for example, are little changed
  today. The yield on these shorter-dated UK bonds did rise yesterday, to nearly
  4.2%, but that’s only the highest level since late May. America’s long-term
  borrowing costs are also rising. The yield, or interest rate, on US 30-year
  Treasury bonds has hit 5% today, for the first time since July, as the global
  bond sell-off refuses to abate. Speculation is growing that the
  eagerly-awaited UK autumn budget may be delivered on 26 November. Huffington
  Post UK reported last night that Rachel Reeves has pencilled in November 26
  for the date of the Budget, and that it won’t happen before mid-November at
  the earliest. The government must give the Office for Budget Responsibility at
  least 10 weeks notice to conduct its assessment of the government’s tax and
  spending plans, so the OBR can give its verdict once the budget speech has
  been delivered. Bloomberg say Reeves is expected to announce the November date
  for unveiling her spending plan later today. City consultancy Capital
  Economics predicted yesterday that Reeves could need to fill a ‘black hole’ of
  between £18b and £28bn, likely mostly through higher taxes. Rising bond yields
  would inflate that black hole, by adding to the projected cost of UK
  borrowing. Britain’s long-term borrowing costs have just hit a new 27-year
  high, as the pressure on Rachel Reeves refuses to abate. The yield, or
  interest rate, on 30-year UK gilts has risen to 5.747% this morning, above the
  high of 5.723% hit yesterday. This rise, during a global sell-off of
  long-dated government debt, continues to highlight the challenge facing the
  chancellor ahead of the autumn budget. Ten-year gilt yields, which are more
  representative of the rate at which the British government now borrows, have
  risen to their highest since January this morning. Rising borrowing costs will
  intensify the pressure on the chancellor to announce spending cuts or tax
  rises, to satisfy the UK’s fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget
  Responsibility, that she is keeping within the fiscal rules. Thomas Pugh,
  chief economist at leading audit, tax and consulting firm RSM UK, says,
  investors are clearly worried about the long-term trajectory of the UK debt
  burden. Pugh fears the UK is close to a ‘debt trap’, but doesn’t believe it
  will be foreced into an IMF bailout as some have suggested, explaining: If
  Chancellor Rachel Reeves is tempted to loosen [the UK fiscal rules] in the
  Autumn Budget in a way that raises the UK’s debt trajectory, then financial
  markets are likely to push gilt yields even higher, further increasing the
  interest-rate bill. “This is increasingly important because the UK is arguably
  close to a debt trap. That happens when the interest rate on a country’s debt
  is higher than its nominal growth rate. The result is that the debt pile grows
  faster than the economy. If that happens, then the debt-to-GDP ratio grows
  every year, even if borrowing doesn’t increase, making it extremely hard to
  escape without painful measures. “The cash size of the UK economy is likely to
  grow by 3.5–4% a year (1.5% real growth, plus 2.5% inflation), over the next
  few years. But, the average interest rate on UK government debt is about 3.9%.
  This leaves very little room for error. “That said, warnings of a 1970s-style
  economic crash and a trip to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are
  overdone. The UK’s recent tax rises mean that the debt-to-GDP ratio is likely
  to stabilise over the rest of the decade rather than continue to rise. What’s
  more, inflation and interest rates will probably fall a little further next
  year, helping to ease the burden. In any case, the UK has the second-lowest
  debt-to-GDP ratio in the G7, so there is room for it to rise further if needs
  be in the short-term. The gold price has climbed to a new record high today,
  as investors seek out a safe haven. The spot price of gold has hit $3,546.99
  per ounce, on track for its seventh daily rise in a row. Gold’s role as a
  hedge against inflation and fiscal concerns “remains firmly in play”, says Jim
  Reid, market strategist at Deutsche Bank. Australia’s stock market has
  suffered its biggest one-day drop since April today, as the bond sell-off
  rattles traders. The S&amp;P/ASX share index has fallen by 1.8% today, to its
  lowest level since early August, despite new data showing Australia’s economy
  grew faster than expected in the second qwuarter of the year. Kyle Rodda,
  senior financial market analyst at Capital.com, argues that the markets were
  due a pull back: Seasonality has entered the narrative: for US equities,
  September is the worst month of the year for the S&amp;P 500, with an average
  drawdown of nearly 2% over the past 10 years. But from an Australian and
  fundamental standpoint, valuations have been eye-watering and far beyond what
  could be justified by the earnings that were served up by companies last
  month. On top of that, higher global bond yields are putting the squeeze on
  global equity prices. Yields are being driven by a combination of factors:
  political risk in the US and Europe, loose and arguably unsustainable fiscal
  settings across several major sovereigns, and upside risks to inflation in the
  States as traders price-in the risk of a US Fed being stacked with Trump-loyal
  policy doves. Shifting rate expectations in Australia probably also
  contributed to the ASX200’s sell-off. Australian GDP data was stronger than
  expected, with annual growth rising 1.8% in the June quarter. The pound is
  dropping in early trading, adding to sharp losses yesterday. Sterling has
  dropped by a quarter of a cent to $1.3366, close to the one-month low touched
  on Tuesday. Yesterday the pound lost one and a half cents, its biggest daily
  drop since April, as the drop in government bond prices rocked the markets.
  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial
  markets and the world economy. The global sell-off in longer-term government
  debt is continuing, as concerns mount over fiscal sustainability and the
  health of the global economy. After losses across the bond and equity markets
  yesterday, there are fresh falls in Asia-Pacific markets today. Japan is now
  in the firing line from bond vigilantes, who are driving up borrowing costs
  (yields) by selling government debt, pushing down prices. The 30-year Japanese
  government bond yield has hit an unprecedented 3.255% today, Reuters reports,
  following the jump in UK, US and eurozone bond yields on Tuesday Yields on
  Japan’s 20-year government bonds rose to levels last seen in 1999. The
  sell-off appears to be being driven by several factors, including concerns
  over rising government debt levels, opposition to measures to cut borrowing,
  sticky inflation, and economic growth prospects. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior
  analyst at Swissquote Bank, explains: Investors are demanding higher returns
  to hold bonds exposed to both inflation risk and elevated debt levels. Higher
  yields, in turn, push up borrowing costs for companies and weigh on
  valuations. As a result, equities and corporate bonds also kicked off the week
  on a weak note. Bond investors will be watching London and Paris closely
  today. Rising bond yields are a political headache for Rachel Reeves, as it
  eats into the UK chancellor’s headroom to have debt falling in five years’
  time. It could force Reeves into further tax rises, despite concerns that this
  would weaken growth, or spending cuts, despite opposition from her own party.
  The potential collapse of the French government next week, in a row over
  proposed spending cuts, are also worrying investors. Mujtaba Rahman, managing
  director for Europe at Eurasia Group, explains: The French Prime Minister
  François Bayrou will lose on Monday 8 September a gamble that he was never
  likely to win and will almost certainly be ejected from office by a
  parliamentary confidence vote of his own choosing; President Emmanuel Macron
  has ruled out a new legislative election—for the time being—and will appoint
  his fifth Prime Minister in 21 months, almost certainly from within his center
  and center-right coalition. The new PM will be obliged to make concessions on
  Bayrou’s ambitious plans to cut 0.8% of GDP (nominally €43.8bn) from France’s
  deficit next year. The agenda 9am BST: Eurozone service sector PMI for August
