  I found Paul Daley’s opinion piece on displaying human remains an interesting
  read (Times change, so do people. So why does the British Museum still think
  it’s OK to display human remains?, 6 August). I am always glad to discuss the
  reasons why museums retain and display human remains. First, I completely
  agree that human remains taken by colonial powers should be repatriated rather
  than displayed in international institutions. I disagree strongly, however,
  with the idea that there is no value (aside from shock value) to displaying
  human remains. Through museums it is possible to learn about death and human
  remains in a respectful way – without the gore you often find in the media. At
  Folkestone Museum, we display the human remains of an Anglo-Saxon woman from a
  cemetery on the hill above our town. She was exhumed during an excavation in
  1908. The rest of the skeletons excavated from that cemetery were collected
  together in a single tea chest and reburied, which I don’t consider especially
  respectful. I believe that by telling our skeleton’s story in as complete a
  way as we can, through our research, display and educational work, we can
  honour her memory best. Through this work, our skeleton has become beloved to
  generations of visitors to the museum. For over a hundred years, she has
  inspired people to learn more about the past and at least one person has
  become an archaeologist after meeting her. Our work aims to help visitors
  build empathy with the people who lived before us and our skeleton is an
  important part of that work. Daley writes of “the purported scientific
  benefits of holding such specimens” – but doesn’t address these substantially.
  As scientific techniques improve, our skeleton at Folkestone will continue to
  contribute to our knowledge of the ancient world. Her DNA is currently part of
  a large scientific study. If we reburied her, we would lose a huge amount of
  future knowledge and understanding about the past, about her and about her
  community. Coralie Clover Museum manager and curator, Folkestone town council
