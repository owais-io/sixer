  Exposure to pornography has increased since the introduction of UK rules to
  protect the public online, with children as young as six seeing it by
  accident, research by the children’s commissioner for England has found. Dame
  Rachel de Souza said a survey found that more young people said they had been
  exposed to pornography before the age of 18 than in 2023, when the Online
  Safety Act became law. More than a quarter (27%) now said they had seen porn
  online by 11, with some saying they were “aged six or younger” when asked
  about their first exposure. The findings follow on from a similar survey
  carried out by the children’s commissioner in 2023, and de Souza said they
  showed that little had improved despite the new law and promises from
  ministers and tech firms. She said: “Violent pornography is easily accessible
  to children, exposure is often accidental and often via the most common social
  media sites, and it is impacting children’s behaviours and beliefs in deeply
  concerning ways. “This report must be a line in the sand. New protections
  introduced in July by Ofcom, part of the Online Safety Act, provide a real
  opportunity to make children’s safety online a non-negotiable priority for
  everyone: policymakers, big tech giants and smaller tech developers.” The
  findings are from a nationally representative survey of 1,010 children and
  young people aged 16-21 carried out in May, shortly before the introduction of
  Ofcom’s children’s codes in July. The rules introduced by Ofcom have
  introduced significant changes to make it tougher for under-18-year-olds to
  access porn websites. Using the same methodology and questions as the 2023
  survey to ensure consistency, it found: More young people said they had seen
  porn before the age of 18 in 2025 (70%) compared with 2023 (64%). More than a
  quarter (27%) said they had seen porn online by 11. The average age a child
  first sees pornography remained 13. More vulnerable children had seen
  pornography earlier. Children who received free school meals, those with a
  social worker, those with special educational needs and those with
  disabilities – both physical and mental – were more likely to have seen online
  porn by 11 than their peers. Nearly half of respondents (44%) agreed with the
  statement “Girls may say no at first but then can be persuaded to have sex”.
  Further analysis showed that 54% of girls and 41% of boys who had seen porn
  online agreed with the statement, compared with 46% of girls and 30% of boys
  who had not seen porn – indicating a link between porn exposure and attitudes.
  More respondents said they had seen pornography online by accident (59%) than
  said they had deliberately sought it out (35%). The proportion of children
  accidentally seeing porn was 21 points higher than in 2023 (59% v 38%).
  Networking and social media sites accounted for 80% of the main sources by
  which children accessed porn. X was the most common source of pornography for
  children, outstripping dedicated porn sites. The gap between the number of
  children seeing pornography on X and those seeing it on dedicated porn sites
  has widened (45% v 35% in 2025, compared with 41% v 37% in 2023). Most
  respondents had seen depictions of acts that are illegal under existing
  pornography laws or will become illegal through the crime and policing bill.
  More than half (58%) had seen porn depicting strangulation, 44% reported
  having seen depictions of sex while asleep, and 36% had seen someone not
  consenting to or refusing a sex act, before they turned 18. Further analysis
  found low numbers of children sought out violent or extreme content, meaning
  it was being served up to children, not that they were actively seeking it
  out. The report expresses concern that even under the new rules, children will
  be able to circumvent restrictions by downloading a virtual private network
  (VPN), which remains legal software in the UK. The report recommends that
  online pornography should meet the same requirements as offline pornography;
  that the depiction of non-fatal strangulation should be outlawed; and that the
  Department for Education should provide schools with the support needed to
  implement the new relationships, health and sex education curriculum. It
  emerged last week that the number of people in the UK visiting the most
  popular pornography sites had decreased sharply since enhanced age
  verification rules came into force. The data analytics firm Similarweb said
  the leading adult site Pornhub lost more than 1 million visitors in just two
  weeks. Pornhub and other major adult websites introduced advanced age checks
  on 25 July after the Online Safety Act said sites must make it harder for
  under-18s to see explicit material. Similarweb compared the daily average user
  figures of popular pornography sites from 1 to 9 August with the daily average
  figures for July. Pornhub is the UK’s most visited website for adult content
  and it had a 47% decrease in traffic in the country between 24 July, one day
  before the new rules came into place, and 8 August, according to Similarweb’s
  data. A government spokesperson said: “Children have been left to grow up in a
  lawless online world for too long, bombarded with pornography and harmful
  content that can scar them for life. The Online Safety Act is changing that.
  “Let’s be clear: VPNs are legal tools for adults and there are no plans to ban
  them. But if platforms deliberately push workarounds like VPNs to children,
  they face tough enforcement and heavy fines. We will not allow corporate
  interests to come before child safety. This is about drawing a line – no more
  excuses, no more loopholes. Protecting children online must come first.”
