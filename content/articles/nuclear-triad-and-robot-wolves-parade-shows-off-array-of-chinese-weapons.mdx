  It was hardly a subtle attempt to project power. China showed off air-, sea-
  and land-launched nuclear weapons in its parade on Wednesday, a triad intended
  to demonstrate that Beijing’s long-term aspiration is to match US military
  might. Also on display were large underwater torpedo-like drones, intended to
  threaten western warships, as well as anti-drone lasers and four-legged “robot
  wolves”, all designed to be noticed, regardless of their actual military
  effectiveness. Though China last fought a war in 1979 – a month-long conflict
  with Vietnam – it has been pursuing a sweeping military modernisation for a
  generation, increasing its defence budget by 13 times in dollar terms since
  the mid-1990s, while it threatens independent Taiwan with drills nearby. At
  the heart of the parade was the nuclear formation, a deliberately ominous
  collection of missile launchers in batches of four on vast trucks, with easily
  visible designations written in the Roman alphabet to aid western observers.
  China’s Xinhua news agency said it was the first time Beijing had presented
  its nuclear triad, weapons it said were “China’s strategic ‘ace’ power to
  safeguard the country’s sovereignty and nation’s dignity”. They included four
  new DF-61 intercontinental nuclear ballistic missiles, each carried on 16
  wheel trucks. It was unclear if they were armed. These were the “main
  surprise” for western analysts, according to Hans Kristensen, of the
  Federation of American Scientists. The newly presented missile’s range was
  roughly estimated at 7,500 miles based on its predecessor, the DL-41 – enough
  to reach Washington from Beijing. It is one of eight or nine Chinese ballistic
  missiles with an intercontinental range, raising questions of overkill. “How
  many ways do they have to be able to launch an intercontinental ballistic
  missile to deter?” Kristensen said. Trundling along with it were new JL-3
  ballistics for China’s six Jin-class submarines with a range of 6,200 miles or
  more. And, to complete the triad, China’s first-ever air-launched nuclear
  weapon, the JL-1, meaning Beijing joins a nuclear club composed of the US,
  Russia, India and probably Israel. China’s nuclear arsenal is growing faster
  than any other country’s: it has an estimated 600 warheads, which is
  increasing at a rate of 100 a year, according to the Stockholm International
  Peace Research Institute. Its goal is to reach 1,500 by 2035, according to
  Washington, though even at that point Beijing’s arsenal would be smaller than
  that of the US or Russia, both of which have more than 5,000 warheads in their
  stocks. However, such is the destructive power of nuclear weapons that a
  handful of warheads could kill hundreds of thousands, or more. Other novel
  weapons shown off included two models of extra-large underwater drones,
  measuring 18 to 20 metres, including the AJX002, carried on specially
  elongated eight-wheeled trucks, part of a strategic weapons programme. Their
  size means they are vastly different to the small sea drones that Ukraine has
  used in swarms to knock out vessels in Russia’s Black Sea fleet, and their
  capabilities are less than clear. But the intention is to pose a threat, and
  to be seen to be posing a threat, to the traditional US dominance of the
  Pacific. Two types of laser air defence weapons were displayed, one for ships
  and one based on land, a cheaper means of fending off drones that western
  militaries are already hoping to use. Britain plans to fit four warships with
  a DragonFire laser from 2027, to better protect the vessels from drones used
  by the Houthi rebels in Yemen. A handful of spindly four-legged land drones
  called robot wolves also attracted attention. However, if they could march,
  they were not allowed to, and instead were mounted on the back of other moving
  vehicles. At a glance they appeared no more sophisticated than the growing
  number of land drones appearing on the battlefields of Ukraine, as remotely
  controlled fighters or trucks to rescue the wounded, though China’s industrial
  capacity is such that a viable product could probably be made in vast numbers
  and possibly supplied to Russia.
