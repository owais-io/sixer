  A federal judge ruled on Thursday that Donald Trump’s former lawyer, Alina
  Habba, has been unlawfully serving as the top federal prosecutor in New
  Jersey. In his order disqualifying Habba from prosecuting three defendants who
  challenged her appointment, chief US district judge Matthew Brann wrote: “The
  Executive branch has perpetuated Alina Habba’s appointment to act as the
  United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey through a novel series
  of legal and personnel moves. “Along the way, it has disagreed with the Judges
  of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey and
  criminal defendants in that District about who should or may lead the office.
  Faced with the question of whether Ms Habba is lawfully performing the
  functions and duties of the office of the United States Attorney for the
  District of New Jersey, I conclude that she is not.” The judge found that
  Habba’s term as the interim US attorney ended in July, and the Trump
  administration’s maneuvers to keep her in the role without getting
  confirmation from the US Senate did not follow procedures required by federal
  law. Brann said he was putting his order on hold pending an appeal. Habba, who
  unsuccessfully defended Trump in his New York fraud trial, also served as a
  frequent campaign surrogate for him in 2024. After being appointed to the
  interim role in March, she said the state could “turn red”, a rare overt
  political expression from a prosecutor, and said she planned to investigate
  the state’s Democratic governor and attorney general. She then brought a
  trespassing charge, which was eventually dropped, against Newark’s mayor, Ras
  Baraka, stemming from a confrontation with federal agents during his visit to
  an immigration detention center. Habba later charged a Democratic US
  representative, LaMonica McIver, with assault for resisting the detention of
  the mayor in the same incident, a rare federal criminal case against a sitting
  member of Congress other than for corruption. McIver denies the charges and
  has pleaded not guilty. In late July, when Habba’s four-month temporary
  appointment was coming to a close, it became clear that she would not get
  support from home state senators Cory Booker and Andy Kim, both Democrats,
  meaning her chances of Senate approval were nil. Trump then withdrew her
  nomination, and federal judges in New Jersey exercised their power under the
  law to replace Habba with a career prosecutor when Habba’s temporary
  appointment lapsed. The attorney general, Pam Bondi, retaliated by firing that
  prosecutor and moved to re-install Habba as acting US attorney. Associated
