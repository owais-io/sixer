  Trent Alexander-Arnold has been left out of the England squad by Thomas
  Tuchel. The Real Madrid player’s omission was the most striking decision by
  the head coach, who has given first call-ups to Elliot Anderson and Djed
  Spence. Kyle Walker, Phil Foden and Jack Grealish are also not in the squad
  for World Cup qualifiers at home to Andorra and away to Serbia. Marcus
  Rashford and Adam Wharton have returned, together with Marc Guéhi, Tino
  Livramento, Jarrod Bowen and John Stones. In May Tuchel warned
  Alexander-Arnold he must bring a single-minded focus to the defensive side of
  his game because one slip at the World Cup next summer could mean England pack
  their suitcases and go home. The head coach said then that he regarded
  Alexander-Arnold as a right-back, albeit a “unique” one, rather than a
  midfielder as he named him in his squad for games against Andorra and Senegal.
  Alexander-Arnold came on as a 64th-minute substitute against Andorra in
  Barcelona and was unused against Senegal. He has since joined Madrid from
  Liverpool and has played at the Club World Cup and in La Liga. Anderson’s
  inclusion is a reward for his performances with the under-21s and fine form at
  Forest. The midfielder starred as Lee Carsley’s under-21s won the European
  Championship in June. Tuchel watched Anderson last Sunday at Crystal Palace.
  Anderson joined Forest in July 2024 in a deal largely motivated by Newcastle’s
  need to stay on the right side of profitability and sustainability rules. The
  22-year-old represented Scotland as well as England at youth level and was
  called up to the Scotland senior side for the first time in August 2023, but
  withdrew through injury. Spence’s versatility will appeal to Tuchel. The
  25-year-old can play in both full-back positions and has enjoyed a renaissance
  at Tottenham since he spent 2023-24 on loan at Leeds and Genoa. The former
  Middlesbrough player signed a new contract this month and has started both
  Spurs’ league games at left-back. Rashford was called up by Tuchel in March
  then missed June’s games because of injury. Grealish impressed for Everton in
  last Sunday’s game against Brighton, setting up both goals, but has not done
  enough to convince Tuchel he is worthy of a call-up. His last England
  appearance came under Carsley against Finland in Helsinki in October 2024.
  Tuchel has not found space for Curtis Jones, Trevoh Chalobah, Ivan Toney or
  Conor Gallagher. Levi Colwill, Cole Palmer, Jude Bellingham, Bukayo Saka and
  Ben White are injured. Foden returned from injury for City as a 75th-minute
  substitute last weekend after an ankle knock in pre-season. His former City
  teammate Walker, a summer signing for Burnley, had a torrid game against
  Senegal on his 96th England appearance and his hopes of reaching 100 caps
  appear to be fading after his omission from a squad that contains no Liverpool
  or Manchester United players other than Rashford, who is loan at Barcelona.
