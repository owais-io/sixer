  Socially conservative “parents’ rights” groups that have emerged as powerfully
  political lobbying groups in the US are quickly gaining ground in Canada,
  academics and free speech advocates say, after two such groups claimed they
  had persuaded Alberta to institute a sweeping public school book ban. Alberta
  recently directed schools to purge library books from shelves that fit its
  definition of “explicit sexual content” by 1 October. If the policy is applied
  precisely as outlined, a host of books face being purged, including George
  Orwell’s 1984 due to passages in the text that discuss sexual intercourse and
  rape. Academics and researchers who examine censorship say the policy
  specifically targets books that affirm LGBTQ+ identities – which they say is
  the goal of rightwing parents’ groups. “They’d been working on the government
  for months to get them to do this,” said James Turk, the director of the
  Centre for Free Expression at Toronto Metropolitan University. Turk says he
  and his colleagues are following more than 25 socially conservative groups
  across Canada that have similar mandates. Turk pointed to the Miramichi
  Freedom Warriors, a New Brunswick-based group, and Concerned Citizens Canada
  based in Manitoba, which have also been demanding that books that positively
  represent queer communities be removed from public libraries and schools. Many
  of these groups emerged as anti-vax groups during the Covid-19 pandemic, and
  then used social media to widen their scope of causes, including strict
  parental oversight. “It’s a major initiative right now that grows out of this
  notion that ‘our kids are our property’,” he said. “It’s a very
  backward-looking, reactionary way of understanding how children learn.”
  Lobbying by some parents’ groups has also prompted Alberta to institute
  “opt-in” sex education in fall 2024, instead of “opt-out”, which means parents
  must now actively sign their children up for those classes. In June, following
  advocating from the Alberta Parents’ Union, Alberta also introduced new rules
  that require all presentations focussing on gender identity and sexuality to
  be vetted by the provincial government. The two groups in Alberta,
  Action4Canada and Parents for Choice in Education (PCE), have taken credit for
  precipitating the province’s book ban. The Alberta government confirmed it had
  met with PCE to hear their views, as reported by the Investigative Journalism
  Foundation (IFJ), a Canadian non-profit newsroom. The Alberta government
  defines “explicit sexual content” in its policy as “content containing a
  detailed and clear depiction of a sexual act”. Students from kindergarten to
  grade 12 cannot access any “content” in a school library that meets this
  definition. PCE sent an email to its followers after the ban came down,
  thanking them for their efforts in contacting government officials about
  “graphic” books, as reported by the IFJ. Alberta has not provided a list of
  specific books to remove, saying instead that schools must apply their new
  policy and toss books that do not fit their standards. But the province has
  identified four graphic novels as examples of books to be culled: Gender Queer
  by Maia Kobabe, Fun Home by Alison Bechdel, Blankets by Craig Thompson and
  Flamer by Mike Curato. All four are globally acclaimed coming-of-age stories
  about teenage life and young adulthood. Three of the books focus on stories
  that represent the LGBTQ+ community. PCE and Action4Canada also claim they
  alerted Alberta about the four books. Alberta’s education minister Demetrios
  Nicolaides and other provincial officials have insisted they are not looking
  to erase queer stories from school shelves, but Action4Canada and PCE openly
  express disdain for the LGBTQ+ community. Ira Wells, an associate professor of
  literature at the University of Toronto and author of the book On Book
  Banning, said Alberta’s ban will likely cause a purge of marginalized voices
  from school libraries. “What we are seeing in Alberta is as extreme as we’ve
  seen in the southern United States and other centers of book banning,” he
  said. Wells warned that the move set a dangerous precedent for the province
  and could have wider effects on the country. Canada’s provinces and
  territories each manage their own education system. But Wells argued that the
  issue of book bans was so concerning that the country’s federal government
  should consider intervention, through an order that would ensure book
  selection is based on an educator’s professional training and not on personal
  beliefs. “Anti-book banning legislation is something that the federal Liberals
  should absolutely be exploring,” he said.
