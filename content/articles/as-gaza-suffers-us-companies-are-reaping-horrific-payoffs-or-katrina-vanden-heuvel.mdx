  Thousands of famished people waiting for hours in 90-degree heat to secure
  bags of flour that run out after 10 minutes – this is a typical scene at the
  four aid distribution centers remaining in Gaza. The cause of this desperation
  isn’t shortages per se, because the World Food Programme has tons of food
  waiting to be delivered to malnourished Palestinians. Instead, the problem is
  Israel’s months-long blockade of aid, which more than 100 humanitarian
  organizations have stated is causing “chaos, starvation, and death”. And
  though Israeli authorities began allowing a trickle of convoys to resume
  deliveries over the weekend, the face-saving gesture is too little for the one
  in three Gazans who haven’t eaten in days, and too late for the dozens who
  have already starved to death. Amid this manufactured famine, however, Israel
  has permitted another kind of shipment to flow freely. Weapons imports have
  continued unabated, with thousands of pounds of bombs, guns and ammunition
  pouring into the Israel Defense Forces. A new report by Francesca Albanese,
  the United Nations special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories,
  has uncovered the major supplier of this fatal equipment: the United States.
  Titled “From economy of occupation to economy of genocide”, the exposé lays
  bare how major American corporations have been all too eager to facilitate
  Israel’s atrocities in Gaza in exchange for billions of dollars in revenue. It
  also reveals our nation’s now undeniable complicity in what has been described
  as the worst humanitarian crisis of the 21st century. War profiteering is a
  phenomenon as ancient as war itself, but Albanese’s investigation shows that
  the military-industrial-technological complex is reaping uniquely horrible
  payoffs in Palestine. Albanese describes how companies led by Lockheed Martin
  have built fighter jets for Israel that have carried out bombings which have
  killed or wounded almost 200,000 Palestinians. She describes Palantir’s work
  with the Israeli military, and its consummation of that partnership by holding
  a board meeting in Tel Aviv (Palantir has denied involvement in IDF programs
  identifying Gaza targets). And she brings to light how Caterpillar Inc
  equipment has demolished homes and hospitals, crushing to death civilians
  stuck inside those structures. Perhaps the most hypocritical offenders are the
  members of the Magnificent Seven. Google’s unofficial motto was once “Don’t be
  evil,” but now the company has joined Amazon to provide cloud computing
  services to Israel and its military for a persuasive $1.2bn. Albanese quotes
  an Israeli colonel who calls this technology “a weapon in every sense of the
  word”, a cloud as deadly as any poison gas. The Trump administration has
  responded to Albanese’s research with its classic combination of denial and
  retribution. The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has sanctioned her, calling
  her work “political and economic warfare”. But Albanese’s conclusions align
  with those of several prominent Jewish and Israeli figures. The former IDF
  soldier and leading genocide historian Omer Bartov defended Albanese by
  writing, “I have been teaching classes on genocide for a quarter of a century.
  I can recognize one when I see one.” On Monday, two major Israeli human rights
  groups announced they agreed with that description. The journalist Peter
  Beinart, the editor-at-large of Jewish Currents, has called Israel an
  apartheid state, and recently condemned the crisis in Gaza as “an astonishing
  level of death and suffering that has been normalized”. A simple scan of the
  Israeli newspaper Haaretz turns up recent headlines like “The Mathematics of
  Starvation” and “Israel’s Destruction of Gaza”. In the US Capitol, progressive
  lawmakers such as Representative Rashida Tlaib and Senator Bernie Sanders have
  repeatedly called for ending the transfer of US arms to Israel. A handful of
  other Democrats have also introduced the Block the Bombs Act, which would
  prohibit the sale of certain weapons without congressional approval, including
  those made by American companies like Boeing and General Dynamics. While the
  bill has gained little traction, outrage over Gaza has become a bipartisan
  consensus among voters. Only 23% of Americans deem Israel’s military actions
  to be justified. But with activists like Mahmoud Khalil facing deportation
  over their pro-Palestinian advocacy, and with other protests worldwide being
  met with brutal and even deadly repression, crystallizing sentiment into a
  social movement seems an increasingly daunting task. Amid so much pushback,
  though, grassroots organizing against weapons exports to Israel still
  represents a concrete if challenging opportunity for change. Students in
  Israel, the US and across the globe have already been providing a moral
  witness on this front, despite the threat of retaliation, expulsion and
  blacklisting. Now, a broader coalition will be necessary to convince lawmakers
  that they should fear constituent backlash more than a primary challenge
  bankrolled by Aipac. Beyond pouring into the streets, Americans can also
  boycott the corporations living large while the population of Palestine
  dwindles. The employees of those very companies can do the same, like the 50
  now-terminated workers at Google who led “No Tech for Apartheid” protests last
  year. Otherwise, the warning recently issued by Beinart will remain true:
  “Blood is on our hands as Americans because it is our weapons that are
  responsible for those children starving to death.” In the meantime, the
  thirsty toddlers of Khan Younis will continue to wait for some drops of salt
  water to drink, and the emaciated doctors of Gaza City will continue to
  scrounge for a few cans of expired food to eat. Katrina vanden Heuvel is
