  Is there any section of Labour support that its Treasury team hasn’t alienated
  yet? With Rachel Reeves’s personal backing, Heathrow airport has brought
  forward its ludicrous plans for a third runway (Heathrow submits
  ‘shovel-ready’ plans for third runway, 1 August). As a result, we are about to
  shred the party’s green credentials and mobilise not just the mass
  environmental movement against us but also a vast swathe of 2 million
  Londoners hit by increased noise and air pollution. All Ed Miliband’s good
  work on meeting climate change targets will be undermined by the carbon
  generated by this single development. At a cost of £50bn, and with Heathrow
  airport nearly £20bn in debt, nobody realistically believes that taxpayers
  won’t eventually be called upon to subsidise the scheme, and travellers forced
  to pay for it with massively increased landing charges. With its increased
  costings, the Heathrow third runway has already gained the reputation of being
  aviation’s equivalent of HS2. Approximately 15,000 of my constituents in west
  London will lose their homes, their schools and their whole communities – but
  there has not been a single expression of concern from any government
  minister. To top it all, some strategic genius has timetabled this nightmare
  decision to fall just before the next election. Here’s the tragic irony. The
  suffering of my constituents, the immense damage to Labour’s environmental
  strategy and the dire electoral consequences for the party will result from a
  scheme that very, very few, even in government, have any confidence will even
  go ahead. John McDonnell MP Independent, Hayes and Harlington • Fiona Harvey
  makes some very good points in her article (What will expanding Heathrow do to
  UK’s net zero plans? 1 August). There is simply no realistic prospect of
  scaling up fossil-fuel-substitute fuels to the levels required to cut the
  aviation industry’s climate pollution to net zero for decades. The only
  credible policy option now, if the government is serious about its climate
  commitments, is not to allow airports to expand. There is still time for a
  backbench rebellion – but who will lead it? Nick Hodgkinson Chair, Group for
  Action on Leeds Bradford Airport
