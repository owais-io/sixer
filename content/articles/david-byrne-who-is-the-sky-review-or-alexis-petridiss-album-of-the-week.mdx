  It is seven years since David Byrne released his last solo album, American
  Utopia. So much has happened in the intervening period that it’s easy to
  forget that, initially, the record received a mixed response. There was praise
  for its expansive and experimental approach: songs built on rhythms by Brian
  Eno were handed over to a wide selection of producers to tinker with, then
  Byrne compiled the finished product. Part of a larger multimedia project
  called Reasons to Be Cheerful, it attempted to engender a spirit of
  positivity, but there were complaints that this amounted to a blithe
  abdication of responsibility amid the first Trump presidency. Respectful
  long-service-medal reviews coexisted with angry fulminating over the complete
  absence of female contributors. A mixed response was business as usual as far
  as Byrne’s post-Talking Heads career is concerned. He’s pursued an
  idiosyncratic path – diversions into Latin American music, opera and trip-hop,
  collaborations with dance producers and St Vincent – but never with results
  that achieved sufficient acclaim or commercial success to overshadow his
  former band. But then, something weird happened. The ensuing American Utopia
  live shows, which used cutting-edge technology and choreography to demolish
  the conventions of a rock show, attracted deserved hyperventilating praise. A
  tour that began playing modest theatres wound up filling arenas, spawning a
  Broadway show, two live albums – one named after a critic’s breathless
  assertion that it was The Best Live Show of All Time – and a Spike
  Lee-directed movie. So Byrne arrives at Who Is the Sky? with his stock higher
  than at any point in the last 35 years. It abandons American Utopia’s
  patchwork approach for a more straightforward form of collaboration, the whole
  album recorded with Brooklyn’s 12-piece Ghost Train Orchestra and Harry Styles
  producer Kid Harpoon. But its raison d’être remains essentially the same: more
  primary-coloured musical optimism, to which end it variously employs
  Mariachi-style brass (What Is the Reason for It?), sweeping
  40s-Hollywood-musical strings (A Door Called No), rhythms that join the dots
  between Cuban clave and George Michael’s Faith (Don’t Be Like That) and an
  off-kilter, vocoder-bedecked take on the sumptuous soul of former Byrne
  collaborator Thom Bell on I’m an Outsider. Thus far, 2025 has proved so
  unremittingly grim that it makes 2018 look like a lost sunlit nirvana: you can
  understand why Byrne thinks the world needs positivity and uplift, and Who Is
  the Sky? frequently sounds fantastic. The arrangements are superb,
  particularly when driven by the woody thwack of double bass. The songs are
  often melodically strong. The climax of Everybody Laughs, with the voices of
  Byrne and St Vincent belting out over a marimba-speckled backdrop, is suitably
  joyous, as are the key shifts in closer The Truth. When We Are Singing’s blend
  of an oddly (and one suspects unwittingly) Oasis-esque guitar line with a
  chugging funk rhythm really works, although it’s debatable whether it strictly
  needed the sound of Byrne’s miaowing extempore vocals. The sound of Byrne
  mewing like a cat highlights the album’s major drawback. The lyrical tone
  tends to jokiness, which is fine when the jokes are funny. Moisturizing Thing
  concerns an anti-ageing cream that works so well, it leaves the protagonist
  looking like a three-year-old, plagued by people talking as if he’s a toddler
  and constant demands for ID in bars. Or when they carry a certain potent
  undertow: the man singing an impassioned love song to his flat on My Apartment
  Is My Friend could easily be an isolated shut-in; the character bamboozled by
  his partner’s knowledge and understanding of films, literature and human
  nature in She Explains Things to Me seems suggestive of Byrne’s self-diagnosed
  autism. Otherwise, as on I Met the Buddha at a Downtown Party, or The Avant
  Garde, they carry the awkward, faintly irritating feeling of someone trying a
  bit too hard to leaven the mood. Similarly, the tone of optimism can seem too
  pat and Pollyanna-ish without a hint of darkness. To the latter end, you could
  hear The Truth as a paean to love or an acknowledgment that the titular
  concept seems increasingly malleable in a world of disinformation and
  manipulation: “The truth cannot hurt me, I know what I know.” When We Are
  Singing at least acknowledges the pallid state of things – “we’ve got one foot
  in the pearly gates and one foot in the flames” – while it’s hymning music’s
  transportive power. It’s hard not to have mixed feelings about Who Is the
  Sky?: business as usual. But perhaps it’s worth keeping American Utopia in
  mind. Byrne has suggested his forthcoming tour will blend “visual art,
  storytelling and music into one compelling live performance”. Given what
  happened last time around – a good album elevated to greatness on stage – that
  sounds intriguing: a reason to be suitably optimistic. This week Alexis
  listened to Alabama Shakes - Another Life A decade on from their last album,
  Sound and Colour, Alabama Shakes return: Another Life is murky, distorted,
  impassioned and out-there rock-soul.
