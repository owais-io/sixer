  My mother, Juliet Congreve, who has died aged 76, was a pioneer in library
  automation and later had a successful university teaching career specialising
  in human-computer interaction. For most of her professional life, she worked
  at Middlesex University. In the early 1980s, at Middlesex, she introduced one
  of the first uses of email in a UK university, enabling librarians to support
  inter-library loans. She quickly noticed colleagues using it to share updates,
  ideas and build community – not just to speed up book requests. She led the
  transition from paper index cards to an electronic catalogue – a complex
  operation across six university sites and diverse disciplines, including
  teacher training, art, law and engineering. Her research into subject access
  in online catalogues was also pioneering. At a time when most library systems
  were clunky and difficult to search, she developed ways to help users find
  what they needed, even if they did not know the exact terminology. Working
  with the Precis indexing system, she created a prototype that allowed users to
  browse related subjects – guiding them from broad topics to narrower ones and
  suggesting alternative terms if initial searches failed. Her work helped
  overcome a major barrier in early digital library systems: users often did not
  know the “right” word to use. Her research made systems smarter and more
  intuitive, and was cited internationally as an early example of user-friendly
  search design. Juliet was born in Watford, Hertfordshire, where her father,
  Stanley Halsey, worked in the printing industry. Her mother, Phyllis (nee
  Beck), had worked at the De Havilland factory during the second world war
  until the birth of Juliet’s older brother, Michael. Juliet’s postwar childhood
  was shaped by life in a new council house and attending newly built schools at
  Lea Farm and Rickmansworth grammar school. Although Juliet did well
  academically, she postponed university to help her mother care for her
  grandparents. She resumed her education as one of the first students of the
  Open University, thriving in its modern, flexible learning environment and
  studying modules in psychology, sociology, philosophy and art history. She
  worked as a librarian at Watford Technical College before joining Middlesex
  Polytechnic (later University) in 1978, and undertaking a master’s in library
  studies at University College London, gaining distinctions in every
  assignment. Anticipating the impact computers would have on libraries, Juliet
  completed a second master’s in computer science at Hatfield Polytechnic,
  graduating with distinction in 1984. In the second part of her career, she
  flourished as a university teacher. In 1987 she was promoted to principal
  lecturer in applied computing at Middlesex, managing a large team and
  overseeing programmes with more than 1,000 students. Having been a part-time
  student herself for many years, she especially enjoyed teaching higher
  national diploma classes. Alongside teaching human-computer interaction, she
  drew on theories from fine art and art history to inform her research in
  software screen design. Her promising academic career was cut short in 2000 by
  ME and caring responsibilities for her mother. After her mother’s death in
  2016, Juliet pursued her passion for photography. Her work appeared in
  publications by the Chiltern Society and the Ramblers Association. She is
  survived by my father, William Congreve, a chemist, whom she married in 1973,
  and me, and by her brother, Michael.
