  This week, diplomatic tensions between Australia and Israel have arisen after
  Canberra decided to deny a far-right Israeli politician entry to Australia.
  Simcha Rothman, a member of the Knesset for the far-right party Religious
  Zionism, has described Palestinian children in Gaza as “enemies” and called
  for Israel’s total control of the West Bank. Rothman was scheduled to appear
  at two public events in Sydney and Melbourne in August and two private events.
  It had been billed as a “solidarity tour”. The Australian home affairs
  minister, Tony Burke, on Monday confirmed Rothman’s visa application had been
  rejected. The decision ignited a war of words between the two countries. In
  retaliation, Israel immediately announced it would revoke the visas of
  Australian representatives to the Palestinian Authority. By Wednesday, Burke
  was declaring there were now “very serious differences” between the two
  countries. Sign up: AU Breaking News email This is how the public war of words
  has ramped up and played out: Monday, 18 August If you are coming to Australia
  to spread a message of hate and division, we don’t want you here. – Tony Burke
  on the decision to block Rothman from visiting Australia After Rothman’s visa
  application is rejected, Israel’s minister for foreign affairs, Gideon Sa’ar,
  announces on X he has revoked the visas of the Australian diplomats. While
  antisemitism is raging in Australia, including manifestations of violence
  against Jews and Jewish institutions, the Australian government is choosing to
  fuel it by false accusations, as if the visit of Israeli figures will disrupt
  public order and harm Australia’s Muslim population. It is shameful and
  unacceptable! – Gideon Sa’ar, Israel’s foreign affairs minister, on X,
  explaining the decision to revoke visas of Australian representatives to the
  Palestinian Authority Tuesday, 19 August On Tuesday morning, Australia’s
  foreign minister, Penny Wong, responds. At a time when dialogue and diplomacy
  are needed more than ever, the Netanyahu government is isolating Israel and
  undermining international efforts towards peace and a two-state solution. This
  is an unjustified reaction, following Australia’s decision to recognise
  Palestine. – Penny Wong, Australia’s foreign affairs minister, in an official
  statement on Israel’s decision to revoke the Australian visas Netanyahu later
  takes to social media, posting a strongly worded statement to X, escalating
  the standoff. Netanyahu also wrote a letter, dated 17 August, to the
  Australian prime minister, stating Albanese’s decision to recognise Palestine
  was adding “fuel on this antisemitic fire”. The same quote was reportedly used
  in a letter Netanyahu sent to French president, Emmanuel Macron. History will
  remember Albanese for what he is: a weak politician who betrayed Israel and
  abandoned Australia’s Jews. – Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on X,
  after Australia’s decision to block Rothman’s visit Netanyahu’s public
  outburst attracts criticism from Israel’s opposition, saying it’s a “gift” to
  Australia. The thing that most strengthens a leader in the democratic world
  today is a confrontation with Netanyahu, the most politically toxic leader in
  the western world. – Yair Lapid, leader of the opposition in Israel, in a
  statement on X Wednesday, 20 August Albanese says he didn’t take the verbal
  attack from Netanyahu personally. He promises to continue engaging
  diplomatically with all leaders. But Albanese’s home affair minister, Burke,
  is far stronger in his criticism of Netanyahu. Strength is not measured by how
  many people you can blow up or how many children you can leave hungry.
  Strength is much better measured by exactly what [Albanese] has done, which is
  when there’s a decision that we know Israel won’t like, he goes straight to
  Benjamin Netanyahu.” – Tony Burke on ABC Radio National Alex Ryvchin, a
  prominent Jewish leader in Australia, criticises the decision to cancel
  Rothman’s visa. But he says the responses by Israel and Australia are
  overblown. He tells Sky News it was “unseemly” for a leader like Netanyahu to
  speak to a foreign leader in that manner. There are real-life consequences
  here and we want to see the countries work through any issues before things
  get out of hand. – Alex Ryvchin, the co-chief executive of the Executive
  Council of Australia Jewry Before the visa cancellation, the US ambassador to
  Israel expressed disappointment about Australia’s decision last week to
  recognise Palestine. Mike Huckabee told the ABC’s 7.30 program the timing was
  hurtful, and the decision was a gift to Hamas. The White House didn’t directly
  criticise Australia’s decision, but said more generally that the US
  recognising Palestinian statehood would be a reward for Hamas, and the
  administration would not do that, in comments reported by Nine Newspapers.
  There’s an enormous level of disappointment and some disgust … I don’t know
  that the president used that word, [but] I would say that is a
  characterisation of a sentiment. – Mike Huckabee on ABC’s 7.30 program, 14
  August – with Josh Taylor
