  Rocks take thousands to millions of years to be made, right? Wrong.
  Researchers have discovered that industrial waste has forged itself into rock
  over the course of just a few decades. This astounding discovery, made at
  Derwent Howe on the UK’s Cumbrian coast, challenges theories about how rocks
  are formed. The rocks, which are a glassy texture and blue-grey colour, are
  made from slag, leftover from the iron and steel-making foundries that
  operated near Derwent Howe in the 19th and 20th centuries. Samples show the
  rocks contain many of the chemicals found in ordinary sedimentary rocks, but
  in this case hardened into solid rock within 35 years. An aluminium drinks tab
  dating to 1989 or later and a 1934 George V coin, fused into the new rock, are
  proof of its rapid formation. Reporting in the journal Geology, the scientists
  say the new rocks are a clear marker proving we are in the Anthropocene era –
  where human activity is altering the planet. Such rocks are likely to be
  commonplace in industrial areas all over the world (Britain alone has 120km of
  coastal slag deposits) and are likely to be having an impact on marine
  ecosystems and coastal erosion. The researchers are now using drones and
  ground-penetrating radar to better understand the rock-making process and its
  effect on the environment.
