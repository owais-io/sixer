  Google has outlined its latest step towards artificial general intelligence
  (AGI) with a new model that allows AI systems to interact with a convincing
  simulation of the real world. The Genie 3 “world model” could be used to train
  robots and autonomous vehicles as they engage with realistic recreations of
  environments such as warehouses, according to Google. The US technology
  company’s AI division, Google DeepMind, argues that world models are a key
  step to achieving AGI, a hypothetical level of AI where a system can carry out
  most tasks on a par with humans – rather than just individual tasks such as
  playing chess or translating languages – and potentially do someone’s job.
  DeepMind said such models would play an important role in the development of
  AI agents, or systems that carry out tasks autonomously. “We expect this
  technology to play a critical role as we push toward AGI, and agents play a
  greater role in the world,” DeepMind said. However, Google said Genie 3 was
  not yet ready for full public release and did not give a date for its launch,
  adding that the model had a range of limitations. The announcement comes amid
  ever-increasing competition in the AI market. On Sunday Sam Altman, the chief
  executive of ChatGPT’s developer, OpenAI, shared a screenshotof what appeared
  to be the company’s latest AI model, GPT-5. Google said its world model could
  also help humans to experience a range of simulations for training or
  exploring, replicating experiences such as skiing or walking around a mountain
  lake. Genie 3 creates its scenarios immediately from text prompts, according
  to DeepMind, and the simulated environment can be altered quickly – by for
  instance, introducing a herd of deer on to a ski slope – with further text
  prompts. The tech company showed the Genie 3-created skiing and warehouse
  scenarios to journalists on Monday but is not yet releasing the model to the
  public. The quality of the simulations seen by the Guardian are on a par with
  Google’s latest video creation model, Veo 3, but they last minutes rather than
  the eight seconds offered by Veo 3. While AGI has been viewed through the
  prism of potentially eliminating white-collar jobs, as autonomous systems
  carry out an array of roles from sales agent to lawyer or accountant, world
  models are viewed by Google as a key technology for developing robots and
  autonomous vehicles. For instance, a recreation of a warehouse with realistic
  physics and people could help to train a robot, as a simulation it “learned”
  from in training helps it achieve its goal. Google has also created a virtual
  agent, Sima, which can carry out tasks in video game settings although, like
  Genie 3, it is not publicly available. Prof Subramanian Ramamoorthy, the chair
  of robot learning and autonomy at the University of Edinburgh, said world
  models were “extremely important” for robot development, adding: “To achieve
  flexible decision-making robots need to anticipate the consequences of
  different actions to choose the best one to execute in the physical world.”
  Andrew Rogoyski of the Institute for People-Centred AI at the University of
  Surrey, said world models could also help large language models – the
  technology that underpins chatbots such as ChatGPT. “If you give a disembodied
  AI the ability to be embodied, albeit virtually, then the AI can explore the
  world, or a world – and grow in capabilities as a result,” he said. “While AIs
  are trained on vast quantities of internet data, allowing an AI to explore the
  world physically will add an important dimension to the creation of more
  powerful and intelligent AIs.” In a research note accompanying the Sima
  announcement last year, Google researchers said world models were important
  because large language models were effective at tasks such as planning but not
  at taking action on a human’s behalf.
