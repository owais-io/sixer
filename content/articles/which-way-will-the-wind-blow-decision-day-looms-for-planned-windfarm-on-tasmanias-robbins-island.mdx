  More people have heard of Robbins Island than have seen it. Separated from
  Tasmania’s north-western tip by a stretch of water that can be navigated only
  at low tide, the island is nearly 10,000 hectares of heathland and woodlands,
  paddocks, unusual geology and wetlands, all ringed by pristine beaches. The
  island has been owned by the Hammond family, who use it to run Wagyu cattle,
  since the 1960s. Further back it was home to the Pirilyunya people for tens of
  thousands of years. Its future is contested. After repeated delays, it is
  expected to be decided by the federal environment minister, Murray Watt, this
  month. For eight years, the renewable energy company Acen Australia has been
  planning to make the island home to what would be one of Australia’s largest
  windfarms. If approved, it says, it would spend more than $3bn as it builds up
  to 100 turbines (maximum height: 212 metres), a 500-metre wharf and a 1.2km
  bridge. A 120km transmission line through forest and farms across the state’s
  north-west will require a separate approval. Sign up to get climate and
  environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletter Acen
  says it is one of the best wind energy sites in the country, with the capacity
  to generate at least a third more electricity than an average windfarm the
  same size. The turbines would be powered by what the Hammonds have described
  as the world’s cleanest air – the roaring forties, which blow unimpeded across
  the southern Indian Ocean to the Tasmanian west coast. The proposal is backed
  by the state’s Liberal and Labor parties and the business community. The head
  of the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Wayne Davy, says it is
  “absolutely essential” to meet growing power demand and has urged the federal
  government to approve it to “create jobs, investment and huge benefits for the
  Tasmanian economy”. But it is opposed by environmental organisations and some
  scientists. They agree that the country needs more renewable energy in a hurry
  to replace ageing coal plants and cut greenhouse gas emissions, but argue the
  site is wrong. ‘To us, it is a no-go site’ The intertidal mudflats at Robbins
  Island and in the surrounding area are considered internationally important
  feeding habitat for migratory and residential shorebirds, including more than
  15 species that travel from the northern hemisphere each year via the east
  Asian-Australasian flyway. Some of these species, including the curlew
  sandpiper, far-eastern curlew and red knot, are listed as threatened. Some
  shorebird populations are estimated to have fallen by more than 70% since late
  last century. Environmentalists say the 720-megawatt farm could also threaten
  endangered Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagles, the vulnerable blue-winged parrot
  and the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot, which flies from the
  Australian mainland to Melaleuca, in the Tasmanian wilderness world heritage
  area, each summer to breed. The orange-bellied parrot has been the focus of an
  intensive government-funded recovery effort. Its wild population remains tiny.
  It fell to just 17 before increasing to nearly 100 last winter. A flock of red
  knots, a threatened species The question facing Watt is whether the windfarm
  can be designed in a way that shields these and other threatened species –
  notably, a disease-free population of Tasmanian devils – that he is required
  to protect under national environment law. He will be making the decision
  before a long-promised overhaul of the law, which has few defenders and is
  widely agreed to be failing. The timing places Robbins Island at the centre of
  an argument about how to balance the need to preserve Australia’s wild places
  and wildlife, including a ballooning list of species at risk of extinction,
  while allowing a rapid rollout of renewable energy. Bar-tailed godwits and a
  hooded plover Conservationists argue there are some places development should
  just not be allowed, and they include Robbins Island. Sean Dooley, a senior
  adviser at BirdLife Australia, says: “To us, it is a no-go site.” “It is such
  a vital staging post and feeding site for shorebirds – certainly, the most
  important site in Tasmania,” Dooley says. “Birdlife Australia sees climate
  change as one of the two major things that are going to impact and reduce bird
  populations, and we need to get on top of it as soon as we can. But it’s
  essential, in trying to deal with that, we don’t exacerbate the other major
  threat, which is destroying habitat.” Eric Woehler, an ecologist and former
  convener of BirdLife Tasmania, describes the proposed site as “completely
  inappropriate”. He says the company’s bird surveys have been “fundamentally
  inadequate”, but that the best available orange-bellied parrot data – from
  radio-tracking of its 2024 northern migration – suggested half the birds that
  showed up on monitoring had visited Robbins Island. A white-bellied sea eagle
  “If this is approved there is a very real and very frightening prospect of the
  loss of orange-bellied parrots in the wild from collision risk,” he says.
  “There is a very great risk to the wedge-tailed eagle population in the area.
  There is a very great risk to the migratory shorebirds that fly from Siberia
  to Tasmania to feed in the Robbins passage area every year for six months.”
  ‘We believe the risks can be mitigated’ The windfarm has had a difficult path
  to final decision stage. It has had to clear local and state hurdles, and a
  federal decision has been delayed seven times. In 2021 Guardian Australia
  revealed that federal officials had raised concern about the impact on about
  150 devils that have been geographically protected from a contagious facial
  tumour disease that has devastated other populations and had advised the
  company the impact on the species could be difficult to offset. In 2022 the
  Tasmanian Environment Protection Authority notionally approved the
  development, but said it must shut down for five months each year during
  orange-bellied parrots’ migration season. This was widely seen as a decision
  that would block the development, given the shutdown would make it financially
  unviable. But the EPA ruling was overturned on appeal. A counter-appeal
  against the project by the community group Circular Head Coastal Awareness
  Network lost in the supreme court. Acen says it is confident the risk to birds
  and devils can be managed and has changed its plans to address concerns that
  have been raised, including reducing the number of turbines by 20%, carving
  out part of the northern end of the island from development and promising a
  500-metre buffer around sites that shorebirds gather. It says there is no
  evidence from surveys that shorebirds fly across the island – a point that is
  strongly disputed by campaigners – and, despite radio-tracking surveys last
  and this year, that little is known about orange-bellied parrots’ flight path
  or the height at which they travel. Michael Connarty, Acen’s head of
  operations and trading, acknowledges that the length of the development
  process has been frustrating and says the project has probably been
  scrutinised as much as any in Tasmania’s history. He argues that the
  development will benefit the local community, including creating up to to 400
  jobs in construction and 60 during operation, help power clean industry in the
  state and send any excess electricity across Bass Strait. Acen hopes Watt
  approves it with conditions that outline the risks it needs to navigate. “We
  believe the risks can be mitigated,” Connarty says. “It’s not like this is
  like a rubber-stamp process over eight years. There has been high-level
  scrutiny of the project in terms of the risk and mitigations and we’re hopeful
  that it’ll be a positive outcome with conditions, and we’ll work through
  whatever those conditions look like.” Dooley says he has some sympathy for
  Acen’s position as it was trying to develop the windfarm “within the rulebook
  they have been given”. Birdlife Australia believes the primary issue is nature
  laws that “don’t give a clear vision of how the renewables rollout should go”.
  Another environment group, the Bob Brown Foundation, says it is preparing for
  action. Its founder, the former Greens leader Bob Brown, this week predicted
  Watt would approve the development and vowed it would help “bring on the
  biggest public confrontation with environmental defenders here since the
  Franklin dam”. A spokesperson for Watt declined to comment on the project
  while a decision was being made. They said the government had made clear it
  intended to reform environmental laws to “better protect our environment,
  while delivering more efficient approvals”. A decision is due by 29 August.
