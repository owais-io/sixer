  Finland’s central bank chief has warned that President Donald Trump’s attacks
  on the US. Federal Reserve have a significant impact on the financial markets
  and the world economy. Olli Rehn warned in a speech this morning that the
  Fed’s independence has remained an inviolable principle since the 1980s, but
  was now under attack, Reuters reports. Rehn explained: “Now, however, this
  principle is wobbling badly. This could have substantial, global knock-on
  effects on both the financial markets and the real economy.” Rehn’s comments
  follow Donald Trump’s attempt to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook over
  unconfirmed allegations of mortgage fraud; Cook is refusing to step down, and
  pledging to sue the Trump administration. Trump has also repeatedly criticised
  the Fed, and its chair Jerome Powell, for not cutting US interest rates. The
  FCA’s investigation into Drax comes five months after the company’s former top
  lobbyist accused it of “misleading the public, government and its regulator”
  over its sourcing of wood for biomass pellets. In a claim for unfair
  dismissal, Rowaa Ahmar, Drax’s former head of public affairs, said evidence
  suggested Drax was “unable to prove that it only sourced sustainable wood for
  its biomass, and that it was in fact using unsustainable wood”. More here. An
  accounting probe at WH Smith has delayed its former finance chief from joining
  high street baker Greggs. Greggs has told the City that Robert Moorhead has
  asked to defer his appointment until Deloitte has conducted its review into a
  profit overstatement which rocked WH Smith’s share price last week. WH Smith
  startled investors on 21 August by slashing its full-year profit forecasts and
  reveaing it had discovered an overstatement in profits at its US arm. The
  problem is due to the “accelerated recognition of supplier income” in the US –
  the practice where retailers receive money from their suppliers for, for
  example, promoting certain products or hitting certain sales targets. Under
  accounting rules, such income can only be recorded in the financial year it is
  received. Economic growth in Switzerland has slowed, as the country braces for
  a bruising hit from Donald Trump’s trade wars. Switzerland’s GDP adjusted for
  sporting events increased by just 0.1% in the second quarter of this year,
  down on the 0.7% gorwth recorded in January-March. Switzerland’s State
  Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) warned that new tariffs on sales to
  the US will hurt growth, saying: After the above-average growth seen in the
  previous quarter, the anticipated correction has now occurred. Industrial
  value added and exports declined sharply, whereas the services sector
  delivered broadbased growth. An updated economic scenario from SECO shows
  that, as a result of higher US import tariffs, the Swiss economy is likely to
  grow more slowly than previously expected, particularly in 2026. Trump has set
  a 39% tariff on Swiss exports to the US, leaving the country scrambling to
  agree a better trade deal. Shares in power generator Drax have tumbled by 10%
  after it revealed this morning it is being investigated by the City watchdog.
  Traders drove Drax’s share price down to 630p in early London trading, down
  from 703.5p last night, following the news that the FCA is probing whether its
  recent annual reports comply with UK Listing Rules. As covered earlier (see
  7.18am post for more details), the investigation appears to centre on Drax’s
  statements regarding the sourcing of the biomass it uses in its wood-burning
  power station. Over in Manila, the Philippines central bank has cut interest
  rates despite trade war concerns. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas lowered its
  overnight target reverse repurchase rate by 25 basis points (a quarter of one
  percentage point) to 5% today, in line with expectations. It cut borrowing
  costs after concluding that inflation expectations remain well-anchored, with
  inflation forecast to average 1.7% this year. But, it added: Meanwhile,
  possible electricity rate adjustments and higher rice tariffs could raise
  inflationary pressures over the policy horizon. The Monetary Board observed
  that domestic demand has held firm. However, the impact of US policies on
  global trade and investment continue to weigh on global economic activity.
  This could temper the outlook for the Philippine economy. Back in the car
  sector, Ford has today become the first manufacturer to be awarded the UK’s
  full electric car grant of £3,750, cutting the cost paid by consumers. Two
  Ford models, the Puma Gen-E and e-Tourneo Courier, now qualify for the grant,
  the Department for Transport has announced. They are the first to benefit from
  the full £3,750 subsidy. Another 26 models now get the smaller grant, which
  knocks £1,500 off their price. The scheme is meant to make it cheaper and
  easier to own an electric car. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said: We’re
  putting money back in people’s pockets and making it easier and cheaper for
  families to make the switch to electric, by delivering discounts of up to
  £3,750 on EVs. Our measures are driving competition in the UK EV market,
  boosting economic growth and supporting jobs and skills as part of our Plan
  for Change. Newsflash: UK energy producer Drax is being investigated by the
  Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Drax has told the City that it learned on
  Tuesday that the City watchdog had begun an investigation into “historical
  statements regarding Drax’s biomass sourcing and the compliance of Drax’s
  2021, 2022 and 2023 Annual Reports with the Listing Rules and Disclosure
  Guidance and Transparency Rules.” Drax, which operates a wood-burning power
  station in North Yorkshire, added that it will cooperate with the FCA’s
  investigation. The FCA has confirmed that it has opened an investigation,
  without giving more information. The company has faced pressure to disclose
  full details of its tree consumption; last year it agreed to pay £25m for
  submitting inaccurate data on the sourcing of wood pellets. Elsewhere in the
  auto industry this morning, new data shows that Britain’s car production grew
  for the second month in a row in July. Car production rose 5.6% in July from
  last year to 69,127 units, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders
  (SMMT) reported. However, total vehicle production dropped by 10.8% at 72,006
  units, due to a fall in commercial vehicle manufacturing. The European
  Automobile Manufacturers’ Association are also concerned that European take-up
  of electric cars is not rising faster. Sigrid de Vries, director general of
  ACEA, says: “Battery-electric vehicles still account for just 15.6% of the EU
  car market. Not only is this well below the level where it needs to be at this
  point in the transition the share in unevenly distributed across member
  states. To accelerate uptake, Europe must continue to expand public recharging
  infrastructure, secure lower recharging prices, and ensure well-coordinated
  purchase incentives schemes. The market data demonstrates why a
  technology-neutral approach must drive this transition. EVs will lead the
  charge, but there must also be space for (plug-in) hybrids, range extenders,
  highly efficient internal combustion-engine (ICE) vehicles, hydrogen and
  decarbonised fuels.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of
  business, the financial markets and the world economy. Tesla’s European sales
  slump has continued, as it faces rising competition in the battery-powered
  electric car market. New sales figures released by the European Automobile
  Manufacturers Association (ACEA) this morning show that Tesla shipments
  tumbled 40% last month. The company sold 8,837 vehicles across the European
  Union, the EFTA trade block and the UK in July, down from 14,769 in July 2024.
  The sales slump, which began at the start of this year, continued despite the
  recent revamp of Tesla’s signature Model Y, indicating that the backlash
  against CEO Elon Musk’s political views could still be hurting the company.
  Musk’s recent break-up with Donald Trump hasn’t, yet, revived the company’s
  fortunes. July’s 40% sales fall was worse than the total for 2025 to date,
  which are down 33% for the January-July period. Tesla also faces rising
  competition, particularly from Chinese manufacturers. BYD, the
  Shenzhen-headquartered carmaker, more than tripled its sales year-on-year in
  July, up from 4,151 a year earlier to 13,503 last month, a rise of 225%. This
  gave BYD a 1.2% market share, higher than Tesla’s 0.8%. BYD, which overtook
  Tesla for European sales back in April, recently launched its Dolphin Surf EV
  car, which is priced from £18,650 in the UK. ACEA also reports that in the
  first seven months of 2025, 1,011,903 new battery-electric cars were
  registered, accounting for 15.6% of the EU market share. Hybrid-electric car
  registrations proved more popular, though, with 2,255,080 units sold across
  the EU so far this year. This was driven by growth in the four biggest
  markets: France (+30.5%), Spain (+30.2%), Germany (+10.7%), and Italy (+9.4%).
  Hybrid-electric models now account for almost 35% of the total EU market.
  Overall, new car sales in Europe rose 5.9% in July, to 1.085 million. The
