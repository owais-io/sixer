  The Irish novelist Sally Rooney could be arrested under the Terrorism Act
  after saying she intends to use proceeds from her work to support Palestine
  Action, which was proscribed as a terrorist organisation in the UK last month,
  a legal expert has warned. Meanwhile, No 10 said that supporting the group was
  an offence under the act, after Rooney had made her pledge. Royalties from
  Rooney’s books, including Normal People and Conversations with Friends, along
  with BBC adaptations of them, would be used to support Palestine Action, she
  wrote in the Irish Times over the weekend. The legal expert also said that the
  bestselling writer could face prosecution if she were to express her views at,
  for example, a UK book festival, underscoring the proscription’s “gross
  disproportionality”. While the prime minister’s spokesperson would not respond
  to the author’s comments specifically, they said that there was “a difference
  between showing support for a proscribed organisation, which is an offence
  under the Terrorism Act, and legitimate protest in support of a cause”,
  according to the Press Association. Asked what message No 10 would give to
  people considering donating money to Palestine Action, the spokesperson said:
  “Support for a proscribed organisation is an offence under the Terrorism Act
  and obviously the police will, as they have set out, implement the law as
  you’d expect.” More than 700 people have been arrested under the Terrorism Act
  in relation to the group since it was proscribed in early July, many of whom
  were detained at a peaceful protest on 9 August in Parliament Square, London.
  “My books, at least for now, are still published in Britain, and are widely
  available in bookshops and even supermarkets,” wrote Rooney on Saturday. “In
  recent years the UK’s state broadcaster has also televised two fine
  adaptations of my novels, and therefore regularly pays me residual fees. I
  want to be clear that I intend to use these proceeds of my work, as well as my
  public platform generally, to go on supporting Palestine Action and direct
  action against genocide in whatever way I can.” Palestine Action was
  proscribed as a terrorist organisation after activists broke into an RAF base
  in Oxfordshire and spray painted two planes. They “knew, of course, that their
  actions were illegal”, Rooney wrote in the Guardian in June. “From the
  suffragettes to the gay rights movement to the anti-apartheid struggle,
  genuine political resistance has always involved intentional law-breaking.” In
  her Irish Times article last weekend, Rooney said that she “would happily
  publish this statement in a UK newspaper – but that would now be illegal”.
  Rooney’s books also include Beautiful World, Where Are You and, most recently,
  Intermezzo. The lawyer and writer Sadakat Kadri said: “Receiving money with
  the intention of using it to support terrorism is an offence under section 15
  of the 2000 act. That means Rooney could be arrested without a warrant as a
  ‘terrorist’.” He added that “the absurdities don’t end there”, and said the
  decision of the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, to bracket Palestine Action
  with groups such as Islamic State meant the BBC would also be criminally
  liable if it continued to pay royalties to Rooney in view of her stated
  intentions. “Authoritarian governments routinely threaten writers and
  intimidate broadcasters, but I find it quite extraordinary that Labour under
  Keir Starmer has now chosen to go down the same path.” Asked whether Rooney
  could face legal repercussions if she, for example, spoke at a book festival
  in the UK, Kadri said that “there’s certainly a risk she’d fall foul” of the
  law. If Rooney expressed “her views in terms of condemning the war crimes
  being committed in Gaza, an arguable case for prosecution could be made out”.
  “Saying that isn’t for one moment an attempt to justify the statute,” said
  Kadri, which he described as “a shameful attack” on free speech. “It’s just a
  particularly stark illustration of the measure’s gross disproportionality.”
  Mike Schwarz, head of the public inquiry team at the legal firm Hodge Jones
  &amp; Allen, said that “anyone providing money which might, in the state’s
  eyes, fund ‘terrorism’ and, separately, anyone supporting an organisation
  proscribed under terrorism legislation runs a very real risk of serious police
  interest and prosecution for grave offences in the UK. This seems particularly
  the case in the current febrile political climate surrounding Palestine
  Action.”
