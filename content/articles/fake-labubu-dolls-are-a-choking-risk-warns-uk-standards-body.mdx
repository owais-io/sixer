  Growing numbers of counterfeit Labubu dolls being sold in the UK are poorly
  made and pose a choking hazard to young children, a trading standards body has
  warned. The toothy, fluffy monster doll figures, made exclusively by the
  Chinese toymaker Pop Mart, have surged in popularity among children and adults
  after going viral on social media. Celebrity fans include Rihanna and Lisa
  from the K-pop group Blackpink, while many owners like to attach the dolls to
  handbags or backpacks. In a burglary at a Los Angeles store last week,
  thousands of dollars worth of Labubus were taken. Their popularity has
  triggered a surge in fakes, with many being sold by third-party sellers on
  online marketplaces and in local shops that are breaking the law, according to
  the UK’s Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI). Trading standards teams
  have seized thousands of unsafe counterfeit Labubu dolls in recent weeks. In
  just one month, more than 2,000 were confiscated from 13 retailers in North
  Tyneside, with more found in Greater Manchester, Humberside, North Somerset
  and Scotland. Many of the dolls were discovered after tip-offs from concerned
  parents. Kerry Nicol, external affairs manager at CTSI, said: “These dolls are
  fast becoming the latest must-have craze, which is being amplified by social
  media influencers promoting and showcasing ‘unboxing’ of the products on
  platforms such as TikTok and Instagram. Supply and demand means that
  legitimate Labubu dolls are almost impossible to find. “Parents understandably
  want to be able to get their hands on these toys for their children and
  rightly expect the toys they buy to be safe, but dangerous counterfeits are
  finding their way into the market.” Counterfeit Labubu dolls are poorly made
  and unsafe, containing small detachable parts such as eyes, hands and feet,
  which present a serious choking hazard to young children, CTSI said. Loose
  stitching and exposed stuffing increase the risk of suffocation. The fakes
  often breach the UK’s toy safety regulations, lacking CE or UKCA safety
  markings, importer details and required safety warnings. They may also contain
  toxic substances such as lead, harmful dyes or banned plasticisers. Genuine
  Labubu dolls have a distinctive elf-like design and include authenticity
  features such as a holographic POP MART sticker, a scannable QR code linking
  to the official Pop Mart website, and on newer editions a subtle UV stamp on
  one foot, the institute said. Fakes can be spotted via their overly vibrant
  colours and an incorrect number of teeth – authentic Labubus have nine.
  “Everyone involved in the supply chain – from manufacturers and fulfilment
  houses to sellers and marketplaces should have a role to play in ensuring
  unsafe toys never reach the hands of children,” said Nicol.
