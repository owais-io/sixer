  Late-night hosts dig into Donald Trump’s firing of the Bureau of Labor
  Statistics commissioner and an unnerving story about radioactive wasps.
  Stephen Colbert “You know something? No, you don’t,” said Stephen Colbert on
  Monday’s Late Show. “Because things cannot be known any more. What you thought
  you knew is just history.” Especially history, as the Smithsonian removed
  Trump from the impeachment exhibit in the American history museum. “Oh, now
  you care about what’s in the American history museum!” Colbert joked to loud
  boos from the crowd. “Where was that enthusiasm when dad worked so hard to
  plan the family trip to DC?” The museum reportedly removed a label noting both
  of Trump’s impeachments – for bribing Ukraine, and for his role in the January
  6 riots – after pressure from a White House content review. “That kind of
  pressure explains why the Smithsonian exhibit of the 1960s now says that the
  Vietnam war was started by Jimmy Kimmel,” Colbert joked. The exhibit now says
  that “only three presidents have seriously faced removal”, instead of four.
  “Come on! If you’re going to completely make up presidential history, make it
  fun,” said Colbert. A new report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics also
  confirmed that Trump has overseen the worst period of US job growth since the
  pandemic. So naturally, Trump responded by firing the head of the Bureau of
  Labor Statistics. “No, you fool! Now there’s one less job,” Colbert joked.
  “But it makes sense – he fires anyone who gives him bad news.” “Here’s the
  problem with this: having people in the government who know stuff is pretty
  important,” Colbert added. “If Trump starts fudging the job numbers it could
  backfire, by eroding the trust of investors, companies and organizations.” In
  other Trump news, the White House unveiled plans for a new $200m ballroom,
  with gold chandeliers and floor-to-ceiling windows. “Presidents are allowed to
  do a little renovation, of course. The Obamas added a vegetable garden. Truman
  and Nixon both added bowling lanes, and Jimmy Carter famously added a sex
  dungeon,” Colbert joked. But Trump has already paved over the historic rose
  garden with concrete, to make room for more seating. “It reminds me of the
  poem,” Colbert laughed. “Roses are red. Concrete is white. This place looks
  like shit now.” Seth Meyers And on Late Night, Seth Meyers reacted to a report
  that a radioactive wasp nest was found at a site in South Carolina that once
  made nuclear bomb material. The nest reportedly had nuclear contamination
  levels 10 times higher than what is allowed by regulations. “I guess my bug
  spray is going to continue to not work,” Meyers joked. “I have so many
  questions,” he continued. “What do you mean 10 times higher than what’s
  allowed? I wasn’t aware there was a certain level of radiation that’s allowed
  for wasps. Is there like a sweet spot level that is low enough not to kill us
  all but high enough that if a kid on a field trip gets bitten he might turn
  into a superhero?” “If I’ve spent too much time on this wasp story, it’s
  because the rest of the news is shit and I’m stalling,” he added, moving to
  the next worse story: a product recall of High Noon vodka sodas mislabeled as
  Celsius Astro Vibe Sparkling Blue Razz energy drinks. “If you can’t trust
  Celsius Astro Vibe Sparkling Blue Razz, who can you trust?” Meyers quipped.
  “Because, you know, I care about what I put in my body. So when I throw back a
  Celsius Astro Vibe Sparkling Blue Razz, I want to know it has the stuff I care
  about. Like blue, and razz. Celsius Astro Vibe Sparkling Blue Razz might be
  what made the wasps radioactive?” “I think we should embrace this combo moving
  forward, because the two things I need living in these trying times are energy
  and to be a little bit drunk.” Meyers also touched on the news that Trump
  fired the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, after his report
  found that US jobs growth had basically ground to a halt. “Trump doesn’t know
  how to solve a problem. He only knows how to cover it up,” Meyers said. “And
  that’s the hallmark of a corrupt autocracy. When the numbers are bad, just
  fire the people in charge of the numbers. If you’re caught up in a scandal,
  dangle a pardon to get out of it.” But “the problem is it’s backfiring”, he
  concluded. “These stories won’t go away. That’s why Trump always looks like a
  guy who’s been stung by a thousand radioactive wasps.”
