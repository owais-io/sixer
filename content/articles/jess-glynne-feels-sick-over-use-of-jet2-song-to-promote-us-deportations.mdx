  It is the internet meme of the summer, sparking laughter and thousands of wry
  smiles at the pitfalls of a British summer holiday. But the journey of the
  viral Jet2 holiday advert – with its promotional voiceover played out over
  cheerless summer holiday footage, including water-slide disasters and images
  of pouring rain – took a darker turn this week when it was used by the White
  House in a post on X to promote Ice (Immigration and Customs Enforcement)
  deportations. Jess Glynne – whose 2015 single Hold My Hand accompanies the
  advert – responded to the post on Wednesday, saying she felt “sick” that her
  music was being used to spread “division and hate”. She told the Guardian on
  Thursday: “I’m devastated to see my song used in this way. Hold My Hand was
  written about love, support, and standing by someone through everything – it’s
  meant to offer hope and empowerment. Using it to promote something I
  fundamentally disagree with goes completely against the message of the song.”
  On Thursday afternoon Jet2 also condemned the post, saying it was
  “disappointed to see our brand being used to promote government policy such as
  this”. The official White House account posted a clip on X on Wednesday
  evening showing people wearing handcuffs and being taken out of cars and on to
  planes, captioned: “When Ice books you a one-way Jet2 holiday to deportation.
  Nothing beats it!” In the six months since Donald Trump took office, the US
  president has supercharged the country’s immigration enforcement, overseeing a
  sweeping mass arrest and incarceration scheme, which resulted in a record
  number of arrests by immigration officers in June, according to Guardian
  analysis. The post delighted Trump supporters but was decried as disgusting,
  embarrassing and unchristian by critics. Glynne, who has previously joined in
  with the fun spirit of the Jet2 holidays meme by posting a TikTok video miming
  the voiceover, expressed her disapproval of the White House’s appropriation of
  the trend on Instagram. “This post honestly makes me sick,” she wrote. “My
  music is about love, unity and spreading positivity – never about division or
  hate.” Jet2 had previously appeared to welcome the extra publicity generated
  by the meme, launching a challenge that offered a £1,000 holiday voucher as a
  prize. A spokesperson said the company welcomed the “good humour” of the viral
  phenomenon, but not the White House’s contribution. “We are of course aware of
  a post from the White House social media account,” they said. “This is not
  endorsed by us in any way, and we are very disappointed to see our brand being
  used to promote government policy such as this.” The advert’s voiceover actor,
  Zoë Lister, said she would never condone her voiceover “being used in
  promotion with Trump and his abhorrent policies”. She told the BBC: “The Jet2
  meme has spread a lot of joy and humour around the world, but the White House
  video shows that Trump has neither.” The White House Ice deportation post is
  the latest example of an unorthodox digital communications strategy that has
  veered away from previous administrations’ traditional – and relatively sedate
  – use of social media platforms. In February, the White House used X to
  promote Trump’s congestion pricing policy, posting a fake Time magazine front
  cover portraying the president as a monarch, along with the phrase:
  “CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD. Manhattan, and all of New York, is SAVED. LONG
  LIVE THE KING!” The post was described as “revoltingly un-American” by Adam
  Keiper, the executive editor of the conservative Bulwark news site, while New
  York state’s Democratic governor, Kathy Hochul, said: “New York hasn’t
  laboured under a king in over 250 years and we sure as hell are not going to
  start now.” The administration also faced criticism after Trump shared an
  AI-generated video that showed him in a transformed, glittering Gaza, topless
  and sipping a cocktail with Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. After
  criticism, the administration recently posted on X: “Nowhere in the
  constitution does it say we can’t post banger memes.” Last month the Trump
  administration appeared to be on track to oversee one of the deadliest years
  for immigrant detention after the deaths of two men – one from Cuba and
  another from Canada – while in federal custody. Human rights experts have
  raised concerns about the detention of children with their parents at the
  newly recommissioned “family detention centres” in Texas, and while Trump has
  repeatedly claimed his administration is trying to arrest and deport
  “dangerous criminals”, analysis shows that most of the people Ice is now
  arresting have never been convicted of a crime.
