  In the west Dublin suburb of Tallaght, a group of teenagers accosted, beat and
  partially stripped an Indian man, who was then filmed staggering and bleeding.
  Days later a gang attacked another Indian man in the nearby suburb of
  Clondalkin, hitting him in the face, chest, back and legs, leaving him with a
  fracture, gashes and multiple bruises. Days later again, two male passengers
  turned on an Indian taxi driver in the north Dublin suburb of Ballymun,
  striking him across the face with a bottle and shouting: “Go back to your
  country.” Days later, boys in a County Waterford housing estate allegedly
  punched a six-year-old girl in the face, hit her in the genital area with a
  bicycle and told her: “Go back to India.” These are just some of a spate of
  incidents in recent weeks that have sown alarm and bewilderment among the
  Indian community, and other immigrants, in Ireland. In each case police are
  investigating but no charges have yet been brought. Indians held a silent
  protest outside the justice department and the Indian embassy in Dublin has
  urged its citizens to take security precautions and avoid deserted areas.
  Media in India have given prominent coverage to the assaults, a jolt to those
  from the country who had long considered Ireland a safe, welcoming
  destination. “A fellow on a motorbike stopped and hit me in the face when I
  was stopped in traffic,” said a Dublin-based taxi driver from the state of
  Punjab, who declined to be named. “Why is this happening?” Each new incident
  makes the question more urgent. Since the 1990s, immigration has transformed a
  once mono-ethnic country into one where a fifth of the population was born
  overseas. In recent years, anger over a lack of affordable homes has fuelled
  resentment towards immigrants and asylum seekers and led to protests, some
  violent. Thugs posted videos of attacks on tents with refugees from Africa and
  the Middle East. Since June there has been a spate of brutal assaults on
  people from south Asia, many of whom have lived in Ireland for years and are
  taxi drivers, tech workers or medical professionals. “We are accustomed to
  micro-aggressions,” said Fahmeda Naheed, a poet and human rights activist from
  Pakistan who has lived in Cork for 18 years. “We are seeing more physical
  assaults. It is more forceful and aggressive than in the past. It has
  coincided with the housing shortage and antisocial behaviour of the youth.”
  Naheed called for improved policing and procedures to encourage victims to
  come forward, counselling, anti-racism education and hate crime legislation.
  The far right remains a marginal political force but videos of anti-immigrant
  rallies are widely shared. A recent one shows a man in a playground telling a
  small crowd with Irish tricolours that immigrants are arriving who are not fit
  to work yet are buying property. “They’re never going to integrate either.
  Islam should never be allowed into a Christian country,” he said, prompting
  cheers. Amal Women Ireland, a group that provides support to Muslim women,
  expressed alarm after what it called a “violent, racially motivated” assault
  on a colleague at a Dublin bus stop on 30 June. An open letter posted on
  Reddit purportedly from an Indian nurse says the author and dozens of
  colleagues are thinking of quitting Ireland because of abuse and fear. It
  cites an incident in which Irish teenagers bullied and mocked an
  eight-year-old Indian girl. “What kind of place is this becoming? We came to
  Ireland to save lives and now we’re scared to walk home after a shift,” it
  says. The letter is anonymous and the Guardian has not been able to verify the
  authenticity, but it has gone viral and amplified concern at racism and
  xenophobia. “I’m seeing a side of us that I don’t like,” Jennifer Whitmore, a
  legislator with the Social Democrats, posted this week on social media. “I
  think that some people’s fear of being left behind is being hijacked by a
  small minority of toxic individuals whose only objective is chaos, hatred and
  a divided society.”
