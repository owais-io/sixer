  For the price of more than 180 pints of milk, or nearly 60kg of rice, you can
  get your hands on the new Louis Vuitton lipstick. For £120 ($160), 55 shades –
  27 satin and 28 matte – will go on sale in the UK, marking a new high in the
  redrawing of lipstick from relative mundanity to hyper-luxury product. The
  lipstick is part of Louis Vuitton’s debut makeup collection, which goes on
  sale this weekend and also includes eyeshadow palettes (£190) and lip balms
  (also £120). The lipstick has been designed in partnership with the makeup
  artist Pat McGrath, who has worked backstage at Louis Vuitton shows for two
  decades and also played a role in developing makeup lines for brands such as
  Gucci and Giorgio Armani. It follows a clutch of brands releasing lipsticks
  that cost as much as many people’s weekly shop. Celine last year launched its
  first lipstick for £62. Chanel has one in a glass case, inspired by the
  mirrors that line the stairs in Coco Chanel’s Paris apartment, for £145.
  Hermès, famed for its multithousand-pound Birkin bag, launched one for £81 in
  2020. In 2023, Dior launched a special-edition lipstick priced at $500. Big
  fashion brands have been turning to makeup more generally. According to
  Daniela Morosini, a senior beauty correspondent and special projects editor at
  The Business of Fashion, “beauty products make lots and lots of money for
  fashion house brands. The margins are great”. Victoria Beckham is one notable
  example. The brand broke the £100m sales mark this week, despite widening
  operating losses, in a surge that is largely being credited to the strong
  performance of beauty – in particular a £32 eyeliner, which is reportedly sold
  once every 30 seconds worldwide. For customers, makeup is a – relatively –
  accessible way of buying into luxury brands, particularly given the hugely
  inflated current price of high-end fashion: a Chanel medium Classic Flap bag,
  for instance, that cost $4,900 in 2015 now costs $10,200. Made from upcycled
  wax, smooth to apply and with a punchy pigment, the Louis Vuitton lipsticks
  carry the scent of mimosa, jasmine and rose. The weighty black and gold
  packaging – the work of the industrial designer Konstantin Grcic – is
  magnetised, easing the sliding of the LV-embossed lipstick back into its case
  with a satisfying low click. Think £120 for a lipstick sounds extortionate?
  According to Philip Graves, the founder of consumer psychology group Shift
  Consultancy, “it all depends on your frame of reference … if you’re normally
  someone who goes into Boots and buys No 7 lipstick, you’re not going to become
  someone who goes into Louis Vuitton and spends £120 on lipstick.” However, “if
  you’re someone who goes into Louis Vuitton every now and then and buys
  yourself a £4,000 bag, now you might go in and go: ‘That lipstick’s
  fantastic.’ You’ve just, in inverted commas, ‘saved’ yourself over £3,800.”
  Plus, “it’s probably the cheapest thing in there by some considerable
  distance. From a consumer psychology point of view, that gives you a framing
  advantage.” For Morosini, the relative cheapness compared with LV suitcases,
  say, “does kind of open the aperture to a newer customer”. Louis Vuitton is,
  after all, the brand that famously launched a $1m handbag in 2023. Having
  McGrath involved is a boon. “Her signature, at least in beauty and fashion
  circles, really means something,” said Morosini. Hannah Coates, a beauty,
  wellness and lifestyle editor and brand consultant, said: “With McGrath at the
  helm, I expect the formula is excellent quality and the colours flattering on
  an array of different skin tones.” Although, notably, McGrath’s own makeup
  line sells lipsticks in Harrods for £27. According to the fashion psychologist
  Dr Dion Terrelonge, price point, rather than a hindrance, “is a big part of
  the appeal”, with lipsticks like this “being used as a social signifier of
  class and wealth and standing”. Dr Anastasia Kārkliņa Gabriel, a culture
  critic and author of Cultural Intelligence for Marketers, said: “Aggressive
  pricing creates an added layer of exclusivity that becomes desirable to
  consumers … Being willing to pay £120 for a lipstick becomes a way to express
  something about who you are in the world, or who you aspire to be.” Coates
  thinks we “could be seeing LV’s bid to tap into the ‘lipstick index’, which is
  the theory that sales of luxury cosmetics – particularly lipstick – tend to
  rise during times of economic downturn”. While Graves is sceptical of the
  lipstick index, “not least because the person who coined the term was someone
  who owned a lipstick company”, as a broad principle “people do find other ways
  to get a sense of reward when times are hard”. It helps that lipstick is a
  product you can be seen to use. “For something to have status value, other
  people have got to see it,” said Graves. “Of course you can go and tell
  people, but that’s generally not as effective. Much better that you casually
  take it out and top up your lipstick.” Louis Vuitton’s lipstick is refillable
  and being framed as an object to keep, which Gabriel thinks is a big part of
  its appeal. “The refillable lipstick product becomes the product to purchase
  for its material benefits, while the case carries that symbolic access to the
  world of luxury that is meant to feel exclusive, exquisite and deeply
  aspirational.” The packaging is key, as well as the sensory experience of the
  product. Morosini remembers the New York-based makeup artist Kirsten Kjaer
  Weis once saying she wanted her brand’s compacts to have a clunk when they
  shut that sounded like the trunk of a Mercedes-Benz being closed. If some
  people are outraged by the price of this top-end lippie, that may also be part
  of the equation. “This pricing strategy, while bold even by luxury standards,
  also serves the brand’s marketing purposes by driving awareness and generating
  attention around the product and the brand,” said Gabriel.
