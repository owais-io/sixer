  Jess Breach said scoring 50 tries for England is a “phenomenal” emotion and it
  would “mean everything” to the wing to win a 50th cap in her home county. The
  27-year-old took her Red Roses try tally to 52 with a hat-trick in England’s
  14-try win against Samoa at the Rugby World Cup on Saturday. Breach is just
  the fifth Red Rose to hit 50 tries for England and she reached the milestone
  on her 49th cap. She could win her 50th against Australia in Brighton on
  Saturday. “Fifty tries is a phenomenal feeling but I think the forwards did a
  big job in the middle,” she said. “The inside backs were able to release me to
  get over the white line. It means everything: there is so much history within
  the Red Roses and to be able to pass 50 tries is incredible. I am sure Ellie
  [Kildunne] and Abby [Dow] will be there soon as well. It is really nice we are
  all still playing in our prime and our future is about how many tries we can
  score. [It would mean] everything. Today was really special to score 50 tries
  but to have 50 caps for your country is amazing and for it to be in my home
  county would be phenomenal. The game has never gone down to Sussex before so
  to be able to get my 50th potentially would be amazing, but we have just got
  to see what Mitch [head coach John Mitchell] has got up his sleeve.” While
  Breach had her special moment, Samoa enjoyed their own by scoring their first
  World Cup points in 11 years. They came when Harmony Vatau slotted a kick
  after Samoa won a scrum penalty. Samoa’s celebrations when the kick was
  successful were huge. “They have done an amazing job by getting here and they
  definitely fronted up,” Breach said. “It wasn’t an easy game for us and it was
  phenomenal to see how glad they were to get their three points. Obviously
  after the game they were even more buzzing to celebrate that and it is really
  special, you can’t take that moment away from them.” Both teams were
  inspirational on the pitch and the England prop Sarah Bern wants to inspire
  other people’s confidence by growing her social media presence, with the help
  of her former Bristol Bears teammate Ilona Maher. “One day she was filming me
  and from there she was like ‘you have a brilliant personality you need to show
  the world that’,” Bern said. “I am very thankful for that time with Ilona. She
  is a brilliant person, her family are amazing as well. They are so incredibly
  supportive of women’s rugby and myself.” Bern has played in both of England’s
  World Cup games but is in competition with Maud Muir. “We both have massive
  respect for each other,” Bern said. “We both enjoy each other’s company which
  probably baffles people considering we are both going for the same shirt but
  there’s massive respect. We are very similar players but very different at the
  same time so it is whatever is going to give to the team.”
