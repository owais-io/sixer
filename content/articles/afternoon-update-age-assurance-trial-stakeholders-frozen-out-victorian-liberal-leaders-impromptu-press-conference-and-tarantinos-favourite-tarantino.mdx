  Good afternoon. The organisation behind the age assurance technology trial
  that will inform how to keep under-16s off social media has iced out key
  stakeholders after media leaks and resignations of two members. Iain Corby,
  the executive director of the Age Verification Providers Association, has also
  downplayed reporting about inaccuracies with the facial estimation technology
  – one of the technologies tested in the trial – arguing that it can still be
  used even if it is out by seven years. The trial, run by the UK-based Age
  Check Certification Scheme (ACCS), tested out various types of technology that
  could be used by social media platforms and adult websites to keep out
  under-16s or under-18s, respectively, when Australia’s ban comes into force in
  December. The project provided its final report to the communications
  minister, Anika Wells, at the start of August. However, the stakeholder
  advisory board for the trial – which comprises tech companies, child safety
  advocates, academics and privacy advocates – may not see the final report
  until Wells releases it publicly in the coming weeks. Top news Victorian
  Liberal leader defends impromptu press conference at scene of fatal stabbing
