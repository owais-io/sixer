  Born in Essex in 1989, musician Sam Ryder found fame covering hits on TikTok
  during the 2020 lockdown. In 2022, he represented the UK at the Eurovision
  song contest, finishing second to Ukraine with his hit Space Man. The
  following year, he was nominated for best new artist at the Brit awards. Ryder
  headlines the Ovo Arena, Wembley, on 6 November, and his new single, OH OK, is
  out now. He lives in Essex with his partner, Lois Gaskin-Barber. This was
  taken at The Underworld in Camden, north-west London, when I was in a band
  called the Morning After with my friends from school. The gig was probably
  awful – but what we lacked in tightness, we definitely made up for in
  enthusiasm. When I look at this photo, I see the arrogance of youth. I’d have
  probably got wasted after the gig and stayed up all night. The foot on the amp
  – it’s like I’m playing the part of a rock star. I was convinced we were going
  to make it, and I had no insecurities whatsoever, which is a total superpower
  at 19. As you get older, that kind of mindset can cause problems – arrogance
  and a detachment from reality. But when you’re young, it fuels your dreams. If
  I wasn’t deluded, what else would I have had? I came from a working-class
  family, I had no foot in the door. All I had was my ambition and the stories I
  could tell. The Morning After’s music was an amalgamation of Iron Maiden, Sum
  41 and Megadeth, but I couldn’t write anything nearly as good as those bands.
  That didn’t stop us from touring in mainland Europe, mostly playing to no one.
  The alternative was working full-time in an industry I wasn’t passionate
  about. Instead, we borrowed my bandmate’s van from his tiling job, and played
  wherever anyone would let us. My dad was a carpenter, my mum worked in Boots
  and then as a dental assistant. They grafted every hour they could. My parents
  didn’t have connections in the music world, but they did everything they could
  to help me get there, like driving me to gigs. For a while, I had a job in
  McDonald’s, but I got into a fight with some people who came into the
  drive-thru one night. I’ve always had long hair, apart from one unfortunate
  haircut I had as a kid where I looked like Mr Spock. Maldon in Essex could be
  a hostile environment for anyone who looked “alternative”. My dad didn’t want
  me doing shifts there any more, so I ended up working part-time with him in
  carpentry and labouring on building sites. After the metal band broke up, I
  joined a punk band called Close Your Eyes. It was a proper rock’n’roll
  lifestyle – drinking, smoking, being a nuisance and barely being able to sing
  the next day. But after a few years of touring, my bandmates met their
  girlfriends and started to put their instruments down for something more
  settled. Lois, who I’ve been with for 13 years, is my first real girlfriend.
  Before I met her, all I wanted was a life on the road. Not that I actively
  avoided female attention – I was awkward, with braces and a mullet. Nobody was
  coming forward! But it did mean I had a lot of spare time to obsess over
  Megadeth songs in my bedroom instead. In my mid-20s, the delusion was finally
  over and I made a promise to myself that I’d stop joining new bands that were
  on the brink of breaking up. I was like a flea on the back of a series of dead
  dogs, and it was all about ego. I just wanted people to see I was touring the
  world, so they’d think, “Wow, he has been a successful artist since leaving
  school!” The reality was, I had no kind of foundation or constant in my life.
  I also had no money. I remember, after one tour, being in line at Nando’s and
  trying to pay for my order, but my card getting declined. I went to the ATM
  and realised I was over my overdraft. At that moment, I thought, “I’m fed up
  with this. Something has to change.” I was constantly seeing friends on
  Facebook moving into new houses or celebrating work promotions. Meanwhile, I
  couldn’t afford a chicken wrap in a business park in Leicester. After that, I
  decided to focus on my own music and started recording in my parents’ shed. It
  was then that Mum suggested I start a wedding band. For eight years, me and my
  friends made a business out of it. I learned about taking care of my voice and
  what it means to really be a musician, rather than just pretending to be a
  rock star. There was no ego, because nobody cared about what I was doing
  musically. Things would always go wrong. Once, a couple had told us a
  different first dance from the one they actually wanted and we needed to
  figure out the new one on the spot, and there were times where big family
  fights erupted and we had to keep on playing. But, mostly, we just made a lot
  of people happy. It took until I was in my 30s for my solo career to take off.
  It was in lockdown, and I was posting TikTok videos from my parents’ shed. The
  stars aligned, my profile got a lot of traction and I was blown away by the
  response. It was incredible, but also a strange sensation, as I was starting
  to make peace with just playing weddings. Instead, my life changed overnight.
  In January 2022, I got a call about doing Eurovision from the president of the
  record label I was on. My immediate reaction was, “Sick. I love Eurovision.”
  Then that other, more negative voice crept in: “What about the perception?
  It’s a poisoned chalice. You’re going to ruin your career.” In the end, I
  trusted my heart. On the night of the results, I had the Ukrainian flag with
  me in my pocket. The scores were coming in and it was close. But I knew that I
  couldn’t go up and accept the award. Eurovision has always been about putting
  a spotlight on something that needs it, and I was adamant, however high we
  scored, Ukraine were the real winners. At the start of my career, I
  inadvertently built a brand around myself. This sort of sunny, optimistic
  person. It wasn’t strictly who I was, because no human on Earth is like that
  all the time. We all have seasons. It wasn’t fake, either – I was just stoked
  to have this opportunity. I thought that bringing negativity into a
  conversation was bad manners and that I should put a smile on my face, no
  matter how I felt. Now, I’m trying to have more authentic connections with
  people, and I don’t feel the pressure to be an endlessly positive caricature.
  There are still days when I feel an immense lack of self-confidence and lose
  my spark, but now I know how to get balance back in my life. It’s why I like
  to live out in the countryside, why I don’t subscribe to famous friends and
  keep my circle small, because all the people that were there at the beginning
  are still here now. I may not have fronted the biggest band in the world, as I
  thought I was about to when that photo was taken, but without that failure I’d
  have also never tasted defeat. It tastes horrible, but it’s the best suit of
  armour you will ever get.
