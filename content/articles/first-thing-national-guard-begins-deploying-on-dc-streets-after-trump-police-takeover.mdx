  Good morning. The Washington DC national guard began deploying on the city’s
  streets on Tuesday night, as the city’s mayor toughened her response to Donald
  Trump taking control of the city’s police force. The unusual federalization of
  law enforcement in the US capital began a day after the president ordered the
  troops’ arrival, calling Washington DC a “lawless” city despite official crime
  statistics saying otherwise, a White House official confirmed. About 850
  officers and agents took part in a “massive law enforcement surge” across
  Washington DC on Monday night and made nearly two dozen arrests, the White
  House has said. The violent crime rate in Washington DC is at a 30-year low.
  What did Washington’s mayor say? Muriel Bowser, the Democratic mayor of
  Washington, hardened her stance after treading a more diplomatic line earlier
  in the day. During a live event on social media on Tuesday night, she
  described the arrival of federalized national guard members as an
  authoritarian push. Other critics have said the move seeks to distract
  attention from political problems such as the Jeffrey Epstein files. Israel
  intensifies bombing of Gaza, killing 89 Palestinians in 24 hours Israel has
  intensified its bombing of Gaza, killing at least 89 Palestinians in 24 hours,
  including at least 15 people lining up for food, despite global outcry over
  the deaths of six journalists in the territory on the day before. Gaza’s civil
  defence agency said Israeli airstrikes on Gaza City had intensified in the
  three days after Benjamin Netanyahu’s security cabinet approved plans to
  expand the war in the territory. Five more people, including two children,
  were reported to have died of starvation, as the foreign ministers of 24
  countries including the UK, Australia, France, Spain and Japan warned that
  “humanitarian suffering in Gaza has reached unimaginable levels”. What is the
  humanitarian cost of Israel’s assault on Gaza? Over the past 22 months of war,
  more than 61,000 people have been killed in Gaza. Disease and sickness are
  rife in the territory as solid waste accumulates and people live tightly
  packed together, with limited access to clean water or hygiene products. How
  many people have now died of starvation? The total number of hunger-related
  deaths recorded is now 227, including 103 children, according to Gaza’s health
  ministry. And Gaza is facing a new threat as diseases resistant to antibiotics
  spread, research reveals. What is the situation with sick children in Gaza
  awaiting evacuation? Getting approved for a medical evacuation is an arduous
  process that can take years. Gaza’s ministry of health says more than 16,000
  patients need treatment abroad, with 600 dying while still waiting to travel,
  many of them children. Ukraine will not cede land that could be Russian
  springboard for new war, Zelenskyy says Ukraine’s president has said his
  country could not agree to a Russian proposal to give up more territory in
  exchange for a ceasefire because Moscow would use what it gained as a
  springboard to start a future war. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he did not believe
  that Donald Trump supported Russia’s demands, and he expressed hope the US
  president would act as an honest mediator when he meets Vladimir Putin in
  Alaska on Friday. Zelenskyy warned that Russia was planning new offensives on
  three parts of the frontline. He said there was no sign that Russia was
  preparing to implement a ceasefire, as reports emerged that small sabotage
  groups had pierced Ukrainian defences in the eastern Donbas, advancing about 6
  miles (10km) in three days. In other news … UN investigators warned that
  children as young as two years old have been detained by Myanmar’s military,
  often as proxies for their parents and held in prison facilities where there
  is systematic torture. A train with at least 35 cars carrying hazardous
  materials derailed in Texas on Tuesday, as emergency services responded to the
  accident in Palo Pinto county. A medical journal warned against using ChatGPT
  for health information, after a man developed a rare condition following an
  interaction with the chatbot about removing table salt from his diet. In the
  UK, gender non-conforming people have spoken out about abuse in public
  toilets, after a UK supreme court ruling in April on “biological sex” that has
  been criticized for discriminating against trans and gender non-conforming
  people. Stat of the day: Otter pelts, Orthodox priests and a $7.2m bargain –
  how Russia sold Alaska to the US in 1867 Alaska remained part of the Russian
  empire under Tsar Alexander II until its sale to the US in 1867. Yet the price
  – $7.2m – struck many in Russia as insultingly low. Will Friday’s high-stakes
  summit between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump result in a warming of historic
  ties? Don’t miss this: ‘It felt like a scene from The Handmaid’s Tale’ –
  American comics at Edinburgh festival on the dangers of political satire Three
  US comics at the UK’s Edinburgh festival discuss the threats to freedom of
  speech under the Trump administration. Sam Jay, a former Saturday Night Live
  writer, explores the state of America in her show We the People. She describes
  it as “a fun, risky little ride” as she tries to get to the root of why the US
  feels so divided. Climate check: Thousands evacuated in Spain amid deadly
  wildfires and new European heatwave About 6,000 people have been evacuated
  from their homes in northern, central and southern Spain as wildfires continue
  to burn amid a heatwave with forecasts of up to 112F. The deadly heat across
  Europe has created what scientists have called a “molotov cocktail” of
  climatic conditions that is fuelling vast wildfires. Last Thing: ‘Deceptively
  cute’ ancient whale with razor-sharp teeth and eyes the size of tennis balls
  discovered in Australia Scientists have discovered a new species of ancient
  whale, from a 25-million-year-old fossil found in Australia. According to
  researchers, Janjucetus dullardi was about the size of a dolphin and had
  razor-sharp teeth. “This was a really gnarly whale that I personally wouldn’t
  want to get in the water with,” one scientist said. Sign up First Thing is
