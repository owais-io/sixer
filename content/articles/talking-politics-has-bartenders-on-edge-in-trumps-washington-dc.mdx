  Deke Dunne relocated to Washington DC from Wyoming in 2008 to pursue a career
  in politics. Though a progressive himself, he worked as a legislative aide for
  the Republican senator Mike Enzi and spent many nights at local watering
  holes, guzzling $10 pitchers and eating wings with fellow broke staffers from
  both sides of the aisle. Long before he began moonlighting as a bartender, he
  learned that talking politics in DC bars was always a recipe for disaster.
  “When I used to work in politics, I would spend a lot of time in bars near
  Capitol Hill,” said Dunne, “so I was exposed to more political professionals.
  In those spaces, you often find yourself witnessing knockdown, drag-out
  arguments about politics.” Today, Dunne is one of DC’s most influential
  mixologists, having abandoned politics almost a decade ago for a hospitality
  career. Serving drinks in a city that is more ideologically divided than ever,
  Dunne says he exercises more diplomacy behind the bar now than he ever did
  working in politics. There has always been an unspoken rule among Washington
  DC bartenders, according to Dunne, that political conversations across the bar
  should be avoided at all costs. It is generally understood that maintaining
  neutrality is critical to ensuring that guests of all political persuasions
  feel welcome. But the partisan rancor in Washington during the early stages of
  Donald Trump’s presidential encore has created palpable tension in hospitality
  spaces, placing undue strain on staff to manage the vibes. “It’s always been
  an accepted truth in DC that every four to eight years, you get a whole new
  swath of people in from a different political ideology and if you want to have
  a strong, viable business, you don’t talk politics,” said Dunne. “Trump broke
  that rule.” According to local bar professionals in the nation’s capital, the
  “tending” part of bartending has never been more challenging. “Politics in DC
  is not only something that a lot of people care about, but it’s also a lot of
  people’s livelihoods,” said Zac Hoffman, a bar industry veteran who until
  recently managed the restaurant inside the National Democratic Club near the
  Capitol. “When you’re talking about work, you’re talking about politics.
  That’s just the reality of where we live. It’s a company town.” At Allegory,
  where Dunne oversees the beverage program, the bar has always taken a
  progressive approach, which occasionally provokes more conservative-minded
  guests who stay in the Eaton, the boutique hotel and cultural hub in downtown
  where the bar opened seven years ago. Its aesthetic and cocktail menu
  reimagines Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland, but featuring a young Ruby
  Bridges, the iconic civil rights activist who faced a jeering mob when she
  desegregated a New Orleans elementary school. “Our very presence as a
  mission-based bar has sparked many conversations surrounding our concept, but
  also gender-neutral bathrooms, provocative art and advocacy,” he said. “We’ve
  had people that are clearly uncomfortable with our concept leave and then post
  a negative review but frame it about something else.” The resurgent, and often
  strident, brand of conservatism that dominates the political sphere in
  Washington today has many of the city’s more progressive bar owners on edge.
  At The Green Zone, a Middle Eastern cocktail bar in Adams Morgan on the city’s
  north side, politics have always been integral to the bar’s identity since it
  opened in 2018. Bar owner Chris Hassaan Francke, whose mother is Iraqi, has
  earned a reputation for being outspoken about political conflicts, especially
  those in the Middle East. But since Trump’s return to office, he admits to
  having toned down some of the rhetoric. “We changed the name of one of our
  most infamous cocktails [which contained an incendiary reference to the
  current president],” said Francke. “It kills me that I can’t always say
  everything I want to say, but ultimately the safety and wellbeing of my staff
  [are] more important than that.” While the city may be under Republican rule
  at the moment, DC itself is still overwhelmingly liberal (Kamala Harris won
  over 90% of the vote in the 2024 election), which means that a majority of its
  hospitality workers are liberal, too. “I know some bartenders who will say the
  opposite of what they believe around customers they don’t agree with
  politically,” said Hoffman. “There are plenty of socialists who make great
  tips talking shit about liberals with Republicans.” It isn’t only the more
  progressive venues around town that have become targets. After recent articles
  in the New York Times and Washington Post championed the upscale Capitol Hill
  bistro Butterworth’s as a haven for Maga sympathizers, backlash ensued.
  According to chef and co-owner Bart Hutchins – who, like Dunne, also left a
  career in politics to work in hospitality – being perceived as pro-Trump has
  attracted crowds to his fledgling restaurant, which opened last fall. But it’s
  also created some unwanted operational challenges. For one, a serial
  provocateur with an air-horn routinely disrupts his weekly dinner service by
  sounding it through the front entrance, often multiple times a week. Despite
  Butterworth’s reputation for being a sanctuary for high-profile Trump
  supporters such as Steve Bannon, not every political conversation at the bar
  is peaceful. “I’ve broken up at least three political arguments since we
  opened,” said Hutchins. “It always starts with somebody who’s really, really
  insistent that everyone agrees with them, someone who’s watching way too much
  cable news who’s really determined to have their Sean Hannity or Rachel Maddow
  moment.” Another unfortunate byproduct of being known as a right-leaning
  restaurant in a left-leaning town, Hutchins says, has been difficulty hiring
  and retaining staff. “There have been times where it’s been really hard to
  hire people,” he said. “Early on, we had some servers self-select out and say:
  ‘I don’t want to serve these people.’ But a lot of those people have moved
  on.” Over time, the staff has found ways to put their political convictions
  aside for the good of the restaurant. “Our No 1 rule that’s written on a door
  in the back is: ‘Everybody’s a VIP,” said Hutchins. “We’re not interested in
  using politics as a measuring device for whether or not someone deserves great
  service.” For DC bars, proximity to Capitol Hill has historically increased
  the likelihood that the conversations inside them will revolve around
  politics. And while some bars on the Hill may welcome these spirited
  conversations, many older, legacy bars prefer that patrons leave their
  partisanship at the door. Tune Inn, a well-loved dive bar that originally
  opened a few blocks from the Capitol in 1947, outwardly discourages political
  conversations of any kind. “You can always tell the newbies because they want
  to come in and immediately start talking about politics,” said Stephanie
  Hulbert, who has worked as a bartender, server and now general manager at the
  bar for more than 17 years. “They get shut down very quickly.” To keep the
  peace and maintain non-partisan decorum inside the bar, she and her staff
  regularly intervene and admonish guests to keep their politics to themselves.
  These interventions occur at least two or three times every week, according to
  Hulbert, which is why the TVs inside the bar are deliberately set to sports
  channels rather than news outlets. “I’ll argue about sports all day long with
  you,” she said. “But I won’t argue about politics.” Despite the heightened
  anxiety in Washington, Dunne is optimistic that healthy dialogues in more
  progressive bars including Allegory can effect positive change. In January,
  Trump’s inauguration drew conservative revelers to the Eaton, where
  inclusivity and multiculturalism is essential to its brand and mission. That
  led to some uncomfortable conversations with Republican patrons about the
  bar’s progressive ethos. “I don’t know how effective the conversations were,
  but they were constructive,” he said. “We found middle ground about the fact
  that what Ruby [Bridges] went through was tragic. It’s common ground you don’t
  find very often around here any more.” • This article was amended on 5 August
  2025 to correct that Ruby Bridges desegregated an elementary school in New
  Orleans, Louisiana, not in Little Rock, Arkansas.
