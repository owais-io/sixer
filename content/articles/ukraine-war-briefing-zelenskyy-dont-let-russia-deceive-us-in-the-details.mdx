  Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia seemed “more inclined to a ceasefire” after a
  visit to Moscow on Wednesday by a US envoy. “The pressure on them works. But
  the main thing is that they do not deceive us in the details – neither us nor
  the US,” Ukraine’s president said in his nightly address. Despite the
  engagement, sanctions targeting Russian oil “are still expected to be
  implemented on Friday”, a senior Trump administration official said on
  Wednesday, according to Reuters. Separately, Marco Rubio, the US secretary of
  state, said he did not want to exaggerate the progress made during Steve
  Witkoff’s talks with Putin. Many “impediments” remained, especially Russia’s
  territorial claims, and there was no concrete proposal for a ceasefire. There
  have been unconfirmed reports that the Kremlin could propose a halt to
  long-range strikes by both sides. Donald Trump could meet Vladimir Putin as
  soon as next week to discuss the war, White House officials have said,
  although senior administration officials warned that serious “impediments”
  remain to achieving a ceasefire. Trump told reporters at the White House on
  Wednesday: “There’s a good chance that there will be a meeting very soon.” He
  gave no indication where the meeting with Putin might take place. After
  sitting down with Putin, Trump then wants a three-way meeting with the Russian
  ruler and Zelenskyy, the New York Times and CNN reported, citing people
  familiar with the plan. The US president has proclaimed that “great progress
  was made” when Witkoff, a real estate dealer, met the Russian ruler at the
  Kremlin on Wednesday. Trump-Putin meetings about Ukraine have been raised as a
  possibility in the past but not eventuated. Trump has promised to introduce
  secondary tariffs on countries that import Russian oil if no progress is made
  towards a peace deal by Friday. On Wednesday, he issued an executive order
  imposing an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods, citing India’s continuing
  imports of Russian oil. Russian artillery shelling killed three people and
  injured four on Wednesday in the south-eastern Ukrainian town of Nikopol, the
  regional governor said. Serhiy Lysak, governor of Dnipropetrovsk region, said
  two men and a woman died. Nikopol is on the Ukrainian-held north side of the
  Dnipro River. The RBK-Ukraine media outlet said the strike hit a car belonging
  to the state emergency services and one of those killed was an emergency
  worker. A US army soldier has been arrested for trying to provide classified
  information about America’s M1A2 Abrams main battle tank to Russia, the
  justice department said. Taylor Adam Lee, 22, of El Paso, Texas, is accused of
  seeking to “provide classified military information on US tank vulnerabilities
  to a person he believed to be a Russian intelligence officer in exchange for
  Russian citizenship”, said Roman Rozhavsky, assistant director of FBI
  counterintelligence. Lee handed over an SD card containing documents and
  information to an individual he believed to be a Russian agent, it is alleged.
  A majority of Ukrainians still trust Zelenskyy but their number fell to 58% of
  the population after an abortive move to curb the power of anti-corruption
  watchdogs led to protests, according to polling. The Kyiv International
  Institute of Sociology said on Wednesday that its poll, which began a day
  after the shock vote on 22 July, found trust was down from an 18-month high of
  74% in May and 67% in February-March. Zelenskyy on Wednesday said he had
  visited troops near the frontline in the Sumy region. Ukraine on Wednesday
  appointed a new director of an economic crimes investigation unit. The prime
  minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, said Oleksandr Tsyvinsky, a renowned anti-graft
  detective, would head the economic security bureau. The director is chosen by
  a panel including international experts and then confirmed by the government.
  The government had for weeks held back his appointment, citing family ties to
  Russia. Svyrydenko said Tsyvinsky took a polygraph test as part of the
  appointment process. Marta Kos, the EU’s enlargement commissioner, welcomed
  the appointment as a “crucial reform strongly encouraged by the EU”.
