  The late Dutch author and Holocaust survivor Marga Minco once wrote about an
  empty house in Amsterdam where she and a group of artists and students took
  refuge towards the end of the second world war. Last month, the house she
  lived in for decades was squatted by a new generation of the dispossessed. In
  the Dutch capital’s overpriced, overcrowded housing market, where homes fetch
  more per square metre on average than they do in London, the squatters, or
  krakers, are back. They are the byproduct of a crisis that has spiralled out
  of control, in which growing anger is justifiably focused on a startling and
  unsustainable unfairness: the cost of the country’s generous tax breaks for
  homeowners, who make up more than half of the population, is being borne by
  hard-working tenants. The return of squatting is a symptom of a public mood
  that is increasingly furious about the lack of solutions. And with a general
  election on 29 October, it is an anger that could be politically decisive.
  Squatting was made a criminal offence in the Netherlands, partly in response
  to the Vondelstraat riots of 1980, during which military tanks rolled on to
  the streets for the first time since the second world war to battle the
  squatters. But barely a month goes by now without reports of riot police being
  called in to clear another squat. In June, riot police emptied one such
  property in the De Pijp district of Amsterdam, a neighbourhood the tourist
  guides call bohemian and charming. The squatted premises had previously lain
  empty for more than two years. A few days after Minco’s former home was
  squatted, another on the Plantage Kerklaan was cleared by riot police. The
  confrontational mood should come as no surprise to the authorities when the
  number of property “millionaires” has never been greater, at the cost of
  taxpayers and a generation priced out of the housing market. Take Raoul, 28,
  whom I spoke to recently. He has a university degree and comes from a
  home-owning family, but he has nowhere to live so has become a squatter. Like
  many of his contemporaries, Raoul has qualifications, work experience and is
  looking for a job, but he knows that even if he finds work, that is no
  guarantee of an affordable and stable home. Raoul’s take on it may be
  anecdotal, but he thinks the Dutch squatting movement, which began in the
  1960s and had by the 1980s acquired an anarchist tone, is back. “Well, that’s
  the aim,” he told me. “I think that the same conditions are there. The housing
  need is as high, perhaps even higher. Kraken is coming back, even though it is
  now criminalised.” What is indisputable are the official figures. They show
  that the Netherlands has a shortage of more than 400,000 properties, with
  81,000 people looking for their first home. With prices at their highest ever
  level and new rent-control laws in place, thousands of private landlords have
  been exiting the rental market. More properties may be for sale, but at prices
  that most other Europeans would find absurd, particularly given the subsidence
  and flooding risks that often come with them. For a lot of young people, the
  only options are illegal sublets or exploitative room rentals. Regulations
  attach strict price controls to rooms in shared houses, making landlords loth
  to rent, while universities do not offer residential hall spaces. “It’s only
  getting harder,” says Maaike Krom, chair of the LSVb (Dutch student union).
  “We heard a story about someone who travelled more than three hours for school
  because not all studies are available in every city. We don’t realise what the
  effects are for young people to have that much stress about travelling,
  finding a house, financial issues … when in five years they need to be part of
  the economy and build the future.” So what can be done about it? The broad
  economic consensus that the Netherlands must phase out its tax breaks for
  homeowners is a positive. House prices are inflated by the country’s level of
  mortgage debt to GDP, which is the highest in the EU. The European Commission
  has called five times for the Netherlands to limit risky housing debt and
  scrap its mortgage interest relief – most recently in June – alongside the
  country’s DNB central bank, leading housing experts and economists. But the
  biggest attitude shift needs to happen among the 57% of Dutch who own a home.
  Until these wealthy burghers accept that they have no right to a public
  subsidy through mortgage tax relief, which costs about €11.2bn a year and
  increases the tax burden by 1.5 percentage points for even basic rate
  taxpayers, the Netherlands is looking at a future where the “have nots” have
  ever less to lose. Instead of rubbing their hands at their accumulation of
  paper wealth, they should realise that every €100,000 they “make” on housing
  is indirectly billed to their children – contributing in Amsterdam to a city
  in which only the wealthiest internationals can afford to live. Dutch voters
  have in effect chosen a policy that prices out their own people. Jona van
  Loenen, a writer and entrepreneur, sees it as a threat to the Netherlands’
  future prosperity when banks invest in mortgages instead of growing companies
  and owning a house is a better wealth model than starting a business. As he
  puts it: “We’re creating one of the most perverse incentives a society can
  have: one where people just sit at home on the sofa instead of actually doing
  something.” Of course, the solution to a housing shortage is also to build,
  and the Netherlands plans to construct nearly 1m homes by 2030 – but this
  project is already battling against the interests of existing property owners.
  The consequences of inaction become clear when you consider that only 4.5% of
  homes in the Netherlands could be bought by a household on the average income
  last year, according to figures from the Dutch land registry, Kadaster. Less
  than a decade ago, in 2017, someone earning the average salary could afford
  23% of properties. Prices have almost doubled in the past 10 years. Since
  2014, the Dutch population has also increased by about 1 million through
  immigration – but this is largely to fill jobs. Despite far-right posturing on
  asylum, applications dropped last year and this year, the Netherlands has
  taken below the EU average. The country’s generosity to Ukrainian refugees
  dramatically increased the pressure on housing, while a number of industries
  depend on some 850,000 migrant workers, who are often underpaid and, according
  to the Dutch labour inspectorate, sometimes exploited. Highly skilled “expats”
  add to housing pressure in places such as Eindhoven and Amsterdam, the UN
  special rapporteur noted, but Dutch businesses say the country cannot maintain
  a global tech industry without foreign talent. At a recent Niet te Koop (“not
  for sale”) demonstration outside yet another social home earmarked for sale,
  Jan Leegwater picked up a loudspeaker. “They will ask €600,000 for this
  because of the potential to extend,” he said. “And if you sell this in a few
  years, you can net more than if you just work normally … We are suckers, and
  we are stuck in this system.” Much of the national fury is misdirected towards
  asylum seekers and other expatriates. The architects of this crisis are not
  immigrants – they are the wealthy Dutch homeowners and voters who, year after
  year, have protected a system that serves their own interests. Unless that
  mindset shifts, their children’s anger will only grow – and we can expect more
  krakers to start taking the law into their own hands. Senay Boztas is a
