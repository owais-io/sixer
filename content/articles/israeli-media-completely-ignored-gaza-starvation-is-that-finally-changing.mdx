  Images of Palestinian children in Gaza, emaciated by hunger under the blockade
  imposed by Israel, and of families grieving the more than 61,000 people killed
  in the territory have stirred outrage among foreign governments and much of
  the global public. Inside Israel, however, the reaction has been markedly
  different. In a poll conducted in late July by the Israel Democracy Institute
  (IDI), more than three-quarters of Jewish Israelis – 79% – said they were
  either “not very troubled” or “not troubled at all” by reports of famine and
  suffering among Gaza’s Palestinian population. According to Anat Saragusti, an
  expert on the media, the reason is simple: most people in Israel are unaware
  of those reports because for months they have never seen them. “Until a couple
  of weeks ago, you could count only a handful of reports from Gaza not filtered
  by the IDF,” said Saragusti, the head of freedom of the press at the Union of
  Journalists in Israel. Except for a few newspapers such as the leftwing
  Haaretz, she said, “all the other mainstream media completely ignored what’s
  going on on the Palestinian side – the human casualties there, the numbers of
  children killed in this war. The Israeli audience simply did not see that at
  all.” In the past few weeks, the growing focus on the issue in the
  international media has led to some Israeli newspapers and TV channels
  reporting on hunger in Gaza for the first time, albeit as a debatable issue.
  Since the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October 2023, public debate in Israel has
  largely centred on national security, the plight of the Israeli hostages
  captured by Hamas, and the country’s military goals in Gaza. In that climate,
  the humanitarian disaster caused by the Israeli assault on Gaza has tended to
  occupy a marginal place in the minds of many Jewish Israelis, who largely view
  the conflict as a legitimate act of self-defence in response to Hamas’s
  attacks – although polls also show a clear majority want a deal with Hamas to
  end the war in exchange for the freedom of the remaining Israeli hostages.
  Media analysts say Israel’s main broadcasters have largely embraced the
  narrative of a government described as the most far-right in the country’s
  history. For months, the Israeli media have responded to international outrage
  by focusing on Israeli claims that the widespread hunger documented by
  numerous aid agencies is “a Hamas-orchestrated starvation campaign” – summed
  up by Benjamin Netanyahu’s claim last month: “There is no policy of starvation
  in Gaza, and there is no starvation in Gaza.” According to UN World Food
  Programme, one-third of the Palestinian population in Gaza is going for days
  without eating, and half a million are on the brink of starvation. “The
  worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip,” the
  UN-backed group the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said
  last month, calling for an urgent ceasefire to alleviate “widespread
  starvation”. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
  Affairs (OCHA), another five people died last week due to malnutrition and
  starvation, bringing the total number of malnutrition-related deaths to 227,
  including 103 children, since October 2023. Even Donald Trump, Netanyahu’s key
  international ally, when asked if he agreed with the Israeli PM on the issue,
  said: “I don’t know … those children look very hungry … that’s real starvation
  stuff.” In a rare press conference with foreign journalists in Jerusalem last
  Sunday, Netanyahu displayed photographs of skeletal children in Gaza and
  dismissed them as fake, claiming they were part of a Hamas plot to attack
  Israel. He compared these images with a photograph of the Israeli hostage
  Evyatar David released by the Palestinian militant group early in August,
  pointing out that while the man held in Gaza appeared to be starving to death,
  the arm of a Hamas fighter visible in the frame looked strong and muscular.
  The implication was clear, according to the prime minister: the fighters of
  Hamas were eating well and keeping food from the Israeli hostages and from the
  public of Gaza. Saragusti said: “Despite images of emaciated children
  published by major newspapers around the world, Israel pushed back. And
  Israeli media outlets adopted the narrative set out by the Israeli leadership,
  insisting that there is no starvation in Gaza.” Although Israel appears to
  exist within its own bubble, shielded by a narrative that leaves no room for
  the suffering of people in Gaza, thousands of demonstrators who recently
  filled the streets of Tel Aviv are now urging the government to halt the
  atrocities against the Palestinians. “I think it is horrendous what is
  happening in Gaza,” said Lenny Kadmon, 19. “I think that the main reason not
  everyone here is against it is because most people find it too difficult or
  too scary to look at themselves and at what we do in Gaza.” Gal Alkalay, 28,
  said: “I come here to protest in Tel Aviv every weekend. We ask our PM to end
  the war. Only in this way we can end the starvation in Gaza and the return of
  our hostages.” And yet, despite a growing number of Israeli intellectuals
  using the word “genocide” to describe their government’s actions in Gaza – as
  the award-winning author David Grossman did just a fortnight ago – analysts
  say they remain a small minority. In Jerusalem, where tensions between Arabs
  and Israelis are sharper, the majority of Jewish residents continue to align
  themselves with the narrative of Israel’s political leadership. Asked what she
  thought of the suffering of Palestinian children in Gaza, Myriam Israel, 34,
  said: “I think people should also see the suffering of our children terrorised
  by Hamas. But the world thinks only about children of Gaza. I think Hamas
  needs to think about their own children. And we need to think about the
  security of our country.” Zalman Coleman, 21, said: “All you have to do is use
  your brain five seconds and you can see that Hamas’s ultimate aim is to get
  that number [of deaths] as high as possible. And then from that, turn the
  whole world’s face against Israel. [In this conflict] the media had so much
  potential to do so much good in the world. But they chose fake news.” Since
  the Hamas-led attacks of 2023, Israel has almost completely barred foreign
  journalists from entering Gaza – an unprecedented move in the history of
  modern conflict, marking one of the rare moments that reporters have been
  denied access to an active war zone. Reporters Without Borders and the
  Committee to Protect Journalists have formally called for Gaza to be opened to
  foreign media, warning that current measures severely undermine press freedom.
  Many argue that the Israeli ban is a deliberate tactic to restrict independent
  scrutiny, limit international visibility of the conflict, and thus control the
  narrative. “The only way to enter Gaza and cover the war is to embed in
  Israeli army units,” said Saragusti – and even that is rarely allowed. “There
  is no independent press in Gaza. There are only the Palestinian journalists,
  who many of them have been killed. Israel claims that there is no starvation
  but doesn’t let the foreign press in to check by itself whether there is
  starvation or not.” Up to now, she added, “the press blockade has succeeded
  very well in its goal”.
