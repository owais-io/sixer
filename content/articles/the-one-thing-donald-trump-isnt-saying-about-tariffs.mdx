  Donald Trump’s words and actions rarely align perfectly. If you watch
  carefully, what he doesn’t say can be just as telling as what he does.
  “Starting on day one, we will end inflation and make America affordable again,
  to bring down the prices of all goods,” he told the nation ahead of his
  re-election. The US president declared that 2 April would “forever be
  remembered as the day American industry was reborn”, only to pause tariffs a
  week later. He promised peace in Ukraine on day one of his presidency, only to
  later clarify this was “said in jest”; and he has claimed very few people can
  beat him at golf, only for footage from Scotland to raise questions over just
  how honest that round might be. As a real estate mogul, reality TV star and
  political campaigner, Trump learned to bend narrative to his will, even if it
  meant straying from reality. As president, this often leaves a gap between
  what he says and what he does. In many cases, the administration’s actions are
  more important to follow than the firehose of words. If you were, say, a US
  business buying coffee from Brazil, you might have rushed to import it last
  week after Trump insisted 1 August was the cast-iron deadline for new tariffs.
  “It stands strong, and will not be extended,” he wrote on Wednesday – hours
  before signing an executive order that said new steep tariffs on the country
  would come into force on 8 August, after all. And if you’re a US consumer, you
  might reasonably ask how inflation can be “dead”, as the White House has
  claimed, if you’re still shelling out more on groceries each month. The
  president has an awful lot to say about tariffs. They will, he argues, raise
  “trillions” of dollars for the US federal government; eliminate trade deficits
  with other countries; and even punish Brazil for putting his ally the former
  president Jair Bolsonaro on trial for allegedly seeking to seize power after
  losing the 2022 presidential election. The list goes on. But what about what
  the president doesn’t say? Trump was re-elected last November after repeatedly
  pledging to rapidly bring down prices for Americans. This assurance formed a
  central pillar of his election campaign – a regular refrain in rallies,
  interviews and debates – as millions found it harder to make ends meet after
  years of inflation. Every policy comes at a cost. Every tax must be paid by
  someone, somewhere. For consumers, the Budget Lab at Yale estimates the
  short-term price impact of Trump’s tariff changes is equivalent to an average
  per household income loss of $2,400. What Trump doesn’t really talk about is
  the impact of his aggressive tariff agenda on US is prices. One of the few
  times he has acknowledged it might actually exacerbate inflation led to a
  bizarre tangent about dolls back in May. Acknowledging that tariffs might
  cause price rises, Trump suggested American children might have to settle for
  having “two dolls instead of 30 dolls”. Back then, Joe Biden was still to
  blame for any signs of strife in the economy, according to Trump. Now he
  argues almost daily that the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, is
  responsible. The biggest indication yet that the US economy is creaking on
  Trump’s watch came on Friday, when official data revealed that the labor
  market had stalled this summer. He unceremoniously fired the veteran official
  in charge of the statistics – and alleged, without evidence, that the numbers
  had been rigged. With higher US tariffs now in place on a string of countries,
  the president and his administration will inevitably say a lot about the
  benefits of his economic strategy. They are already trying to stifle evidence
  of drawbacks. They might even raise the prospect of a handout – pitched as a
  sign of this policy’s success, rather than a concession that many Americans
  are still hard up. But if you’re running a small business reliant on trade, or
  walking into the grocery store on a budget, reality supersedes rhetoric. Words
  don’t pay the bills.
