  ‘Running riot through graves’: King Charles urged to protect Goodwin Sands
  from dredging

  Over centuries the treacherous Goodwin Sands off Kent – known as the great
  “ship swallower” – has entombed more than 2,000 shipwrecks, dozens of second
  world war aircraft and is the final resting place of thousands. Shakespeare
  described it as “a very dangerous flat, and fatal”. In 1703, five vessels were
  sucked into its shifting sands during a storm, including the English warship
  HMS Northumberland, which only now is yielding its well-preserved secrets.
  Campaigners fear this unique area is now at risk from destructive dredging for
  building sand and aggregate. They are appealing to the crown estate, which
  owns the seabed, and calling on King Charles for support, to protect an area
  rich in maritime and cultural heritage. Writing to Charles, as a “committed
  conservationist, head of the armed forces and as a beneficiary of the crown
  estate’s commercial activities”, the Goodwin Sands Conservation Trust has
  asked him to encourage the crown estate to remove the sands from its list of
  potential marine aggregate extraction sites. The king’s public duties are paid
  by the sovereign grant, calculated on a percentage of crown estate profits.
  “Does he know where this money is coming from? It’s coming from licences to
  develop the seabed without proper protections for what they are going to
  find,” said Joanna Thomson, the trust’s chair. A response from a palace aide
  referred it to the crown estate. “We made clear in our letter it was because
  we had got nowhere with the crown estate that we were contacting the king, so
  the reply was rather frustrating,” said Thomson. The Goodwin Sands seabed is
  littered with history. As well as shipwrecks, second world war allied and axis
  planes crashed in the area long seen as a profitable source of marine
  aggregate, the trust said. A licence to extract 2.5m tonnes was approved in
  2018 for a Dover Harbour Board development, although it was eventually sourced
  from elsewhere. Marine aggregate extraction licences are granted by the Marine
  Management Organisation (MMO), but it is the crown estate that decides what
  development occurs on the seabed, said campaigners. They are “disappointed” at
  its “flat refusal” to guarantee no dredging of the 10-mile sandbank, which has
  had marine protected area (MPA) status since 2019, and acts as a sea defence
  to the unstable coastline. Historian and TV presenter Dan Snow, who has dived
  on the Goodwins, said: “There are some extraordinary wrecks down there. We are
  obviously all very worried and sad to think it could be just mined and a lot
  of that would be destroyed.” Snow described it has a “magical subsea
  landscape”. “Every period of our history over the last 2,000 years has left a
  rich legacy there, which is unusual, probably unique,” he added. The crown
  estate said in a statement: “There are currently no plans for aggregate
  licences in the Goodwin Sands area. However, we are unable to provide blanket,
  permanent exemptions for any part of the seabed from this or other sectors,
  unless predicated by an organisation with regulatory or other relevant
  responsibility, or by a national designation such as a highly protected marine
  area (HPMA).” While the MMO grants marine licences for dredging, the crown
  estate, as landowner, must license or lease the seabed and can decline to do
  so and not leave the matter solely to MMO marine licensing, according to
  Michael Williams, visiting professor of law at Plymouth University and an
  expert on law relating to foreshore, seabed and underwater cultural heritage.
  “The crown estate can’t treat it as though the Goodwins have a blanket
  designation, but what they can do is have a policy. You can say this is a
  highly sensitive archeological area and therefore we will tend not to grant
  applications unless there’s exceptional circumstances. And that’s what public
  bodies do for culturally sensitive areas all the time.” He added: “The high
  archaeological potential of the Goodwin Sands is, or should be, a material
  consideration for the crown estate, even though there is no specific
  designation of the area in general.” Under the UK marine policy statement’s
  national policy, just because something is not specifically designated does
  not mean it is not of importance and the crown estate should take note of that
  policy, he said. The MMO is currently consulting on banning bottom trawling in
  certain areas, including the Goodwin marine conservation area, yet aggregate
  extraction is far more destructive, said Thomson. Another potential threat
  looms. National Grid wants to build an electricity converter station on
  Minster Marshes near the coast at Sandwich, with a cable running across
  Sandwich Bay, the site of many shipwrecks and just a few miles away from the
  Goodwins, “They need half a million tonnes of sand and there are fears they
  will wish to take it from the Goodwins,” said Thomson. Wessex Archaeology has
  identified the Goodwin Sands as holding probably the highest density of
  maritime heritage in UK waters, said Thomson. “If a dredger went through the
  remains, they would be completely destroyed. Aircraft could have crew in them,
  so disturbing final resting places. It’s so hypocritical. Every year we have
  Remembrance Day at beautiful cemeteries on land, yet there’s the crown estate
  potentially allowing dredgers to run riot through graves, where people are
  buried and have drowned. It’s a psychological loss to the nation, and an
  emotional loss. We wouldn’t allow that to happen on land,” said Thomson.
