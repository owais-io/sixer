  Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence startup xAI is suing OpenAI and Apple over
  allegations that they are engaging in anticompetitive conduct. The lawsuit,
  filed in a Texas court on Monday, accuses the companies of “a conspiracy to
  monopolize the markets for smartphones and generative AI chatbots”. Musk had
  earlier this month threatened to sue Apple and OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT,
  after claiming that Apple was “making it impossible” for any other AI
  companies to reach the top spot on its app store. Musk’s xAI makes the Grok
  chatbot, which has struggled to become as prominent as ChatGPT. Musk’s lawsuit
  challenges a key partnership between Apple and OpenAI that was announced last
  year, in which the device maker integrated OpenAI’s artificial intelligence
  capabilities into its operating systems. In claiming that their agreement
  “locked up markets”, Musk’s case is seeking to undo one of Apple’s most
  significant forays into AI and a marquee deal for OpenAI. “Defendants entered
  an unlawful agreement and conspiracy to leverage Apple’s monopoly power in the
  US smartphone market to maintain OpenAI’s monopoly power in generative AI
  chatbots,” the complaint states. It is also seeking to “recover billions in
  damages”. OpenAI rejected Musk’s allegations and framed the suit as part of
  his broader attacks against the company. “This latest filing is consistent
  with Mr Musk’s ongoing pattern of harassment,” an OpenAI spokesperson said.
  Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The lawsuit is the
  latest front in the ongoing feud between Musk and Altman. The two tech
  billionaires founded OpenAI together in 2015, but have since had an
  increasingly public falling out which has frequently turned litigious. Musk
  left OpenAI after proposing to take over the company in 2018, and has since
  filed multiple lawsuits against the company over its plans to shift into a
  for-profit enterprise. Altman and OpenAI have rejected Musk’s criticisms and
  framed him as a petty, vindictive former partner. “We’re sad that it’s come to
  this with someone whom we’ve deeply admired – someone who inspired us to aim
  higher, then told us we would fail, started a competitor, and then sued us
  when we started making meaningful progress towards OpenAI’s mission without
  him,” OpenAI posted in a statement last year, following one of Musk’s
  lawsuits. The spat between Altman and Musk resurged earlier this month after
  the latter’s threat to sue Apple. Musk’s claims that Apple was manipulating
  the app store’s rankings to exclude other AI companies resulted in an exchange
  of posts between the two tech moguls challenging and insulting each other.
  “This is a remarkable claim given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to
  manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors
  and people he doesn’t like,” Altman posted in response to Musk’s claims that
  Apple was favoring OpenAI. OpenAI is currently eyeing a $500bn valuation,
  which would make it the most valuable privately held company, exceeding Musk’s
  SpaceX rocket maker which is the current title holder, at $350bn.
