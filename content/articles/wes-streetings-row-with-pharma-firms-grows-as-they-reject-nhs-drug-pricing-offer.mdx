  A row between Wes Streeting and pharmaceutical companies has intensified after
  drugmakers rejected the health secretary’s latest offer on NHS drug pricing.
  The two sides failed to reach agreement by a midday deadline on Friday,
  meaning the mechanism under which the health service claws back some of the
  money it pays for medicines will continue at a rate the industry said was
  “unsustainable” and could ultimately disadvantage patients. At the heart of
  the dispute is the voluntary scheme for branded medicines pricing, access and
  growth (VPAG), under which pharma companies agree the amount of revenues from
  drug sales to the NHS they have to pay back. The two sides have been in
  acrimonious negotiations for months after the government raised the rate last
  December unexpectedly to almost 23% for 2025 for newer medicines. It is
  understood that Streeting had made an ultimatum that if the industry did not
  accept his latest “generous” offer on pricing then the arrangement would
  continue unamended and on Friday that scenario came to pass. According to the
  Financial Times, which first reported the health secretary’s letter to the
  APBI, his proposed offer included lower rebate rates in all future years of
  the scheme and an increase in the the price of new medicines and net spending
  on them. The industry body, the Association of the British Pharmaceutical
  Industry (ABPI), said the stalemate could mean companies launch fewer
  medicines in the UK, which could ultimately disadvantage patients. A
  government spokesperson said the clawback scheme “helps improve access to
  cutting-edge treatments for NHS patients while keeping the medicines bill
  sustainable for taxpayers”. They said it was “regrettable” that the ABPI did
  not want to take the government’s proposals to a board vote, adding: “We have
  therefore determined that the interests of patients and the NHS are best
  served by concluding the review and continuing with the existing VPAG scheme
  unamended, while continuing to support the UK’s world-leading life sciences
  sector.” The ABPI, which includes large drugs companies such as AstraZeneca,
  Pfizer and Roche, hit back, demanding “urgent action” from the government to
  address the issues affecting the sector. It added that VPAG – which means drug
  companies are forced to pay between a quarter and a third of UK drug sales
  back to the NHS – was “undermining UK patient access to innovative medicines
  and the competitiveness of the UK life sciences industry”. Labour has
  identified life sciences as a key growth sector for the economy. Richard
  Torbett, the chief executive of the ABPI, said: “We need to reach a solution
  that improves patient access to future innovation, allows the sector to fulfil
  its growth potential, and does not require industry to pay back nearly three
  times as much of its revenues as is required in other European countries.” He
  added: “Without change, the UK will continue to fall down international league
  tables for research, investment, and patient access to medicines.” The UK
  government’s latest offer had included lower rebate rates in all future years
  of the scheme, an average double-digit percentage increase in the price of new
  medicines to support wider patient access to a range of drugs, and a
  commitment to accelerating net spending on new medicines, with specific
  10-year targets, according to people briefed on the contents. Pharma companies
  have previously said the current 22.9% rebate, which marks a significant
  increase on the payment of about 5% of revenue paid in 2021 under a previous
  agreement, made “future UK investment … unlikely”. Pascal Soriot, the chief
  executive of AstraZeneca, said earlier this year that the new rate had
  discouraged investment in Britain, but claimed it did not have anything to do
  with the company’s decision in January to pull the plug on a £450m investment
  in its vaccines plant at Speke in Merseyside. The French pharma company Sanofi
  said the government’s proposal was “not good enough” and called on ministers
  to do more to “invest in innovation”. Johan Kahlström, the managing director
  of the drugmaker Novartis in UK and Ireland, said the lack of agreement
  between the sector and government was “a serious setback for UK patients, the
  NHS, and the life sciences sector”. The NHS row comes as Donald Trump’s White
  House puts pressure on the industry internationally, threatening a crackdown
  on pharma firms unless they lower drug prices for Americans. In addition, the
  US president has vowed repeatedly to ramp up tariffs on imported drugs to
  sky-high levels, in an attempt to get companies to relocate production to the
  US. Earlier in the week, Eli Lilly, the US manufacturer of the weight-loss jab
  Mounjaro, said it was increasing the UK price by up to 170%, taking a month’s
  supply of the highest dose from £122 to £330.
