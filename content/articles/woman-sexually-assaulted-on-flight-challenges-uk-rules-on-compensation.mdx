  A woman who was sexually assaulted while sleeping on a flight to London is
  challenging UK government rules that disqualify her from a compensation scheme
  because the plane was not registered in Britain. She was attacked on a Qatar
  Airways flight from Doha, Qatar, to Gatwick in September last year. Momade
  Jussab, 66, of Feltham, was sitting next to her and put his hands down her
  trousers. He was arrested on arrival at Gatwick. In May, he was handed a
  six-and-a-half-year prison sentence at Lewes crown court after being found
  guilty of one count of sexual assault by penetration and two counts of sexual
  assault. His victim, who has maintained her anonymity and is referred to as
  Kelly, has been denied a payout through the criminal injuries compensation
  scheme because the incident happened on a plane that was not registered in
  Britain. The law firm Leigh Day, which is representing Kelly, has written to
  the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, urging her to close what it believes
  is a gap in the law. Kelly, who is in her 20s and from London, said: “I do not
  understand why I, and other victims like me, have been excluded from the CIC
  scheme. “I was attacked on a flight en route to the UK, I am a UK citizen, and
  this crime was investigated and prosecuted by British authorities. “I should
  be entitled to compensation, and being excluded from the scheme is unfair and
  illogical. I am still suffering with the effects of the attack and want to
  move forward with my life.” The Civil Aviation Act was updated in 1996 to
  ensure criminal acts on foreign planes bound for the UK can be prosecuted in
  UK criminal courts. Claire Powell, a solicitor at Leigh Day, said: “Our client
  suffered an horrific sexual attack on a UK-bound flight. She was refused
  compensation under the criminal injuries compensation scheme simply because it
  was a foreign flight and the rules have not been amended in line with the
  updates to the Civil Aviation Act. “It is a gap that needs closing urgently
  and we trust the justice secretary will agree, particularly in light of this
  government’s commitment to addressing violence against women and girls.” A
  Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “Our thoughts remain with this victim,
  and we remain resolute in our mission to halve violence against women and
  girls in a decade. The rules that the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority
  follows, and the values of payments for injuries, are set by parliament.
  “Other routes are available for victims to receive support.”
