  Shortly after Israel announced its attack on Iran in June, Trevor Andrei sent
  a message to some of his fellow Australian preppers telling them to stock up
  on petrol and buy a few hundred dollars’ worth of groceries. “I was like, OK,
  this is super significant, there’s going to be a response … shit’s going to go
  down,” Andrei says. “Most years, [Australia is] lucky if we’ve got 28 days [of
  petrol reserve] so … if anything hits the world’s oil supply, we can be out of
  petrol in a month.” Andrei describes himself as Australia’s most famous
  prepper and is one of the few happy to speak publicly about a famously
  secretive subculture. The survivalist runs bushcraft courses (two hours for
  $299), makes and sells soap with his daughter, makes his own jerky, and has a
  property with fruit trees and a dam full of rainbow trout. He has great
  relationships with his farmer neighbours, he says – he’ll process lambs
  mutilated by foxes so that the meat can be shared around the community for pet
  food, and when a tree comes down on one of their properties, Andrei will chop
  it up in exchange for some of the haul. He has formerly worked as a landscaper
  specialising in edible gardens and a tour guide in the outback. In short, when
  shit hits the fan (SHTF, in prepper parlance), Andrei is going to be all
  right. He’s not so sure about the rest of us. “Shit hits the fan every day,”
  he says. “It just matters how close you are to the fan and whether or not it
  splattered on you, right? But the real shit hits the fan is what we call a
  fire sale, right? And that’s where it’s literally everything that could go
  wrong has gone wrong … So the pointy end of the scale is, you imagine like a
  cyberwar: there’s no gas, there’s no water, there’s no electricity, you can’t
  flush your toilet, there’s no radio. “Every single day of your life you have
  expected to … put some food on a plate and stick it in your mouth. So why
  would you not prepare for that ahead of time? There are so many people who
  don’t do it.” And yet increasingly, it seems, there are more and more people
  across Australia who do. Global instability and the abrupt arrival of AI are
  among the factors that have pushed prepping towards the mainstream. But the
  biggest driver was the pandemic, when people experienced empty supermarket
  shelves and the pain of disrupted global supply chains – some for the first
  time in their lives. For preppers such as Andrei, who see how most urban
  Australians live, this move towards preparedness cannot come soon enough.
  “Prepping is becoming super super super popular. I’ve got schools that want me
  to teach it,” he says. “You’d be mad, anybody would be mad if they’re not
  sitting there going, all right, what’s going on? And what should we do?” ‘In
  cities there’s so many fragile people’ Sam and Candice Johnson are not
  preppers, but they deal with preppers almost daily. “We’re just
  country-prepared, as we say,” Candice says. “We’ve always got that little bit
  of extra in case you get flooded in or you have to leave home quickly in case
  of fires, but other than that I wouldn’t consider ourselves preppers.” The
  couple run a camping store in Beaudesert, Queensland, an hour west of the Gold
  Coast. A little over a decade ago, they saw a gap in the market and began
  stocking emergency kits – containing items such as wind-up radios, torches,
  batteries and glowsticks – to have on hand in the event of natural disasters.

  customers began asking if they could stock more serious survival supplies. Now
  the store supplies most of the country with everything from freeze-dried foods
  to mylar bags, fire-starting kits, camouflage netting, snares and traps. “The
  majority of our customers are those who want to be long-term prepared, so
  they’re the people who’ve got, you know, a couple of months’ worth of food
  stored away, or they’ve got emergency water filters,” Candice says. “When we
  started … [prepping] was a really underground, quiet kind of thing. But that’s
  increased 10-fold, twentyfold, thirtyfold.” Covid was a big factor, she says.
  “People who didn’t understand what the whole thing was about previously, now
  had some kind of context as to why other people were doing it.” That removed
  some of the stigma as well. “People are seeming less quiet about it. Before
  we’d get lots of customers who wouldn’t give us their name and they’d only pay
  cash and all this sort of stuff, but now, people are much more open and
  accepting of it and willing to admit that it’s something that they do.”
  Bradley Garrett, a geographer who has researched preppers around the world,
  interviewing more than a hundred of them for his book, Bunker, says there is a
  distinct difference between Australian preppers and those in the US, that
  seems to stem from a different level of trust in the government. “My
  experience talking to preppers in Australia is they’re much more concerned
  with practical prepping, as we call it – prepping for a wildfire or a blackout
  for three days or a week, or the taps turning off, or whatever. It seems to me
  like there is an expectation that help is going to arrive at some point …
  whereas with American preppers, they’re much more concerned that help is not
  going to arrive and you’re on your own. And that’s certainly become
  exacerbated under the second Trump administration.” Garrett says there is a
  lot more openness towards prepping in Australia than in the US, largely
  because of a culture “of loading up your overland vehicle and going out to
  campsites and staying out for multiple days”. But there is also a huge split
  between the preparedness and resilience of people in cities and those in rural
  areas. “In cities, God, there’s so many fragile people that are totally
  dependent upon the next paycheque and systems being in working order … There
  are a lot of people who really would not fare well in a dire emergency.”
  Garrett says when he started researching prepper culture he was one of these
  typical, fragile, middle-class Sydneysiders. “When I had my position at the
  University of Sydney and I had a steady paycheque and we went to the gym and
  we did all the things that you do as a middle-class Sydney person, it was
  fine, there was nothing wrong with it, but the more I talked to these people,
  the more I realised, if something went wrong with this, I couldn’t deal with
  it. Like we had no reserves, we had no resiliency.” Garrett eventually adopted
  some prepper practices: he came up with a plan for what to do if he turned the
  taps on one day and no water came out. He had a Jeep packed with camping gear
  and a “mental map” of his surroundings and a plan for where he could go if his
  city home became unsafe (drive his Jeep south into the national park) as well
  as a backup plan – a few kayaks tied up on a nearby beach, so he and his wife
  could “take to the water” and get out of the city that way. “I started
  thinking more about how much money do we have in the bank, and what resources
  do we have if suddenly the grocery stores weren’t open, you know? “People
  don’t necessarily need to move, but creating a little elasticity in your
  existence so you can deal with crisis is a very healthy thing.” ‘Bug in’ or
  ‘bug out’? On one of Australia’s most popular prepper Facebook pages the
  discussion bounces from the mundane (“Does anyone have any recommendations for
  good quality but affordable Mylar bags and oxygen absorbers?”) to the
  portentous: “When China spits the dummy with Australia, the sea lanes will be
  cut and our imported food will stop. Stock up on all you can.” In between
  posts offering advice on the best storage of rice (white apparently stores
  much better than brown – “the lesser of two weevils,” a commenter quips) – and
  the discussion about the battery life of the Nokia 3210, there are questions
  about the best mode of transport. “When the lights go out … do I need to
  purchase horses? Camels?” Others present detailed plans of how people would or
  should survive should the worst happen. One user posts an ominous checklist of
  what to do on “day one … immediately after the collapse”. The list runs:
  secure your perimeter, fill bathtubs and bowls with water while it’s still
  running, radio check your crew and decide whether to “bug in or bug out”, but
  make that decision early, as “traffic jams and gunfire don’t mix”. Whether to
  “bug in” or “bug out” is a key question for hardcore preppers. Bugging in
  means people plan to stay put in their home, which should be well stocked with
  supplies, well hidden and whose existence should not be disclosed to anyone,
  lest marauders come. Bugging out means leaving, with either a “bug out bag” –
  a short-term emergency kit – or an Inch (I’m never coming home) bag with
  supplies to enable indefinite survival. Andrei plans to bug in, but thinks
  building a bespoke bunker full of supplies is quite stupid. That would make
  them a “soft, high-yield target” for “wolves” – his term for marauders who
  would seek out a bunker, smoke out the occupants and steal their supplies.
  Holly Robertson, who identifies as a “bush survivalist” rather than a prepper,
  agrees. “So, I don’t identify with prepper culture, but I do see myself as
  someone who’s prepared. When people know that you have a stockpile, that’s
  where they’re going to go first. But if you’re someone who can literally take
  a knife or a machete and go into the bush and make your own fire friction kit
  and make your cordage and make your traps, that’s powerful. Like, that’s a
  skill set that people really value. They’re not going to try and steal from
  you, they want to have you in their space. So for me, leading with skill set
  and knowledge is far more powerful than having a stockpile of things.”
  Robertson stands out from many in the bush survivalist community for a few
  reasons: she is 25, female and has an Instagram account with nearly 55,000
  followers. She became interested in this world a few years ago when she was
  holidaying near Byron Bay. She went to a bush survival school run by a man
  known as Cockatoo Paul, who would eventually become both her life and business
  partner. Paul died a year ago, and Robertson now runs the Australian Bush
  Survival School as a mobile business, travelling all over Australia to run
  everything from children’s workshops to corporate retreats, teaching skills
  such as trapping, tracking, spear throwing, knot-tying, skin tanning, friction
  fires, water purification and basic navigation. “At the end of the day, the
  majority of the skills I teach people, they’re probably never going to use
  again in their life. I hope they’re never in a survival situation. But what I
  do see is a sense of empowerment and confidence through capability. When
  someone, for the first time in their life, creates a fire out of two sticks,
  the way their face lights up is phenomenal. “A lot of people … in my
  generation … they don’t know how to light a fire. And if the power went out,
  they would have literally no idea what to do whatsoever. A lot of our
  grandparents, they’ve lived in the bush and they’re super capable … so what I
  really want to see for my generation is how we can really step up and become
  more self-reliant.” ‘It’s not fine to obsess’ While many interviewees stress
  the importance of resilience, capability and community, some also warn there
  can be a dangerous element to prepper culture. “Unfortunately some very
  vulnerable people fall into that demographic and they find a lot of serious
  consequences down the line,” says John Scarinci, the secretary general of the
  Australian Peoples Survival League (formerly the Australian Preppers Survival
  League). Scarinci says for some people, prepping can become a “life-overtaking
  exercise”. “They find themselves in trouble later in life because they’ve just
  spent their life savings [and] years roll on, decades … and they’ve amassed a
  huge amount of preparatory items and they’ve forgotten about their own health
  and wellbeing, and the world has not collapsed and they find themselves in a
  spot of bother.” Some find they have spent decades preparing for the end of
  the world, but not for retirement or aged care. For others, prepping comes at
  huge cost to relationships. “Their partners may potentially leave them because
  they’re so fixated with their preparations, where they’re preparing for the
  doomsday occurrence and it just engulfs them. They’re unable to work, because
  how are you going to fit in … a career whilst being fixated on preparing your
  jars of food and your freeze-dried items?” Garrett says he has also seen
  people who started prepping on a “low level”, dedicating more and more of
  their resources and mental energy to it. “Eventually families start to get
  frustrated [and ask] ‘What are we doing here? We’re spending more time anxious
  about the future than we are worrying about the present, or enjoying the
  present.’ “It happens a lot, because prepping is a thought experiment, so once
  you start to think, ‘How do we escape from a bushfire?’ then you start
  thinking, well, what if there was a nuclear attack? What if all the cyber
  systems are down and we have to flee? What if AI turns on us? It can become a
  bridge to conspiracy theory and the guardrails you have to put in place are
  just understand that, yeah, it’s fine to think about these things, but it’s
  not fine to obsess over them.” But Garrett says becoming more prepared has
  made him far more peaceful, rather than anxious. He eventually moved away from
  his middle-class Sydney life, returning to his native US, where he lives on a
  five-acre property in rural California. He and his wife grow their own food,
  have horses and are gradually taking the property off-grid. “Things can
  definitely go wrong in our lives and I’m totally capable of dealing with them
  … It’s given me a sense of solace that not only do we have the resources we
  need to get through something, but I’ve spent years now upskilling in various
  things … I just learned how to lay pipes in the yard … or I learned how to put
  in an electrical socket or fix our breaker if it goes out. All those sort of
  DIY practical skills. Every time I learn something, then I think, ‘Oh this is
  fantastic’ because if something goes wrong, I don’t have to call someone to
  deal with this – I can deal with it.”
