  unravelled

  A disparate collection of steelworks in Australia, the UK, Romania and the
  Czech Republic at the start of the year had two things in common: they were
  part of the metals empire of Sanjeev Gupta, and they had fallen silent. The
  idling plants were emblematic of the tycoon’s struggles. Born in India before
  starting a commodities trading business at university, Gupta was once
  nicknamed the “saviour of steel” for his plans to turn around struggling
  plants. Yet things looked very different this week, as he finally lost control
  of one of his key UK businesses. London’s high court ruled on Thursday that
  Speciality Steel UK (SSUK), a key operating subsidiary, should enter
  compulsory liquidation as it was “hopelessly insolvent”, with debts of several
  hundred million pounds but only £650,000 in its account. As soon as the
  hearing ended, government-appointed special managers present at the court met
  executives to discuss taking control of steel plants in South Yorkshire and
  ensuring 1,450 people are paid salaries. Gupta did not witness the SSUK
  liquidation in person; instead he remained in Sydney, according to his
  company. However, Jeffrey Kabel, the Liberty Steel executive at court,
  insisted that Gupta was “sad”, but also that he was not done yet. Gupta will
  try to buy back SSUK – which has operations in Rotherham and Stocksbridge in
  South Yorkshire – from insolvency, Kabel said, claiming that Liberty had the
  backing of the investment manager BlackRock. Meanwhile, the rest of Gupta’s
  operations – steel and aluminium works in Scotland, Wales, England, and
  Australia – under the informal Gupta Family Group (GFG) Alliance banner, will
  be “exactly the same”, Kabel said. “We will continue to operate those and
  invest in them.” Yet the court proceedings and workers around the world
  present a picture of an industrialist running out of time and money, with
  creditors and worried governments closing in, and production slumping or
  stopping completely. An investigation by the UK’s Serious Fraud Office is
  ongoing. Saviour of steel? Gupta started trading commodities from his student
  room at the University of Cambridge in the early 1990s, earning him expulsion
  from the halls because of a ban on running a business there. He then began
  snapping up struggling steel and aluminium plants on the cheap across Europe
  and Australia – controlled via Singapore – and making them part of Liberty
  Steel. He also enjoyed the trappings of wealth that came with it: he bought a
  £42m house in London’s Belgravia, a Welsh country estate called Wyelands, a
  Scottish estate that includes the foothills of Ben Nevis, a waterfront
  property in Sydney, a 31-metre yacht, and a private jet adorned with the GFG
  logo and the tail sign M-ETAL. He lists his country of residence as the United
  Arab Emirates, where he owns another villa. Yet since the collapse in 2021 of
  Greensill Capital, his key lender, Gupta’s businesses have been scrambling to
  find new financing and to renegotiate debts in a desperate effort to retain
  control. Promised investments in new green technologies have not materialised,
  and much-vaunted turnaround plans have stuttered. The global steel industry
  has suffered from a glut of Chinese production, and slumping demand, while
  Donald Trump’s tariff war has created uncertainty. Gupta had already lost
  control of several companies. One of the first things government-appointed
  administrators noticed in February after taking control of his steel plant in
  the Australian port city of Whyalla was that the traffic lights for vehicles
  entering the site were not working, potentially compromising safety. There was
  also just three days’ worth of the crucial steelmaking material, coking coal,
  and a long list of required repairs and maintenance. The lead administrator,
  Sebastian Hams, at KordaMentha, described the dire levels of working capital
  at the steelmaker, formerly owned by the GFG Alliance entity OneSteel
  Manufacturing, as “quite scary”. The steelworks was put into administration
  after the South Australian government, which was also a creditor, lost
  confidence in Gupta’s ability to deliver on promises to reinvigorate what is
  one of only two big integrated steel projects in Australia, and the only local
  manufacturer of rail. When administrators moved in, the steelworks was found
  to have racked up more than $A1.3bn (£630m) in debts, including unpaid
  employee entitlements. GFG says there was no mismanagement involved, and that
  it invested heavily. Rather, it argues that steel making globally is suffering
  amid a difficult trading environment. The state and federal governments are
  providing a $A2.4bn support package to ensure the steelworks keep operating
  during administration and that workers are paid. There is also financial
  support for the next owner to upgrade the facility. Similar stories are
  playing out elsewhere. In the Czech Republic, GFG Alliance reportedly sold
  Liberty Ostrava for about £100m to a fund controlled by a former interior
  minister. In Romania, Liberty Galați staved off bankruptcy after a majority of
  creditors this month agreed to restructure debts reported to be worth 4.7bn
  lei (£806m). Steelworks in Belgium, Hungary, Luxembourg and Poland have also
  been declared bankrupt within the last year, with governments scrambling to
  find new buyers. Judith Kirton-Darling, the general secretary at IndustriAll,
  a federation of unions including several representing Liberty workers, said:
  “Liberty Steel has been catastrophic for European steelworkers across the
  continent in their management of key industrial assets. The current steel
  market is volatile because of geopolitical tensions and massive structural
  overcapacity especially in Asia, but this doesn’t explain what has gone wrong
  in this company. “Workers have long called for government to step in and
  ensure new owners of these industrial sites but their mismanagement and
  underinvestment by Liberty Steel over years has made this difficult. Thousands
  of jobs have already been lost.” Fraud investigation A shadow hanging over
  GFG’s efforts to refinance all of its companies has been an investigation into
  it by the UK’s Serious Fraud Office. The SFO made its investigation public in
  2021, and attended Liberty Steel offices in April 2022 to take away documents;
  it has not issued any update since. However, there have been other indications
  of fraud concerns. A 2018 private investigator’s report prepared for bankers
  at Credit Suisse, the main lender to Greensill, said that Liberty and Gupta
  were a “clear participant” in a multibillion-dollar fraud because many
  purported trades were “simply fake”, according to a copy quoted by Bloomberg.
  The Financial Times has separately reported on documents that purported to
  show GFG sold products to companies who denied having done business with the
  steel group. A lawyer for GFG Alliance said that the group “categorically”
  denied any wrongdoing to Bloomberg. Gupta wrote in a 2021 letter to the
  Financial Times: “I’d like to make clear that I refute any suggestion of
  wrongdoing.” Other bankers within Credit Suisse ignored the concerns, and
  continued to lend to Greensill; Greensill’s collapse contributed to Credit
  Suisse’s own fall and purchase by its rival, UBS. UBS, which declined to
  comment, is now the lead creditor hoping that administrators for Greensill
  Capital will recover their money from Liberty Steel companies through courts
  across the world. Running out of road While the SFO investigation continues,
  the various insolvency proceedings have given a rare window into Gupta’s
  scramble to find money. One recurring Gupta tactic to get through difficulties
  has been to shift money between companies to cover temporary shortfalls.
  However, that strategy may have run out of road. Across the tangled web of
  companies that form part of the GFG Alliance, at least 15 companies in nine
  countries are in insolvency proceedings, the high court heard. Take Liberty’s
  relatively small 140-person operation in Hartlepool, northern England, making
  pipes for oil and gas – and potentially hydrogen. HM Revenue and Customs this
  month filed a separate winding-up petition over allegedly unpaid tax (although
  Liberty Steel said that the tax has now been paid). Accounts for the
  Hartlepool business are three and a half years late, and Gupta faces
  prosecution in a November hearing over the failure to file accounts for it and
  for other companies. The last published accounts suggested that the company is
  dependent on its Singapore parent, Liberty House Group (LHG), to continue as a
  going concern. Yet LHG was placed into administration in Singapore in April
  over unpaid debts to ArcelorMittal, a giant steel-producing rival. A judgment
  from that case revealed how Gupta tried to retain control of Liberty House: he
  said he would “monetise” another asset, the Tahmoor coalmine in Australia.
  That would free up $42.5m that could be returned to creditors, including
  ArcelorMittal and the Greensill creditors – despite Gupta owing 100 times
  that, about $4.2bn. The Singaporean judge appeared unimpressed with the
  suggestion, writing: “Mr Gupta was proposing to raise funds from entities he
  ultimately owned and controlled to enable the company to discharge its debts
  entirely by paying one cent to the dollar, while retaining (beneficial)
  ownership and control of the company and the group”. Instead, the judge said
  it was unclear whether Gupta could even come up with the 1% return offered. He
  put the company into administration, noting a “lack of candour” about how it
  expected to find the money. GFG had claimed in February that it had reached
  agreement on commercial terms to settle its Greensill debts; that claim
  appears to have been wildly optimistic, at best. For SSUK, Gupta had in
  December proposed to give Greensill creditors £500,000, compared with £289m
  owed. Counsel for the creditors told the high court in London that they “have
  had enough” of waiting. Life after Gupta? Eddie Hughes, the South Australian
  Labor MP whose seat covers Whyalla, said the town is better off without Gupta.
  (In Australia, Gupta still owns an alloy plant in Tasmania plus InfraBuild, a
  company making beams with electric arc furnaces in Sydney and Melbourne.
  Bondholders have insisted on a “ringfence around InfraBuild from the rest of
  GFG” to prevent money flowing out from a business still making significant
  revenues.) “No one believed that the situation was going to improve while he
  was that strong presence in Whyalla, and in fact, there was a belief that the
  place would just be run into the ground,” Hughes said. “There is a real
  material difference now. There’s still a way to go, but at least that
  [government] money is being spent on the things that need to be addressed.”
  Whyalla is a once-thriving port city that formerly boasted a profitable
  steelworks and in-demand shipyard. Its population has ebbed and flowed with
  its changing fortunes, and the city is now home to a modest 21,000 people. A
  quarter of the workforce is directly employed by the steelworks, plus another
  35% working for it indirectly, according to a government report. In June,
  Gupta also lost control of the adjoining port, which had accumulated $A194m of
  debts, according to administrator, William Buck. Michael Brereton, of William
  Buck, said the future of the city is intricately linked to a successful sale
  of the steelworks. Australia’s largest steelmaker, BlueScope, is part of an
  international consortium considering a takeover. “Seven years ago, Gupta was
  hailed as a hero for having stepped in to save the whole business; he’s no
  longer the hero,” said Brereton. “If they’re not able to find a purchaser, the
  [steelmaking] business would get shut down and Whyalla would no longer have a
  reason to be.” A GFG Alliance spokesperson said Gupta’s investments had
  ensured that “many GFG businesses survived despite operating losses, and
  safeguard[ed] thousands of UK jobs which would otherwise be lost. “Liberty’s
  strategy has been to identify underperforming or distressed assets that had
  latent value and that could be transformed over time to produce or process
  green steel. Its approach has been to rebuild and reinvigorate these
  businesses while protecting and generating well-paid local employment in
  less-advantaged communities across the UK. “Liberty has remained committed to
  this task even while implementing a complex financial restructuring following
  the collapse of Greensill Capital in 2021, which has affected access to
  capital at some Liberty operations. “Like all steel producers globally,
  Liberty has been impacted by major challenges from wider market conditions and
  the costs of decarbonising legacy industrial assets.” The workers in the UK,
  Australia and in other plants across the world that are still part of Gupta’s
  empire are left with huge questions over their futures, and over whether Gupta
  can follow through on his many promises, secure the backing of the investors
  he insists he has lined up, and turn things around. For those at SSUK, there
  was a sense of relief, and some hope that their business will have a future
  beyond Liberty Steel. “I do think in the long run it will be a dawn for a new
  future,” said one worker. “We’ve been wanting rid of Gupta for a while.”
