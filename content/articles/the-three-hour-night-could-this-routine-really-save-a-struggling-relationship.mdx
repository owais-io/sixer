  The three-hour night: could this routine really save a struggling
  relationship?

  Name: The three-hour night. Age: Born on TikTok 18 months ago. A three-hour
  night? I aim for seven: one hour plotting my enemies’ downfall, five poking my
  snoring partner, then one pressing “snooze” every eight minutes and cursing.
  But we’re talking about evenings, really. What about them, exactly? Rachel
  Higgins, a TikToker in San Diego, came up with the “three-hour night” to make
  good use of the time she and her husband have between putting their young kids
  to bed and going to sleep themselves. So they spend evenings picking up
  plastic while eating cold fish fingers and abandoned crusts, then slump on the
  sofa staring at their phones, right? That’s precisely what they’re trying to
  avoid with this nightly routine. OK, go on, let’s hear it. The first hour is
  “productive time”, when the couple tidy up or do chores, then the second hour,
  Higgins says, is a phone-free slot “solely dedicated to each other”. That
  might mean playing games or sharing a shower, she suggests. “Anything that’s
  gonna get you … talking and connecting.” This already sounds exhausting. The
  good news is that the third hour is purely for yourself: you can do “anything
  you want, without judgment”. Even watching videos of men checking the
  transmission fluid on their Toyota Aygos? I don’t know what that means, but no
  judgment. Categorising Ordnance Survey maps by latitude? No judgment. And this
  works? When she first posted about it, Higgins called the three-hour night
  “such a gamechanger” for their relationship. Her advice resurfaced recently as
  part of the latest wave of couples’ hacks for the online age. Because
  relationships have to compete with shiny rectangles full of rare minerals and
  distraction – and the phones are winning. Have you heard of phubbing? Is that
  a sex thing? Quite the opposite: it’s snubbing your partner to look at your
  phone. It’s bad, too: research this year found “strong negative correlations
  between phubbing and emotional closeness”. People who thought their partners
  phubbed them regularly “were three times more likely to express disinterest in
  having children”. That does sound disturbing. What other ideas are there for
  keeping the spark? The New York Times recently suggested couples should have
  more fun together: send silly texts, play games, plan pranks and surprises. I
  would rather go through a harrowing divorce. Maybe you’re in a BBH
  relationship. A what? A “boring but happy” one. According to another piece of
  recent relationship advice, from the therapist Jean-Claude Chalmet, happy
  couples relish routine and doing mundane stuff together. Aha! We already do
  that – and not for three hours, but all the time. Just yesterday we cleaned
  the dishwasher sprinkler arm together. You guys are truly #couplegoals. Do
  say: “Hey, let’s not look at our phones tonight, shall we?” Don’t say:
  “Instead, we can have the blazing row we’ve been scrolling to avoid.” • This
