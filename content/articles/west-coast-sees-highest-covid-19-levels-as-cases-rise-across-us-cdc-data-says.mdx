  Several states in the western US are experiencing a surge in new Covid-19
  infections, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control
  and Prevention. An update released on Friday shows Covid-19 activity in
  wastewater has risen to a “moderate” level nationwide, up from “low” the week
  before. The highest levels are in the western US, including in states such as
  Alaska, California, Colorado, Nevada and Utah, all of which are marked as
  “high”. “Wastewater monitoring can detect viruses spreading from one person to
  another within a community earlier than clinical testing and before people who
  are sick go to their doctor or hospital,” the CDC notes. “If you see increased
  wastewater viral activity levels, it might indicate that there is a higher
  risk of infection.” Wastewater tracking is often used as an early detection
  tool for monitoring potential future upticks. According to the California
  department of public health’s own wastewater tracking, statewide infection
  numbers have now surpassed winter highs. Other metrics are also showing
  increases in the illness. As of Tuesday, the CDC estimates Covid-19 infections
  are growing or probably growing in 45 states, which is up from 40 last week. A
  new Covid-19 variant, XFG, or “Stratus”, is on the rise in the US, becoming
  the third-most common strain of the summer. The variant was first detected in
  south-east Asia in January but was barely detected in the US until May. By
  late June, it was estimated to account for up to 14%, according to the CDC.
  During a CBS interview in July, physician Jon LaPook said that this type of
  rise was typical for the summer. “We now know that there’s a winter spike and
  then there’s a summer spike,” the outlet’s chief medical correspondent said in
  the interview. “And every year, the number of deaths, the number of
  hospitalizations, is gradually going down each season. So that’s the good
  news.” Still, experts caution it is too soon to know how big the developing
  late-summer wave could get. While cases are rising more slowly than at the
  start of previous surges, varied immune responses from prior infections and
  vaccinations make it difficult to predict how severe illnesses could be. The
  risks are further compounded by new vaccine restrictions from the Trump
  administration. The rise in Covid-19 cases comes as the US Department of
  Health and Human Services announced on Tuesday it will terminate 22 federal
  contracts for mRNA-based vaccines, raising questions about the safety of a
  technology credited with helping end the pandemic and saving millions of
  lives. The CDC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
