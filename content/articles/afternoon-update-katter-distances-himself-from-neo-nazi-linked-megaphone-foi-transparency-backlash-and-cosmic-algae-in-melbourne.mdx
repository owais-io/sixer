  Good afternoon. The federal MP Bob Katter has distanced himself from a
  neo-Nazi group that claimed ownership of a megaphone he used briefly at a
  Townsville rally against mass immigration, with the veteran politician
  claiming he has been the victim of “bullying” in the media. Photos and video
  from Sunday’s rally show Katter speaking into a microphone attached to a black
  megaphone bullhorn held by another man. The bullhorn, covered in white runic
  markings, was later referred to on the messaging app Telegram as “the NSN rune
  megaphone” by a prominent member of neo-Nazi group the National Socialist
  Network. A similar megaphone was seen being held by NSN members in Melbourne
  on Sunday. “There was a person there with a speakerphone, which we used
  because we didn’t have one ourselves – so that’s about the extent of the
  relationship,” his son Robbie Katter told the ABC. Nick Dametto, a Katter’s
  Australian party MP, said in a statement that Katter’s Australian party “do
  not stand for neo-Nazi values, and do not have any relationship with the men
  alluded to”. Meanwhile, Jacinta Allan said she was “unharmed and undeterred”
  after the NSN’s leader, Thomas Sewell, ambushed the Victorian premier in the
  middle of a media conference shouting abuse. “It comes as no surprise that
  Nazis oppose me and my government. I wear that as a badge of honour,” Allan
  said. Top news Labor facing backlash over plans to curb access to government
