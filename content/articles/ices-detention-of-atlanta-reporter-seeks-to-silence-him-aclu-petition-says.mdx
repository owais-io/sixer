  The ACLU called Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s continued detention of
  Atlanta-area journalist Mario Guevara an act of retaliation for his reporting
  on immigration raids, according to a federal petition filed on Thursday.
  Guevara, a Salvadorian immigrant who has been in the United States for more
  than 20 years, was arrested on 14 June by a police officer in suburban Atlanta
  while covering the “No Kings” day protests in a neighborhood with a high
  density of immigrants. Despite all charges being dropped, Guevara has been in
  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention in south Georgia for
  almost two months, the only journalist in the US imprisoned as a consequence
  of their work today, the ACLU said. Guevara founded MG News, a social
  media-driven news organization that has become increasingly important to his
  Spanish-speaking audience for his coverage of Ice activities in metro Atlanta.
  As he was being arrested, Guevara was livestreaming on Facebook to more than a
  million followers. “The government’s continuing detention of Mr Guevara on the
  basis of his journalism is intended to silence him, prevent him from reporting
  in the future, and retaliate against him for his past speech and reporting, in
  violation of the first amendment,” the filing in the Brunswick, Georgia,
  courthouse states. “The government’s continuing detention of Mr Guevara also
  violates the substantive due process clause of the fifth amendment because it
  has no legitimate objective and is punitive.” Guevara has no criminal history
  and has been issued a work permit. An immigration judge administratively
  closed an order for his deportation a decade ago. The oldest of his two
  children who are US citizens has sponsored his green card application. After
  his arrest in June, DeKalb county prosecutors dropped the misdemeanor charges
  against Guevara almost immediately. The sheriff’s office of neighboring
  Gwinnett county – taking issue with his livestreaming a prostitution arrest a
  month earlier – filed misdemeanor traffic charges shortly after Guevara’s
  arrest. Gwinnett prosecutors dropped those charges days later. Nonetheless,
  Guevara is still in the Folkston Ice detention center and faces removal. An
  immigration judge issued a $7,500 bond for Guevara in June, but immigration
  enforcement officials appealed that bond decision and it is now on hold with
  no date set to hear the appeal. The ACLU filing attempts to induce the federal
  court to intervene. Referring to the bond hearing in June, the ACLU noted that
  the immigration judge recognized the first amendment implications of his
  detention. The judge said in his bond order that “if respondent was acting as
  a journalist, he is protected by freedom of speech as detailed in the
  constitution and longstanding, precedential case law”, and noted that
  “reporting on Ice raids in the community, as respondent has done, is a
  national concern and many other journalists across the nation are also
  reporting on this issue”. Immigration enforcement officials have argued in
  court that Guevara presents a danger to the community because he livestreams,
  records and publishes law enforcement activities and shares his reporting with
  the public. The ACLU filing details Guevara’s extensive cooperation with law
  enforcement over the years, and notes that a metro Atlanta law enforcement
  officer testified on his behalf at the bond hearing. In its filing, the ACLU
  argues that it is “highly unusual” for the government to appeal an immigration
  judge’s decision to grant bond when someone has no significant criminal
  history and presents strong evidence that he’s not a danger to the community.
  “The government generally reserves bond appeals, and especially stays, for
  cases involving serious criminal conduct, clear evidence of danger to the
  community or major flight risk,” the ACLU wrote, adding that the government
  relies almost exclusively on “Mr Guevara’s reporting as justification for his
  continued detention”. The ACLU noted that immigration officials presented
  Guevara’s live stream of a Gwinnett county sheriff’s office operation in its
  argument against issuing a bond in July. “The livestreaming videos that formed
  the basis for the misdemeanor traffic violations are no longer available on
  the MG News or Mr Guevara’s Facebook pages,” the ACLU filing states. “Neither
  Mr Guevara nor an employee of MG News removed these videos from these Facebook
  pages. Mr Guevara is not aware of how or why the videos were removed.” The
  petition asks for the court to demand an answer to the petition within three
  days, for Guevara’s bond case to be removed to federal court, for the stay on
  his bond to be lifted, and for the court to declare that Ice’s effort to
  continue detention violates the first amendment and the due process clause of
  the fifth amendment.
