  A quarter of state secondary schools in England will start the new term with
  no dedicated physics teacher, with schools in poorer areas worst affected,
  analysis has found. The lack of specialists means more than half (58%) of
  pupils studying for a science GCSE will have the physics component taught by a
  teacher who has not studied a physics-related subject beyond the age of 18. An
  estimated 700,000 pupils are affected, according to the Institute of Physics,
  which carried out the analysis and is calling for urgent action to tackle what
  it describes as a “chronic and critical” shortage of specialist physics
  teachers. The IoP report says students in schools without a specialist physics
  teacher are half as likely as those with sufficient physics specialists to go
  on to study A-level physics, “a crucial gateway” to further studies leading to
  careers in science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem). It calculates
  that more than 12,000 students are missing out on taking A-level physics as a
  direct result of having no specialist teacher, while more than 300 English
  state secondaries are failing to produce any pupils who progress to study
  physics at A-level. The report says the shortage is having a bigger impact on
  students in disadvantaged areas because their schools are less likely to have
  “in-field” physics teachers, while independent and top-scoring state schools
  cream off the best recruits. “Data show that only 4% of students in the lowest
  socioeconomic status quintile take physics A-level, compared with about 11% in
  the highest quintile, and that 70% of A-level physics students come from just
  30% of schools,” it says. It is not a new problem. The lack of physics
  teachers is down to three decades of low recruitment and high attrition rates,
  which have left the state system in need of an additional 3,500 specialists at
  a time when the country is facing a severe skills shortage. There have been
  signs of improvement in physics teacher training recruitment, which went up
  from 17% of the government’s target in 2023 to 30% last year, but the report
  highlights problems with retention. Nearly half (44%) of newly trained physics
  teachers left the profession within five years, compared with a third of
  teachers overall. The IoP is urging the UK government to invest in a £120m,
  10-year programme to tackle the crisis. Tom Grinyer, the IoP’s chief
  executive, said: “This report paints a worrying picture of an education system
  struggling to find and keep the physics teachers we need. That means hundreds
  of thousands of young people being taught physics by non-specialists. “Despite
  the often heroic efforts of teachers having to work in unfamiliar subjects,
  inevitably many of those students are missing out. Research shows that pupils
  without access to a specialist physics teacher are much less likely to choose
  to study the subject at A-level. If we fail to tackle this challenge then we
  are failing to nurture the scientists and innovators of tomorrow – with
  serious consequences for our society and economy.” A Department for Education
  spokesperson said: “We are already delivering on our pledge to recruit and
  retain 6,500 more talented teachers, with 2,300 more secondary and special
  schoolteachers in classrooms this year, as well as 1,300 fewer teachers
  leaving the profession – one of the lowest leave rates since 2010. “We’ve also
  seen a 25% increase in the number of people accepting teacher training places
  starting this autumn in Stem subjects. Through our plan for change, we will go
  further still to ensure every pupil has access to the expert teachers they
  need including continuing to offer tax-free incentives to encourage more
  talented people into the classroom to teach subjects including physics.” Tom
  Middlehurst, the deputy director of policy at the Association of School and
  College Leaders, said: “Targets for recruiting trainee physics teachers are
  missed by very large margins. The underlying problem is that teaching salaries
  struggle to compete with the private sector, and this is compounded by
  workloads and responsibilities which affect retention. “School leaders
  endeavour to mitigate those pressures but they’re operating under extremely
  difficult conditions with insufficient funding and demanding performance
  tables and inspections. The result is that it can be extremely difficult to
  put specialist physics teachers in front of classes, and schools often have no
  option other than to use non-specialists.”
