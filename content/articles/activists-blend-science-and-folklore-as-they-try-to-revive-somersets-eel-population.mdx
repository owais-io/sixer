  Activists blend science and folklore as they try to revive Somerset’s eel

  When the Somerset Levels flood in winter, their reed-fringed waterways swell
  into a glinting inland sea – haunting and half forgotten. Generations ago,
  these wetlands pulsed with the seasonal arrival of eels: twisting through
  rhynes – human-made water channels – and ditches in their thousands, caught in
  baskets, sung about in pubs and paid as rent to Glastonbury Abbey. Today those
  same waters flow more slowly, more sparsely: once-teeming channels now show
  only the barest traces of what was here. Determined to reverse that collapse,
  the Somerset Eel Recovery Project is weaving together science, folklore and
  community creativity to bring back not only the eel but a lost sense of local
  identity. Its mission is both ecological and emotional: to help restore a
  critically endangered species while reviving the human stories, songs and
  names that once made Somerset an eel country. Vanessa Becker-Hughes, one of
  the project’s founders, has built partnerships across science, policy and the
  arts. She runs a growing school programme – 60 eel tanks were installed in
  local classrooms last year – as well as storytelling events, traditional
  rope-making workshops and citizen science efforts that test for eel DNA in
  rivers. “I try to come at it from different angles,” she said. “Sometimes we
  do science, sometimes we do a river blessing. But it’s all about connection.”
  The project has attracted high-profile supporters. Feargal Sharkey, the former
  Undertones singer turned clean water campaigner, has amplified the project’s
  efforts online, calling it “a vital act of ecological and cultural
  restoration”. The celebrity chef and sustainability advocate Hugh
  Fearnley-Whittingstall recently became an official “eel legend” – the
  tongue-in-cheek name given to some fundraisers who help pay for habitat work
  and education. “Eels have fascinated me for a long time,” he said. “I have
  gone from poacher to gamekeeper: cooking them to realising how important it is
  to protect these extraordinary, charismatic creatures. They are a keystone
  species with a remarkable natural history, that deserves our respect and our
  custodianship.” Across Europe, the population of the European eel has dropped
  by more than 90% since the 1970s. Between 1980 and 2009, eel numbers in
  Somerset’s Bridgwater Bay – once a thriving gateway for glass eels – dropped
  by 99%. The causes are multiple and connected: overfishing, pollution,
  hydrological infrastructure blocking migration, climate-driven shifts and the
  spread of a parasitic nematode damaging the eels’ swim bladders.
  Becker-Hughes’ blend of wonder and urgency fuels her determination. She
  believes that rebuilding our lost relationship with eels means rekindling
  communal memory through shared rituals and skills. “We make straw ropes, which
  we put over barriers. They get wet and the little glass eels use them to climb
  up and over. But more than that – it gets people to visit these weirs. They
  notice the water. They count the eels. They start to care,” she said. Andrew
  Kerr, the chair of the Sustainable Eel Group, says eels once shaped
  placenames, customs and livelihoods. He believes it is crucial that we rebuild
  our lost relationship with them. “If we lose the eel, we lose a sense of our
  identity. We forget the songs. We forget what this landscape was,” he said.
  Becker-Hughes said all is not yet lost. “Each spring tide still brings new
  arrivals,” she said. “The eel is not just a ghost of the past – it is a key to
  unlocking something vital in the present.” With every story told, every rope
  woven and every child watching a glass eel wriggle up a straw ladder, she
  believes, a small restoration of species, memory and care takes place.
