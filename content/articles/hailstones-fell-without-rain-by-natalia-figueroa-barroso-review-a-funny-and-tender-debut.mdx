  Graciela María Ferreira – or “Grachu” to her loved ones – is late with the
  rent again, and she needs the money now. Unfortunately, she’s spent her last
  dollars on a plush couch, and her landlord is waiting on her doorstep. Grachu
  isn’t always a believer, but today “she needs God to find her a new job”. So
  begins Hailstones Fell Without Rain – Natalia Figueroa Barroso’s debut, and
  the second published novel by a Uruguayan-Australian writer. The novel opens
  in Sydney’s Fairfield, where “families tug at their children in a musicality
  of languages: Vamos! Yalla! đi nào!”. It’s a world alive with rhythm and
  colour, and the syncopation of the streets seems to shape the book’s very
  form. With Grachu’s life at its centre, the novel jumps between Western Sydney
  and Uruguay, past and present, tracking the shifting relationships between
  Grachu, her oldest daughter Rita, and her Aunt Chula, and the challenges and
  joys that have shaped their lives. We first meet Grachu in middle age, a
  migrant and struggling single mother determined to hold things together for
  herself and her three daughters. In the second of the novel’s three parts,
  narrated by Chula, we meet Grachu as a baby in Uruguay, born under the shadow
  of a civic-military dictatorship (1973–1985). The novel traces the long
  aftershocks of colonisation, state control and migration. It grapples with the
  cruelty of oppression, the exhausting calculations that poverty requires, and
  the necessity – and cost – of resilience and resistance. It is clear that
  survival is a political act, and Figueroa Barroso’s political and emotional
  insight shines through in the details. Sign up for our rundown of must-reads,
  pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Yet, even as
  Hailstones explores these realities, it refuses to be consumed by them.
  Instead, it asks “Isn’t joy a form of resistance?” It offers an unflinching
  look at what gets passed on – grief, trauma and pain – but it also celebrates
  the inverse of these experiences: resilience, healing and love. The book’s
  geographic and emotional range is expansive, but at its heart are the
  indomitable spirits of the Ferreira women, who come flying at life “like
  arrows in a quiver waiting to be nocked, drawn and fired”. The book is
  strikingly unsentimental. Grachu is loving, impulsive, funny, and deeply
  flawed. She sabotages herself as often as she uplifts others. Her
  relationships are marred by misunderstanding, loss, confusion and distance.
  Yet across these ruptures, love persists. Hailstones is, among many things, a
  celebration of matrilineal connection; the bond between Grachu, Rita and Chula
  is marked by fierce loyalty that endures despite their challenges.
  Stylistically, the novel is eclectic and exuberant – sometimes dizzyingly so.
  Figueroa Barroso’s prose pulses with life, blending Spanish-language lyricism
  and accented vowels with the staccato beat of Western Sydney slang. It doesn’t
  pause to explain itself; like the world it represents, the novel code-switches
  constantly, folding Spanish into English and history into the present with
  unselfconscious ease. Figueroa Barroso’s vibrant literary voice echoes diverse
  influences, from the intergenerational structure used by Latin-American
  writers such as Isabelle Allende and Gabriel García Márquez, to the drama of
  telenovelas and the grit of urban realism – while still feeling wholly her
  own. Occasionally, the narrative threads – and the prose that connects them –
  become messy. Disconnected episodes risk undermining the structural integrity
  of the work, and minor characters arrive and depart with no real impact. While
  these moments can occasionally distract from the novel’s core momentum, they
  also enrich our understanding of Grachu’s life and world. This is a book more
  concerned with atmosphere than with tidy narrative arcs, and its emotional
  realism is enabled by this chaos. Hailstones Fell Without Rain is a funny,
  tender and fiercely irreverent debut that brims with life. It’s a novel that
  insists on complexity, and on loving people even when it’s complicated.
  Figueroa Barroso’s compassion and commitment to justice are clear on every
  page. Hailstones Fell without Rain by Natalia Figueroa Barroso is out through
  UQP ($34.99)
