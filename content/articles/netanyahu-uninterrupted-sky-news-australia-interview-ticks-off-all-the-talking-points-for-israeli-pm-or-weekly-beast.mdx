  talking points for Israeli PM | Weekly Beast

  There’s reasons people call for Dorothy dixers to be ditched. They so very
  rarely elicit new information and therefore efficiently provide a platform for
  talking points. Sky News After Dark’s Sharri Markson had her second exclusive
  one-on-one with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Thursday
  night. Markson lobbed up the questions and Netanyahu returned serve,
  untrammelled. The analogy the pair laboured was of Hamas as the Nazis before
  the second world war. Churchill was summoned in the service of this analogy –
  in which somehow Australia is part of a global “appeasement” of Hamas. “Is
  this word appeasement a direct reference to how Europe dealt with Hitler in
  the 1930s and do you think we’re seeing from leaders like [prime minister
  Anthony] Albanese and others a similar complacency?” Markson asked. Netanyahu
  picked it up and ran with it. “It’s appeasement, pure and simple,” he said.
  Markson went on. “Part of the problem here is that there is a very effective
  propaganda campaign being run against Israel. The Albanese government is
  aiding and abetting it. So are some media outlets. Prime minister, what do you
  say to the libels that Israel is deliberately starving Palestinian children
  and is conducting a genocide in Gaza?” she asked. “It’s the same lies that
  were levelled at the Jewish people in the middle ages,” Netanyahu said.
  Disputed claims about Hamas’ actions went straight through to the keeper
  (who’s got a tortured analogy now?) as Netanyahu strolled his way through the
  interview. Netanyahu declared Israel would “win both the propaganda war and
  the war on the ground”. The first bit was true, at least on Sky News. Summit
  hedging bets Pity the poor subeditor tasked with editing mining magnate Gina
  Rinehart’s column for News Corp’s special Bush Summit liftout. Actually, it
  looks like they were told to leave the copy in its pristine form and take off
  early to the pub. The Bush Summit – presented nationally by her companies
  Hancock Prospecting and S Kidman &amp; Co – is on again. There are events
  around the nation with keynotes from luminaries including the prime minister,
  Anthony Albanese, and climate change denier Ian Plimer (although the in-paper
  ads don’t mention Plimer), now a director at Hancock Prospecting. And there’s
  the column from Australia’s richest person, apparently left blissfully
  edit-free. Rinehart crafts the image of a dystopian future in which the Royal
  Flying Doctor Service cannot save lives because “we’ve exceeded our emissions
  permitted”. Nurses and doctors would be forced to buy electric vehicles before
  seeing patients, nursing homes would close. “Those who die,” she writes, “the
  funeral services can’t handle. “The disruption and expense immense.” And what
  of the poor farmers, who are some of the “many many many Australians” who’ll
  be hurt? “They can increase the costs they sell us food for awhile, but then
  many Australians will be forced to buy inferior products from overseas, where
  net zero isn’t a burden, and where clean water and clean air may not or are
  not available like here in Australia, while our own delicious agriculture
  industry sadly shrivels up,” she writes. The awkward clarion call to end net
  zero is only outdone by the awkwardness of its juxtaposition with stories
  about the impacts of climate change. The liftouts include a piece from Daily
  Tele cartoonist Warren Brown on the “green drought” in parts of Australia –
  the more sporadic rainfall behind the phenomenon is linked to climate change.
  There’s a piece on bushfires threatening species with extinction, and other
  tales of droughts and floods, all of which are linked to climate change. The
  cognitive dissonance was particularly painful while reading the Advertiser. A
  big pic lead on the front page covered the drought in South Australia, while
  page 2 was on the “devastating outbreak” of the algal bloom, which is – you
  guessed it – linked to climate change. Drakonian take Supermarket manager and
  media darling JP Drake has made headlines saying he is forced to “import”
  workers despite 23% unemployment, blaming welfare for Australians allegedly
  not wanting to work. With echoes of the Paxton family era about it, Drake (who
  oversees the $1.3bn business and says he is rich enough to not have to work)
  went on the podcast 2 Worlds Collide a week ago, with media happily picking up
  on his comments days later. “I’m importing people from Vanuatu because I can’t
  get workers to work at my site,” he says on the podcast. He says while their
  “English is not the best”, they’re happy. He says in the area around Edinburgh
  North, where Drakes has a distribution centre, there is a 23% unemployment
  rate. Only that doesn’t seem to be accurate. Edinburgh North itself doesn’t
  have a big enough population to be statistically significant, but sits within
  the City of Playford, which has an unemployment rate of 9.3%. High by
  Australian standards, but not 23%. He might have been talking about nearby
  Elizabeth, a tiny suburb with about 1,000 people (part of the larger Elizabeth
  area), where unemployment is at about 20%. Next door, Elizabeth East is 9.3%.
  Multiple news outlets picked up on his claims – although not all those who
  picked up his theme repeated the specific 23% claim. Drake is somewhat of a
  media darling in South Australia. He has used social media to publish pictures
  of shoplifters, and claimed they’re trading meat for drugs. He has blamed the
  “rush to renewables” for power prices, didn’t mandate staff getting vaccinated
  during Covid, and hit out at “Wokeworths” for moving away from Australia Day
  merchandising. In his latest outing, he complained the minimum wage was “so
  high”. He said that when he visited one of his growers he “didn’t see a white
  Australian” (although he added he wasn’t saying just because someone wasn’t
  white they weren’t Australian). “People don’t wanna work,” he says. “We pay
  enough out on Centrelink and benefits for the people that maybe don’t deserve
  it.” Hamming it up Former MP George Christensen is launching a terrifyingly
  militaristic-sounding “anti-regime media platform” called Command Post. “It’s
  a war room,” he says, promising “tactical intel”, a “national effort to fight
  back against the managed decline of Australian democracy”, and a “weekly audio
  sitrep”. And, here’s a clue. “It’s about sovereignty,” he writes. It’s very
  macho and punchy and ends with a plea for subscriptions and donations. “Will
  be looking at ham radios,” one social media user commented. “What’s ham
  radios?” another replied. Indeed. Magical thinking We’ve had the horror of
  horoscopes on TV news bulletins, and the lighthearted farce of psychic
  crocodiles. This week, on the Daily Telegraph’s page 3, chief entertainment
  writer Jonathon Moran confessed he was moved to tears – and belief – by
  celebrity medium David Stevens. Stevens is on a PR blitz and appeared in the
  Nine newspapers a couple of days earlier. Moran says Stevens knew everything
  about him, “literally everything”, including an undisclosed family secret.
  Stevens specialises in necromancy, talking to the dead, or being a “medium” if
  you prefer something more palatable. But he also does more Nostradamus-style
  stuff. His 2024 predictions included China rising, the US breaking down
  (before the election) and seeing increasing social unrest and terrorism after
  the election. There would be health discoveries, AI, bushfires and “lots of
  big waves”. So far, so generic, but then: “After stepping into his power in
  2024 and showing it didn’t work, Anthony Albanese steps off,” he wrote, adding
  there would be no changes in the economy to “high interest
  rates/costs/inflation”. Stick to radio It’s perilous for a fallible journalist
  to nitpick on grammatical errors, but there’s a stonking typo in the latest
  promo for 3AW’s breakfast show. “Breakfast radio at it’s best!” about 1,350
  posters across Melbourne proclaim. It’s an ad for “Ross and Russ” – Ross
  Stevenson and Russel Howcroft’s show. The pair discussed the typo on Monday
  and declared it “embarrassing”. The signs will be replaced, to protect
  pedantic Melbourne eyeballs.
