  back at Trump

  In the opening weeks of Donald Trump’s second term, Gavin Newsom wagered that
  peacemaking was best: a tarmac greeting for Air Force One, an Oval Office
  visit and a podcast slot for Maga’s biggest names. But then Trump came for
  California, and its governor dropped the niceties. With a flood of all-caps
  social media posts, a counterpunching redistricting proposal and a string of
  lawsuits challenging the new administration, Newsom is not just taking on
  Trump, he’s stealing his tactics: fight, fight, fight. “We’ve got to wake up,
  disabuse ourselves as Democrats,” Newsom said on a podcast this week. “I’m
  sick of being weak. I’m sick of being effete. I’m sick of being
  non-consequential. It’s not good enough to say it – it’s time to do.” Newsom
  has charged on to the national stage as a recast political brawler willing to
  wield power as ruthlessly as the other side. On Thursday, he signed a
  redistricting plan and declared a special election this fall that would ask
  voters to redraw the state’s congressional boundaries to give Democrats as
  many as five additional US House seats in next year’s midterm elections. The
  ballot measure is a direct attempt to “neuter and neutralize” Texas’s partisan
  gerrymander – engineered at Trump’s behest to safeguard Republicans’ fragile
  House majority. At a bill-signing ceremony, Newsom pointed to the president’s
  claim that he was “entitled” to five additional congressional seats in the
  Lone Star state: “That should put chills up your spine.” Now the California
  referendum transforms an off-cycle election year into a high-stakes national
  showdown that could determine control of Congress – and set the stage for
  2028. For Newsom, who’s term-limited and widely viewed as a presidential
  contender, the success – or failure – of this 11-week sprint could carry major
  consequences for his political future. The ballot measure gives voters in
  deep-blue California a chance to strike back at Trump, who has relentlessly
  tormented the state since returning to the White House. But by temporarily
  overriding California’s independent redistricting commission – long a point of
  pride in the Golden state – Democrats are being asked to “compromise their own
  values,” said Kim Nalder, a political science professor at California State
  University, Sacramento. “That’s been a guiding light for a lot of Democrats –
  the whole ‘they go low, we go high’ idea,” she said. “One of the risks is that
  the Democratic party – and Newsom himself – become associated with this
  all-out brawl, no-holds-barred fighting, rather than having a particular set
  of political principles that they stand by no matter what.” How Californians
  will decide remains uncertain. A Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies
  poll released on Friday shows 48% of registered voters in the state support
  Newsom’s redistricting plan, compared with 32% who oppose it. Another 20% are
  undecided, providing an opening for either campaign to make their pitch. “If
  Proposition 50 passes, and Californians succeed in adding more House seats,
  and is partially, if not completely, responsible for flipping the House next
  year, he’s a hero, plain and simple,” said Bill Whalen, a Hoover Institution
  fellow who was a speechwriter for Pete Wilson, the former Republican governor
  of California. Even if the initiative falls short in November, Whalen believes
  Newsom still benefits. “He still gets credit among those same Democrats for
  fighting the good fight,” he said. “I don’t see how he fails.” *** The all-out
  political war between the president and California’s governor erupted earlier
  this summer, when Trump seized control of California’s national guard and
  deployed US marines to Los Angeles, over Newsom’s objections, to suppress
  protests against the federal immigration crackdown. The raids are ongoing, and
  Trump has targeted the state in other ways: an attempt to strip federal
  funding from UCLA, and tariffs that threaten California’s economy – the fourth
  largest in the world. Newsom has argued that Trump was not just a threat to
  his state – but to the entire 249-year-old American project. While his
  approach might offend virtue-minded Democrats, he says the moment demands it.
  “Yes, I’ve changed,” he said recently in a local news interview. “The facts
  have changed. We need to change.” In recent weeks, as Newsom has stepped up
  his attacks on Trump as a “weak” and a “failed” leader, his social media team
  has trolled the president online – unleashing a jumble of unfiltered,
  stream-of-consciousness rants, AI-generated political fan art and schoolyard
  taunts, some of it signed with the governor’s initials, GCN, meant to parody
  the president’s own chaotic posting style. Newsom says he’s simply holding up
  a mirror. “If you’ve got issues with what I’m putting out,” he told reporters
  last week, “you sure as hell should have concerns about what he’s putting out
  as president.” The posts have gone viral – racking up millions of views,
  thousands of comments and driving a flood of engagement. They’ve also caught
  the attention of the right. Fox News hosts, Kid Rock, JD Vance and even Trump
  himself have all taken the bait, provoking what the governor’s staff gleefully
  dubbed “Maga meltdowns”. “JESSE WATTERS KEPT CALLING ME ‘DADDY’ (VERY WEIRD,
  NOT INTERESTED, BUT THANK YOU!)” his office clapped back, in an 188-word tweet
  about Fox News’s breathless coverage of Newsom’s furious posting streak.
  “Gavin Newsom can mimic Donald Trump all that he wants to,” Vance told Fox
  News host Laura Ingraham this week, “they’re still going to lose unless they
  get better policies that actually serve the American people.” Trump, for his
  part, weighed in on his own social media platform, Truth Social, vowing to
  save “the Once Great State of California” from “Newscum”. Newsom’s office
  fired back with a wink: “Triggered?” The Berkley poll suggested that
  California voters back his gloves-off strategy by a nearly two-to-one margin,
  with just 29% saying they’d prefer a more cooperative approach. The tougher
  posture lands especially well with younger voters: 71% of Californians under
  30 say they approve. This week, in a blitz of media appearances, Newsom
  escalated his rhetoric. “We’re fighting fire with fire,” he said on The Siren
  podcast last week. “And we’re going to punch these sons of bitches in the
  mouth.” The response was telling: no Democratic moralizing, no rebuke from
  party leaders, no pressure on Newsom to apologize. Instead, his team promoted
  the interview to his legions of new followers and supporters replied with
  MAGAesque AI images of Newsom as a superhero. “People are just not used to
  seeing this kind of rough around the edges, non-poll-tested messaging coming
  from Democrats,” said Olivia Julianna, a 22-year-old Democratic activist from
  Texas and social media influencer who interviewed Newsom for the episode.
  “It’s real, it’s raw, it’s authentic, and it shows that he’s a fighter.” As
  Democrats brace for the loss of up to five US House seats in her state, under
  the redistricting plan approved by the Texas legislature on Saturday, Julianna
  said voters alarmed by Trump’s increasingly brazen power grabs are desperate
  for leaders who offer more than just fighting words. “We want to feel like
  someone is standing on the frontlines ready to go to battle for us,” she said.
  “And that’s what it feels like Gavin Newsom is doing.” *** Newsom’s new
  fight-fire-with-fire strategy isn’t always trained on Trump. When the Bed Bath
  &amp; Beyond chair announced this week that he wouldn’t reopen stores in the
  state, calling it “overregulated, expensive and risky”, Newsom’s press office
  fired back. “After their bankruptcy and closure of every store, like most
  Americans, we thought Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond no longer existed,” it said. “We
  wish them well in their efforts to become relevant again.” He’s also taken on
  his own party. Earlier this year, he declared the Democratic brand “toxic” in
  an interview with provocateur Bill Maher – a diagnosis backed by polling and
  voter registration trends, but striking language for leader of the largest
  blue state who could seek his party’s nomination. He enraged progressives –
  already wary of his record on housing and homelessness – when he questioned
  the fairness of transgender women competing in women’s sports during a
  conversation with rightwing agitator Charlie Kirk on the inaugural episode of
  his podcast, This Is Gavin Newsom. The comments marked a split from other top
  Democrats on the issue and rattled some of his LGBTQ+ allies. In response to a
  Guardian story about the loss of care for trans youth in California, a Newsom
  spokesperson said critics should point the finger at Trump, not at a governor
  whose “record supporting the trans community is unmatched”. “Everyone wants to
  blame Gavin Newsom for everything. But instead of indulging in Newsom
  derangement syndrome, maybe folks should look to Washington,” the spokesperson
  said – invoking a pejorative phrase, “derangement syndrome”, used by Trump
  supporters to mock the president’s detractors. While his sharper tone angered
  some on the left, Newsom’s redistricting gambit has managed to unite
  progressives and establishment Democrats – and his once-stalled approval
  rating has jumped. The California plan has drawn praise from across the party,
  including Barack Obama, who called it “a responsible approach”, and the former
  House speaker Nancy Pelosi. With his plan in motion, he challenged other blue
  state leaders to follow suit, laying down the gauntlet for fellow Democratic
  governors with presidential ambitions as Trump expands his push to secure
  Republican advantages in states such as Indiana, Ohio and Missouri. That
  aggressive posture – in effect becoming an “anti-Trump troll” – has been
  cathartic for many Democrats, Nalder said. “Democrats nationwide have been
  feeling like the Trump administration has been punching their values and their
  party and democracy itself in the face repeatedly day after day and they’re
  just ready for somebody to punch the bully back,” she said. “And Newsom right
  now looks like he could be that guy.” *** Newsom’s campaign faces mounting
  opposition from Republicans, including those not in Trump’s Maga camp. The
  popular former Republican governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, a
  longtime Trump critic and advocate of independent redistricting.
  Schwarzenegger posted a photo of himself pressing weights in a shirt that
  read: “F*** THE POLITICIANS, TERMINATE GERRYMANDERING.” Former House speaker
  Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, has also vowed to pump money into
  what some observers predict could quickly become one of the most expensive
  contests in Golden state history. “The voters of California have a say,” he
  said in an interview on CNN this week. “If you truly believe in your power of
  your own vote, you should vote against this.” Newsom has raised more than
  $6.2m from 200,000 donations in the week since he officially launched the
  ballot campaign at a rally in Los Angeles last week, according to his team.
  There, Newsom stood side by side with labor leaders, members of the teacher’s
  union and the head of California’s Planned Parenthood. The plan even earned
  the endorsement of Sara Sadhwani, a Democrat who served on California’s 2020
  independent redistricting commission, who declared ruefully that
  “extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures”. As Newsome spoke at the
  Japanese American National Museum’s National Center for the Preservation of
  Democracy earlier this month, federal agents, armed and masked, fanned out
  across the complex. Newsom said their presence could not have been
  coincidental. The next day, his office filed a freedom of information request
  to get information about the administration’s involvement in the decision to
  send border patrol agents to that location. It was just more fuel for Newsom’s
  argument: his campaign is not just about congressional districts, but a
  referendum on Trump – and American democracy. “Donald Trump, you have poked
  the bear,” Newsom says in a new campaign ad, as the camera flashes to the
  grizzly on the state’s flag. “And we will punch back.”
