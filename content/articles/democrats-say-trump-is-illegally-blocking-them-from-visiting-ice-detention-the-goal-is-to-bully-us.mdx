  ‘The goal is to bully us’

  The Arizona representative Yassamin Ansari toured a detention facility in May
  where immigrants rounded up as part of the Trump administration’s campaign of
  mass deportation were being housed. She described what she saw inside as
  “sickening” and “worse than prison” – immigrant detainees were held in
  overcrowded, moldy cells and many reported that they did not have reliable
  access to food, water or medical care. Two months later, Ansari returned to
  the remote desert complex to conduct another congressional oversight visit.
  This time, she was denied entry. It wasn’t an isolated incident. From New York
  to California, Democratic members of Congress have been repeatedly blocked
  from entering Ice detention facilities where thousands of noncitizens – many
  with no criminal convictions – are being held. Democratic officials’
  legislative checks – a legal right for members of Congress – have consistently
  confirmed reports that immigrant detainees are being kept in “filthy” and
  “inhumane” conditions with little regard for due process. Now, the facilities
  have become a battleground in the intensifying standoff between the Trump
  administration and Democratic lawmakers over the president’s supercharged
  immigration agenda. “The administration’s goal is to intimidate us and bully
  us, bully us out of doing our jobs for sure,” Representative LaMonica McIver,
  a New Jersey Democrat who has been accused of assaulting federal agents during
  a confrontation at the Delaney Hall detention center, told the Guardian. “If
  they can get away with doing this to me, they can get away with doing it to
  anyone. But more importantly, imagine what they’re doing in the dark to others
  who are not of an elected status, who are not in public eye view.” McIver, who
  has pleaded not guilty, said her concerns took on new resonance when, a month
  later, detainees at the hastily-converted jailhouse pushed down a dormitory
  wall – an act advocates described as an outcry against hunger and
  overcrowding. Republicans accuse Democrats of failing to follow protocol, and
  say their unannounced visits are more political grandstanding than genuine
  congressional oversight. But Democrats counter that it is their responsibility
  to shed light on the most hidden aspects of Trump’s deportation agenda, which
  has ensnared Daca recipients, legal residents and even US citizens. A report
  released last week by Democratic senator Jon Ossoff’s office, compiled in part
  from site visits, found widespread human rights abuses in immigrant detention
  centers, including the mistreatment of pregnant women and children.
  “Obstruction of Congressional oversight by the Department of Homeland Security
  has been an impediment to site visits and interviews with detainees,” the
  report noted. The DHS sought to debunk the report, calling its allegations
  “garbage” and saying Ossoff and his staff have never been denied oversight
  visits. Last month, a dozen Democratic members of Congress filed suit over a
  Trump-era DHS policy requiring members of Congress and their staff to provide
  a week’s notice before any requested visit. They say the requirement is more
  than red tape – it is unconstitutional. The rule, the lawmakers argue in their
  suit, unlawfully restricts their oversight authority and prevents a co-equal
  branch of government from doing its job. Under a provision of federal law that
  funds Ice, the government may not prevent a member of Congress “from entering,
  for the purpose of conducting oversight, any facility operated by or for the
  Department of Homeland Security used to detain or otherwise house aliens”.
  Requiring advance notice, Democrats say, gives the administration time to
  create a misleading picture of daily operations. “This is kind of like general
  oversight 101,” Colorado representative Jason Crow, a Democrat and one of the
  plaintiffs, told the Guardian. “You announce a visit, and they roll out what
  they want you to see, and things are dressed up and cleaned up.” Crow has
  conducted site inspections at immigration detention sites in his district
  since 2019 – and he helped pass the law that solidified Congress’s right to
  make unannounced inspections. In July, he was blocked from entering a center
  in Aurora. Similar confrontations are playing out nationwide. On Wednesday, a
  delegation of Democratic representatives from New York, including the chair of
  the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Adriano Espaillat, were turned away from a
  center in Brooklyn now housing detained immigrants under a new agreement with
  the Bureau of Prisons. “This blatant lack of respect towards the legislative
  branch is a deterioration of checks and balances,” Espaillat said after the
  encounter. “All while they hide their atrocities from the public.” In a
  response posted on X, the DHS called the lawmakers’ efforts “deeply
  unserious”. “These members did not follow proper protocol and schedule their
  visit. Instead they brought a gaggle of media to drive clicks and fundraising
  emails,” the department said. In a statement, department spokeswoman Tricia
  McLaughlin said Ice had imposed the new visitation policy to protect the
  president’s constitutional authority to carry out immigration enforcement and
  protect agency personnel from “a surge in assaults, disruptions, and
  obstructions to enforcement – including by member of Congress themselves”. “A
  week is sufficient to ensure no intrusion on the President’s constitutional
  authority,” she said. As relatives and lawyers struggle to locate and contact
  people in Ice custody, advocates say congressional visits are essential to
  building a public record of conditions inside facilities that operate far from
  public view. “We are not talking about a mistake here and there,” said
  Clarissa Martínez De Castro, vice-president of the Latino Vote Initiative at
  UnidosUS. “We’re talking about a pattern of abuse that is happening in
  multiple communities, and bearing witness to that, and building that record so
  that members who may want to … are not able to say that this is happenstance
  or anecdotal.” Ice arrests and detentions rose sharply in the first six months
  after Trump returned to the White House. In Democratic-leaning states masked
  Ice agents are frequently arresting immigrants at worksites, in the streets
  and in mass roundups – aggressive tactics that triggered protests in cities
  such as Los Angeles. Their targets are increasingly people with no criminal
  records at all. As arrests soar to record numbers, the nation’s immigration
  detention system – a patchwork of government-run and private facilities – is
  buckling under the strain. By late June, it was over capacity by more than
  13,500 people, according to a Guardian analysis of public data from the
  Deportation Data Project. Ten immigration detainees have died in federal
  custody so far this year, compared to 11 deaths in all of 2024. McLaughlin
  called claims of overcrowding and poor conditions at Ice detention centers
  “categorically false”. The agency, she added, has “worked diligently to obtain
  greater necessary detention space” to accommodate the Trump administration’s
  mass arrest and incarceration operation. The scramble to create more detention
  beds has seen the agency sign new contracts with private prisons companies, as
  well as federal and state prisons. The secretary of the DHS, Kristi Noem,
  recently touted plans to open a detention center in Indiana it calls the
  “Speedway Slammer”, following the opening of “Alligator Alcatraz”, a facility
  built in the middle of the Florida Everglades. Last week, the Pentagon said
  Fort Bliss, an army base in Texas, was prepared to accept as many as 1,000
  immigrant detainees by the end of the month. On Tuesday, the Trump
  administration was ordered to improve conditions inside an immigration holding
  facility in New York City, after advocates filed a lawsuit on behalf of
  detainees who described being kept in unsanitary and overcrowded cells,
  without access to basic necessities, including hygiene products. *** Shortly
  after immigration raids swept Los Angeles in June, triggering days of tense
  protests, Congresswoman Judy Chu of California said her office began receiving
  urgent requests from advocates and worried family members asking for help
  locating people believed to be held at a center in the remote desert town of
  Adelanto. Chu had visited the facility several times during her years in
  office. But on 8 June, guards scrambled to lock the fence when she arrived
  with California congressmen Gil Cisneros and Derek Tran, she recounted. The
  trio shouted their names and held up signs identifying themselves as members
  of Congress – but they were turned away. “It was illegal, of course, because
  we have this right to go in,” Chu said in an interview. More than a week
  later, Chu and a larger delegation of California Democrats were granted access
  to the facility and were able to meet with people detained during the raids,
  including a Daca recipient. Some said they had gone days without a change of
  clothes and were, in many cases, unable to call their families or legal
  representatives. “We must keep on trying, because otherwise we don’t know what
  will happen to these detainees,” Chu said, vowing to push for more access.
  “The less attention that is being given through our oversight inspections, the
  more [DHS] thinks it can get away with the worst conditions possible.”
  Congressman Jay Obernolte, a Republican of California, came away with a
  different impression when he toured the Adelanto facility in July, days after
  Trump deployed the national guard and active duty marines to quell the
  immigration protests that had erupted across Los Angeles. In a statement, he
  said that those in custody at the facility have “access to medical care, legal
  counsel, meals, and the full rights guaranteed under federal law”. “Facilities
  like Adelanto exist to help Ice enforce our immigration laws and keep our
  communities safe,” he said. “The vast majority of detainees housed here have
  committed serious crimes in addition to being present in our country
  illegally. They are being processed quickly, fairly, and humanely.” In a
  statement, a spokesman for the private prison firm GEO Group said that the
  detention facilities it operates, like Adelanto in California and elsewhere
  across the country, provide “around-the-clock access to medical care” as well
  as “in-person and virtual legal and family visitation” in addition to other
  services. The detention centers adhered to strict federal detention standards
  on safety, food and medical care in addition to the facility’s capacity, the
  spokesman said, stating: “Simply put, our facilities are never overcrowded.”
  As Democratic officials continue to face barriers, they have started sharing
  best practices for securing access. Before visiting a facility in Eloy,
  Arizona, to check on a local restaurant owner held there in Ice custody,
  Congressman Greg Stanton consulted another member of Congress for advice. He
  brought a copy of the law that affirms members’ oversight rights and asked to
  speak with senior officials on site. Still, he was refused entry. “I think
  others feel the same way I do, which is, you don’t get to pick and choose
  which laws you follow,” Stanton said. “And it may be inconvenient to have a
  member of Congress show up and try to do their duty of oversight, but that
  doesn’t matter. This is what the law says, and you’ve got to follow the law.”
  Brian Todd, a spokesman for the private prison contractor CoreCivic, which
  operates the Eloy Detention Center, said that while the company endeavors to
  be “as accommodating and transparent as possible,” all congressional visits
  must be coordinated through Ice’s office of congressional relations. He also
  said that the facilities were closely monitored by federal observers to ensure
  compliance and said claims of poor food or water quality at the center were
  “patently false”. “We know this is a highly charged, emotional issue for many
  people,” Todd said, “but the fact is we operate safe, secure facilities that
  provide high quality services for our government partners at Ice”. Crow, the
  Colorado congressman, began inspections of a privately operated immigration
  facility outside Denver in 2019, following repeated community reports about
  poor conditions, disease outbreaks, access to medical care and poor food
  storage. “I represent a lot of immigrants and refugees, and frequently we’re
  dealing with their families or with constituents and checking on individual
  conditions or access to counsel for residents of our district,” he said. At
  first, access was limited – prompting his push to strengthen protections for
  members of Congress. He eventually created a toolkit complete with a template
  for oversight visits, which he now shares with other members of Congress.
  “There are egregious abuses occurring on a daily basis around the country,
  everything from unmarked vans with masked agents jumping out and grabbing
  people … to the lack of access to legal counsel and a variety of abuses,” he
  said. “So that’s what we’re worried about. And clearly this administration
  wants to hide their activities.” McIver, whose charges stem from an attempt to
  shield Newark mayor Ras Baraka from arrest during a protest at the facility,
  said she still has a right to conduct oversight visits – she remains a member
  of Congress and serves on a homeland security committee. But with a serious
  legal case pending, she has opted not to return – for now. “They’re using me
  as an example to try to be as cruel as possible to me and humiliate me and
  intimidate me, hoping that that will carry over to other people,” she said.
  Despite the risks, other Democratic members of Congress are still showing up –
  even when doors are slammed in their faces – because, as McIver put it, “it’s
  their job”. “They’re not stopping.”
