  Sweeteners found in yoghurts and fizzy drinks can damage people’s ability to
  think and remember, and appear to cause “long-term harm” to health, research
  has found. People who consumed the largest amount of sweeteners such as
  aspartame and saccharin saw a 62% faster decline in their cognitive powers –
  the equivalent to their having aged 1.6 years, researchers say. They
  concluded: “Our findings suggest the possibility of long-term harm from low-
  and no-calorie sweeteners (LNCs) consumption, particularly artificial LNCs and
  sugar alcohols, on cognitive function.” The findings are the latest to warn
  about the dangers posed by sweeteners. Previous studies have suggested they
  may increase the risk of a range of diseases including type 2 diabetes,
  cancer, heart problems, depression and dementia, and damage the gut wall.
  Sweeteners’ association with cognitive decline is of such concern that
  consumers should instead use either tagatose, a natural sweetener, or
  alternatives such as honey or maple syrup, the researchers said. They looked
  at the impact of seven sweeteners on the health of the study’s participants –
  12,772 civil servants in Brazil, with an average age of 52 – who were followed
  up for on average eight years. Participants completed questionnaires detailing
  their food and drink intake over the previous year, and later underwent tests
  of their cognitive skills such as verbal fluency and word recall. People who
  consumed the most sweeteners experienced declines in their thinking and memory
  skills 62% faster than those with the lowest intake, the researchers found.
  This was “the equivalent of about 1.6 years of ageing”, the researchers said.
  Consumption of combined and individual LNCs, particularly aspartame,
  saccharin, acesulfame K, erythritol, sorbitol and xylitol, was associated with
  cognitive loss. “Daily consumption of LNCs was associated with accelerated
  decline in memory, verbal fluency and global cognition,” the authors say in
  their paper, published in the American medical journal Neurology. However, the
  trend was only observed in participants under the age of 60. That shows that
  middle-aged adults need to be encouraged to use fewer sweeteners, they added.
  The sweeteners studied are also found in flavoured water, low-calorie desserts
  and energy drinks. “Low and no-calorie sweeteners are often seen as a healthy
  alternative to sugar. However, our findings suggest certain sweeteners may
  have negative effects on brain health over time,” said Claudia Kimie Suemoto,
  of the University of São Paulo in Brazil, the study’s lead author. Food and
  drink industry bodies cast doubt on the findings. “By the authors’ own
  admission, this study cannot prove cause,” said Gavin Partington, the director
  general of the British Soft Drinks Association. “Non-sugar sweeteners are
  safe, according to all leading health authorities in the world, and that’s why
  they have been used in a vast array of food, medicine, dental and drinks
  products for many decades. “Their use in soft drinks has helped UK
  manufacturers to remove just under three-quarters of a billion kilograms of
  sugar from product since 2015.” The International Sweeteners Association (ISA)
  said there was an “established scientific consensus” that sweeteners are safe.
  “This research is an observational study, which can only show a statistical
  association, not a direct cause-and-effect relationship,” the ISA said in a
  statement. “The reported link between sweetener consumption and cognitive
  decline does not prove that one causes the other.”
