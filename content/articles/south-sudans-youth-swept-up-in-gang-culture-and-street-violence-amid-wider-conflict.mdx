  In June, a video of a gang-rape started circulating online in South Sudan.
  Filmed and posted on social media by the perpetrators, it showed a gang of
  visibly intoxicated young men taking turns to sexually assault a 16-year-old
  girl in a murky room in the Sherikat neighbourhood of the country’s capital,
  Juba. Later, it emerged that the victim belonged to a rival gang, and that the
  rape and the video were an act of revenge. The rape prompted widespread
  outrage. Some called for mob justice; others for the perpetrators to be
  apprehended and sentenced to death. There was a city-wide crackdown on gangs
  and within weeks the authorities announced that more than 600 youths had been
  arrested, although more than half were later released without charge. For
  former gang members Peter Amule and Alaak Akuei, now on the frontline of
  trying to stem the flow of gang violence in South Sudan, it was a depressingly
  familiar, and failed, response to a deeper issue. Peter Amule, a former gang
  member, centre, with some of the youths he is trying to help “You can’t stop
  this gang stuff by force; you need to use love, and to remind them about God,”
  says Amule, 35. Akuei, 24, who has set up a football academy in Sherikat, was
  dismayed by the attack. “I was very disappointed and I felt discouraged
  because these boys, we are working with them, we know some of them, but they
  are not listening. But we have to be strong, because we cannot give up.”
  Street gangs have proliferated since South Sudan’s independence in 2011 and
  the five-year civil war that followed. Thefts of handbags or phones by teenage
  boys on speeding bodas, the small motorcycles common in east Africa, have
  become commonplace across the country, especially in Juba, and it is not
  unusual to see street battles involving knives and machetes between rival
  crews. But families say young people with no criminal links were caught up in
  the police crackdown, and parents were reported to be unable to locate their
  children at detention facilities, as allegations surfaced of forced
  conscription into the South Sudan People’s Defence Forces, the government army
  that is at war with rebel forces in parts of the country. Since March,
  fighting has been particularly intense in the north-eastern region of Upper
  Nile, leading to the house arrest of Riek Machar, first vice-president, in
  Juba. Machar, with President Salva Kiir, was the main signatory of the 2018
  peace deal, which the UN says has nearly collapsed. During a plenary session
  of the national parliament on 28 July, Samuel Buhari Loti, an MP from Eastern
  Equatoria state, expressed alarm that the “so-called crackdown … has gone
  beyond gangs”. “Now, our young people are being harassed, arrested, and some
  even killed. Many are disappearing … and later appear in Malakal [capital of
  Upper Nile] as soldiers,” he says. “This is deeply troubling.” Edmund Yakani,
  executive director of Community Empowerment for Progress Organisation (Cepo),
  a leading South Sudanese civil society organisation, says he has been
  contacted by numerous families looking for their sons. “Information is coming
  out that some of them are children and have died in the army barracks in
  Malakal,” he says. On 1 August, Machar’s opposition movement, the Sudan
  People’s Liberation Movement-in-Opposition (SPLA-IO), released a video of
  teenagers addressing the camera in various South Sudanese languages. Filmed at
  an undisclosed location controlled by the opposition in Nyirol county, in the
  north of Jonglei state, the boys describe how they were taken from Juba to
  Malakal after being arrested and put in jail. In a message accompanying the
  video, a SPLA-IO spokesperson, Lam Paul Gabriel, called on the International
  Committee of the Red Cross, the UN children’s fund Unicef and the UN mission
  in South Sudan (UNMISS) “to help reunite these young boys with their families
  in Juba”. Authorities have publicly denied the allegations and did not respond
  to a request for comment. *** In Juba’s Gudele neighbourhood, the yard of
  Amule’s home has become a meeting point for teenagers and social workers from
  Grassroots Empowerment and Development Organization (Gredo), an NGO supported
  by Unicef. Peter Amule, a former gang member who now tries to help youths
  break free of gangs, with pigeons he raises behind his house in Gudele A dozen
  boys aged 15 to 20 sit in the shade of a small mango tree. All ended up in
  gangs due to similar circumstances: a lack of money led them to drop out of
  school and join a gang to start stealing. Once they were part of a gang, fear
  for their own safety and involvement in violence make it very difficult to
  leave. Children play dominoes at the Gredo youth centre in Sherikat, which is
  a refuge in an area dominated by two gangs “For you to leave a gang, there are
  conditions,” Amule explains. He left in 2016, after 14 years of gang life. “In
  my case, I had to buy [the leader] a motorcycle so they could set me free.
  “You take a lot of drugs, and when you do so, you won’t even care about your
  own mother, because these drugs mess up your mind. You have no limits.” Sakaya
  Peter, a youth worker at Gredo, says: ‘Most of these children come from
  traumatised families’ Sherikat, the Juba suburb where the girl was raped, is
  divided into two territories controlled by two main gangs: Hip Hop Riders and
  West Coast. In 2021 Gredo opened a youth centre on the border between the two
  areas. Today, it has about 150 members. Decades of war have taken a heavy toll
  on South Sudanese families, says Gredo’s Sakaya Peter. “Most of these children
  come from traumatised families. Their fathers are soldiers, and they’re either
  dead or absent because they’re deployed far away. “Some have already run away
  and are living on the street. Others are experiencing a lot of abuse at home,
  so they come here to find people they can speak to,” he says. Recruiting
  former street children, ex-gang members or survivors of sexual violence to
  work with young people is key to the centre’s approach. “The most important
  part is the emotional connection they establish with the youths, which allows
  for change to take place,” says Peter. The choir at Gredo’s youth centre

  do’ Akuei, known as Kuku, joined a gang when he was 13. “In the gang, we had
  different activities, but for me I was a fighter,” he says. “It was like a
  war, but we couldn’t really tell why we were fighting the other groups.” In
  2018, at 18, he was able to pay off the leaders and he set up the Young Dream
  Football Academy. Alaak ‘Kuku’ Akuei is a 24-year-old former gang member who
  founded the Young Dream Football Academy in Sherikat. ‘These kids, all they
  want is to feel loved and that they belong,’ he says Today, Akuei trains more
  than 900 children, and has recruited other ex-gang members to coach them. “We
  need to engage them so that they’ll be busy and they focus on education.
