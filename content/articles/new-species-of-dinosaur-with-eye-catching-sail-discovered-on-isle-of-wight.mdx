  Scientists have discovered a new species of dinosaur with an “eye-catching
  sail” along its back and tail that may have been used to attract mates. The
  iguanodontian dinosaur, whose fossils were found on the Isle of Wight, was
  identified by Dr Jeremy Lockwood, a PhD student at the University of
  Portsmouth and the Natural History Museum. The retired GP has named it
  Istiorachis macarthurae, a mix of “sail spine” and a reference to Ellen
  MacArthur, who set a world record for the fastest solo non-stop sailing voyage
  around the world in 2005. Prior to Lockwood’s analysis, the fossils, which
  date back 125m years, were assumed to have belonged to one of the two known
  dinosaur species from the Isle of Wight. But after comparing the preserved
  bones with a database of similar dinosaur back bones, it became clear the
  fossil was unique. Lockwood said: “While the skeleton wasn’t as complete as
  some of the others that have been found, no one had really taken a close look
  at these bones before … unlike the others, this one had particularly long
  neural spines, which was very unusual.” He said the animal would probably have
  had a pronounced sail-like structure along its back. “Evolution sometimes
  seems to favour the extravagant over the practical. While the exact purpose of
  such features has long been debated – with theories ranging from body heat
  regulation to fat storage – researchers believe that the most likely
  explanation in this case is visual signalling, possibly as part of a sexual
  display to attract a mate. “In modern reptiles, sail structures often show up
  more prominently in males, suggesting that these attributes evolved to impress
  mates or intimidate rivals. We think Istiorachis may have been doing much the
  same.” Prof Susannah Maidment, of the Natural History Museum, said: “Jeremy’s
  careful study of fossils that have been in museum collections for several
  years has brought to life the iguandontian dinosaurs of the Isle of Wight.
  “His work highlights the importance of collections like those at Dinosaur
  Isle, where fossil specimens are preserved in perpetuity and can be studied
  and revised in the light of new data and new ideas about evolution.” • This
