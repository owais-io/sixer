  The Conservative party will aim to “maximise extraction” of oil and gas in the
  North Sea if it wins power, Kemi Badenoch is expected to announce. Badenoch
  will use a speech in Aberdeen in the coming days to set out her plans to
  extract as much oil and gas as possible instead of shifting away from fossil
  fuels, the Sunday Telegraph reported. She will announce the Tories plan to
  overhaul the North Sea Transition Authority, which oversees the issuing of
  licences, dropping the word transition and replacing its 12-page mandate with
  a simple order to extract the maximum possible amount of fossil fuel. Badenoch
  said Britain “cannot afford not to be doing everything to get hydrocarbons out
  the ground” to boost growth. She said: “We are in the absurd situation where
  our country is leaving vital resources untapped while neighbours such as
  Norway extract them from the same seabed. “Britain has already decarbonised
  more than every other major economy since 1990, yet we face some of the
  highest energy prices in the developed world. “This is not sustainable and it
  cannot continue. That is why I am calling time on this unilateral act of
  economic disarmament and Labour’s impossible ideology of net zero by 2050.
  “So, a future Conservative government will scrap all mandates for the North
  Sea beyond maximising extraction. “It is time that common sense, economic
  growth and our national interest came first, and only the Conservatives will
  deliver that. We are going to get all our oil and gas out of the North Sea.”
  Last month, the energy and net zero secretary, Ed Miliband, accused the
  Conservatives of being “anti-science” by abandoning a political consensus on
  net zero. In the first of what is promised to be an annual “state of the
  climate” report, the Labour MP set out the findings of a Met Office-led study
  that detailed how the UK was already hotter and wetter, and faced a greater
  number of extreme weather events. Miliband quoted the former prime minister
  Theresa May, who put net zero targets into law in 2019 and had argued that the
  real climate zealots were “populists who offer only easy answers to complex
  questions”. He added: “I couldn’t put it better myself.”
