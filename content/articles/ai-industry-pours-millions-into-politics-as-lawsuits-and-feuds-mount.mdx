  Hello, and welcome to TechScape. A little over two years ago, OpenAI’s founder
  Sam Altman stood in front of lawmakers at a congressional hearing and asked
  them for stronger regulations on artificial intelligence. The technology was
  “risky” and “could cause significant harm to the world”, Altman said, calling
  for the creation of a new regulatory agency to address AI safety. Altman and
  the AI industry are promoting a very different message today. The AI they once
  framed as an existential threat to humanity is now key to maintaining American
  prosperity and hegemony. Regulations that were once a necessity are now
  criticized as a hindrance that will weaken the US and embolden its
  adversaries. Whether or not the AI industry ever truly wanted government
  oversight is debatable, but what has become clear over the past year is that
  they are willing to spend exorbitant sums of money to make sure any regulation
  that does exist happens on their terms. There has been a surge in AI lobbying
  and political action committees from the industry, with a report last week
  from the Wall Street Journal that Silicon Valley plans to pour $100m into a
  network of organizations opposing AI regulation ahead of next year’s midterm
  elections. One of the biggest efforts to sway candidates in favor of AI will
  be a Super Pac called Leading Our Future, which is backed by OpenAI president
  Greg Brockman and venture capitalist firm Andreessen Horowitz. The group is
  planning bipartisan spending on candidates and running digital candidates in
  key states for AI policy including New York, Illinois and California,
  according to the Wall Street Journal. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and
  Instagram, is also forming its own Super Pac targeted specifically at opposing
  AI regulation in its home state of California. The Meta California Pac will
  spend tens of millions on elections in the state, which is holding its
  governor’s race in 2026. The new Super Pacs are an escalation of the AI
  industry’s already hefty spending to influence government policy on the
  technology. Big AI firms have ramped up their lobbying – OpenAI spent roughly
  $620,000 on lobbying in the second quarter of this year alone – in an effort
  to push back against calls for regulation. OpenAI rival Anthropic meanwhile
  spent $910,000 on lobbying in Q2, Politico reported, up from $150,000 during
  the same period last year. The spending blitz comes as the benefits promised
  by AI companies have yet to fully materialize and the harms associated with
  the technology are increasingly clear. A recent study from MIT showed that 95%
  of companies they studied received no return on investment from their
  generative AI programs, while another study this month from Stanford
  researchers found AI was severely hurting young workers’ job prospects.
  Meanwhile, the concern around AI’s impact on mental health was back in the
  spotlight this past week after the parents of a teenager who died by suicide
  filed a lawsuit against OpenAI blaming the company’s chatbot for their son’s
  death. Despite the public safety, labor, and environmental concerns
  surrounding AI, the industry may not have to work too hard to find a
  sympathetic ear in Washington. The Trump administration, which already has
  extensive ties to the tech industry, has suggested that it is determined to
  become the world’s dominant AI power at any cost. “We can’t stop it. We can’t
  stop it with politics,” Trump said last month in a speech about winning the AI
  race. “We can’t stop it with foolish rules”. OpenAI faces its first wrongful
  death lawsuit The parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine are suing OpenAI in a
  wrongful death case after their son died by suicide. The lawsuit alleges that
  Raine talked extensively with ChatGPT about his suicidal ideations and even
  uploaded a picture of a noose, but the chatbot failed to deter the teenager or
  stop communicating with him. The family alleges this is not an edge-case but
  an inherent flaw in the way the system was designed. In a conversation with
  the Guardian, Jay Edelson, one of the attorneys representing the Raine family
  said that OpenAI’s response was acknowledgment that the company knew GPT-4o,
  the version of ChatGPT Raine was using, was broken. The family’s case hinges
  on the claim, based on previous media reporting, that OpenAI rushed the
  release of GPT-4o and sacrificed safety testing to meet that launch date.
  Without that safety testing, the company did not catch certain contradictions
  in the way the system was designed, the family’s lawsuit claims. So instead of
  terminating the conversation with the teenager once he started talking about
  harming himself, GPT-4o provided an empathetic ear, at one point discouraging
  him from talking to his family about his pain. The lawsuit is the first
  wrongful death case against OpenAI, which announced last week it would change
  the way its chatbot responds to users in mental distress. The company said in
  a statement to the New York Times that it was “deeply saddened” by Raine’s
  death and suggested that ChatGPT’s safeguards become less reliable over the
  course of long conversations. Concerns over suicide prevention and harmful
  relationships with chatbots have existed for years, but the widespread
  adoption of the technology has intensified calls from watchdog groups for
  better safety guardrails. In another case from this year, a cognitively
  impaired 76-year-old man from New Jersey died after attempting to travel to
  New York City to meet a Meta chatbot persona called “Big sis Billie” that had
  been flirtatiously communicating with him. The chatbot had repeatedly told the
  man that it was a real woman and encouraged the trip. Read our coverage of the
  lawsuit here. Elon Musk sues Apple and OpenAI claiming a conspiracy Elon
  Musk’s artificial intelligence startup xAI sued Apple and OpenAI this week,
  accusing them of collaborating to monopolize the AI chatbot market and
  unfairly exclude rivals like his company’s Grok. Musk’s company is seeking to
  recover billions in damages, while throwing a wrench in the partnership that
  Apple and OpenAI announced last year to great fanfare. Musk’s lawsuit accuses
  the two companies of “a conspiracy to monopolize the markets for smartphones
  and generative AI chatbots” and follows legal threats he made earlier this
  month over accusation that Apple’s app store was favoring ChatGPT above other
  AI alternatives. OpenAI rejected Musk’s claims and characterized the suit as
  evidence of the billionaire’s malicious campaign against the company. “This
  latest filing is consistent with Mr Musk’s ongoing pattern of harassment,” an
  OpenAI spokesperson said. As the Guardian’s coverage of the case detailed, the
  legal drama is yet another chapter in the long, contentious relationship
  between Musk and Altman: The lawsuit is the latest front in the ongoing feud
  between Musk and Altman. The two tech billionaires founded OpenAI together in
  2015, but have since had an increasingly public falling out which has
  frequently turned litigious. Musk left OpenAI after proposing to take over the
  company in 2018, and has since filed multiple lawsuits against the company
  over its plans to shift into a for-profit enterprise. Altman and OpenAI have
  rejected Musk’s criticisms and framed him as a petty, vindictive former
  partner. Read the full story about Musk’s suit against OpenAI and Apple.
