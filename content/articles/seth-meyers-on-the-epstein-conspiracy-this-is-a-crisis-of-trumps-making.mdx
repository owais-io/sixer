  Late-night hosts discussed the ongoing Jeffrey Epstein scandal and the “spite”
  behind Donald Trump’s impending tariffs. Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth
  Meyers spoke about the theories circulating over the death of Epstein, spurred
  on by the alleged missing minute from his jail cell video on the night of his
  death. He said that Trump is not in the right place to be handling it, as he’s
  “old” and “tired” and just came back from a golfing vacation in Scotland.
  While there, he opened a private new golf course, which was on the official
  White House live stream. “They’re not even pretending any more, there’s no
  separation,” Meyers said. Trump is “tired from all his golfing and
  self-enrichment” and was recently seen trying not to fall asleep during a
  press briefing with Mehmet Oz. “Imagine if Joe Biden did this,” he said.
  Meyers added that “he can’t hear or understand reporters’ questions any more”
  before playing footage of him getting confused over a recent question about
  Russia. Trump has been asked why he cut ties with Epstein and recently said he
  didn’t want to waste people’s time by going through the details. “Please, my
  man, waste our time!” Meyers said. He then “dug the hole even deeper” and
  “made it so much worse” by rambling on about Epstein stealing workers from his
  spa, which he said was one of the best spas in the world. “Stop talking about
  the spa – is it your safe word?” Meyers asked. But it’s “not just Trump who
  keeps digging a hole for himself”, there’s also Dan Bongino, an
  Epstein-obsessed podcaster who is now the deputy director of the FBI. Despite
  him claiming that the full, unedited tape would be released, experts have said
  that while it might be “unclear how much time is missing”, this isn’t the full
  tape after all. “This whole thing is a crisis of Trump’s making,” he said.
  Stephen Colbert On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert reminded viewers that it was
  the last day of July, which means that the “basket of deplorable tariffs are
  gonna kick in” the day after. Trump had originally claimed he had made 200
  deals ready for 1 August but “on the other hand, no he didn’t”, with just
  eight in place before the deadline. Colbert said that “his demands are insane”
  and many of the countries are included “just for spite”. This week also saw
  him revive the presidential fitness test for American schoolchildren so they
  could be “as fit as President Trump”. It had originally been retired in 2012
  for a switch to a focus on individual health rather than athletic feats. Trump
  signed the executive order flanked by athletes, including former NFL star
  Lawrence Taylor, who is a registered sex offender. Colbert called it “a
  brilliant way to distance yourself from the whole Epstein scandal”. This week
  also saw lawyer Alan Dershowitz, known for clients such as OJ Simpson, Harvey
  Weinstein and Trump, make further complaints about how he is shunned while in
  Martha’s Vineyard. He had previously complained that his politics had made him
  a social pariah, but now he is suing a vendor who refused to serve him
  pierogi. He was later seen speaking to a police officer about the incident.
  “They have bigger crimes to investigate, like someone’s houseguest bringing a
  domestic chardonnay,” Colbert quipped.
