  OpenAI is reportedly in early talks about a sale of shares held by current and
  former employees that would value it at half a trillion dollars, overtaking
  Elon Musk’s SpaceX. If the transaction goes ahead, the value of the ChatGPT
  developer would rise by about two-thirds, from $300bn (£225bn). Musk’s rocket
  companyis currently worth $350bn and is reportedly circling a $400bn price tag
  in a new fundraising. Bloomberg, which first reported the OpenAI talks, said
  existing investors, including Thrive Capital, have approached the company
  about buying employee shares. Other investors in OpenAI, which is based in San
  Francisco, include the Japanese investment company SoftBank, which led the
  $300bn financing, and Microsoft. OpenAI and Thrive Capital declined to comment
  Tech startups are known to arrange employee share sales to motivate staff and
  bring in investors. OpenAI is also under competitive pressure from Mark
  Zuckerberg’s Meta to retain leading staff members, with a share sale possibly
  offering an incentive to stay. The Facebook parent has poached staff from
  OpenAI and others in a hiring drive to build an AI “superintelligence” unit.
  OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman, has said Meta had taken “none of our
  best people” despite offering “crazy” signing bonuses of $100m (£74m).
  Anthropic, another rival, founded by former OpenAI employees, is reportedly in
  negotiations for a fundraising valuing the business at $170bn. Fundraising is
  a continuing requirement for AI startups as they seek finance to train the
  increasingly sophisticated models that power their products, a process that
  involves using expensive computer chips and data centre capacity. The report
  comes as Altman indicated that OpenAI was preparing to release an upgraded
  version of the model powering ChatGPT. On Sunday he shared a screenshot of
  what appeared to be the company’s latest AI model, GPT-5. OpenAI also launched
  two new open models on Tuesday, meaning they can be downloaded freely and
  customised, in a competitive challenge to Meta and China’s DeepSeek, which
  have also launched open AI models. “We’re excited to make this model, the
  result of billions of dollars of research, available to the world to get AI
  into the hands of the most people possible,” said Altman. However, OpenAI’s
  main business is based on “closed” models, whose inner workings cannot be
  accessed, and it charges for subscriptions for enhanced versions of ChatGPT or
  for integrating its models into businesses. OpenAI, which is structured as a
  non-profit entity with a profit-making arm, is in talks to become a for-profit
  business, with the long-running negotiations yet to conclude amid reports of
  wrangling with Microsoft. Speaking to the New York Times podcast in June,
  Altman said of the Microsoft relationship: “Obviously in any deep partnership
  there are points of tension, and we certainly have those. But on the whole
  it’s been like really wonderfully good for both companies.” In March a US
  judge denied Musk’s request for a preliminary injunction to pause OpenAI’s
  transition to a for-profit model. Musk, the world’s richest person, was a
  co-founder of OpenAI and left the company in 2019 – but has accused the
  startup of straying from its founding mission to develop artificial
  intelligence for the good of humanity, rather than for corporate profit.
  OpenAI is also pushing into hardware after buying a startup, io, owned by the
  iPhone designer Sir Jony Ive in a $6.4bn deal. Altman reportedly told
  employees that OpenAI planned to build 100m AI “companions” that would be part
  of users’ everyday life. Mass production of the unnamed io gadget is not
  expected to start until 2027, although Altman has described a prototype as
  “the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen”.
