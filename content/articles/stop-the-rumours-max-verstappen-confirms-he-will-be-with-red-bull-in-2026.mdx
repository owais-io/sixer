  Max Verstappen has moved to end speculation linking him with a switch to
  Mercedes next season by stating he will remain a Red Bull driver in 2026.
  However, the world champion did not confirm he would see out the rest of his
  contract with Red Bull that runs until 2028. Verstappen was known to have been
  involved in talks with the Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, who has made
  no secret of his desire to persuade the four-time world champion to join the
  Silver Arrows, and Verstappen’s future has been under immense scrutiny of
  late. At this weekend’s Hungarian Grand Prix, the Dutchman unequivocally
  declared his immediate future would be at Red Bull. “It’s quite interesting to
  follow all that [speculation] and the amount of nice stories that came out of
  it,” he said. “But I’ve never really said anything about it because I was just
  focused on talking to the team about how we can improve our performance,
  future ideas for next year as well. “But it’s time to stop all the rumours and
  I’ve always been quite clear that I was staying anyway. That was also the
  general feeling in the team because we were always in discussions about what
  we could do with the car. When you’re not interested in staying then you also
  stop talking about these kinds of things and I never did.” Verstappen has been
  dissatisfied with the fall in performance Red Bull have experienced in the
  past 18 months. He managed to convert an early lead last season into his
  fourth title, but the expected improvement over the winter failed to
  materialise and Red Bull have been left behind by a dominant McLaren. A number
  of new regulations come into play next season, including a radical engine
  change. It could represent a reset of form across the grid, with Red Bull
  taking a major step into the unknown by building their own power units for the
  first time. Notably, Verstappen declined to say he would see out his contract
  beyond 2026, when he would have a better idea who had made the best
  interpretation of the new regulations. When asked if he could expect
  speculation about his future again next year, he said: “If you ask me that
  question next year, then yes,” he said. “I never speak about it. Because I’m
  more interested in just working on the performance of things. That’s why I
  also never really talk about what is in my contract.” It is understood
  Verstappen had an exit clause in his contract that allowed him to leave if he
  was outside the top three at the summer break this season. After finishing
  fourth in Spa and with 28 points in hand over fourth-placed George Russell he
  cannot meet that criterion when the break begins after the Hungarian Grand
  Prix. Verstappen has long since conceded his shot at the title has gone and
  has made clear his displeasure at his car’s shortcomings. Three weeks ago,
  immediately after the British GP, Red Bull dismissed Christian Horner, their
  team principal of 20 years, in what was seen as the final move in a
  longstanding power struggle between Horner and Red Bull’s parent company, Red
  Bull GmbH. Horner was replaced by the former Racing Bulls team principal
  Laurent Mekies. Keeping Verstappen at the team was considered a key factor in
  the change instigated by management and this week the Red Bull head of
  motorsport, Helmut Marko, noted that the lack of performance had been central
  to the reasons behind Horner being removed “It was the result of various
  factors but primarily performance was not quite where it should be,” said
  Marko. “Luckily, we were able to bring in Laurent Mekies from within the Red
  Bull family. His role will be significantly more focused – primarily on
  racing.” The latter a pointed note, an indication that with Horner’s role as
  team principal and CEO there was a belief he had perhaps lost focus on what
  Verstappen considered the most important task: delivering a quick car. That
  Verstappen has finally publicly confirmed he will remain with the team may be
  interpreted by many as a vindication of the removal of Horner, despite the
  upheaval it caused. The internal wrangling certainly has been brought to a
  close and Verstappen declared himself happy with his new boss. “Of course,
  it’s still very early days, but I do like how Laurent is working,” he said.
  “Very motivated, constantly asking the right questions to me, but also to the
  team. It’s nice to see.” Meanwhile, Russell, whose place at Mercedes had been
  considered at risk had Verstappen jumped ship, is believed to be close to
  finalising his new contract with the team. “Conversations have started, we are
  now heading into the summer break,” he said. When asked if it was now only a
  question of how his contract would look, the British driver replied: “Yes, I
  guess so”.
