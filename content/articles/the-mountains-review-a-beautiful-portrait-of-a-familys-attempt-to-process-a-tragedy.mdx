  tragedy

  In his debut feature, Christian Einshøj tends to the hidden wounds of family
  by rewinding to the past. Originally from Denmark, he spent his childhood in
  Norway with his parents and two brothers, Frederick and Kristoffer. The
  relocation was supposed to be temporary. Tragedy, however, struck:
  Kristofferbecame ill with a terminal condition and his death cast a dark
  shadow over a once tightly-knit household. Einshøj’s parents were had another
  son, Alex, but they would never return to Denmark to live as a family again.
  Through voiceover, Einshøj recalls this painful history with profound
  introspection, as well as humour. Grainy home videos, largely shot by
  Einshøj’s father, Søren, resurface, but while Søren used his camera to
  preserve Kristoffer’s memories before his death, Einshøj turns to film-making
  as a means of reconciliation. Unable to process Kristoffer’s death, Søren
  retreats into the numbing grind of work. Meanwhile, Einshøj has grown apart
  from his surviving siblings, both of whom experience periods of depression as
  a result of their shared trauma. It is perhaps due to the confessional nature
  of Einshøj’s project that, after years of silence, the brothers finally open
  up to one another about their deepest fears and anxieties. At times, the
  documentary has the freewheeling charm of a road movie, with Einshøj embarking
  on various journeys to bring his scattered family together. In one
  particularly touching sequence, filled with the deadpan humour of Einshøj’s
  narration, the three brothers, now adults, dress up in superhero costumes.
  Behind them is the majestic mountain range of their childhood home; with the
  young men now standing shoulder to shoulder, a beautiful picture of love and
  unity emerges from the heartaches of yesterday. • The Mountains is on True
