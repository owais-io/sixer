  My husband and I never have sex at home, only at our friends’ places or in
  hotel rooms. We’ve lived together, improbably, for four years now. When we
  hooked up six years ago I never expected anything serious, just a one-night
  stand with a hot flight attendant. After 15 casual sexual encounters we had a
  screaming row about my sleeping with someone else, and after the 16th, we
  decided to be in an exclusive relationship. After 40 meet-ups, he brought home
  an exotic strain of gonorrhoea; when we had got over the shock, and finished a
  course of antibiotics, we started planning the wedding. It took us a while to
  find the right place to live together and we stayed with friends for the first
  three months. We had an incredible amount of sex during that time, of which he
  was nearly always the instigator – using words such as “she’s out for milk –
  let’s gooooo”. We kept this up for the first few months in our own home, but
  gradually we ended up just cuddling in our shared bed, and, after a few
  rejected attempts on my part to spice things up a bit, I settled for just
  that. He admitted once (when I tried to have sex with him on the kitchen
  floor) that my furniture was too “me”, it intruded on his mind – he preferred
  anonymous spaces. And, truly, when we’re not home, suddenly it’s all fireworks
  again: in a friend’s guest room during a dinner party, in countless hotels,
  and a few times in very public situations that I still feel anxious about. I
  do love the excitement – but I’m feeling increasingly manipulated. My husband
  is the “bottom”, and he’s always ready when he decides we’re doing it. I feel
  as if he’s treating me like his dirty secret, and that makes me worry about
  what he’s getting up to in all those foreign hotels he’s staying in. We make
  increasing use of the blindfold and other BDSM materials, and on a recent
  hotel visit he suggested inviting up one of the waiters he’d been flirting
  with to “share” him. I don’t know if I can cope with the emotional whiplash
  for much longer. How can I get the balance back in our life? Maintaining
  heightened eroticism in a marriage is not always possible, but you two have
  achieved this, albeit fleetingly. This has happened largely because the
  contrasting nature of your lifestyles has helped you to reconnect with the
  passionate, diverse and somewhat forbidden nature of some of your most
  exciting early encounters, and has also supported the maintenance of your
  sexual individuality. Both of these aspects are known to enhance a couple’s
  erotic connection. On the one hand, they are blessings; on the other hand you
  have entered a phase of life where you crave true intimacy, while your husband
  still thrives on spontaneous, creative sex. Your contrasting sexual styles are
  both valid and legitimate, but, in the context of your long term relationship,
  some negotiation needs to occur between you to ensure that the needs of both
  of you are met. Listen to each other’s point of view and share your own
  feelings. Some couples agree to try a 50/50 split. In your case, that split
  could be between “at home” sex and sex elsewhere. But I suspect the thing that
  is bothering you the most is that, in common with many people who “top”
  exclusively, you are experiencing burnout. To make matters worse, he is
  passively controlling. This too must be discussed, and challenged in a
  non-blaming manner. Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist
  who specialises in treating sexual disorders. If you would like advice from
  Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to
  private.lives@theguardian.com (please don’t send attachments). Each week,
  Pamela chooses one problem to answer, which will be published online. She
  regrets that she cannot enter into personal correspondence. Submissions are
