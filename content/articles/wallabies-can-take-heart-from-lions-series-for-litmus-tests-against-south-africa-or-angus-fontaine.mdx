  If Australian rugby is to take a key learning from the British &amp; Irish
  Lions tour and adopt a credo for the upcoming Rugby Championship and the road
  to the 2027 World Cup, Will Skelton nailed it at half-time on Saturday: “We
  don’t take no itshay.” The 203cm, 145kg colossus’s performance was as big as
  he was in the Wallabies’ stirring victory in Sydney. But Skelton’s fighting
  words to his team – “Keep fighting. Keep fighting for each other. Keep
  fighting for the jersey” – and the pig Latin catchcry that followed was a
  crudity that offered perfect clarity to Joe Schmidt’s team. By taking no shit
  from the Lions – showing aggression, attacking from every angle, hurting their
  enemy in mind and body – Australia rattled their opposition and won
  ascendancy. Unlike in Brisbane where they found fire only when 24-5 down, or
  Melbourne where they let the initiative slip when leading 23-5, the Wallabies
  this time showed the ruthless edge fans have waited so long for, leading for
  all 80 minutes. As they set their jaws for the flight to South Africa on
  Friday and twin litmus Tests against the world champions, Australia should be
  confident of upsetting rugby’s No 1 side. The Springboks have only lightly
  tuned up for this series with two cantered victories against Italy (No 10) and
  one over Georgia (No 11). Conversely, the Wallabies are fit and full of fire
  after smashing the Lions and finding their mongrel mojo. The touring squad
  Schmidt names on Thursday must be as bold as his Sydney 23. He will be without
  his two first-pick fly halves, with young Tom Lynagh ruled out with another
  concussion after being illegally cleared out in Sydney, and Noah Lolesio out
  for the season with a neck injury sustained in the Fiji Test in July. He may
  also lose his preferred half Jake Gordon to the hamstring twinges that cost
  him an appearance in the third Test. That means the axis of attack in South
  Africa will again fall to unfamiliar alchemies being forged in the Test
  furnace. Ben Donaldson will get his chance to start at No 10, after coming off
  the bench in Brisbane and Sydney, with the veteran James O’Connor, 35, the
  likely wildcard on the pine. Nic White’s call to retire post-Sydney inspired
  his side but the little general might be needed for two last outings against
  the Springboks. Vitally, back-to-back John Eales medallist Rob Valetini will
  tour. But it is Skelton’s name that must be first on the team sheet. Without
  him and Valetini in the Lions opener in Brisbane, Australia looked timid and
  tepid. Yet in every minute Skelton was on the field in the Tests that
  followed, the Wallabies were bossing the scoreboard. Skelton neatly
  encapsulates the enigma of Australian rugby this past decade. Born in New
  Zealand to Samoan parents, he was raised in western Sydney and played rugby
  league for most of his early years before finding union in his mid-teens.
  Unlike most, he stuck at it, was brought into the Waratahs fold by his mentor
  Michael Cheika aged 21 (his second start was against the 2013 Lions) and won a
  Test debut in 2014. Skelton’s size 17s walked out on Australia in 2017. With
  Saracens in the UK and, more recently, La Rochelle in France’s Top 14, he has
  since won four European Championships. For six years, as Australian rugby hit
  the skids and their biggest stars joined the exodus overseas, Skelton existed
  as the Wallabies’ lost colossus. Not until 2021 – 1,814 days after his last
  Test – did he return to the XXXXL gold jersey. A mixed bag of international
  cameos since then has gradually roused the sleeping giant. Yet at age 33 he
  has played only 33 Tests. This fortnight has shown the power Skelton wields to
  inspire his teammates while intimidating their enemies. Now the big man is
  rolling, the juggernaut must continue. Schmidt is schmoozing Skelton to delay
  his return to France to fly on to South Africa. And Rugby Australia chiefs –
  its chief executive, Phil Waugh, and high performance boss, Peter Horne – have
  told the coach there is “no impediment to select whoever he wants” from
  Australians playing around the world. Horne says the Giteau Law – in which
  only overseas players with 60 Tests could be selected for Test duty – is
  “redundant”. The former Wallaby Quade Cooper has long reckoned, “If we want to
  compete with the world we need to select the world’s best players, regardless
  of where they play.” It is probably too late to keep three stars of the Sydney
  Test from heading abroad – Taniela Tupou is joining Racing 92 while the man of
  the match, Tom Hooper, is off to Exeter and Langi Gleeson to Montpellier – but
  after years of selecting only home-based talent and not stars plying their
  trade abroad, the gates are at last open to the barbarians. That includes
  Skelton. With him at the helm, Australia can challenge South Africa at home,
  put Argentina to the sword in Townsville and Sydney and even wrest back the
  Bledisloe Cup from New Zealand for the first time since 2002. And that’s no
  itshay.
