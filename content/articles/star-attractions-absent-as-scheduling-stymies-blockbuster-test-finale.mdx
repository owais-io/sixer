  Much like the Dude in the Big Lebowski during his various moments of
  confusion, it was impossible not to repeatedly blink upon seeing England’s XI
  for the fifth and final Test against India that starts on Thursday. Four
  changes, including the loss of Ben Stokes and Ollie Pope’s return to the
  captaincy, took a few moments to process. “I don’t want to eat my words but
  the likelihood I won’t play is very unlikely,” said Stokes after the stalemate
  at Old Trafford. While that quote needed scanning a few times, so did the
  gnarly right shoulder he was seen prodding and poking during what was a
  chastening failure to claim an unassailable 3-1 series lead. A grade-three
  tear to “a muscle I can’t pronounce” was the upshot, Stokes confirmed on
  Wednesday, and his summer is now frustratingly over. Not that some changes
  were not expected here. A series played on heartbreaking surfaces has left the
  quicks on both sides walking like a gaggle of C3POs, although Chris Woakes,
  among those to play four, will go again. It would have been cruel to deny him
  in some ways, with the Oval pitch — battleground for the spat between Gautam
  Gambhir, India’s head coach, and Lee Fortis, Surrey’s groundskeeper — the
  greenest to date. Those who have missed out may end up cursing their
  misfortune. They are Brydon Carse, tapped out after bowling 155 overs across
  four Tests, and Jofra Archer, wisely stood down after 88.3 across two on his
  comeback from major injury. And there is also no Liam Dawson, which Stokes
  insisted was more about the need for a fourth seamer rather than his Test
  return being more tight than triumphant. Spin will instead come from the
  returning Jacob Bethell and Joe Root – the less said about Harry Brook’s
  lollipop off-breaks the better – with Gus Atkinson, Josh Tongue and Jamie
  Overton the seamers joining Woakes. While the broken foot that Rishabh Pant
  suffered in Manchester was a freak occurrence, India are still undecided about
  whether to risk Jasprit Bumrah. Flagged up at the start of the tour, his
  three-Test limit was reached in Manchester and, having broken down midway
  through the Sydney Test in January – which India might otherwise have won –
  any decision not to breach it would be understandable, if not still a bit of a
  Jasprit bummer for spectators. Mohammed Siraj (139 overs) is second only to
  Woakes (167) on the over-o-meters. The question here, using a word
  administrators understand, is whether a mere four-day turnaround for such a
  blockbuster finale is good for the “product”. In one sense it will mercifully
  move things on from the handshakes-at-drawn chat that followed India’s great
  escape. But no Stokes, no Archer and possibly no Bumrah? The quality can only
  be reduced by the loss of three headliners and the weariness of those pushing
  through. Given what is on the line – England looking to win the first
  Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, with India still able to share the spoils – it is
  suboptimal. People will blame the Hundred, starting as it does next week and
  for which all decks must be apparently cleared. But while that tournament is
  one factor, inbound tours rattling along at a rate of knots has long been par
  for the course. Gone are the days of the 1993 Ashes – to pluck one example –
  when Australia arrived in April, flew home at the end of August and the
  shortest gap between Tests was nine days. But international sides have far
  more commitments in the current sardine-tin era and India’s players also came
  into this series straight after the epic that is the Indian Premier League.
  Back-to-back Tests are not a new phenomenon either. And in fairness, the
  schedulers were also not to know that a dry summer would create the
  featherbeds which have in turn pushed so many cast members into the red zone.
  (Contrary to popular belief, England have not asked for these: they just want
  pace and bounce). Nevertheless, as both captains stated before the match –
  albeit Stokes now England captain by proxy – just three days of rest does no
  one any favours. The Oval will still be full and new faces do bring some fresh
  intrigue at least. India may hand a debut to Arshdeep Singh – Anshul Kamboj
  may struggle to claim he is among those “rested” – while Atkinson’s return on
  his home ground is important for England in their final Test before the Ashes.
  And Bethell in for Stokes will inevitably be a talking point, given how
  accomplished he looked in New Zealand. Unlikely, admittedly, but if the last
  hour scenario at Old Trafford arises again in reverse, one wonders whether
  Pope will allow him to complete a first century in senior cricket. While India
  would love to end Shubman Gill’s first outing as captain with a creditable 2-2
  draw, there is also the broader picture for England. As has long been said,
  the so-called Bazball project will be defined by this series and the Ashes
  that follows. The hope now is the finale of the first leg, box office in
  theory, will not be defined by the loss of Stokes and others who fell apart en
  route.
