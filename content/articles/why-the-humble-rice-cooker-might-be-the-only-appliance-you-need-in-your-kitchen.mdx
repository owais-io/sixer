  As a chef, I often get asked what my style of cooking is. Officially, I
  specialize in Hawaii’s local food and diasporic Asian cuisines, but
  unofficially, or if you catch me on a tired day, I’ll say my style of cooking
  is “dorm room”. Which means I can make a filling, elaborate meal out of
  seemingly nothing, so long as I have a rice cooker in my arsenal. It’s my
  “desert island appliance”, the one piece of equipment I could still thrive
  with if I lost my entire kitchen. And anybody can learn the same hacks and
  shortcuts. A portable kitchen Today’s rice cookers come with sometimes dozens
  of functions, which I thoroughly tested when I rounded up 17 of them for my
  “Rice Cooker Olympics”. But the most basic rice cooker – even one with just
  the two simple functions of “cook rice” and “keep rice warm”, is an entire
  kitchen encased in a little plug-in pot. Let me explain. First, obviously, it
  cooks rice, from short-grain to sushi, jasmine to brown, and even mixed
  grains. By extension, it can also make congee, or rice porridge: the finest of
  breakfasts and the most comforting of one-bowl meals. All you have to do is
  keep adding more water, purposefully exploding rice grains into silken
  porridge. It can braise meats and tofu when it’s operating at full throttle.
  Skip the rice, add a bit of oil to the pot, and hit start to make dishes like
  mapo tofu or spiced ground beef stews. It can make fluffy, cakey Japanese
  pancakes. And don’t forget chawanmushi – that silken Japanese egg custard
  often served at the start of omakases, or chef-curated sushi meals. It steams
  quickly and beautifully in a rice cooker: as you set your rice to cook,
  halfway through the process, set a little ceramic bowl of water and egg
  scrambled together in the middle of the half cooked rice and then voila, when
  your rice is done, you also have chawanmushi. Put in whole eggs and you’ll
  have soft-boiled or hard-boiled eggs, depending on timing. Hard-boiled eggs
  take 20 minutes and soft boiled eggs take 13 to 15 minutes. You can either set
  the eggs in a steamer basket set inside your rice cooker (if your cooker comes
  with one – the Hamilton Beach one we like does, as does the Tatung), or just
  put them directly into your cooking rice. You can make soups in a rice cooker,
  rice pudding, and an infinite number of grains: quinoa, fonio, barley,
  couscous, to name just a common few. Stick vegetables in your rice cooker and
  you’ll also wind up with perfectly tender broccoli, green beans, and
  asparagus. During the cooking process, you can put them in a ceramic bowl and
  set it directly into your cooking rice, or use a steamer basket attachment.
  Rice cookers 201 I tested a lot of rice cookers for The Guardian’s list of the
  best rice cookers, and many are sophisticated devices. With added functions
  and settings come increased food options. Some of the rice cookers I tested
  can take the thinking and preparation out of complex grains such as germinated
  brown rice, which is thought to have extra nutritional value. They will soak,
  time and baby the grains over a cooking cycle of around three hours. Other
  rice cookers can pressure cook grains at high speed and they can unlock the
  complex, floral notes of even the most common, frankly boring, short-grain
  rice. They will time your congee for you, or adjust themselves to cook wild
  rice, mixed rice, sushi rice or jasmine rice. They’ll wake up just before you
  do, and make sure that the oatmeal you put in them the night prior is your
  steaming hot breakfast. Some can even sanitize themselves, steaming their
  innards at high temperatures. Modern rice cookers come with dozens of bells
  and whistles. Whether you choose the highest end Zojirushi cooker or the most
  basic Green Life one, look after it. Treat its inner liners like a nonstick
  pan and clean it by hand. And know when you’re purchasing a rice cooker,
  you’re purchasing a kitchen. Get one with a handle and it can travel with you
  anywhere.
