  My colleague Peter Walker was at the Reform UK press conference this morning.
  He has summarised some of the key lines from Richard Tice, the party’s deputy
  leader, on Bluesky. As well as defending Reform UK’s plan to pay despotic
  regimes like the Taliban’s to take back asylum seekers from Britain, Tice
  claimed that some parents with special needs children are “abusing” the system
  that allows their children to be taken by taxi to special needs schools.
  Councils in England spent more than £2bn a year on transport for special needs
  pupils, who often have to be educated in special schools quite a long way from
  where they live and who cannot travel alone on public transport. Tice implied
  some of the parents were lazy. Peter says: Reform UK say that by changing the
  way local government pension funds are invested, and the charges levied on
  this, they can save between 6% and 8% of total council tax spending, allowing
  council tax to be lowered, or social care improved. This is all very Richard
  Tice - he is hosting the press conference – and also has inevitable echoes of
  ‘£350m a week for the NHS’. I asked Tice if, given his views on climate
  change, what the Church of England thinks about refugees, and now pension
  funds, whether he has no need of experts. As part of the answer he says there
  are “widely differing views” on climate change. (Tice is right about this.
  There are differing views. Some are right, and some are wrong.) Asked if a
  Reform govt would pay money to the Taliban or Iran to return refugees, Tice
  says: “When you’re in business, sometimes you do business with people that you
  may not like.... We’re not responsible for all of the bad things that happen
  by bad leaders elsewhere in the world.” Richard Tice, asked about saving money
  on transporting SEND children to school: “There are some parents, they want to
  save themselves the opportunity to get up in the morning, set the alarm and
  crack on and drive their children to school. So they’re using it, abusing the
  free taxi service.” While some parents get free transport provided by councils
  for their Send children, many parents have to contribute, or pay the full
  costs themselves. The Conservative party has responded to the mini No 10
  reshuffle by claiming it shows the government is in crisis. In a statement
  Kevin Hollinrake, the Tory chair, said: This chaotic reshuffle shows a Downing
  Street in crisis – totally distracted from fixing the damage they’ve done to
  the economy, jobs and small businesses. It’s like firefighters arguing about
  the hose whilst the house burns down. Inflation has doubled, borrowing costs
  have soared, and Britain is on the brink of a debt crisis, with working people
  left to pay the price through higher taxes. Only the Conservatives, under new
  leadership, will take a responsible approach to the public finances and ensure
  our economy grows whilst we live within our means. And while we are talking
  about Blair-era Labour aides, Peter Hyman, who wrote speeches for Tony Blair
  and later worked for Keir Starmer in the run-up to the general election, has
  launched a new Substack blog. It is called Changing the Story, which tells you
  quite a lot about what he thinks is going wrong with No 10. Here is an extract
  from his first post. Starmer is an ‘opportunity’ prime minister forced to
  become a ‘security’ one. And that’s why the government’s narrative is seen by
  some to be elusive. Let me explain. You only have to watch Starmer engaging
  with young people involved in Lewis Hamilton’s charity to see his passion for
  aspiration and opportunity. Or hear him talk about his brother’s difficulty
  learning to see how much he cares about treating everyone with dignity …
  Starmer cares about opportunity. He embodies working class aspiration. His
  life is testimony to the belief that hard work should be rewarded. Now is a
  good time for him to break free from an overly-scripted security message that
  stifles his true calling. Back to Tim Allan (see 10.18am), and here are two
  political commentators on his appointment as the government’s new executive
  director of communications. From Steve Richards I remember well Tim Allan’s
  leaving drinks at Number 10 in the earlyish Blair era. In his fulsome farewell
  speech Tony Blair noted only half jokingly “Tim’s even more right wing than
  me..” From Philip Stephens The same Tim Allan who as head of Portland had a
  contract to polish Vladimir Putin’s reputation? The Conservatives and Reform
  UK both want the UK to withdraw from the European convention on human rights
  because they believe this would allow the government to more easily deport
  asylum seekers. The Conservatives have not formally declare this as policy
  yet, but an announcement is due at their autumn conference and Kemi Badenoch
  has made it clear where her thinking is heading. Labour has argued that this
  would undermine the Good Friday agreement, the foundation of peace in Northern
  Ireland, because ECHR membership is an integral part of that deal. Today
  Policy Exchange, a Tory thinktank, has published a report claiming that this
  argument is bogus because the protections ensured by the ECHR references in
  the agreement could be delivered in another way. It has been written by Conor
  Casey, a law lecturer, Richard Ekins, a law professor at Oxford University,
  and Sir Stephen Laws, a former head of the Office of the Parliamentary
  Counsel, the government department that drafts legislation. Here is an extract
  summarising their argument. The Belfast agreement is made up of two closely
  related agreements. The first is the British-Irish agreement, which is a
  treaty between the UK and Ireland. The second is the multiparty agreement,
  which is a political agreement between the British and Irish governments and
  several different political parties of Northern Ireland, an agreement that
  provides the foundation for the peace process. This political agreement turns
  in part on various commitments made by the British government and the Irish
  government. In signing the British-Irish agreement, the UK and Ireland agreed
  “to support, and where appropriate implement, the multiparty agreement”, but
  it is only the former agreement that is binding in international law. The
  British-Irish agreement does not refer to the ECHR and none of its terms
  suggest in any way that either the UK or Ireland, or both of them, were
  undertaking to remain member states of the ECHR in perpetuity … The multiparty
  agreement does include several references to the ECHR. The context of the
  multiparty agreement, which includes the troubled history of Northern Ireland
  and fears about the risks of abuse of devolved power, makes it very clear that
  these references concern the importance of the law of Northern Ireland
  imposing limits on the new assembly and on public bodies exercising devolved
  power. This report considers closely each reference to the ECHR in the
  multiparty agreement and shows that, as one would expect in view of the
  context of the agreement, each reference concerns domestic law and has nothing
  whatsoever to do with the position in international law. That is, the
  references to the ECHR in the multiparty agreement have nothing to do with the
  individual right of petition to the Strasbourg court, a right which the
  Belfast Agreement does not create or rely upon, or, more generally, with the
  UK or Ireland’s acceptance of the Strasbourg court’s jurisdiction or its
  developing jurisprudence as a matter of international law. British or Irish
  withdrawal from the ECHR would in no way undercut, breach or cut across the
  multiparty agreement. On legal/academic Bluesky, there are plenty of experts
  who disagree. This is from John Springford from the Centre for European
  Reform. It’s fascinating watching the same cycle of f%¥£ing around and finding
  out happening. Some anti-ECHR lawyers in Britain might say this [that leaving
  the ECHR won’t affect the Good Friday agreement], but Irish and EU politicians
  think differently, and politics will determine their reaction, not law alone.
  These are from George Peretz KC, chair of the Society of Labour Lawyers. I’d
  add two pretty obviously dubious claims in the PE report (read it carefully
  and you’ll see weasel words creeping in to hide the weaknesses): (1) that the
  (express) agreement to incorporate the ECHR into NI law with access to courts
  and remedies doesn’t mean “ECHR as interpreted by the ECtHR); and (2) that
  that agreement is confined to devolved bodies as opposed to the UK government
  acting in NI under NI law (when any act of the UK government in NI is of
  course under NI law). Strip those dodgy claims out and you are left with the
  point that if the UK left the ECHR, in order to comply with the GFA the ECHR
  (as interpreted by the ECtHR) would still have to apply in NI - including to
  UK government decisions and UK legislation such as immigration. That result is
  so obviously problematic as to rule it out as a practical suggestion. Further,
  the paper doesn’t deny (it can’t) that leaving the ECHR would entitle the EU
  at once to terminate Trade and Cooperation provisions of great importance to
  immigration control and fighting crime. The EU could also terminate the TCA as
  a whole. And this is from Glen O’Hara, a history professor. Shall I tell you
  what’s wrong with the Policy Exchange nonsense? Okay: I’m about the most
  conciliatory Irish unity sceptic there could possibly be among Nationalists.
  Without ECHR, I would consider the Belfast Agreement, and the compromises and
  agreements the Union rests on, as dissolved. The Reform UK press conference is
  starting now. There is a live feed here. I will post any highlights later.
  Today’s announcement about a new communications chief at No 10 (see 10.18am)
  will be seen by some as an acknowledgment that Labour has done a fairly lousy
  job of pushing back at the Reform UK/Tory attacks on its small boats record
  this summer. Frances Ryan makes this argument in her Guardian column today.
  Here is an extract. Few have made it easier for Reform to fill the void than
  [Keir] Starmer, who could have hardly done more if he had subletted Downing
  Street out to [Nigel] Farage and washed the towels. It is not that the prime
  minister hasn’t been working – last month, he disrupted his family holiday in
  Scotland to fly to Washington DC – or that he should not have had a break, of
  course, but that after pushing through the disastrous welfare bill, the entire
  government has seemingly disappeared from public view. The most pressing
  issues – immigration misinformation, far-right mobilisation, starvation in
  Gaza – have come and stayed in recent weeks with next to no input from our
  elected leaders. Ministers have been noticeably missing in action from media
  rounds, with Rachel Reeves – the most recognisable figure on the frontbench
  after Starmer – out of sight working on the autumn budget. The government in
  effect put its out-of-office on for August (“Taking time away until September.
  See you in Liverpool!”) and left the inbox to max out. And here is the full
  article. Back to small boats, and in her Commons statement this afternoon
  Yvette Cooper, the foreign secretary, will suggest that the government is
  making progress in disrupting the smuggling gangs. The Home Office says there
  were fewer small boats crossing the channel in August than in any other August
  since 2019. This statistic is less impressive than it sounds, because boats
  have got bigger over the past six years, and they are increasingly
  overcrowded. The Home Office says that is because the authorities are getting
  better at seizing boats and engines. The Home Office also says the number of
  people arriving on small boats was lower this August than in the past three
  years, “despite an identical number of crossing days as last year”. It says:
  The 55 boats to cross the channel this August is the lowest total for the
  month since 2019, when 34 boats crossed near the start of the small boats
  crisis. Since then, there were 116 small boats in August 2020, 99 in 2021, 192
  in 2022, 102 in 2023, and 75 in 2024, meaning that the number of successful
  boat crossings this August has been less than half the average of the previous
  five years (55 compared to 116.8 – 47%). The shortage of boats has also
  contributed to unprecedented levels of overcrowding. Average boat occupancy
  this August was 64.8, the highest monthly average on record, compared to an
  average of 59 over the first seven months of the year. The 3,567 arrivals in
  August 2025 compares to 4,149 last August, 5,369 in August 2023, and 8,631 in
  August 2022, which was the highest monthly total for arrivals on record. But
  overall small boat arrival numbers are still at a record level for this point
  of the year, as this Migration Watch UK graphic illustrates. Downing Street
  has also announced that Tim Allan, who worked as Alastair Campbell’s deputy in
  the early days of New Labour but who left No 10 to set up Portand, a PR
  company, is joining Keir Starmer’s team as the government’s executive director
  of communications. This is from my colleague Pippa Crerar on the move. Big
  shake up of the No 10 comms operation too. Tim Allan, an adviser to Tony Blair
  who went on to fund PR giant Portland, coming in as executive director of govt
  comms. (This is a political role separate from that of David Dinsmore who has
  been tasked with improving the civil service comms operation). James Lyons, No
  10’s director of comms for strategy, is stepping down, but Steph Driver, his
  counterpart for day-to-day comms, and who is close to Starmer, stays put,
  answering to Allan. And these are from Politico’s Anne McElvoy. A huge change
  in the arrival of Tim Allan of strategic communications weakness in govt. Also
  massively strengthens the arm of the more “New Labour” constituency close to
  PM. And gather there was unease in some quarters about how the existing number
  10 communications set up would work with an overall government head of Comms
  in David Dinsmore. That won’t be such a problem for Tim Allan. Interesting
  that it’s one Blairite in with T Allan and one out in the Downing Street pack
  shuffle as Liz Lloyd leaves. This was a waste of an experience’d hire: but
  never quite grafted on to the Starmer vibe and vice versa. So the policy jobs
  remain in the penumbra of people who have been close to KS – and the overall
  comms will be run by someone who’s default setting is to aim for the centre or
  even the right of centre. I’m not saying this will work, but it is something
  of a challenge Here is the Downing Street news release about the mini No 10
  reshuffle, including Darren Jones becoming chief secretary (minister of state)
  to the PM. Jones was chief secretary to the Treasury. (See 9.43am.) This is a
  new post. There is no obvious precedent, although Boris Johnson also decided
  to bring a minister into No 10 in a delivery/enforcer role when he made Steve
  Barclay his chief of staff. (That appointment was not generally seen as a
  success.) Keir Starmer already has a chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney. But
  McSweeney is seen as better at strategising, campaigning and electioneering
  than he is at performance management. Jones, a spreadsheet enthusiast, will
  “work collaboratively across UK government to drive forward progress in key
  policy areas, reporting directly to the prime minister”, No 10 says. Darren
  Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury, has been moved to a new senior
  role in Downing Street as Keir Starmer attempts to get a grip on delivery
  before what is likely to be a tumultuous autumn for the government, Pippa
  Crerar and Peter Walker report. Good morning. August used to be known as the
  “silly season” in newspaper offices because, with little proper news
  happening, journalists had to resort to trivia. Then we had Brexit, and the
  four-week silly season got replaced by eight years of chaos. This year there
  has been a slight reversion to the pre-2016 norm because the UK political
  debate over the summer has been entirely dominated by a debate about small
  boats and irregular migration which has not been fully rational. The claim
  that asylum seekers are posing a significant threat to public safety is
  classic xenophobic scaremongering, of the kind that has been a factor in
  British public life for centuries. (There is a good explanation of why the
  evidence does not support the scaremongering here.) But the issue isn’t
  remotely silly either. Small boat arrivals are a huge policy challenge for the
  government, because of the costs and the pressures on public services, but
  above all because the public want them to stop. And, with the summer recess
  now over and MPs returning to the Commons, this is still the top item on the
  government’s agenda. As Kiran Stacey reports, Yvette Cooper, the home
  secretary, is due to make a statement to the Commons on this topic this
  afternoon. She will cover various topics, including providing more detail on
  the government’s plan to restrict the extent to which article 8 of the
  European convention on human rights (the right to family life) can be used by
  asylum seekers to avoid deporting and giving an update on the “one in, one
  out” returns deal with France. But she will also give details of plans to
  restrict the ability of people granted asylum to bring family members to the
  UK. Kiran says: Cooper will promise to overhaul the UK’s family reunion
  policy, which allows people to bring their partners and children to the
  country once they are granted refugee status. The number of people who entered
  on such visas has risen sharply since 2022, with just over 20,000 being
  granted in the year to June 2025 – a 30% rise on the previous 12 months.
  Officials say the rise in refugee numbers is in part to blame, but they also
  believe the UK now has a more lax regime than many nearby countries after
  moves elsewhere in Europe to tighten their rules. In Denmark, for example,
  refugees must prove financial stability before being allowed to bring over
  family members. Cooper is understood to be looking at similar changes, as well
  as setting a minimum period refugees must be settled before being allowed to
  invite their families. This proposal has already been criticised by refugee
  advocates. Jon Featonby, chief policy analyst at the Refugee Council, says 90%
  of those affected will be women and children. He has posted these on Bluesky.
  The immigration white paper proposed putting in financial and language
  requirements. Financial requirements for refugees who have been stuck in the
  asylum system unable to work, and language requirements for children escaping
  war zones. This will either force families to stay split up, leaving thousands
  of women and children in extremely dangerous situations, or it forces them
  into dangerous journeys. Either way, this has terrible consequences. In the
  year to June 2025, 92% of refugee family reunion visas were given to women and
  children. More than half went to children. Two-thirds to people from Syria,
  Afghanistan, Eritrea, Iran and Sudan. It helps integration and provides a safe
  route. Family reunion should be easier, not harder. Here is the agenda for the
  day. Morning: Kemi Badenoch and James Cleverly, the shadow housing secretary,
  are on a visit to Reigate where they are due to speak to the media. 11am:
  Richard Tice, the Reform UK deputy leader, holds a press conference
  highlighting plans for councils to save money via changes to the way they
  invest their pension funds. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.
  2.30pm: Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, takes questions in the
  Commons. After 3.30pm: At least two ministerial statements are expected in the
  Commons, from Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, on the asylum system, and
  from David Lammy, the foreign secretary, on Gaza. 4pm: The full written
  judgment is due to be published explaining the court decision on Friday
  blocking the temporary injuntion saying asylum seekers should be removed from
  the Bell hotel in Epping. Afternoon: The Liberal Democrats hope to make an
  application in the Commons to the Speaker for an emergency debate on Gaza. If
  you want to contact me, please post a message below the line when comments are
  open (normally between 10am and 3pm at the moment), or message me on social
  media. I can’t read all the messages BTL, but if you put “Andrew” in a message
  aimed at me, I am more likely to see it because I search for posts containing
  that word. If you want to flag something up urgently, it is best to use social
  media. You can reach me on Bluesky at @andrewsparrowgdn.bsky.social. The
  Guardian has given up posting from its official accounts on X, but individual
  Guardian journalists are there, I still have my account, and if you message me
  there at @AndrewSparrow, I will see it and respond if necessary. I find it
  very helpful when readers point out mistakes, even minor typos. No error is
  too small to correct. And I find your questions very interesting too. I can’t
  promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can,
  either BTL or sometimes in the blog.

The Home Office also says the number of people arriving on small boats was lower this August than in the past three years, “despite an identical number of crossing days as last year”. It says: The 55 boats to cross the channel this August is the lowest total for the month since 2019, when 34 boats crossed near the start of the small boats crisis. Since then, there were 116 small boats in August 2020, 99 in 2021, 192 in 2022, 102 in 2023, and 75 in 2024, meaning that the number of successful boat crossings this August has been less than half the average of the previous five years (55 compared to 116.8 – 47%). The shortage of boats has also contributed to unprecedented levels of overcrowding. Average boat occupancy this August was 64.8, the highest monthly average on record, compared to an average of 59 over the first seven months of the year. The 3,567 arrivals in August 2025 compares to 4,149 last August, 5,369 in August 2023, and 8,631 in August 2022, which was the highest monthly total for arrivals on record. But overall small boat arrival numbers are still at a record level for this point of the year, as this Migration Watch UK graphic illustrates. Downing Street has also announced that Tim Allan, who worked as Alastair Campbell’s deputy in the early days of New Labour but who left No 10 to set up Portand, a PR company, is joining Keir Starmer’s team as the government’s executive director of communications. This is from my colleague Pippa Crerar on the move. Big shake up of the No 10 comms operation too. Tim Allan, an adviser to Tony Blair who went on to fund PR giant Portland, coming in as executive director of govt comms. (This is a political role separate from that of David Dinsmore who has been tasked with improving the civil service comms operation). James Lyons, No 10’s director of comms for strategy, is stepping down, but Steph Driver, his counterpart for day-to-day comms, and who is close to Starmer, stays put, answering to Allan. And these are from Politico’s Anne McElvoy. A huge change in the arrival of Tim Allan of strategic communications weakness in govt. Also massively strengthens the arm of the more “New Labour” constituency close to PM. And gather there was unease in some quarters about how the existing number 10 communications set up would work with an overall government head of Comms in David Dinsmore. That won’t be such a problem for Tim Allan. Interesting that it’s one Blairite in with T Allan and one out in the Downing Street pack shuffle as Liz Lloyd leaves. This was a waste of an experience’d hire: but never quite grafted on to the Starmer vibe and vice versa. So the policy jobs remain in the penumbra of people who have been close to KS – and the overall comms will be run by someone who’s default setting is to aim for the centre or even the right of centre. I’m not saying this will work, but it is something of a challenge Here is the Downing Street news release about the mini No 10 reshuffle, including Darren Jones becoming chief secretary (minister of state) to the PM. Jones was chief secretary to the Treasury. (See 9.43am.) This is a new post. There is no obvious precedent, although Boris Johnson also decided to bring a minister into No 10 in a delivery/enforcer role when he made Steve Barclay his chief of staff. (That appointment was not generally seen as a success.) Keir Starmer already has a chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney. But McSweeney is seen as better at strategising, campaigning and electioneering than he is at performance management. Jones, a spreadsheet enthusiast, will “work collaboratively across UK government to drive forward progress in key policy areas, reporting directly to the prime minister”, No 10 says. Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury, has been moved to a new senior role in Downing Street as Keir Starmer attempts to get a grip on delivery before what is likely to be a tumultuous autumn for the government, Pippa Crerar and Peter Walker report. Good morning. August used to be known as the “silly season” in newspaper offices because, with little proper news happening, journalists had to resort to trivia. Then we had Brexit, and the four-week silly season got replaced by eight years of chaos. This year there has been a slight reversion to the pre-2016 norm because the UK political debate over the summer has been entirely dominated by a debate about small boats and irregular migration which has not been fully rational. The claim that asylum seekers are posing a significant threat to public safety is classic xenophobic scaremongering, of the kind that has been a factor in British public life for centuries. (There is a good explanation of why the evidence does not support the scaremongering here.) But the issue isn’t remotely silly either. Small boat arrivals are a huge policy challenge for the government, because of the costs and the pressures on public services, but above all because the public want them to stop. And, with the summer recess now over and MPs returning to the Commons, this is still the top item on the government’s agenda. As Kiran Stacey reports, Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, is due to make a statement to the Commons on this topic this afternoon. She will cover various topics, including providing more detail on the government’s plan to restrict the extent to which article 8 of the European convention on human rights (the right to family life) can be used by asylum seekers to avoid deporting and giving an update on the “one in, one out” returns deal with France. But she will also give details of plans to restrict the ability of people granted asylum to bring family members to the UK. Kiran says: Cooper will promise to overhaul the UK’s family reunion policy, which allows people to bring their partners and children to the country once they are granted refugee status. The number of people who entered on such visas has risen sharply since 2022, with just over 20,000 being granted in the year to June 2025 – a 30% rise on the previous 12 months. Officials say the rise in refugee numbers is in part to blame, but they also believe the UK now has a more lax regime than many nearby countries after moves elsewhere in Europe to tighten their rules. In Denmark, for example, refugees must prove financial stability before being allowed to bring over family members. Cooper is understood to be looking at similar changes, as well as setting a minimum period refugees must be settled before being allowed to invite their families. This proposal has already been criticised by refugee advocates. Jon Featonby, chief policy analyst at the Refugee Council, says 90% of those affected will be women and children. He has posted these on Bluesky. The immigration white paper proposed putting in financial and language requirements. Financial requirements for refugees who have been stuck in the asylum system unable to work, and language requirements for children escaping war zones. This will either force families to stay split up, leaving thousands of women and children in extremely dangerous situations, or it forces them into dangerous journeys. Either way, this has terrible consequences. In the year to June 2025, 92% of refugee family reunion visas were given to women and children. More than half went to children. Two-thirds to people from Syria, Afghanistan, Eritrea, Iran and Sudan. It helps integration and provides a safe route. Family reunion should be easier, not harder. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: Kemi Badenoch and James Cleverly, the shadow housing secretary, are on a visit to Reigate where they are due to speak to the media. 11am: Richard Tice, the Reform UK deputy leader, holds a press conference highlighting plans for councils to save money via changes to the way they invest their pension funds. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 2.30pm: Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, takes questions in the Commons. After 3.30pm: At least two ministerial statements are expected in the Commons, from Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, on the asylum system, and from David Lammy, the foreign secretary, on Gaza. 4pm: The full written judgment is due to be published explaining the court decision on Friday blocking the temporary injuntion saying asylum seekers should be removed from the Bell hotel in Epping. Afternoon: The Liberal Democrats hope to make an application in the Commons to the Speaker for an emergency debate on Gaza.

I can’t read all the messages BTL, but if you put “Andrew” in a message aimed at me, I am more likely to see it because I search for posts containing that word. If you want to flag something up urgently, it is best to use social media. You can reach me on Bluesky at @andrewsparrowgdn.bsky.social. The Guardian has given up posting from its official accounts on X, but individual Guardian journalists are there, I still have my account, and if you message me there at @AndrewSparrow, I will see it and respond if necessary. I find it very helpful when readers point out mistakes, even minor typos. No error is too small to correct. And I find your questions very interesting too. I can’t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either BTL or sometimes in the blog.
