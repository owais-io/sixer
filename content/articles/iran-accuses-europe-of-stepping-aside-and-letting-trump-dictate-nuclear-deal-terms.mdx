  Europe is on the verge of abandoning its role of a mediator between the US and
  Iran and instead handing the Iran nuclear file over to Donald Trump’s veto,
  Iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson said in an interview with the Guardian in
  Tehran. Esmail Baghaei said that as soon as UN-wide sanctions are reimposed at
  Europe’s demand in less than 30 days, the US will regain its security council
  veto over what happens next, including the continuance of the sanctions. “The
  Europeans are doing what Trump dictated to them,” he said. “The Europeans’
  role is going to be diminished. If you go back to the European foreign policy
  leaders in the history of the nuclear deal Javier Solana, Cathy Ashton,
  Federica Mogherini, Josep Borrell, they all tried to liaise between Iran and
  the US. “They tried to prove they were credible negotiating partners. But now
  the Europeans have decided to be the proxy of the US and Israel. It is
  absolutely and irresponsible of them to hand over that role to the US”. He
  highlighted the claim by the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, that Israel
  was doing “the dirty work […] for all of us” by attacking Iran’s nuclear sites
  in June. “In a way all of the European countries condoned what Israel did, and
  very likely provided information to the Israeli regime,” Baghaei said. His
  remarks may be designed to put pressure on European capitals to distance
  themselves from the US and tone down the conditions they have set before they
  will agree to deferring UN sanctions. Baghaei also warned that the Iranian
  government is not constitutionally able to block Iran’s withdrawal from the
  Nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) if the Iranian parliament goes ahead
  and passes a law withdrawing from it in response to the European re-impositon
  of UN sanctions. Withdrawal from the treaties was the prerogative of
  parliament, he said. The number of MPs backing an NPT withdrawal bill is due
  to be unveiled on Tuesday but MPs said the measure is likely to be rushed
  through parliament with overwhelming support. Withdrawal from the NPT means
  the UN loses all rights to oversee Iran’s nuclear programme and will
  inevitably raise US concerns about whether Iran will use that fact to build
  nuclear bomb covertly or overtly. The powerful factions in the parliament seem
  convinced that Iran has the firepower to inflict heavy damage on Israel in the
  event of a second western attack. “We are prepared because this is a matter of
  our dignity and sovereignty,” Baghaei said. “I think you in the UK had your
  blitz spirit when attacked by Nazi Germany. We have the same spirit because we
  knew this war imposed on us in the middle of negotiations was so unjust.” The
  three European signatories to the original nuclear deal – France Germany and
  the UK – last Thursday notified the UN that they intend to use their right to
  reimpose UN wide sanctions at the end of the September unless Iran met three
  conditions: a return of UN weapons inspectors to the bombed Iranian nuclear
  sites, the handover of details of the whereabouts of its 400kg stockpile of
  highly enriched uranium, and agreement to open talks with America on the
  future of its nuclear programme. Europe says there is still room for diplomacy
  in the coming four weeks to each an agreement on these conditions. Baghaei
  described the European conditions as “a sign they are not serious and they do
  not have good faith”. He conceded: “There is an extreme trust deficit between
  the UN weapons inspectors from IAEA and Iran. There is a real concern that the
  information gathered at the sites by the IAEA would end up being passed on to
  Israel. “It has been a real concern especially after the highly politicised
  approach of the IAEA. We cannot ignore the fact that previous IAEA reports
  were abused by America and Israel to craft the resolution to the IAEA board
  which claimed that Iran was not in compliance with its obligations.” He said
  that that resolution was used as a pretext for the Israeli attack on Iran in
  June. He conceded that Iran’s room for diplomatic manoeuvre at the UN in the
  next month is limited because of the public mood in Iran. “The fact is our
  public is outraged because of the unlawful attacks on our facilities amd as a
  government we have to be accountable to our people and to our parliament. “The
  western media goes on about our cooperation with the IAEA and stockpiles, but
  western public has to remember the outrageous [acts] committed by Israel and
  the US. They topedoed the diplomatic process, they attacked the rule of
  international law because our facilities have been under inspection 24 hours a
  day for throughout the past three decades.” But Iranian officials insist that
  the aim remains to reach a compromise in the next month that will allow the
  weapons inspectors to return. Iranian diplomats have given assurances to the
  IAEA that the stockpiles have not been moved. They also insist they are
  willing to speak to the Americans, but repeated messages sent to Washington
  have not been met with any response so far. Baghaei also said Iran was willing
  to reduce the purity level at which it enriched uranium back to 3.67%, the
  level set in the old nuclear deal, so long as an overall agreement was reached
  that preserved Iran’s right to enrich uranium domestically. He questioned why
  the US was so intent on removing Iran’s right to enrich if, as Donald Trump
  claimed, Iran’s ability to undertake such enrichment had been already
  destroyed by the joint US-Israeli attacks.
