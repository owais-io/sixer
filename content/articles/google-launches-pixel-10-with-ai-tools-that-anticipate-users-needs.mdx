  Google’s latest Gemini AI upgrades attempt to anticipate what useful
  information you made need from your life to address a potential issue, make
  you to better photographer or become your personalised health and sleep coach.
  Shipping on the just-announced Pixel 10 Android phones, the new Magic Cue
  feature enables the chatbot to comb through your digital life and pull up
  relevant information on your phone just when you need it. Placing a call to an
  airline will automatically display your booking information from Gmail in the
  phone app. Or when a friend texts about brunch on Sunday Gemini will suggest a
  suitable coffee shop and show your calendar in line with your messages. The
  feature is part of a series of artificial intelligence upgrades for the newly
  announced Pixel 10, 10 Pro and 10 Pro Fold phones. Each has the new Tensor G5
  chip, which runs Magic Cue and other AI tools locally on a device. Leo Gebbie,
  a principal analyst at the research firm CCS Insight, said Google was
  “arguably positioning on-device AI more effectively than any of its rivals”
  and that the Magic Cue feature was “an early step towards the much-vaunted
  agentic AI experiences, which have been promised on smartphones for some
  time”. He added: “Google can take advantage of the fact that most Android
  users will already have heavily populated apps such as Gmail, Calendar and
  Maps with their personal information, and it is now drawing this data together
  in a more helpful way than ever before.” The Pixel 10 has a 6.3in OLED screen
  and an upgraded imaging system that includes a 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto
  camera for the first time, taking the number of cameras on the back to three,
  compared with two on previous models. The Pixel 10 Pro comes in two sizes with
  a 6.3in or 6.8in screen and features three cameras on the back including a
  48MP telephoto camera capable of 10x optical zoom. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold
  becomes one of the first folding phones to feature the full IP68 water and
  dust resistance common among standard slab phones, as Google attempts to allay
  durability concerns of the flexible screen. It features a similar camera
  system to the Pixel 10. The phones also support various AI photography
  features including the new Camera Coach that uses Google’s AI servers to
  analyse the scene in front of the camera to suggest different framing, angles
  and lighting to take a better photo. The Pixel 10 starts at £799
  (€899/$799/A$1,349) and the Pixel 10 Pro starts at £999 (€1,099/$999/A$1,699)
  and ships on 28 August. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold costs from £1,749
  (€1,899/$1,799/A$2,699) and ships later on 9 October. Pixel Watch 4 and Pixel
  Buds 2a Google also unveiled the Pixel Watch 4 smartwatch, which brings Gemini
  to the wrist and can act as personal AI heath coach. Part of the new Fitbit
  app, Gemini can create personalised fitness and sleep plans, measure the
  impact of training in real time and answer health and fitness questions
  chatbot-style. The Pixel Watch 4 is available in two sizes and has a domed
  screen that is 10% larger than its predecessors. It is the first smartwatch to
  offer SOS satellite-based emergency services when off the grid, starting with
  the US. The device is also the first Google smartwatch to be designed for
  serviceability including battery and screen repairs, finally catching up to
  Apple and Samsung. It costs from £349 (€499/$349/A$579). Meanwhile, the Pixel
  Buds 2a are a cheaper version of Google’s compact Bluetooth earbuds and cost
  £129 (€149/$129/A$239). They have a same Tensor A1 chip as the company’s top
  Buds Pro 2 earbuds, and have noise cancelling and integrated Gemini AI
  assistant. The Buds 2a charging case is also designed with a replaceable
  battery, although the earbuds themselves are not repairable.
