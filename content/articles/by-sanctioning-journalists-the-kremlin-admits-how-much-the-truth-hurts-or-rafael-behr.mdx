  There is a Russian proverb: don’t blame the mirror if your face is crooked. I
  first came across it as the epigraph to The Government Inspector, Gogol’s 1836
  masterpiece satirising corruption and hypocrisy in the provinces of the tsar’s
  empire. The phrase sprang to mind last week when I learned that a 21st-century
  government inspector is displeased with things I have written about Vladimir
  Putin and his imperial war against Ukraine – the land of Gogol’s birth. This I
  know because my name has been added to the “stop list”, a growing roster of
  undesirable elements – politicians, journalists, charity workers, consultants
  – banned from entering the Russian federation. The Russian foreign ministry
  said this was a retaliation for “London’s continued confrontational course” in
  supplying weapons to “the neo-Nazi Kiev regime”. Since I’m not an arms dealer,
  my inclusion on the list must be for the subsidiary offence of spreading
  “anti-Russia narratives”. Presumably, that relates to my characterisation of
  Putin as a venal despot and ideological crackpot, whose unprovoked attack on
  Ukraine was as strategically ill-conceived as it was murderous. I can see why
  the Kremlin’s inspectorate of media narratives might recoil from the sight of
  such blood-soaked crookedness, but like the proverb says, that’s not the
  mirror’s fault. The statement of sanctions is sinister and absurd. It is
  written with the combination of bombast and menace that Russians recognise as
  the idiom of capricious, vindictive bureaucracy with deep roots. It is
  familiar to generations that grew up in the Soviet Union, steeped in the
  self-satirising pomp of a thin-skinned power that you can’t take seriously in
  private but are careful not to ridicule in public. It is older even than that.
  Gogol was a master at capturing social deformations that arise from a duty of
  deference to dysfunctional autocracy, holding a mirror up to all the grotesque
  and preposterous contortions. At the end of The Government Inspector, the
  disgraced town mayor turns to the audience. “Who are you laughing at?” he
  asks. “You’re laughing at yourselves.” The bleak absurdity of Putin’s rule is
  not lost on Russians, not all of them. But any jokes have to be coded,
  discreet, transmitted in glances and arch references. The country has a knack
  for dark humour that tracks its long habituation to repression. It’s one of
  the traits, first encountered in translation, that made me want to study the
  language, and then led me to fall in love with the place when I lived there as
  a student more than 30 years ago. It’s one of the reasons I stay invested in
  the relationship, albeit now in a condition of forced estrangement. I have
  spent a lot of time engrossed in the works of novelists and poets, giants of
  world literature to whom monuments are erected and after whom streets are
  named, who would be denounced for disseminating “anti-Russia narratives” if
  they were writing today. I have enough Russian friends to know that there are
  stories other than the ones told by Putin’s propagandists about a president
  who is the incarnation of heroic national destiny. I know liberals who have
  fled their homeland, and more who have retreated to that place of interior
  exile, where the clear-eyed dissident spirit takes refuge from public
  delirium. I know there is more than one Russia and that describing atrocities
  perpetrated by the state is not synonymous with hostility to the people.
  Dictators always conflate those things. Nationalists always seek a harmonious
  alignment of governing institutions, ruling party and cultural identity. The
  regime decides which traits, symbols and opinions qualify as correct
  expressions of nationhood. Divergence is anathematised as degenerate or
  treasonous. This might start as a process of narrowing, pinching and whittling
  to fit the subtle, complex contours of a variegated nation into a rigid
  doctrinal frame. It soon turns to pressing and beating, hacking away at
  awkward protrusions of independent thought. As nationalism turns more radical
  it tends inevitably to violence, first rhetorical but soon physical. Disloyal
  thought must be excised. The seditious imagination must be suffocated.
  Political opposition must be cast as the pawn of nefarious foreign nations,
  against whom war must be waged to galvanise patriotic spirit. Putin has
  marched Russia a long way down that road, deep into the bloody quagmire in
  Ukraine. Less documented, also violent but more successful, is the Kremlin’s
  campaign against Russian pluralism. It is a war on the very idea of Russia as
  a people whose history transcends the martial cliches trotted out by their
  banal brute of a president; whose cultural greatness is expressed in the
  tradition of resistance, not the demand for submission. Maybe I am a partisan
  of that cause, but it isn’t an anti-Russia narrative. It isn’t the people
  holding the mirror who make Putin’s regime crooked. Who are you blaming, guys?
