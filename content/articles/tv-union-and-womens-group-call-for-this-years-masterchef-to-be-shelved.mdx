  The BBC is facing mounting pressure to scrap this year’s series of MasterChef
  after the sacking of the presenters Gregg Wallace and John Torode. The heads
  of the broadcast union Bectu and a leading women’s rights organisation have
  joined those calling for the series to be shelved, arguing it would cause
  distress to the people who had made complaints about the two men. Last week
  the BBC said it would broadcast a series of MasterChef featuring Wallace and
  Torode, which was filmed before the presenters were dropped after allegations
  about their behaviour were upheld. The corporation said it was not “an easy
  decision”, but argued it was the “right thing to do” for the amateur chefs who
  had taken part, adding that the show’s producers had spoken to contestants
  about airing the programme. But on Friday the head of Bectu, Philippa Childs,
  said the BBC should reconsider its decision. “Whilst the BBC claims that it
  has consulted with contestants there appears to have been no consultation with
  complainants; freelancers who have taken the very difficult step of speaking
  out and who will legitimately feel distressed,” she told BBC News. “If [the
  BBC] are serious about addressing this industry-wide problem, broadcasters
  should not reward bad behaviour with primetime coverage.” Penny East, the
  chief executive of the Fawcett Society, suggested it would be better to edit
  the presenters out entirely. “Seeing Gregg Wallace on our screens will be
  deeply uncomfortable for many people, not least the brave women who have
  spoken about his appalling behaviour,” she said. “It can’t be right that men
  who sexually harass women continue to be given a platform and allowed to
  maintain their profile and power.” Wallace was dropped by the BBC after an
  independent report substantiated 45 allegations made against him, including
  claims of inappropriate sexual language and one incident of unwelcome physical
  contact. He has apologised “for any distress caused” and said the report
  cleared him of “the most serious and sensational accusations”. Torode was
  dropped as a presenter after he said he was the subject of a substantiated
  complaint over the use of racist language, which he believes never happened.
  On Thursday the Guardian revealed that one of the contestants from the latest
  series of MasterChef had been edited out of the programme, after telling its
  producers she did not want the show to be broadcast. Sarah Shafi, from Leeds,
  said she told the show’s producers that airing it would send the wrong message
  about the treatment of women. She said she initially rejected an offer by
  MasterChef’s producers, Banijay, to edit her out of her episode. The
  57-year-old agreed to be removed once the BBC announced it had decided to
  broadcast the series from 6 August. “I didn’t say edit me out,” she said. “I
  said: ‘Axe the show, don’t air the show. I’m asking you not to air the show.’
  Prominent figures have been abusing their power. What message does that send
  out to women?” One former MasterChef worker who said she had been groped by
  Wallace told BBC News the decision to broadcast the series showed “a blatant
  disregard for the people who have come forward”. Another person who worked on
  the show, and who said Wallace pulled his trousers down in front of her, said
  the decision to air the series was “profoundly disrespectful” to people who
  had made complaints. “It ultimately sends a message that such behaviour can be
  overlooked,” she said.
