  Sunyi, 38, Wakefield Occupation Novelist Voting record A mix of Labour and Lib
  Dem, and Green in local elections Amuse bouche She once climbed a big metal
  pole during a lightning storm because she was trying to impress a girl. “She
  was more amused than impressed” Francis, 58, Huddersfield Occupation Not
  working right now, but was a tram driver in Manchester Voting record
  Conservative for the last two elections. If voting today, probably Reform,
  “but certainly not Labour” Amuse bouche He once entered a competition to go on
  to the Manchester City football pitch and kick a ball from the goalline to the
  centre circle. He got the ball closest to the circle, and won a free trip to
  the 2006 World Cup final For starters Francis I’m a fairly confident person
  because of my background dealing with the public, but I think she was a bit
  nervous. She might have been expecting a woman because of my name! Sunyi I
  have a lot of family who are very conservative and I talk to a lot of people
  with different backgrounds, so I wasn’t too nervous. He took the time to learn
  how to say my name properly – most people don’t! Francis For starters, I had
  chicken goujons and dips. For the main I had pulled brisket and chips with a
  classic cheeseburger. It was really good. Also a shandy, because I was
  driving. Sunyi I started with mozzarella bites with a cheese dip, and for the
  main had a burger with onion chutney and brie. It was nice, but there was a
  lot of it. The big beef Francis Sunyi told me she was illegal for a number of
  years and wasn’t given any help. But she didn’t come in on a boat, she came on
  a plane and applied. I think people have to come in the right way. Sunyi You
  can only claim asylum by showing up. In my case, I came for university, and
  the Home Office lost my documents. So I was essentially illegal for four
  years. It derailed my life. People often say, “Well, that’s a special case”,
  but every case is special. I think people are good at being kind to someone
  who’s in front of them, but when it becomes abstract, people just become
  numbers. Francis I’m not saying they’re all abusing the system, and I know we
  only ever hear about extremes in the press. But we agreed they need to be
  processed faster. We could do with an off-land processing site, like Rwanda.
  We need to stop the boats to give us breathing space to process the ones who
  are here. Sunyi We agreed the cases need to be processed faster. He thinks the
  cost must be astronomical, but I doubt it’s that high. The amount of people
  coming in doesn’t seem to me, percentage-wise, a huge number. Sharing plate
  Francis I don’t understand why we’re still tied to the European convention on
  human rights (ECHR). We voted for Brexit, so therefore we should be out of
  anything to do with Europe. Sunyi I understand where he’s coming from, but
  Britain is safer tied to Europe. When the Home Office lost my documents, I was
  married and my children were born here, so under the ECHR they had the right
  to stay and I couldn’t be kicked out. Without the ECHR, my lawyer said I’d be
  expected to leave, reapply and come back in. For afters Francis I’m not
  against net zero. I just don’t think it’s attainable. Even if we go electric,
  something’s got to power it all, and nuclear is only clean energy until you’ve
  got waste that has to be managed for 500 years. Sunyi Just because we don’t
  have a solution yet, that doesn’t mean there won’t ever be one. He calls
  himself a climate-change denier in that he doesn’t think humans caused it. I
  think that’s immaterial; it’s here, it’s doing damage. And he did agree we
  should be doing more to mitigate the changes in climate we’re seeing.
  Takeaways Francis I was really hardline about immigration, but listening to
  the stories about her struggles has softened me a little bit. Not everybody is
  coming here to milk the system. Sunyi When we discussed Brexit, he said public
  opinion is changing because many of the people who support it are dying out,
  and young people want different things. I feel like we represented that
  generational gap. But it’s helpful to keep talking to people who think
  differently. Additional reporting: Kitty Drake • Sunyi and Francis ate at
  Harvey’s Bar/Kitchen in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire. Want to meet someone from
