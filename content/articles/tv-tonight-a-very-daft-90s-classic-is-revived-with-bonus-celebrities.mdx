  Van Morrison: Later … With Jools Holland 9.10pm, BBC Two It’s been 30 years
  since Van Morrison first performed on Later – and it was far from his last.
  Jools Holland celebrates one of his favourite artists by looking back at his
  most memorable visits, including the 1999 Hootenanny and the 25th anniversary
  celebration at the Royal Albert Hall in 2017. Expect classics, collaborations
  and a take on Frank Sinatra’s That’s Life. Hollie Richardson You Bet! on Tour
  8pm, ITV1 This revival of the 90s war horse, in which celebrities wager on
  unlikely challenges, takes things out of the studio and on the road, beginning
  on a blowy beach in Bournemouth. Stephen Mulhern asks Alesha Dixon, Josie
  Gibson and Josh Widdicombe to partake in daft tasks such as: can you use three
  JCB diggers to set up a deckchair? Graeme Virtue Bettany Hughes’ Lost Worlds:
  The Nabataeans 8pm, Channel 4 Continuing her mission to spotlight the
  forgotten ancient Middle East civilisation, Bettany Hughes is at a newly
  discovered temple in the waters of the Bay of Naples. It’s proof of an ancient
  trade network from Oman and across the Red Sea, which led the Nabataeans to be
  big players on the global map. HR The Count of Monte Cristo 9pm, U&amp;Drama
  This lavishly silly adaptation of Alexandre Dumas’ already daft novel has
  proved a reliable source of guilty amusement. Sam Claflin’s Count Edmond
  continues to saunter around villainously, this time conjuring some sneaky
  financial peril for Danglars and buying the freedom of bewildered Algerian
  slave Haydee, presumably for nefarious reasons. Phil Harrison Annika 9.10pm,
  BBC One “They found a body in the river … you might need to come over.” It
  seems Annika can’t even enjoy a minibreak at an eco resort in Perthshire
  (albeit with a family struggle in tow) without a corpse popping up in the
  vicinity. So how has local builder Casper McCray ended up in the drink? Ali
  Catterall One Night 10pm, ITV1 More glossy Aussie drama: a journalist turns up
  on Tess’s doorstep saying she knows Tess is the anonymous writer of One Night.
  Of course, we know the real author is Tess’s friend Simone – when that
  realisation hits, there’s a confrontation that could end their lifelong
  friendship. HR Film choice The Quick and the Dead, 9pm, 5Action Back in 1995 –
  when she was a far bigger draw than Russell Crowe and Leonardo DiCaprio –
  Sharon Stone starred alongside them in Sam Raimi’s jolly spaghetti western
  homage. Cowgirl Ellen rides into the town of Redemption on the eve of a
  sharp-shooting competition organised by the autocratic mayor, Herod (Gene
  Hackman). She seems to have a beef with him, but what is it? Also intrigued by
  her are Crowe’s outlaw turned pacifist preacher Cort and DiCaprio’s
  braggadocious teenage gunslinger the Kid, in a reworking of Sergio Leone’s
  greatest tricks. Simon Wardell Live sport Premier League Football: Chelsea v
  Fulham, 11am, TNT Sports 1 Followed by Leeds v Newcastle at 5pm on Sky Sports
  Main Event. Women’s Rugby World Cup: Canada v Wales, 11.45am, BBC Two Followed
  by Scotland v Fiji at 2.15pm, then England v Samoa at 4.35pm. Ireland play
  Spain on Sunday at 11.45am. Men’s Cycling: Vuelta a España, 3.15pm, TNT Sports
  1 Stage eight from Monzón Templario to Zaragoza. Tennis: US Open, 8.30pm, Sky
  Sports Main Event Day seven of the grand slam.
