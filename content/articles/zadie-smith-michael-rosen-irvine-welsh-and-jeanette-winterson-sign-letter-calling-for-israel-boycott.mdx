  Zadie Smith, Michael Rosen, Irvine Welsh and Jeanette Winterson are among more
  than 200 writers who have signed a letter calling for an “immediate and
  complete” boycott of Israel until the people of Gaza are given adequate food,
  water and aid. Hanif Kureishi, Brian Eno, Elif Shafak, George Monbiot,
  Benjamin Myers, Geoff Dyer and Sarah Hall also signed the letter, which
  advocates the cessation of all “trade, exchange and business” with Israel.
  Hunger-related deaths in Gaza have risen to 197, following last week’s alert
  from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) initiative that
  “the worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza
  Strip”. In early March Israel imposed a blockade on Gaza, preventing food,
  water and medical supplies from entering the territory. In mid-May, after
  growing international pressure, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin
  Netanyahu, said shipments would restart. However, records from Cogat, the
  Israeli agency that controls aid shipments into Gaza, show that the quantity
  of aid reaching the territory in May and June fell well below subsistence
  levels. The writers “call on all people, institutions, governments and states
  to observe an immediate and complete boycott of all forms of trade, exchange
  and business with the state of Israel until the people of Gaza are adequately
  provided with drinking water, food and medical supplies, and until all other
  forms of relief and necessity are restored to the people of Gaza under the
  aegis of the United Nations”. The letter, which was organised by the writers
  Horatio Clare and Sean Murray, has 207 signatories, including Laline Paull,
  Patrick Gale, Michel Faber and Marina Warner. It follows a May letter signed
  by hundreds of writers, also co-organised by Clare, stating that Israel’s
  attacks on Gaza amount to genocide. The new letter reads: “We make this call
  because the words and feelings of millions of people and thousands of
  politicians worldwide have failed to bring about the feeding of the people of
  Gaza, the protection of civilians or their supply with humanitarian and
  medical aid. “We regret that this boycott affects a great many individuals and
  groups in Israel and other countries who share our rejection of the policies
  of the government of Benjamin Netanyahu; individuals and groups whose pain and
  compassion for the people of Gaza we share.” The writers propose that the
  boycott remains in place until the UN declares the civilian population of Gaza
  “is safe and in receipt of adequate food and aid”. The letter also demands the
  “return of all hostages and those imprisoned without charge or trial on all
  sides”, an “end to settler violence against Palestinians on the West Bank” and
  “the immediate and permanent ceasefire and cessation of violence by Hamas and
  Israel”. Campaign groups have been calling for boycotts against Israel for
  decades, with the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)
  movement, established in 2005, encouraging economic, cultural and academic
  boycotts. “We stand in solidarity with the resistance of Palestinian, Jewish
  and Israeli people to the genocidal policies of the current Israeli
  government”, the letter states. “We note that prominent and respected Israeli
  and Jewish groups in Israel and other countries, including many of our fellow
  writers, have recently called for serious and impactful sanctions on Israeli
  institutions, to which we add, on, and only on, objectively culpable
  individuals. A boycott is the only sanction an individual can apply. “In
  calling for and observing this boycott, we assert without reservation our
  absolute opposition to and loathing of antisemitism, of anti-Jewish and
  anti-Israeli prejudice. “We reject and abhor attacks, hate and violence – in
  writing, speech and action – against Palestinian, Israeli, and Jewish people
  in all and any form.” The letter concludes: “The children of Gaza, like all
  children, are the children of all of us, and the future of our world. In their
  name, we call for and observe this boycott.”
