  Rescuers in Norway have continued the search for an award-winning
  environmental journalist who has gone missing in bad weather during a solo
  hike in the remote Folgefonna national park, home to one of the country’s
  biggest glaciers. Alec Luhn, a US-born reporter who has worked for the New
  York Times and the Atlantic, and was a regular Russia correspondent for the
  Guardian from 2013 to 2017, was reported missing on Monday after he failed to
  catch a flight to the UK from Bergen. Norwegian media said Luhn, 38, was
  holidaying with his sister in Norway and had set out on the four-day hike
  alone on 31 July from the outdoor centre of Ullensvang on the northern edge of
  the park, a 550 sq km wilderness in the west of the country. Local police told
  the public broadcaster, NRK, that a 30-strong volunteer search and rescue team
  from the Red Cross, dogs, drones and police were all involved in the search on
  Tuesday after the operation had to be suspended late on Monday night. “Weather
  conditions started to get really bad around midnight,” when a rescue
  helicopter was recalled amid strong winds and heavy rain, said Tatjana
  Knappen, an operations manager from Vestland police. “It was not reasonable to
  continue the search up in the mountains.” Police said late on Tuesday
  afternoon that volunteer rescuers had been pulled out because of
  fast-deteriorating weather conditions but the search would continue into the
  evening. “We have to put rescue teams’ safety first,” the police chief Svein
  Buer told VG newspaper. Luhn is an experienced mountain walker, fit and
  well-equipped, police said. His wife, the Emmy-award winning journalist
  Veronika Silchenko, posted on social media on Tuesday asking anyone who had
  seen him or had information to contact her. Luhn, who among numerous awards
  also has two Emmy nominations, was based for many years in Moscow, then
  Istanbul and now lives in the UK. Specialising in climate journalism, he is a
  Pulitzer Center Ocean Reporting Network fellow. Folgefonna, the third largest
  icecap in Norway, is on a peninsula famed for its fjords, mountains, rivers,
  lakes and icefalls. It has been a centre for wilderness adventure since the
  19th century, but parts are desolate and can be treacherous especially in poor
  weather.
