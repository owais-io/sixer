  Footage of Erin Patterson dumping a food dehydrator at a tip and handing a
  mobile phone to police has been released by the Victorian supreme court,
  almost a month after she was found guilty of murdering and attempting to
  murder her estranged husband’s family. Both sets of footage were tendered as
  exhibits during Patterson’s trial, but only were released to the media on
  Monday. The footage was taken from the Koonwarra Transfer Station CCTV and
  from a police officer filming the execution of a search warrant at Patterson’s
  Leongatha home. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Both events happened in August
  2023, the week immediately after Patterson served a lunch of beef wellington
  laced with death cap mushrooms that fatally poisoned Don and Gail Patterson,
  the parents of her estranged husband Simon, and Heather Wilkinson, Gail’s
  sister. Ian Wilkinson, Gail’s husband, survived. Patterson can be seen on the
  footage taking the Sunbeam food dehydrator, which is in its box and placing it
  in an area for electronic waste disposal. The dehydrator – described during
  the trial as “the murder weapon” – was later recovered by police, and found to
  contain traces of death cap mushrooms and Patterson’s fingerprints. The
  footage taken from inside her home shows Patterson sitting at her dining room
  table and handing over a mobile phone to a detective at the conclusion of an
  almost four-hour search of the property. It was later alleged that Patterson
  did not hand police her main mobile phone at this time, but another device
  which she had recently factory reset and would reset again in the coming
  hours. It was alleged her main phone was never recovered by police.
