  Elizabeth Alker’s article on Paul McCartney’s interest in avant-garde music is
  fascinating (‘The King Lear in I Am the Walrus? That came from John Cage’:
  Paul McCartney on the Beatles’ debt to great avant-garde composers, 19
  August). But she omits his attendance at a production of Michael Tippett’s
  last opera, New Year, whose music incorporated rap and reggae, reduced the
  strings in the orchestra, and included saxophones, percussion and electronic
  space music. McCartney was so fascinated that he requested a meeting with the
  composer, which I arranged. The octogenarian Tippett and the young McCartney
  got on like a house on fire. Meirion Bowen London • Your article (Teach boys
  and girls together about menstruation, UCL study argues, 20 August) brought me
  the lovely memory of my then seven-year-old son, who returned from school one
  day in the 1980s saying that they had had sex education. The boys were in a
  separate room from the girls, but he told me it didn’t matter because he
  talked to a girl at breaktime and “she told me all about periods and cemetery
  towels”. Alyson Elliman Carshalton, London • Your article on pulses (17
  August) might have added one further tip: a pressure cooker makes cooking
  dried beans almost effortless. Many varieties can be cooked, without soaking,
  in much less than an hour. William Hawkins London • Malcolm Rush suggests that
  the inclusion of Mar-a-Lago in the territories to be ceded to Russia would
  help get the Trump-Putin deal over the line (Letters, 18 August). Many would
  suggest it has already been ceded. Ian Reissman Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire
  • Thanks to Keith Flett for providing his age (Letters, 20 August), but it’s
  dispiriting to find that, when you’ve long regarded him as the grandaddy of
  the letters page, you’re older than him. Anne Cowper Swansea • The return of
  “Smarty-pants” for rare words in Wordiply is sheer prestidigitation and I am
  flabbergasted at the speed of your capitulation (Letters, 20 August). Maria
  Koval London • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
