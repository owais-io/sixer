  A teenager has been arrested on suspicion of rape and murder after the death
  of a 13-year-old girl in West Yorkshire, police have said. Officers were
  called to a flat on Sheepridge Road in Huddersfield on Monday night to reports
  that a girl was unresponsive. West Yorkshire police said the victim died in
  hospital and her death was being treated as “unexplained” after a postmortem
  examination. A 16-year-old boy from Huddersfield was arrested on suspicion of
  murder and rape and is in custody. The suspect was also arrested on suspicion
  of another offence of rape relating to a 16-year-old girl from a separate
  incident elsewhere in the Kirklees district, the force said on Thursday. DCI
  Stacey Atkinson said: “A postmortem was not able to determine how she died,
  and we continue to treat her death as unexplained at this time, pending more
  inquiries. “Those inquiries are complex and are likely to be lengthy as we
  work to fully understand the circumstances of the girl’s death.” West
  Yorkshire police said: “Police were called by the ambulance service to an
  address on Sheepridge Road, Huddersfield at 11.36pm on Monday 11 August to a
  report that the teenage girl was unresponsive. “The 13-year-old was taken to
  hospital where she sadly died in the early hours of Tuesday morning. A
  16-year-old boy, from Huddersfield, was arrested on suspicion of murder and
  rape, remains in police custody. “A postmortem examination was conducted [on
  Wednesday] which concluded the girl’s death was unexplained pending further
  investigation.”
