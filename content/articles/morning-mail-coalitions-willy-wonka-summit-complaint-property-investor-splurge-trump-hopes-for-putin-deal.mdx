  Morning everyone. Jim Chalmers has given us the big buildup for his economic
  summit next week but the Coalition is now comparing him to Willy Wonka giving
  away golden tickets for a “privileged talk-fest” (with economic reform,
  presumably, as the chocolate). Back in the real economy, new figures show
  property investors are borrowing more than ever and edging first-time buyers
  out of contention. Donald Trump thinks Vladimir Putin is ready to make a deal
  in Alaska, while the AFLW season is up and running with a win for Carlton over
  Collingwood. Australia Koala threat | Habitat for threatened koalas that are
  part of a population described by one expert as nationally significant would
  be bulldozed under plans to extend a Queensland coalmine. ‘Candy man’ | The
  Coalition has likened the treasurer’s much-anticipated economic summit next
  week to Charlie and Chocolate Factory and dubbed Jim Chalmers “Australia’s
  candy man” as it challenges Labor proposals it says would increase taxes and
  pass debt to future generations. NSW | The Minns government will establish a
  $1m program to combat anti-Muslim hate, including establishing a support
  hotline for victims and a program to build awareness of Islamophobia. Investor
  record | Property investors borrowed a record sum, nearly $130bn, to buy homes
  over the year to June, supported by interest rate cuts but squeezing out
  first-time buyers, according to figures out today. Stratton tributes |
  Legendary film critic David Stratton has been remembered for his “incredible
  insight”, “humility” and “deep love of cinema” in tributes after his death at
  age 85. Catch up with Luke Buckmaster’s personal tribute here, and our
  obituary of the revered cinephile. World Deal or no deal? | Donald Trump
  believes Vladimir Putin is ready to make a deal on the war in Ukraine as the
  two leaders prepare for their summit in Alaska, but his suggestion the Russian
  leader and Volodymyr Zelenskyy could “divvy things up” may alarm some in Kyiv.
  The Russian president is expected to tempt his US counterpart with financial
  incentives from Russia’s “untapped” economic potential in exchange for siding
  with him. Keir Starmer and Zelenskyy met in Downing Street (pictured) and
  hailed “a visible chance for peace” – so long as Putin takes steps to prove he
  is serious. And our American politics podcast asks if Trump is too weak to be
  a strongman. Settler split | Israel appears set to give formal planning
  approval to a highly controversial settlement project for more than 3,400 new
  homes – which has been frozen for decades – which critics say would split the
  occupied West Bank in half. Cholera outbreak | The “worst cholera outbreak in
  years” has killed at least 40 people in the past week in Sudan, according to
  the medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières. India floods | At least 37
  people have died and more than 200 are missing after a sudden rainstorm in
  Indian Kashmir, the second such disaster in the Himalayas in a little over a
  week. Aztec gold | Nearly five centuries after Spanish conquistador Hernán
  Cortés signed it and decades after someone swiped it from national archives, a
  priceless manuscript page has been returned by the FBI to Mexico. Full Story
  Newsroom edition: can Labor jumpstart the economy? Bridie Jabour talks to the
  head of newsroom, Mike Ticher, and our economics editor, Patrick Commins,
  about whether the Albanese government has the ambition for big reform.
  In-depth The Greens have urged Labor to stop allowing manufacturers of F-35
  fighter jet parts to sell to global suppliers that can then pass them on to
  Israel – but the government says such claims are “misinformation”. So who’s
  telling the truth? Henry Belot investigates. Not the news After an opening
  volume called Young Hawke: The Making of a Larrikin, the second part of David
  Day’s biography of Bob Hawke is The Making of a Legend and explores how he
  quit drinking to help become prime minister. Paul Daley writes that “those of
  us voted for him … won’t regret it when they read this book. But they will
  understand a lot more about the man’s fabric.” Sport AFLW | A slick Carlton
  performance saw off Collingwood in the AFLW’s opening match in Melbourne last
  night and there were enough flashes of brilliance from the league’s newest
  faces to show the competition has a future. Rugby union | The Wallabies’
  promising backs will come up against the formidable South African forwards in
  Johannesburg this weekend, but veteran James O’Connor will lead the playmaking
  duties after being recalled for the start of the Rugby Championship. Swimming
  | Michael Phelps has launched a scathing attack on USA Swimming’s leadership
  with the 23-times Olympic gold medallist branding the body weak and demanding
  sweeping reforms after what he sees as years of decline. Media roundup The
  University of Technology has suspended enrolments for more than 100 courses
  next year amid financial problems and plans to axe about 400 jobs, the Sydney
  Morning Herald reports. Transurban says it will refund drivers for incorrect
  toll charges, which it blames on an increase in number plate duplicates, the
  Canberra Times says. Changes to Western Australia’s gun laws have been backed
  by parliament despite an attempt to stop them, WAtoday reports. What’s
  happening today Economy | CommBank data release on household spending. New
  South Wales | Committal at Parkes courthouse for the man accused of the
  domestic violence murder of Molly Ticehurst. Arts | Children’s book of the
