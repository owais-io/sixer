  It is the millennial’s perennial problem: returning home after spending a
  small fortune on an avocado only to find the green fruit is either too squishy
  to slice for a salad or too hard to smash on toast. One UK retailer, however,
  is claiming to have found the tech to solve the textural trouble. Tesco has
  begun trialling in-store avocado scanners that allow shoppers to asses how
  ripe the fruit is before they put it in their basket. The UK’s biggest
  supermarket said the machines, which will be in five stores from this week,
  work like tiny X-rays to find out what the fruit looks like inside. The
  scanners will return one of two ripeness readings when shoppers present it
  with an avocado: immediately ready for smashing, or better for slicing. The
  One Third Avocado Scanner, named after the Dutch company that invented it,
  promises to read the ripeness of the fruit in seconds, so shoppers can go home
  knowing the perfect avocado toast awaits. Lisa Lawrence, an avocado buyer at
  Tesco, said the scanner would help people plan their grocery shopping better
  and reduce waste. “Smashed avocado on sourdough continues to be one of the
  trendiest snacks at the moment, garnering millions of views on social media
  sites for recipe ideas, so we think, for that reason, the scanner will be
  really popular with shoppers,” she said. The five Tesco stores piloting the
  scanner are the Cheshunt Extra in Hertfordshire; the Colchester superstore in
  Essex; the Stratford-upon-Avon superstore in Warwickshire; the Wokingham
  superstore in Berkshire and the Salisbury Extra in Wiltshire. Avocados have
  become a breakfast staple in Britain despite concerns about their carbon
  footprint, water usage and fears about ethical standards on farms. Tesco said
  it sold nearly 15m more avocados last year compared with the previous year.
  The supermarket has worked with the fruit supplier Westfalia Fruit on the
  avocado scanner project. Last year the companies worked together to test out
  the idea of etching or “tattooing” avocados as a way to reduce the millions of
  plastic stickers used to label them. They also introduced cardboard and paper
  packaging across all Tesco’s packed avocados, which Westfalia said helped save
  20m pieces of plastic a year.
