  It’s a dove-soft, pigeon-grey Sunday morning, the like of which my friends in
  India insist I’m just making up. Not a whisper of breeze and borderline chilly
  at 17C. I am sitting on the edge of my friend Flip’s wildlife pond, listening
  to the sound of church bells from across the valley. This was a plain old lawn
  until a few years ago, when Flip decided to hire a mini-digger and a create a
  pond. It was winter, raining non‑stop, and the result was a massive crater of
  mud. It looked like a meteor had hit. It’s hard to imagine that now. The pond
  lies peaceful, dotted with lily pads, lined with flag irises, sedge and water
  milfoil. Iris stems lean over the water, weighed down by green seedpods, plump
  as Zeppelins. Bumblebees make their way up spikes of purple loosestrife,
  checking each floret in case it’s been missed. After this year’s long, dry
  summer, the grass is as crisp as biscuits, and down in his wonderful garden
  some of the trees have suffered. The old oak is furred with mildew, the silver
  birches prematurely autumnal. Flip and I pick mulberries from the ancient tree
  in the middle. The berries are so juicy and ripe, you drink rather than eat
  them: a gorgeous sweet burst of dark wine on the tongue. Soon our hands are
  stained, our hair full of lichen and twigs. We’ve been praying for rain, and
  here, in the mulberry cathedral, comes the answer. At first a smattering
  crackle that bounces off the leaves, then a drizzle, then a downpour, and we
  are forced inside. All gardeners know that the single most effective way to
  make your plot more wildlife‑friendly is to put in a pond. Flip’s wildlife
  camera reveals foxes, deer, even badgers trekking across at night from the
  sett on the adjacent hill, and bats galore at twilight. We sip our coffee and
  look out across the hillside as the bells ring out, the rain pours down and
  the dry earth drinks it up. The recipe for life, it turns out, is simple: just
  add water. • Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country
