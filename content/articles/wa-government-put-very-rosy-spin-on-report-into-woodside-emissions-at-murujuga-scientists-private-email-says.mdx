  The Western Australia government “put a very rosy spin” on a summary report of
  a project checking if pollutants from Woodside were damaging 50,000-year-old
  rock art, according to a private email sent by the lead scientist. In an email
  released to the ABC, Murujuga Rock Art Monitoring Project lead scientist Prof
  Ben Mullins, of Curtin University, said the WA government had “insisted” on
  writing the summary report, despite a contract saying that Curtin should write
  it. Mullins also wrote in his email to the vice-chancellor that the state
  Department of Water and Environmental Regulation (DWER) had probably “hoped
  everyone would only read the summary and not the full report”. Rock art expert
  Prof Benjamin Smith at the University of Western Australia said earlier this
  year the summary report was “not worth the paper it is written on” and
  characterised it as propaganda. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Smith has said
  the full report does show the rock art is being damaged by industrial
  emissions, but the WA government and Mullins have said the MRAMP studies
  suggest it is not, and that damage detected to some rocks was likely from
  historic emissions in the region in the 1970s and 1980s. MRAMP was set up to
  examine if emissions from nearby industry, including Woodside’s Karratha gas
  plant, were damaging the rock art in the Pilbara region of WA. The federal
  environment minister, Murray Watt, has said he intends to approve a plan from
  Woodside to extend its North West Shelf gas operations, including the gas
  plant, until 2070. Woodside is still in talks with the government about
  conditions that Watt has said relate to the release of industrial emissions
  that could pose a threat to the rock art. The details of those conditions have
  not been released. MRAMP produced three reports – a summary, an 800-page full
  technical report and a report about the development of environmental quality
  guidelines. The results of the second year of the four-year project were used
  as part of a widespread and successful lobbying effort from the state and
  federal governments to dismiss concerns from UN advisers that ongoing
  industrial emissions were damaging some of the rock art at the site. The
  Murujuga site, which has more than a million petroglyphs, was placed on the
  world heritage list in June after the committee ignored the concerns of UN
  advisers. Mullins’ email was replying to Melinda Fitzgerald, Curtin’s deputy
  vice-chancellor for research, who had asked about concerns that a chart in the
  summary document had been altered. The alteration removed an aqua dotted line
  on the chart that showed a number of sites breaching an interim level for
  nitrogen dioxide. Mullins wrote in the email the state government and the
  Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation (MAC) had both “insisted” the chart be
  altered. The original chart remained in a longer companion report. Guardian
  Australia asked Mullins why he had said the summary report had “put a very
  rosy spin” on the findings, and why he thought the state government had hoped
  people would not read the full report. He replied “no comment”. Mullins told
  the ABC his project had agreed to remove the aqua line “for effective
  communication” and he stood by the research which was now “integral to the
  Unesco world heritage inscription”. Raelene Cooper, a Mardathoonera woman of
  the Save Our Songlines group fighting Woodside’s plans, said the release of
  the email was a “complete vindication of scientific experts and whistleblowers
  who called out a massive government cover-up as soon as this report was
  released in May”. She said a royal commission was needed to investigate
  “covering up evidence of industrial damage to Murujuga’s sacred rock art”,
  adding “someone needs to be held accountable for this”. A DWER spokesperson
  said the summary document was “developed to help publicly communicate the
  findings of a highly technical and complex scientific study.” DWER had worked
  with MAC and Curtin University on the document “through multiple drafts” and
  during that process “the graph in the summary document was simplified to focus
  on the interim guideline environmental quality criteria.” The statement added:
  “The full 800-page report is available to the public, and at no point have
  DWER, Curtin University or MAC sought to suppress the content of the report.
  DWER, MAC and Curtin University support the report’s scientific basis.” The
  Guardian has approached MAC for comment.
