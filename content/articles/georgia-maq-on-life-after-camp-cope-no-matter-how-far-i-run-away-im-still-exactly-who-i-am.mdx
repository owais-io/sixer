  This isn’t a story about a mouthy broad who moved to California and got
  gentle. But it’s not not that either. The musician Georgia Maq moved from
  Melbourne to Los Angeles two years ago, after saying goodbye to her band, Camp
  Cope, and working as a nurse for two years during the pandemic. The move was
  prompted as much by television (“I watched The L Word and thought, I want to
  live in Hollywood”) as an urgent need to not spend her entire life in the
  place she was born: “I was sick of who I was, really. I wanted a different
  life for myself.” When I ask how she describes to her new friends in the US
  about what her time in the Australian music industry was like, she tells me:
  “I say, I played in a band for eight years. We were an all-girl band and
  people never let us forget it.” I’m speaking to Maq over Zoom, as she sits in
  her car. She has had an especially charged day, after fielding a phone call
  from a film director who’s hoping to cast her in a “chaotic and insane” role
  in a freaky new movie. “Am I in my actor era?” she deadpans. It would be
  perfectly cliche for the transplant punk to land in LA and suddenly become a
  film star. Sometimes, Maq feels as if she’s “too emotional” for LA. The
  previous day she released the glittering, tender single Slightly Below the
  Middle from her upcoming EP, God’s Favourite, and called her Camp Cope
  bandmates, Kelly-Dawn Hellmrich and Sarah Thompson. They discussed Hellmrich’s
  upcoming book and the vinyl release of their final show together, at Sydney
  Opera House in 2023. The call “brought out a bunch of emotions because it’s
  like, no matter how far I run away, I’m still exactly who I am, and Kelly and
  Thomo are such a big reminder of who I am and who I was back then,” Maq says.

  for the weekend, every Saturday morning The three of them shared beds and vans
  and cramped green rooms and big stages for nearly a decade. The mirror they
  represent can be painful for Maq to look at: “We have good friendships, but
  it’s not as intense as it was back then. I wasn’t always the best person to be
  in a band with. And sometimes I get reminded of that when it’s just us three.”
  For so long, she didn’t know what her music was if it was not complemented by
  Hellmrich’s bass and Thomo’s drumbeat. She experimented with electro-pop
  production on her 2019 solo record Pleaser but since then she has found a
  comfortable and fertile space to play in country pop. “I’m a creature of
  comfort and I love a country songwriter,” she says, admitting some guilty
  pleasures in the form of male country artists whose reputations are anything
  but rosy. The irony isn’t lost on Maq: “I literally wrote The Face of God,”
  she scoffs, namechecking the Camp Cope song about how quickly people can write
  off abuse allegations if they’re levelled at a guy who makes good songs.
  Throughout her career, being Georgia Maq has often meant being a vector for
  people’s biggest emotions. She used the platform she had as the frontperson of
  a popular band to advocate for change – calling for festivals she played to
  book more female artists, campaigning for safer crowds and namechecking
  abusive men in the industry – and was often criticised, by Australia’s
  predictable “shut up and sing” crowds, by bookers claiming festival lineups
  were meritocracies, by people in positions of power who’d rather see a
  troublemaker booted out than have the focus pulled on their bad behaviour.
  “The music industry … taught me that I needed to fight,” Maq proclaimed in her
  keynote speech at the 2023 Bigsound conference. “I am proud that dangerous men
  in the music industry still warn each other about me.” “I was so abrasive and
  reactive, and I had so much pressure on me all the time,” Maq says now. That
  period of her life cemented, for many people, an immovable public-facing
  version of herself. “I didn’t really have time to think. I was just dumb and I
  was angry and now … I’m not that.” For years, she felt the expectation on her
  and the band was to make statements more than music. “That was really
  exhausting,” she says. Now, with time and a fresh start, she’s finding ways to
  let the light in. God’s Favourite, as the title suggests, is preoccupied with
  ideas and images of faith, repentance, sin and salvation, all set against the
  backdrop of swiping on dating apps, pretending you can be chill and have
  casual sex – then remembering, in fact, you’re too much of a romantic. “The
  song Citronella feels like 11am the morning after an emotional night where
  you’re just like, ‘What the fuck am I doing? I can’t keep doing this because
  it’ll never make me happy,’” she says. “I just put so much feeling behind
  everything. I can’t do a regular chill thing with someone. I’m not regular and
  chill. I’m insane.” Slightly Below the Middle sees Maq channelling a
  conversation with the devil, who invokes her late father, Hugh McDonald, who
  was a musician in the famed band Redgum. Maq was baptised in the Greek
  Orthodox church, but her parents didn’t instil its belief systems in her or
  her siblings. Still, something crept in along the way: she shows me the cross
  around her neck and moves the camera to capture the rosary beads hanging from
  her rear-view mirror. Sometimes she finds herself visiting Greek Orthodox
  churches in LA. “There’s a lot of standing up and sitting down and
  everything’s in Greek. So I have no idea what anyone’s saying,” she says – but
  when she goes, she feels connected to her late grandmother, who came to
  Australia alone at 13 from Nestani. “She never went to school or anything. She
  was just kind of nuts. But she really loved religion. [Going to church] is
  kind of my way to honour her. I go to be reminded of who I am, I guess.” The
  biggest story of forgiveness might be the one she’s writing for herself. She
  wonders aloud if maybe she’s in her “redemption arc”. “But maybe I’ve made
  that all up in my head,” she adds. “Maybe people don’t think I’m evil. I don’t
  think I’m evil, but I feel like I want people to know that I’ve changed.”
