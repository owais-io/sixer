  ‘When I was growing up, I couldn’t listen to any bands or artists in my
  language,” says Katarina Barruk. She is one of only a handful of remaining
  speakers – and the only one of whom is an internationally celebrated singer –
  of Ume Sámi, one of the nine living Sámi languages that today is on Unesco’s
  critically endangered list. It’s spoken by a handful of Sámi communities
  living across the part of Sápmi (the territory of the Sámi peoples across
  northern Scandinavia) that’s now in north-east Sweden. “We have been working
  so hard to get to the point where you can hear the language at the Royal
  Albert Hall,” says Barruk. “It’s amazing.” And not only to hear the language,
  but experience it sung by Barruk in her own music, recomposed and remade with
  the Norwegian Chamber Orchestra. They’ll be led by the violinist and conductor
  Pekka Kuusisto, in a Prom that will take the audience on a journey “into my
  universe”, she says, “so that people can understand that this language is
  alive”. The Prom is a symbol of hope and defiance for Ume Sámi and its
  speakers, and for the Indigenous peoples of Sápmi as a whole, she tells me. “I
  want to give something hopeful to my own people.” It’s also a big moment in
  her own life. “The whole of my family is coming. My brother, even. He’s a
  reindeer herder and he never has time for travelling, but the end of August is
  the only time of year he can leave. It’s really huge to hear the Ume Sámi
  language in one of the world’s biggest concert halls.” But for Barruk, the
  significance of the Prom isn’t only about representing her language: it’s
  about creating a new chapter of cultural survival for her people. Her songs,
  all in Ume Sámi, are based on joiking traditions, the traditional vocal art of
  the Sámis, and mix the joik’s skirls of high-register cries with melodies of
  depth and soulfulness. Her second album, Ruhttuo, released in 2022, was a
  fusion of a contemporary soundworld with timeless traditions. That’s the basis
  of the Proms collaboration, too: “I’m not only doing traditional joik in the
  concerts. My vocal practice is really affected by my personal exploration of
  how I can play my instrument – my voice. When I was growing up, all the vocal
  sounds I made were always supposed to mean something: a place, a person, a
  mountain, an expressive state. So I was always emotionally exhausted after the
  concerts. But now I can sometimes make sounds for the sake of making
  interesting sounds, and then it becomes even more fun.” But at the Proms, she
  will be singing songs “about dreams, about time, about being in the present
  tense. And there is one traditional joik, Miärralándda (Coastal Lands). There
  is also a piece about my great-grandmother, whose sister was one of the people
  who took the initiative to have the first Sámi gathering. I have strong
  foremothers in my family who have always been fighting for Sámi rights.”
  Barruk’s music is a parable of Sámi culture’s place in the world now. “My
  music is always affected by western music. You are always part of that
  society. The question is how much do you assimilate to fit in, as an
  Indigenous person? How much can you work to help each other and use the new
  ways that are available to lift up our voices?” That means recognising the
  fragility and threats to Sámi people, and to Ume Sámi speakers in particular.
  Neither Finland nor Sweden has ratified the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples
  Convention of 1989. Norway has, but Barruk says that it has continued to
  violate the rights of Sámi people. And across Sápmi, she says, “they are
  getting rid of the Indigenous people” to make way for mining in the boreal
  forest. Reindeer herders and Sámi people have had to move to make way for
  mining, and the environmental desecration that brings – and for wind farms,
  too. “When you are ‘green transitioning’, you are often getting rid of the
  Indigenous people,” she says. These are issues of survival and
  self-determination that are burned into the inspiration behind Katarina’s
  compositions and performance. “When I started making music, I always thought
  about my community, my people, my culture. I love them so highly and I know
  what kind of dark times we are living in, and how we are fighting on a daily
  basis.” So what can the musicians of the Norwegian Chamber Orchestra, who
  first collaborated with Barruk in Oslo in 2023, add to her searing music?
  “It’s amazing to hear the music you’ve written played by so many human beings,
  and how that changes the dynamic,” she says. The piece that comes after the
  song about her great-grandmother, Barruk says, “feels like it’s playing in her
  honour”. That music, Kuusisto tells me, is Max Reger’s version of Bach’s
  chorale setting O Mensch, Bewein Dein Sünde Groß, music that’s an exorcism of
  humanity’s sin and pain. Barruk, her band and Kuusisto share the stage with
  the orchestra in the first half of the concert, alternating her songs with
  classical and contemporary pieces from Caroline Shaw to Michael Tippett to
  Philip Glass, which Kuusisto has chosen for their tradition-transcending
  resonances. He says his choice of music is an exploration of how “composers
  respectfully re-read ancient knowledge and earlier traditions”: the way that
  Tippett reimagines Purcell in Sellinger’s Round, and how Shaw puts Ravel and
  Mozart in suspended musical animation in Plan and Elevation, analogies of how
  Barruk rethinks the ancient traditions of Sámi music. “Every generation has to
  reinterpret concepts that previous generations have taken for granted,” he
  says, “including things such as religion and nationalism, which play a big
  part in the treatment of Indigenous people worldwide – plus, are more often
  than not the driving forces behind war.” There are stories of oppression in
  Kuusisto’s setlist, too. Kuusisto will play Hannah Kendall’s Weroon Weroon,
  written for him in 2022, in which “you basically put the violin under arrest”,
  he says. In her programme note for the piece, Kendall explains that “the
  strings of the violin are bound together with three aluminium dreadlock cuffs;
  afro hair accessories that distort the sound so that pitch production becomes
  unstable and unpredictable. A new creolised instrument is formed as a result.”
  The violin is denatured, forced into sonic contortions: a musical mirror of
  colonial oppression. The second half, for the orchestra alone, ends with the
  darkness of Shostakovich’s eighth quartet, a scream of the individual against
  Soviet tyranny. Kuusisto says that working with Barruk has changed him and the
  orchestra. It’s all too easy for the culture of orchestral playing to become
  complacent, a job rather than a vocation, he says. But “when Katarina sings,
  it’s an act of preserving a culture. It’s an incredible thing to witness
  music-making in which the motivation is so radically different from what we’re
  used to. In fact, I would venture that we are not even so used to thinking
  about what the motivation is in our work in classical music at all. Which is
  why Katarina is vitally important for us, to make us think about what we are
  doing, and why we are doing it. It’s one of those experiences where we
  collectively feel we are standing on more solid ground.” For Barruk, “it’s
  huge and impactful and powerful that the Ume Sámi language has survived
  against all odds”, she says. “It’s alive even when it is not supposed to be,
  if the programmes to eradicate it had worked in earlier centuries. And that
  brings another level to my music, because I am able to sing in an Indigenous
  language. There is such a resilience within our people.” For one night this
  summer, Barruk and Kuusisto’s Prom will turn the Royal Albert Hall into an
  outpost of Ume Sámi and the people of Sápmi: their traditions, their hopes,
  and their defiant and urgent cultural future. • Katarina Barruk, Pekka
  Kuusisto and the Norwegian Chamber Orchestra are at the Proms on 31 August and
  live on Radio 3, and then on BBC Sounds until 12 October.
