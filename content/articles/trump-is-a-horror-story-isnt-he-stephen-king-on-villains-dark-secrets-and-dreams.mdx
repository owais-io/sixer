  I once entered a short story competition in the Guardian, judged by you, but
  failed. Is it simply a case of trying until something sticks? Or is accepting
  a lack of talent a relief over chasing an impossible dream? EvolAnth Well,
  it’s not necessarily a lack of talent. I think everybody has talent, but you
  have to hone it. The more you do it, the more you like it. And when you have
  talent, you want to do it, you know? You signed my copy of Christine with the
  words “Keep on screaming for vengeance” because I was wearing a Judas Priest
  badge. Is music still important to you? RobFrampton Yeah, music is still
  important to me. I’ve moved on from Judas Priest because I couldn’t get the
  rights to use the lyrics from You’ve Got Another Thing Comin’ for my [2008]
  novel, Duma Key. So I’ve moved on to Rancid, Nazareth, Anthrax and Metallica.
  I don’t listen to music if I’m composing directly from my head to the page.
  When I’m rewriting, I like to listen to club music, disco or something with a
  repetitive beat that flows through my head and goes in one ear and out the
  other. Today I was listening to some zydeco music, and LCD Soundsystem. I like
  North American Scum, Losing My Edge and Daft Punk Is Playing at My House very
  much. Do you still go to bookshops and sign copies of your books when no one
  is looking? Pampers If I can sneak in and sneak out, I do. I last did it at a
  bookstore down the road from me in western Maine and signed some copies of
  Never Flinch and You Like It Darker. I don’t really like book signings because
  you can’t do everybody. On my last book tour, I had to sign 400 books that
  were sifted at random from 1,000, so you only had a chance of getting one. But
  it was better than facing a line of people that never ends, where they all
  have two or three books. That’s tough. The word “prolific” is often overused,
  but not for your output. Is not stopping a choice, or is it because you can’t
  stop? JamesZZZ It’s hard to decide what to do with those two or three extra
  hours a day between 9am and noon. You can only watch so many gameshows on TV.
  I can go for a walk, but then I’m still thinking about the next thing.
  Basically, man, I’m entertaining myself. Do you still write all your books on
  Microsoft Word? otterley As a matter of fact, I do. Sometimes I will sit and
  write in the mornings in longhand and then transcribe it. But mostly I use
  Word because you can go back and fix things. I’m not much of a computer geek,
  so if I have a problem, I get my IT guy on the job. Why is something scarier
  the more legs it has? biscoff There is some truth to that. I just finished
  reading a British fantasy novel called City of Last Chances by Adrian
  Tchaikovsky. In it, there’s a monster in a hole in the ground, which is like a
  centipede and has all these legs. When they dump somebody into the pit, it
  grabs them with all its legs, punches through the flesh and chews off their
  head. So that was really scary. The thing is, they’re not like us. They don’t
  look like us. They are basically alien creatures, so it’s a little bit scary.
  Who do you read for lighter moments while on holiday? I re-read PG Wodehouse.
  LowerColon I don’t read PG Wodehouse. I have a tendency to read British
  mysteries. I’m reading one now called The Ending Writes Itself by Evelyn
  Clarke that’s set on a Scottish island. The people can’t get out and it’s
  pretty good. I’m studying for a master’s in English and my dissertation is on
  Holly Gibney’s transformation from walk-on character to heroine, covering all
  seven books. Can you help? Norahseel56 I sort of fell in love with her. She
  was supposed to be almost a joke character; a walk-on, so to speak. She was
  obviously hen-pecked by her mother. Her mother was very overbearing and her
  father was a dishrag kind of person. There came a point in that first book, Mr
  Mercedes, where one of the characters, Jerome Robinson, goes to Holly because
  she understands computers and they kind of click. That was the point where she
  started to become three-dimensional. The more I wrote about her, and got
  interested in her, the more she started to become confident and interesting.
  She’s still got a lot of inferiority, and she’s not married and doesn’t have a
  boyfriend or anything. I think she might be a virgin. I’m not sure about that.
  I haven’t explored her backstory enough, but she became very interesting to
  me. By the third novel she was in, she just walked in and stole the book. What
  is the furthest you have got into writing a book and thought: “Nah, that’s no
  good,” and chucked it away? stinky There was one called The Cannibals that was
  set in an apartment building and these people couldn’t get out. It was sort of
  interesting, but I didn’t know what to do with it, so I just shelved it and
  went on to something that seemed more doable. It was probably about 200 pages.
  You go until you can’t think of anything else to say, and that’s the end. Does
  Roland Deschain [the main character in King’s The Dark Tower series] wear a
  hat? In my mind, he doesn’t. My partner disagrees. Please settle this
  argument! jackbumby In some of the pictures he wears a hat. But I never really
  saw him in a hat, no. I’m going to an arts school and am thinking about
  becoming a horror writer. What part-time job would be good to get some
  inspiration? EagleDogCat I got some inspiration when I worked in a mill. We
  had to clean the place out and there were a lot of big rats in the basement. I
  wrote a story about that, and then I was off and running. I think any kind of
  a job that is manual labour – what in the US we call a blue-collar worker – is
  good experience for a writer. You don’t want a job where you can sit down in a
  clean, well-lit room and not have to clean up shit. If fear was a colour,
  would it be monochrome or have different shades? Simother I think it’s dark
  blue shading to black. You’ve got to have some colour because you have to be
  able to see a little bit. You’ve got to sense something and get an idea of
  what’s in the shadows, so to speak. So yeah, I’d say dark blue shading to
  black. If you had to invent an ending for Trumpian America, what would it be?
  herero I think it would be impeachment – which, in my view, would be a good
  ending. I would love to see him retired, let’s put it that way. The bad ending
  would be that he gets a third term and takes things over completely. It’s a
  horror story either way. Trump is a horror story, isn’t he? When I first saw
  Stranger Things, it felt much like a Stephen King novel. Do you agree?
  Meckastemeduck I don’t see it as a Stephen King story as much as some other
  people do. I think the Duffer Brothers give me more credit than I deserve.
  Like a lot of talented people, they grew up with my material. When they were
  young and malleable, they read a lot of Stephen King and said: “We wanna do
  something like that.” But they’re very talented guys and the story they have
  developed has a lot more to it than Stephen King. It’s got a lot of Duffer
  Brothers in it. It’s good. I’ve seen all the episodes. I like it a lot. If
  someone was to make a film of your life, who would play you? MorganFox77 I
  would love to have a good-looking leading man, but I don’t think Brad Pitt
  would do it. He is a lot better-looking than me. I’m a little bit on the
  elderly side now, so I’d say maybe Christopher Lloyd or – who’s the guy in
  Twin Peaks, the main tall guy? Kyle MacLachlan. I’m sure people are always
  asking you about your own dark secrets. Is there anything adorable about
  yourself that you’d like to share? Urrurrsh Can’t tell you. When another film
  or TV adaptation lands on your desk, does it instil excitement or sighs of
  despair? LP43TT I’m still excited when somebody makes a movie out of something
  that I’ve done. I was excited to see The Monkey earlier this year, and The
  Life of Chuck. I’m very excited to see [Edgar Wright’s remake of] The Running
  Man, which was filmed in England. I don’t write with movies in mind. I just
  write what seems like a good story that people and I will enjoy. Then whatever
  happens to it happens. That’s fine. I like the movies, but I think they’re
  different things, like apples and oranges, so to speak. Would you rather have
  the technology to teleport wherever you want, like in The Jaunt, access to a
  pantry which allows you to time travel back to a single point, like in
  11/22/63, or an unassuming shop where you can purchase your greatest desire,
  like in Needful Things? smilligan I don’t think I want anything to do with
  time travel because you’d mess things up. I’m afraid if I tried to teleport,
  my atoms would get mixed up with a fly and I saw that movie, so I wouldn’t
  like that. My greatest desire, what would it be? Hey, I’ve got everything I
  want. I’ve got two pairs of clean jeans in my dresser. The thing that I really
  like is – I’m sort of a shoe guy. I love shoes. I admire women because they
  get all these really cool shoes. I’ve probably got 20 pairs of shoes, man.
  Sneakers, little boots and things. When people see that, they’ll say: ‘Oh,
  that’s crazy.’ I bet there’s plenty of women out there that are going to read
  this who say: ‘I’ve got 50 pairs of shoes.’ I have very vivid and often
  strange dreams which my husband jokes are like Stephen King novels. Has any of
  your work been inspired by strange dreams? Katzahran I can think of one, about
  an abandoned refrigerator that, when it opened, was full of these flying
  leeches, and I put that in a story. You’ve said you don’t like February, the
  number 13 and doing interviews. Does this still stand? TopTramp There was a
  time, when I was a young and struggling writer, when I would imagine all the
  smart, witty answers I would give in interviews. Now I’m actually faced with
  interviewers like your good self, I’m just sort of stuck. I hear myself
  saying: “Um … erm … ah … er …” a lot. It’s a case of be careful what you wish
  for, because you just might get it. • The Life of Chuck is in cinemas from 20
