  Maëva Squiban from Brittany won stage six of the Tour de France Femmes after a
  32km breakaway through the forest climbs of the Livradois-Forez national park
  to Ambert. The 23-year-old held off the pursuing peloton of favourites on the
  final climb to claim the biggest win of her career and the second stage win
  for a French rider since the women’s race was rebooted as the Tour de France
  Femmes in 2022. Squiban, riding for UAE Team ADQ, attacked alone, three
  kilometres from the top of the Col du Chansert, and maintained her lead on the
  fast descent, through the bonus sprint and into the finishing straight on the
  Boulevard Henri IV. “When they told me I had a minute and a half [lead] I
  couldn’t believe it,” she said. “I mainly wanted to get a head start before
  the climb to the bonus sprint. Then I was hoping to be part of a small group
  from the bonus sprint to the finish.” Behind her, Kim Le Court was as good as
  her word at the bonus sprints and made every second count. The Mauritian took
  another four seconds, just ahead of the defending champion, Kasia Niewiadoma,
  to extend her overall lead. “The goal was to control the race, and then see if
  the legs were there,” she said. “After that, it was to take the remaining
  bonus seconds, as there was already a rider up ahead.” “We tried to close the
  gap to Squiban to try and get the stage, but it wasn’t going to happen so
  tried to get a bit more time at the finish. I couldn’t wish for it to be
  better, apart from maybe winning the stage.” The 29-year-old leads by 26
  seconds from Pauline Ferrand-Prévot and by 30 seconds from Niewiadoma, who
  leap-frogged the pre-race favourite, Demi Vollering, into third place. The
  first mountain stage included 2,475m of altitude gain over four categorised
  climbs, including the first category Col du Beal, and provoked significant
  time gaps. Marianne Vos tumbled down the yellow jersey rankings, dropping from
  sixth to 29th. Although the rest of the favourites stayed together over the
  top of the 10km climb, Cédrine Kerbaol and Niewiadoma tried their hand on the
  descent, but were recaptured at the foot of the Col du Chansert, the platform
  for Squiban’s solo attack. Vollering’s FDJ-Suez team-mate Juliette Labous set
  off in pursuit in the closing kilometres, but it was not enough to draw out
  any initiatives from the main challengers. Ferrand-Prévot, gold medallist in
  Olympic mountain biking, has been a discreet presencesince showing an
  explosive acceleration on stage one. Her stealthy performance is fuelling
  French hopes that she may break the nation’s 40-year Tour de France drought.
  The apparent anxieties from the FDJ-Suez team manager, Stephen Delcourt, over
  Vollering’s chances may be heightened by the prospect of a French rider being
  guided to overall victory by his nemesis, Visma–Lease a Bike’s Jos Van Emden,
  although the pair now appear to have ended their public feud. Friday’s stage
  from Bourg-en-Bresse to Chambéry has less altitude gain, but is expected to
  inflict yet more pain as it crosses the summit of the 1,134m Col du Granier,
  17km from the finish. With three mountain stages still to come, 132 of 154
  starters remain in the race.
