  Radioactive water from the base that holds the UK’s nuclear bombs was allowed
  to leak into the sea after old pipes repeatedly burst, official files have
  revealed. The radioactive material was released into Loch Long, a sea loch
  near Glasgow in western Scotland, because the Royal Navy failed to properly
  maintain a network of 1,500 water pipes on the base, a regulator found. The
  armaments depot at Coulport on Loch Long is one of the most secure and
  secretive military sites in the UK. It holds the Royal Navy’s supply of
  nuclear warheads for its fleet of four Trident submarines, which are based
  nearby. Files compiled by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa), a
  government pollution watchdog, suggest that up to half the components at the
  base were beyond their design life when the leaks occurred. Sepa said the
  flooding at Coulport was caused by “shortfalls in maintenance”, resulting in
  the release of “unnecessary radioactive waste” in the form of low levels of
  tritium, which is used in nuclear warheads. In one report in 2022, the agency
  blamed the leaks on the navy’s repeated failure to maintain the equipment in
  the area devoted to storing the warheads, and said plans to replace 1,500 old
  pipes at risk of bursting were “sub-optimal”. The leaks are revealed in a
  cache of confidential inspection reports and emails given to the investigative
  website the Ferret and shared with the Guardian, which Sepa and the Ministry
  of Defence fought to keep secret. They were released on the orders of David
  Hamilton, the Scottish information commissioner, who polices Scotland’s
  freedom of information laws, after a six-year long battle by reporters for
  access to the files. The UK government insisted the files had to be kept
  secret for national security reasons, but in June Hamilton ruled that most had
  to be released. He said their disclosure threatened “reputations” not national
  security. They were released in August following a further delay after the MoD
  asked for more time to review them, citing “additional national security
  considerations”. Nuclear warheads are fitted on to the UK’s supply of Trident
  missiles at Coulport where the missiles are loaded on to Vanguard class
  submarines before they head to sea for secret patrols as part of the UK’s
  nuclear deterrent. The UK’s nuclear weapons fleet has been based at Faslane on
  a neighbouring loch called Gare Loch since the early 1960s. Tritium is
  regularly replenished in the warheads to maintain the performance of the
  weapons. The Sepa files show there had been a pipe burst at Coulport in 2010
  and a further two in 2019. One leak in August 2019 released “significant
  amounts of water” that flooded a nuclear weapons processing area, where it
  became contaminated with low levels of tritium and passed through an open
  drain that fed into Loch Long. While Sepa said radioactivity levels in that
  incident were very low and did not endanger human health, it found there were
  “shortfalls in maintenance and asset management that led to the failure of the
  coupling that indirectly led to the production of unnecessary radioactive
  waste”. After an internal investigation and a Sepa inspection, the MoD
  promised 23 actions to prevent more bursts and floods in March 2020. It
  accepted that its lack of preparedness had caused “confusion”, “a breakdown in
  access control” and a “lack of communication of the hazards”. However, there
  were two further pipe bursts in 2021, including one in another area that also
  held radioactive substances, prompting another inspection by Sepa in 2022.
  Progress on completing the 23 remedial actions “had been slow and delayed in
  many cases”, Sepa said. “The events have highlighted shortcomings in asset
  management across the naval base.” David Cullen, a nuclear weapons expert with
  the defence thinktank Basic in London, said the repeated pollution incidents
  were shocking and the attempts to keep them secret were “outrageous”. He said:
  “The MoD is almost 10 years into a nearly £2bn infrastructure programme at
  Faslane and Coulport, and yet they apparently didn’t have a proper asset
  management system as recently as 2022. This negligent approach is far too
  common in the nuclear weapons programme, and is a direct consequence of a lack
  of oversight.” Coulport is exempt from civilian pollution controls because it
  is a military base, but Sepa said it was committed to ensuring the base
  operated “in accordance with standards equivalent to those in environmental
  regulations, to protect both the environment and the public”. Sepa said it was
  “satisfied” that Coulport and Faslane had made “substantial improvements to
  asset management and maintenance” since these incidents, which had not been
  repeated. It published data on radioactive discharges from Coulport and
  Faslane every year, along with assessments of the environmental impacts. It
  insisted those discharges were “of no regulatory concern”. An MoD spokesperson
  said it placed “the upmost importance on our responsibilities for handling
  radioactive substances safely and securely. There have been no unsafe releases
  of radioactive material into the environment at any stage.”
