  The Ivy faces legal action from a waiter who claims he was refused details
  about how the upmarket restaurant chain calculated his share of tips and
  service charges, despite a new law aimed at ensuring they are shared more
  fairly and transparently. The waiter, who asked not to be identified, quit the
  Ivy in June, claiming that he had been given an “totally unfair” share of tips
  and service charges, and is claiming constructive dismissal against the Ivy’s
  owner at an employment tribunal. The Ivy said it “absolutely refute[s]” the
  waiter’s allegations and will challenge them at the tribunal. The case could
  shine a light on how diners’ gifts are shared out at the Ivy, which is owned
  by the tycoon Richard Caring. It could also clarify what level of detail
  businesses should provide to their workers on the allocation of service
  charges, such as how their share compares with others’ and how their
  allocation was decided. The waiter, who worked part-time, claims he was
  allocated £46.34 in gratuities and service charges for 43 hours’ work in
  March, a sum that was later increased to £97.45. He claims that that share,
  which came from a total pot of £31,562 handed over by diners that month in his
  branch of the Ivy, was far lower than it should have been. The waiter
  estimates that he was one of about 43 employees at the branch – including
  waiting staff, the kitchen team and management – meaning that his hours would
  have equated to about 2% of the total worked by staff that month. Yet he
  received less than a 300th of the service charge and tips collected. The Ivy
  disputed his calculations, arguing they were inaccurate and misleading. It
  said it used an independent consultancy to calculate how tips and service
  charges were shared. Lawyers working for the chain said he was a “disgruntled
  and discredited” former employee. Under the law implemented last October,
  employers in Britain must share out 100% of service charges collected in a
  venue to workers there. It must be done in a “fair and transparent manner” and
  employees have the right to know “how tips are allocated and distributed”.
  Diners at the Ivy, which was spun out of the London celebrity haunt and
  operates nearly 40 restaurants in the UK and Ireland, pay about £21 for fish
  and chips and £4.50 for a cup of coffee. Caring is attempting a £1bn sale of
  the business, which is owned by his Troia (UK) Restaurants parent company. The
  Ivy said it had complied with the Employment (Allocation of Tips) Act 2023 and
  operated “a fair and transparent” scheme for distributing tips and service
  charge, which was “overseen by employee representatives and an independent,
  third-party business used by many restaurants in the hospitality industry”. A
  spokesperson for Troia (UK) Restaurants said: “We absolutely refute all the
  claims that are being made and will provide all the evidence necessary to
  disprove these allegations to the employment tribunal. “We introduced a fair
  and transparent scheme after consultations with staff that has been well
  received and is overseen by employee representatives and an independent,
  third-party business used by many restaurants in the hospitality industry.”
  The Ivy said it shared out service charges via a system called a “tronc”, with
  different team members allocated “tronc points” that determine their share of
  the service charge each month. However, employees are not given an explanation
  of exactly how their tronc points are determined or how they compare with
  other team members’. Diners at the branch of the Ivy where the waiter worked
  pay an optional 12.5% service charge, with some adding tips on top. The firm
  says card and cash tips go directly to the individual who was given them. The
  Ivy claimed that it was unable to give details on how tronc points were
  allocated because doing so would breach its employees’ rights. The law states
  that gratuities must be shared out with regard to a code of practice and says
  there should be a written policy available to workers explaining “how tips are
  allocated and distributed and what steps the employer takes to ensure tips are
  handled fairly and transparently”. Michael Newman, an employment law expert at
  Leigh Day, said: “This legislation was introduced to try and make the system
  fairer…This case could clarify if employers need to provide more detail on how
  they distribute the service charge.” The Ivy waiter’s payslips do not make
  clear which payments relate to personal tips and which to service charges and
  the company does not disclose how its waiters’ share of the service charge
  compares with kitchen staff, managers or other workers. It also does not
  reveal to workers how many individuals at a restaurant have shared the service
  charge. The Ivy has said that the worker “was provided with full details of
  his tronc allocation and how it was calculated, which included information
  which went beyond what he was entitled to receive pursuant to the relevant
  legislation”. The waiter had worked on and off for the Ivy since November 2023
  and said he sought clarification of his service charge and tips from last
  autumn and into this spring. He was given a warning about behaviour in April,
  which he claims included forgetting guests drinks and not emptying ice
  buckets. The business disputes those claims. He said that at about the same
  time he filed a formal demand for information on his service charge
  allocation, before resigning in June. The tribunal hearing is due in April
  2026. • This article was amended on 9 August 2025 to abridge a comment.
