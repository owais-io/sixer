  Football’s Financial Shame: The Story of the V11 9pm, BBC Two In a documentary
  postponed from last month, the former Liverpool player Danny Murphy says a
  scandal in which financial advisers allegedly caused players to lose millions
  of pounds led him to drink, drugs and gambling. He is one of the V11, a group
  of ex-football players including Craig Short, Rod Wallace and Michael Thomas,
  who say they lost everything because of the people they trusted with their
  futures. They tell their stories in this report that also looks at the wider
  football culture in which earnings boomed. Hollie Richardson The Repair Shop
  8pm, BBC One Lost memories of wartime and service in the armed forces are to
  the fore this week, as a leather jerkin, worn by female dispatch riders in the
  second world war, requires restoration, as does an old cine projector with
  precious footage of a naval officer stuck inside it. Jack Seale The Great
  British Bake Off 8pm, Channel 4 An influencer known as “the Yeastie Boy”, a
  Cornish drag king and a woman desperate for a hug from Paul Hollywood … Say
  hello to the 12 new bakers entering the tent. As introductions are made, they
  are set to work on the first round of tasks, which include swiss rolls,
  fondant fancies and a landscape cake showstopper. HR The Yorkshire Vet 8pm,
  Channel 5 While vet Julian Norton usually finds himself dealing with cats,
  dogs and, most of all, sheep in this series, occasionally there’s a wildcard.
  In this episode, a llama called Ozzy needs his attention. He requires surgery,
  but, with no suitable facilities available, Norton must improvise a makeshift
  operating theatre in the barn. Phil Harrison The Great British Sewing Bee 9pm,
  BBC One Movies week! Edith Head was a renowned costume designer who made the
  jacket worn by Tippi Hedren in The Birds. A high bar indeed for the team, who
  need to take inspiration in the pattern challenge. But the final task is the
  most terrifying: making a costume for a horror character. HR Resident Alien
  10pm, Sky Max The Mantid menace may have been neutralised but Harry (Alan
  Tudyk) has other problems: dealing with the hungry chirps of six alien tykes
  and their mother Heather (Edi Patterson). She is keen to rekindle their
  romance, but Harry – trapped in puny human form – has some body issues to work
  through. Graeme Virtue Film choice Sisters (Brian de Palma, 1973), 11.50pm,
  Talking Pictures TV In this 1972 murder mystery, Brian De Palma succumbed
  fully to his Hitchcock obsession – he even got Bernard Herrmann to do the
  score. Thankfully, he’s very good at it, offering up a warped tale of twin
  sisters (one sweet, the other psychotic, both played by Margot Kidder), a
  missing body in a Staten Island apartment, and a crusading journalist
  (Jennifer Salt) who lives opposite and is determined to solve the case. It was
  also De Palma’s first sustained use of split screen, providing double the plot
  and double the sweaty tension. Simon Wardell Live sport One-Day International
  cricket: England v South Africa, 12.30pm, Sky Sports Main Event The first in a
  three-match series. The second is on Thursday at 1pm.
