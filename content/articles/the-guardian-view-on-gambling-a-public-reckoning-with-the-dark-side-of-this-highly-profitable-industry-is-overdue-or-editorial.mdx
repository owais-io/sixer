  No one should be surprised that the highly profitable UK gambling industry is
  intensifying its lobbying efforts, with a view to avoiding both higher
  taxation and stricter regulation of its activities, including advertising.
  Establishing a presence, and a voice, in parliament is what the leaders of
  growing business sectors do, and have done at least since the 18th century,
  when the brewing interest began to shift from a loose grouping of MPs with
  family links to breweries, into a national campaign. In the five years since
  Michael Dugher, a former Labour MP and shadow culture secretary, became chief
  executive of the Betting and Gaming Council, the £11.5bn-a-year industry has
  seen off a Tory white paper that threatened to curb its advertising, and
  resisted pressure for the higher taxation that many expected last year. Now,
  with Rachel Reeves reviewing gambling taxes in advance of the autumn budget,
  and amid growing calls for ministers to be more active in addressing gambling
  harms, including addiction, the organisation and its supporters are making
  fresh efforts to influence MPs in their favour. This week, Gordon Brown threw
  his weight behind demands for higher taxes to be levied on an “undertaxed”
  sector, and for the money to be used to meet the roughly £3bn cost of ditching
  rules that restrict some benefits to a family’s first two children. This is
  the case also made by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR)
  thinktank, and both it and the former prime minister are right to stress the
  urgency of child poverty-reducing measures. The linkage between highly
  profitable gambling businesses, some of which are based offshore, and grim
  levels of deprivation, is powerful in part because high street gambling
  premises, including adult gaming centres packed with slot machines, are
  concentrated in poor areas. But calls for change are not confined to the
  political left. The cross-party, pro-market Social Market Foundation also
  thinks the industry should make a bigger contribution. Like the IPPR, it
  pinpoints the remote gaming duty levied on online casinos, with an identical
  recommendation that this should jump from 21% to 50%. Currently, this tax
  accounts for £1.2bn of the £3.6bn in gambling duties overall (including the
  national lottery), and the thinktanks are right that targeting this form of
  gambling would be far more beneficial than the harmonisation of rates that has
  also been discussed. Just as alcohol, spirits and beer are taxed differently,
  sports betting and gambling should continue to be recognised as distinct
  activities. Simplifying the tax system, which is a motive for harmonisation,
  cannot be regarded as the most important thing, when gambling affects so many
  lives in troubling ways. Taxes aside, the campaign being led by Labour’s Andy
  Burnham in Manchester, and Dawn Butler in London, for councils to have more
  say over the opening of new gambling premises, is overdue but no less welcome
  for that. Ministers should change the law so that local politicians have more
  power over planning in this highly sensitive area. Used as they are to betting
  shops on high streets, and football shirts emblazoned with gambling sponsors’
  logos, many voters are probably unaware that regulation in the UK is
  strikingly lax, compared with other countries. That is all the more reason for
  politicians to turn down lobbyists’ invitations, and focus instead on the need
  for a public reckoning with this highly profitable industry’s harms.
