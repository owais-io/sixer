  A former Homes New South Wales employee will stand trial next year charged
  with multiple counts of sexual assault and other offences. Darrell Sanders,
  55, of Windsor, appeared in the NSW district court on Friday where his lawyer
  entered a plea of not guilty to all eight charges filed against him. The
  charges relate to alleged offences that occurred across Sydney’s inner west
  against three complainants. The charges are: two counts of sexual intercourse
  without consent, two counts of aggravated sexual assault, two counts of
  aggravated sexual touching, one count of sexual touching without consent, and
  one count of intentionally recording an intimate image without consent. The
  court heard Sanders will face trial in the district court in Sydney in July
  next year. The trial is expected to last for two to three weeks. At the time
  of his arrest, when he was charged with offences against two of the alleged
  victims, NSW police issued a statement saying: “Police will allege in court
  that the man used his position as a NSW government employee to arrange for the
  women to meet him, where they were sexually assaulted.” Speaking at Sanders’
  arraignment on Friday, the crown prosecutor said of the complainants that
  “these particular applicants for housing are quite vulnerable” and had carer
  responsibilities which could be a factor in the scheduling and length of the
  trial. The crown told the court they would be relying on tendency evidence,
  which is used to argue that a person has a tendency to act in a particular
  way, though it was yet to serve the tendency notice to the defence. Homes NSW
  said it did not want to comment as the case was before the courts.
