  ‘Coolness is not a renewable resource,” says a contributor to this documentary
  about Vice magazine’s rise and fall. In the late 2000s and 2010s Vice grew
  from a punk magazine into a digital media empire by telling the world what was
  cool (more specifically by telling millennials, then in their cool-seeking
  prime). By 2017, it was valued at nearly $6bn; in 2023, Vice filed for
  bankruptcy. A man who saw it from the inside is TV chef Eddie Huang, the
  director and frontman of this film. He had a long-running show on the Viceland
  TV channel and says he’s still owed hundreds of thousands of dollars in
  royalties. Huang is also an advert for the best of Vice: fast, funny and
  authentic. The film begins with plenty of “you had to be there” stories about
  Brooklyn before gentrification, and interviews with early staff. This isn’t
  meant unkindly, but Vice Is Broke will be essential viewing for anybody who
  ever worked there, with its details about who had what job title and when.
  Clips show why Vice felt so edgy (like that time they took basketball star
  Dennis Rodman to North Korea to meet Kim Jong-un). There is also analysis of
  how Vice’s raw on-the-ground news reporting hooked young people who didn’t
  read newspapers or watch TV news. Then the mainstream media started sniffing
  around and there’s a funny story about the two worlds colliding. One
  contributor remembers smoking a “dip”, a cigarette dipped in formaldehyde,
  outside the Vice offices. He saw an older man in the reception: “I recognise
  that guy, it’s Robert Murdoch!” The hubris was epic. Huang says that Vice
  co-founder Shane Smith once boasted to him that he was planning to buy the BBC
  with Elon Musk. Huang, who is very, very funny, replied: “Don’t you have to
  buy England first?” Smith, who remains at Vice, is notably absent here. But
  there’s an interview with another Vice co-founder Gavin McInnes, who was
  kicked out and later formed the far-right Proud Boys. Then comes the sorry
  spectacle of Vice becoming uncool, at its nadir putting out puff pieces paid
  for by Saudi Arabia. But oddly there’s no mention of the New York Times
  investigation into the toxic boys’ club culture at Vice Media. • Vice Is Broke
  is on Mubi from 29 August.
