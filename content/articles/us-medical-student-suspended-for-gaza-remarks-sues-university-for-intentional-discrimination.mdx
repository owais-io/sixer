  Umaymah Mohammad, perhaps the only student in the US to be suspended from
  medical school for remarks about Israel and Gaza, has filed a federal lawsuit
  against Atlanta’s Emory University, alleging discrimination under Title VI of
  the Civil Rights Act, as well as additional complaints under state law. The
  lawsuit, filed on Monday morning in federal district court on Mohammad’s
  behalf by the Council on Islamic-American Relations in Georgia (Cair-Ga),
  centers on Emory’s alleged “intentional discrimination and retaliation” during
  disciplinary proceedings against the medical-sociology dual degree student
  last year. It names the university, its board of trustees and John William
  Eley, a dean at the medical school, as defendants. It has been filed in
  pursuit of “accountability and justice … [and] has potential repercussions for
  how student activists have been treated over the last two years in this
  country”, said Azka Mahmood, executive director of Cair-Ga. If successful, the
  lawsuit could lead to “stopping disciplinary proceedings for protected
  expression – and that this becomes more of a policy moving forward” – both at
  Emory and elsewhere, said Keon Grant, one of the Cair-Ga attorneys who filed
  the complaint. The school declined to provide comment to the Guardian on
  pending litigation. The suit alleges that the school’s disciplinary response
  to remarks Mohammad made on the news show Democracy Now! in April 2024 showed
  unequal, discriminatory treatment. On the program, Mohammad spoke about the
  climate on campus for protesters – including at Emory, where police used
  tasers on students the day before during a protest against Israel’s ongoing
  assault on Gaza. She expressed concern about an unnamed Emory medical school
  professor who returned from volunteering as a medic in the Israeli military
  and was “now back at Emory so-called ‘teaching’ medical students and residents
  how to take care of patients”. The investigation and November hearing were
  both “plagued by procedural irregularities, such as pressuring Plaintiff to
  admit guilt, altering charges, manipulating deadlines, disregarding
  institutional policies, and imposing disproportionate sanctions”, according to
  Monday’s lawsuit. Still, Emory found that Mohammad “violated ‘the standards
  and expectations of the medical profession’”, according to the lawsuit, and
  suspended her from medical school for one year, pushing her graduation to
  2029. Mohammad’s appeal of the suspension was denied. Both Mahmood and Grant
  said they knew of no other medical school student suspended for speech on
  Israel and Gaza. The lawsuit notes that Emory’s own committee on free
  expression defended Mohammad’s speech as protected by the school’s own
  policies, only to be ignored by the medical school. It also points to a
  settlement the school entered into with the Department of Education’s office
  of civil rights in the first few weeks of the Trump administration, in
  response to a Title VI complaint filed directly with the department last year.
  Former president Joe Biden’s outgoing civil rights investigators found that
  Emory “may have contributed to and at a minimum appears to have failed to
  respond promptly or effectively to a hostile environment based on race and
  national origin, including shared Palestinian, Muslim, and/or Arab ancestry”.
  This shows the school “was aware of systemic issues in how Palestinian and
  Arab students were treated”, the lawsuit asserts. Mohammad was recently
  notified that an additional complaint had been filed about remarks she
  allegedly made on Israel and Palestine. The school has not clarified the
  issue, but last year’s disciplinary proceedings also included placing her on
  probation until graduation – meaning an additional complaint may be grounds
  for expulsion, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit comes at a time when the
  current administration is wielding Title VI almost exclusively as a tool to
  allege antisemitism on high-profile US campuses, as seen in the 30 June
  announcement finding Harvard guilty of “acting with deliberate indifference
  towards harassment of Jewish and Israeli students by other students and
  faculty from October 7, 2023, through the present”. Though not as high profile
  as Harvard, Emory has an endowment of $11bn – the 11th-highest in the US,
  according to the Atlanta Business Chronicle. “I definitely think the new Title
  VI world we’re living in is much more challenging,” Grant said. “Still, it’s
  an important tool – not only to seek relief, but if no Title VI complaints
  were filed, it would lead to a kind of erasure.” The law, which prohibits a
  recipient of federal financial assistance from discriminating on the basis of
  race, color or national origin, “is now being weaponized to target student
  activism [on behalf of Palestine]”, said Mahmood. “Still, you have to [have]
  faith in the federal courts and the constitution – you have to give this fight
  your all, to get justice – and pull all the levers this great country gives
  us.”
