  An overnight Ukrainian drone attack on an oil depot near the Russian Black Sea
  resort of Sochi ignited a raging fire, as the two countries traded strikes at
  the end of one of the deadliest weeks in Ukraine in recent months. More than
  120 firefighters worked to put out the blaze, said the regional governor,
  Veniamin Kondratyev, as emergency officials reported a fuel tank with a
  capacity of 2,000 cubic metres (70,000 cubic feet) had burned before it was
  extinguished. Drone wreckage hit an “oil tank, which caused a fire”,
  Kondratyev said on the Telegram messaging app. Sochi, which hosted the 2014
  Olympic Winter Games, is about 250 miles (400km) from the Ukrainian border.
  Video clips on social media showed huge black pillars of smoke pouring out
  from the facility. Russia’s civil aviation authority temporarily halted
  flights at Sochi airport, as the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy,
  announced fresh plans for a prisoner exchange. Kyiv has repeatedly pounded
  infrastructure in Russia that it sees as key to Moscow’s war effort but
  attacks on Sochi have been relatively rare. The strike came as a Russian
  missile hit a residential area in the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv,
  according to the state emergency services, wounding at least seven people.
  Officials in nearby Kherson said Russia again bombed a crucial bridge, causing
  significant damage. In Russia’s Voronezh region, authorities said four people
  were hurt in a separate Ukrainian drone strike. As Moscow rebuffs repeated
  calls by the US president, Donald Trump, for a ceasefire, a Russian drone and
  missile attack on Kyiv on Thursday killed 31 people, including five children,
  and wounded more than 150 in one of the worst single-day tolls in several
  months. The EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, described the assault as
  “depraved” and posted a picture of the bloc’s flag at half mast. Zelenskyy has
  been appealing to allies for more air defence systems to rebuff the Russian
  escalation. On Friday, Germany said it would soon start delivering two more
  US-made Patriot launchers in addition to three Patriot systems already
  delivered to Ukraine since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in
  February 2022. Trump on Tuesday gave the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, a
  shorter deadline of 8 August for peace efforts to move forward, as attacks
  continue unabated. The US leader has threatened new economic sanctions if
  progress is not made – a measure long demanded by Kyiv and backed by EU
  powers. Zelenskyy said on Sunday that Ukraine and Russia had agreed to
  exchange 1,200 prisoners after their latest round of talks in Istanbul in
  July. “There is an agreement to exchange 1,200 people,” he wrote on X, saying
  the lists of individuals to be swapped was still being determined to “unblock
  the return of our civilians”. “Preparations for a new meeting” were also under
  way, Zelenskyy said. Each of the three rounds of Ukrainian-Russian
  negotiations this year has resulted in prisoner exchanges but yielded no
  breakthrough in reaching an end to the fighting. The Russian government did
  not immediately comment. The Ukrainian air force said on Sunday that Russia
  had launched 76 drones and seven missiles against Ukraine overnight. It said
  it destroyed 60 drones and one missile, but 16 others and six missiles hit
  targets across eight locations. Early in the war, the Mykolaiv region faced
  frequent Russian artillery strikes and aerial attacks. Even after Russian
  forces were pushed back in late 2022, drones and missiles have remained a
  constant danger. The Russian defence ministry said its air units intercepted
  93 Ukrainian drones overnight, including one over the Krasnodar region and 60
  over the Black Sea. Ukrainian authorities said at the weekend that they had
  targeted other key sites for Russia’s energy and defence sectors in
  retaliation for the recent deadly strikes on Ukrainian cities. The week also
  brought political turbulence for Kyiv, after nationwide protests prompted
  parliament to restore the independence of Ukraine’s anti-corruption agencies.
  Over the weekend a Ukrainian lawmaker and other officials were arrested after
  those agencies unearthed an alleged wide-ranging bribery scheme linked to the
  purchase of drones and other weapons systems. Pledging “zero tolerance” for
  corruption, Zelenskyy himself announced the arrests on X. The scheme is
  believed to have hiked prices by up to one-third in state contracts with
  suppliers. A previous, hotly contested bill that MPs passed in July with
  support from Zelenskyy’s Servant of the People party, which had made the fight
  against sleaze its calling card, had stripped powers from the independent
  national anti-corruption bureau, known as Nabu, and the specialised
  anti-corruption prosecutor’s office, Sapo. The changes would have brought them
  under the control of Zelenskyy’s handpicked general prosecutor, alarming EU
  allies and triggering a popular revolt. Activists in Kyiv, who had mounted
  street protests, on Thursday cheered the passage of a new law essentially
  annulling the measures, in what one demonstrator called a victory for “the
  values that our soldiers are defending on the frontline”. Ukraine was granted
  the status of an EU membership candidate in 2022 and the battle against
  corruption is seen as integral to its bid. The Associated Press and Reuters
  contributed to this report.
