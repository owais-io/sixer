  Two days on from the out-of-the-blue announcement that British racing will
  strike on 10 September, the widespread media exposure the move has received
  may already be worth significantly more than the loss to sport from cancelling
  low-key meetings at Kempton, Lingfield, Carlisle and Uttoxeter. It will be an
  afternoon when most punters are looking 24 hours ahead to the St Leger meeting
  at Doncaster. As a result, there is a raised awareness of the deep concerns
  about government plans to harmonise the duty rates for online betting and
  casino-style gaming products, which could, according to modelling commissioned
  by the British Horseracing Authority, cost the sport between £66m and £160m in
  annual income. There will be further coverage on the day itself to add to the
  balance sheet, the races concerned will be restaged at other meetings to
  minimise the loss of media rights income and the degree of cooperation
  required between the BHA and racing’s two biggest racecourse ownership groups
  is also a positive for the sport. The response of the main industry body, the
  Betting and Gaming Council, to the news was instructive, too. “Racing’s
  decision to reschedule fixtures was taken without consultation with betting
  operators, whose support for the funding of the sport is mission critical,”
  the BGC said on Sunday. “We are concerned that futile political gestures will
  only antagonise the government and frustrate punters, instead of delivering a
  solution to a shared challenge facing both racing and betting.” This followed
  hot on the heels of a suggestion by Michael Dugher, the BGC’s chair, in a
  column in the Racing Post that “any increase in costs gets passed on not just
  to the sport, through reduced spend on sponsorship, but also punters. That
  might mean worse odds, fewer offers, less generous promotions.” The same
  column also included perhaps the most absurd sentence to appear in the pages
  of the sport’s trade paper since Fred Done, the chair of BetFred, suggested
  that cutting the maximum stake on roulette machines in betting shops from £100
  to £2 could force him to close his entire high-street estate. “The idea that
  betting on horseracing is purely a game of ‘skill’ and not also a game of
  ‘chance’ is nonsense,” Dugher wrote. “How many punters back a horse because
  they like the name or the colours? If betting on horses were purely a game of
  skill, how is it that a 150-1 shot wins a Group 1 at Goodwood?” The
  weasel-word here is “purely”, because as far as I am aware, no one in racing
  has ever, or would ever, claim that betting is “purely a game of skill”.
  Instead, skill is an essential element of the process. Every horse has its
  chance and its price and the skill lies in judging one against the other. It
  is the complete absence of skill in gaming that is one of the fundamental
  differences between the two. Taken as a whole, the BGC’s response to the
  strike action is informative, because it should leave no one in racing with
  any lingering doubt that those traditional betting brands many still think of
  as “the bookies” are now just subsidiaries of global gambling operators, whose
  primary concern is the risk-free profits from fixed-margin gaming. The BGC
  wants racing to argue for no change at all – ie 15% duty on betting and 21% on
  gaming – when that is the one thing that is almost certainly not going to
  happen. The government needs funds, the Treasury has already consulted on
  harmonisation and gambling revenue is a blindingly obvious target for a tax
  hike. As a result, and as the debate over gambling duty rolls on towards the
  autumn budget, the realistic best-case and worst-case scenarios for racing and
  the gambling industry are almost precisely opposed. For racing, any
  harmonisation of duty, whatever the chosen rate, is the worst-case outcome,
  because it not only costs the sport revenue, but increases the incentive for
  operators to prioritise their gaming business in the longer term. The
  realistic best-case outcome, despite the sport’s calls to “Axe the Racing Tax”
  completely, is probably a small rise in betting duty – perhaps alongside
  possible reform of the Levy to ease some of the pain – and a much more
  significant hike in the rate for gaming, to reflect the increased risk of
  gambling-related harm. The gambling industry would regard harmonisation at
  either 21% or 25% as a huge let-off. It is the thought of a possible rise in
  gaming duty – perhaps to 40% or more that they willingly pay to access gaming
  markets elsewhere – that is keeping their CEOs awake at night. Racing’s strike
  will not tip the balance one way or the other, but it is a long way from being
  the “futile political gesture” the BGC would have you believe. And if that
  organisation’s chair thinks that a pacemaker getting loose on the lead in the
  Sussex Stakes means racing is little different from roulette, it is
  conceivably a sign they are starting to feel the heat.
