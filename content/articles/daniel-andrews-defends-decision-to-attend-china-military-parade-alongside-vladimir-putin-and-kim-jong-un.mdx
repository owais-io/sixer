  Daniel Andrews has hit back at critics of his decision to attend China’s
  military parade alongside Russian president Vladimir Putin and North Korean
  leader Kim Jong-un, saying it was a chance for him to “meet and engage with
  regional leaders”. The former Victorian premier, known for his interest in
  bolstering his state’s ties with China while he was in the job, was pictured
  at the ceremony on Wednesday and quickly attacked for posing with the
  so-called “axis of upheaval”. The Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian,
  Myanmar’s junta leader senior general Min Aung Hlaing also stood nearby in the
  group photo. The ceremony took place in China’s capital, Beijing, to mark 80
  years since Japan’s surrender at the end of the second world war. Live footage
  of the event also showed Andrews shook hands with China’s president, Xi
  Jinping, on the red carpet in Tiananmen Square. In a statement on Thursday
  afternoon, Andrews said he had been invited with foreign dignitaries,
  including the Malaysian prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, and former New Zealand
  leaders John Key and Helen Clark. “I’ve said for years that a constructive
  relationship with China – our largest trading partner – is in Australia’s
  national interest and hundreds of thousands of Australian jobs depend on it.
  That hasn’t changed,” the statement said. “And just so there’s no confusion –
  I have condemned Putin and his illegal war in Ukraine from day one. That’s why
  he banned me from Russia last year. “Further, my support for Israel and
  Australia’s Jewish community has been outspoken and unwavering, and I
  unequivocally condemn Iran for its attacks on Australia, Israel and elsewhere
  around the world.” Australia’s ambassador to China did not attend the event,
  with a junior attache instead in his place. It’s understood the foreign
  affairs department was not aware of Andrews and Carr’s attendance until media
  reports in the days leading up to the events. The prime minister, Anthony
  Albanese, said it would have been inappropriate for any government
  representatives to attend, noting Andrews was there in his private capacity.
  “None of my people would have sat in that position, as simple as that,” he
  told question time on Thursday. “What individuals do, very separate from the
  government, is a matter for them.” Greens senator David Shoebridge questioned
  the former premier’s decision to put himself in that position. “You would hope
  that you use your position as a former leader ... to push the world closer to
  peace, not join a military parade with a bunch of dictators,” he said.
  Andrews’ successor premier Jacinta Allan is due to take her first trip to
  Beijing as the state’s leader in mid-September, joined by five MPs
  representing electorates with large numbers of Chinese voters. In a statement
  after the photograph, she said Andrews’ connection with China was “valuable
  for our state”. “It is good for Victoria that Daniel Andrews is held in such
  high regard by the people of China,” Allan said. However, her deputy premier,
  Ben Carroll, broke ranks and criticised the photo. “Most Victorians will be
  asking: is it worth it for self-interested business purposes to be having a
  photo standing behind Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin?” Carroll told reporters
  from the Age and Nine on Thursday. “I think for the vast majority, myself
  included, the value judgment [is] it’s not worth that photo, and that’ll be
  the question that Victorians want answers on. It’s not something I would have
  done.” The former New South Wales premier Bob Carr, who also travelled to
  China for the event, chose to skip the military parade. He told ABC’s 7.30 he
  would have “avoided” being in a group shot if he were in Andrews’ position.
  Many state and federal Labor MPs were unwilling to go on the record
  criticising the former premier but several were shocked at Andrews appearing
  in the group photo in such close proximity to the two dictators. One state MP
  described it as an “absolute disgrace” while another said they were
  “disappointed” in the wake of Iran’s link to the firebombing of the Adass
  Israel synagogue and amid plans to host a Ukrainian delegation at Victorian
  parliament. One MP pointed to debate in parliament’s upper house last week, in
  which MPs defended Andrews against comparisons made to “authoritarian regimes”
  and Stalin, “only for him to go pose in photos with actual dictators”. Andrews
  visited the country seven times as premier, most recently in early 2023, as
  the first Australian leader to travel to China since the start of the pandemic
  and the announcement of the Aukus defence pact, visiting Beijing, Jiangsu and
  Sichuan. No journalists, ministers or stakeholders were invited at the time.
  Since quitting politics in 2023, Andrews has registered two companies,
  Glencairn Street and Wedgetail Partners, the latter of which he runs with his
  former senior advisor adviser, Zheng Mei, who goes by Marty. Wedgetail
  Partners trades as Forty Eight &amp; Partners, which has been with Andrew
  “Twiggy” Forrest to strike deals with China on importing “green” iron. Both
  Andrews and Forrest attended the Boao Forum, China’s answer to the World
  Economic Forum, in 2023 and 2024. Andrews is listed as both a founder and
  director of Forty Eight &amp; Partners. Labor sources said Andrews works
  mainly as a consultant with strong links to Chinese companies. They said it
  was not surprising given China was a focus of Andrews’ during his premiership.
  One Labor MP, who requested anonymity to speak freely, said it “made sense”
  for Andrews to attend the event given his business interests but question his
  decision to pose in the group photo. They described the footage of Andrews
  shaking hands with Xi Jinping as “priceless”. “Whether we like it or not,
  he’ll definitely be printing that one out and sharing it widely,” they said.
