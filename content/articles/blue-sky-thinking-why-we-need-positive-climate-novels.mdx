  Nearly a quarter of a century ago when I published my first novel, Haweswater,
  about the impact of dam-building in north-west England, nature writing felt
  quite different, at least for me. Several landmark novels about climate
  apocalypse and survivalism had been published, including Z for Zachariah by
  Robert C O’Brien and The Death of Grass by John Christopher, but there was no
  imperative to write about such things. These stories involved anomalistic
  catastrophes – a mutated virus, nuclear war – and they were very bleak. They
  resonated but also seemed unusual. At the other end of the scale, Ben Elton’s
  Stark had comedically outlined the nature of oligarchic greed, resource
  consumption, and the ruination we were hurtling towards, while the Bezos and
  Musk equivalents could head off-world – not quite so funny now. The public
  knew about climate issues, though terminology often stressed them individually
  – ozone depletion, greenhouse warming, desertification, coral bleaching –
  rather than total Earth systems breakdown. Disparate, visionary science
  fictions didn’t indicate a genre movement yet. There was a luxury of choice
  regarding stories related to nature – no elephant in the room (or polar bear),
  if you didn’t tackle climate-change concerns. In the 2000s, while the
  scientific data was righting itself from hacks and attacks, a whole spate of
  alarming nonfiction books arrived, forecasting the devastating effect of
  global temperature rises, mass extinctions, and the chaotic world that would
  occur if our trajectory of fossil fuel consumption, industrial farming,
  deforestation and the like wasn’t altered. Books like Six Degrees (Mark
  Lynas), A World Without Bees (Alison Benjamin and Brian McCallum), and Half
  Gone (Jeremy Leggett) sounded the doom gong, loudly. As a news-hungry
  novelist, I responded, wringing jeopardy from these predictions to create a
  dire, possible future. Full-throttle dystopian speculation seemed to be
  appropriate. I wrote The Carhullan Army, which imagines female paramilitary
  resistance in a Britain destabilised by flooding and politically fascistic,
  where rationing and population control are the new norms. Looking back, I can
  see this story arrived out of pure, exhilarated fear about impending
  ecological disaster, the repressive systems which could arise out of it and
  their effect, especially, on women. It was an attempt to ring the same warning
  bell, to create a virtual, experiential realm for the reader out of their
  propositions. Fiction writers were turning towards the situation. Cormac
  McCarthy’s The Road, perhaps the most horrific, cataclysmic fable of this era,
  while never explicitly naming its disaster, depicts, as George Monbiot noted,
  the extreme consequences of “a world without a biosphere”. A decade later, The
  End We Start From by Megan Hunter, imagines a saturated, desolated England,
  with migration south to north as characters struggle to control their lives.
  Water shortages, drought and expanding sands feature in Claire Vaye Watkins’
  novel, Gold Fame Citrus, where countercultural Californians try to get to
  grips with a brutal new wilderness almost too big for human comprehension. Too
  big for comprehension, regarding the world’s threatened environmental state,
  would become our existential sufferance. These issues were not, in fact,
  speculative, but live around the globe. The ensuing havoc and damages do not
  affect humans equally. The racial extrapolation of history and culture in
  relation to climate future is depicted in Tochi Onyebuchi’s Goliath. In it,
  the abandoned black population of an uninhabitable, cloud-shrouded America
  search for meaning, home, and connection. Who will suffer and how when the
  apocalypse descends as a result of society’s legacy, is one of the fundamental
  concerns. If there are positive human adaptations or consolations to be found
  in these stories, they are transitory, vestigial or futile – distantly
  circling birds, an orphan fostered in hell, precarious love, sorority. Hope is
  dwarfed or excoriated by the monstrous new reality of planetary vastation.
  Tracking forward from Mary Shelley’s The Last Man, anxiety around the loss of
  our habitat and safe, humane civilisation has been the operating key for
  dystopia. Cli-fi is now its own genre, and booming, its themes curated on
  bookshops tables. But is pessimism still the prevailing mood? Utopia, it’s
  said, is difficult to write and perhaps less interesting to read. “Whoever
  tries to imagine perfection simply reveals his own emptiness,” George Orwell
  asserted. Darkness is attractive in so far as it’s inherently dramatic to
  depict, provocative and recognisable. In the face of failure to politically
  cooperate, legislate and mitigate against Earth systems breakdown,
  nature-horror and environmental comeuppance might truly represent our feelings
  of fatalism. Perhaps dystopia serves a purpose, as a repellent. It’s difficult
  to know whether it acts as a cautionary tale, deterring people from its
  pathways, or whether it simply provides disturbing entertainment while
  endorsing the worst-case scenario. But is Orwell’s philosophy correct? Or
  might the premise be learned incapacity, a defeatist ideology that commits us
  to mess and devilry, rather than nurturing anything better? Might it hinder
  solution stories and contribute to a negative cultural paralysis? One man’s
  utopia is very different from the next woman’s. There have always been
  positive proposals in science fiction, too, such as the formidable work of
  Octavia Butler, which opposes the notion of destructive tendencies in our
  species and dares to dream up models of evolution. The narratives of
  Afrofuturism rise from experiences unlike Orwell’s, exploring themes of black
  identity and agency and offering alternative, empowered versions of the
  future. Who is to say what literature can’t be or do? So what is the fiction
  that needs to be written now? This is the question I grappled with over the
  decades of writing my novel Helm. Is it about signposting progress when it
  comes to environmental adaptation and damage limitation? Should writers try to
  offer a restorative or rousing spirit for the times we live in, an opposition
  to eschatology? Can literature actually be a tool to encourage something
  better – creating eco-topia on the page, so it might be imagined off it?
  Midway through the writing of the book, I took part in a British Council
  Nature Writing panel in Germany and this last question was asked by the
  audience. Robert Macfarlane, the chair, barely paused before saying: yes. I
  remained silent. Since the dystopian days, I had tried a hopeful version of
  environmental fiction, The Wolf Border, which is about nature recovery and the
  rewilding of Britain. A good kind of What If scenario, I’d thought. But its
  premise and its political conditions – Scottish independence and radical land
  reform – seem more fantastical and remote now than when it was written. The
  truth is, as I sat quietly on that panel, I felt corseted by old ideas about
  fiction: that gloom is our territory, that fabricators have a different role
  to factualists, that novelists aren’t obliged to help steer society out of a
  negative mindset. My luxury to choose an environmental mode felt hollow. ***
  For nonfiction writers, the presentation of issues and ideas is central. They
  encourage literal engagement with a subject. They can brilliantly advocate,
  use literature to protest and campaign for conservation. They might move the
  dial politically, like Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring did, prompting the
  creation of the Environmental Protection Agency. They can reconstruct biased,
  racialised environments as the cultural geographer Carolyn Finney does. In her
  book Black Faces, White Spaces, she examines the relationships between African
  Americans and the natural world, white privilege, historical access to and
  ownership of the great outdoors, broadening perspectives on the environmental
  justice movement. With fiction, it is harder to present issues without it
  being on-the-nose; there are so many moving parts in a virtual world:
  characters, plots,landscapes, themes. A story might foreground the
  environment, it might even be about the environment, but it isn’t a manifesto.
  It is galvanising to see writers such as Monbiot tackling the issues behind
  industrialism that drive pollution and depletion – neoliberalism, capitalism,
  the internalised narratives that make us believe consumer economic systems are
  set and unchangeable – then suggest alternatives. I’ve been struck too reading
  Wild Fell by Lee Schofield, which imagines the future blossoming of ecological
  work he’s undertaken in the same location where Haweswater and The Carhullan
  Army are set. I was struck, because I’d never imagined an optimistic vision
  for my home turf; it seemed like a literary gear I didn’t possess. How
  wonderful, this kind of righteous sightedness; how mindful a contribution
  towards systems change. And there’s a wild, inspiring proliferation of books
  written by women regarding human synergy with nature: hawks, hares, mountains,
  common land, rivers. These works begin to overcome the immense scale of
  fatalism. So can fiction. The Overstory by Richard Powers demonstrates the
  genuine power of collectives in the fight to protect nature. Barbara
  Kingsolver’s Flight Behaviour finds, alongside the shocking planetary
  transformation affecting all species, a beauty in transition. These novels
  invite scientists to shout louder and readers to participate more. This became
  the imperative for Helm. It is a book about a unique aerial phenomenon,
  Britain’s only named wind, far older than humans and perhaps imperilled
  because of us. After more than a decade of stalls, rewrites and
  re-examinations of the topic, I had begun wondering if I should imagine ways
  up and out of doom scenarios instead of just describing the conflict within
  them. The answer was yes. The novel tackles issues of climate change, but its
  tenor is different. Perhaps the very nature of its subject helped: air,
  levity, mercurial otherness. Nature narrating itself is not new in literature,
  but remembering that our human story is not separate from nature’s story is
  timely. The wind, whose biography the book attempts to capture, is a
  mischievous puckish storyteller, entertained by humans and impervious to its
  own destruction, so the tone is a bit “tea-party at end-times”. A beautiful
  indifference is one option for dealing with environmental ruin, if you’ve no
  agency to alter it. But the character of Selima, a contemporary meteorological
  researcher studying microplastics in clouds, is more serious and culpable.
  Selima has the weight of awful facts on her shoulders, along with interference
  from climate deniers. Her existential crisis is, I think, a version of what we
  all may feel as isolated individuals, given the overwhelming issues we face.
  Yet she remains defiant and collegiate; she keeps on going with her work. The
  end of her story is still speculative, but it leaves room for activism to
  triumph. There are lots of stories in the novel about how mankind has tried to
  control the elements over millennia, via industry and religion; how we’ve
  consumed and damaged nature as our “manifest destiny”. But there are also
  stories about ways of existing holistically, recognising our place in nature
  and its place in us. These are mostly the female characters’ stories; they
  prevail against bad operators, and they are companionable with Helm. The
  Helm’s-eye overview gives a whimsical perspective of human endeavour, our
  significant anthropogenic moment on the planet, our solipsism and minimalism
  in the scheme of things, and a sense of: what next? This allowed for a
  fundamental shift in spirit towards buoyancy and a rescaling. In the end, it
  felt as meaningful and right to try to imagine positive countervailing ideas
  around our ecological impact as the dystopias had previously felt. Helm is far
  from eco-topia. But I hope the book is a constructive offering for our current
  moment. I’ve always believed fiction can be vital in allowing readers to
  apprehend and experience other versions of the world. I’m starting to believe
  it can play a part in encouraging healthier visions of the environment, by
  depicting our benign proclivities, and imagining that marvellous natural
  phenomena like the Helm wind can be saved. Helm by Sarah Hall (Author) (Faber
  &amp; Faber, £20). To support the Guardian, order your copy at
