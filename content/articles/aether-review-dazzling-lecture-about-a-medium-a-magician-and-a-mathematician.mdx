  Aether review – dazzling lecture about a medium, a magician and a
  mathematician

  There are known knowns, there are known unknowns and there is Emma Howlett’s
  play, a smart feminist take on the mysteries of the physical universe and the
  eternal limits of science. If that sounds too weighty a theme for a night out
  at the fringe, well, Howlett, who also directs, has planned ahead and built a
  fluid, ever-shifting production that spins her ideas with a dazzling lightness
  of touch. This is pure ensemble theatre: you cannot put a match between Sophie
  Kean, Abby McCann, Anna Marks Pryce and Gemma Barnett as they weave five
  historical stories as a tight unit, breathing as one. Supported by a residency
  by the Hugo Burge Foundation and written with Summerhall’s Anatomy lecture
  theatre in mind, Howlett’s production for TheatreGoose exploits the academic
  setting by turning the audience into students (pens and whiteboards in hand)
  and the actors into public speakers, using an overhead projector to put them
  in the spotlight (neat lighting design by Ed Saunders). Two of the stories are
  unexpected; not the one about Hypatia, the ancient Egyptian mathematician and
  astronomer who was murdered by angry Christians; nor the one about Vera Rubin
  finding evidence of dark matter in the 20th century; and not the modern-day
  tale about Sophie, a PhD student drawing on data from Cern in the hope of
  breaking new ground, while her obsessiveness drives her girlfriend away. More
  surprising are those of Adelaide Herrmann, famed for performing the
  bullet-catch magic trick in her vaudeville show; and of Florence Cook, a
  15-year-old medium, hoodwinking a credulous scientific establishment with her
  messages from beyond. Howlett is intrigued by fiction as well as fact.
  Juxtaposed and intercutting, these stories form a collage of truth and
  illusion, one that embraces the existential fear of always having more to
  learn about an evasive universe. As concerns go, it is on the esoteric side,
  but Aether is never less than accomplished. • At Summerhall, Edinburgh, until
  25 August • All our Edinburgh festival reviews
