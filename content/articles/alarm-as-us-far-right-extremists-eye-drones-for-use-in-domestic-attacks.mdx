  Taking their cues from modern warfare, the far-right American terrorist
  movement sees off-the-shelf or home-built first-person viewer (FPV) drones as
  a critical weapon in their own future war against the US government, which has
  American authorities on edge. And there’s ample reasons for those fears: in
  the open and closed online spaces where far-right extremists congregate, talk
  is commonplace of how these cheap drones are revolutionizing current wars and
  will be the critical tools of a so-called second civil war. “The use of FPV
  drones in the war between Russia and Ukraine, the use of drones by terrorist
  groups such as ISIS, and the use of drones by violent criminal groups, such as
  drug cartels, give examples that domestic extremists may seek to emulate or
  learn from,” said Joshua Fisher-Birch, a professional analyst who has tracked
  far-right extremists of every ilk, for close to a decade. “Groups or
  individuals could potentially use commercial or home-made drones for
  reconnaissance purposes or in an offensive capacity.” Fisher-Birch gave the
  recent example of a neo-Nazi in Nashville who plotted to bomb a power station
  with a drone, but was foiled by police. According to him, there is already
  extremist chatter observing how criminal groups use the FPV as force
  multipliers against government forces. “Pretty decent study on how [unmanned
  aerial systems] are being utilized by cartels, some good insights can be found
  here,” posted one popular neo-Nazi account on Telegram, attaching a military
  pamphlet discussing drone warfare to its followers. “If you want to know what
  a low-intensity conflict, insurgency, or whatever term we’re using this decade
  would look like, just look south.” Multiple sources tell the Guardian that the
  FBI has major concerns about the accelerationist neo-Nazi sect on the far
  right – one calling for an insurgency against the US government – and other
  ultra-violent actors in the same ideological space, eying the use of FPV
  drones for domestic attacks. These same actors have a demonstrated track
  record of targeting critical infrastructure and planning high casualty events,
  with the current proliferation and accessibility of the FPV being a boon to
  those types of plots. More worryingly, evidence has emerged of military
  trained neo-Nazis with relevant skillsets having pinpointed the FPV as a
  potential tool. “I am a drone operator, one of the first in the infantry,”
  said an anonymous neo-Nazi and Substack writer who is an avowed ex-member of
  the Atomwaffen Division (AWD), a now defunct and proscribed terrorist
  organization linked to multiple murders in the US. “The drones the military
  uses are entirely useless when you look at the reality on the ground in
  Ukraine. The future is cheap, 3D-printed drones with a [high explosive] round
  zip tied to it.” Writing this year on what has become a niche and
  well-followed account, the same person openly describes his military service,
  details the future of drone tactics, and prescribes to readers exactly how it
  is useful to the underground world of neo-Nazis. “Next, you should have a
  drone,” he explains. “The FPV drone will be a valuable resource in the coming
  years, but it requires a certain degree of technical expertise (both in IT
  &amp; explosives) that most don’t have to safely manufacture &amp; use.”
  Within the more organized terrorist underbelly of parallel groups to the AWD,
  such as the Base, long the subject of a nationwide counter-terrorism probe,
  veterans and active duty soldiers like the writer are coveted and
  intentionally recruited as operatives. Last year, Rinaldo Nazzaro, founder and
  leader of the Base who is himself a former Pentagon contractor, offered money
  to any veteran willing to school his stateside cadres in paramilitarism.
  “Leave [bombmaking] to people who won’t end up killing themselves,” advises
  the Substack author and suspected serviceman. “All you need is a very simple
  drone with a decent camera, this can be used for reconnaissance from above.”
  The writer and claimed ex-AWD member, who says he was based in California and
  only left the US Marine Corps over the summer, never overtly directs readers
  on how to use a drone in any specific styled attack, but his former group –
  even after its dissolution – and its members are well known for earmarking
  electrical transformers as targets. Brandon Russell, the founder of the AWD,
  is a veteran who idolizes Timothy McVeigh and was recently found guilty of
  planning to destroy Maryland substations in an effort to take out the
  Baltimore power grid. Fisher-Birch first spotted the Substack and vouched for
  its credibility. According to him, the writer’s alleged background is not only
  “significant” but “violent white supremacist groups would find his drone
  experience to be useful”. “Extreme-right groups that promote violence look for
  individuals with military training and other professional skills that can be
  passed on to other members,” he said. Drone warfare, at the epicenter of
  modern combat, is now considered critical tradecraft for any military or
  paramilitary group. Extremists have for years kept an eye on their
  development, as both a surveillance tool and a weapon. As far back as 2019,
  the Base and its members discussed how drones could meddle with aircraft,
  while in 2022 another neo-Nazi group linked to a bank robbery posted videos of
  their drone doing “reconnaissance” on a “suburban [area of operation]” with
  images of a subdivision. How the FBI will effectively police the use of drones
  remains to be seen, especially as budgetary cuts to the bureau and
  deprioritization of counter-terrorism investigations on the far-right have
  become a hallmark of the second Trump administration. But authorities are well
  aware of the threat: the Department of Homeland Security issued a warning in
  one of its threat assessment reports about terrorist groups using drones to
  “conduct intelligence collection, to drop explosives and other items on US
  critical infrastructure for disruption purposes”. For his part, the Substack
  writer bragged about how his status as a former AWD member was known to the
  FBI and yet he was still allowed to join the corps. “There are a number of
  [neo-Nazis] in the military,” he wrote. “I managed to make it through
  [military processing] &amp; gain a security clearance despite being known to
  the FBI as an AWD member.” “The FBI has no comment,” said an FBI spokesperson
  in an email to the Guardian.
