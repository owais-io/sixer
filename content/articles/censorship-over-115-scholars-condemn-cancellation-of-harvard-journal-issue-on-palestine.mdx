  More than 120 education scholars have condemned the cancellation of an entire
  issue of an academic journal dedicated to Palestine by a Harvard University
  publisher as “censorship”. In an open letter published on Thursday, the
  scholars denounced the abrupt scrapping of a special issue of the Harvard
  Educational Review – which was first revealed by the Guardian in July – as an
  “attempt to silence the academic examination of the genocide, starvation and
  dehumanisation of Palestinian people by the state of Israel and its allies”.
  The writers note that the issue’s censorship is also an example of
  “anti-Palestinian discrimination, obstructing the dissemination of knowledge
  on Palestine at the height of the genocide in Gaza”. The scholars also asked
  for the publisher to apologize to the authors, commission a new special issue
  on Palestine and implement safeguards to protect editorial independence. They
  pledged to boycott the journal’s publisher and the affiliated Harvard
  Education Press until then. The special issue of the prestigious education
  journal was planned six months into Israel’s war in Gaza to tackle questions
  about the education of Palestinians, education about Palestine and
  Palestinians, and related debates in schools and colleges in the US, as the
  Guardian previously reported. “The field of education has an important role to
  play in supporting students, educators, and policymakers in contextualizing
  what has been happening in Gaza,” the journal’s editors wrote in their call
  for abstracts – which came against the backdrop of the devastation of Gaza’s
  educational infrastructure, including the shuttering of hundreds of schools
  and destruction of all of the territory’s universities. More than a year
  later, the special issue was just about ready – all articles had been edited,
  contracts with most authors had been finalized, and the issue had been
  advertised at academic conferences and on the back cover of the previous one.
  But late in the process, the Harvard Education Publishing Group (HEPG), a
  division of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, which publishes the
  journal, demanded that all articles be submitted to a “risk assessment” review
  by Harvard’s general counsel – an unprecedented demand. When the authors
  protested, the publisher responded by abruptly cancelling the issue
  altogether. In an email obtained by the Guardian, the group’s executive
  director, Jessica Fiorillo, cited what she described as an inadequate review
  process and the need for “considerable copy editing” as well as a “lack of
  internal alignment” about the special issue. She said that the decision was
  not “due to censorship of a particular viewpoint nor does it connect to
  matters of academic freedom”. The authors and editors flatly rejected that
  characterization, telling the Guardian that the cancellation set a dangerous
  precedent and was an example of what many scholars have come to refer to as
  the “Palestine exception” to academic freedom. “The decision by HEPG to
  abandon their own institutional mission – as well as the responsibilities that
  their world-leading stature demands – is scholasticide in action,” the dozens
  of scholars who signed the recent letter also wrote, using a term coined by
  Palestinian scholars to describe Israel’s “deliberate and systematic
  destruction” of Palestine’s educational system. “It is unconscionable that
  HEPG have chosen to publicly frame their cancellation of the special issue as
  a matter of academic quality, while omitting key publicly-reported facts that
  point to censorship.” Arathi Sriprakash, a professor of sociology and
  education at the University of Oxford and one of the letter’s signatories,
  told the Guardian that the special issue’s cancellation has mobilised so many
  education scholars “precisely because we recognise the grave consequences of
  such threats to academic freedom and academic integrity”. “The ongoing
  genocidal violence in Gaza has involved the physical destruction of the entire
  higher education system there, and now in many education institutions around
  the world there are active attempts to shut down learning about what’s
  happening altogether. As educationalists, we have to remain steadfast in our
  commitment to the pursuit of knowledge and learning without fear or threat.”
  ‘Assault on academic freedom’ The ordeal around the special Palestine issue
  played out against the backdrop of the Trump administration’s crackdown on US
  higher education institutions’ autonomy on the basis of combating alleged
  antisemitism on campuses. Harvard is the only university that has sued the
  administration in response to the White House cutting billions of dollars in
  federal funds and other punishing measures it has unleashed on universities.
  But internally, Harvard has pre-empted many of the administration’s demands,
  including by demoting scholars, scrapping initiatives giving space to
  Palestinian narratives and adopting a controversial definition of antisemitism
  that critics say is antithetical to academic inquiry. In conversations with
  the Harvard Educational Review editors, the journal’s publisher acknowledged
  that it was seeking legal review of the articles out of fears that their
  publication would prompt antisemitism claims, an editor at the journal said.
  Harvard is reportedly close to finalizing a settlement with the Trump
  administration along the lines of those reached by other top universities.
  Thea Abu El-Haj, a Palestinian-American anthropologist of education at Barnard
  College and one of 21 contributors to the cancelled special issue, criticized
  the university’s handling of the matter as yet another sign of institutional
  capitulation. “If the universities – or in this case a university press – are
  not willing to stand up for what is core to their mission, I don’t know what
  they’re doing,” she told the Guardian last month. “What’s the point?” A
  spokesperson for the Harvard Graduate School of Education did not immediately
  respond to a request for comment on the latest letter but in an earlier
  statement to the Guardian wrote that the publisher “remains deeply committed
  to our robust editorial process”. Last month, the free speech group PEN
  America also condemned the special issue’s cancellation as a “blatant assault
  on academic freedom”. “Canceling an entire issue so close to publication is
  highly unusual, virtually unheard of,” Kristen Shahverdian, the program
  director for the group’s campus free speech initiative, said in a statement.
  “Silencing these scholarly voices robs academics, students, and the public of
  the opportunity to engage with their insights. It also sends a chilling
  message in the context of the Trump administration’s unrelenting pressure on
  Harvard University and mounting political interference in higher education,
  including efforts that target scholarship on Palestine.” Last week, the Middle
  East Studies Association of North America (Mesa) and its committee on academic
  freedom also wrote a public letter to Harvard’s president, Alan Garber,
  condemning the issue’s cancellation as an “egregious violation of the
  principles of academic freedom and a blatant betrayal of Harvard University’s
  avowed commitment to scholarly integrity and freedom of expression”.
