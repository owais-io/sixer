  Across two frantic days in New York, Andrea Vavassori and Sara Errani
  repeatedly made their intentions clear. As the only doubles specialist team in
  a tournament that had banished the rest of their kind, they were on a mission
  to prove their worth by succeeding on the court. Shortly before midnight on an
  Arthur Ashe Stadium still filled with raucous spectators, the mission was
  complete. They triumphed in spectacular fashion at the reimagined US Open
  mixed doubles championship by closing out the star singles pairing of Iga
  Swiatek and Casper Ruud, the third seeds, 6-3, 5-7 (10-6) in a supreme,
  intense tussle to defend their title. Ever since the US Open announced its
  transformed mixed doubles tournament six months ago, which has been moved
  forward to the US Open’s qualifying week and rebranded as a shortened format
  with an entry criteria that overwhelmingly favours singles players, Vavassori
  and Errani have been two of its biggest critics. A wildcard pairing due to
  their victory last year, they entered this tournament determined to back up
  those criticisms by proving the value of doubles players on the court. As they
  have marched through the draw, many of their doubles specialist peers have
  offered their full support. “I think this one is also for the doubles players
  that couldn’t play this tournament,” said Errani afterwards. In a draw filled
  with many of the best tennis players in the world, Errani and Vavassori made a
  decisive case for the importance of teamwork in this discipline. They
  demonstrated the value of sharp, decisive netplay, strategy, formations and
  intelligence by on the court. They were always one step ahead of the opponent
  and they imposed relentless pressure with their suffocating brilliance at the
  net. After blazing through to the final without dropping a set, the title was
  decided in an incredible match defined by sharp contrasts, the teamwork,
  tactical nous and shifting formations of the Italian pair against the baseline
  supremacy of Swiatek and Ruud, who spent the night eviscerating forehands as
  they tried to pierce the Italian wall at the net. They then launched a
  spectacular comeback to force a final set match tiebreak before the Italians
  closed out the match. “You proved that mixed doubles players are smarter
  tactically than singles players, I guess,” said Swiatek. While the victors
  made their points clear, in many ways the US Open organisers also did. This
  event has generated criticism for a wide variety of reasons, from the way it
  disposed of the doubles specialists to the changes imposed by the US Open
  without any input from the players themselves. This tournament’s aim, however,
  was to create a bigger stage for a format the organisers deemed obsolete, and
  the interest it has generated is undeniable. Four days before the start of the
  US Open, a completely full Arthur Ashe stadium was on hand to witness the
  climax of an event that had become little more than a footnote in recent
  years. The evening began with Swiatek and Ruud ousting the top seeds Jessica
  Pegula and Jack Draper in the first semi-final. During their warmup, the
  on-court MC suggested that Ruud could win his first grand slam title by the
  end of the night and described Draper as a two-time grand slam semi-finalist.
  They were extremely jarring claims that underlined another significant point
  of contention: should this event be categorised as a grand slam title or,
  considering its shortened format and restrictive entry conditions, is it
  simply an exhibition? Perhaps neither of these definitions are suitable and
  this is simply a special event in its own category. While some teams, such as
  Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu, participated for the good vibes, this second
  night presented an intense, high quality evening of tennis. It is obvious that
  the singles players have far greater priorities, and they will not lose sleep
  over losing a mixed doubles event in their training week before the real
  tournament begins, but they are also intensely competitive and they each
  competed on Wednesday with determination and full effort. At a time when
  numerous global sports, such as athletics, swimming and even gymnastics, have
  introduced mixed-gender team events, this event is also a reminder of tennis’s
  failure to properly take advantage of one of its unique selling points: the
  fact that the top male and female players share the stage at the biggest
  tournaments. A distinct feature of mixed doubles, compared to those other
  mixed-gender events, is that the female players are more than capable of
  holding their own and making decisive winning plays against their male
  counterparts. For most of the first semi-final match, for example, Pegula was
  the best player on the court. In general, the two days of competition were
  great fun. This tournament included the unforgettable sight of 45-year-old
  Venus Williams tussling with Andrey Rublev from the baseline, acing him while
  trailing match point during Karolina Muchova and Rublev’s win over Williams
  and Reilly Opelka. A month after returning a 153mph serve at Wimbledon, Taylor
  Fritz at times struggled with Sara Errani’s 70mph first serves. Most notably,
  one year on from their triumph over a field of specialists, the best mixed
  doubles team in the world reaffirmed their supremacy by beating the singles
  superstars. For their efforts, they earned $1m prize money, a handsome pay
  rise of $800k in just one year.
