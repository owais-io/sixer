  greenhouse gas

  A study of one abandoned coal exploration borehole in a Queensland paddock has
  found it was leaking the same amount of greenhouse gases in a year as about
  10,000 cars – and there could be thousands more just like it. Scientists at
  the University of Queensland also monitored a second coal exploration bore
  that was emitting about the same amount of methane and was forcing groundwater
  several metres into the air like a geyser. The federal government has
  previously published estimates that there are about 130,000 coal exploration
  bores across the state in the Surat and Bowen coal basins. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email The discovery raises the possibility of major and
  unreported emissions of the greenhouse gas that, per kilogram, warms the
  planet 80 times more than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. Climate
  experts say because of its short-term potency, controlling methane could be a
  quick route to slowing down global heating in the coming decades. UQ
  scientists monitored one borehole in the paddock in the Surat basin for seven
  days using special methane-detecting camera equipment. The hole – about 100
  metres deep – was not visible from the surface and had been previously covered
  by dirt, but researchers were tipped off by a gas company doing survey work in
  the area. There was also no grass growing in a patch surrounding the hole. The
  camera detected methane being released at an equivalent annual rate of 19,768
  tonnes of CO2, if using a calculation of methane’s impact over 20 years. This
  was the same as 10,000 cars each driving 12,000 kilometres a year. Associate
  Prof Phil Hayes, a co-author of the research published in the journal Science
  of the Total Environment, said the borehole had been there for about two
  decades but it wasn’t possible to say for how long it had been leaking methane
  or at what rate. The rate of leaking could be influenced by the geology
  beneath and by the state of water extraction in other areas that can change
  the pressure of the groundwater, he said. A second and older Surat basin
  borehole that did not feature in the research was also monitored that would
  “erupt with water every 10 minutes because of the gas pressure building up
  beneath it”, Hayes said. He said the hole had since been sealed but at the
  time of the monitoring it was emitting at a similar rate to the first
  borehole. Hayes, of the university’s Gas &amp; Energy Transition Research
  Centre, said the modern standard for decommissioning exploratory bores was to
  fill them with concrete. The study said other boreholes completed by the “same
  combination of drilling contractor and coal company”, which were not named,
  were found to have a “bag of cement placed over the open hole near [the]
  surface before replacement of soil.” Hayes said: “These boreholes are drilled
  by coal exploration companies. They can be done in one day and they tell the
  company about the quality of the coal or how it changes from one area to the
  next.” While there were an estimated 130,000 coal boreholes in Queensland,
  Hayes said he thought only a fraction were likely leaking. “What we have
  uncovered is a further source of methane that needs to be taken into account
  in our greenhouse accounts but it’s something that is easy for us to manage,”
  he said. “It requires some action by the government and exploration companies
  to identify and then plug these holes. If we’re trying to work on climate
  change in the next decade, then we would do well to focus on methane as well
  as carbon dioxide.” A spokesperson for the Queensland government’s natural
  resources and mines department said the state’s regulations “require petroleum
  and coal companies to plug, cap and fully remediate any boreholes and wells
  they abandon to prevent legacy boreholes and fugitive gas emissions”. “The
  issue of historic legacy coal exploration boreholes is more complex. These
  would have been drilled and abandoned prior to government introducing more
  stringent and detailed borehole drilling and abandonment requirements. “In
  many cases, these old boreholes may not have been properly mapped and the
  resource company that drilled and abandoned them no longer exists. “When the
  department becomes aware of a significant community health and safety risk
  associated with a legacy coal borehole, it is assessed to determine whether
  remediation is required.” The Guardian contacted the Queensland Resources
  Council for comment.
