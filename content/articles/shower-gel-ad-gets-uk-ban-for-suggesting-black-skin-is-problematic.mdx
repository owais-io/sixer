  A television advert for Sanex shower gel has been banned in the UK for
  appearing to suggest that black skin is “problematic” and white skin is
  “superior”. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) acted after
  investigating two complaints that the ad fed negative stereotypes about people
  with darker skin tones. The ad, broadcast in June, included a voiceover that
  said: “To those who might scratch day and night. To those whose skin will feel
  dried out even by water,” alongside scenes of a black woman with red scratch
  marks and another covered with a cracked clay-like material. The ad then
  showed a white woman taking a shower with the product, and stated: “Try to
  take a shower with the new Sanex skin therapy and its patented amino acid
  complex. For 24-hour hydration feel.” It ended with text and the voiceover
  stating: “Relief could be as simple as a shower.” The UK arm of
  Colgate-Palmolive, the $68bn (£54.4bn) US consumer goods group that owns the
  Sanex brand, argued that its ad did not perpetuate negative racial stereotypes
  and was unlikely to cause serious or widespread offence. It said the ad
  illustrated a “before and after” effect, and that the models demonstrated the
  product was suitable and effective for everyone. It told the regulator that
  when the model with darker skin was depicted, her skin tone was not a focal
  point. Clearcast, a body that approves or rejects ads for broadcast on
  television, also argued that the Sanex ad did not perpetuate negative racial
  stereotypes but demonstrated the product’s inclusivity. However, the ASA said
  the use of different skin colours as a means of portraying a “before and
  after” created a negative comparison. The watchdog said the ad was “structured
  in such a way that it was the black skin … which was shown to be problematic
  and uncomfortable, whereas the white skin, depicted as smoother and clean
  after using the product, was shown successfully changed and resolved”. The ASA
  added that although it understood that message was not intended and may pass
  unnoticed by some viewers, it considered “the ad was likely to reinforce the
  negative and offensive racial stereotype that black skin was problematic and
  that white skin was superior. “We concluded that the ad included a racial
  stereotype and was therefore likely to cause serious offence,” it said. The
  regulator told Colgate-Palmolive that it must not show the ads again in their
  current form “to ensure they avoided causing serious offence on the grounds of
  race”. Colgate-Palmolive was approached for comment. Earlier this week the ASA
  issued a plea to advertisers to stop using “irresponsible” images of
  unhealthily thin-looking models. In 2024 it received 61 complaints about the
  size of models in adverts, and it has reported that 45% of the public are
  concerned about ads that include idealised body images of women.
