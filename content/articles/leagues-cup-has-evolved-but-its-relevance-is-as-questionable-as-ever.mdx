  It feels like a fever dream, at this point. In the summer of 2023, Lionel
  Messi positioned himself over a free kick wearing the pink-and-white colors of
  Major League Soccer’s Inter Miami. Messi’s move to the United States had been
  long-rumored but often dismissed as wild speculation. The league was still a
  backwater compared to many in Europe and its clubs simply didn’t have the
  financial muscle of others vying for the Argentine’s services. Yet MLS had
  moved heaven and earth to land Messi, and here he was, playing in front of
  celebrities, fans and millions of viewers at home and abroad. Deep into the
  second half of Miami’s match against Liga MX side Cruz Azul, Messi used one
  stroke of his left foot to transport everybody in attendance back to his glory
  days at Barcelona. His free kick propelled Inter Miami to victory that day,
  and his brilliance over the ensuing month propelled them to an eventual
  Leagues Cup title. To this day, Messi’s free kick remains an iconic goal in
  league history, and among MLS’ most widely-consumed ones (it’s currently the
  fourth most-viewed goal on MLS’ YouTube profile, behind Zlatan Ibrahimović’s
  debut goal for the Galaxy, Wayne Rooney’s tackle and assist, and David
  Beckham’s Olimpico). At the time, it certainly felt like a watershed moment
  for the league, and a pivotal moment for Leagues Cup. Many who watched Messi’s
  masterstroke had never heard of Leagues Cup, MLS and Liga MX’s now-annual
  mid-season tournament. The joint venture was the latest in a long line of
  attempts by both leagues to capitalize on the long-simmering rivalry between
  Mexican and American clubs, and to capitalize on the massive market of
  Hispanic consumers in the United States. Now entering its third year, it feels
  fair to wonder who is actually asking for this thing. Its fundamental flaws
  became apparent last year, when an injured Messi was unable to participate and
  his presence could no longer mask them. The tournament takes place entirely in
  the United States, which leads to rightful questions about competitive balance
  and sometimes-empty stadiums. The value of the US-Mexico rivalry has also felt
  on the decline, appearing strongly only in matchups between the continent’s
  biggest clubs and, naturally, its national teams. MLS and Liga MX have fixed a
  few of the tournament’s other critical issues, successfully tweaking the
  tournament’s format to require early matchups between MLS and LigaMX teams,
  only admitting competitive sides from each league, and eliminating draws
  entirely. There is real prize money at stake (thought to be around $2m for the
  winner), and a handful of berths to Concacaf Champions Cup, the region’s
  continental club championship and the entry point into the Fifa Club World
  Cup. MLS also no longer fully pauses its league schedule for the run of the
  tournament, giving eliminated teams a chance to soldier on in regular season
  play and offering fans who couldn’t care less about the tournament an
  opportunity to stay engaged with their clubs. But as the tournament evolves,
  the landscape around it has too. America has long been viewed as global
  football’s ATM, a massive country with a soccer-starved populous and unmatched
  spending power. For over a decade, clubs and sometimes entire competitions
  have migrated stateside in search of to raise capital and brand awareness.
  That exercise reached new heights of absurdity this summer with the arrival of
  the Club World Cup. The tournament was a mixed bag – unquestionably exciting
  at times but also widely viewed as a purely commercial exercise. By the time
  Chelsea (and US President Donald Trump) hoisted the trophy, many viewers had
  already moved on. Three MLS clubs participated in the tournament, pausing an
  already-congested league schedule to measure themselves against legitimate
  international competition. It’s largely the same value that Major League
  Soccer argues they have created with Leagues Cup – that the tournament gives
  its clubs a chance to measure themselves against Mexican clubs that have long
  been viewed as the best in the region. Beyond all of this, there’s also the
  problem that MLS always faces, maybe unfairly: almost any new endeavor it
  attempts will be met with open disdain from consumers of the sport at home and
  abroad, labeled synthetic or tossed aside as a cash-grab. That criticism is
  impossible to avoid when you’re constantly reinventing yourself and constantly
  adjusting your product in search of profitability and relevance. Leagues Cup,
  created out of thin air, certainly fits that bill. It’s a point driven home
  perfectly by the dwindling relevance of the US Open Cup, which at this point
  is among the only truly authentic products in American soccer. As MLS has
  pumped resources into raising the profile of its own nascent tournament, the
  Open Cup has continued to fade further into the recesses of the public
  consciousness, even as it has the potential to reach more locales in the US
  than any other pro-level competition. It would be unfair to label Leagues Cup
  a failure before it finishes its third edition. A better time to accurately
  judge its success may be towards the end of this decade, after the tournament
  has had an opportunity to mature a bit and after the upcoming men’s and
  women’s World Cups have come and gone. MLS and Liga MX will surely continue to
  tinker with it in the meantime, aiming to make it something consumers in the
  US actually care about. It’s what MLS does best, after all. 30 years in, the
  league itself remains a work in progress, tinkering with its own formula in an
  attempt to finally thrust itself firmly into the collective consciousness. In
  some ways, it’s succeeded. It remains to be seen whether it can do the same
  for Leagues Cup.
