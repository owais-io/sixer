  The British screenwriter Steven Knight has been tapped to write the next James
  Bond movie. According to Deadline, Knight recently met the director Denis
  Villeneuve and landed the job after various other writers were also
  considered. Villeneuve is currently filming the third Dune instalment. Knight
  told the BBC: “It has always been on my bucket list and it’s fantastic to be
  invited to do it – I can’t wait to get started. “I’m hoping that, being a Bond
  fan for so many years, it will be imbued into me and I will be able to produce
  something that’s the same but different, and better, stronger and bolder.”
  Knight also said he “can’t give you the answer to” who might be in line to
  succeed Daniel Craig as 007. The 65-year-old writer is best known for
  co-creating the long-running gameshow Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? and
  creating the hit crime series Peaky Blinders. His other small-screen credits
  include Taboo, A Thousand Blows and The Veil starring Elisabeth Moss. On the
  big screen, Knight was written the scripts for the acclaimed dramas Eastern
  Promises, Dirty Pretty Things, Locke and Spencer. He also wrote and directed
  the sci-fi thriller Serenity starring Matthew McConaughey, which received
  negative reviews. The Guardian’s Charles Bramesco called it “magnificently
  terrible”. His upcoming credits include the Peaky Blinders movie The Immortal
  Man and period drama series House of Guinness for Netflix. When talking about
  The Immortal Man in 2023, Knight name-checked 007. “The biggest difference
  between a film and TV series is the budget,” he said to the Mirror. “When you
  do stuff for TV, you often have to ask people to imagine it. But with a film,
  you can really do it. You can blow stuff up. Will Tommy be giving James Bond a
  run for his money? Maybe. There are parallels. We always thought of Peaky as
  very cinematic, so we are finally finding a screen big enough for what we want
  to do.” While the role of James Bond remains up in the air, a June report
  claimed that Tom Holland, Harris Dickinson and Jacob Elordi were top of the
  wishlist. The news came just after the Dune and Arrival director Villeneuve
  was officially attached. “I intend to honour the tradition and open the path
  for many new missions to come,” he said in a statement. “This is a massive
  responsibility, but also, incredibly exciting for me and a huge honour.” The
  26th Bond film will follow Daniel Craig’s final outing, No Time to Die, which
  made over $774m at the global box office. Earlier this year, in a reported
  $1bn deal, Amazon MGM bought the rights to gain “creative control” of the
  franchise. This week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy mentioned the film during a Q3
  earnings call. “James Bond is in the hands of one of today’s greatest
  film-makers,”he said. “We cannot wait to get started on 007’s next adventure.”
