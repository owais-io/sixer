  The head of the British armed forces will tell his American counterparts the
  UK is prepared to send troops to defend Ukraine’s skies and seas but not to
  the frontline with Russia, as planning intensifies for a postwar settlement.
  Tony Radakin, the chief of the defence staff, will on Wednesday attend
  meetings at the Pentagon designed to finalise what 30 different countries are
  willing to commit to Ukraine’s national security. Radakin is expected to
  confirm the UK will provide soldiers to help with logistical support and
  training, but not deploy them close to Russia. Officials had been talking
  about deploying as many as 30,000 troops to protect Ukrainian sites, but that
  has been scaled back amid opposition from some European countries. One British
  official said: “Wednesday is a really important moment. Nothing happens in
  Washington without the president giving the green light, so Trump giving his
  support to security guarantees on Monday kickstarted a lot of activity.”
  Another said Radakin would echo the pledges made last week by John Healey, the
  defence secretary, who said Britain was willing to deploy troops to Ukraine
  “to secure the safe skies, safe seas and to build the strength of the
  Ukrainian forces”. They said ministers envisaged this as meaning logistical
  and training support rather than sending battalions of frontline troops who
  could end up in combat. Wednesday’s meetings are being seen in Europe as a
  major step towards securing a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, which
  Keir Starmer has said will only be possible if the US is willing to provide
  security guarantees. Donald Trump, the US president, told Starmer and other
  world leaders on Monday he would be willing to provide those guarantees. His
  Ukraine envoy, Steve Witkoff, has suggested they could be “article-5 like”
  reassurances, referring to the Nato clause that says that an attack on one
  member should be interpreted as an attack on all. Starmer hosted a virtual
  call on Tuesday morning to brief more than 30 other world leaders on what had
  been discussed at the White House on Monday. Downing Street said afterwards:
  “The prime minister outlined that coalition of the willing planning teams
  would meet with their US counterparts in the coming days to further strengthen
  plans to deliver robust security guarantees and prepare for the deployment of
  a reassurance force if the hostilities ended.” Wednesday’s planning sessions
  at the Pentagon are being closely watched for any signs of what the US would
  be willing to commit. Trump insisted on Tuesday they would not involve
  American troops on the ground, telling Fox News: “You have my assurance [on
  that], and I’m president.” But Britain is also planning to use the meetings to
  spell out to the Trump administration what it is willing to do to protect
  Ukraine should a peace deal be signed. Officials say British forces could be
  deployed to help with logistics in protecting Ukrainian airspace and ports,
  but not into situations that could risk combat with Russia. Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, said on Tuesday that he expected the
  security guarantees to be finalised in the next “week or 10 days”. Some
  experts say that European leaders do not expect Vladimir Putin to accept even
  such a limited deployment of Nato troops into Ukraine, and that European
  leaders are floating the idea to isolate the Russian president. British
  officials insist this is not the case however, and that the UK and its
  partners are making serious preparations to send forces into the country
  should they be needed. “You don’t get 30 chiefs of staff coming to the
  Pentagon if they are not serious about this,” said one.
