  One of the world’s most prominent hedge fund billionaires has warned that
  rising inequality is turning the US into an autocratic state and condemned
  business leaders for failing to speak out against Donald Trump’s policies. Ray
  Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, said “gaps in wealth” and a
  collapse in trust were driving “more extreme” policies in the US. Speaking to
  the Financial Times, the veteran financier said many western countries were
  affected by growing inequality, leading voters to turn increasingly to
  autocratic leaders. “I think that what is happening now politically and
  socially is analogous to what happened around the world in the 1930-40
  period,” he said. “Classically, increased wealth and value gaps lead to
  increased populism of the right and populism of the left and irreconcilable
  differences between them that can’t be resolved through the democratic
  process. “So democracies weaken and more autocratic leadership increases as a
  large percentage of the population wants government leaders to get control of
  the system to make things work well for them.” Concerns about a significant
  rise in borrrowing by the US government were well founded, said Dalio, who has
  long predicted a reckoning for economies that allow debts to rise. In his
  books, Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order and How Countries
  Go Broke: the Big Cycle, he has described how large annual spending deficits
  and unsustainable debt growth had brought the US economy to the brink of a
  debt crisis – a situation that had worsened over many years. “The great
  excesses that are now projected as a result of the new budget will likely
  cause a debt-induced heart attack in the relatively near future,” he said.
  “I’d say three years, give or take a year or two.” He also expressed alarm at
  Trump’s interference in the decisions of the central bank and the buying of
  shares in corporations to further his “Made in America” programme. The US
  president wants the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in an effort to
  boost economic growth and combat rising unemployment. But the Fed’s chair, Jay
  Powell, has warned the president’s import tariff increases could push up
  prices with the effect that investors will sell US financial assets rather
  than see them devalued. Dalio said attacks on the Fed “would undermine the
  confidence in the Fed defending the value of money and make holding
  dollar-denominated debt assets less attractive which would weaken the monetary
  order as we know it”. “I am just describing the cause and effect relationships
  that are driving what is happening,” he said. “And by the way, during such
  times most people are silent because they are afraid of retaliation if they
  criticise.” Dalio, who is worth about $19bn (£14bn), started Bridgewater in
  1975 and built the firm over decades to manage about $170bn of investor funds,
  according to the latest filings.
