  Released violent offenders to be ‘locked’ in restriction zones in England and
  Wales

  Restriction zones aimed at “locking” violent offenders – rather than their
  victims – into specific areas when they are released from prison are to be
  introduced by the government in England and Wales. At the moment, exclusion
  zones are often used to keep an offender away from their victim’s home but
  many campaigners for women’s safety have long called for this to be flipped.
  They argue a system of offender restriction zones will give victims more
  freedom because they can travel widely in the confidence they will not bump
  into their perpetrator. Technology, such as electronic tags, would be used to
  make sure offenders stayed in the allocated zone and if they strayed they
  risked being returned to prison. Under the plans, probation officers will
  conduct a risk assessment and work closely with victims on the creation of
  restriction zones, making sure they prevent contact while giving survivors the
  maximum freedom to rebuild their lives. The plans, announced on Friday by the
  Ministry of Justice, were welcomed by campaigners including the Joanna Simpson
  Foundation, which supports children affected by domestic abuse and homicide.
  In a statement the foundation co-founders, Diana Parkes and Hetti
  Barkworth-Nanton, said: “For far too long, victims have had to reshape their
  lives to avoid their offenders. “Exclusion zones have made victims feel
  trapped as though they are the ones serving a sentence, with the victim
  carrying the weight of someone else’s crime. “This is the much-needed change
  that has long been called for and is a powerful step forward. By placing
  restrictions on offenders instead, this will now give survivors the freedom
  they deserve to live, move and heal without fear. “It will also be more
  cost-effective for those monitoring the perpetrators as they will be locked in
  specific areas rather than having to monitor the exclusion zones where the
  victims live.” The plans are designed to restrict the movements of the most
  serious sexual and violent offenders. Rhianon Bragg, who was stalked and held
  hostage at gunpoint by her ex-partner Gareth Wyn Jones in north Wales,
  welcomed the government’s announcement. A wide exclusion zone was placed
  around her home when Jones was released but Bragg said she felt trapped in
  this area, and when she travelled out of it she felt at risk. Emma King, whose
  sister Julie Butcher was killed in Wiltshire in 2005, said: “This is a vital
  and significant step forward in shifting the burden of control away from
  victims and placing it where it belongs – on offenders. “For the first time,
  the justice system is taking a decisive stand: instead of victims being forced
  to uproot their lives to stay safe, the most serious sexual and violent
  offenders will now face strict boundaries that limit their freedom.” Alex
  Davies-Jones, the minister for victims and tackling violence against women and
  girls, said: “We’re putting victims first. This move will strengthen
  safeguards for victims.” Bringing in restriction zones will require primary
  legislation, which the government will introduce in parliament when time
  allows. The Ministry of Justice said wider changes throughout the probation
  system would also result in tens of thousands more offenders being tagged and
  at least 1,300 new trainee probation officers brought in next year to increase
  capacity. Further planned changes include: Increased tagging for domestic
  perpetrators. Requiring judges to flag domestic abuse at sentencing so
  prisons, probation and police can better identify and manage abusers.
  Expanding specialist domestic abuse courts. Bolstering transparency for
  victims at sentencing – including the provision of free copies of judges’
  sentencing remarks for victims of rape and other sexual offences.
