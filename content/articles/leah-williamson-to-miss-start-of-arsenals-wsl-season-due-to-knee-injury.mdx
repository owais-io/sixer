  Arsenal have been dealt a blow before the start of the new Women’s Super
  League season with Leah Williamson ruled out for several weeks after a
  procedure on a knee injury sustained in last month’s Euro 2025 final. The
  28-year-old reported back to Arsenal with swelling on her right knee having
  led her country to a second successive European Championship triumph in
  Switzerland. After the swelling had come down, tests revealed surgery was
  required to clear out the joint. Williamson was seen on crutches at Arsenal’s
  London Colney training ground. The club had feared the defender could be out
  for months – thankfully for them that has not proved to be the case.
  Williamson ruptured an anterior cruciate ligament in the same knee in April
  2023, leading to her miss the last World Cup in Australia and New Zealand and
  being out of action for nine months, though the two injuries are not directly
  linked. Arsenal open their WSL season against London City Lionesses at the
  Emirates Stadium on 6 September. They will going into that fixture on the back
  of a busy summer, securing Chloe Kelly on a permanent deal following her
  successful loan spell from Manchester City last season, adding goalkeeper
  Anneke Borbe from Wolfsburg and signing Liverpool duo Taylor Hinds, a former
  academy player, and forward Olivia Smith. Smith joined the club for a
  world-record fee in July, becoming the first £1m-player in women’s football
  and she praised the confidence placed in her potential. “It’s such a hefty
  price tag for such a young player,” said Smith. “I think they see the
  potential that I have. They see my mindset. I’m hungry, I’m driven, I want to
  learn, I want to grow, and I want to win things, ultimately. I think that was
  a big piece. The money? it’s not really a big deal for me. “At the end of the
  day, the price tag’s a price tag, it’s not really something I’m focused on,
  I’m just focused on being on the pitch and learning from a great set of
  players. It’s also great to see the development of women’s football and that
  price going up.” Smith was “on the edge of my seat” watching Arsenal’s
  Champions League win in May. “It was quite stressful for me, and I wasn’t even
  on the pitch,” she said. “It was an amazing performance by the girls, and
  watching it on a screen you could just see the motivation, the drive and the
  hunger and I knew that was something that I wanted to be a part of. That was
  also a massive driving factor in me joining, just looking at their mentality
  and what they’ve achieved in the Champions League.” Hinds, like Kelly,
  developed in Arsenal’s academy before leaving for her next opportunity. She
  watched the Champions League final with her boyfriend while on holiday in
  Barcelona. “I’ve always had a soft spot for Arsenal from growing up here. So,
  I was wanting the girls to do well and they did, they proved everyone wrong,”
  said the 26-year-old “I’ve enjoyed the journey that I’ve been on and I’m proud
  of it,” added Hinds as she reflected on her return to Arsenal. “When I first
  started having conversations and realised I could be back where it all started
  it was an unbelievable feeling for me and I’m so proud to be here. The hard
  work doesn’t stop, it continues, and to be in this team with an amazing group
  of girls and players and staff, I’m pleased for the season to get started.”
  Kelly added: “It’s always nice to come back to the club that you grew up
  playing in the academy of. Your journey goes different ways and then you come
  back home and it’s nice to be back here at this club. It feels like not much
  has changed but so much has changed”. On staying motivated after becoming a
  European champion for club and country, the 27-year-old said: “You just want
  to go again straight away. We’ve got competitions to win this season that
  we’re so hungry for, but I think once you taste success, you just want more of
  it and we’ll continue to do that.”
