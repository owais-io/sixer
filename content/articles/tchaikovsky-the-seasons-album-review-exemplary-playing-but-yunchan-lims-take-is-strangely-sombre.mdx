  Yunchan Lim’s first two discs for Decca – Chopin: Études Op 10 and Op 25, and
  Rachmaninov: Piano Concerto No 3 – were understandably chosen to showcase the
  technical brilliance and musical intelligence that had made the Korean pianist
  such an exceptional winner of the 2022 Van Cliburn competition in Fort Worth,
  Texas. But now, it seems, Lim feels it is time to reveal a more expressive,
  intimate side to his playing, and indeed it’s hard to imagine anything more
  different from the Chopin and Rachmaninov than Tchaikovsky’s suite The
  Seasons. Begun immediately after the premiere of Tchaikovsky’s first piano
  concerto and composed in parallel with his ballet Swan Lake, the series of 12
  miniatures that make up The Seasons were commissioned by a magazine, and
  published monthly through 1876. They were intended to be played by amateurs,
  and the technical demands most of them make are modest. But their charm and
  lyric beauty have made them a popular part of many concert pianists’
  repertory, whether as encore pieces or played as a selection in a recital.
  Each piece in the set has a descriptive title, appropriate to the time of year
  it illustrates: January is “By the Fireside”, March “Song of the Lark”, May
  “White Nights”, and so on. But in his sleeve notes, Lim offers his own
  provocative interpretation of the cycle. “Tchaikovsky’s The Seasons,” he
  claims, “depicts the final year in a person’s life.” What justification he
  might have for this assertion, apart from the composer’s generally jaundiced
  view of life, isn’t clear, and loading these often innocent miniatures with
  such a subtext seems wilfully obtuse. But perhaps Lim’s gloomy view of the
  work explains why his tempi for some of the pieces seem on the slow side,
  never quite to the point of sounding laboured, but certainly slow enough to
  give the music more gravitas than usual. Everything else about Lim’s playing
  is, as you would expect, exemplary, but several other pianists, most recently
  another major prize winner, Bruce Liu, present them in a less knowing, more
  guileless way. Stream it on Apple music (above) or on Spotify
