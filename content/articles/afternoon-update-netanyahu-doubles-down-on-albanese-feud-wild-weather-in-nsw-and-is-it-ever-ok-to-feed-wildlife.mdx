  Good afternoon. Benjamin Netanyahu has ignored pleas from Australian Jewish
  groups to calm his feud with Anthony Albanese, further criticising the prime
  minister and escalating an ugly spat between the two leaders. In a new
  interview with Sky News, the Israeli prime minister, who is wanted by the
  international criminal court over allegations of war crimes in Gaza, again
  labelled Albanese “weak” over the government’s recognition of a Palestinian
  state. “I’m sure he has a reputable record as a public servant, but I think
  his record is forever tarnished by the weakness that he showed in the face of
  these Hamas terrorist monsters,” Netanyahu said in a clip broadcast by Sky
  News. Australia’s peak Jewish group, the Executive Council of Australian
  Jewry, on Wednesday labelled Netanyahu’s attack on Albanese as “inflammatory
  and provocative”, and a “clumsy intervention” which had affected Australia’s
  Jewish community. Meanwhile, world leaders have condemned Israel’s
  announcement it was calling up an extra 60,000 reservists ahead of an
  offensive to conquer Gaza City, one of the last places of refuge in northern
  Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are sheltering. Top news
