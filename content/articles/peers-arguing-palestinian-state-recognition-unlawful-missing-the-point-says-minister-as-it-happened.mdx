  The UK’s plan to recognise a Palestinian state is compliant with international
  law, a minister has said, after a group of peers raised concerns that it did
  not meet the legal bar. As Haroon Siddique writes in an explainer, there are
  plenty of lawyers who agree with the government, not the peers who wrote the
  letter. Haroon says: Philippe Sands KC, a professor of law at University
  College London, pointed out that in its advisory opinion last year the UN’s
  top court, the international court of justice (ICJ), recognised “the right of
  the Palestinian people to self-determination, including its right to an
  independent and sovereign state”. Sands said: “I have no doubt whatsoever that
  if it were asked, the ICJ would reject the argument that it is somehow
  unlawful to recognise the existence of Palestinian statehood. Palestine meets
  all the legal criteria of statehood; all that remains is a political
  consideration, namely whether to recognise or not that those criteria are met.
  The court’s language makes clear that that right exists now, and it exists
  because all the criteria for statehood are met.” Jonathan Reynolds, the
  business secretary, defended the fact that the government’s plan for
  recognising Palestinian statehood does not involve firm “conditions” being
  placed on Hamas, saying the government could not make the decision conditional
  on what Hamas does because it does not negotiate with terrorist organistions.
  (See 2.34pm.) The Treasury should consider a wealth tax to close the growing
  gap in the public finances, according to a Labour former shadow chancellor.
  Nine out of 10 nurses have rejected their 3.6% pay award for this year and
  warned that they could strike later this year unless their salaries are
  improved. For a full list of all the stories covered on the blog today, do
  scroll through the list of key event headlines near the top of the blog.
  Mary-Ann Stephenson, who has been head of the Women’s Budget Group, a feminist
  economic thinktank, has been confirmed as the new chair of the Equality and
  Human Rights Commission, the government has announced. She will take up her
  post on 1 December. Her appointment was opposed by some transgender groups
  because in the past she has defended women who have been vilified for their
  gender critical views. A Reform UK government would have to pour some “nasty
  medicine” down the throat of the nation, according to the head of a thinktank
  advising the party. James Orr, who chairs the advisory board for the Centre
  for a Better Britain (CBB) thinktank, made the comment in an interview with
  the BBC. The CBB has close links to Reform, and operates from the same
  building. Orr told the BBC: You’ve got a massive majority [of voters] in
  favour of cutting taxes, a massive majority in favour of increased public
  spending, and Reform has not got a magic wand. But, if Nigel Farage were to
  take power after the next election, one advantage he would have would be not
  having to deal with a lot of MPs who had been in parliament before, Orr said.
  One of the advantages of having a completely fresh, new parliamentary party is
  that the leadership will have a great deal more power than Keir Starmer has,
  even with a majority of 160, and that Kemi Badenoch has over a party of 123.
  There will be a honeymoon period, I think, of a year, or two years. Those
  first hundred days are going to be absolutely vital to force the nasty cough
  medicine down the country’s throat. The number of migrants arriving in the UK
  after crossing the English Channel has topped 25,000 in record time, PA Media
  reports. PA says: Hundreds of foreign nationals have made the journey in
  recent days, as ministers continue to grapple with the challenge of cracking
  down on people-smuggling gangs. Some 898 migrants crossed the Channel in 13
  boats on Wednesday, bringing the total in 2025 so far to 25,436, Home Office
  figures show. This is up 51% on this point last year (16,842) and 73% higher
  than at this stage in 2023 (14,732), according to PA news agency analysis. It
  is the earliest point in a calendar year at which the 25,000 mark has been
  passed since data on Channel crossings was first reported in 2018. When the
  government announced its Palestinian statehood recognition policy on Tuesday,
  it included requirements for both Israel and Hamas. But the requirements for
  Israel were described as “conditions”, and Keir Starmer said, unless they were
  met, the UK would go ahead with recognition. The demands addressed to Hamas
  were not described as conditions, and Starmer was not explicit about what
  would happen if they were not met. In his interview on the World at One,
  Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, defended not imposing “conditions”
  on Hamas, saying the government could not negotiate with a terrorist
  organistion. He said: The reason [it has been] presented in that way is
  because Hamas are a terrorist organisation, and we don’t put conditions on
  them because we don’t negotiate with terrorists. We’ve been absolutely clear,
  it’s our long-standing position, that the hostages have to be released. It’s
  also our long-standing position that Hamas can play no role in the future
  governance of Gaza or any Palestinian state. So those are absolute conditions,
  but we will never be willing to negotiate with Hamas because they are a
  terrorist organisation. Despite being asked, Reynolds avoided saying if the
  government would be willing to recognise a Palestinian state if Hamas was
  still holding hostages in Gaza in September. In an interview with Radio 4’s
  the World at One, Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, claimed that
  peers who argue that Palestinian state recognition would be unlawful are
  “missing the point”. After being invited to listen to a clip of Lady Deech
  explaining the peers’ objections to the plan (see 12.59pm), and asked to
  respond, Reynolds replied: I think, to be honest, with respect to those
  colleagues, that is missing the point somewhat. What we want to see is not
  just a ceasefire to the conflict in Gaza, but a genuine peace process, a
  long-term settlement, and that requires a two state solution. And we’re trying
  to use recognition of a Palestinian state … in a way which genuinely moves
  forward this peace process, deals with short-term issues like getting
  sufficient aid into Gaza, which is a huge deal, but also sets in place a
  serious long-term peace process. And that is the objective. I would ask
  colleagues to appreciate that and look at the levers the UK has to help
  deliver something which millions of people around the world are desperate to
  see. Other countries are following Starmer in saying this week that they are
  bringing forward plans to recognise the state of Palestine. The announcements
  are being made off the back of a UN conference intended to revive support for
  the two-state solution. After Starmer announced his move on Tuesday evening,
  Mark Carney, the Canadian PM, announced that his country intends to formally
  recognise Palestine during the UN general assembly in September. This is
  conditional on the Palestinian Authority, the body that governs the occupied
  West Bank, holding an election in 2026 in which Palestinian militant group
  Hamas does not play a role, and agreeing to other democratic reforms. And
  today the Portuguese government has said it is considering recognising
  Palestine in September. The AFP news agency says: The Portuguese government
  will consult the president and parliament on the question of recognising the
  state of Palestine at the UN in September, Prime Minister Luis Montenegro’s
  office said Thursday. Portugal “is considering recognition of the Palestinian
  state, as part of a procedure that could be concluded during the high-level
  week of the 80th United Nations general assembly, to be held in New York in
  September”, the statement said. And today Germany’s foreign minister, Johann
  Wadephul, said: A negotiated two-state solution remains the only path that can
  offer people on both sides a life in peace, security, and dignity. For
  Germany, the recognition of a Palestinian state comes more at the end of that
  process. But such a process must begin now. Keir Starmer has ducked a question
  about claims that recognising the state of Palestine would be contrary to
  international law. While a government minister rejected this claim in an
  interview this morning (see 8.50am), Starmer just gave a generalised answer
  when asked about the issue in an interview with ITV West Country. Asked how he
  would respond to the backlash against his recognition plan, including from
  senior lawyers saying it would be illegal, Starmer instead focused on giving a
  response to Emily Damari, the British-Israeli woman held hostage by Hamas, who
  yesterday accused him of “moral failure”, saying he was rewarding terrorism.
  Starmer said: I particularly listen to the hostages. Emily Damari, who I have
  spoken to, I’ve met her mother a number of times, and they’ve been through the
  most awful, awful experience for Emily and for her mother. And that’s why I’ve
  been absolutely clear and steadfast that we must have the remaining hostages
  released. That’s been our position throughout, and I absolutely understand the
  unimaginable horror that Emily went through. Alongside that we do need to do
  everything we can to alleviate the humanitarian catastrophy in Gaza, where we
  are seeing the children and babies starving for want of aid which could be
  delivered. And that is why I’ve said unless things materially change on the
  ground, we’ll have to assess this in September, we will recognize Palestine
  before the United Nations general assembly in September. One of the peers who
  has signed the letter to Lord Hermer, the attorney general, arguing that
  recognising a Palestinian state would not be compatible with international
  law, is Lady Deech, an academic lawyer and former head of an Oxford college
  who now chairs the House of Lords Appointments Commission. In an interview
  with Sky News, she said Palestinian state recognition “definitely would break
  the law”. She explained: The Montevideo Convention has never been challenged.
  It was based on the existing international law, and it now counts as customary
  law. And this country is definitely bound by it, as the prime minister must
  know. Asked why the government was ignoring this issue, she said: “I think
  they must have overlooked it.” Deech said that her main objection to
  recognition was legal. But she also flagged up other objections. She said that
  more than 100 countries had already recognised Palestine, “and it’s made no
  difference on the ground”. She also said that the Palestinians had been
  offered a state and rejected it “at least four times in the last few decades …
  going back to 1938, right through to as recently as 2008”. To coincide with
  the release of today’s figures about violence in jails (see 10.36am), the
  Ministry of Justice has announced that it is using AI to address this problem.
  In a news release it says: AI will be used across prisons, probation and
  courts to better track offenders and assess the risk they pose with tools that
  can predict violence behind bars, uncover secret messages sent by prisoners
  and connect offender records across different systems. The AI violence
  predictor analyses different factors such as a prisoner’s age and previous
  involvement in violent incidents while in custody. This will help prison
  officers assess threat levels on wings and intervene or move prisoners before
  violence escalates. Another AI tool will be able to digitally scan the
  contents of mobile phones seized from prisoners to rapidly flag messages that
  could provide intelligence on potential crimes being committed behind bars,
  such as secret code words. Nine out of 10 nurses have rejected their 3.6% pay
  award for this year and warned that they could strike later this year unless
  their salaries are improved, Denis Campbell reports. The Ministry of Justice
  has also published performance figures for prisons in England and Wales for
  2024/25. They show that around half of them are rated as having performance
  either concern or serious concern. The figures show 22 prisons (18.5%) rated
  as of serious concern – the worst rating. This is the highest figure for
  almost a decade. There are also 37 prisons whose performance is of concern.
  That means 59 prisons (49.6%) were in the bottom two categories in 2024/25, up
  from 42% in the previous year. The MoJ says the increase reflects the fact
  prisons faced “significant capacity pressures” over the past year. Nigel
  Farage, the Reform UK leader, has called for a “tech answer” to protecting
  children online – while admitting that he does not know what it is. On Monday
  he said his party would repeal the Online Safety Act, arguing that rather than
  protecting children, as the government claims, it will expose them to more
  danger online because they will use VPNs to get round age verification checks.
  In a phone-in on LBC this morning, Farage was confronted by George Nicolaou,
  who said the law was a “matter of life and death” for famillies. Nicolaou’s
  teenage son died after being plagued with “horrific” messages online. Farage
  replied: If age verification of itself was able to prevent incidents and
  tragedies like this, I would, George, 100% support it. But the problem is it
  doesn’t, because of the VPN route.” VPNs, or virtual private networks, can
  enable internet users to circumvent the new rules, by masking a user’s digital
  identity. Farage went on: There has to be a tech answer around this. I don’t
  know what it is, certainly the government doesn’t know what it is, but there
  has to be a tech answer of some kind, and we need to try and find it. We’re
  talking about, how do we protect young people? How do we stop them accessing
  dangerous, violent content, or worse? Earlier I said that there were two main
  objections to Keir Starmer’s Palestinian state recognition plan
  (ineffectiveness, and rewarding terror), with a third added today (potential
  unlawfulness). See 8.50am. I should have made it clear that those are the
  objections from the anti-recognition side. As we reported on Tuesday, there
  are also strong objections from pro-Palestine campaigners who want Starmer to
  be far more committed to recognition, and who do not believe it should be
  conditional on what Israel does. The Palestine Solidarity Campaign is in this
  camp. Here is an extract from their statement on Starmer’s decision. Keir
  Starmer, who refuses even to recognise that Israel is violating international
  law in Gaza, is offering to recognise a Palestinian state if, and only if,
  Israel’s starvation and atrocities are still ongoing in two months’ time. If
  not, what is now being presented as a step towards recognising the Palestinian
  people’s right to self-determination will be rescinded. His grotesque message
  to Palestinians is that state recognition may come, but only if and when many,
  many more of you are dead. Despite Starmer’s attempt to represent his
  statements on Tuesday as a turning point, it is abundantly clear to all that
  it is simply more of the same, but with the possibility of conditional
  Palestinian statehood in September added to the package of collusion and
  complicity with genocide. The PSC statement sets out its full campaign
  objectives, including a comprehensive arms embargo and sanctions on the entire
  Israeli government. Prisons in England and Wales have become more violent over
  the past year, figures published by the Ministry of Justice show. The safety
  in custody statistics show: Assaults in jail were up 9% in the 12 months
  ending March 2025, reaching 356 assaults per 1,000 prisoners (30,846
  assaults). But in the most recent quarter, the rate of assaults was unchanged.
  Assaults on staff in jail were up 7% in the 12 months ending March 2025,
  reaching 122 assaults per 1,000 prisoners (10,568 assaults on staff). But in
  the most recent quarter, they were down 2.5%. The rate of serious assaults in
  jails was up 6% in the 12 months ending March 2025, reaching 39 serious
  assaults per 1,000 prisoners (3,402 incidents). These figures include serious
  prisoner-on-prisoner assaults (up 8%) and serious assaults on staff (down 2%).
  There were seven homicides in jails in the 12 months ending June 2025, up from
  none in the previous 12 months. Heidi Alexander, the transport secretary, will
  meet the boss of the UK’s airspace controller today to discuss the 20-minute
  failure of computer systems that led to widespread disruption yesterday,
  Jasper Jolly reports. He has more on his business live blog. Michael Ellis,
  the former Tory attorney general, has claimed that a decision to recognise the
  state of Palestine could be challenged in the courts under the judicial review
  process. Ellis is reportedly one of the lawyers who have signed the letter to
  Lord Hermer, the attorney general, saying recognising Palestinian statehood
  would be contrary to international law (see 8.50am) and he told Times Radio
  that it was “hypocritical” of Keir Starmer to international law considerations
  on this matter, while stressing the importance of upholding international law
  in other situations. Ellis said: Keir Starmer, as prime minister, has
  repeatedly said that he would adhere to international law. And he’s gone
  further than that. He’s taken, you might think, a high moral tone … He’s said
  that international law goes absolutely to the heart of his foreign policy. He
  even went so far as to say – and I think it was pretty rash for him to do so –
  but he said some time ago that a selective pick and mix approach to
  international law will lead to its disintegration. He said that the criteria
  set out in international law should not be manipulated for reasons of
  political expedience. So those are things that he said … It’s not fine to be
  hypocritical about that and to say we’re going to follow international law …
  when it suits him. Ellis said that, when Starmer decided to cede sovereignty
  of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, he argued that this was necessary because
  the UK had to comply with international law – even though the relevant
  international court ruling was only advisory. But recognising a Palestinian
  state would be contrary to international law, he claimed. He added: If they’re
  not careful, we could even be talking about judicial review territory here.
  Although Gareth Thomes, the business minister speaking for the government on
  the morning interview round, said the government did regard recognising a
  Palestinian state as lawful (see 8.50am), he also argued that ultimately this
  was a political judgment. He told Times Radio: In the end, recognition of
  another state is a political judgment and over 140 countries have already
  recognised Palestine, and we’re determined to do so in September if Israel
  does not end the violence in Gaza, agree to a ceasefire and agree to a lasting
  route towards a two-state solution, and to no annexation in the West Bank. In
  its report, the Times has published quotes from the letter sent by 40 peers to
  Lord Hermer, the attorney general, arguing that recognising the state of
  Palestine would be contrary to international law. The peers tell Hermer: We
  call on you to advise him [Starmer] that this would be contrary to
  international law. You are on record as saying that a commitment to
  international law goes absolutely to the heart of this government and its
  approach to foreign policy. You have said that a selective ‘pick and mix’
  approach to international law will lead to its disintegration, and that the
  criteria set out in international law should not be manipulated for reasons of
  political expedience. Accordingly, we expect you to demonstrate this
  commitment by explaining to the public and to the government that recognition
  of Palestine would be contrary to the principles governing recognition of
  states in international law. We look forward to your response. Good morning.
  Keir Starmer has been widely criticised for his announcement on Tuesday that
  the UK will recognise a Palestinian state unless Israel agrees a ceasefire in
  Gaza and commits to the two-state solution (which Benjamin Netanyahu’s
  government does not support). There have been two main objections. The Tories,
  and others, are mostly dismissing this as pointless, a gesture that will
  appease Labour MPs without having any practical, positive impact for
  Palestinians. The other line of attack argues that the move will have an
  impact, because it will reward Hamas for their attack on Israel, and
  incentivise them not to make peace or release the remaining hostages. This is
  what the Israeli government is saying, but the person who has made this
  argument most forcefully is Emily Damari, a British-Israeli woman held hostage
  by Hamas for more than a year. Her words have provided the Daily Mail with its
  splash. Today the decision is under fire on a third front. According to a
  story by Matt Dathan, Ali Mitib and Geraldine Scott on the Times front page,
  the move may unlawful. They say 40 members of the House of Lords have put this
  point to Lord Hermer, the attorney general, in a letter. They report: Some of
  Britain’s most prominent lawyers have warned Sir Keir Starmer that his
  government’s pledge to recognise a Palestinian state risks breaking
  international law. Their intervention, signed by 40 members of the House of
  Lords, said a Palestinian state would not meet the criteria for recognition as
  set out under the Montevideo Convention, a treaty signed in 1933 … The
  signatories point out that Starmer’s pledge risked undermining the
  government’s commitment that international law goes “absolutely to the heart”
  of its foreign policy. Under the Montevideo Convention, to qualify for
  statehood under international law, a state must have a permanent population, a
  defined territory, a government and the capacity to enter into relations with
  other states. The peers say that arguably Palestine does not meet any of these
  four conditions. According to the Times, the signatories include seven KCs,
  including Lord Pannick, Lord Collins of Mapesbury, a former supreme court
  judge, former Tory ministers including Eric Pickles and Andrew Lansley, and
  Arlene Foster, the former DUP leader. Keir Starmer is speaking the media later
  today, but Gareth Thomas, the business minister, has been doing the interview
  round this morning and he told Times Radio that the government thinks
  recognising a Palestinian state would be compliant with international law. He
  explained: We haven’t signed up to the Montevideo Convention, but is there a
  clear population in Palestine? Yes, there is in Gaza and the West Bank. We
  have made clear that we think you would recognise the state of Palestine, and
  that state of Palestine would be based on the 1967 borders. Of course, there
  would have to be land swaps and there would be a shared capital of Jerusalem.
  They are well-regarded international views. As I say, 140 other countries have
  already recognised the state of Palestine. The prime minister was in talks
  this week with a series of countries, including Canada, and Canada have
  overnight, as you will have seen, taken the decision to recognise Palestine in
  September. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: The Ministry of Justice
  publishes figures covering prison numbers, and assaults, deaths and self-harm
  in jails. 11am: Mourners attend the funeral of Norman Tebbit at St Edmundsbury
  Cathedral in Bury St Edmunds. Morning: Keir Starmer and Jonathan Reynolds, the
  business secretary, are on a visit in the south-west of England to promote
  plans to penalise firms that pay their suppliers late. They are due to give
  media interviews. Also, at some point today, Heathrow Airport will submit its
  third runway plans to the government. If you want to contact me, please post a
  message below the line when comments are open (normally between 10am and 3pm
  at the moment), or message me on social media. I can’t read all the messages
  BTL, but if you put “Andrew” in a message aimed at me, I am more likely to see
  it because I search for posts containing that word. If you want to flag
  something up urgently, it is best to use social media. You can reach me on
  Bluesky at @andrewsparrowgdn.bsky.social. The Guardian has given up posting
  from its official accounts on X, but individual Guardian journalists are

  I will see it and respond if necessary. I find it very helpful when readers
  point out mistakes, even minor typos. No error is too small to correct. And I
  find your questions very interesting too. I can’t promise to reply to them
  all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either BTL or sometimes in

Portugal “is considering recognition of the Palestinian state, as part of a procedure that could be concluded during the high-level week of the 80th United Nations general assembly, to be held in New York in September”, the statement said. And today Germany’s foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, said: A negotiated two-state solution remains the only path that can offer people on both sides a life in peace, security, and dignity. For Germany, the recognition of a Palestinian state comes more at the end of that process. But such a process must begin now. Keir Starmer has ducked a question about claims that recognising the state of Palestine would be contrary to international law. While a government minister rejected this claim in an interview this morning (see 8.50am), Starmer just gave a generalised answer when asked about the issue in an interview with ITV West Country. Asked how he would respond to the backlash against his recognition plan, including from senior lawyers saying it would be illegal, Starmer instead focused on giving a response to Emily Damari, the British-Israeli woman held hostage by Hamas, who yesterday accused him of “moral failure”, saying he was rewarding terrorism. Starmer said: I particularly listen to the hostages. Emily Damari, who I have spoken to, I’ve met her mother a number of times, and they’ve been through the most awful, awful experience for Emily and for her mother. And that’s why I’ve been absolutely clear and steadfast that we must have the remaining hostages released. That’s been our position throughout, and I absolutely understand the unimaginable horror that Emily went through. Alongside that we do need to do everything we can to alleviate the humanitarian catastrophy in Gaza, where we are seeing the children and babies starving for want of aid which could be delivered. And that is why I’ve said unless things materially change on the ground, we’ll have to assess this in September, we will recognize Palestine before the United Nations general assembly in September. One of the peers who has signed the letter to Lord Hermer, the attorney general, arguing that recognising a Palestinian state would not be compatible with international law, is Lady Deech, an academic lawyer and former head of an Oxford college who now chairs the House of Lords Appointments Commission. In an interview with Sky News, she said Palestinian state recognition “definitely would break the law”. She explained: The Montevideo Convention has never been challenged. It was based on the existing international law, and it now counts as customary law. And this country is definitely bound by it, as the prime minister must know. Asked why the government was ignoring this issue, she said: “I think they must have overlooked it.” Deech said that her main objection to recognition was legal. But she also flagged up other objections. She said that more than 100 countries had already recognised Palestine, “and it’s made no difference on the ground”. She also said that the Palestinians had been offered a state and rejected it “at least four times in the last few decades … going back to 1938, right through to as recently as 2008”. To coincide with the release of today’s figures about violence in jails (see 10.36am), the Ministry of Justice has announced that it is using AI to address this problem. In a news release it says: AI will be used across prisons, probation and courts to better track offenders and assess the risk they pose with tools that can predict violence behind bars, uncover secret messages sent by prisoners and connect offender records across different systems. The AI violence predictor analyses different factors such as a prisoner’s age and previous involvement in violent incidents while in custody. This will help prison officers assess threat levels on wings and intervene or move prisoners before violence escalates. Another AI tool will be able to digitally scan the contents of mobile phones seized from prisoners to rapidly flag messages that could provide intelligence on potential crimes being committed behind bars, such as secret code words. Nine out of 10 nurses have rejected their 3.6% pay award for this year and warned that they could strike later this year unless their salaries are improved, Denis Campbell reports. The Ministry of Justice has also published performance figures for prisons in England and Wales for 2024/25. They show that around half of them are rated as having performance either concern or serious concern. The figures show 22 prisons (18.5%) rated as of serious concern – the worst rating. This is the highest figure for almost a decade. There are also 37 prisons whose performance is of concern. That means 59 prisons (49.6%) were in the bottom two categories in 2024/25, up from 42% in the previous year. The MoJ says the increase reflects the fact prisons faced “significant capacity pressures” over the past year. Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, has called for a “tech answer” to protecting children online – while admitting that he does not know what it is. On Monday he said his party would repeal the Online Safety Act, arguing that rather than protecting children, as the government claims, it will expose them to more danger online because they will use VPNs to get round age verification checks. In a phone-in on LBC this morning, Farage was confronted by George Nicolaou, who said the law was a “matter of life and death” for famillies. Nicolaou’s teenage son died after being plagued with “horrific” messages online. Farage replied: If age verification of itself was able to prevent incidents and tragedies like this, I would, George, 100% support it. But the problem is it doesn’t, because of the VPN route.” VPNs, or virtual private networks, can enable internet users to circumvent the new rules, by masking a user’s digital identity. Farage went on: There has to be a tech answer around this. I don’t know what it is, certainly the government doesn’t know what it is, but there has to be a tech answer of some kind, and we need to try and find it. We’re talking about, how do we protect young people? How do we stop them accessing dangerous, violent content, or worse? Earlier I said that there were two main objections to Keir Starmer’s Palestinian state recognition plan (ineffectiveness, and rewarding terror), with a third added today (potential unlawfulness). See 8.50am. I should have made it clear that those are the objections from the anti-recognition side. As we reported on Tuesday, there are also strong objections from pro-Palestine campaigners who want Starmer to be far more committed to recognition, and who do not believe it should be conditional on what Israel does. The Palestine Solidarity Campaign is in this camp. Here is an extract from their statement on Starmer’s decision. Keir Starmer, who refuses even to recognise that Israel is violating international law in Gaza, is offering to recognise a Palestinian state if, and only if, Israel’s starvation and atrocities are still ongoing in two months’ time. If not, what is now being presented as a step towards recognising the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination will be rescinded. His grotesque message to Palestinians is that state recognition may come, but only if and when many, many more of you are dead. Despite Starmer’s attempt to represent his statements on Tuesday as a turning point, it is abundantly clear to all that it is simply more of the same, but with the possibility of conditional Palestinian statehood in September added to the package of collusion and complicity with genocide. The PSC statement sets out its full campaign objectives, including a comprehensive arms embargo and sanctions on the entire Israeli government. Prisons in England and Wales have become more violent over the past year, figures published by the Ministry of Justice show. The safety in custody statistics show: Assaults in jail were up 9% in the 12 months ending March 2025, reaching 356 assaults per 1,000 prisoners (30,846 assaults). But in the most recent quarter, the rate of assaults was unchanged. Assaults on staff in jail were up 7% in the 12 months ending March 2025, reaching 122 assaults per 1,000 prisoners (10,568 assaults on staff). But in the most recent quarter, they were down 2.5%. The rate of serious assaults in jails was up 6% in the 12 months ending March 2025, reaching 39 serious assaults per 1,000 prisoners (3,402 incidents). These figures include serious prisoner-on-prisoner assaults (up 8%) and serious assaults on staff (down 2%). There were seven homicides in jails in the 12 months ending June 2025, up from none in the previous 12 months. Heidi Alexander, the transport secretary, will meet the boss of the UK’s airspace controller today to discuss the 20-minute failure of computer systems that led to widespread disruption yesterday, Jasper Jolly reports. He has more on his business live blog. Michael Ellis, the former Tory attorney general, has claimed that a decision to recognise the state of Palestine could be challenged in the courts under the judicial review process. Ellis is reportedly one of the lawyers who have signed the letter to Lord Hermer, the attorney general, saying recognising Palestinian statehood would be contrary to international law (see 8.50am) and he told Times Radio that it was “hypocritical” of Keir Starmer to international law considerations on this matter, while stressing the importance of upholding international law in other situations. Ellis said: Keir Starmer, as prime minister, has repeatedly said that he would adhere to international law. And he’s gone further than that. He’s taken, you might think, a high moral tone … He’s said that international law goes absolutely to the heart of his foreign policy. He even went so far as to say – and I think it was pretty rash for him to do so – but he said some time ago that a selective pick and mix approach to international law will lead to its disintegration. He said that the criteria set out in international law should not be manipulated for reasons of political expedience. So those are things that he said … It’s not fine to be hypocritical about that and to say we’re going to follow international law … when it suits him. Ellis said that, when Starmer decided to cede sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, he argued that this was necessary because the UK had to comply with international law – even though the relevant international court ruling was only advisory. But recognising a Palestinian state would be contrary to international law, he claimed. He added: If they’re not careful, we could even be talking about judicial review territory here. Although Gareth Thomes, the business minister speaking for the government on the morning interview round, said the government did regard recognising a Palestinian state as lawful (see 8.50am), he also argued that ultimately this was a political judgment. He told Times Radio: In the end, recognition of another state is a political judgment and over 140 countries have already recognised Palestine, and we’re determined to do so in September if Israel does not end the violence in Gaza, agree to a ceasefire and agree to a lasting route towards a two-state solution, and to no annexation in the West Bank. In its report, the Times has published quotes from the letter sent by 40 peers to Lord Hermer, the attorney general, arguing that recognising the state of Palestine would be contrary to international law. The peers tell Hermer: We call on you to advise him [Starmer] that this would be contrary to international law. You are on record as saying that a commitment to international law goes absolutely to the heart of this government and its approach to foreign policy. You have said that a selective ‘pick and mix’ approach to international law will lead to its disintegration, and that the criteria set out in international law should not be manipulated for reasons of political expedience. Accordingly, we expect you to demonstrate this commitment by explaining to the public and to the government that recognition of Palestine would be contrary to the principles governing recognition of states in international law. We look forward to your response. Good morning. Keir Starmer has been widely criticised for his announcement on Tuesday that the UK will recognise a Palestinian state unless Israel agrees a ceasefire in Gaza and commits to the two-state solution (which Benjamin Netanyahu’s government does not support). There have been two main objections. The Tories, and others, are mostly dismissing this as pointless, a gesture that will appease Labour MPs without having any practical, positive impact for Palestinians. The other line of attack argues that the move will have an impact, because it will reward Hamas for their attack on Israel, and incentivise them not to make peace or release the remaining hostages. This is what the Israeli government is saying, but the person who has made this argument most forcefully is Emily Damari, a British-Israeli woman held hostage by Hamas for more than a year. Her words have provided the Daily Mail with its splash. Today the decision is under fire on a third front. According to a story by Matt Dathan, Ali Mitib and Geraldine Scott on the Times front page, the move may unlawful. They say 40 members of the House of Lords have put this point to Lord Hermer, the attorney general, in a letter. They report: Some of Britain’s most prominent lawyers have warned Sir Keir Starmer that his government’s pledge to recognise a Palestinian state risks breaking international law. Their intervention, signed by 40 members of the House of Lords, said a Palestinian state would not meet the criteria for recognition as set out under the Montevideo Convention, a treaty signed in 1933 … The signatories point out that Starmer’s pledge risked undermining the government’s commitment that international law goes “absolutely to the heart” of its foreign policy. Under the Montevideo Convention, to qualify for statehood under international law, a state must have a permanent population, a defined territory, a government and the capacity to enter into relations with other states. The peers say that arguably Palestine does not meet any of these four conditions. According to the Times, the signatories include seven KCs, including Lord Pannick, Lord Collins of Mapesbury, a former supreme court judge, former Tory ministers including Eric Pickles and Andrew Lansley, and Arlene Foster, the former DUP leader. Keir Starmer is speaking the media later today, but Gareth Thomas, the business minister, has been doing the interview round this morning and he told Times Radio that the government thinks recognising a Palestinian state would be compliant with international law. He explained: We haven’t signed up to the Montevideo Convention, but is there a clear population in Palestine? Yes, there is in Gaza and the West Bank. We have made clear that we think you would recognise the state of Palestine, and that state of Palestine would be based on the 1967 borders. Of course, there would have to be land swaps and there would be a shared capital of Jerusalem. They are well-regarded international views. As I say, 140 other countries have already recognised the state of Palestine. The prime minister was in talks this week with a series of countries, including Canada, and Canada have overnight, as you will have seen, taken the decision to recognise Palestine in September. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: The Ministry of Justice publishes figures covering prison numbers, and assaults, deaths and self-harm in jails. 11am: Mourners attend the funeral of Norman Tebbit at St Edmundsbury Cathedral in Bury St Edmunds. Morning: Keir Starmer and Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, are on a visit in the south-west of England to promote plans to penalise firms that pay their suppliers late. They are due to give media interviews. Also, at some point today, Heathrow Airport will submit its third runway plans to the government.
