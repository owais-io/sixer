  Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are being sued by a group of passengers
  who claim they paid extra money to sit in “window” seats which were not
  actually next to windows. Proposed class actions were filed against United in
  San Francisco federal court and against Delta in Brooklyn, New York, federal
  court, seeking millions of dollars in damages for more than 1 million
  passengers at each airline. The complaints say some Boeing 737, Boeing 757 and
  Airbus A321 planes contain seats that would normally be next to windows, but
  lack them because of the placement of air conditioning ducts, electrical
  conduits or other components. The lawsuit claims that Delta and United do not
  flag these seats as not being next to windows during the booking process,
  unlike rivals such as Alaska Airlines and American Airlines. Passengers who
  pay for the window seats can instead find themselves sitting next to a
  windowless wall, despite Delta and United allegedly charging tens or sometimes
  hundreds of dollars for the seats. “Had plaintiffs and the class members known
  that the seats they were purchasing [were] windowless, they would not have
  selected them – much less have paid extra,” the United complaint said. The
  Delta complaint contained similar language. Carter Greenbaum, an attorney
  whose law firm, Greenbaum Olbrantz LLP, filed the suits, told the New York
  Times: “We’re seeking to hold United and Delta accountable for charging
  customers premiums for products that they didn’t deliver, and misrepresenting
  the nature of the products that they did deliver.” Neither Delta nor United
  responded to requests for comment from Reuters. In an annual report this year,
  United described itself as “the largest airline measured by available seat
  miles in the world”. On Delta’s website, the airline says it “intends to
  ensure that your air travel experience will encompass, to the best of our
  abilities, the most comprehensive customer service possible”.
