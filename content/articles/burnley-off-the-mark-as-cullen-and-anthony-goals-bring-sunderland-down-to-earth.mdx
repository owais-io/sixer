  The last time Burnley were in the Premier League, they won twice at home on
  the way to a desperate relegation. Goals from Josh Cullen, newly installed as
  captain, and Jaidon Anthony mean they are already halfway to that tally, while
  Sunderland were given a harsh lesson in the reality of the top flight after
  their opening win against West Ham. Cullen’s predecessor, Josh Brownhill, was
  instrumental in bringing Burnley up and his replacement set the tone with a
  fine opener and an assist for the second. Turf Moor was clearly nervous from
  the off, with memories of earning 10 points here two seasons ago fresh in the
  mind. The victory was hard-earned through discipline, graft and one of the few
  moments of quality in the 90 minutes to offer hope that this time may be
  different for Burnley after becoming a yo-yo club. Scott Parker, the Burnley
  manager, said: “I’m absolutely buzzing, first and foremost, for the players
  and for the fans and everyone involved. We were brilliant. “The main thing for
  our first home game, we needed to make these fans believe. We need to make
  them feel or illustrate to our fans what we’re capable of this year. Our fans
  were superb. Our players gave them that belief. They’re going to be vitally
  important this year. “As a football club, I can’t do this on my own. These 20,
  30-odd players can’t do this on their own. It’s going to need the whole club
  to support, to get behind us, to buckle in at times for the bumpy road and the
  challenge we face.” Survival will be built on what happens in home games. On
  their way to promotion under Parker last season they did not lose , although
  nine draws indicate they did not always dominate. The defence had a summer
  shake-up and looked fragile in last week’s loss at Tottenham and they should
  have been behind within five minutes here. Granit Xhaka’s free-kick found Dan
  Ballard, who knocked the ball down to Eliezer Mayenda to shoot from close
  range, only for Martin Dubravka produce a fine save from a miscue. This would
  prove to be the only shot on target in a turgid first half. Burnley will need
  luck if they are to survive and they thought they had found some. A direct
  ball was won by Anthony and then Lyle Foster got the better of the substitute
  Jenson Seelt, before beating Robin Roefs. The goal music blared, Foster ran to
  the corner to celebrate and did not hear Michael Salisbury’s whistle, the
  referee having deemed the South African had fouled the defender. If the first
  half was devoid of quality, the tenor changed within two minutes of the
  second. Quilindschy Hartman, who goes by Q in these parts, collected a loose
  pass on the left and drilled it into Anthony, whose perfect flick found Cullen
  and the Burnley captain curled the ball into the bottom corner from 15 yards.
  The video assistant referee tried to ruin the fun with a strangely lengthy
  check for an offside that never was. Burnley were up and running. That
  alleviated the tension, with concerns of a doomed season from the off. There
  was, however, cause for worry soon after when the floodlights kept flashing
  and the game was stopped as it was causing a distraction on the pitch because
  it is not traditional to have a mid-match lights show. Burnley were always
  there to pressure opponents and put bodies on the line. Chasing lost causes
  and pressing those in black was a key trait to the end, aided by the
  experience of Kyle Walker and relentless energy provided by Hannibal Mejbri.
  The performance was summed up by Maxime Estève going down with cramp after
  making a critical interception. It meant Sunderland were not afforded a chance
  to equalise. “It’s not a surprise for me, it’s not a surprise for the players,
  for the club,” Régis Le Bris, the visiting manager, said of the Premier
  League’s quality. “I don’t know for the fans, I’m not sure, because they know
  how tough this league is. You enjoy when you win, but you won’t be too
  negative when you lose.” It was the foundations that were tested more than the
  electricity supply with two minutes remaining. With Sunderland chasing the
  match, there was space to be enjoyed for once and Cullen flashed a sublime
  pass through the defence for Anthony to latch on to, before rounding the
  goalkeeper and finishing. Sometimes it is better to be good than lucky.
