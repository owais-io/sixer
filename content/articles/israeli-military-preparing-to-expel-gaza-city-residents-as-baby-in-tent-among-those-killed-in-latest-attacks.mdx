  The Israeli military will begin preparing for the forcible displacement of
  Palestinians from Gaza City, it said on Saturday, as health officials said it
  had killed at least 40 people including a baby in a tent and people seeking
  aid in its latest attacks. The announcement came days after Israel said it
  intended to launch a new offensive to seize control of Gaza City, the
  enclave’s largest urban centre, in a plan that raised international alarm. The
  Israeli offensive has already displaced most of the population, killed tens of
  thousands of civilians and created a famine. Gaza residents would be provided
  with tents and other shelter equipment starting from Sunday ahead of
  relocating them from combat zones to the south of the enclave “to ensure their
  safety,” the Israeli military claimed on Saturday. It did not say when the
  mass displacement would begin. Israel has repeatedly bombed areas it had
  declared as safe zones. On Saturday a baby girl and her parents were killed
  when an Israeli airstrike hit a tent in al-Muwasi, previously designated a
  humanitarian zone by Israel, in southern Gaza, Nasser hospital officials and
  witnesses said. “Two and a half months, what has she done?” her neighbour
  Fathi Shubeir asked. “They are civilians in an area designated safe.” Israel’s
  military said it couldn’t comment on the strike without more details.
  Al-Muwasi is now one of the most heavily populated areas in Gaza after Israel
  pushed people into the desolate area. But prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu
  last week said Israel planned to widen its coming military offensive to
  include the area, along with Gaza City and “central camps” – an apparent
  reference to the built-up Nuseirat and Bureij refugee camps in central Gaza.
  According to the civil defence agency, at least 13 of the Palestinians killed
  on Saturday were shot by troops as they were waiting to collect food aid near
  distribution sites in the north and in the south. There were also another 11
  malnutrition-related deaths in Gaza over the past 24 hours, the health
  ministry said on Saturday, including at least one child. That brings
  malnutrition-related deaths due to the Israeli blockade on aid to 251. In
  recent days, Gaza City residents have reported more frequent air strikes
  targeting residential areas especially in the east and south and including the
  Zeitun neighbourhood. Hamas said on Saturday the military was targeting the
  area with warplanes, artillery and drones. Civil defence spokesman Mahmud
  Bassal said conditions in Zeitun were rapidly deteriorating with residents
  having little to no access to food and water amid heavy Israeli bombardment.
  He said that about 50,000 people were estimated to be in that area of Gaza
  City, “the majority of whom are without food or water” and lacking “the basic
  necessities of life”. Ghassan Kashko, 40, who is sheltering with his family at
  a school building in the neighbourhood, said: “We don’t know the taste of
  sleep.” He said air strikes and tank shelling were causing “explosions... that
  don’t stop”. Israel was carrying out ethnic cleansing in Zeitun, Bassal said.
  The Israeli military says it abides by international law though rights groups,
  including in Israel, say it is committing genocide. In its announcement on
  Saturday the military said shelter equipment would be transferred via the
  Kerem Shalom crossing in southern Gaza by the United Nations and other
  international relief organisations after being inspected by defence ministry
  personnel, the military said. Israeli inspections and bureaucracy have until
  now resulted in much aid being refused entry to the territory. A spokesperson
  for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
  expressed concern over Israel’s plans to relocate people to southern Gaza
  saying it would only increase suffering. But the UN body welcomed Israel’s
  recognition that shelter is a desperate need and that tents and other shelter
  equipment will be allowed again into Gaza. “The UN and its partners will seize
  the opportunity this opens,” the spokesperson said. The UN warned on Thursday
  that thousands of families already enduring appalling humanitarian conditions
  could be pushed over the edge if the Gaza City plan moves ahead. Palestinian
  and United Nations officials have said no place in the enclave is safe,
  including areas in southern Gaza where Israel has been ordering residents to
  move to. The military declined to comment when asked whether the shelter
  equipment was intended for Gaza City’s population, estimated at around one
  million people presently, and whether the site to which they will be relocated
  in southern Gaza would be the area of Rafah, which borders Egypt. Israel’s
  defence minister Israel Katz said on Saturday that the plans for the new
  offensive were still being formulated. The Palestinian militant faction
  Islamic Jihad, an ally of Hamas, said that the military’s announcement “as
  part of its brutal attack to occupy Gaza City, is a blatant and brazen mockery
  of international conventions.” Protests calling for a hostage release and an
  end to the war were expected throughout Israel on Sunday, with many
  businesses, municipalities and universities saying they will support employees
  striking for the day. The families of Israeli hostages held by Hamas called
  for the “nationwide day of stoppage” on Sunday to express growing frustration
  over the war. They fear the coming offensive will further endanger the 50
  hostages remaining in Gaza, just 20 of whom are thought to still be alive.
