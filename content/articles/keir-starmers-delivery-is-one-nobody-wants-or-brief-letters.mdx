  “Delivery, delivery, delivery” is the politics of online shopping (Keir
  Starmer may have just served up the worst political slogan of all time, 2
  September). You order something you desperately want, take a leap of faith in
  the courier, the tracking information is baffling, the wrong parcel is
  delivered, your parcel is thrown over the hedge a week later, it’s damaged and
  unrecognisable; you lack the will to re-order. Helen Datson (with apologies to
  our efficient local couriers) Spelsbury, Oxfordshire • Re Simon Hattenstone’s
  article on the “worst slogan”: what on earth happened to Change? David Morriss
  London • I agree with your letter writer that runner beans have certainly been
  tricky this year (27 August) but at least my five-year-old olive tree is
  covered in fruit. Ross Balzaretti Nottingham • After your correspondence on
  planting pages of publications with different vegetables (2 September),
  presumably the Lancet is best for pulses. Adrian Brodkin London • On matching
  newspapers to crops, dare I say the Sun is necessary for all of them? John
  Evans Chalford Hill, Gloucestershire • What infuriates me most about energy
  drinks (‘No place in children’s hands’: under-16s in England to be banned from
  buying energy drinks, 2 September) is that the beverages never seem to give
  those who drink them sufficient energy to take their empty cans to the bin.
  John Lovelock Bristol • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the
  Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it will be considered for
