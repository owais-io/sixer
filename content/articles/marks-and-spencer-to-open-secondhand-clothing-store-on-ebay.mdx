  Marks &amp; Spencer is opening a secondhand clothing store on eBay to find new
  homes for “old favourites” as the household name taps into booming demand for
  preloved clothing. The retailer has collected 36.5m secondhand clothes since
  it launched its “shwopping” clothing recycling scheme – now called Another
  Life – over a decade ago. Most of that clothing has been resold by charity
  partner Oxfam. As growth in donations has slowed, M&amp;S is trying something
  new and will reward customers for Oxfam donations containing at least one
  M&amp;S item with a £5 voucher when they spend £35 in its stores or online. To
  use the service customers must complete a short form on its website or scan a
  QR code in stores, then send their preloved items using a free local courier
  service to Reskinned, a repair and resale specialist. The best M&amp;S items
  that can be worn again will be professionally cleaned, repaired by Reskinned
  then listed on the M&amp;S eBay store. Items that cannot be resold will be
  responsibly repurposed or recycled. Oxfam will take a 15% share of M&amp;S’s
  profits from the eBay sales and the rest will be split between the retailer,
  eBay and Reskinned. The charity will also continue to sell donated clothes,
  including non-M&amp;S branded items that are not selected for the eBay store
  directly in its outlets. Katharine Beacham, the head of sustainability in
  fashion for M&amp;S, said it had led the way with “shwopping”, which had
  “shifted the way people looked at clothes”. “We wanted to revamp shwopping to
  continue to improve how customers look at clothing and how they can give
  clothes another life.” The partnership with eBay gave M&amp;S an opportunity
  to learn what customers were looking for from resale, she said. The company
  would consider how successful the eBay store was before potentially selling
  secondhand items via its own stores or website. The change in setup comes amid
  rapid growth in the sale of secondhand clothes online, with M&amp;S one of the
  most searched for brands on eBay. Depop, the London-based secondhand clothing
  marketplace, is on track for $1bn (£740m) of annual sales for the first time,
  its owner, Etsy, said recently, after a 35% surge in sales to $250m in the
  three months to 30 June. The company said growth was driven by a 54% jump in
  sales in the US as it signed up a record number of new shoppers. Its rival
  Vinted reported a 41% rise in sales to almost €813m (£704m) for 2024 with
  profits almost tripling to €95.4m after the company stepped out of the red for
  the first time in 2023. Major high street retailers from Primark to H&amp;M
  are making space for secondhand items either on the shopfloor or online. Many
  retailers, including Uniqlo, Zara and M&amp;S, have also begun offering repair
  services. M&amp;S has also tested offering shoppers the chance to send in
  unwearable clothes from any label in a prepaid postal donation bag left with a
  courier in partnership with Oxfam. Beacham said M&amp;S was considering how to
  expand that trial. Mary Creagh, the circular economy minister, said the
  government was focused on “ending our throwaway culture and ensuring that the
  700,000 odd tonnes of clothes we throw away each year are worn more”. “Only
  government and businesses working together can stop fashion costing the
  earth,” said Creagh who described the M&amp;S initiative as a “great way for
  consumers to be rewarded for providing a new home for old favourites”.
