  My mother, Ann Seth, who has died aged 90, worked for decades as an English
  and history teacher before she decided to develop her interest in art instead.
  In 1981 she enrolled for a second degree in visual studies at Oxford
  Polytechnic, where she became hooked on photography. She went on to exhibit a
  series of multimedia installations, using innovative methods such as infrared
  film and stereoscopy. On one occasion in the mid-1980s she took over the
  former St Paul’s church in Jericho, Oxford (now known as Freud’s cafe) filling
  it with triptychs, sculpture and abstract photography. Her artistic interests
  turned increasingly towards landscape photography. In the early 2000s she was
  commissioned by Oxfordshire county council to document the beautiful
  countryside across the south of the county. This was one of her favourite
  jobs, allowing her to spend time at White Horse Hill near Uffington, one of
  her most beloved places. Ann was born in York and grew up as bombs fell on the
  wartime city. Her father, Fred Delaney, an Irish immigrant who dreamed of
  becoming a professional footballer, was called up at the start of the second
  world war, and was among the thousands of servicemen listed missing in the
  sinking of the RMS Lancastria troopship in 1940. He never returned. Ann, an
  only child, was brought up by her mother, Edith (nee Glenn), who scraped a
  living doing clerical work around York. Home life was lonely, but Ann loved
  school and she especially loved books, devouring five each week from York’s
  library. Encouraged by her headteacher at the Bar Convent school, she applied
  to university, the first in her family to do so. In 1953 she arrived to study
  English literature at Sheffield, where she met Bhola Seth, a young Indian
  engineer studying for a PhD. They married in 1960, a time when mixed marriages
  were rare. After graduating, Ann and Seth (as he was always known) moved first
  to Tyneside, where Ann taught at Blyth grammar school, and then in 1962 they
  arrived in Oxfordshire, where they remained for the rest of their lives. Seth
  worked at the Esso Research Centre near Abingdon, while Ann taught history at
  a secondary school in Didcot. Her social life revolved around sport –
  badminton and tennis – and theatre, which remained one of Ann’s great loves.
  They also made frequent trips to the Lake District, where Ann slowly
  introduced Seth to the joys of fell-walking. The couple continued to visit the
  Lakes throughout their marriage, climbing 70 separate “Wainwrights” in Ann’s
  70th year. After Seth died in 2013, Ann spent more time in and around her home
  village of Letcombe Regis, where she became increasingly active in Green party
  politics. As her health began to fail, her village walks became shorter and
  she eventually settled for excursions around her back garden, walking
  determinedly up and down the lawn (“doing the rounds”), and sitting under the
  old apple tree. The dedication of her long-term carer, Lynette, enabled her to
  remain at home until the end of her life. She is survived by me.
