  ‘What choice have I got?’: Lana built a life in Australia after years on Nauru
  – but now faces returning to the Iran she fled to keep it

  Lana and Scott* met in torrential rain: she was waiting for a bus, he offered
  her a lift. “We just kicked it off,” Scott remembers of the chance meeting on
  Nauru in 2015. He was working on the island when Australia’s offshore
  detention centre was being built. Lana had fled family violence in Iran,
  risking her life to travel to Australia by boat from Indonesia in 2013. After
  her vessel was intercepted by Australian authorities, she was detained on
  Christmas Island then moved to an open detention centre on Nauru, where she
  stayed for almost four years. In 2017, married to Scott and four months
  pregnant, she was flown to Brisbane’s immigration detention centre for medical
  reasons, where she spent the remainder of her pregnancy. The pair have one
  child and live in Queensland. Her limited immigration status allows her to
  work intermittently. But with no possibility of acquiring permanent residency
  while in Australia, Lana is about to take what may seem an unthinkable step –
  returning to Iran to wait up to two years while an offshore application is
  processed. Having arrived in Australian waters after the July 2013 edict that
  dissolved all pathways to living permanently in Australia for people in
  offshore processing, Lana is one of about 930 refugees in Australia known as
  “transitory persons”. She was potentially eligible for resettlement in New
  Zealand under Australia’s bilateral agreement, but could not be certain that
  her family would be able to migrate with her had she been approved. Instead,
  she must renew her temporary visa to remain in Australia every four or six
  months, depending on what period the home affairs department designates. Sign
  up for a weekly email featuring our best reads ‘I want a freedom which I don’t
  have’ Bethany Rose, an immigration lawyer who is representing Lana, says the
  process is unstable and precarious by design. “You put in an application for a
  bridging E visa and, depending on department processing, you might not be
  granted a visa for a month, in which time you become unlawful. You can’t prove
  to Medicare or your workplace that you have work rights, so you lose your job,
  you lose your Medicare access, and this goes on and on for years,” she says.
  Lana – who could technically be sent back to Nauru at any time – says she has
  access to Medicare for seven months a year. Unable to secure a long-term job
  or study, she is desperate. In the past year, she has been admitted to
  hospital multiple times because of panic attacks. “It’s horrible. You’re in
  prison. You’re just working here and nothing else,” she says. “I can’t handle
  this life any more. I want a freedom which I don’t have. I have to always be
  scared of everything.” Despite the deep level of isolation wrought by her
  immigration status, Lana has made a life in Australia. She is accepted in her
  community and her child speaks only English. “These circumstances were never
  contemplated as the legal regime never intended for these people to ever enter
  Australian territory, let alone fall in love with an Australian,” Rose says.
  Like Lana, many detainees on Nauru and Manus were medically evacuated to
  Australia because of the dire conditions in offshore detention. Rose estimates
  dozens now have Australian partners and children and are living in limbo,
  neither here nor there. Having exhausted all options to secure lasting
  residency with her Australian husband and child, Lana has resolved to do what
  was once unthinkable: return to where she faced violence and persecution. Lana
  will fly to Iran and lodge an offshore application for a partner visa. There,
  she faces new dangers: as an apostate from Islam in a marriage with a
  westerner, she has refused to conform with Iran’s religious and social norms.
  “Who she is, is a complete rejection of what a woman should be in Iran,” Rose
  says. Lana says: “They told me, ‘If you want to change to a different visa,
  your option is to go back to your country.’ I said, ‘What about my [child]?’
  They said, ‘This is your problem.’ “It’s very sad to just leave my [child]
  here and go, and I don’t know what’s happening in my country, it’s not safe,”
  she says. “But what choice have I got?” ‘Shameful indictment’ As a signatory
  to the Refugee Convention, Australia has agreed not to return refugees to the
  countries in which they fear persecution. Rose believes if Lana returns to
  Iran she would be a victim of constructive refoulement – when a state creates
  a set of circumstances that forces a refugee’s return to their country of
  origin without being deported. The home affairs department has booked Lana on
  a flight to Iran – with a baggage allowance included only after further
  advocacy. An 11th-hour intervention by a minister remains the family’s best
  hope. On at least a weekly basis, Rose and her team contact home affairs
  seeking confirmation that their request for intervention is before the
  minister or assistant ministers and is being escalated. She has also contacted
  ministers’ offices directly. Scott believes the government does not want to
  set a precedent by allowing Lana to stay freely. He says the way Lana’s case
  has been handled from the moment she learned of her pregnancy has been
  “horrific”. Scott initially believed boat arrivers were “visa jumpers and
  terrorists trying to sneak in the country”, but his “whole mindset” changed.
  “We live in a civilised place,” he says. But Lana’s case is “so obscenely
  immoral and verging on criminal”. Josephine Langbien, an associate legal
  director of the Human Rights Law Centre, says 12 years of successive
  governments “have inflicted ongoing punishment on people who came here seeking
  safety, but were instead sent to face abuse, medical neglect and inhumane
  conditions in regional processing centres or years of uncertainty in
  Australia”. “It is a shameful indictment on the Albanese government that
  anyone would be forced to risk their life in order to exercise their
  fundamental right to live together with their family in safety.” Home affairs
  says 90% of offshore partner visas of the class Lana will apply for are
  processed within 25 months. That means she should be back home in Australia by
  September 2027 if all goes to plan in Iran. “Then I’ve got no one telling me
  ‘You are from Nauru’,” she says. “Then I’m a normal person, like other people
  living in Australia. Then I’ve got freedom.” A home affairs spokesperson said
  the department could not comment on individual cases. According to
  “longstanding and consistent” government policy, “individuals seeking to enter
  Australia by boat without a visa will not be settled here”, they said.
  “Transitory persons (those who arrived unlawfully by boat and were transferred
  to a Regional Processing Centre) do not have a settlement pathway in Australia
  and are expected to engage in third country migration options and depart.” *
