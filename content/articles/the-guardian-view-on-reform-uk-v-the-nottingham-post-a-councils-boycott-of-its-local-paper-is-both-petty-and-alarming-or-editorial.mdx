  The Guardian view on Reform UK v the Nottingham Post: a council’s boycott of
  its local paper is both petty and alarming | Editorial

  The decision by Nottinghamshire council’s Reform UK leader, Mick Barton, to
  ban his councillors from speaking to the Nottingham Post is as absurd as it is
  troubling. The recently elected leader of a council with a budget of £668m
  ought to be eager to communicate with residents about his plans. Yet Mr
  Barton’s skin is apparently so thin that just three months after winning
  power, he announced the boycott in response to a news report about local
  government reforms. An earlier row focused on a video interview given by James
  Walker-Gurley, which went viral after the cabinet member struggled to answer
  questions. This was embarrassing. But there was nothing unusual about the
  issues raised by the reporter, or about the local government story that
  prompted the ban. The Nottingham Post’s journalists were simply doing their
  job of scrutinising public authorities. Labour’s proposed overhaul of local
  government in England is far-reaching. In counties including Nottinghamshire,
  ministers aim to replace multiple tiers with one and create new mayoralties.
  The area covered by Nottingham city council is likely to be expanded. It is
  right that such changes are debated, and unsurprising if local politicians
  disagree about the details. Yet rather than tell Mr Barton to stop picking
  fights with the press and concentrate on running the county, senior party
  colleagues, including the local MP Lee Anderson, have announced that they are
  joining in. They won’t talk to the Nottingham Post either. The paper, founded
  in 1878, has a strong track record despite facing huge challenges – along with
  other local news organisations – due to competition from social media and
  falling advertising sales. Last year, it successfully defended a complaint
  from Nottinghamshire police after publishing a story that revealed how they
  had tried to hide details of their contact with Valdo Calocane before he
  murdered three people. Natalie Fahy, the editor, described this row as part of
  a pattern of encroachment on press freedoms. Just last month, Nigel Farage
  depicted himself as an enemy of censorship when announcing a policy of
  repealing online safety laws. But his failure to stand up for the press in
  Nottingham is as unsurprising as it is hypocritical. Mr Farage is against
  attempts by governments to regulate the internet – but not against Reform
  politicians rejecting norms of democratic scrutiny. He borrows the language of
  free expression only when it suits him. Given their party’s track record and
  fixation on immigration, it was never likely that the 670 men and women
  elected as Reform councillors in May, to run 10 councils mostly in the
  Midlands and north of England, would be the advocates that these communities
  need. But unlike Mr Farage, many of these new councillors were largely unknown
  figures, even in their communities. While all should not be tarred with the
  same brush, it is disturbing to see such petulance and illiberalism displayed
  in Nottingham so early in the new council’s term of office. If events in
  Nottinghamshire were repeated at a national level, this could mean a
  government refusing to speak to sections of the press or, say, the BBC. This
  is a chilling prospect. But the local consequences must be taken seriously
  too. Local news sources, and journalists whose job it is to scrutinise
  decision-makers, are not a throwback or an adjunct to democracy. They are a
  vital part of it.
