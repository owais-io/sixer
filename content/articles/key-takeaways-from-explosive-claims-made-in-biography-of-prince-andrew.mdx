  A new biography claims startling insight into the private lives of the Duke of
  York and his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson. From relationships with women to
  Andrew’s mysterious finances, Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of
  York, by the historian Andrew Lownie, also dives into the prince’s ill-advised
  friendship with the disgraced US financier Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew’s
  representatives were contacted for comment. Claims from the extracts
  serialised in the Daily Mail include: Andrew and Epstein Lownie claims that,
  although Andrew claimed to have met Epstein in 1999, “the truth is he and his
  ex-wife Sarah had known the financier for almost a decade by then”. Lownie
  writes Andrew “was easy prey for a rattlesnake like Epstein”, and adds:
  “Epstein played Andrew. The prince was a useful idiot who gave him
  respectability, access to political leaders and business opportunities. He
  found him easy to exploit.” Lownie quotes the US businessman Steven
  Hoffenberg, said to be Epstein’s “mentor” and a convicted fraudster, as saying
  Andrew was his “Super Bowl trophy”. Secrets passed to foreign officials
  Compromising material on Andrew may allegedly have been passed to Israel’s
  Mossad secret service, Saudi Arabian authorities and Muammar Gaddafi’s Libyan
  intelligence services by Epstein, according to the book. Lownie credits a
  documentary by the Canadian journalist Ian Halperin, writing the claims were
  “confirmed” to Halperin by “many in Andrew’s circle”. Although some of
  Epstein’s victims have alleged the financier kept video recordings of
  high-profile friends having sex with women, no proof has been made public to
  date. The claim Epstein boasted of planning to sell Andrew’s secrets to the
  Mossad, first reported by the US Sun, was made by Hoffenberg. Was Putin passed
  Andrew material? Compromising material on Andrew may also have ended up in
  Russian hands, Lownie claims. He examines British intelligence fears, first
  reported by the Sunday Times, that John Mark Dougan, a former deputy in Palm
  Beach county sheriff’s office, fled to Russia with copies of files on the
  Epstein investigation and was in touch with Pavel Borodin, a “mentor” of
  Putin. Lownie writes: “Asked what might be in the files, Dougan said: ‘Lots of
  videos, but I wasn’t going to sit around and watch them. Also lots of scanned
  documents.’” Dougan, a former US marine, has previously been described by the
  BBC as spreading a number of disinformation claims from Russia. Harry, Meghan
  and Andrew According to Lownie, Prince Harry gave Andrew a “bloody nose”
  during a heated argument at a 2013 family gathering. This has been denied by
  Harry. Another allegation that Andrew made disparaging remarks to Harry about
  how long his marriage to Meghan Markle would last was also denied. A
  spokesperson for Harry and Meghan said: “I can confirm Prince Harry and Prince
  Andrew have never had a physical fight, nor did Prince Andrew ever make the
  comments he is alleged to have made about the Duchess of Sussex to Prince
  Harry.” The spokesperson confirmed a legal letter from Prince Harry’s counsel
  had been sent to the Mail. In 2021, after Meghan was accused of bullying
  staff, which she has denied, Lownie also claims: “Buckingham Palace braced
  itself for historic complaints about Prince Andrew’s bullying, profanities and
  impossible demands. Some say a report on bullying accusations against Meghan
  Markle has never been released because it would also raise questions about the
  behaviour of the queen’s second son.” Mysterious finances With no obvious
  source of income beyond his Royal Navy pension, family money he may have
  inherited and handouts “first from the queen and now King Charles”, Lownie
  questions how Andrew can afford the 30-room Royal Lodge, which he spent £7.5m
  refurbishing and which has annual running costs of about £250,000. He revisits
  how £750,000 from Turkish millionaire Nebahat Isbilen ended up in Andrew’s
  Coutts account, according to 2022 high court papers from an action between
  Isbilen and her banker, Selman Turk, for misuse of funds. Andrew’s office
  described it as a gift for Princess Beatrice’s wedding, but it was later
  repaid. Andrew’s holiday to Tunisia with the convicted Libyan gun-smuggler,
  Tarek Kaituni, who is also said to have presented Beatrice with an £18,000
  solitaire diamond necklace for her 21st birthday, are among several allegedly
  questionable relationships examined in the book. Personal life There are
  various eye-popping claims about Andrew’s sex life, as well as stories
  alleging a vulgar sense of humour. One claim is that more than 40 women were
  brought to his hotel room during a stay in Bangkok. “Hotel staff were used to
  foreigners bringing in girls, but amazed that more than 10 a day were going to
  Andrew’s room,” Lownie writes. As to claims over bullying, the book makes
  many, including that of Andrew calling a palace staff member a “fucking
  imbecile” for not referring to Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother by her full
  title.
