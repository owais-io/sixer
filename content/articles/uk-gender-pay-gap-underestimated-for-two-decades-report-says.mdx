  The UK’s gender pay gap has been underestimated for more than 20 years,
  according to research that could raise fresh questions about the quality of
  data used to inform key pay decisions across the UK. The findings, released in
  the British Journal of Industrial Relations on Monday, suggest that, since
  2004, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) had failed to properly account
  for the fact that it received more data from larger employers, when it
  reported its annual survey of hours and earnings (Ashe). It meant the survey
  gave undue weighting to large businesses, where pay was higher and the
  difference in pay between men and women was generally smaller. As a result, it
  gave too little to smaller private businesses, particularly surrounding pay
  and representation for women. That resulted in the ONS consistently
  underestimating the gender pay gap by a “small but noteworthy” margin of one
  percentage point, the research paper said. The research paper’s lead author,
  Prof John Forth from the Bayes Business School at City St George’s, University
  of London, said the data collected in this annual survey “has far-reaching
  consequences across our society, informing everything from official pay
  recommendations for doctors and nurses to anti-poverty measures like the
  national minimum wage. It is, therefore, crucial that the data is a true
  representation of wages and earnings in modern Britain.” The flawed data may
  have influenced key pay decisions. The Ashe survey is used by the Low Pay
  Commission to monitor the impact of the minimum wage, and by the Office for
  the Pay Review Bodies to help determine public sector pay settlements. It is
  the latest blow to the ONS, which has struggled with mounting problems that
  have forced it to delay or cancel several of its releases in recent months The
  ONS did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for comment but told
  the Financial Times that the survey’s sampling and weighting was under review
  and that the agency had improved its approach to the survey since 2024 in a
  way that would address some of the issues raised in the report. “Weighting
  schemes are just one aspect of the methodology of a complex survey such as
  Ashe, and we regularly scrutinise these methods to ensure they continue to be
  relevant and aligned to best practice,” the ONS added. Forth said he welcomed
  the ONS review. “We encourage them to look at how the data can be made more
  representative of jobs in all types of organisations, so that the issues we
  observed can be addressed.”
