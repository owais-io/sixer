  An easyJet flight captain has been suspended pending an investigation after
  claims that he wandered naked around a luxury hotel at the end of an all-night
  drinking session. The pilot, who has not been named, was seen without any
  clothes in the reception of a five-star hotel on the Atlantic resort island of
  Sal, Cape Verde, early last Tuesday. According to the Sun, which first
  reported the story, the captain had been drinking at the bar of the Meliá
  Dunas Beach Resort and Spa since the previous evening. It quoted witnesses who
  claimed to have seen the man stumbling in a “paralytic” state. At 2.30am he
  reportedly removed all his clothes and walked into the reception area, before
  moving to the gym and spa. The man had been due to fly passengers to Gatwick
  from Cape Verde last Wednesday. After the incident in the hotel, he was
  grounded by the airline and a replacement pilot was called up. An easyJet
  source told the Sun: “Anyone who saw the pilot cavorting naked in the early
  hours on the day before a flight would not dream of getting on a plane with
  him at the controls.” An easyJet spokesperson said: “As soon as we were made
  aware, the pilot was immediately stood down from duty, in line with our
  procedures, pending an investigation. The safety of our passengers and crew is
  easyJet’s highest priority.” EasyJet’s flights from Gatwick to Cape Verde are
  its longest from England, at 2,332 nautical miles, with the journey taking
  about six hours. • This article was amended on 13 August 2025 to make clear
  that the hotel was on the island of Sal in Cape Verde.
