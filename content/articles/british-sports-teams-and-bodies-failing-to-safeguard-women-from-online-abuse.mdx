  Most of Britain’s leading sports teams and governing bodies still have no
  specific safeguarding policies to protect women from online abuse, research
  has found. The study, which analysed the public policies of 52 organisations
  and clubs across football, cricket and rugby union, warns they are “shirking
  their duty of care, shifting the responsibility on to athletes to safeguard
  themselves” as a result. The issue made headlines again this week when the
  Lionesses’ star Jess Carter said that she had been wary of playing at Euro
  2025 after receiving racist abuse. That is only the tip of the iceberg,
  however, with Fifa finding that female footballers were 29% more likely to
  face online abuse or threats at the Women’s World Cup in 2023 compared with
  their male equivalents at Qatar 2022. Numerous female athletes from tennis,
  athletics and across sport have also spoken out against misogyny, threats and
  abuse online. When Sheffield Hallam and University College Birmingham
  scrutinised policies of clubs in the Women’s Super League, Women’s County
  Championship and women’s rugby union championships, as well as governing
  bodies such as the Football Association, they were concerned about how little
  focus there was on combating abuse of female athletes. “Clubs lack adequate
  protection against social media and are failing to manage the increased
  attention on female athletes,” they say. “Given that female athletes face
  three times more online abuse than their male counterparts and are gaining
  more online visibility, this is especially concerning.” “No clubs or
  organisations differentiated the support or protection of social media
  policies for women’s sports, and female athletes were only explicitly
  mentioned in the FA’s Game Changer Objectives for the women’s game,” they add.
  The study, published this week in the Communication &amp; Sport journal,
  acknowledges some bodies have launched campaigns, but adds: “These acts are
  superficial and performative, lacking genuine care and protection, yet
  organisations are commended for them. “Campaigns often focus on racism while
  under-representing other forms of discrimination primarily targeting female
  players. This illustrates the lack of specificity regarding the protection of
  female athletes. Furthermore, it demonstrates how organisations and clubs are
  shirking their duty of care, shifting the responsibility onto athletes to
  safeguard themselves.” The study’s lead researcher, Amberlie Williams, told
  the Guardian that while some clubs did brief players on safety and security
  online, and provide them with the tools to protect themselves on social media,
  such policies did not go far enough. “We know that sports use social media as
  a way of promoting athletes and, in turn, their sport, to create more revenue
  through the women’s game,” she added. “But if we’re then not actually seeing
  policies which specifically consider the female athlete on social media and
  how they’re protected, then where do their priorities lie?” She said spurning
  social media was unrealistic. “Female athletes, in particular, rely on social
  media for things like brand sponsorships. And so boycotting social media
  removes them from that space which is a workplace for them.”
