  Gavin Newsom, California’s governor, said on Thursday that state Democratic
  lawmakers would move forward with a redistricting plan to counter the
  Republican-led map-drawing effort in Texas aimed at securing a House majority
  after the midterm elections. As he spoke at the Japanese American National
  museum’s National Center for the Preservation of Democracy – a venue
  deliberately chosen for its symbolism – federal agents, armed and masked,
  fanned out across the complex, led by Gregory Bovino, head of the border
  patrol’s El Centro sector. Local news footage showed a man being led away in
  handcuffs. Newsom, joined by congressional Democrats and legislative leaders,
  unveiled a plan, known as the election rigging response act, that would
  override California’s independent redistricting commission and draw new
  congressional lines – a direct counter to a Texas effort, sought by Donald
  Trump, to push through mid-cycle maps that could hand Republicans five extra
  US House seats. The governor vowed the move would “neuter and neutralize”
  Texas’s proposal. “Today is liberation day in the state of California,” Newsom
  declared at a rally in Los Angeles, in which he formally called for a 4
  November special election to approve a new congressional map. “We can’t stand
  back and watch this democracy disappear district by district all across the
  country.” After the rally, Newsom called the presence of border patrol agents
  “sick and pathetic” and accused Trump of ordering the operation to intimidate
  Democrats. “Wake up, America,” Newsom warned. “You will not have a country if
  he rigs this election.” The mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass, a Democrat who
  was not attending the event, arrived on the scene to condemn the raid. In
  remarks to reporters, she argued that it was not “a coincidence” the raid took
  place steps from where Newsom was speaking. “The White House just sent federal
  agents to try to intimidate elected officials at a press conference,” she said
  in a social media post. “The problem for them is Los Angeles doesn’t get
  scared and Los Angeles doesn’t back down. We never have and we never will”.”
  The Department of Homeland Security said Bass “must be misinformed”. “Our law
  enforcement operations are about enforcing the law – not about Gavin Newsom.
  CBP patrols all areas of Los Angeles every day with over 40 teams on the
  ground to make LA safe,” Tricia McLaughlin, DHS assistant secretary, said in a
  post on social media. The California map would only take effect if Texas – or
  any other Republican-led state – advanced a a partisan redistricting plan.
  Newsom said he preferred all states to adopt independent commissions, as
  California does, and had previously said in a letter to Trump that he would
  “happily” stand down if Texas abandoned its effort. Earlier on Thursday, a
  group of Texas Democrats, who had blocked a vote on the measure by fleeing the
  state, said they were prepared to end their two-week walkout when California
  releases its redrawn map proposal. Their return to the state legislature would
  allow Republicans to plow ahead. Accepting that reality, Newsom said
  California – with a population larger than the 21 smallest states combined –
  would not “unilaterally disarm”. “It’s not complicated,” he said. “We’re doing
  this in reaction to a president of the United States that called a sitting
  governor of the state of Texas and said, ‘Find me five seats.’” In a recent
  interview, Trump claimed that Republicans were “entitled to five more seats”
  in Texas because he won the state overwhelmingly in the 2024 presidential
  election. The new map, Newsom said, would remain in place through the 2030
  elections, after which mapmaking power would return to the independent
  redistricting commission, approved by voters more than a decade ago. The
  Democratic-led state legislature will introduce legislation on Monday, he
  added, expressing confidence the initiative would pass and ultimately prevail
  at the ballot box in November. California has 52 House seats – 43 held by
  Democrats – and several of the nation’s most competitive races, including a
  handful that helped Republicans claim the majority in 2024. How California
  voters will respond is uncertain: polls have found deep support for the
  state’s independent redistricting commission, suggesting Democrats will have
  to work quickly over the next three months to persuade voters to support their
  plan. Sara Sadhwani, a Democrat who served on California’s 2020 independent
  redistricting commission, said she wanted partisan gerrymandering banned
  nationwide. But in Los Angeles on Thursday, Sadhwani stood side by side with
  Newsom, lawmakers, labor leaders and advocates in support of tearing up the
  maps she helped draw. “Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures,”
  she said. Common Cause, a good government group that has long opposed partisan
  map-making, said in a statement this week that it would “not pre-emptively”
  oppose the effort by California to redraw its maps in response to partisan
  redistricting in Texas. “A blanket condemnation at this moment would be
  sitting on the sidelines in the face of authoritarianism,” the group stated.
  Eric Holder, a former attorney general and chair of the National Democratic
  Redistricting Committee, said on Thursday that he backed “responsible and
  responsive” countermeasures to Trump’s “extreme and unjustified mid-decade
  gerrymanders in Texas and beyond”. “Our democracy is under attack,” he said.
  “We have no choice but to defend it.” Republicans have denounced the
  California proposal: “Gavin Newsom’s latest stunt has nothing to do with
  Californians and everything to do with consolidating radical Democrat power,”
  Christian Martinez, the National Republican Congressional Committee
  spokesperson, said in a statement, accusing the governor of trampling the will
  of California voters to serve a “pathetic 2028 presidential pipe dream”. At
  the rally in Los Angeles, there was little sympathy for the nearly half-dozen
  California Republicans who could be out of job if the redistricting plan
  succeeds. Speaking before the governor, Jodi Hicks, the president and chief
  executive of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, had a message for
  the nine Republicans who backed legislation rolling back reproductive rights:
  “You take away our freedoms, we’ll take away your seats.” Texas’s pursuit of
  new maps has kicked off a redistricting “arms race” that has spread to state
  legislatures across the country. Leaders in Florida and Missouri – and in blue
  states such as New York and Illinois – are weighing similar moves. “Other blue
  states need to stand up,” Newsom said. The campaign, with a freshly launched
  website, will be enormously costly and is expected to draw national attention
  and donors eager for a high-stakes, off-year political brawl. Former
  California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican who championed
  independent redistricting, has already voiced opposition. Newsom said he had
  spoken to Schwarzenegger and shared his disdain for gerrymandering, but argued
  that this was about preserving American democracy. “It’s not good enough to
  just hold hands, have a candlelight vigil and talk about the way the world
  should be,” Newsom said. “We have got to recognize the cards that have been
  dealt. And we have got to meet fire with fire.”
