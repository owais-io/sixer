  Victorian Liberal MPs Moira Deeming and Ann-Marie Hermans have been criticised
  for comparing Daniel Andrews to a dictator amid a manhunt for a so-called
  “sovereign citizen” who allegedly killed two police officers, with Deeming
  also accusing the former premier of using police as his “personal army” during
  Covid lockdowns. Deeming on Wednesday night debated in parliament a petition
  she had sponsored opposing erecting a statue of Andrews. Passing the milestone
  of 3,000 days as premier made him eligible for one, but the Allan government
  has maintained it has no immediate plans to act on it. The Liberal MP said
  “authoritarian regimes” put up statues while their leaders were still alive as
  a “tool of political dominance, of intimidation, like with Lenin or Mao or
  Hussein”. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “We should be erring on the side of
  the tradition that honours leaders who did not lead their people into mass
  starvation and violence – but hey, that’s just me,” Deeming said. She said
  under Andrews’ leadership during pandemic lockdowns, police were “used as a
  personal army with weapons of war and no name tags”, and that “Nuremberg trial
  principles” were “totally ignored”. Deeming also referenced a 2013 car crash
  involving Andrews and his wife when he was opposition leader. The family of
  the teenage cyclist involved are preparing to bring a private criminal
  prosecution against Andrews. She told Guardian Australia the debate slot was
  planned weeks before the deaths in Porepunkah, with her speech also referring
  to the expense of a statue amid a cost-of-living crisis. “Linking those poor
  police who were killed in the line of duty to a petition presented in
  parliament about a statue is absolutely disgusting,” Deeming said. Hermans
  spoke in support of the petition, telling the chamber: “The erosion of
  democratic principles in this state under the leadership of the former
  premier, Mr Daniel Andrews, cannot go without comparisons to Joseph Stalin”.
  Just half of the Coalition’s 14 upper house MPs voted on the motion to
  formally take note of the petition. It was comprehensively defeated. The
  opposition leader, Brad Battin, held a party room meeting on Thursday to
  express his disappointment and anger about the duo’s comments. “I have sent a
  very clear message: I’m disappointed in the comments. I’m angry about what has
  happened, and I will be ensuring that each and every one of them must have a
  focus, and that focus is on Victorians,” Battin reportedly said. Sources at
  the meeting, which also included Nationals MPs, said Battin “blew up” and told
  MPs they should “become independents if they want to go off message”. Speaking
  outside parliament on Thursday, Hermans said her words “could have been wiser
  in reflection”. “I don’t take back the autocratic side of it, it’s a fair
  description of Daniel Andrews’ leadership. Perhaps words could have been
  chosen better in terms of Stalin, because obviously we haven’t had the sort of
  genocide and I wouldn’t want that,” Hermans said. “But at the end of the day
  we are fighting a Marxist ideology.” The police minister, Anthony Carbines,
  told ABC Radio Melbourne the commentary was “deeply offensive to police”. He
  noted at the same time as Deeming and Hermans were speaking in the chamber, he
  was at a press conference with the premier and deputy premier after the death
  of a girl in a school bus crash and the naming of the officers killed in the
  Porepunkah shooting. “It’s extraordinary that that behaviour is allowed. The
  focus of the parliament needs to be on Victorians and the hurt they’re feeling
  in a number of different tragedies that we’re dealing with this week … They
  should have really a damn good think about how they’re behaving,” Carbines
  said. Dezi Freeman, the man suspected of shooting and killing Det Leading Sen
  Const Neal Thompson, 59, and Sen Const Vadim de Waart, 35 and injuring a third
  officer, has a history of association with pseudolaw and “sovereign citizen”
  ideas. According to court records, he called police “terrorist thugs”,
  “frigging Nazis” and “Gestapo” that wore “the satanic symbol” of an “inverted
  pentagram” on their uniforms. In 2021, Freeman was arrested while at a protest
  outside Myrtleford court, over 2019 allegations of sexual-related offending,
  according to a Border Mail article. The protest was in response to a private
  prosecution brought against the then Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews,
  accusing him of treason during Covid. But it was struck out by the magistrate
  because charge information had not been provided to Andrews.
