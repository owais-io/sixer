  A proposed mega-merger of two of the largest railroad companies in the US will
  hurt jobs, raise costs for consumers and increase the risk of more
  catastrophic train crashes, according to workers and unions. Union Pacific
  proposed a $85bn deal to buy Norfolk Southern last month, which would create
  the first transcontinental railroad network in the US. As executives at Union
  Pacific seek approval from federal regulators the Surface Transportation
  Board, union leaders warn the deal heightens fears around safety – two years
  after the derailment of a Norfolk Southern train in East Palestine, Ohio,
  resulted in the release of plumes of toxic chemicals. “The entirety of the
  workers” is against the merger, claimed John Samuelsen, the president of the
  Transport Workers Union. “We’re hoping that the stakeholders in DC that are
  making determinations are going to listen and understand that when something
  like East Palestine happens, the chances of that happening under a mammothly
  merged new entity become greater and greater,” he said. “Anything that
  empowers the freight rail carriers makes them more profitable and just
  increases the levels of power that they can press is dangerous for workers,
  and actually dangerous for everybody,” Samuelsen added. “They’re already an
  incredibly difficult employer to deal with. And if they’re twice as big,
  they’ll be twice as difficult to deal with, and they’re going to move to
  reduce headcount.” The two firms expect their merger to create an “annualized
  synergy opportunity” worth $2.75bn. Samuelsen cited such savings cannot be
  achieved without reducing the workforce, a longstanding issue in the railroad
  industry. “I have had nothing but bad experiences running the TWU in dealing
  with freight rail. They appear to be unchanged from the infamous rail bosses
  of the 1880s,” he said, when railroad tycoons, dubbed robber barons during the
  Gilded Age due to their business practices, amassed immense wealth and power
  through control of the railroad industry. “They’re extremely powerful.” The
  Smart Transportation Division, the largest rail labor organization in the US,
  has also opposed the merger over Union Pacific’s safety record and labor
  practices. Since the East Palestine derailment, a railroad safety bill has
  stalled in Congress, despite JD Vance supporting it as a US senator, and the
  Trump administration has already demonstrated a strikingly more lax approach
  toward approving corporate mergers compared to the Biden administration. Six
  class I railroads currently control the majority of the rail network in the
  US: BNSF Railway, Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern, CSX, Canadian National
  Railway and CPKC, which merged from two separate railroad companies in 2023.
  The number of class I railroads in the US has dwindled from 39 in 1980. Nick
  Wurst, the general secretary of Railroad Workers United and a railroad freight
  conductor in Massachusetts, expressed concern with the power a merger of two
  class I railroad firms would yield to an already powerful industry – and
  prompt executives to try and “trim the fat” in their workforces. “It’s going
  to let them massively expand their negotiating power, not just with the
  shippers, with the customers, but also it’s going to expand their power in
  terms of negotiations with workers, and lobbying in Washington,” said Wurst.
  “I think it’s reasonable to anticipate that there’s going to be sort – of a
  hunt for redundancies. I don’t think it’s just going to affect union
  employees; it’s also going to affect management, too.” The news of a proposed
  merger has also sparked concerns that other operators, such as BNSF and CSX,
  would move to merge in response. “When I heard about this merger, I was
  horrified for the simple fact that everything that’s happened in East
  Palestine points to the fact that these rail carriers have way too much power
  the way it is,” said Jeff Kurtz, a retired railroad worker at BNSF who had
  served as the legislative and safety director at the Brotherhood of Locomotive
  Engineers and Trainmen. The merger would make Union Pacific and Norfolk
  Southern “a lot more powerful”, he added, pointing to the 1996 merger between
  the Burlington Northern Railroad and the Santa Fe Railway, which formed BNSF.
  Benefits in existing union contracts were eliminated if they weren’t included
  in both, Kurtz recalled, or the lesser benefit was adopted and applied to the
  merged workforce. “Things will get worse,” he warned. “Right now, you’ve got
  these long trains, blocking crossings, cutting towns in half. Another thing
  that you might get with this merger is them moving terminals around, and
  moving people out of these small towns. There’s not going to be a lot of
  recourse for towns to handle this stuff.” Matt Weaver, a railroad worker,
  expressed concern that the merger would force workers to travel even further
  away from home. “How do you raise a family on that? What’s in the land of
  opportunity? It’s about being a father, being a mother and being there to
  raise your kids,” he said. “How can you do that when you’re at this point, it
  could be 2,000 miles away from home? How are they going to do that? It wears
  you out to think of the stress on the employee when they expect the same
  amount of production and they’ve cut since World War One, they’ve cut 95% of
  rail labor.” The class I railroad labor force has declined from more than
  450,000 in 1980 to about 122,000 workers in 2024, he noted. “None of these
  mergers have ever been good for the workers,” said Weaver. “That doesn’t serve
  the people. It doesn’t serve the shippers. It doesn’t serve the consumer
  because it drives prices up. We’re playing Monopoly here.” Seven industry
  groups representing shippers, including the National Industrial Transportation
  League, the American Chemistry Council, and the Freight Rail Customer Alliance
  have opposed any further railroad mergers, citing the companies already have
  too much market power. Norfolk Southern deferred comment to Union Pacific. A
  spokesperson for Union Pacific declined to comment but referred to claims on
  the company’s website that the merger would be “a win” for the US economy.
  “It’s a win for our customers; it’s a win for the workforce and it’s a win for
  shareholders,” the firm has argued. “This combination will transform the U.S.
  supply chain, unleash the industrial strength of American manufacturing and
  create new sources of economic growth, safe, resilient communities and
  workforce opportunity that preserves union jobs.” They also noted that
  Transload Group, a rail transloading and logistic service provider that has
  previously partnered with Norfolk Southern, expressed support for the deal.
