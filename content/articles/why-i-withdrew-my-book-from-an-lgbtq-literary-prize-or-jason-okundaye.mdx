  Last week, I withdrew my nomination from the longlist for the Polari first
  book prize. The awards had become mired in controversy due to the nomination
  of the Irish author John Boyne, best known for The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas,
  for the main prize for his novel Earth. Four days before the longlist
  announcement, Boyne had written in the Irish Independent, celebrating JK
  Rowling “as a fellow terf” and saying of women who had “pilloried” her for her
  gender activism: “For every Commander Waterford, there’s a Serena Joy standing
  behind him, ready to pin a handmaiden down as her husband rapes her.” I think
  such a viewpoint is abhorrent, but Boyne is free to hold whatever views he
  wants. What was unacceptable was a statement from the Polari prize addressing
  the backlash, emphasising its commitment to “support trans rights and amplify
  trans voices”, but defending Boyne’s inclusion on the grounds that submissions
  are assessed purely “on the merits of craft and content” and that “within our
  community, we can at times hold radically different positions on substantive
  issues”. I immediately withdrew upon reading it, after the resignation of
  judge Nicola Dinan, who won the prize last year, and withdrawal of fellow
  longlisted author Mae Diansangu. Since then, a further judge has withdrawn and
  at least 16 authors across both lists have excused themselves from
  consideration. It was not a difficult or painful decision – I felt misled
  about the principles underpinning the organisation and I no longer cared to be
  awarded by it. I have, in the past, been shortlisted for my work alongside
  writers whose views I did not agree with. But in those instances, their
  positions didn’t undermine the stated values and politics of the prize. This
  isn’t a matter of differing views, but of an institution properly and
  accurately representing itself. The prize has always been for the entire
  LGBTQ+ community, as evidenced by previously shortlisted, and winning, entries
  from trans writers. And so it is a contradiction to include someone who is
  trans-exclusionary (terf stands for trans-exclusionary radical feminist). The
  prize claims that it does “not eliminate books based on the wider views of the
  writer”. But a prize claiming to be a celebration of LGBTQ+ inclusion should
  know that the condition of trans people isn’t reducible to a debate in which
  people are simply holding “different positions” – they are a minority group
  facing unprecedented levels of harassment and political antagonism. Not all of
  my fellow longlisted authors have chosen this path; some have, while affirming
  their commitment to trans rights, stated their intentions to remain. Avi
  Ben-Zeev (the only trans author nominated) stated his reasoning as, “If I walk
  away, I’m erasing my trans story” and regretted that “transphobia has shifted
  the conversation away from the celebration of LGBTQ+ literature”, while
  emphasising the solidarity between longlisted writers regardless of their
  decision. I can understand such a position, but I think it undermines
  collective solidarity, rather than being an example of it. I think there is
  significant power in authors acting as a collective bloc. I was particularly
  moved by the example of the US writers who withdrew from the PEN America
  literary awards last year, in protest against the institution’s lack of
  criticism of Israel’s actions in Gaza. And to me, the real celebration of
  LGBTQ+ literature has come not from the prize, but from the community that has
  rallied behind the withdrawn authors. Our withdrawal has been followed by a
  800-strong petition to remove Boyne from the longlist. That is not about him
  per se – he is obviously suffering great personal upset at this situation. It
  is, once again, about the stated aims of the organisation. We have, of course,
  been subjected to the usual name-calling: described as the “Trans Taliban” and
  “Queer Isis” by Julie Bindel; accused of being proponents of “radicalised”,
  “totalitarian” politics by Canadian novelist Allan Stratton. Some have accused
  critics of bullying Boyne, and compromising freedom of speech and expression.
  But we have not called for his books to be pulped, and evidently he has, and
  continues to be, more than free to share whatever views he likes and write as
  many books as he wants. Boyne has since issued a statement outlining his views
  on trans rights and calling on the writers who have withdrawn their
  nominations to restore themselves to the longlist, writing that he has
  “shelves full of awards at home” and that while he would not withdraw, he
  would ask the judges not to shortlist him. Perhaps some writers will take up
  this offer. But from where I stand, the response is not for Boyne to propose,
  as this action is not specifically about him – it is about Polari as an
  institution. Where does it go from here? This year’s prizes are still going
  ahead and a “shortlist” will still, somehow, be forged from the depleted pool
  of authors (PEN America, under similar circumstances, had the good sense to
  cancel its awards). Polari has also said it will be “undertaking a full review
  of the prize processes”, to avoid the “hurt and anger” caused by this year’s
  awards. I do wonder what that will look like. Poring through the public
  statements of all authors to ensure that nothing offending has been said? I
  can only hope that whatever processes are put in place will be sufficient to
  secure the confidence of the queer writers who have found themselves having to
  weather abuse and hostility for taking a public stand. Mostly, though, I think
  – with or without Boyne’s nomination – Polari needs to figure out what it
  wants to be. If it wants to be a prize that is inclusive of trans-exclusionary
  views and writers, it is free to do this and must accept that large swaths of
  the community will find this intolerable and disengage. I suspect that this
  reluctance to commit is exactly because of that. As the response to this
  boycott has shown, the swell of public support is behind those who are
  supportive of the entire LGBTQ+ community. At one time, Polari seemed to
  recognise this: Bindel herself has noted that in 2021, after “the trans train
  had chugged into town”, she was told by its organisers that her presence at an
  event would cause “a major pushback”. Polari finds itself at another
  crossroads, called upon to tell us what kind of organisation it is and where
  it really stands. Perhaps bridges will be rebuilt and the community will
  return, or we will go off and build something else. Jason Okundaye is an
