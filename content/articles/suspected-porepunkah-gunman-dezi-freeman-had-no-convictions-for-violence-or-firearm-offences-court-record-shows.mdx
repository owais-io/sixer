  The suspected Porepunkah gunman had a criminal record stretching more than 30
  years, but had not been convicted of any serious offences, court extracts
  show. Dezi Freeman, 56, made a series of threats against police, and had his
  firearms licence cancelled, in the years before allegedly killing two police
  officers at a remote property in north-eastern Victoria on Tuesday. Victoria
  police is now investigating whether its risk assessment before the incident
  was adequate. His court record, however, shows no history of violence or
  firearms-related offending. Victorian magistrates court extracts, released to
  Guardian Australia, show Freeman, formerly known as Desmond Filby, had matters
  dating back to September 1990, when he was fined in Sydney as a 21-year-old.
  Freeman, then known as Filby, was fined several times in the early 1990s in
  the city, though the court records do not say what for. Sign up: AU Breaking
  News email Because these fines of only a few hundred dollars were unpaid, NSW
  authorities issued a warrant for his arrest that would have resulted in him
  spending time in prison “in default of payment” for up to two days for each of
  the six fines. The court records show his first conviction related to
  exceeding the speed limit in Violet Town, in Victoria’s north-east, in October
  1991. He also failed to pay this $155 fine, and in 1993 he was ordered to do
  eight hours of community work. It appears he had no further interaction with
  the courts until 2018, when he appeared before the Myrtleford magistrates’
  court and a 2013 traffic camera infringement was revoked. By this time, his
  name was recorded as Dezi Bird Freeman in the court system. In February 2021,
  a charge of breaching a personal safety intervention order dating back to June
  2019 was withdrawn. Guardian Australia reported on Thursday that this matter
  is believed to relate to a neighbour, Loretta Quinn. Freeman appeared in court
  again in June 2022 and was found guilty of using a mobile phone while driving
  on the Great Alpine Road in September 2020 and refusing to provide a saliva
  sample for police. He applied for a judicial review in the supreme court,
  which was resolved last November. In documents filed as part of that supreme
  court bid, Freeman said his family, including his wife and three children
  including a one-year-old, were homeless, and “living in a van and gazebo”. He
  said they had always lived in the Alpine shire, and the family’s only source
  of income was a Centrelink payment. Freeman referred to “seven years of
  harassment and persecution by malicious police”, despite the court extract
  showing that over this period he only faced one charge, and had it withdrawn,
  and also succeeded in having a speeding fine withdrawn. “Given the dire
  situation that we are in, it only takes a straw to break the camels back. The
  loss of license is more like a tree trunk than a straw,” he wrote. “The
  curtailing of my right to travel extends directly to my family and manifests
  itself as a form of child abuse by the State in so many ways. “Whatever
  happens to me affects my family. The stress, hardships, injustice, misery and
  poverty exacerbated by not being able to drive affects us all.” Freeman said
  in his submissions he had his “firearms licenses cancelled and lost my club
  membership” as a result of the driving matter, also claiming “we endured 4
  acts of criminal trespass and harassment on our home by police and I have been
  dragged through 4 years of court hearings”. He said he had to pay more than
  $2,300 to have his wife’s van returned after it was “stolen” by police, a
  likely reference to the vehicle being impounded. Freeman, whose bid for the
  supreme court review of his driving convictions failed, wrote towards the end
  of his submissions: “I hope I didn’t get too off track or be abrasive but I’m
  just doing the best that I can under extreme duress with what sanity I have
  left.” He had been granted permission to drive while his appeal was
  outstanding, and the court records show he was convicted and fined in December
  2023 for driving at 71km/h in a 60km/h zone in June that year. He was fined
  $450 with $90 costs. The magistrate in the case was Peter Dunn, who Freeman
  previously attempted to arrest.
