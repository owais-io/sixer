  The anger was raw and resolute. Speaking at the Republican congressman Mike
  Flood’s town hall in Lincoln, Nebraska, a woman pointed to the estimated $450m
  cost of “Alligator Alcatraz”, an immigration detention facility in Florida.
  “How much does it cost for fascism?” she demanded. “How much do the taxpayers
  have to pay for a fascist country?” The crowd erupted in applause and whoops.
  In the week that Donald Trump marked his 200th day in office, few mainstream
  political commentators are bandying around terms such as “fascist”. But many
  are warning of a societal march towards authoritarianism that, far from losing
  momentum, appears to be gathering pace. Over the past month the US president
  has demanded that his predecessor, Barack Obama, be prosecuted for “treason”,
  fired the government’s top labour statistician following a weak jobs report
  and forced Columbia University to pay more than $200m in a settlement that
  many saw as capitulation. Trump has also egged on Republicans in Texas and
  other states to redraw congressional maps so they favour his party in future
  elections – turning the FBI on dissenting Democrats – and ordered a new census
  that excludes people “who are in our Country illegally”. And his
  administration has pursued a hostile takeover of the nation’s capital,
  Washington DC, threatening to place the city under federal control, promising
  to restore a Confederate statue toppled by Black Lives Matter protesters and
  executing a radical makeover of the White House itself. The trend line is
  clear to Trump’s critics. Rachel Maddow, a leading progressive TV host, told
  viewers of her show on the MSNBC network this week: “We do now live in a
  country that has an authoritarian leader in charge. We have a consolidating
  dictatorship in our country.” Terms such as “fascist”, “authoritarian” and
  “dictatorship” were once dismissed as the refuge of those suffering “Trump
  derangement syndrome”. Not any more. There is now a growing consensus that the
  pillars of US democracy are being demolished one by one. Matt Bennett, an
  executive vice-president of Third Way, a centrist thinktank hardly prone to
  hyperbole, said: “It’s getting dramatically worse by the day. The question of
  whether we’re in a constitutional crisis or whether authoritarianism has
  arrived is kind of an academic one. It’s either here or it’s going to be here
  very soon. “We’re still short of them openly defying a supreme court ruling or
  intentionally deporting US citizens or attempting to shut down a news media
  operation. But we’re not very far short.” The assault on the constitution is
  wider and deeper than in Trump’s first term, when he arrived in the Oval
  Office like a trainee pilot sitting in the cockpit of a Boeing 747,
  overwhelmed by its array of dials and controls. Now he and his allies –
  notably his deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller – know precisely which
  levers to pull and how little air resistance they are likely to meet. Having
  promised to be a dictator only on “day one”, Trump got to work pardoning
  supporters involved in the 6 January 2021 riot at the US Capitol, installing
  loyalists at the justice department and FBI and recruiting the billionaire
  Elon Musk to scythe through government agencies, sidelining Congress along the
  way. The president repeatedly challenged judicial rulings, even calling for
  the impeachment of judges who rule against his administration. After a judge
  blocked a deportation order, Trump called him “crooked” and said he should be
  “impeached”, prompting a “rare rebuke” from the chief justice, John Roberts.
  The administration escalated attacks on media outlets it accused of
  unfavourable coverage, moving some out of their Pentagon workspace or barring
  them from the Oval Office and Air Force One. It also purged the leadership of
  the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, installing Trump himself as
  chairman. At the 100-day mark, comparisons were being drawn with autocrats
  such as Viktor Orbán of Hungary. Two hundred days in, Orbán has been left
  looking like an amateur by the speed and scale of Trump’s efforts to expand
  presidential power, undermine institutions and control information. Simon
  Rosenberg, a Democratic strategist, said: “He’s clearly made a decision to
  turn America into some form of dictatorship. There’s no way any longer to look
  away from that. The excuses – ‘Well, it can’t happen here, American civil
  society is strong enough to resist’ – may be true, but what’s clear now is
  that his aspiration is to end American democracy for all time and to turn this
  country into some kind of authoritarian state.” Among the starkest examples
  was Trump’s concerted effort to deflect attention from the Jeffrey Epstein
  files by baselessly reviving the investigation into Russia’s interference in
  the 2016 election. The attorney general, Pam Bondi, has directed federal
  prosecutors to launch a grand jury investigation into allegations that members
  of Obama’s administration manufactured intelligence. Then came the abrupt
  dismissal of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, Erika McEntarfer,
  after a jobs report showed downward revisions. Trump accused her of “faking
  the jobs numbers” and that the figures were “RIGGED in order to make the
  Republicans, and ME, look bad”, offering only “my opinion” as proof. Trump’s
  efforts to dominate US culture are far more sophisticated than in his first
  term. According to an analysis by the Axios news site, he has extracted more
  than $1.2bn in settlements from at least 13 of the most elite players in
  academia, law, media and tech. Among them was a $16m deal with Paramount that
  critics saw as a “bribe” and coincided with the cancellation of the late-night
  show of the CBS comedian Stephen Colbert, one of the most incisive satirical
  voices of the Trump era. Rosenberg added: “There’s no question that our lack
  of history with a leader like this, and the perception of American
  exceptionalism, made many institutional players in our society unprepared for
  what was to come. The key here is that the way that Trump succeeds is by
  isolating people and by not allowing people to work together collectively.”
  Funding cuts by Republicans in Congress forced the shutdown of the Corporation
  for Public Broadcasting, dealing a huge blow to the Public Broadcasting
  Service and National Public Radio. Government websites have been scrubbed of
  data on the climate and other issues – including, apparently, the constitution
  itself. Ominously, the Smithsonian National Museum of American History removed
  a reference to the 2019 and 2021 impeachments of Trump from a panel in an
  exhibition about the presidency. A Smithsonian spokesperson said the removal
  was part of a temporary fix and the exhibit eventually “will include all
  impeachments”. Although Trump has faced setbacks in the courts, he shows no
  signs of slackening his pace. Last month he signed a tax and spending bill
  that, while stripping health insurance from millions of people, includes a
  record $170bn for immigration enforcement and detention. Amid concerns over
  its masked agents snatching people off the streets, Immigration and Customs
  Enforcement (Ice) will become the biggest domestic police force in the US –
  and bigger than many countries’ armies. Larry Jacobs, director of the Center
  for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said:
  “We’re on a glide path towards the dissolution of the cornerstones of American
  democracy. It started with Trump and his threats, even to Republicans, and now
  it’s accelerated to secret police. The billions of dollars going to Ice is
  going to create the largest police force in the country and it’s beholden to
  the president.” Jacobs added: “The next backstop is going to be, will there be
  competitive elections next year? The gerrymandering in Texas may be a bad sign
  about whether Democrats and Americans who are ready to vote against
  Republicans will have that opportunity around the country.” Despite the
  concerns over an uneven playing field, the midterm elections remain Democrats’
  best chance of checking Trump’s power. They hope to harness the rage boiling
  over at Republican town halls, such as that held by Flood in Nebraska this
  week, and at protests such as “No Kings” demonstrations that brought millions
  of people to the streets. Indeed, for all his strongman posturing, Trump is
  deeply unpopular: a University of Massachusetts Amherst opinion poll released
  this week found his approval rating at just 38%, down six percentage points
  since April, though only 1% of Trump voters regret their vote. That drop
  includes men, one of the president’s most reliable groups of supporters. From
  his military parade in Washington to his bombing of Iran, from his escalation
  of immigration enforcement to his so-called “big, beautiful bill”, the
  American people are rejecting Trump’s leadership and agenda, according to
  Rosenberg, the Democratic strategist. “A majority of the country now knows
  that he’s the old man behind the curtain and not the wizard,” he said. “He
  still has control over Maga and Republicans in Congress but he doesn’t have
  the persuasive capacity any longer to keep his hold on the broad majority of
  the country. “This is a sign of his weakness and that he’s not as strong as he
  believes he is. It’s one of the reasons why he’s looking for these avenues to
  re-establish his strength and power and have there be a perception that people
  are bending the knee. “Every time he tries to do this, it fails and he grows
  more distant to the American people. That has to give us hope we have the
  tools in the coming months to start winning elections and building a more
  successful pro-democracy movement that can contain the damage that Trump and
  Maga are doing to the country in the coming years.”
