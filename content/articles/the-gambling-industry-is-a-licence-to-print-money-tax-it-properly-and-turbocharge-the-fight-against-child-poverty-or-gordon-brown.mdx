  From 1945 to 1951, a Labour government, struggling to pay down Britain’s war
  debts in what became known as the “age of austerity”, created Britain’s
  welfare state, pioneered a free National Health Service and implemented family
  allowances. In the 1970s, facing an oil shock and rising deficits, Labour
  introduced child benefit for 7 million families. By 2010, despite a global
  financial crisis, the government had raised tax credits from zero in 1997 to
  £30bn, taking millions of pensioners and children out of poverty. It is to the
  credit of Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves that within days of entering office,
  they set up the child poverty review with a remit to ensure an “enduring
  reduction in child poverty in this parliament”. Now, for a fraction of that
  £30bn spent in 2010, they can resume Labour’s historic role and take 500,000
  children out of poverty without dropping manifesto commitments. As a former
  chancellor who understands why it matters to balance the books, I sympathise
  with Reeves’s fiscal inheritance. This autumn, as growth is hit by tariffs and
  trade restrictions, and the fiscal position weakens as we come to terms with
  defence requirements, a history of low productivity and steep interest
  payments, the window for long-promised social improvements might appear to be
  closing. But having been invited to respond to the government’s consultations
  on both child poverty and gambling taxation – and following recent reports
  from the Social Market Foundation and the Institute for Public Policy Research
  (IPPR) – it’s clear that we can identify sources of revenues to fight the war
  against child poverty. The first step is raising billions by taxing the
  extraordinarily profitable gambling and betting industry, without affecting
  lotteries or bingo. There is an urgent need to act. I have not seen such deep
  poverty since I grew up in a mining and textiles town where unemployment was
  starting to bite hard. Now, each night, 1 million children in the UK try to
  sleep without a bed of their own. Two million households live without cookers,
  fridges or washing machines, and many are without toothpaste, soap or shampoo.
  It is heartbreaking that 3 million children go without meals because their
  families run out of food. The decisions of previous Tory governments have
  pushed 4.5 million children into poverty. This is a national scandal and a
  stain on our country’s soul. Britain is now enduring the worst levels of child
  poverty since modern records began, even worse than in the Thatcher-Major
  years, and far worse than in most European countries. Yet without action to
  improve family incomes, the numbers will, on the government’s own definition
  of poverty, rise to a wholly unacceptable 4.8 million children by 2029. These
  are austerity’s children, the victims of 14 years of Tory rule, an era whose
  most vindictive act was to treat newborn third and fourth children as
  second-class citizens, depriving them of all the income support available to
  their first and second siblings. By next year, every other child in cities
  such as Manchester and Birmingham will be condemned to poverty. In 2010, the
  Trussell Trust ran 35 food banks in the UK. Now, along with independent ones,
  there are 2,800. Since the election, the number of homeless children in
  temporary accommodation in England has risen by 17,510 to 169,050. This
  summer, Dickensian levels of poverty have been reported by the children’s
  commissioner. If we look into the eyes of these young Britons, we won’t like
  what we see: instead of a generation filled with optimism about the future,
  we’ll see among too many a deep, impenetrable sadness reflecting a loss of
  hope. Yet without action the government will have little chance of meeting its
  well-publicised target that 75% of children will be ready for school at age
  five. The child poverty review, when it is published, will deserve credit for
  proposing more breakfast clubs, free school lunches, family hubs and
  additional childcare. Moving thousands into better-paid jobs will also help.
  Sadly, however, none of these measures will prevent child poverty continuing
  to rise. School lunches are worth £12 a week per child, and breakfast clubs £9
  a week, but under the two-child benefit cap families have lost £66 a week for
  their third child. If they have a fourth child, the total is £132 a week. The
  Conservative party cultivated the myth that poverty is the fault of work-shy
  parents and a culture of dependency. Yet 70% of children in poverty live in
  families where someone is working but on pay too low to make ends meet. Many
  of the rest are single parents unable to work because they cannot afford
  childcare or are coping with illness in the family. Abolishing the two-child
  rule – what the children’s commissioner says has to be “the foundation for all
  else” – would cost £2bn in 2025-26 and £2.8bn by the end of the parliament. As
  the Resolution Foundation has shown, almost 500,000 children can be lifted out
  of poverty by 2029-30 at a total cost of £3.5bn. Inaction will cost more.
  Currently, local authorities and the NHS are picking up huge bills for ill
  health, homelessness and the cost of supporting children in care. For every
  100,000 children, each 1% increase in child poverty forces an additional five
  of them into care. Each child looked after by the care system costs an
  estimated £1.2m in terms of lost productivity and their use of public
  services. Excluding the lottery, betting and gaming was an £11.5bn sector last
  year that incurred only £2.5bn in tax. As much as £3bn extra can be raised
  from taxing it properly. Remote gaming duty (effectively the tax on online
  slots games) is about 35% in the Netherlands, 40% in Austria, 50% in
  Pennsylvania and 57% in tax haven Delaware, two of the few US states where it
  is legal. Yet the same activity is taxed at just 21% in the UK, raising only
  £1bn. Applying a 50% levy – much less than the 80% tax on cigarettes and the
  70% tax on whisky – would raise £1.6bn more. Raising the general betting duty
  on bookmakers’ profits from 15% to 25% could generate an additional £450m,
  after returning £100m as additional support to boost the horseracing industry.
  To achieve parity with their online equivalents, machine game duty payable on
  the revenue from in-person slot machines should also increase from 25% to 50%.
  According to IPPR estimates, this would raise an additional £880m. The
  government could then start to reduce child poverty. Unlike almost all other
  businesses, most gaming and betting is exempt from VAT. Its most addictive
  practices are responsible for social harm that costs the NHS and other public
  services more than £1bn a year. Gambling levies aren’t the only source of
  revenue that could pay to alleviate child poverty. But this should be one
  straightforward budget choice. The government can fulfil today’s unmet needs
  by taxing an undertaxed sector. Gambling won’t build our country for the next
  generation, but children, freed from poverty, will. Gordon Brown was UK prime
  minister from 2007 to 2010 Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this
