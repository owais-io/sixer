  and scary’, unreleased government report says

  An unreleased Australian government report on the economic and environmental
  risks posed by the climate crisis is “intense and scary”, and confronting even
  for those who work in the area, according to people familiar with the
  assessment. The delayed report – the national climate risk assessment –
  includes modelling of future climate damage, estimates of the number of people
  who could be killed by worsening heatwaves and a mapping tool that forecasts
  flooding risk in suburbs across the continent. Developed by the Australian
  Climate Service and the climate change department, it was delayed until after
  the May election along with other Labor climate documents, including a 2035
  emissions reduction target and a climate adaptation plan. The government is
  expected to release them within weeks – the 2035 target is due by September –
  but dates have not been confirmed. Sources who have seen drafts of the risk
  assessment said it included scenarios that showed the climate crisis would
  affect all Australians, including in ways that to date have been little
  discussed in political debate. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The analysis
  considered the climate impact on eight systems: defence and national security;
  the economy, trade and finance; First Nations values and knowledge; health and
  social support; infrastructure and built environments; the natural
  environment; primary industries and food and regional; and remote communities.
  The results suggest that under some scenarios major systems – including
  electricity networks, transport routes, food production and supply, and the
  financial sector – could struggle to cope with rising temperatures and
  escalating extreme events. One source, who spoke on condition of anonymity due
  to the sensitive nature of the report, said: “My sense is when people read it
  they have a newfound sense of where climate change will lead. It is intense
  and scary. Even for someone who has been focused on this and thinking long and
  hard about IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] reports, it’s
  confronting to read about the details and the severity of the impacts.”
  Another said: “People sometimes think things could get hotter, but it’s far
  more complex than just saying ‘it will get hot and people will have
  heatstroke.’ There is not one system that is not hard hit by climate change in
  the future.” Beyond the impact on lives, livelihoods and nature, the analysis
  is expected to prompt debate about the cost to the federal budget, and the
  extent to which the commonwealth will need to take responsibility to pay for
  preparation and recovery. Extreme weather slowed economic growth early in 2025
  and, according to the federal Treasury, cost the Australian economy $2.2bn in
  the first half of the year. The report is a major focus for institutional
  investors working out where to direct trillions of dollars. The executive
  director for policy at the Investor Group on Climate Change, Francesca
  Muskovic, said investors were already seeing physical climate damage and
  disruption to the economy, and were aware governments could not fund the
  response on their own. Muskovic said the commonwealth was already spending
  $1.6bn a year on disaster recovery, but budgeting only $215m. “This is now a
  predictable recurring cost and we need to think about how we better invest in
  preventive, risk reduction measures that reduce the recovery cost down the
  track,” she said. She said the key to increasing private investment was
  “getting an accurate and comprehensive picture of where the risks are, and
  where the investment is most needed”. The Greens leader, Larissa Waters,
  called on the government to release the risk assessment as a prelude to
  setting a “strong, science-based” emissions reduction target for 2035,
  describing it as “an explosive document that they’ve been burying for over a
  year”. “The Australian public have a right to know what’s in store for us,”
  she said. “We need the release of that climate report so that everyone can see
  what potential future lies [ahead] if our government keeps kissing the hand of
  coal and gas companies.” The Australian Conservation Foundation’s climate
  program manager, Gavan McFadzean, said the assessment was a “critical
  ingredient” in determining a 2035 emissions target and should be released
  “well in advance” of that decision. “It would be wrong for the Albanese
  government to delay its release to avoid scrutiny over whether the looming
  2035 target is ambitious enough to protect people and nature in Australia,” he
  said. A spokesperson for the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, said the
  government was “close to finalising” the report, describing it as Australia’s
  “first-ever comprehensive assessment of the risks posed by climate change
  across the country, and a plan for how we can adapt”. “We’re working hard to
  rapidly reduce emissions and strengthen our adaptation and resilience, to
  mitigate against and better prepare for the worsening impacts of climate
  change,” they said. One source familiar with the report said they did not mind
  that the report had been delayed if it meant the government responded to it
  well. “In 10 years’ time, no one will remember whether it is out this month or
  next month if it’s a good outcome,” they said. “That’s what matters for our
  kids.”
