  I am not one for aphorisms. I grew up with a water-stained copy of a
  dictionary of quotations by the toilet and, for the most part, by the toilet
  is where these things belong. But there is one saying by the American
  philosopher and yoga teacher Ram Dass that has always cheered me: “If you
  think you’re enlightened, go and spend a week with your family.” I have no
  idea if Ram Dass really said this. Just as I’m not sure if the Dalai Lama ever
  said: “Don’t let the behaviour of others destroy your inner peace.” Or whether
  Oscar Wilde believed the words he put into the mouth of Lord Illingworth in A
  Woman of No Importance: “Children begin by loving their parents; after a time
  they judge them; rarely, if ever, do they forgive them.” But as someone in the
  middle of a family holiday, I can certainly attest that any delusions about
  maturity, levity and inner tranquility are thrown firmly down the proverbial
  U-bend the moment you embark on a Big Family Trip. If you are lucky enough to
  have living parents, siblings and children, then the chances are that at least
  some of your summer will be spent sharing a sofabed with someone who has your
  eyebrows, if not your surname. A survey by Legal and General found that 46% of
  those asked think it is important to go on a multigenerational family trip
  (including immediate and extended family), although 30% of respondents said
  they feel “stressed” by the prospect of a family holiday – rising to 47% of
  parents and guardians of children aged under 18. I can practically smell the
  Sudocrem, polyester sleeping bags and cheese-and-onion crisps coming off those
  statistics as I type. Yes, we hire cottages by the sea; yes, we pitch up in
  fields full of thistles; yes, we slither into new cities, laden down with
  phone chargers and spare sandals, but we are stressed, sad and sulking while
  we do it. This is August; this is what we do. Which is where the faltering
  sense of identity comes in. As inevitable as red wine slopping on to a white
  carpet, the moment you are in the midst of your family (whether it is the one
  you grew up with, your chosen family or the ones you have created), you will
  find yourself reverting to a personality that you thought you had shed decades
  ago. Perhaps that means standing by the fridge, eating a cold sausage 20
  minutes before lunch. Maybe it is taking your sister’s T-shirt without asking
  and promptly covering it in blackberry juice. It could be leaning out of a
  toilet window overlooking your uncle’s water butt, secretly smoking a
  cigarette and wondering if you should text that person you once snogged
  outside Morrisons but never slept with. Whatever the details, you will
  regress. Your temper will shorten. Your healthy eating regime will be blasted
  to smithereens by custard creams and Kellogg’s variety packs. Of course, not
  everyone aspires to enlightenment. I may have grown up in the sort of family
  where astrological charts, transcendental meditation and yogic breathing were
  as much a part of daily life as EastEnders and Anchor butter, but I’m not
  interested in becoming enlightened, and never have been. Instead of devoting
  myself to a journey towards universal consciousness and inner peace, I spent
  much of my 20s and even 30s hoping to one day be cool. And let me tell you,
  family holidays pretty much scupper that too. Nobody looks sexy on a water
  slide; it’s impossible to feel elegantly rebellious while washing up in a
  bucket; and you cannot retain an air of mystique when your mum is loudly
  insisting that she should be given a free pot of hot water in a cafe because
  she has “brought a teabag from home”. So, this August, forget inner peace and
  outer sophistication. If you are going on holiday with your family, my advice
  is to add some people you are not related to (our best holidays by far have
  always included friends, their children, partners and other couples) or take
  up a labour-intensive cleaning schedule. For, as Zinedine Zidane* once said:
  “Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood,
  carry water.” *It was either Zinedine Zidane or Zen Buddhism – the pages of my
  dictionary of quotations are stuck together. • Nell Frizzell is a journalist
