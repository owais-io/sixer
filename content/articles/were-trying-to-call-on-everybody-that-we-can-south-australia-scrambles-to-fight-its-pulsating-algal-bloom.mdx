  ‘We’re trying to call on everybody that we can’: South Australia scrambles to
  fight its pulsating algal bloom

  New satellite imagery of South Australia’s devastating algal bloom shows it
  shifting and surging around the coast, where it has killed tens of thousands
  of marine animals. On the video, a light green smudge explodes into an angry,
  purplish red mass, indicating a high concentration of chlorophyll. It expands
  and contracts as the weather changes from January to August. “The bloom
  pulsates,” says Prof Mike Steer. Steer is the head of the South Australian
  Research and Development Institute (Sardi), which has been monitoring the
  Karenia mikimotoi bloom as it litters South Australian beaches with mounds of
  dead seaweed and carcasses of fish, sea dragons, sharks and other marine life.
  The chlorophyll concentration in the satellite imagery gives a “strong
  indication” of how severe the bloom is. Citizen scientists have recorded more
  than 32,000 dead animals from 480 species, a number likely to be a fraction of
  the actual dead, and the bloom isn’t expected to disappear anytime soon. Sign
  up: AU Breaking News email “It declines or disappears and we have a level of
  optimism … but then later on we see that oceanographic and weather conditions
  re-promote the bloom,” Steer says. “[In April] we had a couple of weather
  systems that came through. [We thought] ‘Oh, this is going to blow away, oh,
  it’s disappearing. Fantastic.’ And then the sun comes out and the weather
  clears up and it’s back again.” Blooms can last months or years, and disappear
  for a while as balance is restored, then break out again. While there are some
  potential weapons against the bloom – such as modified clay, algicides,
  physical disruptions, and even an algae called a “sea sparkle” that is a
  naturally occurring enemy – there is little hope for now. The state government
  is preparing a plan for summer when waters warm and the bloom is expected to
  take off again just as people start returning to the beach. The government has
  asked for help from a man premier Peter Malinauskas has described as “the
  foremost expert globally” on harmful algal blooms: Dr Donald Anderson, the
  director of the United States’ National Office for Harmful Algal Blooms at the
  Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. “We’re trying to call on everybody and
  anybody,” Malinauskas says. What is it Algal blooms are complex, but the
  prevailing theory is that the 2022-23 floods washed nutrients down the
  Murray-Darling Basin system and out to sea. A marine heatwave and an
  “upwelling” of nutrients from the bottom of the ocean combined to create the
  perfect conditions for Karenia mikimotoi to flourish. Deadly for various
  marine species, in humans it can cause mild symptoms such as coughing and skin
  and eye irritation. But people are still worried about its effect on them,
  their pets and on sea life without gills, including dolphins and whales. There
  are species other than mikimotoi in the bloom, and the brevetoxins
  (heat-stable neurotoxins) they emit have led to the closure of shellfish
  farms. Bi-valves – a class of aquatic molluscs – accumulate the toxins, and if
  people eat them they can suffer neurological and gastrointestinal problems.
  Anderson says Karenia mikimotoi tolerates a wide range of temperatures and
  salinity levels; it kills species and then thrives on the nutrients their
  carcasses release. It also engages in “chemical warfare” by releasing
  chemicals that damage its competitors. Anderson understands Australians’
  concern about the bloom, but he says it is not an “exceptional” phenomenon.
  China’s “green tide” of Ulva prolifera was visible from space, and in Russia,
  a bloom killed up to 95% of sea life on the Kamchatka peninsula. Florida has
  been battling “red tides” on its beaches for years, from blooms that leave
  patches of dead fish floating offshore. “This is a big one,” Anderson says of
  the South Australian bloom, “[but] it’s not the biggest.” What can be done
  Governments have scrambled to provide support to affected industries, pouring
  money into better monitoring and data collection, funding a national testing
  facility, combating misinformation and keeping people informed, and exploring
  mitigation. A form of modified clay is the most applicable and scalable
  treatment, Anderson says. It can be sprayed into the water, where it sticks to
  the algal cells and produces clumps called “floc”. “It looks like snow. And
  they will fall, they will settle,” he says. The technology has been used in
  China and Korea for decades, but it’s not approved in the US or Australia. It
  would need to be tested on a small scale to see how it works in this specific
  scenario, what the outcomes are and whether there are any unintended
  consequences. Academics have investigated if they can physically block or
  disturb the algae, pump air into the water to make “bubble curtains” to stop
  it from moving, use algicides, restore seagrass that contain algicidal
  bacteria, or restore shellfish reefs that act as filters. They say the bloom
  is far too big for these to work, but some methods could be used at high-risk
  sites, such as the breeding grounds for the giant Australian cuttlefish. The
  US National Office for Harmful Algal Blooms lists biological controls, or the
  “release of one organism to control another”, a phrase likely to bring cane
  toads to mind for Australians. Then there’s Amoebophrya, a parasite that can
  infect algae – but that has had “negative long-term consequences”. Chemical
  controls have been proposed but are “primarily conceptual in nature”. One
  experiment used crop dusters with copper sulfate, but “the broad lethality of
  copper resulted in considerable collateral mortality of other marine
  organisms”. Climate change Anderson stresses that South Australia’s experience
  is not unique, but he also warns that the climate crisis is already having a
  “huge effect” on the likelihood of more blooms. He says there is a dangerous
  bloom on Alaska’s coast, which is a pristine, cold environment. “I have a
  member of my staff on a vessel up in the Alaskan Arctic,” he says. “The reason
  we’re up there is because the waters up there have warmed so much that toxic
  [algae] is moving into those waters. “Throughout the world we’re seeing that
  kind of … range shift. There are areas that are getting warmer and more
  receptive [to blooms] but then there’s some areas that are getting too warm
  and the species can’t survive any more.” The CSIRO has long-term forecasts to
  predict marine heatwaves, which cause coral bleaching and fish kills as well
  as algal blooms and other disruptions to ecosystems. “Marine heatwave
  forecasting tells you how you might be loading the dice for a range of
  ecological impacts,” CSIRO chief research scientist, Dr Alistair Hobday, told
  the latest briefing. “Marine heatwaves are a stress test for the future as
  well because what we see today in a heatwave is what we’ll experience every
  day in 20 years’ time.” Anderson wants Australians to know that many places
  have experienced harmful algal blooms, and come out the other side. “It’s new
  and it’s scary to you,” he says. “But part of my role here is to say: ‘You’re
  not alone.’”
