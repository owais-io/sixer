  combat Sydney’s affordability crisis, critics say

  A New South Wales Labor plan to boost housing density in Sydney’s wealthy
  eastern suburbs after completing a train station half-built in the 1970s has
  been criticised by locals worried about the area’s “beauty” being impacted –
  and planning experts who argue it won’t combat the city’s affordability
  crisis. Woollahra and Edgecliff boast tree-lined streets, grand manor homes
  and art deco apartment blocks just a stone’s throw from the CBD. But residents
  are in for major change after the NSW premier, Chris Minns, announced the
  government would complete the long-abandoned Woollahra train station on the
  eastern suburbs line before rezoning the surrounding area to allow high-rise
  development. The plan was expected to add up to 10,000 new homes over 15
  years. The platforms weren’t completed in the 1970s when the line opened due
  to local community opposition. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Sarah Dixson,
  the Liberal mayor of Woollahra, said her inbox was already “flooded” with
  concerns. Announcing the station proposal on Sunday, Minns said the new
  Woollahra platforms would cost between $150m and $200m, far less than the $2bn
  needed for new metro stations. But Dixson was sceptical of that estimate and
  questioned whether the station would be built. “We’re two years into the Labor
  government’s term and this is the first test of them actually building
  something,” she told Guardian Australia. “They’ve cut a lot of ribbons.” Giles
  Edmonds, the president of the Queen Street &amp; West Woollahra Association,
  an advocacy group for residents and businesses, said locals were worried about
  the plan. Under the rezoning, buildings up to 21 stories would be allowed
  within 800 metres of Woollahra station and 400 metres of Edgecliff station. He
  said while the association wasn’t opposed to a new station, he questioned why
  it was needed, given Edgecliff and Bondi Junction stations were relatively
  nearby. “I don’t quite know why it’s needed other than they wanted the zoning
  uplift,” Edmonds said on Monday. He added the association would advocate for
  much of the new housing to be affordable, noting plans to build market-price
  apartments wouldn’t help those already struggling to buy in an area where a
  three-bedroom unit could cost more than $2.7m. Minns said on Sunday that about
  10% of the new housing would be affordable. But the details were yet to be
  finalised. “The idea that somehow building expensive apartments for the
  wealthy in Woollahra is going to create some trickle-down effects in the
  western suburbs and reduce prices there, it doesn’t make much sense,” Edmonds
  said. The plan has already sparked community pushback. Some locals worry
  existing infrastructure, including schools, won’t be able to cope with an
  influx of new residents. The seven public schools near Woollahra and Edgecliff
  were seeing student numbers decline, the government said. On average, they
  were at 72% capacity. Woollahra public school was scheduled to have a
  demountable removed from its grounds due to a lack of students. Minns told
  reporters on Sunday that “every single school” in the area was under capacity.
  But Edmonds argued Woollahra public school was “bursting at the seams”. “I
  don’t really know where that statement came from. Maybe the sewage system and
  water system can handle it – but certainly not Woollahra public school,” he
  said. Melissa Neighbour, the deputy chair of the housing advocacy group Sydney
  Yimby, noted the government’s plan would take more than a decade to realise.
  That timeline would allow more than enough community consultation, the
  pro-development campaigner said. “There’s plenty of time to plan this well and
  engage the community and bring them on the journey and ensure we’re building
  complete communities, not just building homes,” Neighbour said. “The swiftness
  of the action is absolutely warranted in a crisis this severe. We commend that
  swift action. There is still lots of time to really engage with the community.
  Of course, there are going to be upgrades needed.” Laurence Troy, an associate
  professor of urbanism at the University of Sydney, said concerns over the plan
  reflected the relatively new effort in Sydney to add more housing to places
  where people already lived. A lot of previous major development had taken
  place in industrial or repurposed commercial areas. “The important thing to
  recognise here, is that in this area, there are people living in it already,”
  Troy said on Tuesday. “Just saying we’re going to put more housing in and
  therefore the community benefits, that is not necessarily the case. If this
  just becomes a very high-end market development, which it almost certainly
  would be under the current proposal … this is not going to do anything for
  [affordability]. “There needs to be proper thought into who benefits from this
  kind of change.” Troy argued that concern from Liberals was a case of the
  “shoe’s on the other foot now”. Previous Coalition governments had built
  unpopular projects like WestConnex in traditional Labor and Green seats, he
  said. “Perhaps [Labor] may be able to get away with it politically because
  they’re doing it in a blue-ribbon seat, so the potential for that kind of
  electoral backlash is far diminished because they’ll probably never expect to
  win that area in parliament anyway.” Neighbour said criticism focused on new
  homes in Woollahra and Edgecliff being expensive ignored the fact that any new
  dwellings would help boost the overall supply. “There is the criticism, this
  will be high-end luxury homes,” she said. “We find that a bit of a Nimby cry.
  We actually need all types of housing.” Neighbour cited research that
  suggested the creation of luxury units could help prices fall elsewhere. A
  2024 report into housing supply challenges urged the NSW government to relax
  planning controls in areas where development was most feasible – notably the
  eastern and northern suburbs close to the CBD. The report found that more
  infill would lead to a fall in home prices on the urban fringe, “reducing the
  incentive to hoard or speculate” in outlying areas. James Allison, a retiree
  who lives in the area, was standing outside the future station in Woollahra on
  Monday afternoon. He said he wandered up to the site to see what the
  government was planning. “How are they going to fit 10,000 people?” Allison
  said. “I looked up the plan view and I’m thinking you’re going to have to have
  very high apartments to house that many and that’s going to rile all these
  little manor houses here.” As he spoke, a man in a builder’s van drove past,
  yelling: “You can build 10,000 homes there apparently. It’s controversial!” A
  spokesperson for Minns said there were no government plans to build above the
  station at present. Kellie Sloane, the NSW Liberal MP for Vaucluse, said she
  was not opposed to a new station “in principle” and supported new housing
  development. But she said she had “grave concerns” about the lack of community
  consultation so far and Minns’ assertion that the plan “can’t be stopped”.
  Adding “10,000 homes around Woollahra and Edgecliff would be tripling the
  population size,” Sloane said. “Those numbers are fanciful. The math has not
  been done on that project.” Sloane added she had not received a phone call
  from the premier’s office. It was “pretty offensive to the community that the
  local member has been left out of briefings,” she said. “A lot of people will
  be offended by the lack of planning, the lack of consultation. They’ve started
  at the end game rather than done the work to make sure that this would be a
  success.” Minns maintained the project had been under consideration for 50
  years after Woollahra station was scuttled in the 1970s. He said it was time
  to move forward as Sydney grew and the government worked to address the
  housing crisis. “This idea has been consulted for 50 years, and the time to
  make a decision is now,” the Labor leader said on Sunday. During a budget
  estimates hearing on Monday, the NSW planning minister, Paul Scully, couldn’t
  say when work began on the Woollahra rezoning plan. But, he said, governments
  had been looking at the area for development “over the last 50 years”. Scully
  said the 10,000 figure was modelled on “a range of options” and emphasised the
  target was for “up to 10,000” homes to be built. “We’re confident that there
  are several thousand … homes available in those areas,” the minister said.
  Sloane said there was more to Woollahra than its closeness to the CBD. “It’s
  not just proximity to the city that makes this area incredible. It’s the
  character, it’s the leafy streets,” she said. “Its beauty … is worth
  protecting.” Minns said on Sunday that while his Labor government would
  consult with the community, the state planned to forge ahead with the plan no
  matter what. “So we’re going ahead with this. We’re committing the funds,
  we’re building the station, we’re going to lead a state-led rezoning. “Of
  course, we’ll speak to the local community, but it can’t be stopped. It’s too
  important for Sydney for us to push it down the road.” Scully was also quizzed
  on other “plan B” options on Monday. Although a Rosehill metro station has now
  been ruled out, the planning minister said he expected a draft rezoning plan
  for more density in pockets of the suburb and neighbouring Camellia would be
  ready by the end of the year. A plan for increased density around the metro
  station at Cherrybrook in Sydney’s northern hills would be made public next
  month, Scully said. The minister did not rule out changes to allow increased
  density at Glebe Island and the Bays precinct. - Additional reporting Penry
