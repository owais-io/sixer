  “There is a connection, hard to explain logically but easy to feel, between
  achievement in public life and progress in the arts,” are among the words
  inscribed in marble at the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in
  Washington. The age of Elizabeth was the age of Shakespeare, it says. The age
  of Donald Trump is the age of Trump’s ego. Trump the president,
  commander-in-chief and master builder. Trump the supremo of the upcoming
  Olympics, football World Cup and America’s 250th birthday. Trump whose
  self-aggrandisement is the size of a planet: on Wednesday not even the Kennedy
  Center’s cavernous Hall of Nations could contain it. The president announced
  that he will host this year’s Kennedy Center Honors – after all, he used to be
  on The Apprentice, so how hard can it be? He unveiled this year’s honourees –
  screened by him to veto “wokesters” – and grumbled that he had never been one.
  He reminded everyone that he has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Nearby,
  the giant bust of Kennedy may have shed a tear or two as Trump, wearing dark
  suit, white shirt and red tie, strode into the marble-walled, red-carpeted
  Hall of Nations to continue his hostile takeover of the nation’s capital – and
  the country’s cultural life. The 100ft-high arts complex on the banks of the
  Potomac River and its annual arts awards might seem trivial in the scheme of
  Trump’s authoritarian crusade. But there are few better measures of how his
  second term is proving more ambitious, intentional and effective than his
  first. Trump 1.0 never set foot in the Kennedy Center. Each year the Honors
  took place without him, with recipients including his critics such as as Cher,
  Lin-Manuel Miranda and Sally Field. And there were diverse lineups: Gloria
  Estefan, LL Cool J, Lionel Richie, Debbie Allen, Berry Gordy, Gladys Knight
  and Queen Latifah. Trump 2.0 has been a very different proposition in his
  targeted approach to immigration and crime, his vendettas against political
  opponents and his bullying of law firms, media companies and universities.
  Suddenly the Kennedy Center, like the Smithsonian Institution’s museums, finds
  itself in the line of fire of Trump’s war on woke. Like Shakespeare’s Richard
  III, who feigns reluctance to take the throne as a tactic to appear more
  virtuous, Trump claimed he didn’t really want to take on hosting
  responsibilities when his staff asked. “I said: ‘I’m the president of the
  United States! Are you fools, asking me to do that?’ ‘Sir, you’ll get much
  higher ratings.’ I said: ‘I don’t care, I’m president of the United States. I
  won’t do it.’” But then, in his telling, his chief of staff, Susie Wiles,
  intervened. “I said, OK, Susie, I’ll do it. That’s the power she’s got. So I
  have agreed to … They’re going to say: ‘He insisted.’ I did not insist but I
  think it will be quite successful actually. It’s been a long time. I used to
  host The Apprentice finales and we did rather well with that.” The Kennedy
  Center Honors were established in 1978 and recipients have included George
  Balanchine, Warren Beatty, Aretha Franklin, Tom Hanks, Arthur Miller, Stephen
  Sondheim and Barbra Streisand. Trump remarked: “I wanted one. I was never able
  to get one.” A group of Trump lackeys sitting stage left burst into laughter
  then realised he wasn’t joking and fell silent. “It’s true, actually. I would
  have taken it if they would have called me. I waited and waited and waited and
  I said: ‘To hell with it, I’ll become chairman and I’ll give myself an honour.
  Maybe next year we’ll honour Trump, OK?” All right, now that time he was
  joking. Wasn’t he? Trump announced a characteristically white male-heavy list
  for this year’s honourees: actors Michael Crawford and Sylvester Stallone,
  singers George Strait and Gloria Gaynor, and members of the rock band Kiss. As
  he spoke of each, a curtain was pulled back on their photo in very retro,
  low-tech style. Crawford, he noted, was born in England in 1942 and made his
  Broadway debut in 1967. “I was there. I shouldn’t say that but I was there. It
  seems like a long time ago, and he became an international sensation in the
  1980s for his original portrayal of the Phantom of the Opera – one of the
  greatest ever, ever, ever, ever.” It was hardly surprising from a man whose
  cultural tastes refuse to acknowledge the existence of the 21st century,
  though there was no mention of the 70s British sitcom Some Mothers Do ’Ave ’Em
  in which Crawford played accident-prone Frank Spencer, known for the
  catchphrase “Ooh Betty!” Stallone’s characters Rambo and Rocky are more
  Trump’s style: macho, muscular, primal, violent, taking no prisoners. The kind
  of great white hopes that he would now like to see policing the streets of
  Washington. The president mused: “Rocky, Rambo – if you did one, you’re good.
  You do two? “I’ll never forget I was a young guy and I went to see a thing
  called Rambo and it had just come out. I didn’t know anything about it but I
  was in a movie theatre – like we used to go to movie theaters a lot – and I
  said: ‘This movie is phenomenal! What the heck?’ And that turned out to be a
  monster.” Trump described Stallone as one of the biggest names on the
  Hollywood Walk of Fame but then remembered this is supposed to be all about
  him. “In fact, the only one that’s a bigger name on the Hollywood Walk of
  Fame, they say, is a guy named Donald Trump. I’m on the Hollywood Walk of Fame
  too, if you can believe that one.” Strait, Gaynor and Kiss met with his
  approval too. Trump might have stopped five wars in the past six months, by
  his own estimate, but he still had time to handpick the Kennedy Center
  honourees and make sure no agitators, dissidents or subversives slipped
  through the net. The role of the artist is the worship of Trump. “I would say
  I was about 98% involved,” he remarked. “They all went through me … I turned
  down plenty. It went too woke. I turned I had a couple of wokesters. Now, we
  have great people. This is very different than it used to be. Very different.”
  The Oscars, he said, now gets “lousy ratings” because “it’s all woke” and “all
  they do is talk about how much they hate Trump.” Just as he is vowing to make
  Washington DC beautiful again, Trump has big plans for the Kennedy Center,
  which at least one Republican in Congress has proposed renaming after him.
  Trump promised to “fully renovate” the entire infrastructure, ripping out and
  replacing all the seats, and make it a “crown jewel” of arts and culture in
  the US. “The bones are so good,” he cooed. But if his White House desecration
  is anything to go by, expect the Kennedy Center to become a monument to
  dictator chic, dripping in rococo gold and festooned with garishness. Another
  Kennedy quotation inscribed on the exterior marble wall says: “This country
  cannot afford to be materially rich and spiritually poor.”
