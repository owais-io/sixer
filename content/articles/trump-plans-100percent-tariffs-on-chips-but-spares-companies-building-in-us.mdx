  Donald Trump said he would impose a 100% tariff on foreign computer chips,
  likely raising the cost of electronics, autos, household appliances and other
  goods deemed essential for the digital age. “We’ll be putting a tariff on of
  approximately 100% on chips and semiconductors,” Trump said in the Oval Office
  while meeting with Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook. “But if you’re building in the
  United States of America, there’s no charge.” The Republican president said
  companies that make computer chips in the US would be spared the import tax.
  During the Covid-19 pandemic, a shortage of computer chips increased the price
  of autos and contributed to an overall uptick in inflation. Trump and Cook
  were meeting on Wednesday to discuss an agreement for Apple to invest $100bn
  in manufacturing in the US over the next four years. That comes after the
  iPhone maker already pledged to invest $500bn domestically earlier this year.
  With Apple’s new investment, the total figure is now at $600bn. Apple has been
  propped up as an example of a tech company that’s based in the US but conducts
  much of its manufacturing abroad. The vast majority of Apple’s products are
  made in China, for example, with about 90% of iPhones assembled there. Cook
  has met with Trump several times since the president took office to discuss
  more manufacturing in the US. The world’s largest contract maker of chips,
  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), was “exempt” from the
  tariff, an official told a parliamentary briefing in Taipei on Thursday. South
  Korea’s top trade envoy, Yeo Han-koo, said that Samsung Electronics and SK
  Hynix would also not be subject to the 100% levy. Nvidia, one of the largest
  chipmakers in the US, would likely be exempt from the tariff because the
  company has manufacturing facilities in the US. Inquiries sent to Nvidia and
  chipmaker Intel were not immediately answered. However, the plan could be harm
  other countries in Asia, with the president of the Semiconductor &amp;
  Electronics Industries in the Philippines Foundation, Dan Lachica, saying that
  with about 70% of the country’s exports being semiconductors, the new rules
  would be “devastating”. Demand for computer chips has been climbing worldwide,
  with sales increasing 19.6% in the year ended in June, according to the World
  Semiconductor Trade Statistics organization. Trump’s tariff threats mark a
  significant break from existing plans to revive computer chip production in
  the United States. He is choosing an approach that favors the proverbial stick
  over carrots in order to incentivize more production. Essentially, the
  president is betting that higher chip costs would force most companies to open
  factories domestically, despite the risk that tariffs could squeeze corporate
  profits and push up prices for mobile phones, TVs and refrigerators. By
  contrast, the bipartisan Chips and Science Act signed into law in 2022 by Joe
  Biden provided more than $50bn to support new computer chip plants, fund
  research and train workers for the industry. The mix of funding support, tax
  credits and other financial incentives were meant to draw in private
  investment, a strategy that Trump has vocally opposed. Trump’s new 100% tariff
  on foreign computer chips is set to be officially announced next week and is
  expected to apply to all countries and companies.
