  A manhunt is under way after two Victorian police officers were killed and
  another wounded at a shooting at a rural property in the High Country town of
  Porepunkah. In a statement late on Tuesday afternoon, Victoria police
  confirmed two on-duty officers had been shot and killed and a third seriously
  injured during the incident on Tuesday morning, with the alleged offender
  still on the run. The officers were among 10 officers who attended a property
  on Rayner Track, shortly after 10.30am today, to execute a search warrant. “I
  can confirm, tragically, that two of our fine Victoria police officers today
  lost their lives in the line of duty,” chief commissioner Mike Bush said in a
  video accompanying the statement. “They were fired upon. The two deceased
  officers are still at the scene. A third officer was seriously injured and is
  currently in surgery in hospital.” Police said no other officers were injured
  but they remain at the property. The injured officer is in a serious but
  stable condition. “The exact circumstances surrounding the incident are still
  being determined and it remains an active and ongoing situation,” they said.
  Sign up: AU Breaking News email Victoria police said it was believed the
  alleged offender had since left the property in the state’s Alpine region and
  his whereabouts remained unknown. Bush said all specialist resources had been
  deployed into the area to find the alleged offender and arrest them. This
  includes detectives from the homicide, armed crime and fugitive squads, as
  well as the special operations group and critical incident response team. “I
  want to further assure the rural community around Bright that we will do
  everything to bring this person into custody so that your community is safe.
  Can I please ask you just to stay at home, not go out and about at the moment,
  until this operation is concluded,” he said. The mayor of Alpine shire, Sarah
  Nicholas, offered her heartfelt condolences to the friends, family and
  colleagues of the two police officers “tragically killed”. “Today has been a
  day of deep sorrow and shock for our community,” she said in a video
  statement, during which she appeared visibly emotional. “We hold our police in
  the highest regard. They serve with courage, compassion, and dedication, and
  their loss is felt profoundly across our region. We are deeply grateful for
  their service and commitment.” She said all council facilities across the
  shire, which also takes in Bright, Dinner Plain, Mount Beauty and Myrtleford,
  would be closed until further notice and a meeting planned for Tuesday night
  had been cancelled. The federal MP for Indi, Helen Haines, said it was
  “utterly heartbreaking” that two police officers serving the community would
  not make it home at the end of their shift. “This appalling event has shaken
  not only Porepunkah, but communities right across the north east, and indeed
  the nation. While we may be geographically spread, we are close-knit, and in
  moments like this we feel the loss together,” Haines said. Ovens Valley MP Tim
  McCurdy, whose state electorate takes in Porepunkah, described the deaths as
  “heartbreaking”, “tragic” and “senseless”. He said his heart was also with the
  community as the manhunt continues to find the offender. “It’s still pretty
  scary out there for them,” McCurdy said. “We need it to end tonight before it
  gets dark, hopefully and get to a conclusion, and then we can start to unravel
  what’s happened.” The secretary of Victoria’s Police Association, Wayne Gatt,
  said members were “devastated” by the “senseless” deaths of “our mates,
  colleagues and dearly loved family members”. Gatt said the loss of officers
  was “difficult to comprehend” and the association was assisting all members
  involved and their families. Earlier, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese,
  said his thoughts were with the police. Both the premier, Jacinta Allan, and
  opposition leader, Brad Battin, used question time to acknowledge the state’s
  police and emergency services. After police confirmed the deaths, Battin, a
  former officer, said he was “shocked and saddened” by the news. “Police
  officers know their job is dangerous – but they do it anyway to protect us. To
  the families who are mourning today, know that every Australian is with you,”
  Battin said in a joint statement with opposition police spokesperson, David
  Southwick. “Our thoughts are also with all Victorian police officers who will
  be feeling this loss deeply. We know your work is hard. The dangers you face
  are real. And your sacrifices are often unrecognised. Today we acknowledge
  your courage.” Earlier in the day, a local caravan park and the Porepunkah
  primary school went into lockdown as police searched for the offender. By
  Tuesday afternoon, the school’s principal, Jill Gillies, confirmed almost all
  the students had returned home. “It’s been quite an ordeal,” she told ABC
  Melbourne. Local businesses have closed, with the Porepunkah Pub offering to
  prepare meals for police officers on the scene, and the airstrip providing
  fuel for the air wing.
