  Since its premiere in 2013, Duncan Macmillan’s one-person play about
  depression has gradually become a cult hit. It’s been performed in more than
  80 countries and now – finally – makes its West End debut. There’s a starry
  rotating cast, kicking off with Lenny Henry and also including original
  performer Jonny Donahoe, as well as Ambika Mod, Sue Perkins and Minnie Driver.
  Jeremy Herrin directs alongside Macmillan and a posse of leading producers are
  backing the show. It all screams smash hit. But there’s something about the
  scale and downright snazziness of this production that doesn’t quite gel. The
  setup is simple. It’s about a young boy who, after his mum does “something
  stupid” when she has acute depression, decides to make a list about all the
  things that make life worth living. Waffles. Hedgehogs. Falling in love.
  Before the show begins, scribbled notes with items from the list are
  distributed throughout the audience. At regular intervals, the audience is
  required to shout out the items from the list. A few spectators are also
  pulled into various mime sequences and running gags and, with Henry, they
  carefully bring this boy’s story to life as he transitions from a hopeful
  young boy to faltering and thoughtful man. In the very best productions of
  Macmillan’s play, the moments of audience interaction can feel really special.
  But on press night, everything feels slightly on edge. Perhaps the shiny new
  theatre and star performer are a little imposing. Every now and then, Henry
  can’t resist sparring with the crowd. It’s all good fun but every ad lib takes
  us one step closer to a standup show – and one step further from the warm
  heart of this play. It’s only when Henry isn’t trying to be funny that the
  show settles. There’s a stillness and steeliness to him when he talks about
  the importance of protecting our mental health. Henry also responds
  beautifully to all the music woven into the show, which plays such an
  important role and underlines just how much this boy has been forced to live
  on the edges of his family life. Listening behind doors. Hovering. Worrying.
  Never getting truly involved, for fear of what he may lose if he lets the
  happiness in. • At @sohoplace theatre, London, until 8 November
