  The government is pushing head with a plan to offer those who live near new
  electricity pylons a discount of £2,500 from their energy bills over the next
  10 years to ease the backlash against its clean power plans. Thousands of
  households within half a kilometre of new or upgraded electricity
  infrastructure could each receive up to £250 off their annual energy bill from
  next year to help speed up the rollout of infrastructure critical to the
  government’s targets. Under the plan, local people could receive a £125
  discount every six months as the UK prepares to build twice as much new power
  grid infrastructure over the next five years as it has built in the past
  decade. New overhead power lines, pylons and substations are viewed as
  critical to Labour’s election promise to double Britain’s onshore wind, triple
  its solar farms and quadruple its offshore wind capacity by the end of the
  decade. The rise in electricity investment is expected to help the government
  meet its goal of creating a zero carbon electricity system by 2030, or five
  years earlier than the previous Tory government’s clean power target. The
  plans have provoked outrage from communities in areas of the country that are
  expected to host the new infrastructure, which will include overhead lines and
  pylons along the east coast of England to carry power generated from offshore
  windfarms in the North Sea. The opposition has been seized upon by Reform UK,
  which has promised to use “all our local powers” to prevent the construction
  of a new overhead electricity line in Lincolnshire. The government said the
  payouts would help to put communities “at the heart of a cleaner, more
  affordable, homegrown energy system”. The minister for energy consumers Miatta
  Fahnbulleh said: “That is why we are teaming up with communities hosting new
  pylons to ensure they receive direct, tangible benefits. We are on the side of
  those who want Britain to get back to what it does best: building for the
  future, driving innovation and putting communities first.” The government set
  out its plan to address the resistance to its infrastructure agenda alongside
  new rules to ease another source of opposition to its clean power plans: smart
  meter installations. The regulations, which will come into effect from next
  year, will help protect households from bungled installations and faulty
  devices by imposing extra obligations for energy suppliers and improving
  compensation for long installation and repair wait times. The £20bn roll out
  of smart meters has been dogged by delay due to scepticism over their
  benefits, and the perception that they are likely to be time-consuming to
  install and give false readings once in use. About three-quarters of homes
  have a smart meter despite the original aim for all households to have one by
  2019. The target was watered down to suggest that all homes should be offered
  a smart meter by 2020, but this was later pushed back to the end of 2025.
  Charlotte Friel, a director at Ofgem, said the new rules would set “clear
  expectations of suppliers, incentivising them to boost smart meter standards
  and protecting consumers from poor service if things go wrong”. She added:
  “This is only the beginning – with automatic compensation, faster fixes and
  improved installation standards well on the way, getting a smart meter will be
  quicker and easier than ever.” Martin Lewis, the founder of
  MoneySavingExpert.com, said: “Far too many smart meters, likely one in five,
  don’t work as they should – a problem not just for all the homes with broken
  ones, but for the smart meter rollout. With so many dissatisfied customers,
  word of mouth is bad, so people tell their friends and neighbours not to get
  one. “We need to shift firms’ focus from just installing smart meters to
  promptly fixing those that are broken – not just meters that go into dumb
  mode, but crucially all elements, including in-home displays that stop
  working. That’s the aim of this plan, and while it’s taking a softer approach
  than we proposed, it is an improvement and we’ll be monitoring to see if it
  delivers.”
