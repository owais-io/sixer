  Sitting somewhere between fiction and memoir, Moreno Giovannoni’s second novel
  is a tenderly written portrait of life for one Italian family living and
  working in Australia. Arriving in Melbourne in 1957, Ugo – the author’s father
  – is determined to make the most of the plentiful work opportunities in “the
  colony” (Giovannoni refers to Australia as “the colony” throughout the book).
  His young wife Morena is left behind in Italy, along with their infant son
  Moreno. A year after Ugo leaves, Morena and her son also set sail, despite the
  plan being for Ugo to go alone and to return with the profits of his labour.
  It’s a move Morena will always regret. This book is both an ode to Ugo and
  Morena and a kind of history of immigrant labour in postwar Australia.
  Giovannoni writes most vividly about his father. Ugo is well spoken – by
  small-town Italian standards – an excellent dancer and snappy dresser. These
  traits help him win the approval of Morena’s parents. Early in the novel we
  hear Ugo and Morena’s voices directly, via interview transcriptions. I adored
  these interludes, they captured so much of the personality of these two
  characters. They talk about their childhoods, their families and villages,
  their courtship in Italy, and how they lived and worked once they arrived in
  Australia. You cannot imagine two people working harder. These voices carry
  the unique texture of their suffering and struggle. Life for Italian
  immigrants in Australia in the years immediately after the second world war is
  full of work opportunities (relative to back home, particularly), and Ugo and
  Morena focus on the art of growing tobacco. Soon after arriving they relocate
  four hours north of Melbourne. They work for others, then set out on their
  own. Countless pages of this book are filled with the processes of producing
  tobacco – propagation, irrigation, harvest – and while this might sound
  boring, I found it fascinating. This isn’t just farming, it’s life, and
  Giovannoni writes with proud, respectful insight about his parents, their
  fellow immigrants and their work. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown
  of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning At
  the same time, The Immigrants is shot through with the sometimes subtle,
  sometimes shocking acts of violence and racism that characterised that time.
  Giovannoni chronicles the dangers of growing tobacco and living in rural
  isolation – from farming accidents to snake bites. These hazards may be par
  for the course in primary industries, but discrimination – experienced in
  hospitals, in police stations or in the wider community – is always lurking
  within these hardships, making them that much harder to bear. We also read of
  racially motivated hate crimes. Violence is embedded in these chapters of
  Australian history. It is marked on the bodies and minds of these immigrants.
  Giovannoni’s focus isn’t just his parents (and his own experiences in
  childhood and adolescence), he also writes about the community of immigrants
  in which the family is embedded. In many ways this network is all that
  sustains Ugo and Morena. Reading about a brimming social life, much of which
  radiates from the local cafe and picture theatre, one feels one is witnessing
  a kind of lost golden age. For the Giovannoni family, this isn’t just a matter
  of mixing with similar kinds of people, it’s about culture, survival and
  education. Giovannoni relates the massive impact that watching Italian films
  has on his sense of self: “To sit in a picture theatre in a small English
  colonial town at his age [10] with his mother and father and little brother
  and hundreds of Italians watching an Italian film, and understand the film and
  the audience, teaches him that he belongs to a different category of people.”
  He belongs, despite his difference from other parts of Australian society;
  despite the fact his extended family live so far away. The desire to return to
  the homeland is something the young Moreno doesn’t consciously feel, but he
  and his parents do make several returns to Italy. “He realises much later that
  his mother and father have been talking about it since the day they arrived.
  In the Tuscan language, rimpatrio, one of those words that is a false friend,
  means to return home.” One of the joys of this novel is the way Giovannoni
  quotes his parents speaking in their native tongue, the language the great
  Italian poet Dante spoke. The Immigrants is an understatedly beautiful book,
  about a critically important part of Australia’s history and social fabric.
  The labour and suffering of Moreno’s family and others like them is fittingly
  remembered, and celebrated, in these pages. The Immigrants by Moreno
  Giovannoni is out through Black Inc ($36.99)
