  Manchester United are increasingly confident of signing Benjamin Sesko from RB
  Leipzig on a deal that could rise to £74.1m after the striker indicated his
  preference to join the club Newcastle are interested in the Slovenia
  international, but Sesko favours a move to Old Trafford, where he is due to
  sign a five-year deal, even though Newcastle offer Champions League football.
  United have offered £65.4m upfront and the remainder in add-ons. After
  completing deals for Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Diego León, Ruben Amorim
  has focused on securing a No 9 after United scored 44 goals in 38 Premier
  League games last season. They missed out on Liam Delap, who joined Chelsea,
  and Hugo Ekitiké, after he moved to Liverpool from Eintracht Frankfurt. Ollie
  Watkins was another target, but United were put off by Aston Villa’s £60m
  valuation. Sesko scored 13 times in 33 Bundesliga appearances last season and
  got a further four goals in the Champions League. His arrival would take
  United’s summer spend to about £214m and leave them to concentrate on sales.
  Marcus Rashford has departed on loan for Barcelona, who will pay all of the
  forward’s wages, but no deals have been sealed for Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon
  Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia. None of the four have been part of Amorim’s
  pre-season plans and were allowed extra time away from the club to seek an
  exit. Sesko’s arrival would create further uncertainty about Rasmus Højlund’s
  future. The Dane has struggled leading the line since joining for £72m from
  Atalanta and has been made available, but United would also consider loaning
  him if a club are willing to cover his wages and pay a fee.
