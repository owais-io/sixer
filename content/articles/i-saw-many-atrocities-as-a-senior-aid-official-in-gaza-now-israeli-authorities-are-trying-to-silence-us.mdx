  Gaza has been held under water for 22 months, allowed to gasp for air only
  when Israeli authorities have succumbed to political pressure from those with
  more leverage than international law itself. After months of relentless
  bombardment, forced displacement and deprivation, the impact of Israel’s
  collective punishment of Gaza’s people has never been more devastating. I have
  been part of coordinating humanitarian efforts in Gaza since October 2023.
  Whatever lifesaving aid has entered since then has been the exception, not the
  rule. More than a year after the international court of justice (ICJ) ordered
  Israel to “take all measures within its power” to prevent acts of genocide –
  and despite all our warnings – we are still witnessing starvation,
  insufficient access to water, a sanitation crisis and a crumbling health
  system against a backdrop of ongoing violence that is resulting in scores of
  Palestinians being killed daily, including children. Powerless to change this,
  we humanitarians have resorted to using our voices – alongside those of
  Palestinian journalists who risk everything – to describe the appalling,
  inhuman conditions in Gaza. Speaking out, as I’m doing now, in the face of
  deliberate, preventable suffering is part of our role to promote respect for
  international law. But doing so comes at a price. After I held a press
  briefing in Gaza on 22 June in which I described how starving civilians were
  being shot while trying to reach food – what I called “conditions created to
  kill” – the Israeli minister of foreign affairs announced in a post on X that
  my visa would not been renewed. The Israeli permanent representative to the UN
  followed up at the security council announcing that I would be expected to
  leave by 29 July. This silencing is part of a broader pattern. International
  NGOs face increasingly restrictive registration requirements, including
  clauses that prohibit certain criticism of Israel. Palestinian NGOs that,
  against the odds, continue to save lives daily are cut off from the resources
  they need to operate. UN agencies are increasingly being issued only six,
  three or one-month visas based on whether they are considered “good, bad or
  ugly”. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in
  the Near East (Unwra) has been targeted through legislation, its international
  staff barred from entry and its operations slowly suffocated. These reprisals
  cannot erase the reality we’ve witnessed – day in, day out – not just in Gaza
  but in the West Bank too. What I have observed there looks different from what
  is unfolding in Gaza, but there is a unified purpose: severing territorial
  continuity and forcing Palestinians into ever-shrinking enclaves. Palestinians
  in the West Bank are daily being coerced and contained: coerced by settler
  violence and demolitions out of areas where settlements are expanding and
  contained by a network of movement restrictions into disconnected built-up
  areas where there are increasing military operations. Gaza is also being
  fragmented. Its 2.1 million people are now being crammed into just 12% of the
  land area of the Strip. I remember receiving the chilling call on 13 October
  2023 announcing the forced displacement of the entirety of northern Gaza.
  Since that brutal opening act, almost all of Gaza has been forcibly displaced
  – not once but repeatedly – without sufficient shelter, food or safety. I have
  seen first-hand what appears to be the systematic dismantling of the means to
  sustain Palestinian life. As part of our role to coordinate humanitarian
  operations, my colleagues and I have helped carry patients out of dark,
  cat-infested ICU wards in destroyed hospitals overtaken by Israeli forces
  where the dead were being buried in the courtyard by the last remaining
  sleep-deprived staff who had witnessed their colleagues being marched away. We
  helped uncover mass graves in other hospital courtyards where families
  searched through scattered clothes trying to identify loved ones who had been
  stripped before being killed or disappeared. We have argued with soldiers who
  were trying to forcibly remove a screaming spinal cord injury patient from an
  ambulance while being evacuated from a hospital. We have repatriated the
  bodies of humanitarian workers killed by drone strikes and tank fire while
  trying to deliver aid, and collected the bodies of family members of NGO
  workers who were killed in sites acknowledged by Israeli forces as
  “humanitarian” locations. We have seen medics in their uniforms killed and
  buried under ambulances crushed by Israeli forces. Overcrowded shelters for
  displaced people bombed, with parents clutching their injured or dead
  children. Countless bodies in the streets being eaten by dogs. People calling
  from beneath rubble, with help from first responders denied until no one was
  left breathing. Children wasting away from malnutrition while aid navigates an
  insurmountable obstacle course of obstructionism. Israeli authorities accuse
  us of being the problem. They say we are failing to collect goods from the
  crossings. We aren’t failing, we are being obstructed. Just last week I was on
  a convoy headed to Kerem Shalom crossing from inside Gaza. We escorted empty
  trucks through a densely crowded area, an unnecessarily complicated route
  provided by Israeli forces. When the trucks were lined up at a holding point
  and the green light to move to the crossing finally came from Israeli forces,
  thousands of desperate people moved with us, hoping the trucks would return
  with food. As we crawled forward, people clung to the vehicles until we saw
  the first dead body on the side of the road, shot in the back from the
  direction of Israeli forces. At the crossing, the gate was shut. We waited
  around two hours for a soldier to open it. That convoy took 15 hours to
  complete. With other convoys, Israeli forces have delayed returning trucks
  while crowds gather and killed desperate people who were waiting for the
  trucks to arrive. Some of our goods have been looted by armed gangs operating
  under the watch of Israeli forces. During the ceasefire, we ran multiple
  convoys a day. Now chaos, killing and obstruction are again the norm. Aid is
  vital, but it will never be a cure for engineered scarcity. The ICJ has been
  clear. In its binding provisional measures, it not only ordered Israel to
  prevent acts prohibited under the genocide convention, it also ordered Israel
  to enable urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance,
  including by increasing aid crossings. In a separate advisory opinion, the ICJ
  left no room for doubt: Israel’s ongoing occupation of Gaza and the West Bank,
  including East Jerusalem, is unlawful under international law. Gaza and the
  West Bank, including East Jerusalem, are different parts of the same picture.
  What is unfolding is not complicated. It is not inevitable. It is the result
  of deliberate political choices by those who create these conditions and those
  who enable them. The end of the occupation is long overdue. The credibility of
  the multilateral system is being weakened by double standards and impunity.
  International law cannot be a tool of convenience for some if it is to be a
  viable tool of protection for all. Gaza is already drowning beneath bombs,
  starvation and the relentless grip of the blockade on essentials for survival.
  Every delay in enforcing the most basic rules meant to protect human life is
  another hand pressing Gaza down as it struggles for breath. Do you have an
