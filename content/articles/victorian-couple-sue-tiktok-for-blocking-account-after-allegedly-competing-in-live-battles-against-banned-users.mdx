  A Victorian couple is suing TikTok after their account was banned from the
  social media platform, allegedly for competing in TikTok live battles against
  banned users. Selim Ozgan and Inci Guven, a married couple, have sued TikTok
  and its Singaporean subsidiary in the federal court of Australia, alleging
  that the ByteDance-owned company had unfair contract terms under Australian
  consumer law. According to court documents seen by Guardian Australia, the
  couple created the account @mrnmrsttt in 2022 for taking part in TikTok live
  battles, through which they earned money. Sign up: AU Breaking News email
  TikTok live battles pit two creators against each other in live streams where
  they compete to have their followers give them the most virtual gifts. The
  gifts are bought in the TikTok app using virtual coins available to users over
  18 years of age. Users can buy 20 virtual coins for A$0.49, or up to 17,500
  for A$419.99. In the five-minute battle, each side builds up scores by
  encouraging their followers to donate gifts to them, which are represented in
  brightly coloured animations as the gifts are donated. Regardless of who wins,
  both accounts get to keep a share of the revenue from gifts donated to them
  that can be cashed out. TikTok also takes a share. Details on how much
  creators make are not disclosed by TikTok. Tikleap tracks the creators making
  thousands of dollars a day through gifts donated on live streams, including
  battles. Several videos featuring the couple’s battles are still on TikTok,
  despite their account being banned. Those videos show that at the time of the
  battles the couple’s account had more than 150,000 likes. The couple said in
  their statement of claim that between 16 March 2024 and 9 April 2024, they
  received violation notifications. They were told by their account manager via
  Telegram they were not in breach of TikTok policies but the account had been
  flagged because it was used to battle a banned person who was using a new
  account. The account manager allegedly told the couple that battling or going
  live with banned users risked suspension or banning. The couple said in the
  submission they requested more information about the allegedly banned person
  to ensure they did not violate TikTok policies but did not receive any more
  information. Their account was permanently banned on 2 May 2024, the couple
  said. They said neither their account manager nor TikTok responded to requests
  for further information or appeals to reinstate their account. The couple
  alleged TikTok was in breach of its policies by failing to provide them with
  procedural fairness, and TikTok had “permanently removed” their livelihood.
  They alleged that TikTok’s policies, including the company being able to
  disable or remove people’s accounts without notice, were unfair terms under
  Australian consumer law. They are asking for their account to be restored and
  seeking damages with interest and costs. In a court order last week, the
  federal court gave TikTok until this Friday to apply for a summary judgment,
  with the matter to be referred to mediation in the first instance. TikTok
  declined to comment. The company has yet to file a defence and Guardian
  Australia was refused access by the court to a submission TikTok had made. The
  law firm acting for Ozgan and Guven was approached for comment.
