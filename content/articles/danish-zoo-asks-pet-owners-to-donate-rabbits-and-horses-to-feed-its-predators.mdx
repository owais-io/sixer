  A zoo in Denmark is appealing for donations of healthy small pets to be
  “gently euthanised” and fed to predators. Aalborg zoo has urged willing
  chicken, rabbit and guinea pig owners to hand over their pets to be eaten
  whole by animals including European lynx. Live donations, it said, would be
  killed by trained staff. It promised that “nothing goes to waste”, and also
  said it would “gratefully” receive live horses. The zoo said such animals were
  needed in order to “imitate the animals’ natural food chain – for the sake of
  both animal welfare and professional integrity”. “Chickens, rabbits and guinea
  pigs form an important part of the diet of our predators,” Aalborg zoo wrote
  in a social media post alongside a picture of an openmouthed lynx. “Especially
  the European lynx, which needs whole prey that resembles what it would
  naturally hunt in the wild.” It added: “If you have a healthy animal that
  needs to be put down for various reasons, you are welcome to donate it to us.
  The animals are gently euthanised by trained staff and then used as food. That
  way, nothing goes to waste – and we ensure natural behaviour, nutrition and
  wellbeing of our predators.” To find out more about the scheme, pet owners are
  encouraged to click on a web link – illustrated by a tiger tucking into a hunk
  of meat – that outlines the finer details of its pet euthanasia scheme. The
  zoo also said it would welcome horses, which would be slaughtered for food.
  “Our needs vary throughout the year and there may be a waiting list,” it
  added. Any horse donated to the zoo must have a horse passport and come with
  the opportunity for a tax deduction on the horse’s value, which is calculated
  on the basis of its weight. The social media post has attracted a wide array
  of reactions and comments. Some criticised the appeal, with one describing it
  as a “sick invention”. Others spoke out in support. “I took a horse to the zoo
  a few years ago,” said one. “It was the most peaceful and calm way it
  happened.” Pia Nielsen, deputy director of Aalborg zoo, said: “For many years
  at Aalborg Zoo, we have fed our carnivores with smaller livestock. When
  keeping carnivores, it is necessary to provide them with meat, preferably with
  fur, bones etc to give them as natural a diet as possible. “Therefore, it
  makes sense to allow animals that need to be euthanised for various reasons to
  be of use in this way. In Denmark, this practice is common, and many of our
  guests and partners appreciate the opportunity to contribute. The livestock we
  receive as donations are chickens, rabbits, guinea pigs, and horses.” Last
  week a zoo in Nuremberg, Germany, prompted outcry – including from a woman who
  glued her hands to the ground near the zoo entrance in protest - after culling
  12 healthy Guinea baboons due to overcrowding in their enclosure and
  reportedly feeding them to the lions in view of the public.
