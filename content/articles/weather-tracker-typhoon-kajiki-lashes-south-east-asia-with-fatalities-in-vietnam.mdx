  Vietnam

  Typhoon Kajiki steadily intensified over the South China Sea last weekend into
  a category 2 storm with sustained wind speeds of 115mph. It made landfall near
  the coastal city of Vinh in Vietnam on Monday afternoon having slightly
  weakened but still packing a punch with winds of up to 100mph and torrential
  rainfall. Kajiki’s wind threat soon faded after landfall, but the flood risk
  continued into Tuesday and Wednesday as the system moved inland. Parts of
  central and northern Vietnam, as well as Thailand, experienced 300-400mm of
  rainfall. Seven people were killed in Vietnam with flood water damaging more
  than 10,000 homes. The area is also home to thousands of hectares of rice
  plantations, some of which have also been affected by the extreme rainfall.
  Power outages and flooding have also reached the capital, Hanoi, where the
  outer bands of the storm continued to produce heavy rainfall into Tuesday and
  Wednesday. The duration of torrential rains from Typhoon Kajiki led to an
  elevated landslide risk across Laos and Thailand on Thursday. Landslides were
  reported in 12 Thai provinces, including the popular tourist destination of
  Chiang Mai, where four people were killed. Another person drowned in Mae Hong
  Son, bringing the death toll to five in Thailand so far, with a further 15
  injured and thousands still being affected. Further rains can be expected over
  Thailand, Laos and Vietnam over the weekend as another system, designated as
  tropical depression 20W by the Joint Typhoon Warning Centre, now over the
  South China Sea tracks westwards over the region. This will prolong the risk
  of landslides and could hamper rescue efforts. Monsoon floods across India and
  Pakistan continued this week, with 200,000 people evacuated across the Punjab
  province of Pakistan alone. Further extreme monsoon rains fell over the region
  this week, as well as across parts of India, raising fears that water released
  from dams in India would cause flooding downstream in Pakistan. At least 34
  people died in Kashmir, adding to the wider death toll of about 800 caused by
  the 2025 monsoon season, which has been the wettest across the region in 12
  years. Torrential rains are expected to continue across north-west India next
  week, before the monsoon season begins to wind down throughout September. The
  monsoon season across the south-west of the US is also in full swing, as
  thunderstorms affected Phoenix, Arizona early this week. A spectacular dust
  storm moved through the area as a result of these thunderstorms on Tuesday
  afternoon. Torrential rain from monsoon storms can help to produce strong wind
  gusts that push out ahead of the rain, picking up dust and sand from the
  previously dry landscape into large dust clouds. However, the heavy rainfall
  also caused disruption on Wednesday morning, flooding an underpass in
  downtown, leaving several cars stranded.
