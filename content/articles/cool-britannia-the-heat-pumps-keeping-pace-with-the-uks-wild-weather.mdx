  When David Tester, 56, installed a heat pump in his home in the winter of
  2022, freezing temperatures descended on the country alongside a series of
  named storms. It was a world away from this summer’s heatwaves, which have
  pushed Britain to the brink of drought. But Tester’s choice of heat pump
  design has meant that his three-bedroom 1930s semi in West Sussex has remained
  at a comfortable temperature despite Britain’s increasingly volatile weather.
  The air-to-air heat pump provides heating in the winter but acts like an air
  conditioner in the summer months. “The heat pump has worked very well in both
  seasons and because I run it on electricity from my solar panels, it basically
  provides cooling for free,” he said. Heat pumps remain rare in Britain, but
  the recent spells of hotter than average temperatures may have the unexpected
  consequence of boosting the government’s ambition to replace Britain’s
  boilers. The government recently set out plans to include air-to-air heat
  pumps, which can act as air conditioners, in the same grant scheme that offers
  £7,500 to households that replace their gas boiler with “wet system” heat
  pumps. So far, the government has prioritised promoting “hydronic” heat pumps,
  in large part because they make use of the existing central heating pipes and
  radiators, which most households currently use to warm their homes. They work
  like a fridge in reverse by using electricity to capture and amplify even
  small amounts of heat outside a home to raise the water temperature of the
  central heating system. The warmed water travels through pipes and radiators
  to heat a home in the same way as water heated by a gas boiler. But these are
  far from the most common choice in homes across Europe, according to Jan
  Rosenow, an academic and a programme director at the Regulatory Assistance
  Project (RAP), which regularly analyses heat pump systems. “In most homes
  across Europe air-to-air heat pumps are the most popular option. We see the
  same thing in China, and the same in the US. It may seem new for UK homes, but
  really it is the dominant technology,” he said. Cold comfort In Britain
  air-to-air heat pumps are already beginning to roll out across public
  buildings, offices and shopping centres. Andrew Sissons, a deputy director at
  Nesta, a charity that undertakes research into home heating innovation,
  believes that smaller homes and flats in particular could soon benefit from
  combined heating and cooling too. Air heat pumps use the same basic principles
  as hydronic system heat pumps, but instead of heating water that is pumped
  through the home, they heat the air. In the summer a refrigerant is used to
  provide cooling. “Demand for air-to-air heat pumps could be significant,”
  Sissons said. “They provide cooling – which is more in demand as our summers
  get hotter – and the cost of units is far lower too. They are also relatively
  simple to install because they are usually wall mounted so they don’t require
  as much outdoor space.” The catch? They don’t usually provide hot water,
  meaning a separate low-carbon solution would be needed to replace a
  traditional gas boiler system entirely. In West Sussex, Tester has kept his
  gas boiler to heat the water used in his underfloor heating system on the
  first floor – but uses it sparingly for a few hours in the morning and evening
  during the winter months, while the air-to-air heat pump tackles the majority
  of the heating requirements. In summer, the pump runs on solar power to
  provide cooling. Guilt-free cooling? The promise of cooler home temperatures
  through Britain’s increasingly warm summers does not sit easily with many.
  Home air conditioning is rare in Britain, unlike in southern Europe, and there
  are growing concerns over the impact of cooling on the UK’s energy demand and
  carbon targets as the climate crisis intensifies. The International Energy
  Agency has warned that growing demand for cooling could put a strain on
  electricity grids and climate goals. Cooling accounts for about 10% of global
  electricity demand today, but it is set to double by 2050 as the climate gets
  hotter. The global energy watchdog noted that in 2023 one power plant in China
  burned about 800 tonnes of coal in just one hour to help keep Shanghai
  residents cool during a summer heatwave. But British households should have no
  reservations about installing an air-to-air heat pump to use for cooling
  purposes too, according to Sissons. There are two main reasons for this:
  first, the number of days when cooling would be required are far lower than
  the number of days when the heat pump will make significant carbon savings by
  providing warmth in place of a gas boiler. These carbon savings would easily
  outweigh the extra carbon demand from cooling a home in summer, he said, not
  least because the UK’s electricity grid is increasingly green. Second, there
  is a strong correlation between the days when cooling will be in high demand,
  and the days when the UK is generating large amounts of solar power, Sissons
  said. Winter evenings are still likely to be the most taxing for the UK
  electricity system, even if there is a significant uptake in summer air
  conditioning in the years ahead. These calculations already form part of the
  extensive forecasts produced by the National Energy System Operator to
  determine how much energy Britain will need in the future – and how it can
  meet this requirement. The system operator’s modelling accounts for a huge
  increase in electricity use by the end of the decade, including demand from
  electric vehicles, heat pumps and data centres. It also forecasts more
  energy-efficient buildings and appliances combined with batteries which can
  provide extra electricity at times of peak demand. The modelling shows that a
  virtually zero carbon electricity grid could power Britain by the end of the
  decade – even with growing demand – and be used by the industry and government
  policymakers to help the UK achieve its clean power goals. Even so, homes can
  take steps to dull the effect of a surge in demand for cooling. The Energy
  Saving Trust recommends using passive cooling methods before fitting either an
  air conditioning unit or a heat pump with a cooling function to dampen the
  impact of higher energy demand. These include using window shades and
  improving ventilation to minimise the amount of energy used to cool a home.
