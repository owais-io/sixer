  Rico Lewis has said he has no intention of leaving Manchester City this summer
  and believes missing out on the Premier League title last season has “fuelled
  the fire” in Pep Guardiola’s squad. Lewis is the subject of interest from
  Nottingham Forest but the 20‑year‑old England defender, who joined City at the
  age of eight, indicated that he would prefer to stay at the Etihad Stadium.
  “For me, I’ve never ever seen myself leaving,” Lewis said after helping City
  to secure a 4-0 win at Wolves on Saturday. “I’ve always wanted to play for
  City. It’s my dream. When I’m playing with the kind of players that I’m
  playing with, it brings out the best of me. So I’m so happy.” Lewis made 44
  appearances in all competitions last season but fell behind Matheus Nunes –
  typically a midfielder – in the pecking order at right‑back. Lewis has since
  spoken to Guardiola about his future. “Everyone wants that assurance and
  security, but at the end of day it’s on me,” Lewis said. “It’s on me to
  perform.Last season I played more than the season before. So it’s always the
  same goal – to become an established player.” Guardiola signalled to Lewis
  that he remains a key part of his plans by preferring him to Nunes in the win
  at Molineux, in which Erling Haaland scored twice and Tijjani Reijnders and
  Rayan Cherki scored on their league debuts. Discussing the pain of last season
  and City’s ambition to win a fifth title in six years, Lewis said: “As much as
  we want to forget about last season, obviously it’s in the back of our minds
  and maybe we could say it’s fuelled the fire in us, but we’re so focused on
  this season. We feel so much stronger together as a team. There’s always
  hunger but I think there could be additional hunger now that it’s not our
  crown to defend.” Forest targeted Lewis as part of a double swoop of City
  academy talents with plans to sign the versatile defender and James McAtee but
  have only sealed a deal for the latter, for £30m. “I feel ready for a new
  challenge and the club had a great season last year, so I want to help build
  on that and show what I can do,” McAtee said after being unveiled. Forest are
  on a recruitment drive after their head coach, Nuno Espírito Santo, suggested
  that he was short of options before hosting Brentford on Sunday. They are
  closing on a deal for the Rennes striker Arnaud Kalimuendo and are interested
  in the former Aston Villa midfielder Douglas Luiz, who is keen on a return to
  the Premier League from Juventus. McAtee, who has signed a five‑year contract,
  followed his fellow England Under-21 Omari Hutchinson to Forest last week,
  after the winger signed from Ipswich in a £37m deal.
