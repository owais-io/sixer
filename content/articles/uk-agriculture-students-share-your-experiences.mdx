  Agricultural colleges across the UK have seen a significant increase in
  applications for land management courses, according to the Times. Applications
  for the Royal Agricultural University’s three-year rural land management BSc
  course, for example, have risen 11 per cent compared to 2024. The rise is part
  of a wider increase in applications to study farming-related courses at UK
  universities in recent years. We would like to hear from agriculture students
  about their reasons for enrolling. What influenced your decision? Are you the
  first in your family to work in the industry? Or have members of your family
  worked in agriculture? If you’re having trouble using the form click here.
