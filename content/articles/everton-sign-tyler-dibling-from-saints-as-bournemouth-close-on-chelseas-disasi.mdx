  Everton have confirmed the signing of Tyler Dibling from Southampton in a deal
  worth up to £42m. It is thought the Merseyside club will pay an initial £35m
  for the forward, who has signed a four-year contract, and Saints have inserted
  a 20% sell-on fee. Dibling impressed in the Premier League last season despite
  Southampton enduring a dismal campaign that ended in relegation. The England
  Under-21 winger joined Chelsea in the summer of 2022 but returned to
  Southampton a month later after struggling to settle. “I think I’ve come to
  Everton at the perfect time and hopefully I can be here for many years,”
  Dibling said. The 19-year-old forward considers Jack Grealish, another of
  David Moyes’s eight summer recruits, one of his inspirations. “I think the
  manager is perfect for me,” Dibling said. “He’s helped so many players before
  who were in my position. I’ve spoken to him and I know he’s going to be good
  for me. There are so many players here to learn from, real quality players
  like Jack Grealish and Iliman Ndiaye.” Dibling was tracked by several
  clubsincluding RB Leipzig, Tottenham and Aston Villa, after his breakthrough
  at Southampton, for whom he made his debut aged 17. He represented Saints’
  under-21s at the age of 15 and sparked widespread attention after scoring a
  near-identical hat-trick against Newcastle at St James’ Park. Bournemouth are
  close to signing Axel Disasi from Chelsea. The 27-year-old is expected to join
  on loan and become the third defender brought in after the club made almost
  £145m from the sale of two centre-halves and a left-back. Disasi’s starts at
  Chelsea last season came largely in the Conference League and League Cup
  before he joined Aston Villa on loan in the winter window. He is able to play
  at centre-back or right-back and has made 44 Premier League appearances since
  joining Chelsea from Monaco two years ago. Bournemouth have sold Illia
  Zabarnyi, Dean Huijsen and Milos Kerkez to Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid
  and Liverpool respectively this summer, and brought in Bafodé Diakité and
  Adrien Truffert as replacements. Chelsea have also agreed for Carney
  Chukwuemeka and Aarón Anselmino to join Borussia Dortmund as they continue
  their push to clear out fringe players. Chukwuemeka went on loan to Dortmund
  last February and the midfielder’s return is due to be on a permanent deal.
  Anselmino, a 20-year-old Argentinian defender, is poised to move on loan.
  Leeds have signed the Leicester full-back James Justin in a deal worth about
  £10m. Justin, who has been capped once by England, joined Leicester from Luton
  in 2019.
