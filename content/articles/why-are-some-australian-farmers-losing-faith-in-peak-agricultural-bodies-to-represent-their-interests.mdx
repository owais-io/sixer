  represent their interests?

  Last September, a leaked email revealed the National Farmers’ Federation had
  directed members to stay silent about the putative health risks from paraquat,
  a widely used herbicide. Some farmers rebelled. Among them was Mirboo North
  grower and grazier Emma Germano, who was then the president of the Victorian
  Farmers Federation. Germano broke ranks with the NFF to support the farmers
  who’d been vilified for speaking out about clusters of Parkinson’s disease,
  which they believed to be linked to paraquat use on farms. (Manufacturer
  Syngenta, which has partnerships with NFF, denies any link.) “These people are
  suffering,” Germano told the ABC’s AM program. “They’re asking a question. For
  that to be shut down, when these are people who have been diligently part of
  our industry, salt-of-the-earth farmers – that, to me, is inexcusable.”
  Germano’s stance revealed a growing discontent with peak bodies in Australia’s
  fragmented agriculture sector. Some farmers believe peak bodies advocate for
  agribusiness interests over those of grassroots farmers. In niche and nascent
  sectors especially, farmers say they don’t feel represented by Australia’s 50
  farming organisations, which range from regulators and statutory bodies to
  commodity groups, industry associations and farmers federations. The latter
  have faced declining memberships for decades. Andrew Meseha, whose companies
  grow hemp in Deniliquin, Shepparton and South Gippsland, says farm bodies
  cannot advocate for farmers while sponsored by corporations and aligned with
  specific political parties. “The chemical companies are in every pocket,” he
  says. Meseha believes consequent farmer discontent accounts for the rising
  influence of independent rural MPs and the advent of non-partisan, issue-based
  collectives such as Lock the Gate and Farmers for Climate Action (FCA). Sign

  Founded in 2010, Lock the Gate says it has 120,000 supporters, and decade-old
  FCA claims it has 45,000 supporters and more than 8,400 members. By
  comparison, state federations and associations – some more than a century old
  with huge legacy capital – report membership bases from about 3,500 in Western
  Australia and about 19,000 in New South Wales. The NFF accepts only
  organisational members – a structure Germano says privileges “special
  interests, factions and commodity groups”, and generates “a huge amount of
  overlap” with state federations. “It’s a pyramid scheme without the
  Tupperware,” she says. The NFF president, David Jochinke, who was previously
  the president of the VFF, says the structure of agricultural organisations has
  been “a topic of discussion for decades” and should continue to be so “to make
  sure we have the best system to ensure agriculture and farmers are heard”. “We
  recognise that the agricultural landscape is changing, and with it the
  expectations of how peak bodies engage, advocate and represent grassroots
  voices,” he says. This week, the NFF chief executive, Troy Williams, resigned
  after three months in the job, citing “personal reasons”. Consumed with
  infighting, the VFF lost about 400 members in the year before the paraquat
  showdown – partly attributable to corporatisation and mergers of farms. Farm
  sizes have swelled, meaning fewer individual farmers to represent, with the
  number of Australian broadacre and dairy farms declining by a third in the
  last 25 years. Increasing automation has also reduced the sector’s workforce –
  a dragnet of occupations that includes pickers and processors, as well as
  fishing and forestry labourers – to only 2.1% of Australia’s working
  population, represented largely by unions, not peak farm bodies. Farmers – a
  famously individualistic sector – don’t tend to collectively organise in union
  style. But first-generation farmers are increasingly looking to “collective
  action solutions that peak bodies could embrace”, says horticulturist and
  “agvocate” Lisa Brassington. These bodies could “depoliticise the messages and
  reach out to the commons”, she says. Politicking by farm bodies can stoke
  populist myths about urban-rural divides, with the “latte line” and “quinoa
  belt” rhetoric sometimes deployed, but Brassington says fire and flood relief
  donors are largely “from urban and township postcodes”, showing broad
  solidarity and goodwill. “Natural and financial crises create a loss of
  autonomy” for farmers and peak bodies “have a time-sensitive role” to support
  “collective interests”, she says. Claiming to amplify the voices of farmers,
  aspiring social media influencers such as FOALS (Future of Agricultural
  Leadership) are emerging. Agricultural influencers are also a growth industry.
  But many influencers reiterate divisive messaging and can’t effectively
  advocate because they don’t have the established bodies’ governance structures
  and transparency obligations, says Brassington. Furthermore, issues for
  farmers remain mostly “similar to previous generations – drought, flood,
  roads, labour, supply chains, and profit margins”, alongside “succession
  planning, affording technology and water rights” and mental health. Much
  advocacy for the latter is carried by charities such as Farm Angels and Rural
  Doctors Foundation, and university research outfits such as AgHealth. Germano
  believes farm bodies need to modernise and reform their profligate cultures if
  they want to retain grassroots members. “Peak state organisations mirror
  National party branches from long ago, when they served men from the landed
  gentry,” she says. A third of Australia’s farmers are now women, yet women
  “can’t step outside the status quo” inside federations, she says. “They’re
  still old boys’ clubs.” Jochinke says the NFF’s national advocacy model is
  “proudly member-driven and we are actively working with our member
  organisations to shape a modernised, effective approach”. Germano led the
  VFF’s split from the NFF in September, after the NFF didn’t consult with
  Victorian sheep farmers before staging a Coalition-partnered Canberra rally
  against the phase-out of live exports. She believes such tactics are
  undemocratic and outdated – promoting myths that farmers are indifferent to
  animal welfare and “that the big war is against animal activists”. “The live
  sheep ban was advocated most strongly by meatworkers unions who wanted meat
  locally processed,” she says. Negotiating with diverse interest groups
  achieves better policy outcomes for farmers and the broader community. To
  advocate effectively, farm bodies need “better governance, independence and
  listening – discipline, culture, restructure”, says Germano. “They need to
  ask: do we stand for farmers or do we stand for agribusiness? These are
  different things and are often at cross purposes.” Jochinke says the NFF
  “reject the notion that peak bodies prioritise agribusiness over grassroots
  concerns”. “Our recent work, such as opposing the biosecurity levy, securing
  bipartisan support for a national food security plan, and advocating for fair
  environmental and tax policies, demonstrates our commitment to representing
  the interests of everyday farmers.” Katherine Wilson is a writer and freelance
