  Strictly Come Dancing has announced that this year’s competition will feature
  its first contestant with Down’s syndrome, the model and actor Ellie
  Goldstein. Goldstein was the first model with Down’s syndrome to appear on the
  cover of British Vogue. She has also partnered with Mattel to launch the first
  Barbie with the condition. “I’m absolutely over the moon to be joining the
  cast and pros of Strictly Come Dancing this year,” said Goldstein. “It’s a
  show I’ve loved watching for so long and the chance to now be part of it feels
  like a dream. I know it’s going to be challenging, but I’m ready to do it with
  the glitter and glamour and make some magic on that dancefloor. Let the
  Strictly journey begin!” Goldstein is the latest in a series of Strictly
  contestants seemingly intended to widen access to dance since the Paralympian
  Jonnie Peacock took part in 2017. In 2021, Rose Ayling-Ellis, who was the
  show’s first deaf contestant, won the competition. In 2022, Ellie Simmonds
  became the contest’s first participant with dwarfism and last year’s series
  was won by Chris McCausland, the show’s first blind dancer. Goldstein is the
  ninth contestant to be announced for this year’s competition. Other confirmed
  participants include the former footballer Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, the Love
  Island star (and daughter of Danny Dyer) Dani Dyer and the former England
  rugby captain Chris Robshaw. They are joined by the EastEnders actor Balvinder
  Sopal, the social media personality George Clarke, the Drag Race UK finalist
  La Voix, Harry Aikines-Aryeetey – AKA Nitro from Gladiators – and the actor
  Alex Kingston. This year’s contest takes place after the BBC’s investigation
  into alleged cocaine use by two Strictly stars, who were accused by the Sun on
  Sunday of a drug habit that was “talked widely about among the cast”. In June,
  the EastEnders star Jamie Borthwick was suspended by the BBC after a video
  emerged of him using an ableist slur during Strictly rehearsals in November.
  Borthwick apologised and a BBC spokesperson said: “This language is entirely
  unacceptable and in no way reflects the values or standards we hold and expect
  at the BBC. We have robust processes in place for this.”
