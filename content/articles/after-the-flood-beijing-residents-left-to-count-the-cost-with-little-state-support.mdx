  Wang Rongying was lying in bed at 6pm on Monday evening when her phone started
  pinging with messages. Neighbours said that the heavy rainfall Wang could hear
  outside was starting to cause the water levels on the street to rise to
  worrying levels. When she opened her front door to see for herself the flood
  water came rushing in. “I was so scared … never since the 1980s have I seen
  such heavy flooding. We didn’t receive any warning in advance,” Wang said,
  surveying the soaked remains of her two-storey home in Miyun, a district on
  the outskirts of Beijing that was hit by heavy floods on Monday evening. By
  midnight, 28 Miyun residents were reported to have died. “I feel grateful to
  be alive,” said 71-year-old Wang on Tuesday afternoon, still wearing her muddy
  clothes from the night before. Like many of her elderly neighbours, Wang found
  refuge on her rooftop, where she waited for several hours to be rescued by
  emergency services. She waved a red piece of clothing to help rescue workers
  spot her more easily. At about 11pm, she was found and taken to an overnight
  relief centre where she was given sweets to help her manage her diabetes.
  Warnings unheeded The floods that hit Beijing this week saw a year’s worth of
  rainfall in less than seven days, and stretched the emergency services to
  their limits. In total, 30 people are reported to have died in Miyun and
  Yanqing, another mountainous district on the edge of the capital, and more
  than 80,000 people have been relocated. Eight people in neighbouring Hebei
  province were killed in a landslide caused by the rainfall. More than 130
  villages lost power. Many Beijing residents received text messages from the
  local authorities warning them about the risks of landslides and flash floods.
  But the advice to “pay attention to safety” didn’t offer much by way of
  specifics, and several people interviewed by the Guardian in Miyun said they
  either didn’t receive, or didn’t notice, the warnings. “There was only a
  general notification, it wasn’t very helpful,” said a 37-year-old sanitation
  worker, who declined to give his name, as he trawled for any valuables that
  might have been washed up in Miyun’s Century Sports Park. The park’s lawn had
  been transformed into a muddy swamp by the floods. He was working in central
  Beijing when he heard about the floods on Monday. “My heart flew back to my
  family,” he said, “I couldn’t continue with my work”. By the time he got home,
  the waters had receded, but all his belongings had been soaked, he said. He
  estimated that his financial losses could amount to 20,000 yuan (£2,100), the
  equivalent of several months’ salary. Wang, like many of her neighbours, is
  retired and lives on a modest income. Her pension is 3,000 yuan per month. She
  estimated the damage done to her house and belongings, which are uninsured,
  will cost about 100,000 yuan. “We just need to find a way to manage,” she
  said, offering chunks of watermelon to anyone she spoke to. Miraculously, her
  two pet parakeets, chirping in their cage, and her large poster of Mao Zedong,
  survived the disaster. Thanks to the climate crisis, extreme weather events
  are becoming more common in China. Earlier this month China’s emergency
  ministry said that 25 million people had been affected by natural disasters in
  the first half of the year. Last month, several people died in heavy flooding
  in the poor, south-west province of Guizhou. In 2023, a separate district of
  Beijing, on the western edge of the city, was hit by the heaviest rainfall on
  record, which killed at least 20 people. Fending for themselves China’s
  emergency response efforts are, thanks to grim experience, becoming
  increasingly well-honed, but the social safety net for people who survive the
  disasters is minimal. Wang’s neighbour, a 69-year-old retired farmer who gave
  his surname as Duan, was rescued along with his wife on Monday evening by a
  large forklift truck deployed to collect people from their rooftops. He said
  that everything in his house had been destroyed, including a new air
  conditioning unit that he recently bought for 6,000 yuan. “It was a big spend
  for us,” he said. His combined monthly income with his wife is about 4,000
  yuan. Like Wang, Duan does not have insurance for his belongings and doesn’t
  expect to receive any compensation or support from the government for his
  losses. Despite the scientific consensus that links rising global temperatures
  with natural disasters, the two are rarely linked in Chinese official media.
  Ordinary people, especially in less developed areas such as Miyun, often pay
  little attention to concepts such as climate change. Standing on a corner of
  his flooded neighbourhood, its striking mountains visible on the horizon, Duan
  said he had no way to reach his home as the roads had become inaccessible. He
  estimated the waters would take several days to subside. “I don’t think it’s
  related to global warming,” he said. “It feels more like a once in century
  event.” Residents in the worst-hit areas of Miyun were rescued and taken to
  local schools and government buildings that had been swiftly converted into
  relief centres. But some people were left to fend for themselves. Li Qingfa,
  75, runs a small guesthouse in the same neighbourhood. He said that although
  he would have liked to have been relocated, his guesthouse was used as a
  temporary emergency relief centre. When the flood waters started rushing in,
  Li and his wife grabbed bedding, bags of wheat and sacks of rice to use as
  makeshift sandbags, spoiling more than 100kg of grain. “The financial losses
  are great, but there is nothing we can do about it,” he said, as he attempted
  to wipe clean the muddy waters swirling over the guest room floors. Additional
