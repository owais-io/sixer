  Ed Templeton had woken up in Zurich, Switzerland, that morning, but by the
  early afternoon he’d arrived by train in Germany. He was visiting the city of
  Munich, and after dropping his bags at a central hotel, he walked to the
  city’s Englischer Garten. “It’s one of the biggest parks in Europe,” he says,
  and home to the Eisbach river’s famous artificial wave. “The surfers follow
  unwritten rules based on respect that are fascinating to watch. They line up
  on either side of the river and take turns. When one surfer falls off the wave
  and is swept away in the current, another jumps on, and everyone cheers each
  other on. It’s methodical and quite mesmerising. It takes great skill to jump
  from the wall into the wave, and manoeuvre back and forth in such a narrow
  space.” He took this image from a bridge, because “while the banks on either
  side of the river create a perfect amphitheatre to watch, it gets so packed,
  it’s tough to find an open spot”. Despite this, Templeton adds that “the
  spectators are very quiet, mostly watching in awe, so it’s quite peaceful and
  relaxing to find a perch in the shady forest”. Templeton took the shot on his
  phone and says, “I have no rules for iPhone shots. Cropping, jacking up the
  colours – it’s all fair game!” He awoke next day keen to return to the park
  for a swim, but the sun had been replaced with pouring rain. “We never got a
  chance to get in the water,” Templeton says. “I felt as if I missed out on a
  great experience, so I hope I’ll get to return one day.”
