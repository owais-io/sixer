  Hamas has reaffirmed that it will not disarm unless an independent Palestinian
  state is established, as the group released its second video in two days of an
  Israeli hostage. Responding to one of the key Israeli demands to end the war
  in Gaza, Hamas – which has dominated the territory since 2007 – said it could
  not yield its right to “armed resistance” unless an “independent, fully
  sovereign Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital” is established.
  Indirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel aimed at securing a 60-day
  ceasefire in the Gaza war and deal for the release of hostages ended last week
  in deadlock. On Saturday, Hamas released a second video of hostage Evyatar
  David. In it, David is skeletally thin and is shown digging a hole, which, he
  says in the video, is for his own grave. Israeli restrictions on the entry of
  goods and aid into Gaza have led to severe shortages of food and other
  essentials, stoking international demands for a ceasefire. UN-backed food
  security experts said this week that the “worst-case scenario of famine” is
  now playing out in Gaza. Hamas has included this issue in their hostage
  videos, warning that the hostages are going hungry alongside their captors and
  that time is running out for a ceasefire. In a statement, the family of David
  demanded that the aid that is now getting into Gaza thanks to renewed UN
  convoys and foreign airdrops must also reach their son. “They are on the
  absolute brink of death,” his brother Ilay said at a rally in support of the
  hostages in Tel Aviv, where thousands gathered holding posters of those in
  captivity and chanted for their immediate release. Of the 251 hostages taken
  during the Hamas attack, 49 are still being held in Gaza, including 27 the
  Israeli military says are dead. Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy on Saturday
  told families of hostages that he was working with the Israeli government on a
  plan that would effectively end the war in Gaza. Steve Witkoff, who arrived in
  Israel as Benjamin Netanyahu’s government faced global outcry over the
  devastation in Gaza and the starvation growing among its 2.2 million people,
  met the prime minister on Thursday. On Friday he visited an aid distribution
  site run by the Israel and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).
  Global outrage has grown over Israel’s restrictions on aid and the deadly
  unrest surrounding the GHF sites, with daily reports of shootings at all four
  locations since the group took over aid distribution at the end of May. The UN
  says 859 Palestinians have been killed during that time in the vicinity of
  these sites, and more than 500 have been killed along the routes of food
  convoys. Hospitals in Gaza say Israeli fire killed more than a dozen people on
  Saturday, eight of them while trying to get food. Israel blames Hamas for the
  suffering in Gaza and says it is taking steps for more aid to reach its
  population, including pausing fighting for part of the day in some areas,
  airdrops and announcing protected routes for aid convoys. UN agencies have
  said that airdrops of food are insufficient and that Israel must let in far
  more aid by land and quickly ease the access to it. Seven Palestinians died of
  malnutrition-related causes over the past 24 hours, including a child, the
  territory’s health ministry said on Saturday. This brings the total deaths
  among children from causes related to malnutrition in Gaza to 93 since the war
  began. The German government, traditionally a staunch ally of Israel, joined
  calls for Israel to deliver more aid on Saturday, saying that the current
  amount remains “very insufficient”. France’s foreign minister also called for
  humanitarian aid to be supplied to the people of Gaza in massive quantities,
  while also denouncing as “despicable” videos of Israeli hostages held in Gaza
  posted by Hamas’s armed wing. With Reuters and Agence France-Presse
