  We sent Terence the script for Song for Marion, and he just turned up at the
  office. He buzzed the door and said: “Is Paul there?” There was a new person
  working in our office at the time, and she said: “No, no one’s in at the
  minute. Who’s calling?” He said: “It’s Terence Stamp.” And then she was like:
  “Well, he’s not here, shall I leave a message?” She didn’t invite him up or
  anything. She left him standing there. And he didn’t give a shit about that,
  to be honest. Me, Terence and Gemma Arterton, who played the music teacher in
  Song for Marion, went to lunch at a vegan cafe in Shoreditch. His character,
  Arthur, was someone who loved his wife (played by Vanessa Redgrave), and would
  do anything for her, but always moaned, was always cantankerous, and found it
  very difficult to show any form of love to his son. He was someone who I based
  on my grandad, and bits of my dad. When his wife dies, it’s Gemma’s character
  who brings him out of his shell a bit, and encourages him to sing. We were
  talking about this character and he looked at me like I was talking in French.
  I stopped and said: “Well, you can always just wing it.” He went, “Yeah, let’s
  wing it.” Working with him, I learned that veteran actors do like to be talked
  to, in terms of being directed. I also learned, without him telling me, that
  he had insecurities as well. When I met him, the first thing he said was: “I’m
  only going to do one take. That’s it.” But then when you got to know him, he
  was like, “Oh, don’t be silly.” He had his bravado. But he was a very
  underrated, very understated actor. When he sang Lullabye by Billy Joel in the
  film, he broke everyone. It was obviously very good, but it was so sad. As a
  kid, I loved him as the baddie in the amazing Superman and Superman II. He’s
  good at frustration. He punches his hands in rage at one point. When we were
  shooting Song for Marion, I remember him coming over to give me a massage,
  because I’d said my back was sore. I’ve never been in more pain in my life. He
  was not the most tender of men. Terence was super, super fit. During filming,
  I went to the apartment where he was staying. He had this set of rotating
  press-up handles. They’re on the ground, and you put your hands on them, and
  as you go, you can turn them. He said: “Go on, do one.” I was like, “Fucking
  hell, I don’t know if I can.” He did loads, and I did one. I was in the peak
  of health, about 39 years old. He was 74 when he did Song for Marion. He was
  so healthy. He didn’t drink. He didn’t do any bad stuff at all. He was
  supposed to eat a chocolate bar in the film, and we had to swap it for a carob
  date bar, otherwise he wouldn’t touch it. We always used to go to a place on
  Berwick Street for tea – a herbal tea, because I thought he’d really like
  that. He had this blue carrier bag with him. In it, he had his script and a
  load of raw beetroot and carrots. He said: “I’m going to make a wicked salad:
  beetroot, carrot, that’s it. A bit of vinegar – gorgeous.” That’s what I
  remember. When we made Song for Marion, he was obviously still known. He had
  just done The Adjustment Bureau, and he had done Steven Soderbergh’s The
  Limey, which wasn’t a massive hit, but it was a really respected film. I
  didn’t expect him to like this kind of script, because it was more commercial
  in terms of the story itself. But we talked about the fact that it reminded
  him very much of the relationship he had with his father. The troubles he had
  with his dad were not dissimilar to his relationship with Christopher
  Eccleston in the film. There was a jealousy of the mum’s attention. We were
  the closing night film at the Toronto film festival. Terence was there, and
  behind him was his younger brother, Chris, who had managed the Who. Chris was
  crying his eyes out, and Terence was very comforting towards him, because they
  recognised their old man. He did like to talk about himself. I’ll give him
  that. He would always go on about how big guys in gyms would beg him to say:
  “Kneel before Zod.” He told me, obviously, about going off to India, about how
  he was absolutely broke and he had to borrow coins to call his agent to find
  out about Superman. He’d tell stories about him and Jim Morrison. The thing
  is, he did have an amazingly interesting life. He was low-key, but when he put
  a suit on, he looked good. He is possibly the best looking man I’ve worked
  with. My old drama teacher came to our screening at the London film festival,
  and the first thing he said to her was that she had wonderful shoes. She’s
  still dining out on that. He was the most charming grump I’ve ever met. He was
  great to work with, but he was such a moaner. Then he would smile, and you’d
  think, he knew what he was doing.
