  Seven is a biblical number, a number dear to ancient Rome, and the number of
  Cristiano Ronaldo’s lucky jersey. Perhaps it is also now going to be the
  answer to Henry Kissinger’s (probably apocryphal) question: what number do I
  call when I want to talk to Europe? Maybe the answer is seven, like the number
  of leaders sitting at the table in Washington on Monday alongside Donald Trump
  and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. It’s difficult to say at this stage whether anything
  good will come from the impromptu White House summit, but European leaders
  showing up as a group in support of Ukraine was a first. This seven-member
  format – Nato, the European Commission, France, Germany, the UK, Italy and
  Finland – truly spoke with one voice. They did so on a crisis, Ukraine, over
  which they have sometimes been bitterly divided throughout the past three and
  a half years (remember Emmanuel Macron’s early concern not to “humiliate”
  Vladimir Putin?). Yet Ukraine is also the dossier over which European leaders
  have converged and yielded the greatest impact during the same timeframe: from
  the 18 sanctions packages the EU has imposed on Russia and the opening of EU
  accession negotiations for Ukraine, to the supply of weapons to Kyiv. In
  Washington, we saw a rare and unprecedented yet admirably balanced European
  ensemble: countries from northern and southern Europe, large and small, two
  nuclear powers and permanent members of the UN security council, the two
  institutions headquartered in Brussels but often appearing to inhabit two
  different planets; and the UK, perfectly in tune with European positions,
  despite having withdrawn from its core political entity. For those like myself
  who have followed the chimera that is European foreign and security policy for
  years, it was almost an epiphany to witness these seven leaders, each speaking
  for two minutes, repeating the exact same message. To be sure, they had
  nuances as varied as their English-language accents. Macron and his German
  counterpart, Friedrich Merz, insisted on a ceasefire, while Italy’s Giorgia
  Meloni claimed ownership of the proposal for possible military protection of
  Ukraine modelled on Nato’s article 5. Yet everyone agreed on the need for
  iron-clad security guarantees for Kyiv, keeping the transatlantic front united
  and the imperative of a just and lasting peace. As always, it took a crisis to
  jolt Europeans out of their inertia. The immediate one began last Friday with
  the shameful summit in Alaska between Trump and Putin. Trump alarmingly
  reneged on threats and ultimatums to Russia and instead rolled out the red
  carpet for the Russian dictator, for reasons we may never fully understand. It
  continued over the weekend with the real risk that Zelenskyy could once again
  be the victim of an Oval Office ambush. Paradoxically, we must thank Trump’s
  vanity, disloyalty, his disdain for liberal and democratic ideals, his
  cynicism, for giving Europeans the urgent signal they needed to dash to the
  table in Washington. Trump may be destroying what remains of the west; but
  together with Putin he is unwittingly proving himself to be Europe’s “other”,
  that is, the external force that is shaping its collective identity, and thus
  the greatest unifier of Europe since the end of the cold war. The key
  question, of course, is where all this shuttle diplomacy leaves Ukraine. For
  good and bad, a momentum is building towards a concrete peace framework –
  albeit without a ceasefire, in a clear nod to Russia’s demands. The contours
  of this deal would involve territorial concessions in the four regions of
  eastern Ukraine illegally annexed by Russia in 2022. These were ominously
  displayed in the Monday meeting by Trump himself on a custom-made board map.
  The more Ukraine and the Europeans converge on the inevitability of land
  concessions, the more they emphasise the need for the US to provide “security
  guarantees”, in effect a collective defence assurance, backed by military
  assistance, akin to Nato’s mutual defence pledge. In the now typical Trumpian
  transatlantic fashion, Europe would have to pay for these. All of this, as
  well as longstanding Russian demands for a future new security architecture in
  Europe, would be the object of the much-touted direct trilateral summit
  between Trump, Zelenskyy and Putin. Finland’s president, Alexander Stubb, one
  of the summit seven, has a maxim about how Europe works which he likes to
  repeat: “First there’s a crisis, then there’s chaos. And in the end, you
  arrive at a suboptimal solution.” One must hope that this time Stubb is wrong:
  the formulas being discussed now are born out of a tragedy and may well be
  suboptimal. But the stakes have rarely been higher: the consequences for all
  of Europe if these talks are followed by chaos could be devastating. Fabrizio
