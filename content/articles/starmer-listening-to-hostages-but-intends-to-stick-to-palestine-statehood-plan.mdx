  Keir Starmer has said he is listening to hostages taken by Hamas but still
  intends to recognise a Palestinian state unless Israel commits to a ceasefire
  and two-state solution. The prime minister said he had spoken to the freed
  British-Israeli Emily Damari, held hostage by Hamas for 471 days, after she
  accused him of “moral failure” over the move to recognise Palestine as a state
  in September at the UN. He said the hostages must be released, but alongside
  that everything possible must be done to alleviate the humanitarian
  catastrophe in Gaza and bring about a ceasefire. Speaking to ITV West Country
  while on a visit to Swindon on Thursday, the prime minister said: “I
  particularly listen to the hostages, Emily Damari, who I have spoken to, I’ve
  met her mother a number of times, and they’ve been through the most awful,
  awful experience for Emily and for her mother. “And that’s why I’ve been
  absolutely clear and steadfast that we must have the remaining hostages
  released. That’s been our position throughout and I absolutely understand the
  unimaginable horror that Emily went through. “Alongside that, we do need to do
  everything we can to alleviate the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, where we
  are seeing the children and babies starving for want of aid which could be
  delivered. “That is why I’ve said unless things materially change on the
  ground, we’ll have to assess this in September, we will recognise Palestine
  before the United Nations general assembly in September.” Damari has said
  Starmer is “not standing on the right side of history” and that she was
  “deeply saddened” by the decision. The government has not been explicit about
  whether Starmer would require remaining hostages taken on 7 October to be
  released before he would be willing to agree Palestinian statehood. He has
  said he will assess “how far both Israel and Hamas have met the steps we set
  out” before taking a decision. But Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary,
  appeared to suggest that Hamas were not part of negotiations over recognition
  of Palestine because they are terrorists rather than the government. Speaking
  to the BBC’s World at One, he said the UK would not get into a “to and fro”
  with Hamas over the recognition plans. Reynolds told reporters: “Our requests
  that all hostages must be released and that Hamas can play no future role in
  the governance of Gaza or a Palestinian state are longstanding. “We don’t
  negotiate with terrorists. Hamas are terrorists and that’s why we don’t get
  into a to and fro with them as to what we want them to do. That’s absolute in
  terms of our request.” Two government sources said that its demands on Hamas
  to free the hostages and sign up to a ceasefire remain unchanged and unrelated
  to the recognition of Palestinian statehood. The government also stressed on
  Thursday that its plans to recognise Palestine are compliant with
  international law, after a group of peers raised concerns that it did not meet
  the legal bar. Gareth Thomas, a business minister, told Times Radio: “In the
  end, recognition of another state is a political judgment and over 140
  countries have already recognised Palestine, and we’re determined to do so in
  September if Israel does not end the violence in Gaza, agree to a ceasefire
  and agree to a lasting route towards a two-state solution, and to no
  annexation in the West Bank.” On Thursday, however, 40 members of the House of
  Lords, including high-profile lawyers, wrote to Richard Hermer, the attorney
  general, challenging the prime minister’s announcement. They said the move
  towards recognising Palestine may breach international law, questioning
  whether it met the conditions of having a defined territory, a permanent
  population, an effective government and the capacity to enter into relations
  with other states. In their letter to Hermer, the peers said there was no
  certainty over the borders of Palestine and no single government, as Hamas and
  Fatah were enemies. Among the peers to have signed the letter are David
  Pannick – who represented the previous government at the supreme court over
  its Rwanda scheme – as well as the KCs Guglielmo Verdirame and Edward Faulks.
  In contrast, Philippe Sands KC, a professor of law at UCL, and a friend of
  Hermer and Starmer, said: “I have no doubt whatsoever that if it were asked,
  the international court of justice would reject the argument that it is
  somehow unlawful to recognise the existence of Palestinian statehood.
  “Palestine meets all the legal criteria of statehood, all that remains is a
  political consideration, namely whether to recognise or not that those
  criteria are met. In its 2024 Advisory Opinion, at paragraph 283, the Court
  recognised ‘the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination,
  including its right to an independent and sovereign State’. The Court did not
  indicate that the ‘right to an independent and sovereign State’ was somehow
  conditional or something for the future. The Court’s language makes clear that
  that right exists now, and it exists because all the criteria for statehood
  are met.” On Thursday No 10 said Starmer had spoken to the Egyptian president,
  Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, about the situation in Gaza. A government spokesperson
  said: “The leaders agreed the situation on the ground was a humanitarian
  catastrophe, and all possible efforts needed to be made to get more aid into
  Gaza at a greater pace and scale. “The prime minister outlined his peace plan
  and pathway to recognition and thanked the president for his leadership in the
  region to secure a lasting and durable two-state solution.” Starmer also
  reiterated his call for the release of all hostages and an immediate
  ceasefire, before the two men turned to UK-Egyptian relations and closer
  cooperation on regional security.
