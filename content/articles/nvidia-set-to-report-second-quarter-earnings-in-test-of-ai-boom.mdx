  Nvidia is set to report its second-quarter earnings on Wednesday, in a first
  test of investor appetite since last week’s mass AI-stock selloff. All eyes
  will be on the chipmaker’s latest financials as the company sets the tone for
  the rest of the AI industry after a turbulent week in the sector. Several tech
  stocks saw shares tumble last week amid growing questions over whether
  AI-driven companies are being overvalued, including an MIT report that said
  95% of AI pilots fail to grow company’s revenues and statements from the
  OpenAI chief executive, Sam Altman, who said investors were possibly
  overhyping several companies. Nvidia, which became the first company to reach
  a $4tn market cap in July, saw a 3.5% drop in shares early last week – its
  biggest drop in months. Stocks recovered modestly by early Wednesday, in
  anticipation of the company’s pivotal earnings report. Still, some analysts
  remain bullish on the so-called AI revolution, especially as major technology
  companies like Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet are investing heavily in
  AI infrastructure. “We are still in the early days of the AI revolution as the
  use cases are just starting to massively expand as more companies recognize
  the value creation being driven by a handful of tech companies,” said the
  Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. Those companies include Nvidia, Ives
  said. “This week will be another flex the muscles moment for Jensen [Huang]
  and Nvidia as well as the AI revolution bull thesis,” Ives said. Wall Street
  expects the company to post $1.01 in earnings per share on $46.05bn in
  revenue, according to Fact Set data. That’s despite an expected hit to the
  company’s bottom line from the restrictions on sales to China. Earlier this
  year, Trump banned AI chip sales in China, a move that resulted in a $4.5bn
  blow to Nvidia’s finances during its fiscal first quarter. In August, the
  company agreed to give the US government a 15% cut of its H20 chips to China
  in return for export licences. China, in turn, has voiced security concerns
  over the chips, and is ramping up production of its own domestic alternatives.
  Experts expect the restrictions to have some impact on the company’s earnings.
  Though Nvidia’s chief executive, Jensen Huang, initially projected the company
  would lose $8bn in the second quarter due to the ban on China chip sales, that
  was before the company struck a deal with the US government. Analysts expect
  the company to continue to perform well but are wary of how these various
  external factors will affect the level of growth. “The continued growth in
  financials and product demand, coupled with sustained demand for datacenter
  products like Blackwell, highlights their strong leadership position,”
  Forrester’s senior analyst Alvin Nguyen said in a statement. “It’ll be
  interesting to see how geopolitical tensions, particularly around China,
  impact expected demand and revenue. The evolving AI ecosystem, adoption of
  Nvidia’s AI software, and innovations like on-chip photonics and robotics are
  key factors shaping their technological edge and new market opportunities.”
