  One Night 9.30pm, ITV1 Wealthy women glugging wine? Check. A dark secret from
  the past exposed? Check! This Liane Moriarty-coded Aussie drama (which
  streamed on ITVX in 2023) tells the story of Simone (Nicole da Silva) who is
  about to publish her first novel, One Night, which is based on a devastating
  event that happened 20 years earlier. But when her two estranged friends Tess
  (Jodie Whittaker) and Hat (Yael Stone) re-enter her life, it becomes clear
  that they were a bigger part of the story than she was. HR 24 Hours That
  Changed the World 8.10pm, Channel 4 Why was Japan so reluctant to surrender at
  the end of the second world war? This documentary explores the second half of
  1945 – the European war was over, nuclear bombs had been dropped on Hiroshima
  and Nagasaki but Japan fought on. Factors included military “honour” and
  Emperor Hirohito’s status as an apparently infallible living god. Phil
  Harrison Beck 9pm, BBC Four The Beck team, weakened by their staff being
  suspended from work or traumatised by it, look into the case of a sexist
  podcaster whose throat has been cut. The denouement, with the instability of
  Vilhelm (Valter Skarsgård) ready to cause further calamity, is super-tense.
  Jack Seale The Count of Monte Cristo 9pm, U&amp;Drama The epic tale of revenge
  continues with Dantès (Sam Claflin) finally escaping prison. He befriends a
  fellow fugitive who helps him find the hidden treasure that Abbé Faria (Jeremy
  Irons) told him about. Before that, the most precious item Dantès could
  discover is a razor to get rid of that ridiculous beard. HR Annika 9.10pm, BBC
  One Letting Nicola Walker address the camera as Scotland-based detective
  Annika Stranhed still makes this crime drama feel fresh and alive. Her musings
  here on Jekyll and Hyde lead us into the case of a slain millionaire, but the
  real drama is in Annika’s odd work/family unit: the interplay between Walker
  and Jamie Sives as DS Michael McAndrews is beautifully brittle. JS Griff’s
  Great American South 9.10pm, Channel 4 Griff Rhys Jones continues his
  rollicking journey and this week ends up in Birmingham, Alabama – considered
  the “true” deep south and which, according to Jones, is the state that
  Americans least want to visit. But a rise in hi-tech organisations means that
  more people are moving there. HR Film choice Night Always Comes, out now,
  Netflix Musician/author Willy Vlautin’s modern noir novel is brought to the
  screen in gritty style by two alumni of The Crown – director Benjamin Caron
  and lead Vanessa Kirby – though the subject matter couldn’t be more different.
  Set over a taut 24 hours, it follows Kirby’s Lynette as she races around the
  city to find the $25,000 needed to buy her home before she, her brother and
  feckless mother are evicted. A drip-feed of revelations about her traumatic
  past life accompany the desperate quest, with Kirby superb as a woman torn
  between what she wants and what she needs. Simon Wardell Ill Met By Moonlight,
  3pm, U&amp;Yesterday The great British partnership of Michael Powell and
  Emeric Pressburger was nearing its end in 1957 when they produced this
  fact-based second world war drama. It isn’t up there with their many classics
  (Powell himself was particularly scathing about it) but there’s a surprising
  jollity to its story of a mission to kidnap a German general (Marius Goring)
  in 1944 Crete and spirit him off the island. Dirk Bogarde is the nonchalant
  leader of the operation, Maj “Paddy” Leigh Fermor, while the local resistance
  are a fun-loving bunch despite the occupation. SW Hounds, 10.30pm, BBC Four In
  a Casablanca far from the tourist traps, petty criminal Hassan (Abdellatif
  Masstouri) and his as-yet untainted son Isaam (Ayoub Elaid) are hired by
  Hassan’s boss to abduct a man. Unfortunately, the victim suffocates in their
  van, so they set off across the city in an error-strewn attempt to dispose of
  the body before daylight. Kamal Lazraq’s neorealist Cannes winner offers a raw
  but sometimes comic closeup on the underbelly of Moroccan society, while the
  shifts in the father-son relationship give the film dramatic heft, despite the
  leads being nonprofessional. SW Live sport Premier League Football: Aston
  Villa v Newcastle, 11am, TNT Sport 1 Followed by Wolves v Man City at 5pm on
  Sky Sports Main Event. Championship Football: Wrexham v West Brom, noon, ITV1
  From StōK Racecourse. Athletics: Diamond League Silesia, 3pm, BBC Two The 12th
  meeting, from Silesian Stadium in Chorzów, Poland.
