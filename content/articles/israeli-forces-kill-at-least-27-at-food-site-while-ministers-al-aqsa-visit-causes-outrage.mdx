  At least 27 people were killed by Israeli forces while trying to get food and
  six others died from starvation or malnutrition in Gaza on Sunday, Palestinian
  officials said, amid a regional outcry over an Israeli minister’s visit to
  Jerusalem’s most sensitive holy site. Witnesses said Israeli forces fired on
  hungry crowds who were attempting to get food from a distribution site run by
  the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) in the south of the
  territory, with some describing the fire as indiscriminate. “I couldn’t stop
  and help because of the bullets,” Yousef Abed told the Associated Press after
  seeing at least three people bleeding on the ground as Israeli forces opened
  fire. Sunday’s killings were the latest in a string of deadly shootings
  targeting hungry people. At least 1,400 people have been killed while seeking
  aid since 27 May, most of whom were killed near GHF sites, while others were
  killed along the routes of aid convoys, the UN said on Friday. The GHF says it
  only uses pepper spray or fires warning shots to control crowds. In total, 119
  people were killed in Gaza by Israeli shootings and strikes over the last 24
  hours, including those seeking aid, the Gaza health ministry said. The
  Palestinian Red Crescent said the Israeli military targeted its headquarters
  in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, on Sunday, killing one staffer and wounding
  three more. Video taken by an employee showed the headquarters in flames after
  the strike, which had destroyed much of the building. A separate Israeli
  strike hit a school in Khan Younis that displaced people had been using as
  shelter, killing at least two people. Gaza’s population is growing
  increasingly desperate as the territory sinks further into famine, which
  experts say is a product of Israel’s continued blockade of aid. Israel has
  vehemently denied there is a starvation crisis in Gaza and announced expanded
  aid measures last week, but humanitarians say Israel is still severely
  restricting the entry of aid. Six people have died of starvation or
  malnutrition in the past 24 hours, health officials said, bringing the total
  number who have died from hunger to 175, 93 of whom were children. The pace of
  starvation deaths surged in July with more people dying from hunger than in
  the previous 20 months combined. Humanitarians say a far greater amount of aid
  needs to enter Gaza to help stabilise the starvation emergency. “We need the
  sustainable entry of humanitarian aid to flood Gaza with aid for a relatively
  long period of time. Patients and hospitals need more food than usual to
  contribute to their recovery,” said Hisham Mhanna, a spokesperson for the ICRC
  in Gaza. He said the emergency compounded Gaza’s existing crises, which
  include a devastated healthcare system and the spread of disease. Faced with
  starvation and lack of humanitarian supplies, aid groups are struggling to
  help the population of Gaza. In total, at least 60,839 people have been killed
  in Gaza during Israel’s current military operations, launched after the
  Hamas-led attack in Israel on 7 October 2023 which killed about 1,200 people.
  While Israeli strikes continued in Gaza, Israel’s far-right national security
  minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, led prayers at al-Aqsa mosque in occupied East
  Jerusalem, provoking outrage among regional powers. Ben-Gvir was among a group
  of about 1,250 people who prayed at the compound on Sunday under the
  protection of the Israeli military. The compound, which Jews call the Temple
  Mount, is a highly revered site – the holiest in Judaism and the third holiest
  in Islam. The site is under Jordanian custodianship; under a decades-old
  agreement, Jews are allowed to visit but not pray there. Jordan condemned the
  visit, which it described as “an unacceptable provocation”. Its foreign
  ministry said it “affirmed the kingdom’s absolute rejection and strong
  condemnation of the continued unacceptable incursions by the extremist
  minister Ben-Gvir”. Ben-Gvir’s visit was in honour of Tisha B’Av, when Jews
  mourn the destruction of two Jewish temples, and was the first time that an
  Israeli minister had publicly prayed at the site. The compound has been the
  scene of clashes in the past, with Israeli police raiding the mosque in 2023
  after Palestinians occupied it in response to reports that Jews were planning
  a religious ceremony there. Ben-Gvir called for the annexation of Gaza and for
  Palestinians to leave the territory while at al-Aqsa on Sunday. He said in a
  post on X: “A message must be sent: to ensure that we conquer all of the Gaza
  Strip, declare sovereignty …. This is the only way that we will return the
  hostages and win the war.” Benjamin Netanyahu put out a statement after the
  visit saying the policy governing the compound “has not changed and will not
  change”. The controversy came as the Israeli public was reeling from the
  release of two videos over the weekend showing emaciated hostages being held
  by Hamas in Gaza, which triggered protests on Saturday. Netanyahu on Sunday
  requested the help of the International Committee of the Red Cross to provide
  food and medical aid to the hostages in Gaza. Hamas responded that it was
  ready to provide Red Cross aid to the hostages if Israel halted “all forms of
  air traffic” during the delivery of packages. The occupied West Bank was also
  gripped by demonstrations on Sunday, with thousands protesting against the war
  in Gaza and the detention of Palestinians in Israeli prisons. Protesters
  carried photos of Palestinians killed or detained by Israel, as well as photos
  of starving children in Gaza. More than 10,800 Palestinians are held in
  Israeli prisons. Rights groups have documented widespread torture of
  Palestinians by Israeli prison guards and soldiers, including sexual abuse,
  food deprivation and physical abuse.
