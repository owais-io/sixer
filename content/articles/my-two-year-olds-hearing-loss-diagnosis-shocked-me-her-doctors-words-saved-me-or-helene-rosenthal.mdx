  I should not have been surprised by what the audiologist was saying to me and
  my husband. Hearing loss runs in my family. My mother was profoundly deaf, and
  so were my grandfather and great uncles. And yet when we were told our
  daughter had a moderate to severe hearing loss and would have to wear hearing
  aids for the rest of her life, I felt as if I had been hit by a bus. I was
  dead. It was 1996, and we were sitting in a spartan doctor’s office in
  downtown New York. It wasn’t a warm and cozy environment like our
  paediatrician’s – there were no pictures of dinosaurs on the walls or puzzles
  strewn about. No low, cushioned seats for the kids to sit on. The consulting
  room was dark, with one blinking fluorescent light, a metal desk and a couple
  of wooden chairs. The centre was a not-for-profit that cared for those with
  hearing loss and deafness. What they lacked in decor they more than made up
  for in their mission. We were here because there was something about Zoe, our
  two-year-old daughter, that gave me pause. At home she was the life of the
  party but whenever we left the house she became painfully shy. This is not
  exactly a textbook symptom of hearing loss, but given my family history I knew
  it could be. My husband and I were both seated at the desk, and Zoe was
  sitting on my lap. In this lifeless room she was a burst of colour. Dressed in
  her signature style of head-to-toe pink, she was wearing one of the three
  dresses she cycled through every week, accessorised by an oversized bedazzled
  bow that sparkled every time she twirled (which was constantly). She was
  adorable. As I watched the audiologist fit her with the kind of behind-the-ear
  aids my grandfather wore, I cried. She was so little and these beige medical
  devices were enormous. I am ashamed to admit it, but all I could think at that
  moment was: “Who will ever take Zoe to the prom with these big clunky things
  sticking out of her ears?” The audiologist saw my face and said a profound
  thing to me that has stayed with me through the years: “The hearing aids get
  smaller as the child gets bigger.” Back then I had no idea what she was
  talking about – or what a salve this advice would come to be. My head was
  spinning as I imagined all the kids pointing to Zoe’s ears and wondering what
  those ugly things were – they were like a billboard for Zoe’s disability. I
  worried she would become self-conscious and ultimately embarrassed about who
  she was. As if I had a crystal ball, I envisioned her as an insecure adult
  unable to form meaningful relationships. The doctor held the hearing aids up
  to her own ears and said: “See? Not so big.” And I had to admit she had a
  point. Then she gave me a mirror and suggested I hold them up to my own ears,
  and I was even more convinced that she was right. I stopped fidgeting and
  tapping my foot. But she wasn’t done. She opened her desk drawer and pulled
  out several pairs of hearing aids. She lined them up, the oldest model to the
  latest, and explained: “This is how far the technology has come in just four
  years.” I was shocked at how much smaller the most recently designed aids
  were. But it wasn’t only size that differentiated them: the newest ones
  looked, well, cool. Like something Apple would have designed. “I have no doubt
  the technology will keep evolving,” she reassured me. The doctor’s words rang
  true both literally and metaphorically. Zoe would grow up and those clunky
  things behind her ears would become almost unnoticeable. But even more, the
  big bad thing I thought would define my daughter would also fade into the
  background. Zoe would always be hard of hearing, but as I came to terms with
  her hearing loss, it became clear that would only be one data point in her
  life. She would also be hilarious, mathematical and steadfast in her belief
  that Love Actually is the best movie ever made. Over the years, that
  conversation with the audiologist became a reminder that we had done right by
  our daughter. Fitting her at age two with big clunky hearing aids might have
  felt like a loss at the time, but early intervention meant Zoe did not become
  speech delayed and miss out on crucial developmental and socialisation
  milestones. Sixteen years after I sat in that office chair wondering if anyone
  would ever take my daughter to the prom, Zoe was stepping into a long pink
  gown and fluorescent pink heels on her way to the dance. The truth is it was
  never about the prom but about wanting Zoe to fit in. Her doctor’s words spoke
  to the moment, but they reverberated for years to come. Whenever I catch
  myself jumping to conclusions or pretending to know how others will react, I
  stop and remember what a wise, kind audiologist once said: “The hearing aids
  get smaller as the child gets bigger.” Nothing is static and everything is in
  a constant state of change. Even this imperfect mum. Helene Rosenthal lives in
