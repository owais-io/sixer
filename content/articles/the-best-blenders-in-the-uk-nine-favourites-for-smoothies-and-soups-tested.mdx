  Eating your five-a-day can be tricky – let alone the 10 a day recommended by
  some. However, a decent blender can push you in the right direction by
  blitzing up healthy, wholesome soups or nutritious smoothies to start the day
  right. Unlike many kitchen appliances, most blenders are economical to run –
  so won’t increase your bills dramatically. Some can even heat your soup for
  tuppence (and we’ve tested them all to make sure that they’re
  energy-efficient). However, the difference in functions, versatility and
  maintenance can be startling. I put nine blenders from some of the most
  well-known manufacturers through their paces to separate the smooth operators
  from the far-from-brilliant buys. *** At a glance Best blender overall: Braun
  PowerBlend 9 jug blender JB9040BK £149 at Amazon Best budget blender: Kenwood
  Blend-X Fresh blender BLP41.A0GO £66.99 at Kenwood Best stick blender:
  KitchenAid Go cordless hand blender £186.15 at KitchenAid Best investment
  blender: Vitamix Explorian E520 £497.94 at Tesco *** Why you should trust me
  I’ve spent decades testing appliances: my kitchen has hosted hundreds of them.
  So, unsurprisingly, I know what I like in a blender. For a start, I’m looking
  for frighteningly sharp blades. All the parts that come into contact with food
  should be simple to hand-wash or put in the dishwasher because I have minimal
  patience for cleaning. My ideal blender should be able to tackle frozen chunks
  of fruit or veg (for when I haven’t had time to shop for fresh) and be easy to
  scrape out or, in the case of personal blenders, be easy to drink from. How I
  tested I’m something of a smoothie convert. I’ve been on the green stuff daily
  ever since I tested my first blender. For me, the average smoothie consists of
  whatever fruit I have, spinach, a dash of ginger and flaxseed (I’ve tried
  broccoli, but even the smallest floret makes the smoothie taste funky).
  Sometimes, when I feel like living dangerously, I throw in a dollop of
  yoghurt. To test the blenders, I made my usual drink, substituting fresh
  spinach for frozen to test the sharpness of the blades, and adding apple to
  detect fruit skin, orange for any remaining pith, kiwi for its many seeds and
  banana. I used whole flaxseed to assess the ability to grind and turmeric to
  assess the potential risk of staining, plus enough water to fill the
  containers at least halfway. All while Googling whether you can overdose on
  vitamin C (answer: you can, but it’s hard) because I’m fairly certain you’re
  not meant to drink smoothies in pints. Each blender was tested on its ability
  to turn chunky soup into smooth, taking on a mix of cooked veg, including red
  pepper, beans and pasta. For those that heated soup, this was done from
  chilled, and the resulting temperature was taken at the end of the cycle. A
  power meter measured the running cost of each on the highest setting for a
  minute, using the current price cap of 25.73p a kWh. I tested nine blenders.
  The blenders sourced for this article were either returned to their sources or
  donated to the British Heart Foundation. *** The best blenders in 2025 in the
  UK *** Best blender overall: Braun PowerBlend 9 jug blender JB9040BK £199 at
  John Lewis £149 at Amazon If you’d told me a blender that cost less than £200
  would impress me most during testing, I might have choked on my smoothie. Yet,
  the PowerBlend 9 did just that. It has a great mix of programs, including a
  cleaning setting that was good at flushing out debris from around the blades,
  and a smoothie program that gave a choice of different textures. Why we love
  it The PowerBlend 9 excels in most areas. It has a large enough jug to be
  useful when whipping up soup for a family, a count-up/down timer and enough
  auto settings for keen cooks. The performance was excellent when making
  smoothies: in less than a minute, all traces of the spinach were gone and the
  drink was free of seeds, skin or lumps. It comes with a tamper so you can make
  frozen desserts easily, too. As well as blitzing soup, the blender heats it
  using the friction of the blades. In just five minutes and 45 seconds, I
  heated it to 94C (if anything, this is slightly too hot, but it would cool
  down rapidly if poured into a cold bowl). This used 0.106kWh, costing about
  3p. Unlike when testing the other blenders, my power meter detected that the
  PowerBlend 9 was drawing a small amount of electricity when the screen was on
  but the blender wasn’t in use. Always remember to turn it off at the switch.
  Only some parts are dishwasher safe: the lid, measuring cap and detachable
  blades. But the Clean program, plus a quick rinse afterwards, helps keep the
  jug clean. It’s a shame that … it emits an ear-splitting whine on the highest
  settings that can clear a room of people in seconds. Running cost an hour on
  maximum: 25p (0.412p/minute = 0.96kWh) Maximum capacity: 3l (working capacity
  2l) Auto functions: smoothie, soup, chop, ice crush, frozen dessert, spread,
  clean Dishwasher safe: lid, measuring cap and detachable blades only (but no
  mention of this in instructions, yet online listing says yes) Spare parts:
  available at 4 Braun Household *** Best budget blender: Kenwood Blend-X Fresh
  blender BLP41.A0GO £66.99 at Currys £66.99 at Kenwood While this may not be
  the best blender you can buy, the Blend-X Fresh is excellent value for money.
  It has three speeds, as well as a pulse setting, and a dedicated ice-crush
  button. The jug has a good family-size capacity, and the running costs are
  low. Why we love it The Blend-X Fresh is surprisingly easy to keep clean for a
  budget model – so much so that it’s the main reason it made our selection. Its
  blades unscrew, so you can make sure there’s no food residue hiding underneath
  them. They’re easily reattached, screwing in the opposite direction to which
  you twist the jug into the base, meaning you won’t accidentally leave them
  behind after blending. The jug is also quite light, so it’s not too heavy to
  carry around even when it’s full. Its performance was solid during testing:
  after a minute’s blending, most seeds vanished into the smoothie. While there
  were slight flecks of fruit skin, all the frozen spinach was incorporated. The
  soup was blended in only 30 seconds and was beautifully smooth, with just a
  little remaining pepper skin that had escaped the blades. It was quite noisy
  on the higher speeds. It’s a shame that … its lid feels flimsier than the
  rest; used regularly, this is probably the part you’ll end up replacing.
  Running cost an hour on maximum: 8p (0.129p/minute = 0.3kWh) Maximum capacity:
  2l (working capacity 1.5l) Auto functions: none Dishwasher safe: yes, but
  blades detach to be cleaned by hand Spare parts: available at 4 Kenwood ***
  Best stick blender: KitchenAid Go cordless hand blender plus accessories with
  battery £186.15 at KitchenAid £148.95 without battery at Harts of Stur It’s
  expensive for a stick blender, but KitchenAid’s Go justifies the price tag by
  being seriously versatile. Cordless – so there’s no need to be tied to a
  socket when blending – and immersible, it’s ideal for blitzing soup that’s
  still in the pot (a pan guard ensures it won’t scratch the base), as well as
  multiple other processing tasks. If you already have the compatible battery,
  you can subtract more than £30 from the price. Why we love it This one made
  the list for its flexibility and ease of storage. It can not only be used
  anywhere in your kitchen but also whisks, chops and mixes as well as blends. I
  was impressed that it could tackle frozen and fresh ingredients, as hand
  blenders rarely have the power to do so. The smoothie had a little residue
  remaining, with the kiwi seeds mostly escaping the blades, and it was frothier
  than I like, but overall, the performance was good for a stick blender. It
  excelled at blending soup: no lumps or pepper skin remained, and it took only
  about 15 seconds to puree it. There are a couple of downsides. There’s only
  one speed – meaning it can be tricky to control consistency at first – and
  having the battery on top makes it weighty: not something you’d want to hold
  upright for a long time. It’s a shame that … it’s awkward to depress two
  buttons at once – the unlock and power buttons – so it takes some getting used
  to. Running cost an hour on maximum: cordless, so unavailable (three-hour
  recharge estimated to be just under 2p) Maximum capacity: 1l (supplied jug)
  Auto functions: none Dishwasher safe: yes, most parts (blender arm is
  hand-wash only) Spare parts: extra and spare parts are available at KitchenAid
  online (contact the company directly for smaller parts), and it can arrange
  repairs *** Best investment blender: Vitamix Explorian E520 £497.94 at Tesco
  £497.95 at Harts of Stur There’s no getting away from it, Vitamix blenders are
  pricey. The Explorian E520 I reviewed is the most expensive blender in this
  roundup – but the brand’s machines offer a lot in return. The E520, for
  example, has 10 speeds, a pulse and three settings that will heat soup and
  deliver silky-smooth smoothies. Its seven-year warranty adds confidence that
  this blender will keep performing efficiently. Why we love it The Explorian
  E520 is made for smoothies: its dedicated setting resulted in the best
  smoothie overall, starting at a slow speed before ramping up to a noisy whirl.
  In 50 seconds it created a flawlessly smooth drink – no lumps, no skin, no
  seeds. It also performed excellently when heating and blending soup using the
  dedicated setting. This lasted for five minutes and 49 seconds – using
  0.094kWh, which would cost about 2p, the same cost as the Braun reviewed
  above. Unlike the Braun blender, though, the resulting soup was a little
  cooler, at 82C from chilled, so you won’t have to wait too long for it to be a
  suitable consumption temperature. It’s a shame that … buying the Explorian
  E520 will dent your small appliance budget. But just think of all the money
  you’ll save on frozen yoghurt. Running cost an hour on maximum: 22p
  (0.360p/minute = 0.84kWh) Maximum capacity: 2l Auto functions: smoothie,
  frozen dessert, hot soup Dishwasher safe: yes, all parts, but can also run
  self clean on the base Spare parts: compatible lids are available as spare
  parts, as are extra jugs with lids, plus repairs are available via authorised
  centres. If under warranty, they can be repaired or replaced without cost.
  Spare parts can be found on the Vitamix site *** The best of the rest ***
  Russell Hobbs Desire matte charcoal jug blender £50 at Argos £49.99 at Amazon
  Best for: blending newbies If you’re not sure how much use you’ll get out of a
  full-sized blender, the Russell Hobbs Desire is a good one to start with.
  That’s because it’s affordable and has a good working capacity (1.5 litres),
  along with a choice of two speeds and pulse. It can be cleaned in the
  dishwasher – although hand-washing is recommended – and it performs reasonably
  well. In testing, the smoothie it made wasn’t entirely smooth after a minute
  of blending, but it did well with cooled soup: 30 seconds on the top speed was
  enough for a fairly consistent result. It didn’t make the final cut because …
  it has a heavy glass jug and isn’t suitable for hot liquid blending. Running
  cost an hour on maximum: 11p (0.180p/minute = 0.42kWh); maximum capacity:
  1.5l; auto functions: none; dishwasher safe: yes but hand-washing recommended
  *** Cuisinart Cordless On The Go blender £25 at eCookshop £25 at Amazon Best
  for: taking to the office Cordless, compact and convenient, Cuisinart’s
  Cordless On The Go blender has a lot you’ll love, from a handy recipe book in
  the box to the useful carry handle on the cup’s lid. A two-hour charge is
  enough for eight smoothies, so you can go more than a week without thinking
  about a socket, and it’ll switch off automatically after blending for a
  minute. However, unlike the KitchenAid Go blender I tested, this cordless
  design lacks power: the smoothie still had fruit residue and kiwi seeds, and
  the soup was smooth but had visible herbs after a minute’s blitz. It didn’t
  make the final cut because … its cup is fairly large for a personal blender,
  but the maximum fill line is low, so you’ll only be able to blitz a smaller
  amount of liquid at a time – it’s on the small side for a standard smoothie.
  Even the Ninja Blast had a bigger capacity, and it’s a smaller machine.
  Running cost an hour on maximum: cordless, so unavailable; maximum capacity:
  450ml working capacity; auto functions: none; dishwasher safe: yes, but blades
  are hand-wash only *** ProCook blender and smoothie maker £149 at ProCook Best
  for: busy families For those who like the Vitamix but not the price tag,
  ProCook’s blender is a good choice. There’s a tamper to nudge frozen food
  towards the blades, 10 speeds and a juice program that also works for
  smoothies. The smoothie I made was perfectly smooth with only a little texture
  remaining, and I had the same result for soup. The blender feels robust, and I
  liked the illuminated dial when selecting a program. The vented lid allows you
  to blend hot liquids, although it won’t heat soup, and it has a two-litre jug
  that’s relatively lightweight when full. It is, however, noisy on the top
  speeds, and hand-wash only, so keep it out of your dishwasher. It didn’t make
  the final cut because … three programs felt skimpy compared with other models,
  especially as pulse and ice crush are similar processes. And dishwasher
  devotees will be disappointed. Running cost an hour on maximum: 23p
  (0.386p/minute = 0.9kWh); maximum capacity: 2l; auto functions: juice, ice
  crush, pulse; dishwasher safe: no, hand-wash only *** Nutribullet Magic Bullet
  starter kit £39.99 at Nutribullet £32.90 at Amazon Best for: small kitchens
  Affordable and easy to store, the latest version of the Magic Bullet combines
  everything that made the original appealing with a more pocket-friendly price
  tag. However, it lags behind more advanced personal blenders somewhat. I was
  disappointed with how little guidance there was for making smoothies, and that
  both of the cups in this set are quite small: the tallest is only 680ml, with
  a smaller working capacity. The smoothie I made had some visible apple skin
  and seeds after a minute of blending, and the lid was awkward to drink from
  because the cover had to be held open. Soup was smooth, though, and I liked
  that food could be blended for as long as required by locking the cup in
  place. It didn’t make the final cut because … the instructions recommended
  replacing the blades every six months, which doesn’t inspire much confidence
  in their longevity. Running cost an hour on maximum: 5p (0.078p/minute =
  0.18kWh); maximum capacity: 680ml; auto functions: none; dishwasher safe: yes,
  but the power base that holds the blades is hand-wash only *** Ninja Blast
  cordless portable blender BC151UKNV £49.99 at Ninja £44.99 at Amazon Best for:
  gym workouts Taking the title of Ninja’s most compact and quietest blender,
  this mini marvel is definitely one to pop in your gym bag. It’s an on-the-go
  blender rather than a kitchen workhorse, offering 30-second bursts of shake
  and smoothie making for a pre- or post-workout boost. That does mean its
  capacity is fairly limited – about 450ml max – but there’s enough power to
  tackle frozen lumps. The smoothie I made had some fruit skin and seeds left
  behind, but all traces of the frozen spinach had gone. It was less suitable
  for soup: a minute of blending worked through all the lumps, but there was
  more texture than with other blenders, and the cup size was limiting. I liked
  that the vessel and lid were dishwasher-safe, though, and it was easy to drink
  from. It didn’t make the final cut because … it doesn’t have quite enough
  power to blitz seeds and different types of fruit to a silky-smooth
  consistency. Running cost an hour on maximum: cordless, so unavailable;
  maximum capacity: 470ml working capacity; auto functions: none; dishwasher
  safe: yes, but the motor base (blades are integral) must be rinsed/cleaned by
  hand *** What you need to know Blenders all do roughly the same thing – blend
  – but their capacity, power and how they do it vary. This means that finding
  the blender that’s best for you depends on what you’re most likely to use it
  for and how often. Blenders vs food processors If you have room for only one
  appliance on your worktop, and it’s between a food processor and a blender,
  think about the tasks you’ll need it to tackle. Food processors are geared
  towards chopping, slicing, mixing and whipping, as well as processing dry
  food, such as bread into breadcrumbs, whereas blenders are better for liquids,
  including batters, drinks, smoothies and soups. There may be some crossover:
  food processors with blender attachments, or blenders with a chopping
  container. However, these can lack power or not possess the same versatility
  as a dedicated appliance (for example, there may be only one speed on a
  blender attachment). What type of blender do you need? Blenders usually fit
  into one of three categories: Jug-style blenders are good for keen cooks and
  those who batch cook or make smoothie bowls, milkshakes or smoothies for a
  family or crowd. A full-sized jug blender is ideal for whipping up sauces,
  pancake batter, soups, nut butter, non-dairy milk, ice-cream, cocktails or
  mocktails and desserts. Personal blenders are usually smaller, with on-the-go
  cups. They’re best for smoothies and other drinks, with enough capacity for
  one or two people. Smaller households may be able to use one for most everyday
  blending. Most aren’t suitable for hot liquids, and they tend not to have
  enough capacity to blend a batch of soup. Stick blenders are best for blending
  directly in a pan, bowl or jug without having to transfer the contents into a
  full-sized blender. They’re great for speedy blending of soups, stews and
  desserts, but less suitable for convenient daily smoothies. How much should
  you spend, and what are the key features to look for? You can pick up a basic
  jug-style blender for as little as £25, but it may lack power. You may also
  find that blades and other removable parts may not last as long if it’s in use
  every day. Thinner plastic jugs and lids tend to be more prone to breakage, so
  it’s worth investing in a blender with a robust, thick plastic or glass jug if
  you can, and a snugly fitting lid. For a longer lifespan, clean the parts by
  hand rather than in the dishwasher. The combination of hot temperatures and
  the slightly abrasive nature of dishwasher detergents tends to wear away at
  parts faster than if you wash them by hand. Personal blenders tend to be
  cheaper, starting from £20. Affordable options can be low power, though, so
  check the wattage. From £50 upwards, the price is usually dictated by the
  number of accessories. The same goes for stick blenders: as little as £15 will
  buy you one, but you’ll need to spend more like £30-60 if you need a lot of
  power or accessories. If you’re keen to save and don’t need a box-fresh
  appliance, a refurbished or returned blender could be a good option. Try
  Amazon’s Second Chance store; direct from the retailer, such as Vitamix’s
  reconditioned blenders; or a specialist refurbished retailer, such as Back
  Market. For any refurbished appliance, check that it comes with a warranty and
  customer support in case of any problems (a phone number or chat facility is
  good; a form or email address, less so). Also, check the product is in good
  order before you start to use it: don’t worry about minor scratches on parts
  that aren’t in contact with food, but return appliances if the jug or
  containers have chips or cracks. Likewise, if power cables show any damage,
  return the item without using it. How to clean your blender There are two
  basic ways to clean a blender: quick or deep. Quick cleans work best straight
  after use. Fill the jug halfway with warm water, add a couple of drops of
  washing-up liquid, pop on the lid and run for about a minute (pricier blenders
  may have a self-cleaning program, which will time it for you). If you often
  blend seeds or nuts, occasionally add 50ml of white vinegar to the warm, soapy
  water to help remove residue. Afterwards, rinse thoroughly. The quick method
  doesn’t always remove debris under the blades, however. For that, you’ll need
  a deep clean. If you’re hand washing, equip yourself with an angled brush for
  scrubbing around the blades. Detachable blade units will be easier to clean,
  but if the blades are fixed and there’s stubborn debris, fill with warm water
  and washing-up liquid, and leave to soak before cleaning. Or if your blender
  jug is dishwasher safe, it can do a deep clean for you. No matter what method
  you use, blender jugs can become cloudy. To bring back the shine, mix
  bicarbonate of soda with enough water to make a paste, apply to the interior,
  leave for half an hour, then lightly scrub with a wet sponge: this should
  remove the film. For more kitchen inspiration, read our guide on the best slow
  cookers *** Rachel Ogden has worked as a consumer journalist for decades,

  successful at repacking. Her home has hosted hundreds of small appliances,

It’s a shame that … it’s awkward to depress two buttons at once – the unlock and power buttons – so it takes some getting used to. Running cost an hour on maximum: cordless, so unavailable (three-hour recharge estimated to be just under 2p) Maximum capacity: 1l (supplied jug) Auto functions: none Dishwasher safe: yes, most parts (blender arm is hand-wash only) Spare parts: extra and spare parts are available at KitchenAid online (contact the company directly for smaller parts), and it can arrange repairs *** Best investment blender: Vitamix Explorian E520 £497.94 at Tesco £497.95 at Harts of Stur There’s no getting away from it, Vitamix blenders are pricey. The Explorian E520 I reviewed is the most expensive blender in this roundup – but the brand’s machines offer a lot in return. The E520, for example, has 10 speeds, a pulse and three settings that will heat soup and deliver silky-smooth smoothies. Its seven-year warranty adds confidence that this blender will keep performing efficiently. Why we love it The Explorian E520 is made for smoothies: its dedicated setting resulted in the best smoothie overall, starting at a slow speed before ramping up to a noisy whirl. In 50 seconds it created a flawlessly smooth drink – no lumps, no skin, no seeds. It also performed excellently when heating and blending soup using the dedicated setting. This lasted for five minutes and 49 seconds – using 0.094kWh, which would cost about 2p, the same cost as the Braun reviewed above. Unlike the Braun blender, though, the resulting soup was a little cooler, at 82C from chilled, so you won’t have to wait too long for it to be a suitable consumption temperature. It’s a shame that … buying the Explorian E520 will dent your small appliance budget. But just think of all the money you’ll save on frozen yoghurt. Running cost an hour on maximum: 22p (0.360p/minute = 0.84kWh) Maximum capacity: 2l Auto functions: smoothie, frozen dessert, hot soup Dishwasher safe: yes, all parts, but can also run self clean on the base Spare parts: compatible lids are available as spare parts, as are extra jugs with lids, plus repairs are available via authorised centres. If under warranty, they can be repaired or replaced without cost. Spare parts can be found on the Vitamix site *** The best of the rest *** Russell Hobbs Desire matte charcoal jug blender £50 at Argos £49.99 at Amazon Best for: blending newbies If you’re not sure how much use you’ll get out of a full-sized blender, the Russell Hobbs Desire is a good one to start with. That’s because it’s affordable and has a good working capacity (1.5 litres), along with a choice of two speeds and pulse. It can be cleaned in the dishwasher – although hand-washing is recommended – and it performs reasonably well. In testing, the smoothie it made wasn’t entirely smooth after a minute of blending, but it did well with cooled soup: 30 seconds on the top speed was enough for a fairly consistent result. It didn’t make the final cut because … it has a heavy glass jug and isn’t suitable for hot liquid blending. Running cost an hour on maximum: 11p (0.180p/minute = 0.42kWh); maximum capacity: 1.5l; auto functions: none; dishwasher safe: yes but hand-washing recommended *** Cuisinart Cordless On The Go blender £25 at eCookshop £25 at Amazon Best for: taking to the office Cordless, compact and convenient, Cuisinart’s Cordless On The Go blender has a lot you’ll love, from a handy recipe book in the box to the useful carry handle on the cup’s lid. A two-hour charge is enough for eight smoothies, so you can go more than a week without thinking about a socket, and it’ll switch off automatically after blending for a minute. However, unlike the KitchenAid Go blender I tested, this cordless design lacks power: the smoothie still had fruit residue and kiwi seeds, and the soup was smooth but had visible herbs after a minute’s blitz. It didn’t make the final cut because … its cup is fairly large for a personal blender, but the maximum fill line is low, so you’ll only be able to blitz a smaller amount of liquid at a time – it’s on the small side for a standard smoothie. Even the Ninja Blast had a bigger capacity, and it’s a smaller machine. Running cost an hour on maximum: cordless, so unavailable; maximum capacity: 450ml working capacity; auto functions: none; dishwasher safe: yes, but blades are hand-wash only *** ProCook blender and smoothie maker £149 at ProCook Best for: busy families For those who like the Vitamix but not the price tag, ProCook’s blender is a good choice. There’s a tamper to nudge frozen food towards the blades, 10 speeds and a juice program that also works for smoothies. The smoothie I made was perfectly smooth with only a little texture remaining, and I had the same result for soup. The blender feels robust, and I liked the illuminated dial when selecting a program. The vented lid allows you to blend hot liquids, although it won’t heat soup, and it has a two-litre jug that’s relatively lightweight when full. It is, however, noisy on the top speeds, and hand-wash only, so keep it out of your dishwasher. It didn’t make the final cut because … three programs felt skimpy compared with other models, especially as pulse and ice crush are similar processes. And dishwasher devotees will be disappointed. Running cost an hour on maximum: 23p (0.386p/minute = 0.9kWh); maximum capacity: 2l; auto functions: juice, ice crush, pulse; dishwasher safe: no, hand-wash only *** Nutribullet Magic Bullet starter kit £39.99 at Nutribullet £32.90 at Amazon Best for: small kitchens Affordable and easy to store, the latest version of the Magic Bullet combines everything that made the original appealing with a more pocket-friendly price tag. However, it lags behind more advanced personal blenders somewhat. I was disappointed with how little guidance there was for making smoothies, and that both of the cups in this set are quite small: the tallest is only 680ml, with a smaller working capacity. The smoothie I made had some visible apple skin and seeds after a minute of blending, and the lid was awkward to drink from because the cover had to be held open. Soup was smooth, though, and I liked that food could be blended for as long as required by locking the cup in place. It didn’t make the final cut because … the instructions recommended replacing the blades every six months, which doesn’t inspire much confidence in their longevity. Running cost an hour on maximum: 5p (0.078p/minute = 0.18kWh); maximum capacity: 680ml; auto functions: none; dishwasher safe: yes, but the power base that holds the blades is hand-wash only *** Ninja Blast cordless portable blender BC151UKNV £49.99 at Ninja £44.99 at Amazon Best for: gym workouts Taking the title of Ninja’s most compact and quietest blender, this mini marvel is definitely one to pop in your gym bag. It’s an on-the-go blender rather than a kitchen workhorse, offering 30-second bursts of shake and smoothie making for a pre- or post-workout boost. That does mean its capacity is fairly limited – about 450ml max – but there’s enough power to tackle frozen lumps. The smoothie I made had some fruit skin and seeds left behind, but all traces of the frozen spinach had gone. It was less suitable for soup: a minute of blending worked through all the lumps, but there was more texture than with other blenders, and the cup size was limiting. I liked that the vessel and lid were dishwasher-safe, though, and it was easy to drink from. It didn’t make the final cut because … it doesn’t have quite enough power to blitz seeds and different types of fruit to a silky-smooth consistency. Running cost an hour on maximum: cordless, so unavailable; maximum capacity: 470ml working capacity; auto functions: none; dishwasher safe: yes, but the motor base (blades are integral) must be rinsed/cleaned by hand *** What you need to know Blenders all do roughly the same thing – blend – but their capacity, power and how they do it vary. This means that finding the blender that’s best for you depends on what you’re most likely to use it for and how often. Blenders vs food processors If you have room for only one appliance on your worktop, and it’s between a food processor and a blender, think about the tasks you’ll need it to tackle. Food processors are geared towards chopping, slicing, mixing and whipping, as well as processing dry food, such as bread into breadcrumbs, whereas blenders are better for liquids, including batters, drinks, smoothies and soups. There may be some crossover: food processors with blender attachments, or blenders with a chopping container. However, these can lack power or not possess the same versatility as a dedicated appliance (for example, there may be only one speed on a blender attachment). What type of blender do you need? Blenders usually fit into one of three categories: Jug-style blenders are good for keen cooks and those who batch cook or make smoothie bowls, milkshakes or smoothies for a family or crowd. A full-sized jug blender is ideal for whipping up sauces, pancake batter, soups, nut butter, non-dairy milk, ice-cream, cocktails or mocktails and desserts. Personal blenders are usually smaller, with on-the-go cups. They’re best for smoothies and other drinks, with enough capacity for one or two people. Smaller households may be able to use one for most everyday blending. Most aren’t suitable for hot liquids, and they tend not to have enough capacity to blend a batch of soup. Stick blenders are best for blending directly in a pan, bowl or jug without having to transfer the contents into a full-sized blender. They’re great for speedy blending of soups, stews and desserts, but less suitable for convenient daily smoothies. How much should you spend, and what are the key features to look for? You can pick up a basic jug-style blender for as little as £25, but it may lack power. You may also find that blades and other removable parts may not last as long if it’s in use every day. Thinner plastic jugs and lids tend to be more prone to breakage, so it’s worth investing in a blender with a robust, thick plastic or glass jug if you can, and a snugly fitting lid. For a longer lifespan, clean the parts by hand rather than in the dishwasher. The combination of hot temperatures and the slightly abrasive nature of dishwasher detergents tends to wear away at parts faster than if you wash them by hand. Personal blenders tend to be cheaper, starting from £20. Affordable options can be low power, though, so check the wattage. From £50 upwards, the price is usually dictated by the number of accessories. The same goes for stick blenders: as little as £15 will buy you one, but you’ll need to spend more like £30-60 if you need a lot of power or accessories. If you’re keen to save and don’t need a box-fresh appliance, a refurbished or returned blender could be a good option. Try Amazon’s Second Chance store; direct from the retailer, such as Vitamix’s reconditioned blenders; or a specialist refurbished retailer, such as Back Market. For any refurbished appliance, check that it comes with a warranty and customer support in case of any problems (a phone number or chat facility is good; a form or email address, less so). Also, check the product is in good order before you start to use it: don’t worry about minor scratches on parts that aren’t in contact with food, but return appliances if the jug or containers have chips or cracks. Likewise, if power cables show any damage, return the item without using it. How to clean your blender There are two basic ways to clean a blender: quick or deep. Quick cleans work best straight after use. Fill the jug halfway with warm water, add a couple of drops of washing-up liquid, pop on the lid and run for about a minute (pricier blenders may have a self-cleaning program, which will time it for you). If you often blend seeds or nuts, occasionally add 50ml of white vinegar to the warm, soapy water to help remove residue. Afterwards, rinse thoroughly. The quick method doesn’t always remove debris under the blades, however. For that, you’ll need a deep clean. If you’re hand washing, equip yourself with an angled brush for scrubbing around the blades. Detachable blade units will be easier to clean, but if the blades are fixed and there’s stubborn debris, fill with warm water and washing-up liquid, and leave to soak before cleaning. Or if your blender jug is dishwasher safe, it can do a deep clean for you. No matter what method you use, blender jugs can become cloudy. To bring back the shine, mix bicarbonate of soda with enough water to make a paste, apply to the interior, leave for half an hour, then lightly scrub with a wet sponge: this should remove the film.
