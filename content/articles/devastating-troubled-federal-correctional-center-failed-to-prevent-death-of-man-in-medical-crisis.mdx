  man in medical crisis

  Private contractors at a federal detention facility delayed calling for an
  ambulance for hours during a man’s health crisis the day before he died, video
  and records obtained by the Guardian can reveal. Correctional staff pinned the
  bloody and bruised man to the floor in a medical observation cell for nearly
  four hours. James Ramirez, a federal pre-trial detainee in the custody of the
  US Marshals Service (USMS) who had been previously diagnosed with paranoid
  schizophrenia, died in a solitary confinement cell while being held at the
  Cibola county correctional center in New Mexico in February 2022. Cibola is a
  federal facility outside Albuquerque with a series of units in which people in
  the custody of the USMS and local county law enforcement, along with
  immigrants in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) custody, are detained.
  The jail is owned and operated by CoreCivic, one of the biggest private
  corrections companies in the US. After spending months researching conditions
  at Cibola, the Guardian discovered that an alarmingly high number of deaths
  have occurred at the facility in recent years. One of the fatalities was that
  of Ramirez, 28. Meanwhile, the FBI is investigating what the agency in an
  affidavit called an “epidemic” of drug smuggling at the facility, including
  allegations that some CoreCivic workers have been involved. Videos of
  Ramirez’s situation the day before he died, provided to the Guardian by an
  attorney working on a wrongful death lawsuit against CoreCivic and others,
  show a rare glimpse of a medical crisis that precedes a death inside a federal
  detention center. Cibola contracts with the Department of Homeland Security
  and the Department of Justice. Hours of video footage, hundreds of pages of
  medical examiner reports, the wrongful death lawsuit and local police reports
  obtained by the Guardian show that CoreCivic medical staff waited several
  hours before transferring Ramirez to the hospital. In video obtained and
  edited for length by the Guardian, a nurse can be heard telling Ramirez that
  staff needed his consent to take him to hospital, even though the handcuffed
  man being restrained on the floor appeared barely conscious at the time.
  Ramirez was eventually taken to the local Cibola general hospital in Grants,
  New Mexico, about an hour from Albuquerque, sedated and stitched up, according
  to multiple attorneys variously representing the family, CoreCivic and the
  hospital, as stated in court filings in the ongoing civil case in the New
  Mexico federal court. The wrongful death lawsuit alleges hospital medical
  staff reported that Ramirez had “a baseball sized lump” on his forehead as
  well as lacerations after, they were told, “repeatedly smashing face on
  concrete”. According to the complaint, one nurse assessed that the patient had
  “likely suffered a traumatic brain injury”. He was administered ketamine to be
  sedated at the hospital ahead of being scanned. However, he did not receive
  psychological or psychiatric testing or a blood test for other drugs in his
  system, according to multiple court filings. Later that same day, he was
  returned to Cibola, still sedated, according to the lawsuit, a medical
  investigator report and video footage. CoreCivic then in effect, the lawsuit
  alleges, “withdrew all chance of medical oversight and care from Mr Ramirez by
  putting him into solitary confinement, away from medical staff”. In a court
  filing, CoreCivic attorneys said the medical observation cells – where Ramirez
  had been previously held down for hours – were full. The following afternoon,
  Ramirez was found dead in the cell, with “blood everywhere”, a report by the
  local Milan police department, dated 15 February 2022 and obtained by the
  Guardian, says. Ramirez’s estate sued CoreCivic, a nurse and doctor working at
  the facility, the Cibola general hospital, and a doctor at the hospital in New
  Mexico federal court. “Defendants assumed without confirmation that Mr Ramirez
  had ingested illicit drugs, and as a result, did nothing but restrain him
  during his medical and mental health crisis,” the lawsuit alleges, adding that
  due to the defendants’ “negligent acts”, Ramirez suffered an “unnecessary,
  avoidable, and wrongful death”. By compiling hundreds of pages of official and
  legal reports, the Guardian established that, since 2018, there have been at
  least 15 detainee deaths inside the federal facility. According to the Cibola
  contract, CoreCivic staff are required to regularly check on mentally ill
  detainees, specifying that those who are demonstrating “unusual or bizarre
  behavior” should receive more frequent observation. CoreCivic is accused in
  the lawsuit of not following its own policies with Ramirez in terms of dealing
  with what the lawsuit describes as his “medical and/or mental health crisis”.
  CoreCivic said it could not respond to the specifics of Ramirez’s case due to
  the ongoing lawsuit, but stated: “At all our facilities, including the Cibola
  County Correctional Center (CCCC), the safety, health and well-being of the
  individuals entrusted to our care and our dedicated staff is our top priority.
  This commitment is shared by our government partners. Our facilities have
  trained emergency response teams who work to ensure that any individual in
  distress receives appropriate medical care, and we are deeply saddened by and
  take very seriously the passing of any individual in our care. Any death is
  immediately reported to our government partners and investigated thoroughly
  and transparently.” In court filings in the case, attorneys for CoreCivic said
  Ramirez’s death was unforeseeable and that the company denies all liability
  and allegations of wrongdoing. The other defendants similarly denied
  wrongdoing, in court filings. The hospital settled in the lawsuit and was
  unable to provide further comment to the Guardian. The lawsuit from the
  Ramirez estate alleges that medical staff at Cibola, instead of responding to
  his “acute mental and physical distress” as a reasonable healthcare provider
  would, reasoned that he had “simply ingested drugs and did not need medical
  intervention”. Ramirez was originally from California, his older sister Teresa
  Saldaña said in an interview. “Growing up, we had a really difficult
  childhood,” Saldaña said. Although Ramirez was not formally diagnosed with
  schizophrenia until later in his life, Saldaña remembers him as a teen telling
  her that he “heard the predator in his head. The predator would order him to
  do things, and if he didn’t then the predator would threaten to harm him.”
  Ramirez struggled with substance abuse, his sister suspects, and she lost
  contact with him for about 10 years. The two siblings reconnected after
  Ramirez was arrested in 2021 and detained in Cibola. “We hadn’t spoken in a
  very long time, so he was excited to speak with me,” she said. That year,
  Ramirez had allegedly robbed someone at gunpoint in Albuquerque, according to
  a criminal complaint. When local officers responded to the robbery, the
  complaint says that Ramirez opened fire. He shot and wounded four officers,
  including one seriously, and he was shot as well. He was charged with crimes
  including aggravated battery and armed robbery and, because of Ramirez’s prior
  criminal history, with “being a felon in possession of a firearm” – a federal
  crime. Ramirez was placed under USMS custody and was sent to the Cibola
  facility in 2021, while his federal case proceeded. According to court
  records, Ramirez had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia before
  entering Cibola and intake documents from the facility seen by the Guardian
  show that the staff were aware of his diagnosis. On 14 February 2022, Ramirez
  had been in solitary confinement for five days because he was suffering from
  paranoia, and CoreCivic staff observed that he was “unable to stand and [was]
  slurring his words”, the lawsuit alleges. Company lawyers in a court filing in
  the case speculate that Ramirez may have been “under the influence of drugs or
  alcohol”. He was taken to a medical observation cell on a gurney. While there,
  after being taken off the gurney and left alone, Ramirez struggled to keep
  control of his body. Whenever he tried to stand, he would collapse. He can be
  seen on surveillance video footage, shared with the Guardian, stumbling,
  slipping and reeling around the back of the cell, in between falling down and
  lying helplessly on the floor. As he repeatedly stumbled, slid from a sitting
  position or toppled over, it can be seen that his head and face slammed into
  the wall, the sink, the floor and the concrete bed platform. Before long his
  head and upper body – and parts of the cell – became covered in blood. Some
  facilities around the US have a policy of recording instances when officers
  use force on detainees. Footage, taken by staff on a handheld camera, shows
  that guards arrived and held Ramirez down to the floor in an apparent attempt
  to prevent further injury. However, they continued to do so for nearly four
  hours while, according to the lawsuit from Ramirez’s estate, and confirmed in
  the handheld video footage, the “correctional officers repeatedly called for
  medical assistance”. Facility staff cuffed his wrists at his front and applied
  a soft head brace as he was held on his back. Ramirez, with his swollen eyes
  shut, and covered in bruises and blood, can be seen in the footage
  occasionally lurching against his restraints and making incomprehensible,
  guttural sounds. He can also be made out on the footage trying to bite
  himself. After hours of the facility’s security staff pinning Ramirez to the
  floor, a CoreCivic nurse finally arrived but did not swiftly call for an
  ambulance, saying that Ramirez, who was occasionally grunting or snorting,
  needed to become “well enough” to say he gave consent to be taken to the
  hospital, to get stitched up, evaluated and treated. “If you just talk to me,
  we can get you to the hospital and fixed up real quick,” the nurse can be
  heard saying in the video, while wearing a hat that reads: “Heroes work here.”
  “They got better drugs than we do,” the nurse says in the video. The nurse is
  also named in the wrongful death lawsuit filed by Ramirez’s estate. “He was
  completely out of it. He was seizing, he was incoherent, he couldn’t talk. It
  went on for hours,” said Parrish Collins, a civil rights attorney who also
  represents prison staff whistleblowers, based in New Mexico. Collins is one of
  the attorneys representing Ramirez’s estate in the wrongful death lawsuit
  against CoreCivic et al. Almost six hours after his medical crisis began,
  Ramirez was taken to the Cibola general hospital, sedated with ketamine and
  stitched up, but not tested for drugs, court filings by attorneys representing
  CoreCivic and the doctor in question allege. Ramirez was discharged from the
  hospital hours later, “still sedated and unstable”, the lawsuit claims, and
  returned to Cibola. He can be seen on further video footage being wheeled into
  the facility on a stretcher and into a solitary confinement cell. CoreCivic
  attorneys in a court filing said the medical observation cells were full when
  Ramirez was returned to the facility. There is no footage available from
  inside the cell where he died. The following day, a CoreCivic nurse found him
  unresponsive in the cell, a court filing from a company attorney alleges. He
  was declared dead in the facility shortly after, according to court filings
  and the police and medical examiner reports in the case. When a local police
  officer arrived to investigate the death, he found Ramirez’s body “had blood
  everywhere on it and bruising”, the Milan police department officer wrote in
  the incident report to investigate the “unattended death”. The report said
  there was “heavy dark bruising” around his eyes, forehead, wrists and hands.
  And his body “was positioned on the bare floor with his arms extended next to
  his head at about a 90 degree angle, with his left foor crossed under his
  right leg [sic]”. The New Mexico office of the medical investigator conducted
  Ramirez’s autopsy to investigate his cause of death. The Guardian
  independently accessed two reports produced by the office, including a
  toxicology report and a postmortem physical examination report. The toxicology
  report documented various drugs in his system, including ketamine, the
  antidepressant mirtazapine and lorazepam, a medication for seizures and
  anxiety. Some of those drugs, including the schizophrenia medication Haldol,
  the lorazepam and the ketamine, had been administered by the hospital, court
  records say. The defendants’ filings speculate that Ramirez was under the
  influence of drugs and smelled of alcohol when he was originally taken to the
  medical observation cell at Cibola. The postmortem exam documented “blunt
  trauma” on Ramirez’s face and head, swelling, cuts, a fractured nose, and
  bleeding from his scalp and neck. That report said the cause of death was
  “undetermined”. The wrongful death lawsuit from the Ramirez estate is still
  ongoing in a federal New Mexico court. Lawyers representing the hospital told
  the Guardian they had reached a settlement in the case and had no further
  comment. Lawyers representing the doctor who treated Ramirez at the hospital,
  before his death, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. In a
  statement, the USMS said the agency “does not own or operate detention
  facilities but partners with state and local governments using
  intergovernmental agreements to house prisoners. Additionally, the agency
  houses prisoners in Federal Bureau of Prisons facilities and private detention
  facilities. “The USMS ensures appropriate reviews are conducted annually on
  all non-federal detention facilities, and corrective action plans are
  implemented, as necessary,” the USMS statement said. “The USMS conducted a
  review of the Cibola County Correctional Center in June 2025.” The USMS did
  not provide further information when asked about the findings of this year’s
  review of the facility. Ramirez’s family struggled with his death, including
  the uncertainty of what exactly took place during his time in Cibola. “It was
  devastating, it was upsetting. This whole situation has been very emotional
  for me,” said Saldaña, his sister. “I had to go on medical leave. I couldn’t
  sleep for more than an hour a night. And this went on for about a year.” The
  jarring video of Ramirez’s last day alive is one of the worst things Collins,
  the attorney representing the Ramirez estate, has seen, he said, even with
  years of experience litigating such issues. Echoing the claims in the wrongful
  death suit, Collins said: “It’s pretty damn clear what killed him – it’s the
  lack of medical care,” adding that Ramirez’s death “was perfectly preventable
  – and they didn’t prevent it”.
