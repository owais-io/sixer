  The Gone 9pm, BBC Two “We believe no connection exists between recent events
  and the Goat Man killings.” In the first season of this crime drama, Theo
  Richter (Richard Flood), an Irish detective in New Zealand, teamed up with a
  Māori counterpart, Diana Huia (Acushla-Tara Kupe), to solve the case of a
  missing Irish couple. As the show returns, two people are on trial for murder.
  But Theo can’t leave just yet – an Irish journalist, Aileen Ryan (Carolyn
  Bracken), is missing. As they look for her, the town speculates over the
  historical “mountain murders” that were never solved. Hollie Richardson
  Dragons’ Den 8pm, BBC One Can luxury skincare ever come with an affordable
  price tag? One entrepreneur reckons she knows enough about beauty to make it
  happen. Other ideas being pitched: a virtual present‑giving app and T-shirts
  for neurodivergent people. HR Saving Lives at Sea 8pm, BBC Two Another series
  of the lifeboat rescue show – starting with a 4.50am response call to a small
  boat crossing the Channel, followed quickly by news of a vessel capsizing with
  20 people in it. Meanwhile, in Northumberland, two fishers have gone missing.
  HR Tom Kerridge Cooks Spain 8.30pm, ITV1 The latest leg of a tasty road trip
  is dedicated to bounty from Spanish trees, starting in Valencia, where there
  are new varieties of citrus fruits to try. Then the chef pootles on to Elche,
  to a farm that has produced figs since Roman times – and where they still pick
  the fruit using the same centuries-old techniques. Jack Seale Queen Victoria:
  Secret Marriage, Secret Child? 9pm, Channel 4 Hurrah for Rob Rinder, resuming
  his history teacher beat. This time, he is working with the historian Dr Fern
  Riddell, who has a theory that Queen Victoria may have had a child with her
  Highland servant John Brown after Albert’s death. The show follows four years
  of her research, which utilises archives that have not been seen for 160
  years. HR Mr Bigstuff 9pm, Sky Max The comedy that won Danny Dyer a Bafta
  roars on. The reunited brothers Lee (Dyer) and Glen (the series’ creator, Ryan
  Sampson) continue searching for their long‑lost father. It’s all about the
  digressions, though, which this week take Glen on a tour of gay cruising
  haunts in his new role as a romantic fixer: “If you want a bit of saveloy,
  you’ve got to get amongst it!” JS
