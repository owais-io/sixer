  The German double Olympic biathlon champion Laura Dahlmeier has died after a
  mountaineering accident in Pakistan, her management confirmed on Wednesday.
  The accident occurred at around noon on Monday, at an altitude of
  approximately 5,700 metres at Laila Peak, the Alpine Club of Pakistan said.
  Dahlmeier was climbing with her mountaineering partner when she was struck by
  a sudden rockfall in the Hushe Valley, part of the northern Gilgit-Baltistan
  region. “Laura Dahlmeier died on 28 July in a mountain accident on Laila Peak
  (6,069 metres) in Pakistan’s Karakoram range,” her representatives told
  Germany’s Die Welt newspaper. “A recovery operation was launched but
  ultimately called off on the evening of 29 July.” Dahlmeier’s representatives
  added that she most likely died instantly, while her mountaineering partner
  was unharmed and remained at the site. Poor weather conditions have prevented
  a rescue helicopter from reaching the location. “It was Laura Dahlmeier’s
  express and written will that in a case like this, no one should risk their
  life to recover her,” they said. “It was her wish to leave her body behind on
  the mountain in this case. This is also in line with the wishes of her
  relatives.” The 31-year-old Dahlmeier was an experienced mountaineer. She had
  been in the Gilgit-Baltistan region since the end of June and had already
  ascended the Great Trango Tower. Dahlmeier, who was born in the Bavarian ski
  town of Garmisch-Partenkirchen, was also honoured by the premier of her home
  state, Markus Söder. “Laura epitomised her native Bavaria in the best sense of
  the word: she was ambitious and successful, yet always remained humble and
  close to her homeland,” he said in a statement. “Even after her active career,
  she shared her love of sport as a winter sports expert, member of the mountain
  rescue service and ski guide,” Söder added. Dahlmeier retired from biathlon in
  2019, at 25 years old, a year after becoming the first female biathlete to
  achieve a sprint and pursuit double at the same Olympics, winning two golds
  and individual bronze at the Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea. “Laura
  made history at the Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics as the first female
  biathlete to win sprint and pursuit gold at the same Games edition. She will
  be remembered forever,” said the president of the International Olympic
  Committee, Kirsty Coventry. The German Olympic Sports Confederation said: “She
  was more than an Olympic champion – she was someone with heart, attitude and
  vision.”
