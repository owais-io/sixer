  On Saturday, the people of Paüls will celebrate the feast of their patron
  saint, Sant Roc, with a mass, followed by a communal meal eaten at stone
  tables, jota folk dances and a profound and lingering sense of relief. Last
  month’s wildfire – which turned the night skies a hellish orange, blackened
  the surrounding hills and devoured 3,300 hectares (8,154 acres) of land – was
  a near-disaster that stirred memories of the 2009 blaze in nearby Horta de
  Sant Joan that killed five firefighters. “People were afraid that everything
  would burn and that they’d lose everything,” says Enric Adell, the mayor of
  the small Catalan mountain town. “They were scared of getting trapped and not
  being able to get out of the village.” The fear of a fire like that, he adds,
  is unlike any other kind of fear. “We’ve been through a pandemic and a
  nationwide power cut and torrential rains, but a fire on this scale was
  something else – as was the aftermath,” says Adell. In the hills above the
  village square, the charred trees are a reminder of what could have happened
  without the bravery of hundreds of firefighters, one of whom, Antonio Serrano,
  lost his life. Changing winds and sheer luck also played a part. “When a fire
  hits,” says the mayor, “it really leaves its mark.” This summer’s fires have
  already left their mark across the length and breadth of Spain, from Galicia
  and Castilla y León in the north-west to Catalonia in the north-east, from the
  smart suburbs outside Madrid to Extremadura in the south-west, and all the way
  down to the beaches of Tarifa in Andalucía. As well as panic and the
  increasingly familiar tang of smoke, this year’s fires have brought with them
  a sense of deja vu. The hot, deadly summer of 2022 yielded images that laid
  bare Spain’s huge vulnerability as the effects of the climate emergency became
  increasingly plain. Footage that went around the world that July showed Ángel
  Martín, a 53-year-old man from Tábara in Castilla y León, using one of his
  excavators to try to stop the fires in the Sierra de la Culebra reaching the
  town. In the video, the machine is engulfed by the flames before Martín runs
  out of the inferno, the clothes burning off his frame. Martín, a much-loved
  figure in Tábara, suffered burns to 80% of his body and died in hospital three
  months later. Three years on, Spain is once again on the defensive. “The fires
  are one of the parts of the impact of that climate change, which is why we
  have to do all we can when it comes to prevention,” the country’s environment
  minister, Sara Aagesen, told Cadena Ser radio this week. “Our country is
  especially vulnerable to climate change. We have resources now but, given that
  the scientific evidence and the general expectation point to it having an ever
  greater impact, we need to work to reinforce and professionalise those
  resources.” On the climate emergency frontline As politicians engage in blame
  games, experts warn, once again, that all the bickering over the number of
  water-dumping planes misses the point. The current spate of fires, they add,
  was entirely predictable and underlines the need for a fundamental rethink of
  land use and management in a continent that is on the frontline of the climate
  emergency. “This year’s fires are basically on the same level as those we saw
  in 2022 and 2023,” says Marc Castellnou, the head of forestry for the Catalan
  regional fire department and a fire analyst at the University of Lleida.
  “Since 2017, we’ve seen this change towards more extreme fires … It’s nothing
  new – and it’s happening because climate change is bringing higher
  temperatures for much longer periods.” The dynamics are not hard to discern.
  If you have annual heatwaves that arrive one after the other – and last longer
  and longer – in a country where decades of rural depopulation have left huge
  areas of land untended, overgrown or given over to homogenous cultivation,
  then you will have massive fires that are getting harder to fight. As one
  Spanish scientist noted earlier this week: “We have all the ingredients for
  the molotov cocktail we’re seeing right now.” Cristina Montiel, a professor at
  Madrid’s Complutense University and an expert in forest fires and land use,
  says that while Spain’s firefighters and other emergency services are doing an
  “extraordinarily magnificent” job that is keeping far greater disasters at
  bay, the problem lies with society as a whole. Despite the annual fires and
  the abundance of evidence, she says, “it turns out that we are not – and we do
  not want to be – aware of the danger in which we’re living”. If we were even a
  little aware, she adds, “we would take the measures and decisions to protect
  ourselves”. Fifty years ago, says Montiel, most forest fires were intentional.
  But today’s forest fires are increasingly caused by accidents or negligence
  and are spreading so voraciously because of two factors: landscape change and
  climate change. It is an explosive combination. This year’s heavy spring rains
  led to an increase in plant growth that has now been dried out by successive
  heatwaves, leaving all that combustible vegetation, much of it in neglected
  areas, ready to serve as fuel for the fires. The situation is further
  complicated by the phenomenon of “flash droughts”, which can quickly dry out
  even well-irrigated agricultural land, and which are likely to become more
  common as global heating continues. Paüls is a case in point. Its population
  has dwindled over the decades and fewer and fewer people in the area work the
  land because of the shrinking economic rewards. “If there were 100 people
  working the land before, now there are 30,” says Adell. “If the same policies
  continue and things remain as hard as they are, then in a few years, there’ll
  be almost no one.” All those years of abandonment had left ravines, gullies
  and pine forests overgrown and made them into temperature-activated timebombs.
  Last month’s fire, says the mayor, was simply uncontrollable: “We saw that
  there was no way of stopping it.” If there is much truth in the idea that
  preparation is all – and in the old maxim that “fires are put out in winter” –
  the challenge now lies in undoing decades of neglect and bad planning that
  have seen the landscape forgotten and the appearance of housing developments
  in hazardous places. But Montiel cautions that the much-needed rethink will be
  neither quick nor easy. “If things took a turn for the worse 50 years ago, we
  can now start changing them for the better,” she says. “But you can’t think
  that starting to change things now will pay off within two summers because
  that isn’t true. These things are processes.” ‘Fire Flocks’ of sheep and goats
  There are, however, already some signs that the message is getting through.
  After the Horta de Sant Joan fire 16 years ago, a group of shepherds
  approached the Catalan fire department to ask what they could do to prevent
  more blazes. The result was the Ramats de Foc (Fire Flocks) scheme, in which
  shepherds coordinate with firefighters to graze flocks of sheep and goats in
  areas with a high density of undergrowth and therefore high risk of fire. In
  areas cleared by the ruminants, firefighters have better access and, as there
  is less undergrowth, it is also easier to bring fires under control should
  they break out. “We don’t need more helicopters or firefighters,” says Marc
  Arcarons, who coordinates the initiative, which was launched in Girona in 2017
  under the aegis of the not-for-profit Pau Costa Foundation. “We could buy 200
  more helicopters and it won’t solve the problem. It’s all about prevention and
  management.” The scheme also helps shepherds increase their existing incomes
  as those who participate can sell their meat or cheese at a premium as
  certified Ramats de Foc, so consumers know the produce is contributing to the
  preservation of the environment and the survival of traditional agriculture.
  About 120 shepherds have joined the project, which covers about 8,000 hectares
  (20,000 acres) in Catalonia. Similar schemes are planned or under way in the
  Canary Islands and Andalucía. Arcarons says that depopulation – and decreasing
  dependence on woodlands for building material and grazing since the 1960s –
  has caused what was once a patchwork of vineyards, olive groves and wheat
  fields to revert to dense forest. Fast-growing and highly flammable pines
  dominated, undergrowth flourished and this, combined with climate change and
  more frequent and longer periods of drought, has led to fires that are
  extremely difficult to control. “It’s like a chimney,” says Arcarons. “If you
  keep throwing wood on the fire eventually the chimney will catch fire and the
  house will burn down.” Castellnou agrees that without adapting our landscapes
  to the realities of climate breakdown, we are sealing our fate. “There’s no
  point talking about more aeroplanes,” he says. “If we limit our capacity for
  extinguishing fires by thinking we just need enough equipment to put them out
  then we’re creating an unsustainable, artificial situation for summer after
  summer of extreme weather.”
