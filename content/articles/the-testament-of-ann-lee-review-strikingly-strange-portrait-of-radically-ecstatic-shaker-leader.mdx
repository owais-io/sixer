  The Testament of Ann Lee review – strikingly strange portrait of radically
  ecstatic Shaker leader

  ‘Our ordeal is worth it!” This is the cry of one of the faithful in Mona
  Fastvold’s movie, co-written with her partner Brady Corbet, with whom she
  co-wrote The Brutalist. It is a vehement, fervent, striking but sometimes
  baffling drama about the historical figure of Ann Lee, who endured religious
  persecution in 18th-century England as leader of the fundamentalist Shaker
  movement. As the embodiment of Christ’s second coming, Lee took her radical
  message to the New World and in pre-revolutionary America founded an enduring
  community of souls, persecuted all over again by the new patriarchy for being
  a woman and a pacifist. Her Shakers were known among other things for their
  skill in stylishly elegant and minimalist furniture – although the connection
  with Christ’s profession is unstressed. Lee is played by Amanda Seyfried, with
  Lewis Pullman as her brother William and Christopher Abbott as her oppressive
  husband Abraham, who appears to be partial to a bit of BDSM where he gets to
  be a Christian dom in the marriage bed. The movie looks sometimes like a Lars
  von Trier nightmare of ironised martyrdom, or a Robert Eggers horror film like
  The Witch, and then sometimes like a weird but spectacular Broadway musical
  melodrama, in which the shaking and shivering of the dancing faithful –
  ecstatically submitting to divine joy – is shaped into a choreography not
  unlike the musical Stomp. Atheists and rationalists in the audience might be
  tempted to ask … well … what is the testament of Ann Lee exactly? What is her
  message, her legacy for the 21st century? The answer would appear to be simply
  this: she established a Christian sect. (Some statistics about follower
  numbers are given over the closing credits.) Lee fiercely believed that all
  sex was wrong, and a wicked distraction from the spiritual. No follower in
  this film is so disloyal as to ask how then is humanity to be saved from dying
  out? Is it simply a matter of letting people outside the faith keep humanity
  going with their deplorable activities and the resulting children can be
  brought into the fold? And the shaking, the shivering, the speaking in
  tongues, to a modern audience, this will obviously look like collective
  hysteria and sexual repression, but the film cannot exactly bring itself to
  endorse this obvious diagnosis, because it wants us to take Lee seriously at
  some level. Yet Fastvold is arguably justified in wanting to show that this
  sexual repression generated enough redirected energy to take a religious group
  all the way from Manchester to colonial New York, and to make a real
  contribution to the new enlightenment and the debate over liberty. Lee shouts
  “Shame!” at a slave auction in this New World of liberty for white people,
  though it doesn’t occur to her to make abolitionism part of her Christian
  mission. This is a genuinely strange film, elusive in both tone and meaning,
  one which deploys the obvious effects and rhetorical forms of irony, while at
  the same time distancing itself from these effects and asking its audience to
  sympathise and even admire Lee, because she is not supposed to be the villain.
  Fastvold is perhaps asking her audience to take whatever elements from the
  film they find congenial. An enigmatic ritual that is not for everyone. • The
  Testament of Ann Lee screened at the Venice film festival.
