  As a child in Leicestershire in the 1940s, Biddy Baxter was a devoted reader
  of the work of Enid Blyton. She sent the creator of Noddy and The Famous Five
  a fan letter and was so delighted to receive an answer that she replied with
  follow-up questions. To her dismay, the response was identical to the first.
  This sense of being let down by an adulated adult proved formative. When
  Baxter, who has died aged 92, was in charge of Blue Peter, the long-running
  children’s show that she essentially created, she introduced an alphabetical
  card index – that most efficient pre-digital database – to ensure that viewers
  received personalised replies. That innovation reflected the gentle side of
  her professional persona. Some presenters on the show complained of a darker
  side – domineering, dictatorial – but, if true, that editorial insistence
  reflected the extraordinary extent to which she was Blue Peter and Blue Peter
  was her. It has been rare in the history of broadcasting for one person to
  mould and own a programme for so long. For 26 years (23 of them as editor) at
  Blue Peter, she was keeper of the flame and anyone seen as threatening its
  glow – staff, senior management, TV critics – was at risk of being burned.
  Baxter’s forcefulness may also have reflected the tactics required of a
  relatively rare powerful woman at the BBC in her time. The corporation was
  initially less male than many vintage British institutions – Lord Reith, the
  first director general, appointed three female heads of department in the
  1920s – but the balance had shifted by the time Baxter joined in 1955. (As
  late as 1985, an internal report found that the male-female balance in senior
  positions was 159 to six.) Tellingly, when Baxter informed the careers
  department at Durham University that she sought a BBC career, she was steered
  towards secretarial or receptionist posts rather than the production jobs she
  envisaged. First employed as a studio manager in radio, she soon graduated to
  producing before, in 1962, being given a temporary transfer to TV due to a
  staffing crisis. (Something similar happened to David Attenborough,
  underlining the extent to which TV, in its early decades, was an accidental,
  undervalued medium.) When Baxter was given a permanent Blue Peter contract in
  November 1962, the programme (created by John Hunter Blair) had been running
  for four years. She made it into one of the most distinctive and significant
  broadcast brands, changing her own life and those of tens of millions of
  British children across many generations. Baxter introduced or popularised all
  the most celebrated elements – the Blue Peter badge for viewer achievement;
  the pets (most notably, the mongrel Petra and the border collie Shep); the
  presenters’ summer holiday to film reports in a foreign location; and the
  “makes”, in which a doll’s house or a fort was created from everyday family
  refuse such as cereal packets and washing-up liquid bottles. As a
  perfectionist, Baxter was irritated that the most attention resulted from
  things going wrong – a girl guides’ campfire threatening to burn down the
  studio, or Lulu the baby elephant copiously urinating and defecating before
  treading on the foot of the presenter John Noakes and dragging her zoo keeper
  through the mess. Although from a generation raised on the wireless, Baxter
  (like Attenborough) had an instinctive understanding of how television could
  and should work. The catchphrase associated with the makes, “Here’s one I made
  earlier,” as the presenter pulled a complete model from under the table, was a
  practical solution to the time constraints of a 15-minute programme (later
  lengthened to 25 minutes) now routinely used by craft and cookery shows.
  Another link phrase, “And now for something completely different” (later
  satirised by Monty Python), originated in the sudden jumps of subject that
  were a feature of the series. Baxter’s reputation inside and outside the BBC
  for tetchiness partly resulted from her fierce defence of Blue Peter’s legacy.
  Baxter was infuriated by claims that there had been two Petras (the second
  substituted when the first one died) and that she had sacked the presenter
  Christopher Trace in 1967 for getting divorced and Michael Sundin in 1985 for
  being gay. Baxter always insisted that the two hosts were shown the door for
  being difficult with the crew or unpopular with viewers, and that before Petra
  an unnamed puppy had died of distemper. The concept of the presenters being a
  big brother or sister to the viewers (the target age was six to 14) meant they
  were replaced as they aged. By 1988 it seemed anomalous to some that a
  55-year-old was editing the leading BBC children’s show and it was perhaps
  convenient to both sides that Baxter resigned when her husband, the musical
  educationist John Hosier, took a job in Hong Kong. However, on returning to
  the UK she was tapped as an adviser to director generals for her sharp TV
  brain. The increasing marginalisation of Blue Peter due to technological
  trends – it is now screened weekly on a niche channel – was painful to her in
  later life. Strikingly, at a time when TV was considered disposable even
  within the industry – few shows were archived due to the cost and space of
  doing so – Baxter understood the significance of what she was doing, insisting
  on every show from the mid-60s onward being recorded. It was a declaration
  that Blue Peter mattered and, largely thanks to her, it did.
