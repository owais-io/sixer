  UTS academics describe ‘culture of fear’ as enrolments put on hold for nearly
  a fifth of courses

  Academics at the University of Technology Sydney have described feelings of
  stress and a “culture of fear” after the educational institution temporarily
  paused student enrolments for nearly a fifth of its courses, leaving staff
  wondering if their jobs will be among the hundreds set to be axed. The
  university has stopped taking in new students for 120 of its 615 courses,
  including masters degrees in teaching primary and secondary education. More
  than 50 of the affected courses were international study options attached to
  other degrees. The pause will last until the end of the autumn 2026 semester.
  The freeze comes as the university pursues $100m in cost cuts. In April, UTS
  told its staff that 150 academics and 250 operational employees could lose
  their jobs, or about a tenth of the workforce. The faculty of society and
  design took the biggest hit, followed by the faculty of health, while the
  science, engineering, business, law and transdisciplinary faculties also each
  saw courses cut and nine majors have been suspended. UTS said in a statement
  that current students would not be affected and sought to allay fears over job
  losses. UTS’s vice-chancellor, Andrew Parfitt, told staff in an email on
  Thursday that the suspensions would not necessarily mean changes to their
  employment and no decision had been made to permanently cut the courses
  affected by the freeze. Sign up: AU Breaking News email But an academic staff
  member in the international studies program, who did not want to be named out
  of fear of repercussions, said: “That’s not how that’s being interpreted by
  staff.” The staff member added: “If it’s our courses that have been paused …
  those job cuts will lie within our programs.” Parfitt’s email to staff said
  courses chosen for suspension had been put forward by their faculties and
  received low student enrolments. A quarter of the suspended courses had no
  enrolments but the majority had at least 25 students, a UTS spokesperson said.
  The international studies staff member said that employees were not only
  devastated but also confused over the numbers, and argued that some degrees
  affected, such as those in education and public health, were socially
  valuable. “UTS is saying that it’s no longer going to train primary or
  secondary teachers during what’s effectively also a teacher shortage,” the
  staff member said. “There’s also a deep sadness, if you speak to people,
  because the way this is being done is kind of framed in corporate speak, [not]
  the language of what a public university should be doing in Australia.” Some
  staff felt physically ill and others left work early after learning of the
  course suspensions, said Dr Sarah Attfield, the UTS branch president for the
  National Tertiary Education Union. “People are feeling just absolutely
  horrified and gutted, because it was out of the blue,” she said. UTS still has
  not specified which jobs will be made redundant since its April announcement.
  It said in a statement to the Guardian that it was unable to progress with
  releasing details of its proposed changes as it is still in a Fair Work
  Commission dispute with the National Tertiary Education Union over the
  restructure. “We understand that many staff are feeling anxious and are eager
  to review the details of the change proposal,” a UTS spokesperson said in the
  statement, adding “we remain hopeful that we will be able to resolve the
  dispute and release those proposals to staff soon”. UTS is one of several
  Australian universities that has announced cuts to jobs and courses in the
  last 12 months as the sector struggles with declining revenue. Documents
  released under freedom of information laws show UTS has agreed to pay KPMG
  nearly $5m in fees for advice on the restructure, which has further raised
  staff ire, according to Dr Hossai Gul, a UTS lecturer. “External consultants
  are being paid millions to make recommendations about our operations when our
  own staff [can] identify issues and solve them collaboratively,” she said.
  “[It] undermines our mission, damages trust, and creates a culture of fear.”
