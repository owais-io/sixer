  parenthood wrong?

  Some things you know without being told. Kids reached peak summer holiday
  boredom last week – on 12 August to be precise – according to a survey. If
  you’re a parent you may have laughed hollowly there, in the unlikely event you
  still have enough energy. Exhausted and bankrupt after standing in endless
  queues for more wholesome activities, we’ve started Cinema Club, which is
  totally different from just watching a film on the sofa, in ways I’ll explain,
  er, later. I was excited to share a particular childhood favourite of mine
  with my son, who turned 11 a fortnight ago, although this can be a risky
  business (ooh, is he too young to watch Risky Business?). Showing your
  offspring movies you remember fondly but haven’t seen in decades is often
  disappointing. Sometimes, they are so slow to get going that everyone loses
  interest, and many have aged astonishingly badly and are now problematic, to
  put it lightly. Luckily, the 1988 body-swap comedy Big was a hit straight away
  – fast paced, funny and poignant. The giant piano dance routine completely
  holds up. The only issue? A sex scene I’d forgotten. The protagonist has an
  adult form but is really 13 years old, and that wasn’t even why it was awful.
  I recall the excruciating experience of enduring these kind of TV moments with
  my mum and dad all too well. How two onscreen minutes could feel as if they
  lasted roughly nine millennia. Cheeks burning, buttocks clenched, dying
  inside. I’d never considered if it was as embarrassing for them as for me,
  which I now presume it must have been because boy-oh-boy did that part of Big
  go on for ever. Oddly, it felt exactly the same as it did back then, despite
  being on the other side, the grownup. Being a parent is different now; 40 is
  the new 30, so we feel younger than our parents did at this age. The only
  involvement my parents had in the music I was listening to was yelling, “Turn
  it down!” up the stairs. However, my son and I share a love of the pop star
  Lola Young. I’m not sure if that’s OK, for a few reasons. There are clean
  mixes of her songs, but you have to ask Spotify, or whatever you’re using, for
  them specifically, or you’re treated to lyrics that make you long for the
  comparatively tame lovemaking of Tom Hanks. But worse than the awkward
  conversations some of the spicy versions have provoked is the uncomfortable
  feeling all is not right with the world. The title of Young’s second album,
  released last year, is a bit too on the nose: This Wasn’t Meant For You
  Anyway. Maybe she has a point. I’m not sure if my kid and I are allowed to
  like the same things, if I should be disapproving rather than singing along.
  Have the times a-changed or am I doing parenthood wrong? The traditional role
  of the parent here is to be terminally uncool and not get it. To suspect that
  the Beatles are bad influences because of their hairstyles, to get outraged
  over Madonna’s antics. Not to be vogueing around the kitchen in a conical bra,
  like the ‘I’m not a regular mom, I’m a cool mom’ from Mean Girls. It isn’t
  just Young, I am also a huge fan of YouTuber Ryan Trahan. My kid and I learned
  the viral Charli xcx Apple dance together (not to post on social media, I
  hasten to add). My husband is a dab hand at Mario Kart on the Nintendo Switch
  and they race regularly. These are not pastimes we grin and bear, like
  watching Frozen again, or the lengthy train obsession that meant we spent most
  weekends standing on cold platforms, waving our blue hands at drivers as they
  passed by. This is all of us genuinely enjoying what we’re doing, nobody
  faking it or making any kind of sacrifice. It goes the other way too – our
  boy’s first proper late nights were due to the wait for the next episode of
  The Traitors being unbearable. He accidentally overheard a podcast I love, Dax
  Shepard’s Armchair Expert, and now listens every week with me on purpose. And
  recently he joined us down a Sean Hayes wormhole that culminated in a Will
  &amp; Grace marathon in which he demonstrated admirable stamina. Maybe the
  secret is not to question it. Perhaps this is actually the sweet spot. The
  teenage years are fast approaching, in about five minutes, us thinking that
  anything is good will probably be the kiss of death. I can only pray, when
  that dark day comes, I get custody of Lola Young.
