  What is the role of journalism when Palestinian reporters are treated as
  criminals and left to die? Last October, I spoke with the journalist Hossam
  Shabat. He described families packing what little they had left in northern
  Gaza as Israel began implementing its “generals’ plan”. Six months later,
  Shabat was dead – killed by Israel, accused of being a Hamas operative. Israel
  does not try to hide these killings. Instead, it often smears its victims in
  advance – branding journalists as “terrorists”, accusations that are rarely
  substantiated. These labels serve a clear cause: to strip reporters of their
  civilian status and make their killing appear morally acceptable. Journalists
  are not legitimate targets. Killing them is a war crime. The latest round
  shook the world: five Al Jazeera journalists were assassinated in a press tent
  in Gaza City, among them Anas al-Sharif, whose face had become familiar to
  anyone following Gaza up close. Both the UN and the Committee to Protect
  Journalists (CPJ) had warned that al-Sharif’s life was in danger. Weeks later,
  he was dead. Meanwhile, a growing consensus recognises Gaza as the site of a
  livestreamed genocide. Yet in Germany – a country that prides itself on having
  learned the lessons of its own genocidal history – some of the most powerful
  media institutions have played a part in enabling Israel’s actions. Some
  German journalists have even justified the killing of their Palestinian
  colleagues. The clearest example is Axel Springer, Europe’s largest publisher
  and owner of Bild, Germany’s biggest newspaper. Hours after the killing of
  al-Sharif became public, Bild splashed his image under this headline:
  “Terrorist disguised as journalist killed in Gaza” (which was later changed to
  “Journalist killed was allegedly a terrorist”). Let that sink in. About a week
  before, Bild had published another piece: “This Gaza photographer stages Hamas
  propaganda.” The article targeted the Palestinian photographer Anas Zayed
  Fteiha, accusing him of staging images of starving Palestinians as part of a
  Hamas campaign, despite the evidence that the subjects of the photos were
  indeed starving and waiting for food. In the article, Fteiha’s title as
  journalist appeared in quotation marks, implying he wasn’t a real journalist,
  and that images of starvation were exaggerated fabrications. The Bild story –
  along with a piece in the liberal Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) that had asked
  experts “How real are the images from Gaza?”– was swiftly amplified on X by
  Israel’s foreign ministry, which cited them as proof that Hamas manipulates
  global opinion. Fteiha was branded an “Israel- and Jew-hater” serving Hamas.
  The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation quickly piled on, joined by rightwing
  influencers. In this case, German media had become a direct pipeline for
  Israeli talking points, quickly recycled into the international arena and
  repackaged as “evidence”. Fteiha said in response: “I don’t create suffering.
  I document it.” Calling his work “Hamas propaganda”, he continued, “is a
  felony against the press itself”. Just days before the Bild and SZ articles
  were published, one of Germany’s largest journalists’ associations, Deutscher
  Journalisten-Verband (DJV), issued a statement warning of “manipulation” in
  press photography. It specifically cast doubt on images showing emaciated
  children in Gaza, claiming their condition “apparently is not attributable to
  the famine in Gaza”. The DJV offered no evidence for this claim – largely
  because no such evidence exists. Facing backlash online, the association cited
  a July article in Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, whose author had speculated
  whether images of emaciated infants were really the result of starvation – or
  rather of preexisting conditions such as cystic fibrosis. The piece suggested
  that publications had been either negligent or manipulative in publishing
  these photos without further detail. Omitted was the fact that hunger and
  preexisting conditions can’t be neatly separated and that no preexisting
  condition alone could produce such extreme emaciation. Bias isn’t new in the
  German media landscape. At Axel Springer, support for the existence of the
  state of Israel is second on the list of the company’s guiding principles, its
  so-called essentials. In September last year, Bild helped derail ceasefire
  negotiations by publishing an “exclusive” report – excerpts from a Hamas
  strategy leaked to Bild by Benjamin Netanyahu’s aides. In it, Bild claimed
  Hamas was “not aiming for a quick end to the war”, which neatly absolved
  Netanyahu of any responsibility for the breakdown in talks at the time. (In
  response to queries about the story, a Bild spokesperson told +972 magazine
  that the publication does not comment on its sources.) As it turned out, the
  Hamas document had been broadly misrepresented by Bild. The timing couldn’t
  have served Netanyahu better: the story landed as mass protests put pressure
  on his position. Shortly after the Bild report was published, Netanyahu cited
  it in a cabinet meeting to cast the demonstrators as pawns of Hamas. The Bild
  article remains online, uncorrected. The problem, however, extends far beyond
  Bild and Axel Springer. Across legacy German media, failures to provide
  fact-based, balanced coverage of Israel and Palestine have been far reaching –
  and became glaringly obvious after the 7 October attacks. Fabricated claims,
  such as that Hamas had beheaded 40 babies, along with various other pieces of
  deliberate misinformation, remain uncorrected. Outlets across the political
  spectrum in Germany routinely omit historical context, frame Palestinian
  deaths in passive, depoliticised terms, and display a near-blind faith in
  Israeli military “verification” – while ignoring a well-documented record of
  misinformation by Israeli state sources. Questioning the work of Palestinian
  journalists is not confined to Axel Springer’s outlets, either. In January,
  the ostensibly leftwing Die Tageszeitung ran a piece headlined: “Can
  journalists be terrorists?” While it did quote statements from the Palestinian
  Journalists’ Syndicate and Al-Quds Today (a television channel affiliated with
  Palestinian Islamic Jihad), it cited the Israeli military four times and did
  not carry comment from a single journalist in Gaza. Across the German media
  landscape, such narratives contribute to stripping Palestinian journalists of
  credibility, and – in the worst case – handing Israel readymade justifications
  for targeting them. Germany’s “never again” pledge should carry weight given
  its deeply genocidal history. Yet it rings hollow when the country’s dominant
  outlets launder or supply propaganda to legitimise mass killing in Gaza. This
  is not journalism in the service of truth – it is journalism in the service of
  violence. Breaking this cycle would require a serious reckoning with the
  editorial cultures and political loyalties that have enabled German journalism
  to be weaponised in this way. The killing of journalists in Gaza makes one
  thing painfully clear: Israel does not want a record to be left. When the
  history of this genocide is written, there will be chapters on the media’s
  role. Germany’s section will be uncomfortably large. No one should claim they
  didn’t see it happening. Hanno Hauenstein is a Berlin-based journalist and
  author. He worked as a senior editor in Berliner Zeitung’s culture department,

  Tageszeitung to reinstate context that was lost in the editing process and to
