  The male gaze is often talked of as a passive thing: a point of view,
  influencing the subconscious choices of film-makers, rather than an active
  agenda. Not so in I See You Watching. Here, the male view – in particular the
  male view of women – is insistent, demanding, explicit. Playing a figure of
  authoritarian power, actor David Calvitto barks out commands: he wants his
  women to be pretty, demure, sluttish, compliant, hard-working, domestic,
  worldly, Madonna and whore. He could be running an audition with a keen eye
  for what the market demands or, more likely, he could be articulating base
  male desires. And because he is patrolling the auditorium when he issues these
  instructions, he is on our side, physically if not politically. Objectified on
  the other side of the footlights is Kylie Westerbeck, playing a wannabe star
  in spangly majorette gear, clumsily tossing a baton and dancing with ugly
  enthusiasm. Calvitto wonders if she could be better. Eager to please,
  ambitious to succeed, she does her best to obey his contradictory commands.
  She is fashioned in his image and has no resources to argue back. Conditioned
  from infancy, she has no thought for herself beyond the empty allure of
  Hollywood fame. Devised by Westerbeck with director Melanie Stewart and writer
  John Clancy for Blind Faith Theatre, I See You Watching is an extended riff on
  a simple idea. The more relentlessly it delves, the more it outlines a
  spectrum of subjugation: at one end, a woman laughs politely at a man’s
  unfunny jokes; at the other, a child is farmed out to a pornographer. The
  production makes its point but, for all the charisma of Westerbeck and
  Calvitto, it makes it bluntly, hammering home a message in a way that is
  uncomfortable and unnerving even if it should not come as too much of a
  surprise. • At Gilded Balloon, Edinburgh, until 24 August • All our Edinburgh
  festival reviews
