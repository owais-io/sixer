  Across the US’s fabled but overstretched national parks, unusual scenes are
  playing out this summer following budget cuts by Donald Trump’s
  administration. Archeologists are staffing ticket booths, ecologists are
  covering visitor centers and the superintendents of parks are even cleaning
  the toilets. The National Park Service (NPS), responsible for maintaining
  cherished wildernesses and sites of cultural importance from Yellowstone to
  the Statue of Liberty, has lost a quarter of its permanent staff since Trump
  took office in January, with the administration seeking to gut the service’s
  budget by a third. But the administration has also ordered parks to remain
  open and accessible to the public, meaning the NPS has had to scramble
  remaining staff into public-facing roles to maintain appearances to the crowds
  of visitors. This has meant much of the behind-the-scenes work to protect
  endangered species, battle invasive plants, fix crumbling infrastructure or
  plan for the future needs of the US’s trove of natural wonders has been
  jettisoned. “It’s nearly impossible to do the leadership role expected of me,”
  said one superintendent who heads a park in the western US who didn’t want to
  be named for fear of retribution from the administration. “I’m doing
  everything now. That means I regularly have to make sure the doors are open, I
  have to run the visitor center, I have to clean the bathrooms. I’d say I’m
  cleaning the bathroom on a weekly basis now because there’s no one else to do
  it.” This sort of triage situation is occurring across the 433 sites and 85m
  acres – including 63 national parks and an array of battlefields, monuments
  and cultural sites – that make up the national park system in the US, multiple
  current and former NPS staff have told the Guardian, risking long-term
  degradation of prized parks. “It’s frustrating to realize you can’t execute
  your talents to be the best steward of these public resources because we are
  just trying to keep the parks open. We are just in survival mode,” said the
  park superintendent, who added that they are considering leaving the NPS;
  under Trump, more than 100 park superintendents have already departed the
  service. “For the public, it’s hard to understand. People will say: ‘Why would
  you mess with national parks? They were doing just fine, they are America’s
  best idea. Why would you mess with them?’” In one of his first actions as
  president, Trump slashed the NPS workforce by 1,000 people, an action known as
  the “Valentine’s Day massacre” at the agency, as part of a broader effort to
  shrink the federal workforce. Thousands of others have left the park service
  since this cull via early retirements or resignations, while some of those who
  remain have organized as “resistance rangers”, even launching an anonymous
  podcast. Doug Burgum, Trump’s secretary of the interior, has said that the
  agency can be slimmed down while still maintaining services such as
  campgrounds, bathrooms and visitor centers. “I want more people in the parks,
  whether they’re driving a snowplow in the wintertime or whether they’re
  working with [an] interpreter in the summertime or they’re doing trail work,”
  Burgum told a Senate hearing in June. “I want more of that. I want less
  overhead.” But even as staff are pressed into frontline roles, gaps are
  appearing that critics say can endanger safety. All 13 lifeguard positions are
  vacant at the Assateague Island national seashore in Maryland and Virginia,
  according to advocacy group the National Parks Conservation Association
  (NPCA), a site where a man drowned last week. Understaffing encompasses more
  than 50 vacancies including senior leadership roles across three national park
  sites in Boston, the loss of 60 staff from regional NPS offices in Alaska and
  the departure of half of all employees from the Big Bend national park in
  Texas, according to the NPCA. A history center at Yosemite was forced to close
  after several artifacts were stolen, a symptom of low staffing, according to
  the association. It said about 4,000 staff have left in total, nearly a
  quarter of the total NPS workforce, with potential further cuts if the
  administration pushes ahead with mass firings, called a reduction in force.
  “Some parks have lost as much as a third of their staff and it’s difficult or
  impossible to keep frontline visitor services when that happens,” said John
  Garder, a senior director at NPCA. Garder said some parks have shortened
  visitor center hours, with long lines at entrance gates and cuts to tasks that
  mostly occur out of sight from tourists, such as law enforcement,
  archeological and ecological work. “This is not sustainable in the short term
  and certainly not in the long term as visitors start to notice the lack of
  maintenance and work on landscapes,” Garder said. “What is important to
  visitors is healthy ecosystems and cultural landscapes, whereas this
  administration sees these places more like theme parks than national parks.
  It’s a Potemkin village scenario where the public can’t see things falling
  apart behind the scenes.” One current NPS employee who works at Yosemite said
  that law enforcement is now so overstretched that “people can wreck the park
  with no consequence” and that visitors are doing potentially dangerous things
  such as not properly storing their food. “That’s an issue because we have
  bears here and we don’t want bears eating people food because they can get
  aggressive,” the staffer said. “I worry the park will degrade to the point
  where safety is a problem. I don’t think visitors notice yet but they will
  soon. We are all doing jobs outside the scope of our roles. People are
  stepping up to fill the gaps but everyone is on the fast track to burnout.”
  The Trump administration has imposed a hiring freeze upon the NPS but has
  allowed for nearly 8,000 seasonal hires, although barely half of this total
  has been achieved before the summer peak. Last year, a record 331m visits were
  made to national parks – a record – and a new high mark may be reached again
  in 2025. “We’ve successfully hired thousands of seasonals and in most parks,
  staffing is on par with last year,” an NPS spokesperson said. “As in other
  years, we are working hard to make it another great year for visitors. Our
  employees are hard-working, experienced problem-solvers and it’s not unusual
  for them to adapt to changing conditions.” “It’s not unusual or unique to this
  year for national park employees to work around obstacles to ensure we provide
  memorable experiences,” the spokesperson added about the superintendent
  cleaning toilets. “Rangers have always worn multiple hats.” The spokesperson
  added that lifeguard shortages such as at Assateague “are a nationwide concern
  even outside of our public lands” and said it was important for people to
  understand the risks of riptides. A focus on seasonal roles and public-facing
  positions threatens to reorient national parks to being mere facades for
  tourists rather than sustainable, ecologically rich places connected to local
  communities, some park staff warned. “Keeping these iconic places open is an
  ongoing process of protection, preservation and maintenance and it’s scary and
  chilling to think about that being eliminated along with future planning,”
  said Marisa, who was an NPS employee of a regional support office until last
  month and did not want to give her full name. “The push is to keep up this
  facade for visitors that things are normal but that’s not the case. There’s a
  targeting of the functions that sustain the agency.” National parks, widely
  beloved by the American public and long seen as a rare bastion of
  bipartisanship in a fractured country, have also been dragged into the culture
  wars by the Trump administration. Signs have been erected in each of the parks
  asking visitors to report any materials that are “negative about either past
  or living Americans or that fail to emphasize the beauty, grandeur and
  abundance of landscapes and other natural features”. The NPS will be reviewing
  signage from this public feedback and targeting “interpretive materials that
  disproportionately emphasize negative aspects of US history or historical
  figures”, an agency spokesperson said. However, park staff have said many of
  the responses, sent via a QR code on the signs, suggest the public is
  reluctant to scrub away uncomfortable truths such as the US’s legacy of
  slavery or mistreatment of tribal people. “Are we such weak, fragile people
  that we can’t view the full length and breadth of our history?” reads one of
  the responses from a visitor to Muir Woods, California, and seen by the
  Guardian. “Are we so afraid that we have to hide factual history from the
  telling of our past? Oh, please!!” Further, albeit milder, pushback is coming
  from Congress. While the White House’s suggested budget for next year demands
  a 30% cut in NPS funding, a reduction that would decimate many of the agency’s
  core functions, Republicans in Congress have been more circumspect, drafting
  proposals that would trim the budget by far less. “There is deep concern among
  the public about what’s happening to our national parks,” Garder said. “There
  is concern in Congress, too, although more needs to be done to restore
  staffing levels and prevent the selloff of federal land.” But even if further
  steep cuts are averted and parks cope with this summer’s crush of visitors,
  lasting damage may have already been inflicted upon America’s best idea. “This
  is not a normal situation,” said Kevin Heatley, who resigned as superintendent
  of Oregon’s Crater Lake national park in June due to staff losses. “This is a
  paradigm shift that is having repercussions that will last for at least a
  generation.”
