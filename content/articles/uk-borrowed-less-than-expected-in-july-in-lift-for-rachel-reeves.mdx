  The UK government borrowed less than expected in July, official figures show,
  in a boost to the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, as she faces pressure in the
  run-up to her autumn budget. Figures from the Office for National Statistics
  (ONS) showed public sector net borrowing – the difference between public
  spending and income – fell to £1.1bn, down by £2.3bn from the same month a
  year earlier. The reading was below City predictions for a deficit of £2.6bn
  and forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) of £2.1bn.
  Borrowing over the first four months of the financial year so far was £60bn.
  While matching the OBR’s forecasts, it was £6.7bn higher than in the same
  period a year earlier, and the third highest April-to-July borrowing since
  monthly records began. However, the OBR said the current budget deficit – the
  key figure for meeting the chancellor’s self-imposed fiscal rule – was £42.8bn
  over the first four months, which is £5.7bn above its forecast. Despite the
  better-than-expected July figure, economists said the chancellor would still
  face a tough autumn budget because the OBR was likely to slash its growth
  forecasts for the UK economy, while Labour’s series of welfare U-turns before
  the summer would add to borrowing. Alex Kerr, a UK economist at the
  consultancy Capital Economics, said Reeves would probably need to raise
  between £17bn and £27bn to maintain headroom of £9.9bn against her fiscal
  rules. “Ultimately, today’s release does little to brighten the gloomy outlook
  ahead of the budget later this year,” he said. Ministers are understood to be
  exploring options to raise more money from inheritances and property taxation,
  the Guardian has revealed. Earlier this month the National Institute of
  Economic and Social Research thinktank warned the shortfall in the public
  finances could reach more than £40bn. Martin Beck, the chief economist at WPI
  Strategy, said the latest figures would offer Reeves some relief. “Talk of a
  huge ‘black hole’ in the public finances is looking overstated, but the
  outlook is still uncomfortably tight,” he said. Highlighting the resilience of
  the economy, separate figures on Thursday showed a rise in private sector
  business activity in August to the highest level in a year. The latest
  snapshot from the S&amp;P Global purchasing managers’ index, which is closely
  tracked by the Bank of England, showed resilience in the services sector of
  the economy helped the pace of economic growth to continue accelerating over
  the summer after a sluggish spring. The PMI rose to 53, up from 51.5 in July,
  the highest level since August 2024, on a scale where 50 separates growth from
  contraction. However, Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at
  S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said confidence among businesses remained
  “uneven and fragile”. He said: “Companies report concerns over the impact of
  recent government policy changes, as well as unease emanating from broader
  geopolitical uncertainty. Goods exports are still falling especially sharply.”
  The ONS said the better-than-expected monthly borrowing figure reflected
  “strong increases” in tax receipts after Reeves’s increase in employer
  national insurance contributions (NICs), introduced in April. For the
  financial year so far, compulsory social contributions were £9.5bn higher than
  in the same period a year earlier. The OBR said the tax take from employer
  NICs was up 24% in July from a year earlier. Overall receipts were 0.2% below
  its forecast for the first four months of the financial year. The UK’s public
  finances are typically in a strong position in July, owing to a key payment
  deadline for self-assessed income tax. However, government spending also rose
  sharply, as public sector pay rises and inflation-linked benefit payments
  raised running costs. Debt interest also increased as higher inflation pushed
  up the cost of servicing the UK national debt. The ONS said public sector net
  debt was estimated at 96.1% of GDP, among the highest levels since the 1960s.
  Economists warned rising inflation could add to the pressure on the public
  finances. Official figures on Wednesday showed the headline rate rose by more
  than expected to 3.8% in July, driven by rising food prices and companies
  passing on the cost of tax increases to consumers. Darren Jones, the chief
  secretary to the Treasury, said: “Far too much taxpayer money is spent on
  interest payments for the longstanding national debt. “That’s why we’re
  driving down government borrowing over the course of the parliament – so
  working people don’t have to foot the bill and we can invest in better
  schools, hospitals, and services for working families.”
