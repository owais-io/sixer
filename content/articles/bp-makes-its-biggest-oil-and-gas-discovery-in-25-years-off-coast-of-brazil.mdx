  BP has made its largest oil and gas discovery of the past 25 years off the
  coast of Brazil as it continues to shift its focus away from renewables and
  back to fossil fuels. The Santos basin oil and gas discovery, which is located
  in deep waters, is the company’s 10th oil discovery of the year and could be
  its largest since its discovery at the Shah Deniz gasfield in Azerbaijan in
  1999. BP is carrying out further tests on the Santos discovery, made beneath
  about 2,400 metres of water and 250 miles (400km) off the Brazilian coast, to
  gauge the potential of the oil and gas basin. It is likely to play a
  significant role in the company’s plan to increase its oil and gas production
  to between 2.3m to 2.5m barrels of oil equivalent a day. The company said on
  Monday it had also started a new oil extension project in the Gulf of Mexico
  that should add an extra 20,000 barrels a day to its production. The Argos
  project would be the first in a series of new projects in the Gulf between now
  and the end of the decade. BP has returned its focus to fossil fuels in recent
  years after abandoning its failed plan to cut its hydrocarbon production,
  which had favoured expanding in low-carbon energy alternatives, such as
  offshore wind. Gordon Birrell, the head of BP’s oil and gas production
  business, said the discovery was “another success in what has been an
  exceptional year so far” which had underscored the company’s “commitment to
  growing our upstream” oil and gas production. He added that Brazil was an
  important country for BP, which will explore the potential of establishing “a
  material and advantaged production hub in the country”. The Santos basin,
  which is in coastal waters off Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, is BP’s second
  discovery in Brazil this year. The group has also announced oil and gas
  discoveries in Trinidad, Egypt, the Gulf of Mexico, Libya, Namibia and Angola,
  in a marked retreat from its former green agenda. The company’s plan to become
  a “net zero” energy company has faced a string of unforeseen hurdles since it
  was put in motion in early 2020. The Covid-19 pandemic triggered one of its
  worst financial results – a $5.7bn loss for 2020 – since it reported a $4.9bn
  loss for 2010 following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. In 2022, it was
  forced to take a $25bn hit after offloading its stake in the Russian oil
  company Rosneft after the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine. While the company
  invested heavily in the offshore wind industry, which has suffered increasing
  costs in recent years, its rivals were able to exploit the surge in fossil
  fuel prices after the Russian invasion by pumping more oil and gas. BP, which
  announces its half-year results on Tuesday, said last month that it would sell
  its share in 10 US onshore windfarms to the New York-headquartered LS Power.
  On Monday it launched its 50:50 offshore wind joint venture with the Japanese
  wind company Jera worth up to £4.5bn, which it plans to use to gain some
  access to zero-carbon wind energy developments while focusing on fossil fuels.
  Amid BP’s floundering net zero strategy, its former chief executive Bernard
  Looney was sacked from the company for failing to disclose to the board his
  relationships with his staff. BP’s flagging share price has raised concerns
  that it could become prey for a larger rival intent on a takeover. Shell has
  been forced to deny its reported interest in buying BP. BP has also emerged as
  a target for the New York hedge fund Elliott Management. The activist investor
  amassed a 5% stake in the company and has been agitating for a strategy
  overhaul of the company, including sweeping changes to the board. Last month
  BP appointed a successor to its embattled chair, Helge Lund. Albert Manifold,
  the former boss of the building material company CRH, will join the BP board
  on 1 September as a non-executive director and as chair-elect, before taking
  over on 1 October. The announcement of BP’s important oil discovery took place
  a day after the Opec oil group and its allies said they would again boost
  output. The Opec+ group agreed on Sunday to raise production by 547,000
  barrels a day for September, the latest in a series of accelerated increases
  to regain market share. The move means Opec+ has now fully reversed its
  largest tranche of output cuts, made as oil demand slumped after the Covid-19
  pandemic. The oil price was down 2% on Monday, with Brent at just over $68 a
  barrel.
