  “We have teenagers coming in asking to get Leah Williamson printed on the back
  of their football shirt, and then we have women in their 40s getting their
  first ever fitting for a sports bra,” says Style Of Our Own (SOOO) London
  founder Laura Youngson. She’s speaking about the new hub dedicated to women’s
  sport that opened its doors in June. “You just don’t know how it’s going to be
  received until people start walking through the door, so seeing how women are
  interacting with the space is just amazing,” she adds. The immersive pop-up
  venue on Regent Street, which was provided by The Crown Estate, is a hub for
  women’s sport merchandise, kit and equipment, featuring a three-a-side
  football pitch, dedicated spaces for events and workshops, and screens to
  watch all the biggest moments of an electric summer of sport. Youngson says a
  space like this – in which women’s sport is the primary focus, rather than a
  hastily tacked-on afterthought – is long overdue: “Some of this stuff seems so
  obvious in hindsight,” she says. “Even if you use just a few examples from the
  last couple of years, like the Women’s Euros packing out huge stadiums, or the
  huge number of tickets that have been sold for the Rugby World Cup in
  September, or Mary Earp’s jersey selling out in record time. These things tell
  us that a space like this should already exist.” For football enthusiast
  Youngson, the journey from concept to reality has been both a test of
  endurance and a race against the clock. She says she didn’t even have a space
  until mid-March, she only got the keys to 245 Regent Street on 1 May, and its
  doors opened to the public just over a month later on 5 June. “It has been a
  phenomenally fast turnaround to build the space, but it really shows the
  agility of women’s sport,” she says. “It’s already an incredible store, but
  it’s also changing every week. The more we learn, the more we are changing, we
  are constantly speaking to consumers and tweaking things. It has been really
  rewarding to roll into it with that entrepreneurial mindset of – ‘it’s never
  done, it’s never perfect, but we’ve started, and now we’re making it better.’”
  Selected from more than 1,000 applicants for Westminster city council’s
  Meanwhile On project – which grants access to prominent retail space alongside
  rate relief, store design budgets and retail consultancy – SOOO was brought to
  life with the help of Mastercard, providing support with funding and
  marketing, which Youngson says was invaluable. “Mastercard agreed to power the
  whole thing,” she says. “They supported us with the fit-out and making this a
  reality. And honestly, we couldn’t have done it without them. Their commitment
  to supporting women in sport, especially in the rugby space, is fantastic.”
  Youngson’s background is firmly rooted in gender equality in sport. In 2017,
  she led a group of women to the top of Kilimanjaro to play a record-breaking
  high-altitude football match with Equal Playing Field, a grassroots initiative
  to challenge gender inequality in sport. Three years later, she launched Ida
  Sports, a sports company that creates football boots specially engineered for
  women’s bodies. “Women generally have differently shaped feet,” says Youngson.
  “We tend to have narrow heels, higher arches, and a wider toe box. So when we
  are wearing shoes made for men, it begins to create all these problems.” In
  fact, research in 2023 found that more than 80% of female players at top
  European clubs suffer regular discomfort because of their boots, and incorrect
  footwear has also been linked to an increased risk of serious ACL injuries.
  “We changed the shape of the shoe to be more comfy, and the next thing we did
  was look at performance,” says Youngson. “Women’s hips are farther apart, so
  how we interact with the ground is different. So we changed the outsole and
  the stud configuration of our boots in order to better work for the female
  body.” Beyond the innovative science that powers their shoes, IDA also offers
  women a wide range of choice in terms of design, colour and style. Female
  athletes – from the top flights right down to the weekend warriors – are used
  to walking into sports shops and sometimes not even being able to find the
  women’s sport section. “I remember walking into so many stores and seeing
  men’s, kid’s, and that’s it,” says Youngson. “I would have to ask if they had
  women’s boots and then they would look at me like I was crazy.” For Youngson,
  providing choice is about more than having fun colourways to pick from, it’s
  about validation and finally feeling seen. “It’s so important to feel like you
  matter, and that you have value as a player,” she adds. “The industry approach
  traditionally has been ‘shrink it and pink it’, but we have been listening to
  female consumers and designing for what they actually want.” Branching out
  into the retail space feels like a natural progression for Youngson. Her ethos
  is community-driven and the aim with SOOO is to foster a sense of belonging
  for women and girls. This comes through in the details of the venue, from the
  intimates area – offering sports bra fittings and a space to learn about
  leak-proof period underwear – to community watch parties, to one of Youngson’s
  favourite features: the miniature indoor pitch shoppers can use for a casual
  kickabout, or to test out their new gear. “There’s a big thing about boys
  dominating the space on football pitches, and how that presence can be
  intimidating and offputting for girls,” she says. “At SOOO I wanted girls and
  women to feel that they were not only welcome, but invited.” Youngson has
  already seen the impact of this sense of inclusion: “People walk in and they
  breathe out with this sense of relief,” she says. “It’s like they’ve found
  their home.” SOOO has already attracted the likes of Mo Farah (with his
  teenage daughters in tow), and Serena Williams’s husband Alexis Ohanian made
  an impromptu visit during Wimbledon. For Youngson, celebrity endorsement is
  encouraging and exciting, but it’s the grassroots element of the women’s sport
  ecosystem that she cares about the most. “Ultimately, it is a place to
  inspire, and to get inspired,” she says. “A place to try something new and a
  place to find your people.” You can find SOOO London at 245 Regents Street,
  open until October
