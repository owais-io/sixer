  Sweden’s former national security adviser has gone on trial for the allegedly
  negligent handling of classified information, seven months after he resigned
  amid revelations he had left official documents in a hotel. Henrik Landerholm,
  a longstanding friend of the Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, appeared
  on Monday in front of a packed gallery at Attunda district court in
  Sollentuna, north of Stockholm. His trial is expected to centre on the events
  of March 2023 when Landerholm is alleged to have left documents in an unlocked
  safe at a hotel conference venue. Much of the proceedings will be held behind
  closed doors due to the information said to be contained in the documents. One
  of the witnesses, a member of the military, will reportedly be questioned
  under a codename during the three-day trial. Witnesses are also expected to
  include staff at Gällöfsta Kursgård, a conference centre north of Stockholm
  where the documents were left. Landerholm told the court on Monday there was
  “no excuse” for the incident in the Gallofsta, adding: “It was unfortunate and
  inappropriate. It is now up to the court to decide if it was a crime.”
  According to the newspaper Dagens Nyheter, the papers were found by cleaning
  staff. At least one was about Sweden’s Turkey strategy when it was still
  waiting to join Nato and a secret meeting with the US, the newspaper reported.
  Landerholm did not respond to DN’s request for comment on the content of the
  documents. A government spokesperson said: “We will not go into the content of
  the forgotten documents.” The revelation was not the first to befall
  Landerholm, who had been appointed to the role in autumn 2022. He left a
  notebook behind at the Swedish national broadcaster Sveriges Radio after an
  interview in January 2023, and left his phone – reportedly overnight – at the
  Hungarian embassy after a dinner at the end of 2022. Landerholm announced his
  resignation in January after police opened an investigation into the hotel
  incident. “I have been informed that a preliminary investigation has been
  opened into the incident with the documents forgotten at the hotel conference
  centre,” Landerholm said at the time. “I have informed the prime minister of
  this and we have agreed that under the circumstances I can no longer fulfil my
  work obligations and that is why I’m leaving my position as national security
  adviser.” Landerholm was charged with negligence with classified information
  in March 2025, and if found guilty he could be fined or imprisoned for up to
  one year. He denies any wrongdoing. His lawyer, Johan Eriksson, has said the
  information did not pose a risk to national security in the way that
  prosecutors have claimed and that Landerholm’s actions did not constitute a
  crime. Prosecutors said in their motion: “When we say sensitive information,
  the court will soon understand exactly what we mean and that the expression
  does not contain any exaggerations.”
