  Politicians dress up for Midwinter Ball In case you missed it, Canberra’s
  Midwinter Ball was held last night giving the pollies (and press gallery) the
  chance to dress up. Attendees included, of course, prime minister Anthony
  Albanese and his partner, Jodie Haydon, seen here arriving for the festivities
  at Parliament House. And the opposition leader, Sussan Ley, and her fellow
  female Liberal MPs. And you can see many more pictures from the night at our
  gallery here: Australian cricketer Usman Khawaja will today meet the prime
  minister to discuss gambling ads, before a roundtable discussion with public
  health experts and doctors. Khawaja, who will also speak to Anthony Albanese
  about the war in Gaza, has been critical of the close association between
  sport and the wagering industry, given the potential for social harm. Khawaja
  will also attend the roundtable discussion with crossbenchers David Pocock and
  Kate Chaney, the Australian Medical Association, the Australian Institute,
  public health expert Samantha Thomas and people with lived experience of
  gambling harm. The group is calling on the federal government to adopt the
  recommendations of a parliamentary inquiry led by the late Labor MP Peta
  Murphy, which called for a ban on gambling ads and inducements, among many
  other changes. Earlier this week, when asked why it had taken more than two
  years to respond to the inquiry, Albanese told parliament the government was
  mindful “of whether people just go offshore” to continue gambling. Offshore
  gambling service are banned in Australia and not subject to consumer
  protections. Thomas, who will deliver a short speech at the event, said that
  argument should not delay reforms. Despite industry rhetoric, there is limited
  independent evidence to suggest that ad bans would lead to a mass exodus to
  illegal markets. Independent analysis also shows that we don’t need gambling
  ads to protect free-to-air television and big media brands. If we are to move
  forward in Australia, we must also disrupt industry influence over policy.
  Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I’m Martin Farrer with the top
  overnight stories and then Krishani Dhanji will be along to take you through
  the day. Australia’s international education market is stagnating, according
  to a new report, with the blame being directed at a “stringent policy
  environment” and higher visa fees that are deterring students from enrolling.
  More coming up. The cricketer Usman Khawaja meets the prime minister today to
  discuss gambling ads before a roundtable discussion with crossbenchers David
  Pocock and Kate Chaney, doctors and public health experts. Khawaja will also
  raise the situation in Gaza with Anthony Albanese. More coming up.
