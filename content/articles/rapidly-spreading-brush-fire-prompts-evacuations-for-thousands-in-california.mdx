  Hundreds of firefighters and first responders are working to contain a rapidly
  growing brush fire in a mountainous area of southern California that has
  forced thousands of evacuations. The Canyon fire erupted in a rural, sparsely
  populated area of Ventura county on Thursday afternoon and quickly exploded in
  size, spreading east into Los Angeles county. By 3pm on Friday afternoon, the
  blaze was 25% contained but covered nearly 5,400 acres (21.9 sq km) ,
  according to authorities. But fire conditions remain precarious, with
  temperatures up to 100F and low humidity. Moisture-levels on the brush-covered
  hillsides are at a record low in the region, and the parched vegetation has
  fueled the fire’s spread. “The fire has now crossed into LA county and
  continues to spread east toward the community of Val Verde,”, according to a
  1pm update on Friday from the California Department of Forestry and Fire
  Protection (Cal Fire). Firefighters battled through the night to protect homes
  and other buildings, and to take advantage of lower temperatures. By Friday
  morning, they were seeing subdued fire behavior according to Andrew Dowd,
  spokesperson for the Ventura county fire department. “They were putting it all
  on the line to bring this fire under control,” he said. One firefighter
  reported a minor injury, but no civilian injuries were reported. No
  single-family or multi-family residences were destroyed, but two minor
  structures were destroyed. “Air attack and ground crews aggressively attacked
  the fire to limit its spread and protect residents and structures in the
  fire’s path,” Los Angeles county officials wrote in an incident update issued
  on Friday, adding that hard work and operational efficiency stopped widespread
  damage “even as the high heat and dry conditions pushed the fire’s growth”.
  Firefighters are hoping to corral some of the perimeter on Friday, even with
  scorching daytime temperates that could contribute to extreme fire behavior.
  The blaze remains a “very dynamic situation”, Dowd said. “Extreme heat and low
  humidity in our north county have created dangerous conditions where flames
  can spread with alarming speed,” the LA county supervisor Kathryn Barger, who
  represents the district, said in a statement. “If first responders tell you to
  leave, go – without hesitation.” The new blaze comes as a huge wildfire in
  central California became the state’s largest blaze of the year, threatening
  hundreds of homes and burning out of control in the Los Padres national
  forest. The Gifford fire had spread to more than 99,200 acres (400 sq km) by
  Friday morning and was at 15% containment. It grew out of at least four
  smaller fires that erupted last Friday along State Route 166, forcing closures
  in both directions east of Santa Maria, a city of about 110,000 people. It has
  injured at least four people. The causes of the fires are under investigation.
  Wildfire risk will be elevated through the weekend across much of inland
  California as a heatwave gripping the area intensifies. But fire activity
  across California and parts of the American west is also expected to spike in
  the weeks to come as high temperatures collide with the strong winds that are
  more prevalent in the autumn months. “In southern California, the threat is
  driven by persistent drought, high grass loads, and weakening coastal
  moisture,” according to a wildfire forecast by the state’s fire department.
  Vegetation is already dangerously dry in the state, especially in southern
  California where thick brush and desiccated shrubs can quickly turn ignitions
  into infernos, and the coming heat will bake more moisture out of the
  landscapes. Fires will be more challenging to control and are expected to
  exhibit extreme behavior, according to an advisory issued from federal fire
  analysts this week, which said the mountains and deserts of southern
  California were seeing “record dry levels”. The Associated Press contributed
