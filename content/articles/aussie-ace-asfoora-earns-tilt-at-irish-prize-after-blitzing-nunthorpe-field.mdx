  The third time was the charm for the Australian-trained sprinter Asfoora as
  Henry Dwyer’s mare took the Group One Nunthorpe Stakes, the feature on day
  three of the Ebor Festival, after near-misses at Royal Ascot and Glorious
  Goodwood. “It’d be a bad night to be a beer in York, I’d reckon,” Dwyer told
  ITV Racing, before heading to the winner’s enclosure to kick off the
  celebrations. Oisin Murphy enjoyed a perfect trip on the 11-1 shot, as he was
  able to slipstream Night Raider, the early pacesetter, through the first
  three-and-a-half furlongs and then quicken into a decisive lead when Danny
  Tudhope’s mount drifted right a furlong out. But while it was very much Plan A
  from the rider’s point of view, the dedication required to get Asfoora spot-on
  for this high-speed dash down the Knavesmire should not be underestimated. Her
  attempt to win the King Charles III Stakes at Royal Ascot in June for the
  second year running had ended in valiant defeat, while Asfoora was still not
  quite at her peak for the King George Stakes at Goodwood in August. Yet Dwyer
  and Chenelle Ellis, Asfoora’s groom, work rider and near-constant companion
  since their arrival in Britain in May, retained full faith in her ability.
  “Last year we had it easy in the sense that we had so much time over here
  before going to Ascot,” Ellis said. “This year has been a little bit harder
  given that we were only here two weeks before Ascot. She’s just taken a bit
  longer to come to hand, but I knew after Goodwood that she was going very
  well. “I’ve been looking after her since she arrived, I’m here until she goes
  home and I’m just happy to be here. I said after galloping on Tuesday morning
  that I don’t think they’re going to beat her, and she deserves it more than
  anything.” Asfoora could now extend her time in the northern hemisphere with a
  trip to Ireland for the Flying Five on Irish Champions Weekend next month,
  while Declan Carroll, who took the Gimcrack Stakes with Lifeplan, also has
  Group One ambitions for his winner on the Friday card. Carroll’s 40-horse
  Yorkshire stable had the ante-post favourite for the Gimcrack back in 2017 in
  Santry, only to lose the promising colt in a gallops accident a few days
  before the race. Eight years on, Lifeplan gave the trainer a first-ever win at
  Group Two level, and the son of Kodi Bear is now around the 8-1 mark for the
  Group One Middle Park Stakes at Newmarket next month. “I thought it was a
  stiff task after just winning a novice to come into a Group Two, but he’s very
  streetwise,” Carroll said. “He could be a Guineas horse, I guess, he’s in the
  Middle Park and that may be his next step, but I’d want a bit of ease in the
  ground.” Majestic Warrior primed for Ebor Willie Mullins, the champion trainer
  over jumps from his base in County Carlow, has become a major player too in
  the big staying handicaps on the Flat and holds a strong hand in Saturday’s
  Ebor Handicap at York with the first two names in the betting. Hipop De Loire,
  the 7-2 favourite, has unfinished business on the Knavesmire after getting no
  luck in running on the way to a fifth-place finish when fancied for this race
  last year. He is 4lb higher in the weights this time around, however, after
  what was ultimately a four-and-a-half-length defeat, while Mullins’s Ethical
  Diamond, the 6-1 second pick, landed a 12-furlong handicap at Royal Ascot last
  time out, but is up 8lb in the weights as a result. Two lightly raced
  five-year-olds, Majestic Warrior and Shadow Dance, make more appeal, and at
  the likely prices, Majestic Warrior (3.35) could be a big each-way runner at
  around 16-1. James Tate’s runner has just four races in the book having missed
  last season, but he looked a long way ahead of his mark when successful on his
  only outing this term back in April. He is 9lb higher today on 98 but has the
  potential to be much better than that in time. York 1.50 This step up from
  handicaps to Group Three company will demand some additional improvement but
  Gladius has progressed by the race so far this season, and does not have much
  to find with the market leaders. Goodwood 2.05 Two potential improvers, Mudbir
  and Back In Black, head the market but the former has the widest draw, while
  James Fanshawe’s colt has done his winning on more conventional tracks. That
  leaves course-specialist Rhoscolyn, with a 40% strike rate here, as the value
  option at around 6-1. York 2.25 Tarriance was better than the bare result at
  Sandown last time, showing a good attitude to lead again close home after
  taking a bump, and can find the necessary improvement to win again off a 4lb
  higher mark. Goodwood 2.40 Three-year-old Prince Of The Seas is the blank
  canvas in the race and a sure-fire favourite, but the ratings suggest that
  odds-on quotes are too short, and course-and-distance winner Crystal Flyer,
  who is two-from-three here, makes more appeal at around 6-1. York 3.00
  Classic-winning Rosallion is the class act but this drop back to seven
  furlongs is a concern and Never So Brave, who made a smooth transition from
  handicaps to Pattern races in the Summer Mile here last month, has less to
  find than odds of around 11-4 would suggest. York 4.10 Pocklington was a big
  eye-catcher in a competitive handicap over track-and-trip last month, running
  on to finish three-quarters of a length behind the winner after struggling for
  room. He is still low-mileage after seven starts and off the same mark here.
