  Good morning. All eyes have been on China this week as the second biggest
  global economy flexed its muscles. Dozens of world leaders, including from the
  global south, authoritarian pariah states and the EU, attended China’s largest
  ever military parade on Wednesday to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of
  the second world war, which China calls the war of resistance against Japanese
  aggression. China’s president, Xi Jinping, was flanked by the Russian and
  North Korean leaders, Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un, in what has widely been
  called a show of defiance to the west. It is the first time all three leaders
  – who were chatting and shaking hands as they walked the red carpet in
  Tiananmen Square – have been seen together. The others in attendance included
  Belarus president Aleksandr Lukashenko, Iran’s Masoud Pezeshkian, and Myanmar
  junta chief Min Aung Hlaing. It was a highly choreographed display of power
  from the emerging (emerged?) global superpower, with a formidable guest list
  that was designed to send a message to the rest of the world. But what was
  that message? How does Xi hope to reshape geopolitics, and what will a more
  confident China mean for global human rights? I spoke to Amy Hawkins, the
  Guardian’s senior China correspondent, to find out. That’s after the
  headlines. Five big stories UK news | Deputy PM Angela Rayner has admitted she
  underpaid stamp duty on her £800,000 seaside flat, after coming under intense
  pressure to be more transparent about her property arrangements. Russia |
  Vladimir Putin has invited Kim Jong-un to visit Russia during a lengthy
  meeting in Beijing on the sidelines of China’s biggest military parade, as Kim
  promised to do “everything I can to assist” Moscow. Police | The Metropolitan
  police have declined to drop their investigation into the comedy writer Graham
  Linehan for tweets about trans issues, and said that the law used by officers
  to detain him needs reviewing. Israel | Israeli drones dropped four grenades
  near UN peacekeepers in south Lebanon, the agency’s force said on Wednesday,
  in what it described as “one of the most serious attacks” on its personnel
  since a November ceasefire. Portugal | A day of national mourning has been
  declared in Portugal after at least 15 people were killed when Lisbon’s
  well-known Gloria funicular railway car derailed and crashed on Wednesday. In
  depth: China’s display of might China’s massive display of military hardware
  and personnel was the culmination of a week of diplomatic grandstanding. The
  weekend before the military parade, dozens of leaders had descended on
  Tianjin, in northern China, for the annual summit of the Shanghai Cooperation
  Organisation. Amy Hawkins told me that when the annual summit first started in
  the 1990s, it included China, Russia, and several central Asian countries. “It
  has since expanded to 10 members and several more partner countries. It now
  also includes India and other Eurasian countries, central Asia, and other
  non-western, largely autocratic countries. The grouping represents nearly half
  of the world’s population and positions itself as an alternative to US-led
  multilateral organisations.” During the summit, Xi Jinping announced plans to
  accelerate the creation of a development bank and set up an international
  platform for energy cooperation, in partnership with Russia and India. The
  summit was Indian prime minister Narendra Modi’s first visit to China in seven
  years. Leaders from the US such as Donald Trump (more on him in a bit),
  western Europe, Japan, South Korea, and other major democracies were not in
  attendance at the summit or the military parade. “Instead, you had the leaders
  of Russia, North Korea, Iran, Myanmar, Indonesia, Zimbabwe, and other global
  south countries. It showed a united front from these anti-western or anti-US
  countries. It was a display of might and getting behind China’s vision,” Amy
  said. *** Reshaping the global order The US is seen as the undisputed global
  superpower, but China has, in recent years, been on its tail vying for the top
  position. What would a world dominated by China’s political, military and
  economic might look like? Amy explained China has no real interest in
  replacing America as the world’s police because it conceives of the global
  order differently from the US. “China’s principle is that it doesn’t get
  involved in other countries’ affairs, but whether that’s actually the case in
  reality is debatable. China has always said they respect other country’s
  sovereignty. It rejects the idea of universal values. And that’s obviously
  very appealing to smaller and often autocratic countries who don’t want to be
  told what to do by the US, and don’t want to be criticised for their human
  rights records,” Amy said. “It is more that China wants to reshape the global
  order in a way that’s suitable for its aims both domestically and abroad.”
  While China says it rejects the idea of a so-called “new cold war” with the
  US, the week’s summit and parade show a real hardening of a China-led bloc of
  largely authoritarian, anti-western leaders, Amy said. “This week really
  showed the pull of Beijing’s power and signalled its aim of reshaping the
  global order.” Many analysts specifically focused on the show of a united
  force between Xi, Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un. “It’s the first time the
  three have been seen in public together. China has always had a close
  relationship with Russia and North Korea, but in the past year or so, Russia
  and North Korea have independently become closer and they’ve signed a mutual
  defence treaty. North Korea has sent thousands of troops to help Russia during
  its war in Ukraine, and has sent weapons,” Amy said. “And as Russia and North
  Korea become closer, there was some speculation that China was being frozen
  out of the anti-western bloc. But by having all three leaders together in
  Beijing, with it being Kim Jong-un’s first reported international trip since
  2019, it reaffirms that China is the most powerful player in that
  relationship.” *** Peace v War Xi’s speech during the military parade warned
  that the world was facing a choice between “peace or war, dialogue or
  confrontation, win-win or zero-sum”. “It was aggressive and while these
  speeches are often quite bombastic – it is a military parade after all – it
  wasn’t the kind of speech that was trying to placate or calm any western fears
  about China’s military might,” Amy said. The 70-minute parade featured tanks,
  drones, long-range and nuclear-capable missiles, fighter jets and stealth
  aircraft. There were reports of the J15-DT, China’s new carrier-based
  electronic warfare jet, and a new submarine-launched intercontinental
  ballistic missile. “China has been learning lessons from the war in Ukraine
  and has been thinking specifically about how it might fend off an assault on
  Taiwan and any aid that comes to Taiwan in that event,” Amy said. Xi and the
  Chinese Communist party claim Taiwan is part of China, with which it vows to
  “reunify”. Taiwan’s democratically elected government and its people are
  opposed to this. In response to the parade, Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te,
  said: “The people of Taiwan cherish peace, and Taiwan does not commemorate
  peace with the barrel of a gun.” *** The end of US-China cooperation The US
  had its own military parade overseen by Donald Trump in June, but it is
  notable how underwhelming it was when compared with Beijing’s. The US
  president was watching the events that took place in China, responding in
  typical Trump fashion on his Truth Social platform. “He sent this sarcastic
  message saying, ‘Congratulations to Xi, Putin and Kim, enjoy conspiring
  against the US,’” Amy said. While on one level he was critical, “Trump clearly
  has sympathy and admiration for the idea of showing off your country’s
  strengths through a massive military parade. So I wouldn’t be surprised if he
  was also a bit jealous.” Another key message from this week was the end of the
  so-called “golden era” of US-China cooperation, most notably on climate
  change. “The US has become increasingly hawkish on China, both under Trump and
  Biden. The mood in China is that there’s not really much room to negotiate
  with the US. There’s no love lost between the two countries,” Amy said.
  “What’s important to China is to build up its alliances that are independent
  of any western system; such as ensuring energy security by buying more oil and
  gas from Russia and ensuring stability on the border with North Korea.” The
  rise of China’s dominance comes off the back of a US global retreat, which
  will have an impact on human rights. Amy explained that cuts to USAID funding,
  which supported civil society groups, as well as the US’s erratic policies
  around tariffs as part of Trump’s America First agenda have left a vacuum on
  the global stage. And much to its delight, China doesn’t even need to be
  proactive in filling it. “Many countries see China as the more reliable
  partner, economically, politically,” Amy said. This is especially true for
  smaller and less powerful countries who once looked to the US for support, she
  added. “It is quite clear that China is going to be providing more political
  stability and money, without demanding democratic reforms or human rights
  protections. The erratic behaviour of the US in recent years has alienated
  many states, and China is benefiting from that.” Therefore, as China and the
  US tussle for global dominance, one casualty for the rest of the world is
  human rights and civil liberties. What else we’ve been reading On a train at
  the weekend I was shocked to see how yellow every single field was; I couldn’t
  remember it looking like this when I was younger – it looks weird. Lucy
  Jones’s piece on our fried landscape and the damage heatwaves and drought do
  to nature struck a chord with me. It feels like death by a thousand cuts.
  Phoebe Labour’s former shadow chancellor doesn’t hold back the punches as he
  gives Keir Starmer five steps to turn around his failing premiership. While
  it’s unclear Starmer will listen, his advice is well worth a read. Aamna
  Really cool and compelling data in this piece illustrates Europe’s population
  decline, showing how the rise of the far right could further drive economic
  downturns by cracking down on immigration. Phoebe There are only three months
  left of the year – did you gasp? I did when I realised – so make it worthwhile
  by checking out at least one of the performances from this amazing list of
  theatre, comedy or dance shows coming up this autumn. Aamna Green party leader
  Zack Polanski says he admires Nigel Farage’s ability to tell stories and
  communicate with voters. Can he harness “eco-populist” energy to be a real
  voice for progressive politics in the UK, without caving to Farage (unlike
  Labour)? George Monbiot clearly thinks so. Phoebe Sport US Open | Naomi Osaka
  turned back 11th-seeded Karolina Muchova for a 6-4, 7-6 quarter-final victory
  in just under two hours’ time. Amanda Anisimova had a sensational 6-4, 6-3
  quarter-final victory against second-seeded Iga Swiatek in 1hr 36min. Félix
  Auger-Aliassime defeated the eighth seed Alex de Minaur 4-6, 7-6 (7), 7-5, 7-6

  board, which represents more than 25,000 supporters, has issued a vote of no
  confidence in the club’s board. Cycling | The Professional Cyclists’
  Association has demanded better security at the Vuelta a España after
  protesters disrupted stages in recent days, with one rider crashing when
  demonstrators ran on to the road. The front pages “Rayner in peril after
  admitting she underpaid stamp duty on flat” says the Guardian, and the Times
  has “Rayner on brink after stamp duty admission”. Similar in the Financial
  Times: “Rayner fights for political survival after admitting to stamp duty
  underpayment”. The Daily Mail demands “Is Starmer so spineless that he won’t
  sack his deputy PM (and housing secretary!) who dodged £40,000 in stamp
  duty?”. The Express runs with “‘If PM had backbone he would sack her’” – Kemi
  Badenoch said that. In not it’s best work, the Metro says firing her is “A
  no-Rayner”. The Telegraph in mocking paraphrase says “I didn’t pay the right
  tax, but it’s still not my fault”. The deputy PM makes it into the puff boxes
  of the Mirror but the top story is about the late Virginia Giuffre: “Andrew
  accuser’s family: We’ll keep fighting”. Today in Focus Is curiosity the key to
  ageing well? Psychologists have traditionally believed we become less curious
  as we age, but recent research has shown that curiosity actually becomes more
  targeted and specific in our later years. To find out why this happens, and

  A bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all bad In the age of
  Hinge there is something particularly lovely (and old-fashioned) about this
  story of a couple who first met when they were 16. Bruna De Luca fell for
  Giacomo in a bar while on holiday in a tiny Italian mountain town called
  Atina. They had a summer fling before Bruna moved back to Edinburgh for her
  studies. They couldn’t make it work long distance and they had no mobile
  phones to keep in touch. One summer, 12 years after the relationship ended,
  Bruna saw Giacomo at the same bar where they had met all those years ago. They
  were in their 30s by then but the flame was very much still there. This time,
  they had mobile phones, so exchanged numbers and started visiting each other.
  A new chapter opened in a story they thought had ended, and they have now been
  happily married for more than a decade with children of their own. Sign up
