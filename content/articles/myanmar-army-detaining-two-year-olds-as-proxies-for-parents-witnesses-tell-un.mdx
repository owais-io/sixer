  Children as young as two years old have been detained by Myanmar’s military,
  often as proxies for their parents, and held in prison facilities where there
  is systematic torture, UN investigators have warned. The Independent
  Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar, which was set up to document and share
  evidence of abuse with national, regional and international courts, said in a
  report that the “frequency and brutality” of atrocities inside the country had
  continued to escalate, more than four years after the military seized power in
  a coup in February 2021. The IIMM said it had collected evidence from
  witnesses indicating that children aged from two to 17 had been detained,
  often in lieu of their parents. The military and police may detain children in
  cases where parents who are perceived to be associated with opposition
  movements cannot be found to arrest. Some of the detained children had been
  subjected to torture, ill treatment or sexual and gender-based crimes, the
  report said. The military has conducted mass arrests since the coup, detaining
  almost 30,000 people, including political opponents, journalists and activists
  accused of resisting junta rule, according to the Assistance Association for
  Political Prisoners (Burma), a local group that tracks arrests. The IIMM said
  it had gathered significant evidence that there was systematic torture inside
  prison facilities, including beatings, electric shocks, strangulation, torture
  by pulling out fingernails with pliers, and forms of sexual violence,
  including rape and gang-rape. Torture had resulted in death, the report said.
  Investigators had made progress in identifying specific members and units of
  security forces “involved in operations at identified detention facilities”,
  the report added, including direct perpetrators of sexual and gender-based
  crimes as well as high-level commanders. They had also gathered evidence of
  the identity of individuals – in the security forces and opposition armed
  groups – who had perpetrated summary executions, the IIMM report said. “It’s
  very important that perpetrators believe that somebody is watching, somebody
  is collecting evidence,” said Nicholas Koumjian, the head of IIMM, who said
  the conflict that had gripped Myanmar since the coup had become “more and more
  violent”. It was crucial that there was “commitment from the international
  community to see justice is done – not just for the people of Myanmar but as
  an example to the rest of the world also”, said Koumjian. The IIMM report,
  based on the period July 2024 to June 2025, warned that an unprecedented
  funding crisis was threatening investigators’ ability to collect and analyse
  evidence. It said funding constraints had affected the ability of
  investigators to travel, train and buy the necessary software to conduct their
  work. Staff positions would be reduced by 20% next year, it added. “These
  financial pressures threaten the mechanism’s ability to sustain its critical
  work and to continue supporting international and national justice efforts,”
  the report said. The UN is pursuing a cost-cutting drive, asking dozens of
  agencies, offices and operations to cut 20% of their staff, as it faces
  funding challenges. The IIMM is funded by the UN regular budget, as well as
  through grants from individual donor countries. Two US funding grants were
  terminated this year, though one continued, Koumjian said. The Trump
  administration has dismantled the US Agency for International Development, a
  major funder of humanitarian aid programmes around the world, and withdrawn
  from some UN agencies and ordered a broader review of US participation in the
  agencies. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has previously said
  efforts to cut back UN costs were due to a liquidity crisis, as member states
  were failing to pay their annual dues on time or in full. The IIMM has made
  more than two dozen requests to the Myanmar military, including for
  information relating to alleged crimes and for access to the country, but
  received no response. The military could not be reached by the Guardian for
  comment. It has previously denied atrocities have taken place and said its
  operations were in response to “terrorists” who were causing unrest.
