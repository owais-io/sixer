  At the end of another day of backchat and occasionally fraying tempers, in
  which the former England captain Michael Vaughan suggested of the two sets of
  players that “it’s almost like they’ve had enough of each other”, India
  admitted Joe Root had been the target of a deliberate plan to wind him up and
  put him off his game. Alastair Cook, another former England captain, had
  suggested as much after Root reacted to a comment from Prasidh Krishna. “He
  was angry, he wasn’t in much control, but why wouldn’t you try to upset Joe
  Root?” Cook said. “I don’t know if it was a plan but you can say that it did
  work. I just hope what he said was within the line. I hope it didn’t cross the
  line, and was good old honest sledging. It definitely got Joe out of his
  bubble.” Root, who across the first four matches of the series had scored two
  centuries and averaged 67.16, was duly dismissed for 29. “That was the plan,”
  Krishna said. “But I didn’t really expect the couple of words that I said to
  get such a big reaction from him. It was a very small thing. We’re good mates
  off the field – it was just a little bit of banter and both of us enjoyed it,
  I think.” On another occasion Akash Deep put an arm around Ben Duckett’s
  shoulder to usher him off the field after the England opener was dismissed for
  a quickfire 43, something England’s assistant coach Marcus Trescothick thought
  might have provoked a more violent response. “A lot of players would have just
  dropped the elbow on him,” he said. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen a bowler do
  that after getting someone out. I’m sure there’ll be occasions in the future
  where he may well [react]. It is what it is, isn’t it? There’s no need to walk
  him off in that fashion, but the game has been fought in good spirits –
  although there’s been many words and arguments along the way, the two teams
  are still getting on well enough and will continue to do so once the game is
  done.” India finished the second day on 75 for two, nursing a lead of 52 with
  21 wickets having already fallen on a green-tinged pitch described by
  Trescothick as “extreme”. “This pitch has been challenging,” he said. “There’s
  no doubt about it, with the way it was prepared to be a little bit greener. I
  think it’s been at the top end of what you want it to be. We’re at the extreme
  version of what we see in these types of pitches, but it’s kind of what we
  like – we want pace on the ball, we want the ball to bounce and we want the
  ball to carry through. We’re happy with how it’s performed so far.”
