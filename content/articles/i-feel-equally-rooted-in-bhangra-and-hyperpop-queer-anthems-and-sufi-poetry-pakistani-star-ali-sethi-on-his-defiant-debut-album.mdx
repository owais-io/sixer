  ‘I feel equally rooted in bhangra and hyperpop, queer anthems and Sufi

  As a child, Ali Sethi was enthralled watching Sufi whirling – a religious
  dance – at nearby shrines in Punjab: “There’s this collective catharsis that
  takes place and, briefly, your caste, class, gender, appearance, they stop
  mattering. You have licence in an otherwise extremely hierarchical society to
  just express yourself.” This is something the 41-year-old Pakistani-American
  singer, songwriter and composer hopes to create himself. Though he’s also a
  writer – be that his acclaimed 2009 novel, The Wish Maker, or contributions to
  publications such as the New Yorker – music became somewhere Sethi could be
  accepted, especially as a queer person growing up in Lahore. “I think music
  has this shamanic function in south Asian culture,” he says, “where things you
  cannot say in lay language you say in the love language of music.” Sethi’s
  stratospheric, shiver-inducing voice dissolves cultural divides. Take Intiha,
  his sublime 2023 experimental album of Sufi poetry with Chilean-American
  musician Nicolás Jaar, or 2022’s Pasoori, a bombastic raga-meets-reggaeton
  track which has surpassed a billion streams on YouTube Music, making it easily
  the biggest song to come out of Pakistan this century. When we speak, Sethi is
  about to release his debut solo album, Love Language, which builds on
  Pasoori’s thundering, Technicolor global pop. Working with producers like
  Brockhampton’s Romil Hemnani and Colombian musician Juan Ariza, it’s exuberant
  and almost oversaturated, flecked with 00s R&amp;B, Bollywood, drill rap,
  slinky flamenco, even a skit on the children’s game “akkad bakkad”, all of it
  underlined with hallmarks of north Indian classical. Not everyone is pleased.
  Sethi trained under two of the greats of classical music, Ustad Saami and
  Farida Khanum, and his initial career was in that more traditional world; some
  fans yearn for “the old Ali Sethi”. Though he’s adamant about using south
  Asian ragas rather than western chord progressions to inform the melodies for
  his songs, Sethi recounts how even the esteemed Ustad Saami asked him whether
  his music lately is fusion or, simply, confusion. “But I think in today’s
  completely monstrous world, what could be a better reflection than confusion?”
  Sethi laughs. The work of Pakistani musicians, including Sethi, has been
  banned and removed from streaming services in India, where fans are forced to
  access the music via VPN due to escalating tensions between both countries.
  “If you’re looking at it from the point of view of ideologues, music is the
  one thing that has kept the populations of India and Pakistan deeply connected
  to one another,” he says. “Every time the walls go up, the borders get
  re-erected but some song slips past, and there’s an instant [release of]
  fellow feeling … this unspoken connection.” The brief outbreak of conflict
  between the two nations earlier this year has worsened the cultural divide.
  The opening track on Sethi’s album was initially a duet with a well-known
  Bollywood singer, but a film industry body threatened that any Indian artist
  collaborating with a Pakistani artist would be blacklisted. The song is now
  censored, cut through with screams and distorted industrial textures. Sethi
  has also been unable to get a visa to enter India in nearly a decade. “Ever
  since I started releasing music, my biggest audience has been in India, and
  it’s the one place I’ve not been able to go,” he says. He wryly notes that the
  themes of “forbidden love” he explores in his music are “already in place”
  thanks to the travel ban. Inspired by Pakistani revolutionary poet Faiz Ahmed
  Faiz, Sethi’s lyrics read like love songs, but they’re layered with
  double-meanings about ethno-nationalism, Islamophobia, war, queerness and
  exile. On Bridegroom, he subverts a 13th-century qawwali sometimes sung at
  weddings, his untethered, gliding voice delivering coy lyrics that translate
  to “don’t ask about my husband”. This follows “pretty rigorously orchestrated
  fake news” two years ago, falsely claiming Sethi and his partner, the
  Pakistani painter Salman Toor, had breached local law and married. He didn’t
  know how to react, until the answer came in the form of this song. “I realised
  the appropriate response is to troll them back with what they think of as
  semi-sacred music, saying, ‘I refuse to give up my traditions.’” Sethi may
  laugh in defiance, but his words are tinged with sadness. “These last few
  years have been a whirlwind, not always in the nicest ways,” he says. “There’s
  a lot of angst and despair, a lot of ruing the loss of a milieu, the loss of
  home – but also revelling in new homes, temporary shelters, finding community
  with other musicians in places like Los Angeles, London and New York.” He says
  the success of NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is revitalising; the way
  he “squares that distance between all these different communities.” Love
  Language, then, is Sethi’s attempt at the same: a “diary of displacement” with
  the accompanying tour set to be “a variety show for the end times”. Mainly, he
  wants the music to be a refuge, and to capture his and his audience’s
  multiplicities. “I’m hoping it comes across as a work of synthesis rather than
  a work of assimilation,” Sethi says of his album, an attempt to make hybrid
  music without “simplifying or diluting” any of its constituent parts. “I feel
  equally rooted in Punjabi bhangra and hyperpop, equally conversant with queer
  club anthems and Sufi poetry; and, actually, I see all these connections all
  the time, because they dwell within me.” • Love Language is out now on
