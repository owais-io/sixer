  Congratulations then to Miyū Yamashita, commiserations to Charley Hull, and
  thanks to you for reading this blog. Here’s how the top of the leaderboard
  looks after it all came down in Porthcawl. See you for the Ryder Cup next
  month? OK, it’s a date! -11: Miyū Yamashita -9: Charley Hull, Minami Katsu -7:
  Rio Takeda, Kim A-lim -6: Hsu Wei-ling, Megan Khang -4: Paula Martin Sampedro
  (a), Lottie Woad, Steph Kyriacou -3: Mao Saigo, Andrea Lee -2: Pajaree
  Anannarukarn, Lauren Coughlin, Kim Sei-young, Minjee Lee, Kim Hyojoo, Chiara
  Tamburlini -1: Linn Grant, Yan Liu, Mimi Rhodes, Georgia Hall Charley Hull
  speaks to Sky. “I felt I was so under control … on 16 I hit a really nice tee
  shot with my rescue wood … the wind was howling off the left and I hit it pure
  … it just didn’t move a yard through the air … so I went in the bunker … I hit
  a lay-up shot but was pumped … I gave it a good run … there’s always next
  year! … I feel pretty good … I played pretty decent all week … I came in not
  confident … I’m pretty proud of myself.” Meanwhile it turns out that Hull is
  only second on the list of players with multiple runners-up finishes in the
  majors without a win. She’s on four, alongside Judy Rankin, Rosie Jones and
  Ruth Jessen, but behind Ayako Okamoto, who suffered like this on six
  occasions. … and so Miyū Yamashita becomes the second Japanese major winner
  this year. Her victory at the Women’s Open follows Mao Saigo’s triumph at the
  Chevron Championship back in May. She’s the sixth Japanese woman to win a
  major, after Chako Higuchi (1977 LPGA), Hinako Shibuno (2019 Women’s Open),
  Yuka Saso (2021 and 2024 US Open), Ayaka Furue (2024 Evian) and the
  aforementioned Mao Saigo. That is not bad company to be keeping. Miyū
  Yamashita, blinking back happy tears, clearly still processing her richly
  deserved major-championship breakthrough, continues. “The course is obviously
  very difficult … but in brilliant condition … the amount of support really
  pushed me to victory so this is for them as well … I’d like to thank everyone
  … my first win is very special … to celebrate with everyone is amazing … thank
  you!” Then it’s time for Miyū Yamashita – 24 years old yesterday, so happy
  birthday! – to lift the trophy. All smiles. So happy! Her first interview as a
  major champion begins. “To win such a historic tournament in front of all
  these amazing fans is such an incredible feeling … to have my family around me
  and have so much support is amazing … very special!” Miyū Yamashita checks the
  numbers on her card, and scribbles her name at the bottom of it. No
  Roberto-De-Vicenzo-infused errors today, please! Then she makes her way to the
  trophy presentation. R&amp;A Guy talks for a bit, thanking the folk he has to
  thank. But then it’s time to announce the results. First up, the Smyth Salver
  is awarded to Paula Martin Sampedro, the leading amateur with a score of 284.
  The brilliant young Spaniard, who made five birdies in a row earlier today,
  bounces up to collect her prize. Lottie Woad won it last year, so great things
  await! Props to Charley Hull, who once again has done so much to inject
  excitement into a Women’s Open, only to come up short. She’s now finished as
  runner-up at four majors, a record for someone who hasn’t won any. Surely her
  time will come. The pain of coming so close again will sting for a while, but
  once it subsides she’ll be proud: she certainly wasn’t expecting too much
  coming into this week, after illness and injury. Yes, she’ll be back. Hats off
  as well to Mimi Rhodes, who made that snooker-loopy ace on the 5th, caroming
  her ball off Steph Kyriacou’s, the Aussie becoming the first player in golf
  history to record a hole-in-one (she aced the 8th on Friday) and an assist for
  someone else’s ace at the same major. Traditionalists needn’t bother arguing
  the toss, because she did do that, so assists are a new thing now.
  Congratulations to Mimi and Steph! That was a glorious final round by Miyū
  Yamashita. Out in 33, steady all the way, with only the slightest of wobbles
  midway along the back nine. Even then, she made two huge par saves, at 13 and
  14, to keep things going. Kim A-lim briefly joined her at the top, and Charley
  Hull launched one of her trademark chases, but each time they got close,
  Yamashita held her nerve and her position. Just the one dropped shot, on 17,
  and even that wasn’t too egregious. A thoroughly deserved victory for a player
  who came so close at last year’s PGA, but has now gone one better. Two careful
  putts, and Miyū Yamashita finishes with a round of 70. She’s the new Women’s
  Open champion golfer! She raises her arms in victory as her face crumples into
  joyful tears. Kim A-lim gives her a cuddle … and tips her water bottle down
  her back while doing so! All in the way of celebration, as her compatriots
  race onto the green with bottles of champagne, and soak her once again! -11:
  Yamashita (F) -9: Hull (F), Katsu (F) -7: Takeda (F), AL Kim (F) Miyū
  Yamashita whips a graceful wedge into the heart of 18. This is done. Kim A-lim
  nearly holes out for a valedictory eagle, but tidies up for birdie. A
  disappointing 73 and it’s easy to forget now, as she finishes at -7, that Kim
  briefly had co-ownership of the lead earlier this afternoon. The thing about
  Jean Van de Velde was, he didn’t bottle the 1999 Open. Sure, he ballsed it up
  in the grand style … but it wasn’t for the lack of moxie. He could have nudged
  his ball up the 18th at Carnoustie, but wanted to win the Open “like
  D’Artagnan”. Hats off to him for that, the man will forever be one of the
  great Open heroes.† So hats off also to Miyū Yamashita, who could take a
  careful iron out of the rough to take some greenside bunkers out of play, but
  instead lashes a wood for full effect. She tugs it a bit, and is fortunate to
  miss those aforementioned bunkers. But fortune favours the brave. The ball
  skips to the left of them, and she’ll have a wedge from light rough to reach
  the green in regulation. †: Winning’s not everything. Who still talks about
  Todd Hamilton? Miyū Yamashita isn’t risking the gorse down the right of 18.
  She favours the left-hand side of the fairway, and while her ball goes into
  the semi-rough, she’ll take that. Meanwhile up on the green, Minami Katsu
  makes birdie to finish with a 69. Unless her compatriot Yamashita collapses in
  the Jean Van de Velde style, she’ll finish in a tie for second with Charley
  Hull. Three of the top four are from Japan. -11: Yamashita (17) -9: Hull (F),
  Katsu (F) -7: Takeda (F) … and yet this isn’t quite over yet. Miyū Yamashita
  can’t make her par putt on 17, the ball always breaking low on the right-hand
  side, and that’s the leader’s first bogey of the day. What a time to make it.
  Bogey for Kim A-lim. -11: Yamashita (17) -9: Hull (F) -8: Katsu (17) -7:
  Takeda (F) Charley Hull lobs over the bunker at 18 to ten feet. A chance for a
  birdie to put pressure on Miyū Yamashita … but her putt is always missing
  left. Just a par, and she signs for a final round of 69. It promised more.
  Much more. But those bogeys at 16 and 17 were body blows she had no time to
  recover from. She ends the week at -9, the new clubhouse leader. She’ll most
  likely finish second at a major for the fourth time. Nobody has as many
  runner-up finishes on her CV without actually winning one. Now then. Miyū
  Yamashita is able to take a fairway wood to her ball from the rough down the
  left of 17. But she doesn’t catch it cleanly, pulling it further left. And
  though the ball clears a bunker, it nestles in some thick rough a few yards
  further on. Plenty to think about. So she takes her time before chipping … and
  swishes a fine wedge out to eight feet. It’s a decent outcome from where she
  was, but she’s got work to do to save her par. She’s made big putts on 13 and
  14 to keep her card intact. Can she make another? Charley Hull has to take a
  shy for the green from the centre of 18. Her ball’s always carving off to the
  right, and ends up in the most awkward position, at the bottom of a depression
  behind a greenside bunker, with the pin only just over the back of the sand.
  Short-sided, with added undulations for extra misery. She walks up the fairway
  to gentle applause from a disappointed gallery; the player herself tries to
  put on a brave face but a smile doesn’t last long. By the looks of it, this
  will be another close-but-no-cigar story for Hull in the majors. … so having
  said that, Yamashita looks a little anxiously after her drive on 17. Her ball
  disappears into the rough down the left. It’s all about the lie. Meanwhile par
  on 18 for Rio Takeda, who finishes with a 71 and ends the week at -7. She’s
  the new clubhouse leader. Charley Hull arrives at 18 with very little to lose
  now. So she opens her shoulders, takes an aggressive line off the tree, and
  lashes a big boom down the fairway. It’s nearly rendered utterly futile by
  Miyū Yamashita, who is an inch or so away from curling in a 40-foot
  left-to-right swinger on 16. This has been such a sensational performance by
  Yamashita. Just no gap in the armour. No bogeys, that’s for sure. -12:
  Yamashita (16) -9: Hull (17) -8: Katsu (16) -7: Takeda (17), AL Kim (16) -6:
  Hsu (F) Charley Hull leaves her putt from the fringe at the back of 17 ten
  feet short. The par putt’s always missing to the left, and that’s back-to-back
  bogeys at exactly the wrong time. Her bid’s almost kaput. An eagle up the last
  is pretty much necessary now if she’s to apply any real pressure on Miyū
  Yamashita … but the leader swipes her second at 16 into the green. On in
  regulation, and she’s yet to make a bogey today. Hull will most likely need
  Yamashita’s wheels to come clanking off, and that just doesn’t look likely.
  Meanwhile we have a new clubhouse leader in Hsu Wei-ling, who birdies 18 to
  sign for a 70 and end her week at -6. -12: Yamashita (15) -9: Hull (17) -8:
  Katsu (16) -7: Takeda (17), AL Kim (15) -6: Hsu (F) Miyū Yamashita sends a
  gentle draw into the par-three 15th. She’s got a 12-foot left-to-right curler
  to make a birdie that would surely seal the deal, but while her putt looks
  like dropping, it stops the width of one dimple to the left of the hole. She
  taps in for par, then swishes a nerveless drive down the middle of 16.
  Yamashita was driving wild yesterday; whatever she did on the range last night
  has clearly fixed whatever problem there was. Charley Hull most likely needs
  something coming in, and holes are running out. So it’s not good news that she
  sends her tee shot at 17 into the rough down the left. She’s got to go for it
  … and fizzes her second into the heart of the green. It’s another slightly hot
  one, and the ball bounces off the back, but there’s no swale so she can putt
  from the fringe. … but it’s not costly, because she gathers herself and rolls
  in the one coming back! From the ridiculous to the sublime! Another fine par
  save, to follow the as-nails putt on 13. Kim A-lim rolls in her bogey putt,
  some damage-limitation of her own, but she’s four behind again. And up on 16,
  Charley Hull leaves her chip up from the back of the green the best part of 20
  feet short. Double-bogey disaster awaits … but then she strokes in the gentle
  left-to-right slider. More damage limitation! Yamashita’s closest rivals going
  backwards, but it could have been so much worse, and this Open isn’t quite
  done and dusted yet. -12: Yamashita (14) -10: Hull (16) -8: Katsu (15), AL Kim
  (14) Charley Hull gets a flyer out of the rough, and her ball scampers over
  the back of the 16th green. She’ll need to get up and down from the swale to
  restrict the damage to par. Kim A-lim leaves her monster par putt five feet
  short. And then Miyū Yamashita, putting for birdie from 35 feet, completely
  misreads her putt. Six feet wide and ten past! What an absurd rush of blood …
  Kim A-lim’s ball has rebounded into filthy rough on 14. She does well to
  muscle the ball out and into the front of the green, but she’s a long way from
  the hole, and faces a long two putts just for bogey. Meanwhile over on 16,
  Charley Hull whips her ball out of the fairway bunker, but sends it into rough
  down the other side of the hole. She grabs a break, in so much as the grass
  has been trampled down by the gallery. But she’s now got to get up and down
  from 100 yards to save her par. While it all whirls around, Miyū Yamashita
  waits patiently. The wind is behind Miyū Yamashita again. She finds the 14th
  green in regulation, while Kim A-lim hits the face of a fairway bunker,
  sending her ball pinging back into deep rough. Charley Hull meanwhile finds
  fairway sand of her own, down the left of 16. A few minutes ago, Yamashita was
  in danger of relinquishing her lead. But she scrambled a par, while Kim
  narrowly missed an eagle putt and Hull left her birdie effort short. And now
  look. Charley Hull gets a bit tentative with the putter again. Her birdie
  effort on 15 is always missing on the low side, and never reaching. Not the
  easiest putt, to be fair, with a fair bit of left-to-right break. Meanwhile
  Steph Kyriacou joins Paula Martin Sampedro and Lottie Woad in the clubhouse
  lead at -4. She signs for a one-under round of 71, which is no mean feat
  having triple-bogeyed the opening hole, sending one ball out of bounds and
  nearly repeating the trick with her next shot. Also the near-miss ace at 5,
  that turned into an assist for Mimi Rhodes to make one of her own. Ah well,
  she’ll always have the hole-in-one she made at 8 on Friday. Charley Hull on
  the 144-yard downhill par-three 15th. She’s not made birdie on this hole this
  week … yet. But despite flirting with the pot bunker to the right, she sets up
  a chance here, landing her ball ten feet from the flag. Meanwhile back on 12,
  Kim A-lim nearly drains her eagle putt, but it stays out on the left. She taps
  in for birdie. Over to the leader Miyū Yamashita, who can only chip up from
  her downhill lie at the bottom of the swale to 15 feet. But she makes the
  left-to-right slider. Nerveless. That could have been a three-shot swing
  between herself and Kim; it’s just one. It could also have cost her sole
  ownership of the lead; she’s still got it. But this is so close now. Good luck
  calling it! -12: Yamashita (13) -11: Hull (14) -9: AL Kim (13) -8: Katsu (13)
  -7: Takeda (15) Charley Hull applies extra pressure! She whips out of the
  thick rough down the side of 14, finding the centre of the green. That’s a
  fine shot to extricate herself from trouble, and set up an outside chance of
  birdie … which she converts! In goes the 30-footer, and this is really hotting
  up now! -12: Yamashita (12) -11: Hull (14) -8: Katsu (13), AL Kim (12) -7:
  Takeda (15) … and these could turn out to be big moments in the race for the
  title! Because Kim A-lim then creams her fairway wood, shot two, into the
  heart of 13, and uses the camber to gather her ball towards the flag,
  back-right. She’ll have a look at eagle from 12 feet or so. That’s a
  sensational shot, and the pressure’s now on Miyū Yamashita, who faces a job to
  get up and down for par. A potential big swing could be upcoming. Rio Takeda
  nearly inserts herself into serious contention … but her 15-foot,
  left-to-right birdie slider lips out. How did that not drop?! She remains at
  -7. Meanwhile the leader Miyū Yamashita will have some work to do on the
  par-five 13th. She takes her medicine from the fairway bunker, chipping out
  sideways, then lashes her third into the green … only for the ball to topple
  off down a swale to the left. She’s ended up on a downslope as well. That will
  be super-tricky. The new sensation Lottie Woad – one of the pre-tournament
  favourites despite this being only her second (!) professional start – gets up
  and down from the wrong side of a greenside bunker on 18. Having been
  short-sided, that’s a lovely chip with putt to match. She’s not had her best
  stuff this week, especially struggling with the putter, and yet she ends the
  day with a 71 and an overall mark of -4. Surrey’s finest joins the amateur
  Paula Martin Sampedro in the clubhouse lead. She’s a phenomenon. One day, all
  this will be hers. Miyū Yamashita’s problems during yesterday’s 74 were all
  down to her erratic driving. She looked to have the big stick under control
  today, but now she sends her tee shot at 13 into a bunker down the left.
  Problems from the tee for Charley Hull, as well, as she carves her drive into
  thick muck down the right of 14. Charley Hull’s bunker shot on 13: short and
  tentative. Her subsequent long birdie putt: short and tentative. Miyū
  Yamashita’s birdie putt on 12: short and tentative. Kim A-lim’s birdie putt on
  12: short and tentative. Par, par, par. The nerves beginning to kick in on
  major-championship Sunday. -12: Yamashita (12) -10: Hull (13) -8: Katsu (12),
  AL Kim (12) -7: Takeda (14) Charley Hull’s second at the par-five 13th
  trickles into a bunker 30 yards short of the green. She’s left with a long
  sand shot coming in. Meanwhile back on the par-three 12th, Miyū Yamashita and
  Kim A-lim both find the heart of the green, leaving themselves birdie chances
  from mid-range. Big moments coming up. From her position halfway up 11, Miyū
  Yamashita can see Charley Hull making her birdie up on 12. It doesn’t faze
  her. She whistles her second into the heart of the green en route to a
  fuss-free par. It’s par for Kim A-lim as well, but in less conventional style.
  Kim’s approach finds a deep bunker to the right of the green. She doesn’t get
  particularly close with her splash out, but makes the six-footer that remains.
  The ball performs the loop-de-loop, all the way around the rim of the cup
  before dropping. In. Just. When it disappears, Kim gives the air a little
  punch. She knows how important that was. She’s hanging on in there at -8, four
  behind the leader. Minami Katsu makes it three birdies in six holes! She walks
  in a 30-footer on 11, a left-to-right slinger that brings her up to -8.
  Momentarily on Charley Hull’s shoulder … but then Hull tickles in her own
  left-to-right birdie putt, and the lead is back to just two! -12: Yamashita
  (10) -10: Hull (12) -8: Katsu (11), AL Kim (10) -7: Takeda (12) -6: Khang
  (12), A Lee (11) … but Charley Hull needs to make some sort of move, before
  it’s too late, as she can’t depend on Miyū Yamashita to capitulate. Her long
  game is still on point, and here she is firing another dart at the flag, this
  time at the par-three 12th. She’ll have another good look at birdie. Charley
  Hull sends another average wedge into the green, this time at 11. She’s pin
  high but well left of the target, and faces a tricky left-to-right breaker
  over a ridge. She doesn’t make a particularly good fist of the putt, which is
  always sailing wide right. She’s left with a tricky six-footer for her par …
  but she makes it. A crucial putt, that one, because par is slightly
  disappointing considering where she was chipping into the green from; bogey
  would have been a disaster. She remains at -9 … and there’s some good news for
  her back on 10, where Miyū Yamashita and Kim A-lim take turns to miss makeable
  birdie putts. It’s as you were at the top, albeit with everyone one hole
  closer to home. Charley Hull’s slightly jittery greenside play on 9 and 10
  could prove costly, because Miyū Yamashita is going along very nicely. She
  reaches the par-three 9th in two, and though the monster eagle putt never
  looks like dropping, it’s a birdie, and she hits the turn in 33. No blemishes
  on her card today; the nerves she admitted to suffering yesterday appear to
  have been banished. For now, at least. Kim A-lim also birdies 9, but she’s
  turning in level-par 36. Meanwhile Rio Takeda rakes in a monster for birdie at
  11, then picks up another shot at 12 after knocking her tee shot to three
  feet, and she’s now one of three Japanese players in with a shout of the
  title. -12: Yamashita (9) -9: Hull (10) -8: AL Kim (9) -7: Takeda (12), Katsu
  (9) The 2023 runner-up Charley Hull – who also has second-place
  major-championship finishes at the Dinah Shore (2016) and the US Open (2023)
  on her resumé – fires a dart into 10. It’s an aggressive play, because there’s
  only a small landing area near the pin, and a big downhill slope just behind
  it. But then she gets super-tentative with a pretty straight and flat
  eight-footer for birdie, and that’s a second disappointing par in a row. A
  strange mix of carpe-diem swashbuckle and tentative stuff around the green.
  Minami Katsu moves into red figures for her round by walking in a 25-footer on
  9. The birdie means she turns in 35, and rises to -7. Her playing partner
  Andrea Lee lips out, though, and remains at -6. Not sure how that one didn’t
  drop. A sense that it’s simply not going to be Lee’s week; she was
  super-unfortunate yesterday afternoon when the pin irritatingly stopped her
  holing out from greenside sand for birdie at 15. The small margins between
  being right in the thick of it, and just off the pace. Here’s more on that
  astonishing ace at the 5th by Mimi Rhodes, courtesy of our man at Porthcawl,
  Ewan Murray. You can also enjoy it in the popular modern clip form. … so
  having just said that, another Pulitzer bid goes down the swanny as Kim A-lim
  makes bounce-back birdie on the 95-yard par-three 8th. She walks in a
  ten-footer, but she’s still four off the lead because Miyū Wamashita does
  exactly the same. The birdie extends her lead to two strokes, as up on the
  par-five 9th, Charley Hull leaves herself a bit too much to do with an
  uncharacteristically average wedge from a promising position. The birdie putt
  comes up short as well. A good chance spurned. -11: Yamashita (8) -9: Hull (9)
  -7: AL Kim (8) -6: A Lee (8), Katsu (8) Kim A-lim’s game looks to have
  deserted her. A short par putt rolls by the hole at 7, and suddenly, at -6,
  she’s four behind the leader Miyū Yamashita. Kim was joint leader not much
  more than an hour ago. Meanwhile Hsu Wei-ling’s momentum stalls with bogey at
  10. -10: Yamashita (7) -9: Hull (8) -6: A Lee (8), Katsu (8), AL Kim (7) Hsu
  Wei-ling reaches the turn in 34. The 30-year-old from Taiwan doesn’t have much
  of a record in the majors, but one of her two top-ten finishes came just a
  couple of months ago at the PGA. Now she’s closing in on another. Having
  opened bogey-bogey, Hsu has since birdied 4 and 9, and eagled 6. She’s -6.
  Charley’s Charge is on! The short par-three 8th is playing just 95 yards
  today. Hull doesn’t wedge her tee shot particularly close, but she makes the
  15-foot putt she leaves herself. Just. The right-hand side of the cup grabs
  enough of the ball just as it threatens to kink wide. That’s three birdies in
  four holes, and the crowd sense something is brewing. They sensed it at Walton
  Heath a couple of years ago as well, only for Hull to fall short in the end;
  perhaps that experience will stand the popular English star in good stead this
  time round. -10: Yamashita (6) -9: Hull (8) -7: AL Kim (6) Kim A-lim’s
  left-to-right birdie attempt on 6 stubbornly refuses to drop. That opens the
  door for Miyū Yamashita, but the leader also fails to give her birdie putt
  enough juice. The last group remain at -7 and -10 respectively. Meanwhile on
  13, small jets of steam come out of Lottie Woad’s ears. Having started
  bogey-bogey, she’d clawed herself back to where she started (-3) with birdies
  at 8 and 9. But she’s since missed good birdie chances at 10 and 11, and now
  fails to make a short par putt on 12. Her flat stick failing her at exactly
  the wrong time, she walks off the green by throwing her ball into the air,
  then catching it with a wild swipe. Not happy. She’s -2. Charley Hull is a
  couple of joules of energy shy of three birdies in a row. Her right-to-left
  slider from 30 feet on 7 stops just short. Meanwhile Kim A-lim finds a fairway
  bunker down the left of the par-five 6th, then slaps her attempted escape into
  the face of the trap. The ball still pings back out onto the grass, though,
  and she takes full advantage of her good fortune, whip-cracking a wood into
  the heart of the green, a gentle draw setting up chance of bounce-back birdie.
  She’ll have a look from 25 feet. Charley Hull loves the chase. “It’s quite
  fun,” she said after yesterday’s entertaining 66. “I like it. It’s more fun
  that way. I like hunting someone down.” And she’s doing just that. Having
  negotiated Porthcawl’s brutal opening four holes in level par, she’s now
  pressing the pedal to the floor. She follows the aforementioned birdie at 5 by
  finding the par-five 6th in two big lashes, then nearly draining the long
  eagle putt. She taps in for back-to-back birdies, and is now firmly positioned
  in Miyū Yamashita’s rear-view mirror. -10: Yamashita (5) -8: Hull (6) -7: AL
  Kim (5) -6: Katsu (6), A Lee (5) Kim A-lim is beginning to look frustrated.
  She hasn’t worked out the pace of the greens at all. She leaves her uphill
  birdie putt at 5 short, and harrumphs as she tidies up for par. Her mood may
  be slightly improved by Miyū Yamashita pushing her six-foot birdie attempt
  wide right, then nearly missing the tiddler coming back, but the left-hand
  side of the cup grabs enough of the ball for it to drop. Yamashita admitted
  that nerves got the better of her during yesterday’s 74; don’t be totally
  surprised if they kick in again as she looks to close this out. A big change
  at the top. Birdie for Miyū Yamashita on 4 as she rolls in a 15-footer. But
  it’s a dropped shot for her playing partner Kim A-lim, who comes up short with
  a bunker shot and misses the par saver on the low side. All of a sudden,
  there’s a three-stroke buffer for the 24-year-old from Japan, who came close
  at the PGA last year, as one of three runners-up behind Amy Yang, and is now
  on course to go one better and land her first major title. -10: Yamashita (4)
  -7: Hull (5), AL Kim (4) -6: A Lee (5) Paula Martin Sampedro was going round
  with last year’s champion Lydia Ko. The Kiwi also birdies the last, and
  finishes the defence of her title with a round of 75, +3 overall. … and she
  does it in style, getting up and down from a greenside bunker at 18 for
  birdie! That’s her sixth on the back nine, after that five-in-a-row run
  between 11 and 15, and she’s played it in 30 strokes. A closing round of 68,
  and she ends the week at -4. Expect more big things from the 20-year-old
  Spaniard; recent winners include Leona Maguire, Atthaya Thitikul, Rose Zhang
  and Lottie Woad. Minami Katsu makes a wonder-par on 4. Her tee shot at 4 looks
  to be snap-hooking out of bounds, but hits a steward and stays on the
  property. She zig-zags her way up the hole, and finds herself in a swale to
  the right of the green. You know the rest: she rakes in her Texas Wedge, and
  remains at -5. Meanwhile birdie for Charley Hull at 5, her first move of the
  day at the beginning of a kinder run of holes. She’s -7, and properly in the
  hunt now. So much for that advantage. Kim A-lim sends her long birdie putt six
  feet past, then fails to hit the one coming back. Her ball stops on the edge
  and stubbornly refuses to drop, despite the wind whipping in from the Bristol
  Channel. Miyū Yamashita meanwhile chips up to five feet, and tidies up for a
  battling par, her one-shot lead at the top restored. -9: Yamashita (3) -8: AL
  Kim (3) -6: Hull (4) -5: Takeda (5), Khang (4), A Lee (3), Katsu (3) Kim A-lim
  wallops her drive at 3 straight down the middle. She’s way longer than her
  playing partner Miyū Yamashita, who needs a fairway wood to reach the green.
  Yamashita sends her second into thick grass to the right of the dancefloor.
  Kim meanwhile, requiring only an 8-iron, carefully finds the centre of the
  green. Advantage Kim. Birdies are precious, of course, but the bulk of
  evidence suggests that today is all about the struggle, the scramble, and not
  going backwards. We’re tied at the top. Kim A-lim lands her second into 2 ten
  feet past the flag, then spins it back to six. She rolls in the birdie putt,
  and joins her playing partner Miyū Yamashita at -9. A clumsy three-putt bogey
  for Megan Khang on 3, meanwhile, and the top of the leaderboard thins out a
  little more. -9: Yamashita (2), AL Kim (2) -6: Hull (3) -5: Takeda (4), Khang
  (3), A Lee (2), Katsu (2) -4: SY Kim (10), Rhodes (7), H Kim (6) Paula Martin
  Sampredo is going to win the Silver Salver for low amateur. She’s -3 overall
  with just a couple of holes to play, and the next-best amateur is Carla
  Bernat, in the hutch at +9. So on the one hand, you could say this particular
  race is anti-climactic … except that the 20-year-old Spaniard, who won the
  Women’s Amateur Championship in June at Nairn, has made five birdies in a row
  on the back nine, between 11 and 15. What is it with Spanish swashbucklers and
  the Open? An opening bogey for Andrea Lee. Then the final pairing take to the
  course, with Kim A-lim and Miyū Yamashita parring the opening hole. Suddenly
  there’s a little bit of separation at the top of the leaderboard. Meanwhile
  Kim Sei-young rapidly undoes exactly half of all her good work on the front
  nine, with double bogey at 10. She slips back to -4, and that’s golf in a
  nutshell. -9: Yamashita (1) -8: AL Kim (1) -6: Hull (2), Khang (2) This will
  sound utterly preposterous, but there’s a reasonable chance we’ll see another
  ace at the par-three 5th today. Kim Hyojoo and Ariya Jutanugarn nearly combine
  to replicate the antics of Steph Kyriacou and Mimi Rhodes, Kim knocking her
  tee shot to kick-in distance, Jutanugarn then doing the same. But her ball
  doesn’t cannon in for an ace, stopping just short instead. Those odds perhaps
  not so infinitesimal after all. The pin’s certainly in a spot where the camber
  of the green gathers the ball. No pressure on the groups that follow, then,
  but having seen four shots in a row pepper the flag, one of them dropping for
  an ace, the other three less than the width of a ball away from doing so, the
  gallery expect! While all that bedlam was unfolding, Charley Hull was
  battering a huge drive down the middle of 1, finding a pot bunker with her
  approach, then swishing out of it to close range, saving her par. And up on 9,
  it’s yet another birdie for Kim Sei-young. She’s out in 32, proof that a score
  can be made out there, despite the conditions. She’s -6. Mimi Rhodes is making
  her Open debut this week. The 24-year-old from Bath already has three wins on
  the European Tour to her name this year, at the NSW Open, the Joburg Open, and
  the Dutch Open. She’ll not be adding the British title to her resumé, not this
  year anyway, but she’s made her mark here nonetheless. And in spectacular
  circumstances. First up, on the tee at the 184-yard par-three 5th, Steph
  Kyriacou, who whips her iron straight at the flag. It’s rolling towards the
  cup … but on it’s very last rotation, the ball turns to the left and stops at
  the side of the hole. Rhodes takes her turn, and sends an almost identical
  shot straight at the pin. This one’s going to miss the hole on the left … but
  it doesn’t miss Kyriacou’s ball, and kisses off it, snooker style, and in for
  an ace! That’s an outrageous sequence of events! Odds infinitesimal! Rhodes
  points to herself in disbelief, as if to ask: was that my ball that went in?
  And also: did that really happen?!?! Yep! She high-fives with Kyriacou, the
  pair grinning with delight. As Rhodes continues to cavort, Kyriacou walks off
  towards the green and shares a theatrical – and extremely good-humoured – joke
  with her caddie, both waving their arms in the dash-darn-god-damn-it fashion.
  You’ll be seeing all of that again. Delightful. (Almost An Afterthought dept.
  Rhodes is back up to -4.) … so there’s not a great deal of upward movement on
  the leaderboard, but the 2020 PGA champion Kim Sei-young is showing it can be
  done. Birdies for the 32-year-old South Korean at 5, 6 and 7, and it’s nearly
  four in a row as her 25-footer shaves the lip on the par-three 8th. That one’s
  not to be, but she’s whistled up the standings to -5. Time for the first
  leaderboard update of the day, then. -9: Yamashita -8: AL Kim -7: Lee -6:
  Katsu, Hull, Khang -5: SY Kim (8), Takeda (1) Early trouble for the 2018
  champion Georgia Hall. The 29-year-old AFC Bournemouth fan finds thick rough
  down the left from the centre of 1, and can’t chop out onto the green. She’s
  left with a long putt from the fringe for par. It’s asking too much, and
  that’s a shot dropped immediately due to an unforced error. She’s -4.
  Meanwhile a three-putt bogey for her playing partner Rio Takeda; she’s now -5.
  The gallery muted as they witness the 22nd and 23rd bogeys at this hole today.
  Lottie Woad isn’t the only big name heading in the wrong direction early
  doors. The wind is whipping right to left across the 1st fairway, and it’s
  causing all manner of problems. The 2016 champion Ariya Jutanugarn sets her
  opening tee shot out to the right, hoping for a mix of wind and draw to bring
  it back. It doesn’t come. Into a gorse bush she goes. Reload, and that leads
  to a triple-bogey seven. She then drops another at 2, and in a flash, she
  drops 18 places on the leaderboard to +1, any faint hopes of glory gone. It’s
  a similar story for Steph Kyriacou, who sends her second at 1 out of bounds on
  the left, then nearly does it again with her second ball. Another triple-bogey
  seven, and following bogey at 3, she’s +1 as well. It’s been a poor start for
  golf’s hottest property, the new Irish and Scottish Open champion Lottie Woad.
  The 21-year-old from Surrey won the Smyth Salver for low amateur at St Andrews
  last year, finishing in a tie for tenth, but a similarly high finish might
  already be beyond her this time round. Woad bogeys 1, the result of hooking
  her approach from the centre of the fairway miles left, then drops another at
  2 thanks to a three-putt. Her radar is a bit skew-whiff on 4 as well, as she
  misreads a long birdie putt, but she’s able to tidy up for a par that keeps
  her at -1 overall. Conditions haven’t been great for the early starters. It’s
  been raining, and blowing a hoolie. As a result, there hasn’t been much
  forward momentum on display. So far there are only two players back in the
  clubhouse with a score under par: Shannon Tan, who ends the week at +5 after
  her 70, and the 2013 champion Stacy Lewis, who shot 71 to finish her
  tournament at +7. The 65s and 66s of earlier in the week something of a pipe
  dream right now … and although it’s since stopped raining, with temperatures
  forecast to rise a bit during the afternoon, the wind’s likely to stay up.
  Good luck to one and all. It’s not called Moving Day for nothing. After 36
  holes, the top of the leaderboard at the 49th Women’s Open looked like this …
  -11: Miyū Yamashita -8: Rio Takeda -4: Pajaree Anannarukarn, Lindy Duncan,
  Laura Fünfstück, Chiara Tamburlini … and it was beginning to look like the
  first major to ever be held at Royal Porthcawl was either going to turn into
  either a procession or a mano-a-mano battle. But then after yesterday’s third
  round, the top of the leaderboard looked like this … -9: Miyū Yamashita -8:
  Kim A-lim -7: Andrea Lee -6: Minami Katsu, Charley Hull, Megan Khang, Rio
  Takeda -4: Georgia Hall, Hsu Wei-ling, Chiara Tamburlini -3: Mao Saigo, Ariya
  Jutanugarn, Kim Hyojoo, Steph Kyriacou, Mimi Rhodes, Lottie Woad … and, well,
  OK, Yamashita is still in pole position. But after her two-over round of 74,
  67s for Kim A-lim and Andrea Lee, a 66 for Charley Hull and 65 for Minami
  Katsu, an awful lot of quality big-name players are suddenly on her shoulder.
  Lydia Ko came roaring through the pack at St Andrews to claim the title last
  year; there are plenty of stars who’ll fancy their chances of performing the
  very same trick today. Yamashita – who admitted to feeling nervous while
  leading from the front yesterday – will hope to rediscover her confident
  65-shooting Friday self and bag her first major title. It’s all set up so
  deliciously. Here are the final few tee times (BST). It’s on! 1.50pm: Georgia
  Hall, Rio Takeda 2pm: Megan Khang, Charley Hull 2.10pm: Minami Katsu, Andrea
  Lee 2.20pm: Kim A-lim, Miyū Yamashita

Congratulations then to Miyū Yamashita, commiserations to Charley Hull, and thanks to you for reading this blog. Here’s how the top of the leaderboard looks after it all came down in Porthcawl. See you for the Ryder Cup next month? OK, it’s a date! -11: Miyū Yamashita -9: Charley Hull, Minami Katsu -7: Rio Takeda, Kim A-lim -6: Hsu Wei-ling, Megan Khang -4: Paula Martin Sampedro (a), Lottie Woad, Steph Kyriacou -3: Mao Saigo, Andrea Lee -2: Pajaree Anannarukarn, Lauren Coughlin, Kim Sei-young, Minjee Lee, Kim Hyojoo, Chiara Tamburlini -1: Linn Grant, Yan Liu, Mimi Rhodes, Georgia Hall Charley Hull speaks to Sky. “I felt I was so under control … on 16 I hit a really nice tee shot with my rescue wood … the wind was howling off the left and I hit it pure … it just didn’t move a yard through the air … so I went in the bunker … I hit a lay-up shot but was pumped … I gave it a good run … there’s always next year! … I feel pretty good … I played pretty decent all week … I came in not confident … I’m pretty proud of myself.” Meanwhile it turns out that Hull is only second on the list of players with multiple runners-up finishes in the majors without a win. She’s on four, alongside Judy Rankin, Rosie Jones and Ruth Jessen, but behind Ayako Okamoto, who suffered like this on six occasions. … and so Miyū Yamashita becomes the second Japanese major winner this year. Her victory at the Women’s Open follows Mao Saigo’s triumph at the Chevron Championship back in May. She’s the sixth Japanese woman to win a major, after Chako Higuchi (1977 LPGA), Hinako Shibuno (2019 Women’s Open), Yuka Saso (2021 and 2024 US Open), Ayaka Furue (2024 Evian) and the aforementioned Mao Saigo. That is not bad company to be keeping. Miyū Yamashita, blinking back happy tears, clearly still processing her richly deserved major-championship breakthrough, continues. “The course is obviously very difficult … but in brilliant condition … the amount of support really pushed me to victory so this is for them as well … I’d like to thank everyone … my first win is very special … to celebrate with everyone is amazing … thank you!” Then it’s time for Miyū Yamashita – 24 years old yesterday, so happy birthday! – to lift the trophy. All smiles. So happy! Her first interview as a major champion begins. “To win such a historic tournament in front of all these amazing fans is such an incredible feeling … to have my family around me and have so much support is amazing … very special!” Miyū Yamashita checks the numbers on her card, and scribbles her name at the bottom of it. No Roberto-De-Vicenzo-infused errors today, please! Then she makes her way to the trophy presentation. R&amp;A Guy talks for a bit, thanking the folk he has to thank. But then it’s time to announce the results. First up, the Smyth Salver is awarded to Paula Martin Sampedro, the leading amateur with a score of 284. The brilliant young Spaniard, who made five birdies in a row earlier today, bounces up to collect her prize. Lottie Woad won it last year, so great things await! Props to Charley Hull, who once again has done so much to inject excitement into a Women’s Open, only to come up short. She’s now finished as runner-up at four majors, a record for someone who hasn’t won any. Surely her time will come. The pain of coming so close again will sting for a while, but once it subsides she’ll be proud: she certainly wasn’t expecting too much coming into this week, after illness and injury. Yes, she’ll be back. Hats off as well to Mimi Rhodes, who made that snooker-loopy ace on the 5th, caroming her ball off Steph Kyriacou’s, the Aussie becoming the first player in golf history to record a hole-in-one (she aced the 8th on Friday) and an assist for someone else’s ace at the same major. Traditionalists needn’t bother arguing the toss, because she did do that, so assists are a new thing now. Congratulations to Mimi and Steph! That was a glorious final round by Miyū Yamashita. Out in 33, steady all the way, with only the slightest of wobbles midway along the back nine. Even then, she made two huge par saves, at 13 and 14, to keep things going. Kim A-lim briefly joined her at the top, and Charley Hull launched one of her trademark chases, but each time they got close, Yamashita held her nerve and her position. Just the one dropped shot, on 17, and even that wasn’t too egregious. A thoroughly deserved victory for a player who came so close at last year’s PGA, but has now gone one better. Two careful putts, and Miyū Yamashita finishes with a round of 70. She’s the new Women’s Open champion golfer! She raises her arms in victory as her face crumples into joyful tears. Kim A-lim gives her a cuddle … and tips her water bottle down her back while doing so! All in the way of celebration, as her compatriots race onto the green with bottles of champagne, and soak her once again! -11: Yamashita (F) -9: Hull (F), Katsu (F) -7: Takeda (F), AL Kim (F) Miyū Yamashita whips a graceful wedge into the heart of 18. This is done. Kim A-lim nearly holes out for a valedictory eagle, but tidies up for birdie. A disappointing 73 and it’s easy to forget now, as she finishes at -7, that Kim briefly had co-ownership of the lead earlier this afternoon. The thing about Jean Van de Velde was, he didn’t bottle the 1999 Open. Sure, he ballsed it up in the grand style … but it wasn’t for the lack of moxie. He could have nudged his ball up the 18th at Carnoustie, but wanted to win the Open “like D’Artagnan”. Hats off to him for that, the man will forever be one of the great Open heroes.† So hats off also to Miyū Yamashita, who could take a careful iron out of the rough to take some greenside bunkers out of play, but instead lashes a wood for full effect. She tugs it a bit, and is fortunate to miss those aforementioned bunkers. But fortune favours the brave. The ball skips to the left of them, and she’ll have a wedge from light rough to reach the green in regulation. †: Winning’s not everything. Who still talks about Todd Hamilton? Miyū Yamashita isn’t risking the gorse down the right of 18. She favours the left-hand side of the fairway, and while her ball goes into the semi-rough, she’ll take that. Meanwhile up on the green, Minami Katsu makes birdie to finish with a 69. Unless her compatriot Yamashita collapses in the Jean Van de Velde style, she’ll finish in a tie for second with Charley Hull. Three of the top four are from Japan. -11: Yamashita (17) -9: Hull (F), Katsu (F) -7: Takeda (F) … and yet this isn’t quite over yet. Miyū Yamashita can’t make her par putt on 17, the ball always breaking low on the right-hand side, and that’s the leader’s first bogey of the day. What a time to make it. Bogey for Kim A-lim. -11: Yamashita (17) -9: Hull (F) -8: Katsu (17) -7: Takeda (F) Charley Hull lobs over the bunker at 18 to ten feet. A chance for a birdie to put pressure on Miyū Yamashita … but her putt is always missing left. Just a par, and she signs for a final round of 69. It promised more. Much more. But those bogeys at 16 and 17 were body blows she had no time to recover from. She ends the week at -9, the new clubhouse leader. She’ll most likely finish second at a major for the fourth time. Nobody has as many runner-up finishes on her CV without actually winning one. Now then. Miyū Yamashita is able to take a fairway wood to her ball from the rough down the left of 17. But she doesn’t catch it cleanly, pulling it further left. And though the ball clears a bunker, it nestles in some thick rough a few yards further on. Plenty to think about. So she takes her time before chipping … and swishes a fine wedge out to eight feet. It’s a decent outcome from where she was, but she’s got work to do to save her par. She’s made big putts on 13 and 14 to keep her card intact. Can she make another? Charley Hull has to take a shy for the green from the centre of 18. Her ball’s always carving off to the right, and ends up in the most awkward position, at the bottom of a depression behind a greenside bunker, with the pin only just over the back of the sand. Short-sided, with added undulations for extra misery. She walks up the fairway to gentle applause from a disappointed gallery; the player herself tries to put on a brave face but a smile doesn’t last long. By the looks of it, this will be another close-but-no-cigar story for Hull in the majors. … so having said that, Yamashita looks a little anxiously after her drive on 17. Her ball disappears into the rough down the left. It’s all about the lie. Meanwhile par on 18 for Rio Takeda, who finishes with a 71 and ends the week at -7. She’s the new clubhouse leader. Charley Hull arrives at 18 with very little to lose now. So she opens her shoulders, takes an aggressive line off the tree, and lashes a big boom down the fairway. It’s nearly rendered utterly futile by Miyū Yamashita, who is an inch or so away from curling in a 40-foot left-to-right swinger on 16. This has been such a sensational performance by Yamashita. Just no gap in the armour. No bogeys, that’s for sure. -12: Yamashita (16) -9: Hull (17) -8: Katsu (16) -7: Takeda (17), AL Kim (16) -6: Hsu (F) Charley Hull leaves her putt from the fringe at the back of 17 ten feet short. The par putt’s always missing to the left, and that’s back-to-back bogeys at exactly the wrong time. Her bid’s almost kaput. An eagle up the last is pretty much necessary now if she’s to apply any real pressure on Miyū Yamashita … but the leader swipes her second at 16 into the green. On in regulation, and she’s yet to make a bogey today. Hull will most likely need Yamashita’s wheels to come clanking off, and that just doesn’t look likely. Meanwhile we have a new clubhouse leader in Hsu Wei-ling, who birdies 18 to sign for a 70 and end her week at -6. -12: Yamashita (15) -9: Hull (17) -8: Katsu (16) -7: Takeda (17), AL Kim (15) -6: Hsu (F) Miyū Yamashita sends a gentle draw into the par-three 15th. She’s got a 12-foot left-to-right curler to make a birdie that would surely seal the deal, but while her putt looks like dropping, it stops the width of one dimple to the left of the hole. She taps in for par, then swishes a nerveless drive down the middle of 16. Yamashita was driving wild yesterday; whatever she did on the range last night has clearly fixed whatever problem there was. Charley Hull most likely needs something coming in, and holes are running out. So it’s not good news that she sends her tee shot at 17 into the rough down the left. She’s got to go for it … and fizzes her second into the heart of the green. It’s another slightly hot one, and the ball bounces off the back, but there’s no swale so she can putt from the fringe. … but it’s not costly, because she gathers herself and rolls in the one coming back! From the ridiculous to the sublime! Another fine par save, to follow the as-nails putt on 13. Kim A-lim rolls in her bogey putt, some damage-limitation of her own, but she’s four behind again. And up on 16, Charley Hull leaves her chip up from the back of the green the best part of 20 feet short. Double-bogey disaster awaits … but then she strokes in the gentle left-to-right slider. More damage limitation! Yamashita’s closest rivals going backwards, but it could have been so much worse, and this Open isn’t quite done and dusted yet. -12: Yamashita (14) -10: Hull (16) -8: Katsu (15), AL Kim (14) Charley Hull gets a flyer out of the rough, and her ball scampers over the back of the 16th green. She’ll need to get up and down from the swale to restrict the damage to par. Kim A-lim leaves her monster par putt five feet short. And then Miyū Yamashita, putting for birdie from 35 feet, completely misreads her putt. Six feet wide and ten past! What an absurd rush of blood … Kim A-lim’s ball has rebounded into filthy rough on 14. She does well to muscle the ball out and into the front of the green, but she’s a long way from the hole, and faces a long two putts just for bogey. Meanwhile over on 16, Charley Hull whips her ball out of the fairway bunker, but sends it into rough down the other side of the hole. She grabs a break, in so much as the grass has been trampled down by the gallery. But she’s now got to get up and down from 100 yards to save her par. While it all whirls around, Miyū Yamashita waits patiently. The wind is behind Miyū Yamashita again. She finds the 14th green in regulation, while Kim A-lim hits the face of a fairway bunker, sending her ball pinging back into deep rough. Charley Hull meanwhile finds fairway sand of her own, down the left of 16. A few minutes ago, Yamashita was in danger of relinquishing her lead. But she scrambled a par, while Kim narrowly missed an eagle putt and Hull left her birdie effort short. And now look. Charley Hull gets a bit tentative with the putter again. Her birdie effort on 15 is always missing on the low side, and never reaching. Not the easiest putt, to be fair, with a fair bit of left-to-right break. Meanwhile Steph Kyriacou joins Paula Martin Sampedro and Lottie Woad in the clubhouse lead at -4. She signs for a one-under round of 71, which is no mean feat having triple-bogeyed the opening hole, sending one ball out of bounds and nearly repeating the trick with her next shot. Also the near-miss ace at 5, that turned into an assist for Mimi Rhodes to make one of her own. Ah well, she’ll always have the hole-in-one she made at 8 on Friday. Charley Hull on the 144-yard downhill par-three 15th. She’s not made birdie on this hole this week … yet. But despite flirting with the pot bunker to the right, she sets up a chance here, landing her ball ten feet from the flag. Meanwhile back on 12, Kim A-lim nearly drains her eagle putt, but it stays out on the left. She taps in for birdie. Over to the leader Miyū Yamashita, who can only chip up from her downhill lie at the bottom of the swale to 15 feet. But she makes the left-to-right slider. Nerveless. That could have been a three-shot swing between herself and Kim; it’s just one. It could also have cost her sole ownership of the lead; she’s still got it. But this is so close now. Good luck calling it! -12: Yamashita (13) -11: Hull (14) -9: AL Kim (13) -8: Katsu (13) -7: Takeda (15) Charley Hull applies extra pressure! She whips out of the thick rough down the side of 14, finding the centre of the green. That’s a fine shot to extricate herself from trouble, and set up an outside chance of birdie … which she converts! In goes the 30-footer, and this is really hotting up now! -12: Yamashita (12) -11: Hull (14) -8: Katsu (13), AL Kim (12) -7: Takeda (15) … and these could turn out to be big moments in the race for the title! Because Kim A-lim then creams her fairway wood, shot two, into the heart of 13, and uses the camber to gather her ball towards the flag, back-right. She’ll have a look at eagle from 12 feet or so. That’s a sensational shot, and the pressure’s now on Miyū Yamashita, who faces a job to get up and down for par. A potential big swing could be upcoming. Rio Takeda nearly inserts herself into serious contention … but her 15-foot, left-to-right birdie slider lips out. How did that not drop?! She remains at -7. Meanwhile the leader Miyū Yamashita will have some work to do on the par-five 13th. She takes her medicine from the fairway bunker, chipping out sideways, then lashes her third into the green … only for the ball to topple off down a swale to the left. She’s ended up on a downslope as well. That will be super-tricky. The new sensation Lottie Woad – one of the pre-tournament favourites despite this being only her second (!) professional start – gets up and down from the wrong side of a greenside bunker on 18. Having been short-sided, that’s a lovely chip with putt to match. She’s not had her best stuff this week, especially struggling with the putter, and yet she ends the day with a 71 and an overall mark of -4. Surrey’s finest joins the amateur Paula Martin Sampedro in the clubhouse lead. She’s a phenomenon. One day, all this will be hers. Miyū Yamashita’s problems during yesterday’s 74 were all down to her erratic driving. She looked to have the big stick under control today, but now she sends her tee shot at 13 into a bunker down the left. Problems from the tee for Charley Hull, as well, as she carves her drive into thick muck down the right of 14. Charley Hull’s bunker shot on 13: short and tentative. Her subsequent long birdie putt: short and tentative. Miyū Yamashita’s birdie putt on 12: short and tentative. Kim A-lim’s birdie putt on 12: short and tentative. Par, par, par. The nerves beginning to kick in on major-championship Sunday. -12: Yamashita (12) -10: Hull (13) -8: Katsu (12), AL Kim (12) -7: Takeda (14) Charley Hull’s second at the par-five 13th trickles into a bunker 30 yards short of the green. She’s left with a long sand shot coming in. Meanwhile back on the par-three 12th, Miyū Yamashita and Kim A-lim both find the heart of the green, leaving themselves birdie chances from mid-range. Big moments coming up. From her position halfway up 11, Miyū Yamashita can see Charley Hull making her birdie up on 12. It doesn’t faze her. She whistles her second into the heart of the green en route to a fuss-free par. It’s par for Kim A-lim as well, but in less conventional style. Kim’s approach finds a deep bunker to the right of the green. She doesn’t get particularly close with her splash out, but makes the six-footer that remains. The ball performs the loop-de-loop, all the way around the rim of the cup before dropping. In. Just. When it disappears, Kim gives the air a little punch. She knows how important that was. She’s hanging on in there at -8, four behind the leader. Minami Katsu makes it three birdies in six holes! She walks in a 30-footer on 11, a left-to-right slinger that brings her up to -8. Momentarily on Charley Hull’s shoulder … but then Hull tickles in her own left-to-right birdie putt, and the lead is back to just two! -12: Yamashita (10) -10: Hull (12) -8: Katsu (11), AL Kim (10) -7: Takeda (12) -6: Khang (12), A Lee (11) … but Charley Hull needs to make some sort of move, before it’s too late, as she can’t depend on Miyū Yamashita to capitulate. Her long game is still on point, and here she is firing another dart at the flag, this time at the par-three 12th. She’ll have another good look at birdie. Charley Hull sends another average wedge into the green, this time at 11. She’s pin high but well left of the target, and faces a tricky left-to-right breaker over a ridge. She doesn’t make a particularly good fist of the putt, which is always sailing wide right. She’s left with a tricky six-footer for her par … but she makes it. A crucial putt, that one, because par is slightly disappointing considering where she was chipping into the green from; bogey would have been a disaster. She remains at -9 … and there’s some good news for her back on 10, where Miyū Yamashita and Kim A-lim take turns to miss makeable birdie putts. It’s as you were at the top, albeit with everyone one hole closer to home. Charley Hull’s slightly jittery greenside play on 9 and 10 could prove costly, because Miyū Yamashita is going along very nicely. She reaches the par-three 9th in two, and though the monster eagle putt never looks like dropping, it’s a birdie, and she hits the turn in 33. No blemishes on her card today; the nerves she admitted to suffering yesterday appear to have been banished. For now, at least. Kim A-lim also birdies 9, but she’s turning in level-par 36. Meanwhile Rio Takeda rakes in a monster for birdie at 11, then picks up another shot at 12 after knocking her tee shot to three feet, and she’s now one of three Japanese players in with a shout of the title. -12: Yamashita (9) -9: Hull (10) -8: AL Kim (9) -7: Takeda (12), Katsu (9) The 2023 runner-up Charley Hull – who also has second-place major-championship finishes at the Dinah Shore (2016) and the US Open (2023) on her resumé – fires a dart into 10. It’s an aggressive play, because there’s only a small landing area near the pin, and a big downhill slope just behind it. But then she gets super-tentative with a pretty straight and flat eight-footer for birdie, and that’s a second disappointing par in a row. A strange mix of carpe-diem swashbuckle and tentative stuff around the green. Minami Katsu moves into red figures for her round by walking in a 25-footer on 9. The birdie means she turns in 35, and rises to -7. Her playing partner Andrea Lee lips out, though, and remains at -6. Not sure how that one didn’t drop. A sense that it’s simply not going to be Lee’s week; she was super-unfortunate yesterday afternoon when the pin irritatingly stopped her holing out from greenside sand for birdie at 15. The small margins between being right in the thick of it, and just off the pace. Here’s more on that astonishing ace at the 5th by Mimi Rhodes, courtesy of our man at Porthcawl, Ewan Murray. You can also enjoy it in the popular modern clip form. … so having just said that, another Pulitzer bid goes down the swanny as Kim A-lim makes bounce-back birdie on the 95-yard par-three 8th. She walks in a ten-footer, but she’s still four off the lead because Miyū Wamashita does exactly the same. The birdie extends her lead to two strokes, as up on the par-five 9th, Charley Hull leaves herself a bit too much to do with an uncharacteristically average wedge from a promising position. The birdie putt comes up short as well. A good chance spurned. -11: Yamashita (8) -9: Hull (9) -7: AL Kim (8) -6: A Lee (8), Katsu (8) Kim A-lim’s game looks to have deserted her. A short par putt rolls by the hole at 7, and suddenly, at -6, she’s four behind the leader Miyū Yamashita. Kim was joint leader not much more than an hour ago. Meanwhile Hsu Wei-ling’s momentum stalls with bogey at 10. -10: Yamashita (7) -9: Hull (8) -6: A Lee (8), Katsu (8), AL Kim (7) Hsu Wei-ling reaches the turn in 34. The 30-year-old from Taiwan doesn’t have much of a record in the majors, but one of her two top-ten finishes came just a couple of months ago at the PGA. Now she’s closing in on another. Having opened bogey-bogey, Hsu has since birdied 4 and 9, and eagled 6. She’s -6. Charley’s Charge is on! The short par-three 8th is playing just 95 yards today. Hull doesn’t wedge her tee shot particularly close, but she makes the 15-foot putt she leaves herself. Just. The right-hand side of the cup grabs enough of the ball just as it threatens to kink wide. That’s three birdies in four holes, and the crowd sense something is brewing. They sensed it at Walton Heath a couple of years ago as well, only for Hull to fall short in the end; perhaps that experience will stand the popular English star in good stead this time round. -10: Yamashita (6) -9: Hull (8) -7: AL Kim (6) Kim A-lim’s left-to-right birdie attempt on 6 stubbornly refuses to drop. That opens the door for Miyū Yamashita, but the leader also fails to give her birdie putt enough juice. The last group remain at -7 and -10 respectively. Meanwhile on 13, small jets of steam come out of Lottie Woad’s ears. Having started bogey-bogey, she’d clawed herself back to where she started (-3) with birdies at 8 and 9. But she’s since missed good birdie chances at 10 and 11, and now fails to make a short par putt on 12. Her flat stick failing her at exactly the wrong time, she walks off the green by throwing her ball into the air, then catching it with a wild swipe. Not happy. She’s -2. Charley Hull is a couple of joules of energy shy of three birdies in a row. Her right-to-left slider from 30 feet on 7 stops just short. Meanwhile Kim A-lim finds a fairway bunker down the left of the par-five 6th, then slaps her attempted escape into the face of the trap. The ball still pings back out onto the grass, though, and she takes full advantage of her good fortune, whip-cracking a wood into the heart of the green, a gentle draw setting up chance of bounce-back birdie. She’ll have a look from 25 feet. Charley Hull loves the chase. “It’s quite fun,” she said after yesterday’s entertaining 66. “I like it. It’s more fun that way. I like hunting someone down.” And she’s doing just that. Having negotiated Porthcawl’s brutal opening four holes in level par, she’s now pressing the pedal to the floor. She follows the aforementioned birdie at 5 by finding the par-five 6th in two big lashes, then nearly draining the long eagle putt. She taps in for back-to-back birdies, and is now firmly positioned in Miyū Yamashita’s rear-view mirror. -10: Yamashita (5) -8: Hull (6) -7: AL Kim (5) -6: Katsu (6), A Lee (5) Kim A-lim is beginning to look frustrated. She hasn’t worked out the pace of the greens at all. She leaves her uphill birdie putt at 5 short, and harrumphs as she tidies up for par. Her mood may be slightly improved by Miyū Yamashita pushing her six-foot birdie attempt wide right, then nearly missing the tiddler coming back, but the left-hand side of the cup grabs enough of the ball for it to drop. Yamashita admitted that nerves got the better of her during yesterday’s 74; don’t be totally surprised if they kick in again as she looks to close this out. A big change at the top. Birdie for Miyū Yamashita on 4 as she rolls in a 15-footer. But it’s a dropped shot for her playing partner Kim A-lim, who comes up short with a bunker shot and misses the par saver on the low side. All of a sudden, there’s a three-stroke buffer for the 24-year-old from Japan, who came close at the PGA last year, as one of three runners-up behind Amy Yang, and is now on course to go one better and land her first major title. -10: Yamashita (4) -7: Hull (5), AL Kim (4) -6: A Lee (5) Paula Martin Sampedro was going round with last year’s champion Lydia Ko. The Kiwi also birdies the last, and finishes the defence of her title with a round of 75, +3 overall. … and she does it in style, getting up and down from a greenside bunker at 18 for birdie! That’s her sixth on the back nine, after that five-in-a-row run between 11 and 15, and she’s played it in 30 strokes. A closing round of 68, and she ends the week at -4. Expect more big things from the 20-year-old Spaniard; recent winners include Leona Maguire, Atthaya Thitikul, Rose Zhang and Lottie Woad. Minami Katsu makes a wonder-par on 4. Her tee shot at 4 looks to be snap-hooking out of bounds, but hits a steward and stays on the property. She zig-zags her way up the hole, and finds herself in a swale to the right of the green. You know the rest: she rakes in her Texas Wedge, and remains at -5. Meanwhile birdie for Charley Hull at 5, her first move of the day at the beginning of a kinder run of holes. She’s -7, and properly in the hunt now. So much for that advantage. Kim A-lim sends her long birdie putt six feet past, then fails to hit the one coming back. Her ball stops on the edge and stubbornly refuses to drop, despite the wind whipping in from the Bristol Channel. Miyū Yamashita meanwhile chips up to five feet, and tidies up for a battling par, her one-shot lead at the top restored. -9: Yamashita (3) -8: AL Kim (3) -6: Hull (4) -5: Takeda (5), Khang (4), A Lee (3), Katsu (3) Kim A-lim wallops her drive at 3 straight down the middle. She’s way longer than her playing partner Miyū Yamashita, who needs a fairway wood to reach the green. Yamashita sends her second into thick grass to the right of the dancefloor. Kim meanwhile, requiring only an 8-iron, carefully finds the centre of the green. Advantage Kim. Birdies are precious, of course, but the bulk of evidence suggests that today is all about the struggle, the scramble, and not going backwards. We’re tied at the top. Kim A-lim lands her second into 2 ten feet past the flag, then spins it back to six. She rolls in the birdie putt, and joins her playing partner Miyū Yamashita at -9. A clumsy three-putt bogey for Megan Khang on 3, meanwhile, and the top of the leaderboard thins out a little more. -9: Yamashita (2), AL Kim (2) -6: Hull (3) -5: Takeda (4), Khang (3), A Lee (2), Katsu (2) -4: SY Kim (10), Rhodes (7), H Kim (6) Paula Martin Sampredo is going to win the Silver Salver for low amateur. She’s -3 overall with just a couple of holes to play, and the next-best amateur is Carla Bernat, in the hutch at +9. So on the one hand, you could say this particular race is anti-climactic … except that the 20-year-old Spaniard, who won the Women’s Amateur Championship in June at Nairn, has made five birdies in a row on the back nine, between 11 and 15. What is it with Spanish swashbucklers and the Open? An opening bogey for Andrea Lee. Then the final pairing take to the course, with Kim A-lim and Miyū Yamashita parring the opening hole. Suddenly there’s a little bit of separation at the top of the leaderboard. Meanwhile Kim Sei-young rapidly undoes exactly half of all her good work on the front nine, with double bogey at 10. She slips back to -4, and that’s golf in a nutshell. -9: Yamashita (1) -8: AL Kim (1) -6: Hull (2), Khang (2) This will sound utterly preposterous, but there’s a reasonable chance we’ll see another ace at the par-three 5th today. Kim Hyojoo and Ariya Jutanugarn nearly combine to replicate the antics of Steph Kyriacou and Mimi Rhodes, Kim knocking her tee shot to kick-in distance, Jutanugarn then doing the same. But her ball doesn’t cannon in for an ace, stopping just short instead. Those odds perhaps not so infinitesimal after all. The pin’s certainly in a spot where the camber of the green gathers the ball. No pressure on the groups that follow, then, but having seen four shots in a row pepper the flag, one of them dropping for an ace, the other three less than the width of a ball away from doing so, the gallery expect! While all that bedlam was unfolding, Charley Hull was battering a huge drive down the middle of 1, finding a pot bunker with her approach, then swishing out of it to close range, saving her par. And up on 9, it’s yet another birdie for Kim Sei-young. She’s out in 32, proof that a score can be made out there, despite the conditions. She’s -6. Mimi Rhodes is making her Open debut this week. The 24-year-old from Bath already has three wins on the European Tour to her name this year, at the NSW Open, the Joburg Open, and the Dutch Open. She’ll not be adding the British title to her resumé, not this year anyway, but she’s made her mark here nonetheless. And in spectacular circumstances. First up, on the tee at the 184-yard par-three 5th, Steph Kyriacou, who whips her iron straight at the flag. It’s rolling towards the cup … but on it’s very last rotation, the ball turns to the left and stops at the side of the hole. Rhodes takes her turn, and sends an almost identical shot straight at the pin. This one’s going to miss the hole on the left … but it doesn’t miss Kyriacou’s ball, and kisses off it, snooker style, and in for an ace! That’s an outrageous sequence of events! Odds infinitesimal! Rhodes points to herself in disbelief, as if to ask: was that my ball that went in? And also: did that really happen?!?! Yep! She high-fives with Kyriacou, the pair grinning with delight. As Rhodes continues to cavort, Kyriacou walks off towards the green and shares a theatrical – and extremely good-humoured – joke with her caddie, both waving their arms in the dash-darn-god-damn-it fashion. You’ll be seeing all of that again. Delightful. (Almost An Afterthought dept. Rhodes is back up to -4.) … so there’s not a great deal of upward movement on the leaderboard, but the 2020 PGA champion Kim Sei-young is showing it can be done. Birdies for the 32-year-old South Korean at 5, 6 and 7, and it’s nearly four in a row as her 25-footer shaves the lip on the par-three 8th. That one’s not to be, but she’s whistled up the standings to -5. Time for the first leaderboard update of the day, then. -9: Yamashita -8: AL Kim -7: Lee -6: Katsu, Hull, Khang -5: SY Kim (8), Takeda (1) Early trouble for the 2018 champion Georgia Hall. The 29-year-old AFC Bournemouth fan finds thick rough down the left from the centre of 1, and can’t chop out onto the green. She’s left with a long putt from the fringe for par. It’s asking too much, and that’s a shot dropped immediately due to an unforced error. She’s -4. Meanwhile a three-putt bogey for her playing partner Rio Takeda; she’s now -5. The gallery muted as they witness the 22nd and 23rd bogeys at this hole today. Lottie Woad isn’t the only big name heading in the wrong direction early doors. The wind is whipping right to left across the 1st fairway, and it’s causing all manner of problems. The 2016 champion Ariya Jutanugarn sets her opening tee shot out to the right, hoping for a mix of wind and draw to bring it back. It doesn’t come. Into a gorse bush she goes. Reload, and that leads to a triple-bogey seven. She then drops another at 2, and in a flash, she drops 18 places on the leaderboard to +1, any faint hopes of glory gone. It’s a similar story for Steph Kyriacou, who sends her second at 1 out of bounds on the left, then nearly does it again with her second ball. Another triple-bogey seven, and following bogey at 3, she’s +1 as well. It’s been a poor start for golf’s hottest property, the new Irish and Scottish Open champion Lottie Woad. The 21-year-old from Surrey won the Smyth Salver for low amateur at St Andrews last year, finishing in a tie for tenth, but a similarly high finish might already be beyond her this time round. Woad bogeys 1, the result of hooking her approach from the centre of the fairway miles left, then drops another at 2 thanks to a three-putt. Her radar is a bit skew-whiff on 4 as well, as she misreads a long birdie putt, but she’s able to tidy up for a par that keeps her at -1 overall. Conditions haven’t been great for the early starters. It’s been raining, and blowing a hoolie. As a result, there hasn’t been much forward momentum on display. So far there are only two players back in the clubhouse with a score under par: Shannon Tan, who ends the week at +5 after her 70, and the 2013 champion Stacy Lewis, who shot 71 to finish her tournament at +7. The 65s and 66s of earlier in the week something of a pipe dream right now … and although it’s since stopped raining, with temperatures forecast to rise a bit during the afternoon, the wind’s likely to stay up. Good luck to one and all. It’s not called Moving Day for nothing. After 36 holes, the top of the leaderboard at the 49th Women’s Open looked like this … -11: Miyū Yamashita -8: Rio Takeda -4: Pajaree Anannarukarn, Lindy Duncan, Laura Fünfstück, Chiara Tamburlini … and it was beginning to look like the first major to ever be held at Royal Porthcawl was either going to turn into either a procession or a mano-a-mano battle. But then after yesterday’s third round, the top of the leaderboard looked like this … -9: Miyū Yamashita -8: Kim A-lim -7: Andrea Lee -6: Minami Katsu, Charley Hull, Megan Khang, Rio Takeda -4: Georgia Hall, Hsu Wei-ling, Chiara Tamburlini -3: Mao Saigo, Ariya Jutanugarn, Kim Hyojoo, Steph Kyriacou, Mimi Rhodes, Lottie Woad … and, well, OK, Yamashita is still in pole position. But after her two-over round of 74, 67s for Kim A-lim and Andrea Lee, a 66 for Charley Hull and 65 for Minami Katsu, an awful lot of quality big-name players are suddenly on her shoulder. Lydia Ko came roaring through the pack at St Andrews to claim the title last year; there are plenty of stars who’ll fancy their chances of performing the very same trick today. Yamashita – who admitted to feeling nervous while leading from the front yesterday – will hope to rediscover her confident 65-shooting Friday self and bag her first major title. It’s all set up so deliciously. Here are the final few tee times (BST). It’s on! 1.50pm: Georgia Hall, Rio Takeda 2pm: Megan Khang, Charley Hull 2.10pm: Minami Katsu, Andrea Lee 2.20pm: Kim A-lim, Miyū Yamashita
