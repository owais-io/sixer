  Tourist trails have been closed on Mount Vesuvius in southern Italy as
  firefighters tackle a huge blaze on the volcano’s slopes, while officials
  warned of another “challenging day” for those working to contain France’s
  biggest wildfire since 1949. The wildfire on Mount Vesuvius, close to Naples,
  broke out a few days ago and by Saturday afternoon had stretched to about 3km
  (1.9 miles) wide, destroying hundreds of hectares of woodland and killing wild
  animals. Thick smoke could be seen from Pompeii and Naples. Six Canadair
  firefighting planes have been dispatched from the state fleet and teams made
  up of firefighters, soldiers, forestry corps, police and civil protection
  volunteers from across Italy are working on the ground. Drones were being used
  to monitor the spread of the fire, the national fire service said. The
  operation has been complicated by the latest heatwave. Vesuvius national park
  authorities said the volcano’s trail network had been closed for safety
  reasons and to facilitate firefighting and clean-up operations in the areas
  affected. Pompeii’s archaeological park remains open to the public. The fire
  has mainly affected the Terzigno pine forest as well as woodlands close to the
  small towns of Trecase, Ercolano and Ottaviano at the foot of the volcano.
  Francesco Ranieri, the mayor of Terzigno, told Italian media the situation on
  Saturday night was “very critical” although the efforts of firefighters
  ensured the flames did not reach any homes. The cause of the fire has not been
  identified although there are strong suspicions that it was arson, with
  Ranieri suggesting there may be “a criminal hand” behind it. Firefighters in
  France’s southern Aude region, meanwhile, have managed to contain a massive
  wildfire, which killed one person and injured several others, although
  authorities warned that work on Sunday would be complicated by intense heat
  and a hot, dry wind. “It’s a challenging day, given that we are likely to be
  on red alert for heatwave from 6pm, which will not make things any easier,”
  said Christian Pouget, the prefect of the Aude department. Europe is far from
  alone in suffering frequent wildfires. The weather conditions in which they
  flourish, marked by heat, drought and strong winds, is increasing in some
  parts of all continents. Human-caused climate breakdown is responsible for a
  higher likelihood of fire and bigger burned areas in southern Europe, northern
  Eurasia, the US and Australia, with some scientific evidence of increases in
  southern China. Climate breakdown has increased the wildfire season by about
  two weeks on average across the globe.
