  The Republican attorney general of Texas on Friday asked the state supreme
  court to vacate the seats of 13 Democratic legislators who have left for blue
  states, hours after their absence once again delayed a vote on a redrawn
  congressional map sought by Donald Trump. Republican leaders in Texas had set
  a Friday deadline for Democrats to return to the state capitol in Austin or
  face punishment, including arrest and possible removal from office. Dozens of
  Democrats left the state over the weekend to prevent a Republican
  redistricting effort, requested by the president, to redraw the Texas maps
  mid-cycle, as part of an effort to secure a Republican House majority in the
  2026 midterms. The aggressive redistricting effort has set off a chain
  reaction in other states, including California, where the governor has vowed
  to retaliate with a congressional map that would “nullify” the Republican
  effort to redraw five Democratic-held districts in Texas. On Friday, the
  Democratic leaders of the California state legislature said they were prepared
  to move forward with a ballot measure asking voters to redraw the state’s
  House map in November should Texas follow through with its proposed
  redistricting plan. “We don’t move unless they move,” California governor
  Gavin Newsom said at a news conference in Sacramento, where he was joined by a
  delegation of Democratic state representatives from Texas. “But we’re not
  going to unilaterally disarm.” The California appearance capped a dramatic
  day, as the quorum-breaking Democrats faced a flurry of new legal and
  financial threats from Texas Republicans. On Thursday John Cornyn, the Texas
  Republican senator, said the FBI had agreed to assist in locating the
  Democrats, but the FBI declined to comment and it is unclear what authority
  federal law enforcement would have, as they are not charged with federal
  crimes. On Friday morning, police responded to a second bomb threat at the
  suburban Chicago hotel housing several Texas Democrats who sought refuge in
  Illinois. Yet the Democrats have remained defiant. “Make no mistake about it,
  we are running from nothing,” Ann Johnson, a Democratic state representative
  from Texas, said during the news conference with Newsom. “We see the danger
  that is coming, and we are running straight for it.” During the short house
  session on Friday, the Texas house speaker, Dustin Burrows, said state
  authorities were working to make civil arrest warrants against the Democrats
  enforceable outside Texas. He also said the legislature was withholding the
  Democrats’ direct-deposit payments, requiring absent members to pick them up
  in person at the capitol in Austin. “Each one of you knows that eventually you
  will come back,” he said, addressing the absent Democrats from the chamber
  floor. “But with each passing day, the political cost of your absence is
  rising, and it will be paid in full.” It came after Burrows moved to enforce
  arrest warrants in other states and as Greg Abbott, the Texas governor, warned
  in an interview with NBC News that he was prepared to “arrest Democrats who
  may be in Texas, may be elsewhere”. In a statement, the Texas attorney
  general, Ken Paxton, a far-right ally of the president, argued that 13 absent
  Democratic lawmakers should be removed from office for having “deliberately
  sabotaged the constitutional process and violated the oath they swore to
  uphold”. Paxton also announced on Friday that he was suing the Texas Democrat
  Beto O’Rourke for “unlawful fundraising activity” on behalf of the
  out-of-state lawmakers. On X, O’Rourke said that his political group, Powered
  by People, had responded by suing Paxton in state court. Late on Friday, a
  Texas judge, Megan Fahey, granted Paxton’s request to issue a temporary
  restraining order barring O’Rourke and Powered by People from covering the
  personal expenses of the Democratic lawmakers, including fines, ruling that
  the state would be “irreparably injured” if funds raised raised for political
  spending were used for “non-political purposes”. The elected state judge, who
  was first appointed by Abbott, is also the president of the Fort Worth
  Republican Women’s Club and a member of the conservative Federalist Society.
  The Texas lawmakers have seen a surge of support from fellow Democrats and
  donors across the country, who have praised them for holding the line against
  the president’s attempted “power grab”. While declining to say how long they
  were prepared to hold out, several members insisted they remained fully
  committed to blocking what Johnson called an “off the rails” Republican
  majority from succeeding with its redistricting plan in Texas. But Abbott has
  said that they would have to stay away for years to be successful. The current
  special legislative session, called by the Texas governor, lasts until 19
  August, but Abbott has vowed to call “special session after special session
  after special session”. “But I’ll tell you this also, Democrats act like
  they’re not going to come back as long as this is an issue,” Abbott said in
  the NBC News interview. “That means they’re not going to come back until like
  2027 or 2028, because I’m going to call special session after special session
  after special session with the same agenda items on there.” In a separate
  interview, he said he might push for more than five seats. “What I’m thinking
  now is that if they don’t start showing up, I may start expanding,” he said.
  “We may make it six or seven or eight new seats we’re going to be adding on
  the Republican side.” Tensions have escalated dramatically since the Democrats
  left Texas and sought refuge in Democratic states. Abbott also took the
  extraordinary step of filing a lawsuit with the state supreme court that seeks
  to remove Gene Wu, the house Democratic leader, from office. In a legal filing
  responding to Abbott’s emergency petition, attorneys for Wu emphasized the
  “long history” of quorum-breaking in Texas, and argued that request to remove
  an elected official from office is not a question for the courts under the
  state constitution. “So much in our politics seems to be about power for its
  own sake, whatever the cost,” Wu’s attorneys wrote in the brief. “That cost
  may finally be too high today. This court should refuse to pay it.” Burrows
  said on Friday: “For those who have fled to Illinois or California, be
  reminded that the FBI’s assistance has reportedly been enlisted and their
  powers are not confined to a single state’s boundaries.” One Democratic member
  of the Texas state house, Claudia Ordaz, said in a statement that state
  troopers had showed up at a relative’s home looking for her, even though she
  had stated publicly she was dealing with a “personal health matter”. In the
  statement, which Ordaz said she was sharing from a hospital waiting room, she
  denounced the officers’ visit as a “deliberate abuse of power and an
  intimidation tactic”. She also criticized those she said had “falsely accused”
  her of being present in the chamber to help Republicans make a quorum. In
  Sacramento on Friday, US congresswoman Zoe Lofgren said every Democratic
  member of the state’s congressional delegation supported the California ballot
  initiative. “We cannot stand here and just shrug as Trump and the Republicans
  try and rig the rules so they can avoid responsibility for the damage that
  they have done to this country,” she said. “We need a break on them, and we
  can get it in the midterm elections.”
