  I moved to Stockholm from London for work a decade ago. As a newcomer with a
  passion for nature, I remember being eager to soak up the region’s archipelago
  of 30,000 islands and rocky outposts. But I was overwhelmed by complex public
  ferry timetables to dozens of places ending in the letter “ö” (the Swedish
  word for island) and uninterested in pricey cruise boats packed with tour
  groups. Then a former flatmate recommended Nynäshamn, which is on the mainland
  but embodies much of the nature and spirit of Stockholm’s archipelago. It’s
  home to a tasteful waterfront of colourfully painted bars and restaurants and
  a harbour packed with boats every summer, from simple dinghies to luxury
  yachts. Beyond, you can look across a clean, calm stretch of Baltic Sea,
  towards the island of Bedarön, flanked by pine trees and a smattering of dark
  red detached houses. Mention Nynäshamn to Stockholmers and most will probably
  describe it as the port you pass through to catch the four-hour ferry to
  Gotland – Sweden’s largest island – or an overnight cruise to Gdańsk in
  Poland. But for international tourists (or new Swedish residents, as I was),
  it is an entry-level coastal destination where you can get a taste of the
  city’s island life without the complex logistics. Nynäshamn is on the commuter
  rail line from central Stockholm, and reachable in an hour. A one-way journey
  costs 43 kronor (£3.30), or it’s free if you have a valid monthly or weekly
  pass for the capital’s public transport system. For a little more adventure,
  it takes a further 30 minutes to reach Nåttarö, the closest island accessible
  by a public ferry service (£8 each way). My first destination in Nynäshamn is
  Trehörningen, an island suburb accessible by bridge, and just a 30-minute
  stroll from the train station. The route takes in a mishmash of glassy
  new-build apartments, low-rise 1960s rent-controlled flats and mansions with
  manicured gardens. Nynäshamn doesn’t have the swagger of swankier seaside
  towns in the region, such as Sandhamn or Saltsjöbaden, but it offers a slice
  of real-life small town Sweden far removed from the well-trodden tourist
  itineraries that typically lead to Stockholm’s medieval Old Town or isolated
  rural retreats. “It’s very good for my health,” says Hans “Hasse” Larsson, a
  smiley 73-year-old former truck driver who moved to Nynäshamn from Stockholm
  16 years ago. He enjoys the clean air and quiet lifestyle, and describes a
  stronger sense of community compared with the somewhat stiffer Swedish
  capital. “Even if you don’t know people very well, you’ll say ‘hej’!” he
  laughs. Sweden isn’t a budget destination, but thanks to a favourable exchange
  rate, prices aren’t extortionate compared with those in popular British
  seaside destinations I’ve visited, such as Brighton or St Ives. On
  Trehörningen island, it costs from just over £100 a night to rent a compact
  wooden cottage for two from Oskarsgatan 12 B&amp;B. A breakfast buffet and spa
  entry package at the nearby Nynäs Havsbad hotel works out at around £45. The
  spa’s pavilion is a reconstruction of an art nouveau-inspired resort built in
  1906, complete with an outdoor hot tub, a sauna and panoramic views. The hotel
  complex includes original buildings from the early 20th century, when it was a
  base for sailors during the 1912 Stockholm Olympic Games. From here, it’s a
  short walk to Strandvägen, a French riviera-inspired waterfront road built for
  spectators of sailing. As locals will proudly tell you, it is the only place
  in the Stockholm archipelago region where you can see the horizon from the
  mainland. The scenic route winds towards Lövhagen, a wooded area offering
  shady trails and picnic tables. There are rocky swimming coves too – although,
  with average outdoor temperatures of 18C in July and August, the chilly waters
  won’t be to everyone’s taste. For walkers, Nynäshamn is also a gateway to
  Sörmlandsleden, a system of hiking trails covering around 620 miles in total
  and clearly marked with orange arrows and painted tree markers. Section 5:1
  from Nynäshamn passes through mossy forests and grassy farmland to the village
  of Osmö, where you can catch a train back to Nynäshamn or continue another
  nine miles to Hemfosa, snaking past Lake Muskan’s glistening waters. Back at
  Nynäshamn’s main harbour, the restaurants are filling up with tourists hungry
  for lunch. The most famous spot is Nynäs Rökeri, a smokehouse dating back
  almost 40 years, where a platter of smoked salmon, seafood and potato salad
  costs less than £20. The adjacent delicatessen stocks fresh fish and classic
  Swedish treats, from cheesy västerbotten pie to crispbreads and lingonberry
  jam. A nearby courtyard is shared with customers visiting the ice-cream store
  Lejonet &amp; Björnen, a small cafe and a gift shop. The sweet smell of
  cinnamon wafts in the air and I spot the familiar logo of Skeppsbro Bageri, an
  award-winning Stockholm bakery that has a food truck parked on the waterfront,
  packed with fresh bread, buns and pastries. “I like it here,” says Emelie
  Elison, the 24-year-old student who is working in the van for her third summer
  in a row. “There are a lot of people and there’s always something happening.”
  Sweden’s cities empty out in July, as locals flock to the coast to spend the
  summer in wooden holiday cottages. There are more than 600,000 of these
  holiday homes, known as fritidshus, which are often passed down through
  generations; almost half of children with at least one Swedish parent have
  access to one. They also have plenty of time to enjoy them – most Swedish
  employees are entitled to four consecutive weeks off each summer. After a grey
  morning, the sun comes out as I join the ferry queue for Nåttarö. Many around
  me are armed with bags of groceries, backpacks and even suitcases, intending
  to stay at least a week. But one sporty-looking couple, carrying only tiny
  running backpacks, tell me they are fellow day-trippers from Stockholm,
  planning to run a six-mile loop of the Stockholm Archipelago Trail, a newly
  marked hiking and trail-running route stretching 167 miles across 20 islands.
  Most tourists visiting Nåttarö take things at a slower pace. It’s a small,
  car-free island with one simple convenience store and two restaurants by the
  harbour. The main draws are the pine-lined walking trails, rocky clifftops and
  sandy beaches. There are 50 wooden cabins for hire (sleeping up to six people,
  £90 a night). The campsite is priced at less than £5 a night, including access
  to pristine showers, compost toilets and dishwashing facilities. Wild camping
  is allowed too, thanks to allemansrätten, Sweden’s right to roam policy. I
  take a 1¼-mile trail to Skarsand, a small beach in the north-east of the
  island. I have fond memories of celebrating a friend’s 40th birthday here a
  couple of years ago, when we camped with friends and their kids, cooking
  dinner on the beach’s public grill. Today, despite being peak holiday season,
  I have it all to myself, save for some passing hikers. The sunny afternoon
  passes quickly, and a couple of hours later I’m back on the ferry for
  Nynäshamn. The Stockholm pair have made it too, having successfully completed
  their run. They are eagerly awaiting a pizza reward at Maggan’s, another
  popular restaurant in Nynäshamn’s harbour, and tell me they’ve squeezed clean
  T-shirts into their backpacks to change into. I’m planning a sunny evening
  drink on the waterfront too. Tomorrow I’ll be at my desk, catching up on
  emails – and researching my next coastal adventure.
