  Orphan review – László Nemes’ fable of resentment and rage in post-uprising
  Hungary
sectionName: Film
webPublicationDate: '2025-08-28T14:15:48Z'
bodyText: >-
  After the spiritual ordeal of his Holocaust movie Son of Saul, and his
  complex, nuanced drama about prewar Budapest, Sunset, Hungarian director
  László Nemes comes to Venice with a valuable, interesting picture: another
  painful, sombre story from 20th-century central Europe composed in his
  familiar sepia visual palette, and executed with impressive technical control.
  Set in the aftermath of Hungary’s failed uprising against its Soviet masters,
  it is a story about sons rebelling against fathers, but also about coming to
  terms with (or having to swallow resentment at) the reality of a new order of
  power – just as the Hungarian people had to come to terms with Moscow’s rule
  and with finding their proud spirit of independence stigmatised as
  quasi-fascist. With no support for their self-determination, Hungarians in
  1956 were orphaned by the times. However the orphan of the title is not in
  fact an orphan; his mother is still alive. Andor (Bojtorján Barábas) is an
  angry, lonely teenage boy who idolises the memory of his father, Hirsch, who
  went missing during the second world war but who might still be alive
  somewhere. Andor still conducts imaginary conversations with him, and his mum
  (Andrea Waskovics) works in a grocery store. But Andor’s life is turned upside
  down by the appearance of a brutal, boorish butcher (played by French actor
  Grégory Gadebois) who smugly – and odiously – seems to be claiming some sort
  of right over Andor’s mother. The awful truth about who his father actually is
  dawns on him and Andor is convulsed with resentment and rage, especially as he
  uncovers evidence that just a few years previously this butcher was cruel to
  his “other” family. But as his mother says to him: “The more you hate him, the
  more you like him.” The whole situation is complicated by the fact that this
  man, however maladroit and often obnoxious, has moments of affection with
  Andor and is sincere enough – in his way – about building a life with his new
  family. However, there is something stolid and at times monotonous about the
  way this is presented to the audience – as ever with Nemes, the force of
  gravity is increased, making everything 20% heavier and denser. And Barábas’s
  performance is frankly actorly rather than real in his incessant frown of
  righteous resentment. It’s a minor movie from this always interesting
  film-maker. • Orphan screened at the Venice film festival.
