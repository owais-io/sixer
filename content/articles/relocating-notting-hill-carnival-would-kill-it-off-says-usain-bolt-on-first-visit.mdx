  Any attempt to move Notting Hill carnival out of its traditional home would
  kill one of the UK’s most important cultural events, Usain Bolt has said.
  Bolt, the world’s fastest man and an eight-time Olympic gold medallist, made
  his first trip to Europe’s biggest street party on Sunday. While 2 million
  people are expected to attend, organisers have expressed concern in the run-up
  to this year’s edition that a difficulty in finding sponsorship poses an
  existential threat to the event. “To take something that’s so big and so
  cultural for years, to lose something like that, I think will definitely
  damage the culture itself,” Bolt said after his appearance at one of the sound
  systems on Sunday. The former sprinter said he had heard of the carnival’s
  long history, adding: “For something [like that] to just go down, that’s going
  to really impact culture and people in general. Because, even before I’ve gone
  to Notting Hill carnival, I’ve heard about it so many times. It’s something
  you see on TV, your friends tell you about it, and say: ‘You should come. It’s
  a different vibe.’” Bolt said he had learned a lot about its origins as a free
  street party during his visit. Addressing calls to make it a ticketed event,
  and even to move it out of its spiritual home in one of the traditional
  centres of London’s black community, he said: “It wouldn’t be the same. It
  wouldn’t be the same, for sure. “Knowing what carnival is – it’s about
  marching and the vibes and the energy – to put it in one space where people
  can’t move, it’s not going to be the same … I think it would definitely kill.
  A lot of people probably wouldn’t go that much.” Speaking in his Mayfair hotel
  room after his appearance at carnival, as part of a sponsorship deal with the
  clothing brand Puma, he said: “It was something I’ve never really experienced
  – a vibe where we come together and build something different.” Sunday is
  traditionally family day at carnival. This year, it began with the J’ouvert
  celebration, with people covering each other in paint, coloured powder and
  chocolate. The festivities started in the morning on Great Western Road, where
  judges stood in a stall to watch the colourful float procession. A woman on
  glittering golden stilts walked past as an enthusiastic soca MC had the crowd
  jumping with their hands in the air. Fast-paced drumming could be heard and
  felt before the first parade arrived. The street was decorated with flutes,
  brass instruments, steel drums and costumes including giant colourful wings.
  Flags representing countries from Venezuela to Trinidad and Tobago were draped
  across the shoulders of people who danced and cheered down the road. A mixture
  of adults and children dressed in jewels, glittery wings, belts and
  headdresses leapt down the street followed by floats pumping out bass and
  music. As the Paddington Arts float drove past, the side of the lorry reading
  Let’s Dance Not Fight, the MC spoke of connection to the crowd and the dancers
  dressed in iridescent purples and blues for its Under the Sea theme. Along the
  side streets were rows of food and drink stalls serving jerk chicken, curry
  goat, Red Stripe and rum punch cocktails. On other streets, towering sound
  systems and stages had been set up playing reggae, dub and drum’n’bass. Locals
  leaned out of their balconies and windows and watched the celebrations below.
  This was Claudette Sparen’s eighth visit to carnival. Originally from Curaçao
  but living in the Netherlands, the medical worker said she loved everything
  about it. “The people are so nice, so polite, so happy – they are the best
  people I have ever met,” she said. “We love to be here. It’s bigger [than
  before] and there are a lot of young people. Everybody is having fun and you
  see different culture together. I love that.” Sabina Challenger, from Hackney
  in east London, took part in the Perpetual Beauty float with her child.
  “Carnival is about unity and about bringing people together, about reminding
  the community what the West Indian community has brought to the UK,” she said.
  “It also helps us to remind us of where we came from. It stems from slavery
  and oppression but it’s a celebration in terms of how far we have come in not
  just the UK but the world.” All major music and sound systems were switched
  off at 3pm for three minutes to honour those who were killed in the 2017 fire
  in Grenfell Tower, which is still clad in scaffolding and wrapping, and looms
  over the carnival route. People also honoured Kelso Cochrane, who was murdered
  in a racially motivated attack in Notting Hill in 1959.
