  Rail travel has been growing in popularity over the past few years, and it is
  increasingly being seen as not just a means of transport, but an integral part
  of a holiday – like going on a grand tour. Flexible tickets and the resurgence
  of night trains mean that travellers can plot an itinerary that takes in any
  number of cities and countries on one trip. We’d like to hear about your best
  rail journey in the UK or Europe. The best tip of the week, chosen by Tom Hall
  of Lonely Planet wins a £200 voucher to stay at a Coolstays property – the
  company has more than 3,000 worldwide. The best tips will appear in the
  Guardian Travel section and website. Keep your tip to about 100 words If you
  have a relevant photo, do send it in – but it’s your words we will be judging
  for the competition. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you must be a UK
  resident to enter this competition. The competition closes on Monday 11 August
  at 10am BST Have a look at our past winners and other tips Read the terms and
