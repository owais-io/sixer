  Lego said it could be benefiting from parents’ desire to keep children – and
  themselves – away from smartphones as sales rose 12%, helped by strong sales
  of its Botanicals and Formula One grand prix-themed sets. The Danish toy
  company said sales increased to a record 34.6bn Danish kroner (£4bn) in the
  first half of the year, rising well ahead of the recovering global toy market
  in which sales rose 7%. The chief executive, Niels B Christiansen, said it was
  possible the group was benefiting from parents’ desire to keep children away
  from smartphones amid fears of the negative impact of social media on mental
  health. The strong sales of Lego come as Yoto, the UK-based creator of
  screen-free speakers for children, almost doubled its sales last year to
  £94.8m and said it expects to reach a profit for the first time in 2025,
  according to a report in the Financial Times. Research from the audience
  research company GWI found that social media addiction ranked among parents’
  top three fears for their children from a list that included the climate
  crisis and war. Christiansen said: “We see ourselves as competing for
  children’s time. The most important thing is to provide relevant and exciting
  experiences, and that could keep them away from smartphones.” The Lego boss
  has previously said that the company is developing digital games and tying up
  with more teen-friendly brands such as the sportswear firm Nike as it competes
  with social media to keep tweens interested. Lego said net profit increased
  10% to 6.5bn kroner, with the company signing deals to produce toys linked to
  the Bluey and Pokémon cartoon series and launching the She Built That campaign
  to encourage girls to use Lego creatively. The company has seen such success
  with its Botanicals range of plant-inspired building sets for adults,
  especially for Valentine’s Day and Easter. Christiansen said: “We are very
  pleased to have maintained our strong performance in the first half of 2025,
  winning share in the global toy market. This growth is driven by our large and
  innovative range of products that continues to be relevant across ages and
  interests.” He said sales were now growing again in China, after a tough start
  to 2024, and expected worldwide sales to continue to rise by about 9% in the
  second half of the year amid “strong consumer demand”. Christiansen said Lego
  was paying some tariffs on the import of goods from its factory in Mexico,
  which supplies the US, but some items had escaped the taxes as result of a
  deal between the two countries. He said the group was benefiting from having
  manufacturing facilities “as close to markets as possible” so that it could
  produce only what was needed and keep stocks tight. The company said tariffs
  had so far had no impact on its prices in the US and it had “no plans” to put
  up the prices of its toys there this year. The brand is on track to open a
  $1.5bn (£1.1bn) US factory and distribution centre in 2027, its seventh
  factory worldwide. The company previously said it was not bringing forward the
  development of the factory despite new import tariffs introduced by the Trump
  administration this year. The group opened a new site in Vietnam earlier this
  year and expanded factories in Mexico and Hungary to meet demand. Lego said it
  was also on track to reach its full-year target of 60% of bought materials to
  be produced with sustainable sources. As part of this effort, Lego is to make
  some of its toy tyres from a material derived from recycled fishing nets,
  ropes and engine oil. The company is also introducing e-methanol, a material
  made from mixing renewable energy and CO2 from bio-waste, to create rigid Lego
  elements such as wheel axles and minifigure hands.
