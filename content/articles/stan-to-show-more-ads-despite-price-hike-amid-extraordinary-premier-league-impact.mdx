  Streaming provider Stan is set to introduce more advertisements on its
  sporting broadcasts despite recently raising its price by $5 per month, as it
  enjoys an increase of around 100,000 subscribers directly thanks to its
  acquisition of the Premier League rights from Optus. The chief executive of
  its parent company Nine Entertainment, Matt Stanton, confirmed in Nine’s
  annual results briefing on Wednesday there will be no more Premier League
  matches on free-to-air after this Saturday’s clash between Chelsea and Fulham,
  despite outstanding audience numbers in the first two weeks. Last weekend’s
  9.30pm AEST clash between Manchester City and Tottenham attracted an average
  audience of 567,000 across Nine and Stan, with a reach of over 1.5m, according
  to Stanton. “This was more than double our usual audience in that time slot
  with the added benefit of boosting late audiences into the NRL [which preceded
  it],” he said. “The results have been extraordinary, with the second weekend
  delivering the most sports viewers on a single day in Stan’s history, ahead of
  the first Sunday of the 2024 Olympics.” The Lions series was also described as
  “very strong for us”, said Stanton, who added that the company’s digital
  growth strategy “was further progressed with the introduction of advertising
  to Stan Sport” for the rugby tour. Ahead of AFL finals sign up for our free
  weekly newsletter Stan Sport costs $20 per month on top of an entertainment
  plan starting at $12, and its growth helped inflate Stan’s overall revenues by
  10%. Sport subscribers last year were already growing “by a low double digit
  percentage” thanks largely to the Olympics, according to Graeme Cassells,
  Nine’s acting chief financial officer, but the Premier League triggered an
  additional bump. Overall subscribers to Stan increased to 2.5m from 2.3m a
  year ago, and Stanton said it was “about right” to attribute 100,000 of that
  growth to the acquisition of the Premier League. The deal has now made Stan
  the main challenger to Kayo Sports in the sports streaming market in
  Australia. Kayo also increased the price of its standard package from $25 to
  $30 in June. “We moved our Stan Sport price from $15 to $20 [per month]
  because of the addition of the Premier League into that suite, because we’ve
  got scale in that market now, so the scale of Stan Sport is very sizeable
  now,” Stanton said, highlighting its football, tennis and Olympics properties.
  “The good thing for us about that ‘win’, if you like [gaining the Premier
  League rights], was the fact that now Stan Sport is a real, a good scale
  player and a good opportunity for us.” Channel Nine has used its other
  properties to promote its new acquisition, including a story on A Current
  Affair last week covering the “rise” of the Premier League in Australia.
