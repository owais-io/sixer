  A criminal court in Thailand has dismissed a case accusing former prime
  minister Thaksin Shinawatra of defaming the monarchy, the first of three court
  cases that could decide the fate of one of the country’s prominent political
  families. Thaksin was accused of insulting the monarchy during an interview
  with South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo in 2015. He denied wrongdoing and
  repeatedly pledged his loyalty to the king, who according to the constitution
  should be “enthroned in a position of revered worship”. “The case was
  dismissed,” Thaksin told reporters, smiling as he left court. He wore a yellow
  tie, the colour associated with Thailand’s monarchy. The court confirmed it
  had dismissed the case, saying there was not enough evidence to prove
  wrongdoing. Thailand has one of the world’s most severe lese-majesty laws,
  under which criticism of the monarchy is punishable by between three and 15
  years in prison. Since 2020, at least 281 people have been charged under the
  law, which can be interpreted broadly, with protesters prosecuted for
  political speeches, wearing clothes deemed to be an impersonation of the
  royals, or for being involved in the sale of satirical cartoons. Critics say
  the law is used to target political opponents and silence dissent. While
  Thaksin survived Friday’s case, this is just one of a series of legal
  challenges facing the former leader and his embattled family, who have been
  locked in a power struggle with Thailand’s military royalist establishment for
  decades. Next week, Thailand’s constitutional court will decide whether his
  daughter, suspended prime minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, should be removed
  from office over a leaked phone call with Cambodia’s former leader Hun Sen, in
  which she discussed the two countries’ border dispute, with critics accusing
  her of kowtowing to Thailand’s neighbour. Thaksin also faces a separate court
  case over allegations he wrongly avoided prison on health grounds upon his
  return from self-imposed exile in 2023. Thaksin had spent more than 15 years
  abroad to avoid legal charges that he had previously said were politically
  motivated, but returned after striking a controversial deal with his former
  enemies in the military establishment – an arrangement that now appears
  increasingly fragile. Thaksin, a billionaire businessman who once owned
  Manchester City football club, was first elected prime minister in a landslide
  victory in 2001, and he went on to build a strong voter base among rural
  communities in the north of Thailand by offering welfare and economic policies
  to improve people’s livelihoods. However, he was also accused of corruption
  and human rights abuses, and was loathed by conservatives in Bangkok. He was
  ousted from power in a military coup in 2006. His sister Yingluck Shinawatra
  was removed from office by a court ruling followed by a coup in 2014.
  Thailand’s courts have frequently intervened in politics, dissolving popular
  political parties and banning politicians from office. The latest series of
  court cases is a stark reminder of the “imbalance in power relations between
  elected and unelected forces in Thailand”, said Dr Napon Jatusripitak,
  visiting fellow at ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute. “This is not the first time
  that an unelected set of judges gets to decide a national outcome and veto
  whatever mandates were made by the Thai electorates,” he said. However, he
  added that, while in the past, punitive court rulings against the Shinawatras
  elicited sympathy from their loyal support base, the family’s popularity has
  diminished significantly. The deal Thaksin struck when he returned to the
  country – where he joined with their old military opponents in order to keep a
  popular pro-reform party out of office – had damaged his credibility, said
  Napon. The party’s perceived failure to deliver on economic promises, and,
  most significantly, anger over Paetongtarn’s handling of Thailand’s border
  dispute with Cambodia, has led to a further collapse in support. Paetongtarn
  could be removed from office next week, potentially ushering in a new period
  of political instability in the country.
