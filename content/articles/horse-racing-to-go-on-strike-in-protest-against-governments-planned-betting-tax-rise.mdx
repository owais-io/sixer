  All scheduled racing in Britain on 10 September will be cancelled and the
  sport will, in effect, go on strike, as racing escalates its protests against
  a Treasury proposal to align the rate of duty charged on sports betting with
  the rate for much more addictive games of pure chance such as roulette and
  online slot machines. The move to abandon meetings at Uttoxeter, Lingfield,
  Kempton and Carlisle is expected to result in the loss of about £700,000 to
  the industry. The action, first reported by the Times, has been agreed
  following cooperation between Jockey Club Racecourses, which operates Kempton
  and Carlisle; Arena Racing Company, the operator of Uttoxeter and Lingfield;
  and the British Horseracing Authority, the sport’s ruling body. Gambling on
  games of chance is taxed at 21% of an operator’s gross profits, while the duty
  on betting – on racing, sports and other events without a fixed profit margin
  for the operator – is set at 15%. There is an additional charge of 10% of
  gross profits for bets on UK racing for the statutory Levy, which has returned
  money to racing since off-course betting was legalised in the early 1960s. The
  proposal to equalise the duty rate for betting and gaming products was
  initially floated by the Treasury in the final months of Rishi Sunak’s
  Conservative government, but it survived the transition to a Labour
  administration and was the subject of a consultation process which closed in
  July. Betting and gaming have been treated separately for taxation purposes
  since the Betting and Gaming Act came into force in 1961. There is a
  widespread belief in racing that a levelling of the duty rates will make the
  sport more expensive for gambling operators and as a result, far less
  attractive when compared with gaming products with a guaranteed return.
  Alternatives for the tax regime around gambling include a proposal from the
  Social Market Foundation thinktank that gaming duty could be increased to 50%
  and sports betting to 25%, with changes to the Levy system ensuring that
  racing would not lose out. The former prime minister Gordon Brown has also
  advocated for a significant rise in the duty charged on fixed-margin gaming
  products. Launching the British Horseracing Authority’s campaign against the
  tax proposals last month, Brant Dunshea, the BHA’s acting chief executive,
  said the sport’s stakeholders were “united in their opposition to the
  Treasury’s proposals to harmonise remote gambling duties”. Dunshea added: “If
  the chancellor delivers this tax bombshell at the autumn budget, not only will
  jobs be lost but the future of Britain’s second-largest spectator sport will
  be in jeopardy. “This is why it is vital that the government carefully
  considers the argument made by all British racing’s stakeholders and works
  alongside us to protect a cherished national institution.” The races lost on
  10 September are expected to be added to other cards scheduled around the same
  time. The date chosen for the racing “strike” is 24 hours before the start of
  the high-profile St Leger meeting at Doncaster, which the prime minister, Sir
  Keir Starmer, and his wife, Victoria, a keen racing fan, attended last year.
