  Donald Trump has attacked Jaguar Land Rover’s divisive rebranding strategy,
  hours after Britain’s largest carmaker announced its new boss. Trump posted on
  his Truth Social platform that the auto company, owned by India’s Tata Motors,
  was “in absolute turmoil” and claimed that the “CEO resigned in disgrace”. His
  post on Monday evening also described JLR’s recent much-criticised advert –
  which showed a diverse group of models in brightly coloured clothing set
  against a vibrant backdrop and was designed to launch the company’s rebrand –
  as a “stupid, and seriously WOKE advertisement”. Trump asked: “Who wants to
  buy a Jaguar after looking at that disgraceful ad?” The post came shortly
  after JLR announced that PB Balaji would become its new chief executive and
  would take the reins in November. The group finance chief of JLR’s parent
  company, Tata Motors, since 2017 will become the carmaker’s first Indian CEO.
  He will replace Adrian Mardell, who is retiring after three years as JLR’s
  chief executive and following 35 years working for the company. Balaji said in
  a statement it was his “privilege” to lead JLR, adding: “I look forward to
  working with the team to take it to even greater heights.” Mardell said he
  believed he had “cemented JLR’s position in the automotive industry during a
  time of incredible change”, and wished Balaji success in his new role. In
  recent months, JLR has been hit by the impact of Trump’s tariffs, and reported
  a 15.1% drop in sales in the three months to June, after a temporary pause in
  exports to the US. It has also opened a voluntary redundancy scheme for up to
  500 managers in an effort to save costs. Sales are expected to improve after
  the introduction of a UK-US trade deal, which will implement lower 10% tariffs
  on the first 100,000 exports. The company has reported a profit for the past
  10 consecutive quarters after a turnaround effort. However, the Guardian
  revealed in July that JLR was delaying the planned launches of its new
  electric Range Rover and electric Jaguar models to give it time for more
  testing and to allow demand to pick up. The electric Range Rover, which will
  be made in JLR’s main factory in Solihull in the West Midlands, will not be
  delivered until 2026, instead of late this year, as previously planned. Two
  planned Jaguar models are also expected to be pushed back by several months.
  JLR has been slower than some of its rivals to embrace electric vehicles but
  has recently made investments in building hybrid cars as well as preparing for
  EV production. During Mardell’s tenure, JLR released a controversial 30-second
  social media clip with the tagline “copy nothing”, before the unveiling last
  November of a new electric concept car. JLR’s rebrand and advertising
  campaign, which did not feature a vehicle, immediately drew more than 160m
  views on social media, but also brought an online backlash late last year,
  including from Republicans and rightwing commentators in the US. The owner of
  X and chief executive of Tesla, Elon Musk, posted on the platform: “Do you
  sell cars?” It prompted the carmaker’s managing director to say he was
  disappointed by the “vile hatred and intolerance” in the comments directed at
  the models in the video. JLR was approached for comment.
