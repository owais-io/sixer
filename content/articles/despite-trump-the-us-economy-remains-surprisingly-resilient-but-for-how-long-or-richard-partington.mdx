  Chaotic and unpredictable, keeping up with Donald Trump’s volatile trade war –
  never mind his presidency – can be tough. Back in April after his “Liberation
  Day” tariff announcement, the talk was of the president crashing the global
  economy. Then, after a Wall Street backlash, the world learned the acronym
  “Taco”, which stands for “Trump Always Chickens Out”. Now, things are heating
  up again. The president’s decision to hit US trading partners – including
  Canada, Brazil, India and Taiwan – with new tariffs after his self-imposed 1
  August deadline certainly reignites a threat to the world economy. Dozens of
  countries have been left reeling, and US consumers are expected to pay a heavy
  price. However, there is a sense that things could have been worse. Nowhere
  more clearly is this reflected than on Wall Street: despite the chaos of the
  president’s trade war, the stock market remains close to record levels. After
  the latest escalation on Friday, and some worrying US jobs numbers, share
  prices took a hit, sliding by about 1%. But this is a setback rather than a
  rout. A further slide could be ignited by this capricious president. Trump’s
  decision to fire the official in charge of labour market data and his war on
  the independence of the US Federal Reserve will make matters worse. But
  despite the warnings of untold economic damage from the US tariff war earlier
  this year, the American economy has proven surprisingly resilient in recent
  months. Last week, the president seized on US growth figures showing the
  economy had expanded at an annualised rate of 3% in the second quarter, far in
  excess of the 2.4% rate predicted on Wall Street. Could the “fake news” media
  have it wrong? Are tariff wars “good, and easy to win,” as Trump claims? While
  inflation has ticked up, from 2.4% in May to 2.7% in June, it is well below
  the peak that followed the height of the pandemic disruption and Russia’s
  invasion of Ukraine, and is far from hitting the levels feared. Back in April,
  in a country wrought with division, Democratic voters reckoned inflation was
  on track to hit 7.9% within a year, while Republicans said it would collapse
  to 0.9%. Butthere is good reason why the US economy has so far defied the
  prophecies of Armageddon. For starters, the hot-cold nature of Trump’s tariff
  war means investors still anticipate further deals will be done to avoid the
  worst threats from ever materialising. The toughest tariffs introduced on
  Friday are only just arriving, too, meaning any impact has yet to emerge. Most
  countries have not hit back with retaliatory measures, which would have
  dramatically worsened things by putting international trade into a deeper
  tailspin. Meanwhile, knowing full well the dangers of this erratic president,
  businesses have been planning for months to avoid the worst-case scenarios. US
  companies rushed to stockpile goods before the trade war, helping them to keep
  prices down for now. Some firms have taken a hit to profits, according to
  analysts at Deutsche Bank, reckoning this is better than testing struggling
  American consumers – worn out by years of high inflation – with further price
  increases. The tariff costs are also being spread by multinationals, by
  increasing prices across the markets they operate in. In one high-profile
  example, Sony has put up the price of its PlayStation 5 by as much as 25% in
  some markets, including the UK, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. But not in
  the US. Still, there are signs that consequences are coming. When US
  businesses exhaust their pre-tariff stockpiles, it is likely that prices will
  creep higher. Meanwhile, the uncertainty of an erratic president is hitting
  jobs and investment. Last week’s US jobs market data has reignited fears over
  the resilience of the American economy. Tariffs are weighing on business
  confidence and steadily creeping into consumer prices. GDP growth of 3% might
  appear robust on the face of things, but this figure was heavily influenced by
  the 0.5% fall in output in the first quarter, when the surge in US firms
  rushing to beat Trump’s tariffs distorted activity. Growth in the first half
  averaged 1.25%, markedly slower than the 2.8% rate for 2024 as a whole. Part
  of the reason Wall Street remains sanguine about this is the continued belief
  that things could have turned out worse. Deals are still expected, with the
  pause in tariffs for key US trade partners Mexico and China suggesting this
  most clearly. The investor view is that rather than tariffs the president
  would prefer a string of box-office moments in front of the TV cameras with
  trade partners paying tribute to the court of Trump. However, it would be
  wrong to underestimate the self-described “tariff man’s” love of border taxes.
  And even though his most extreme threats will be negotiated down, the final
  destination will still be much worse than before. An economic hurricane might
  be avoided but a storm is still the last thing businesses and consumers need.
  Britain’s US trade deal is a case in point. A 10% US tariff on British goods
  has been welcomed as a big victory for Keir Starmer given the alternative, but
  it is still far worse than before. British cars will face a tariff rate four
  times higher than previously, costing jobs and growth in Britain while hitting
  American consumers in the pocket. For the US consumer, the average tariff had
  been close to 2% before Trump’s return to the White House. After his 1 August
  escalation, that figure leaps to about 15% – the highest level since the
  1930s. Almost a century ago a similar wrong-headed protectionist approach in
  Washington made the Great Depression far worse: the Smoot-Hawley tariffs hit
  the US and triggered a domino effect among the main industrialised nations,
  ultimately leading to the second world war. In the unpredictability of Trump’s
  trade war, hope remains that similar mistakes can be avoided. But significant
  damage is still being done.
