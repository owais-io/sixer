  Israeli tanks pushed into a new area on the edge of Gaza City overnight,
  destroying houses and prompting residents to flee, witnesses told Reuters.
  Tanks late on Tuesday entered into the Ebad-Alrahman neighbourhood on the
  northern edge of Gaza City and shelled houses, wounding several people and
  forcing many others, who had been taken by surprise, to move deeper into
  Gaza’s largest city, residents said. Saad Abed, 60, a former construction
  worker, said: All of a sudden, we heard that the tanks pushed into
  Ebad-Alrahman, the sounds of explosions became louder, and louder, and we saw
  people escaping towards our area, If no truce is reached, we will see the
  tanks outside our homes. The local lives on Jala Street in Gaza City, around
  one kilometre (0.6 mile) from the Ebad-Alrahman neighbourhood. Israel has said
  it is preparing to launch a new offensive in Gaza City, which it describes as
  Hamas’ last bastion. Around half of the territory’s 2 million people are now
  living there and Israel has said they will be told to evacuate. Thousands have
  already left, but church leaders in the city said on Wednesday they were
  staying put, as leaving Gaza City and “trying to flee to the south would be
  nothing less than a death sentence”. A joint statement by the Greek Orthodox
  Patriarchate and the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem said: For this reason,
  the clergy and nuns have decided to remain and continue to care for all those
  who will be in the compounds. Israeli tanks retreated from the edge of Gaza
  City later on Wednesday to the Jabaliya area, where they have been operating
  for months, although bombardments on three of the city’s eastern suburbs –
  Shejaia, Zeitoun and Sabra – continued. Gaza health authorities said Israeli
  fire had killed at least 20 people, including a four-year-old girl, across the
  territory. The Israeli military said in a statement that its forces were
  operating in Jabaliya and the outskirts of Gaza City to “dismantle terror
  infrastructure sites and eliminate terrorists”. The Israeli military has
  claimed to have carried out an airstrike last week that killed the commander
  in the western Gaza region of Hamas’ general security apparatus. The army
  named the commander as Mahmoud al-Asud, describing him as a “significant”
  source of knowledge for Hamas. It said that the commander was killed by an
  aircraft on 22 August. The statement, which was posted on X, added that the
  military was continuing to operate in Khan Younis and Jabaliya. My colleague
  Nour Haydar speaks with political correspondent Tom Mcilroy and senior
  reporter Ben Doherty in a recent episode of the Full Story podcast about why
  the Albanese government has taken the historic step to expel Tehran’s
  ambassador from Australia. Iran directed at least two attacks against
  Australia’s Jewish community, the domestic spy agency has determined,
  prompting the Albanese government to expel the country’s ambassador from
  Australia. The prime minister announced on Tuesday that Asio had ‘credible
  intelligence’ to determine the Iranian government was behind the attacks
  against the Adass Israel synagogue in Melbourne and Lewis’s Continental
  Kitchen in Bondi, Sydney. Iranian diplomats posted to Australia were not
  involved, the Asio director general, Mike Burgess, said. You can listen to the

  Full Story podcast Pope Leo made a “strong appeal” to the global community on
  Wednesday to end the nearly two-year conflict between Israel and Hamas,
  calling for a permanent ceasefire, release of hostages and the provision of
  humanitarian aid, Reuters reports. The pontiff said in his weekly audience at
  the Vatican: I once again issue a strong appeal … so that an end may be put to
  the conflict in the Holy Land, which has caused so much terror, destruction,
  and death. I implore that all hostages be freed, that a permanent ceasefire be
  reached, that the safe entry of humanitarian aid be facilitated, and that
  international humanitarian law be fully respected. The pope last month
  condemned the “barbarity” of the war in Gaza and the “indiscriminate use of
  force”, while also expressing his anguish over the Israeli strike on Gaza’s
  only Catholic church, which killed three people and injured 10. Al Jazeera
  reports that the prime minister of Belgium has begun a meeting with his
  deputies on the topic of recognising the state of Palestine. Bart De Wever
  said in a statement yesterday that it does not make sense to recognise the
  Palestinian state unless certain conditions are satisfied. These include the
  disarming of Hamas, release of hostages and security guarantees for Israel,
  the outlet reports. Below are some of the latest photos of the Middle East
  coming to us through the wires: London’s Metropolitan police have charged a
  total of 67 people with showing support for the banned group Palestine Action,
  the force announced on Tuesday, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports. The
  accused will appear in court across several dates in October, and face a
  possible maximum sentence of six months’ imprisonment if found guilty, the Met
  said. The UK government proscribed Palestine Action as a terror group in July
  after acts of vandalism at a Royal Air Force base. Rights groups have
  condemned the ban as legal overreach and a threat to free speech. More than
  700 people have been arrested, mostly at demonstrations, since the group was
  outlawed under the Terrorism Act 2000. The Met said in its statement that
  charges had been laid against 64 people relating to protests held in central
  London on two dates last month. That was in addition to charges brought
  against three other people announced earlier this month. On Monday, acclaimed
  screenwriter Paul Laverty was arrested on suspicion of supporting Palestine
  Action during a protest in Edinburgh, Scottish police said. Last week, Irish
  author Sally Rooney vowed to give fees generated by two BBC adaptations of her
  books to Palestine Action. Israeli police said on Wednesday that security
  forces seized roughly 1.5 million shekels ($447,000) of “terror funds” during
  a raid in the occupied West Bank a day earlier, Agence France-Presse (AFP)
  reports. Israeli forces targeted a currency exchange in Ramallah on Tuesday,
  leaving dozens of Palestinians wounded, according to the Red Crescent. Israel
  carries out frequent raids across the West Bank, where tensions have remained
  high throughout the Gaza war, but incursions into central Ramallah, the seat
  of the Palestinian Authority, are relatively rare. A statement from a police
  spokesperson on Wednesday said Israeli border police and the military “raided
  a money exchange business in the heart of Ramallah that was used to transfer
  funds to the Hamas terror organisation”. The statement said: Forces seized
  significant sums of money in both foreign and local currencies, with a total
  value of approximately 1,528,832 shekels, including US dollars, Jordanian
  dinars, euros, and other foreign currencies. Nine wanted suspects accused of
  involvement in terror activity were arrested and taken, together with the
  seized evidence, for investigation. Previous Israeli operations, earlier this
  year and in December 2023, have similarly targeted currency exchange offices
  in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967. Israeli troops or
  settlers in the occupied West Bank have killed at least 972 Palestinians,
  including militants and civilians, since the beginning of the Gaza war,
  according to an AFP tally based on Palestinian Authority figures. In the same
  period, at least 36 Israelis, both civilians and security forces, have been
  killed in attacks or during military operations in the territory, according to
  Israeli figures. The Guardian has published the below editorial on the
  questions that Israel and its allies must answer in response to the attack on
  Nasser hospital on Monday. Tragedy has piled on tragedy in Gaza. Yet Israel’s
  attack on Nasser hospital – the only functioning public hospital left in the
  south – still stood out. One strike was followed within minutes by another,
  hitting those who had raced to help the wounded. Monday’s attack was multiple
  egregious acts in one: hitting a hospital, injured civilians, rescue workers
  and journalists. With events caught on video, Benjamin Netanyahu called it a
  “tragic mishap” instead of blaming Hamas for the deaths or smearing the dead.
  (The military, which has a record of misleading claims following incidents,
  later alleged a camera had been “positioned by Hamas” at the site.) Can anyone
  believe that this was all an error, when such “double tap” strikes are
  becoming routine, and when those killed this time are so typical of those
  killed throughout this war? “Israel values the work of journalists, medical
  staff, and all civilians,” the Israeli prime minister continued. Why, then,
  have more journalists died in Gaza in the last two years than globally in the
  previous three? Why has Israel killed hundreds of medical workers, spurring
  calls for a new crime of healthocide? Why are so many doctors detained? Why,
  judging from the Israeli military’s own data, do civilians account for an
  astonishing 83% of the dead? Palestinians are dying, too, in the human-made
  famine caused by Israel’s obstruction of aid. A quarter of a million are
  already starving, on the judgment of a UN-backed body known for the caution of
  its analyses. How many more must die? How can Palestinians have a future
  without their land? How can they defend their society when those at its heart,
  embodying its knowledge and culture, including doctors and journalists, are
  eliminated? How can they look to tomorrow when their children cannot go to
  school and their universities are destroyed? You can read the full article
  here: The Guardian view on Gaza: the questions that Israel and its allies must
  answer Australia’s intelligence agency traced the funding of hooded criminals
  who allegedly set fire to a Melbourne synagogue, linking the antisemitic
  attack to Iran, officials said, even as those charged with the crime were
  likely unaware Tehran was their puppet master, Reuters reports. A 20-year-old
  local man, Younes Ali Younes, appeared in Melbourne’s magistrates court on
  Wednesday charged with the 6 December arson attack on the Adass Israel
  synagogue and theft of a car. He did not enter a plea and did not seek bail.
  His lawyer declined to comment to Reuters. A day earlier, prime minister
  Anthony Albanese said Australia’s intelligence agencies had shown the attack,
  and another in Sydney last year, were directed by the Iranian government, and
  expelled Tehran’s ambassador, becoming the latest western government to accuse
  Iran of carrying out hostile covert activities on its soil. Australia’s spy
  chief Mike Burgess said a series of “cut outs”, an intelligence term for
  intermediaries, were used to conceal Iran’s involvement in the attacks, and
  warned that it may have orchestrated others. Security forces “have done rather
  extraordinary work to trace the source of the funding of these criminal
  elements who’ve been used as tools of the Iranian regime,” Albanese told the
  Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Tuesday. The investigation worked
  backwards through payments made onshore and offshore to “petty and sometimes
  not so petty criminals”, he said in parliament on Wednesday. Albanese was
  briefed by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation on Monday on
  evidence of a “supply chain” that he said linked the attacks to offshore
  individuals and Tehran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Iranian forces
  have killed 13 militants in a raid in the restive south-east, state media
  reported on Wednesday, adding they were members of a group suspected of a
  recent deadly attack on police, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports. “So far,
  13 terrorists have been killed and a number of others arrested” in
  Sistan-Balochistan province, the Revolutionary Guards said in a statement
  carried by state television. It said operations were carried out in the cities
  of Iranshahr, Khash and Saravan. The broadcaster said that some of those
  killed were suspected of being behind an ambush reported on Friday that killed
  five policemen in Iranshahr. My colleagues Malak A Tantesh and William
  Christou have written the below article on the five Palestinian journalists
  who were killed in an Israeli double-tap strike on Nasser hospital in southern
  Gaza on Monday. Israel struck a building at the hospital, killing Reuters
  journalist Hussam al-Masri and others. Then, after journalists and rescue
  workers ran to the scene to help their colleagues, a second bomb hit the same
  spot 15 minutes later. The five journalists join their now more than 247
  Palestinian colleagues killed in Gaza over the last 22 months, according to UN
  statistics. This is the deadliest conflict for journalists recorded, killing
  more journalists than both world wars, the Vietnam war, the Yugoslavia wars
  and the US war in Afghanistan combined. The strike on Nasser hospital was
  captured by a live broadcast and showed unarmed medics and journalists holding
  up their hands to shield themselves moments before they were killed. The
  images of their deaths have provoked outrage across the globe and calls to
  protect Palestinian journalists while they are doing their jobs. You can read
  the full article here: ‘He loved his work deeply’: the five Palestinian
  journalists killed in Gaza airstrike US special envoy Steve Witkoff said on
  Tuesday that president Donald Trump would chair a meeting on Gaza at the White
  House on Wednesday and added that Washington expected Israel’s war in the
  Palestinian territory to be settled by the end of the year, Reuters reports.
  The US state department separately said secretary of state Marco Rubio will
  meet Israeli foreign minister Gideon Saar in Washington on Wednesday, which is
  expected to take place at 3.15pm ET (7.15pm UK time). When asked on Fox News’
  “Special Report with Bret Baier” show if there is a postwar plan for Gaza,
  Witkoff said: Yes, we’ve got a large meeting in the White House tomorrow,
  chaired by the president, and it’s a very comprehensive plan we’re putting
  together on the next day. He did not elaborate further and did not list the
  meeting’s participants. When asked should Israel be doing anything differently
  to end the war and secure the release of the hostages, Witkoff said: We think
  that we’re going to settle this one way or another, certainly before the end
  of this year. Witkoff said Israel was open to continuing discussions with
  Palestinian militant group Hamas. He said Hamas had signaled it was open to a
  settlement. Good morning and welcome back to the Guardian’s coverage of the
  Middle East. US special envoy Steve Witkoff said on Tuesday that president
  Donald Trump would chair a meeting on Gaza at the White House on Wednesday and
  added that Washington expected Israel’s war in the Palestinian territory to be
  settled by the end of the year. The US state department separately said
  secretary of state Marco Rubio will meet Israeli foreign minister Gideon Saar
  in Washington on Wednesday, which is expected to take place at 3.15pm ET
  (7.15pm UK time). When asked on Fox News’ “Special Report with Bret Baier”
  show if Israel be doing anything differently to end the war and secure the
  release of the hostages, Witkoff said: “We think that we’re going to settle
  this one way or another, certainly before the end of this year.” Witkoff said
  Israel was open to continuing discussions with Palestinian militant group
  Hamas. He said Hamas had signaled it was open to a settlement. Trump stunned
  the world earlier this year when he suggested the United States should take
  control of the Gaza Strip, clear out its 2 million inhabitants and build
  seaside real estate. The president had promised a swift end to the war in Gaza
  during the 2024 US election campaign and after taking office in January, but
  almost seven months into his term, that stated goal remains elusive. Trump’s
  term began with a ceasefire which lasted two months and ended when Israeli
  strikes killed about 400 Palestinians on 18 March. In recent weeks, images of
  starving Palestinians in Gaza, including children, have shocked the world and
  fuelled criticism of Israel over the worsening conditions. Hamas on Tuesday
  rejected an Israeli statement saying a strike on a Gaza hospital that killed
  several journalists was aimed at a camera operated by the militant group,
  calling the accusation “baseless”. The Israeli military on Tuesday said its
  forces were targeting a camera operated by Hamas in two strikes that killed
  five journalists at a hospital a day earlier, triggering a wave of
  international condemnation. Monday’s strike in southern Gaza’s Khan Younis
  killed at least 20 people, including the five reporters who worked for Al
  Jazeera, the Associated Press and Reuters, among other outlets. Hamas denied
  on Tuesday that any of the Palestinians killed in Israel’s attack on Gaza’s
  Nasser hospital on Monday were militants. Earlier, Israel said it had killed
  six militants in the attack but it was investigating how civilians, including
  five journalists, were killed. “We can confirm that the Reuters and AP
  journalists were not a target of the strike,” military spokesperson Lieutenant
  Colonel Nadav Shoshani told Reuters on Tuesday. The UN has demanded that
  Israel’s investigations into unlawful killings in Gaza, including its “double
  tap” bombing of Nasser hospital, yield results and ensure accountability.
  “There needs to be justice,” Thameen Al-Kheetan, the spokesperson for the UN’s
  human rights office, told reporters on Tuesday in Geneva. He added that the
  number of journalists killed in Gaza raised many questions about the targeting
  of media workers. Tens of thousands of people took part in demonstrations
  across Israel on Tuesday, blocking highways on a “day of disruption” that
  aimed to push Benjamin Netanyahu into agreeing a deal to end the war and
  calling off plans to attack Gaza City. Relatives of hostages led the biggest
  march and rally in Tel Aviv, while in Jerusalem hundreds of people gathered
  outside the prime minister’s office as the security cabinet met to discuss the
  war. There were dozens of other protests around the country, including on the
  main highway to the northern city of Haifa and inside Ben Gurion airport.
  Israeli forces raided the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah on Tuesday,
  targeting a currency exchange and, according to the Red Crescent, leaving
  dozens of Palestinians wounded. Israel carries out frequent raids across the
  West Bank, where tensions have remained high throughout the Gaza war, but
  incursions into central Ramallah – seat of the Palestinian Authority – are
  relatively rare. The head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog has said a team of its
  inspectors are “back in Iran,” the first to enter since Israeli and US strikes
  on Iranian nuclear facilities this year. Iran suspended cooperation with the
  UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency after a 12-day war with Israel in
  June, with Tehran pointing to the IAEA’s failure to condemn Israeli and US
  strikes on its nuclear facilities. Iran held talks on Tuesday with European
  powers, seeking to avert a sanctions snapback which they have threatened to
  impose under the moribund 2015 nuclear deal. Kazem Gharibabadi, an Iranian
  deputy foreign minister who attended the talks with Britain, France and
  Germany in Geneva, said in a post on X it was “high time” for the European
  trio “to make the right choice and give diplomacy time and space”. French
  president Emmanuel Macron strongly rejected Benjamin Netanyahu’s recent
  criticism over rising antisemitism in France and warned the issue should not
  be “weaponised”, in a letter to the Israeli leader published on Tuesday. Rows
  have broken out about an increase in antisemitic acts and hate crimes in
  France as international tensions mount over the conflict in Gaza. US envoy Tom
  Barrack said on Tuesday that Washington would support the extension of the
  mandate of UN peacekeepers in Lebanon for one more year. A planned vote at the
  UN security council on the future of the UNIFIL peacekeeping force in southern
  Lebanon, whose mandate ends on Sunday, has been postponed amid US and Israeli
  opposition to the draft text, several diplomatic sources told AFP. Journalists
  in Lebanon have demanded an apology from a senior US envoy after he told them
  to “act civilized” and not be “animalistic”. As reporters shouted questions
  after the US delegation’s meeting with the Lebanese president, Joseph Aoun, on
  Tuesday, Tom Barrack, the US ambassador to Turkey and special envoy to Syria,
  stepped up to the podium in the packed room and said: “We’re going to have a
  different set of rules … please be quiet for a moment. The moment that this
  starts becoming chaotic, like animalistic, we’re gone.” A man charged with
  setting fire to a Melbourne synagogue appeared in court on Wednesday over an
  attack Australia says was orchestrated by Iran and has led to the expulsion of
  Tehran’s ambassador. Australia said on Tuesday Iran sought to disguise its
  involvement in two 2024 attacks, at the Adass Israel Synagogue in Melbourne
  and on a kosher restaurant in Sydney, by using criminals and members of
  organised crime gangs. Australia on Wednesday dismissed suggestions by Israel
  that its interventions prompted Canberra to expel Iran’s ambassador as it
  blamed Tehran for directing at least two antisemitic arson attacks in the
  country’s biggest cities, Sydney and Melbourne. “Complete nonsense,” Home
  Affairs minister Tony Burke told ABC Radio, when asked about Israel claiming
  credit for Australia’s decision to order Tehran’s ambassador Ahmad Sadeghi to
  leave the country. Six Syrian soldiers were killed in Israeli drone strikes in
  the Damascus countryside, state-run El Ekhbariya TV reported early on
  Wednesday. Syria and Israel are engaged in US-mediated talks on easing
  tensions in southern Syria, with Damascus seeking a security deal that could
  open the door to wider political negotiations. The Israeli military said on
  Wednesday it intercepted a missile fired from Yemen, where Houthi rebels have
  regularly launched attacks they say are in response to Israel’s offensive in
  Gaza. “Following the sirens that sounded a short while ago in several areas in
  Israel, a missile that was launched from Yemen was intercepted by the IAF,”
  Israel’s army said on Telegram, referring to the air force.

Iranian forces have killed 13 militants in a raid in the restive south-east, state media reported on Wednesday, adding they were members of a group suspected of a recent deadly attack on police, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports. “So far, 13 terrorists have been killed and a number of others arrested” in Sistan-Balochistan province, the Revolutionary Guards said in a statement carried by state television. It said operations were carried out in the cities of Iranshahr, Khash and Saravan. The broadcaster said that some of those killed were suspected of being behind an ambush reported on Friday that killed five policemen in Iranshahr. My colleagues Malak A Tantesh and William Christou have written the below article on the five Palestinian journalists who were killed in an Israeli double-tap strike on Nasser hospital in southern Gaza on Monday. Israel struck a building at the hospital, killing Reuters journalist Hussam al-Masri and others. Then, after journalists and rescue workers ran to the scene to help their colleagues, a second bomb hit the same spot 15 minutes later. The five journalists join their now more than 247 Palestinian colleagues killed in Gaza over the last 22 months, according to UN statistics. This is the deadliest conflict for journalists recorded, killing more journalists than both world wars, the Vietnam war, the Yugoslavia wars and the US war in Afghanistan combined. The strike on Nasser hospital was captured by a live broadcast and showed unarmed medics and journalists holding up their hands to shield themselves moments before they were killed. The images of their deaths have provoked outrage across the globe and calls to protect Palestinian journalists while they are doing their jobs.

The US state department separately said secretary of state Marco Rubio will meet Israeli foreign minister Gideon Saar in Washington on Wednesday, which is expected to take place at 3.15pm ET (7.15pm UK time). When asked on Fox News’ “Special Report with Bret Baier” show if there is a postwar plan for Gaza, Witkoff said: Yes, we’ve got a large meeting in the White House tomorrow, chaired by the president, and it’s a very comprehensive plan we’re putting together on the next day. He did not elaborate further and did not list the meeting’s participants. When asked should Israel be doing anything differently to end the war and secure the release of the hostages, Witkoff said: We think that we’re going to settle this one way or another, certainly before the end of this year. Witkoff said Israel was open to continuing discussions with Palestinian militant group Hamas. He said Hamas had signaled it was open to a settlement. Good morning and welcome back to the Guardian’s coverage of the Middle East. US special envoy Steve Witkoff said on Tuesday that president Donald Trump would chair a meeting on Gaza at the White House on Wednesday and added that Washington expected Israel’s war in the Palestinian territory to be settled by the end of the year. The US state department separately said secretary of state Marco Rubio will meet Israeli foreign minister Gideon Saar in Washington on Wednesday, which is expected to take place at 3.15pm ET (7.15pm UK time). When asked on Fox News’ “Special Report with Bret Baier” show if Israel be doing anything differently to end the war and secure the release of the hostages, Witkoff said: “We think that we’re going to settle this one way or another, certainly before the end of this year.” Witkoff said Israel was open to continuing discussions with Palestinian militant group Hamas. He said Hamas had signaled it was open to a settlement. Trump stunned the world earlier this year when he suggested the United States should take control of the Gaza Strip, clear out its 2 million inhabitants and build seaside real estate. The president had promised a swift end to the war in Gaza during the 2024 US election campaign and after taking office in January, but almost seven months into his term, that stated goal remains elusive. Trump’s term began with a ceasefire which lasted two months and ended when Israeli strikes killed about 400 Palestinians on 18 March. In recent weeks, images of starving Palestinians in Gaza, including children, have shocked the world and fuelled criticism of Israel over the worsening conditions. Hamas on Tuesday rejected an Israeli statement saying a strike on a Gaza hospital that killed several journalists was aimed at a camera operated by the militant group, calling the accusation “baseless”. The Israeli military on Tuesday said its forces were targeting a camera operated by Hamas in two strikes that killed five journalists at a hospital a day earlier, triggering a wave of international condemnation. Monday’s strike in southern Gaza’s Khan Younis killed at least 20 people, including the five reporters who worked for Al Jazeera, the Associated Press and Reuters, among other outlets. Hamas denied on Tuesday that any of the Palestinians killed in Israel’s attack on Gaza’s Nasser hospital on Monday were militants. Earlier, Israel said it had killed six militants in the attack but it was investigating how civilians, including five journalists, were killed. “We can confirm that the Reuters and AP journalists were not a target of the strike,” military spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani told Reuters on Tuesday. The UN has demanded that Israel’s investigations into unlawful killings in Gaza, including its “double tap” bombing of Nasser hospital, yield results and ensure accountability. “There needs to be justice,” Thameen Al-Kheetan, the spokesperson for the UN’s human rights office, told reporters on Tuesday in Geneva. He added that the number of journalists killed in Gaza raised many questions about the targeting of media workers. Tens of thousands of people took part in demonstrations across Israel on Tuesday, blocking highways on a “day of disruption” that aimed to push Benjamin Netanyahu into agreeing a deal to end the war and calling off plans to attack Gaza City. Relatives of hostages led the biggest march and rally in Tel Aviv, while in Jerusalem hundreds of people gathered outside the prime minister’s office as the security cabinet met to discuss the war. There were dozens of other protests around the country, including on the main highway to the northern city of Haifa and inside Ben Gurion airport. Israeli forces raided the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah on Tuesday, targeting a currency exchange and, according to the Red Crescent, leaving dozens of Palestinians wounded. Israel carries out frequent raids across the West Bank, where tensions have remained high throughout the Gaza war, but incursions into central Ramallah – seat of the Palestinian Authority – are relatively rare. The head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog has said a team of its inspectors are “back in Iran,” the first to enter since Israeli and US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities this year. Iran suspended cooperation with the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency after a 12-day war with Israel in June, with Tehran pointing to the IAEA’s failure to condemn Israeli and US strikes on its nuclear facilities. Iran held talks on Tuesday with European powers, seeking to avert a sanctions snapback which they have threatened to impose under the moribund 2015 nuclear deal. Kazem Gharibabadi, an Iranian deputy foreign minister who attended the talks with Britain, France and Germany in Geneva, said in a post on X it was “high time” for the European trio “to make the right choice and give diplomacy time and space”. French president Emmanuel Macron strongly rejected Benjamin Netanyahu’s recent criticism over rising antisemitism in France and warned the issue should not be “weaponised”, in a letter to the Israeli leader published on Tuesday. Rows have broken out about an increase in antisemitic acts and hate crimes in France as international tensions mount over the conflict in Gaza. US envoy Tom Barrack said on Tuesday that Washington would support the extension of the mandate of UN peacekeepers in Lebanon for one more year. A planned vote at the UN security council on the future of the UNIFIL peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, whose mandate ends on Sunday, has been postponed amid US and Israeli opposition to the draft text, several diplomatic sources told AFP. Journalists in Lebanon have demanded an apology from a senior US envoy after he told them to “act civilized” and not be “animalistic”. As reporters shouted questions after the US delegation’s meeting with the Lebanese president, Joseph Aoun, on Tuesday, Tom Barrack, the US ambassador to Turkey and special envoy to Syria, stepped up to the podium in the packed room and said: “We’re going to have a different set of rules … please be quiet for a moment. The moment that this starts becoming chaotic, like animalistic, we’re gone.” A man charged with setting fire to a Melbourne synagogue appeared in court on Wednesday over an attack Australia says was orchestrated by Iran and has led to the expulsion of Tehran’s ambassador. Australia said on Tuesday Iran sought to disguise its involvement in two 2024 attacks, at the Adass Israel Synagogue in Melbourne and on a kosher restaurant in Sydney, by using criminals and members of organised crime gangs. Australia on Wednesday dismissed suggestions by Israel that its interventions prompted Canberra to expel Iran’s ambassador as it blamed Tehran for directing at least two antisemitic arson attacks in the country’s biggest cities, Sydney and Melbourne. “Complete nonsense,” Home Affairs minister Tony Burke told ABC Radio, when asked about Israel claiming credit for Australia’s decision to order Tehran’s ambassador Ahmad Sadeghi to leave the country. Six Syrian soldiers were killed in Israeli drone strikes in the Damascus countryside, state-run El Ekhbariya TV reported early on Wednesday. Syria and Israel are engaged in US-mediated talks on easing tensions in southern Syria, with Damascus seeking a security deal that could open the door to wider political negotiations. The Israeli military said on Wednesday it intercepted a missile fired from Yemen, where Houthi rebels have regularly launched attacks they say are in response to Israel’s offensive in Gaza. “Following the sirens that sounded a short while ago in several areas in Israel, a missile that was launched from Yemen was intercepted by the IAF,” Israel’s army said on Telegram, referring to the air force.
