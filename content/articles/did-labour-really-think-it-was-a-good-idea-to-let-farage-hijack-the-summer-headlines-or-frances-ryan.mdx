  When parliament returns from its summer recess on Monday, Keir Starmer should
  not be surprised to find Nigel Farage camped out at the dispatch box. While
  Starmer has taken the traditional time off, the Reform UK leader has been in
  overdrive, from holding seven (increasingly chaotic) press conferences to
  featuring in glossy profiles in the broadsheets and adorning a further 22
  front pages. Throughout it all, Farage has had the air of a conman seeing how
  long he can get away with playing at prime minister before anyone notices.
  That this hasn’t needed to involve any actual governing has suited the I’m a
  Celeb alumni perfectly. Rightwing populism breeds on complaints rather than
  cabinet meetings, with Reform enjoying the media coverage of a major player
  and the lack of scrutiny of a nonentity. The impact of this has been
  staggering: concern over immigration – already seen by the public as the most
  important issue facing Britain – has shot up eight percentage points since
  July, according to Ipsos. And that’s before any bounce from Reform’s party
  conference this week. It is not as if Farage’s PM cosplay has been made
  difficult for him. He was given free rein to set the agenda this summer by a
  bored and willing press, with the same editors keen to oversaturate him at any
  time of year grateful for content to cover the “silly season” (protests by the
  far right are not the typical definition of silly). Farage has utilised being
  permitted to spread the myth that migrants are a threat to British women
  largely unchecked, testing out an ever-more divisive and adversarial racial
  line (as he recently put it in the Times: “Whose side are you on?”) Few have
  made it easier for Reform to fill the void than Starmer, who could have hardly
  done more if he had subletted Downing Street out to Farage and washed the
  towels. It is not that the prime minister hasn’t been working – last month, he
  disrupted his family holiday in Scotland to fly to Washington DC – or that he
  should not have had a break, of course, but that after pushing through the
  disastrous welfare bill, the entire government has seemingly disappeared from
  public view. The most pressing issues – immigration misinformation, far-right
  mobilisation, starvation in Gaza – have come and stayed in recent weeks with
  next to no input from our elected leaders. Ministers have been noticeably
  missing in action from media rounds, with Rachel Reeves – the most
  recognisable figure on the frontbench after Starmer – out of sight working on
  the autumn budget. The government in effect put its out-of-office on for
  August (“Taking time away until September. See you in Liverpool!”) and left
  the inbox to max out. This has only been compounded by the fact that, on the
  few occasions Labour has spoken out this summer, it has done so on Reform’s
  terms. When Farage announced his plan to detain and deport undocumented
  migrants last week, the Labour party chair, Ellie Reeves, lamented that he
  “can’t say where his detention centres will be”, as if the problem with
  interning human beings en masse is the challenge of finding a big enough car
  park. The bar has felt so low through the hot restless weeks that you could
  almost find yourself willing Labour to act, if not as the government, then at
  least as the opposition. Or to put it another way: it isn’t just that Farage
  has been allowed to set the agenda for the summer, but that he hasn’t even had
  to worry about Starmer’s team trying to challenge it. Add Kemi Badenoch’s
  complicity (her critique of Reform’s mass deportation policy was that the
  party had actually stolen it from the Conservatives), and the result is a
  political class that has given up its defences to the hard right, or even any
  pretence of one. We are seeing in real time where this takes a society. On
  Saturday, a group of masked men attempted to break into a hotel for asylum
  seekers in west London. The danger is never simply that the “bad guys” bleed
  fringe ideas into the mainstream – it is that the “good guys” (whatever that
  means any more) either do nothing, or worse, embrace them. Capitulation
  sometimes looks like politicians adopting ever-more hardline immigration
  policies; sometimes it looks like saying nothing when the other side pitches
  one. Often, it’s both. Labour’s summer has been defined by this indifference
  and inaction, as a government elected on a landslide only a year ago acts as
  if it were a tired spectator helpless to the political winds (or whichever way
  Farage and the media choose to blow them). There is a mix of defeatism and
  despair to it, both about the electorate and the country at large: the notion
  that Britain – increasingly characterised by the right as lawless, broken and
  invaded – is already lost. The Labour right has a default get-out clause to
  this: the only thing that matters is being electable. But that is hardly going
  well. A YouGov poll last week showed Labour has sunk to its lowest approval
  rating in six years, with only 20% of the public saying they would vote for
  the party at the next election. As he returns to work, Starmer is reportedly
  reshuffling his aides at No 10 to regain ground. But the real issue is not
  personnel – it is the project. What is the purpose of a Starmer government?
  And what courage can he find to deliver it? There is an alternative timeline
  in which Starmer acted decisively this summer. In this Sliding Doors scenario,
  the Labour leader stood firm against Israel, pulled the welfare cuts bill and
  challenged anti-migrant sentiment. It would be easy to be wistful for such an
  era of humane and fair governance until you remember this is meant to have
  really happened: the Conservatives were ousted, the “good guys” were elected,
  the human rights barrister was put in charge. As the weeks pass and the days
  darken, Starmer will try to regain the space that he left wide open. Whether
  Farage is willing to vacate it is another matter. Frances Ryan is a Guardian
