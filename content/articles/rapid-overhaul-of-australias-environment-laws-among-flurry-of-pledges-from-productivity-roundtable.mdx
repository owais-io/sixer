  Labor will introduce to parliament a long-awaited overhaul to national
  environmental laws before Christmas, after an expedited process was agreed
  upon at the economic reform roundtable. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said the
  three-day event had agreed the environment minister, Murray Watt, should
  proceed more quickly than a planned 18-month timeline. It was one of a flurry
  of announcements, including progress on road user charging for electric
  vehicles and a longer-term process to consider major tax reform. Labor had
  agreed on a deal with the Greens to pass changes to the Environment Protection
  and Biodiversity Conservation Act – including the creation of a national
  environment protection agency – at the end of 2024. But the plan was scuttled
  by Anthony Albanese over concerns from electorally sensitive Western
  Australia. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Chalmers said more detail on the
  new timeline would be forthcoming soon. The changes being considered would
  focus on stronger standards, faster approvals and more transparency, he said.
  Stakeholders expect progress from Watt by Christmas. “He’s [Watt] made a heap
  of progress, and it feels like that hard work that he’s put into it is bearing
  fruit,” Chalmers said. Almost five years have passed since Graeme Samuel
  handed his review of the EPBC Act to the Morrison government, exposing how the
  systemic failures of successive governments had left Australia’s unique
  species in unsustainable decline. Labor has pledged to speed up project
  approvals, including cutting cumbersome regulations. Similar moves are planned
  on housing developments, through the National Construction Code and work to
  progress a backlog of tens of thousands of applications. A mooted pause on
  changes to the code did not eventuate, with the housing minister, Clare
  O’Neil, instead charged with reducing complexity around the rules. ‘Time has
  come’ for EV road user charges The shift to electric vehicles around Australia
  is costing the budget due to falling fuel excise. Chalmers said a new system
  of road user charging for EV drivers represented “an idea whose time has
  come”. State treasurers will meet in early September to discuss an options
  paper, after delay from national cabinet since 2023, following the high
  court’s decision to overturn rules put in place by Victoria. Chalmers said
  there was healthy consensus on solving the problem, even if a final model was
  not settled. He said there was division on whether a new scheme should be
  introduced through a phased-in approach or a swifter model. Participants in
  the roundtable talks considered tax reform options on Thursday. They agreed
  another lengthy external review of the tax system would not be advantageous,
  and instead Treasury will work on options, with some external consultation.
  Change could focus on intergenerational fairness in the system, incentivising
  business investment rules to promote growth and making the system simpler. In
  recent days, Chalmers and Albanese had sought to downplay expectations the
  event could lead to major tax reform in this term of parliament. Chalmers
  indicated future changes were possible, but disagreed the talks at Parliament
  House represented a mandate for the government to act. “I think our tax system
  is imperfect, and one of its most troubling imperfections is best seen through
  intergenerational lens,” Chalmers said. Ten areas for immediate reform
  Chalmers announced 10 areas of consensus on immediate reform directions for
  Labor’s second term, covering a huge span of policy priorities – such as
  simplified processes for trade, better regulations and better recognition of
  workers’ skills and qualifications. Currently tens of thousands of skilled
  migrants are working below their qualification level in Australia, with
  barriers even present across state and territory boundaries. Longer term
  reforms include more changes to foreign investment rules, a move to more
  prefabricated and modular housing and new rules for AI. The attorney general,
  Michelle Rowland, will consider copyright law reform options, while guidelines
  for the technology’s application in the public service are also set to be
  considered. Business groups praised the “constructive” roundtable process, and
  said they were ready to continue to work with the government to progress the
  priorities identified by the treasurer. “It’s been a very productive three
  days,” Bran Black, the chief executive of the Business Council of Australia,
  said. “It’s easy to be cynical: that not much was achieved, or we should have
  done more. We’ve started on a pathway of making Australia a better place to
  work and to invest. “There’s a lot of work to be done around tax. There’s
  recognition that we need to make our tax system work better for business, and
  we’ll get down and do the hard work to achieve that.” ‘A totally different
  feel and vibe’ Andrew McKellar, the chief executive of the Australian Chamber
  of Commerce and Industry, said, “we want to see the government developing an
  ambitious agenda for reform that will drive productivity and economic growth
  in the years ahead”. “They’ve taken a very consultative approach to this. We
  appreciate that, and we want to continue forward in the spirit that we’ve had
  in the past three days.” Employer groups had entered into the roundtable
  meetings with some fears of a repeat of Labor’s jobs and skills summit in
  September 2022, which they believe was cover for the newly elected Albanese
  government to introduce major workplace reforms. Innes Willox, the head of the
  Industry Australia Group, said: “I still have nightmares” about that summit.
  “This was a totally different process, a totally different feel and vibe,”
  Willox said. “There was a very clear commitment from the government to get
  consensus where it could, agreement where it could and understandings where it
  could – to bring everyone together.” Sally McManus, the secretary of the ACTU,
  said while there were clear differences within the cabinet room, “in the end
  there was a lot of common ground” around the need for smart regulation of AI.
  “None of us want to see AI used in a way that’s going to destroy jobs. None of
  us want to see AI leading to theft, as is happening now, of the work of
  creatives and journalists and also academics.”
