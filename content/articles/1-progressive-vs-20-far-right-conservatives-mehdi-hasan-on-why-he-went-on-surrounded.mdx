  Mehdi Hasan knew he had gone viral. The broadcaster and author saw the views
  ticking up on YouTube; his phone was pinging incessantly. But the realisation
  that things had become, well, really quite surreal came when an older
  gentleman approached him at an event in Washington and, in Urdu, said: “I
  watched you with the 20 crazies.” The man was referring to the
  British-American commentator’s appearance on Surrounded, a gladiatorial
  one-v-many debate web series, hosted on YouTube by Jubilee Media. During the
  debate – billed as “1 Progressive vs 20 Far-Right Conservatives” – Hasan was
  asked about his “ethnic background”, by a man who the Guardian unmasked as the
  organiser of two violent far-right protests. Another debater laughed
  maniacally to applause while agreeing he was a fascist. He was later sacked
  and condemned – and then raised $30,000 (£22,300) from supporters on a
  Christian crowdfunding site. The video has now been viewed more than 10m
  times. “I saw the massive audience it gets with young people. I thought, well,
  that’s a good place to be,” says Hasan, who launched Zeteo, his own
  alternative news platform, last year. “But it’s really cut through in a way
  even I didn’t imagine – it’s been phenomenal for both good reasons and bad.”
  Hasan’s near two-hour debate – diced, sliced and repackaged for infinite
  resharing – has propelled Jubilee Media into the mainstream consciousness,
  sparking conversations about the political and societal impact of new media
  formats, and plenty of existential angst. Launched in 2017, the rapidly
  expanding entertainment company has attracted swathes of younger viewers by
  transforming polarised debate – never in short supply in Trump’s US – into
  eminently clippable content. The company also produces dating and game shows,
  but Surrounded – which pits one expert against a greater number of
  adversaries, who race to a single chair to make their point on a hot political
  topic – is its most notorious. In recent months Surrounded has gone where few
  traditional broadcasters would care to tread, with titles including “Flat
  Earthers vs Scientists: Can We Trust Science?” (31m views), or “Can 25 Liberal
  College Students Outsmart 1 Conservative? (Feat. Charlie Kirk)” (30m views).
  Its 2024 video with Ben Shapiro – in which a trans man tore into the rightwing
  pundit in a four-minute rant – was the fifth most-watched election-related
  content on YouTube. Its founder and chief executive, Jason Y Lee, who started
  Jubilee as a non-profit in 2010 after a video of him busking for charity went
  viral, told Variety that the company wants “to show what discourse can and
  should look like”. It could become, he argued, the “Disney for empathy”. But
  how does its performative pugilism sit with its stated aim to “provoke
  understanding and create human connection”? Spencer Kornhaber, who writes
  about popular culture for the Atlantic, believes the idealism is genuine, if
  shot through with ambition. “Empathy, in the Jubilee context, is standing for
  voyeurism and curiosity about other human beings,” says Kornhaber. “Lee didn’t
  say he wants to be the new UN. He wants to be Disney – a for-profit
  entertainment company that is culturally ubiquitous, will merchandise anything
  and is known for its ability to spin out franchises.” Jubilee has benefited
  from the proliferation of free-speech absolutism, as well as the internet’s
  shift to social and video, says Julia Alexander, a media correspondent for
  Puck News. But while it may have started with the aim of transforming negative
  conversations, it has, she claims, “succumbed to the hateful vitriol that
  defines a lot of social media”. It never stood a chance against the “unspoken
  but understood currency of the internet”, she adds: namely, that rage-fuelled
  and fearful content provokes more engagement than empathy or actually
  listening. “I hope that they choose to focus on creating positive content for
  the internet, God knows we can use it,” she says. “But I worry, because they
  are a company that is incentivised to continuously scale and perform better
  each quarter. They’ll have no choice but to continue doing more of these types
  of videos and just get more extreme.” Hasan, who is also a Guardian
  contributor, says he understands viewers’ attraction to the more extreme
  videos Jubilee has produced. He is the author of Win Every Argument, a book
  about the art of debating, and argues that traditional media deserted the
  battlefield, allowing platforms such as YouTube – now the No 1 source of
  televised entertainment in the US – to commandeer the space. “Mainstream media
  did such a shit job of facilitating debate and discussion and [giving a
  platform to] people with unorthodox views,” he says. “But I do think it’s a
  balancing act between the two extremes. Between censorship and narrowing of
  opinion and no standards at all, no guardrails, just put out anything you like
  on YouTube as long as it gets clicks.” He also understands – even agrees with
  – some of the criticism he has faced for going on Surrounded. The writer and
  disability rights advocate Imani Barbarin argued that while clips of Hasan’s
  takedown of far-right extremists had been shared by progressives trumpeting
  his “win”, an equal number had been shared as proof he lost. “We live in a
  meme-ified culture of politics,” said Barbarin, in a post on X. “Those moments
  are quite literally being plucked out of space and time […] the surrounding
  context of that moment no longer matters.” Hasan says if he has regrets, it
  was that he did not find out more about the people he was facing, arguing that
  he was not aware such extremists would be among them. But whether he regrets
  taking part overall? The jury is out. “I stand by what I said. I think I did a
  fair enough job as a debater,” he says. “The bigger meta question is whether
  the format itself is a problem. Is there value in doing these debates? And I
  don’t know the answer to that: maybe ask me in five years.”
