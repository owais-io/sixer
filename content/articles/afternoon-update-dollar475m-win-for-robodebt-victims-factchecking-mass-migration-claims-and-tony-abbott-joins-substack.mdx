  Good afternoon. The federal government has agreed to pay $475m in additional
  compensation to roughly 450,000 victims of the robodebt scandal, in the
  largest class action settlement in Australian history. The government
  announced on Thursday it had agreed to settle Knox v the commonwealth – an
  appeal from the original 2020 robodebt class action settlement. The appeal was
  launched last year after a royal commission exposed fresh evidence that
  commonwealth officials who ran the debt-raising scheme knew it was unlawful
  but proceeded anyway. The total settlement is $548.5m, with up to $60m set
  aside to administer the scheme and $13.5m to cover the applicants’ reasonable
  legal costs. Top news Neo-Nazi groups should be treated like criminal gangs to
  combat ‘hate-fuelled thuggery’, peak Jewish group says Jacinta Nampijinpa

  anti-immigration protesters (along with some politicians and mainstream media
  outlets) have made some big claims about Australia’s immigration numbers and

  these claims about immigration are. Watch the video here What they said … ***
