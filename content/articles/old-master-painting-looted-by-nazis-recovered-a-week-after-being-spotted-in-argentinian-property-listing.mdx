  Authorities in Argentina have recovered an 18th-century painting stolen more
  than 80 years ago by the Nazis from a Jewish art dealer in Amsterdam, a week
  after it was spotted by chance in a real estate listing. The painting, the
  long-lost Portrait of a Lady (Contessa Colleoni) by the Italian master
  Giuseppe Ghislandi, was looted in the second world war. It was handed over on
  Wednesday to the Argentinian judiciary by the daughter of the late Nazi
  financier Friedrich Kadgien, Patricia Kadgien, who has been under house arrest
  with her husband since Tuesday. Prosecutors allege the couple tried to conceal
  the stolen artwork. They face a hearing on Thursday on charges of concealment
  and obstruction of justice. The Guardian contacted her legal representatives,
  who declined to comment. The Dutch newspaper AD traced the painting after a
  years-long investigation that took a breakthrough turn last week when one of
  its reporters found Kadgien’s house in an online property listing in the
  seaside city of Mar del Plata. A photo in the listing showed the missing
  artwork – last seen in 1946 and belonging to the Dutch Jewish art dealer
  Jacques Goudstikker – hanging above a sofa in the couple’s living room. AD
  published its findings on 25 August. The next day, federal prosecutor Carlos
  Martínez ordered a raid on the property, but the painting was no longer there.
  Police seized two unlicensed firearms and two mobile phones. Four additional
  raids on Monday uncovered two other paintings that experts believe could date
  back to the 19th century, along with several drawings and engravings. The
  judiciary is analysing the works to determine whether they, too, were looted
  during the second world war. A federal court in Mar del Plata placed Kadgien
  and her husband under 72-hour house arrest on Tuesday. After the fall of the
  Third Reich at the end of the second world war, several high-ranking Nazi
  officials fled to South America. Friedrich Kadgien was among them. He fled the
  Netherlands in 1946, first to Switzerland, then Brazil, and finally to
  Argentina, where he had two daughters. The painting is believed to have
  accompanied him and to have remained in his family’s possession after he died
  in Buenos Aires in 1978. The portrait was among more than 1,000 works of art
  stolen by the Nazis from Goudstikker, who died in 1940 after falling in the
  hold of the ship carrying him to safety. Goudstikker’s heirs plan to reclaim
  the painting, AD reported.
