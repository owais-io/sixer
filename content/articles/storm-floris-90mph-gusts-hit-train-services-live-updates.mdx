  Storm Floris’ disruption to the rail network in Scotland will likely continue
  into Tuesday, passengers have been warned. Network Rail said it is working
  “tirelessly” to clear routes blocked by falling trees and debris. About 2,700
  homes in Ireland are still without power due to Storm Floris. Network Rail
  Scotland said wind gusts reaching 90mph from Storm Floris disrupted train
  services. The top wind speed recorded so far is 124mph at Cairngorm, a
  mountain range in northern Scotland, according to Met Office data. Aviation
  analytics company Cirium said 68 flights from UK airports on Monday have been
  cancelled. That is equivalent to 2.2% of all scheduled departures. More than
  22,000 properties are without electricity in the Highlands and north-east of
  Scotland as Storm Floris hits the country with high winds. Scottish and
  Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said it is working to restore power to
  22,500 properties while more are expected to be affected later in the day.
  Network Rail said power has been lost to part of the overhead wires on the
  west coast main line as it battles with disruption from Storm Floris. The west
  coast main line between Motherwell and Newton in South Lanarkshire was
  affected by the outage. There will be delays to the delivery of some exam
  results in island communities as a result of Storm Floris, the Scottish
  Qualifications Authority (SQA) has said. With results due on Tuesday, the SQA
  said deliveries to the Outer Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland will be delayed due
  to the adverse weather. In Scotland, police have warned drivers to stay away
  from two roads in Aberdeenshire and the western Highlands, which were blocked
  by fallen trees and overturned camper vans respectively. Angus council closed
  all its recycling centres from midday and said this morning that its bin
  collections would also be suspended from midday. While its council buildings
  remain open, the Scottish council asked people to “consider whether they need
  to attend any of our council buildings”. You can read more here. A fire has
  been reported on overhead lines at a train station in the south of Glasgow.
  Engineers have been called out to other incidents as Storm Floris brings
  travel disruption across Scotland, with trees falling on to tracks. A number
  of camper vans have been blown over on the A87 road, which leads to Portreee
  on the Isle of Skye, as Storm Floris hit Scotland. Police are advising drivers
  to stay away from the Bealach na Ba road in Wester Ross due to the high rinds.
  Network Rail Scotland have posted to X saying its engineers are dealing with
  fallen trees on tracks in the west of the country. “The team are responding to
  fallen trees at both Robroyston and Stepps on the Glasgow Queen Street –
  Cumbernauld route, and we’ve had a report of minor damage to the overhead
  wires,” it wrote in one social media post. The storm is due to clear from the
  Orkney and Shetland Isles on Tuesday morning, but showers will remain
  throughout the rest of the country, the Met Office said. Forecasters have
  warned people who are outdoors to avoid walking or seeking shelter near
  buildings or trees, and said that loose items including bins and garden
  furniture could blow away unless secured. Here is footage of the gusts of more
  than 100mph that have brought travel disruption, power cuts and the widespread
  cancellation of events across large parts of the UK. Gusts of more than 100mph
  from Storm Floris have brought travel disruption, power cuts and the
  widespread cancellation of events across large parts of the UK. Central and
  northern Scotland was the area most affected on Monday, causing the kind of
  problems normally seen on a stormy winter’s day. Met Office data showed a gust
  of 134mph was recorded at the summit of Cairn Gorm in the Highlands, 1,245
  metres above sea level. The strongest gust away from mountains was 80mph at
  South Uist. Storm Floris was the UK’s sixth named storm of the 2024-25 season
  and the first since Storm Éowyn in January. A number of councils in Northern
  Ireland have closed outdoor spaces including parks and recycling centres. The
  Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs has also advised the
  public not to visit affected forests and parks on Monday and Tuesday until the
  high winds have passed. The Kempes Stone Road in Dundonald, which was closed
  at the Greengraves Road due to a fallen tree, has now fully reopened. The top
  wind speed recorded so far is 124mph at Cairngorm, a mountain range in
  northern Scotland, according to Met Office data. Storm Floris was expected to
  bring winds of up to 90mph. Around 2,700 homes in Ireland are still without
  power due to Storm Floris. ESB Networks said: “ESB Networks can confirm that
  as of 5pm, approximately 2,700 homes, farms and businesses across the country
  are without power. “Crews will continue to work late into this evening with a
  view to restoring supply to the vast majority of impacted customers by
  tonight. “Real-time information on power outages and restoration times is
  available on www.PowerCheck.ie.” The statement added: “We apologise to all
  homes, farms and businesses impacted for the inconvenience caused.” Storm
  Floris’ disruption to the rail network in Scotland will likely continue into
  Tuesday, passengers have been warned. Network Rail said it is working
  “tirelessly” to clear routes blocked by falling trees and debris. However,
  some checks will need to be carried out on Tuesday morning. Network Rail
  Scotland said wind gusts reaching 90mph from Storm Floris have disrupted train
  services. A map shared on X showed areas with the highest wind speeds
  recorded, including one recording of 90mph. Aviation analytics company Cirium
  said 68 flights from UK airports on Monday have been cancelled. That is
  equivalent to 2.2% of all scheduled departures. More than 22,000 properties
  are without electricity in the Highlands and north-east of Scotland as Storm
  Floris hits the country with high winds. Scottish and Southern Electricity

  of Britain, near the Houses of Parliament in London. There will be delays to
  the delivery of some exam results in island communities as a result of Storm
  Floris, the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) has said. With results due
  on Tuesday, the SQA said deliveries to the Outer Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland
  will be delayed due to the adverse weather. The SQA said students should
  contact their school or college in the first instance who should be able to
  help them. Aviation analytics company Cirium said 68 flights from UK airports
  on Monday have been cancelled. That is equivalent to 2.2% of all scheduled
  departures. The worst-affected airports are Aberdeen and Belfast City, with 12
  and 10 cancellations respectively. More than 22,000 properties are without
  electricity in the Highlands and north-east of Scotland as Storm Floris hits
  the country with high winds. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN)
  said it is working to restore power to 22,500 properties while more are
  expected to be impacted later in the day. SSEN is the network operator for the
  north of Scotland. The company says it has hundreds of extra staff working but
  it may not be able to reconnect everyone by the end of the day. SSEN’s
  director of customer operations Andy Smith said: “Storm Floris is the
  strongest summer storm we’ve seen in a very long time and it’s causing
  significant disruption to power supplies today. “At the height of summer,
  we’ve mounted an operation that’s comparable in size to the ones we mobilise
  when a storm hits during the depths of winter, but the sustained nature of
  these damaging winds means some affected customers may be without power
  overnight.” He added: “Remember - you can report faults to us by calling 105
  at any time, or via the Power Track website or app. “And please - if you come
  across any network damage, stay well back and inform us immediately.” Scottish
  Green co-leader Lorna Slater says Storm Floris – which is brining unseasonal
  weather to parts of the UK – shows the need for urgent action to tackle the
  climate crisis. Slater said: We should not be seeing storms like this in
  August, but with climate chaos around us these kinds of scenes will only
  become more common and more severe. I urge everyone to stay safe and follow
  the guidance from the emergency services who are working to protect us all. I
  also urge employers to support workers who are being impacted by the storm and
  ensure that they are not being put in harm’s way or being asked to go into it
  unnecessarily. Our weather has been all over the place this summer, with heat
  waves and wild fires giving way to storms and everything in between. We cannot
  let this be our future. The truth is that the more urgent the crisis has
  become the less our governments are doing to address it. We need a focus on
  mitigations and defences, but we also need leaders who are willing to take the
  local and international action that is needed to climate-proof our future.
  Climate action is not just about managing our temperatures, it is about
  protecting people and the services we all rely on and ensuring that we have a
  society that is built to cope. Here are some more pictures of the damage
  caused by Storm Floris: Network Rail says power has been lost to part of the
  overhead wires on the west coast main line as it battles with disruption from
  Storm Floris. The west coast main line between Motherwell and Newton in South
  Lanarkshire was affected by the outage. In another incident, lines in
  Inverclyde were affected by a loss of power between Bishopton and Paisley. In
  Scotland, police have warned drivers to stay away from two roads in
  Aberdeenshire and the western highlands, which were blocked by fallen trees
  and overturned campervans respectively. Edinburgh Zoo has announced it is
  fully closed for the rest of the day due to “escalating wind speed”. Angus
  council closed all its recycling centres from midday and said this morning
  that its bin collections would also be suspended from midday. While its
  council buildings remain open, the Scottish council asked people to “consider
  whether they need to attend any of our council buildings”. You can read more
  here. In a post on X published about three and a half hours ago, Glasgow city
  council said that “all non-emergency operations” were to be suspended until at
  least 2pm (this would include refuse and recycling collections). The council
  is yet to post a further update on whether or not these services have resumed
  or not. A road in Aberdeenshire has been closed in both directions after a
  number of trees fell on as a result of Storm Floris. With high winds hitting
  Scotland, police advised drivers to avoid the A96 between Huntly and
  Inverurie. Police Scotland said: “The A96 is closed in both directions near
  Old Rayne between Huntly and Inverurie due to several fallen trees. “All road
  users are advised to avoid the area. “We are advising the public to plan ahead
  and consider delaying travel until conditions improve.” A fire has been
  reported on overhead lines at a train station in the south of Glasgow.
  Engineers have been called out to other incidents as Storm Floris brings
  travel disruption across Scotland, with trees falling onto tracks. Network
  Rail said: “We’re responding to reports of a fire on the overhead wires near
  Kings Park station in Glasgow’s south side. “Our local team are arranging a
  response to check this out as quickly as we can.” Earlier, a fallen tree was
  blown onto the overhead wires at Cornton level crossing, near Stirling. A
  number of campervans have been blown over on the A87 road, which leads to
  Portreee on the Isle of Skye, as Storm Floris hit Scotland. Police are
  advising drivers to stay away from the Bealach na Ba road in Wester Ross due
  to the high rinds. Police Scotland said: “We have received multiple reports of
  campervans being blown over on the A87 between Broadford and Portree due to
  high winds caused by Storm Floris. “We are advising motorists not to travel on
  the Bealach na Ba road and anyone with campervans should remain parked in
  sheltered areas until the wind speed reduces.” Met Office forecaster Peter
  Sloss has told BBC Radio Scotland’s Lunchtime Live Storm Floris is “very
  unusual” for August. “I think we’ve had five named storms, since the naming
  process started a number of years ago in August. “This one really is the most
  powerful of these storms that we’ve seen.” The forecaster said we are “sort of
  in unchartered territory at the moment”. Here are some more images that have
  been sent to us over the newswires that show the impact of Storm Floris: More
  than 10,000 homes in Ireland are now without power, with Co Donegal and Co
  Roscommon among the worst affected areas. A spokesperson for ESB Networks
  said: Yellow level winds associated with Storm Floris have led to a number of
  power outages across the country this morning, predominantly in the North West
  region. The impact on the electricity network has been modest and in line with
  previous such wind warnings. As of 10.30am, approximately 10,000 homes, farms
  and businesses across the country are without power. ESB Networks crews are
  mobilised in impacted areas and responding to power outages where safe to do
  so. Real-time information on power outages and restoration times is available
  on http://www.PowerCheck.ie. We apologise to all homes, farms and businesses
  impacted for the inconvenience caused. Network Rail Scotland have posted to X
  saying its engineers are dealing with fallen trees on tracks in the west of
  the country. “The team are responding to fallen trees at both Robroyston and
  Stepps on the Glasgow Queen Street – Cumbernauld route, and we’ve had a report
  of minor damage to the overhead wires,” it wrote in one social media post. In
  another update, Network Rail Scotland wrote: We’ve removed these fallen trees
  from the tracks at Giffnock, which have damaged our fencing. The team are now
  heading for Summerston, where a fallen tree is blocking the line there. Some
  of Scotland’s major road bridges have been closed to certain vehicles because
  of the storm. The Clackmannanshire Bridge and Skye Bridge are closed to
  high-sided vehicles, the Forth Road Bridge is closed to double deckers,
  motorcycles and pedestrians, while the Tyne Bridge in East Lothian is closed
  in both directions, according to BBC News. The A9 Dornoch Bridge, Highlands,
  was also closed due to high winds. Network Rail Scotland said wind gusts
  reaching 90mph from Storm Floris have disrupted train services. A map shared
  on X showed areas with the highest wind speeds recorded, including one
  recording of 90mph. The rail company said the west of Scotland had been
  particularly affected by disruption by 10am. Scottish &amp; Southern
  Electricity Networks (SSEN) said its teams are ready to respond to the
  “relatively rare summer storm” which is set to bring “sustained storm-force
  winds” across much of its network today and overnight into Tuesday. SSEN says
  its been monitoring the development of Storm Floris for several days, adding
  that projected wind gust speeds have increased over the last few days and
  could now be as high as 100mph in “exposed areas”. The SSEN website provides
  help and advice lines. In a press release, it said: We’ve already drafted in
  additional teams to further bolster our response to this storm. Hundreds of
  extra people have been stood up, and planned network maintenance has been
  cancelled so repairs can be prioritised. And on the weather forecast, SSEN
  said: A deep area of low pressure will slowly move across much of Scotland
  during the day. Argyll, the Highlands, the Western Isles, Perthshire, Angus,
  Moray and Aberdeenshire are likely to experience the strongest winds, and
  gusts in exposed areas of 100mph are possible. The Aberdeenshire area could
  experience sustained storm-force winds tonight and into the early hours of
  Tuesday. Edinburgh Castle, one of the city’s main tourist attractions, has
  been shut because of the adverse weather conditions forecasted to brought by
  Storm Floris. In a statement on its website, it says: “Unfortunately the
  castle will be closed on Monday 4 August due to forecast amber weather
  warnings from Storm Floris.” Here are some of the latest images being sent to
  us across the newswires after a yellow warning for northern England, Wales,
  Northern Ireland and parts of Scotland began at 06:00 BST. Weather alerts
  remain in place across the island of Ireland for strong winds after Storm
  Floris arrived overnight: Weather alerts remain in place across the island of
  Ireland for strong winds after Storm Floris arrived overnight. In the Republic
  of Ireland, thousands of homes are without power, while in Northern Ireland
  several flights have been cancelled and some public facilities closed, the PA
  news agency is reporting. Yellow weather warnings are in place in Northern
  Ireland and across several counties south of the border, although the island
  seems set to escape the worst of the storm. Wind gusts of up to 50mph are
  expected along with heavy spells of rain. Dublin Airport said flight
  operations were continuing as normal but Emerald Airlines had cancelled six
  flights on Monday. Passengers at airports in Northern Ireland have been
  advised to contact their airline directly for updates on the status of their
  flight. More than 7,000 homes in Ireland are without power with Co Donegal and
  Co Roscommon among the worst affected areas. A number of councils in Northern
  Ireland have closed outdoor spaces including parks and recycling centres. The
  department of agriculture, environment and rural affairs has also advised the
  public not to visit affected forests and parks on Monday and Tuesday until the
  high winds have passed. The amber warning for wind in Scotland, which came
  into effect at 10:00 BST, has been extended until 23:00 BST, and has been
  expanded northward to include Orkney. This is what the Met Office says to
  expect: Injuries and danger to life from large waves and beach material being
  thrown onto sea fronts, coastal roads and houses Some damage to trees and
  buildings, such as tiles blown from roofs, expected Longer journey times and
  cancellations on road, rail, air and ferry services Some roads and bridges
  closed Flying debris could lead to injuries or danger to life Power cuts with
  the potential to affect other services, such as mobile phone coverage The Met
  Office says wind gusts of 50 to 70 mph are expected for many parts of Scotland
  and are likely to reach 80 to 90 mph on some exposed coasts, hills and
  bridges. Here is an infographic showing the different Storm Floris weather
  warnings and what they mean for affected areas: Amber wind warnings are now in
  place for Scotland as we are past 10:00 BST. It is expected to be in place
  until 10pm and could bring injuries and danger to life in areas along the
  coast. Some roads and bridges will likely close, and there is a greater chance
  of power cuts and a greater risk of falling trees. Some flights from Glasgow
  Airport have been cancelled to Scotland’s islands this morning. Loganair has
  cancelled scheduled flights throughout the day, including to Barra, Benbecula
  and Tiree, while services to Campbeltown, a historic town in the Kintyre
  Peninsula, have also been cancelled. Separately, Ferry operator CalMac has
  issued a series of cancellations ahead of the storm. The Met Office has issued
  an amber weather warning for high winds across much of Scotland today, which
  will be in force between 10am and 10pm on Monday. The areas affected are: •
  Highlands &amp; Eilean Siar (Highland, Na h-Eileanan Siar) • Central, Tayside
  &amp; Fife (Angus, Clackmannanshire, Dundee, Falkirk, Fife, Perth and Kinross,
  Stirling) • Grampian (Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire, Moray) • South East Scotland (
  East Lothian, Edinburgh, Midlothian Council, Scottish Borders, West Lothian) •
  Strathclyde (Argyll and Bute, East Ayrshire, East Dunbartonshire, East
  Renfrewshire, Glasgow, Inverclyde, North Ayrshire, North Lanarkshire,
  Renfrewshire, South Lanarkshire, West Dunbartonshire) The Royal Edinburgh
  Military Tattoo performance this evening has been cancelled due to Storm
  Floris. Edinburgh Tattoo wrote in a post on X: We’re sorry to announce that
  due to adverse weather warnings, we have made the difficult decision to cancel
  tomorrow’s performance on 4 August at 9:30 pm. We understand this will be
  disappointing, but the safety of our audience, performers and staff is our top
  priority. The annual variety show, traditionally set against the iconic
  backdrop of Edinburgh Castle, is due to take place this year through Monday to
  Saturday between 1 and 23 August. ScotRail has also asked anyone with garden
  equipment such as trampolines to keep them secure, as Storm Floris begins to
  hit Scotland. Posting to X, the rail operator said: We’re asking anyone with
  garden equipment, such as tents, trampolines or furniture, to secure items so
  that they don’t blow onto the tracks and interfere with lineside equipment.
  ScotRail has warned members of the public about the major disruption facing
  passengers today because of Storm Floris, which it says will “bring
  unseasonably strong and disruptive winds” across all parts of Scotland on
  Monday. A yellow warning for wind for northern parts of the UK became active
  at 6am on Monday and will last until 6am on Tuesday. The warnings have been
  upgraded to amber for much of Scotland and will be in effect from 10am to
  10pm. The strongest winds are expected to be across the western Isles and the
  north of mainland Scotland. Parts of Scotland could see gusts of 80 to 90 mph
  for a time. In a press release published on its website yesterday, ScotRail
  wrote: Blanket 50mph speed restrictions will be implemented from Network Rail
  across all ScotRail’s routes because of the poor weather conditions. This will
  mean fewer normal services and the complete closure of some lines. Other
  routes will see their last service run at around midday today. ScotRail is
  advising passengers to check their journeys in advance online or via its app
  so they don’t get caught up in the disruption. Network Rail engineers will
  inspect the closed lines for any damage once the storm has passed so services
  will start later on Tuesday across affected routes. We have some more comments
  from Jim Dale, the founder of the British Weather Services who has been
  speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this morning. The meteorologist
  said: Remember this is summertime: people are milling around on holiday, bank
  holiday in Scotland, for example. So some ‘summer articles’, if you like, in
  gardens, on the beaches, are all going to be there: slides, picnic tables,
  swings, all ready to be thrown around by the wind. That’s the danger that
  we’ve got at this moment in time. These ones (alerts) are put out for very,
  very good reason. If you are venturing out: keep away from the forest, keep
  away from the woods, keep off the coastal plain … It’ll become extremely rough
  on those coasts as the high tide comes in. We aren’t getting many images in
  yet but our picture services have sent these from Blackpool today. A
  meteorologist has warned people in regions affected by a weather alert to
  “watch their backs” as Storm Floris brings unseasonably strong winds. A yellow
  warning for wind for northern parts of the UK became active at 6am on Monday
  and will last until 6am on Tuesday. The amber warning in place for much of
  Scotland will last from 10am to 10pm. Jim Dale, founder of the British Weather
  Services, has described the storm as “serious” and “unusual” for the summer
  months. He told the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Monday: “The yellow
  warning does expand down into northern England, north Wales, Northern Ireland.
  “So it’s still going to be gusty day - you’re going to have to watch your
  back.” Good morning and welcome to our blog covering Storm Floris with a
  yellow weather warning for wind already in effect for a swath of the northern
  UK and an amber wind alert for much of Scotland due to start at 10am. Heavy
  rain and winds of up to 85mph are possible, the Met Office said. Some trains
  and ferry services have already been cancelled with more likely to be
  affected. Train operator LNER has told passengers not to travel north of
  Newcastle while Avanti West Coast has advised passengers not to travel north
  of Preston, warning it will be “heavily impacted” by the weather. Stay with
  for all the developments.

Storm Floris’ disruption to the rail network in Scotland will likely continue into Tuesday, passengers have been warned. Network Rail said it is working “tirelessly” to clear routes blocked by falling trees and debris. About 2,700 homes in Ireland are still without power due to Storm Floris. Network Rail Scotland said wind gusts reaching 90mph from Storm Floris disrupted train services. The top wind speed recorded so far is 124mph at Cairngorm, a mountain range in northern Scotland, according to Met Office data. Aviation analytics company Cirium said 68 flights from UK airports on Monday have been cancelled. That is equivalent to 2.2% of all scheduled departures. More than 22,000 properties are without electricity in the Highlands and north-east of Scotland as Storm Floris hits the country with high winds. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said it is working to restore power to 22,500 properties while more are expected to be affected later in the day. Network Rail said power has been lost to part of the overhead wires on the west coast main line as it battles with disruption from Storm Floris. The west coast main line between Motherwell and Newton in South Lanarkshire was affected by the outage. There will be delays to the delivery of some exam results in island communities as a result of Storm Floris, the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) has said. With results due on Tuesday, the SQA said deliveries to the Outer Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland will be delayed due to the adverse weather. In Scotland, police have warned drivers to stay away from two roads in Aberdeenshire and the western Highlands, which were blocked by fallen trees and overturned camper vans respectively. Angus council closed all its recycling centres from midday and said this morning that its bin collections would also be suspended from midday. While its council buildings remain open, the Scottish council asked people to “consider whether they need to attend any of our council buildings”. You can read more here.

Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said it is working to restore power to 22,500 properties while more are expected to be impacted later in the day. Network Rail says power has been lost to part of the overhead wires on the west coast main line as it battles with disruption from Storm Floris. The west coast main line between Motherwell and Newton in South Lanarkshire was affected by the outage.

Aviation analytics company Cirium said 68 flights from UK airports on Monday have been cancelled. That is equivalent to 2.2% of all scheduled departures. The worst-affected airports are Aberdeen and Belfast City, with 12 and 10 cancellations respectively.

Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said it is working to restore power to 22,500 properties while more are expected to be impacted later in the day. SSEN is the network operator for the north of Scotland. The company says it has hundreds of extra staff working but it may not be able to reconnect everyone by the end of the day. SSEN’s director of customer operations Andy Smith said: “Storm Floris is the strongest summer storm we’ve seen in a very long time and it’s causing significant disruption to power supplies today. “At the height of summer, we’ve mounted an operation that’s comparable in size to the ones we mobilise when a storm hits during the depths of winter, but the sustained nature of these damaging winds means some affected customers may be without power overnight.” He added: “Remember - you can report faults to us by calling 105 at any time, or via the Power Track website or app. “And please - if you come across any network damage, stay well back and inform us immediately.” Scottish Green co-leader Lorna Slater says Storm Floris – which is brining unseasonal weather to parts of the UK – shows the need for urgent action to tackle the climate crisis. Slater said: We should not be seeing storms like this in August, but with climate chaos around us these kinds of scenes will only become more common and more severe. I urge everyone to stay safe and follow the guidance from the emergency services who are working to protect us all. I also urge employers to support workers who are being impacted by the storm and ensure that they are not being put in harm’s way or being asked to go into it unnecessarily. Our weather has been all over the place this summer, with heat waves and wild fires giving way to storms and everything in between. We cannot let this be our future. The truth is that the more urgent the crisis has become the less our governments are doing to address it. We need a focus on mitigations and defences, but we also need leaders who are willing to take the local and international action that is needed to climate-proof our future. Climate action is not just about managing our temperatures, it is about protecting people and the services we all rely on and ensuring that we have a society that is built to cope. Here are some more pictures of the damage caused by Storm Floris: Network Rail says power has been lost to part of the overhead wires on the west coast main line as it battles with disruption from Storm Floris.

Hundreds of extra people have been stood up, and planned network maintenance has been cancelled so repairs can be prioritised. And on the weather forecast, SSEN said: A deep area of low pressure will slowly move across much of Scotland during the day. Argyll, the Highlands, the Western Isles, Perthshire, Angus, Moray and Aberdeenshire are likely to experience the strongest winds, and gusts in exposed areas of 100mph are possible. The Aberdeenshire area could experience sustained storm-force winds tonight and into the early hours of Tuesday.

We have some more comments from Jim Dale, the founder of the British Weather Services who has been speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this morning. The meteorologist said: Remember this is summertime: people are milling around on holiday, bank holiday in Scotland, for example. So some ‘summer articles’, if you like, in gardens, on the beaches, are all going to be there: slides, picnic tables, swings, all ready to be thrown around by the wind. That’s the danger that we’ve got at this moment in time. These ones (alerts) are put out for very, very good reason. If you are venturing out: keep away from the forest, keep away from the woods, keep off the coastal plain … It’ll become extremely rough on those coasts as the high tide comes in. We aren’t getting many images in yet but our picture services have sent these from Blackpool today.
