  Australia’s three-time Olympic slalom canoe champion Jess Fox says she has had
  to deal with a “whirlwind” few weeks after undergoing surgery to remove a
  tumour from her kidney. The 31-year-old went under the knife last week in a
  successful procedure but she suffered some post-surgery complications and
  issued a statement on Thursday to say she was now recovering well. “It’s been
  a whirlwind over the last few weeks, but I’m all good – just a couple of
  gnarly new scars, a bit less kidney, and a whole lot more toughness,” Fox
  said. “I’m feeling positive and looking forward to heading home, focusing on
  recovery, and then building towards being back on the water again.” The
  surgery means Fox will not compete in the remaining World Cup events in Europe
  and will instead focus on her recovery at home. Fox can rightfully lay claim
  to be one of Australia’s greatest Olympians, having won a total of six medals,
  including three golds across the 2020 and 2024 Games. In Tokyo she won her
  first slalom canoe gold before adding another in Paris, along with victory in
  the kayak singles. The clash with her sister Noémie in the kayak cross event
  was one of the most anticipated moments of the Paris Games – though Jess was
  eliminated from the same heat as her sibling, who went on to win gold herself
  – and the older Fox has been ubiquitous on TV screens and advertising
  billboards ever since. The Australian Olympic Committee president, Ian
  Chesterman, said Fox had the AOC’s full support during what has been a
  difficult time for her, her family and support crew. “But the one thing we
  know is that Jess is an incredibly resilient person and she has faced this
  latest challenge with her renowned determination and fight, just as you’d
  expect,” Chesterman said. “Through her incredible efforts in sport and the
  many other projects where she is making a difference, Jess has impacted on the
  lives of so many, not just in Australia but across the world. I know that all
  those people will now be cheering for her to make a full and speedy recovery
  and are looking forward to seeing her back on the water. “Jess is an
  extraordinary person and a true inspiration. For now, she needs to concentrate
  on getting better and then we can’t wait to see her back in action.”
