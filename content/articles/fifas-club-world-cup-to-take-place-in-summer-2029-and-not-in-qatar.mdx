  Fifa has told the continental confederations that the next Club World Cup will
  take place in the summer of 2029 in a move that would appear to kill off a
  proposed bid from Qatar to host the tournament. In another significant
  development, Fifa has informed the confederations that the next edition is
  likely to feature more than the 32 clubs that competed in the United States
  this summer. The Guardian revealed in June that Fifa was under pressure from
  leading clubs to expand the Club World Cup to 48 teams, with the lobbying
  intensifying since last month’s tournament, which resulted in the winners,
  Chelsea, receiving £85m from the £750m prize and participation fund. While
  Fifa is understood to have indicated that some expansion is likely for 2029,
  an immediate leap to the 48-team model that will be used for the first time
  for the men’s World Cup next year is not guaranteed. The women’s World Cup is
  also due to expand to 48 teams in 2031 after two editions with 32 teams in a
  clear indication of Fifa’s direction of travel. Fifa is considering an
  alternative structure for the 2029 Club World Cup based on a series of
  qualifying playoffs the week before the main tournament, with the winners
  advancing to the competition. A single playoff game between Los Angeles FC and
  the Mexican side Club América to determine the final Club World Cup entrant
  from Concacaf was held after the expulsion of another Mexican club, León, for
  breaching multi-club ownership rules. Although it was introduced at the
  11th-hour due to León’s regulatory issues, Fifa viewed the playoff as a
  success. Senior figures have expressed the view that a series of knockout
  matches could generate additional buzz before the tournament and at the end of
  the European season, as well as increasing the value of its TV rights. They
  were bought by Dazn for £750m this year in a deal funded by Saudi Arabia’s
  Surj Sports Investment. Single-leg playoffs would create fewer player-welfare
  issues than almost doubling the number of matches from 64 to 104, which would
  be required if Fifa expanded from 32 to 48 clubs. Fifa is already facing a
  legal complaint from the lobby group European Leagues and the global players’
  union, FifPro, while the European Commission is yet to decide whether to
  launch a formal investigation. Fifa’s notification that the 2029 tournament
  will take place in the summer may help improve relations with European
  leagues, as there had been concerns it would be moved to the following winter
  if Qatar were granted hosting rights. Senior officials from Qatar held talks
  with Fifa in Miami in June about bidding for the tournament, but confirmation
  of the timetable may put them off. Spain and Morocco are now the most likely
  hosts before they help co-host the 2030 men’s World Cup. Portugal, the third
  host nation, has yet to express much interest, but its smaller stadiums would
  be suitable for a pre-qualifying tournament. Fifa may ultimately move to
  staging the Club World Cup every two years as it appears determined to
  challenge Uefa’s historical control of international club competitions, but
  that is not on the agenda until after 2030, when the current international
  match calendar expires. Fifa declined to comment.
