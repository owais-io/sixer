  devastating coral bleaching

  The Great Barrier Reef has suffered its biggest annual drop in live coral in
  two out of three areas monitored by scientists since 1986, a new report has
  revealed. The Australian Institute of Marine Science (Aims) report is the
  first to comprehensively document the devastating impacts of the early 2024
  mass coral bleaching event – the most widespread and severe on record for the
  Great Barrier Reef. In the months that followed, scientists described a
  “graveyard of corals” around Lizard Island in the north and a study recorded
  the death of 40% of corals at One Tree Island in the south. Aims has conducted
  annual in-water surveys of the world’s biggest reef system since 1986,
  checking the health and extent of corals. Sign up to get climate and
  environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletter This
  year’s survey report found that in the reef’s northern section – between
  Cooktown and the tip of Cape York – bleaching, two cyclones and associated
  flooding had caused coral cover to fall by 25%. In the southern section, from
  Mackay to just north of Bundaberg, coral cover had fallen by 30%. The northern
  and southern zones suffered the highest annual drops on record. Coral cover
  fell by 13% in the central section, which had escaped the worst of the heat in
  2024. Dr Mike Emslie, who leads the long-term reef monitoring program at Aims,
  said coral cover was becoming more volatile. “It has been a pretty sobering
  year of surveys with the biggest impacts I have seen in the 30-plus years I
  have been doing this,” he said. “This volatility is very likely a sign of an
  unstable system. That’s our real concern. We’re starting to see record highs
  in coral cover that quickly get turned around to record falls.” With
  relatively benign impacts from cyclones and bleaching in the five years before
  the 2024 event, coral cover had reached record levels in some places. But that
  recovery, Emslie said, was largely driven by fast-growing acropora corals that
  were more susceptible to heat stress. “We had said it could all get turned
  around in one year and, low and behold, here we are,” he said, adding that
  coral cover was now mostly back in line with long-term averages. ‘Closer and
  closer’ The 2024 and 2025 events were part of an ongoing global mass coral
  bleaching event that led to more than 80% of the planet’s reefs being hit with
  enough heat to cause bleaching, affecting corals in at least 82 countries and
  territories. A study last year found ocean temperatures on the Great Barrier
  Reef were probably at their hottest for at least 400 years and were an
  “existential threat” to the Unesco world heritage-listed reef. Widespread mass
  bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef was first seen in 1998 and happened again
  in 2002, 2016, 2017, 2020, 2022, 2024 and 2025. “These impacts we are seeing
  are serious and substantial and the bleaching events are coming closer and
  closer together,” Emslie said. “We will ultimately get to a tipping point
  where coral cover can’t bounce back because disturbances come so quickly that
  there’s no time left for recovery. “We have to mitigate the root causes of the
  problem and reduce emissions and stabilise temperatures.” The Aims report
  comes a month before the federal government is due to reveal its emissions
  reduction target for 2035. The Albanese government promised Unesco last year
  it would “set successively more ambitious emissions reduction targets” that
  would be “in alignment with efforts to limit global temperature increase to
  1.5C”. Last week the Climate Change Authority, which will advise the
  government on what target to set, released a report that said holding warming
  “as close as possible to 1.5C” was key to addressing the threats facing the
  reef. Richard Leck, head of oceans at WWF Australia, said the government
  needed to set a target consistent with 1.5C. “This is the one action the
  government can take to give the reef a fighting chance.”
