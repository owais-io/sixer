  Republican state legislators in California filed suit on Tuesday to block a
  mid-year redistricting plan meant to counter Texas’s effort to redraw
  congressional district lines. The emergency petition argues that the process
  being used in the California assembly violates laws requiring a 30-day period
  between the introduction of legislation and voting on it. “Instead of a
  months-long transparent and participatory process overseen by an independent
  citizens redistricting commission for such a sensitive matter, the public
  would be presented instead with an up or down vote on maps unilaterally
  prepared in secret by the legislature,” states the filing on behalf of
  senators Tony Strickland and Suzette Martinez Valladares, assemblymember Tri
  Ta and assemblymember Kathryn Sanchez. California’s governor, Gavin Newsom,
  announced his state’s redistricting plan last week in terms on social media
  mocking Donald Trump’s flamboyance, intent on using the voting power of the
  US’s most populous state to counteract Texas’s redrawn map, which would be
  expected to deliver a net gain of five congressional seats to Republicans in
  2026. Newsom praised the California effort on Monday, calling it a necessary
  response to Trump’s influence over redistricting in Texas and other
  Republican-led states. “We are not going to sit idle while they command Texas
  and other states to rig the next election to keep power,” Newsom said, adding
  that the proposal gives Californians “a choice to fight back”. To do so in
  time for a special election in November, the state assembly must pass the plan
  this year. As has been a common practice near the end of legislative terms,
  California lawmakers took an existing bill introduced earlier in the session
  and gutted it of its language, replacing it with legislation that overrides
  the state’s neutral redistricting commission to present maps to voters.
  California Democrats are expected to advance their proposal out of committees
  on Tuesday and Wednesday. They have already received more than 13,000 public
  comments through an online portal, and the committee hearings offer the public
  a chance to provide feedback to lawmakers in person. Dozens of residents from
  up and down the state, leaders of local Republican groups and the conservative
  California Family Council showed up to a hearing on Tuesday to voice
  opposition to Democrats’ plan. Some said the process has been shrouded in
  secrecy because the map was drawn without meaningful public input. Others said
  they would rather lawmakers focus on addressing issues instead of trying to
  bypass a bipartisan redistricting process. Public remarks may have little
  sway, though, as Democratic leaders are determined to rapidly advance the
  proposal. A Senate hearing on Tuesday began with key Democratic political
  allies testifying in support. Jodi Hicks, CEO of Planned Parenthood
  California, said Democrats need to take back the US House to protect women’s
  freedoms. “If we don’t fight back, federal attacks on reproductive health care
  will only get worse,” Hicks said. Republican lawmakers said the plan would
  create mistrust among residents who already voted in 2010 to remove partisan
  influence from the mapmaking process. California voters gave that power to an
  independent commission, while Texas is among states where legislators draw
  maps. “There are so many illegal and unethical elements in this attempt,”
  Republican state senator Steven Choi said. On Tuesday, a spokesperson for
  Newsom said the governor was unconcerned with the legal challenge seeking to
  blunt his redistricting effort. “Republicans are filing a deeply unserious
  (and truly laughable) lawsuit to stop Americans from voting?” Brandon
  Richards, the spokesperson, said. “We’re neither surprised, nor worried.” The
  Mandeep Dhillon law firm filing the suit was previously owned by Harmeet
  Dhillon, who is now assistant attorney general overseeing the US Department of
  Justice civil rights division. Dhillon was known for her efforts to sue
  California’s university system to overturn policies which barred controversial
  conservative speakers from appearing. She sold her firm to her brother Mandeep
  Singh Dhillon after Trump nominated her to take over civil rights enforcement
  in his administration. The suit does not challenge “gut and amend” in
  principle, but rather asks the court “to enforce an external constitutional
  constraint against the Legislature to protect the people’s rights”. Internal
  polling presented to lawmakers showed voters favored the measure 52% to 41%,
  with 7% undecided, according to the local television station KCRA. Republicans
  in California condemned the proposal as an assault on the state’s
  voter-approved independent redistricting commission and said they plan to
  introduce legislation that advocates for creating similar map-drawing bodies
  in all 50 states. “Governor Newsom, this is nothing more than a power grab,”
  Strickland said during a Monday news conference in Sacramento. He warned the
  redistricting tit-for-tat sets a dangerous precedent that will not be easily
  undone. “The Golden Gate Bridge toll was supposed to be temporary,” he added.
  “You’re still paying the toll.” The legislature could hold floor votes to send
  the measure to voters for approval as soon as Thursday, KCRA reported. House
  Republicans currently hold a razor-thin three-seat majority in the US House
  and Trump has pushed to redraw district boundaries ahead of next year’s
  midterm elections, in which the president’s party typically loses seats.
  Republicans are also poised to redraw congressional districts in Ohio,
  Missouri and Florida, and potentially Indiana.
