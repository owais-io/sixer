  We are wrapping up our live coverage of the second Trump administration for
  the day, but will be back at it on Friday. In the meantime, here are the
  latest developments: The Texas attorney general Ken Paxton and state house
  speaker Dustin Burrows have filed a lawsuit in Illinois to enforce arrest
  warrants against Democratic lawmakers who left Texas to block Republicans from
  enacting a gerrymandered congressional map that would likely add five more
  Republican seats before next year’s midterm elections. The civil petition was
  filed in an Adams county, Illinois, circuit court, about a four and a half
  hour drive from Chicago. More than 30 Texas Democratic members are named in
  the suit. Donald Trump’s administration turned to the US supreme court in an
  effort to defend its aggressive immigration raids after a federal judge in Los
  Angeles blocked agents from profiling individuals based on race or language in
  pursuit of deportation targets. The justice department asked the supreme court
  in an emergency filing to lift the judge’s order temporarily barring agents
  from stopping or detaining people without “reasonable suspicion” that they are
  in the country illegally, by relying solely on their race or ethnicity, or if
  they speak Spanish or English with an accent. Donald Trump will announce a
  peace deal between Azerbaijan and Armenia on Friday 8 August, according to
  reports from both Reuters and CBS News. The respective leaders of both
  Azerbaijan and Armenia, Ilham Aliyev and Nikol Pashinyan, will attend events
  at the White House tomorrow, despite decades-long tension between the two
  countries. Colleges and universities will be forced to disclose more student
  admissions data to prove that they are not implementing affirmative action
  policies, according to a directive sent by the White House on Thursday. The
  move comes as the Trump administration seeks to crack down on the use of race
  in the higher education application process. Ivy League universities, like
  Brown University, have reached settlements that require them to release
  information about applicants’ race. More than 60 countries around the world
  are scrambling to respond to the latest wave of US tariffs announced by Donald
  Trump, which came into force on Thursday. Industry representatives in rich and
  poor countries warned of job losses as the tariffs upended a decades-old world
  trading system with rates ranging from 10% to 39%, 40% and 41% for
  Switzerland, Brazil and Syria. All over the globe, leaders were attempting to
  put contingencies in place after Trump’s tariff threats turned to reality at a
  minute past midnight Washington time. Donald Trump has said he was ready to
  meet Vladimir Putin despite the Russian leader’s refusal to meet Ukraine’s
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy – dispelling speculation that direct talks between the two
  warring presidents were a precondition to a high-level US-Russia summit.
  Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump said that Putin
  did not have to meet with Zelenskyy first before the US and Russian presidents
  could meet. Donald Trump has called on Intel’s chief executive to resign,
  alleging Lip-Bu Tan had ties to the Chinese Communist party, sending the stock
  of the US chipmaker falling. “The CEO of Intel is highly CONFLICTED and must
  resign, immediately,” Trump posted on Truth Social about Tan. “There is no
  other solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!”
  Donald Trump announced on Thursday that he has ordered the commerce department
  to conduct a new census that would exclude undocumented immigrants from the
  official count. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said the census would be
  “based on modern day facts and figures” and use “results and information
  gained from the Presidential Election of 2024”. He added that “people who are
  in our country illegally will not be counted”. The US energy secretary, Chris
  Wright, is facing growing criticism from scientists who say their “worst
  fears” were realized when Wright revealed that the Trump administration would
  “update” the US’s premier climate crisis reports. Wright, a former oil and gas
  executive, told CNN’s Kaitlin Collins earlier this week that the
  administration was reviewing national climate assessment reports published by
  past governments. A coalition of conservation groups has welcomed a federal
  judge’s ruling on Thursday that halts construction work on the immigration
  jail in the Florida Everglades known as Alligator Alcatraz. US district judge
  Kathleen Williams ordered workers to stop adding any new paving,
  infrastructure or ground filling at the remote tented detention camp that the
  Trump administration intends to use to eventually hold 3,000 immigrants
  awaiting deportation. Leading Democrats are sounding the alarm over Donald
  Trump’s reported plan to divert funds from the US nuclear arsenal to convert a
  luxury jet gifted by Qatar into a new Air Force One. The US president provoked
  an outcry in May when it emerged that he would accept a $400m Boeing 747-8 jet
  as a free gift from the Qatari royal family. Stripping down and securing the
  plane so it can transport Trump for a few years will cost taxpayers an
  estimated $1bn. The Trump administration plans to increase the federal law
  enforcement presence in Washington DC as early as Friday morning, CBS News
  reports. The move follows the alleged assault of a former staffer of the
  so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), Edward Coristine, over
  the weekend. In a Truth Social post on Wednesday, Trump said that he may place
  DC under federal control if the city doesn’t “get its act together, and
  quickly”. Officers will come from the DC national guard, FBI, US marshals,
  Ice, US Secret Service and other components of the Department of Homeland
  Security, according to an official who spoke with the news outlet. A White
  House official told CBS News that the increased federal law enforcement
  presence on DC streets would begin at midnight Thursday and focus on tourist
  areas and other known hot spots. Representative Ayanna Pressley of
  Massachusetts and several lawmakers on Thursday called for a congressional
  hearing to “prioritize the individuals who survived the horrific abuse
  associated with Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, and their associates”. In
  a letter to chair James Comer of the House committee on oversight and
  government reform, representatives Ro Khanna, Raja Krishnamoorthi, Robert
  Garcia and others said that survivors must be given the opportunity to share
  their stories in order to support their healing and to ensure a transparent
  investigation. “If the Committee is to conduct credible oversight, it must
  hear directly from survivors, or their representatives, who volunteer to
  advance our investigation on their own terms,” reads the letter. “Some
  survivors have expressed a clear willingness and desire to come before
  Congress, and the Committee cannot meet their strength and bravery with
  inaction.” The Texas attorney general Ken Paxton and state house speaker
  Dustin Burrows have filed a lawsuit in Illinois to enforce arrest warrants
  against Democratic lawmakers who left Texas to block Republicans from enacting
  a gerrymandered congressional map that would likely add five more Republican
  seats before next year’s midterm elections. The civil petition was filed in an
  Adams county, Illinois, circuit court, about a four-and-a-half-hour drive from
  Chicago. More than 30 Texas Democratic members are named in the suit. Other
  Democrats are staying in New York and Massachusetts. “We are pursuing every
  legal remedy at our disposal to hold these rogue legislators accountable,”
  said Paxton. “Texas deserves representatives who do their jobs instead of
  running away at the behest of their billionaire handlers.” State
  representative John Bucy III from Austin condemned the move, and said that
  Paxton and Burrows were using “the justice system to hunt down their political
  opponents and silence the voices of millions of Texans and Americans across
  the country”. “It’s now more clear than ever that Republicans are scared,” he
  added. “They’re scared of the voters. They’re scared of being held
  accountable.” During an interview with Fox News, Benjamin Netanyahu said the
  New York Times “should be sued” after the newspaper amended an article about
  starvation in Gaza to include that a child featured in the story, Mohammed
  Zakaria al-Mutawaq, had a pre-existing medical condition that affects his
  appearance, in addition to having severe malnutrition. The Times responded to
  the prime minister of Israel via a statement on X, asserting that “attempts to
  threaten independent media providing vital information and accountability to
  the public are unfortunately an increasingly common playbook”. “Journalists
  continue to report from Gaza for The Times, bravely, sensitively, and at
  personal risk, so that readers can see firsthand the consequences of the war,”
  the statement reads. Obtaining food in Gaza has become an increasingly
  difficult and deadly endeavor. Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed, many
  of them by Israeli forces, while heading toward aid sites. More than 20,000
  children were admitted for treatment for acute malnutrition between April and
  mid-July, with more than 3,000 severely malnourished, according to the
  Integrated Food Security Phase Classification. The Guardian made a separate
  comment when we first published the picture on the homepage and the front of
  the print edition. Texas representative Greg Casar, a Democrat, told
  supporters he understands the urge to not be “alarmist” about what is taking
  place across the country. But, he said, he worries the US press is not doing
  enough to make the stakes clear for Americans. “Think about if it was another
  country and the corrupt president of that country wanted to change the
  election laws at the last minute, and he got a political ally to threaten to
  arrest using federal law enforcement, the entire opposition party who’s
  getting in the way, and even threatened to use the judicial system to expel
  the entire other political party from office. You would say democracy is on
  its last legs in that other country,” Casar, chair of the Progressive caucus,
  said on an organizing call Thursday night. “But that’s not some other country.
  That’s the United States. That’s what we’re facing right now in Texas.” “This
  is what authoritarianism starts to look like,” he added. “They’re wannabe
  dictators, and we’ve got to keep them wannabes and not let them further
  consolidate their power.” Texas representative Lloyd Doggett opposes partisan
  gerrymandering on principle. But on Thursday, he was urging Californians to
  “raise” an effort by their governor to “fight fire with fire” and counter
  Republicans’ attempt to redraw Texas’s congressional map to gain five seats.
  Putting his own spin on the adage “two wrongs don’t make a right”, Doggett
  said: “Two wrongs can save our country.” “If we play by these separate rules,
  Trump will rule,” he warned on the call with other state and federal
  lawmakers. Not every quorum break is successful, said Doggett, who in 1979 was
  part of a group of Democrats dubbed the “killer bees” who hid out in a garage
  for days to block legislation changing the Texas presidential primary date.
  Republicans dropped the bill and the walkout was successful. “It’s much more
  difficult to win these days with the FBI, the federal law enforcement and the
  state doing so much to intimidate a much larger group of House Democrats,” he
  said, before appealing to people in California and other blue states to
  support partisan redistricting efforts that would offset Texas’s actions.
  “Raise this California effort,” he said. “It is our best hope to checkmate
  Donald Trump for what’s going wrong in Texas, and if you’re in any state where
  there’s a possibility of an attack by Republicans – Missouri, Indiana,
  Florida, of course, and several others – we need to activate every progressive
  voice to oppose the Texas plague from Donald Trump spreading across the
  country.” Scientists decry Trump energy chief’s plan to ‘update’ climate
  reports: ‘exactly what Stalin did’ The US energy secretary, Chris Wright, is
  facing growing criticism from scientists who say their “worst fears” were
  realized when Wright revealed that the Trump administration would “update” the
  US’s premier climate crisis reports. Wright, a former oil and gas executive,
  told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins earlier this week that the administration was
  reviewing national climate assessment reports published by past
  administrations. Since 2000, there have been five national climate assessment
  (NCA) reports, which are produced by scientists and peer-reviewed, and they
  are considered the gold standard report of global heating and its effects on
  human health, agriculture, water supplies and air pollution. “We’re reviewing
  them, and we will come out with updated reports on those and with comments on
  those reports,” said Wright, who is one of the main supporters of the
  administration’s “drill, baby, drill” agenda to boost fossil fuels, which are
  the primary cause of the climate crisis. Wright was speaking days after his
  agency, the Department of Energy, produced a report claiming that concern over
  the climate crisis was overblown. That energy department report was slammed by
  scientists for being a “farce” full of misinformation. Read the full story by
  Mark Oliver here: The Environmental Protection Agency will end a $7bn
  Biden-era grant program that sought to expand solar energy to low-income
  communities, administrator Lee Zeldin said in a post on X on Thursday. “EPA no
  longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds
  to keep this boondoggle alive,” Zeldin said in a video post. The One Big
  Beautiful Bill Act signed into law by Donald Trump last month eliminated the
  program’s source of funding, Zeldin added. Cancellation of the Solar for All
  program had been widely expected. Since taking office in January, Trump has
  rolled back federal support for solar and wind energy, calling the renewable
  resources expensive and unreliable. The Trump administration offered a $50m
  reward on Thursday for information leading to the arrest of Venezuelan
  dictator Nicolás Maduro. “Maduro uses foreign terrorist organizations like TDA
  (Tren de Aragua), Sinaloa and Cartel of the Suns to bring deadly drugs and
  violence into our country,” attorney general Pam Bondi said in a video posted
  on X. In 2020, during Trump’s first term, the government offered up to $15m
  for information on Maduro, and then raised that reward to up to $25m in
  January. Donald Trump on Thursday said he will host the leaders of Azerbaijan
  and Armenia for an “an official peace-signing ceremony” at the White House on
  Friday. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said the US will also be signing
  bilateral economic agreements with the two countries. The countries, both of
  which won independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, have been at loggerheads
  since the late 1980s when Nagorno-Karabakh, an Azerbaijani region that had a
  mostly ethnic-Armenian population, broke away from Azerbaijan with support
  from Armenia. Katie Miller, a top aide to Elon Musk who is married to the
  White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, is launching a podcast for
  conservative mothers. “For years I’ve seen that there isn’t a place for
  conservative women to gather online,” she said in the announcement. “I wanted
  to create that space, where we have real, honest conversations with people
  across the political spectrum and across the world.” Miller was aan aide for
  Musk’s unofficial “department of government efficiency” and had served in
  Donald Trump’s first administration, Mike Pence’s communications director. She
  said in her announcement she was “concluding” her time working full-time for
  Musk. Democratic representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland is urging FBI agents
  to resist taking part in efforts to track down a group of Texas Democrats who
  left the state to stop a Republican effort to redistrict, the Huffington Post
  reports. Raskin, the top Democrat on the House judiciary committee, which
  conducts oversight of the FBI, said the agency has no authority to locate and
  investigate the state legislators as Republican senator John Cornyn claimed
  earlier on Thursday. “The FBI is not a national secret police force operating
  at the beck and call of President Trump,” Raskin told HuffPost. “It has no
  legal authority to track down state legislators who are breaking no federal
  laws just for standing up to a Republican scheme to purge Democrats from
  Congress and rig our elections.” “FBI personnel should refuse to participate
  in this act of political harassment and persecution,” Raskin added. Earlier
  today, Cornyn said the FBI had agreed to assist in returning Texas Democratic
  lawmakers who left the state to block Republicans’ effort to add five more GOP
  seats to the state legislature through a gerrymandered congressional map. That
  claim could not be independently confirmed. The Texas lawmakers who left the
  state are currently staying at a hotel in suburban Chicago. The US air force
  said it would deny all transgender service members who have served from 15 to
  18 years the option to retire early and would instead separate them without
  retirement benefits, the AP reports. One air force sergeant said he felt
  “betrayed and devastated” by the move. The move means that transgender service
  members will now be faced with the choice of either taking a lump-sum
  separation payment offered to junior troops or be removed from the service. An
  air force spokesperson told the AP that “although service members with 15 to
  18 years of honorable service were permitted to apply for an exception to
  policy, none of the exceptions to policy were approved”. About a dozen service
  members had been “prematurely notified” that they would be able to retire
  before that decision was reversed, according to the spokesperson who spoke on
  condition of anonymity to discuss internal air force policy. A memo issued
  Monday announcing the new policy said that the choice to deny retirement
  benefits was made “after careful consideration of the individual
  applications”. Earlier, we reported that two senior FBI officials involved in
  a number of FBI investigations related to the president had been fired. Now,
  senior politics reporter Chris Stein brings us more details: The Trump
  administration is forcing out a senior FBI official who resisted demands made
  earlier this year for the names of agents who investigated the January 6
  insurrection, two people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. Brian
  Driscoll briefly served as acting FBI director in the first weeks of Donald
  Trump’s new term, and his final day at the bureau is Friday, the people told
  the Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to
  discuss the move. Further ousters were possible. The FBI declined to comment
  to the Guardian. The New York Times further reported that the FBI was forcing
  out Walter Giardina, a special agent who worked on cases involving Trump as
  well as Peter Navarro, a top trade adviser to the president who was convicted
  of contempt of Congress. The ousters were the latest under the FBI director,
  Kash Patel, and his deputy, Dan Bongino, who had repeatedly alleged that the
  bureau had become politicized under Joe Biden. Numerous senior officials,
  including top agents in charge of big-city field offices, have been pushed out
  of their jobs, and some agents have been subjected to polygraph exams, moves
  that former officials say have roiled the workforce and contributed to angst.
  Here’s the full story: Donald Trump’s administration turned to the US supreme
  court in an effort to defend its aggressive immigration raids after a federal
  judge in Los Angeles blocked agents from profiling individuals based on race
  or language in pursuit of deportation targets. The justice department asked
  the supreme court in an emergency filing to lift the judge’s order temporarily
  barring agents from stopping or detaining people without “reasonable
  suspicion” that they are in the country illegally, by relying solely on their
  race or ethnicity, or if they speak Spanish or English with an accent. The
  move comes after a federal judge last month ordered the Trump administration
  to halt indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in seven California
  counties, including Los Angeles. Donald Trump said Thursday that he would meet
  with Vladimir Putin even if the Russian president won’t meet with Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy. Trump, when asked by a reporter whether Putin would need to meet
  with the Ukrainian president to secure a meeting with the US, said: “No, he
  doesn’t. No.” His comments followed Putin’s remarks earlier in the day that he
  hoped to meet with Trump next week, possibly in the United Arab Emirates. But
  the White House was still working through the details of any potential
  meetings, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. Donald Trump announced he
  will nominate the Council of Economic Advisers chair Stephen Miran to serve as
  a Federal Reserve governor. Miran would fill the position opened by Fed
  governor Adriana Kugler’s surprise resignation last week, as she returns to
  her tenured professorship at Georgetown University. The term expires on 31
  January 2026 and is subject to approval by the Senate. Trump said the White
  House continues to search for someone to serve in the 14-year Fed Board seat
  that opens 1 February. Miran has advocated for a far-reaching overhaul of Fed
  governance that would include shortening board member terms, putting them
  under the clear control of the president and ending the “revolving door”
  between the executive branch and the Fed. Trump has unsuccessfully pushed the
  Fed to cut rates. Miran, if confirmed by the Senate, would have one of 12
  votes on monetary policy at the Fed, which voted 9-2 last month to keep rates
  steady. Donald Trump and Stephen Moore, a fellow at the rightwing thinktank
  the Heritage Foundation, held an event at the White House on Thursday to show
  reporters “new numbers” that allege the Bureau of Labor Statistics overstated
  job creation during the first two years of the Biden administration. “I don’t
  think it’s an error,” Trump said during today’s event. “I think they did it
  purposely.” Moore said the data comes from “unpublished Census Bureau data”,
  and will supposedly be released sometime in the next six months. Moore is
  Trump’s former economic advisor and co-wrote the book Trumponomics: Inside the
  America First Plan to Revive Our Economy”, which praised the president’s
  economic plans. In 2019, Trump nominated Moore for a seat on the Federal
  Reserve board, but he withdrew amid scrutiny for his history of sexist
  comments and other scandals. Colleges and universities will be forced to
  disclose more student admissions data to prove that they are not implementing
  affirmative action policies, according to a directive sent by the White House
  on Thursday. The move comes as the Trump administration seeks to crack down on
  the use of race in the higher education application process. Ivy League
  universities, like Brown University, have reached settlements that require
  them to release information about applicants’ race. Colleges have been barred
  from considering race in admissions since 2023, when the supreme court
  overturned decades of precedent that allowed limited use of race as a factor.
  Trump’s directive would increase oversight of schools’ admissions processes.
  “Although the Supreme Court of the United States has definitively held that
  consideration of race in higher education admissions violates students’ civil
  rights,” the directive reads, “the persistent lack of available data – paired
  with the rampant use of ‘diversity statements’ and other overt and hidden
  racial proxies – continues to raise concerns about whether race is actually
  used in practice.” The directive was confirmed earlier today by White House
  press secretary Karoline Leavitt. The president’s higher tariffs hit major US
  trading partners today. Trump and members of his cabinet declared it an
  economic victory, with commerce secretary Howard Lutnick estimating that the
  tariffs will lead to “$50bn a month” in revenue for the USand treasury
  secretary Scott Bessent saying a “manufacturing renaissance” was on the
  horizon in an interview with MSNBC. Countries feeling the hit, however, are
  now scrambling to respond. Republican senator John Cornyn of Texas said today
  that the FBI had approved his request for the agency to help locate and arrest
  Democratic state lawmakers, who left the state last week to break quorum in
  protest over a GOP-drawn congressional map. “We cannot allow these rogue
  legislators to avoid their constitutional responsibilities,” Cornyn said in a
  statement. In response, undeterred Democrats have fired back. “The Trump
  administration continues to weaponize law enforcement to target political
  adversaries,” House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries wrote on X. “We will not
  be intimidated.” Meanwhile, on Truth Social, Donald Trump announced today that
  he’s ordered the commerce department to conduct a new census that would
  exclude undocumented immigrants from the official count. “People who are in
  our country illegally will not be counted,” the president said. It’s important
  to note that the US census has historically counted all residents regardless
  of citizenship or immigration status, as required by the 14th amendment’s
  “whole number of persons” provision. And in Florida, the administration’s
  immigration agenda hit a snag as a federal judge in Miami ordered a temporary
  halt to the construction of the detention centre being built in the
  Everglades, known as “Alligator Alcatraz”. While the injunction says the
  facility can continue to operate and hold detainees, any further construction
  must stop while environmental threats to the wetlands are assessed. More than
  60 countries around the world are scrambling to respond to the latest wave of
  US tariffs announced by Donald Trump, which came into force on Thursday. The
  Brazilian government said it was planning a state aid plan for companies
  affected. The president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said the duties were
  “unacceptable blackmail”. Switzerland said it was seeking new talks with the
  US after a last-gasp mission to Washington by its president, Karin
  Keller-Sutter, failed to stop a 39% tariff blow that industry group Swissmem
  described as a “horror scenario”. In a statement after an emergency meeting
  with Keller-Sutter, the Swiss cabinet said the tariffs would “place a
  substantial strain on Switzerland’s export-oriented economy”. “For the
  affected sectors, companies and their employees, this is an extraordinarily
  difficult situation,” Keller-Sutter told reporters. Despite a last-minute
  reprieve from Trump for Lesotho with tariffs dropping from 50% to 15%, the
  impoverished African nation said it was already hurting. Textile industry
  players in the country – which produces jeans and other garments for US
  companies including Levi and Walmart – said the uncertainty around tariffs
  over the past few months had already devastated the sector, with orders
  cancelled and jobs cut. Read more here: A federal judge in Miami has ordered a
  temporary halt to the construction of the detention centre being built in the
  Florida everglades known as ‘Alligator Alcatraz’. The temporary injunction,
  which lasts for 14 days, states that the facility can continue to operate and
  hold detainees, but any further construction must stop while any environmental
  threats to the wetlands are assessed. The plaintiffs – which comprise
  environmental groups and Florida’s Miccosukee Tribe – argue that the detention
  center’s construction ultimately violates the National Environmental Policy
  Act. The federal judiciary said on Thursday that it would be taking
  “additional steps” to strengthen protections for sensitive case documents
  after “recent escalated cyber-attacks” on its case management system. Politico
  first reported the news of a hack that hit the federal courts’ filing system.
  “Enhancing the security of its systems is a top priority for the Judiciary,”
  the Federal Courts system wrote in a statement. They didn’t offer any
  immediate information about who was behind the cyber-attacks. My colleagues
  are reporting on the latest developments following Benjamin Netanyahu’s
  remarks that he intends to take military control of all of Gaza, before
  eventually handing it over to Arab forces that will govern it properly. The
  Israeli prime minister’s statement comes after special envoy Steve Witkoff
  visited the region last week to assess the ongoing humanitarian crisis,
  increase the flow of US aid to Gaza. You can follow along here: Democrats have
  responded to the news earlier that the FBI has agreed to assist local law
  enforcement to track down Democratic lawmakers who left the state to break
  quorum in protest of the state’s GOP-drawn congressional map. It comes after
  Republican Senator John Cornyn’s statement earlier, praising FBI director Kash
  Patel for his support. Hakeem Jeffries lambasted the move in a post on X. “The
  Trump administration continues to weaponize law enforcement to target
  political adversaries,” the House minority leader wrote. “We will not be
  intimidated.” Meanwhile, Illinois governor JB Pritzker underscored on a
  podcast on Wednesday that Texas lawmakers hadn’t broken any laws. He also said
  that any arrests by FBI agents would be “unwelcome” in his state. “They’re
  grandstanding, there’s literally no federal law applicable to this situation,”
  he added. We’re getting word that Donald Trump will announce a peace deal
  between Azerbaijan and Armenia on Friday 8 August, according to reports from
  both Reuters and CBS News. The respective leaders of both Azerbaijan and
  Armenia, Ilham Aliyev and Nikol Pashinyan, will attend events at the White
  House tomorrow, despite decades-long tension between the two countries. Part
  of the peace deal would include rights for the US to develop a strategic
  transit corridor through the South Caucasus, officials told Reuters.
  Tomorrow’s meeting comes as the president sets to position himself as a
  perpetual peacemaker, and will happen on the same day as Trump’s deadline for
  Russia to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine, or face fresh sanctions. The White
  House says that the vice-president, JD Vance, will meet with the UK foreign
  secretary, David Lammy, tomorrow, 8 August. Vance and his family are currently
  on vacation in the Cotswolds. The vice-president plans to meet Lammy at his
  countryside residence, Chevening House, in Kent. The suspect in the
  assassination of Minnesota’s house speaker and her husband, and the attempted
  murder of a state senator and his wife, pleaded not guilty to numerous charges
  in federal court on Thursday, Reuters reports. Vance Luther Boelter, 58, of
  Green Isle, Minnesota, led police on a two-day manhunt after the 14 June
  shootings in New Hope, Minnesota. He appeared before US magistrate judge Dulce
  Foster on Thursday and waived the reading of his six-count indictment, the
  Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. He entered a plea of not guilty in the
  murders of speaker emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, and the shooting
  of state senator John Hoffman and his wife. Boelter’s attorney, Manny Atwal,
  could not immediately be reached for comment. There was no immediate statement
  from acting US attorney for Minnesota, Joseph Thompson. Thompson in a previous
  statement said Boelter planned and carried out the targeted political
  assassinations “the likes of which have never been seen in Minnesota”. During
  the attacks at the homes of the two lawmakers, Boelter is accused of
  disguising himself as a police officer and wearing a silicone mask while
  driving an SUV with a license plate that simply read: “Police.” Two of the
  federal charges carry the possibility of the death penalty. Prosecutors have
  not made a decision whether to pursue a capital sentence, which would require
  the approval of US attorney general Pam Bondi. Boelter also faces state
  charges including two counts of second-degree intentional murder and two
  counts of second-degree attempted intentional murder. Boelter’s state case has
  been paused as his federal proceedings continue. Donald Trump announced today
  that he’s ordered the commerce department to conduct a new census that would
  exclude undocumented immigrants from the official count. In a post on Truth
  Social, Trump said the census would be “based on modern day facts and figures”
  and use “results and information gained from the Presidential Election of
  2024”. He added that “people who are in our country illegally will not be
  counted”. The US census has historically counted all residents regardless of
  citizenship or immigration status, as required by the 14th amendment’s “whole
  number of persons” provision. Trump’s directive contradicts this
  constitutional requirement despite there being no evidence of problems with
  the 2020 census. The move would fulfil a longstanding rightwing talking point
  that undocumented immigrants should not influence congressional representation
  or electoral votes. Far-right figures have long claimed that states like
  California gain unfair political advantage by counting non-citizens. The
  political activist Charlie Kirk, for example, argued in 2020 that “California
  gets an extra 9 electoral votes because of counting illegals.” Census data
  determines congressional representation, electoral college apportionment and
  the distribution of federal funding for schools, hospitals and other essential
  services. States with large non-citizen populations – particularly California,
  Texas, Florida and New York – could see their political influence and federal
  resources sharply reduced under Trump’s proposed changes. Legal and
  immigration advocates have also long stressed that restricting the census to
  citizens could depress participation among legal immigrants, who are
  alreadyundercounted because they may be more reluctant to engage with
  government authorities. Umaymah Mohammad, perhaps the only student in the US
  to be suspended from medical school for remarks about Israel and Gaza, has
  filed a federal lawsuit against Atlanta’s Emory University, alleging
  discrimination under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, as well as additional
  complaints under state law. The lawsuit, filed on Monday morning in federal
  district court on Mohammad’s behalf by the Council on Islamic-American
  Relations in Georgia (Cair-Ga), centers on Emory’s alleged “intentional
  discrimination and retaliation” during disciplinary proceedings against the
  medical-sociology dual degree student last year. It names the university, its
  board of trustees and John William Eley, a dean at the medical school, as
  defendants. It has been filed in pursuit of “accountability and justice …
  [and] has potential repercussions for how student activists have been treated
  over the last two years in this country”, said Azka Mahmood, executive
  director of Cair-Ga. If successful, the lawsuit could lead to “stopping
  disciplinary proceedings for protected expression – and that this becomes more
  of a policy moving forward” – both at Emory and elsewhere, said Keon Grant,
  one of the Cair-Ga attorneys who filed the complaint. The school declined to
  provide comment to the Guardian on pending litigation. The FBI has fired two
  senior officials, according to a report from The New York Times. Brian
  Driscoll, who served as interim director before Kash Patel was confirmed, and
  Walter Giardiana, who was involved in a number of FBI investigations related
  to the president, have both been forced out per The Times’ sources. Driscoll’s
  removal was not immediately clear, according to The Times. But the Times also
  reports that neither Driscoll nor Giardina is eligible to retire, and
  Giardina’s wife died last month of cancer. The president is expected to sign a
  memorandum today, ordering universities to hand over their admissions data to
  the federal government, in order to prove they aren’t engaging in affirmative
  action and secure funding, according to a report by The Daily Caller.
  According to fact sheet obtained by The Daily Caller, the order will also
  direct the secretary of education Linda McMahon to expand the type of data
  that universities need to submit to the administration in order “to fully
  asses their practices”. In 2023, the US supreme court effectively ended
  affirmative action, when it ruled against the use of race in college
  admissions at universities and colleges across the country. Indiana state
  representative Matt Pierce, a Democrat, said in an interview with CNN today
  that Democrats in the state will “use every procedural manoeuvre available” to
  push back against redistricting efforts. “We have to have a national fight
  about this, and we have to preserve democracy. We shouldn’t be rigging the
  election for one way or the other,” Pierce added. This comes as vice-president
  JD Vance meets with Indiana governor Mike Braun and state Republicans to apply
  pressure on them to redraw the states congressional map – as a redistricting
  battle plays out across the country. In order to redraw Indiana’s map, Braun
  would need to call a special session of the state legislature. My colleague,
  Sam Levine, notes that the GOP already has control over seven of Indiana’s
  nine congressional seats, but Republicans also have complete control of state
  government, which would allow them to redraw the map to pick up more seats.
  Across the US’s fabled but overstretched national parks, unusual scenes are
  playing out this summer – following budget cuts by Donald Trump’s
  administration. Archeologists are staffing ticket booths, ecologists are
  covering visitor centers and the superintendents of parks are even cleaning
  the toilets. The National Park Service (NPS), responsible for maintaining
  cherished wildernesses and sites of cultural importance from Yellowstone to
  the Statue of Liberty, has lost a quarter of its permanent staff since Trump
  took office in January, with the administration seeking to gut the service’s
  budget by a third. But the administration has also ordered parks to remain
  open and accessible to the public, meaning the NPS has had to scramble
  remaining staff into public-facing roles to maintain appearances to the crowds
  of visitors. This has meant much of the behind-the-scenes work to protect
  endangered species, battle invasive plants, fix crumbling infrastructure or
  plan for the future needs of the US’s trove of natural wonders has been
  jettisoned. Read more here: Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas said today
  that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has approved his request for
  the agency to help locate and arrest Democratic state lawmakers, who left the
  state last week to break quorum in protest over a GOP-drawn congressional map.
  “I thank President Trump and Director Patel for supporting and swiftly acting
  on my call for the federal government to hold these supposed lawmakers
  accountable for fleeing Texas. We cannot allow these rogue legislators to
  avoid their constitutional responsibilities,” Cornyn said in a statement. The
  FBI declined the Guardian’s request for comment. Cornyn wrote a letter to FBI
  director Kash Patel earlier this week, imploring him to help round up and
  arrest the state legislators – many of whom are waiting out the remainder of
  Texas’ special session in blue states. Also making the cable news rounds today
  is commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, who said the US can expect “to be
  heading towards $50bn a month in tariff revenue,” in an interview with Fox
  Business Network. “And then you’re going to get the semiconductors, you’re
  going to get pharmaceuticals, you’re going to get all sorts of additional
  tariff money coming in,” he added. “Everybody understands you’ve got to see to
  the American consumer. The American consumer is the most powerful factor in
  the Earth for the economy.” When asked about how much money the US can expect
  to bring in from Donald Trump’s tariffs each year, treasury secretary Scott
  Bessent said that $300bn was “a good start”. He compared this to the $77bn
  brought in from tariff revenue in 2024. “This year, we could have about 300
  billion of new revenue, which is 1% of GDP. And then there’s a chance that
  that could be higher in ‘26,” Bessent said in an interview with MSNBC. As
  Donald Trump’s tariffs on swathes of major US trading partners take effect
  today, his treasury secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview with MSNBC
  earlier that things have “just gotten out of balance” and “we’ve stopped
  making things in the US,” when quizzed about tariffs issued against key allies
  like South Korea, Japan, Australia, and the EU. Bessent added that he’s
  confident that tariffs will reinvigorate American manufacturing, citing the
  corporate commitments from the likes of Apple. “We want to get rid of these
  big deficits that we have with countries that have created these big surpluses
  and gutted our manufacturing base,” he said. “We’ve got trillions and
  trillions of manufacturing that’s going to come back, and we’re going to see
  that over the next couple of years.” Bessent went on to describe this period
  as a “manufacturing renaissance”. A White House official tells the Guardian
  that the president will sign two finance-related executive orders today. The
  first will be an action that allows 401k holders to “to access alternative
  assets” such as private equity, according to details shared with the Guardian.
  The second order will focus on Trump’s claims of banks discriminating against
  conservatives. This would punish banks for the process of “debanking” – which
  involves limiting financial services based on religious or political beliefs.
  We’ve gotten more details about the shooting on an army base in Georgia on
  Wednesday. A reminder that an active-duty soldier opened fire at Fort Stewart
  military base yesterday, wounding five other soldiers before being taken into
  custody. Officials said the alleged shooter was 28-year-old Sgt Quornelius
  Radford, who was assigned to Fort Stewart. Brig Gen John Lubas, commander of
  the third infantry division and Fort Stewart-Hunter army airfield, said
  soldiers in the area who witnessed the shooting “immediately and without
  hesitation tackled the soldier, subdued him. That allowed law enforcement to
  then take him into custody.” The base said in a Facebook post that the
  shooting occurred in the 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team area. “All soldiers
  were treated on-site and moved to Winn Army Community Hospital for further
  treatment,” the base said. Lubas confirmed the shooter did not use a military
  weapon. “We believe it was a personal handgun,” he said. According to
  reporting from The New York Times, Radford sent a text message to his aunt on
  Wednesday morning which said that he “loved everybody, and that he’ll be in a
  better place because he was about to go and do something”. The Times also
  spoke with Radford’s father, who said he hasn’t noticed anything unusual about
  his son’s behavior recently, and didn’t know what might have led him to attack
  his fellow soldiers. Donald Trump is at the White House today. His day is
  looking quiet until noon EDT, when he’ll sign executive orders. Then at 4pm
  EDT he’s deliver remarks in the East Room. We’ll be watching and bringing you
  the latest. President Donald Trump on Thursday called for the Intel new CEO
  Lip-Bu Tan to immediately resign, saying he is “highly conflicted” after
  questions arose about his ties to Chinese firms. “There is no other solution
  to this problem,” he said in a Truth Social post. It comes as Republican
  senator Tom Cotton sent a letter to Intel’s board chair on Wednesday with
  questions about Tan’s ties to Chinese firms and a recent criminal case
  involving his former company Cadence Design. Writing to “express concern about
  the security and integrity of Intel’s operations and its potential impact on
  US national security”, Cotton asked in the letter to Intel chairperson Frank
  Yeary whether the company’s board was aware of the subpoenas sent to Cadence
  during Tan’s time there as CEO before Intel hired him. Cotton asked what
  measures were taken to address those concerns. US border patrol agents carried
  out a raid outside a Home Depot in Los Angeles on Wednesday, with officers
  jumping out of an unmarked rental truck and chasing and arresting more than a
  dozen people. Videos of the operation, and federal officials’ statements
  boasting about the detentions, have raised questions about whether the US
  government was complying with a federal court order halting indiscriminate
  raids in the region due to evidence of racial profiling. That ruling, upheld
  last week by an appeals court, followed reports of Latino US citizens getting
  swept up in LA raids and accounts of undocumented people being targeted based
  on their appearance and whether they spoke Spanish. Clips of the early morning
  raid by Home Depot in the Westlake neighborhood, near MacArthur Park, showed
  masked, heavily armed officers jumping out of a yellow truck from Penske, a
  private rental company, and people fleeing. Day laborers often gather outside
  Home Depot stores looking for work and have been subject to aggressive
  immigration raids in southern California. One day-laborer present for the
  Wednesday raid told the Los Angeles Times that the Penske truck pulled up to
  the parking lot around 6.45am, with the driver telling people gathered in
  Spanish that he had work to offer. Someone then rolled up the back of the
  truck, and masked agents, including one in a cowboy hat, jumped out as people
  scattered, the witness said. Donald Trump said he would impose a 100% tariff
  on foreign computer chips, likely raising the cost of electronics, autos,
  household appliances and other goods deemed essential for the digital age.
  “We’ll be putting a tariff on of approximately 100% on chips and
  semiconductors,” Trump said in the Oval Office while meeting with Apple CEO
  Tim Cook. “But if you’re building in the United States of America, there’s no
  charge.” The Republican president said companies that make computer chips in
  the US would be spared the import tax. During the Covid-19 pandemic, a
  shortage of computer chips increased the price of autos and contributed to an
  overall uptick in inflation. Trump and Cook were meeting on Wednesday to
  discuss an agreement for Apple to invest $100bn in manufacturing in the US
  over the next four years. That comes after the iPhone maker already pledged to
  invest $500bn domestically earlier this year. With Apple’s new investment, the
  total figure is now at $600bn. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he
  has instructed the Department of Commerce to begin creating a new Census
  “based on modern day facts and figures” and that uses the results and
  information from the 2024 presidential election. “People who are in our
  Country illegally will not be counted in the census,” he said in a Truth
  Social post. He added: I have instructed our Department of Commerce to
  immediately begin work on a new and highly accurate CENSUS based on modern day
  facts and figures and, importantly, using the results and information gained
  from the Presidential Election of 2024. Donald Trump on Wednesday celebrated a
  commitment by Apple to increase its investments in US manufacturing by an
  additional $100bn over the next four years. Apple’s plan to up its domestic
  investment comes as it seeks to avoid Trump’s threatened tariffs, which would
  increase the tech giant’s costs as it relies on a complex international supply
  chain to produce its iPhones. Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, warned during an earnings
  call in May that the tariffs could cost the company up to $900m that fiscal
  quarter alone. After Cook gifted Trump a US-made souvenir with a 24-karat gold
  base at the Oval Office on Wednesday, the president praised the corporation,
  telling reporters: “Companies like Apple, they’re coming home … This is a
  significant step toward the ultimate goal of ensuring that iPhones sold in
  America also are made in America.” Cook said many components of the iPhones
  are already made domestically, including glass, semiconductors and face ID,
  but that final assembly of the devices would remain overseas “for a while”. In
  an earlier statement, Cook had said the new investments involve work with 10
  companies across the US that produce components used in Apple products. Apple
  had previously said it intended to invest $500bn domestically, a figure it
  will now increase to $600bn. Apple also claimed that it would directly hire
  20,000 US workers over the next four years. JD Vance’s team had the army corps
  of engineers take the unusual step of changing the outflow of a lake in Ohio
  to accommodate a recent boating excursion on a family holiday, the Guardian
  has learned. The request from the US Secret Service was made to “support safe
  navigation” of the US vice-president’s security detail for an August outing on
  the Little Miami River, according to a statement by the US army corps of
  engineers (USACE). Vance was spotted in the south-western Ohio area on 2
  August, his 41st birthday, according to social media posts that noted he was
  seen canoeing on the river, a tributary that Caesar Creek Lake feeds into. One
  source with knowledge of the matter who communicated with the Guardian
  anonymously alleged that the outflow request for the Caesar Creek Lake was not
  just to support the vice-president’s Secret Service detail, but also to create
  “ideal kayaking conditions”. The Guardian could not independently confirm this
  specific claim. The news raises questions about whether Vance’s office was
  potentially exploiting public infrastructure resources for his personal
  recreation at a time when the Trump administration has cut billions of dollars
  in foreign aid, scientific research and government jobs as part of its
  “efficiency” drive. The vice-president’s office did not respond to a request
  for comment. Leading Democrats are sounding the alarm over Donald Trump’s
  reported plan to divert funds from the US nuclear arsenal to convert a luxury
  jet gifted by Qatar into a new Air Force One. The US president provoked an
  outcry in May when it emerged that he would accept a $400m Boeing 747-8 jet as
  a free gift from the Qatari royal family. Stripping down and securing the
  plane so it can transport Trump for a few years will cost taxpayers an
  estimated $1bn. Now Democrats are seizing on media reports that the retrofit
  will be part funded by money redirected from Sentinel, a nuclear missile
  modernisation programme already running years behind schedule and said to be
  81% over budget. In a letter obtained by the Guardian, senators Elizabeth
  Warren, Tammy Duckworth, Ed Markey and Adam Schiff, along with representatives
  John Garamendi and Jamie Raskin, demand answers from Troy Meink, the secretary
  of the air force. The letter reminds Meink that, in testimony to the Senate
  armed services committee, he acknowledged the Qatari plane needs “significant
  modifications” to meet Air Force One standards. These are likely to include
  defences against threats ranging from surface-to-air missiles to a nuclear
  blast, secure and reliable communications systems and protections against
  counterintelligence. The Democrats write: “In June, you told Congress that the
  cost of retrofitting the Qatari Boeing 747-8 ‘wouldn’t be anywhere near’ the
  reported $1 billion estimate. Do you still believe this to be the case?”
  Switzerland’s government will hold an emergency meeting on Thursday to decide
  its next move after its president returned home empty-handed from an 11th-hour
  trip to Washington aimed at averting a crippling 39% US import tariff on Swiss
  goods. An urgent meeting of the seven-member Federal Council - Switzerland’s
  governing cabinet - will take place in Bern in the early afternoon, the
  government said a post on X. Swiss president Karin Keller-Sutter left
  Washington on Wednesday without a new deal and did not meet with US president
  Donald Trump or any of his top trade officials, two sources told Reuters. Her
  proposal for a 10% tariff rate was rejected by US officials, one of the
  sources added. Negotiations between Switzerland and the United States over
  tariffs will continue, but more time is needed to strike a deal, according to
  a Swiss source familiar with the discussions. President Donald Trump on
  Wednesday said he may use the National Guard to police the streets of
  Washington, DC, and a White House official said federal law enforcement would
  increase its presence in the city this week. The threat - and the move to
  follow through on it - is the latest step by Trump and his administration
  toward taking over running the city that serves as the seat of the US
  government. “We have a capital that’s very unsafe,” Trump told reporters at
  the White House. “We have to run DC This has to be the best-run place in the
  country.” A White House official told Reuters that operational details about
  the increased federal presence were still being finalized. South African
  president Cyril Ramaphosa held a telephone call with US president Donald Trump
  on bilateral trade and the two countries’ trade negotiating teams will have
  more detailed talks, Ramaphosa’s office said on Thursday. South Africa tried
  for months but failed to negotiate a trade deal with Washington ahead of
  Trump’s deadline. US imports from South Africa now face a 30% duty. “The two
  leaders undertook to continue with further engagements, recognising the
  various trade negotiations the US is currently involved in,” Ramaphosa’s
  office said in a statement. “Respective trade negotiating teams will take
  forward more detailed discussions.” A meeting between Russian President
  Vladimir Putin and United States president Donald Trump is likely to take
  place next week, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti quoted Kremlin aide
  Yuri Ushakov as saying on Thursday. More on this development as we get it. The
  US Customs and Border Protection agency began collecting the higher tariffs of
  10% to 50% at 12.01am EDT after weeks of suspense over Trump’s final tariff
  rates and frantic negotiations with major trading partners that sought to
  lower them. The leaders of Brazil and India vowed not to be cowed by Trump’s
  hardline bargaining position, even while their negotiators sought a reprieve
  from the highest tariff levels. The new rates will test Trump’s strategy for
  shrinking US trade deficits without causing massive disruptions to global
  supply chains or provoking higher inflation and stiff retaliation from trading
  partners, Reuters reported. After unveiling his ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs in
  April, Trump has frequently modified his plan, slapping much higher rates on
  imports from some countries, including 50% for goods from Brazil, 39% from
  Switzerland, 35% from Canada and 25% from India. He announced on Wednesday a
  separate, 25% tariff on Indian goods, to be imposed in 21 days, over India’s
  purchases of Russian oil. “RECIPROCAL TARIFFS TAKE EFFECT AT MIDNIGHT
  TONIGHT!,” Trump said on Truth Social just ahead of the deadline. “BILLIONS OF
  DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES
  FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA. THE
  ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP AMERICA’S GREATNESS WOULD BE A RADICAL LEFT COURT
  THAT WANTS TO SEE OUR COUNTRY FAIL!” Across the US’s fabled but overstretched
  national parks, unusual scenes are playing out this summer following budget
  cuts by Donald Trump’s administration. Archeologists are staffing ticket
  booths, ecologists are covering visitor centers and the superintendents of
  parks are even cleaning the toilets. The National Park Service (NPS),
  responsible for maintaining cherished wildernesses and sites of cultural
  importance from Yellowstone to the Statue of Liberty, has lost a quarter of
  its permanent staff since Trump took office in January, with the
  administration seeking to gut the service’s budget by a third. But the
  administration has also ordered parks to remain open and accessible to the
  public, meaning the NPS has had to scramble remaining staff into public-facing
  roles to maintain appearances to the crowds of visitors. This has meant much
  of the behind-the-scenes work to protect endangered species, battle invasive
  plants, fix crumbling infrastructure or plan for the future needs of the US’s
  trove of natural wonders has been jettisoned. “It’s nearly impossible to do
  the leadership role expected of me,” said one superintendent who heads a park
  in the western US who didn’t want to be named for fear of retribution from the
  administration. “I’m doing everything now. That means I regularly have to make
  sure the doors are open, I have to run the visitor center, I have to clean the
  bathrooms. I’d say I’m cleaning the bathroom on a weekly basis now because
  there’s no one else to do it.” This sort of triage situation is occurring
  across the 433 sites and 85m acres – including 63 national parks and an array
  of battlefields, monuments and cultural sites – that make up the national park
  system in the US, multiple current and former NPS staff have told the
  Guardian, risking long-term degradation of prized parks. Good morning and
  welcome to our live coverage of US politics as JD Vance prepares to visit
  Indiana on Thursday to discuss redistricting with Republican leaders. The vice
  president’s trip comes as Donald Trump ramps up pressure on GOP states to
  redraw congressional boundaries and give the party more winnable seats in the
  2026 midterm elections. In Texas, Democrats who left the state in an effort to
  block a new congressional map from being implemented say they experienced a
  bomb threat at their Illinois hotel on Wednesday morning amid the standoff.
  Vance is scheduled to hold private meetings with Gov. Mike Braun and others
  before attending a GOP fundraiser on Thursday night in the solidly Republican
  state. Braun had earlier told reporters he expects to discuss several matters
  with the vice president — including redistricting — but said no commitments
  have been made. “It looks like it’s going to happen across many Republican
  states,” Braun said. As Associated Press reports, Indiana is staunchly
  Republican, outnumbering Democrats in Indiana 7-2, limiting the possibilities
  of squeezing out another seat. Opponents of any redistricting attempt are
  planning to make their objections known on Thursday with protests and a news
  conference by the two Democratic members of the state’s congressional
  delegation. The constitutionality of the move would also almost certainly be
  challenged in court. We’ll bring you all the developments throughout the day.
  In other news: Donald Trump has claimed “great progress was made” during talks
  on ending the war in Ukraine between his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, and
  Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin on Wednesday. The three-hour talks came two days
  before a deadline the US president set for Russia to reach a peace deal in the
  war or face fresh sanctions. The White House is placing an additional 25%
  tariff on imports from India, bringing total tariffs up to 50%, in retaliation
  for the country’s purchase of oil from Russia, according to an executive order
  signed on Wednesday morning. India has 21 days to respond to the potential
  tariffs before they go into effect. The tariffs will be tacked on to a 25%
  tariff on India Trump set last week as a “penalty” for the country’s trading
  relationship with Russia. A new report has found hundreds of reported cases of
  human rights abuses in US immigration detention centers. The alleged abuses
  uncovered include deaths in custody, physical and sexual abuse of detainees,
  denial of access to attorneys, and child separation. Trump on Wednesday
  celebrated a commitment by Apple to increase its investments in US
  manufacturing by an additional $100bn over the next four years. Apple’s plan
  to up its domestic investment comes as it seeks to avoid Trump’s threatened
  tariffs, which would increase the tech giant’s costs as it relies on a complex
  international supply chain to produce its iPhones. South Africa’s President
  Cyril Ramaphosa held a telephone call with US president Donald Trump on
  bilateral trade matters, Ramaphosa’s office said in statement. Switzerland’s

  after its president returned home empty-handed from an 11th-hour trip to
  Washington aimed at averting a crippling 39% US import tariff on Swiss goods.

  government said a post on X. Swiss president Karin Keller-Sutter left
  Washington on Wednesday without a new deal and did not meet with Donald Trump
  or any of his top trade officials, two sources told Reuters. The man charged
  with killing the top Democrat in the Minnesota House and her husband, and
  wounding a state senator and his wife, is expected to plead not guilty when
  he’s arraigned in federal court on Thursday, his attorney said. Vance Boelter,
  58, of Green Isle, Minnesota, was indicted 15 July on six counts of murder,
  stalking and firearms violations. The murder charges could carry the federal
  death penalty, though prosecutors say that decision is several months away.

We are wrapping up our live coverage of the second Trump administration for the day, but will be back at it on Friday. In the meantime, here are the latest developments: The Texas attorney general Ken Paxton and state house speaker Dustin Burrows have filed a lawsuit in Illinois to enforce arrest warrants against Democratic lawmakers who left Texas to block Republicans from enacting a gerrymandered congressional map that would likely add five more Republican seats before next year’s midterm elections. The civil petition was filed in an Adams county, Illinois, circuit court, about a four and a half hour drive from Chicago. More than 30 Texas Democratic members are named in the suit. Donald Trump’s administration turned to the US supreme court in an effort to defend its aggressive immigration raids after a federal judge in Los Angeles blocked agents from profiling individuals based on race or language in pursuit of deportation targets. The justice department asked the supreme court in an emergency filing to lift the judge’s order temporarily barring agents from stopping or detaining people without “reasonable suspicion” that they are in the country illegally, by relying solely on their race or ethnicity, or if they speak Spanish or English with an accent. Donald Trump will announce a peace deal between Azerbaijan and Armenia on Friday 8 August, according to reports from both Reuters and CBS News. The respective leaders of both Azerbaijan and Armenia, Ilham Aliyev and Nikol Pashinyan, will attend events at the White House tomorrow, despite decades-long tension between the two countries. Colleges and universities will be forced to disclose more student admissions data to prove that they are not implementing affirmative action policies, according to a directive sent by the White House on Thursday. The move comes as the Trump administration seeks to crack down on the use of race in the higher education application process. Ivy League universities, like Brown University, have reached settlements that require them to release information about applicants’ race. More than 60 countries around the world are scrambling to respond to the latest wave of US tariffs announced by Donald Trump, which came into force on Thursday. Industry representatives in rich and poor countries warned of job losses as the tariffs upended a decades-old world trading system with rates ranging from 10% to 39%, 40% and 41% for Switzerland, Brazil and Syria. All over the globe, leaders were attempting to put contingencies in place after Trump’s tariff threats turned to reality at a minute past midnight Washington time. Donald Trump has said he was ready to meet Vladimir Putin despite the Russian leader’s refusal to meet Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy – dispelling speculation that direct talks between the two warring presidents were a precondition to a high-level US-Russia summit. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump said that Putin did not have to meet with Zelenskyy first before the US and Russian presidents could meet. Donald Trump has called on Intel’s chief executive to resign, alleging Lip-Bu Tan had ties to the Chinese Communist party, sending the stock of the US chipmaker falling. “The CEO of Intel is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,” Trump posted on Truth Social about Tan. “There is no other solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!” Donald Trump announced on Thursday that he has ordered the commerce department to conduct a new census that would exclude undocumented immigrants from the official count. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said the census would be “based on modern day facts and figures” and use “results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024”. He added that “people who are in our country illegally will not be counted”. The US energy secretary, Chris Wright, is facing growing criticism from scientists who say their “worst fears” were realized when Wright revealed that the Trump administration would “update” the US’s premier climate crisis reports. Wright, a former oil and gas executive, told CNN’s Kaitlin Collins earlier this week that the administration was reviewing national climate assessment reports published by past governments. A coalition of conservation groups has welcomed a federal judge’s ruling on Thursday that halts construction work on the immigration jail in the Florida Everglades known as Alligator Alcatraz. US district judge Kathleen Williams ordered workers to stop adding any new paving, infrastructure or ground filling at the remote tented detention camp that the Trump administration intends to use to eventually hold 3,000 immigrants awaiting deportation. Leading Democrats are sounding the alarm over Donald Trump’s reported plan to divert funds from the US nuclear arsenal to convert a luxury jet gifted by Qatar into a new Air Force One. The US president provoked an outcry in May when it emerged that he would accept a $400m Boeing 747-8 jet as a free gift from the Qatari royal family. Stripping down and securing the plane so it can transport Trump for a few years will cost taxpayers an estimated $1bn. The Trump administration plans to increase the federal law enforcement presence in Washington DC as early as Friday morning, CBS News reports. The move follows the alleged assault of a former staffer of the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), Edward Coristine, over the weekend. In a Truth Social post on Wednesday, Trump said that he may place DC under federal control if the city doesn’t “get its act together, and quickly”. Officers will come from the DC national guard, FBI, US marshals, Ice, US Secret Service and other components of the Department of Homeland Security, according to an official who spoke with the news outlet. A White House official told CBS News that the increased federal law enforcement presence on DC streets would begin at midnight Thursday and focus on tourist areas and other known hot spots. Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and several lawmakers on Thursday called for a congressional hearing to “prioritize the individuals who survived the horrific abuse associated with Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, and their associates”. In a letter to chair James Comer of the House committee on oversight and government reform, representatives Ro Khanna, Raja Krishnamoorthi, Robert Garcia and others said that survivors must be given the opportunity to share their stories in order to support their healing and to ensure a transparent investigation. “If the Committee is to conduct credible oversight, it must hear directly from survivors, or their representatives, who volunteer to advance our investigation on their own terms,” reads the letter. “Some survivors have expressed a clear willingness and desire to come before Congress, and the Committee cannot meet their strength and bravery with inaction.” The Texas attorney general Ken Paxton and state house speaker Dustin Burrows have filed a lawsuit in Illinois to enforce arrest warrants against Democratic lawmakers who left Texas to block Republicans from enacting a gerrymandered congressional map that would likely add five more Republican seats before next year’s midterm elections. The civil petition was filed in an Adams county, Illinois, circuit court, about a four-and-a-half-hour drive from Chicago. More than 30 Texas Democratic members are named in the suit. Other Democrats are staying in New York and Massachusetts. “We are pursuing every legal remedy at our disposal to hold these rogue legislators accountable,” said Paxton. “Texas deserves representatives who do their jobs instead of running away at the behest of their billionaire handlers.” State representative John Bucy III from Austin condemned the move, and said that Paxton and Burrows were using “the justice system to hunt down their political opponents and silence the voices of millions of Texans and Americans across the country”. “It’s now more clear than ever that Republicans are scared,” he added. “They’re scared of the voters. They’re scared of being held accountable.” During an interview with Fox News, Benjamin Netanyahu said the New York Times “should be sued” after the newspaper amended an article about starvation in Gaza to include that a child featured in the story, Mohammed Zakaria al-Mutawaq, had a pre-existing medical condition that affects his appearance, in addition to having severe malnutrition. The Times responded to the prime minister of Israel via a statement on X, asserting that “attempts to threaten independent media providing vital information and accountability to the public are unfortunately an increasingly common playbook”. “Journalists continue to report from Gaza for The Times, bravely, sensitively, and at personal risk, so that readers can see firsthand the consequences of the war,” the statement reads. Obtaining food in Gaza has become an increasingly difficult and deadly endeavor. Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed, many of them by Israeli forces, while heading toward aid sites. More than 20,000 children were admitted for treatment for acute malnutrition between April and mid-July, with more than 3,000 severely malnourished, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification. The Guardian made a separate comment when we first published the picture on the homepage and the front of the print edition. Texas representative Greg Casar, a Democrat, told supporters he understands the urge to not be “alarmist” about what is taking place across the country. But, he said, he worries the US press is not doing enough to make the stakes clear for Americans. “Think about if it was another country and the corrupt president of that country wanted to change the election laws at the last minute, and he got a political ally to threaten to arrest using federal law enforcement, the entire opposition party who’s getting in the way, and even threatened to use the judicial system to expel the entire other political party from office. You would say democracy is on its last legs in that other country,” Casar, chair of the Progressive caucus, said on an organizing call Thursday night. “But that’s not some other country. That’s the United States. That’s what we’re facing right now in Texas.” “This is what authoritarianism starts to look like,” he added. “They’re wannabe dictators, and we’ve got to keep them wannabes and not let them further consolidate their power.” Texas representative Lloyd Doggett opposes partisan gerrymandering on principle. But on Thursday, he was urging Californians to “raise” an effort by their governor to “fight fire with fire” and counter Republicans’ attempt to redraw Texas’s congressional map to gain five seats. Putting his own spin on the adage “two wrongs don’t make a right”, Doggett said: “Two wrongs can save our country.” “If we play by these separate rules, Trump will rule,” he warned on the call with other state and federal lawmakers. Not every quorum break is successful, said Doggett, who in 1979 was part of a group of Democrats dubbed the “killer bees” who hid out in a garage for days to block legislation changing the Texas presidential primary date. Republicans dropped the bill and the walkout was successful. “It’s much more difficult to win these days with the FBI, the federal law enforcement and the state doing so much to intimidate a much larger group of House Democrats,” he said, before appealing to people in California and other blue states to support partisan redistricting efforts that would offset Texas’s actions. “Raise this California effort,” he said. “It is our best hope to checkmate Donald Trump for what’s going wrong in Texas, and if you’re in any state where there’s a possibility of an attack by Republicans – Missouri, Indiana, Florida, of course, and several others – we need to activate every progressive voice to oppose the Texas plague from Donald Trump spreading across the country.” Scientists decry Trump energy chief’s plan to ‘update’ climate reports: ‘exactly what Stalin did’ The US energy secretary, Chris Wright, is facing growing criticism from scientists who say their “worst fears” were realized when Wright revealed that the Trump administration would “update” the US’s premier climate crisis reports. Wright, a former oil and gas executive, told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins earlier this week that the administration was reviewing national climate assessment reports published by past administrations. Since 2000, there have been five national climate assessment (NCA) reports, which are produced by scientists and peer-reviewed, and they are considered the gold standard report of global heating and its effects on human health, agriculture, water supplies and air pollution. “We’re reviewing them, and we will come out with updated reports on those and with comments on those reports,” said Wright, who is one of the main supporters of the administration’s “drill, baby, drill” agenda to boost fossil fuels, which are the primary cause of the climate crisis. Wright was speaking days after his agency, the Department of Energy, produced a report claiming that concern over the climate crisis was overblown. That energy department report was slammed by scientists for being a “farce” full of misinformation. Read the full story by Mark Oliver here: The Environmental Protection Agency will end a $7bn Biden-era grant program that sought to expand solar energy to low-income communities, administrator Lee Zeldin said in a post on X on Thursday. “EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,” Zeldin said in a video post. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed into law by Donald Trump last month eliminated the program’s source of funding, Zeldin added. Cancellation of the Solar for All program had been widely expected. Since taking office in January, Trump has rolled back federal support for solar and wind energy, calling the renewable resources expensive and unreliable. The Trump administration offered a $50m reward on Thursday for information leading to the arrest of Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro. “Maduro uses foreign terrorist organizations like TDA (Tren de Aragua), Sinaloa and Cartel of the Suns to bring deadly drugs and violence into our country,” attorney general Pam Bondi said in a video posted on X. In 2020, during Trump’s first term, the government offered up to $15m for information on Maduro, and then raised that reward to up to $25m in January. Donald Trump on Thursday said he will host the leaders of Azerbaijan and Armenia for an “an official peace-signing ceremony” at the White House on Friday. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said the US will also be signing bilateral economic agreements with the two countries. The countries, both of which won independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, have been at loggerheads since the late 1980s when Nagorno-Karabakh, an Azerbaijani region that had a mostly ethnic-Armenian population, broke away from Azerbaijan with support from Armenia. Katie Miller, a top aide to Elon Musk who is married to the White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, is launching a podcast for conservative mothers. “For years I’ve seen that there isn’t a place for conservative women to gather online,” she said in the announcement. “I wanted to create that space, where we have real, honest conversations with people across the political spectrum and across the world.” Miller was aan aide for Musk’s unofficial “department of government efficiency” and had served in Donald Trump’s first administration, Mike Pence’s communications director. She said in her announcement she was “concluding” her time working full-time for Musk. Democratic representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland is urging FBI agents to resist taking part in efforts to track down a group of Texas Democrats who left the state to stop a Republican effort to redistrict, the Huffington Post reports. Raskin, the top Democrat on the House judiciary committee, which conducts oversight of the FBI, said the agency has no authority to locate and investigate the state legislators as Republican senator John Cornyn claimed earlier on Thursday. “The FBI is not a national secret police force operating at the beck and call of President Trump,” Raskin told HuffPost. “It has no legal authority to track down state legislators who are breaking no federal laws just for standing up to a Republican scheme to purge Democrats from Congress and rig our elections.” “FBI personnel should refuse to participate in this act of political harassment and persecution,” Raskin added. Earlier today, Cornyn said the FBI had agreed to assist in returning Texas Democratic lawmakers who left the state to block Republicans’ effort to add five more GOP seats to the state legislature through a gerrymandered congressional map. That claim could not be independently confirmed. The Texas lawmakers who left the state are currently staying at a hotel in suburban Chicago. The US air force said it would deny all transgender service members who have served from 15 to 18 years the option to retire early and would instead separate them without retirement benefits, the AP reports. One air force sergeant said he felt “betrayed and devastated” by the move. The move means that transgender service members will now be faced with the choice of either taking a lump-sum separation payment offered to junior troops or be removed from the service. An air force spokesperson told the AP that “although service members with 15 to 18 years of honorable service were permitted to apply for an exception to policy, none of the exceptions to policy were approved”. About a dozen service members had been “prematurely notified” that they would be able to retire before that decision was reversed, according to the spokesperson who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal air force policy. A memo issued Monday announcing the new policy said that the choice to deny retirement benefits was made “after careful consideration of the individual applications”. Earlier, we reported that two senior FBI officials involved in a number of FBI investigations related to the president had been fired. Now, senior politics reporter Chris Stein brings us more details: The Trump administration is forcing out a senior FBI official who resisted demands made earlier this year for the names of agents who investigated the January 6 insurrection, two people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. Brian Driscoll briefly served as acting FBI director in the first weeks of Donald Trump’s new term, and his final day at the bureau is Friday, the people told the Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the move. Further ousters were possible. The FBI declined to comment to the Guardian. The New York Times further reported that the FBI was forcing out Walter Giardina, a special agent who worked on cases involving Trump as well as Peter Navarro, a top trade adviser to the president who was convicted of contempt of Congress. The ousters were the latest under the FBI director, Kash Patel, and his deputy, Dan Bongino, who had repeatedly alleged that the bureau had become politicized under Joe Biden. Numerous senior officials, including top agents in charge of big-city field offices, have been pushed out of their jobs, and some agents have been subjected to polygraph exams, moves that former officials say have roiled the workforce and contributed to angst. Here’s the full story: Donald Trump’s administration turned to the US supreme court in an effort to defend its aggressive immigration raids after a federal judge in Los Angeles blocked agents from profiling individuals based on race or language in pursuit of deportation targets. The justice department asked the supreme court in an emergency filing to lift the judge’s order temporarily barring agents from stopping or detaining people without “reasonable suspicion” that they are in the country illegally, by relying solely on their race or ethnicity, or if they speak Spanish or English with an accent. The move comes after a federal judge last month ordered the Trump administration to halt indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in seven California counties, including Los Angeles. Donald Trump said Thursday that he would meet with Vladimir Putin even if the Russian president won’t meet with Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump, when asked by a reporter whether Putin would need to meet with the Ukrainian president to secure a meeting with the US, said: “No, he doesn’t. No.” His comments followed Putin’s remarks earlier in the day that he hoped to meet with Trump next week, possibly in the United Arab Emirates. But the White House was still working through the details of any potential meetings, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. Donald Trump announced he will nominate the Council of Economic Advisers chair Stephen Miran to serve as a Federal Reserve governor. Miran would fill the position opened by Fed governor Adriana Kugler’s surprise resignation last week, as she returns to her tenured professorship at Georgetown University. The term expires on 31 January 2026 and is subject to approval by the Senate. Trump said the White House continues to search for someone to serve in the 14-year Fed Board seat that opens 1 February. Miran has advocated for a far-reaching overhaul of Fed governance that would include shortening board member terms, putting them under the clear control of the president and ending the “revolving door” between the executive branch and the Fed. Trump has unsuccessfully pushed the Fed to cut rates. Miran, if confirmed by the Senate, would have one of 12 votes on monetary policy at the Fed, which voted 9-2 last month to keep rates steady. Donald Trump and Stephen Moore, a fellow at the rightwing thinktank the Heritage Foundation, held an event at the White House on Thursday to show reporters “new numbers” that allege the Bureau of Labor Statistics overstated job creation during the first two years of the Biden administration. “I don’t think it’s an error,” Trump said during today’s event. “I think they did it purposely.” Moore said the data comes from “unpublished Census Bureau data”, and will supposedly be released sometime in the next six months. Moore is Trump’s former economic advisor and co-wrote the book Trumponomics: Inside the America First Plan to Revive Our Economy”, which praised the president’s economic plans. In 2019, Trump nominated Moore for a seat on the Federal Reserve board, but he withdrew amid scrutiny for his history of sexist comments and other scandals. Colleges and universities will be forced to disclose more student admissions data to prove that they are not implementing affirmative action policies, according to a directive sent by the White House on Thursday. The move comes as the Trump administration seeks to crack down on the use of race in the higher education application process. Ivy League universities, like Brown University, have reached settlements that require them to release information about applicants’ race. Colleges have been barred from considering race in admissions since 2023, when the supreme court overturned decades of precedent that allowed limited use of race as a factor. Trump’s directive would increase oversight of schools’ admissions processes. “Although the Supreme Court of the United States has definitively held that consideration of race in higher education admissions violates students’ civil rights,” the directive reads, “the persistent lack of available data – paired with the rampant use of ‘diversity statements’ and other overt and hidden racial proxies – continues to raise concerns about whether race is actually used in practice.” The directive was confirmed earlier today by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. The president’s higher tariffs hit major US trading partners today. Trump and members of his cabinet declared it an economic victory, with commerce secretary Howard Lutnick estimating that the tariffs will lead to “$50bn a month” in revenue for the USand treasury secretary Scott Bessent saying a “manufacturing renaissance” was on the horizon in an interview with MSNBC. Countries feeling the hit, however, are now scrambling to respond. Republican senator John Cornyn of Texas said today that the FBI had approved his request for the agency to help locate and arrest Democratic state lawmakers, who left the state last week to break quorum in protest over a GOP-drawn congressional map. “We cannot allow these rogue legislators to avoid their constitutional responsibilities,” Cornyn said in a statement. In response, undeterred Democrats have fired back. “The Trump administration continues to weaponize law enforcement to target political adversaries,” House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries wrote on X. “We will not be intimidated.” Meanwhile, on Truth Social, Donald Trump announced today that he’s ordered the commerce department to conduct a new census that would exclude undocumented immigrants from the official count. “People who are in our country illegally will not be counted,” the president said. It’s important to note that the US census has historically counted all residents regardless of citizenship or immigration status, as required by the 14th amendment’s “whole number of persons” provision. And in Florida, the administration’s immigration agenda hit a snag as a federal judge in Miami ordered a temporary halt to the construction of the detention centre being built in the Everglades, known as “Alligator Alcatraz”. While the injunction says the facility can continue to operate and hold detainees, any further construction must stop while environmental threats to the wetlands are assessed. More than 60 countries around the world are scrambling to respond to the latest wave of US tariffs announced by Donald Trump, which came into force on Thursday. The Brazilian government said it was planning a state aid plan for companies affected. The president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said the duties were “unacceptable blackmail”. Switzerland said it was seeking new talks with the US after a last-gasp mission to Washington by its president, Karin Keller-Sutter, failed to stop a 39% tariff blow that industry group Swissmem described as a “horror scenario”. In a statement after an emergency meeting with Keller-Sutter, the Swiss cabinet said the tariffs would “place a substantial strain on Switzerland’s export-oriented economy”. “For the affected sectors, companies and their employees, this is an extraordinarily difficult situation,” Keller-Sutter told reporters. Despite a last-minute reprieve from Trump for Lesotho with tariffs dropping from 50% to 15%, the impoverished African nation said it was already hurting. Textile industry players in the country – which produces jeans and other garments for US companies including Levi and Walmart – said the uncertainty around tariffs over the past few months had already devastated the sector, with orders cancelled and jobs cut. Read more here: A federal judge in Miami has ordered a temporary halt to the construction of the detention centre being built in the Florida everglades known as ‘Alligator Alcatraz’. The temporary injunction, which lasts for 14 days, states that the facility can continue to operate and hold detainees, but any further construction must stop while any environmental threats to the wetlands are assessed. The plaintiffs – which comprise environmental groups and Florida’s Miccosukee Tribe – argue that the detention center’s construction ultimately violates the National Environmental Policy Act. The federal judiciary said on Thursday that it would be taking “additional steps” to strengthen protections for sensitive case documents after “recent escalated cyber-attacks” on its case management system. Politico first reported the news of a hack that hit the federal courts’ filing system. “Enhancing the security of its systems is a top priority for the Judiciary,” the Federal Courts system wrote in a statement. They didn’t offer any immediate information about who was behind the cyber-attacks. My colleagues are reporting on the latest developments following Benjamin Netanyahu’s remarks that he intends to take military control of all of Gaza, before eventually handing it over to Arab forces that will govern it properly. The Israeli prime minister’s statement comes after special envoy Steve Witkoff visited the region last week to assess the ongoing humanitarian crisis, increase the flow of US aid to Gaza. You can follow along here: Democrats have responded to the news earlier that the FBI has agreed to assist local law enforcement to track down Democratic lawmakers who left the state to break quorum in protest of the state’s GOP-drawn congressional map. It comes after Republican Senator John Cornyn’s statement earlier, praising FBI director Kash Patel for his support. Hakeem Jeffries lambasted the move in a post on X. “The Trump administration continues to weaponize law enforcement to target political adversaries,” the House minority leader wrote. “We will not be intimidated.” Meanwhile, Illinois governor JB Pritzker underscored on a podcast on Wednesday that Texas lawmakers hadn’t broken any laws. He also said that any arrests by FBI agents would be “unwelcome” in his state. “They’re grandstanding, there’s literally no federal law applicable to this situation,” he added. We’re getting word that Donald Trump will announce a peace deal between Azerbaijan and Armenia on Friday 8 August, according to reports from both Reuters and CBS News. The respective leaders of both Azerbaijan and Armenia, Ilham Aliyev and Nikol Pashinyan, will attend events at the White House tomorrow, despite decades-long tension between the two countries. Part of the peace deal would include rights for the US to develop a strategic transit corridor through the South Caucasus, officials told Reuters. Tomorrow’s meeting comes as the president sets to position himself as a perpetual peacemaker, and will happen on the same day as Trump’s deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine, or face fresh sanctions. The White House says that the vice-president, JD Vance, will meet with the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, tomorrow, 8 August. Vance and his family are currently on vacation in the Cotswolds. The vice-president plans to meet Lammy at his countryside residence, Chevening House, in Kent. The suspect in the assassination of Minnesota’s house speaker and her husband, and the attempted murder of a state senator and his wife, pleaded not guilty to numerous charges in federal court on Thursday, Reuters reports. Vance Luther Boelter, 58, of Green Isle, Minnesota, led police on a two-day manhunt after the 14 June shootings in New Hope, Minnesota. He appeared before US magistrate judge Dulce Foster on Thursday and waived the reading of his six-count indictment, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. He entered a plea of not guilty in the murders of speaker emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, and the shooting of state senator John Hoffman and his wife. Boelter’s attorney, Manny Atwal, could not immediately be reached for comment. There was no immediate statement from acting US attorney for Minnesota, Joseph Thompson. Thompson in a previous statement said Boelter planned and carried out the targeted political assassinations “the likes of which have never been seen in Minnesota”. During the attacks at the homes of the two lawmakers, Boelter is accused of disguising himself as a police officer and wearing a silicone mask while driving an SUV with a license plate that simply read: “Police.” Two of the federal charges carry the possibility of the death penalty. Prosecutors have not made a decision whether to pursue a capital sentence, which would require the approval of US attorney general Pam Bondi. Boelter also faces state charges including two counts of second-degree intentional murder and two counts of second-degree attempted intentional murder. Boelter’s state case has been paused as his federal proceedings continue. Donald Trump announced today that he’s ordered the commerce department to conduct a new census that would exclude undocumented immigrants from the official count. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said the census would be “based on modern day facts and figures” and use “results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024”. He added that “people who are in our country illegally will not be counted”. The US census has historically counted all residents regardless of citizenship or immigration status, as required by the 14th amendment’s “whole number of persons” provision. Trump’s directive contradicts this constitutional requirement despite there being no evidence of problems with the 2020 census. The move would fulfil a longstanding rightwing talking point that undocumented immigrants should not influence congressional representation or electoral votes. Far-right figures have long claimed that states like California gain unfair political advantage by counting non-citizens. The political activist Charlie Kirk, for example, argued in 2020 that “California gets an extra 9 electoral votes because of counting illegals.” Census data determines congressional representation, electoral college apportionment and the distribution of federal funding for schools, hospitals and other essential services. States with large non-citizen populations – particularly California, Texas, Florida and New York – could see their political influence and federal resources sharply reduced under Trump’s proposed changes. Legal and immigration advocates have also long stressed that restricting the census to citizens could depress participation among legal immigrants, who are alreadyundercounted because they may be more reluctant to engage with government authorities. Umaymah Mohammad, perhaps the only student in the US to be suspended from medical school for remarks about Israel and Gaza, has filed a federal lawsuit against Atlanta’s Emory University, alleging discrimination under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, as well as additional complaints under state law. The lawsuit, filed on Monday morning in federal district court on Mohammad’s behalf by the Council on Islamic-American Relations in Georgia (Cair-Ga), centers on Emory’s alleged “intentional discrimination and retaliation” during disciplinary proceedings against the medical-sociology dual degree student last year. It names the university, its board of trustees and John William Eley, a dean at the medical school, as defendants. It has been filed in pursuit of “accountability and justice … [and] has potential repercussions for how student activists have been treated over the last two years in this country”, said Azka Mahmood, executive director of Cair-Ga. If successful, the lawsuit could lead to “stopping disciplinary proceedings for protected expression – and that this becomes more of a policy moving forward” – both at Emory and elsewhere, said Keon Grant, one of the Cair-Ga attorneys who filed the complaint. The school declined to provide comment to the Guardian on pending litigation. The FBI has fired two senior officials, according to a report from The New York Times. Brian Driscoll, who served as interim director before Kash Patel was confirmed, and Walter Giardiana, who was involved in a number of FBI investigations related to the president, have both been forced out per The Times’ sources. Driscoll’s removal was not immediately clear, according to The Times. But the Times also reports that neither Driscoll nor Giardina is eligible to retire, and Giardina’s wife died last month of cancer. The president is expected to sign a memorandum today, ordering universities to hand over their admissions data to the federal government, in order to prove they aren’t engaging in affirmative action and secure funding, according to a report by The Daily Caller. According to fact sheet obtained by The Daily Caller, the order will also direct the secretary of education Linda McMahon to expand the type of data that universities need to submit to the administration in order “to fully asses their practices”. In 2023, the US supreme court effectively ended affirmative action, when it ruled against the use of race in college admissions at universities and colleges across the country. Indiana state representative Matt Pierce, a Democrat, said in an interview with CNN today that Democrats in the state will “use every procedural manoeuvre available” to push back against redistricting efforts. “We have to have a national fight about this, and we have to preserve democracy. We shouldn’t be rigging the election for one way or the other,” Pierce added. This comes as vice-president JD Vance meets with Indiana governor Mike Braun and state Republicans to apply pressure on them to redraw the states congressional map – as a redistricting battle plays out across the country. In order to redraw Indiana’s map, Braun would need to call a special session of the state legislature. My colleague, Sam Levine, notes that the GOP already has control over seven of Indiana’s nine congressional seats, but Republicans also have complete control of state government, which would allow them to redraw the map to pick up more seats. Across the US’s fabled but overstretched national parks, unusual scenes are playing out this summer – following budget cuts by Donald Trump’s administration. Archeologists are staffing ticket booths, ecologists are covering visitor centers and the superintendents of parks are even cleaning the toilets. The National Park Service (NPS), responsible for maintaining cherished wildernesses and sites of cultural importance from Yellowstone to the Statue of Liberty, has lost a quarter of its permanent staff since Trump took office in January, with the administration seeking to gut the service’s budget by a third. But the administration has also ordered parks to remain open and accessible to the public, meaning the NPS has had to scramble remaining staff into public-facing roles to maintain appearances to the crowds of visitors. This has meant much of the behind-the-scenes work to protect endangered species, battle invasive plants, fix crumbling infrastructure or plan for the future needs of the US’s trove of natural wonders has been jettisoned. Read more here: Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas said today that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has approved his request for the agency to help locate and arrest Democratic state lawmakers, who left the state last week to break quorum in protest over a GOP-drawn congressional map. “I thank President Trump and Director Patel for supporting and swiftly acting on my call for the federal government to hold these supposed lawmakers accountable for fleeing Texas. We cannot allow these rogue legislators to avoid their constitutional responsibilities,” Cornyn said in a statement. The FBI declined the Guardian’s request for comment. Cornyn wrote a letter to FBI director Kash Patel earlier this week, imploring him to help round up and arrest the state legislators – many of whom are waiting out the remainder of Texas’ special session in blue states. Also making the cable news rounds today is commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, who said the US can expect “to be heading towards $50bn a month in tariff revenue,” in an interview with Fox Business Network. “And then you’re going to get the semiconductors, you’re going to get pharmaceuticals, you’re going to get all sorts of additional tariff money coming in,” he added. “Everybody understands you’ve got to see to the American consumer. The American consumer is the most powerful factor in the Earth for the economy.” When asked about how much money the US can expect to bring in from Donald Trump’s tariffs each year, treasury secretary Scott Bessent said that $300bn was “a good start”. He compared this to the $77bn brought in from tariff revenue in 2024. “This year, we could have about 300 billion of new revenue, which is 1% of GDP. And then there’s a chance that that could be higher in ‘26,” Bessent said in an interview with MSNBC. As Donald Trump’s tariffs on swathes of major US trading partners take effect today, his treasury secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview with MSNBC earlier that things have “just gotten out of balance” and “we’ve stopped making things in the US,” when quizzed about tariffs issued against key allies like South Korea, Japan, Australia, and the EU. Bessent added that he’s confident that tariffs will reinvigorate American manufacturing, citing the corporate commitments from the likes of Apple. “We want to get rid of these big deficits that we have with countries that have created these big surpluses and gutted our manufacturing base,” he said. “We’ve got trillions and trillions of manufacturing that’s going to come back, and we’re going to see that over the next couple of years.” Bessent went on to describe this period as a “manufacturing renaissance”. A White House official tells the Guardian that the president will sign two finance-related executive orders today. The first will be an action that allows 401k holders to “to access alternative assets” such as private equity, according to details shared with the Guardian. The second order will focus on Trump’s claims of banks discriminating against conservatives. This would punish banks for the process of “debanking” – which involves limiting financial services based on religious or political beliefs. We’ve gotten more details about the shooting on an army base in Georgia on Wednesday. A reminder that an active-duty soldier opened fire at Fort Stewart military base yesterday, wounding five other soldiers before being taken into custody. Officials said the alleged shooter was 28-year-old Sgt Quornelius Radford, who was assigned to Fort Stewart. Brig Gen John Lubas, commander of the third infantry division and Fort Stewart-Hunter army airfield, said soldiers in the area who witnessed the shooting “immediately and without hesitation tackled the soldier, subdued him. That allowed law enforcement to then take him into custody.” The base said in a Facebook post that the shooting occurred in the 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team area. “All soldiers were treated on-site and moved to Winn Army Community Hospital for further treatment,” the base said. Lubas confirmed the shooter did not use a military weapon. “We believe it was a personal handgun,” he said. According to reporting from The New York Times, Radford sent a text message to his aunt on Wednesday morning which said that he “loved everybody, and that he’ll be in a better place because he was about to go and do something”. The Times also spoke with Radford’s father, who said he hasn’t noticed anything unusual about his son’s behavior recently, and didn’t know what might have led him to attack his fellow soldiers. Donald Trump is at the White House today. His day is looking quiet until noon EDT, when he’ll sign executive orders. Then at 4pm EDT he’s deliver remarks in the East Room. We’ll be watching and bringing you the latest. President Donald Trump on Thursday called for the Intel new CEO Lip-Bu Tan to immediately resign, saying he is “highly conflicted” after questions arose about his ties to Chinese firms. “There is no other solution to this problem,” he said in a Truth Social post. It comes as Republican senator Tom Cotton sent a letter to Intel’s board chair on Wednesday with questions about Tan’s ties to Chinese firms and a recent criminal case involving his former company Cadence Design. Writing to “express concern about the security and integrity of Intel’s operations and its potential impact on US national security”, Cotton asked in the letter to Intel chairperson Frank Yeary whether the company’s board was aware of the subpoenas sent to Cadence during Tan’s time there as CEO before Intel hired him. Cotton asked what measures were taken to address those concerns. US border patrol agents carried out a raid outside a Home Depot in Los Angeles on Wednesday, with officers jumping out of an unmarked rental truck and chasing and arresting more than a dozen people. Videos of the operation, and federal officials’ statements boasting about the detentions, have raised questions about whether the US government was complying with a federal court order halting indiscriminate raids in the region due to evidence of racial profiling. That ruling, upheld last week by an appeals court, followed reports of Latino US citizens getting swept up in LA raids and accounts of undocumented people being targeted based on their appearance and whether they spoke Spanish. Clips of the early morning raid by Home Depot in the Westlake neighborhood, near MacArthur Park, showed masked, heavily armed officers jumping out of a yellow truck from Penske, a private rental company, and people fleeing. Day laborers often gather outside Home Depot stores looking for work and have been subject to aggressive immigration raids in southern California. One day-laborer present for the Wednesday raid told the Los Angeles Times that the Penske truck pulled up to the parking lot around 6.45am, with the driver telling people gathered in Spanish that he had work to offer. Someone then rolled up the back of the truck, and masked agents, including one in a cowboy hat, jumped out as people scattered, the witness said. Donald Trump said he would impose a 100% tariff on foreign computer chips, likely raising the cost of electronics, autos, household appliances and other goods deemed essential for the digital age. “We’ll be putting a tariff on of approximately 100% on chips and semiconductors,” Trump said in the Oval Office while meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook. “But if you’re building in the United States of America, there’s no charge.” The Republican president said companies that make computer chips in the US would be spared the import tax. During the Covid-19 pandemic, a shortage of computer chips increased the price of autos and contributed to an overall uptick in inflation. Trump and Cook were meeting on Wednesday to discuss an agreement for Apple to invest $100bn in manufacturing in the US over the next four years. That comes after the iPhone maker already pledged to invest $500bn domestically earlier this year. With Apple’s new investment, the total figure is now at $600bn. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he has instructed the Department of Commerce to begin creating a new Census “based on modern day facts and figures” and that uses the results and information from the 2024 presidential election. “People who are in our Country illegally will not be counted in the census,” he said in a Truth Social post. He added: I have instructed our Department of Commerce to immediately begin work on a new and highly accurate CENSUS based on modern day facts and figures and, importantly, using the results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024. Donald Trump on Wednesday celebrated a commitment by Apple to increase its investments in US manufacturing by an additional $100bn over the next four years. Apple’s plan to up its domestic investment comes as it seeks to avoid Trump’s threatened tariffs, which would increase the tech giant’s costs as it relies on a complex international supply chain to produce its iPhones. Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, warned during an earnings call in May that the tariffs could cost the company up to $900m that fiscal quarter alone. After Cook gifted Trump a US-made souvenir with a 24-karat gold base at the Oval Office on Wednesday, the president praised the corporation, telling reporters: “Companies like Apple, they’re coming home … This is a significant step toward the ultimate goal of ensuring that iPhones sold in America also are made in America.” Cook said many components of the iPhones are already made domestically, including glass, semiconductors and face ID, but that final assembly of the devices would remain overseas “for a while”. In an earlier statement, Cook had said the new investments involve work with 10 companies across the US that produce components used in Apple products. Apple had previously said it intended to invest $500bn domestically, a figure it will now increase to $600bn. Apple also claimed that it would directly hire 20,000 US workers over the next four years. JD Vance’s team had the army corps of engineers take the unusual step of changing the outflow of a lake in Ohio to accommodate a recent boating excursion on a family holiday, the Guardian has learned. The request from the US Secret Service was made to “support safe navigation” of the US vice-president’s security detail for an August outing on the Little Miami River, according to a statement by the US army corps of engineers (USACE). Vance was spotted in the south-western Ohio area on 2 August, his 41st birthday, according to social media posts that noted he was seen canoeing on the river, a tributary that Caesar Creek Lake feeds into. One source with knowledge of the matter who communicated with the Guardian anonymously alleged that the outflow request for the Caesar Creek Lake was not just to support the vice-president’s Secret Service detail, but also to create “ideal kayaking conditions”. The Guardian could not independently confirm this specific claim. The news raises questions about whether Vance’s office was potentially exploiting public infrastructure resources for his personal recreation at a time when the Trump administration has cut billions of dollars in foreign aid, scientific research and government jobs as part of its “efficiency” drive. The vice-president’s office did not respond to a request for comment. Leading Democrats are sounding the alarm over Donald Trump’s reported plan to divert funds from the US nuclear arsenal to convert a luxury jet gifted by Qatar into a new Air Force One. The US president provoked an outcry in May when it emerged that he would accept a $400m Boeing 747-8 jet as a free gift from the Qatari royal family. Stripping down and securing the plane so it can transport Trump for a few years will cost taxpayers an estimated $1bn. Now Democrats are seizing on media reports that the retrofit will be part funded by money redirected from Sentinel, a nuclear missile modernisation programme already running years behind schedule and said to be 81% over budget. In a letter obtained by the Guardian, senators Elizabeth Warren, Tammy Duckworth, Ed Markey and Adam Schiff, along with representatives John Garamendi and Jamie Raskin, demand answers from Troy Meink, the secretary of the air force. The letter reminds Meink that, in testimony to the Senate armed services committee, he acknowledged the Qatari plane needs “significant modifications” to meet Air Force One standards. These are likely to include defences against threats ranging from surface-to-air missiles to a nuclear blast, secure and reliable communications systems and protections against counterintelligence. The Democrats write: “In June, you told Congress that the cost of retrofitting the Qatari Boeing 747-8 ‘wouldn’t be anywhere near’ the reported $1 billion estimate. Do you still believe this to be the case?” Switzerland’s government will hold an emergency meeting on Thursday to decide its next move after its president returned home empty-handed from an 11th-hour trip to Washington aimed at averting a crippling 39% US import tariff on Swiss goods. An urgent meeting of the seven-member Federal Council - Switzerland’s governing cabinet - will take place in Bern in the early afternoon, the government said a post on X. Swiss president Karin Keller-Sutter left Washington on Wednesday without a new deal and did not meet with US president Donald Trump or any of his top trade officials, two sources told Reuters. Her proposal for a 10% tariff rate was rejected by US officials, one of the sources added. Negotiations between Switzerland and the United States over tariffs will continue, but more time is needed to strike a deal, according to a Swiss source familiar with the discussions. President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he may use the National Guard to police the streets of Washington, DC, and a White House official said federal law enforcement would increase its presence in the city this week. The threat - and the move to follow through on it - is the latest step by Trump and his administration toward taking over running the city that serves as the seat of the US government. “We have a capital that’s very unsafe,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “We have to run DC This has to be the best-run place in the country.” A White House official told Reuters that operational details about the increased federal presence were still being finalized. South African president Cyril Ramaphosa held a telephone call with US president Donald Trump on bilateral trade and the two countries’ trade negotiating teams will have more detailed talks, Ramaphosa’s office said on Thursday. South Africa tried for months but failed to negotiate a trade deal with Washington ahead of Trump’s deadline. US imports from South Africa now face a 30% duty. “The two leaders undertook to continue with further engagements, recognising the various trade negotiations the US is currently involved in,” Ramaphosa’s office said in a statement. “Respective trade negotiating teams will take forward more detailed discussions.” A meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and United States president Donald Trump is likely to take place next week, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti quoted Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov as saying on Thursday. More on this development as we get it. The US Customs and Border Protection agency began collecting the higher tariffs of 10% to 50% at 12.01am EDT after weeks of suspense over Trump’s final tariff rates and frantic negotiations with major trading partners that sought to lower them. The leaders of Brazil and India vowed not to be cowed by Trump’s hardline bargaining position, even while their negotiators sought a reprieve from the highest tariff levels. The new rates will test Trump’s strategy for shrinking US trade deficits without causing massive disruptions to global supply chains or provoking higher inflation and stiff retaliation from trading partners, Reuters reported. After unveiling his ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs in April, Trump has frequently modified his plan, slapping much higher rates on imports from some countries, including 50% for goods from Brazil, 39% from Switzerland, 35% from Canada and 25% from India. He announced on Wednesday a separate, 25% tariff on Indian goods, to be imposed in 21 days, over India’s purchases of Russian oil. “RECIPROCAL TARIFFS TAKE EFFECT AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT!,” Trump said on Truth Social just ahead of the deadline. “BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP AMERICA’S GREATNESS WOULD BE A RADICAL LEFT COURT THAT WANTS TO SEE OUR COUNTRY FAIL!” Across the US’s fabled but overstretched national parks, unusual scenes are playing out this summer following budget cuts by Donald Trump’s administration. Archeologists are staffing ticket booths, ecologists are covering visitor centers and the superintendents of parks are even cleaning the toilets. The National Park Service (NPS), responsible for maintaining cherished wildernesses and sites of cultural importance from Yellowstone to the Statue of Liberty, has lost a quarter of its permanent staff since Trump took office in January, with the administration seeking to gut the service’s budget by a third. But the administration has also ordered parks to remain open and accessible to the public, meaning the NPS has had to scramble remaining staff into public-facing roles to maintain appearances to the crowds of visitors. This has meant much of the behind-the-scenes work to protect endangered species, battle invasive plants, fix crumbling infrastructure or plan for the future needs of the US’s trove of natural wonders has been jettisoned. “It’s nearly impossible to do the leadership role expected of me,” said one superintendent who heads a park in the western US who didn’t want to be named for fear of retribution from the administration. “I’m doing everything now. That means I regularly have to make sure the doors are open, I have to run the visitor center, I have to clean the bathrooms. I’d say I’m cleaning the bathroom on a weekly basis now because there’s no one else to do it.” This sort of triage situation is occurring across the 433 sites and 85m acres – including 63 national parks and an array of battlefields, monuments and cultural sites – that make up the national park system in the US, multiple current and former NPS staff have told the Guardian, risking long-term degradation of prized parks. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of US politics as JD Vance prepares to visit Indiana on Thursday to discuss redistricting with Republican leaders. The vice president’s trip comes as Donald Trump ramps up pressure on GOP states to redraw congressional boundaries and give the party more winnable seats in the 2026 midterm elections. In Texas, Democrats who left the state in an effort to block a new congressional map from being implemented say they experienced a bomb threat at their Illinois hotel on Wednesday morning amid the standoff. Vance is scheduled to hold private meetings with Gov. Mike Braun and others before attending a GOP fundraiser on Thursday night in the solidly Republican state. Braun had earlier told reporters he expects to discuss several matters with the vice president — including redistricting — but said no commitments have been made. “It looks like it’s going to happen across many Republican states,” Braun said. As Associated Press reports, Indiana is staunchly Republican, outnumbering Democrats in Indiana 7-2, limiting the possibilities of squeezing out another seat. Opponents of any redistricting attempt are planning to make their objections known on Thursday with protests and a news conference by the two Democratic members of the state’s congressional delegation. The constitutionality of the move would also almost certainly be challenged in court. We’ll bring you all the developments throughout the day. In other news: Donald Trump has claimed “great progress was made” during talks on ending the war in Ukraine between his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin on Wednesday. The three-hour talks came two days before a deadline the US president set for Russia to reach a peace deal in the war or face fresh sanctions. The White House is placing an additional 25% tariff on imports from India, bringing total tariffs up to 50%, in retaliation for the country’s purchase of oil from Russia, according to an executive order signed on Wednesday morning. India has 21 days to respond to the potential tariffs before they go into effect. The tariffs will be tacked on to a 25% tariff on India Trump set last week as a “penalty” for the country’s trading relationship with Russia. A new report has found hundreds of reported cases of human rights abuses in US immigration detention centers. The alleged abuses uncovered include deaths in custody, physical and sexual abuse of detainees, denial of access to attorneys, and child separation.

The man charged with killing the top Democrat in the Minnesota House and her husband, and wounding a state senator and his wife, is expected to plead not guilty when he’s arraigned in federal court on Thursday, his attorney said. Vance Boelter, 58, of Green Isle, Minnesota, was indicted 15 July on six counts of murder, stalking and firearms violations. The murder charges could carry the federal death penalty, though prosecutors say that decision is several months away.
