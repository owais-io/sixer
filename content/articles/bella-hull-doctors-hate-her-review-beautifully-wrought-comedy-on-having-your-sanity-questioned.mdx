  Bella Hull: Doctors Hate Her review – beautifully wrought comedy on having
  your sanity questioned
sectionName: Stage
webPublicationDate: '2025-08-12T11:00:17Z'
bodyText: >-
  Exactly how fine was the “fine” relationship at the heart of Bella Hull’s
  show? She greets us with a fixed, manic smile on her face – the mask of her
  wonderfully honed stage persona, charming and determinedly upbeat on the
  surface, with something steelier glinting beneath. That persona mirrors the
  show itself, its surface patterned with dreamlike detours and sparkling
  one-liners, the tendrils of darker truths rising at choice moments. An ex is
  painted as someone with a rigid sense of how things should be. He valued
  rationality and normalcy; she embraced creativity and astrology. The show
  charts her realisation that this wasn’t a good match, that she was never truly
  accepted, and hints at the effects of having your sanity questioned by someone
  you loved. There are surreal moments – her imagined life as one of the mice
  infesting her flat, her unorthodox solution to childbirth – and routines that
  take us from her childhood to the current disarray of her London life. One
  segment on the regularity with which she overhears her waifish flatmate having
  vigorous sex is particularly fun, her irreverent delivery bringing every line
  to life. It’s this combination of sharp writing and precise performance that
  makes Hull’s show such a joy to watch. Jokes are piled on jokes, finding
  surprising angles on everything from personal trainers to plastic waste and
  Samuel Beckett. She paints a vivid picture of childhood years spent living
  with her grandma, a barefoot clairvoyant who introduced her to a “diabetic
  revenge horse”, while a poetic monologue is spun from a family holiday and
  sets up a memorable visual finale. Hull proves revenge is a dish best served
  stuffed full of punchlines, with a side of the occult. At Monkey Barrel (The
  Hive), Edinburgh, until 24 August All our Edinburgh festival reviews
