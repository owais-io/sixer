  Recognition of a state of Palestine must be more than a performative response
  to domestic political pressure. It’s long been framed as the reward at the end
  of a negotiated two-state solution between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
  However, given the absence of a viable Palestinian government and overt
  resistance from the Israeli government, any such solution has been little more
  than a default talking point used by western politicians for some time.
  According to Pew Research, only 21% of Israeli adults think Israel and a
  Palestinian state can coexist peacefully – a historic low. But what’s the
  alternative? Western governments are forcing it now, because of global outrage
  at the appalling humanitarian situation including starvation in Gaza, with
  recognition of a Palestinian state being used as a carrot for the Palestinians
  and a stick for the Israelis to begin such a process. What would recognition
  mean? In Australia, Anthony Albanese is right to point to the need for “action
  not slogans” amid the push from the public and some on his own backbench,
  particularly the former minister Ed Husic, in the face of horrific images from
  Gaza. Recognition of Palestine statehood may be a way of responding to public
  sentiment without imposing substantive sanctions on Israel in response to its
  breaches of international humanitarian law. It may well be a means to an end
  but it would need to be coupled with other extensive measures to create any
  pathway to peace, and even then it’s contingent on so many unlikely
  commitments from both Hamas and Israel that it may be doomed. The pressure on
  Australia comes as its allies France, the UK and Canada have all indicated
  willingness to formally recognise a state of Palestine as soon as next month.
  This is not simple, in any respect. Hamas has set the tone, demanding
  “unconditional international recognition” of an independent Palestinian state.
  Under a French/Saudi proposal, backed by the EU and other Arab nations, a
  temporary international mission would step in to stabilise the situation. The
  various conditions and actions outlined by those nations flagging Palestinian
  recognition borrow some elements of the Arab peace initiative, which has been
  tossed back and forth since the early 2000s due to various sticking points
  including the return of Palestinian refugees. While Benjamin Netanyahu has
  signalled some willingness to negotiate with Arab nations, he has previously
  rejected that plan. Canada has also demanded elections in the Palestinian
  territories next year that exclude Hamas. The last parliamentary election in
  the territories was in 2006, with the Palestinian Authority since then
  controlling parts of the West Bank under Mahmoud Abbas, and Hamas controlling
  Gaza. Even if all the other conditions were miraculously met on both sides,
  holding a viable democratic election within 12 months would be a mammoth
  practical challenge as well as a diplomatic one. This is just one of many
  serious roadblocks to progress and is a space where Australia could have
  impact if Albanese is serious about action over slogans. He says Australia is
  a small player in this. But offering development assistance and expertise in
  conjunction with other nations could help. Statehood, for example, would offer
  the opportunity for a full Australian embassy in Palestine, a potential
  vehicle for hand-in-hand work to help build a new leadership framework. With
  or without statehood, while removing Hamas from Gaza is one critical step,
  democracy building to avoid a dangerous void in governance is another. During
  an Australian parliamentary visit to Israel and the West Bank in August 2023 –
  just before the Hamas attacks – I joined a meeting with a particularly dynamic
  aspiring political candidate in Ramallah. She said new leaders and fresh
  political thinkers were often shut out of the closed-shop Palestinian
  Authority. As it stands the authority has neither the mandate nor the
  logistical resources to lead the immense political change and rebuild
  required. Equally problematic is getting the Netanyahu government to agree to
  any of the conditions, when its hardline rightwing members have threatened to
  walk even over a ceasefire, let alone a permanent pathway to peace. For once,
  Albanese’s characteristic pragmatic caution seems right, recognising both the
  opportunity to apply pressure while also acknowledging the limits to
  Australia’s influence on what has so far been an intractable conflict. • Zoe
