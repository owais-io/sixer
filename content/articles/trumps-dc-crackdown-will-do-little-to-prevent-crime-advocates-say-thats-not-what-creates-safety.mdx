  Donald Trump’s hyperbolic portrayal of crime in major American cities, and his
  deployment of the national guard in Washington DC ostensibly in an effort to
  combat it, have reignited a decades-old debate about crime, violence and which
  policies and approaches can address it. The US president has cited cities such
  as Oakland, Philadelphia and Chicago as examples of places overwhelmed by
  crime and violence. He has put forward an increased militarization of law
  enforcement, and more money and legal protections for police, as the most
  effective ways to address homicides and other violent crime. But to violence
  prevention workers, the recent statements appeared to be made not out of care
  and concern for the lower-income Black and Latino victims – who bear an
  outsized share of the nation’s crimes – but to undermine and dismiss the
  progress community groups have made. And, the advocates argue, the
  administration’s emphasis on law enforcement and prosecution as the sole ways
  to stop crime will do little to stop the cycles of violence and property crime
  that these groups have faced through Republican and Democratic administrations
  alike. “The police are about response. But that’s not what creates safety,”
  said Aqeela Sherrills, a longtime community violence intervention leader in
  Los Angeles. “A lot of our urban communities have been war zones because they
  lack investment in infrastructure and programming. It’s really disheartening
  to hear the president of the United States put out misinformation.” Sherrills
  began his career in violence prevention in Watts in the early 90s. Since then
  he’s been a leading force in several organisations that work intensely with
  the small portion of a city’s population responsible for the most violence in
  an effort to prevent crime and support victims of crime. Throughout his
  tenure, he said, he had seen the biggest successes in violence reduction come
  through training local non-profits, community leaders and officials on
  different violence community prevention models and then allowing them to build
  bespoke strategies from there. Over the decades, various models have seen
  major successes. Some deploy violence prevention workers to middle and high
  schools. In other programs, they use probation officers as a conduit to
  connect with young adults who are carrying and using firearms illegally. Some
  programs send workers to hospitals after a shooting, in an effort to prevent
  retaliatory violence. Some models rely on a police-community partnership,
  others don’t involve police at all. But most programs center on connecting
  with mostly young men and teenage boys whose conflicts spill out on to city
  streets, traumatizing entire neighborhoods. This method has shown promise,
  research shows, In 2024 the Brooklyn community of Baltimore went a year
  without homicides after deploying a program called Safe Streets. And cities
  such as Oakland, Seattle and Philadelphia, where city leaders have invested in
  similar gun violence reduction programs, have seen drops in homicides when the
  programs were thriving, according to the Major Cities Chiefs Association’s
  violent crime survey. And while the reasons for the ebb and flow of homicides
  can’t be reduced to one program or strategy, those working to build these
  programs up have been fighting for credit and acknowledgment. During the Biden
  administration, they got it. Their approaches finally found federal support
  with the creation of an office of gun violence prevention and federal dollars
  for community prevention groups working on the ground. In past years, programs
  have expanded across the US as more municipalities build their own offices of
  violence prevention. But these insights don’t appear to inform the Trump
  administration’s approach, Sherrills adds. “He’s not reading the data, he’s
  not looking at the trends and reports, it’s just more kneejerk reactions,” he
  said. “It’s shortsighted because they’re only speaking about one aspect of our
  criminal legal system.” This most recent crime debate comes nearly four months
  after the Trump administration cut nearly $170m in grants from gun violence
  prevention organizations, including several groups founded and co-founded by
  Sherrills who have had to lay off several staff members, dealing a serious
  blow to critical summertime programming. For small, upstart organizations this
  loss of funds puts their work in jeopardy, said Fredrick Womack, whose
  organization, Operation Good, lost 20% of its budget due to the April cuts.
  Womack says he was dismayed to hear the list of cities that Trump singled out,
  because they are all cities with Black leaders who have invested in community
  violence intervention. The calls for increased police and potential military
  presences, he says, shows a disconnect between the halls of power and the
  needs of the people most affected by violent crime. “How is the military going
  to provide support for victims when they need someone who’s going to be
  compassionate to what they’re going through?” He asked. “I know people want
  justice, but they also need support. They need healing and counseling. “They
  won’t go into the projects and ask the people how life is going for you. But
  they’ll look at someone who lives in the hills who heard a gunshot two miles
  away last week and say: ‘We have a crime problem,’” he continued. Womack
  founded Operation Good in 2013, and since then he and his small staff and
  gaggle of volunteers have worked with the teenagers and young men responsible
  for most of the city’s violence and given them odd jobs and taken them to
  civil rights museums so they can understand where they come from and gain a
  sense of community. Womack’s work has made a difference: in the years since
  the pandemic – which saw nationwide surges of gun violence – the homicide rate
  started to tick down, a change city officials have attributed in part to the
  work of community-based groups including Operation Good, and their
  collaboration with the police. *** Community leaders also argue that not only
  will Trump’s approach be less effective, it’s not aimed at helping the people
  most affected by violence. During a 12 August press conference, Jeanine Pirro,
  the former Fox News host who was recently appointed the US attorney for DC,
  argued that Trump’s rhetoric about crime and his administration’s approach to
  violence in DC were done in the name of victims. Flanked by posters of mostly
  Black teenagers and children killed by gun violence, Pirro argued that
  policies including DC’s Youth Rehabilitation Act have only emboldened
  perpetrators. “I guarantee you that every one of these individuals was shot
  and killed by someone who felt they were never gonna be caught,” Pirro told
  reporters. And when reporters asked about addressing the root causes of crime
  and violence and the recent cuts to community-based programs, Pirro argued
  that her focus is on being punitive, not preventive. For Leia Schenk, a
  Sacramento-based victim and violence prevention advocate, these sorts of
  sentiments, while common among conservatives, miss the point. “It’s tone-deaf
  and an oxymoron. The root causes are why we have victims,” Schenk said. “In my
  experience [crime and violence] come from systemic oppression. Meaning if a
  family can’t feed their kids, they’re gonna steal, rob or commit some sort of
  fraud to just live and survive.” Schenk has been working in the community
  advocacy space for more than three decades and in that time has seen the most
  successful approaches to youth crime, shootings and other forms of violence
  happen when schools districts, local mental and physical healthcare systems
  get a level of investment that matches the scale of the problem. “We’re seeing
  the most success when we are supported – from schools to law enforcement to
  churches – their support allows us to do what we’re doing on a bigger scale.”
  Despite the comments and moves from the Trump administration, Sherrills says
  the field of violence prevention will continue to thrive thanks to a strong
  foundation that was fortified in recent years due to federal support and
  increased support from philanthropic groups. “We know that we’re in
  challenging times but it’s about doubling down on success and making sure we
  preserve the wins,” he said. “We’re going to continue to see violence trend
  down because of the work practitioners are doing in the field. Folks are tired
  of the killing and the dying and are looking for alternative ways to create
  better ways of navigating a conflict so that it doesn’t lead to violence.”
