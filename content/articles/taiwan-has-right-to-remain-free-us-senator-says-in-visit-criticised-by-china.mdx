  A visit to Taiwan by two US senators has drawn criticism from China, which
  claims the island as its own and objects to any contact between officials of
  the two sides. The chair of the Senate armed services committee, Roger Wicker,
  and the Nebraska senator Deb Fischer arrived in Taipei on Friday for a series
  of high-level meetings with senior Taiwanese leaders. They plan to discuss
  US-Taiwan relations, regional security and trade and investment, according to
  the American Institute in Taiwan, Washington’s de facto embassy in lieu of
  formal diplomatic relations with the self-governing island democracy. Upon
  arrival, Wicker said: “A thriving democracy is never fully assured … and we’re
  here to talk to our friends and allies in Taiwan about what we’re doing to
  enhance worldwide peace.” Wicker told Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, during
  a meeting at the presidential office in Taipei, that he and Fischer were
  visiting to get a better understanding of Taiwan’s needs and concerns. “We
  come here from the United States bringing a message from the Congress of
  commitment, of long-term friendship and a determination that a free country
  like Taiwan absolutely has the right to remain free and preserve
  self-determination,” Wicker said. “At a time of global unrest, it is extremely
  significant for us to be here,” Fischer added, noting that discussions would
  include “security, opportunities and progress for this part of the world”. The
  Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun protested against the visit
  by the two Republicans, saying it “undermines China’s sovereignty and
  territorial integrity, and sends a gravely wrong signal to the separatist
  Taiwan independence forces”. The US is Taiwan’s largest supplier of arms. It
  provides the island with the latest-generation tanks, air defence missiles and
  upgraded F-16 jet fighters as part of its guarantee of security against
  Beijing’s threat to invade. China considers the US supply of arms to Taiwan a
  violation of commitments made to it by previous White House administrations.
  But US-Taiwan ties have been strained since Donald Trump took office and
  launched a global trade war while also pressing governments in Europe and
  elsewhere to spend more on their own defence. The Trump administration
  reportedly denied permission for Lai to stop over in New York as part of a
  planned official trip to Latin America this month after Beijing objected. Lai
  reportedly then cancelled the trip.
