  Scientists say a bumper season for southern right whales in South Australia is
  a “sign of hope” for the state amid the ongoing effects of a devastating algal
  bloom. Flinders University marine biologist and chief scientist of the
  Australian right whale research program, Dr Claire Charlton, said research
  teams were pleased to record early sightings of almost 200 whales off the
  state’s coastline, after lower numbers in recent years. It comes amid concerns
  about the harmful algal bloom which has caused the deaths of some marine life
  off the SA coast. “This week we recorded almost 200 whales across South
  Australia, with 70 females and calves at Head of Bight, nine females and
  calves at Fowlers Bay and four females with calves at Encounter Bay. These are
  record numbers observed since 2016,” Charlton said. Sign up to get climate and
  environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletter “We
  were hoping for a bumper year, and we’re really relieved that there’s a lot of
  whales around. It’s a good sign that they still are recovering and coming to
  our waters – this is a good sign of hope.” The bumper season coincides with
  the 30th anniversary of the Great Australian Bight marine park, one of the
  primary calving grounds for southern right whales. The whales migrate from
  their sub-Antarctic foraging grounds to the Australian coast between May and
  October for calving, nursing and mating. The long-term data showed southern
  right whales often returned to the same places, Charlton said. “This year, we
  know that there’s a female here having a calf, that she might be as old as 50
  or more, and she was first sighted with a calf in 1984. We have another female
  here having her 12th calf sighted at Head of Bight,” she said. “They have this
  imprinted memory where often the mothers will return to the same place where
  they were given birth to, and they’ll return to that site to calve.” While
  celebrating this season’s numbers, scientists cautioned that recent research
  drawing on 30 years of data, published in Marine Mammal Science and the
  Journal of Cetacean Research and Management, showed population growth was
  slowing and reproductive success declining. Southern right whales were
  depleted to near extinction from commercial whaling in the 19th and 20th
  centuries, Charlton said. It took decades after their protection in 1935 to
  see signs of their recovery and presence in Australian waters, and they remain
  listed as endangered under federal environmental laws. Aerial survey data from
  1976 to 2024 indicated the current population size ranged between 2,346 and
  3,940 individuals (or 16% to 26% of pre-whaling levels), with declines in calf
  abundance since 2017. Charlton said there were concerns about marine heatwaves
  and the ongoing algal bloom along the SA coast, particularly given the bloom’s
  presence around the Fleurieu peninsula near Encounter Bay, where the whales
  often reside. But so far the overlap between the algal bloom and the whale’s
  range was limited. “It’s certainly something that requires future research and
  monitoring to understand the effects, and projections and forecasts for the
  future,” she said. “We do know that globally, heatwaves are affecting the
  foraging success and the reproductive success of baleen whales and of southern
  right whales.” Marine biologist Dr Michael Bossley, who has been tracking the
  effects of the algal bloom, said while it didn’t appear to directly cause
  fatalities in marine mammals, there was a concern about the potential
  long-term impact on food resources for animals like dolphins and seals.
  However he said that southern right whales do not feed in the waters off the
  South Australian coast. Bossley said the bumper whale numbers were “excellent
  news”. “At least from the whale’s perspective – that’s some good news amid the
  gloom.”
