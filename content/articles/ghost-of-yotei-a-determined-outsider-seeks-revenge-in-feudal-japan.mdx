  Atsu is no samurai. The lead character in Ghost of Yōtei is a wandering
  sellsword from a lowly family. Her sex and lack of status mean that, following
  the murders of her family, she has no fixed place in 17th-century Japanese
  society, and there is no permitted path for her to tread if she is to get
  revenge on the Yōtei Six, the men who killed her loved ones. As the game’s
  co-director Nate Fox puts it, “Atsu is not somebody who walks in to a room and
  people pay respect to.” Yōtei’s predecessor, Sucker Punch Productions’ 2020
  sprawling open-world game Ghost of Tsushima, is the story of a samurai, Jin
  Sakai, who shreds his honour to defend his homeland. Jin can’t repel the
  Mongols attacking Tsushima as a noble warrior, but as “the Ghost”, a
  fear-inspiring legend willing to use any dirty tactic to gain the upper hand,
  he can. If Ghost of Tsushima is about a man grappling with the trade of one
  kind of power for another, Yōtei sees Atsu seize the only power she can with
  both hands. Atsu adopts the mantle of an onryō, a revenge spirit from Japanese
  folklore. By embracing this legend, she becomes a figure of fear to her
  enemies. While the resulting game is similar to Tsushima – in Ghost of Yōtei
  you also travel across a romanticised open-world recreation of feudal Japan on
  horseback, carving up your enemies with precise strokes of your katana – the
  shift from high-class samurai to vagrant sellsword shows itself in unexpected
  ways. “She has a different life than Jin, and we want to bring that out
  through interactivity,” Fox says. That means removing Ghost of Tsushima’s
  contemplative moments, such as those during which Jin would meditate on his
  surroundings and transform his struggle into haiku. “Jin was a scholarly
  samurai; he would pause to reflect and take in the beauty of nature. Atsu is
  not that person.” Those moments softened the rough edges of Tsushima, a
  mellowing that Sucker Punch doesn’t want to apply to the feral world of Yōtei.
  Atsu doesn’t write poems; she collects bounties as she hunts down the warriors
  that stalk Hokkaido. Sucker Punch also expresses the difference in
  protagonists with a subtle innovation for open-world games: a movable
  campsite. “We like creating features that are tonally supportive,” Yōtei’s
  other game director, Jason Connell, says. “Camping is something you would
  expect in a world like this.” And Fox adds, “Atsu’s a sellsword used to
  sleeping rough”. As game worlds have expanded and the numbers of questlines
  and upgrade trees have multiplied, it has created a barrier of administration
  between players and the worlds they’re exploring. Instead of moving on foot,
  they use fast travel to warp between markers on the map. “It’s discordant,”
  Connell says. One moment you might be in a tropical forest fighting
  mercenaries, the next you’re on a mountaintop upgrading a weapon before
  hopping to a beach to deliver a quest item. Atsu’s camp is Sucker Punch’s
  attempt to redress this disruption and wrap the world around the player. Quest
  givers, shopkeepers and key characters will now visit you, providing a way to
  continue your journey without interrupting the flow of the story. “It’s a
  convenience,” Connell says, “and a more diegetic experience.” In this way,
  Yōtei is set to be both an evolution of Ghost of Tsushima and an inversion.
  Set 300 years after the first game and on the other side of Japan, with the
  player wearing the sandals of a character from the opposite end of society, it
  promises to be a familiar world filled with unexpected change. • Ghost of
  Yōtei is released on PlayStation 5, on 2 October
