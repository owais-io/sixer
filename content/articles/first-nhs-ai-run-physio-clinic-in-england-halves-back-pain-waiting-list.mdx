  The first NHS AI-run physiotherapy clinic has halved the waiting list for back
  pain and musculoskeletal services, according to the NHS trust where the pilot
  has taken place. More than 2,500 patients living in Cambridgeshire and
  Peterborough were able to access Flok Health, a physiotherapy platform run by
  AI, over a 12-week period starting in February. The platform, which was
  created using video footage of a human physiotherapist, provides same-day
  automated video appointments with a digital physiotherapist via an app that
  responds to information given by a patient in real time. When the clinic was
  first launched in Cambridgeshire, waiting times for elective community
  musculoskeletal (MSK) services in the region were about 18 weeks. The waiting
  times for all MSK conditions decreased by 44% over the course of the 12-week
  period due to the use of Flok combined with other initiatives such as
  community assessment days, according to Cambridgeshire Community Services NHS
  trust (CCS), which deployed the services in those areas of England. Regarding
  back pain, the Flok AI clinic alone reduced waiting lists for the condition by
  55% and saved 856 hours of clinician time a month, according to the company.
  “Seeing the impact our service has had in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough,
  which is also where our team lives and works, has been incredibly meaningful,”
  said Finn Stevenson, the co-founder and chief executive of Flok Health.
  Anna-Marie Cooper, from Cambridge, had a positive experience using Flok
  despite being initially sceptical when she was referred to the AI physio for
  her back pain. “I have used private physiotherapy services in the past, but I
  found my experience with the AI physio as good as, if not better than any care
  I’ve received before,” she said. “Flok’s service was so intuitive, and having
  the flexibility to schedule and rearrange appointments whenever I wanted
  really suited me.” But the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP) said that
  although AI holds great potential for the future of healthcare treatments, it
  was concerned about widening health inequalities for other patients who
  couldn’t or didn’t want to access physiotherapy care via an app. John Cowman,
  the chief executive of the CSP, said: “When tackling the problem of waiting
  times, it is important to address the root causes, one of which is the
  recruitment freezes currently stopping graduate physiotherapists from finding
  work in the NHS. We have a workforce ready to provide proven, safe care which
  will help cut waiting times and ensure people get the appointments they need.
  “AI will certainly play an increasing role in healthcare in the coming years
  as a tool to support services, but should be run in conjunction with
  increasing the physiotherapy workforce.” The AI-clinic is due to be rolled out
  across more NHS trusts across England, according to Flok Health. Mike
  Passfield, the deputy director from Cambridge Community Services NHS trust,
  said: “We’re proud to have been the first NHS organisation in England to
  deploy Flok Health’s AI-powered physiotherapy clinic at scale. “This pilot has
  demonstrated how innovation, when safely and thoughtfully integrated into NHS
  pathways, can dramatically improve access, outcomes and patient experience. We
  look forward to working with Flok to explore how this service can be scaled
  across our region to benefit even more people.”
