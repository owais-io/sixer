  Oliver Glasner has said he is confident Crystal Palace will win their appeal
  at the court of arbitration for sport this week and be reinstated to play in
  the Europa League. Palace are seeking to overturn Uefa’s decision to demote
  them to the Conference League for breaking multiclub ownership rules, with the
  appeal to take place in Lausanne on Friday. The decision is expected to be
  revealed by Cas on Monday, the day after Glasner’s FA Cup holders face the
  Premier League champions Liverpool in the Community Shield at Wembley. “We
  don’t have any influence on the decision from Uefa, we don’t have any
  influence on the decision from Cas, so it just makes no sense that we’re
  thinking about it,” Glasner told Sky on Tuesday. “We focus on what we have to
  do on the pitch, how to create this spirit in the group, this togetherness,
  this commitment, and this is what we are doing day by day. We’re waiting for
  the final decision, we’re still confident that the appeal will be successful
  and that we will play in the Europa League. But in the end, on 11 August, we
  will know the final decision – then we will start to prepare for Europe.”
  Palace – who confirmed last month that the New York Jets owner, Woody Johnson,
  completed his purchase of John Textor’s 43% stake – are understood to believe
  they have a strong chance of winning the appeal. They are expected to present
  evidence that they insist proves Uefa’s deadline to change their ownership
  structure so they complied with its rules was not 1 March but rather 30 April,
  as well as pointing out that Textor’s departure has removed the barrier to
  their participation. The American still owns the French club Lyon, who have
  also qualified for the coming season’s Europa League. It is understood that
  Textor will not be part of the Palace delegation that travels to Switzerland
  for the Cas hearing. Nottingham Forest, who qualified for the Conference
  League after finishing seventh in the Premier League, would stand to be
  promoted to the Europa League if Palace’s appeal fails. On Monday, Palace were
  drawn to play against the losers of the Europa League qualifier between
  Norway’s Fredrikstad or Midtjylland of Denmark in the Conference League
  playoffs, with the first leg scheduled to take place at Selhurst Park on 21
  August. An article on the club’s official website detailing their potential
  opponents was deleted not long after being published, while Palace’s X account
  also removed a message about the draw.
