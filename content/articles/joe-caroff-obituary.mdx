  When he was asked to create a logo for the first James Bond film, Dr No, in
  1962, the graphic designer Joe Caroff noticed that the stem of the last digit
  of 007 resembled the butt of a Walther PPK pistol. So Caroff, who has died
  aged 103, united the secret agent’s service number and weapon into an
  unmistakable insignia; its sinuous, italicised tilt conveyed glamour and
  peril. He was paid a piffling $300 for what was initially intended for use on
  company letterheads, but went on to become a piece of branding as instantly
  recognisable as the first bars of John Barry’s theme tune. Caroff felt that
  later reworkings of the logo were inferior. “Maybe my ego was bruised, but I
  never thought they looked as good as the one that I did,” he later said. The
  prolific Caroff was in a constant quest for the economy of expression he hit
  for Bond. He exercised his licence to distil on hundreds of film posters,
  album covers for Decca Records, and logos and other corporate livery for ABC,
  Orion Film and the New York Racing Association, among others. Caroff’s film
  work was less fixedly abstract than his contemporary Saul Bass, to whom
  Caroff’s famous fire-escape poster for West Side Story (1961) has often been
  misattributed (Bass created the film’s title sequence). Caroff often worked in
  figurative elements to more markedly emotional effect: rowdy gunfighter
  collages for his posters for A Fistful of Dollars (1964) and A Few Dollars
  More (1965); a cavorting Liza Minnelli atop a playful vertical title in the
  one-sheet for Cabaret (1972); Marlon Brando, lying under florid lettering, in
  the decadent and wistful publicity for Last Tango in Paris (1972). Although he
  was not paid royalties for his 007 logo, Caroff later pressed Eon Productions
  to be credited for it – but they never responded. It was an exceptional
  request for recognition by a craftsman who had no business card, kept no
  archives, and almost never signed his work, seeing it as merely service
  provision. The German art director and historian Thilo von Debschitz rescued
  Caroff from obscurity, by publishing a series of articles about his work for
  the latter’s centenary in graphic design magazines in 2021. Perhaps anonymity
  had let Caroff sublimate his ego into the purity of his work. He generally
  refused to present clients with different options to choose from, working
  through iterations himself until he had what he considered the definitive
  version. He called this labour “the annihilation of the extraneous”. Born in
  Linden, New Jersey, he was the son of Jewish immigrants from Belarus in
  eastern Europe: Julius Caroff, a house painter, and his wife Fanny (nee Sack),
  a housewife, who also looked after Joe’s four older sisters and his younger
  brother. Art claimed him young: aged four, Joe redecorated his white summer
  suit with a watercolour set a friend had brought over. Later, while studying
  at the Arts high school in Newark, he clashed with his traditionalist father
  about the avant-gardism soon to transform American aesthetics. Caroff recalled
  showing Julius an oil painting of a stylised cubist apple he had made: “My
  father took one long look at it and said, ‘Is this the way you paint an
  apple?’ I tried to explain that we were trying to discover other ways to say
  the same thing. I went on for a half-hour, but my father wouldn’t accept it.”
  He graduated in advertising design from Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, in 1942;
  during his course, he served as assistant in the Manhattan office of the
  French graphic designer Jean Carlu. A cubism-influenced artist who had lost
  his dominant right arm in a trolleybus accident and learned to draw with his
  left, Carlu taught Caroff that their trade was rooted as much in conceptual
  clarity as manual skill. Five days after marrying Phyllis Friedman – whom he
  met at a New Year’s Eve dance – Caroff went to Europe in 1943 to serve with
  the Eighth Army Air Force. Discharged as sergeant after the second world war,
  he quickly went into business as a freelance. Summing up the chaos of combat
  in a tangled scrawl of a soldier’s face for the front cover of Norman Mailer’s
  1948 debut novel The Naked and the Dead was Caroff’s first big coup. By 1965,
  he was managing 22 staff at his own firm, J Caroff Associates – handling
  multiple film commissions at a time. As well as tight formalism, he often
  displayed a playful touch befitting the pop-art era: as with the guitar neck
  tied in a knot on the poster for the Beatles’ A Hard Day’s Night (1964). A
  longstanding client was Woody Allen, for whom Caroff devised a dozen posters,
  including the title as a skyscraping skyline for Manhattan (1979) and a
  cascade of candy-coloured fonts for the shapeshifting mockumentary Zelig
  (1983). This typified his fondness for entwining lettering with concepts, and
  in doing so have concepts speak more loudly: a trick he repeated on the
  artwork for The Great Train Robbery (1978). The poster for the 1981 erotic
  thriller Tattoo, which displayed a naked women with bound ankles, attracted
  attention but aroused the ire of feminists. Regularly torn down in subway
  stations, it caused its director Joseph E Levine to remark to Caroff: “You
  made out with your fucking poster better than I made out with my fucking
  movie.” The designer managed to avoid similar attacks with his work on Martin
  Scorsese’s controversial The Last Temptation of Christ (1988) – which made
  foreboding red and black abstraction of the crown of thorns. Scorsese was so
  pleased with the design, he used it in the title sequence; Caroff had
  previously done opening titles for A Bridge Too Far (1977), Death of a
  Salesman (1985) and Brighton Beach Memoirs (1986). Caroff retired in 2006 to
  devote himself to painting. He and Phyllis continued to sponsor students
  seeking scholarships at the Hunter College School of Social Work, where she
  was a longstanding professor; she died in February this year. He had one tip
  for anyone chasing the instantly iconic: embrace spontaneity. “I found if the
  treatment didn’t pop up pretty quickly, then it’s not going to,” he said.
  “Standing and slaving over it does not work – so that’s when I absolutely get
  away from my desk.” Caroff is survived by his sons, Peter and Michael, and
  granddaughter, Jennifer. • Joseph Caroff, graphic designer, born 18 August
  1921; died 17 August 2025
