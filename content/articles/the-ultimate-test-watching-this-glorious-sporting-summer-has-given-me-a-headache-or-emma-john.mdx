  The ultimate test: watching this glorious sporting summer has given me a

  There is a crick in my neck, a rick in my back, and a permanent ache behind my
  eyes. A friend refuses to offer sympathy. “You did this to yourself,” she says
  as I pop paracetamol. Thousands of hours of medical research are ploughed into
  elite sport, but where are the studies into the physical and mental demands of
  keeping up with it? While winter may be fiercely programmed, it’s the
  multi-disciplinary bunfight of summer that is the ultimate test of a sports
  fan. Right when our diaries demand we’re at our most sociable, our most
  available, our most outdoors, the calendar loses all sense of perspective and
  dumps events on us like it’s trying to save them from a burning building. We
  stand below, arms hopelessly full, desperately trying not to drop anything.
  The past fortnight has offered a pair of excellent, if contrasting, case
  studies. The first was the weekend of the Euros final; also the Lions’ crucial
  second Test against Australia and England’s critical fourth Test against
  India; also, my Norfolk friends’ silver wedding anniversary. They couldn’t
  have known, when they married 25 years ago, that their celebrations would
  clash with multiple major sporting events, but they wouldn’t have cared
  either: Nigel and Claire loathe sports, and don’t own a TV. A better person
  might have respected their life choices; a true friend would have left their
  phone behind on the scheduled Saturday morning beach walk. My screen glowed
  like a tell-tale heart in my jacket pocket, one hand clutched around its
  silent stream of rugby union content. If humans were more advanced life forms,
  the information could have beamed up my arm direct to my optical cortex;
  instead, I had to keep stopping to roll up my trousers, take off my shoes,
  marvel at the view, and any other excuse to sneak a look at the screen. When
  the Lions were back within two points, I made my own 99 call: a tactical
  ice-cream purchase that allowed me to backmark the group and risk turning up
  the volume. It was low tide on the north Norfolk coast, and the 5G had given
  out by the time I was halfway to the water’s edge. The picture was frozen on a
  heavily pixelated scrum at the time I heard the winning try. The return of
  phone signal near the dunes brought the news that India were nought for two in
  the cricket. Extreme circumstances are supposed to reveal your character. In
  my case, all it takes is a weekend in Norfolk with limited data coverage and a
  wifi-less bedroom. I think of myself as both a lover of the countryside and an
  excellent party guest. And yet when push came to shove, I wasted an entire
  afternoon ignoring the giant puffball mushrooms, hovering red kites and
  scuffling hedgerow pheasants around me, instead thumbing fruitlessly at an Old
  Trafford scorecard that refused to update. The Euros final was the trickiest
  moment to negotiate: the anniversary couple had booked us in at a fancy wine
  bar, where the live jazz went on until 6pm. I positioned myself at the end of
  the table next to a football-loving friend, and we only got busted when
  someone moved the ice bucket in front of us and her phone fell over,
  screen-side up, to reveal Lauren James being subbed off. “Is the game going
  well?” someone asked. “No,” we replied. By extra time we were back at the
  house, where we sorry-notsorryed our way into the living room with a laptop.
  The only three of us interested in the historic, nerve-shredding title defence
  tessellated our hips on to a two-person sofa and watched soundless images,
  while the rest of the guests sat opposite making determined conversation over
  our yelps, groans and explosive swears. It was, as someone noted, a room of
  two halves. If you think the above is ridiculous behaviour, firstly, you’re
  not wrong. Secondly, it only got worse last weekend. After the hijinks of
  Norfolk, an entire two days on the sofa with the rugby, cricket and Formula
  One all available on Sky Sports presented itself like a spa break. Instead,
  the endless flicking back and forth – between Bundee Aki’s drops in Sydney,
  Lewis Hamilton’s qualifying woes in Hungary, and England’s rollercoaster ride
  at the Oval – brought on a tension headache so powerful and insistent I had to
  spend half of Sunday in bed, being soothed by the background burble of Test
  Match Special. In truth, I’ve been overdoing it since Wimbledon. It is both
  the blessing and the curse of the modern sporting fan to be able to have what
  we’ve always wanted: all the coverage, all the time. If the thing you love is
  available to you, who but an ingrate would cut themselves off? The ironical
  coda to all this was the knife-edge finish to the England’s Test series on
  Monday morning, right when most of us were back to work. Foolishly, I had
  arranged an unalterable hour-long meeting in the centre of London at 11am, so
  I recorded the game’s climax to watch on delay, and determined to get myself
  home without discovering the score. It took every ounce of concentration to
  fight my own muscle memory and resist the repeated urge to reach for my phone.
  Shuffling my way through the underground, I stared at my shoes like a
  teenager, terrified to look up in case I crossed paths with any fans on their
  way back from the ground. I was only a stop away when the train briefly
  surfaced and I heard the ping of a text. I’ve never understood, before, why
  Orpheus checked on Eurydice. Suddenly there I was, acting on instinct, fatally
  turning my head. “2-2 the only fair result!” my eyes took in, as the train
  plunged back into a tunnel. Oh well. Maybe it was time for an intervention.
  These last two weeks have not been good for me.
