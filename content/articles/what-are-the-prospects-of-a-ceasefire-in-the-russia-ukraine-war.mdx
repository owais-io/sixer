  For six months Donald Trump has been calling for a ceasefire in Ukraine. His
  position abruptly changed after his summit last week with Vladimir Putin in
  Alaska. The US now supports a final settlement of the war first, which is
  Russia’s negotiating position. What changed? And where does Trump’s latest
  flip-flop leave prospects for an end to the fighting? How did Trump’s view on
  a ceasefire in Ukraine change? Since spring the White House has been urging
  Russia to accept a ceasefire in Ukraine. As Donald Trump put it in March: “I
  think the ceasefire is very important. If we can get Russia to do it, that’ll
  be great.” The US president threatened to impose sanctions on Moscow, and on
  buyers of its oil such as India, if it refused. He gave various deadlines,
  which came and went. Until last week the US continued its demand for a 30-day
  pause in the fighting, to which Kyiv agreed. Speaking on his plane to Alaska
  on Friday, before a meeting with Putin, Trump repeated his demand. There would
  be “severe consequences” if a ceasefire didn’t happen. “I’m not going to be
  happy,” he said. The US president’s position dramatically shifted after
  meeting Putin. Exactly why is uncertain. But in the face of Russian
  opposition, Trump dropped his call for a ceasefire and instead embraced the
  Kremlin’s preferred “plan” to end the war. This envisages a comprehensive
  peace settlement first. Until that happens, Moscow will carry on bombing.
  Trump also agreed to Russia’s territorial claims. Putin wants Ukraine to cede
  the northern part of Donetsk oblast – including the fortress cities of
  Kramatorsk and Sloviansk – which Russian troops have been unable to conquer
  since 2014. By way of a so-called concession, Russia reportedly said it would
  freeze the frontlines in southern Zaporizhzhia and Kherson provinces. The
  change in US policy on a Ukraine ceasefire was the summit’s most significant
  outcome. It amounts to a major concession to the Russians. In his meeting on
  Monday with Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, Trump explained his new
  way of thinking. He said there was no need for a truce and claimed he had
  ended six conflicts without one. “I didn’t do any ceasefire,” he said. He said
  he would still “like them [the Russians] to stop” but said a pause in
  hostilities might disadvantage “one side or the other”. What is the Russian
  position? Russia wants to continue its war. Over the summer Russian troops
  have seized villages in the Donbas, and have entered the Dnipropetrovsk region
  – which borders Donetsk oblast – for the first time. Russia’s progress is
  gradual and achieved with heavy casualties. Putin believes he is winning and
  that time is on his side. His maximalist demands are unchanged since the 2022
  invasion. He wants Zelenskyy removed, severe limits put on the size of
  Ukraine’s army, and a veto on its Nato membership. Any ceasefire would in
  effect divide territory along the existing 1,000km frontline. A permanent
  peace plan, by contrast, could involve one side giving land to the other as
  part of a deal. Putin’s conditions are unacceptable to Kyiv, and amount to
  Ukraine’s surrender. Ukrainians believe he is using Trump to take what Russian
  forces have been unable to capture on the battlefield – with DC the quickest
  route to victory in Donetsk. When negotiations fail – the most likely outcome
  in the short term – Putin will inevitably blame Zelenskyy. Where does this
  leave Ukraine and its allies? Frustrated. European leaders have urged Trump to
  put pressure on Russia to agree a ceasefire before any negotiations take
  place. On Monday, they reinforced this message in the White House. Britain’s
  Keir Starmer joined Zelenskyy in Washington, with the leaders of France,
  Germany, Italy and Finland, Nato and the EU. Their task was to protect
  Zelenskyy – in the end his meeting with Trump went better than the last
  encounter in February – and to tactfully convey Ukraine and Europe’s
  principled anti-landgrab position. The Europeans are opposed to any deal that
  would reward Russian aggression. Germany’s chancellor, Friedrich Merz,
  expressed his support for a ceasefire. “Let’s work on that and let’s try to
  put pressure on Russia,” the German leader told Trump. France’s president,
  Emmanuel Macron, said European governments would eventually need to be
  included in any peace talks. After Trump’s unexplained U-turn, Ukraine’s EU
  allies are using a new formula to try to win him over to the idea of a
  ceasefire – “stop the killing”. What does history tell us? Wars can stop
  without formal peace treaties. In 1953 an armistice ended the war between
  North and South Korea. It established a demilitarised zone between the two
  states, the DMZ, dividing the peninsula. Military commanders from the US,
  China and North Korea signed the deal. South Korea’s leader refused, because
  it left Korea split. Technically, the two Koreas are still in a state of war.
  The ceasefire, though, has lasted more than eight decades, despite breaches by
  Pyongyang. This model could work in Ukraine. No Ukrainian government is likely
  to accept Russian occupation over parts of its territory. But it might be
  prepared to acknowledge the Kremlin’s de facto control as part of temporary
  settlement. Putin, however, is against the idea of a Korea-style armistice.
  His goal is to subjugate Ukraine – all of it, or as much as he can get – and
  to fold it into a reinvigorated greater Russia.
