  Emigration ripped the heart out of Charlestown: generations of young people
  took the boat to England and left behind derelict homes and shuttered shops, a
  hollowing chronicled in a landmark 1968 book, The Death of an Irish Town. Some
  returned to this corner of County Mayo for summer holidays – with children who
  were growing up with English accents and city ways – before vanishing back
  across the Irish Sea and leaving Charlestown to its decay. For those who
  stayed, this melancholy history may be a reason to look back in anger, but
  this week at least brings a measure of consolation – and pride – in the form
  of Oasis. Liam and Noel Gallagher will perform in Dublin this weekend and in
  the process are expected to remind Ireland, and global fans, that they are
  part of the Irish diaspora and that Charlestown is akin to a spiritual home.
  “We’re very, very proud of our association with the boys,” said John Casey, a
  renowned Gaelic footballer and resident who has befriended the Gallagher
  brothers. “They were frequent visitors here before and after fame found its
  way with them.” The musicians were born in and grew up in Manchester but their
  mother, Peggy, used to drag them “by the ear” to spend summer holidays with
  her relatives in Mayo, Noel recalled in a 1996 RTÉ interview. “We had never
  seen the likes of nettles, fields and stacks of hay and all that, so she was
  determined to give us a bit of Irish culture, and it was a bit of a culture
  shock but we grew to love it and we still do.” According to lore, the young
  visitors assured sceptical locals that one day they would be famous. After
  becoming emblems of Cool Britannia in the mid-1990s they continued to visit
  their grandmother Margaret Sweeney, until she died in 2000, to socialise in
  pubs and, in the case of Liam, go for runs and hikes, including up Croagh
  Patrick, a Catholic pilgrimage site. “It was cloudy, we couldn’t see much, but
  he loved it,” said Casey, who accompanied the singer up the peak. When either
  brother entered a pub, word sometimes spread and drew busloads of fans from
  around the area, said Casey. “It was my first experience of craziness. But
  mostly we tried to let them be, to not let them be bugged or bothered.”
  Charlestown mourned when Oasis broke up in 2009 and it celebrated last year’s
  announcement of a reunion tour, which moves to Dublin’s Croke Park stadium
  this Saturday and Sunday. “There were a lot of relieved human beings around
  here when we heard they were rekindling things,” Casey said. Over the years
  the Gallaghers were photographed in pubs, and somebody uploaded a video of
  Liam joining a traditional music session at his local, JJ Finan’s, but what
  won over the locals was a low-key normality at odds with the brothers’
  hell-raising image in England. “There was no guitar-smashing and they always
  made time to chat to staff,” said Donal Healy, a marketing manager for Ireland
  West airport, also known as Knock, just outside Charlestown. Healy’s
  journalist uncle John Healy wrote the book The Death of an Irish Town, also
  known as No One Shouted Stop!, that chronicled his native town’s calamitous
  decline. That decline was part of a wider phenomenon across rural Ireland, but
  the local and national population has rebounded since the economy took off in
  the mid-1990s. The title paraphrases an interviewee in the book who said that
  no part of Irish society stood up to say that mass emigration was not
  inevitable. The poverty of the 1960s that drove a teenage Peggy Sweeney to
  seek work in Manchester – where she married another Irish emigrant, Tommy
  Gallagher – is no more, said Donal Healy. “For Charlestown it’s nearly come
  full circle, the fact that we have this connection with the family. We’re in
  the news for the right reason.” Excitement is growing as the concerts
  approach. Radio stations fill their airwaves with Oasis songs and speculation
  about whether the brothers will make a surprise visit to the town. A football
  team sang Oasis hits in the town square and a cafe put “Oasis soup” on the
  menu with the tagline “you get a roll with it” – a reference to their 1995
  hit. “People are coming to the town just because of the connection,” said
  Karena Finn, who showed a photograph of Liam with his son during a visit to
  her family’s pub, Johnny’s Bar, several years ago. A customer named Anne, an
  emigrant back in Ireland on holiday, lauded the Gallaghers for nourishing
  their ties to Ireland. “For all the faults they might have,” she said, “they
  never forgot their roots.”
