  Raymond Antrobus is not the first poet in his family: on his mother’s side, he
  is descended from Thomas Gray, whose most famous poem, Elegy Written in a
  Country Churchyard (1751), is filled with sounds – lowing cows, the droning of
  a beetle in flight, twittering swallows and a crowing cock among them. These
  are the noises that, if he’s not wearing hearing aids, might escape Antrobus,
  who was born with what he often characterises as “missing sound” in the upper
  and lower registers: a whistling kettle or a doorbell disappears at one end,
  while at the other, syllables might get elided, rendering, for example,
  “suspicious” as “spacious” – words with problematically different meanings. If
  this idea of a continuum of sound seems straightforward, as Antrobus points
  out in this compact, powerful exploration of his experience, it is often hard
  to explain to those who understand deafness as an inability to hear anything.
  Many imagine deaf people existing entirely in silence, cut off from
  communication with the hearing world except through lip-reading, sign language
  and equipment. For Antrobus, this aspect of “audism” can be as effortful to
  navigate as conversations and soundscapes in which he uses practised
  strategies to compensate for what his ears do not pick up. Hearing loss is not
  the only context in which he is expected to adapt to others’ version of the
  world. Visiting the Cheshire village of Antrobus – its name derived from the
  Norman-French “entre-bois”, or “between woods”– he meets a farmer who assumes,
  because of the colour of his skin, that he is descended from a slave-owning
  baronet, although it is his mother’s family who bears the name rather than his
  Jamaican-born father’s. The encounter ends with him standing in a country
  churchyard with thoughts of the English working-classes and the enslaved
  plantation workers “turning, churning, burning, all of it inside the blood
  pumping in my ears”. It joins a long line of moments in which his identity as
  a mixed Black British person with a disability that is not always easy to
  define is subject to projection and appropriation. Antrobus interlaces
  episodes from his own life with accounts of pioneering teachers of the deaf,
  and of artists such as poet David Wright, who lost his hearing as a child and
  who, Antrobus believes, internalised his parents’ anxieties and consequently
  lived his life with a degree of shame he finds it easy to recognise. As a
  child, Antrobus often wished away his deafness and kept capital-D Deaf culture
  at arm’s length, leaving off his hearing aids and throwing himself into
  activities such as competitive swimming, in which his hearing peers would also
  find themselves in a world of distorted sound. In the Deaf community, he
  discovered, he could feel not deaf enough; in the hearing world, he could just
  about pass if he didn’t use the sign language that he caught other students
  mocking as his deaf schoolmates walked to class. At anger-management classes,
  he listened to his mother’s stories about his episodes of frustrated lashing
  out and heard them “less like someone trying to have an open conversation and
  more like an attack, an accusation, and the fury that was erupting in my
  teenage brain felt wrong, a source of my own shame”. As his mother attempted
  to help, his father, Seymour, bought him a punchbag; Antrobus hit it so hard,
  he sprained his wrist. Antrobus is understandably wary of salvation
  narratives, and his introduction to the world of poetry is also presented as
  difficult. At spoken-word nights, he would have to position himself carefully
  so as not be overwhelmed by creaking staircases or applause, and, as an
  audience member, was once agonisingly singled out by a poet for vocalising his
  own appreciation too loudly. Nonetheless, he began to realise that poetry
  “held and honoured many of my own burdens and truths” and, perhaps most
  significantly, gave him a way to integrate his experiences and identities with
  one another. What emerges most consistently from this moving book is his need
  to be met on his own terms, in a territory that he is given the freedom to map
  for himself. is published by W&amp;N (£16.99). To support the Guardian order
