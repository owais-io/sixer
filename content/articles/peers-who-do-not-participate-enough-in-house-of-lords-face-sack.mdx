  Labour plans to remove peers who do not contribute enough to the House of
  Lords and to press ahead with plans for a retirement age of 80 from the upper
  house. Writing for the Telegraph, the leader of the House of Lords, Angela
  Smith, said a select committee would consider the next stage of Lords reform
  after the abolition of hereditary peers. Lady Smith said that removing the
  last hereditary peers was “by no means the limit of the government’s Lords
  reform ambitions” but said the new committee would consider carefully how the
  next phase would work. The final stages of the bill, which will abolish the
  seats for the 86 remaining hereditary peers, will go through parliament this
  year. “The introduction of a mandatory retirement age for peers and a
  participation requirement are both clear among our stage-two manifesto
  commitments,” Smith said in her article, but said there should be a
  “collaborative way forward”. The committee will be made up of cross-party
  peers and consider ways to implement the retirement age and the measure of
  participation which will be required. She wrote: “Most peers agree the current
  membership is too high and that there are those who rarely attend. The
  committee will, in turn, be able to look at what might be done with or without
  legislation. I hope the select committee will also anticipate any unintended
  consequences.” But she suggested that a pure measure of speaking contributions
  would not be a fair way of considering participation overall. “Those who
  regularly contribute to the work of the Lords have a clear feel for what this
  might be. It would recognise contributions in the main chamber as well as the
  solid, often unnoticed, work done in our impressive system of committees – but
  it is hard to quantify,” she said. Smith said the implementation of a
  retirement age would “avoid any possible cliff-edge moment”. “Most peers do
  not want these issues kicked into the long grass, and I am keen to see if we
  can act more quickly to bring about the necessary and important changes that
  this government is set on delivering. I am proud of the work of the Lords,”
  she wrote. “At its best, it plays a vital role in our constitution as a
  scrutinising and revising chamber; and we need to ensure that we fulfil that
  responsibility in order to deliver effectively for the people of this country.
  But like all such institutions, ongoing improvements and considered reform
  must ensure it remains fit for purpose and provides for those we serve.”
