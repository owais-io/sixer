  Bruce Lehrmann’s appeal of Justice Michael Lee’s April 2024 defamation
  judgement wrapped up on Thursday, one day short of the three days which had
  been set down to hear it. It was an abrupt end to a high-profile four-year
  legal battle over Network Ten’s interview with Brittany Higgins on The Project
  on 15 February 2021. The justices have reserved their decision on whether to
  overturn Lee’s finding that the former Liberal staffer was not defamed by Lisa
  Wilkinson and Network 10 when they alleged Higgins was raped in Parliament
  House. The abrupt ending to the trial was not the only surprise which played
  out on Wednesday and Thursday in a Sydney courtroom. Despite the nation’s two
  most accomplished defamation barristers, Dr Matt Collins KC and Sue
  Chrysanthou SC, appearing for the respondents, all the attention was on
  Lehrmann’s lawyer Zali Burrows. She is a well-known criminal defence lawyer
  but has no experience in defamation law and has not been admitted to the bar.
  So she seemed to struggle at times to present complex legal arguments before
  the full bench of the federal court, justices Michael Wigney, Craig Colvin and
  Wendy Abraham. “I’m just going to try and do the best I can,” Burrows said
  after apologising for her client’s failure to retain a silk. Despite briefing
  Guy Reynolds SC, and delaying the trial by six months to accomodate his
  schedule, Lehrmann “couldn’t afford” him and Burrows had to press on alone.
  The written submissions had been lodged back in March, presumably with the
  assistance of Reynolds, but now the four grounds of appeal had to be
  articulated in verbal submissions. The justices were unfailingly polite,
  making allowances and taking time to explain law and procedure. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email The uneven match between the parties produced some
  extraordinary courtroom scenes, all broadcast on the federal court’s YouTube
  channel. Here are five key moments. ‘Astonishing submission’ Arguing that
  Lehrmann was denied procedural fairness and natural justice because Lee came
  up with “his own version” of how the alleged rape occurred, Burrows faced a
  sceptical bench. “I don’t understand the logic of this submission,” Colvin
  said. “You need to explain why it is a different case. “It is all very well to
  say these things out loud, but you need to explain why this is a different
  case.” Burrows claimed Ten reported a “forceful” rape whereas Lee found a
  “soft rape”. “It was asserted against Mr Lehrmann … that he violently raped,
  that it was done in a violent nature,” she said. “Whereas His Honour found a
  totally different case as if it was, using the phrase, a soft rape.” Colvin:
  “I’m not sure he found a non-violent rape, and I’m not sure that’s a concept I
  understand.” Much of the time over the two days was taken up with this
  argument, which was dismissed by Ten’s silk Collins as “misconceived” and “a
  distraction, in our respectful submission”. Collins said it was an
  “astonishing submission” that Lehrmann’s evidence might have been different if
  he had been given the chance to respond to questions about a “non-violent
  rape”. Wigney asked how Lehrmann would have answered questions differently
  when he had consistently maintained no sexual intercourse took place. She
  repeated that Lehmann did not get an opportunity to answer differently.
  Lehrmann as the ‘victim’ One thing Burrows was good at was presenting Lehrmann
  as a victim. She asked the court to substantially increase his damages should
  he win on appeal because he has been vilified in traditional and social media.
  “He’s pretty much become the national joke … Australia’s most hated man,”
  Burrows said. She bemoaned the fact that when he left court “no one in the
  back of the court or any of the reporters downstairs are going to have
  anything nice to say to him and not even ask, ‘Are you OK?’.” Colvin cut her
  off: “Is this a speech or is this a submission?” ‘I need more time’ Burrows
  asked the bench on multiple occasions to adjourn so she could have more time
  to prepare her own submissions. They refused every time. Wigney said Burrows
  had already “obtained the court’s indulgence” to commence her reply to
  submissions a day later than scheduled, and she should start her response. “If
  I can put it this way, nothing that has occurred this morning has impacted, or
  could impact, on your ability to reply to those matters,” Wigney said. After
  another request Burrows was told to “start now” and reminded she had “more
  time over lunch” to sort out any issues. She made a final bid for more time at
  the end of the day, asking if she could finish her submissions early and come
  back on Friday. “There are further documents I prepared but I’m embarrassed to
  say they’re not here. Can we finish early and resume tomorrow morning?” she
  asked. Wigney replied: “I don’t think so, I think we need to resume [now].”
  ‘It’s your appeal’ When Burrows asked for a clarification of a question from
  Colvin about a challenge to the underlying findings, Wigney appeared
  perplexed. “It seems to me to be a very important and central issue for your
  appeal,” Wigney said. “It’s your appeal. What are the … do you understand the
  reference to the underlying facts?” Wigney said Burrows had been in possession
  of Ten’s written submissions “for some time, quite clearly”, and they list the
  underlying facts “in quite simple terms”. “So you’ve had plenty of opportunity
  to consider this issue,” he said. No reply to notice of contention While
  Burrows did address the matters in the appeal proper, she had little to say
  about Ten and Wilkinson’s extensive challenges of Lee’s judgement. Ten said
  Lee was wrong to find Lehrmann was reckless to consent for sex, based on how
  intoxicated Higgins was. Wilkinson argued Lee erred when he found Wilkinson’s
  team failed in their defence of qualified privilege, known as section 30. They
  argued Lee should have found that “an intentional rape” had taken place,
  instead of finding that there was no evidence Lehrmann knew that Higgins did
  not consent to the sexual activity. Chrysanthou sought to overturn Lee’s
  decision on Wilkinson’s qualified privilege defence, arguing her client acted
  reasonably in preparation of the program. “It was always our case at trial
  that Ms Wilkinson should have succeeded in this defence, but also so should
  have Network Ten,” Chrysanthou said. But after hours of submissions that
  detailed where Wilkinson believed Lee had made errors, Burrows had no reply to
  Collins or Chrysanthou. Wigney prompted Burrows to answer before he wrapped
  up, saying “the compelling inference is that your client was not merely
  reckless but knew that Ms Higgins was not consenting”. “Now, you haven’t
  addressed that at all. It’s detailed written submissions have been made in
  relation to it and, oral submissions. Is there… anything you want to put to us
  in relation to that?” Burrows never took up the offer.
