  Almost half of the 6 million people needing treatment from the NHS in England
  have had no further care at all since joining a hospital waiting list, new
  data reveals. Previously unseen NHS England figures show that 2.99 million of
  the 6.23 million patients (48%) awaiting care have not had either their first
  appointment with a specialist or a diagnostic test since being referred by a
  GP. The Patients Association described the situation as “an invisible waiting
  list crisis” that was “staggering” in scale, with millions living in limbo,
  anxious as their health deteriorates. The data raises doubts about Keir
  Starmer’s repeated pledge that 92% of patients will be treated within 18 weeks
  of referral by 2029 – his key promise to voters on health. The target has not
  been hit since 2015, and in May just 61% were treated on time. In a further
  sign of how difficult it will be to meet that target, the data shows that a
  third of the 3 million unseen patients – 1 million people – have already
  waited more than 18 weeks without receiving any care. It is the first time the
  phenomenon of “unseen patients” has emerged as part of the huge challenge
  facing the government in its drive to “get the NHS back on its feet”. Until
  now debate around the NHS backlog has focused on the number of treatments
  patients are due to receive and how many are waiting – currently 7.36m and
  6.23m respectively. “If accurate, 3 million people are trapped in an invisible
  waiting list crisis, stuck without basic diagnostic tests of first
  appointments while their conditions worsen,” said Rachel Power, the chief
  executive of the Patients Association. “The scale is staggering, as nearly
  half of all patients on a waiting list haven’t been seen by anyone. That’s not
  a healthcare service; that’s a breakdown. “These aren’t just statistics.
  They’re people checking their phones daily for hospital calls that never come,
  unable to plan their lives while their symptoms deteriorate.” The figures have
  been collated and analysed by the health data specialist MBI Health, which
  helps dozens of NHS trusts improve their treatment waiting times. It has
  shared its findings with the Guardian. Barry Mulholland, the firm’s founder
  and a former NHS manager, said the health service should see the waiting list
  as “a frontlog, not a backlog”, because so many people had not had their
  “first clinical contact” after joining it. In recent years ministers and NHS
  bosses have made reducing the number of people waiting 12 or 18 months for
  care their priority. “There are so many people who have already waited so long
  without seeing anyone – 3 million unseen patients who haven’t had their first
  contact. “Unless that’s dealt with, you will never achieve that target of
  seeing and treating patients within 18 weeks. “From the government’s point of
  view, the pledge to get back to 18 weeks by 2029 will be really hard to
  accomplish if this huge group of patients isn’t seen more quickly.” “We’ll
  never clear the waiting list if we don’t fix the point where patients enter
  the system, and long delays begin,” he added. NHS England acknowledged the
  vast number of people who had had no NHS care since joining the waiting list.
  Of the 7.3m treatments patients were waiting for, 4.7m – nearly two-thirds
  (64%) – were for people who had not had a first consultation with a specialist
  or a diagnostic test yet. And 1.6m of this 4.7m had already gone beyond the
  18-week supposed maximum waiting time for treatment, it added. Alison Bennett,
  a Liberal Democrat health spokesperson, said: “These figures are harrowing.
  Behind every one of these numbers is a person in pain, anxious about their
  health, and desperately waiting for their first contact from a clinician.
  “This isn’t a problem that appeared overnight; it’s the direct result of the
  Conservative party mismanaging our NHS for years. It is unacceptable that
  millions of people are still being left in a state of limbo, while their
  conditions potentially worsen.” Ministers would only “fix” the NHS if they
  overhauled social care to unblock jammed-up hospitals, she added. MBI’s
  analysis also found that the medical specialities with the largest number of
  unseen patients were ear, nose and throat care, orthopaedics, eye care,
  gastroenterology and gynaecology. Between 67% and 75% of those waiting lists
  are made up of such patients, Mulholland added. Dr Tim Cooksley, a former
  president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said: “This data is a further
  illustration of the depth of the crisis that the NHS faces. The uncertainty
  for patients causing psychological strain alongside the physical symptoms of
  their conditions. These numbers reflect a looming disaster for the
  government’s key NHS pledge. “Many people will require emergency care as the
  burden of their symptoms and the uncertainty becomes intolerable. There can be
  no elective recovery without emergency care recovery. The two are dependent
  and need a coherent, co-ordinated approach that focuses on increasing capacity
  and workforce throughout the system. “Continued prolonged waits for elective
  procedures and care will inevitably result in increased strain in emergency
  care with the continuum of patients experiencing the appalling indignity of
  corridor care.” The Department of Health and Social Care did not comment on
  the 3 million unseen patients. A spokesperson said only that: “Thanks to this
  government’s record investment, reforms and the hard work of NHS staff, we’ve
  cut the waiting list by over 260,000 since July 2024, which also fell for the
  first time in 17 years in April and May outside the pandemic. On top of this,
  we have also delivered 4.6m appointments – more than double the 2m we
  promised. “This government is delivering the fundamental reform needed to turn
  our NHS around, and our 10-year health plan will build on this progress, to
  ensure we meet our target that 92% of patients wait no longer than 18 weeks
  for treatment by March 2029.” Mulholland concluded: “If we refocus on access
  to the first contact for those patients in limbo – and ensure high-quality
  data is captured – we can turn the tide, bringing down the elective list and
  improving the experience of people waiting for treatment.”
