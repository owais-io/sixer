  Good morning. You may have heard a saying along the lines that “when the US
  sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold”. So when the US health
  department announced plans to cut half a billion dollars in vaccine research
  funding on Wednesday, the world took notice. The US is the world’s largest
  funder of biomedical research, but this position has become more precarious
  with the appointment of Robert F Kennedy Jr, a longtime vaccine sceptic, as US
  health secretary. This week, Kennedy has announced plans to terminate 22
  federal contracts for mRNA-based vaccines, casting doubt on the safety of a
  technology widely credited with helping end the Covid-19 pandemic and saving
  millions of lives. In total the affected projects are worth nearly $500m
  (£376m), according to the health agency. As for Kennedy, he said: “We reviewed
  the science, listened to the experts, and acted.” The only problem? The
  scientific community in the US and around the world has overwhelmingly
  condemned the decision. To understand why, for today’s newsletter I spoke to
  Michael Head, a global health researcher at the University of Southampton.
  That’s after the headlines. Five big stories Israel-Gaza war | Benjamin
  Netanyahu’s office said his security cabinet had approved a plan to take over
  Gaza City after the prime minister earlier said Israel planned to take full
  control of the Palestinian territory. The decision early on Friday marks
  another escalation of Israel’s offensive in Gaza. Follow developments live
  Ukraine | Volodymyr Zelenskyy said ahead of an expected meeting between Donald
  Trump and Vladimir Putin that Europe must participate in the peace process
  between Ukraine and Russia. As the Kremlin refused a three-way meeting with
  Zelenskyy and Trump, the Ukrainian president said: “Ukraine is not afraid of
  meetings and expects the same brave approach from the Russian side.” Economy |
  The chancellor and prime minister will begin to foreshadow tax rises and
  reforms from September to prepare the country for a difficult budget that
  could be held in November, the Guardian has been told. A rise in gambling
  levies – advocated by Gordon Brown – is thought to be near-guaranteed as part
  of the package of tax rises. UK news | Amnesty International has warned the
  Met police against arresting participants protesting this Saturday in London
  in support of Palestine Action. Labour | The UK homelessness minister,
  Rushanara Ali, resigned after it emerged she evicted tenants from her east

  ‘The mRNA vaccines saved about 20 million lives’ The first thing to understand
  is that mRNA vaccines work differently from traditional ones. The latter
  generally introduce a weakened or inactivated part of a virus to train the
  immune system to recognise and fight it in the future; whereas mRNA vaccines
  use a molecule that tells our cells how to make a viral protein, which
  triggers the body’s immune responses. This technology is a scientific
  gamechanger, to the extent the researchers behind it won the Nobel prize in
  2023. But since rising to prominence during the Covid pandemic, mRNA vaccines
  have been dogged by misinformation (this analysis by my colleague Nicola Davis
  is well worth a read.) Michael Head tells me that mRNA technology offers a
  very effective and adaptable approach to developing vaccines. “It’s often
  described as plug-and-play because you can adapt constituents of the vaccine
  with, for example, the latest Covid variant.” For something like a flu
  vaccine, researchers need to incubate the virus and grow it, which takes
  weeks, Head explains. “That’s fine to an extent when it comes to producing an
  annual vaccine like we do for seasonal influenza, but the advantage to mRNA
  technology is that it can be updated so quickly that it allows us to produce
  new vaccines or update existing vaccines quicker, which can hopefully then
  reduce the threat of whatever infectious disease is present.” This is crucial
  during a pandemic such as Covid. “The mRNA vaccines saved about 20 million
  lives globally in the first year of their rollout,” Head says. *** Why is
  Kennedy doing this? Kennedy once described mRNA Covid vaccines as “the
  deadliest vaccine ever made”. On Wednesday, he justified the health agency’s
  decision to terminate research by claiming that data shows mRNA vaccines “fail
  to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like Covid and
  flu”. Kennedy offered no scientific evidence to support this – and Head said
  Kennedy has been spreading vaccine misinformation for years. “He has on at
  least one or two occasions compared vaccines to being like the Holocaust, a
  common anti-vaccine trope.” He has also recently falsely claimed vaccines such
  as the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab contain “aborted foetus debris”;
  ordered a sweeping new study on the long-debunked link between vaccines and
  autism; and dismissed a panel of government vaccine experts, replacing them
  with his own appointees – who then voted to ban a longstanding vaccine
  preservative that has been a frequent target of the anti-vaccine movement
  despite its strong safety record. Kennedy claims he is shutting down research
  on mRNA vaccines and instead shifting funding to “safer, broader vaccine
  platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate”, and that mRNA
  vaccines “encourage new mutations and can actually prolong pandemics”. It’s
  just not true, though. Head says variants actually tend to emerge in the
  absence of vaccinations, and in people with long-term infections – often those
  who are immunocompromised and can’t get over the virus quickly. That gives the
  virus more chances to multiply and mutate. “Vaccines reduce the risk of
  transmission and infection,” Head says, which means fewer opportunities for
  the virus to mutate. “So vaccines will have a protective effect against new
  variants emerging, rather than as Kennedy suggests.” *** What impact will this
  have? The question of the next pandemic is not if, but when. History shows
  pandemics happen, Head says, pointing to the 1918 flu pandemic, swine flu,
  Sars, and of course Covid. Head says this is especially true in our era of
  globalisation and human encroachment into new environments. “If you create
  enough opportunities, a new virus will enter human beings. There might be a
  scenario where it runs out of control like we saw with Covid. Or, it might be
  a bit more like Sars, where we were able to get it under control within a
  couple of months. “But again, globalisation and the mixing of people and
  animals makes things more challenging. And so a pandemic will happen at some
  point. We just don’t know when.” Technologies like mRNA vaccines, then, are
  vital. Head added that the potential applications go far beyond infectious
  disease. “There’s quite promising research on skin cancer and the potential
  for this technology to be applied across different areas of health,” Head
  says. That is another reason Kennedy’s decision is so damaging, he adds. One
  of Head’s research areas focuses on how funding decisions impact science such
  as cancer research. “It’s very early days, but we are starting to see a
  slightly alarming picture. It’ll be very hard for the rest of the world to
  fill the cancer research gaps that the US is likely to leave.” *** Is this a
  worrying time for the scientific community? There is no way to sugarcoat it;
  this is a particularly alarming moment for scientists. The World Health
  Organization coined the term “infodemic” during the pandemic to describe the
  overwhelming amount of misinformation that spreads during a public health
  crisis, Head says. Even before Covid, in 2019 the WHO listed vaccine hesitancy
  as one of the top 10 global health threats. “I have huge concerns that if a
  pandemic happened again tomorrow, whether populations in the UK, US, and
  around the world would trust public health decision making that would be vital
  to mitigate the impacts of any new pandemic. So the role of misinformation is
  significant and it can be very severe,” Head warned. “It does not help that
  some of the most powerful people, like US president Donald Trump and Robert F
  Kennedy Jr, are making poor quality comments on vaccination because that does
  have an impact on population level decision making.” Some of Head’s research
  has looked into vaccine uptake in Ghana during the pandemic. The study found
  that political views played a big role in whether someone agreed to receive a
  Covid vaccine. “The government was saying, go and get vaccinated, please, but
  there was a fair amount of anti-government sentiment at the time. And
  hesitancy was greater if you voted for the opposition and therefore trusted
  the government messaging less. So there are lessons to be learned on who
  delivers the messaging to get your vaccine, and how to address that lack of
  trust in governance,” Head said. For now, the world holds its breath … and
  hopes no one sneezes. What else we’ve been reading Patrick Barkham’s piece
  about the recent hopeful surge of some wildlife is both a joyous celebration
  of animals’ resilience and a call for us to give them a helping hand. Lucinda

  that releasing 20 lynx over several years would eventually create a healthy
  population of about 50 animals, bringing benefits like helping to curb the
  overpopulation of deer in woodlands. According to the researchers, Kielder
