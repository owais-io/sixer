  That’s all for tonight. Thanks for following along with us and be sure to
  check back shortly for Tumaini Carayol’s full match report. The
  Errani/Vavassori repeat is something of a rarity in the US Open annals. It’s
  just the fifth time a mixed doubles team has gone back-to-back at the New York
  major and only the second time in four decades. Match tiebreak: Swiatek/Ruud
  6-10 Errani/Vavassori Swiatek wins the second point on her racket for 5-8.
  Then Vavassori slots a volley winner for 9-5 and a bunch of championship
  points. Swiatek and Ruud save the first of them after a heart-pounding rally.
  But a biffed volley by Swiatek hands the Italians the crown! Sara Errani and
  Andrea Vavassori are your US Open mixed doubles champions for the second year
  running, but surely this one is even more special given the symbolic
  underpinnings of the “newly reimagined” format. This one is for doubles
  players everywhere! Match tiebreak: Swiatek/Ruud 4-8 Errani/Vavassori*
  (*denotes next server) Swiatek serving at 4-7 ... and she double-faults for
  4-8! Oh no! That puts her side down a second minibreak. It could prove fatal.
  The crowd buzzes. She will have one more serve after the change of ends. Match
  tiebreak: Swiatek/Ruud 2-4 Errani/Vavassori* (*denotes next server) Ruud gets
  one of the minibreaks back when takes a 69mph first serve by Errani very early
  and pounds it directly at Vavassori, who can’t get it back over. The players
  switch ends with the Italians ahead, just. Match tiebreak: *Swiatek/Ruud 0-4
  Errani/Vavassori (*denotes next server) Ruud nets a forehand early in a rally
  and puts his team immediately down a minibreak. Vavassori takes care of both
  points on his racket. Swiatek sends a backhand flying past the baseline on her
  serve and suddenly they’re down a couple of minibreaks. Swiatek/Ruud break in
  12th game of second set! Second set: Swiatek/Ruud 3-6, 7-5 Errani/Vavassori
  Errani is broken on her serve and we are headed to a match tiebreaker. What a
  comeback by Swiatek and Ruud, who have won 15 of the last 21 points. Notably,
  Errani got all five first serves in during that last game: 70mph, 78mph,
  75mph, 76mph, 76mph. Second set: Swiatek/Ruud 3-6, 6-5 Errani/Vavassori*
  (*denotes next server) Swiatek wins three straight points on her serve, mixes
  in consecutive double faults, then secures the hold when Vavassori frames a
  return. Swiatek/Ruud break in 10th game of second set! Second set:
  *Swiatek/Ruud 3-6, 5-5 Errani/Vavassori (*denotes next server) With Vavassori
  serving at 30-all, Ruud uncorks a sensational forehand winner from behind the
  baseline. A break-point chance for Swiatek and Ruud ... and they convert it
  when Errani nets a forehand volley! Back on serve in the second! Second set:
  Swiatek/Ruud 3-6, 4-5 Errani/Vavassori* (*denotes next server) Ruud holds at
  love and it will be Vavassori looking to close the show for the Italian team
  after the change of ends. Second set: *Swiatek/Ruud 3-6, 3-5 Errani/Vavassori
  (*denotes next server) Errani holds for the Italians and the wildcard team is
  just one game from the finish line before an Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd that’s
  at least 70% full at 11.15pm local time. Errani/Vavassori break in seventh
  game of second set! Second set: Swiatek/Ruud 3-6, 3-4 Errani/Vavassori*
  (*denotes next server) Squeaky-bum time for our Iga. She falls behind love-30,
  then 15-40 and triple break point down on her serve. Ruud saves the first of
  them with an overhand smash early in the rally. But Errani converts on the
  second with a deft volley at the net! Second set: *Swiatek/Ruud 3-6, 3-3
  Errani/Vavassori (*denotes next server) The Italians breeze through enough
  service game on the racket of Vavassori, whose thigh doesn’t seem to be
  bothering him too much after the medical timeout. Second set: Swiatek/Ruud
  3-6, 3-2 Errani/Vavassori* (*denotes next server) Ruud marshals another
  drama-free hold. The No 3 seeds have won 12 of the last 13 points on his
  racket. More treatment for Vavassori from the physio during the changeover.
  And this time it appears they’re asking for a medical timeout with Errani
  having darted off the court and into the tunnel. Second set: *Swiatek/Ruud
  3-6, 2-2 Errani/Vavassori (*denotes next server) Errani, broken in her
  previous service game, bounces back nicely with the comfortable hold. She caps
  it with a 65mph first serve (!) to the body that Ruud can only return into the
  net. Second set: Swiatek/Ruud 3-6, 2-1 Errani/Vavassori* (*denotes next
  server) Swiatek strolls through a confident hold, serving with authority and
  doing her part off the ground from the baseline. Meanwhile, the physio has
  been summoned from the tunnel and has gone to work on Vavassori’s left leg.
  Second set: *Swiatek/Ruud 3-6, 1-1 Errani/Vavassori (*denotes next server) A
  goregeous stab volley by Vavassori closes out another hold from 30-all.
  High-quality two-way action in this one. Second set: Swiatek/Ruud 3-6, 1-0
  Errani/Vavassori* (*denotes next server) Ruud cruises through another love
  hold to get on the board in the second set. First set: Swiatek/Ruud 3-6
  Errani/Vavassori Vavassori wastes no time, cruising to the easy hold to close
  out the first set in 31 minutes. Errani/Vavassori break in eighth game of
  first set! First set: Swiatek/Ruud 3-5 Errani/Vavassori* (*denotes next
  server) Right when Swiatek and Ruud seemed to have wrested the momentum, they
  gift the break right back. With Swiatek serving at 40-15, she makes an
  unforced error off her forehand, followed by a double fault, followed by
  another sprayed forehand. Just brutal. Swiatek/Ruud break in seventh game of
  first set! First set: *Swiatek/Ruud 3-4 Errani/Vavassori (*denotes next
  server) Errani is pushed to 30-all on her serve. The Swiatek smashes a
  backhand return winner to earn a break-point chance before converting it with
  a backhand volley winner. We’re back on serve in the first set! First set:
  Swiatek/Ruud 2-4 Errani/Vavassori* (*denotes next server) Ruud, who’s been
  serving so well all night, holds at love to keep pace with the Italians. First
  set: *Swiatek/Ruud 1-4 Errani/Vavassori (*denotes next server) Another
  brilliant hold by Vavassori, who pounds a couple of aces along the way before
  closing it out with an overhead winner. First set: Swiatek/Ruud 1-3
  Errani/Vavassori* (*denotes next server) Swiatek’s shaky serve is at it again
  as her team goes down 15-30 on her racket. But they rattle off three quick
  points, capped by Iga’s superb backhand passing winner into the corner, to
  escape with the hold and get on the board. First set: *Swiatek/Ruud 0-3
  Errani/Vavassori (*denotes next server) The Italians back up the break with
  ease and they’re halfway to the finish line in this opening set. (Remember: In
  the final, the format reverts to a best-of-three set match with a team needing
  to win six games to clinch the set rather than four.) Errani/Vavassori break
  in second game of first set! First set: Swiatek/Ruud 0-2 Errani/Vavassori*
  (*denotes next server) And the Italians waste no time drawing first blood.
  Ruud falls behind 15-30, then 30-40, and Vavassori pounces with a forehand
  passing winner. First set: *Swiatek/Ruud 0-1 Errani/Vavassori (*denotes next
  server) Vavassori picks up where he left off in the semi-final, strolling
  through a service hold to put his team on the board. The players have taken
  the court for tonight’s final. The defending US Open and reigning French Open
  champions are first through the tunnel. And then it’s Iga Swiatek and Casper
  Ruud, taking their chairs as TI’s Bring Em Out blasts through the arena
  soundsystem. On the line: the princely sum of $1m. Second set:
  Collins/Harrison 2-4, 2-4 Errani/Vavassori Vavassori leaves no doubt, holding
  at love while crunching a 118mph ace along the way. The Italians are through
  to the final, where they will meet Swiatek and Ruud. Errani/Vavassori break in
  fifth game of second set! Second set: Collins/Harrison 2-4, 2-3
  Errani/Vavassori* (*denotes next server) And the Americans give it right back.
  Harrison goes down love-15, then 15-40. Three break points but the Italians
  only need one as Vavassori takes command of a highlight-reel all-court rally.
  Gripping stuff that brings to the crowd to its feet. Vavassori will serve to
  lift his team into the final after the changeover. Collins/Harrison break in
  fourth game of second set! Second set: *Collins/Harrison 2-4, 2-2
  Errani/Vavassori (*denotes next server) Well, well, well. Errani goes down
  love-30, then 30-40, facing a break point for the first time in this
  tournament. And the Americans seize on it, moving back on level terms in the
  second set. Errani/Vavassori break in third game of second set! Second set:
  Collins/Harrison 2-4, 1-2 Errani/Vavassori* (*denotes next server) Just when
  it seemed like the momentum was drifting toward the Americans, Collins is
  broken at love and the Italians are within touching distance of the final.
  Second set: *Collins/Harrison 2-4, 1-1 Errani/Vavassori (*denotes next server)
  Now it’s the Italians who are pushed to a deciding point as Vavassori has
  trouble getting his first serve in. But he delivers at 40-all, pounding a
  126mph service winner that Harrison can scarcely get a racket on. Second set:
  Collins/Harrison 2-4, 1-0 Errani/Vavassori* (*denotes next server) The
  Americans are pushed to 40-all on Harrison’s racket, but Harrison’s bold
  104mph second serve on the deciding point pays off. First set:
  Collins/Harrison 2-4 Errani/Vavassori Vavassori holds at love as the Italians
  waste no time bringing home the opening set in 20 minutes. First set:
  Collins/Harrison 2-3 Errani/Vavassori* (*denotes next server) Harrison goes
  down love-30 on his serve and the Italians are two points from snatching the
  opening set. They fight back for 30-all, but a Harrison double fault then
  gifts a set point to Errani and Vavassori. The Americans save it for 40-all
  and hold when an Errani volley sails wide. First set: *Collins/Harrison 1-3
  Errani/Vavassori (*denotes next server) Errani, who’s been a ball of energy
  from the opening bell, serves her team to the easy cold, capping it with a
  gorgeous forehand passing winner. Harrison will serve to keep the Americans in
  the opening set. First set: Collins/Harrison 1-2 Errani/Vavassori* (*denotes
  next server) The Americans are on the board after Collins serves her way to a
  stress-free hold. First set: *Collins/Harrison 0-2 Errani/Vavassori (*denotes
  next server) Vavassori opens with a double fault, but the Italians win four
  straight points from there to back up the break, including a 120mph ace down
  the middle. Errani/Vavassori break in first game of first set! First set:
  Collins/Harrison 0-1 Errani/Vavassori* (*denotes next server) Errani and
  Vavassori are receiving to start and win a splended all-court rally. They get
  their teeth into the Harrison serve at 15-30, then go triple break point down
  at 15-40. He’s lost all three points to Errani’s return, notably. A nifty
  Errani volley that Collins can’t handle nails down the break. Now it’s time
  for the second semi-final between Danielle Collins/Christian Harrison and Sara
  Errani/Andrea Vavassori. For the defending champions, this event is about more
  than a title defense. They’ve been outspoken critics of the new format, which
  squeezed out many specialist pairs, but their play has been the perfect
  rebuttal. Crisp volleys, impeccable teamwork and a refusal to be intimidated
  by star names have put them back on the brink of another final. A win here
  would be a symbolic statement for doubles players everywhere. Match tiebreak:
  Pegula/Draper 8-10 Swiatek/Ruud Swiatek closes it out with a slice backhand
  winner to cap a magnificent comeback! They won the last six points of the
  tiebreaker to roar back from 4-8 down ... and they’re through to the final
  later tonight! Match tiebreak: Pegula/Draper 8-7 Swiatek/Ruud* (*denotes next
  server) Pegula drops a couple of points on her racket and all of a sudden
  we’re back on serve. Match tiebreak: Pegula/Draper 8-4 Swiatek/Ruud* (*denotes
  next server) Pegula crunches a 109mph ace down the middle, before Ruud answers
  it with a 121mph number out wide. Then Swiatek/Ruud go down a double minibreak
  thanks to a mishit volley. An unforced error by Pegula pulls one of those
  minibreaks back before one by Swiatek keeps that margin. With Swiatek serving
  at 4-7 ... she double-faults! Oh dear. Match tiebreak: *Pegula/Draper 4-2
  Swiatek/Ruud (*denotes next server) Swiatek takes care of business on her
  serve, but her side still trails a minibreak. That margin holds into the
  change of ends after Ruud misfires on a return. Match tiebreak: Pegula/Draper
  3-0 Swiatek/Ruud* (*denotes next server) Dragula snatch the first minibreak
  with a backhand passing winner, then consolate it with a couple of points on
  Draper’s serve for 3-love. Swiatek/Ruud break in eighth game of second set!
  Second set: Pegula/Draper 5-3, 3-5 Swiatek/Ruud Pegula falls behind 15-30 on
  her serve and Swiatek and Ruud are two points from forcing a decider. Ruud
  then smashes a forehand return winner for 15-40 and triple set point. Pegula
  brushes aside the first with a 108mph ace down the middle, but Ruud’s forehand
  settles matters on the next point. We’re headed to a 10-point match
  super-tiebreak to decide the first semi-final. Second set: *Pegula/Draper 5-3,
  3-4 Swiatek/Ruud (*denotes next server) Swiatek, so shaky on her serve all
  night, drills through a love hold. Dragula to serve to force a tiebreaker
  after the changeover. Second set: Pegula/Draper 5-3, 3-3 Swiatek/Ruud*
  (*denotes next server) Draper, who’d dropped only three points on his serve
  all night, plays a few loose points to go 15-40 and triple set point down. Oh
  boy. He erases two of them with powerful first serves that can’t be returned
  into the court. 40-all. And on the third Swiatek nets a forehand early in the
  rally to allow the escape! Second set: *Pegula/Draper 5-3, 2-3 Swiatek/Ruud
  (*denotes next server) A stress-free hold on the racket of Ruud, who’s been
  serving beautifully tonight. Pegula and Draper will serve to stay in the
  second set after the change of ends. Swiatek/Ruud break in fourth game of
  second set! Second set: Pegula/Draper 5-3, 2-2 Swiatek/Ruud* (*denotes next
  server) Signs of life for Swiatek and Ruud after three straight unforced
  errors from their opponents give them a love-40 edge and several chances to
  break right back. And they need only one of them, when a biffed forehand by
  Pegula caps the break at love. Shocker! Pegula/Draper break in third game of
  second set! Second set: *Pegula/Draper 5-3, 2-1 Swiatek/Ruud (*denotes next
  server) Swiatek’s serve continues to betray her as her team goes down love-15,
  then 15-40. After faulting at break point down, her 88mph second serve is
  gobbled up by Draper, whose sizzling backhand winner seals the break. She’s
  been broken in all three of her service games so far tonight. Second set:
  Pegula/Draper 5-3, 1-1 Swiatek/Ruud* (*denotes next server) Straightforward
  hold for Team Dragula. On serve early in the second set. Second set:
  *Pegula/Draper 5-3, 0-1 Swiatek/Ruud (*denotes next server) Another hold
  behind Ruud’s serve. Some high-quality rallies with all four players showing
  off their shotmaking. First set: Pegula/Draper 5-3 Swiatek/Ruud Pegula and
  Draper hold from love-15 down to take the opening set after 37 minutes,
  sealing it when Ruud badly overcooks a return. Pegula/Draper break in seventh
  game of first set! First set: *Pegula/Draper 4-3 Swiatek/Ruud (*denotes next
  server) Swiatek’s serving woes continue as her team goes down love-30, then
  30-40 on her racket. A lengthy video review of an alleged double-bounce ends
  with the point being upheld for Pegula and Draper. From there, the top seeds
  snatch the break. They will serve for the first set after the changeover.
  First set: Pegula/Draper 3-3 Swiatek/Ruud* (*denotes next server) Pegula caps
  a love hold with a sharply angled volley into the tramlines. Still on serve in
  the opener. First set: *Pegula/Draper 2-3 Swiatek/Ruud (*denotes next server)
  A comfortable hold for Swiatek and Ruud. Draper will serve to keep his team in
  the opening set after the change of ends. Swiatek/Ruud break in fourth game of
  first set! First set: Pegula/Draper 2-2 Swiatek/Ruud* (*denotes next server)
  Swiatek and Ruud immediately break back, benefitting from a patch of
  error-strewn play on the Pegula/Draper side. Back on serve in the opening set.
  Pegula/Draper break in third game of first set! First set: *Pegula/Draper 2-1
  Swiatek/Ruud (*denotes next server) Swiatek and Ruud go down love-15 then
  15-40 on Swiatek’s serve. A couple of break-point chances for Pegula and
  Draper. They save the first, then the second. But a wicked backhand by Pegula
  forces an error at 40-all and seizes the early break for the No 1 seeds. It’s
  the first time either of these teams have been broken in the tournament. First
  set: Pegula/Draper 1-1 Swiatek/Ruud* (*denotes next server) Pegula and Draper
  are pushed to 30-all on their opening service game, but Draper responds with a
  107mph ace down the middle followed by a 103mph first serve out wide that Ruud
  can’t return into the court. First set: *Pegula/Draper 0-1 Swiatek/Ruud
  (*denotes next server) After winning the first two points on Ruud’s serve, the
  Norwegian makes three straight unforced errors off his forehand side to go
  break point down. But they quickly brush it aside and nail down the hold with
  an overhand smash winner. The top seeds against the No 3 seeds pits two of the
  most intriguing scratch partnerships against each other. Pegula’s steadiness
  and Draper’s net aggression carried them smoothly through Tuesday, highlighted
  by their dismantling of Raducanu and Alcaraz. But Swiatek and Ruud, fresh off
  a late-night dash from Cincinnati, handled the turnaround with ease, playing
  crisp and composed doubles. With $1m and bragging rights on the line, this
  semi-final is a clash of singles stars who’ve found instant chemistry. Pegula
  and Draper have won the toss and elected to receive. We’ll be under way once
  they’ve gone through their warm-ups. The lights have dimmed inside Arthur Ashe
  Stadium as a color guard takes its place along the baseline for the US
  national anthem. The upper bowl isn’t quite filled to capacity, but it’s a
  greater turnout than we can remember for mixed doubles at the US Open. The
  first four Pegula, Draper, Swiatek and Ruud should be making their entrances
  shortly. The newest event on the US Open schedule promised innovation and drew
  skepticism in equal measure. By Tuesday evening, though, the revamped mixed
  doubles had already delivered a full day of drama, packed stadiums and a final
  four brimming with storylines ahead of tonight’s semifinal and championship
  matches. The “newly reimagined” tournament, condensed into two days with a
  slimmed-down 16-team field, has shifted the emphasis from doubles specialists
  to marquee singles names. Sets to four games, no-ad scoring and 10-point
  tiebreaks quickened the tempo, producing brisk contests that felt more like a
  highlight reel than a grind. “It’s not an exhibition,” Jessica Pegula insisted
  after partner Jack Draper called it one by mistake. And judging by the crowds
  that filled Ashe and Armstrong Stadiums, fans agreed. Free admission during
  Fan Week helped fill the seats, a stark contrast to the half-empty stands when
  mixed doubles finals used to be buried deep in the second week. Day one wasn’t
  kind to the biggest stars. Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu, whose pairing
  drew the most pre-tournament attention, bowed out in straight sets to Pegula
  and Draper. Taylor Fritz and Elena Rybakina, the No 2 seeds, were also bounced
  early, as were Novak Djokovic and Olga Danilovic. But the new format wasn’t
  just about celebrity. It also gave doubles traditionalists a chance to remind
  everyone of their craft. Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori, last year’s
  champions and the lone established team in the draw, played flawless attacking
  doubles to reach another semi-final. “We are also playing for the doubles
  players,” Vavassori said pointedly, even as he admitted the packed house was a
  victory in itself. The early rounds also provided a timely boost for Draper.
  Sidelined since Wimbledon with a forearm injury, the Brit looked sharp
  alongside Pegula, attacking the net with aggression and rediscovering the form
  that carried him to a Flushing Meadows semifinal last year. Pegula’s calm
  baseline control complemented him perfectly, and the top seeds surged through
  their two matches without dropping more than two games in a set. Meanwhile,
  Iga Swiatek and Casper Ruud, the No 3 seeds, showed their resilience with two
  commanding wins less than 24 hours after a late-night arrival from Cincinnati.
  Both looked fresh despite the hectic turnaround and their teamwork clicked
  immediately. They now meet Pegula and Draper in what looks like the marquee
  semi-final. The other side of the draw brings a twist: Danielle Collins and
  Christian Harrison, late replacements after Jannik Sinner’s withdrawal,
  suddenly find themselves one win away from a million-dollar payday. They’ll
  face Errani and Vavassori, who are determined to defend their title – and to
  prove doubles skill still matters in a field dominated by singles stars. Stay
  with us as we bring you updates, analysis and courtside color from Flushing
  Meadows once the first semi-final begins at the top of the hour. Bryan will be
  here shortly. In the meantime here’s Tumaini Carayol’s report off Tuesday’s
  action.

Errani/Vavassori break in seventh game of second set! Second set: Swiatek/Ruud 3-6, 3-4 Errani/Vavassori* (*denotes next server) Squeaky-bum time for our Iga. She falls behind love-30, then 15-40 and triple break point down on her serve. Ruud saves the first of them with an overhand smash early in the rally. But Errani converts on the second with a deft volley at the net!

Second set: Swiatek/Ruud 3-6, 3-2 Errani/Vavassori* (*denotes next server) Ruud marshals another drama-free hold. The No 3 seeds have won 12 of the last 13 points on his racket. More treatment for Vavassori from the physio during the changeover. And this time it appears they’re asking for a medical timeout with Errani having darted off the court and into the tunnel. Second set: *Swiatek/Ruud 3-6, 2-2 Errani/Vavassori (*denotes next server) Errani, broken in her previous service game, bounces back nicely with the comfortable hold.

Second set: Collins/Harrison 2-4, 2-4 Errani/Vavassori Vavassori leaves no doubt, holding at love while crunching a 118mph ace along the way.

First set: Collins/Harrison 0-1 Errani/Vavassori* (*denotes next server) Errani and Vavassori are receiving to start and win a splended all-court rally. They get their teeth into the Harrison serve at 15-30, then go triple break point down at 15-40. He’s lost all three points to Errani’s return, notably. A nifty Errani volley that Collins can’t handle nails down the break. Now it’s time for the second semi-final between Danielle Collins/Christian Harrison and Sara Errani/Andrea Vavassori. For the defending champions, this event is about more than a title defense. They’ve been outspoken critics of the new format, which squeezed out many specialist pairs, but their play has been the perfect rebuttal. Crisp volleys, impeccable teamwork and a refusal to be intimidated by star names have put them back on the brink of another final.

Pegula’s steadiness and Draper’s net aggression carried them smoothly through Tuesday, highlighted by their dismantling of Raducanu and Alcaraz. But Swiatek and Ruud, fresh off a late-night dash from Cincinnati, handled the turnaround with ease, playing crisp and composed doubles. With $1m and bragging rights on the line, this semi-final is a clash of singles stars who’ve found instant chemistry. Pegula and Draper have won the toss and elected to receive. We’ll be under way once they’ve gone through their warm-ups. The lights have dimmed inside Arthur Ashe Stadium as a color guard takes its place along the baseline for the US national anthem. The upper bowl isn’t quite filled to capacity, but it’s a greater turnout than we can remember for mixed doubles at the US Open. The first four Pegula, Draper, Swiatek and Ruud should be making their entrances shortly. The newest event on the US Open schedule promised innovation and drew skepticism in equal measure. By Tuesday evening, though, the revamped mixed doubles had already delivered a full day of drama, packed stadiums and a final four brimming with storylines ahead of tonight’s semifinal and championship matches. The “newly reimagined” tournament, condensed into two days with a slimmed-down 16-team field, has shifted the emphasis from doubles specialists to marquee singles names. Sets to four games, no-ad scoring and 10-point tiebreaks quickened the tempo, producing brisk contests that felt more like a highlight reel than a grind. “It’s not an exhibition,” Jessica Pegula insisted after partner Jack Draper called it one by mistake. And judging by the crowds that filled Ashe and Armstrong Stadiums, fans agreed. Free admission during Fan Week helped fill the seats, a stark contrast to the half-empty stands when mixed doubles finals used to be buried deep in the second week. Day one wasn’t kind to the biggest stars. Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu, whose pairing drew the most pre-tournament attention, bowed out in straight sets to Pegula and Draper. Taylor Fritz and Elena Rybakina, the No 2 seeds, were also bounced early, as were Novak Djokovic and Olga Danilovic. But the new format wasn’t just about celebrity. It also gave doubles traditionalists a chance to remind everyone of their craft. Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori, last year’s champions and the lone established team in the draw, played flawless attacking doubles to reach another semi-final. “We are also playing for the doubles players,” Vavassori said pointedly, even as he admitted the packed house was a victory in itself. The early rounds also provided a timely boost for Draper. Sidelined since Wimbledon with a forearm injury, the Brit looked sharp alongside Pegula, attacking the net with aggression and rediscovering the form that carried him to a Flushing Meadows semifinal last year. Pegula’s calm baseline control complemented him perfectly, and the top seeds surged through their two matches without dropping more than two games in a set. Meanwhile, Iga Swiatek and Casper Ruud, the No 3 seeds, showed their resilience with two commanding wins less than 24 hours after a late-night arrival from Cincinnati. Both looked fresh despite the hectic turnaround and their teamwork clicked immediately. They now meet Pegula and Draper in what looks like the marquee semi-final. The other side of the draw brings a twist: Danielle Collins and Christian Harrison, late replacements after Jannik Sinner’s withdrawal, suddenly find themselves one win away from a million-dollar payday. They’ll face Errani and Vavassori, who are determined to defend their title – and to prove doubles skill still matters in a field dominated by singles stars. Stay with us as we bring you updates, analysis and courtside color from Flushing Meadows once the first semi-final begins at the top of the hour. Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime here’s Tumaini Carayol’s report off Tuesday’s action.
