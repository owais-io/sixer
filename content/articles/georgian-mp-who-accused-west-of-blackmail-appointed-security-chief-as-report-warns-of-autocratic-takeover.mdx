  A Georgian Dream MP who criticised the west over a “policy of blackmail and
  threats” has been appointed to lead the country’s security services as an
  authoritative report warned of an autocratic takeover. Mamuka Mdinaradze, who
  was the parliamentary majority leader for the ruling party, was confirmed on
  Wednesday as head of the country’s powerful state security service. He has
  previously attacked the EU and the US for criticising the Georgian government
  over democratic backsliding, with Brussels warning of a blockage on Georgia’s
  long-held aspiration to join the bloc. Mdinaradze was also responsible for
  introducing a “successor parties bill” in parliament to target opposition
  groups said to be hostile to the ruling party. The law aims to ban political
  movements “whose activities, the personal composition of decision-makers, or
  statutory goals” are identical to those of the previous governing party, the
  United National Movement. Mdinaradze has described the UNM as “anti-Georgian,
  anti-constitutional, anti-national and criminal”. His appointment came as a
  report, published by the Rule of Law Lab at New York University School of Law
  and Gnomon Wise, a Georgian research institute, claimed the Georgian Dream
  party led by the billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili had consolidated its
  autocratic control. The report warns that Georgia’s institutions have “been
  systematically eroded and repurposed to entrench a personalist regime” led by
  Ivanishvili, the chair of Georgian Dream and the country’s richest man. The
  regime is said to have taken control of the courts by reconfiguring and
  politicising the high council of justice to become the sole authority over
  judicial careers, leading to a “purge of disobedient judges”. The prosecution
  service is “tightly controlled” by Ivanishvili through a loyal prosecutor
  general and “a rigid, Soviet-style hierarchy”, the report claims, in which
  “prosecutors act as political enforcers, targeting critics and shielding
  allies”. The state security service that will be led by Mdinaradze is said to
  have evolved into a “sprawling surveillance and enforcement body”. The
  report’s authors write: “The Ivanishvili regime has entrenched authoritarian
  control by weaponising Georgia’s internal security apparatus. “Two key
  institutions – the ministry of internal affairs (MIA) and the state security
  service (SSS) – form the backbone of this repressive machinery. “Though the
  SSS is nominally independent from the executive, both agencies are staffed by
  loyalists and operate with no meaningful oversight, answering directly to
  Ivanishvili. “The SSS, in particular, has evolved into a sprawling
  surveillance and enforcement body. The MIA, through its department of special
  tasks, has led violent crackdowns on protesters.” Last year, hundreds of
  thousands of protesters demonstrated on the streets of the capital, Tbilisi,
  against a law that obliged media or civil society groups in Georgia that
  receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as
  “organisations serving the interests of a foreign power”. The EU gave the
  Georgian government a deadline of 31 August to report back on a series of
  recommendations after the bloc warned that it would end visa-free travel if
  laws deemed to be autocratic were not repealed, including the controversial
  “foreign agents” and anti-LGBT laws. A report has been submitted by the
  government but the lack of reform, and the rhetoric of leading Georgian Dream
  figures, suggests the responses to the EU recommendations are unlikely to be
  found acceptable. David Zedelashvili, a co-author of the report and leading
  constitutional lawyer from the Gnomon Wise research institute based at the
  University of Georgia, in Tbilisi, said: “This report meticulously documents
  Georgia’s descent into authoritarianism, pinpointing the core pillars of its
  authoritarian regime and providing targeted strategies to halt its further
  entrenchment”.
