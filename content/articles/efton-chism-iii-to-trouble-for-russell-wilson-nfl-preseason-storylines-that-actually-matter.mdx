  Most of the preseason is noise. Starters sit. Teams don’t game plan. Coaches
  roll out bland schemes, evaluating their own roster rather than attacking the
  opposition. But there are always some threads that have a real, actual bearing
  on the regular season. Here are five storylines that look like they will
  matter in 2025. Jaxson Dart The Giants entered the year with a well reasoned
  quarterback plan. They would use 36-year-old Russell Wilson as a bridge
  starter until first-round pick Jaxson Dart was ready, probably somewhere
  around mid-season. Well, it appears that Dart is ready now. The rookie
  completed 14-of-16 passes for 137 yards with a passing touchdown and rushing
  score against the Jets in his second preseason game, building on a solid
  performance in his debut. Brian Daboll has done what good coaches should do:
  he has met Dart halfway. Rather than drowning his rookie in a complex system,
  Daboll has ported over big chunks of Dart’s college playbook. It’s Ole Miss
  concepts with pro gloss, designed to get Dart comfortable. The early returns
  have been promising. Dart does look comfortable in the pocket. He has been
  fine with the speed of the game. For a rookie starter, those are the first two
  boxes to check off. By making his offense as Dart-friendly as possible, Daboll
  has given the quarterback a platform to flash his arm talent. In his second
  outing, Dart didn’t make as many “wow” throws, but he showed a stronger grasp
  of the Giants’ offense. Wilson, meanwhile, has been fine. Good in spurts. But
  he’s the same old Russ we saw in Pittsburgh: capable of hitting beautiful
  strikes down the field, but limited in attacking the shorter and intermediate
  parts. With Dart in the lineup, the Giants can threaten every area of the
  field. He is a fearless deep-ball thrower and a genuine rushing threat, even
  if he’s sometimes a danger to himself. The offense has also taken on a
  different rhythm with the rookie in the lineup. With Wilson under center, the
  Giants have looked mechanical and laborious. When Dart has taken over, the
  operation has been slicker, with Daboll ratcheting up the tempo. Running such
  a slim, up-tempo system won’t be enough to navigate a full season, but it’s
  enough of a starting point to chuck the rookie in until he can come to terms
  with a broader playbook. Daboll insists there is no competition. “Russ is our
  starter. We’re going to keep developing Jaxson,” Daboll said this week. That’s
  understandable; Daboll wants to keep pressure off a first-year player and has
  a ready-made vet who could squeeze out a couple of wins until Dart can run a
  more sophisticated scheme. But Dart has shown enough in preseason that he
  should be chucked into the deep end for Week 1. The only reason to mess around
  with Wilson is to try to eke out a couple of wins so that the coaching staff
  and front office can keep their jobs. The Patriots’ rookie class No, your eyes
  are not deceiving you. Yes, the Patriots have another shifty slot receiver.
  Efton Chism III has been a preseason darling. The undrafted rookie out of
  Eastern Washington is almost a meme of a New England slot: tough, undersized,
  a fidget spinner in and out of breaks, always open. With Josh McDaniels back
  running the offense, Chism is a lock to make the Patriots roster. And New
  England is sneakily deep at receiver: Stefon Diggs, Mack Hollins and Kayshon
  Boutte bring a nice blend of veteran knowhow, toughness, and explosivity.
  Third-round pick Kyle Williams will be an immediate downfield threat, while
  Chism does damage underneath. It’s a solid, varied collection of talent. Chism
  will probably make the team ahead of Ja’Lynn Polk (second round) and Javon
  Baker (fourth round), two draftees from a year ago. Baker is a possible trade
  candidate, while the Patriots are expected to stash Polk on injured reserve
  after a nightmare first year in the league. The injection of weapons is good
  news for Drake Maye, who was forced to throw to the weakest crop of receivers
  in the league as a rookie. It’s not just the receiving corps, either. If we’re
  handing out preseason MVP awards, rookie running back TreVeyon Henderson would
  be near the top of the standings. Henderson was initially tabbed as a
  third-down specialist. He was a prolific receiver at Ohio State and the best
  pass-protecting running back in the rookie class. But Henderson has been given
  a full run with the offense in preseason, showing he can anchor the early-down
  run game, return kicks and add some juice to the passing attack. The Patriots
  needed their draft class to hit after last season’s debacle, in which they
  ended the season 4-13. So far, so good this time around. Bills defense Buffalo
  spent the offseason fortifying their defensive line. But the preseason has
  exposed issues on the back end of the defense. The Bears roasted the Bills’
  backups in the second week of preseason, with three quarterbacks throwing for
  a combined 357 yards and two touchdowns. Being lit up by Caleb Williams and
  Ben Johnson is one thing; being shredded by Tyson Bagent and Austin Reed
  should set off a five-alarm fire. All over the league, teams look short at
  corner. The Eagles, Chiefs and other top contenders are scratching around for
  starters or backups in their secondary. But the Bills have three worries: who
  will start opposite Christian Benford at cornerback? What’s the ideal safety
  tandem? Do they have enough depth? Sean McDermott is one of the league’s best
  coaches when it comes to working with the secondary. He can find no-names and
  turn them into impactful starters. When McDermott starts grousing about a
  group, you know you’re in trouble. And the coach has taken sporadic shots at
  his safety room throughout the preseason. That includes 2024 second-round pick
  Cole Bishop, who was slated to be a starter this season. “Cole has missed
  quite a bit of time … It remains to be seen what he is truly able to do for
  us,” McDermott said after the Bears’ trouncing. “We’re getting short on time.”
  There are concerns at cornerback, too. Rookie first-round pick Maxwell
  Hairston is dealing with an injury, pushing the returning Tre’Davious White
  into the starting lineup. Behind White, it’s slim pickings. And at the safety
  spots, the Bills are relying on Bishop or Damar Hamlin to become consistent
  starters. For most teams, a secondary shortage would be a concern. For the
  Bills, it’s borderline existential. Depth matters. The Bills played the fewest
  snaps in base defense last season (three linebackers) and led in their use of
  dime defense (six defensive backs). That’s McDermott’s vision for the defense.
  To hit those rates, the Bills need seven or eight reliable players in the
  secondary, given the potential for injuries and suspensions. Right now, they
  have one: Benford. Few teams are operating with as much urgency as Buffalo.
  Every year with Josh Allen in his prime is Super Bowl or bust. Last season,
  they were undone by a misfiring pass rush. They tried to address that in the
  offseason, but now look woefully short in the secondary. Isaac TeSlaa’s
  breakout Lions general manager Brad Holmes has done it again. The Lions traded
  up to grab Arkansas wide receiver Isaac TeSlaa in the third round of the
  draft, taking him 98 spots before the consensus big board – a reliable
  indicator of draft value. Holmes and the Lions do things their own way,
  routinely selecting players a round or two before the consensus board has them
  slotted. On many of those picks, Holmes has been proven correct. But there was
  a twinge of being high on his own supply in the most recent draft, giving up
  two future third-round picks to move up 32 spots to select TeSlaa. It’s just
  preseason, but the early signals suggest Holmes was right again. It’s hard not
  to get caught up in the TeSlaa hype. The long, rangy receiver is a splash play
  waiting to happen. There is almost a languid feel to how he cuts across the
  field. But when he explodes, he’s gone. TeSlaa offers a big target to Jared
  Goff, and he can play above the rim, leaping and plucking balls out of the
  clouds. TeSlaa’s traits have translated into preseason production. He has
  grabbed 8 of his 11 targets, scoring two touchdowns and averaging 13.1 yards a
  catch. In college, TeSlaa was not a go-to target. He is still raw and
  inconsistent. But the Lions don’t need him to be a volume player. With Amon-Ra
  St Brown, Jameson Williams, Jahmyr Gibbs and Sam LaPorta, Detroit have plenty
  of dependable weapons. TeSlaa will add extra pop to an already explosive unit.
  At this point, it’s almost unfair. Indy’s quarterback competition Nothing can
  sap the energy out of a fanbase like a quarterback competition featuring
  Daniel Jones. The only thing less inspiring may be Jones winning one. Jones
  has been named the Colts’ starter over Anthony Richardson despite a blah
  preseason showing. The Colts opened the preseason with a plan to give the two
  QBs an equal number of drives and reps to decide who would be the team’s
  starter. The plan was for Richardson to take the bulk of snaps in the first
  week, with Jones getting the majority in the second week. That idea dissolved
  when Richardson went down with a hand injury on the first drive of the
  preseason and Jones entered the lineup. Shane Steichen reset in Week 2,
  flipping his approach and giving Richardson the game time he was intended to
  receive in the opening week. But it was telling that Jones, who took fewer
  snaps, still received more reps with the Colts’ starting offense. Snap by
  snap, there was little to split the two. Richardson remains all upside and
  volatility, while Jones was steadier. Does anything scream Daniel Jones louder
  than an 11-play, 77-yard drive that ends in a field goal? Does anything say
  Anthony Richardson like producing the throw of the preseason (called back for
  a flag) after butchering a snap and blowing two pre-snap protection checks?
  It’s funny, in a sense, that Jones is the quarterback painted as the
  stabilizing force. He finished with 42 interceptions and 50 fumbles in 69
  starts with the Giants, producing one of the highest turnover rates in the
  league. Like Richardson, Jones is a volatile quarterback, albeit one in
  dink-and-dunk clothing. Picking between the two came down to trust. “It’s
  everything,” Steichen said about choosing a starter. “It’s the operation, the
  communication in the huddle, the checks, the consistency.” Richardson’s
  inability to coordinate the game pre-snap and stick to the rhythm of the
  system continues to ding his progress – and his agent said on Tuesday that he
  is unsure of his client’s long-term future with the team. For all the sizzle
  he can provide an offense, Richardson – who the Colts took with the No 4
  overall pick just two years ago – still struggles with the basic mechanics of
  operating and processing a pro offense, and he has yet to prove he can stay
  healthy. There wasn’t a right call for Steichen to make; both quarterbacks
  will probably see playing time this season. In a few drives with the Colts,
  Jones still looked like a liability, but the offense was more polished with
  him under center. For that alone, he’s been given the first crack.
