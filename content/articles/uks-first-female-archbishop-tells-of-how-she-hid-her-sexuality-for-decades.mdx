  The new archbishop of Wales, the Most Rev Cherry Vann, has told of how she
  kept her sexuality secret for decades as part of her struggle to be accepted
  as a female minister in the Anglican communion. Speaking to the Guardian on
  Thursday, the day after her appointment, Vann, 66, said that without the
  strong belief that God had called her to the priesthood she “would not have
  survived” her journey through the ranks of the church. Vann became one of the
  first female priests to be ordained in England in 1994. Now, as the UK’s first
  female and first openly gay archbishop, and the first openly lesbian and
  partnered bishop to serve as a primate within the Anglican communion, she has
  well and truly broken the stained glass ceiling. “It happens that I’ve lived
  in a time that’s meant that I’m a trailblazer, but I’m not a campaigner,” the
  Leicestershire-born archbishop said during an interview at the Church in
  Wales’s offices in central Cardiff. “I’m not somebody to be out there all the
  time but I do seek to be true to what I think God’s asking of me.” Working in
  the Church in Wales since 2020 has been very different from the many years
  Vann spent at the Church of England, she said, as clergy are permitted to be
  in same-sex civil partnerships. In the Anglican church in England, same-sex
  relationships are technically allowed, but gay clergy are expected to remain
  celibate. Upon becoming bishop of Monmouth five years ago, Vann publicly
  disclosed her civil partnership with Wendy Diamond, her partner of 30 years,
  for the first time. “Other people in England were braver than I was and made
  their sexuality clear. A lot of them suffered the consequences of that,
  certainly when going forward for ordination,” Vann said. “For years we kept
  our relationship secret because I worried about waking up and finding myself
  outed on the front page of a newspaper. Now, Wendy joins me everywhere, and
  when I take services, it’s just normal. But in England she had to stay
  upstairs if I had a meeting in the house.” Being a woman in the church had
  been difficult enough, she added. “You can hide your sexuality, up to a point,
  but you can’t hide being a woman. There was a lot of nastiness; the men were
  angry, they felt they had been betrayed.” Vann said in the 1990s, she and a
  handful of other female priests began meeting for prayer and conversation with
  male colleagues opposed to their ordination. “It was awful, it was really
  difficult for all of us, but we stuck at it,” she said. Over time, the
  hostility dissipated. “This is what I’m hoping around the sexuality issue too
  – modelling that we can vehemently disagree about something, but we can still
  love one another in Christ and recognise one another as children of God.” Vann
  will be enthroned in red and gold at her home cathedral in Newport this autumn
  in what many in the church hope will mark a definitive end to a tumultuous
  period. Andy John, the former archbishop, announced in June he was standing
  down with immediate effect after an alcohol-fuelled financial, bullying and
  sexual misconduct scandal at Bangor Cathedral. John was not accused of
  wrongdoing, but calls for his resignation gathered pace after summaries of two
  reports were published and six “serious incident reports” were sent to the
  Charity Commission earlier this year. Two members of the cathedral’s college
  of priests have called for an independent inquiry into the events at Bangor,
  but Vann downplayed the demands, telling the Guardian that she believed the
  Wales-wide “cultural audit” announced by the church’s representative body in
  the wake of John’s resignation would be sufficient to “hold people
  accountable”. The new archbishop’s top priority is “healing and
  reconciliation”, she said. “There’s a lot of work already going on in the
  background, we haven’t been standing still … We must work to build trust with
  those who have been hurt and angered by what has gone on.” According to Tim
  Wyatt, a journalist focusing on the Anglican church, Vann’s arrival in Wales
  in 2020 as bishop of Monmouth was also part of a clean-up job after factional
  fighting over the conduct of her predecessor, Richard Pain. There was no
  formal finding against Pain. Vann is also somewhat of an outsider to Wales,
  symbolising a clean break with the John era and the Bangor scandal. The
  archbishop grew up in a religious family in Whetstone in Leicestershire,
  following in her church organist father’s footsteps by studying at the Royal
  College of Music and then the Royal Schools of Music, where she trained as a
  teacher. She entered an Anglican theological college in 1986 to prepare for
  ordination and then worked in the Manchester diocese, becoming a priest in
  1994 and archdeacon of Rochdale in 2008. Gender and sexuality are still highly
  divisive issues in the Anglican communion. Even in her new role as the first
  female and first openly gay archbishop in the UK, Vann was cautious on the
  topic of gay marriage. “I don’t personally feel the need to get married in
  church; Wendy and I have been together for 30 years, we’ve made our vows, and
  we are committed to each other. “Gay marriage in church is inevitable, I
  think: the question is when. There are people who are very opposed, and as
  leader, I have to honour their position, which is theologically grounded. It
  isn’t my job to push something through that would alienate a good proportion
  of clergy.” Vann’s appointment has caused outrage in some circles, with one
  prominent conservative group calling it “tragic”. In response, the Church in
  Wales has highlighted the warm welcome the news has received from dozens of
  other denominations and churches. For her part, Vann said she was not worried
  about whether her election would be perceived as tokenistic. “It’s a
  two-thirds majority vote in the electoral college, the bar is high,” she said.
  “I don’t think any of those people voted for me primarily because I’m a woman
  or a gay person. They voted for me because they recognise I’ve got the skills
  to lead the Church in Wales at this particular time.”
