  Court composers working for the Medicis in 16th-century Florence were expected
  to think big, and no one set their sights higher than Alessandro Striggio.
  Born in Mantua around 1536, he became something of a musical propagandist for
  the regime, touring his ambitious choral works around Europe as a kind of
  composer-cum-diplomat in the hope that their acoustical magnificence would
  sway hearts and minds in his bosses’ favour. The pièce de résistance was his
  monumental Missa Sopra Ecco Sì Beato Giorno, a mass setting for 40 to 60
  voices, rediscovered in 2005 having been lost for 400 years. Striggio’s mass
  was the centrepiece of this imaginative concert recreating the kind of
  liturgical event visitors to late Renaissance Florence might have been lucky
  enough to catch. Opening with theatrical flair, instrumentalists and singers
  filed on stage to a plainchant in praise of the Virgin Mary. The shift from
  salty medieval harmonies to the opulent warmth of Orazio Benevolo’s Laetatus
  Sum signalled the riches to come. Le Concert Spirituel, founded by Hervé
  Niquet in 1987, has form in this repertoire, having made an outstanding
  recording of much of this music. That said, it was surely a misstep for the
  musicians to perform in a closed circle on the Royal Albert Hall stage. While
  doubtless radio-friendly, with only a quarter of the singers facing out and
  another quarter presenting their backs to most of the audience, not only did
  balance become an issue, it was hard not to feel shut out of what should have
  been an immersive experience. Music in 40 parts can be exposing for individual
  voices. Nevertheless, the Striggio worked its magic, especially in the
  supersized Agnus Dei and the flamboyant Osanna in Excelsis where voices
  tumbled over each other with joyful abandon. Even better were the Benevolo
  works, including a superb Magnificat where verses were interspersed with
  instrumental ensembles. Palestrina motets played on sackbuts, a practice
  typical of the time, lent a touch of authenticity, and there were some choice
  rarities, including Domenico Massenzio’s frisky female-voice Filiae Jerusalem.
  A 40-part Striggio motet rounded off the evening with a sumptuous anticipation
  of paradise. • Listen again on BBC Sounds until 12 October. The Proms continue
  until 13 September.
