  Water at £19 a bottle (‘You’re either going to be a pioneer or a joke’, 28
  August)(Meet the water sommeliers: they believe H₂O can rival wine – but would
  you pay £19 a bottle?, 28 August)? What a load of rubbish. Far better to order
  a free glass of tap water. At an Open University summer school some years ago,
  students were invited to take part in a trial. All were given 10 lots of two
  samples, Nottingham tap water and Highland Spring. There were enough
  participants over the weeks for a statistical sample. Answer? They could not
  tell the difference. Incidentally, licensed premises are obliged to provide
  free tap water on request. Refusing to do would be a breach of their licence
  condition. Rosalind Clayton London • Perhaps Joe Rawlins and Gaëlle Radigon,
  the owners of La Popote restaurant, could consider putting tap water on the
  menu as “Corporation Pop”, as we called it when I was a child in Manchester.
  If you wanted it fizzy, just shake it. The omission of Buxton water from their
  list is a crime. Chris Walters Buxton, Derbyshire • As a non-drinker, I can
  readily tell between my Vichy Catalan (my favourite) and my Badoit green
  bottle or Badoit red bottle (second favourite), all naturally carbonated.
  Would I pay £19 for a bottle of water I haven’t yet tried? 100%. What’s the
  difference between this and a fermented grape or a distilled grain? Those who
  don’t drink alcohol need more of this. Water is not simply just water. And
  what’s more, it’s good for you. Siân Miller Guildford, Surrey • Simon Usborne
  enjoys a water menu at a Cheshire restaurant, but sampling craft water is
  nothing new. In 1874, Karl Marx was in Karlsbad – still known for its artisan
  waters – to imbibe spring waters for health reasons. Marx, who liked a pilsner
  beer, was rather grumpy about it, writing to Engels on 18 September 1874 that
  drinking the water made him irritable. Keith Flett Tottenham, London •
  Betteridge’s law of headlines states that if it ends with a question mark, the
  answer is almost always “no”. The headline on the front cover of last
  Thursday’s G2 print section is a prime example: “They believe H2O can rival
  wine – but would you pay £19 for a bottle?” Nick Swallow Worminghall,
  Buckinghamshire • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian
  today? Please email us your letter and it will be considered for publication
