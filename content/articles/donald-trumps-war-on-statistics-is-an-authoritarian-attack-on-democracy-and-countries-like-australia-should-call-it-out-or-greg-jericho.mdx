  Whether it be the judicial system, universities, or health organisations,
  Donald Trump cannot abide by anything that does not confirm his world view. So
  it was not a shock when late last week he came for statistics – or, more
  pointedly, the person in charge of the economic statistics. On Friday, the
  US’s Bureau of Labor Studies released the July US employment figures. They
  were not good. Just 73,000 non-farm jobs were added and annual employment
  growth was the worst it has been since the GFC years (excluding the pandemic):

  autocrat would do when told bad news: he shot the messenger – at least only
  figuratively. Trump argued that Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of labor
  statistics, had faked bad figures purely to hurt him. And so he fired her. But
  this should not be dismissed as “oh that’s just Trump”, nor should we just
  sigh and say we have been in a fact-free era for nearly a decade. Reality
  might be hanging on to the political debate for dear life, but this move
  threatens to fling it off the cliff. The BLS data is vital for understanding
  not just what is going on in the USA but to guide other nations – like here in
  Australia. For example, Australia is doing very well compared with the US.
  Unlike the US, our employment rate is higher now than it was before the
  pandemic: If the graph does not display click here These comparisons can
  influence future policies. For example, we did very well during the GFC; the
  US did not. We also did much better during the pandemic than the US. They also
  give insight into the future. The US is still the world’s biggest economy and
  – as we have seen with inflation – what happens there, often happens here, in
  Australia: If the graph does not display click here If Trump doesn’t like weak
  employment growth numbers, you think he’ll be happy with inflation data that
  shows his tariffs are causing higher prices? And this is not just some
  academic exercise. US welfare payments are indexed to inflation, so the
  official data vitally affects the livelihood of many people. Trump thinks when
  he closes his eyes the rest of the world disappears. But not measuring
  inflation or unemployment or global temperatures doesn’t disappear the
  problems. And loss of trust in official data will affect business investment
  decisions, borrowing costs and – as with all attacks on institutions – faith
  in democracy. For example, in Australia, the Australian Bureau of Statistics
  has revealed that in the past year the cost of living for all households
  except “self-funded” retirees rose faster than did inflation: If the graph
  does not display click here This is not the greatest news for the Australian
  government – no politician likes data that says things might be worse than
  what they previously argued. Cost of living, unlike inflation, includes
  mortgage repayments. Despite falling interest rates, repaying a mortgage is
  still around 4.4% higher than it was a year ago, and since March 2022 mortgage
  repayments have accounted for nearly half of the increase in cost of living:
  If the graph does not display click here Does it help the Australian
  government for the ABS to reveal this? Not really. It could blame our Reserve
  Bank, but generally governments are blamed for high interest rates. It
  certainly doesn’t help the government for the ABS to release figures that some
  journalist like me can use to show that the value of wages are 8.6% lower than
  they were in March 2021 when you use cost of living rather than CPI: If the
  graph does not display click here That type of information makes life hard for
  the government – but so it should! In a democracy you have to face your
  critics, argue your case and convince voters you have the best plans and way
  forward. Political parties are already working hard to make you question
  reality. But at least till now, even in the US, where Trump would like there
  to be a new kind of maths where prices can fall by more than 100% (1,000%,
  1,100, 1,200, 1,300!!), reality has been counted and presented. The end of
  impartial economic data would not just be another case of Trump “flooding the
  zone”. It would be a fundamental attack on democracy, designed to ensure those
  who are suffering from his polices are not able to demonstrate that things are
  worse – either for them or for the nation. They are the actions usually
  associated with authoritarian regimes, and we should not shy away from making
  that clear. Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the
