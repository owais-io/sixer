  Venus Williams will take the court on Monday night for her record-extending
  25th US Open singles appearance, the Here We Go Again meme brought to life,
  quite literally as enduring a part of the Flushing Meadows iconography as
  Arthur Ashe Stadium itself. At 45, two years removed from her last grand slam
  match and ranked No 610 in the world, she will face Karolína Muchová, the
  Czech 11th seed and 2023 French Open runner-up who has twice reached the
  semi-finals in New York. If the scale of the task before her is formidable, so
  too is the symbolism of her presence. Williams is the oldest singles
  competitor at America’s national championships since Renée Richards 44 years
  ago. She made her debut here as a 17-year-old in 1997 – the same year Ashe was
  completed and replaced Armstrong as the tournament’s main stadium – becoming
  the first unseeded player in the Open era to reach the final before losing to
  Martina Hingis. Twenty-eight years later, she returns with her place in
  history long since assured but her taste for the fight undiminished. She’s the
  winner of seven grand slam singles titles – five at Wimbledon, two at the US
  Open – to go with 14 doubles crowns alongside her younger sister. She has been
  world No 1 in singles and doubles, won four Olympic gold medals and brought in
  roughly $43m in prize money with countless more from endorsements and outside
  endeavors. Given her preposterous longevity and pan-cultural resonance, it
  would not be hyperbolic to call her one of the five most famous active
  sportspeople on the planet. Nothing left to prove came and went sometime
  during the George W Bush years. Yet here she is again, after a 16-month hiatus
  that included surgery for uterine fibroids and long spells of doubt. She
  returned in July at the Washington Open where she drew overflow crowds that
  included NBA star Kevin Durant and knocked off Peyton Stearns, the world No
  35. It offered a flicker of the old fire, a reminder that her classic
  first-strike game – big serve, flat drives, all-court aggression – still has
  teeth. Off the court, the comeback has coincided with a new chapter in her
  personal life. Williams confirmed last month that she is engaged to the
  Italian actor-producer Andrea Preti, crediting him with encouraging her
  through the grind of training and recovery. “My fiancé is here and he really
  encouraged me to keep playing,” she said after the win over Stearns, which
  made her the oldest player to win a tour-level singles match since Martina
  Navratilova in 2004. “There were so many times where I just wanted to coast
  and kind of chill. … He encouraged me to get through this and it’s wonderful
  to be here.” The couple had kept their relationship largely private until
  recently, but their public appearances together – from boating on the Amalfi
  Coast to Milan Fashion Week earlier this year – added a different kind of
  spotlight to Williams’s return. For a player who once deftly volleyed
  questions about settling down, it has marked a shift in tone. For much of the
  past two years many assumed Venus had quiet-quit from the tour. Serena’s
  high-profile farewell in Vogue in 2022, followed by the exits of Roger
  Federer, Rafael Nadal and Maria Sharapova, seemed the bookend to an era. But
  Venus, despite quipping last month that she’d only come back to tennis for the
  health insurance, never embraced that narrative. “I think I’ll always play
  tennis,” she said on Saturday. “It’s in my DNA. So it doesn’t matter if it’s
  now or 30 years from now … tennis will always be one of the most important
  parts of my life.” Even by the standards of sport’s greatest methuselahs –
  think Jaromir Jagr, Bernard Hopkins, Tom Brady – Williams is built different.
  None of the 609 players above her in the rankings have made it to their 40s
  yet, much less 45. And only a small fraction of them were even alive when
  Williams made her professional debut at the Bank of the West Classic back in
  1994, when Pulp Fiction was in theaters and Boyz II Men ruled the US charts.
  That sense of permanence helps explain why she continues. “I haven’t thought
  about what people would take away from it,” she said. “I just mostly think
  about what I would get from it.” She has more than earned the right. Since
  bursting through the gates of a lily-white sport alongside her sister,
  Williams has borne the twin burdens of racism and sexism with unflinching
  grace. She led the campaign for equal prize money at Wimbledon and Roland
  Garros. She inspired a generation of Black American players, including Coco
  Gauff, Sloane Stephens, Taylor Townsend and Hailey Baptiste. Her presence this
  week also coincides with the 75th anniversary of Althea Gibson’s debut at the
  US national championships, another reminder of the lineage she extends.
  “Althea accomplished so much, and a lot of it has not been given the credit it
  deserves,” Williams said. “The most important part is just shining light on it
  and acknowledging that.” Peers have been quick to stress her wider importance
  over the past few days. “She’s one of the best athletes of all time,” said
  Frances Tiafoe. “Her and her sister, they’re not only great for the women’s
  game, not only great for women’s sports, but they are so iconic.” Naomi Osaka
  added: “I don’t really like how every headline mentions her age … it’s more
  the broader significance, how much of a legend she is.” It is easy to
  romanticize her return, but the margins are unforgiving. Since improbably
  reaching the Australian Open and Wimbledon finals in 2017, then
  re-establishing herself as a fixture in the WTA’s top 10 during her age-38
  season, her activity and results have tapered off. She has not won a match at
  the US Open since 2019. Wildcard invitations into the main draw, including the
  one that brought her here, inevitably provoke debate about whether they should
  go to younger players. And her opponent Muchová, with her variety and
  shot-making intelligence, is precisely the kind of player who punishes rust. A
  win, frankly, would qualify as a major upset. Williams is realistic about
  those stakes, but her humor remains as sharp as her fashion sense. “Hit it too
  hard, it goes out,” she said when asked to assess her current form. “So I’m
  going to try to hit less hard so it goes in. But the good news is I’m having
  fun controlling the points. It’s a great game style for me.” Among the
  staunchest defenders of USTA’s decision to award Williams a wildcard has been
  the retired American star Andy Roddick, who took the critics to task after
  Friday’s draw was revealed. “I don’t care if she goes out and doesn’t win a
  single game, we should be full of gratitude for having had Venus Williams in
  our game,” the 2003 US Open champion said on his podcast. “[The critics say]
  they are taking it away from someone who’s deserving. If you are deserving,
  you don’t need a wildcard. Simply, you have qualified on your own ranking.
  “It’s not an entitlement, it’s a gift. You’re telling me as a tennis
  tournament, that Venus Williams is not deserving as a gift from the US Open?
  Shut up, get out of here. She has been a gift to us, it’s not the other way
  around.” As a PlayStation-era carryover in a PS5 world, Williams’s stated
  goals are less about winning majors than about process, self-belief and the
  thrill of competing. “I want to be my best, and that’s the expectation I have
  for myself,” she said. “I haven’t played as much as the other players, so it’s
  a different challenge. I’m just trying to have fun, stay relaxed, and be my
  personal best.” Those sentiments echoed her remarks from DC last month: “There
  are no limits for excellence. It’s all about what’s in your head and how much
  you’re able to put into it. If you put in the work mentally, physically and
  emotionally, then you can have the result. It doesn’t matter how many times
  you fall down. Doesn’t matter how many times you get sick or get hurt or
  whatever it is. If you continue to believe and put in the work, there is space
  for you.” Whether this is her farewell to Flushing Meadows or merely another
  chapter in her long goodbye, Williams has no interest in scripting ahead. She
  will not trail it in a glossy magazine, nor invite anyone else to interpret it
  for her. When the time comes, she may simply slip through the side door, like
  another New York icon: Excuse me while I disappear. For now she has at least
  one more night on Ashe, one more chance to swing freely under the lights of
  her sport’s largest stage. “Super thrilling to be back,” she said. “It does
  not get old. It just gets more exciting.”
