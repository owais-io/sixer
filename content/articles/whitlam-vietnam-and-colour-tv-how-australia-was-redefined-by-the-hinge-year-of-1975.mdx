  Seismic political shake-ups, international upheaval that reverberated across
  the nation and a vivid cultural renaissance – 1975 was one of Australia’s most
  pivotal years of the 20th century. Five decades on, the National Library of
  Australia in Canberra is about to unveil a new exhibition spotlighting the
  year the prime minister was sacked, the Vietnam war came to an end and how,
  despite Hollywood telling us we’d never go back into the water, we did. Taking
  the title of the seminal Skyhooks album as inspiration, 1975: Living in the
  Seventies will explore how global conflict, pop culture, fashion and political
  reforms collided during a time of deep transformation. It is what the
  library’s director of exhibitions, Guy Hansen, calls one of Australia’s “hinge
  years”, up there with 1914 and 1949, when Australians ceased to be British
  subjects and a federal election ushered in the Menzies era respectively.
  “Australia started to go in a distinct direction,” says Hansen, who was a
  primary school student in Sydney’s western suburbs at the time. Sign up for
  the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the
  weekend, every Saturday morning “And of course, back then everybody watched
  the same news. The family would sit down and watch the seven o’clock news and
  hear what James Dibble had to say about things … and even if you were 11, you
  got a sense of the world.” The year did not begin well. The cleanup from
  Cyclone Tracy’s devastation had just begun – the death toll had risen to 66 –
  and five days into the new year 12 lives were lost when the bulk ore carrier
  MV Lake Illawarra struck the Tasman Bridge in Hobart. And it was bookended by
  the dismissal of Gough Whitlam’s government on 11 November, sparking one of
  the most intense collective public reactions in Australian political history.
  Under Whitlam the nation underwent sweeping changes to healthcare, divorce law
  and immigration policy, pushing Australia toward multiculturalism. And global
  events had not had such an enormous local impact since the outbreak of the
  second world war. The civil war that began in Lebanon would lead to 30,000
  people migrating to Australia. Three times that number arrived from Vietnam
  after the fall of Saigon. One neighbour to the north, Papua New Guinea, gained
  independence from Australia; another, Indonesia, invaded East Timor, with the
  diplomatic crisis deepening after news of the murder of five Australian
  journalists in Balibo. Australia was unable to quarantine itself from global
  economic stagflation and a looming energy crisis and watched on in wonder as
  Margaret Thatcher became the first woman in British history to take over the
  leadership of a major political party. The country’s hallowed communications
  institutions were disbanded, with the Postmaster-General’s Department becoming
  Telecom Australia and the Australian Postal Commission becoming Australia
  Post. The safari-suit wearing South Australian premier, Don Dunstan,
  scandalised conservative Australia with his decision to decriminalise
  homosexual acts between consenting adults. As gay rights were ushered in, the
  symbolic start of Indigenous land rights was marked by Whitlam pouring soil
  into the hands of the Gurindji leader Vincent Lingiari. It was also a year of
  youth-led culture. Double J became the new young voice of Australian music,
  Molly Meldrum the face of the country’s most popular music show and Skyhooks
  dominated the year as Australia’s answer to the big glam rock bands emerging
  out of London. Australia switched to colour television. And while everyone
  under the age of 30 was busy doing the Time Warp and swearing to never set
  foot in the water again, Australian films also came into their own. “You’ve
  got movies like Picnic at Hanging Rock [and] Sunday Too Far Away, popular,
  important movies made by Australian directors with Australian actors,” Hansen
  says. “There’s this kind of strong nationalism and cultural pride in the 70s,
  with this desire to tell Australian stories.” The exhibition promises to be
  more than just a heavy dose of baby boomer nostalgia, he says. It demonstrates
  how 1975 redefined what it meant to be Australian. 1975: Living in the
  Seventies opens at the National Library of Australia on 14 August and
  continues until 1 February. Entry is free
