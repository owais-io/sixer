  According to a new study, convertibles have dwindled to a 25-year low with
  only 16 new models for sale across the UK’s most popular car manufacturers.
  SUVs are taking the rap for the decline of convertibles in Britain as people
  move towards favouring bulkier vehicles. Data from CarGurus UK found that in
  2024 there were only 12,173 new convertibles registered in the UK compared to
  94,484 in 2004. One of cinema’s most iconic cars is probably the 1966 Ford
  Thunderbird convertible that Thelma and Louise drove on their their
  adventures. We would like to hear from people who have, or previously had, a
  convertible. What are your best and worst memories? Did you do any road trips
  and where did you enjoy travelling to the most? This Community callout closed
