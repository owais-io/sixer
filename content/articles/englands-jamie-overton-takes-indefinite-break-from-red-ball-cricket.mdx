  Surrey’s Jamie Overton, a member of England’s Test squad throughout this
  summer’s series against India, has announced that he is taking an indefinite
  break from first-class cricket, saying it was “no longer possible to commit
  fully to all formats at every level”. Overton’s decision means that rather
  than potentially being part of the squad travelling to Australia for this
  winter’s Ashes he will be free to honour his contract with Adelaide Strikers
  in the Big Bash League, with whom he has spent part of the last two winters –
  he was named the team’s MVP earlier this year after taking 11 wickets and
  scoring 191 runs at an average of 95.5 in the 2024-25 season, when the
  Strikers finished bottom of the eight-team league. “After a great deal of
  thought, I have decided to take an indefinite break from red-ball cricket,”
  the 31-year-old said in a statement. “I feel very fortunate to have played 99
  first-class matches, including two Test matches for England. Red-ball,
  first-class cricket has provided the foundation for my professional career and
  has been the gateway to every opportunity I’ve had in the game so far. It’s
  where I learnt the game, and it fuelled the goals and ambitions that have
  driven me for so long. “However, at this stage of my career, with the demands
  of cricket across a 12-month calendar, it’s no longer possible to commit fully
  to all formats at every level, both physically and mentally. Going forward, my
  focus will be on white-ball cricket, and I will continue to give everything to
  play at the highest level for as long as I can.” Overton’s two Tests saw him
  score a memorable 97 on debut against New Zealand at Headingley in 2022 before
  returning to the side for the dramatic final game against India at the Oval in
  July, his fifth and final red-ball game of the last two summers. After playing
  11 first-class matches in 2022 he has matched that number over the following
  three summers combined, with back injuries restricting his appearances in the
  longest format. Overton is currently at Headingley as part of England’s squad
  for the ODI series against South Africa that starts on Tuesday, and has also
  been named in the squads for the T20 series against the same opponents and for
  the three-match series in Ireland that follows.
