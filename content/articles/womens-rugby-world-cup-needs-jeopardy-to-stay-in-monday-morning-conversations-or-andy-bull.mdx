  Women’s Rugby World Cup needs jeopardy to stay in Monday morning conversations

  After all these years of asking for more, it’s churlish to complain when the
  Women’s Rugby World Cup delivered so much in one weekend. England’s victory
  pulled in two-and-half million prime time viewers on the BBC, 85,000 fans
  turned out across the four grounds, including a record-breaking 42,000 crowd
  in Sunderland, five hat-tricks, four packed fan zones, free concerts, and all
  those fireworks. It had almost everything anyone could have wanted. Almost.
  The one thing missing was a tight finish. The closest of the eight games was
  settled by three tries and change. The success of the World Cup isn’t just
  going to be measured by what happens on the weekends, but in the days in
  between them. World Rugby wants people to be talking about this tournament
  when they go into work on Monday morning. And for that to happen it needs some
  jeopardy. There were 72 tries in eight matches altogether, but 66 of them were
  by the winning team. England scored 11, so did Australia and Canada. South
  Africa scored 10. New Zealand eight. Blowouts happen in the pool stages of
  every Rugby World Cup: there were a bunch of one-sided matches in the men’s
  tournament two years ago, when France beat Namibia 96-0, New Zealand scored 96
  against Italy and Ireland defeated Romania 82-8. The difference this time was
  in what happened in between. The matches that we hoped would be close turned
  out anything but, with Scotland beating Wales 38-8 and France beating Italy
  24-0. Which didn’t surprise anyone who regularly watches women’s rugby, but
  maybe requires some explaining to the huge new audience who are only just
  discovering it. “The numbers don’t always tell the full story,” said World
  Rugby’s director of women’s rugby, Sally Horrox, when she was asked about it
  this week. Horrox argues that 49% of women’s rugby fans have come to it in the
  past two years regardless of how uneven the standard. These scorelines don’t
  necessarily stop the games from being entertaining. And she’s right, the Red
  Roses’ victory was as good as a one-sided game gets. No one at the stadium
  felt it suffered from being so predictable. Like the competition director,
  Yvonne Nolan, said, there was a lot of “fast, free-flowing rugby”, and plenty
  to admire in the way the losing teams played. But it’s true, too, that no
  amount of fireworks or free concerts can disguise the gaps between some of
  these teams. Women’s rugby needs the enthusiastic support of the media as it
  grows; its lack of visibility is, World Rugby argues, the biggest obstacle to
  its success. So there are good reasons why a lot of what is written and said
  about the women’s game tends to gloss over the obvious imbalances between the
  teams. The irony is that it’s a sign a sport has matured that everyone
  involved is able to be honest about what everyone’s watching, instead of
  celebrating the simple fact that so many people are. To their credit, Horrox
  and Nolan are both too smart to pretend anything else. They don’t shy away
  from speaking about the lopsided results, which are inevitable given the
  uneven pace of development in women’s game around the world. “These teams,” as
  Nolan says, “are all at different stages of their journey.” Women’s rugby is
  growing so quickly that the gaps between the teams are actually wider now than
  they were during the first tournament, back in 1991 (when only one match ended
  with a 50-point margin) because a handful of sides, and England in particular,
  have raced so far ahead. This Saturday, a Red Roses side, who have the benefit
  of all the expert coaching, medical support and sport science the Rugby
  Football Union can provide and who, because the country has one of the two
  professional domestic leagues in the world, are paid to play and train seven
  days a week, take on Samoa, who don’t even have national contracts, and whose
  team include a full-time property manager, police officer and primary school
  teacher, who all had to rely on donations to cover the lost income they have
  suffered by missing work to compete in England. Which invites the question of
  which is the better achievement, an overwhelming victory for the professionals
  or an honourable defeat for the amateurs? If they’re honest, the Red Roses
  will know that given their pedigree and the resources at their disposal, they
  made too many basic mistakes even when they beat the USA by 62 points. And
  that, too, may be the result of the fact that they have had so few close
  matches in recent years that they have been able to get away with being
  sloppy. World Rugby is doing what it can to help narrow the gap. It has
  provided all the smaller teams with access to a pool of nine specialist
  coaches, who work across set pieces, skills, and strength and conditioning,
  Alain Rolland has been brought in to work with them on how to reduce their
  penalty counts. But they can’t cover everything. Even Canada, who are one of
  the strongest teams in this tournament, had to crowdfund the last $1m of the
  $3.2m they needed to compete. But in the long term, a lot of this will come
  down to the hard work of widespread structural change, the small steps forward
  in between the tournaments, as well as the great leaps made during them.
