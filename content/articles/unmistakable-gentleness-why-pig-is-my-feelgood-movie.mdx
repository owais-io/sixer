  Michael Sarnoski’s Pig is not an obvious feelgood movie. Its hero is a
  bedraggled hermit named Robin (Nicolas Cage) who lives in the woods with his
  pet pig. Robin is kind of a tough hang – a sullen misanthrope who just barely
  tolerates the occasional presence of Amir (Alex Wolff), the young businessman
  who buys truffles from him. We don’t know who Robin was before, but it’s clear
  that life has taken a lot from him already. And then someone steals his damn
  pig. He sets off to rescue her and soon finds himself drawn into the grubby
  underbelly of Portland’s culinary scene, where chefs and waiters take part in
  bare-knuckled fights. We learn that Robin himself was once an esteemed chef
  and, called back into his old world on a quest for vengeance, it briefly looks
  like Pig is setting him up to be a scruffy John Wick. But, for Robin, revenge
  is a dish best served with the utmost care. Rather than violent showdowns we
  get a series of gentle sit-downs. First, he and Amir breakfast on some poorly
  cooked French toast. Amir tells Robin about his struggles growing up with a
  domineering father and a mentally ill mother. Robin responds by reminding him
  that the entire city of Portland is sure to be obliterated by earthquakes
  soon, so his personal problems really aren’t that big a deal. “You don’t have
  to care,” Robin assures him. It would be easy to mistake that advice for
  nihilism, to interpret it as encouragement to swear off humanity the way Robin
  has. Because he’s not wrong – even if you avoid the floods, everything you
  love in life will be washed away eventually. So maybe it’s better not to care.
  But that doesn’t quite jive with the rest of the movie. Setting aside the
  extremely upsetting pig-napping scene, Sarnoski’s film is crafted with an
  unmistakable gentleness. The woodland where it begins is captured in long,
  patient takes that highlight the delicate play of light and water. Later, a
  home cooking scene is lit with such a gorgeous amber glow that it feels like a
  childhood memory. Each image is arranged with the care of a master chef
  assembling elements on a plate, and the yearning score from Alexis Grapsas and
  Philip Klein complements it beautifully. In short, this is not a film that’s
  going to tell us not to care. In fact, it’s the very opposite. Robin and Amir
  follow their breakfast with lunch at a hot new restaurant where plates of foam
  and smoke are accompanied by impassioned spiels about “the story” each dish
  tells. Robin summons the head chef and quickly drives him into an existential
  crisis by asking him simply, kindly, if he actually likes cooking this stuff.
  Maintaining the monk-like stillness that he carries throughout the film, Robin
  asks the increasingly frantic chef why he’s letting critics who don’t matter
  and customers who’ll never think about him again dictate the direction of his
  life. “We don’t get a lot of things to really care about,” Robin says. What’s
  beautiful about Pig – beyond the tranquil music, soul-soothing photography,
  offbeat humour and Cage’s meditative performance – is that it’s a movie about
  the importance of choosing to care. There’s a reason the film closes with a
  cover of Springsteen’s I’m On Fire, where love is described in terms of knife
  wounds and flames. Yes, caring will open us up to failure and pain. Robin
  himself is a walking embodiment of all the damage that caring can do to a
  person. But, over the course of the movie, we see him being slowly brought
  back to life – first by his fierce desire to protect the one creature he still
  allows himself to love, and then in a growing ability to care about other
  people too. There are plenty of movies that provide a more conventional
  “feelgood” role in my life. Ponyo paints the screen with pure joy. Airplane!
  is a barrage of beautifully braindead humour. When Harry Met Sally fits like a
  wool sweater and Lord of the Rings sweeps you up into a bucolic fantasy world
  where good always prevails. But I love Pig because it acknowledges all the
  reasons there are to feel absolutely terrible and then doubles down on the
  reasons to feel good anyway. We don’t get a lot of things to really care
  about, but the list surely includes nice food, good company, and movies like
  this. Pig is available on Netflix in the US, UK and Australia
