  In three years’ time, the swimming programme for the Los Angeles Olympics will
  unfold over nine days and nights on the grandest stage the sport has ever
  known. A purpose-built pool inside SoFi Stadium in Inglewood will be the
  centerpiece of a 38,000-capacity open-air natatorium, transforming the $5bn
  home of the NFL’s Rams and Chargers into what’s said to be the largest
  swimming venue in history. For the United States, a rare Summer Games on home
  soil should be a coronation, a chance to showcase the depth of its talent in
  the country’s most spectacular arena. Yet Michael Phelps, the most decorated
  Olympian of them all, fears the US swimming program is in no shape to seize
  the moment. Phelps has launched a withering attack on USA Swimming’s
  leadership, accusing it of “weak” stewardship, “poor operational controls” and
  presiding over years of organizational drift. The 23-times Olympic gold
  medalist said he would think twice about letting his own sons join the system
  in its current state. His concerns, he says, stretch back to his own
  competitive career, when athlete voices were too often brushed aside in the
  name of keeping the peace and presenting a united front. “This isn’t on the
  athletes,” he wrote in a lengthy Instagram statement. “This is on the
  leadership of USA Swimming.” The decline he sees is cultural and structural as
  much as competitive. In 2016, Phelps was part of a US swim team in Rio that,
  by his measure, was “arguably the most successful in the sport’s history”,
  winning 57% of the medals available in the pool. Eight years later in Paris,
  that share fell to 44% – the lowest for Team USA since the 1988 Olympics – a
  downtick he cites as evidence the cracks in the system have widened. An open
  letter he sent earlier this year to USA Swimming, co-signed by other
  medallists, world record holders, coaches and staff, was, he says, ignored.
  His prescription is sweeping: an independent review of the board, improved
  athlete services and renewed grassroots investment to reverse flagging
  membership. Other greats share his alarm. The 12-times Olympic medalist Ryan
  Lochte recently posted a meme, also shared by Phelps, likening USA Swimming to
  an interred corpse, while three-time Olympic champion and NBC analyst Rowdy
  Gaines has gone public with his concerns in an op-ed for Swimming World
  magazine. Gaines calls the organization’s year-long absence of a CEO a
  “leadership void” at the worst possible time. He warns that even the
  table-topping nine gold medals won at this summer’s world championships in
  Singapore – despite the severe gastroenteritis outbreak that badly compromised
  the US team – should not mask “deeper structural issues under the surface”.
  Both men see LA 2028 as a deadline: the last chance to repair the system
  before the lights go up in Inglewood. Notably, Phelps’s broadside does not
  directly address the most damaging area of USA Swimming’s recent history: its
  handling of sexual abuse, harassment and athlete safeguarding. Earlier this
  year, incoming CEO Chrissi Rawak resigned after just nine days when the
  organization learned of an undisclosed SafeSport complaint against her from
  her coaching days. The US Center for SafeSport itself, which handles such
  allegations, has been in an ongoing state of turmoil: its own chief executive
  was dismissed amid scrutiny of hiring practices, including an investigator who
  himself was later charged with multiple sex crimes, including rape, sex
  trafficking and soliciting prostitution. Survivors have reported
  retraumatization through flawed investigations, and their trust in both
  SafeSport and USA Swimming’s vetting processes remains fragile at best, if not
  fractured beyond repair. These controversies form the unspoken backdrop to
  Phelps’s and Gaines’s governance concerns. Their focus is on performance,
  leadership and resources, but the weaknesses they describe – poor oversight,
  slow action, lack of accountability – are the same flaws critics have long
  identified in the organization’s handling of abuse cases. If USA Swimming
  cannot convincingly address either set of problems, the sport risks arriving
  at the once-in-a-lifetime platform of a home Games with not only a competitive
  deficit, but a deficit of credibility. A home Olympics is an exceptional and
  defining moment for any sport. For American swimming, LA 2028 offers the
  chance to inspire a new generation, boost grassroots participation and cement
  the sport’s place in a crowded US sporting landscape. It is also, as Gaines
  notes, a one-shot opportunity: miss it and the momentum may be lost for
  decades. That is why the absence of a clear vision, not least a permanent
  leader, concerns those who understand both the stakes and the clock. SoFi
  Stadium may promise the grandest stage in Olympic history, but whether USA
  Swimming will be ready for it remains an open question.
