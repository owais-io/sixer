  met his wife, Janet, an artist, she asked him to write a children’s story for
  her to illustrate. Their first book together, Here Are the Brick Street Boys,
  was published in 1975, and the Ahlbergs went on to become one of the most
  successful writer/illustrator partnerships in children’s literature. We would
  like to hear your tributes to Allan Ahlberg. What are your favourite books and
