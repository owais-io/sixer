  The mezzanine floor of the Tampa Convention Center buzzes chaotically with
  rightwing chatter: conspiracy theories, grievance politics and Christian
  nationalism. Look in any direction and someone in front of you, washed in
  sharp studio lights, is drawing a crowd and creating content. Ahead of me,
  Russell Brand sits on a white sofa, broadcasting live on the conservative
  video-streaming service Rumble – his guest is the “alt-right” influencer Jack
  Posobiec. To the left, along an alleyway lined with small broadcast booths, is
  the longtime Donald Trump adviser and self-proclaimed “dirty trickster” Roger
  Stone, who is holding court on a podcast. To the rear, on a large metal
  scaffold, is Steve Bannon’s War Room channel, busy cutting between live
  footage of a small protest outside the event and adverts for various
  Trump-aligned products. The panorama serves as a realisation of one of
  Bannon’s notorious PR idioms: flooding the zone with shit. This is the Turning
  Point Student Action summit, an annual gathering targeted at gen Z
  conservatives, which draws thousands from across the US. It was a driving
  force in Trump’s success among younger male voters at the last election. In
  the arena next to the mezzanine, a conveyor belt of Maga superstars walk out
  to deliver keynote speeches, accompanied by spitting-flame cannon, pounding
  dubstep, spinning lasers and strobe lights. Brand delivers a bizarre diatribe
  – part standup comedy, part evangelical sermon – about his newfound conversion
  to Christianity in a word salad of alliteration and non sequiturs.
  Unsurprisingly, he makes no mention of the multiple rape and sexual assault
  charges he faces in the UK (to which he has pleaded not guilty). He is
  immediately followed by Tom Homan, Trump’s loudmouth border tsar, who is met
  with cries of “USA, USA!” as he refers to himself in the third person: “Tom
  Homan is running one of the biggest deportation operations this country has
  ever seen!” It is hard to keep up with this melange of fearmongering, severity
  and self-congratulation. It’s the epitome of Trump’s America. My colleague Tom
  Silverstone and I came here as the first stop on a journey across southern
  Florida. Once the quintessential swing state, it is now solidly Republican –
  and home to some of the president’s vast sources of personal wealth, including
  his beach club, Mar-a-Lago. It is also one of the hubs of his mass‑deportation
  programme. It seems no coincidence that the fast pace at Turning Point mirrors
  the first six months of Trump’s second term, which has lurched from scandal to
  extreme policy to blatant self-dealing at extraordinary speed – from the
  administration’s acceptance of a $400m luxury jet from the state of Qatar to
  his family’s creation of a private members’ club in Washington DC, charging
  $500,000 (£380,000) in fees. The apex of these brazen efforts to monetise the
  presidency is Trump’s venture into the world of cryptocurrency. He lauched his
  $TRUMP memecoin three days before he was sworn into office. These digital
  currencies have little to no financial use and are prone to rapid market
  fluctuations. Analysts estimate that the president’s family has netted about
  $315m since the venture launched into this volatile and speculative market and
  hundreds of thousands of investors have lost out. The whole episode lends
  itself to the argument that Trump’s return to power marks the advent of a
  second gilded age, last seen in the US after the civil war, when the
  unprecedented dominance of industry and technology led to rampant corruption
  and pronounced inequality. In May, some of the largest $TRUMP coin investors
  were invited to a dinner with the president at his Virginia golf course, then
  on a VIP tour of the White House, which some observers described as a blatant
  pay-to-play. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, has said that
  Trump abides by all conflict of interest laws “that are applicable to the
  president”. No one at Turning Point seems particularly concerned about any of
  these apparent grifts, though. Anthony Watson, a contributor, stands in the
  merchandise area of the convention, where limited-edition gold Trump golf
  shoes are $500. He flicks away my questions about the Qatari jet with little
  thought. “What’s wrong about accepting it?” he says, after I point out it
  might fall under the general definition of a bribe. “Well, what did they get
  in exchange? Until you know, it’s speculation.” I track down Stone to ask how
  he thinks the founding fathers, who authored the foreign emoluments clause of
  the US constitution to block corruption and limit foreign influence, might
  view Trump’s move into memecoin. “I don’t think they could envisage
  cryptocurrency, period, or the technological age that we’re in,” he says,
  dodging the question. Beyond sheer audacity, these money-making schemes also
  strike at a clear contradiction within the Maga movement and its America First
  agenda. While most remain anonymous, some of the largest investors in Trump’s
  memecoin have been revealed as foreign nationals, one with ties to the Chinese
  Communist party. How does that tally with America First? I address this
  question to Bannon, who greets me with a smile and professes his love of the
  Guardian, despite labelling us “fucking commies from England”. He is willing
  to acknowledge a degree of unease, particularly when I mention the Chinese
  Communist party. But he still finds a way of reconciling it, arguing that the
  VIP event at the White House underscored a drive for “entrepreneurial
  capitalism”. “I’ve just got so much on my plate right now, I just don’t even
  focus on the memecoins,” he says, adding that “the crypto thing is not at that
  big a level”. It seems to mark a turn for Bannon who, in 2019, described
  cryptocurrencies as having a “big future … in this global populist revolt” and
  – according to reporting by ABC News – partly took control of an
  anti-Joe-Biden memecoin in 2021, along with the Republican strategist Boris
  Epshteyn. He seems uneasy when I ask about this venture, named $FJB
  (officially Freedom Jobs Business, unofficially shorthand for Fuck Joe Biden),
  given allegations of missing funds, reported failures to donate promised money
  to charity and a potential examination by the US justice department (DoJ) in
  2023. “I think I put $500,000 into it,” Bannon recalls. Did he lose it all?
  “Yes. I think I lost all of it,” he says. He calls reports of a DoJ probe
  “fake news”. *** We leave Turning Point shortly after Bannon’s keynote
  address, which includes a flurry of praise for the immigration crackdown and
  receives a large round of applause. “Mass deportations now. Amnesty never,” he
  says. We drive about four hours south of Tampa to the centre of the
  Everglades, where a single‑lane highway is surrounded by cypress trees and
  mangroves. The administration’s immigration enforcement efforts are, in some
  ways, as brash and open as the Trump family’s presidential profit-making. Half
  a mile out, a large, newly installed bright-blue road sign announces we are
  approaching “Alligator Alcatraz”, a hastily constructed tent-like detention
  centre, surrounded by mosquito-infested swampland, about 50 miles outside
  Miami. In a calculated display of draconian showmanship, Trump toured the
  facility in July, seeming to revel in its harsh conditions. It has become a
  symbol of this era of removals. Of the 57,000 people detained by Immigration
  and Customs Enforcement, more than 70% have no criminal record. This morning,
  a small congregation of protesters stand by the roadside looking on in dismay.
  “This place is shameful,” reads one sign. I explain where we have come from in
  Tampa and ask how they think the centre they are protesting against is
  connected to my conversations about Trump’s self-enrichment at the convention.
  “It’s all part of the same thing,” says one older female protester. “For
  Trump, it’s about power and money. He’s doing everything he can to make money
  while he’s president. But he knows he has to be in power to maintain that, and
  this is all about power,” she says, gesturing towards the detention centre.
  “Power and fear.” A few minutes later, a white SUV emerges from a roadway
  leading to the centre. The car pulls over to a grassy embankment and a family
  emerges. They had tried to gain access to a relative named Martin Sanchez.
  They were blocked from entering. Sanchez, they tell me, has lived in the US
  without paperwork for the past 25 years, since coming from Mexico. He has two
  young children and no criminal record; he pays his taxes and works as a
  landscaper in the city of Palm Beach. He was arrested there four days earlier
  while on his way to work, mowing lawns. “He calls me a lot,” says his cousin
  Janet Garcia. “He hasn’t showered. They treat him like a prisoner. He got
  caught for working and that’s it.” She stares back towards the detention
  centre in the piercing sunlight. “Without immigrants, this country is gonna go
  down,” she says. “We have a felon in the White House, but the people they’ve
  got in here don’t even have a [traffic] ticket.” *** There is something stark
  about the location of Martin’s arrest. Palm Beach county, on Florida’s eastern
  coast, is the location of some of the most pronounced and expanding income
  disparities in the state. Average house prices here exceed the median income
  by six times. Known as the “Wall Street of the south”, its
  corporation-tax-friendly climate has drawn many of the world’s biggest finance
  groups and it is home to at least 67 billionaires. The highest profile of
  these is, of course, Trump, whose Mar-a-Lago club is situated on a tree-lined
  street by the sea. A year ago, it raised its annual membership fees to $1m. We
  drive to a food pantry a short distance from Trump’s club, where a line of
  about 20 people are waiting for the doors to open. A laminated sign on the
  wall warns that immigration officials will need a valid warrant to enter the
  premises and that the pantry, run by a local non-profit group, continues to
  serve people regardless of their legal status. The county has a significant
  population of people from Haiti, many of whom are under threat of deportation
  after Trump moved to end their temporary immigration protections, despite the
  security crisis in the country. “Some of them are afraid to come,” says a
  volunteer minister. “It’s hard, you can imagine. You have no food, but,
  because of your immigration status, you stay home.” The programme’s director,
  Ruth Mageria, shows me the large stockpiles of food in the fridges and tells
  me the pantry has seen a 71% increase in use over the past five years. Things
  are expected to get worse, as a spending bill passed by the
  Republican-controlled Congress and signed into law by Trump will cut basic
  food-assistance benefits for an estimated 22.3 million families across the
  country, while securing a host of tax cuts for the wealthy. The pantry has
  started preparing to ration its reserves. With a thunderstorm rolling in over
  the Atlantic and dark clouds forming like a tidal wave on the horizon, we seek
  out Mar-a-Lago. We stand on a bridge, on the newly renamed President Donald J
  Trump Boulevard, and look out over billionaires row. I’m reminded that this
  community was founded during the US’s first gilded age. It is an inauspicious
  end to this 400-mile journey across the state. The roads have emptied, but a
  small crew of landscapers, already drenched, are trimming the tall palms
  outside the club. • Oliver Laughland is the Guardian US’s southern bureau
