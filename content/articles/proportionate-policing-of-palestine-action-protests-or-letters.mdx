  Stella Creasy and Peter Hain make a very good argument for changes in the
  process of proscription and legislation on public order (We voted for and
  against the ban on Palestine Action. Now we have a plan to end this mess, 18
  August). They argue also for “police guidance … by setting out a test of
  proportionality for any interventions”. Leaving aside the expectation that our
  police forces already act in a proportionate manner (ie do not intentionally
  act disproportionately), there is existing guidance on proportionality. This
  is in the Crown Prosecution Service’s code for crown prosecutors, and it is
  but a small step to apply its principles to police interventions with a view
  to prosecution. The CPS code has a two-stage test, and both must be met before
  a prosecution can be brought. Stage one requires there to be a “realistic
  prospect of conviction” (ie evidential sufficiency), and stage two requires
  prosecution to be in the “public interest”. It is surely in the public
  interest that criminal prosecutions, which may result in severe penalties,
  should be proportionate – and it would be outwith the public interest for
  someone to be brought before a criminal court when such an action is
  disproportionate. It remains to be seen whether, and how, the CPS follows its
  own instructions (through the code) in the current cases. In the meantime, the
  police could bear this in mind when considering arrest, removal, detention,
  and preparation of a case for prosecution. Leslie Beaumont Croston, Lancashire
  • Stella Creasy and Peter Hain are right to underline what a mess the current
  situation is. The government’s fundamental mistake has been to attempt to
  address a problem of mob violence and other forms of relatively low-level but
  unpleasant intimidation by resorting to anti-terrorist legislation. At the
  same time, the Terrorism Act 2000 needed a complete overhaul long before the
  current controversy over Palestine Action. The act’s long list of proscribed
  organisations scarcely reflects the reality that this century, despite a few
  horrific cases of mass casualty terrorism, drunk-driving has posed a much
  greater threat to the lives of the British public than all the groups on this
  list put together. The same is even true of Northern Ireland. In the 12 months
  to March 2025, no one died as a result of the “security situation” in the
  province. Undeterred, the Home Office lists numerous terrorist groups in
  Northern Ireland, ignoring the fact that they are inactive, defunct, or have
  long been on ceasefire and decommissioned their weapons, or were only ever
  flags of convenience for larger organisations. But a more urgent fix is
  required immediately if the situation over Palestine Action is not to spiral
  out of control. The most practical is that it should be made clear by the
  government and the police that there will be no prosecutions under terrorism
  legislation that do not involve murder, attempted murder or steps towards that
  end. Adrian Guelke Belfast • I was unable to attend the recent Palestine
  Action support rally in London due to poor mobility. With further protests
  planned next month, I am thus asking the home secretary to facilitate the
  Metropolitan police in providing domiciliary arrests. I will willingly don my
  Plasticine Action T-shirt when receiving at home. Dr Richard Clubb London •
