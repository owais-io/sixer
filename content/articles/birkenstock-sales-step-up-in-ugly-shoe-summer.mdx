  Price rises and strong sales of closed-toe clogs helped the shoe maker
  Birkenstock beat profit expectations as it became the latest beneficiary of
  the “ugly shoe summer”. The German sandal maker said sales rose 16% in the
  three months to the end of June, if currency fluctuations were excluded. The
  average price of its products sold rose by about 5% and the number of items
  sold rose by about 8%. There was demand for its suede leather closed-toe
  Boston clogs, which sell for as much as £250 and generally cost more than the
  brand’s more well-known sandals, which are priced from £105 for a leather
  version. Total sales at the company, which listed on the US stock market in
  October 2023 valued at $7.5bn (£5.5bn), rose 12% to €635m (£546m) in the
  quarter with net profit up 73% to €129m. This summer there has been an upturn
  in popularity of quirky footwear, from rubber flip-flops to glove-like fitness
  shoes that fit each individual toe. However, the “ugly” footwear brand Crocs
  last week reported a 30% slump in sales amid new competition from split-toe
  shoes to flip-flops and Birkenstock’s clogs, which come in plastic as well as
  leather. Known for its cork-lined sandals, Birkenstock pledged to make its
  offering more varied, with more clogs, trainers, shoes and boots when it
  launched on the stock market. The company makes 95% of its shoes at its own
  factories in Germany. Its chief executive, Oliver Reichert, said it was
  “well-positioned to manage the impact” of new US import tariffs of 15% on
  goods imported from the EU. He said the higher costs would be managed through
  a combination of “pricing adjustment, cost discipline and inventory management
  to protect the long-term health and profitability of the Birkenstock brand”.
  Reichert said that the company was on track to achieve full-year sales growth
  at the top end of expectations of 15% to 17%.
