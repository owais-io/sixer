  Crystal Palace have reluctantly accepted Liverpool’s £35m offer for Marc
  Guéhi, with the England defender set to complete his medical on Monday and
  complete his long-anticipated move before the transfer deadline. It is
  understood that the Palace chairman, Steve Parish, had considered manager
  Oliver Glasner’s plea not to sell his captain on the final day of the transfer
  window because the FA Cup winners had not brought in a replacement in time.
  But having admitted after their victory over Arne Slot’s side in the Community
  Shield that he would probably have to be sold this month to avoid losing the
  25-year-old for free next summer, Parish dramatically agreed to sanction
  Guéhi’s departure hours before the 7pm deadline. Palace are set to announce
  the signing of 19-year-old Jaydee Canvot from Toulouse for £21m and are also
  working on deals to bring in a more experienced replacement for Guéhi,
  although a move to sign Brighton’s Igor Julio on loan has broken down despite
  the Brazilian having a medical on Monday ahead of a prospective move to
  Selhurst Park. That is not expected to have an impact on Guehi’s move to
  Anfield at this stage. Glasner is understood to be extremely unhappy that
  Parish has sanctioned his captain’s departure at such a late stage but there
  was a recognition that Palace could not afford to turn down such a large fee
  for a player who had entered the final 12 months of his contract. They
  rejected an offer worth up to £70m from Tottenham in January for the
  centre-back, and also turned down multiple offers from Newcastle last summer.
  Glasner said after the win over Aston Villa on Sunday in which Guéhi scored
  the visitors’ second goal that it would be up to Parish whether Palace give in
  to “temptation” and accept Liverpool’s bid. “We need to keep Marc if we want
  to have a successful season,” the Palace manager said. “We had a meeting in
  March and we have an agreement that we sell Marc if we have the right
  replacement in. There’s no replacement in the building so it’s clear one part
  of the agreement is not fulfilled. “I know if we don’t sell Marc, he would
  accept it because he loves Crystal Palace. It’s all about Crystal Palace’s
  future, about this season. We have such great times, maybe the most successful
  in the club’s history. And Marc is not just a small part of the puzzle.”
  Palace are also in talks with Tottenham over a loan move for Manor Solomon and
  are set to sign Nigeria forward Christantus Uche for €20m (£17.3m) from
  Getafe.
