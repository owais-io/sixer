  Toxic, carcinogenic pollution that pours from 25,000 road outflows into rivers
  in England is being ignored by politicians and regulators, MPs have been told.
  Road runoff containing toxic particles from tyres and brakes, and pollution
  from fuel and oil spills – which washes into rivers after rainfall – can
  devastate aquatic life and, by increasing toxicity, reduce the overall health
  of waterways. It is responsible for 18% of the reason all rivers fail to meet
  good ecological and chemical standards. But unlike sewage pollution from
  overflows, pollution from highways runoff is not regulated or monitored by the
  Environment Agency, despite obligations for the regulator to address sources
  of river pollution, MPs on the environmental audit committee were told. There
  is not a single permit for a highways discharge in England, unlike water
  company sewage outflows, which are monitored and regulated by the agency. Jo
  Bradley, director of operations at Stormwater Shepherds, told MPs that runoff
  from the road network was toxic, carcinogenic and contained heavy metals,
  hydrocarbons and microplastics. Of the 25,000 outflows from roads, she told
  MPs National Highways had identified 126 as high risk, and said they would
  attempt to mitigate the toxic pollution from them by 2030. But Bradley said:
  “All 25,000 of these outflows are causing toxic pollution every time it rains.
  While sewage pollution attracts all the attention and coverage – with £56bn
  earmarked to address it, just a few million is invested into addressing
  pollution from these 25,000 road outfalls. “This pollution contains
  microplastics, hydrocarbons, toxic metals and chemicals. It is carcinogenic,
  it gets into the water system … but no one is measuring these harms. No one is
  interested.” The Cunliffe review into the water sector does not significantly
  address the toxic pollution from road runoff, the committee heard. Bradley
  said it was important that this pollution was addressed in the white paper
  which would come from the review. The Guardian has mapped the 25,000 road
  runoff sites which release a toxic cocktail of damaging chemicals into
  England’s rivers. Catherine Moncrieff, head of policy and engagement at the
  Chartered Institution of Environmental and Water Management, told MPs the
  problem was flying under the radar. “The problem of highway pollution is
  increasing, the issue is getting worse.” The Environment Agency has said it
  does not regularly monitor runoff but recognised that runoff from highways and
  urban areas was a serious issue. Nick Harris, the chief executive of National
  Highways, said about 250 high-risk sites that needed mitigation by 2030 had
  been identified out of 1,236 outfalls that had been checked. He said so far 40
  sites had been worked on. “We should care very much about this pollution going
  into the environment,” he said. “The commitment we have made is to address the
  high-risk sites by 2030.”
