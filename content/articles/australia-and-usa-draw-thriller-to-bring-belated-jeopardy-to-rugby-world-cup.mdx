  Here was the captivating arm-wrestle we had been waiting for. Second place in
  Pool A behind England was probably on the line, and both teams gave everything
  in an utterly compelling match with a barely believable script. Neither
  deserved to lose, and if England comfortably defeat the Wallaroos next week,
  it should come down to points difference between these two sides for a place
  in the last eight. After Eva Karpani’s concluding try for Australia, Samantha
  Wood’s simple conversion chance could have won it five minutes from time, but
  she pulled it, in doing so arguably guaranteeing the right result. The
  precocious wing Desiree Miller and the 18-year-old full-back Caitlyn Halse
  both scored twice for the Wallaroos, while Freda Tafuna was credited with a
  hat-trick, although the No 6 said the third was scored by Hope Rogers. A late
  try by Erica Jarrell-Searcy, plus that disputed fifth, looked to have won it
  for the USA before Karpani’s try levelled it. Australia face England next
  Saturday while the USA have a less demanding task against Samoa, against whom
  the Wallaroos racked up a 73-0 score. “Bittersweet,” said Sione Fukofuka, the
  USA head coach. “We did everything to get back in the game, gave ourselves an
  opportunity to close it out … Really proud of the players to work back in the
  game but really disappointed that’s how it ended. We’re hoping England can put
  a pretty good performance in [against Australia], and we get a chance to rack
  up some points against Samoa.” Jo Yapp, Australia head coach, was similarly
  conflicted. “Many mixed emotions,” she said. “A little bit flat and
  disappointed, really. We had opportunities to win but the discipline in the
  second half cost us … It [qualification] is in our hands. We’ll go into that
  England game knowing exactly what we need to do.” Steel-grey skies and teeming
  rain made for a traditionally English occasion. It felt more winter than late
  summer and the early skirmishes were suitably uncompromising, juddering
  tackles and fierce breakdown duels all over. Miller soon dotted down the first
  try, continuing her red-hot form after a hat-trick against Samoa. Ilona Maher,
  meanwhile, was playing like someone who didn’t fancy informing her Instagram
  followers about another defeat. The centre carried with power and intensity
  and was a breakdown menace. When Keia Mae Sagapolu pouched a lineout and broke
  through, she found the captain Kate Zackary, and Tafuna eventually came up
  with the ball. McKenzie Hawkins lingered over the conversion, though, and ran
  out of time. That felt significant, and Australia finished the half in the
  ascendancy, Hulse torpedoing under the posts to create a nine-point half-time
  lead. It was now or never for the USA. Cheta Emba attacked on the right, Erica
  Coulibaly made progress on the left and Sagapolu forced her way over with a
  brilliant close-range finish. Hawkins’ kick bounced off both posts and out.
  But the Americans were unbowed. Maher, a force of nature at the breakdown,
  brought a penalty and after Hawkins kicked for the corner Tafuna finished off
  a powerful drive. The celebrations were riotous, even more so when Hawkins
  nailed a difficult kick to create a three-point lead. Momentum shifted? Not so
  fast. Miller burned across again for her fifth try of the tournament with
  Australia’s next attack, Wood missing the conversion, before a scrum penalty
  and lovely hands put Hulse over again and the bonus point for the Wallaroos.
  Nine points in it. Jarrell-Searcy’s clever pick and go along with the fifth
  try, disputed between Tafuna and Rogers, put Fukofuka’s side back in control.
  “I did my part, but Hope Rogers deserves that credit, and I want to give it to
  her,” Tafuna said. Wood should have won it for Australia after Karpani’s
  concluding score, but the drama will go down to the final day after this
  magnificent encounter. “I’m pretty chuffed,” said Miller after her fourth and
  fifth try of her debut World Cup. “All that stuff’s great, but at the end of
  the day it’s about the team, and it just sucks that we couldn’t get the win.”
  Maher, meanwhile, said of her outstanding performance: “I’m excited about the
  turnovers … and I tried to get the ball in my hands a couple of times. Yeah,
  it was cool. All or nothing, really, huh? We’ve got to leave it all out there
  [next week] or we’re not going to play again … we have to beat them with a
  great margin.” Fukofuka said of Maher: “She played tough, didn’t she? I’d love
  to give her more ball in space, and hopefully we’ll get that opportunity next
  week. What you saw out there is a tough rugby player.” The USA kick off
  against Samoa at 1.30pm next Saturday, here in York, before England face
  Australia at 5pm in Brighton. “We have to put points on and hopefully England
  really give it to Australia,” said Maher. You want jeopardy? Well there it is.
