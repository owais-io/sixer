  When a musician disappears from the public view, most of us would hope they’ve
  simply opted for a quieter life, rather than struggling in obscurity or
  walking a darker path into the ugly morass of showbiz. I’m glad that Pete
  Doherty swapped “crack for camembert” and that Elton John opted for sobriety –
  though surviving addiction has given John a unique perspective on many things,
  including toddler tantrums, as he wrote in his memoir: “You think you’re being
  difficult, my little sausage? Have I ever told you about the time I drank
  eight vodka martinis, took all my clothes off in front of a film crew and then
  broke my manager’s nose?” So it was with a strange sense of relief that I
  watched this week’s Australian Story about Alex Lloyd, the singer-songwriter
  behind the 2001 elegiac pop hit Amazing. Twenty-five years ago, it was hard to
  avoid Lloyd, who has sold more than 1m albums, or Amazing, which was a
  once-in-a-decade crossover hit that topped the Triple J Hottest 100, was
  thrashed on commercial radio and eventually went where all good pop songs go
  to die: television advertising. (Last year, someone even edited Amazing’s
  Wikipedia page to describe it as “the song from the Woolworths ad that makes
  everyone want to kill themselves”.) Some of what happened to Lloyd after
  Amazing is already known: he moved overseas, had children, recorded more
  albums, then he seemed to disappear. But Australian Story revealed what
  happened before his rapid rise in his 20s. His memories of the domestic
  violence his mother endured. How he’d wander the streets of Sydney singing to
  himself before finding a childhood career in busking. His retreat into food
  for comfort. His mother’s sudden death from cancer when he was 16. Sign up for
  our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every
  Saturday morning We also learned more about what came after. In 2009 Lloyd was
  accused of stealing the lyrics of Amazing by another musician, who claimed he
  co-wrote the song with Lloyd soon after his mother died. But Lloyd’s accuser
  got the year she died wrong, and withdrew his claim soon after the case
  reached court. Lloyd was awarded full costs, but it left him $300,000 out of
  pocket and forced him to revisit his childhood trauma – which, he says in the
  episode, “just comes and bites you in the arse”. Lloyd’s marriage
  disintegrated. He binge drank and comfort ate; at his biggest, he weighed
  168kg. He developed nerve pain due to a lack of cartilage between two of his
  vertebrae and was prescribed oxycodone. The drug “was fucking awesome – too
  awesome,” Lloyd recalls with a dry laugh. Things improved briefly: he stopped
  drinking, started running – and became addicted. “I had no idea what I was
  getting into on that drug … I tried to get off it myself so many times.” Lloyd
  remains on buprenorphine, an opioid replacement. “I still have to take a
  little bit just to feel mentally OK,” he says. “And that’s pretty sad.”
  Celebrity culture remains frighteningly inhumane, but Lloyd’s Australian Story
  episode is a heartening reminder of how far we’ve come since the 2000s, during
  his first turn at fame. For the most part, we remember famous people are
  people too; it is a rare celebrity who doesn’t admit to some kind of anxiety
  in interview. At the peak of his success, Lloyd recalls being “scared
  shitless” and masking his anxiety with alcohol. “We didn’t have a name for
  that stuff at that time,” he says. “You just had to man up, that was it.” But
  the most touching part of the episode is the spirit of generosity that
  pervades it. Lloyd is clearly distressed while standing outside his childhood
  home, but he persists anyway “because there’s a lot of kids who get fucked up
  by this”. He now volunteers with kids who have survived trauma. “I don’t
  pretend to be someone who understands how to deal with childhood trauma; I’m
  just someone who’s been through it,” he says, as if this was nothing. While
  his speech now sounds a little more fragile, Lloyd’s singing voice remains
  strong. His first studio album in 12 years is coming out later this year. His
  friend and broadcaster Adam Spencer speculates that the episode airing “is
  going to be a massive part of his healing”. Anyone watching this tremendous
  act of bravery would say: welcome back Alex Lloyd – and we hope it is.
