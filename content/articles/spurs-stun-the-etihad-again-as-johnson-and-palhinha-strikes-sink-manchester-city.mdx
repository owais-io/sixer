  How to rally Tottenham after the Eberechi Eze farrago: turn up at Manchester
  City and mastermind a dominant 2-0 triumph that takes your side to the top of
  the Premier League – for a few hours at least. By doing so Thomas Frank issued
  a fine calling card regarding his professionalism, and suggested his Spurs
  project will be as strategic as Ange Postecoglou’s was gung-ho. Witnessing how
  the visitors caused Pep Guardiola’s men headaches caused one wag to question
  if Eze might change his mind (again) about which club to join. Spurs missed a
  number of chances but were far more cutthroat than their hosts, as Brennan
  Johnson and João Palhinha’s first-half goals took the points back to north
  London. Two illustrations: towards the end, Jérémy Doku wriggled through and
  found his fellow substitute Phil Foden but Micky van de Ven chopped the ball
  away; moments after, Bernardo Silva headed on to the roof of the net. City
  were just not allowed to enjoy any rhythm. Instead they were a discordant
  bunch who kept finding a Spurs player rushing up to undermine their composure.
  “Good vibes” was Guardiola’s description of the mood as City hoped to banish
  the spectre of last November’s 4-0 humiliation here by Spurs, though an ill
  augury came in a Rico Lewis-James Trafford mix-up. Hesitation between the
  right-back and the new goalkeeper, preferred to Ederson, allowed Richarlison
  to pounce. While City escaped, Trafford’s performance was one to watch. Omar
  Marmoush fashioned an opening when Erling Haaland lit up the contest with a
  bulldozing run that splayed those in black. After a lucky ricochet when
  challenged, the centre-forward slipped in the Egyptian: he took a glance and
  unloaded but Guglielmo Vicario repelled the shot. Guardiola always enthuses
  about Frank’s managerial smarts and 35 minutes in the Dane showed how he
  already has Spurs drilled. Along the right Mohammed Kudus outfoxed Rúben Dias
  and put Richarlison through. The Brazilian ran forward, squared for Johnson
  and the forward beat Trafford: the shot was close to the keeper but was hit
  hard so he may claim mitigation if Guardiola scolds him about it. The flag
  went up but the semi-automatic offside technology showed Richarlison had been
  onside. The goal stood, and Spurs’ celebrations were soon to double. Now,
  Trafford’s shakiness came home to roost. The keeper dawdled when playing out,
  finally plumping for Nico González. The midfielder did not want it delivered
  close to his penalty spot anyway but Trafford passed only to Pape Matar Sarr
  and the ball went to Richarlison. He tried to shoot and failed, though the
  excellent Palhinha did, driving the ball home on his full debut. City were a
  mess and Guardiola’s decision to choose Trafford over Ederson cast as quaint,
  however the Brazilian views his future (he may leave for Galatasaray) – he is
  still an employee, after all. The disarray of those in blue was summed up by
  two moments at the other end. Attack is supposed to be their forte. But first
  Rayan Cherki aped a pub footballer by hitting the first defender from a
  corner; then Haaland headed the same player’s delivery to the heavens with
  Vicario’s goal gaping. City’s backline had been disrupted by the 23rd-minute
  injury to Rayan Aït-Nouri but he was replaced by Nathan Aké, a treble-winner,
  so this offered no excuse for a first-half horror show. The next time Trafford
  took control with Spurs at close quarters he coolly launched a 50-yard pass
  for Marmoush, but the wideman slipped and Guardiola spun away in disgust. The
  reaction showed how bitty his side’s patterns were. At play in Spurs’
  ascendancy was City’s greater ball share (60-40) not transmitting into the
  relentless pass and move of their finest years. Instead of fluency,
  Guardiola’s men hoped to prosper on scraps and moments. One came when Vicario
  did an unwitting impression of Trafford: the keeper passed sideways to Van de
  Ven, who must have cursed the Italian as he had Oscar Bobb for company. The
  Norwegian pilfered possession and tapped to Haaland, who passed to Cherki; at
  close range the Frenchman went to pull the trigger but Palhinha, Spurs’ star
  act, snuffed out the danger. Guardiola began the day with no Foden, Rodri,
  Silva, Doku and Ederson (all substitutes), or Manuel Akanji (left out
  completely for tactical reasons), yet could still field Haaland, Cherki,
  Marmoush, Tijjani Reijnders and Bobb. By the 54th minute Cherki and Marmoush
  were hooked – for Silva and Doku – and still City were amateurish. For
  example, at a corner the ball popped up sweetly for Lewis to let fly from
  outside the area – he did, into the gods. In the 74th minute Foden and Rodri
  wandered on – the Spaniard for his first action since being injured in City’s
  4-3 defeat against Al-Hilal at the Club World Cup in early July. Instantly,
  Rodri leaped to meet a corner but headed the ball into Vicario’s gloves.
