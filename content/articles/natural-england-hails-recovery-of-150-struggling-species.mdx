  England needs a massive “collective endeavour” to halt the country’s nature
  decline, its top conservation official says, after multimillion-pound
  investments in nature helped dormice, voles, willow tits and other species
  thrive. Targeted conservation projects led by Natural England as part of its
  £13m species recovery programme’s capital grants scheme, have supported the
  recovery of 150 species, according to findings published on Wednesday. As part
  of the work, conservationists relocated more than 15,000 individual animals
  and plants to expand species’ territories, and bred more than 12,000
  individual invertebrates, mammals and birds in captivity for release into the
  wild. According to Natural England, rare species have returned to areas they
  have not been seen in for generations. In Hastings, East Sussex, the rare
  hawksbeard mining bee was discovered for the first time in a century buzzing
  between blooms in newly created wildflower meadows. In Northamptonshire,
  Cheshire, Nottinghamshire and Warwickshire, projects created new wetlands,
  ponds and bankside habitats for water voles, including 420 that were
  captive-bred and released to help increase population numbers. In Kent, a
  chough chick hatched for the first time in 200 years thanks to an extensive
  captive breeding programme and supervised release. In total, projects have
  created or enhanced over 2,400 hectares (5,930 acres) of wildlife-rich
  habitat, Natural England said. The agency is holding a celebration event on
  Wednesday at Brandon Marsh in Warwickshire, where the once rare Eurasian
  bittern is making a recovery with the help of a new habitat of deep pools and
  reedbeds created as part of the species recovery programme. In a keynote
  speech hailing the success of the programme, Natural England’s chair, Tony
  Juniper, will say the successes show what is possible with a “joined up,
  collaborative approach” to conservation. “We know we can turn round species
  decline and improve ecosystems with the right targeted actions, the drive and
  the funding,” he is expected to say. “But time is running out fast – turning
  round nature’s decline needs to be a collective endeavour, so this is not just
  the preserve of dedicated specialists. Nature recovery work needs more
  projects, more volunteers and more money to flow from all sources,
  particularly the private sector. It will also need to go hand in hand with
  improved environmental quality, including through reduced pollution.”
  Centuries of industrialisation and intensive agricultural practices have left
  the UK one of the world’s most nature-depleted countries, with thousands of
  once endemic species no longer to be found, and thousands more on the brink of
  extinction. Similar processes now accelerating around the globe have led to
  ecologists warning the world is on the brink of ecosystem collapse, with
  urgent action needed to reverse course. To support this crucial work in the
  UK, Natural England is publishing a threatened species recovery actions guide,
  which will address the needs of more than 1,000 of England’s most threatened
  species. Natural England plans to extend the species recovery programme for up
  to four years to act on its recommendations. The agency is calling for mass
  participation from the public. Already, more than 80,000 people have taken
  part in 465 educational events and activities, and volunteers contributed
  nearly 100,000 hours of conservation work worth over £1m. “The publication of
  the government’s revised environmental improvement plan in the autumn will be
  a key moment,” Juniper will say. “We will need to see increased ambition on
  species recovery, particularly looking at what can be done on some of our lost
  species. In the coming years, habitat management and creation alongside
  species reintroductions could be a real gamechanger for the health of
  ecosystems and help us achieve the country’s legally binding targets.”
