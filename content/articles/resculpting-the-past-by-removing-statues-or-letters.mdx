  You published a letter from someone wishing to remove a statue of Clive of
  India (18 August) on the same day as a story that Donald Trump is seeking to
  suppress “signs or other information that are negative about either past or
  living Americans” (Trump’s move to sanitize US history gets little support
  with national park visitors, 18 August). The motives are different, but the
  effect of the dismantling of a statue of Clive would be to remove from public
  view something drawing attention to the worst aspect of British dealings with
  India (and the statue is the only thing that most passersby will come across
  that does this). The proposed removal therefore seems to me to be open to the
  same objection as the US president’s attempts to prettify the grimmer aspects
  of American history. Jeremy Paul Dixon Addiscombe, Surrey • Oh dear! “Clive’s
  not welcome”. My namesakes and I will feel excluded and lonely. I propose an
  anti-imperialist mutual support group to reclaim our name. “Clives Against
  Clive” anyone? Clive Barrett Leeds
