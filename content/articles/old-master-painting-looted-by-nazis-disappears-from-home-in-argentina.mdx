  Argentinian police have said they will continue hunting for an old master
  painting looted by the Nazis and spotted by chance in an estate agent’s
  listing after a search of the property in the seaside town of Mar del Plata
  failed to uncover the work. “The painting is not in the house ... but we’re
  going to keep searching for it,” the federal prosecutor Carlos Martínez told
  local media. He said items that could be useful for the investigation,
  including two firearms, engravings and prints, had been seized. Citing
  investigators, the Argentinian newspaper La Nación reported that the missing
  work, Portrait of a Lady by the Italian master Giuseppe Ghislandi, was no
  longer hanging in the living room of the house, where it had been in the
  estate agency photo. In its place was “a generously dimensioned tapestry of a
  landscape and horses” that, marks on the wall suggested, had recently replaced
  another work. “Where we found a tapestry, not long ago, there was something
  else,” a police officer told the paper. Portrait of a Lady belonged to Jacques
  Goudstikker, a leading Jewish art dealer in Amsterdam who died in May 1940
  fleeing the invading Nazis. His collection of more than 1,100 artworks, many
  of them classed as old masters, was acquired for a tiny fraction of its value
  by Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring. The Dutch newspaper AD reported this week
  that it had uncovered documents suggesting that by the end of war the
  Ghislandi portrait had fallen into the hands - it is not clear how – of
  Friedrich Kadgien, a high-ranking Nazi official, SS member and one-time senior
  aide to Göring. The painting is thought to have accompanied Kadgien when he
  fled the Netherlands in 1946, first to Switzerland, then Brazil and finally to
  Argentina. It is believed to have remained in his family’s possession after he
  died in Buenos Aires in 1978. Authorities have said one of Kadgien’s two
  daughters, who owns the Plata del Mar house, and her partner were the subjects
  of a judicial investigation after complaints filed by the federal police,
  Interpol and Argentina’s customs agency, ARCA. The complaints were prompted by
  the publication of the AD articles, which the Dutch paper said followed an
  investigation during which it several times contacted the late Nazi’s
  daughters, who declined to talk about their father or the artwork. The paper
  eventually sent a reporter to Argentina who discovered that a house owned by
  one of the daughters was for sale and spotted the potentially incriminating
  photograph of the portrait on the website of the estate agency handling the
  property. AD reported on Wednesday that the property had since been taken off
  the site by the agency, Robles Casas &amp; Campos, which confirmed it was no
  longer on their books, and that Kadgien’s daughter had changed her user name
  on social media. La Nación reported that it understood no charges had yet been
  brought, but that if the couple were found to have had the work in their
  possession, they could face possible prosecution for concealing criminal
  property, with no statute of limitations applying because the alleged offence
  took place in wartime.
