  Guardian writers’ predicted position: 9th (NB: this is not necessarily Tom
  Garry’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips) Last season’s
  position: 7th Prospects Liverpool are entering a new era after choosing Gareth
  Taylor as their head coach in August, hoping he will bring success in the long
  term and help build an identity for how they want to play. The former
  Manchester City head coach’s appointment came 162 days after Liverpool’s
  former manager Matt Beard left, after an extensive recruitment process than
  the Guardian understands took much longer than usual because of a clause with
  Taylor’s previous contract, after Taylor had been identified earlier in the
  summer as the No 1 target. It was the first major coaching appointment
  overseen by the managing director, Andy O’Boyle, who arrived in April,
  replacing Russ Fraser. After an unexpected fourth-placed finish in 2024,
  Liverpool ended last term seventh and they are hoping to improve on that and
  start building towards challenging for trophies again after making their fans
  wait for success for far too long; they have not achieved a top-three finish
  since winning back-to-back WSL titles in 2013 and 2014. Liverpool are one of
  only four clubs to have won the WSL but over the past decade there have been
  big question marks about the wider club’s ambition for the women’s team, who
  have been operating with a far smaller budget than the top sides. This summer
  they sold Olivia Smith for a then world-record fee of £1m, breaking a historic
  barrier, but it remains to be seen how they intend to spend that money, making
  predictions difficult about their campaign until the transfer window closes on
  Thursday. They are yet to replace Smith with a statement signing. The manager
  Taylor, the former Wales, Nottingham Forest and Sheffield United player, spent
  five years at City where he came mighty close to a league title, missing out
  on goal difference in the 2023-24 campaign. In another second-placed finish in
  2020-21, his side lost one league game. He won an FA Cup and a League Cup, and
  Liverpool are understood to have admired his possession-based style. Can he
  replicate that successfully with a squad not blessed with the same world-class
  talent? Off-field picture Liverpool have announced a trio of league fixtures
  that will be staged at Anfield, including their season-opening local derby
  against Everton on 7 September, and the rest of their home matches will be
  played at their regular home in St Helens, which offers a good level of
  facilities for their fans compared with many others in the WSL. The players
  have a top-class training environment at Melwood but the fans will wantFenway
  Sports Group to invest more in the squad after years of comparatively frugal
  spending has left them miles behind clubs such as Arsenal and Chelsea. Star
  signing Could the answer change before the window shuts? So far, Liverpool’s
  best move has been to make the loan of the Scotland midfielder Sam Kerr a
  permanent transfer from Bayern Munich, and they have also signed the Rangers
  academy graduate Kirsty Maclean and picked up two astute free signings in the
  Wales defender Lily Woodham – who is likely to fill the gap on the left
  created by the exit of Hinds – and the German goalkeeper Rafaela Borggräfe.
  But none of those have made a sizeable dent into the £1m received for the sale
  of Smith. Stepping up Mia Enderby, frequently impressive for England’s youth
  teams throughout the age groups, is one of Liverpool’s brightest young
  prospects and, at the age of 20, this could be the season when she goes from
  being a player with potential to being a star of the present. In July the
  former Sheffield United forward signed a new contract and Liverpool could
  certainly benefit from more goals: they were the third-lowest scorers in the
  WSL last season and they have not had a player reach a double-figure goals
  tally in the top division since Courtney Sweetman-Kirk hit 10 in 2018-19. It
  was a good summer for … Gemma Evans and Ceri Holland were part of the Wales
  squad that contested their first major women’s international tournament, but
  there are no senior England players in the Liverpool squad. It was a surprise
  that the forward Sophie Roman Haug was left out of the Norway squad for the
  Euros and she could have a point to prove this season. The vast majority of
  the Liverpool squad were able to have a summer break for rest, recovery and
  then a full pre-season, which could benefit them. Main initiative to attract
  more fans A big shift over the past six months has been an attempt to change
  the playing style and make the team’s tactics potentially attract more fans
  through the turnstiles; the largest element of that hinged on the recruitment
  of a new head coach, so a lot rests on the success of Taylor and his coaching
  staff. The club have chosen their home league fixture against Everton,
  Manchester City and Arsenal to be staged at Anfield.
