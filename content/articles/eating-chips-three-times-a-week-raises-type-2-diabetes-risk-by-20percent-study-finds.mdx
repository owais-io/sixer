  Love potatoes? Well, there’s good news and there’s bad news. Eating chips
  frequently has been linked to a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes
  compared with baking, boiling or mashing the tuber. Consuming french fries
  three times a week increases the chances of someone getting the disease by 20%
  – and doing so five times a week by 27% – according to a study published in
  the British Medical Journal. Globally, potatoes are the third most commonly
  consumed food crop, after rice and wheat. Nine out of 10 of the estimated 5.8
  million people in the UK with diabetes have the type 2 version of the disease,
  which is closely associated with lifestyle, especially diet. The findings
  confirm potatoes do not of themselves pose a danger to health, but frying them
  to turn them into chips, and eating them regularly, does make a diagnosis of
  type 2 diabetes more likely. An international team of researchers, led by
  Seyed Mohammad Mousavi, a public health expert at Harvard University,
  investigated the relationship between potato intake and the risk of developing
  type 2 diabetes. They based their findings on food questionnaires filled out
  by 205,000 health professionals in the US every four years between 1984 and
  2021. Someone who eats chips three times a week was found to raise their risk
  of diabetes by 20%, but those who ate potatoes with the same regularity after
  baking, boiling or mashing them did so by only 5%. “The high starch content of
  potatoes, leading to a high glycemic index and load, combined with possible
  loss of nutrients and possible health risks resulting from various cooking
  methods, could contribute to adverse health outcomes,” the study explains.
  Replacing potatoes with whole grains lowers the risk of diabetes by 8%, and if
  grains are eaten instead of chips specifically, that cuts the risk by 19%. Dr
  Kawther Hashem, a lecturer in public health nutrition at Queen Mary University
  of London, said: “Potatoes can be part of a healthy diet, but it’s how we
  prepare them that makes the difference. Boiled, baked or mashed potatoes are
  naturally low in fat and a source of fibre, vitamin C and potassium. “But when
  we deep fry them into chips or french fries, especially in large portions and
  with added salt, they become less healthy with their high-fat, salt and
  calorie content that’s much more likely to contribute to weight gain and
  increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.” However, replacing any form of potatoes
  with white rice is a bad idea as it leads to an increased risk of type 2
  diabetes, the paper found. Dr Hashem added: “This research reinforces the
  simple message, which is to enjoy potatoes – just don’t rely on chips as your
  go-to option. And, where possible, try swapping them out for whole grains like
  brown rice, bulgur wheat, wholemeal pasta or even sweet potato with skin on,
  which are healthier and protective for long-term health.” The researchers
  stressed their findings were observational and did not prove a cause and
  effect relationship between eating chips and type 2 diabetes risk. The Food
  Standards Agency and Department of Health and Social Care both declined to
  comment.
