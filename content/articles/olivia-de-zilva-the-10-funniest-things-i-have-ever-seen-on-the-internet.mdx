  As a perpetually lonely child in the planned suburbs of Adelaide, I grew up on
  the internet. The first memory I have of accessing YouTube was waiting three
  days for my dial-up internet to load Vanessa Hudgen’s music video for Come
  Back to Me. It cost my parents a lot of money, but I couldn’t resist the pull
  of funny cat videos, Sims 2 music videos and early era TMZ. Before I learned
  how to read novels, I read trash magazines back to front. I didn’t know what a
  verb was but I could detail a blind item from back to front. As a child, I was
  diagnosed with selective mutism and the only way I could communicate was
  through re-enacting celebrity drama I saw on the internet or television. I
  probably needed a therapist, but in the end, it all kind of worked out? As a
  writer, celebrity drama and gossip is what gave me a voice, and my somewhat
  real, somewhat fictional novel, Plastic Budgie is a love letter to all of the
  popular culture that made me laugh, warped my brain and annoyed the people
  around me. Some people would say that mentioning celebrities and reality TV in
  your work makes it lowbrow, but I disagree. I think it provides a unique
  intertextuality that can draw a reader into a familiar and engaging world. 1.
  “Wait, what was that? OK … James –” When the Wendy Williams Show YouTube
  channel was taken down, it was worse than the burning of the Library of
  Alexandria. This clip, according to Wikipedia, has been used in more than
  100,000 TikTok videos because of how iconic it is. I would say that this
  moment is the closest Wendy’s ever come to dropping her Truman Show act. The
  genuine fear in her eyes when she spots the zombie in the crowd, her calling
  for the omnipotent “James” – this was the first moment where we saw Wendy
  really out of character. In these eight seconds, you see so many emotions:
  fear, anxiety, stress, shame, confusion. Ask me the Lord’s Prayer and I
  couldn’t recite a single word. Ask me to recite this video and I’d go straight
  to heaven. 2. War of the Worlds (2025) I actually related a lot to this movie,
  because I also find that using Microsoft Teams can lead to world devastation
  and destruction. In his 1938 radio adaptation of War of the Worlds, Orson
  Welles used radio and the news to frighten people into thinking there was an
  alien invasion. In this iteration, Ice Cube uses Teams to invoke an immediate
  trauma response in all white-collar workers around the globe – and not just
  because of the aliens. Honestly, I love how this movie’s whole budget was
  basically used on Getty Images and stock footage, which could only be recouped
  from egregious amounts of product placement from Amazon. It was basically a
  long gif with random things happening and I’m not complaining. 3. Who? Weekly
  A them = Academy Award winner George Clooney. A who = Bindi Irwin’s influencer
  cousin. Who? Weekly got me through Covid, copious amounts of depression and
  hours of looking at spreadsheets. Ranking and discussing D-list celebrities is
  actually an art form. Who? Weekly has kept me informed on so many world
  issues, such as Katy Perry’s failed space shuttle mission, who Ana de Armas is
  dating and what Rita Ora is up to. The fringes of Hollywood are far more
  entertaining than the bright lights. 4. Club Chalamet Club Chalamet has been
  an integral part of Stan X for years now. Her subtweets about Timmy’s
  squeezes, the ride-or-die mentality when watching the Wonka movie and
  continuing to tweet about his Oscar campaign after her house burned down is
  really something to marvel at. I have never put this much effort into anything
  – not even my own career – so to see Club have this level of devotion and
  loyalty to someone she doesn’t know is really quite something. 5. Natalie
  Portman updates God truly gives his hardest battles to his strongest soldiers.
  I love how @natalieportmanupdates continued to post through all of the pain –
  truly an icon. I wish I could end every email with, “I feel like shit
  #natalieportman”. 6. Kourtney and Kim Take Miami Season 3 People laud shows
  like Succession and the Sopranos for their complex takes on family dynamics
  and patriarchy. When I say Kourtney and Kim Take Miami Season 3 has the same
  implications, I get scoffed at. I have a strong feeling that this is where
  television writers go to get their Emmy-winning material. I love the absurdity
  (Kim taking her cat to the club), the twists and turns (Scott becoming an
  alligator farmer) and Kim’s face when Kourtney loses her temper at Jonathan
  Cheban, AKA The Food God, for speaking on family business. The Kardashians are
  so subdued now and I really do miss this era of messiness and unadulterated
  drama. If I could relive anything, it would be to watch Kourtney and Kim Take
  Miami Season 3 for the first time again. 7. “Not even to dinner with the
  Kushners.” Project Runway has blessed the world with some of the nastiest
  reads on television. “Not even to dinner with the Kushners?” should be put in
  the Oxford Dictionary as one of the most famous phrases of all time. The drag!
  The snark! The head tilt! The gasping! When I first heard this phrase, I knew
  straight away that it would be in my head until I die. 8. Stefani Germanotta
  You Will Never Be Famous The now-deleted “Stefani Germanotta You Will Never Be
  Famous” Facebook group is a metaphor for never giving up on your dreams.
  Although people were hating on Stefani (AKA Lady Gaga) like it was a
  professional sport, she still rose above it and became a triple threat in
  singing, dancing and acting. Is anyone in that Facebook group now a Tony away
  from becoming an Egot? I don’t think so. 9. Wendy Williams: ‘The Killer’
  compilation I’ve included Wendy twice on this list because I honestly miss her
  so much. I love how she talked about “The Killer” – a catch-all term she
  frequently used – as if she meant one guy. How did he come to be? Why is Wendy
  so afraid? What does she know that we don’t? The Killer even has a listing on
  Villains Wiki, as a “mysterious entity” whose sole purpose is to haunt Wendy
  Williams. 10. Melody stealing the spotlight from Nicole I hate how the
  Pussycat Dolls were always positioned as “Nicole and the girls.” There were so
  many talents in that group, especially Melody who the internet claimed was
  locked in a cupboard at the AMAs so Nicole could sing the hook of Buttons
  instead of her. I love how Melody (allegedly) broke free, entered from the
  wings and took centre stage. The shady camera man was working overtime here.
  But again, this is why you don’t ever give up on your dreams. Olivia De Zilva
  is a writer based in Adelaide. Her novel Plastic Budgie is our now and her
  novella Eggshell will be released in late 2025. You can find her at
