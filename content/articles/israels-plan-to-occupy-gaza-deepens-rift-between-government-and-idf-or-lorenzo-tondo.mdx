  Israel’s decision to approve a plan to occupy the Gaza Strip has reportedly
  deepened tensions between the government and the country’s military
  leadership, while also exposing fresh fractures within the army’s senior ranks
  and straining relations with reservists summoned for what could become the
  most dangerous phase of the war. According to Israeli media reports, a
  bruising week of leaks and public recriminations has laid bare the rift
  between Israel’s political leaders and its military high command. “This is the
  most severe crisis in the history of relations between the political echelon
  and the military since the 1948 war,” said Prof Yagil Levy, the head of the
  Institute for the Study of Civil-Military Relations at the Open University of
  Israel. “Never before has the political leadership compelled the military to
  execute an operation it adamantly opposed.” In the seven days leading up to
  the pivotal meeting of Israel’s security cabinet at which the plan was
  approved, the chief of staff, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, had repeatedly voiced his
  misgivings over the move to fully occupy the territory, warning that taking
  over Gaza would plunge Israel into a “black hole” of prolonged insurgency,
  humanitarian responsibility and heightened risk to hostages. Zamir’s dissent
  ignited a political storm, with the son of the prime minister, Benjamin
  Netanyahu, accusing the army’s chief of staff of mutiny. Israel’s far-right
  national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, urged the chief of staff to
  “clearly state he will fully comply with the political leadership’s
  instructions, even if the decision is to occupy Gaza”. Some Israeli reports
  suggested Zamir could resign. Over the course of the war, Israel’s military
  and intelligence leadership has already been shaken by a series of
  high-profile departures: Zamir’s predecessor as chief of staff, Herzi Halevi,
  and the former head of the Shin Bet security service, Ronen Bar, were both
  manoeuvred into resigning. Senior commanders including Aharon Haliva, Yaron
  Finkelman, Oded Basyuk and Eliezer Toledano have also stepped down, alongside
  top figures in military intelligence and the Shin Bet. Since its founding in
  1948, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has been more than a military
  organisation; it has been woven into the country’s national identity, hailed
  as a near-sacred institution, the ultimate guarantor of the state’s survival
  and a living symbol of the collective spirit that forged the nation. The
  Israeli public has long been united in its support of the army. A clash
  between the military leadership and the government, analysts warn, could have
  irreparable consequences for public support for the Israeli administration. A
  dispute between the army leadership and the government “could intensify public
  protest, fuelled both by concern for the hostages and by the fact that, until
  now, the military had provided legitimacy for continuing the war,” said Levy.
  According to Yedioth Ahronoth, one of Israel’s largest newspapers, the
  military’s divisions run not only between the government and the IDF’s senior
  command, but also within the army’s own upper echelons. The discontent also
  appears to be spreading to the rank and file. An increasing number of Israeli
  soldiers are refusing to return to Gaza, shaken by the heavy toll of
  Palestinian civilian deaths during the military offensive. Last June, in a
  letter addressed to Netanyahu, the defence minister, Israel Katz, and the head
  of the military, a group of 41 officers and reservists said the government was
  waging an “unnecessary, eternal war” in Gaza and announced they would no
  longer participate in combat operations in the territory. According to
  Israel’s national broadcaster, Kan, only 60% of soldiers are showing up to
  reserve duty. The number includes the so-called “grey refusals” – those who
  cite medical conditions, invoke family obligations, or quietly leave the
  country during the call-up period and “forget” to check their emails. The IDF
  has been approached for comment.
