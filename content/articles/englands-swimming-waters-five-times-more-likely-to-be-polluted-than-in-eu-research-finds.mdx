  English swimming waters are five times more likely to be polluted than those
  in the EU, new research has revealed. Experts have said that the country is in
  danger of becoming the “dirty man of Europe” again as it falls at the bottom
  of the leaderboard for bathing water which is free of bacterial contaminants.
  The campaign group Best for Britain analysed the quality of bathing waters
  under UK and EU standards and found that across all four nations of the UK,
  holidaymakers are less likely to enjoy “excellent” quality waters than in the
  EU. Their research found that while 64.2% of England’s bathing waters were
  rated excellent by the Environment Agency (EA) in 2024, 85.4% of the EU’s were
  excellent according to the European Environment Agency (EEA) in the same year.
  England also had more bathing waters rated as “poor” quality than any country
  in the EU, with 8.4%. Scotland was on 3.4%, Wales on 1.8% and the EU on just
  1.5%. Northern Ireland had no bathing water sites rated poor. By way of
  comparison, Estonia had the highest share of officially rated “poor” bathing
  waters among EU countries (4.6%). Out of all the countries measured under the
  EEA standards, which includes some non EU countries, Albania ranks the worst,
  with 22.9% of its bathing waters rated as poor. A “poor” rating means that the
  water quality falls below the acceptable level for safe bathing, meaning it
  contains too large a quantity of bacteria such as intestinal enterococci and E
  coli. These bacteria can cause serious illness, so people are directed to
  avoid swimming in areas rated poor. At the moment, bathing waters in the UK
  and the EU are measured under the same standards. The UK is under the bathing
  water regulations 2013, and the EU is under the bathing water directive. Both
  regulations apply the same standards of how much of various bacteria, such as
  E coli, can be in 100ml of water to meet the criteria. The government is
  changing the UK’s water regulation system, including scrapping the regulator
  Ofwat and making a new “super regulator”. There could be new water quality
  measurement frameworks as a result of the updated regulation programme. The
  same standards currently apply to UK and EU countries, but many EU countries
  appear to be implementing and enforcing the standards more effectively, Best
  for Britain said. The Office for Environmental Protection, which is the
  watchdog set up to replace EU oversight after Brexit, has found the UK is on
  track to miss water cleanliness targets it would have had to meet if it was in
  the EU. In the EU, countries are due to update their water regulation and
  filter out contaminants from chemicals, pharmaceuticals and pesticides under
  the urban waste water treatment directive. Sir Jon Cunliffe, who wrote the
  government’s recent independent review into the water sector, recently told
  the Guardian that the UK should do the same thing. There are no government
  plans to do so. Campaigners said the UK should take note and keep pace with EU
  regulation. Naomi Smith, chief executive of Best for Britain, which campaigns
  for closer ties between the UK and EU, said: “People are rightly appalled by
  the disgusting state of the UK’s rivers, lakes and beaches. Clean water should
  be guaranteed to all, and no one should have to risk their or their child’s
  health simply by enjoying a swim or paddle on a sunny day. “Once again, when
  it comes to environmental regulation, enforcement and protecting people’s
  health, the European Union leads the charge. This is yet more evidence
  ministers must properly implement and enforce existing standards – and keep
  pace as the EU raises the bar in ways that can tangibly benefit millions, as
  our polling shows voters expect.” Amy Fairman, head of campaigns at River
  Action, said: “This analysis confirms what bathers and river lovers already
  know: UK waters are in crisis. Polluting‑for‑profit water companies,
  industrial‑scale agriculture, and toothless regulation have failed people and
  nature alike. “The independent water commission was right to call for Ofwat’s
  replacement, but only real power, enforcement, and accountability will fix a
  broken system. It’s outrageous that the UK now sits amongst the worst
  performing countries for water quality in Europe – and unless we act, we’ll
  return to our shameful position as the ‘dirty man of Europe’.”
