  Late Apollo 13 astronaut Jim Lovell has received a tribute from Tom Hanks, the
  actor who brought him to life in an Oscar-winning movie and said he had gone
  places most wouldn’t dare. “There are people who dare, who dream, and who lead
  others to places we would not go on our own,” Hanks said of Lovell in a
  heartfelt Instagram tribute post published after the astronaut’s death was
  announced on Friday. “Jim Lovell, who for a long while had gone farther into
  space and for longer than any other person of our planet, was that kind of
  guy.” Hanks portrayed Lovell in the 1995 film Apollo 13. Directed by Ron
  Howard and earning Academy Awards for Best Film Editing and Best Sound, the
  film depicted the failed lunar mission that nearly cost Lovell and his crew
  their lives in 1970. Apollo 13 was intended to be Nasa’s third crewed moon
  landing. But during the US space agency’s mission, manned by Lovell and fellow
  astronauts Jack Swigert and Fred Haise, an oxygen tank in the service module
  exploded roughly 200,000 miles (322,000km) from Earth. Lovell famously
  informed mission control, “Houston, we’ve had a problem.” Hanks later
  immortalized the line in the film, which slightly altered the phrase to,
  “Houston, we have a problem.” With their power and life-support systems
  crippled, the crew was forced to abandon their lunar landing and use several
  engine burns to slingshot around the far side of the moon, setting a course
  back to Earth. About three days after the explosion, they splashed down safely
  in the South Pacific, concluding what became known as the Apollo program’s
  “successful failure”. “His many voyages around Earth and on to so-very-close
  to the moon were not made for riches or celebrity, but because such challenges
  as those are what fuels the course of being alive,” Hanks wrote on Friday of
  Lovell. “And who better than Jim Lovell to make those voyages. “On this night
  of a full Moon, he passes on – to the heavens, to the cosmos, to the stars.
  God speed you, on this next voyage, Jim Lovell,” reads the end of the tribute.
  Lovell died on Thursday at age 97 in Lake Forest, Illinois, Nasa said. The
  cause of death was not immediately released. He made a brief cameo in Apollo
  13 as the captain of the USS Iwo Jima, the navy ship that recovered the crew
  after splashdown. The film was nominated for a total of nine Oscars, including
  best picture. Hanks starred in Apollo 13 alongside actors Gary Sinise, Kevin
  Bacon, Ed Harris, Kathleen Quinlan and the late Bill Paxton.
