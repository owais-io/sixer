  A clutch of players are seen taking it easy on branded bean bags. Bundee Aki
  is keeping warm on the exercise bike. Tom Curry is on his phone, Finn Russell
  is scrolling too before giving a cheeky grin but the British &amp; Lions’
  performance manager, David Nucifora, decides enough is enough and puts a towel
  over the camera inside the dressing room, spoiling the fun. These Lions can be
  hard to love sometimes. They may one day come to realise that giving
  spectators at home a glimpse of how players spend a 38-minute break in play
  could just encourage them to stick with this match. Given the pictures coming
  from the Australia dressing room portrayed a side taking things a touch more
  seriously, perhaps the Lions did not want the public to see what they were up
  to. The stoppage was perfectly in keeping with this chaotic finale to the Test
  series, enthralling and farcical in equal measure, but the shutters were
  pulled down. Another example of this sport failing to help itself. This side
  have made clear they targeted becoming the “best Lions ever”, but how they
  have put up barriers has ensured they will not be the most popular. After this
  thoroughly deserved Wallabies victory, the Lions’ very public declaration that
  they have been targeting a Test series whitewash now look like hubris. The
  mind spools back to Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii’s answer when it was put to him
  before the first Test. “Yeah, I heard about it,” was the response, but the way
  he uttered it said so much more. Should Andy Farrell have rested more of his
  exhausted players? Freshened things up, injected a bit more energy into
  proceedings? Certainly Ben Earl brought some late dynamism while Ellis Genge’s
  introduction, after the break in play, could have come a bit sooner. These are
  questions the Lions hoped not to deal with. Where does this side rank up
  against their forefathers now? They performed breathtakingly well for 40
  minutes in the first half of the first Test, catching an evidently undercooked
  Australia cold, and demonstrated remarkable character in the second half of
  the second. They were consistently average for 80 minutes here on Saturday,
  unable to match the Wallabies’ carrying power and superior handling skills in
  such abysmal conditions. The series was already wrapped up – and that was the
  No 1 objective after 12 years without a victory – but this defeat recasts the
  legacy they will leave. The lasting question will probably be: what if
  Australia’s Will Skelton had been fit for the opener in Brisbane? Oh, the
  brutality of it all. Inside the first 43 minutes, Maro Itoje, Tommy Freeman,
  Tom Lynagh – to a pretty rank shot by Dan Sheehan, who was lucky to escape
  punishment – and James Ryan were all withdrawn with head injuries. Skelton and
  Taniela Tupou had ridden roughshod over the record-chasing Lions – trust the
  Tongan Thor to perform like this in a tempest. We had seen the thunder from
  Down Under, then came the lightning, calling a halt to proceedings for 38
  minutes. Sydney has been a squall all week. It has felt like endless rain,
  punctuated by torrential downpours. The kind where it feels like golf balls
  are falling out of the sky. So it was at the Olympic Park. On the way, a
  generous Lions supporter could be heard offering free ponchos to anyone who
  had failed to read the forecast. An hour before kick-off and spectators were
  dashing for cover. Neither side looked particularly interested in beginning
  their warm-ups while the lines on the pitch had to be repainted, by order of
  the match officials. All things considered then, not the ideal conditions for
  the Lions to set about wrapping up the whitewash. It has been a long old
  season for a lot of these players. It began 11 months ago for many and plenty
  have exceeded the 30-match threshold. It was a start every bit as bad as last
  week for the Lions, truth be told it was worse. The tourists’ lineout wobbled,
  as it did all match, they lost their talisman Itoje to a head injury inside
  the opening half-hour, and Freeman followed before the half was up. He was
  struggling with a back injury and is among those players whose game-time this
  season cannot help but lead to fatigue. Australia, meanwhile, showcased some
  stunning handling that has always been their trademark, even in these horrible
  conditions. The Lions simply could not match them, reduced to relying on Finn
  Russell kicking for territory. It was effective at first, but pretty wayward
  thereafter. The press box here is situated right next to that of the coaches.
  As Farrell trudged down to the changing room shortly before half-time, amid
  the storm, he wore a face like thunder. The second half was less than three
  minutes old before the stoppage and the Lions were arguably more error-strewn
  after the restart. Farrell complained that “rigor mortis” had set in and
  clearly the Lions were thrown by the break. Australia, for their part, were
  rigorous – Joe Schmidt even revealing that the Wallabies were aware that
  lightning was in the area and had come up with a plan should it materialise.
  That Australia were on the pitch, warming up far earlier than the Lions, only
  served to highlight that they were more prepared. They were sharper and
  proceeded to take the game away from their visitors. Perhaps there were better
  ways to spend the break in play than worrying about the cameras.
