  Queen Camilla was a victim of an attempted sexual assault as a teenager and
  used the heel of her shoe to fight off her attacker, a new book about the
  monarchy has claimed. According to Power and the Palace, serialised in the
  Sunday Times, the queen told Boris Johnson about the attack while he was mayor
  of London, a position he held from 2008 to 2016. Valentine Low, the book’s
  author and a former royal correspondent for the Times, spoke to Johnson’s
  former communications director Guto Harri, who recalled the future prime
  minister telling him about the meeting that took place at Clarence House in
  about 2008. In an extract from the book, Harri said the pair “got on like a
  house on fire”, with Johnson making “guttural noises” about how much he
  admired and liked Camilla. He added: “But the serious conversation they had
  was about her being the victim of an attempted sexual assault when she was a
  schoolgirl. “She was on a train going to Paddington – she was about 16, 17 –
  and some guy was moving his hand further and further …” Harri said that after
  Johnson asked what she did next, she had replied: “I did what my mother taught
  me to. I took off my shoe and whacked him in the nuts with the heel.” Harri
  added: “She was self-possessed enough when they arrived at Paddington to jump
  off the train, find a guy in uniform and say, ‘That man just attacked me,’ and
  he was arrested.” The queen, 78, has long campaigned against domestic violence
  and sexual abuse, and has dedicated her royal charity work to supporting
  victims of sexual assault. A number of years ago she championed the idea of
  washbags for people who have been attacked, an idea that has recently been
  revived. • Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse
  issues is available from the following organisations. In the UK, Rape Crisis
  offers support on 0808 500 2222 in England and Wales, 0808 801 0302 in
  Scotland, or 0800 0246 991 in Northern Ireland. In the US, Rainn offers
  support on 800-656-4673. In Australia, support is available at 1800Respect
